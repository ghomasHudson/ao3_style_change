“Remember when you made those ‘Potter stinks’ badges?” Harry asked languidly.
He had already stood up and pocketed his wand in the time it took for Granger and Weasley to exchanged panicked looks.
The next week passed much like they had done before Potter was reintroduced into his life. Draco threw himself into his work, putting in so many hours that even Ira looked at him concernedly from time to time. When he got home, he was usually too exhausted to do anything other than sleep and eat.
“Mine were acceptable,” Pansy said, and Draco fought not to roll his eyes. “Did something happen, Draco? Over the holidays?”
And then Draco realized what Harry had just said; that he was pretty. He felt his face grow warm.
"I might've come back wrong," he nearly whispered. "But…I think, at least if I
“Draco...can I tell you something?” Harry's voice was low but clear in the stillness of the room.
“Sorry, I don’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”
“Yeah, I suppose,” Draco said, feeling marginally better.
“Much easier said than done.”
“But back to you calling me pretty…”
Ginny raised an eyebrow. Harry frowned.
“Huh? No, I’m fine,” Harry replied.
“Alright. What else?”
“You may think you do, but you've just spent the past few years in a haze. It's going to take longer than a week and a half to become adjusted to reality again and to figure out what you want.”
“Yeah, alright,” said Weasley. “I believe you. Happy?”
“You want to come? Or you can stay here,” Ginny offered.
Hermione nodded. “Of course, Harry. And remember, you’re welcome anytime.”
“Hold on tight now. Bye, Harry, Draco. We’ll see you again soon.”
Right. Coffee.
Draco refrained from rolling his eyes. "Well, it's complicated, but to keep it short, we met up yesterday after a year of not seeing each other and we had sex."
“Someone could have told me that you existed,” Harry replied.
“That’s cute,” Astoria smirked. She finished her eggnog, then eyed Draco’s punch. “You done? I’m going to get more.”
“What? No, Draco, it’s nothing like that,” Harry said hurriedly, clearly shocked. He’d stopped walking again.
“It’s all fucked.”
“Er, well. Someone from Hogwarts is also there too.”
She continued to look at him. There was a cig behind her ear and a silver hoop through the side of her nose.
“Yes,” Pansy said, snapping her bag closed. She stood, her eyes flashing between him and Harry. “I’m meeting Padma for dinner. You boys have fun.”
The first thing he noticed was the
Harry, skeptical, stood up and slowly walked over to Draco’s (Harry’s) bed. He sat down with a wince.
“Right.”
There was silence, and then Luna padded into the kitchen in a lilac nightgown (and no bra, Harry saw). He looked away, his face growing hot.
"As in...”
Draco bristled. A few weeks without Pansy’s harsh words and he’d gotten soft. He was annoyed, offended, mad.
Harry paced around his bedroom and ran a hand through his hair.
“I’ve never even tried it,” Harry said. “Hermione’s in it too, I think.”
“After you,
Leo slunk down, satisfied, and wasted no time in taking Draco in his mouth.
Blaise smiled as big as he’d ever seen him.
Harry’s voice snapped Draco out of his tired stupor; he sat up and looked down at Harry, who was thrashing about in his sleep. He was having a nightmare.
“What’s he like? Is he nice to you?”
They sat in silence for a bit. He’d moved onto a different stage of intoxicated – less mental, more physical. He felt kind of slow and sick, and knew the only way to get past it was to drink more.
At break, Draco approached Samuel and Harry. He nodded his head at them in greeting. Harry mirrored him, his eyes taking in the snug turtleneck underneath his coat, lightly tousled hair, and the heavy bags under his eyes. Harry wanted to kiss him.
“And only two days until he’s released.”
Wolff nodded.
“Cheers,” Harry said and lifted his glass, a feeling of hope flowing through him.
"Shit, I'm sorry, Hermione," Harry said, running a hand through his hair. "I'm all right, I'm just..."
“Thank you,” Harry said.
He didn’t answer until he had found what he’d been looking for.
Harry felt a deep pain settle in his chest. Ron and Hermione. Had they seen him like this, unconscious and helpless in a hospital bed?
“Well he wasn’t nice to anyone at first,” Betty pointed out.
“Yeah, I reckon that’s true,” Harry admitted.
“What?” Harry finally asked when he couldn’t take it any longer.
didn’t want –
He obeyed wordlessly, bracing himself on Harry’s shoulders and pushing aggressively into Harry. Harry cried out and squeezed his eyes shut, lost in pleasure. His entire body trembled as Draco continued thrusting inside him, feeling more light-headed than he’d ever been.
“Well,” Leonel said, his voice soft. “You can go home, if you want. I’ll cover for you, and Selina has morning shift too. You don’t have anything scheduled that we can’t do, right?”
“Malfoy, wait.”
“No, of course not, Leo,” Draco said finally, frowning at him. “I apologize, please continue.”
Draco’s gaze predictably fell on Potter at one point; he sipped at his drink as he watched Potter talk to the girl Weasley. Her brother and Granger were nowhere to be found, and Draco was reminded of Potter’s words and blanched.
Harry snapped out of it. Why was he thinking so much on it? It didn’t concern him. Course, he always did have a habit of sticking his nose where it didn’t belong.
He resumed stroking, relishing how he could drive Draco into making that beautiful face – eyes barely closed, panting lightly – with his pale chest rising and falling with thinly veiled intensity.
Draco just smiled slyly at that, but then seemed to realize why Harry was so sticky.
Harry could only seethe at Ginny.
“Hey, Draco. Hi, er, Greengrass,” Harry added, nodding at her.
Draco nodded stiffly. Harry wanted desperately to know what he was thinking, for him to say something, anything.
It was Wednesday again.
“Sorry again. About last night,” Harry said. His voice had suddenly lost all trace of sleep and he was avoiding Draco’s gaze, opting instead to stare up above him. “I didn’t – I’m just, I feel bad about it.”
“Harry,” he said reflexively, “And yeah, I’m alright.”
He focused on Harry again.
"Come on," he said, taking Draco's wrist. "I've got to...put on clothes."
“Harry, it’s just…he’s done
Leo came closer. Draco held his breath as Leonel took the glass out of his hands and set it on the coffee table. He parted Draco’s legs and crawled on top of him so they’d be face to face.
“Why so curious?” Draco challenged. “And better yet, why aren’t
It took Harry a moment to realize what he was talking about.
,” he said, rolling his eyes.
“What?” Harry said immediately, snapping back to it.
She nodded and withdrew herself from the crack in the door. A few seconds later, she opened it so his two closest friends could come inside, their faces strained and worried.
How could she be so calm about this?
Draco watched him, perplexed. His mind was racing. Jealous? Draco never would have guessed. He didn’t even know that Potter liked blokes. And jealous of who? Him…or Estrada?
“Fuck off, Potter,” Draco muttered as he pulled his trousers off completely.
He exhaled shakily. "Yeah. It was just a wave."
“Yeah, I reckon so,” Potter conceded.
From the moment Harry had woken up, he’d felt awful.
“Malfoy?”
"Harry..."
Draco raised an eyebrow.
a –“ Draco began through fritted teeth.
admittedly forgotten all about it. He made a mental note to send them a congratulatory note and gift as soon as possible. “Give my regards to the happy couple.”
Draco rolled his eyes but took Harry’s hand.
“You seem a little irritated, Harry. Unusually so. Did something happen before you arrived?”
Draco had to fight not to roll his eyes. He really couldn’t care less how Blaise’s mother reacted to him dating the youngest Weasley. What business was it of his, anyways? Astoria kicked his foot.
, I find men attractive. That was when I went to Hermione for help.”
Once he was done, he rolled up his sleeves and turned on the tap to wash his face off. He felt numb, which was something that happened whenever he had a violent crying session (though luckily they didn’t happen often). He thought he preferred it to sobbing uncontrollably, but it was still peculiar going from feeling such strong emotion to none at all so quickly. Draco turned the knob.
An uncomfortable silence fell over them as they both considered what ‘everything’ entailed. A whole litany of arguments and taunts, Potter punching Draco in the stomach, Draco breaking Potter’s nose, Potter slicing Draco up…it was endless, really.
And then, just because he was so good at making Harry’s life even more annoying, Malfoy burst into the room, his robes billowing about dramatically. He was quickly followed by Hermione, Ron, and the American Healer.
And before he could stop himself, Draco walked over and sat down in the armchair across from the fire. Potter swiveled to face him, still sat on the floor, and rested his chin in his hand.
“Just water for me, thanks,” Harry said quickly.
Harry attempted a smile and sat upright, leaning against the headboard. He'd tried many times before to get her to call him Harry, but she politely refused.
"Yes, thank you."
Harry simply moaned, clearly still asleep. Draco moved closer, unsure of what to do. Hesitantly, he put a hand on Harry’s arm – it was damp with sweat. He shook him.
“Is it Draco Malfoy?”
“Shut up,” Draco grumbled, but curled up next to Harry all the same, “You arrogant prat.”
“Yeah, he’s out right now though,” Leonel responded with a grin. “He's with a girl.”
The confusion had now been wiped off Potter’s face; he was looking at Draco with this same, indiscernible expression.
“And we know what happened the last time we invited Patterson out for drinks,” Draco mused. “Just us four then?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Are you always so infuriating in the morning?”
“Maybe we should, er, keep walking.”
“How often do you have them?”
“Oh. Er, well, if you’re staying here, I was thinking I’d stay as well,” Harry said with a small smile. “But if not, I’d go to the Burrow. The Weasley’s.”
“Don’t say that,” Draco said sharply. That all-too-familiar weight settled deep in his chest. “Harry, please. I promise you, you haven’t caused any deaths. You’ve helped so many people, and you should be
. Draco put his back against the wall and looked up at the ceiling, afraid of what he would say or do if he kept staring at Harry.
“I mean, yes, he saved the world and all that rot but you can’t just forget what he’s done before he killed…Him.” She paused, biting her lip. “You two have got a long, complicated past, and I feel like you might be ignoring it, or ignoring what he’s done to you at least, and just seeing this idealized version of him instead.”
Harry nodded, flustered. He hadn’t mentioned that.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
Pansy stepped forward menacingly. Draco stood up, and for a second they were face-to-face, perhaps inches apart from each other, and then Draco brushed past her to his wardrobe. He opened it, staring at its contents instead of at Pansy. The room felt several degrees cooler as Pansy stood in the same spot for several moments, and then left the room without another word. When the door slammed shut, Draco exhaled shakily. He closed his eyes and knelt his head against the wardrobe door.
“Sleeping,” answered Draco.
“She helped me,” he said.
Harry bloody Potter, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, the kid hero who was defeating the dark lord at this very moment. While Draco stared, completely and utterly stupefied. Not literally. His heart thudding in his ears, he could feel his mouth dropping fractionally every few seconds, like clockwork. It was as if he was falling more and more in love with Potter every five seconds.
“I’ve brought you a clean set of hospital robes, Mr. Potter,” Betty said as she set it down carefully at the foot of his bed. She then placed a plastic bag on top – there was something in it. His hoodie, probably. “You can put the clothing you’re wearing in there for now.”
“I certainly don’t blame you,” he said. “The
He was definitely nervous now. The last time Harry had that look on his face, he’d told Draco that he died.
“We’re not friends, Potter,” Draco sighed. “We’ve spent the past six years making each other’s lives miserable, and I apologize for my part in that, but the past can’t be forgotten so easily. I can’t believe that you would suddenly care about me – you have no reason to.”
“Good night,” he said.
“Thank you. Really, Malfoy,” Weasley said genuinely.
The irony was not lost on Draco.
“You.” Potter’s breath was hot on Draco’s lips. “You taste like cigarettes.”
“Ow, ow, Christ, all right!”
“I’m not,” Harry said stiffly, though he already was.
“Hullo, Harry.”
“Sorry?”
"Does relapse to drug use mean treatment has failed?
At this point, the potion called for fifteen minutes to simmer gently, leaving Draco with nothing to occupy himself with. He did his best to continue ignoring Potter, and willed him not to talk in return. He didn’t want Potter looking at him. He was unworthy; he was dirt. Potter was a hero, and Draco felt all the more repulsive being so close to someone so exceedingly good – inside and out. Draco wondered if the fifteen minutes had passed yet.
“That’d work too, but in this case, I think the Foreign-Identifier spell would be even better.”
It was like a cold hand had wrapped around Draco’s throat. He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t speak. How could he have been so stupid? Of course Potter thought he was like him, thought he was
He needs to work on his lying abilities, thought Draco, but by some miracle, Granger nodded.
“Right, I hope you’re feeling ready to jump back into it. Who’d like to go next?” Her eyes scanned the room, finally landing on Harry.
She sounded relaxed, and when Draco glanced over at her, she looked it too. It was another way in which she was so different from Pansy; the latter would have tensed and gone into defense mode immediately.
"Thanks," said Draco shortly.
Potter let out a short laugh but didn’t respond. Instead, he turned towards the painting and…
Harry, however, seemed completely unconcerned and had already started on his plate. When he noticed Draco wasn’t eating, however, he stopped chewing and poked his fork towards Draco’s own plate of food.
“All right?” he said to Harry as he approached. He noticed Malfoy, and nodded apprehensively. “Draco, yeah?”
“Will we go back to Daddy now?” asked Rose in a high voice.
“You’ve said that already.”
“And the…?” He found he couldn’t say the words aloud.
“You’re the bloody Head Healer though, aren’t you? Can’t you leave it for tomorrow? It’s going to be three soon.”
“It’s the truth!”
“You saved me then too?”
, but he had a nasty habit of following me everywhere I went our sixth year.”
He sighed and lay down on the bed, rubbing his forehead. The headache was coming back and he was feeling a bit drained – maybe realizing that you’ve fucked your life up did that to you.
“Oh come on, it’s not that bad,” Harry ventured. He was coming closer again, and Draco was backed against a wall. “It’s not like you’ve never felt my sweat before.”
He never would’ve dreamed Draco to be so wonderfully vocal during sex – it made Harry’s heart flutter with a strange affection.
"No. No," Harry said, lowering his voice. "I'd rather stay here."
to him, and yet he found it hard to connect with Muggles – magic had been a part of his life for too long.
When they made their way back to the eighth year Common Room entrance, the two made their goodbyes, knowing it would simply be too risky to enter together in front of who knows how many people. Dinner was surely over by now, and their respective friends were most likely wondering where they were. Draco wished he could kiss Harry goodbye, but settled for a small smile and a 'see you later' before he entered the room first.
He sat down next to Draco with a grunt. Draco cast a sideways glance at him and rolled his eyes.
Draco smirked and said, “I suppose we are. Well…although I do very much love borrowing your clothes, I miss having my own. Perhaps we could go over to my flat for a bit.”
Draco raised his eyebrows. Just trying?
“Hmm,” said Ginny with a slight frown, but then her smile returned. “Well there you go. I knew he fancied you; he wouldn’t be asking Blaise about you if he didn’t.”
“And, pray tell, how do you know that?” Draco asked after a moment.
Harry shifted in his seat and chose to look at the wall instead of Wolff. He was embarrassed; he’d never talked about this before. Ron and Hermione most likely knew even though he’d never admitted it out loud to them – as far as he knew, anyway.
“When are you off?” Ira asked instead of answering.
He raised his eyes, nervous to see how Draco would react, and was shocked to see Draco’s eyes open, emotional, and no longer guarded - for the first time.
He thought it would be too risky to go to the bathroom, so he’d transfigured an empty cup into a large-enough bowl and simply Vanished it all once he was done. It was genius, Draco thought dazedly. How come he had never done this before? A quick Aguamenti and the worst of it was gone from his mouth.
“Well, all I see are formulas, and I hate it.”
“I’d rather just stay here, wouldn’t you?” Harry asked with a devilish smirk. His hand trailed down Draco’s shirt. “Finally get you out of these clothes…”
“Yeah, course.”
Leo grabbed two wine glasses and an unopened red. Draco picked up both his and Leonel’s plates.
"Not," he said haltingly, "Too great."
“Harry…”
“Ah,” said Draco, as if it made sense. “Of course.”
He nodded, and she continued.
He heard the scratch of the chair’s metal legs on the tile floor and looked up, disoriented. Estrada had stood up and was regarding Harry with a sad frown.
“Recovering, yes,” Draco said. “Withdrawal from these certain substances can lead to everything you’re feeling now. It will be difficult now, but you’ll be the better for it later.”
God, why did he buy four? Two would’ve been sufficient; he wouldn’t be needing anymore after today. But still, as he ran his fingers over the small lump in his jeans, he felt a calm that he hadn’t felt in what seemed like ages. Finally, Harry decided on the Moleskin pouch he’d gotten from Hagrid around eight years ago. It was failsafe, really – only the owner could open it.
Harry made a face, and Draco couldn’t help but smile.
“What are you two yelling about?”
He was both surprised and unsurprised to know that they wanted his permission, and from Ginny, no less. He was strangely touched but a bit hurt that they felt they couldn’t just talk to him.
“Say no more,” Blaise said. “I understand. Well, regardless, I recommend you tell Pansy soon if she doesn’t know already, because if she finds out that you’ve been seeing someone without her knowledge, she’ll be mad at you all over again.”
Harry rubbed at his eyes, taking off his glasses to do so.
“Well, isn’t that just wonderful?” she snapped in a very un-Hermione like way. Harry flinched; even Ron looked taken-aback. “He feels really bad, so we should just forget about everything he’s done.”
“Right, of course.”
Harry bit his lip but nodded. Draco paused in buttoning up his shirt and put his hand to the back of Harry’s neck, kissing the top of his head.
“I, er,” Harry began to say, looking flustered, “Sorry, I shouldn’t have done that. We’re both drunk.”
“Merlin’s beard.”
“You’re welcome,” Draco said arrogantly.
“Of course. I’ll take my leave now, but if anyone needs anything, my office is just down the hall and to the right.”
“I’m just looking out for you, you know.”
“Oh, Harry, I’m sorry.” Ginny resurfaced with difficulty and smiled widely at him. “It’s just – was that the best way to introduce the idea?”
He shook Harry’s shoulder.
“So, I went to visit Ginny a couple days ago,” Harry started, watching their faces carefully as he spoke. They both continued eating, listening with interest. He continued, “And I learned something surprising.”
“Oh.” Potter blinked. He looked at Draco curiously. “I, er, wasn’t thinking about that. I didn’t think you would.”
“It was. You were,” Harry said earnestly. Draco’s insides felt light and airy, and he didn’t have the heart to stamp those feelings down. “Well, maybe not the last time. I was gutted, if I’m being honest, Ma– Draco, but er…I don’t think I’d be where I am right now if you hadn’t done that.”
Things with Leo were a bit stilted ever since pub night. Leo was never one to get embarrassed or abashed easily, but Draco thought he might’ve been avoiding him recently. Whenever they had to work together, Draco noticed that Leo wasn’t so easy-going – there were less jokes and less effortless grins. Draco figured that the
,” Potter growled.
Draco looked at him in disbelief, momentarily forgetting how much he didn’t want Potter looking at him.
“No, it’s fine,” Draco said. He thought a moment, wondering how he would answer. “It didn’t take that long for me to figure out I was gay. I feel like I had an inkling for ages, but I was around twelve when I really figured it out. I wrote to my mother in a panic, asking her if it was alright and all that.” Draco scoffed, remembering how foolish it all seemed now. “She wrote back straight away, telling me that of course it was fine, but was I sure? But really, I’ve never been surer of anything in my life.”
Harry looked at Draco. “What’s his deal?”
“I’m just being a good guest, that’s all,” Draco sniffed, turning his eyes to the television, which was flickering through the film in reverse. “It’d be impolite to turn down your…suggestion.”
“Would you like to revise with Padma and me?”
“That was – er, wow,” Harry managed, rolling onto his side to face Draco.
“Thank you for sharing, Samuel,” Kathy said softly.
Ginny gave a strange combination of a grimace and a smile.
“I’m glad you had the chance to engage with him, Harry,” Luna said kindly.
Selina stopped in her tracks, and Draco paused too. She resumed her pace straight-away, though her face was white.
“For a few more hours!”
Harry shrugged. “Healers make money.”
“Good night lads.” Cait winked and walked away, her hips swaying in the dark.
“C’mon,” Harry said, rolling his eyes and taking Draco’s hand.
Draco complied, and as Harry gazed up at him, it looked like he was gone – his eyes were closed, his mouth slightly open, no lines between his eyebrows…like all the sadness and pain in his face had disappeared.
Harry suddenly felt very hot in the crowded pub, even though he’d taken his winter coat off earlier. Where was it, anyway? On the floor, probably. Harry pulled up the sleeves of his shirt and ran a hand through his hair.
Draco’s flat was nice.
Draco’s heart was still pounding with anger, thudding loudly in his ears, but he tried to process what Harry was saying. When he did, he reached up to touch the soft material.
That sounded confusing.
She relaxed into his chest, her head nestled beneath his chin.
“Hi,” Ira said. “Is everything alright?”
“You had an emotionally intimate dream with the man and you still can’t say his first name?”
“You’re so
“They’re Muggles,” Harry went on, focusing on a piece of wallpaper that was curling away from the wall. He tugged on it experimentally. “Who hate magic. My aunt – my mother’s sister – despised her for being a witch, and she despised me for being a wizard. They wished that I was normal instead of a freak and taught me to hide myself so I wouldn’t
“It’s your birthday tomorrow, mate, not mine,” Harry said, trying to keep his voice even. “I’d be fine with it if you are.”
“Did she stop talking to you during your mission?”
“Around half a year after he quit Auror training. And that was…in June 2000.”
“I did research all night. I couldn’t sleep, I just kept thinking about what you’d said. So I snuck into the library and found a few books on erm, wizard sexuality. It was like trying to find out about Flamel or Horcruxes all over again; it was
“Really?”
Harry’s face warmed. “Great. But that doesn’t answer my question. Why was he looking at us like that?”
"No," Harry answered.
Nowadays, he saw himself in the lime green robes more than anything, so it was a bit of a boost to his self-esteem when he wore Muggle clothing. He chose a simple fitted black T-shirt accompanied by a grey zip-up, and his favorite jeans that made his arse look incredible (in his humble opinion). He swept his hair out of his face even though it would get messed up from Apparition anyway.
“I swear, you prat,” Harry said, and kissed him briefly. “Now let’s go, we’re going to be late.”
Draco stopped walking right away and turned to face Harry, who was looking over Draco’s shoulder and past the icy water with a serious expression.
Draco never had anything to say when this happened. Pansy would look at him worriedly, her hands halfway between clasping his own and worrying a loose thread on her robes. He’d tell her not to worry, it was just strange to be back after everything but he’d be back to normal soon enough, you’ll see. She never looked convinced, but she knew him well enough to stop pushing. She’d leave until next time, and he’d wonder what “normal” for him even was.
“I really didn’t mean to make you think I thought badly of you,” Harry said after a pause.
Draco tried to focus. What had he wanted to tell Potter? Oh.
Harry firecalled Ginny the next morning. When her face appeared in the fire, tired and yawning, he asked if she’d go get coffee with him. She declined citing tiredness, so Harry offered to bring coffee (plus pastries) for the two of them (and Blaise!). She nodded and disappeared.
And then there were days where death was the only thing on his mind, the only thing he could think about, the only thing he wanted. He would never voice these particular thoughts to Pansy; he knew it would just cause trouble.
He walked away despite Harry’s protests.
“So forget all those poor Muggle buggers as long as I won’t die, right?”
Thankfully, Johnny said nothing more of Harry’s abrupt disappearance and began rummaging around on his filthy table. “Sure, yeah. Just got a new shipment of Xanax today, actually. How much?”
Draco cleared his throat and looked away. “I can talk to my superior and see that I have this case reassigned to Healer Estrada so there’s no conflict of interest.”
Ira let out a small laugh and shook their head in mild disbelief.
“Er, sure,” Harry said nervously. He avoided Malfoy’s gaze at all costs as he looked around vaguely, not really making eye contact with anyone. “Well, my name’s Harry. I found out about this group pretty recently, although I’ve lived in this area for a few years now. I’m, er, looking forward to it and to getting help and all that…”
Potter stood his ground. “What’s wrong? What happened? You just ran out of there in the middle – “
“But it wasn’t ideal. I know that. I can say that and believe it, because I know they really disliked me…I know they weren’t the best caregivers, and I know that locking me in a cupboard for ten years wasn’t right. But they took me out eventually. They gave me a room and food when it wasn’t too much trouble, when
any bruises there tomorrow. He was murmuring something below his breath as he gained speed, fucking Draco harder and harder. Draco’s hands scrambled for sheets – there weren’t any – and had to settle for clawing into the mattress. He spread his legs wider for Harry, willing and wanting to take everything Harry could give. Harry took this as a sign and pushed them even further apart, now driving his cock so far into Draco that there was the sound of skin hitting skin every time he thrust forward.
Draco arched an eyebrow. “Is that so?”
Draco swallowed. He thought back to what Harry told him about his relatives.
“We’re doing this for you,” Macmillan said sharply to Harry, then nodded in Draco’s direction, “Not for him.”
your family," Ginny said, and sounded slightly hurt. "Even if, y'know, we didn't get married like Mum wanted us to."
"Salazar, I don't know. I haven't dated anyone in nearly two years, and that was Leo…"
“I was there. That night,” Potter said, his eyes meeting Draco’s own. “With Dumbledore. I saw you lower your wand.”
“Language, Potter,” Malfoy said, though the vehemence was out of his tone. He just sounded tired.
“They already have.”
“Whatever,” said Draco, sliding his shoes off and going to lie back against his pillows and headboard. He folded his hands together in his lap. “Say what you’ve come here to say. Make your case.”
“Congratulations, Harry. I always thought you two would make an agreeable couple.”
Hermione bit her lip, relief on her face, and Ron grinned slightly.
“All right.”
“Leonel Estrada. And you are Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley, if I’m correct?”
Draco was nearly always amused by the contrast between the two of them – Betty with her soft voice and posh English accent, and Leo with his warm, open voice and unabashedly American accent. How Leonel seemed to grow bolder in Draco’s presence, and Betty more timid. Their only real similarities were their ink black hair and the passion they had for their work.
, he wanted to say. He kept his mouth shut and watched Blaise begin to put on his necktie.
When he walked into the kitchen, he saw Malfoy at the sink, pouring water into one of Harry’s glasses. It was unbelievable just how breathtaking the sight was, because it really was just Malfoy in his crisp, white button-up and (fairly) tight black trousers standing in Harry’s kitchen.
“Fine.”
Speak of the devil, Harry thought, as his eyes landed on Malfoy, who was stood talking to Estrada in front of his office.
“Excellent,” Kathy said. “Shall we go around the room? Who would like to start?”
"Fuck," he muttered.
“You’re still wearing my scarf.”
“Harry, you can tell me if she said something,” Draco said. “I can have a talk with her, tell her-“
hint of this whatsoever – so when I just walked in on the two of you in bed together I didn’t know what to think!”
So Ron was right. He sighed, then looked at Malfoy.
, and worse, dangerous. I’ve almost killed people, Harry-“
“Whatever you say,” Potter said, still smirking.
He’d taken the other two pills the next day while Ginny was in the shower. The day after that, he dutifully went to see Wolff, pretended everything was Going Great, and made a stop at Johnny’s to smoke a spliff with him before heading back home.
"Of course, Mr. - Harry," Estrada said, a sheepish smile on his handsome face. "I apologize."
“I liked it,” said a man, probably a year or so younger than Harry. His black hair was swept back, and he had the sort of face you could trust. “I found myself relaxing, which I’d been unable to do all week.”
Perplexed, Draco sent a reply as quickly as he could.
He remained on the ‘f’ of ‘friends’ for far too long, making it sound more like ‘fffffffff-riends.’
He’d seen Potter smile more this afternoon than he had the entire school year.
“Nah,” said Potter. “Staying here. It’ll be my last chance at Christmas at Hogwarts and, er, I think the Weasleys need their space, since…”
“We’re closing off our Floo from now on,” Draco snapped.
The iconic theme song began playing as the yellow words flew onto the screen. Harry leaned forward eagerly, ignoring Draco’s whine about it being too loud.
"Do you think anyone cares? I've been ostracized from the Wizarding world, and for good reason. No one trusts me - no one should. When you first walked into group, I thought you'd go somewhere, tell someone about me, make me the laughing stock again. Honestly, I don't even know why you've even talked to me, let alone - let alone..."
But it did, another part of him argued. He wanted so desperately to know what he was doing here, amongst Muggles, after he had slinked into anonymity after the trials.
Leo lowered Draco’s pants and stroked the length of Draco’s cock, making him gasp sharply and bite Leo’s bottom lip in retaliation. Leonel pulled back, his chest heaving as he looked Draco up and down.
Draco sighed and backed away, sat down. He frowned at Harry, who was watching him reproachfully.
Instead of answering, Harry knelt forward, elbows on his knees and hands covering his face.
Draco kissed him again, threading his fingers through the mess of Harry’s hair. He felt Harry smile into the kiss, and Draco couldn’t help but smile back.
“Of course I do you prat,” Harry groaned. He grabbed hold of Draco’s hair, pulling it so he’d meet his gaze. “Need more though.”
“Unlikely,” Potter sighed. “It's like I've forgotten how to sleep without all the potions.”
“Fair enough,” Draco said with a light laugh. He looked down and straightened out his shirt carefully. “Though it’s not at as interesting as you might think. Just your average war trauma.”
"In that case, I do recommend staying at St Mungo's until you feel a bit confident in leaving."
“That’s awfully bold of you to say, Malfoy.”
Ron froze mid-bite and shook his head before saying, “I swear, something happened to you two when you were dating. Some sort of bi curse.”
“I didn’t know you approved of it that much,” Harry said, getting that grin on his face again.
Draco made to leave but was interrupted by Potter calling his name.
“Harry!” she yelped and reached for the bottle.
“Well, that’s good.”
Ron patted his back with slightly shaky hands and said quietly, “Thanks mate.”
Draco’s whole brain went fuzzy. He blinked. Once, twice. Had he heard Harry correctly?
"Kreacher will begin preparing breakfast for the young masters," Kreacher said.
They both took off their lime Healers robes, leaving them hanging on Ira’s standing coat rack, exited St. Mungo’s, and walked the short distance to a homey Muggle café. After ordering sandwiches, the two of them sat down at a corner table. A waitress brought their food and drinks over a few minutes later, and when they’d both had a few bites of food, Draco decided to start.
“Oh. Ginny,” Potter sighed. “I still don’t know how to tell her. And it’s even worse cos…well, do you talk to Parkinson about…things?”
Stumbling tiredly out of his fireplace, he was surprised to meet the wide, yellow eyes of a strange owl through Draco’s living room window. Bemused, Draco went over to open the window and let the owl in. The owl hooted contemptuously as it hopped inside and stuck its leg out.
I'm sure there's loads of mistakes but I wanted to post before I had to go to work today since it's nearly been a year! So so sorry and hope you enjoy. Just ignore any errors you see <3
did not mean to say that. Nothing good came out of being vulnerable, and he would never forget what had happened when he’d originally asked Potter for his friendship. And sure, he might have come to the conclusion that they were friends, but he’d never acknowledged it out loud. He was too scared to.
“I’m fine,” Draco repeated, his voice hard.
need to forget about him. He was a patient, and Draco his Healer. It would be all sorts of wrong to pursue Potter; Draco felt bad even
“You’re still just as good at Potions as before,” Potter said with a nervous cough. When Draco said nothing, he continued. “Which is good, since I’m just as bad.”
Once he thought Harry was ready for another, he put a second finger in, and then a third. After some more pumping, Draco spoke.
“I’m sorry, Leo,” he said at once. “I swear to Salazar that I didn’t have feelings for Potter when we were dating. I hadn’t even seen him in – what, five years? It’s really just that I had a big, pathetic crush on him when we were in school and I’d just repressed it after the War. Well, until –“
“Ohhhh, interesting,” said Cait. “But you two didn’t especially like each other, yeah? And you still don’t.”
. Maybe I’m just dreaming, and that’s why you’re talking.”
Harry closed the distance between them with a kiss. Draco moaned into it, pride long gone, and he gripped Harry’s arm as his tongue slipped into Harry’s mouth.
When he came back, Pansy was packing up the rest of her materials, and Harry was sitting there, a stony expression on his face. Draco looked between the two of them curiously.
He loosened his grip, surprised at himself. The cigarette was on the ground, nearly broken in half. Draco stared at it for a moment, then at Harry. He looked nervous, tentative, and almost ashamed.
Harry was already completely hard, leaking slightly with pre-come. Draco licked his lips and bent down close.
Harry shrugged. “They’ll know everything anyway.”
Draco jumped and turned around.
“I’m certain the

“Hi, Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry, and offered the wine to her. “This is for you, from the both of us.”
“Helloooo?”

was all very sudden and I don’t fancy vomiting all over myself in front of –“
Unconvinced, Hermione shook her head but simply said, “Boys.”
“Here.” He hurried over and held the door open. “Put him in here.”
“Harry,” he said softly when he couldn’t stand it any longer.
“He makes me not want to die.”
“Hey Potter,” said Draco lazily, prodding his side with a finger.
He breathed out and suddenly realizing just how much he’d spoken in a relatively short amount of time. Wolff was looking at him, unaware or uncaring of his sudden and slight embarrassment.
Harry’s face went hot as he stood up and brushed himself off. His hands trembled lightly as he wiped his glasses clean with his shirt. He felt strangely vulnerable and raw after that hour with Wolff, and he wasn’t certain if he was stable enough to deal with Malfoy just yet.
"I know, Harry," she said, rubbing his back with a hand. "But it'll pass."
friends,” Potter said, blinking at him with wide eyes. “I just meant they don’t seem to think so. Ron and Hermione, at least. It’s like they’re under the impression that we’re trying but it’s doomed to fail. Like it’s impossible just because we were shits to each other when we were kids.”
“I mean, what are we doing?” Draco asked, dropping his hand. His face was pained. “We’re not…meant to be together. You deserve better.”
“I was never obnoxious,” Harry argued, but his voice was softer. After a long pause, he said so quietly that Draco had to strain to hear him, “You make me feel alive again.”
Draco could tell that Granger’s mind was already furiously at work, and Weasley mostly looked sick.
Harry saw a head of red hair and another of brown almost immediately, and he made his way over to the table they were occupying. Four faces smiled at him: Ron, Hermione, George, and Luna.
Malfoy seemed slightly taken aback by Harry’s sudden determination, but simply smiled.
“But really, our success is all due to you,” grinned George. He lifted his own pint and took a swig.
“I understand it’s none of my business,” Blaise said, tightening his tie sharply, “But I’m curious, and you have woken me up once or twice.”
Ginny gave him an appreciative smile and came close, sitting down in one of the chairs. Zabini sat down next to her, the expression on his face indiscernible.
He screwed his eyes shut and let out a shaky breath. He wanted a drink, or better yet, a potion.
"You saved our lives. You could have easily identified us and handed us over, but you didn’t. I owe you."
“Watch me. Now sit.”
“A Muggle, I’m guessing?”
It was only until Leonel came back from the Auror Department with pertinent facts on a homicide case Douglas and his partner had been investigating that they put all the information together. Ira went to work immediately on brewing an antidote that would target the negative effects the poisons were having on Douglas, and Leonel and Betty would continue to monitor him until it was done.
“Harry,” he said automatically. At Malfoy’s look of surprise, Harry’s face heated up at an impressive rate, but he managed to keep eye contact with him. “Er, call me Harry, I mean.”
"Yeah," said Harry. He unlocked and opened the front door. "Sirius left it to me."
“Obviously!”
"I woke up in Mungo's. Looks like I walked myself over while inebriated and just...passed out."
But it wasn’t Draco’s fault. Potter was handsome in an unconventional way with his untamable hair and the curve of his nose and his unusually bright green eyes and the way they contrasted with his dark skin. He was simply mesmerizing. Draco had been mesmerized ever since he’d met the prat and he doubted that it would ever stop. Draco was certain he could still recall all the quirks and habits of Potter’s that he’d picked up on during Hogwarts. Even now, Draco was committing the sight of a sleepy Harry Potter in a loose shirt and sweatpants to memory.
“Good work, Potter,” Draco said clearly, nodding approvingly. He then addressed Leonel. “Now we just need to make sure it works. He should feel it in his system soon, perhaps a minute or two.”
Draco swallowed and nodded.
“But do you really want to hear it?” Harry countered, and Weasley lost some of the color he had regained in the past minute. “Look, I’m sorry. I didn’t purposefully keep anything from you. I just know you don’t approve in the first place, so I didn’t think you’d like to know the specifics.”
A silent breeze shook the bushes and trees, and Harry longed to feel it on his skin.
Heat rushed to Draco’s face and he looked away, flustered. He really,
“Malfoy?”
"D'you remember now?" he asked, his voice husky.
Draco stiffened just for a moment. “You’ve already tried that, Potter, did you forget? Madam Pomfrey would be no help, even if I did consent, and my mother has quite enough to worry about. I forbid you from telling her about this.”
“Draco,” he said softly, coming close again, “Say something. Please.”
“No, of course not – you’re twisting my words.”
“Oh.” It was Harry’s turn to be surprised. “I didn’t know. What house were you?”
Malfoy didn't look completely convinced but he let it drop.
“Why don’t I leave, Mr. Potter,” Estrada suggested with a quiet voice, “So you can get some rest?”
“Morning,” said Draco softly as Harry’s eyes found him.
"Huh? Oh," Harry understood his meaning now. "It was sort of a present. To myself. For reaching one year."
“It was weird,” said Harry (
. He’d since stopped this habit, too, but only after Ron had a serious talk with him. He was careful to only drink socially instead of drinking to forget how much he wanted to die.
“I want my friends to like each other,” he said wistfully.
“If you’re certain you don’t want it.”
He smoothed his hair down and took out the spare robes he kept in his office. He quickly replaced his wrinkled robes with the fresh ones.
Looking it over, he saw that Betty had taken care to list all the symptoms Potter had been suffering, and was relieved to see that they were all byproducts of withdrawal.
like both. People like Harry.
Draco knew that they wouldn’t work out. He felt confident in it now, especially after last night. Yes, they made excellent colleagues and were more than compatible in bed, but as romantic partners? The love was long gone – if it had ever been love, that is. Leonel was intelligent and funny and caring and so bloody fit, but there was no spark. It made Draco feel ridiculous, but he really craved it. True love, or whatever it was. And he already knew he wouldn’t find it in Leo, no matter how much he had wanted to in the past.
Potter looked dubious.
Draco couldn't seem to decide if he should be impossibly happy or wracked with guilt, and it was driving him mental. The battle waging inside him must have been outwardly apparent as well, since Leo, Betty, and Ira all asked him if he was ok.
“I dunno,” Harry said. “Doesn’t matter.”
“Er,” said Harry.
“I still don’t know why you didn’t.”
"Purely business, I'm afraid. I was wondering if you'd be willing to take on a new client."
Draco’s eyes widened fractionally before growing dark with lust. He withdrew his fingers and slicked his cock thoroughly, openly taking in Harry with his eyes – Harry’s face, his body, his hard cock. Harry’s breath hitched as Draco smoothly positioned himself over Harry, plying his legs apart (not that it was difficult, really, Harry would do anything Draco wanted at this point) so Draco could have easy access.
As Harry stuffed the Cloak into his trunk, Draco went over to sit on Harry’s bed. He pulled off his cloak and kicked off his shoes, pushing them all underneath the bed so they were out of sight.
Draco looked at him in surprise.
Harry checked his watch; it was the one Molly had given him five years ago. 5.27. Group was set to begin in three minutes. He was surprised he had come early; perhaps it was the nerves. Perhaps it was because he didn’t want to give himself the chance to sit around making excuses as to why he couldn’t go.
- I didn't realize how much harder it was/is to get xanax ~on the street~ in the UK as opposed to the US, but it's still possible.
Harry glanced over at him, trying to gauge his response.
“I’m betting people,” Harry said confidently. “Maybe even house elves.”
“That was Ron. He punched you.”
Harry shrugged.
With a scowl and a tightness in his chest, Draco left.
Just one drink, one pill, one line, and all of this would just melt away. God, his mouth watered at the thought of a nice, thick line of cocaine just sitting there, waiting for him, giving him what he needed to get through the evening and the drip that he craved so badly.
“So…?”
“I thought, it might remind me that this is real. That I’m real. Sometimes I feel disconnected. Or maybe, I think, I deserved it. I wanted to see myself bleed.”
“Oh, yeah,” Harry said. He stuck out a hand. “I’m Harry.”
Harry gave a loud hiss but Draco didn’t stop; instead he started rubbing,
“Sorry,” he croaked.
It was just a silly infatuation, wasn’t it? Hogwarts was a long time ago and he didn’t even know the man who was in front of him now. They’d both changed in the past seven years. It was obvious.
“Harry.”
“You look good, Draco,” Leonel said suddenly, causing Draco to swivel around and face him once more.
,” said Malfoy, and Harry relaxed, feeling the Disillusionment charm wearing off him.
“It’s weird, when I see him, I’m just reminded of how he was when he was during Hogwarts, the slimy git, but then he opens his mouth and it’s different,” Ron said. “Like he’s still rude, but not in certain-people-should-die way. ‘S weird.”
“You’re unbelievable. Truly.”
“They’re having a party, you know,” Pansy said finally. She drew her legs in close and wrapped her arms around them. She looked cold. “The rest of the eighth years. A Halloween get-together. We’ve been invited as well, if you’re interested.”
Potter looked surprised. “No! No, really. I think he got it out of his system.”
?” Draco asked finally, his tongue twisting stupidly on the words.
He didn’t remember much besides falling and the overwhelming smell of blood. He knew Harry remembered more, and that he was remembering it right now, judging by how tense he was.
He really didn't want to give her an introduction about himself - it felt redundant and ridiculous.
“Let’s go in, shall we?” Draco offered when they’d stood there for a few more moments, the two of them obviously having no clue what to say next.
God, he had really fucking yelled at Malfoy about how he fancied him.
“So shut up,” Ginny finished harshly, her arms crossed against her chest defensively, “And get better. Because we all need you. The
Draco raised an eyebrow, his curiosity overpowering his unease. “Things?”
Draco let out a breathy laugh. Harry Potter thought that their having an amicable conversation was
He heard a muffled noise, and Draco gave a breathy laugh.
“Merlin,” said Astoria, stunned. “I never understood him. He’s always seemed off to me.”
“If I had a sickle for every time I heard that…”
He wiped at his nose again and saw that Potter was right – another red smear.
“What’s wrong?” Harry was smiling slyly.
Harry did so and uncrossed his arms. Breathing exercises weren’t always effective for him, as his mind tended to wander a fair bit. The disastrous occlumency lessons that took place so long ago was proof of that.
“Hmm?” He sounded tired.
drunk.”
The nervous expression on Harry’s face was deepened.
The giant knot that had been in his chest since he woke up hadn’t ceased by the time the game was due to start. It took him a while to force himself out of bed, but he was here now.
“You’ve never gone to Scrivenshaft’s before?” Draco asked, appalled.
Draco let out a shaky breath. “Yes. Yes, I want you, I want all those things.”
He took a few breaths, hoping he wouldn’t have to cry after all, but it proved useless. He knew that if he didn’t do it now, he’d be on the verge of tears for much longer. Better to get it over with now. A few seconds later, he was gasping and crying uncontrollably into the same sink that had become familiar to him two years ago.
Potter’s eyes flashed at the use of the nickname, and Draco felt a sort of sick pride at the look of discomfort on his face.
“Thanks, Selina,” he said, feeling that he really wouldn’t.
Draco moved back to Harry’s pelvis, his breaths heavy. This was actually happening, he couldn’t believe it was happening, Harry wanted him, and Draco wanted him too, he wanted him so bad. Draco’s head spun.
“It’s meant to be confidential,” Harry retorted, crossing his arms.
“Yeah, well.” Potter shrugged. “I reckon some part of me wanted to see you anyway.”
mesmerizing even though Harry’s seen it several times now. The markings were so beautiful, so intricate, and Harry felt he could run his fingers over it forever.
Kathy went on to the next person, and Harry tried to pay attention but his mind kept replaying what Draco had said.
“Oh, please, Malfoy’s an alright bloke and he’s almost as obsessed with you as you are with him. I’ll lop off my arm if he breaks things off with you. Now that you’ve finally gotten the green light from him, I’m seeing a lot of action in your future,” Ginny said confidently, grinning again. “But really, Harry, years?”
“It’s Draco now, remember?”
Ginny’s eyebrows raised considerably. “Engaged?”
“Thank you, Malfoy,” he said gravely.
Draco flinched.
“Fine,” said Harry sharply after another minute of silence. “We’ll do it right, then. Go on dates, wine and dine, ease into it. Is that what you want?”
“You didn’t,” he said hurriedly. “It’s my fault. I thought I could do this.”
Once Potter had realized that Draco had caught him, however, he looked away so quickly that Draco was surprised he didn’t suffer any whiplash.
She hesitated and took his hands in her own.
Kreacher bowed and disappeared with a crack. Harry then turned to Hermione, who was still staring at him with wide eyes.
Draco felt himself getting hard already, already weak from the missed chance earlier in the day.
, though,” Potter insisted.
"Ginny's told us that she's planning on staying with you for a bit," he said, clearing his throat. He was eyeing Harry seriously, as if daring Harry to say something rude to his fiancée. "Help you get settled."
“Exactly,” Draco said, happy to have been proven right. But then, “I forbid you from telling them about any of my – my
“I dunno,” he said again. He was saying that too much. He sighed. “I just do.”
“No, just paperwork. Would you mind if I asked what substances you’re currently on?”
Harry turned and took hold of the door handle.
“I just wanted to make certain,” he said stiffly. “So then, what are you going to tell them exactly? We struck up a conversation about one of our many similarities and surprise – we’ve fallen head over heels for one another?”
“Potter, just tell me what I’ve done wrong!” Draco burst out, his voice loud and bordering on desperation. “We’d been getting on fine before you suddenly started giving me the cold shoulder. I am your
He pushed his way through the crowd to the loo, slamming the door open and scaring a young man.
Harry laughed. “Good. Well, now that you won’t have to wear my awful clothes anymore, I’d like my shirt back, please.”
“Alright," Potter said, but he was still frowning. “Still, I'm sorry. I reckon I was insufferable.”
The two turned and left without any preamble, four pairs of eyes glued to their backs. They turned back to their original positions.
"Um it's fine, could you leave us for a second?" Harry responded, feeling faint.
"I'm going to get released on Monday anyway. It's only a couple of days. Come on, Gin, what difference would it make?"
at him.
Harry walked past Draco with purpose; he nodded at each of the three Weasleys in turn as they went past. He followed Granger, and then the five of them were stood in Draco and Harry’s new bedroom, admiring the newly-built bed.
Granger gave Potter a slightly disapproving look at that.
“Thank you, Healer Estrada,” Draco said, though a smile tugged at his lips. “I’m assuming you’ve gone to check in on Potter?”
“Do you think Weasley really wants to hit me?” he asked tentatively.
“Ron and Hermione found out.”
“Must I spell it out? I’m asking if this was one of your

face before continuing to Draco. “And yes, I did get your letter before – I’m sorry I never responded, I reckon I was still a bit overwhelmed. I’m…glad, I suppose, to know that you feel badly about it all.”
once again, but she still didn’t give up.
“Really?” Samuel looked surprised. “Huh. I’ve been going to these things since secondary school.”
“Spit it out, Malfoy.”
“Hm,” Samuel said, raising his eyebrows at Harry.
He kept his head down as he walked through the corridors, wanting to be invisible. He was still in denial of the burning sensation in his eyes, half-hoping that if he ignored it long enough, it’d go away. Of course, that wasn’t how it worked.
Harry stood there, bright sunshine filtering in from behind him and acting as a halo. Draco blinked and squinted; his eyes were slow to adjust to the sunlight.
) and he ran his hands over Draco’s chest, skimming over everything in his reach, marveling at just how
Harry thought. Had he?
,” Malfoy rolled his eyes. Harry wondered if he was this much of a dick to all of his patients. “Your vitals are still stable, and your body is nearly rid of all the foreign bodies. Of course, we’ll be administering a very weak Calming Potion to you tonight; it’ll ease your body and mind, and hopefully help you to sleep. You
“No,” Harry whined, squeezing himself tightly against Draco. “Wake up.”
There was a lot that was left unspoken there, Harry knew. So much Estrada was holding back. Why did he care so much anyway? Were they best mates as well as coworkers – or rather, superior and employee?
“Hm,” Leonel agreed.
“Does that happen often?”
Draco looked up. “Has there been a change in your symptoms?”
“My ex? Pansy is
“Right,” said Ginny, putting her hands on her hips. “Second order of business is dumping all the rubbish you’d gone and gotten yourself addicted to.”
Draco let out a shaky breath as he read over the letter for the third time. He then hurried back to the bathroom so he could make sure he looked decent.
Harry nodded, his throat tight.
different from the Manor, though that was unsurprising. It was clean and light and modern, its furniture simple and in warm tones instead of cool ones. And it certainly wasn’t as unnecessarily large.
“You alright?”
Her hand hovered over the place she kept her wand. Draco worried that she wasn’t sober enough to be able to wield it properly – not that there would be any need for that.
Harry’s cock throbbed with want as he watched Draco slink down to take it with a wet mouth.
“Oh, just the usual, I guess. I, er,” Potter stopped and ran a hand through his hair.
Draco looked up; Potter was standing a foot away from him, a hesitant look on his face.
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have dragged you along.”
"Wanna come back to mine?" Harry asked breathlessly, trying to keep the fear out of his face.
Harry nodded. “I was surprised too.”
Malfoy was writing on his clipboard again. It was a peculiar sight.
“We’ll be going now,” Draco announced as the pair of them stood up.
“What, are we not?” he retorted confidently.
Ginny’s arms fell and she narrowed her eyes at him. “Are you feeling alright, Harry?”
Once he’d finished, he set down his quill and stretched out his cramped hand before reading over his work. Deeming it acceptable, he collected his belongings and left his office, report in hand. As he was locking his door, he locked eyes with Leonel. Draco muttered a curse under his breath as Leo stopped and waved a hand in greeting.
Draco followed them at a distance, watching as the three of them exchanged their goodbyes. And then Harry and Granger seemed to realize something – there was no Floo powder.
“Oh,” Ginevra said. She shifted her weight onto her other foot. “What about him?”
"It might have been...the first time was probably a year ago," Harry said slowly, shivering as he recalled the memory. "I was at a Muggle club. And this er, this bloke I was dancing with went in the loo. After a minute or two I got tired of waiting so I followed him in there. And he was uh, doing a line. Of cocaine. And he saw me and offered me a bump and I thought, why not..."
Harry took it in his hand; it seemed to fit perfectly. He stroked it slowly and gently at first, and when Malfoy urged him
“Hm,” was all Potter said.
for a
“So hot,” Draco gasped, “
Malfoy stood in front of him, clipboard in hand and quill at the ready. Harry was sat on the bed, cross-legged and over the covers, still wearing the Muggle clothes he had come in with.
me. I’m just...thinking.”
Draco would never get over the way Leo said ‘Potter’; it was so appallingly American. He had to laugh.
“Well,” Malfoy said, straightening his back as he did, “It turns out that I’m not as big-headed and self-important as some and don’t feel the need to overshare.”
Ginny put a hand around his waist and tugged him close, leaning her head against his shoulder. Harry sighed and put his arm round Ginny.
Not that he’d ever been in one. He’d caught snippets of hospital scenes on Dudley’s television sets when he was a child.
during school and it’s finally happening, they’re engaged and she said
“Probably just as bad as you think it is.”
"Leo..."
“I admit you do have some decent titles, but you either come off as a pretentious shit,” Draco ran a finger down the side of
He’d known Harry had
Draco felt ridiculously underdressed with Harry in his Muggle street clothes and him in his favorite silk pajamas. Merlin, and what kind of person had silk pajamas? He made a mental note to himself:
“You don’t need to say anything, Harry,” Draco said, looking Harry square in the eye. “I know he was deeply flawed and dangerous, and there’s no excuse for what he did. Especially to you and…Ginevra.”
"I would like your own version of yourself, not a newspaper's or history book’s version."
“Yeah, I’m staying,” he said. “You won.”
Samuel hummed thoughtfully.
Once Harry had shut the door closed behind him, he walked over to a more secluded area, already withdrawing the little bag out of his pocket. Once he was satisfied he wouldn’t be seen, he opened the bag up. His hands shook as he took out two of the little pills.
He kept his black pajama bottoms on, figuring he had nothing to do and nobody to impress, choosing only to pull on a thick, grey sweater over his top that hid his body well.
And he did.
“I would, yes,” said Draco.
“And this,” said Malfoy, pulling out yet another piece of parchment and handing it to Harry, “Is a list of resources for you. You can contact Healer Wolff or myself at any time, day or night. The addresses I included there are our work addresses, but if need be, an owl will be able to locate us at our homes. I’ve also included some other reputable Mind Healers if things don’t work out with Healer Wolff.”
Draco closed his eyes. Of course he was. Fucking Harry Potter has to be in the middle of everything. He rubbed at his forehead, feeling a headache coming on.
your recovery is more important,” Draco said. “You’ve got to figure out who you are as a person again without the drugs. Any new relationship would be a distraction from staying sober, or worse, a substitute for the drugs, that is to say, something to be dependent on. It would mean a greater risk of relapse in the case things go wrong in the relationship.”
Nevertheless, Draco had eaten solid food for the first time in about two days (fifty-three hours, to be precise) and he thought he could actually keep it down. And the stomach pain was minimal, which was an unexpected bonus.
“Harry,” he nearly whispered.
He fell back onto the bed as Harry panted harshly, his eyes shut as he willed his heartbeat to slow. When it did minutes later, he opened his eyes and looked over at Draco, who was breathing heavily, a lazy smile on his face.
“Er, yeah,” Harry said quickly, thankful for the excuse. “I’m fine, though, promise.”
“Well said,” Draco replied.
This got a little smile out of Harry. “Which is?”
“You asked,” Potter smirked, clearly amused. “But, er, yeah. I’m sort of left alone when they go off to…y’know. Which is fine; they have six bloody years of pent-up
“It’ll be over soon,” Draco assured Leonel over Potter’s yells.
He opened his eyes and blinked at Malfoy, who was now sitting on the floor with him, looking strange and out-of-place in his lime green robes and in Harry’s flat. Malfoy was staring at him, grey eyes intense as they regarded Harry carefully.
Draco yelped at a sudden loud
“What’s wrong? You aren’t eating.”
who’s going back on my word.”
“But can she
Harry finally did stop, backing away with a smile that told him that he was very proud of himself. Draco shuddered.
understand, he couldn’t. “I need to do this.”
His thoughts must have shown on his face because Potter frowned and scooted closer.
His face was still wet from rinsing it off; he reached up to wipe the moisture off with wet hands. It didn’t do much good. He stared blankly into his own grey eyes for another minute before going to sit against a wall.
“Why you're friends with Ron and Hermione and Ginny,” said Potter. “I didn't know why they would be so accepting of you, but now I realize it's because I only had the image of you at seventeen. Not the...you now.”
“That’s rich, coming from the biggest fucking git I know.” Harry stood up, the chair making a harsh squeaking noise against the floor.
and watched his immediate area light up before him.
“Go,” Draco said before Potter could say anything. “You should return to your friends. Wouldn’t want to be found out here with me.”
“Discretion is my middle name,” Harry gave him a little grin.
“Anyway,” Ginny said, seeming to remember Harry’s presence in her flat. “How did brunch go? I don’t imagine Ron was too pleased.”
Ginny gave a short laugh and shook her head. “No. No, Harry, I’m glad you told me. I was just surprised, is all.”
be, for me.”
“Don’t you realize that this is a wildly inappropriate place to do this?”
“Cheers, Harry,” said Sam, and they went to find a table, though Draco remained by Harry’s side.
“You know it’s the right thing, Harry,” said Ginny firmly but not unkindly.
He was driving Harry mad with all this teasing, this faux-innocence. Harry needed him to do
“Oh, shut it, Blaise,” Pansy said, but she was smiling.
to you now?”
For a moment, Draco thought Harry was going to fight him right there at breakfast, but then he looked away and Draco breathed a sigh of relief.
Harry looked over at Kathy, attempting to be casual, as if this sort of thing happened every day. Of course, it didn’t, and Harry’s heart was pounding in his ears and his cheeks were burning but he still pretended that everything was Fine. He crossed his arms and waited for Kathy to speak. Mercifully, at this moment in time, she glanced at her phone before pocketing it and beamed at the group.
The bartender approached and set down two Old Fashioneds.
He turned away from the window, and Ginny, beautiful Ginny, had tears running down her face.
He remembered how his panic had resumed as soon as he’d gotten back to his room, and how he spent a good fifteen minutes trying to remember how to breathe. He stayed in there until Pansy and Blaise had come to drag him out to lunch. That was a day ago, and Draco still wasn’t sure what to make of the whole exchange.
Draco’s throat was sore.
I had almost killed two people by that time – all while I was plotting to kill someone else entirely,” Draco pointed out.
“Speak of the devil,” Astoria said lowly and nodded her head at the two figures coming towards them.
Draco barely managed to hold a laugh down. He’s heard Leo talk a lot about himself over the years.
No, that was mental. He knew that. How would he even get home? He wasn’t even sure how he’d gotten to St. Mungo’s in the first place. He had no memory of that night, and it wasn’t uncommon. Blacking out was easy when you mixed benzos and alcohol, which Harry had learned for the first time over a year ago.
“He left right before you came in,” answered Harry.
“It’s been years, Harry,” Hermione said. “It doesn’t even matter anymore. Blaise is perfectly fine, he’s clever and makes Ginny happy –”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked before Draco could respond.
Draco reluctantly got out of bed and went to take a shower.
Working as quickly as he could, he wrote down what he’d observed since Potter had come in. He wrote down the symptoms Potter had suffered, when he’d had them, and to what degree. He wrote about Leonel and him preforming the cleansing procedure and its effects on Potter. He described how Potter would be seeing Dr. Wolff as a Mind Healer, and how Potter would most likely soon be released. He wrote and wrote and wrote, hoping it would be up to Mitchell’s high standards.
Draco nodded. He knew he never would.
“Calmer,” Harry said truthfully. He stared at the water droplets on his glass as he spoke. “I’m just…embarrassed, mostly. I hate hurting Ginny like that, just knowing I’ve done that, making her so upset, it’s...”
“Not by choice, I promise you.”
Draco resisted the urge to pull his hair out.
The sharp smell of liquor filled Harry’s nostrils, and he had to stop himself from breathing in deep. He watched, throat parched, as Ginny unscrewed each bottle, held it ceremoniously in front of her, and let the liquid inside pour cleanly into the toilet. Harry wondered vaguely what Ginny would do if he swiped one from right in front of her and ran away. He shuddered.
“But I’m so tired,” complained Harry.
Ginny’s face fell.
“Ginny, Neville, and a whole group of fifth years. So it could be worse, I think.”
Draco tried not to look too pleased with himself. “Well get used to it, Potter. I carry the unique burden of having enough common sense for the two of us.”
Draco was looking through his notes again when there was a brisk knock at the door.
“What
“How the
“So,” Potter said.
“Your first magical friend, you mean.”
“Have you considered picking up a new hobby, or perhaps returning to an old one?”
"Yes," Potter said. "And you had been until I took your wand at the Manor. That reminds me…"
“What are you staring at me for then?”
Accidentally revealing that you're used to throwing up while drunk >>>>>>>
Draco let out a surprised laugh.
“Is Blaise going?”
the nicest patient I’ve had in a while.”
Potter’s expression was indiscernible and Draco wanted to disappear, but then he finally said, “Thanks, Malfoy.”
Harry’s face softened. He smiled.
He watched as Draco blinked and said, “You’re certain?”
“You don’t like it?” came Draco’s silky voice.
He looked down at his shaky hands, fingers too sausage-like for his liking and the knuckles of his left index and middle fingers littered with shiny white scars.
Draco went into work early, figuring there was nothing else to do. He had downed two cups of coffee at home, hoping to mitigate the effects of the five hours of sleep he’d had, but headed to the employee lounge for another. Fortunately, there was no one in the lounge; it was early yet.
“It’s – it’s different!”
“No, I can’t say that I have.”
“Did it, er…did Snape…?”
They made their way to Potter’s room. Draco lightly knocked on the door before opening the door and peering in. Potter looked about the same as he did yesterday, though perhaps he had some more color in his face. Draco let Ira in.
Leonel smiled a bit. “Yeah, of course. My bad.”
“It’s fine, Draco,” Hermione said, standing up from Harry’s bed. “Should we leave?”
But Harry couldn’t get anything else out but a gasp as Draco took that moment to enter, his cock finally pushing into Harry. He clawed at the sheets and bit his lip, stopping the moan that threatened to escape his throat. He could imagine Draco’s face, haughty and pleased and flushed and Harry looked and
Harry's curiosity was piqued, but he decided on another avenue of attack.
It was three years later when he truly understood what his parents had been speaking about. It was the day he realized what he’d been thinking when he looked at other boys and just how wrong it was. He felt dirty and shameful, like he’d let his parents down again.
“I was twenty-two when I first went to see her. And I’d only stopped going about a year ago.”
Taking several deep breaths, Harry drew the Cloak over himself. He ensured he was fully covered before opening the door a crack. He peeked outside and saw a rather slow flow of human traffic in the corridor. Still, there were people talking and laughing and existing out there, and enough so that Harry's palms started to get damp.
Harry lowered his hand and opened his eyes partially, squinting at the slightly blurry figure in front of him. They were walking forward with arms extended towards him, like they were going to grab him.
"That's a brilliant idea. Ignore the Healers who are in charge of you."
Draco cast the spell, and relief washed over Harry’s features as he examined himself once more. Harry looked up, his mouth open to speak, when his eyes landed on Draco’s wand.
His face was flushed a light pink, his hair falling in his eyes and forehead slightly damp.
“All the same, he’s very strange.”
"What's the point of it all?" she asked after a tense silence.
He was there ten minutes before Harry showed up. Harry might have shown up earlier, truthfully, as Draco didn’t even notice his presence until he sat down next to him. Draco looked over in surprise, but didn’t say anything. It wasn’t often that he saw Harry so upset.
They’d come so far since that night.
The tightness in his chest only increased as he got closer and as Malfoy came into view. He looked incredible, beyond handsome in a crisp grey button-up and black slacks. His face was turned away towards the window, granting Harry a look at his profile; the long, straight nose, sharp jawline, and the smooth, pale expanse of his neck…
rude, I’m sorry.”
the Blacks didn’t keep a VCR in their sitting room,” he said, nodding his head towards the dusty VCR that indeed sat underneath an outdated television.
“You really think she can help me?” Potter asked, the harsh tone of voice gone.
“No.”
was sitting at the Gryffindor table with Weasley and Granger. Harry had insisted that if they were to be kissing, Draco had to call him by his given name. Draco agreed, of course. It felt strange to say it, but he figured he would get used to it soon enough.
“They’re not – never mind,” Potter scowled. He paused, then tried again. “I’m not hungry.”
,” Draco was hardly aware of what he was saying. “Harry, Harry, this is, I can’t-“
When Draco met Blaise and Ginevra that night, he was reminded of just how alone he felt sometimes.
“Let’s just keep walking. Sorry,” Harry apologized again and resumed walking without waiting for Draco.
“Great.”
“What – were you an alcoholic?”
Draco nodded.
Pansy frowned at him, while Daphne just seemed to be waiting for them to leave so she could continue on with her conversation.
“Understand what?” Draco asked hesitantly.
Potter stared at him for a moment, as if trying to figure him out.
He dropped down beside her. Astoria scooched closer.
nice.”
The best of it was that Harry would never even find out. There was no evidence – all he would think was that Draco was also in his dormitory preparing for Blaise's return.
Ginny rubbed small circles into Harry’s back as he cried and shuddered against her.
An hour later there was a knock.
been having trouble sleeping, haven’t you?”
Slowly and carefully, he gathered his materials, still splayed out around him, and placed them back in his bag. Once he was done, Draco drew back the curtains and left his bed begrudgingly.
Breathing out slowly, he got a spoonful of soup (just a few lentils) and brought it up to his mouth. He swallowed it quickly, not wanting to think about how he’d been strong-armed into breaking his fast by Harry bloody Potter.
“Exactly.”
“No time for haircuts, then?” Draco asked, eyeing Harry’s hair with a smile.
“I’ll drink if you will, Draco,” Astoria said, though she was already pouring herself some eggnog.
Jesus christ, it's a miracle! Sorry I'm the worst and thank you for reading <3
“Blaise is going back to New Zealand tonight and I wanted you two to properly meet,” Ginny explained, her voice firm. “You’re both very important to me and I can’t have the two of you at each other’s throats forever.”
“Something about you,” Draco said, his voice low, “Makes me lose all of my senses. Ever since the beginning, you’ve blinded me.”
“Very grown up.”
“Oh, sorry, Draco! We didn’t mean to startle you,” Granger said apologetically. “We were just waiting to talk to Harry.”
"Well I dunno -" Harry sputtered defensively.
“Alright,” Draco said.
“And it just started this morning?” he asked, ready to write the answer down.
“Is that – Salazar!” She let out a loud laugh. “I reckon anything’s possible nowadays.”
Draco was heating the cauldron and running through the list of instructions when Potter returned. Draco barely acknowledged him as he began picking through the ingredients to find the ones he needed first. He could feel Potter watching him as he worked, making him even tenser than he was before. He desperately hoped he wouldn’t muck it up; embarrassing himself in front of Potter was the last thing he needed. He’d already spent much too long humiliating himself.
“I haven’t seen her drink
When the door clicked shut, Harry turned and stared at Malfoy, his face still feeling hot. Malfoy stared back, his arms crossed and face flushed a pale pink.
He picked up a slice of pepperoni and tried to make it seem like he wasn’t concentrating too hard on doing so. Even so, he could feel Ginny watching him as he took a bite, so he looked over at her after he’d finished swallowing.
“Oh!” squeaked Hermione.
So he did remember. Draco’s heartbeat picked up in anticipation.
know that, but they certainly don’t! I’m assuming you haven’t told them about me? The fact that we’re even friends?”
She caught up to him a few paces, Weasley behind her.
“It didn’t do anything,” Draco continued, his voice fainter. “It bled, but when it healed, it healed completely. There weren’t any scars left over to show what I did. I tried several times, but it couldn’t be changed. So I thought I had to live with it. I kept it covered all the time. I was ashamed and angry and I felt ill every time I looked at it and so finally I just figured I’d distract myself from it. If I couldn’t get rid of it, replace it. So I did. Life…creation, over death.” He flushed a little bit, and lowered his bare arm. “It’s ludicrous, but there you have it.”
Red. It was very red. It’s exactly what he should have expected. Typical Gryffindors.
of all people isn’t as torturous as it is with others.”
“I wanted to,” Kathy reassured. “Now, Samuel, if you’d like to start, please go ahead.”
Harry tried to focus on them too, but his mind was too busy trying to work Malfoy out.
“Twice, I reckon,” Potter grumbled, opening his eyes to squint at Draco. “This is meant to be me healing, yeah?”
“Yes,” Draco said. “I’d feel much better about it that way.”
He found it underneath an old mug of coffee, slightly stained and crumpled. Draco withdrew the newspaper and flipped through it until he’d located the article he had only skimmed through before.
“Oh, Draco. Did you really think I was going to disapprove? Like I’d be so tactless,” she scoffed. “As much as we like to say we’re more advanced than the Muggles, they’ve certainly figured out sexuality far sooner than us. We as a society are so behind, Draco, but not me. You have nothing to worry about.”
And then something occurred to him: Ginny was gone. She wasn’t here. Harry had his wand, his money, and…
“Then I like it,” she said.
“Mr. Potter, please!” one of them said, pulling Harry away from Malfoy and pushing him back towards the bed with the help of the second individual.
“Why are you bleeding?” Potter asked again.
, so different. Even if he was absolutely freezing, it was worth it.
“If I were to believe what Ms. Skeeter has written, I would think that you and Healer Malfoy have had a turbulent relationship ever since you were children.”
“What, you haven’t fucked anyone in a year?”
It was bright. That was his first impression. His second was that the room was quite small, especially for the amount of people that was crammed into it. Most of them were already sitting down, making small talk with those around them. Others were standing around a plain, rectangular table that was topped with a box of donuts, Styrofoam cups, and a rather outdated coffee maker.
Ginny appeared to make sense of this concept for a moment before giving up.
Draco chose to wear Muggle clothes despite the fact that they were going to the Leaky; he’d been in robes long enough today. He Apparated outside the pub at eight o’clock exactly and headed inside, immediately on the lookout for his three coworkers.
“Lie back down,” Harry said softly, those remarkable eyes shining up at him.
“I know. Thanks, Ginny.”
“You're one to talk.”
"I'll call Hermione over here," she threatened, "And Merlin bless her, she'll chain you to the bed if it came to it."
“Just one thing, then,” Potter said quickly, and before Draco could object, he continued speaking, “I never actually apologized for the, er, what happened in Myrtle’s bathroom. I’m really sorry. I swear I didn’t know what the curse did, and if I did, I
Weasley nodded and stood up, extending a hand down to Granger. She seemed more reluctant to leave, electing instead to grip Potter’s hand tighter.
Potter advanced on Draco, stopping until his nose was only a few centimeters away from Draco's own.
“Potter? What do you mean?”
“I was worse when I woke up, I promise you,” said Potter. “I’m surprised I’m out of bed.”
“Compared to every other ex-Death Eater,” Ginny said. She took a long sip of her tea. “He’s gone all mysterious. He’s barely seen in our world, he’s elusive, and he’s finally grown into that pointy face of his.”
, damn the trials and how highly publicized they were, damn the Dark Lord, and most of all, damn himself.
Harry nodded.
He didn’t know why Harry would trust him of all people, but he believed him somehow.
Draco knocked on the door with a bit too much force.
your girlfriend, wasn’t she?”
be good.
"Malfoy," Harry answered. He paused, then said, "But I reckon it can apply to Estrada as well."
“I never asked for this. And besides, it’s a bloody stupid thing to be famous for, not dying when you were a baby, and then killing your dead parents’ murderer.”
Harry shot him a look as if to say ‘look who’s talking’ but kept going.
“You didn’t,” Harry said quickly, putting his hands on Draco’s arms. Draco looked unconvinced. “If I didn’t want to talk about it, I wouldn’t have. I'm stubborn, remember?”
Wolff nodded.
Leo ducked his head. "Sorry."
"So you're saying you haven't read it?" Harry challenged.
“I’m sorry for – today, for being so-” Draco couldn’t even find a word to fit his ever-changing moods, his temper, his aggression. He didn’t even know if he was making sense, he was so exhausted.
This was apparently not what Ira had expected, because the smirk on their face fell. They took their long legs off the desk and looked at Draco curiously.
“You’ve thought this through many times, haven’t you?” asked Ginny, and when Harry turned to glare at her, she sighed and put a hand on his shoulder. “It’ll be fine, Harry. This might be how Malfoy invites all his friends out to dinner. No ulterior motives.”
Harry worried his lip, hesitating before nodding rigidly.
“Harry, I swear to Merlin I’ll kill you if you’ve been talking about Draco sodding Malfoy this entire time,” Ginny said lowly.
“Oh, come on, Harry. You know he’s an alright bloke now. I don’t think he’s purposefully leading you on. I really don’t.”
“Yeah…that’s it.”
“I can’t believe Malfoy went to a Mind-Healer. And recommended the one
Once inside, they sat on Harry’s floor (Draco gingerly pushed a suspicious sock away with his shoe) across from each other.
Excitement tentatively bubbled up in him.
Harry tried to think of something to say. He rubbed at his jaw.
Potter looked at him strangely, opened his mouth, and shut it.
"That's fine, Draco,” Potter said, his voice becoming softer. He looked down at the parchment and asked tentatively, “Are you sure you trust me with this?"
"I dunno, I mean – wouldn’t it be fun?"
, Leo…”
Draco was trembling by the time he reached Potter's dormitory, letter in his hand. They haven’t spoken since their fight in Draco’s dorm two days ago; Potter had barely looked at him since then.
Draco nodded, feeling entirely insufficient. Harry ran a hand through his hair. He looked so exhausted – the kind that went past not getting enough sleep.
Not that Harry was shallow. But also, who could blame him for lusting after his Healer when he looked like
“Yeah?”
. Good. Harry felt at peace with Draco Malfoy curled up against him, bony limbs and pointy chin and all.
"It's so early," Potter groaned, and Draco made to apologize but Potter just stepped back and waved him in.
He’d write back about his studies, Pansy, and the weather. He didn’t feel the need to write about how useless it all seemed. About how even if he did graduate from Hogwarts, he’d only be seen for what he was. Is. A dirty Death Eater who only sided with the right side when it was convenient.
“And I’ll miss sleeping next you, even with your ice-cold feet,” he returned, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist.
Hermione looked apologetic, Ron frustrated, Malfoy surprised, and the American Healer (what was his name?) was simply stunned.
certain about one thing.
Now it was Draco’s turn to be surprised.
“It’s good to see you.”
“I see.”
But now, Potter wouldn’t say a word to him. He would barely even
“I promise I won’t get in a bar fight with Malfoy if he does come,” Harry said.
“Long week?”
“If you say so,” Draco said, though he wasn’t convinced.
“You did. You saved me.”
have been you. Don’t sell yourself short.”
"You're just - ill."
“I know I shouldn’t still be doing it,” Harry said. He turned to face Draco. “It doesn’t happen that often anymore. It just…when I get overwhelmed…”
“Thanks, mate,” Ron grinned, clapping him on the back.
Potter took a deep breath and closed his eyes a moment.
Conversation was slowly dying down. Kathy had made her way over to the circle and sat herself down a few seats away from Harry. She picked up a clipboard and pen from underneath her seat and set them down in her lap.
After staring at it for a good minute, Draco washed his hands and face, rinsed his mouth three times, and looked at himself again.
Draco frowned; something was definitely off.
“Excellent, thank you,” said Malfoy, sliding it into the folder. He then withdrew another piece of parchment. “This is a contract stating that you will see Mind Healer Julia Wolff once a week until she sees fit to release you. If you miss an appointment and fail to contact her within 24 hours, staff at the Potions and Plant Department are authorized to visit your place of residence in an effort to locate you.”
“Just wanted to make sure you weren’t overworking yourself, though you obviously are.”
“No, I’m sorry,” Draco said, turning toward her fully. “I was too harsh, and you know how much of an arse I can be. And I know you worry, and it means a lot to me, to know how much you care, but I know I’m right about this.”
Harry’s expression turned somber. “I wish it wasn’t. Draco, you’re so handsome and funny and clever and your hair is so
“Well, let’s get this over with,” Harry said, choosing to stare at his hands instead of Malfoy’s annoying piteous face. “What do you want to know?”
“I’m always anxious, Healer.”
“It’s not like you’re being very discreet.”
“That may be true,” she said slowly, “But he was still so awful to us – all of us – even before he became a Death Eater.”
And sure enough, there he was, dressed in a plain white shirt and dark sweatpants.
bad, thank Merlin, but it worried Draco all the same. Sometimes, he even caught Betty looking at him with almost reproachfully, which might’ve been the worst part about it. She’s never regarded Draco with anything other than admiration or slight fear before.
“Is this being all, sir?”
going to stop me?”
"What types of substances?"
Their relationship officially ended half a year after that, but he often wondered how long it had been dead before then. He wasn’t a proper boyfriend; he hadn’t been since the first six months of the revival of their relationship. Ginny was too kind, too loving, and most of all, much too good for Harry, and he had to let her go.
Draco and Harry watched as the pair stumbled away and listened for the
“Hey, Harry, I know it’s a Wednesday night, but I wanted to know if you’d be interested in having a few drinks,” Damien said uncertainly, “Y’know, for Sam’s birthday.”
"Yeah, me too. And I'm well aware, thanks."
Harry turned in bed, switching to his other side, and tried to go back to sleep. He knew from the moment he'd opened his eyes, however, that he wouldn't be able to sleep again that morning. Regardless, he lay there for ten minutes with his eyes closed, his mind jumping from thought to thought, one remaining dominant.
," Harry repeated it word-for-word. The sentence seemed to be ingrained in his brain.
anything?”
They lapsed into a comfortable silence, enjoying the quiet and each other’s company (although Draco couldn’t speak for Potter, he somehow didn’t think it was a far-fetched assumption). Suddenly, the sound of Weasley’s voice carried from inside the Room out onto the balcony. It sounded like he was drunkenly calling for Potter.
“Great. Trainee Burke should be back in a second with that potion,” Estrada smiled. “And be sure to eat your breakfast, Mr. Potter. Your body needs the nutrients and energy.”
Draco gave a humorless laugh. “For once, Pansy would agree with them.”
It took him a second to remember what she was talking about, or rather, what he was talking about.
“Yes.”
This was different. Potter hadn't starred in any of his dreams ever since he was eighteen.
Ginny, instead of sitting up and making space, laid her feet across Harry’s lap and smiled at him.
She was frowning, and Draco nodded.
It was a few minutes before Draco had calmed down enough to pull away and wipe his face dry. Potter’s eyes were intense as he watched Draco, making Draco even more uncomfortable than he already was. He cleared his throat.
“Just, er, take care of yourself, Malfoy.”
“Yeah?” Malfoy’s voice was barely above a whisper.
Final exams were approaching quickly; professors and students alike were on edge, anxious about how much material there was left to cover before term ended. Draco wasn’t too worried; although his grades weren’t as good as they were in the past (shockingly enough, good mental health was essential to do well in school), he had always been good at revising.
Astoria rolled her eyes but didn’t respond.
“So,” said Harry as he pulled away. He smiled at Draco, enraptured by the soft look in his eyes. “What do you want to do today?”
“Well, Kathy’s the facilitator of group, not you,” said Malfoy before Harry could reply, “So I’m afraid I won’t be following your advice.”
Harry gathered his clothes and stuffed them in the bag, which he then tied tightly. He made his way back to the bed, dropping the bag next to the sick bucket as he sat down. A headache was coming on, and though he’d like to sleep it off, he already knew that he wouldn’t be able to. He settled into bed regardless.
He began to walk away, heading in the direction of the eighth-year dorms. Astoria followed him and caught up, coming to walk by his side.
charm.
Harry obeyed, following Malfoy as they weaved through the crowd. Finally, they made it to the exit and Malfoy released him once they were outside. Still a little overwhelmed, Harry took a deep breath. The fresh air was soothing on his skin and a good change from pub air. He glanced at Malfoy, who seemed to be doing the same.
,” growled Draco. “Merlin, Potter, I never would have thought you’d be so self-deprecating. Where’s the Harry Potter who walked around Hogwarts like he owned the place?”
For a second, it looked like Hermione was going to say something. She decided against it, however, and simply sighed.
, he thought stubbornly. But in terms of Malfoy not even needing help…he didn’t feel as strongly about that as he had this morning. There’s all sorts of trauma, isn’t there?
Estrada frowned. “Have you been perspiring more than usual?”
“Is everything alright?” Draco asked slowly, turning to face Harry.
Potter brushed him off. “It’s the truth.”
Harry shook his head.
“What’s wrong, Harry?” Ginny asked, mild concern in her eyes. “Just say whatever you need to say. I’m here.”
“Sorry!” Granger said shrilly. She grabbed Weasley’s arm and pulled. “Come on, Ron, I don’t think it’s here, we can try again tomorrow, let’s go…”
Harry’s eyes flashed to Ginny immediately, silently asking her why in the hell she’d brought him here.
” Malfoy cut across him sternly, his face twitching momentarily from its usual expressionlessness, “You do. The first step is acceptance, Potter, and you’ll soon complete it.”
“I was afraid that you’d change your mind,” Draco admitted against better judgement. “I thought maybe…I don’t know.”
“No, I’m just sort of dizzy. Since when?” Harry asked, unable to make sense of what was happening.
Ira looked horrified. “Merlin, no. Rodgers is a complete wet blanket. I don’t think the man could have fun even if he had a wand at his throat.”
“Hm,” said Harry, his fingers itching for them. His heart jumped to his throat as Ginny began to try to open one of the containers. “I – do you – I mean, we don’t need to
“You were a kid. You were manipulated, same as me,” Harry exhaled through his nose. “Trust me when I say that I want to be with you. You’ve changed, Draco.”
And so without a job, without Ginny, and without dreamless sleep, Harry found other ways to live. It wasn’t always ideal, he knew, but still. He was breathing.
when he was probably thinking about how to murder the thing before him. How dare his dirty shirt cling to his body in the most terrible way, unintentionally revealing how the past year had changed him. How dare he.
“Er, we’re trying to be civil…” Harry said, though he didn’t seem very sure of it himself. Why wasn’t Malfoy saying anything?
Potter turned to look at him. “Really?”
"It's the nature of his recovery," Malfoy responded, "And his illness. And his being, if I'm being completely honest."
“So are you,” Ginny countered.
“It’s not, Draco,” Leonel interrupted. “It makes total sense that being there brings back painful memories.”
“Yeah, I know,” he replied. “I just – I dunno, would’ve liked a warning before barging in here.”
“Brilliant,” Draco said, relieved. “I’ll be taking my leave, then.”
But it all suited him.
He opened his eyes and took a deep breath. Just thinking of it – envisioning cutting careful lines and putting his nose to the table – made him yearn for it.
“Yeah,” Draco said, glad Harry decided to play along instead of getting bristly. “Not a word for ages and then he just drops the old ‘want to meet up?’ one day, like he thinks I’ll drop everything for him.”
“Secondly, Harry,” Hermione said clearly, her voice high, “Since when have you and Malfoy been, um, boyfriends?”
“Lovegood?”
Harry led Draco back to his lips and his own hand to Draco’s hard cock, stroking through the cloth (which was in fact, Harry’s own pair of briefs). Draco tensed and kissed harder, the hand on Harry’s bicep gripping tighter. Harry dipped his hand into Draco’s pants and grasped it, making Draco gasp softly. God, he was so hot.
“Do you know how long he’s been going?”
“Sorry, it’s just me – “ Draco stopped and huffed out a frustrated breath. “It’s me putting my Healer hat on again. Overthinking things. Worrying about things,” Draco emphasized, hoping Harry would understand.
ed her own hair with disastrous results. Draco’s mind drifted. Just half a year ago, they were in a war. People had
“It’s just – I have no reason to be angry, but I am. And it happens in a split second, and I know the people I lash out at don’t deserve it, but I still can’t stop myself. I feel like I’m pushing everyone away, which is ironic since realistically, I’ve been pushing my friends away for the past few years. And they’re still here, for some reason.”
“Fine,” he replied.
Harry glanced worriedly at the window facing out the hallway. White walked over and shut the blinds.
the Black house, after all.”
He knew it wasn't permanent - recovery isn't linear, after all - but he also knew that this was a life he wanted to live.
“You’re making both of us sound like perverts,” Draco said, Potter now looking as flustered as he felt.
“What?”
“Who’s the emergency contact listed on the Ministry records?”
Draco leant down to place careful kisses on Harry’s mouth, jawline, neck, his heart racing underneath his chest.
“Well, er,” Harry stammered, wanting to break the silence, “Thanks, I ‘spose. Um…right. Bye.”
“Have you tried talking to your mother about meeting each other outside of the house?” Kathy asked.
He took a breath, trying to calm himself down. It didn't work.
“You already know the answer to that. You begged me to meet the visionary Hermione Granger a few times, remember?”
An update! Sorry I took so long. Partly written to Fergie's iconic "The Dutchess." Enjoy
Draco did, and when Harry closed the door, he pulled off the Cloak and handed it to Harry.
“No,” Draco snapped immediately, cutting Potter short. Fueled only by his anger and embarrassment, Draco stood up. He wavered for a second. “I’m fine, Potter. Fuck off.”
He stopped to look at her. “No, it wasn’t. Thanks for bringing me, Pansy.”
“Of course, Potter,” said Malfoy. “I’ll return in a few hours, but if you need anything sooner, let us know.”
“But I never even – “
“I think they’re at the foot of the bed,” said Draco.
“I’m not certain if I’d
At the sound of a throat clearing, Draco looked up from his parchment to see Harry leaning against a chair, bag over his shoulder and a small smile on his face. He looked a bit more well-rested than he did this morning, slightly easing the anxiety that had been gripping Draco throughout the day.
Draco leant against the doorway leading from the entry hall into the living room. He didn’t even try to look.
Draco put on his clothes carefully and combed his hair. It was good enough, he thought as he examined himself in the mirror. As good as it was going to get, anyway.
Ginny, who sat in front of Blaise unseen, grinned and shot Harry a thumbs up.
“He could have
"What, like Stockholm Syndrome?"
“You did what you did because the situation was forced upon you,” Ira argued. “You didn’t hunt Mr. Potter down and demand that he join you for a mid-morning coffee date. You listened to what he was saying and helped him out. Sure, the outcome may have been a bit different if it wasn’t Mr. Potter, but I don’t think your actions were out of bounds. Not by a long shot.”
What worried him more was the upcoming winter holidays. He wasn’t sure if he should go home or stay at Hogwarts. The Manor didn’t feel the same after the Dark Lord had occupied it; Draco didn’t know if it ever would. It was harder to forget the war when he was there, harder to shake off the nightmares, harder to feel like there was a point to living.
Malfoy smirked and took a sip, but his cool demeanor disappeared once he’d grimaced.
“You adore us, Draco,” Ira added.
He trailed off, unsure of what to say. Kathy smiled at him encouragingly.
Draco continued to guide him, now thrusting his hips forward in time with the rest of their movements.
Draco thought he looked cute, all disheveled and grumpy. He bit down a smile. Harry cocked his head.
“Or you’ll what?” Weasley interrupted. “Your
“What?”
And maybe he was happy to know he’d still be in Malfoy’s presence.
It was a mark of how famous the man was when Wolff's eyes widened.
“You alright?”
“You’re telling me – hold on, you’ve got to back up. I thought you were just performing sinful acts in loos. When did that become

He was seething. Harry squeezed Draco’s hand.
awake?”
Potter looked amused before quickly turning serious.
“No, you don’t understand, Draco, that was – was unlike anything I’ve ever felt,” Harry said breathlessly, a wide smile on his face.
“I’m very proud of you, Draco,” said Kathy in a way that wasn’t patronizing.
Perhaps it was his imagination, but Wolff responded by asking, “Or is
“Salazar, do you think she knows?” Pansy asked, scandalized.
“What?” Draco snapped, though he had no right to. He felt his face warm but he tilted his chin up defensively all the same.
He hadn’t had any contact with Potter since that day in Potions, save for the occasional glance across the Great Hall or a classroom.
“This is stupid,” he said heatedly instead. “
“If I remember correctly, you certainly weren’t bad at Potions in sixth year,” Draco said, his attention back on his hands.
“Erm…” Samuel glanced over at Harry, unsure. Harry gave a noncommittal shrug.
“Sorry, I have to – “ Draco said, not even bothering to finish before he stood and began to hurry out the common room.
“Yeah. Leave me alone.”
“Blaise…?”
“Yeah,” he said lowly, stepping closer so they were now only a foot apart. “I’d miss it.”
Potter flinched, just slightly. Draco would have missed it if he blinked. It felt like a dagger was slowly being wedged into his heart, and he only had himself to blame.
"The war's affected all of us, Harry."
Malfoy stepped closer and drew his wand. “I’m going to check your vitals now.” And he did so, staring with great intensity at the numbers and lines and then scribbling his observations onto his paper.
“I’m sure you don’t really think that,” Draco said weakly.
He glanced over at Harry, whose cheeks warmed as he swiftly looked down at the floor.
“I don’t hate you,” Potter said, and Draco almost believed him. “You saved my life. Your mother – “
While this was becoming true again, he couldn’t forget how shut down Harry was just a few months ago. He was like a hollow shell of himself, never smiling, always with empty eyes. Draco shuddered, appreciating how

“Your shirt,” Draco murmured.
“Yes, that’s usually how one sustains themselves in this day and age. Not all of us can just lay about and depend on our inheritance.” Draco answered, his gentle tone gone as quick as it came.
He did.
It’s been five days since that night, and Potter hadn’t cornered him since. Draco had almost come to expect it, to see Potter’s stupid, worried face after coming into the eighth-year dormitories or leaving the Great Hall or the bathroom.
“Good.”
Harry shrugged. “You can if you want.”
It was all inadequate.
“I know, Draco,” Ira replied. “No need to kick up a fuss. We were just recounting all the times either one of us had walked in on you two –“
"Good?"
He buried his head in his hands. In and out. His chest was growing increasingly tight and he felt ill and he
“I need to –,” his voice came out wobbly. He cleared his throat and continued – the last thing he needed was to cry in front of a Trainee Healer. “I need to talk to Ginny.”
didn’t know what it meant.
"The source?" Harry asked in disbelief. "What does that even mean?"
Harry turned to look at him, that smile still on his face. He kissed Draco again, on the lips this time, and Draco kissed back hungrily, as tired as he was. They parted, and Harry stared at Draco a moment, then grinned.
“I mean, you’ve never cared about me before, so why would you now?” Draco’s heart was pounding and he hated how intensely Potter was staring at him.
Satisfied, Draco stuck his wand in his pocket and opened his door. He was immediately welcomed by the slightly interested (or rather interested, by their standards) face of Ira White. Ira, head of the Aletta Wellensly ward of the same department, was lanky, as blond as Draco, and genderfluid.
“Wha-?”
“You look brilliant,” Harry said, clearing his throat and grinning shyly.
“I’m responsible for myself. You aren’t,” Harry countered. He tentatively reached out to touch Draco’s face. “Is that a yes?”
"I dunno, the chance just never came up. I'm obviously clothed when I leave the house, and much as I love Ron and Hermione, I'm not about to randomly strip and force them to look at something like that."
you.”
“I’d be offended if it wasn’t.”
Harry nodded, unable to break eye contact even though he wanted to. He didn’t deserve friends like them. He wanted to say something to them – everything he’d said so far was inadequate – and he opened his mouth only to shut it again.
wanted to leave St. Mungo’s and take a walk like he said he did, he would have to build up the strength for it, both mentally and physically.
“Harry,” Draco said, trying not to groan, “Just do it. Even if you’re terrible, it’ll be phenomenal – I assure you.”
his addiction. Or at least if felt like he was.
all flustered, Draco?” came a silky voice from behind them.
Ginny raised an eyebrow but didn’t say anything else. She walked closer and peered into the bag.
“Fine,” Harry accepted. “You just wait, Malfoy. I’ll prove it to you.”
Malfoy stared at him for a bit longer before sticking a hand in his robes and pulling out a plain, overstuffed file folder – his files. Harry looked at them with curiosity, wondering what sort of information Malfoy had on him. It was a bit unsettling, to be honest, to know that such a gigantic prat had that much power over him.
“Fuck,” Harry muttered against Draco’s lips.
“A bit – er, not the best,” he said, and when Ginny gave him a look, he continued, “Hermione found us in bed.”
“And how long ago was this?”
“Obviously, stopping the intake of all of these drugs would be the opposite of beneficial, so we’ve been cleansing your bloodstream of all the alcohol and potions that are present in this moment. It won’t take away years of damage, but it
“I’m so embarrassed,” Harry finally mumbled, ending their staring match.
“Thank you,” Draco said quietly, giving Harry’s hand a light squeeze.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So I can’t care, right? I can’t remember. I’ve got to pretend everything’s normal and fine and this is just another year at Hogwarts even though this entire castle is a giant graveyard. It’s just…wrong. And I needed fresh air, and this seemed like a good idea at the time, but I was obviously wrong, so I’ll just-”
Wolff's caramel eyes softened. "Yes, unfortunately."
, his mind supplied helpfully.
Blaise was standing there, casually buttoning up his spotless, creaseless shirt.
“Why here?”
“What? What is it?”
Ira waved a hand dismissively. "You know I love gossip, Draco. And you already know most of this is going to Betty."
“She’s drunk herself silly already,” Daphne said fondly, though her speech was slightly slurred as well.
"You have a few already, don't worry."
Ginny pursed her lips, walking closer with one hand tapping her chin thoughtfully. She then reached out and touched the fabric of Harry’s jumper, a nice one he’d dug out from the back of his closest.
“Yes,” Draco said, forcing his voice to be normal. “It’s still set for the day after tomorrow at 10.”
Potter’s brow furrowed. “Everyone’s here.”
Harry nibbled at his bottom lip, wondering if he really
Ginny grabbed his face a touch too forcefully than he would've liked and made him look at her. Her eyes were harsh and cold.
When Draco saw Potter next, it was in the Great Hall, ironically enough. He stiffened when they made eye contact, and when Potter didn’t look away after several moments, Draco looked down at his plate in embarrassment and defeat.
“Yes,” Malfoy said.
“Yeah?”
“You really are a prat, Malfoy,” said Weasley before Harry could respond. “You’re really just going to leave as soon as you get what you want? I guess you haven’t changed after all - you’re the same selfish bastard you always were.”
Harry’s head snapped up, his vision blurry without glasses. Still, he didn’t need them to know that Draco Malfoy stood several feet behind Ginny, who was kneeling beside Harry.
“It’ll take a bit to get used to,” Ginny agreed.
Harry looked at his reflection in the mirror. It insulted his hair, and his clothes. He glared at the mirror. He’d changed into something that he hadn’t been wearing for the past three days, and he thought that should be enough.
Harry slid his fingers through Draco’s under the table and beamed at the three most important people in his life.
After breakfast, Draco and Harry decided to go outside into the snow. Draco breathed deep, savoring the fresh, cold air. Ever since his first year, the sight of Hogwarts draped in snow gave him a sense of calm. It just looked so
“Yeah!” Harry said. “Go on.”
“He didn’t say anything that might point to the reasoning behind the sudden change in mood?”
He'd never been one to ask for help. All his life, he'd had to deal with nearly everything on his own. He'd spent the first decade of life virtually alone, having to fend for himself against the Dursleys. And then, of course, there was the small bit of news about how he, a teenager at most, had to fight against a mass murderer and his equally murderous cult. He'd become so accustomed to having to survive on his own that he’d never grown out of it.
Draco wiped his mouth with the back of his hand as Harry watched, confused.
"You just," Harry said slowly, his throat dry, "Make it sound so easy."
“What?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Never mind, I loathe you.”
“I thought Hermione was having a laugh when she told me,” Ron added, taking Hermione’s hand. He looked at Harry, a serious expression on his face. “Mate…if you’re happy, then I support you. And come to think of it…you do look a lot better. Even compared to two months ago.”
“You were fighting for your family,” Potter said. “I think that’s noble.”
“I don’t think either of us can forget,” he finally said.
“Likewise,” said Ron.
"Alright, I'll accept your apology. What’s the next step?"
“I’m so glad you’re staying,” Hermione said, her voice wobbly. She made no move to wipe the new tears away, instead staring at Harry with a deep sadness in her eyes. A sharp pain coursed through him; he’d done this to her. “This is the right thing to do.”
“I suppose so,” Draco conceded. He looked at Potter for a moment. “Am I to guess Weasley and Granger are spending some time alone?”
Potter simply smiled. Draco stuck his cigarette in his mouth to wrap it around his neck. He reveled in its warmth, and he took the cig in his hand once more.
“This too,” Draco said, his lips curling upwards as he fingered Harry’s hoodie.
“Alright, maybe I’m being dramatic,” Potter admitted with a frown. “They’ve never said it, but I can tell…they just want to stop talking about it. They want me to get over it like they have. Y’know…move on.”
Potter was alert, wide-eyed and his forehead damp with sweat as he stared at Draco from where he stood in the center of the room.
"To feel...anything. Alive. Scared. Something that's not just complete numbness. Ginny," he said, his heart weighed down, "I can't shake it. The war. It's always with me, and I can tell...there's something wrong with me. Deep down. And it can't be fixed."
“I’m sorry,” Betty apologized, turning to him, her eyes wide. She must've been able to read the dismay on his face. “It’s just that I’m a trainee and I need to let one of my superiors know…”
He nodded gratefully.
“Excellent. And I suppose Miss Weasley will be his most immediate support system?” Scarlett asked, raising her eyebrows.
“Um,” Draco said astutely. “How? I mean – why?”
She was trying and failing to contain the gigantic smile on her face. “Oh, thank you, Harry!”
“Right,” Draco said, still feeling terrible. “Will you, I mean, if you told them that part, don’t you think they’d, well…”
“Thank you.”
, finishing up work, and Flooing home around four. He rolled over to check the wristwatch sitting on his nightstand – it was just past eleven.
“Healer Estrada?”
Damien smiled.
When Draco entered the eighth-year common room, it was Potter who caught his eye first.
Harry threw a bit of pepper at him; Ron dodged it skillfully.
“Er, sure.”
“I’m really embarrassed,” Harry said. He shifted uncomfortably where he stood. “I didn’t mean for that to happen. It just…did.”
He passed Blaise on his way out the door, who simply glanced at him through hooded eyes – if there was ever a ‘night person,’ Blaise would be it – and headed for the bathroom.
He kissed that smart mouth, trying to pass all of his good vibes onto Draco.
“Great, erm, well – should we go?” Harry asked, nervously.
Potter pulled on Draco’s arm again. Draco fought before submitting, letting himself be forced down from the one step he’d climbed and turned to face Potter. He slowly released his grip on Draco.
"Just because you're feeling this…attraction right now doesn't mean it's real. You've been through so much these past two weeks. You need your rest, Harry, and to focus on -"
Harry nodded, seeming to understand. “Of course, Draco.”
“Alright, then, how about an easier question if you can’t answer the other. Are you seeing anyone?”
He’d never heard of “IKEA” before, but he was now a happy and loyal customer.
His classes were over with, he had even revised a bit by some miracle, and was now going to the Owlery to send his mother a letter. He was feeling pretty impressed with himself; it was unusual for him to get so much done in one day.
Draco gave a humorless laugh; Harry’s words caught in his throat.
Draco continued, slowly pumping his finger in and out, trying to loosen Harry up. Merlin, he was tight but then again, why wouldn’t he be?
“I am.”
“I – what?” Harry asked, feeling slow as if he’d been jolted awake.
“Tell me as soon as you’re not.”
Draco woke up late Saturday morning to an apparently empty dorm. He reflected that he had been sleeping much better lately, having been able to sleep for longer amounts of time and with fewer interruptions. Draco laid there with these pleasant revelations for a few minutes before throwing back the curtain that surrounded his bed.
“Honestly, Draco, you’re just helping me out here. I only did that cos you insulted my
and saying they’re
“I’d rather you leave too,” Harry bit out, wiping the wetness away from his face with the heel of his palm. He’d turned his head to the side, not wanting to see Malfoy, or for Malfoy to see him. Still, out of the corner of his eyes, he saw Malfoy come closer. Harry closed them. “Please, Malfoy. Just go.”
. Ira fished out two glasses and set them down too.
“We’re here for you, mate,” he said.
“Hermione and Ron were wondering if they could see you.”
“Two minutes, maybe,” Potter finally answered. “Should I, er, get Madam Po-“
“Well,” Potter said. “That’s frustrating. I guess it was thick of me to think that we could all be mates but I’m still...do they just think we’re dumb for trying?”
“You’ll have to explain it to him,” said Draco. “His knowledge of anything outside of the ‘normal’ orientations is limited.”
“Ron!”
“Oh, is your flatmate still living with you?”
“Someone?” Draco arched a brow.
“Potter, -“ he began again.
“You took a shower,” Ginny commented, a small smile on her face.
Breakfast hadn’t been
“No,” Draco said quickly, looking sideways at her in alarm. “You can’t.”
“Er, bye!” he called, but she had already gone in a flash of bushy hair.
“Alright, I guess,” Harry said noncommittally.
He looked beautiful.
Disgust? Revulsion? Anger?
written about?” Harry said, shaking himself out of his thoughts.
Draco wondered if it was worth the risk to confide in Ira. They were relatively trustworthy, yes, but
“Do you remember third year?” Harry asked Draco.
“I told you,” Draco said softly. “Forget about it.”
“Don’t,” he sighed, screwing his eyes shut. “Don’t do the pity thing. I don’t want it, and I don’t need it.”
“No,” Harry said immediately, and Draco sighed.
As soon as he had slammed the door shut, he ripped the Cloak off and began pacing around the room. His thudding heartbeat vibrated throughout his entire body, his blood boiling and mind racing.
– the mirror that hung on his dresser had shattered. He looked back at Potter, who was gritting his teeth and still staring dangerously at Draco.
“Fucking Malfoy,” cursed Harry under his breath, and then Fucking Malfoy himself entered the room after the briefest of knocks.
“I might what?” she asked sharply.
“Would you…could you come with me?”
“I can’t tell you,” Harry answered, though he desperately wanted to.
As Leonel took plates and forks out of cupboards and drawers, Draco remembered something.
He winced and rubbed at it. “Hello, Blaise. Will we have the pleasure of seeing your plus one more often, then?”
“If it helps, I want you too,” Harry offered in a low voice. “I can’t stop thinking about that night.”
Potter gave a little laugh. “Yeah, well, it wasn’t me.”
“I don’t have the patience for your cute jokes right now, Potter.”
And then he was sobbing. The tears ran faster and heavier down his face and he was gasping for breaths that didn’t come; he clutched onto Potter, who held back just as tightly and didn’t make a sound.
Potter had changed since Draco had last seen him. Some things were the same, of course. His brown skin, those round glasses, but otherwise.
Draco resumed walking but stopped again only ten seconds later. No, the noise
Draco had nearly raced to catch up with her and he’d ended up having to call her name out down the corridor. She stopped at the sound of her name, her head snapping round to identify the source of the sound. When she saw him, she turned around completely, crossing her arms as Draco approached her. He ushered her over to a more secluded spot, and she looked at him expectantly.
“You could have just told me!” Ginny exclaimed.
Harry just stared at him, feeling rather hollow. Draco paused, frowned, then lifted his marked arm, stretching it out towards Harry. He eyed it curiously as he always did.
Draco loved the way his name sounded coming out of Harry’s lips - desperate, pleading, full of need. He held onto this as he slowly put a finger in Harry’s hole. Harry gasped underneath him, and Draco hesitated.
Hermione gave him a one-armed hug and sat down as well. "We're so sorry we haven't been able to visit, Harry."
Draco's cheeks flushed. "It'd been four years since we'd last seen each other. I didn't know what to expect."
Draco smiled warily at her. “Naturally. And where is Blaise?”
“It’s…moved past a friendship. We’ve been dating for about a week now.”
“School,” Harry answered. “We went to school together.”
“Jesus.” Leo rubbed at his eyes, then blinked a few times. “Have you been up long?”
This one made him cringe a little less than the other two, and before he could deliberate more on it, he pressed send.
“They’re powerful, smart, and wealthy. Only a fool would mess with Ira.”
“Yeah, course it is,” Harry said unconvincingly.
“Yes,” Harry breathed. “Yes, yes, yes.”
There was a sudden, crisp knock at the door, and the American Healer entered the room.
“Harry,” George greeted. “It’s good to see you. How’ve you been?”
They both nodded.
Draco tugged on his sleeves and glanced at himself in the mirror.
Draco sat down next to Pansy, who responded by saying, “You never know, Blaise.”
What if someone saw them? He wasn’t ashamed of Harry – no, he was ashamed of himself.
“Careful, Pansy,” Draco drawled, sparing a glance at her. “One might think you’re jealous of the Weaslette.”
He felt a kick underneath the table. It was Astoria, who was raising an eyebrow at him.
He didn’t realize at the time the finality of Potter’s statement. Draco thought that maybe he’d given up for the night, but he’d be back the next day to give him that wounded look and ask him invasive questions. But instead of all that, Potter had just gone back to not interfering in Draco’s life, like he had been at the start of the school year.
Draco nodded, wondering why, wondering if it was true.
“No, no it’s not an escapade,” Harry sputtered. “I swear. Draco, I uh, don’t really know…I mean, what I mean is, it meant more to me than that. You mean more to me…than that.”
Selina Lloyd was a plump, good-natured witch who was brilliant with potions. Draco had always liked her – she treated him kindly even when he’d first started at St. Mungo’s, when he was a pariah of sorts.
He didn't even
She turned and smiled, a shopping basket dangling from her bent arm. “Hello, Harry.”
The next week after group, the same five who went out for Sam’s birthday went out again to the same pub. The walk over was quick, all five of them wanting to get out of the cold as fast as they could.
Harry helped Draco hang up his clothes in his closet. When they finished, they stood back and admired their work.
“You assume correctly,” said Ginevra. “It’s not my place to tell you.”
"I know," he bit his lip, remembering Mrs. Weasley's disappointment when he and Ginny broke up. He'd only just started getting bad then. "But it's not the same. Like, proper family."
“It has,” Harry said truthfully, seeming to surprise both Malfoy and himself by doing so. He hurried to add something to distract from it. “I mean – if she can help a prat like you become less annoying, then she must be alright.”
If Potter could cross his arms any tighter, Draco would have been concerned for his blood circulation.
When Harry entered the room, his eyes fell on Malfoy immediately, and he couldn’t help but think about how nice he looked.
“Yes, Harry!” Her voice came from her bedroom. “Just be a minute!”
“Come on, Potter, chin up. It wasn’t that bad.”
Pansy rolled her eyes and took the cigarette from Draco’s hands. She stood before taking a puff and handing it back down to Draco.
“As well as it could’ve gone,” Harry said with a frown. “They weren’t happy to find out you spent the night – and right under their noses, too - but really, it’s none of their business. I don’t go around demanding to know when
It was around 5 pm the next day when Harry decided he would venture out into the corridors again. With the Invisibility Cloak, of course. It would be busy enough that Harry would be able to walk among other people again, but not so busy that he'd have a panic attack in the middle of it.
“You going to invite me in?” asked Harry in an amused voice.
God, even just thinking the word ‘
“But are you sure you’re alright?” Draco asked again. He took a few more steps until he was half a meter away from Potter. “Aside from the insomnia, is there anything else you’re experiencing?”
He was tense; he didn’t know what to do. Malfoy saved him from having to do anything when he said, “Well. Nice catching up, Potter. And nice to finally meet you, Samuel.”
for a stomach; if he didn’t, it would be concave, only emphasizing  his bony ribs. Thin, raised lines marred his chest, a  souvenir  of his fight with Harry. And worst of all, the Dark Mark on his left forearm. It was faded to a light red , sure, but it still stood out against his pale skin, seeming to scream,
“You were much braver the last time we had this, if I remember correctly.”
the sadness radiating from him. It’s –“
“And I desperately want to move on,” Malfoy continued, his gaze dropping to his cup of coffee. “Holding onto the past and ruminating over it does me no favors, so I
Draco chose not to respond to this particular Owl, so when he heard an insistent tapping on his office window six days later, he thought it’d be Blaise again. When he’d looked up, however, he was greeted by the sight of a Little Owl with stern, white eyebrows instead of the handsome Northern Hawk Owl that belonged to Blaise. Curious, Draco opened his window and allowed the strange owl to hop inside. He took the envelope from the owl and opened it up.
Draco nodded. “Yeah. I was just...I’ve never, well. You know.”
Draco didn’t know what to say. The arguing? The fact that he’s Draco Malfoy? The fact that it was Harry Potter who was kissing him, someone who didn’t even like blokes (to Draco’s knowledge, anyway. Or did he actually? Or was this just an experiment?).
Draco glared at him and Potter laughed. It was a wonderful sound, and Draco basked in it.
“Malfoy?”
“If you say so, Potter.”
him. I don’t think they trust you.”
Draco frowned but obliged, going to Harry’s closet to pick something out.
Weasley’s hard stare had never left Draco; only when Potter began walking did she tear her gaze away and turn her back on the two Slytherins.
, and I got...jealous. Like at a jealous-of-Dean-snogging-you level."
“I don’t regret that,” Draco said firmly, tilting his chin up defensively. “It was the right choice. I can see that now – I meant what I said earlier, Harry; you look well.”
He heard Potter come closer, and out of the corner of his eye, saw him rest his arms against the railing about a foot away from Draco.
Draco felt his neck heat as he scowled and made his way over to the staircase, not wanting to deal with Pansy’s questions and Blaise’s judging looks and Daphne’s…Daphne.
“Take it off,” Harry growled, and Draco obeyed, unzippering his trousers and pushing them down low enough to reveal his high-quality silk pants. Harry gave a short laugh. “You ponce.”
“I’m going to sit down next to you,” Malfoy said quietly in his Healer voice. “Alright?”
It was much less so this time.
"Sod off." Harry rolled his eyes.
He didn’t know when ‘later’ would be, but he knew he’d have to do it eventually. For now, he’d rather face mind-numbing boredom via being cooped up in the room over having to face reality.
Harry grinned wolfishly before pressing Draco up against the wall and kissing him hard on the lips. Draco froze, returned the kiss, and pushed him away, his hands firm but gentle. His face was pink and stern.
He wondered what Potter was doing here at six o’clock on a Saturday morning, staring right at Draco when he hadn’t looked at him fully in weeks. He was standing a few feet away from Draco, his wand and some parchment clutched in his hands.
“Ah. Yes, of course,” Ira nodded. “Have you eaten yet? We can get a bite to eat while you tell me what you need to.”
Draco self-consciously brushed a few loose strands away from his face.
“Good.”
Draco peered into the soup pots – one seemed to be a thick, creamy one with cauliflower, and the other a nice orange-red with lentils. It was a given, really, thought Draco as he shakily picked up a bowl and spooned some of the latter into it. He set it down, feeling Potter’s eyes on him, and picked up a spoon.
“I see. We’ll continue checking on you, Mr. Potter,” Estrada said. “I’d like to keep an eye on you and make sure that you stay out of danger. Once the Healer-In-Charge comes in, we’ll do that final step of cleansing, and you should be out of the woods. Does that sound good to you?”
Smiling, Draco undid the buttons and pulled the trousers off, Harry raising his hips to make them come off easier. Bright red boxers greeted him.
Draco stopped resisting and hugged Harry back. He breathed in Harry’s woodsy scent, his hoodie soft under Draco’s fingers. He felt calm. Safe.
“Right. And he’s not that pointy.”
Draco got off the bed, his legs resisting, and stuffed his wand in his back pocket. He walked over to Harry and was greeted by quite a sight. Harry, hair sticking up in all directions, wearing only ratty old socks, bent over his trunk and throwing its contents about worriedly.
Draco nodded, knowing the feeling all too well.
Ron and Hermione both shifted uncomfortably. Draco plowed on.
“My uncle put them up after I messed up a meeting with his client,” Harry explained, sighing. “Though it wasn’t really my fault; Dobby dropped a cake on the woman.”
“And congratulations, Ron!” he exclaimed as he went over to hug his best mate, whose ears were bright red.
"Dragons are cool," Harry said simply. "I could be deep and say they've played a big part in my life, or that they're tough and resilient or whatever, but I just like the look of it."
"What, Potter, are you my mother now? I've got one of those already, thank you."
much better than all this tense business.
On shaky legs, Draco stood and turned away, meaning to go back up the stairs to his room. He heard Potter get up too.
“It took a few drinks – I mean, a while, but yeah,” Ron said, stumbling over his words.
"Malfoy..." Potter took a hesitant step forward.
– up Draco’s stomach and chest. Draco gasped, his back arching off the bed. He was breathing heavily as he undid his own trousers with trembling hands, unable to wait any longer.
,” Draco said, looking away because Potter was still giving him that horrible smile, “You’re a grown adult. You should be able to do these things yourself.”
Draco nodded, and Ira swiped the half-eaten sandwich.
He squinted his eyes at them. “Is that a compliment?”
“Really?”
Draco’s chest ached.
"I know what I'm feeling, Hermione," Harry said lowly.
Potter ducked his head.
He didn’t know how long he sat there, not entirely present in the world, before someone came and sat down next to him. Draco turned his head to face Harry, who was worrying his lip.
"You're bleeding."
Draco made a disgruntled noise but cracked an eye open. Harry couldn’t help but beam at him.
“Draco –“
Blaise was out for the day, undoubtedly with the youngest Weasley, so he invited Harry over. They’d been able to spend a longer time together than usual the day before in the History of Magic room, and Draco hoped they could break their record today, especially since it was a Saturday.
“I – old habits die hard,” Draco said weakly.
“There’s no need to thank me, Potter.”
They parted. Harry’s bright eyes were on Draco, intense as ever. Draco realized that this was the second time they’d avoided uncomfortable conversations through kissing. He didn’t know what to make of that.
Rubbish friend.
But the truth was that there were only so many times Harry could express how lost and angry and paranoid he was before his friends got sick of it. There were only so many things they could say to comfort him before he turned to other "solutions." God, what was wrong with him?
to kill people – “
was the person he had major affections for.
, something he wasn’t supposed to do. It felt like his own, private rebellion, and who better to do that with than Harry Potter?
“Harry, relax,” Draco said calmly, his soothing voice washing over Harry. He had stood up from the bed and stopped Harry in his tracks, his hands on Harry’s shoulders. “Take a deep breath.”
He hated it. It made him feel like nothing had changed, like he was doomed to be this pathetic failure of a person – a Death Eater - forever.
“You weren’t at dinner last night though.”
patient.
“We’ll meet at the Leaky at eight, then?” Ira asked happily over Leo’s weak refusal.
“I’m fine,” repeated Harry with more fervor in his voice, hating the way they were looking at him.
“Thanks, Ginny.”
“Right. Thanks, Dr. Wolff.”
Potter shook his head.
Something about Harry made him so nervous; he hated it but it also thrilled him – like he was young and innocent and free again. It was easier to focus and not worry when he was leading but now, Harry was in control. And he was looking at him.
“What were you thinking about?”
Draco felt like he’d been petrified. Did he hear Harry correctly? Yes, he must’ve. What else could he have possibly said?
Draco eyed Potter's reflection with vague interest. What was he doing here in the first place?
Not Harry. Never Harry.
everywhere.”
“I could ask you the same thing,” Potter said, his eyes flashing over to Draco.
Four days. It’s the longest he’d ever been in hospital at a time.
Draco paced around his flat for another five minutes before doing one last check in the mirror and Apparating outside Leonel’s complex.
“Ginny, please – “
“You got this, boss. Don’t worry about it.”
He rested his head against Harry’s shoulder again.
you, I’m just trying – I want you to be better, you’re killing yourself – “
“Yeah, I bet. I figured you were going to have a big plan, mate,” Harry told Ron.
“She still shouldn’t be saying those things to you,” Draco muttered.
“Right. Should I, er, go and talk to her?”
“God, let me blow you,” Harry said after another minute of watching Draco, his own cock growing harder with every passing second.
“Mmph,” Harry said against his mouth. He said between kisses, “Draco, I - I want you.”
"How are you feeling today?"
“I don’t know anything about him. Betty’s told me about herself and she talks to me about things other than…all this,” Potter explained, gesturing vaguely around himself. “But, er, Estrada is just work-oriented. He’s sort of just mysterious.”
Betty had cautiously asked him if he was alright when they'd run into each other in the break room.
Or maybe this was all meant to be friendly banter.
Before Draco could respond, Blaise had left the room and Draco, sat on his bed with a book he hadn’t really been reading. He’d already made up his mind and was changing out of his uniform when Pansy and Daphne burst in, followed by a much calmer (sober) Astoria.
“Wonderful,” said Malfoy, clasping his hands together like the insufferable prat he was. “Potter, this is the final step of the cleansing procedure and will be much gentler than the past two were. All we must do is administer two potions and perform a spell to make them interact like we’d like them to.”
"Wasn't just oversharing," he mumbled, wanting to look away under Draco's heated gaze but unable to.
Potter chuckled shortly, the noise sounding all wrong to Draco’s ears. He was looking away again, his eyes unseeing.
“Alright. Shop’s going well, I hear?”
“I’m fine,” he mumbled, feeling hollow.
“And yet,” said Ginny.
Draco’s head tilted as Potter shrugged. “As long as she’s safe and happy, she can do whatever she’d like.”
“Thanks,” Weasley repeated. At Draco’s expression, he continued, “I, uh, heard you talking to Harry this morning.”
He was looking at Draco seriously now instead of with lighthearted amusement. Draco tried to look back at him apologetically.
Pansy had already followed his gaze.
Draco met those intense eyes he liked so much and shook his head, resigned.
“I did too. You’re very mature for your age.”
Potter sputtered a bit more before saying, “Look, never mind. We’ve gotten way off-track. And I don’t want to do that anymore.” At Draco’s questioning look, Harry sighed and said, “I don’t want to get Ginny and myself drunk just so I can talk to her about all that. It’s – it’s pathetic.”
give you a partially clean slate.
and everything, but we were both pawns in the war, weren’t we? And it fucked us up.”
“And how are you holding up with Mr. Potter gone?”
Harry rose to the bait.
“Both,” Draco said truthfully. “Potter, I know we have this little ‘pretend-therapy’ thing going on here, but this is just…different,” he finished weakly.
“Malfoy…”
“Fantastic. We’re going to head out after group’s over, alright?”
“I have to go. I can’t stay here.” His voice betrayed him by wavering slightly. “Just give me the treatment and I’ll do it myself. At home. But I can’t stay here.”
“Of course we both consented,” Harry sputtered, bewildered. “I’m just feeling…strange.”
“No one will see you,” White said, voice gentler than Harry had ever heard it. “And anyways, they’re false windows. Nothing out there but brick.”
The next day while out grocery shopping (he was slowly getting better at buying proper food), he ran into Luna.
“How can I help you, Draco?”
“Thank you, Pansy.”
“How much later?”
than this.”
Harry finally stopped pacing and rubbed at his eyes with a single hand. Draco realized that he wasn’t wearing his glasses. Did he want them?
She turned and came over, a cup of coffee in her hand. She glanced at Harry for a second before addressing Damien.
. It is my job to look after your health and to help you. There’s a reason I’m head of this ward, and there’s a reason I’ve been assigned to you. I have an extensive knowledge of potions and poisons, and –“
She met Draco’s gaze now, raising her half-painted hand next to her face, modeling for the two men.
Potter looked at him, his expression grim and mouth a tight line. His eyebrows furrowed, and then he said, “You’re bleeding again.”
The eighth years had chosen to throw a holiday party before the majority of them left for home.
Draco rubbed at his forehead. Fucking hell of a day this was.
“Good,” he said, his voice silky smooth.
There was a pause.
Harry was trying to think of something to say when Samuel came back.
She looked at him warily, then down at the pills, and then back up.
“Potter, I -” he began, though he had no idea where he was going to go with that sentence.
I really struggled with this chapter. Like going back and forth wondering if it was right or wrong or good or bad or if it fit or if it was out of place but I still don't know! Let me know what you think, I would really truly appreciate it
Harry scrambled out of bed and rushed to his desk, grabbing the closest parchment and quill he could find. He scrawled a quick message –
Harry couldn't take it anymore - he pulled Draco against him and kissed his lips with force, reveling in the pleasantly surprised
“Great,” Kathy said, and looked down at her clipboard. “So, this is called the four-seven-eight relaxation exercise. It’s meant to help you relax and manage your stress, and it supposedly gets more effective with practice. Right, so the first step is to close your eyes and sit up straight.”
in a long time.”
“Yes, that’s perfect.”
“You shouldn’t be that surprised by it, Malfoy.”
Draco huffed. “No. Of course not. However did you get that idea?”
It was the opposite of reassuring to Harry, however, because he was forced to think about how he’d have to deal with all this shit for the rest of his life. To some degree, at least, he would be forced to reckon with his addiction until his last day. He knew too well that he would relapse at some point. It was an inevitability, a harsh one. Somehow, somewhere, he would break and fall apart and have to go through this all over again. There was no magic cure, no special switch –
“Sometimes I think it would have been better if I had just stayed dead.”
Draco frowned at him, then handed him the water.
He blushed hot. “I don’t know, I just knew. I was never interested in women. You read my mother’s letter.”
“What? Hermione, what are you on about?” Weasley asked. Draco watched as Weasley’s own eyes jumped from each of them, landing lastly on the love bite on Harry’s neck. Weasley blanched. “Harry, did you…?”
“D-d’you think she’ll say yes?”
Draco sat on his bed and carefully entered the number into his contacts page. The name? What should he put? He decided on ‘HP.’ Simple and to-the-point.
It was the day of the engagement party.
“There shouldn’t
Draco’s mind was still racing – what was he supposed to do? When in all his studies had he learned what to do if your patient fancied you? Pushing away all the personal thoughts that were flying around in his head, he focused on the professional.
Finally willing his body to move, Harry tucked the fallen strands back behind Draco's ear. His hand trailed down his pale face, down his bare chest, finally landing on the cloth restraining his cock. Harry gripped it through Draco's trousers, relishing the way Draco's body tensed.
Malfoy undid the charm with a flick of his wand and checked his watch.
This was on the forefront of his mind until Harry came walking up to him. Draco had been waiting for him, standing and smoking by their usual spot by the lake as he did so. Draco hardly took time to take in the sight (Harry in his school cloak and gloves, shivering slightly) before he reached out and pulled him in, kissing him hard. Harry kissed back enthusiastically, his mouth warm on Draco’s.
He thought about Malfoy's words. That Estrada liked to be professional, but he would open up if prompted to. Harry knew he
He started for the door, but Potter stood in his way. He was glaring at Draco with an intensity and irritation Draco was all too familiar with.
Weasley allowed himself to be pulled, apparently too shocked to move on his own.
He marveled at sight in front of him. Harry was, by the looks of it, just as eager and ready as Draco was. His cock was thicker than Draco imagined, and so very hard. Draco bent forward, resuming his exploration of Harry’s body. He kissed Harry’s inner thighs, working closer and closer to his cock, reveling in the sounds and twitches Harry made. Draco paused to pull off his own jumper, leaving only his own button-up underneath.
Leonel looked exceptionally handsome today. Draco hadn’t seen him all day and would rather have not seen him at all, considering the state Draco was in – both physically and mentally.
“Fuck off.” Draco rolled his eyes.
Potter scowled as Draco said
But he wasn’t alone until much after. He came back into the great hall with Granger and Weasley, unfailingly, at his side. They parted, most likely to be with Weasley’s family, and Potter was finally alone. Draco stood, not really hearing his parents’ questions and walked over to him.
“You heard me."
"I'm really, really not one of those people."
They were sat in the eighth year Common Room again, lounging by the fireplace. The quiet voices of Macmillan and Abbott and the crackling fire were the only other sounds in the room, and Draco was unsettled by it. He wondered what wild theories the two Hufflepuffs were coming up with about him and Potter.
"Is that a bad thing?"
Weasley studied him a moment. It was strange to see him without Granger at his side.
“I accept your apology,” said Draco. “Just…don’t do it again.”
“Hello, Weasley, Granger,” Draco said, and folded his hands. He sighed. “As you read, Potter’s being difficult. He’s still under the impression that he’ll be leaving tomorrow, and I’m certain I don’t need to tell you how terrible that idea is.”
“I said it was strong, didn’t I?” Harry picked his up and Malfoy did too, albeit reluctantly. “Cheers.”
Potter let out a laugh despite himself. “That’s actually one of the reasons we didn’t get back together. I couldn’t, or didn’t want to, talk to her about the war. I just wanted it to be over. I know better now though, obviously.”
“Still,” Draco said, looking him in the eye again.
“Of course, Harry,” Ginny smiled. “I’ll go to yours and look for the Cloak today, alright?”
He knew he was getting close; his entire body felt charged, full, and it was faster than he would’ve liked but he couldn’t stop it – he came into Malfoy’s hand with a gasp. Harry faltered only for a second before returning at full speed, wanting Malfoy to come too. It was just a few more moments until he did, panting heavily with a dazed look on his face.
“Of course,” Harry said, buttoning his trousers up.
“Oh, er, yeah. Me too,” Harry said, nodding, unsure of what to do next.
"You really can be a twat sometimes, can't you?”
“I dunno,” Harry said, and he didn’t.
"Leo..." he whispered. "Not...here."
Damien laughed again. “Might just be a gay thing, but he’s very obviously only interested in men.”
“You wouldn’t,” said Harry, grinning at her before walking over to the window. He pulled it open and let Malfoy’s owl hop inside gracefully. Untying the scroll of parchment from its leg, Harry told Ginny, “It’s from Malfoy.”
“True,” said Harry. His smile was forced. “It looks good on you.”
He shrugged his coat off as he approached Potter and Ginevra, who were sat side-by-side in a booth. They were deep in conversation, the drinks in front of them forgotten, and didn’t notice Draco until he’d cleared his throat. The two of them started and looked up. Ginevra greeted him with a smile that was a bit too mischievous for his liking and said, “Glad you could make it, Malfoy.”
Hannah nodded next to him, sparing a glare at Draco. He wanted to vanish.
“She remained stable throughout the night,” Betty answered.
Draco cursed his forgetfulness, and cursed the situation he had gotten Harry in. His eyes jumped from Granger (still furious, slightly shocked), to Harry (mostly mortified), and landed on Weasley (predictably clueless).
“You don’t,” Potter said firmly. “I know you don’t.”
“Draco.” Harry pulled away, panting, his lips swollen. “Maybe we should actually get on the bed.”
He was itching for a smoke and solitude; he needed to calm down before he faced Pansy again.
“From the Horcrux. Hermione saved me,” he murmured.
Ron placed a comforting arm around Hermione’s shoulders and shot Harry a look.
Draco glanced over at Harry, who was walking through the flat with a look of childlike wonder on his face. He smiled softly as he watched Harry go up to the window and look outside of it.
“Come on,” he said tiredly and began walking away from the table, not glancing back to check if she was following.
Draco finally smiled, slightly.
They pulled away from each other, and Draco saw the lust in Harry’s eyes.
“You never asked for it back,” Draco said stiffly.
“No,” said Harry, “I like looking at you.”
Harry chose to take a sip instead of responding. He felt Draco watching him, and feeling uncomfortable, asked what was wrong.
Betty nodded and took out a notepad and quill from her pockets.
Once he felt stable enough, Draco released Potter and stepped back. He couldn’t look at him, suddenly feeling incredibly self-conscious.
Draco started walking without waiting for Potter, but sure enough, he heard the sound of footsteps behind him after a few moments. He took the both of them to the employee lounge; after unlocking and opening the door, he switched on the lights and allowed Potter passage. He watched as Potter walked inside, blinking blearily and looking around. Draco followed him in and shut the door behind him.
Please let me know what you thought. Twice I got really close to deleting the second half of the chapter cause I didn't like where it was going, but I also didn't want to erase all the progress I'd made for the first time in months. I don't hate it, but I admittedly don't love it uwu there's always ways to improve
"There's not much to know," he said shortly.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said, tears now falling down her cheeks as she rushed to hug him. Harry hugged her tightly, breathing in her scent and feeling the shudder of her shoulders and the strength of her arms wrapped around him. “We love you so much and it just –
Draco released the smoke from his lungs and shivered. It was getting colder out (big surprise) and Draco had forgotten his scarf in his rush this morning. He had another nightmare; this one had featured Nagini. He wondered if he would ever be free of the taint the Dark Lord left in his house. He wondered if he deserved to be free.
Panic flooded him; who could Ginny have brought? Ron? Or Hermione? Or maybe –
“Luna – he’s been giving
When he finished, he leaned back to examine his work.
"I can pretend that I’m put together and ‘fixed’ all I want but in truth, I’m just weak and broken and it’s so
Harry looked at him, knowing that everything wasn’t alright, and reached across the table to hold Draco's hand. Slightly callused, scarred, warm, comforting.
Harry took Draco’s hand shyly, wondering if he looked at Draco like that. It was likely, Harry decided, as he gazed at him – at his aristocratic features, his enticing eyes, pink lips. Draco felt his gaze and turned to Harry, a questioning look on his face.
“I didn’t even know I liked blokes in Hogwarts!”
“Cheers,” said Damien.
And with that, Leonel left Draco’s office, leaving him with only his thoughts.
couldn’t happen here.”
“Yes,” said Draco. “He was resistant at first, but with enough encouragement from his loved ones, he made the decision to work with us and complete treatment. The cleansing procedure worked perfectly, and you can see that his vitals were up to standard days before he left.”
But hey, at least he wasn’t throwing up anymore.
“Right,” said Harry. “Malfoy, could we talk?”
“Beautiful,” he murmured aloud, half by accident but he didn’t care – Malfoy seemed to like it.
Draco took it, feeling stronger the moment it was back in his hand. He almost said thank you again, but instead said, “Go to sleep, Potter. You look half-dead.”
“Since Ginny is back in town, we were thinking of going out tonight,” Granger explained. “You know, to let off some steam. Would you like to join us?”
Harry clenched his fists so tightly that his fingernails dug into his flesh. Malfoy took Estrada's hand in his own and said in a low voice, "Leo."
Potter, recover. As I’ve said before, we must help you flush out the potions in your system. And then we’ll be helping you stop taking said potions and curb your addiction.”
“Well, then, you’re welcome for still being alive.”
“Fix it?” Harry repeated incredulously. “No, Draco, this is good! It’s good that you’re eating; you don’t need to fix anything!”
“We’ve got a break now,” Kathy said after taking out her phone to check the time, “So we’ll continue in ten minutes, like always.”
that I watch this ridiculous film.”
“And I know that’s also ridiculous because we don’t
Ginny interrupted his brooding.
“That was when I realized I liked you,” Harry plowed on. “More than friends, more than
“Good morning, Potter,” he said, retrieving the file from where it hung on the end of his bed.
Shocked, he looked up at Harry, wanting an explanation. Harry was staring down at his hand, his jaw clenched.
Potter let out a bitter laugh without turning back around. Draco watched the back of his head with a clenched chest.
“Not everyone had Voldemort living in their house.”
He glanced at Malfoy, trying to be discreet. He was sitting there, eyes on Kathy, and Harry resisted the urge to go over there and start interrogating him. It wasn’t his business, Harry tried to reason with himself. Malfoy could do whatever the hell he liked, and it didn’t concern him at all.
They tucked into a wonderful breakfast courtesy of Kreacher and with Harry adequately dressed. The two sat across from each other and ate in near silence. Harry had trouble making conversation what with feeling incredibly awkward and still being a bit intimidated by Draco. While he was slowly unraveling the mystery of Draco Malfoy, there was still tons of work to do.
“There’s still time. We’ve got two and a half weeks left of term, which is plenty of time to do thorough research, organize our notes, and write a
“What’s the occasion, Potter?” Malfoy said, and there was almost a smile in his voice.
“It’s Monday,” said Leo, saying exactly what Draco was thinking.
, scowled a voice within him, but he couldn’t. Even this took too much effort.
Harry held out his arm, having no patience to walk all the way back home. Draco took it and Harry Apparated a second later. He regained his composure and looked over at Draco, who was glancing around, a puzzled expression on his face.
“I couldn’t – Potter, I was your Healer. And I meant it when I said there’s good reason addicts in recovery are advised against new relationships. No, let me finish,” he said when Potter opened his mouth. “I’m not patronizing you, Potter. I’m looking out for your best interests. New relationships are destabilizing, and your life right now is unstable enough as it is.”
But now, seeing Potter’s face, he couldn’t for the life of him remember why.
“I was going to make an event out of it,” confessed Ron as he moved his bag up and down. “But I was just thinking about how much I love her and how I wanted to hear her talk about work every day and I got caught up in the moment and – really, why not now?”
He watched Harry think about it, his breaths still rather uneven. He wondered if he shouldn’t have said anything; this might have been too much too fast for Harry.
Draco considered it. “Will it end in another accidental three-day sleepover?”
There it was.
He looked over at the circle of plastic chairs that dominated the room. There was a small section of them that wasn’t occupied by anyone; Harry walked over and sat in one.
“No, no, don’t take it back,” Potter said hurriedly, a smile on his face. “It’s too late.”
And then he was gone.
“It’s just,” Harry had said, lowering his wand, “I still can’t believe wizards don’t have hospitals like that too. What do mentally ill wizards and witches do?”
Draco left the bathroom and was met with the sight of Astoria, who had clearly been waiting for him outside. He froze as he locked eyes with her, his body unable to move from the shock. The only sound in the corridor was the bathroom door closing shut with a slow groan. Finally, Draco took a deep breath and tried for a glare.
“Yes, sir,” Betty said and hurried out of the room, leaving Draco alone in the room with Potter.
“I’m gay,” Draco nearly choked on the words.
“Thanks,” Potter said again softly, wrapping his hands around his tea.
“I have an Invisibility Cloak,” Potter said, watching Draco’s face carefully. “And after I got rid of that Death Eater, Ron, er, went for it. Called you a bastard, I think.”
“They’re the ones who are always telling me to move on, but here they are, refusing to entertain the idea that you might not be all that bad.” Potter took another huge bite of the apple. “I wish they’d at least be open to it. I thought the whole point of the war was to move away from all these ancient prejudices and unite together and all that.”
“Happy Christmas…Harry.”
“He made the decision to come here,” Draco answered, looking Weasley square in the eye. “On some level, he knew he needed help and he acted on it. We have to take advantage of that and – “
“I’m very happy to hear that. Something happened, didn’t it? Something additional to group, I mean, to make you feel different.”
“God, Harry, what are we, Aurors? No. Boyfriends is just fine,” Draco said, his face reddening even more.
Harry turned to face Draco and took his face in his hands and kissed him hard. Draco couldn’t help the weak sigh that left his mouth, the one that Harry swallowed sweetly. Draco gripped onto Harry as their kiss deepened, open-mouthed now.
“Yes, of course,” she said, nodding. She came out from behind her hostess stand and began walking into the dining room. “If you’d follow me, sir.”
Harry nodded, and Malfoy performed the Disillusionment Charm. As soon as the egg-feeling was gone, Harry turned away and made for the door. Malfoy, apparently too taken-aback to respond immediately, only moved when Harry had already left the office.
They were quiet for a minute, just sitting and listening to the silence.
“Cigarettes are bad for you,” Potter finally said, a slight frown on his face.
He stepped closer, a hand held out like he was going to grab onto him. He must’ve thought better of it, though, because it fell away. Draco’s gaze focused on it, his mind weakly trying to make sense of what was happening. He was so dizzy.
He still thought it was the right one, mind, his belief only reaffirmed when there’d been a photograph published by the
“Oh. Yes,” said Draco and hurriedly picked up his fork. “Sorry.”
“Why this, Draco?”
“Mr. Potter, please,” Estrada finally spoke. His voice wavered slightly, but he stood his ground. “You know that he’s changed. He’s been redeeming himself for years and he’s proved himself to be a good man. He wouldn’t be a Healer otherwise. And I
"Good grief," Draco said, and actually looked a bit faint. "I'm...dating...Harry Potter."
He felt and heard Potter sigh. “You’re a prat.”
drop everything for him because that’s just the kind of effect he has on people,” Draco continued, watching as Harry’s playful smile began to falter. He stood, slowly, keeping eye contact with Harry as he did so. He moved closer. “Especially on me. And I don’t even think he knows it.”
“Oh, and I suppose
“It’ll be great. We’ll congratulate Hermione and Ron, we’ll say hi to Molly and Ginny and Luna and everyone else and it’ll be great.”
Draco didn’t know what to think about that. It sounded like Harry was saying he’d gained weight. He knew Harry didn’t mean for it to hurt, but it still did. His insides felt cold as he ran the words over and over in his head. He’d gotten fat, he’d gotten lazy, he’d gotten careless. He’d seen in the mirror just that morning how his ribs weren’t as defined as they used to be, and he felt sick.
Harry sighed. He didn't want Draco to get upset just because he didn't feel like talking about his feelings (for once, might he add).
Draco rolled his eyes.
“I love you, Harry. We all do,” Ginny said quietly, and exited the room.
Leo’s eyes widened. “Really?”
Pure bliss flooded Draco’s mind and he shut his eyes again tight, struggling to breathe, only feeling Harry’s cock and his calloused hand around Draco’s neck. Everything else went away.
“I can’t
There was an uncomfortable silence in the air as they waited for the other Healer to arrive. Should he try to make conversation? He didn’t know anything about Betty, aside that her name was Betty and she was a Healer-in-Training.
“Are you really going to spend the night in here?” Blaise had asked warily, heading to his closet and shrugging off his robes. He glanced over at Draco as he hung them up. “Come on, don’t be stupid.”
“Tea, anyone?”
know each other, but I reckon we – my point is, would you like to? Get to know each other properly, I mean,” Potter said hurriedly. He flashed a nervous smile. “Because I would.”
“What? No I don’t,” Draco crossed his arms defensively.
Y'all...this is it. This ending snuck up on me!
Harry nodded. “A few times.” He glanced around the restaurant too, tapping his fingers on the table. “Ron and Hermione introduced me to it.”
It was when he reached the final landing that his heart could finally slow down.
But it was also hard to trust Potter. A sudden offer of friendship after everything that had happened was slightly unsettling, and he had to admit that he was afraid that Potter might have ulterior motives. It might just all be a big joke, a way to humiliate him further.
“Harry’s been giving bloody handjobs to Malfoy!”
“What?” Harry asked, his heart in his throat. Had she already figured it out? She couldn’t have. It wasn’t like he was drooling or anything, and he wasn’t too tired yet.
, thought Harry stubbornly.
Confusion was clear on Potter’s face.
His cheeks had swollen noticeably, emphasizing his smile lines. Red splotches and lines surrounded his eyes and crawled from his temples down to his jawline. The redness stood out against his sickly pale skin. Heavy bags sat beneath his tired eyes. All this combined and the effect was shocking. He hadn't seen himself look this bad in ages.
“I’ll let the Healers know you’re awake.”
Pansy didn’t look up at him; she was busy painting her nails a deep burgundy.
been cleaned, and didn’t Malfoy say that he might be able to leave today? Not that he really even wanted to, if he was being perfectly honest with himself.
go away eventually.”
Harry would’ve liked to argue, but he didn’t think he had the ability to do so. He could barely speak as it was, too terrified that he would begin crying all over again, which was a mortifying thought.
They parted with a soft, chaste kiss while Ron and Hermione had gone to the kitchen, and Draco told him that he’d see him Wednesday. Harry was already counting down the days.
“Oh.” Potter’s eyebrows scrunched together in thought. After a moment, he said, “I’ll go there. It’ll – er, be a nice change of pace.”
Ginny took a deep breath. "You're getting help, Harry. You'll get through this, and we'll be here every step of the way."
“Yes,” Harry gasped, his fingers curling and grasping the sheets.
Draco made to deny it, but Harry captured Draco’s lips with his own. Harry kissed him enthusiastically, a low hum coming from him as his hands ran across Draco’s chest once more. Harry pulled away and looked down. Draco followed his gaze. His fingers were close to one of the Sectumsempra scars.
“Well, that was strange,” Astoria said.
“Just one,” Harry also repeated, so Luna knew that it was just one.
“Oi, Harry, you awake?”
Draco picked up the pace after this, driving in deeper with every thrust. The slap of flesh on flesh and panting filled the otherwise silent room, and Harry closed his eyes again and relished the sound. He was achingly hard but was avoiding touching his own cock, wanting to enjoy this as long as possible.
was the cause of it,
The check-up was quick and Draco discharged her confidently, reminding her to be careful with her drinks (and friends).
"I'm not going to let you ruin it," Ginny told him firmly. "Not again. I love you, Harry, and I know you. I know that you wouldn't be able to stay clean if you went home today."
“Your friends have already told me a few details regarding your potions abuse –“
“Are you just going to stare at it?” asked Malfoy, slightly breathless.
Harry let out a short, incredulous laugh. He wiped his eyes and looked at her.
“I should just bring my own wardrobe at this rate,” Draco observed, sifting through Harry’s apparently subpar collection.
“You, Leo,
He was suddenly very annoyed at Potter. The git had practically ignored him for
“Admit what?”
“It’s true,” Harry said smugly. “The Sorting Hat said I’d do well in Slytherin, but I asked to be in Gryffindor, so here we are.”
Sometime during the past summer, Draco had picked up a smoking habit. His mother hated it; she said it was because she was worried for his health, but he wondered how much of her hatred came from the anti-Muggle prejudice that had long been seeped in her mind.
“I dropped whatever it was Pansy said to you in the library,” Draco reasoned, “Even though I’m still curious. So now I’m asking you to leave this.”
“Erm…she’s quite the character,” Harry said, glancing nervously at Malfoy.
He’d locked himself in, of course. This was a sanctuary. A disgusting, lowly sanctuary but a sanctuary nonetheless.
“Shut up, you prat. I wouldn’t want to be with anyone else right now.”
“Yeah, that’ll get the job done,” Harry grinned.
Harry thought about it momentarily before nodding. What sense of pride did he even have left?
“Just peachy,” replied Malfoy. “Thanks, Betty.”
God, Harry didn’t remember the last time he had been this drunk.
“There’s no need. I’ll be gone in a day.”
Malfoy looked him square in the eye.
. The flat was musty and stale and Harry wrinkled his nose, wondering if it’s always smelled like this. He glanced over at Ginny to see if she’d noticed the stink as well, and she gave him a lopsided smile.
Harry accepted this with relative ease. “Fair enough.”
“Do you know or not, Potter?”
“So, you’ve finally done the deed?” Blaise asked, and smirked as Draco choked on his food.
. He makes me happy.”
fragile, and anyway, it’s not like he only thought about the war when someone brought it up. It was always in the back of his mind, even when he tried to block it out with substances.
“I’m not fucking – making excuses for them,” Harry argued, flabbergasted.
“I didn’t pine.”
Draco stood back up and hurried over to the mirror, wand clutched in his sweaty hand. He'd never gotten too good at glamours, never felt the need to. He was bitterly regretting it now.
"You know I take patient confidentiality seriously."
He pulled away, releasing Draco’s wrists and walking out of the bedroom.
what he was anxious about. Dr. Wolff? Therapy? Malfoy?
“Thanks, me too,” Harry replied, managing a smile.
Draco came in Harry with a deep moan; white spots filled his vision. He’d never experienced anything so powerful, so strong, so
“I didn’t have an appetite. I couldn’t. I was either too busy being terrified or anxious to even
“Wha-?” Harry moaned, and Draco watched his eyes snap open.
“Yeah, I hope so,” Ginny scoffed. “He was a right wanker in school.”
“Bugger off,” mumbled Draco.
Draco watched as Potter followed his commands, his face impassive as he stared back at Draco.
He looked at his reflection; his eyes were bloodshot but at least his nose wasn’t bleeding this time.
Pansy batted Daphne’s hand away without much avail.
She looked satisfied. “You’re as touchy as ever though. I’ll take what I can get. How were your holidays?”
“You can talk to me, you know, Potter,” Draco chided gently.
While everyone was enjoying Kathy’s cake, Cait sidled up to Harry, Samuel, and Damien.
“I don’t know,” he finally said. “Would you…want to come over tonight?”
Draco pushed open the door of the sixth floor bathroom and walked right in, knowing no one would be there, save for the possibility of Moaning Myrtle. He went over to one of the sinks and gripped the edges of it tightly, avoiding his reflection in the dirty mirror.
He followed at Harry’s heels, almost running into him when he stopped suddenly. Draco looked to see why, and the answer was apparent. Granger and Weasley stood in front of Harry.
. And it scared me, and I ran. I’m sorry.”
“Did they know?” At Harry’s puzzled expression, Wolff elaborated. “Did they know you’d gone to drink alone?”
“Yes, I’ve
Draco didn’t see anything at first, but then he noticed two light indentations on Harry’s forearm. Draco’s fingers found them too, going over them gently.
“You, I can’t believe I’m,” Draco answered, unable to stop himself, “With you, finally with you, finally -
. He wondered what Ginevra was thinking of him now that she knew he was still thinking about his ex-patient three weeks after his release. She didn’t sound mad, at least. In fact, she didn’t sound much of anything. Unsettled and ashamed, Draco stuffed the letter back into its envelope and shooed the owl away.
He swallowed, his throat tight, and nodded.
“Perfectly understandable,” Samuel grinned.
“Well,” she said cautiously. It was clear she hadn’t told this story before. “Harry taking potions isn’t anything new. He started taking Dreamless Sleep shortly after the war ended. But it was still an approved amount back then, and he only took it when necessary. But when he started training as an Auror, it got worse.”
Draco halted immediately and hugged his arms tighter to himself.
Harry had already tossed off his glasses and shirt by the time they’d gotten to the bedroom. He sat down on the still sheet-less bed and looked at Draco expectantly. Draco took in the gorgeous sight, eyes bright and unobscured by those ugly (yet endearing) glasses, his slightly dark skin that contrasted so deeply against Draco’s own, and the visible bulge underneath the grey sweatpants.
Draco had already nervously thrown up the breakfast he had eaten under Harry’s watchful gaze. Luckily, his boyfriend was too busy cleaning his own room in suspense of Weasley coming back to Hogwarts today, along with the rest of the students. This left Draco alone to do as he wished, telling Harry that he’d be cleaning his own room too.
“Don’t what?” snapped Draco.
Malfoy scribbled something into his notes.
He had turned to look at Draco; his pupils were dilated and his lips were swollen. Draco felt elation rush through him despite the aching in his trousers.
“You,” Draco murmured, thrusting again. “You are, Harry.”
Breakfast was the hardest to skip. The three of them always went down together, every morning without fail, and he would have to eat. With lunch and dinner, he could give excuses – class, homework, revision – but not breakfast.
“Harry, mate…we’re always here for you,” Ron said. “Through thick and thin. No matter what.”
Draco cleared his throat. He looked pointedly into the famous green eyes.
Draco summoned two butterbeers, passing one to Harry as he sat down. He let out a great sigh and cracked the bottle open.
He was filled with a cold dread as he sat up, his heart racing pathetically. God, could he really have been that foolish? To think Draco Malfoy would really want to spend the night with him? They certainly didn't talk about whether he would be staying til morning; they had drifted off to sleep rather early after lazy conversation, but he didn’t think Draco would just
Draco’s quill scratched furiously against the parchment.
“Mum’ll be so glad to see you,” Weasley said. “All of us will.”
“What’s next?”
Potter may as well have punched him in the stomach or slapped him in the face. The shock of what he’d said was visceral. Draco wasn’t trying to kill himself; it wasn’t true, it was just…
Draco stuck his head into the green flames, and he was met with Wolff's sensible heels. She stooped gracefully to his level somehow, and smiled at him.
“Great,” Harry muttered, dropping into the seat next to Draco and opening his own bottle.
“Would you like to talk about it?”
"Fucking hell, of course you are," Draco rolled his eyes before sitting up and flipping Harry over. Harry's heart pounded in excitement, and when Draco did nothing, Harry cleared his throat.
“I know what you’re-“
“Where would you even buy the not-Firewhisky? Isn’t it Muggle?”
“Look away, Pansy,” Draco said before he leaned over to kiss Harry.
They looked hopefully at Draco, and he sighed again.
He sat down next to Draco. He was wearing a black hoodie with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and his dark hair was as messy as ever. Draco loved how it looked at this length, and wanted desperately to run his fingers through it.
worry about you,” Harry said, shaking his head. “How could I not? You’re my best friends and I just want you to be happy.”
“Even if it were, you need a year to focus on yourself. Solely yourself. And my presence is just getting in the way of that.”
“Yeah?”
“You’re hurting yourself,” said Potter, his voice accusatory. “You can’t keep doing it.”
“Yes ma’am,” Betty said, her cheeks turning slightly pink as Mitchell turned the attention to her. “I’m very lucky to be studying under Healer Malfoy and I’ll do all I can for Mr. Potter, I promise.”
“There’s no excuse for what I did,” he said lowly. “I live with the consequences of my actions every day, Potter, and I’ll never let myself forget it even if I could.”
“I saw her…after the War. And she helped me,” Draco rambled. “I’m functioning now. Perhaps I’m still not a ‘normal’ person, but I can do normal things. As you can obviously tell. But I think…if you go to every appointment and listen to her and take her advice, she can really help you.”
I keep worrying that I'm recycling dialogue/situations from my other eighth-year fic but I think I'm alright. It's definitely been a while since I've looked at it though, so who knows.
Once he saw her off to the receptionists’ desk, he sent a Patronus to Leonel, asking to meet with him so they could discuss Potter. Leonel’s Rottweiler came bounding back a minute later, telling him that he was in the faculty lounge.
Harry nodded as Hermione released him and wiped her eyes. She stayed sat on the bed as Ron swept her hair away from her tear-streaked face.
The rest of their dinner went relatively normally; Harry asked Draco about work, and Draco asked Harry the same (or the closest thing Harry had to it, anyway). The way Draco asked made Harry think he might have been following the press surrounding him, but Harry said nothing about it. He simply told Draco about how he’d joined a few wizarding organizations that focused on mental health awareness and potion addiction. He rarely liked using his fame to his advantage, but this was for a good cause – and one that was close to him as well. And besides, it’s not like he had anything better to do.
“Er, yeah,” Potter said. He sounded tired – exhausted. When he looked Draco in the eye, he frowned, which was
He glanced over at Astoria – she was tall for a sixteen-year old girl, her blue eyes level to the tip of Draco’s nose.
Draco started and looked guiltily at Leo, who was scowling.
Merlin, he could never get sick of this, of Harry’s scent flooding Draco’s senses and his warmth reassuring against Draco’s skin. Harry was already kissing back enthusiastically, and soon he had nudged Draco’s mouth open and was flicking his tongue inside. Draco began moving his hands up and down Harry’s torso, slipping them underneath his cotton shirt, savoring the warm skin underneath.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, that’d be great.”
“First, um, Malfoy, I appreciate your apology,” Hermione put in, shooting an apprehensive look at Harry.
“I think it would more than what’s left of both of our family’s wealth combined in Mind Healer bills to figure that one out.”
“Draco,” Harry was saying.
with Potter had affected him more than he let on, and Draco wasn’t quite sure how to fix it.
“I look like I just got off work.” Leonel rolled his eyes. “Is Indian ok? I’m starving.”
“Formal as always,” smiled Cait, who didn’t seem at all discouraged by Malfoy snapping at her. She then rounded on Harry, her dark brown eyes glittering. “Unlike you. But you went to the same school?”
It was still lit in their room and Draco sat down on his four-poster bed, relishing the silence and privacy. His habit was one that required privacy, after all. It was hard with Pansy’s watchful eye, but he was careful. He hardly went right after meals; he almost always ensures that he spends at least an hour with Pansy and Blaise after dinners before going to the loo. Lunch on weekdays was easier in that respect, with their differing school schedules and the chaos that came with the entire school bustling about.
early in the game,” Ira grinned.
Hermione suppressed a sigh.
“Me neither,” said Draco.
“Malfoy.”
It'd been a long while since he'd gone over to any bloke's flat, and he was admittedly nervous. Draco checked his wristwatch - it was already 7:50. Draco had fallen asleep quickly after coming home, getting a good four and a half hours in. When he’d woken up, Leonel’s owl was watching Draco from his bedside table, irritated at having to wait so long. Draco had jumped to take the letter off its leg and read it quickly, having already expected Leo to contact him.
But now Harry had Draco. Beautiful, clever, funny Draco, who he had more in common with than he’d ever expected, who he always felt comfortable around, who he could be
Before he could do it though, she did it herself, roughly and impatiently, and sniffled.
Classes had started again but all Draco could think about was Harry. After spending Christmas holiday attached at the hip, it felt wrong to be without him. They could hardly afford to sneak around now that there were bigger risks than simply Macmillan and Abbott knowing. It was a miracle enough that it seemed as though the two Hufflepuffs kept their word about not telling anyone.
“Draco?”
“What, so you’ve been shagging him since September?” Ron asked, continuing to talk about Draco as if he wasn’t there.
“I know,” he said softly. “You just went about it the wrong way.”
“It’s wonderful to meet you both,” Leonel said, his voice gentle. “I just wish it was under better circumstances.”
