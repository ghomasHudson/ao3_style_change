It was probably because he never told anyone about his past. The only one who knew was his mother, and the pity in her eyes each time she looked at him had permanently screwed up their relationship. He still feared it would do the same if he told Harry. But not telling Pansy and Blaise had ruined that relationship too.
when he got like this. Two years after Astoria’s death and he still all but collapsed every time she came up. It wasn’t fair to Scorpius to see his father so weak, and it wasn’t fair to Harry to keep mourning his late wife around him.
“I don’t- You- What? You mean that?” Draco was at a loss when Harry simply nodded and made himself comfortable in bed. “But- but with the kids and- we almost
“Just as long as it isn’t hospital food.” Draco warned. The stuff was gross, it always was. One would think that in a place where sick people were trying to get better, the food would be somewhat decent and healthy. Somehow it was always over- or undercooked, covered in gravy, soaked in salt or overdosed with sugar or all three at the same time though, and none of that had ever agreed with Draco’s stomach. “I’d rather eat a cardboard box.”
“Perhaps,” Harry said as he captured Draco’s wrist and pulled him on top of himself. “It’s true. He’s a cute, tiny, hyperactive idiot and I love him. That’s one of the reasons why I fought with Molly today.”
That, and if she were to drop everything and sit at Draco’s bedside, there was no denying anymore that she could be well on her way to losing one of her best friends. She was a bit more mature than her husband and very much not ashamed to admit to how much she liked Draco. To this day she had yet to meet a better debate partner. What Draco was with chess to Ron, he was with discussions to her. Losing that, never having her usual lunch break with him anymore, the one thing to keep her sane in hectic weeks, would mean the end. For years she’d been stretching herself to the limit and then some and the blow of losing Draco…
late. “I’m more than an hour late! I have patients! Why didn’t you wake me, Harry? Why are you here at all?”
“It's not easy being Draco Malfoy.” Harry slowly began to rub his arm, his hand spreading warmth to the tips of his fingers.
Molly took a step closer, fuming as she kept swaying with her ladle. “And so is raising picky spoiled brats!”
“You are quite right, Minister.” Both he and Hermione turned their heads towards the nurse who had just exited Malfoy's room. “Which is why I am quite happy to share with you that we have just detected brain activity. That does not mean Mr Malfoy is waking up, but it does mean that the oxygen cut off did not damage his nerve cells. If he wakes up, odds are he will make a full recovery.”
Poor Harry. He’d lost so much already. This would be the millionth blow he didn’t deserve, and the hardest yet to handle. If it hadn’t been obvious before, it was obvious now: Draco was simply not allowed to die. Not now, not ever. She tore herself away from the maternity ward and marched back to Draco’s room. He was going to wake up, and he was going to wake up
“As far as I am aware, our biggest problem is right here,” he replied as he came to a standstill in front of a large glass window. There were already three people standing there, an Indonesian woman in business attire and two young children. He joined them, looking through the window to get a proper view of Draco Malfoy’s hospital room. The place was quite crowded. Harry, who looked like he’d just woken up, was getting ushered to a chair by a nurse. Narcissa Malfoy stood next to her son, looking intimidating despite her hair sticking up on one side. A Healer was checking Malfoy’s vital signs, though Kingsley couldn’t decipher the outcome of the spells. “How is he holding up?”
When she arrived at the right ward, she was surprised to find not just Hermione and Parkinson there, but Teddy and Victoire as well. And Teddy was silently sobbing into Hermione’s sweater.
“Yeah. You’re too bloody nice.” Draco sniffed as he moved to curl himself up at his side. Neville was briefly worried what Harry would think of all this, until he remembered that he and Draco had been friends for over ten years. They had shared beds on many nights, yet Neville couldn’t think of a single friendship he had that was more platonic than this one. It would be like Draco being jealous of Ron.
I thought it was ridiculous and patronising at first, but it really is not. It is just love. A warm body next to you, keeping you save and greeting you with a smile in the morning can make a world of difference. But again, this is all very personal and you will only find a solution with trial and error. I hope you do try to find that solution though. A good dream can do wonders for your mental health and usually calms the mind during the day.
Potter just laughed, the git. Draco sent him a glare for his efforts and stalked over to the secluded booth in the corner. The first time he’d come here, he’d only ordered once Potter was in the back, and had sat exactly where he was sitting now.
Draco fell more than sat down in his chair and only replied in the shape of a groan. Harry shook his head. The idiot would work himself to death one day if he kept this up. Not that the rest of the Auror department was any help, with the way they encouraged Draco’s unhealthy work addiction. Harry doubted Draco was even happy here, but they hadn’t been on friendly terms long enough for him to ask. Plus, it wasn’t like Harry himself was having the time of his life as an Auror, yet he’d never told anyone about that either.
Harry squeezed his hand again, and Ron tactfully said something about the Channons winning the world cup, after which the debates and chatter soon came back. Harry didn’t participate though. He just kept looking at Draco, never once letting go of his hand. It made Draco feel quite antsy. Back when he and Harry had been just friends, he’d been on the verge of telling him a few times. Now that they were dating though, Draco was scared Harry would run for the door once he found out.
Slightly stunned, he watched the man vanish into the crowd outside, soon disappearing from sight. He had a feeling Hermione might want to bite his head off again soon. Or pull her hair out. Or hit him with a rather large stick.
Luna levitated the tray containing the order for Harry and Draco directly to their table. She didn’t want to interrupt what was clearly an intimate conversation, judging by the hushed tones they were using. If she was as intuitive as she liked to believe, this wouldn’t be the last time she saw the two men. This thought made her happy. It had been far too long since she had seen either man as relaxed as they looked right now.
And then Draco was crying again, trying to cover his eyes while quietly leaning into Neville. Neville welcomed him with open arms, glad he was bigger than Draco so he could properly wrap him up in a bear hug. His figure used to be a source of shame for him, but now he was slowly starting to like it because everyone else did too.
I’m contacting you because, well, I think the Ministry might be right. I… I need help. Or advice, maybe. I’m not sure if they’re the same thing.
His eyesight got blurry, and aunt Hermione wrapped a strong arm around him when the first sob came past his lips. He tried to blink the tears away but it was no use. After a while he gave up and buried his face in Hermione’s side, letting his sobs run free. That was why he missed the thing that caught Victoire’s attention.
“Hi, babe.” He briefly chuckled as he imagined what Draco’s reaction would be to that nickname. Disgusted on the surface, even though he’d have melted right underneath that mask. Clingy to a fault, but always hiding it because his father had taught him it was wrong — that was his Draco. “You’ve been here for quite a long time, you know? We miss you. Me, your mum, Ron, Hermione, Molly, Teddy, Rose. Even Kingsley showed up yesterday in the dead of night.”
Pansy joined her, silently, and followed her gaze. The sight she was met with was peaceful yet heartbreaking. Narcissa was sleeping next to her son in a position that would surely give her a sore back. Her face was edged with lines of worry that sleep could not erase, and both hands were clutched around Draco’s left arm. On Draco’s other side, half on the bed, half on a chair, sat Harry Potter, his face so close to Draco it almost looked like they’d been kissing.
.” Draco snapped, some of the life finally seeping back into him. “You can’t reheat tea water. It’s a crime.”
“Draco? Are you-, Draco!” Harry rushed to his side as he saw what the issue was; His guest was having some sort of fever dream-nightmare. Draco was bathing in sweat, his face scrunched up in fear. “Draco, wake up. It’s just a bad dream, it’s not real. Come on, I made you soup. You can’t have soup when you’re having a nightmare. Unless it’s really awful soup, but I really tried my best on this!”
“You hold him close.” Neville found the answers came to him quite naturally. “You hold him close, you make sure he knows he’s loved, you get him tea, you make him see a therapist. He doesn’t have to tell you anything, because this is
It was about fifteen minutes later when he heard the stumble of his guests making their way to his bedroom. Harry looked quite thoroughly snogged, while Draco looked like he wanted to disappear. His fingers frantically pulled on the edge of his sweater, and his eyes were cast down, as if searching for a trapdoor into oblivion.
Harry kept rambling on with his nonsense until Draco finally got to a place where he could relax. As soon as that happened, he collapsed against Harry and stayed there with his head on his chest until he had fully caught his breath again. “I’m sorry,” he muttered. “I know I should stop myself when I’m circle-thinking.”
For her, getting to know Malfoy had always been a bit of a sore point. Though she knew she and Harry would have never worked out, she couldn’t help but look at him sometimes and see what might have been. A normal family. No Howlers calling her a pervert or inviting her to a threesome every time someone caught her and Luna snogging. Being out in a society that wasn’t fully ready for it yet was a constant battle, and sometimes she got tired of fighting in it. Hadn’t they all fought enough already?
“I just hope it will help. The first year after losing someone is always the hardest.” Draco sniffed a bit himself. Harry took the books from him, added some extra copies from the piles on the table and put way more money than he owed in the charity box. Some things never changed. Just before he left, Draco grabbed his hand and squeezed it. “I’m sorry for your loss, Harry.”
As for your request to meet, it depends. My professional voice is not my day to day voice. If you feel in any way offended by what I have written in this letter so far, I would say it is best we take it a bit more slowly. Basically, as Pansy calls it, I let my friends know I like them by (not always very) gently bullying them. That part of me will never change. If you feel up for the challenge, I suggest we could stop by at Luna’s cat cafe Wednesday afternoon. I heard their treacle tart is almost adequate.
“You’re a silly man.” Draco shook his head, but his words were spoken with much fondness. He tried to say something else then, but was interrupted by his own yawn.
“Good.” Draco smiled, and Scorpius smiled back. “Now, do you want to look at the orchids with your gran? The ones in greenhouse five are just coming into bloom now.”
“You know you can always reach me when everything else becomes too much, right?” Neville squeezed Draco for a moment, hoping that somehow this time his words would stay in Draco’s memory. Usually, Neville had to come find him on his own when shit got bad. Draco never really believed he deserved the help when his mental state went downhill. “Even when you can’t get out of bed. I’m always here.”
“Mr Malfoy.” He was greeted by a curt nod from Scorpius’ Healer, a man who he’d hoped to never see again. The feeling was mutual, judging by the pity in his eyes. “I’m afraid your son is still in theatre, but if you come into my office I can give you an update on how things are looking right now.”
“Maybe not your younger self,” Harry agreed, “but you aren't him anymore, Draco. You changed. You are someone to be proud of now. Someone to admire.”
“Could I maybe have the name of the tea? The flavour, I mean,” Harry spluttered. “I-, eh, I was actually meant to go shopping yesterday evening, my pantry is empty and the kids are coming to stay with me for a week this afternoon.”
“I’m glad to hear that, son.” Mrs Weasley got up from her chair and held out her hand, squeezing a little when Draco took it. “And I wish Scorpius the very best. I hope he’ll be back on his feet soon.”
“Yeah, yeah, you’re right and I’m wrong. Blah blah blah.” Harry chuckled and pulled him close again, but quickly corrected himself before he kissed him and instead stepped away. Draco let out a tiny sigh of relief. He knew it was wrong of him, but he didn’t want to be as out as Harry was. This entire bisexuality thing was still very new for him, and despite recent progress, a lot of people still had the attitude
if he ever heard that. His aunt and uncle had never been excessive but definitely weren’t shy about corporal punishments, and something like this happening to his kids would not fly with him.
I really do not expect you to write back to me, but I do hope that you will consider listening to some of my advice. Cut off this part of the letter and throw it out if you have to, but I would hate for your progress to be lost. I will communicate with my superiors about getting you a different correspondent. I know I said it was up to you, but I do not think I can continue to write to you like this. In my head that will never be my place. I am so sorry.
Please keep fueling that love for the outdoors. People often do not realise it, and I have not mentioned it so far since you already mentioned going for frequent walks, but being around nature is one of the best and easiest ways to get out of your own head. It is not always enough, in my experience, when emotions are running high.
“Come on then, lets get you to bed.” The strong arms lifted him up, but before they reached the bed, Draco was already sound asleep. For the first time in months, he slept like a baby. Deep, long, and
Hope briefly flared up in Teddy’s chest. Moving was good, wasn’t it? Moving meant waking up. Or at least that’s what he thought it meant, until Pansy sighed deeply and spoke again. Teddy had never heard a voice so broken. “Usually that means the beginning of the end.”
Scorpius was a bit drowsy from the cake and the excitement from before, but Draco didn’t want to put off talking about the fight any longer. He knew himself, he would chicken out of it if he waited any longer. And as his own childhood had been full of unexplained fights between adults, he knew how frustrating that was. Plus, he needed to make sure Scorpius wasn’t blaming himself for anything.
melt when he heard those words, and he certainly didn’t get a dopey smile on his face. “Just don’t throw them out. That’s all there is to it.”
Draco knew Harry was rambling because seeing him like this made him panic, but his words still seemed genuine.
“Draco.” Harry squeezed his hand, making him snap back into the present just in time to hear the Healer’s last words.
Well, except for all the Howlers and random passersby who told him to kill himself, but doing that required at least a little bit of courage, and Draco had none. So he’d applied to become an Auror. It was the only job where they might hire him, since he was one of the few people who knew how to deal with Voldemort’s many cursed objects and traps.
“Looking for some peace and quiet, which I apparently won’t get here.” Malfoy glared at him, a look made a bit less impressive by the ginormous bags under his eyes. Being a coffee shop owner meant he saw his fair share of exhaustion, not to mention all the experience he’d had with Hermione, but this was taking it to the next level.
“You ask me. Or you ask your grandmother, and then we’ll talk about it. But please don’t put on a mask and pretend you’re alright when you’re not. You’re allowed to say no. You’re allowed to not be alright. Do you understand that?”
I wasn’t personally involved in the attack, but I still feel sort of… responsible. Not because I organised it or anything, but because I couldn’t
“Bartender, just came out of the kitchen, hot as hell, amazing messy hair.” His voice sounded almost breathless, which wasn’t odd considering he’d just seen the bartender
After eight years on the force he was still in the same position, to his father’s dismay, working all holidays and other crappy shifts while being left out of the office’s pub nights and their Secret Santa. The only person who talked to him about anything not strictly work related was Potter, though he wasn’t sure why. Probably a Weasley thing, looking after all the strays and lost folks.
“It’s okay, Harry. It’s okay to grieve.” He rubbed Harry’s back and shot an apologetic smile at the woman behind Harry in the queue. She just nodded back at him, full of understanding, and gestured that he should take his time. Apparently not all kindness had left the world yet. “I know it hurts but it will only hurt more if you try to hold it back.”
Harry smiled into his shoulder and squeezed him against his chest. “You just made me the happiest man on earth, Draco.”
I’m not really sure how to go about this. I don’t know who I’m writing to because all the letter gave me was an address and I’ve just got to trust that this finds the right person.
He still did. Ron still kept things running smoothly, helped out where he could, all while managing his household like he was trying to give their mother a run for her money. George hadn’t even had a girlfriend since the war, let alone a wife and kids. Fred at least had Lee in that department.
“Oh don’t act so silly, young man,” she said, making a move to pick Scorpius up again. Scorpius was having none of it though, and flinched away. From that moment forward everything went very fast.
She’d known he would pull through only an hour after arriving at the hospital then though. Quite different from what was happening now. Though her perception of time was a bit off, she knew she must have been waiting for at least five days now. A long time anyway.
“No, love.” Neville kissed Draco’s forehead, and despite the fact that he’d done that many times before, it felt almost wrong now that Draco and Harry were dating. It was stupid, because it didn’t mean anything and Draco obviously took comfort from it, but still. It didn’t sit right. He would have to ask Harry over soon to discuss and possibly apologise over it. “I put it under an isolation charm. Not a heating charm, I know you think that ruins tea.”
“You don’t bother me with your rants. In fact I love your rants, because if you rant then I can do the same. Ginny hated it when I did that. The brooding, the explosions of frustration, the fixation on certain things, she refused to put up with them, and rightfully so. And I do still try to stop doing that, but when it does happen you mind them an awful lot less. I’m nothing if not grateful for that.”
It didn’t take a genius to deduct that nothing had changed. George swallowed with difficulty and sat down on the armrest of Harry’s chair, putting a firm arm around him. “He’s just a bit slow on the uptake. We can’t all be practiced injured coma patients like you, you know?”
pine, thank you very much. And I didn’t nag you.” That last remark got him a death glare from Hermione so strong he physically cowered away. “Okay, maybe I nagged a little. But the ministry was being unreasonable! You can’t just lock a teenager away in a house of nightmares for four years after basically admitting that he’d never voluntarily committed a crime. That’s not fair.”
feel bad, and it was giving him a headache to think about it all. “Stuff in the past. You know what I mean by that. And on occasion I get a little jealous of you.”
“I don’t know, Scorp.” Draco sighed, tension knotting up his stomach. “She shouldn’t be, though, if she is. You did nothing wrong. She might be angry with me though.”
“And a veil to the demon world that’s at its thinnest. That doesn’t help. The scar doesn’t just respond to how I feel.”
and regrets would not get her anywhere. Her bare feet would get her somewhere, namely to Draco’s room, where she would finally have to come to terms with the inevitable. Draco was hurt, badly hurt. She knew that. The internal bleeding had been nothing short of excessive, he’d had over seventeen broken bones, and his heart had, at some point, stopped for a full two minutes. Even if he did wake up, the oxygen shortage might have left him with permanent damage anyway. Draco could wake up with memory loss, or deaf, or blind or without his voice…
“You spoil him, Draco,” his mother criticised after she told the kid to go fetch his coat. Draco rolled his eyes. As if she hadn’t fed him sweets at every opportunity she’d gotten when he was young.
Of course Narcissa was happy to take him, as she made clear while Draco knelt down to give the finishing touches to Scorpius’ braids. It made him look a bit like a girl, but Draco had honestly never cared about that. His father’s rules about being a ‘good man’ were probably just as much bullshit as his rules about being a proper pureblood.
“In my bed. You have a fever and tried to go to work anyway, you idiot. So I took you home. Well, first I got myself fired, then I took you home. I made soup!”
longer than he’d been alive, though he no longer really knew what being alive meant. Not this. He knew it wasn’t this. Everything was terribly blank, not white, just blank. No colour, no light, no darkness, just nothing. It scared him when he tried to think about it, so he mostly avoided it. The only problem was, that apart from the lack of
“No, no, Potter. I’ll do it.” He’d only been teasing Harry. In fact he rather liked his chill work schedule now that it meant he could play stay-at-home-dad with Harry and occasionally Ron. Which reminded him that if he wanted some entertainment, he could always send the four kids to the Granger-Weasley’s with a jar of glitter and watch the chaos unfold. He held out his arms and beckoned Harry to come closer. “Kiss.”
And with that, she turned away from him and marched into Draco Malfoy’s room. Kingsley was left baffled. No one had ever talked to him like that, even if it hadn’t been about him. But then again, no one would send the partner of a coma patient away from their lover, yet that was exactly what Miss Parkinson did, as he could see through the window.
That is not to say that you should not try out other things however, because sometimes writing doesn’t help, or it is not enough, or you just need a change of pace. In that case, like I said, a talk group or an immersive hobby (one of my friends does free diving in her spare time. It is a muggle thing where you dive with just you and your swimsuit and nothing else) can really help. Be careful what you choose though. Having a risky hobby combined with a fluctuating mental state can go wrong fast. My tip: don’t get into wine tasting, it does not end well.
“I still think your mother should leave that place. It’s too big for her; too many bad memories.” Andy shook her head. “I told her she can come live with me, but something is stopping her. Fear of change, maybe.”
“It’s not a bad sign?” Teddy and Parkinson asked in unison. They were competing for the title of pulling the most shocked, surprised and carefully hopeful face. Ginny almost laughed at the sight, but the pain in her heart stopped her. The hope in the faces of the three people next to her was so pure and so painfully desperate she couldn’t possibly laugh anymore when she saw that.
Tears dripped down his face onto their joined hands. It would be a beautiful moment for Draco to open his eyes, awoken by the magic of Harry’s tears, but of course, such things only happened in fairy tales. “I’ve been so selfish. If I think the general public is more important than everyone I love, then I shouldn’t get so close to my loved ones. I shouldn’t have gotten so close to you if that only brings you pain, since I insist on getting hurt all the time. It’s not fair. I should have made a choice ages ago, and I should have chosen
“We’ve talked about this, Draco. It’s not your fault. There isn’t a single turn in your life that you could have taken differently that would have stopped all this. Choosing different would have cost you your parents, your friends, your
She couldn’t cope with the thought. What would happen if she had to deal with the real thing? at the very least the legal department would collapse. She’d joked with Harry that she could make it illegal for Draco to die, but as the days ticked by, that almost became a solid option in her mind. It felt like it was the only thing she could do right now, even though it wouldn’t actually stop Draco from dying obviously.
Worried, she quickened her pace and passed the sleeping form of her wife on the waiting room couch in favour of seeing what was going on. So far she’d never really thought all that much about Malfoy’s condition. Weeds were hard to kill, he’d be alright soon enough. But in the hectics of her training schedule she’d lost track of time, and with a shock, she realised Malfoy had been in a coma for nearly three weeks now. That, together with the crying and the presence of the ever busy businesswoman Pansy Parkinson, did not bode well.
I have never been more grateful for my best friend when she came over one day, found me staring at the bathtub, and decided that things had to change. She has never been one for patience, so the next day she had gathered all of my friends and together they redecorated the entire place, painted over cabinets, changed the wallpaper, made a better guest room, wider windows, a proper kitchen, the works.
One glance at his guest changed his mind though. Draco was somehow both deadly pale and red in the face, the sharp contrast just making him look more unhealthy. His nose was so red it was almost glowing.
Draco was incredibly touched that Harry remembered what did and didn’t help when he was crying. The last time they’d talked about that was two years ago.
At least that’s what he figured happened when he woke up many many hours later, just past two AM with the Weasley matriarch asleep next to him in a family room of the hospital. He couldn’t recall much. Just some talking between him and little Rosie, and an idea… that probably didn’t work. But he didn’t remember trying it, so maybe…
Draco let himself get dragged away by his son after a quick smile in Harry’s direction. It turned out that the orchid really was worth all the excitement. The light blue and white petals emitted a soft, almost hypnotic glow. Draco knew that was their purpose; passing animals and humans would stop in their tracks to look, and most never left after that. It was how the orchid got its food.
Draco shook his head. “She wanted to leave that place before Astoria fell ill. But now… I can come back there, whenever I like, whenever I need it and I can tell her to leave because I can find my own place but she won’t listen to me.” He chuckled. “She never listens to anyone. Last time I tried she told me,
“Because I felt like I had to. You came back so upset yesterday, and you never did tell me what happened.” His mother pulled him close the way only mothers could, and Draco both hated and loved it. The hug made him feel vulnerable, but also safe enough to fall apart and still come out alright. “You don’t have to tell me now, but if you want to get it off your chest….”
Draco was still head of their potions department, even if it was more symbolic at this point because he rarely had the time to fulfil the position. For someone still so shunned by society, he’d made himself quite indispensable in just a handful of years.
Somehow I am not surprised to learn that you are hot-headed. I was too, back at Hogwarts, and my situation sounds quite similar to yours. I am not proud of the fact that I never apologised either. I wrote maybe one hundred of apology letters, but I never had the courage to send them.
“I need new friends.” Draco glared at Pansy and took a more careful sip of his beer. “And we’re not getting married. I don’t think I can string two words together if I ever get face to face with him.”
I am glad you do not regret writing these letters so far. I… do not know what to say now that I read who you are. Congratulations Potter, you got me speechless. Pansy would be proud. She would also laugh at my shocked face.
, Draco Malfoy, depressed widower and father of a troubled five-year-old, to be his boyfriend. But Harry had said something else. Something more.
Did he? Did he still have Harry? They’d been dating for a little over a year now, though it felt much longer because they’d gotten so close so fast. But he had just stormed out on him and his family after insulting someone who was basically his mother. He doubted Harry would take kindly to that. Plus, he knew that Harry wanted to be a lot more ‘out’ than him. They’d had some arguments about that in the past month.
But his mother just smiled at him, and turned to Scorpius when the little guy ran into the room, his coat firmly around his shoulders. “Hey, my prince. You ready to go home with your Daddy?”
“I’ve never found it to be very healthy to live for others instead of yourself,” he said eventually, when the silence became unbearable for him. “Your self worth shouldn’t be determined by what other people need from you. Even as a parent.”
an update that's actually on Sunday evening like i said it would be! thanks to Saphira for reminding me<3
I’m already looking forward to your next letter. (Am I allowed to ask you questions about your life?
around him. Just thoughts too fleeting to leave an impression, memories just out of reach, sensory input that wasn’t there.
“Oh, stop trying to dig yourself out of a hole, Potter. It’s not your strong suit.” Draco shook his head, balling up his frustration at his life and filing it away for later. It technically wasn’t Potter’s fault that he was lonely, even if the man did keep making him painfully aware of the fact. He ignored Potter’s invitation, it probably wasn’t sincere anyway. “I know why I’m alone during the holidays and it’s not because I’m busy with exams.”
“Then maybe ask for his number?” Pansy pushed her sunglasses to the tip of her nose and let out a whistle. “Holy Hell, Draco. You weren’t wrong, that guy can eat me for breakfast, lunch and dinner.”
“My mother has a tendency to make people see sense.” A smile crept onto his face as he thought of the woman. “I’m glad she had the same effect on you. And it’s up to Scorpius, of course, but if you show you’re making changes then I can put this all behind me.”
“Thank you,” Draco said as he rose from his chair and shook hands with the Healer. Black spots danced in his field of vision, and he was glad when Harry quickly escorted him back to the hallway. In all the commotion he’d forgotten to have lunch and it was showing now.
“Shhhh, it’s okay. I’ll come visit you for lunch if you’d like?” Harry hugged Draco closer, noticing once again that his fever was quite high. “But I think you need to take some potions first, Draco. Eat something. I can’t take you out for lunch if you die.”
They were at the hospital in less than ten minutes. Though once the knight bus had been full of passengers in the early hours, now there were none. The latest extensions and extra safety check of the floo network had been quite effective. Lucky for them the bus driver asked no questions after Teddy morphed him into a stern looking older brother or young dad, depending on which way you looked.
She approached Harry’s booth and carefully set Aurora down beside him. “Harry, this is Aurora. She likes to play with string,” she said, dropping a length of red wool onto the table before walking away to tidy the cups.
loving in a way his own childhood had never been. But wasn’t he projecting himself on Scorp in the same harmful way Lucius had done with him if he did that? Was he repeating his father’s mistakes
“Oh I hate you.” Draco let go of Harry and went to pout on the other side of the bed. “You’re really fucking annoying, Potter.”
“As long as Scorpius is still in theatre, you’re allowed to be a mess.” Harry pressed a kiss to Draco’s temple and began walking him in the direction of what Draco guessed would be Scorpius’ room. “I’ll get you settled and then I’ll grab you something to eat, alright?”
It is certainly a good choice to tell me who you are if you think that would ease or even erase your anxiety about talking to me, although even if I would be able to guess from your information who you are, I would never use that against you or assume things about you that I know from outside of this letter exchange. It is part of my job not to do that, and I feel like it would be rude to you if I broke that rule.
“No he doesn’t.” Draco sighed and tried to look at anything other than Ginny’s fiery eyes. “There are a lot of things in this world Scorpius doesn’t deserve but gets anyway.”
Draco chuckled and shot Scorpius a proud smile when he successfully pronounced darjeeling. “Because you ask so nicely, yes.”
, though he wasn’t really sure what that something was. His head was spinning, thoughts buzzing, even though he had zero sensory input. For all he knew he no longer had a head. It was confusing, but above all else, it was frustrating because he knew there was
“Go tell him that, then.” Ron shoved him again, harder this time, with his elbow. “Don’t just sit here crying like some sorry Hufflepuff.”
Draco thought it was that voice in combination with his mother’s firm back rubs that stopped his hands from shaking in the end, and not the calming draught. He briefly allowed himself to melt into his mother’s arms and let out a few sobs. “You said that when Astoria fell ill. When Scorpius…”
Luna didn’t mind the odd look, she was used to getting those. She was not, however, used to her old schoolmates using her cafe as a meeting place. She had a feeling that neither Harry or the person he was meeting would pay her cats any attention whatsoever, and that made her sad. Her cats were the perfect matchmakers in her opinion.
“If Scorpius is okay with it,” Harry blurted before Draco could even finish asking. “My kids have been calling you their second dad for a while now. I’m surprised you didn’t notice.”
Draco’s arms tightened around Neville for a moment, before he pulled back and looked at him. His grey eyes were a bit red-rimmed, but to Neville’s delight, he was smiling too. “I don’t want to know what would happen if I didn’t have you as a friend, Neville.”
is written for teenagers and adults but it is kid friendly. It discusses celebrating things like Christmas and birthdays without the one you lost. And all books have an audio CD, because sometimes it can be difficult to read out loud.”
“Want another cup of coffee then?” Harry gestured at the empty mug on the table, trying to remain professional. He would rather ask Malfoy a million different questions, like why he was so tired, why he came to look for peace and quiet
One too many time I have seen people die just because they could not get over the shame to ask for help, or the idea that they were not worth it, or that they did not want to bother people. And by one too many times, I mean I have seen all of my friends hurt themselves by
“Don’t worry, I’ll bring him.” Draco promised with a small smile. And he would. He wouldn’t fail to show up to the Burrow or Harry’s home and the many festivities held there for years to come. First as friend and father, then as blushing date, confident boyfriend, and eventually happy husband. He had never once failed his promise to Astoria, to live each day like there was no tomorrow, to learn how to love himself, to raise their son to be a good lad and a splendid father once his time came.
Though he might be partially responsible for the whole busy schedule thing. He could have kept working as an editor for that potions magazine without starting a degree at a muggle university on the side, but he hadn’t. The menial, low effort spelling and fact-checking drove him mental. He needed a distraction, and this had been the only option he could think of.
The list was endless, and it was at the very least partially her fault. That realisation dawned on her even more as she arrived in the right wing and spotted the first Weasley curled up and asleep on an old waiting room couch. It was Fred, or George, she could never tell the two apart even now that one of them was missing an ear. It went to show her negligence that Draco had been surrounded by Weasleys but not by her.
Screaming into a pillow can also help, though I would like you to write down what it was exactly what made you feel that way. I do not need to read that (though of course you are more than welcome to tell me), but you do need to get it off your chest.
“What? No, I can’t do that!” Draco shot a horrified look at his best friend. “With a face like that he’s
And I hoped you guys enjoyed this new chapter, please conciser leaving kuddos or a comment if you did<3
You’re right, it never helped to be told to take a step back and breathe when I was at school, nevermind now. It had the opposite effect, and I know I’ve always been hot headed but I can’t help that. I’d like to think I got better as I got older but then the attack happened and showed me that I’m maybe not as good at controlling myself as I thought I was.
I don’t scream into a pillow very often anymore. Not since I got my own house. Now I can just scream without fear of being clipped round the head for making a racket. Living alone has its benefits I suppose.
Draco let out a humourless chuckle. No, the Gryffindors had put their hand over their heart when it came to his dark mark, but he doubted they would do so again when they found out their best friend was dating a common street whore. And then he choked out a sob, because even after five years of having a proper job he still didn’t feel any better than his lowest moment in life.
He’d be lying if he said he didn’t use to despise the entitled git, but it was hard to hate someone who worked so hard for redemption. Especially because Draco always said he wasn’t looking for redemption, he was just trying to be less of a dick.
. And you can keep the coffee. It was average at best, definitely not good enough to have to see your face each time I drink it.”
“This!” Draco gestured between them. “That you’re dead set on not liking me and I still want to insult you like the old days but I can’t because you’re annoyingly cute! That’s really fucking stupid, Potter.”
“Well it’s true.” Draco was fighting to keep the pout on his face now as Harry moved closer and tried to drag him back under the duvet. He really shouldn’t be behaving like this. He was thirty one years old, not three. Yet he was enjoying himself too much to call it quits. Normal parenting was stressful, but parenting a five year old on your own after losing his mother to a horrible curse was even worse. He was always worried and on edge and scared something might happen and
I don’t really swear too often but sometimes it’s an easier outlet than letting my magic flare up. There’s something therapeutic about screaming curse words out loud. I try not to get too stuck in my head, but around anniversaries it’s hard. Those dates are burned into my mind and I can’t help feeling angry all over again that people died.
“Thank you.” Draco rose to his feet and shook the Healer’s hand. It was the last thing he did, before he almost took off running back to his son. He still found it ridiculous that Scorpius, just because he was a child, never got any kind of explanation about what was going on. As if he didn’t have the right to  know what was going on in his own body. It wasn’t even that hard to explain.
“Well you better start believing it.” Draco replied as he draped his blankets over Harry as well. “Because I wasn’t planning on leaving any time soon.”
still taking walks though, so don’t worry about me becoming a recluse (as tempting as it is sometimes). I like the outdoors too much to confine myself to my house. Plus, sometimes, it’s too big and empty for me to stay there.
“Ey, don’t kiss the messenger.” Harry chuckled and pulled Draco into a quick one armed hug. “I’m just doing the donkey work.”
“Scorpius?” Draco asked. He sat on the floor next to the couch his son was on. That way he wasn’t towering over him. “Can you tell me what happened before you asked Mrs Weasley to let you go? I promise I’m not angry, I’m just curious.”
“I’ll ask Mippy to send some tea over to your home, Harry.” Draco’s mother rose from her chair and walked around the table. She hugged Harry once he got up. A proper, warm, non-pureblood hug which she’d developed a knack for since the end of the war. Draco and Scorpius immediately joined in line to get one too. There was nothing quite like the hug of a mother. “Have a good shopping trip, boys.”
. Which was a welcome but very confusing and big distraction. How was he supposed to explain things to the man the next morning?
A few seconds later, the bell over the door chimed again and Luna glanced up once more. Her eyes twinkled as she saw Draco making his way towards Harry’s booth, confirming her suspicions. As he sat down, he immediately reached a hand out to Aurora and Luna smiled again. She knew that Aurora had been the perfect cat for the job, given that Draco owned her cousin.
Draco nodded, and had his arms open for Harry to bury himself in before the man even leaned forward. They landed in tangles on the bed, nearly hitting Scorpius. Draco carefully shifted them onto safer territory, his parenting side shortly taking over as he transfigured their day clothes into pyjamas and pulled the covers over them. He’d gotten an expert at those spells, given that Astoria couldn’t change out of her clothes near the end. At least that skill had some use now.
“Draco, I get it. Stop stressing.” Harry took a hold of his hands and looked at him. “You need tea, and then you need a Healer update, and then you’re off to bed in the same room where they’ll put Scorpius after he’s out of surgery, okay? And stress isn’t part of any of those steps.”
“Nothing,” Draco lied. Harry immediately gave him a pointed look. Even to him this was clearly a lie. “I’m just-, someone reminded me Scorpius will grow up without a mum. I have you, I still have someone to hold on to but he doesn’t.”
another sixth year bathroom situation? Maybe Draco was allergic to the carrots in the soup, or the healing potion, or he was diabetic and about to go into shock, or-
“I wish we could do this every week.” Harry mimicked his sigh as he lazily intertwined their fingers. “Just one day. We don’t have to do anything, don’t even have to eat together, just sleep in the same bed once a week. I know you don’t want anything to do with dating, and I’m totally okay with that, but I just miss you.”
I must admit, I’ve cried a couple more times thinking about the tapestry story. I never would have thought about life like that if it hadn’t been for you, but it makes so much sense. Crying was always something I was punished for as a child, so I’ve probably not done it as much as I should have in the past. I’ve definitely done it more in recent years for various reasons.
I’ve always been very careful not to reveal magic to Muggles - while living with my aunt and uncle it was impossible. My wand and school books were always locked away where I couldn’t get them (it’s a miracle I passed any classes). Although in second year, a house elf almost outed me as a wizard to my uncle’s boss - something I paid dearly for later, even though I’d had no idea that the house elf was there and when I did, I tried to stop him from using magic. I did have to use my Patronus in the summer between fourth and fifth year to save my cousin’s life (I might not have liked him, but he didn’t deserve a Dementor’s Kiss) and almost got expelled. I think I was lucky that he knew about magic and that there were no other Muggles around.
That does not, however, take away the fact that I am no longer your therapist, no matter how much I might still sound like it. That is just my standard way of ranting these days. With our shared past, I cannot offer you that help. If you want to get some good, proper help, and for the love of Merlin, Potter, please tell me that you do, you need to be able to talk freely about everything in your life. Even if that is about how annoying your ginger friend can be sometimes, or why that stupid blond git always tried to ruin your life back in school.
mental illness, Draco. Knows it much better than I do, I’m sure. And even if he didn’t, he wants you to be happy, ey? If it was up to him, he’d wrap you up in a million blankets and keep you safe from all the evils in the world. That’s just how he is.”
Watching out of the corner of her eye, she could see the bemused expression on Harry’s face turn to amusement as he picked up the string and Aurora immediately pounced for it. The ragdoll cat was one of the youngest in the cafe, but she was also one of the most empathetic. Luna smiled as she sensed Harry’s nerves disappearing.
“I’ve made some tea, lads.” Neville had entered the living room and put the tray down on the coffee table. He wasn’t really sure what to do with himself now.
“It wasn’t really that big a deal.” Draco sighed, figuring that it was best to get it over with now. “Mrs Weasley was holding Scorpius and he wanted her to let go. She didn’t, he screamed, I barged in and made a mess of the whole thing. I was trying to make her see that consent is just as much a thing for kids as for adults, but I was angry and she felt attacked and now we left in a fight. And then I met Percy Weasley today, who took his mother’s side and started the whole argument again, and before that I met Ginny who is on my side and now I’m scared I’ve caused a rift in a family I’m not even part of.”
“Your brain is a chemical mess right now, it needs help to recover.” Neville carefully pushed on when Draco didn’t immediately reject the idea. “You’d go to a Healer if you broke your legs. You’d get glasses when your eyes are shit. Why should getting help for your mental health be any different?”
And with that, he slammed the door shut and stalked back to his old desk. Probably for the last time.
Neville shot Draco a look, before getting up from the couch and quickly throwing a nearby blanket over his friend. Not because he was trying to hide Draco, but because leaving him to sit on his own like that, even if it was just for a moment, just felt wrong. At least this way he’d stay warm. Plus, well, he didn’t want the man behind the door to think that’s he’d been anything short of welcoming and understanding to Draco.
“Yes!” Scorp’s face lit up with excitement and he jumped off the couch, happy to leave the heavy conversation behind. Draco was relieved to see him bounce up like that. He would hate for his son to have a setback again. “Will I see you at dinner?”
Somehow her feet brought her to the nursery ward, and her mind was flooded with memories of Hugo’s birth. The little guy had come nearly five weeks early, and much faster than Rose. The head had already been crowning when Draco had found her in the ministry bathroom in so much pain she hadn’t managed to send for help. She didn’t like to think of what would have happened if she hadn’t always been incredibly punctual on their lunch dates. Draco might not have gone looking for her, and Hugo might have died.
as a rock, because he’s small, and he’s going through this whole process again and that must be so scary for him. He’ll be absolutely terrified without his father by his side.”
“I know, Draco. I know. I miss her too.” His mother pulled him closer and pressed a kiss to the side of his head. “But you didn’t lose Scorpius. And whatever just happened, I’m sure you’re making it far worse in your head. You’ve always had a flair for the dramatic.”
But he cut Harry off again. “Nope. I won’t hear it. Unless it starts to get unhealthy I won’t hear it, and you are so far away from that point that you’re not even allowed to think of it.”
“Oh, shut your trap, Harry.” Draco rolled his eyes. “But thanks. It’s good to know I don’t bother you too much with my rants.”
“That’s what Harry calls it.” Draco’s voice was small, almost inaudible. When Neville began to prepare the tea and Draco spoke again, he almost didn’t hear it because of that. “Not sure I’ll hear him say that again.”
Draco was baffled. That was not the response he thought he’d get. Quite the opposite, in fact. He remained baffled and silent as Harry excused them to his friends, walked them outside and apparated them to his flat. It wasn’t until after Draco’s third cup of milky tea and the wrapping of several blankets around him, that he began to talk. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner.”
I was involved, quite heavily, in the war a few years ago and I thought I’d come out of it quite well. I had nightmares, of course, but nothing more. I thought I’d managed to move on but recently I witnessed a, quite frankly, horrific incident while I was walking in Muggle London and it brought back all the memories that I’d suppressed. I couldn’t do anything to help, and that made me angry. It was the kind of anger I’ve not felt in a long time, and if I’m honest, it scared me.
. It wasn’t fair that Draco was dying, wasn’t fair that he kept having his hopes crushed, wasn’t fair that while fighting to keep everyone safe he’d forgotten about the one person who mattered the most.
tea. Something told her that she needed to be at the hospital tonight. As soon as she realised that, she slipped out of bed and quickly got dressed before Flooing to St Mungo’s. She knew the way like she knew her broom. She was friends with Harry after all.
Draco looked sideways and raised an eyebrow, putting on his sarcastic Malfoy Mask to hide his emotions. “You had too much wine during dinner, didn't you?”
“I try,” Draco whispered, sadness tugging at his soul as he watched his son. “It's not easy, being Draco Malfoy's son.”
Of course he knew Scorpius wasn’t the brat he himself used to be, but he still got spoiled, he was still equally well-mannered and all things Muggle-made him uncomfortable so Draco didn’t expose him to them. Now, that wasn’t the same as teaching him blood purity, but being a Malfoy, people would always have their prejudice ready to dish out to him. If the public and even the Weasleys kept seeing him as a smaller version of Draco, and with that a smaller version of what Lucius had been, wouldn’t Scorpius be pushed into the same mould as Draco had been? If he didn’t actively teach him about equality and Muggles, wouldn’t he automatically turn into a blood supremacist just because other people saw him like that? Draco knew like no other how easy it was to turn into the person people expected you to be.
Draco hadn’t been postponing this. He really hadn’t been, with his final exams coming up and Harry bloody Potter having one of his most vital books for a good grade. It would make no sense to postpone, so he hadn’t. There just only happened to be a large enough gap in his planning to see Potter two weeks after the man had reached out to him.
I will not deny that reading about how your tapestry looks made a big impact on me. A life starting in the dark, especially for such a long time, needs a lot of light later on to make up for that, and it sounds like so far you have not gotten that. I was beyond happy to read that my letters have helped add colour, but I do want to tell you again that, apart from trying to get better yourself, friends are also a massive part of adding that colour.
But Scorpius had already lost his mother, plus he had his hospital trauma and he was only five years old. It wouldn’t be fair to teach him such heavy things already. On the other hand, in a little under a month he’d turn six, and Draco couldn’t let it wait until he was going off to Hogwarts…
He stayed like that for a while. Seconds, months, he did not know. The words kept coming but he couldn’t decipher if they increased or decreased. It probably didn’t matter. He still had nothing to cling to and the one thing he did know was that the Heaviness kept getting bigger. So much so it made him want to give up. He wanted to relax into it and just let go. Maybe he would soon. The Words didn’t scare him anymore, not even the one that said Death. At least Death didn’t sound so Heavy.
He did care about his grades and his internship, that wasn’t what he meant, but everything else in his life could fuck off for all he cared. His sense of fashion, keeping his flat somewhat clean, not drinking juice straight out of the bottle or having dinner with ice cream. Or his friends for that matter.
“Yes please!” Scorpius nodded enthusiastically and took his hand. Draco had to duck a bit as he got up in order not to pull his kid off the ground, but he was used to that by now. He’d been a single parent for nearly two years. Some days were hard, some days felt nearly impossible, but every day was rewarding. “Can I have dar-jee-ling, Daddy?”
Draco loved Harry. It was an odd moment to realize that, but he did. He did and he told him too, as he clung at his chest. His legs fell asleep under Harry’s weight while his mind woke up, fog clearing away until he was fully aware of what he was doing once again. Which was whispering apologies between
“I’ll ask him if he feels up to telling you himself, okay?” Neville turned around to ask, only to discover that a blanket-wrapped Draco Malfoy was standing right behind him, with the purest,
“It’s okay to let it out, love. It’s okay to feel it.” Narcissa’s breathing was so erratic that she could barely make out the words, but the sentiment in them already felt nice. Like an anchor stopping her from completely spiraling out of control.
“Alright,” his mouth replied before his head had made up its mind. Nerves immediately pooled in his stomach, but they were squashed down by the genuinely delighted look he received from Potter. “But
And if he studied eight hours a day and worked another six, then there wasn’t much time left to think about how everything had gone to shit. He honestly preferred it that way.
At least, if Draco would accept the help. If he wouldn’t keep insisting he was fine, brush it off as nothing. Neville didn’t know what he’d do if that happened. Despair, probably. Fear for Draco’s life. Worry to death about everything that might be going wrong.
But it took a long time before Draco and Neville finally came to that point. Neville was no stranger to the relief of crying, but it seemed Draco had been building up to this moment for years, like there were decades worth of hurt to claw through before he could find any sort of relief. So Neville held him. He held him and he said a million soothing things in the hope of getting through to the man. A million reasons why Draco was strong. A million reasons why life was still worth it. A million reasons why it was okay to break down and cry and not feel okay.
He was pulled out of his thoughts by the greeting of his brother. Despite their age difference, he felt so much younger than Ron. Like he was back in the ruins of Hogwarts, trying his best to run from the reality around him rather than helping anyone. He’d been shocked, then, when he saw Ron give instructions, help out, keep a clear head as the smoke of battle cleared. He’d looked then like the adult George couldn’t be even now.
you work harder for it. But my family will not hate you for believing and doing dumb things as a kid. They believe in second chances, and you never really had a fair first.”
“Shut! Up! Harry!” Draco abruptly sat up, grabbed a pillow and began to beat Harry’s laughing form with it. “It’s! Not! Funny!” he said as he emphasised every word with a blow. “I’m traumatized for life! I will never have sex again now that she said that!”
spend the rest of his life trying to make up for past mistakes, trying to become someone else, someone better. There was a reason why he hadn’t joined his mother in France, started a Potion’s degree, and left everything behind. He had to prove to himself more than anyone else, that he could change, that he could be a good person even after royally fucking up.
Draco sighed, guilt laying heavy on his chest. “I’m sorry for storming out. And for yelling at Mrs Weasley.”
Do not apologise for there not being any rhyme or reason to your letters. They are actually quite coherent compared to the horror I sometimes get from my friends (they tend to write while drunk) and it is not like my letters are perfectly ordered. They could be, I followed about a million courses on calligraphy, handwriting, grammar and psychology, but so far the response has been a lot better when I write like this. And I am happy to hear that you have no intention of stopping, though please do feel free to change your mind once you know who I am.
But anyway, it didn’t matter what any of them thought. He was going to break out and see Draco and he was going to do so right now. Or at least right after he talked himself into getting on the broom he’d nicked from the shed near the quidditch dressing rooms. He wasn’t that much of a flyer, if he was being honest.
, but it would be nice if they actually were genuine. Draco had never properly dated anyone before. He couldn’t say he had close friends either. He’d tried to reconnect with Pansy and Blaise but after everything that had happened it just didn’t work out. He’d changed too much. And his colleagues liked him alright, but it wasn’t really anything proper.
“Then why are you telling me now?” Harry felt himself begin to panic. This was rather a lot to take in and now he might be hurting Draco? He didn’t want that, but what if not wanting it made Draco feel unwelcome? But how could he feel welcome in the life of someone who wanted to hurt him? A question that made him panic more because Draco had just said that he felt welcome after Harry had caused him pain.
Draco let out a long groan but failed to help when he was dragged to his feet. One featherlight charm later he was carried in someone’s arms. Potter’s arms, probably. Draco’s fever brain couldn’t process that, and he conked out indefinitely on Potter’s shoulder. A bit of rest, peace and quiet was honestly the best Christmas present he’d gotten in a very long time.
“I wish you really were that confident about yourself,” Harry said as he rested his chin on Draco’s chest and looked up at him. “I mean, you say the words, but I know you don’t believe them. Which is stupid, because they are true.”
Many thoughts whirled around his head as he tried and failed to fall asleep. He’d been too impulsive again, he should have called someone who actually knew Draco. Someone like Parkinson or his mother. Oh god what if they were worried sick? Would Robarts be petty enough to tell anyone who asked that Draco had gone missing, instead of that Harry had taken him home? And what if he did tell the truth and Parkinson thought it was another sixth year bathroom situation? What if it
“But he did get you as a father, and that makes up for a lot of it.” Ginny reached out for him again, forcing him to look up. Or down actually, as the redhead was quite a lot shorter than he was. Somehow she still made it feel like looking up. “You did the right thing, with my mum. And you’re doing the right thing with raising Scorpius. Harry and I learn from you every day, and so do our kids. He picked a good one with you.”
“Eh, hi, I’m Harry.” Now that Harry was suddenly up close, Draco was too shocked to do anything but stare into his gorgeous green eyes. Despite Pansy’s warning, he couldn’t be sure he wasn’t drooling. At least Harry blushed as well, though with his dark complexion he was less obvious about it. “I normally don’t do this, but my co-workers egged me on, and I was near the end of my shift anyway, so, eh, hi. I’m Harry, and I already said that, sorry. How are you?
“Can I stay with Grandma, Dad?” Scorpius asked as they went to take their leave. Draco’s son had never been a great fan of crowds, and as it was Saturday, Diagon Alley would be packed.
“I’m going to the lav,” he murmured to no one in particular before pulling his hand free from Harry’s and climbing out of the booth. He needed cold water in his face and a moment of peace and quiet.
“There’s the man I love.” Harry chuckled. “And don’t worry, I’ll ask Ron for food. Knowing him, he’ll already have seven turkeys in the oven. You know how he gets when he’s stressed, especially when someone’s in the hospital.”
But Draco stayed as he was, breathing in and out, with no change in sight. Maybe it was time for Harry to accept that.
As for being offended by your last letter, please. I don’t think you’ve ever offended me (aside from once or twice) and even if you have, I’m not easily put off.
“Not as far as I know.” Ginny shrugged, trying not to put too much confidence in her words. She didn’t want to crush anyone’s hopes. “But I’m no expert, you’ll have to ask a nurse.”
You do not have to talk to them about your bad days, about the times when things feel shit, about your mental health issues. You can keep things light and happy, just as long as you make sure there are
“I’m sure it’s not that bad, Draco. And if it is, then that’s the drama caused by them, caused by friction already in the family, and that is out of your control. You stood your ground on a very important topic and you should be proud of yourself, not doubt yourself.” His mother squeezed him once before letting go. “Besides, I doubt Harry will agree if you tell him you think you’re not a part of his family. In fact, I might just tell him to see how he responds.”
“I’ll get right to it, then.” The Healer clasped his hands together after sitting down, and looked at Draco over the edge of his gold rimmed glasses. He looked older than the world itself, though he’d always talked and acted with an amount of energy that made Draco jealous. Often just being near the man made him feel even more exhausted. “As you know, his curse is a nasty piece of work. We thought we had it under control and cut off from all energy supplies, and all of our check ups backed that up, but somehow the magic acted faster than we thought it could. Somewhere in the last couple of days the curse latched onto the natural magic of your son and fed on it until it was powerful enough to resurface. We’re trying everything we can right now to once again cut it off from any kind of magical energy, but it’s a tricky surgery given how potent your son’s natural magic is. Which is why, as we speak, my colleagues are trying to lull Scorpius’ magic to sleep.”
“You are to Scorpius,” Harry said, suddenly sounding quite serious. “He adores you, Draco, and for good reason. You’re a brilliant dad, no matter what you think or what anyone else tells you. Why won’t you get that through your thick skull, you bastard?”
“Draco?” The footsteps came to a halt. Someone brushed a lock of hair out of his face. “Did you fall asleep? Your fever rose, I can tell you that much. Come on, we’ll use the emergency floo, it’ll only be a couple steps.”
Harry didn't immediately reply to that. At least not with words. First he pulled Draco into an even fiercer hug, before explaining, “I never see you open up to anyone. You just swallow everything down and put your son before everything else. And that's hard, I know that because I do it too, but you have so much more to swallow. I had an amicable divorce, you lost your wife. James is a bit too excited sometimes, Scorpius lived in the hospital for nearly a year. You just take it all in your stride and just seeing that makes me want to do even better. And seeing you open up like this and let some stuff out, that just makes me love you more. Don't apologise for that.”
A child deserved settled down parents who could handle the responsibility. Draco, with his mental health struggles and history of self harm, just didn’t think he was ready yet. He’d even been scared Harry would leave him for that. Which was obviously the most ridiculous thought Draco had ever had. If anything it just made Harry more determined to love him and make a family once they were both ready.
Neville pressed the blond flat against his chest like he could squeeze the depression out of him, before silently leaving the pair alone. They could get changed on their own, and Neville had a pretty decent couch. He’d just changed into his pyjamas and checked on his succulent when Draco came back out of his bedroom, nearly drowning in Neville’s oversized clothes.
Anyhow, comments and kudos are of course very welcome and loved and they feed my writer's soul, and if you have a character idea for a POV, then pls let me know in the comments. I can't promise anything, but maybe I'll get inspired!
Neville took a deep breath, placing his hands on the cool kitchen counter while he closed his eyes. It was alright, Draco had come to him, he hadn’t done anything stupid. Plus, he had Harry and Luna and plenty of other people around him. It was going to be alright.
Whatever the fuck I am to you now is for you to decide. I did request you write back in a friendly capacity, you idiot, so no, I will not say yes to your request to please keep writing to you, since
“I’m alright,” Scorpius piped up, trying his best to make his voice sound full instead of cracked from exhaustion and narcotics. “‘M just tired.”
, he didn’t understand how this man could love him when he still felt like a shell of his past self. But apparently, Harry could. “Harry, I think I’ve loved you for years.”
What helps me in those moments, is to remember that moving on, is not as simple as turning the page of a book, as starting a new chapter. A human life is not a linear story, it is more like a tapestry.
“When Mr Potter is around, there is always a reason for hope, Miss Parkinson,” Kingsley said, hoping that his words would offer the woman some comfort. But instead, she whipped her head around and glared at him, eyes ablaze with fury.
George gripped Harry even tighter in return. “Yes you can Harry.” He swallowed heavily, blinked, and then blinked again. “I know you can.”
“I’m fine.” He scraped his throat a couple of times before he spoke again. Harry squeezed his hand under the table, and the gesture brought tears to his eyes. This had been bound to happen at some point, but it didn’t mean he had to like it. “It’s just, I used to work here, and I wasn’t in a very good place at the time. It just brings back memories.”
“Because he’s a fighter, that son of yours.” Harry squeezed his shoulders, trying to get him to look at him. Draco stubbornly kept his face in the crook of Harry’s neck though. He didn’t want to face the world, he didn’t want all of this to happen again, he didn’t want to lose his son.
After about half an hour of waiting, his mother arrived at the hospital, delivering some much needed pyjamas and Scorpius’ well loved stuffed niffler. She also brought a firm hug and some comforting words, though she refused to stay in the room and wait with them when Draco asked her. “Scorpius doesn’t need three people at his bedside, it’ll only overwhelm the little man. Plus, I have other things to do. Scorpius will do just fine with just his dads in the room.”
It is nice that writing things down helps you, since it is one of the easiest ways to put some distance between you and whatever the thing is you are writing about. Some of my friends found it did nothing for them, and though the alternatives that they found, like talking groups or some very peculiar hobbies, did help them, a piece of parchment and a quill are usually easier to find.
“It does.” Harry murmured, still just as far from sleep as Draco was. Their thoughts would be racing for quite some time to come, but processing things savely in each other’s arms meant sleep would come at some point, while nightmares would not. They never had nightmares together.
“What, a brilliant man who learned from his mistakes and turned into an amazing and thoughtful person?” Harry pulled him close again, resting their heads together. “Draco, you’re not teaching Scorpius your mistakes or your past racism, you’re teaching him how to self-reflect; how to always keep improving; how to be a compassionate and kind man. If he grows up to be like you he’ll turn out to be amazing. Now stop worrying so much about him. He’s doing great.”
“Draco, you’re here!” Harry climbed out of the booth as soon as he caught sight of Draco and wrapped him up in a warm hug. Draco was glad it only lasted half a second, otherwise he might have cried. His trip down memory lane from the night before had left him shaken, and to say he was emotionally stable was a big fat lie. “Please, sit down, I’ll fetch you something to drink.”
“It was your safe haven when the rest of your life was utter shit.” Ellis came to sit next to him and put an arm around his shoulders. “It reminds you of your brief, blissfully safe breaks between all the work you had to do, but it can’t do that without also bringing back the memories of what you were trying to escape.”
“Oh my God, you are such a gay disaster.” Pansy threw her hands up in desperation and then ushered him to a long, nearby table which functioned as bench for the moment. “You go sit here, I’ll get you something to drink and tell Adonis over there that you fancy the pants off of him.”
That last one took his by surprise when the words came across his lips. He hadn’t known how true that was until he said it. But the longing for that quiet life was soon overtaken by the overwhelming worry that he’d never get to have that. That Draco wouldn’t pull through, wouldn’t wake up, wouldn’t ever be able to look Harry in the eye again, would never again hold him close and sing him to sleep and tell him everything was going to be alright.
Harry let out a small chuckle, and brushed a lock of hair out of Draco’s face. “He always gets like this, you know? Too high and mighty for as much as a handshake during the day, but violently clingy as soon as exhaustion hits.”
“And that’s the end of this update for now, Mr Malfoy.” Scorpius’ Healer concluded. “Do you have any questions?”
His complaints were muffled against the wood, but Harry still heard them for the bullshit they were.
when I’m with people. With you.” Draco stopped hugging his knees for a moment and massaged his toes, never once meeting Neville’s eye. “It’s easier, coming to you. You’re so… Warm. I can’t… I can’t fall apart like that around you. You’d… I don’t know.”
, that was her name. The only business person who had supported his bill to raise the minimum wage. There had been no need for her to put up that fight - all her employees already had a high salary, and it got her some powerful enemies. Rubbing it in the faces of her rivals that her business was turning a profit without going over the backs of those who worked for her had been reward enough for her though.
He hoped Draco would get a good night of sleep, surrounded by people who loved him. Because they did, mental breakdowns and depressions included. No matter how long the road to recovery was.
“I love you too, you sap,” Draco replied as James happily continued making retching noises in the background. “Now get going you, otherwise this proud nation will never have a quidditch little league.”
“A disaster father and a big teddy bear.” Draco shook his head and leaned his back against the couch. “I’m sorry. My emotions are still a bit all over the place from yesterday. You know how I am after a panic attack.”
“It feels so silly.” Draco sniffed, his voice just a fraction of what it usually was. “Asking for a Healer when you broke that leg yourself.”
spoil him?” Draco huffed. “Harry is the one who spoils people. I swear to Merlin, if those kids didn’t have Ginny or Andy, they would never eat fruit again.”
“Hey, it’s okay, it’s okay.” Harry was rubbing gentle circles on his back, which he did with a care that did not at all help Draco’s attempts to stop crying. He hated crying in front of other people, especially Harry. “Do you want me to hold you through it? Or do you want to go upstairs so I can join you later with breakfast?”
I am so sorry for not posting for so long, real life was doing things and I just completely forgot about the existence of this fic. But I promise I'll finish!
Draco wished Harry had been angry. At least then he could wallow in self pity instead of guilt for making Harry wait for him. He wouldn’t even begin to
mean my child is spoilt.” Draco was doing all of his calming exercises at the same time in the hope of stopping himself from decking Percy right in his outraged face. It was so bloody tempting, with those stupid glasses almost
After that, the subject was dropped with the aid of a glare from Hermione. She wouldn’t let him ruin their dinner together with talk about Malfoy. Harry didn’t agree with her that talking about Malfoy would ruin their dinner, but he’d given up on that one the last time he obsessed–, nay,
cling to, could claw at, could use to lift himself up. And lift himself up he did, at least until the Spark died out again.
Draco silently followed him inside, tightening his hold on Harry’s hand when the man made a move to stay behind in the hallway. As if he was capable of doing this on his own.
“I ripped them, it happens.” Malfoy snapped, the tentative friendly ambiance gone within a second. Malfoy himself looked like he wanted to follow the ambiance right out the door with matching speed, grabbing his coat and the notebook he fell asleep on. “We didn’t all graduate with a million opportunities presenting itself to live our best life,
Draco nodded, feeling warmth spread through his chest because his view on consent was rubbing off on Harry. “Just don’t fidget. I’m not good with light touches when I’m anxious.”
I do not think the people I fought with back at Hogwarts would forgive me, they definitely do not have any obligation to, but I always found that it helps to think that if you hurt people in the past, that does not mean you cannot help others now. And not being able to earn the forgiveness of those people you hurt, is no reason to not try and better yourself. If we are supposed to act like the worst people we have once been, then this world would be a horrible place to live. People can really surprise you when you allow them to change.
“And you’re the best son in the world, Scorp.” Draco put his arms around his kid and held him close. He could get used to waking up like this, with a fresh fry up and the best tiny human ever climbing into his bed. Scorpius, never one for being held for long, pressed a kiss to his cheek and climbed off him again, sitting up on the bed.
“I was, but I can’t let my customers walk out looking dead on their feet. It would be bad for business.”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut. He was screwed either way. Which meant that he might as well get a hug out of it.
“Scorpius.” Scorpius flinched at the harsh tone in Draco’s voice, so Draco cursed himself and tried again. The harshness hadn’t been aimed at his son at all, which meant he should keep it well away from him. “Scorpius, can you look at me?”
“Yes, sweetheart.” Pansy chuckled before sipping at her own beer. “You can thank me at your wedding. His name is Harry, by the way. Best remember that before you go down on one knee for him. Or, you know, when you go down on both.”
Did you appreciate the rubber duck? I imagine not if it confused you. While I was at Hogwarts, I would usually talk to my friends or occasionally Professor Lupin (in third year). Talking to my owl usually happened at home during the holidays. Being locked in my bedroom (I graduated to a bedroom after my first year - my family were afraid I’d use magic against them) meant I only had my owl for company. She was locked in her cage too, so we had that in common at least. I miss her a lot, but I don’t think I’m ready to get a new owl yet.
“Of course.” Draco settled properly on Harry’s lap and put his head on his shoulder. He was scared and tired, but somehow he also had too much energy and he felt both stretched thin and too intensely emotional at the same time. Basically, he felt like a mess. He just hoped Harry’s firm back rubs and the passing of time would ease that as he waited for his son to come out of theatre.
Harry knew he was rambling but he couldn’t get himself to stop. Draco wasn’t much impressed and didn’t show any signs of waking. Harry tried shaking him a bit with no effect. so he conjured a glass of water and flicked some of it in Draco’s face. It seemed to at least change the nightmare, even if Draco didn’t wake up, though he might…
Draco pulled his head back a bit, tilting Harry's head up slightly with his hand so they could lock gazes.
“We consider ourselves dry, surrounded by air, but the minute a drop of water hits us, we consider ourselves wet.”
Harry nodded, slowly unclenching his trembling hand and turning it upwards. Malfoy’s fingers entwined with his, squeezing his hand softly, reassuringly, and Harry’s heart hammered inside his chest - though not for the reasons it had seconds prior.
‘’Ah, well that makes sense,” and Harry frowned at him. Malfoy quickly continued, ‘’I mean, you don’t look like you would voluntarily make the decision to step onto the ferris wheel, seeing as -,” and Malfoy vaguely gestured in Harry’s direction, ”so, like, it makes sense that you got dared to,” Malfoy said, grimacing at himself.
“I mean, we breathe oxygen,” Right now, Harry wishes he didn’t, “because we are surrounded by air. But, by that logic, would fish breathe water, since they are completely surrounded by water?”
Harry let his gaze roam along the - fitted - navy blue dress robes Malfoy was wearing, a simple white button up underneath it. As he trailed his eyes back up to look at Malfoy's face, his eyes locked with grey ones and Harry's breath hitched. They stared blankly at each other for a few moments, before Malfoy broke eye contact to look at the person he was talking to and Harry exhaled, his eyes closing briefly.
Harry hesitatingly reached out to brush his hand against Draco’s again, this time linking his index finger with Draco’s pinkie.
, yes, what else did you expect me to say? Of course, I will marry you, Harry,’’ Draco whispered into Harry’s ear, leaning back to lock their lips together.
, Harry was so done. He loved Draco, but he was so done, utterly done. He didn’t need to know about fish, didn’t want to know about fish. All he needed and wanted, was for Draco to
Once more, he glanced to the ground below and saw that they were almost at the top of the ferris wheel and he sighed with a slight quiver.
Pale hands came up to swiftly unbutton his jeans, pulling them down along with his pants and Harry hissed as his cock sprung up, the cold air hitting his skin.
‘’Hi,’’ Harry greeted, stepping closer to Draco to link their hands together. Draco leaned up to place a small kiss onto Harry’s lips, ‘’Hi,’’ he whispered back.
“So, do fish actually breathe air, or do they breathe water?” Draco’s voice filled the room, breaking Harry’s thoughts and Harry sighed, his fingers tightening around his pillow - which was back underneath his head, instead of on his face.
,'' Malfoy spat, before he turned and stalked off, leaving Harry standing at the bar, his heart shattering to pieces - all over again.
Malfoy took a step back, putting distance between them, and Harry had to keep himself from stepping forward to follow him. Harry wanted to reach out, speak out, stop Malfoy from running - once more. His heart had been broken by Malfoy, but he had put that aside him, he had healed from that fight. They had both healed from everything, hadn't they? They had grown, matured, settled, so
Harvey hummed, ''Why are you reading about him?'' and Harry sighed. Ever since Harvey came to know about his past with Malfoy - which he certainly was not content about, even though Harry assured him it was in the past - he had been acting overly possessive and protective, whenever Harry would come into contact with anything that was or might have been Malfoy-related. And, to be quite honest, Harry was getting a bit sick of it.
The sound of someone clearing his throat next to him, set off another stream of thoughts in his mind.
Shaking his head to clear his mind from the sweet memory, Draco folded the paper and continued his walk into the kitchen. Another piece of glowing paper was waiting for him on the counter, and Draco immediately reached for it.
Draco nodded, humming affirmatively, ''Harry also has that messy, just-out-of-bed look going on with his hair,'' Draco said with a vague wave of his hand, and Harry snorted a bit, turning them around the corner into the alley - which was indeed empty and abandoned, ''It's quite a hot look,'' Draco continued to say and Harry froze.
‘’Yeah,’’ Malfoy said, his head cocking to the side, ‘’why is that so surprising?’’ he added belatedly.
At once, relief flooded Harry’s veins and he made quick work to hastily shove not only himself, but also Draco, out of the cart.
Harry had tried turning his back to Draco, had tried putting a Silencing Charm on Draco (only for Draco to slap him on the arm repeatedly, until Harry conceded and took it off), had even tried to slap his hand over Draco’s mouth (only for Draco to lick his palm, and Harry to pull it away with a frown). Lastly, he had tried to put a pillow over his head - Muggle style, briefly thinking that it might even take mercy on him and suffocate him. But, alas, nothing had happened, nor had anything helped.
‘’I’m sorry I didn’t wish you before, I was scared I would blow my cover,’’ Harry apologised. Draco looked at Harry, his arms looping around Harry’s neck. He tilted his head with a mischievous smile, and Harry raised an eyebrow.
Malfoy’s expression turned sheepish at Harry’s confused look, and answered with a small shrug, ‘’I have kind of been looking for a way to talk to you, so when I saw you get on the ferris wheel, you know, I decided that this was my chance,’’ pale cheeks flushing at the admission.
And Harry loves it - loves that Draco is so comfortable with him to let the actual, real him out in front of Harry, loves that he lets his walls down,
He threw Malfoy off with the words - and, to be quite honest, himself as well - only for one second, though, before Malfoy spoke again, slowly stalking towards Harry until he stopped right in front of Harry’s face.
Harry nodded tersely, but also slightly pleased in the back of his mind that his crush knew his name, and Malfoy smiled, nodding back, ‘’Draco Malfoy.’’
Harry moaned, bucking his own hips, and brought his arms up to encircle them around Malfoy’s neck to pull him closer.
Finally he bucked up once more, “I’m gonna -” he said, pressing Malfoy’s head down on his cock as he finished inside Malfoy’s mouth with a loud moan, shuddering as he went.
‘’Well, this is fun,’’ Malfoy commented sarcastically, and Harry only hummed nervously in affirmation.
Silence overtook them once more, and Harry was considering to make a flimsy excuse to dodge the awkwardness - and the racing heart he had been experiencing since Malfoy came to stand with him, which was really just nervousness and awkwardness, right? - when Malfoy started talking again, stepping closer and putting a warm hand on his arm.
“So, if we consider ourselves dry, do fish consider themselves dry surrounded by water? And if they do, do they think of themselves as wet when they come in touch with air? Or, do you think they - “
Harry looked to his right from the corner of his eyes, not daring to move his head or body in fear of shaking the cart even more than it already was. Malfoy’s face was pulled into an expression of genuine - or maybe what seemed like genuine, Harry couldn’t quite say as he wasn’t fully facing the guy - concern.
''Isn't that Draco?'' Harvey asked, his tone disapproving. Harry glanced back at the magazine and nodded affirmatively, ''Yeah,'' he mumbled.
The rattling of the cart they were sitting in, pulled Harry from his thoughts about the guy sitting next to him, and instead sent him into another frenzy of panic as he tightly gripped the side of the cart with one hand while the other curled into a fist next to him.
The tip of Malfoy’s tongue traced his lip and Harry opened his mouth willingly, moaning as Malfoy’s tongue slipped inside, exploring his mouth.
Harry jogged to catch up slightly with Draco, stopping right in front of him as nerves filled his body.
. He really does. I could never tell him how I feel, though, I still can't tell him how I feel - I can't tell him that I love him,'' Draco murmured.
The right side - the main article - showed a head title in black letters (''Draco Malfoy: The biggest, contemporary Healer'') and Harry skimmed through the first few sentences of the articles, where Malfoy's past as a Death Eater has been highlighted severely, before Skeeter moves on to Malfoy's current career as a Healer - displaying him as one of the best, and Harry can't help but feel a rush of pride swell inside of him at the words.
Harry slid off Draco, panting, and gathered Draco in his arms. He felt Draco lean his head against his chest and he rested his head atop Draco’s, eyes closing contentedly and tiredly.
Draco sighed as he sat down on the bed, looking at Harry, ''I never really hated him, you know, I always quite liked him actually. He doesn't think he deserves much, you know, but he
It was way past 2 A.M., all Harry wanted to do was sleep, but Draco seemed to be full of energy - breaking the silence they were in with a new question every so often.
In a moment, they were standing in Draco's living room, Harry manoeuvring them up the stairs until they were in Draco's bedroom.
Still muttering to himself, Draco turned to hang his keys on the hook next to the door. He froze as his gaze fell onto a fluttering, glowing piece of paper, taped to the back of the door. Draco frowned, his right hand resting on his wand in his back pocket as his left hand reached out to peel the paper from the door.
‘’I was wondering if you would like to go on a date with me,’’ Malfoy rushed out, Harry straining to pick the words apart.
“Shutting you up, apparently,” Harry said, before he dropped his head, mouth enclosing around a pink nub, Draco whining softly and Harry felt as the hand in his hair pushed his head closer to Draco’s chest.
Harry heard Harvey sigh and watched as Harvey stood up, gathering his stuff quietly, before he walked towards the hallway that lead to the door. Harvey paused, his back facing Harry.
, Harry thought as the cart began to move. Harry chanced a quick glance at the ground, and immediately regretted it as a soft whimper escaped his lips and his chest tightened. They weren’t even that high off the ground yet, and Harry felt a wave of nausea go through his body as he watched the cart getting lifted higher and higher from the ground.
He refrained himself from commenting any of those two answers out loud, and instead chose to whisper out, ‘’Dare.’’
Harry bit on the man's nipple, hearing him squeal, and stroked his hands down the lithe body beneath him. He leaned up, straddling agile hips, discarding his own shirt, before moving his hands down to work the man's jeans open. Harry leaned up to pull the jeans and underpants off the man's legs before quickly pulling his pants off. He leaned on his knees, sliding his hands up along hairy legs, pulling them up and apart slightly to settle himself in between them and bringing his head down.
''I love you,'' Harry whispered into the silence, bending down to place a kiss on top of Draco's head, before he walked back downstairs, Apparating himself to his home with a smile on his face.
His eyes finally fell on top of a hunched figure sitting on a bench to the left, long and blond hair falling down the back. Harry walked over, sitting himself down next to Draco - softly, as not to startle him.
"I thought you’d never ask,’’ Draco answered simply, smiling widely, pulling a stumbling and giggling Harry along with him.
An arm around his waist pulled his gaze away from the picture and the article, and Harry looked up to see Harvey looking at him, blue eyes flicking to the pages Harry had laying open on his lap. The arm around his waist tightened, and Harry briefly closed his eyes - praying that this isn't going to go where he highly suspects where it is going.
Just as they were about to close the cart he was sitting in, and Harry was about to faint from the panic welling inside of him, a voice called out, ‘’Wait! Can I get on there as well?’’
The cart shuddered, beginning its descend, and Harry squealed, his hands tightening on the rails along the cart once more. A touch against his hand, the one clenched next to him, made him jump and the cart wiggled again, making Harry inhale sharply before he drew his gaze to where pale, long fingers hesitatingly hovered above his hand.
They looked at each other, gazes locked, before Harry let his eyes drop slightly down toward pale lips - that looked oh-so inviting, just as they had looked all those years back, when they had been fooling around, except then they had been red, slick and swollen from all the kissing and biting - a squeeze on his arm broke his train of thoughts and he let his eyes drift back up to icy eyes. The hand on his arm dropped back down, coming to rest next to Malfoy's body, and a wave of disappointment ran through Harry.
He watched as Malfoy shook his head, ''We can't,'' Harry heard Malfoy say, ''it was over years ago, we both know that.''
Harry flicked the pages, snorting occasionally, before he stopped on a page with an article about Malfoy. A picture of Malfoy in a dark blue, muggle suit adorned the whole of the left page. Malfoy was holding the jacket, slung over his shoulder, while looking into the camera with a smouldering look. Malfoy's name was written in fancy letters underneath the picture.
The fluttering of the paper against his skin, snapped him from his thoughts. Draco traced his finger across the letters once more, before carefully folding the paper back into its original form. He turned and walked into the living room, eyes searching for Harry, but instead falling on another glowing piece of paper; this one taped to the couch.
''I can't be with somebody who is still in love with someone else, Harry, I'm sorry,'' Harvey said, and Harry's heart clenched slightly. Harvey stood still for a few moments, before he turned slightly, ''If - at some point - you feel like you can move on, you know where to find me,'' Harvey finished softly, before he turned and walked away.
Harry moved his hips erratically, images of Draco flashing in front of his eyes. He felt the man tighten around him, the man's cock twitching and voice keening as he finished and Harry growled, hips speeding up, before he - as well - finishes with a low sigh of
Draco folded the paper and cleared his throat against the rush of emotions that flooded through him, walking out of the kitchen to make his way into the bedroom - still in search of Harry. On the bed, another piece of paper was waiting for him, and Draco picked it up.
They were cuddled on the couch, Harvey was reading a book while Harry was reading through the Daily Prophet - which had become a hilarious obsession of him while he had been dating Malfoy.
As he let his eyes trace the letters once more with a small smile on his face, the memory fading to the edges of his mind, his eye fell on a small arrow in the bottom corner of the parchment and Draco raised his eyebrow, before turning the paper around.
Harry walked through some corridors, before he finally reached the bathroom and he slipped inside, standing in front of the mirror while he rested his hands on the sink. Harry breathed in - deeply - before he slowly breathed out again, repeating the process a few times, before he felt his heart rate go back to normal and he opened his eyes, looking up. His gaze caught Malfoy's, who had - apparently - come in as well and was staring at him through the mirror.
‘Draco?!’ he sputtered, almost spraying the table with chewed up sausage. His face went red as he gaped at his girlfriend for the unwarranted (and polite) use of Draco’s given name.
He just had no idea where to start. He hesitated for a moment, trying to sort out the best way to do this, to explain to her how the rivalry between them, all that hate and pain, had turned into something completely different. He didn’t want to give her all the details, didn’t want to spend all day (and probably night) tucked away in the back corner of the library disclosing all his secrets and the truths he’d buried for so long, but he wanted to give her something. He wanted to give her pieces that would help her understand that this thing with Draco was a long time coming and that it was something they’d been building toward – not a facet of his saviour complex.
With a soft chuckle, Harry traced kisses across one side of Draco’s face, tracing the arch of one defined cheekbone before he switched to tracing across the other one. ‘Better?’ he murmured.
Something to think about then. Something else to ask her about when he finally presented her with his finished proposal for the new wizarding primary school.
Harry looked up at that and frowned. Draco too looked at her, realising she had a point. As it stood, the houses didn’t have the room to house the retuning eighth years, how would they make room for hundreds more students?
Draco hummed noncommittally. ‘I don’t know. I don’t know of anyone else who might know enough about the way the Mark functions to use it this way. Voldemort wouldn’t have wanted anyone else to have that sort of power over his followers.’
Draco smiled gleefully at him, not even pretending to be abashed by the number of presents Harry had already gifted him. He eagerly unwrapped the gift and promptly blinked in surprise when the wrapping paper revealed a small ring box. Heart hammering, thoughts racing back to the sleepy conversation they’d been having the night before, he lifted the lid on the box and found himself looking at a matching set of rings. The gold bands were simple but beautiful, both engraved with intricate runic designs in an old form that he thought was familiar but took him a while to identify.
She did understand that it was likely Harry’s desire to save people. That finding him in the Ministry had likely sparked something in a Harry who was lost after the war with no Voldemort left to fight and he’d latched onto Malfoy as someone who needed saving.
Harry’s sobs rivalled Myrtle’s as he screamed for help. His voice rough and throat raw as he shouted and screamed and desperately tried to save the man he loved.
Harry rolled his eyes, but again, couldn’t help agreeing. He crawled back onto the bed, hovering over Draco so he could place soft teasing kisses across his chest, up the smooth pale column of his throat and along the rough side of his jaw before capturing his lips.
Not that Hermione or Astoria needed to know any of that. It was bad enough he’d told Harry some of the stories, bad enough that Harry had witnessed some of them through his connection with Voldemort. Bad enough Draco had to remember some of those moments and couldn’t just have a Ministry Obliviator erase them.
This time Draco’s laugh was amused, because three days later he was starting to see that it was a little bit funny. ‘I haven’t spoken – obviously – to Hermione but if I had to guess I’d say she feels guilty about talking to Weasley. Guilty about
He looked to Harry, helpless to explain anything to her when all he could speak was hisses of Parseltongue and stilted hand motions of WSL (which Hermione “hadn’t the time to learn”).
Sick with the threat of memories, Hermione turned her back on Malfoy and her friend and strode toward the train, not even noticing Hannah Abbot calling out to her in greeting. She just needed to find Ron. She needed to see him and hold him and try to gain back the feeling of peace she’d had looking around the platform before her gaze had landed on a war criminal stood beside someone she considered a friend.
Draco blinked at him for a moment in incomprehension, simply staring at him and trying to make sense of what the man with the dragonhide protective clothing was trying to tell him. Fleur was dressed for work too, although she looked as though she’d slipped her heavily warded work jacket on over a set of boring cotton pyjamas.
Which Harry knew was as good as admitting to all those years he’d filled his wank bank with images of Harry and so Harry fell asleep with a sweet smile on his lips and no more worries about Hermione and her strange avoidance because there wasn’t much he could do but wait her out and, in the end, it was just the next day when Hermione, as Draco predicted, did come to Harry.
Harry did. ‘Right. She doesn’t know because if she did, she’d have marched on the Ministry and camped
The shake and lurch of the cabinet in the corner drew them away from their thoughts and for a long moment they both stood before the cabinet watching it quiver and not really knowing what to do. Draco hadn’t faced a boggart since sixth year when he’d come across one in the Room of Hidden Things. That one had turned into a series of corpses until he’d been forced to watch all of his loved ones die. He didn’t know what it would be now, not since he’d faced most of his fears head on.
‘Hermione,’ Harry said again, giving Draco a bit of a nudge, and not feeling at all bad for distracting him with this. ‘She’s been acting a bit funny for a few days now.’
Longbottom shook his head, the surprise finally leaving his face. For a moment he looked thoughtful and then he smiled akwardly. ‘How long?’
They’d all read the letter Charlie had sent Ginny, the one that suggested Ron could do with a long cooling off period and some time to sort himself out. They’d all read what Charlie wanted them to know about Ron’s visits to a mind healer and how he was taking the time to talk with Charlie about his homophobic comments – how Charlie could acknowledge that Ron didn’t seem to believe the vitriol he’d spewed at Harry but once he’d started, he hadn’t known how to stop, wanting them to hurt as he hurt. They’d all guessed that, but it didn’t make it better.
Harry sniffled a bit, looking at Draco, who had a shocked expression of his face and Harry let out a humorless chuckle, before he turned and started walking towards the door.
A hand on his wrist stopped him and Harry's eyes dropped down, seeing pale fingers enclosing his wrist. He followed the arm up, his eyes locking on grey ones, before he twisted his arm slightly and Malfoy's hand dropped from his wrist. Harry moved to turn again, but Malfoy's voice stopped him.
To the outside world, Draco is Draco Malfoy - heir of the Malfoys. He is elegant, articulate, sassy and witty. The epitome of a Slytherin.
The cart was still making its way down, moving along with the soft breeze of the wind and Harry took a deep breath, his fingers tightening ever so slightly both around Malfoy’s hand and the side of the cart.
Harry groaned internally. It would be so effective, just pulling the pillow from under his head to smack it right in the middle of Draco’s face.  Though, Harry highly doubted it would shut Draco up. He’d probably just be astonished, stunned, but continue his rant a few minutes later about…
Harry sat in his living room, a book opened on his lap, but not quite reading. His mind was still stuck on Malfoy - even though weeks had passed since their run-in at the Ministry function, after which they hadn't seen each other again.
''I'm sorry about that,'' Malfoy said, and Harry shrugged before answering, ''I like teaching, working with the kids.''
‘’What about dinner?’’ Harry whispered, hot breath ghosting across Draco’s skin, and Draco whined softly.
''I promise you, he feels the same way about you. Just tell him,'' Harry said softly, a smile gracing his lips.
Harry pulled away from Draco’s lips, placing feather light kisses down Draco’s neck, pausing to suck a mark on Draco’s pulse point and the hand in his hair tightened, making Harry groan.
One of Harry’s hands came up to rest against the side of Draco’s face and Draco leaned into the touch.
Harry lifted his hand to grab onto Draco's hand, that had been resting underneath Harry's chin, and he laced their fingers together. He squeezed the hand, looking up at Draco again, before he nodded slightly.
‘’Draco, the past five years we have been together, have quite possibly been the five best ones in my life,’’ Harry began, voice trembling with nerves, ‘’and although we have had our past and have never quite seen eye to eye, I was never really surprised at the realization that it was you for me; that it had always been you for me, from Hogwarts to now. Because you are, and always have been, my light in a life full of darkness. Because my eyes always look for you, even when you are not around me. Because my mind is always stuck on thoughts of you. But, most importantly, because I am, always have been, and always will be irrevocably in love with you. Draco Lucius Malfoy, will you do me the honor and absolute joy of becoming your husband?’’
Harry watched with hooded eyes as Malfoy leaned in, blowing softly across the tip and Harry moaned, bucking his hips. Malfoy licked a stripe from the bottom up, lips sliding across the head momentarily, before pulling back again to lick the slit teasingly and Harry groaned, his hands sliding into Malfoy’s hair with a tight grip.
That's how Harry found himself, months later, on the same couch in his living room with his new boyfriend, Harvey. Harvey was a wizard - a halfblood -, slightly taller than him, slightly tanned with blond-brown hair and blue eyes.
To and for Harry, within their home, Draco is different. It isn’t that Draco isn’t elegant or witty and everything else he is outside of their home, because he definitely is. It’s that he’s so much more
Harry had come to discover several things about Draco in the time that they had been dating - he knows Draco like no one else does.
His hands were cramping up from all the clenching, but Harry didn’t dare unclench his fingers either.
Draco shook his head and Harry smiled, standing up and holding his hand out for Draco. Draco stood, swaying slightly, but Harry steadied him with hands on Draco's waist and he turned them, one arm still around Draco as he walked them to a point, where they could safely Apparate.
‘’Well, I actually saw you get onto the ride on your own and took a chance,’’ Malfoy answered slowly, and Harry glanced at him with a raised eyebrow,
Harry looked up at Malfoy, ''I left the Aurors,'' he said, ''too much duelling and chasing, I have had enough of that. I joined the Professors at Hogwarts, DADA Professor,'' Harry continued softly.
- aspiring to be a Healer and Harry readying himself for an Auror career. Harry shook his head, this was not the place nor time to think about that.
Harry walked outside, the wind hitting his face as his eyes searched in the dark for Draco. Pansy had come up to him and the others to tell them that Draco had been drunk of his face and was whining and muttering outside.
Draco Malfoy, as you might want to know, was the hottest (albeit, most arrogant) guy at school, and Harry had been hopelessly crushing on the guy for months (okay, years, sue him).
He watched as Draco nodded, his eyes starting to droop as sleep took over him. In seconds, soft and even breaths left the thin lips as Draco drifted off into a deep sleep. Harry waited a few moments to make sure Draco was indeed sleeping, before he stood quietly. Harry conjured a glass and some painkillers, putting them on top of Draco's nightstand next to the bed.
For seconds, they both sat staring, stupidly smiling at each other, before they got - literally - jolted from their daydream by the cart stopping at the entrance/exit of the ride.
Harry hadn’t even noticed that his breathing had been coming out in short pants, his chest constricting and his body shaking, until Draco Malfoy’s voice cut through his panic-stricken trance.
“So, if all animals could talk and we could hear all of them, which do you think would be the rudest?” Draco whispered softly, tiredly against Harry’s neck, where he’d burrowed his face.
‘’Your name?’’ Malfoy asked uncertainly, seemingly doubting himself, when Harry didn’t answer the question.
Harry rubbed a hand down his face. Maybe it was time to move on, let go - replaying what had happened in the past would do nothing for him. As Dumbledore had told him,
Harry cut Draco off by straddling Draco’s waist, lips colliding with Draco’s - whose mouth was still open underneath his, giving him easy access to deepen the kiss, making Draco moan and unfreeze underneath him, thin hips arching up. One hand came to rest on Harry’s arm, the other sliding into Harry’s hair, pulling and Harry sighed into Draco’s mouth.
Harry sighed, guiding Draco to lay down on the bed, pulling the cover across his body, before kneeling down and looking into Draco's eyes, one hand stroking across the soft hair.
‘’Happy birthday, love,’’ Harry whispered, eyes twinkling, before once more smiling nervously at him. Draco frowned in question, but Harry only stepped back. He dropped the hand from Draco’s face, but kept his left hand linked with Draco’s right.
Draco's stare grew morose, head shaking from side to side, ''But, what if he doesn't feel the same about me? He can't feel the same about me, he must still hate, or at least dislike me,'' Draco said, and Harry felt his heart break. Had he really let Draco feel as if he still didn't like him?
Harry looked back the club for a moment, before answering. ''I told her to stay, that I would take you back home.'' Harry stayed quiet, before reluctantly adding as an afterthought, ''unless you want Pansy to bring you.''
Harry closed the magazine, tossing it aside on the couch, before he turned his body slightly to face Harvey. ''I wasn't,'' - okay, a lie, but it wasn't like he was actually interested in Malfoy's life, he just happened to come across it while flicking through the pages and told Harvey so, ''I was just looking through the magazine and it happened to feature an article on Draco,'' Harry finished with a small shrug.
The first thought that flashed through his mind as Harry settled himself nervously into the seat of the ferris wheel, was that
When he opened them again, he saw Malfoy walking over to him and Harry's heart went in overdrive, hands getting clammy and mouth dry.
''How's the Healer career treating you?'' Harry asked, as he kept his eyes firmly on the glass in his hand.
‘’I do know some ways in which you can make it up to me,’’ Draco whispered, and Harry’s eyes darkened at the words. The arms around Draco’s pulled him closer, and Harry nuzzled into Draco’s neck, lips brushing against the junction between his collarbone and neck.
Harry surveyed the scene they found themselves in, the situation from Sixth Year flashing through his mind, when he had found Malfoy crying in the bathroom and it had escalated badly between the two of them. He removed his hands from the sink, running one through his hair, before he turned slowly. He looked at Malfoy, before he sighed and made move to walk past Malfoy and through the door to go home.
Harry pulled his head away from where it was rested in the crook of Draco’s neck to look at Draco, green eyes glowing.
Harry nodded, and Draco smiled, his hand brushing past Harry’s as he made move to walk away. Harry turned as well, his gaze falling upon his friends who were calmly and casually sitting around a bench and eating candy cotton. He bit his lip, contemplating for just a second, before he turned back around.
am sorry, Draco. I am sorry that we didn't work out before, that you didn't want to fight for what we had, that you just up and left and discarded me to the side like I was just - some toy for you. Like I meant
A muffled groan made him look back up at Malfoy, and his cock twitched slightly at the sight before him.
than he is Malfoy, within their home.Draco is messy - granted, not as much as Harry - he is clumsy, and he talks
His point was, Malfoy just settled into the seat next to him. On the ferris wheel. Where Harry was currently, quite obviously if his shaking limbs are anything to go by, about to pass out due to a case of extreme fear of heights. If he had any chance to get with Malfoy before this (which he probably hadn’t, but that also isn’t the point), he surely didn’t have one after this ride was over.
Malfoy laughed coldly, “Thought so, Potter. Why don’t you go back to your little friends, yeah? Those Gryffindors, go kiss their asses, Golden Boy.”
Harry pressed a small kiss on top of Malfoy’s head and circled his arms around the lithe body to pull the boy closer to his own body, holding him tightly, as Malfoy nuzzled his head into his chest.
''You know,'' Draco spoke, and Harry hummed inquisitively, ''you look very much like - like Potter, like Harry.'' Draco giggled and Harry smiled, heart skipping at the mention of his first name. Even as they had been paired at the Aurors, Draco had not lost the habit of calling Harry by his last name. Draco had only ever called him Potter, with just two exceptions (on Harry's birthday and when Harry had been hit by a curse during a chase).
Malfoy moaned loudly around Harry’s cock and Harry’s hips stuttered at the vibration. He thrust his hips deeply, a mantra of “fuck, fuck, fuck,” leaving his mouth as heat coiled in his stomach.
Malfoy had his hand down his pants and was bucking wildly up into his hand, the other hand muffling the sounds coming from his mouth. After a few thrusts, Harry leaned forward and sucked on the exposed skin of Malfoy’s throat - which had looked too enticing to pass up - and Malfoy’s hips stuttered, his body shuddering with a muffled shout as he climaxed.
“Look at you, taking me so well, Malfoy. You like it, don’t you?” Malfoy inhaled sharply through his nose, eyes closing and opening again, darkening as he nodded slightly, carefully around Harry’s cock, and Harry groaned softly. “Such a cock slut, aren’t you? If I had known this would be the way to shut you up, I’d have done this much sooner.”
They still needed to work out a lot of things together, needed to build up their trust again, all amongst other things - so, they might not be completely okay yet, but at least it was a start. A good start, Harry thought.
Draco’s eyes lit up, before letting his gaze flit down to their hands as he interlaced their fingers fully.
''Talk?'' Harry began with a raised eyebrow, voice low, ''Don't you think we have done enough talking in the past? Or, at least, you?'' Harry said. ''When I wanted to talk, fix things, all you had to say for yourself was that it wasn't something that could be fixed, that it was something that just -
Harry pulled out a dark green, velvet box from behind him and opened it. A simple, silver band was nestled inside. Draco’s eyes blurred with tears, and he blinked, sniffing. Harry was looking at him, nervous and waiting, and Draco gasped as he remembered he was supposed to
''Do I?'' Harry asked, struggling a bit to keep a giggling Draco upright. His eye fell on an alley - seemingly empty, perfect place to Apparate, Harry thought - a bit further away and he steered them both into that direction.
''Draco,'’ Harry called softly, and he watched as Draco raised his head to look at him. Harry smiled at Draco, his eyes tracing over Draco's figure. He noticed the slight shivering and he took off his jacket placing it over Draco's shoulders, fingers brushing against cold arms.
He took a breath, ‘’I’m fine, thank you,’’ he squeaked out and well, that sounded very reassuring and also very charming. Harry mentally applauded himself,
