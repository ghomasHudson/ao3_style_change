“If you have no objections, I can hire Lawrence again as a specialist consultant, like we did last time?” he proposes. Lawrence could use the payment, and it would give them an unbiased opinion on the role of the House system. Sure, Lawrence knew of the Houses, but Draco had been careful not to speak too much of Hogwarts to him, feeling a little bad for the young man he liked so much. Hogwarts was such a wondrous, integral part of being a Wizard, he didn’t want to make him jealous. A bit presumptuous, he thought, on reflection, but still.  He’ll text Lawrence later, ask if he can come by for dinner. Get some healthy food in him, too. They finish up their meeting, and he seats himself in his office.
Anyway, I hope you enjoy this one, as it is significantly longer, and a lot happens. It was necessary however, to move the plot forwards.
Harry never had had such a spread, and it felt like an utter luxury. The Auror breakroom never got any other tea than breakfast and earl grey, and biscuits were usually gone by Tuesday. Hannah –Neville’s wife, made biscuits every week, two kinds always; Lavender-vanilla, honey-thyme, gingerbread, all sorts. Sometimes decorated with sugary roses, or other flowers. Yes, Neville’s shop was definitely better than the DMLE. Even if he didn’t know what he was doing. Or what he was going to do to “get back on his feet”.  He had Teddy to take care of, and to be honest, money enough to spend in ten lifetimes. But he needed to feel useful. When Neville had offered that he could mind the shop so Hannah could take it easier, now being seven months pregnant, he had accepted immediately. He tried very hard to ignore the pitying look the two of them had exchanged at his enthusiasm. He was
Hermione smiles knowingly at him. “Nothing with the baby. Aside from Ron putting pillows on everything I dare sit on, and Molly sending over pies every other day, I’d say it’s been wonderfully boring”. Indeed, Draco could see a quilted cushion on her desk chair, in typical Gryffindor colours, including little lions embroidered on the top. He smirks at her. Typical.
. But apparently Edgecombe's pureblood pride extended only so far as his vanity allowed him; had wanted to show himself better than the Savior.
“You seem to think we’re all saints around here, because we were on the winning side. That couldn’t be further from the truth, you know”. Neville raises his eyebrows at him, unsure of where he is going. He knows Harry doesn’t want to talk about all the things he had to do in the war.
But he’d also not forgotten what Malfoy’d said about corruption and backhanded deals in the ministry. Had he really closed his eyes to it? Had Marcus been wrong, in saying the Aurors should remain neutral in political reform? He felt uncomfortable even considering it. With all that had happened with Teddy, he hadn’t thought of Marcus that much, but after Malfoy’d left the first time, he’d started thinking.
Upon receiving his rather uniquely smelling bouquet, Mr. McKinnon had a very different reaction to Edgecombe. He was obviously
He debated not going, but what was he going to do at home all day? Alone? Teddy was going to go to the Weasley’s; he didn’t want Teddy to miss school. He’d just take his wriggling worm-stomach to the shop, then.
In front of which stood an awkward looking Draco Malfoy, grocery bag in hand, frantically muttering to himself.
His eye dropped to the little glass vase on the table, hosting a long-stemmed green stalk topped with an enormous white flowery head. Allium. A sort of onion, really. Common; Neville sold them for only one sickle at his shop. Usually with purple heads, although this white one looked suspiciously similar to the ones his neighbour three doors down had in their front garden. He frowned.
Clearly Belby liked to kiss and tell to his new lover, Edgecombe, about what had displeased him so much about Potter –especially in the bedroom.
person the whole nation had to thank for their safety and welfare. It made him sick. He’d never admit it out loud, but he thanked all the gods above that Potter
article. He had read it in Hermione’s office, while she pursed her lips disapprovingly. He'd felt repulsed by the malintent. He suspects Hermione is the one who gave their staff one of her “I will burn you alive with fire” looks when they had started their Savior gossip today. Which is why no one dared show it overtly, or gossip about it. Thank Salazar, because the article, well, it
“Are you really?” she tutted disapprovingly. “I would think it a prime opportunity to try and find someone who might…. hold your interest better than any of the lovely
“- and so, dear, I think the best option is to make sure you have a proper gentleman take you to the
Marcus is breathing heavily in Malfoys face. “You death-eating scum!” he spits out, and Malfoy flinches as a little spittle lands on him.
Yes, his mother was definitely planning something. He would figure it out, and soon. He didn’t truly believe her when she had promised him not to set him up anymore. Perhaps he ought to watch the guest list of the function, keep an eye out for any pureblood girls in attendance. And avoid them like the plague.
“I’ll be fine, Harry. And I’ll send a Patronus if needed, not use that weird little device you got me.”
Harry looked over the latest order. Luscious red rhododendrons, branches of vermilion snapdragons, and, oddly enough, some detoxified Nightshade*. Neville allowed them in bouquets after hitting them with an advance depoisoning charm –one of his own inventions. Neville was currently working on their string-of-pearl plants in the back, which instead of
Draco blinks at it as it blows up and vanishes. The Mailwizard looks positively delighted at the little display. Draco turns a raised eyebrow to him, displaying an unaffected manner.
Ah, Potter will have arrived now then. He resists turning around to see if some of the slime –merlin, green, with mushrooms!?- has remained.
“I am very glad to hear it, of course,” she says, giving him a smile. Then she does something she’s never done, and leans forward to pat his arm, squeezing it. “But that’s not what I asked”. Harry squirms in his chintzy chair. He
son, in Mungo’s. You did!” Teddy had jumped up, looking ready to spit fire, despite that he had been vomiting not an hour earlier.
stupidity”. Harry spluttered, torn between indignation and amusement. He was rather glad she had pulled him off the street for this conversation. Mrs. Picklewilly rummaged a bit in the straw basket next to her armchair, and pulled out the day’s Prophet, spreading it out awkwardly over the plate of biscuits, since there was no room left on the tiny, spindly legged table. “
He had come in the next day to get a brief explanation, get decked out with chocolate pecan turtles made by Hannah, and had simply started tending the shop. Cleaning, watering, reading up on his basic herbology skills. Talking to the babbling begonia's, softly stroking the white velvet lilies. While he wasn’t able to help out much with the medicinal plants or more dangerous one –yet, Neville came in nearly every day just before closing to check up on them. Three days a week Neville assisted professor Sprout at Hogwarts, having accepted an apprenticeship with the goal to take over from her in two years. All in all, he had only had half a week to twiddle his thumbs and ignore letters from Robards. To feel the gaping hole inside him grow larger and larger. Keeping busy helped. If not for the press still harassing him when he stepped out on the street about his and Marcus’ breakup, and the sleepless nights, he could keep up the pretense that he was fine. Especially in the week of Teddy’s birthday. He just simply
“Good morning, Secretary Malfoy” she answered brightly. She was always early, sometimes even earlier than him. He could spot the ink stains on her fingers. Still a quill-user, then -pens had become more
Looking at Hermione’s anguished expression after the meeting, there certainly was a need to give him a call soon. “Why don’t you go home early today, Hermione. I can clean up and close the department for tonight, if you want”. They walk back to her office, the sky on the magical windows already turning dusky and pink. She bit her lip, looking at the stack of reports on her desk.
His keys jangle as he opens the door to the apartment. He pushes away any thougt pertaining to how often he will get to do that again, and steps inside. He wants to sleep for a week, now, but he still needs to get to the office, and he can’t afford to slack
“I am being kept from my work by the an influx of personal mail, it would seem.” He says, trying to be pleasant. More mail was starting to flutter about his face, and he felt it approaching his perfectly coiffed hair. He pushed down the impulse to set it all on fire.
“I’m sure I don’t make that much of a difference, though.” He muttered. Mrs. Picklewilly pursed her lips disapprovingly.
They chatted about Luna’s latest project in the garden, crossbreeding saltwater Plimpies with ordinary strawberries, and Teddy’s progress in school. She was so proud of his reading skills, and held his newest drawing of a red racing car in her lap. Undoubtedly that would be hung up, pride of place in her house, next to all the others.
to be ‘Lord’ Malfoy, for crying out loud. He just wanted to keep his nice apartment, his own salary, his own choices, and
He groaned inwardly. Was this his paranoia speaking again? It really did seem like Malfoy was up to something. But it couldn’t be something nefarious, if Hermione knew of it. And he thought she knew of it. He sighed.
“Ah, Draco. Good to see you” smiled Neville, smearing dirt on his apron and approaching the counter.
“ouch!” he clutches his bitten palm in his other hand, just as the door to the shop opens with a ring of the bell. He curses under his breath, and greets the new customer.
He set his tea down, and tapped a few appointments with his wand, so they’d show up highlighted and on Hermione’s personal planner. He proceeded to send a few memo’s to his undersecretaries, and then got up to visit their research department to check on their progress with regards to 'wizarding citizenship'. It was all part of their new project. Their main researcher was a young, bright Ravenclaw, just graduated from Hogwarts. She came highly recommended, and Draco secretly thought of her as a naïve, young Hermione. Strangely enough, Hermione didn’t like her would-be clone. Draco secretly thought it was because she didn’t like anyone competing with her own bookishness. Although he’d never dare say it out loud; that was what Ron was for, after all.
If you hate the Draco and Hermione friendship or the Draco as godparent idea, this will not be your cup of tea. That's okay. It's in the tags, so don't leave a nasty comment okay? Thank you :)
“But, how would Lucius know to do this?” he asks, incredulous. Lucius had been in Azkaban for years now. He should be half mad, not up to making cunning plans at all.
“Mind your own business, Chester!”. And it pleased Harry immensely to hear an anxious tremor in that plummy voice.
“It’s a working night for me anyway, mother. I need to guide Hermione to the right people. A date is superfluous.” He took a little cucumber sandwich, popping into his mouth. Lovely, that. The manor elves -freed, and rehired, of course, were rather excellent cooks. His mother raised an eyebrow.
, had he been given the chance. But they hadn’t; Sirius had never been free to be what he could’ve been to Harry. But he had left Harry knowing he was loved, and cherished, and worth dying for.
The support group was based in Islington, hosted in a small community center by a witch named Norma Harris. He’d felt comfortably insignificant sitting at the formica tables and drinking machine coffee. He’d been just one of the single parents there, and while some parents had obviously recognized him, the groups confidentiality was warded with a very simple loyalty spell. It was that that had made him stay, actually. That, and Healer Lindsay, or rather, Rowan, who’d smiled had him when he’d spotted Harry. He’d been unintrusive, but obviously comfortable in the group. Harry was surprised by his openness, which was emphasized by his being out of uniform and in soft, casual muggle wear. Harry knew he wouldn’t mind to befriend the man. It was also obvious he was a good father, which made Harry both envious and interested.
“Well, next time I’ll get something more nutritious, then”. He said, before he could stop himself. He found he
“I’m not allowed to tell Molly that these cinnamon rolls are better than hers, you know”. Potter nodded to the bag, which proclaimed “
The floo flared to life, and Ron and Hermione tumbled out onto the carbet in the kitchen. “Hi, Harry, Teddy!” Hermione greeted him, and went to hug Teddy. She looked a bit strained, but very much off-duty in an oversized Cannons jumper –Ron's, obviously, but the orange blissfully faded, and dark jeans. Different from her business attire that was a grown-up version of her studious school-uniform, and more like the post-war Hermione who valued comfort in her private life, the one she built with Ron. Their home reflected this also; their walls might be lined with overstuffed bookshelves –organized by both category and author, indexed with Hermione’s own system, but it was also cosy. Picture frames depicting many Weasley’s and their friends stood in front of the tomes, and oftentimes spare cups of leftover tea could be found scattered about the shelves; where Hermione had left them, looking for a book –and forgotten all about them.
“Well, you can fill out this form here with a formal request. Takes up to two weeks to process, standard procedure.” He was handed a multi-page form, full of tiny writing. He took it reluctantly.
“She was very beautiful, mother” –even if she was lacking some vital parts. And maybe a beard. Damn Potter!
space. And so the ceiling had been painted by hand, painstakingly, to resemble the traditional Black night sky ceilings, and charmed to sparkle at night. The walls he’d wallpapered with forest-printed wallpaper, and he loved how free he felt in his little magical wonderland. While meticulously tidy, it was nothing like the rooms in the manor, whimsical instead of stark, colourful and cosy.
“Now, I wouldn’t normally discuss details with non-family present, but…?” he glanced at Harry, gesturing to Ron and Hermione. He nodded.
And when lunchtime rolls around, he’s doubly glad to see Pansy waiting for him outside of the ministry, looking as clever and sharp as ever, even a little mean. He takes her arm, and they set off to Diagon, to his surprise. They land in front of Mrs. Picklewilly’s shop, and is so incredulous to glimpse his mother’s elegant blonde hair in the back of the shop that he doesn’t even care about all they curious eyes that glimpse his way. Amongst them a pair of bright green ones, framed by round lenses, peering curiously from behind a flowershop window.
“I don’t think that would work, Harry. They've already seen you, now. How about we get some tea first?”.
When Teddy was finally done twirling in his new boots, brushed his teeth and combed his currently unmanageable black hair, Harry floo’d with him to the Burrow. They were greeted by Victoire, blond braids flying around as she stormed towards Teddy to congratulate him and pull him to the kitchen.
“IN HERE!” came back, in Potters voice. Potter came out –dear Merlin, the beard was getting just as wild as his birdsnest of a hairdo. He had dirt above his eyebrow, and he looked a bit sweaty. No dark smudges underneath his eyes though; he looked rather healthy, for a change.
“I know! I just need some flowers, imminently!” He exclaimed again, slightly frantic, looking ready to stop Harry physically from throwing him out. “I was held up at work and I really need to bring flowers to dinner to placate mother so she’s -” he started rambling, before stopping himself abruptly. His blush deepened, and he coughed awkwardly. Harry snorted again.
“I understand, darling. Let us say no more of it, for now”. He slowly blows out his pent up breath, and attacks his quiche with gusto.
‘Dromeda came by Grimmauld with chicken stew that night, and they had a lovely cosy evening. She tucked Teddy in, even if he was ‘too old for it’, and Harry was happy to keep the leftovers. That would mean another hearty dinner tomorrow, no takeout or ready-meals, or the more likely cereal. When Andromeda came downstairs, he had lit the fire and poured some wine.
“It is not my private correspondence.” He responded. He batted away a letter with his hand.As soon as his hand touched the letter, he knew he’d made a grave mistake. It exploded with a few sparks, and aside from spilling a sort of nauseating gas, it started shouting:
“Malfoy!? What are you doing here? Again?”. Harry caught Neville’s eye, who shrugged and quickly disappeared in the back of the shop, murmering about “checking the flaming fungi”. Harry snorted, and turned to really
. He’d have to heal those later. Finally, he’d managed to set up similar wards on his office as to his apartment. Unfortunately, it would keep out interdepartmental mail as well, redirecting it to Madam Beauregard first. He was sure she wouldn’t mind. After all, she was a formidable Witch in her own right, and clearly supported him. She no doubt knew how to deal with petty mail curses, being an attorney.
His mother might not like or personally endorse all of the proposed reforms, but she was decidedly more mild than her husband in her views.
It doesn’t take long for the daily influx of mail starts to arrive. He files away some interdepartmental memo’s, but frowns as the little pile of non-standard sized mail starts to add up. A sense of dread fills him. He had warded his apartment against anonymous mail, including a filter for curses and spells –not a superfluous concern, it had turned out-. While the ministry held off all influx of anything truly dark, it didn’t block malintended letters; after all, complaints were necessary to the proper functioning of many a department. Draco steels himself, and reaches for the first one. He halts when he feels the prickling of magic at his fingertips, and takes out his wand. He settles down to checking each and every one of them.
“But how will concerned citizens contact your department?”  the Mailwizard questions, full of faux concern.
“Will there be a next time, then?” he asked. Did Draco imagine it, or did Potter look rather…curious at the prospect? Draco tapped his fingers on the table lightly.
Harry let her chatter on about florists, and dear old Dick, and tried to collect himself. She didn't seem to mind that he wasn't listening. Had Marcus already forgotten about him? There were still some clothes and toiletries of his in Grimmauld Place. Harry had held on to them, thinking that if he kept them, Marcus might still change his mind. He wouldn’t admit it to anyone, but he had opened Marcus’ hair potion and smelled it surreptiously when he was in the bathroom sometimes. And while he hadn’t heard anything back and all his owls had returned with his letters unopened, he hadn’t thought he could be
They both startle into movement, Malfoy waving him to the door, muttering about making naan. Harry gets up, a little shaken, and walks to the door. He’s not expecting Andromeda for a couple of hours, and she tended to use the floo. Tonight is his first meeting for the single parent support group, and Andromeda was staying over to watch Teddy. He’d even cleaned out a guest bedroom for her, one on the third floor. Not ideal, but it had an ensuite, and the pink patterned wallpaper and frilly curtains were in decent shape, for Grimmauld. He reached the hallway, and quickly waved his wand to check for any traps, or worse, the press. Never could be too careful, these days. When nothing flared, he swung open the door.
Neville sold all sort of beautiful, magical and non-magical flowers, plants, and in the greenhouse in the back, magical herbs for potions and medicine.
“I need to talk to you about Draco”. He said in a low voice. His brown eyes looked angry, his posture screamed ‘hurt’. Oh dear. He dealt enough with Malfoy himself in the shop: he didn’t want some jilted lover (though wasn’t this boy rather young for him?) coming in and harassing Harry about it.
Sanaz gave Harry his creampuff, and he bit in it rather aggressively. Now even Sanaz was laughing at him. He couldn’t catch a break! Of course he knew Hermione worked with Malfoy, had done so for years at this point. And sure, he didn’t believe Malfoy was truly
like this colour on you, Granger. And please stop fussing.” Draco was sitting, long legs crossed in front of him, in
seats of power in the Wizengamot, and he should really start using those. Plus, he was the Savior. He had a responsibility! And if it so happened to align with the plans Draco and Hermione had for reforms, well, all the better, wasn’t it?
“Looking fancy there, Drake”, he whistled, and winked. Draco could feel a twitch in his face at the nickname –he’d tried to get Lawrence to stop calling him that, but the more he did, the less it worked. He raised a single shoulder in nonchalance.
I'd love to hear if you like this perspective. I love Draco as a character, although he's not as snarky inside as he seems on the outside, to me. I also can't wait to see Draco interact with Teddy. I have some scenes planned... if you want them?
“You know me too well, Draco. It’s weird.” He grinned, winked at her. When a comfortable silence fell, he waited a moment, and then delicately breached the subject.
She laughed at him, and he could see behind the fluttering elderly lady she portrayed a clever Witch, not nearly close to retiring in any sense.
be more specific, Lawrence”. A small, horrific smirk was beginning to form on his narrow, tan face. Oh no. That meant Lawrence had scented blood. No use for it now.
head. He half expected a protest from Teddy that he was too old to be babied, or cuddled, or whatever, but it didn’t come.
? I thought you would’ve been married to an approved pureblood wife and have an heir on the way already”. Malfoy looked away, throat bobbing. Was that a blush creeping up Malfoy's neck?
“Molly sent a Patronus, she’s calmed down Victoire and Bill has come to get her home. Ron’s at work, he wanted to come, but you know how it is, and-”
. He grumbled. He really needed to go. He couldn’t show weakness to the haters, couldn’t let the conservative sharks smell his distress.
Harry laughed as the man blustered back, looking supremely aggravated. The next reporter, a young witch with blue braids and revealing violet robes tried, and failed again. Silently shrieking, she fell back on the street, looking outraged. The reporter after that, a thin, pale wizard with floppy blond hair, held his camera in his outstretched hand behind him, and came furthest inside the door, before he too was repelled again outside on the street.
The “Astronomer’s Dream” is a lullaby special to the Black family, and his mother taught him this old, traditional song as a child. It is a winding, repetitive song, about the ever changing and ever moving constellations, and the astronomer who loved them so much he spelled himself into the north star to follow.
wouldn’t allow him to. He would see what bastard had thought to lure Marcus away, and with it, his hopes for a normal family. He took off his disillusion spell, making the little Witch next to him jump and squeak. She hadn’t seen him enter, obviously. She seemed to be one of those who were so shocked by both his fame and his sudden disappearance that she was temporarily struck dumb. That suited him just fine. He briefly regretted his scruffy clothes, complete with some stray twigs, but at least he had on the Spectral Sprout apron, a cloudy grey embroidered with dark blue leaves, hand sown by Hannah, who was surprisingly crafty.
Draco nodded, grateful for the change in subject. “Yes, please”. Potter bend over to rummage around in the drawers of the counter, and got out a small selection of cards. Draco selected one with silver edging, and Potter snorted. Draco shrugged.
“I’m nearly done with that. Just waiting for my idiot partner’s share of the work.” He took another large bite, then continued “It was easy really, I just had to modify some other automated tool I used before, and the prof’s happy enough already”. Having no idea what that all meant –his computer class for the digitally challenged didn’t cover enough, clearly, he started to outline the current situation leading up to both the function and the bill.
“It’s fine, leave it” he grinds out. Malfoy stares at him, face again blank. Harry looks into his eyes, but can’t read what’s swirling in their depths. Somewhere, Harry remembers another fight they had, in a bathroom. He wonders briefly if Malfoy remembers it, too. The blood on the tiles, mixing itself with water like beautiful blooms. The moment stretches, their breathing evening out, their magic turning into something different, now.
“Was she not intelligent enough for you, then?”. Yes, the sense not to wear frilly robes before Easter.
, after all.” He sighs, and swallows another bit of waffle. At least she’ll let him go to work, not that he was looking at all forward to it. But, as he reminded himself, he had grown a spine since the war, and he wasn’t going to let his father ruin it for him again. He glances at the little purple ultrasound picture, already tucked in the corner of the frames of Teddy’s drawings. He can be strong.
, of all people. At this point he was glad Neville and Hannah were preoccupied so he didn’t have them worrying over him, too. Really, it wasn’t like he looked
“I kno-how” Teddy emphasized impatiently. “But he isn’t here. You are. You’re my dad, too”. His little pup looked at him defiantly, a stubborn tilt to his jaw.
Meanwhile, I received so many lovely comments, and they lifted my spirits enormously. I am overflowing with gratitude, and I will get back to every one of you as soon as I can. I prioritized writing a new chapter first, however.
“Eh, yes.” He frowns. “but, how do you know about the drawings?”. Teddy had put them away in his desk, as far as he knew.
“Why don’t we head out for some of that awful carrot cake you keep craving instead of lunch, and see about our plans for the announcement, agreed?”. A tentative smile crept over her face.
Hermione laughs again, wryly. “I’ve gone off it, didn’t you know? It’s pickles with mayonnaise now, I have jars in the icebox over there” she rolls her eyes. Draco pulls a disgusted face.
“And Hermione made someone who hates me come into my house, to report back her” He said, not kindly. Hermione sniffed again. Ron looked like he was trying hard not to laugh. Sanaz raised a dark brow at Hermione. “Really?”
“YOU!” he hears Marcus roar, and Harry forces himself to move. Malfoy might be a bastard, but Marcus is not exactly rational with regards to him, with his prejudice. Even less than he is, really. He doesn’t put it past him to arrest Malfoy. "Shit!" he curses, and arrives at the kitchen to see Malfoy pressed against the sink, both hands up, Dark Mark on unfortunate display. Marcus is close to him, almost nose to nose, wand drawn and pressed against Malfoys long, pale throat. Harry can see his adams apple bobbing as he swallows, but the glint in his eye is defiant.
“Oh, yes, no problem, let me just get…” she ruffled between a giant pile that had to have been stabilized by magic so it wouldn’t tip over, and pulled out a bright orange envelope. “this!” she exclaimed triumphantly. He flicked it open, and nodded approvingly.
The owl was now scratching the glass of the kitchen window. Harry glared at it, then recognized Neville’s small white-faced owl Mildred, and sighed, heading to the window. Teddy quickly took his chance to push away the bowl of oatmeal and grab the toast that was on Harry’s plate. “I WIN!” He yelled triumphantly, spraying crumbs everywhere. Harry grinned at him and let the owl in, untying Neville’s letter and glancing at the Prophet, against his better judgement.
He continued his round, and chatted to Melany Whitehawk, who was in charge of a smaller subdepartment which monitored the establishing “Wizarding Web”. It functioned much like the muggle internet and was their fastest growing sub-department. They were currently discussing cooperation with MACUSA for it. He inquired after her little son, whom Melany and her partner Parvati had recently discovered was a Squib, rattling their little family. He promised to have dinner with them soon, and discuss the benefits of muggle public schools with them. He made a mental note to contact their own educational subdepartment for the latest information on muggle education. And so, his morning went, chatting to his and Hermione’s employees, learning not just the state of their work but also the state of
“Ah, no dear, dear old Dick charmed the tray to balance perfectly. His charms still hold.” She says with a satisfying smile. “Now, eat a sandwich, dear. You look dead on your feet”, she orders him. He obediently picks up a tuna-mayo sandwhich, which has an inordinant amount of pickled onion in it. It is rather nice, actually, and he says so. “Of course it is dear, I made these myself”. She huffs, as if he was accusing her of not making her own pickled goods to sell. She waits until he’s at least halfway through his second sandwich to ask him, “How are you really, then, dearie?”. Her tone is inquiring, but much less sharp.
Malfoy dropped his chopped onions and carrots in a large pot, and a sizzling sound immediately followed.
Harry had a good time at the parent support group. Upon starting work again at Spectral Sprouts, he finds odd rumours are doing the rounds in the street. Luckily, Mrs. Picklewilly is always up for a chat.
But Harry was unable to. Unable to forgive Malfoy for so many things, because when he came home, he had little Teddy, who was crying and had nightmares and hated loud noises for the longest time. Teddy, who was growing up in Grimmauld Place because Death Eaters had killed his parents. Grimmauld Place, which was his because Sirius died at another Death Eater’s hand; Draco’s aunt.
The mood inside was still frantic, although they had obviously managed to hook Teddy up to an IV. Someone was mixing potions in a portable emergency cauldron next to the IV setup, another Healer was standing next to Teddy’s head, hands stretched out over him and mumbling spellwork under his breath. Teddy was still conscious. His anxious eyes were looking at him pleadingly, tears leaking from the corners, and Harry felt like someone had just stabbed him. His magic was still obviously out of control; his skincolour was constantly changing, looking like it was literally crawling over him. Some of the colours and textures weren’t even remotely human-looking. It was a disconcerting sight.
“Come on pup, get your new boots on and we can go to the Burrow”. He gave Teddy a little nudge, and the pair of them bumbled down to the kitchen, where said boots were propped up on the table. Teddy’s ninth birthday had been just two days ago, and he had asked for purple boots with a gold buckle, “Just like professor Dumbledore in that painting you have, Harry”. So Harry had scoured Diagon Alley for oldfashioned wizarding boots, to no avail. And while many shopkeepers would have been “Happy to custom make something for you, Mr. Harry Potter sir,”, Harry had of course left giftshopping until the last minute, and had run out of time. Eventually Hermione had sent him a catalogue for kids’ costumes, and he had Express-Owl Ordered said boots in the nick of time. Teddy had squealed in delight, clapping his hands.
In sleep, Potters face is slack, but he looks even more exhausted. His grungy grey t-shirt has slid to the side at the neck to reveal a too-bony collarbone. His beard is wild, his hair even wilder, and he has pushed his glasses askew. Draco sighs, tries not to feel concerned, or sorry. They haven’t really had a conversation yet, but it hardly seems the time to start one. You can’t really charm a tired person into being agreeable. Or at least, Draco never could. And definitely not with Potter. He huffs, a little indignant, and puts the mug down carefully on the little sidetable next to the couch. He then casts a stasis charm on it, and cautiously removes Potter’s glasses to set them next to the mug. Potter looks so young. And he’s a
“No Teddy, don’t do the scar thing” Harry sighed, straightening Teddy’s jumper. Teddy had a penchant for metamorphing into anyone’s younger sibling. Which was, without a doubt, an absolute nightmare to keep track of when outside in public. While Teddy was good at keeping his promise and not changing his looks outside, he stubbornly wanted to mimic Harry’s scar.
, had outweighed the annoying minutes of shaving, and he had gladly complied. These days, he just felt so tired. And it wasn’t like anyone was touching his face
“Nasty rumours are going around” she says, indignation creeping in her tone. Harry raises a bushy eyebrow. “And before you ask, they’re not about you, dear”. She interrupts his asking. Well, that’s a relief then. He breathes out. It seemed however something that affected Mrs. Picklewilly personally, if she was so unamused by such a salacious topic as was spreading like Fiendfyre. He waited, eating another little praline that she’d brought out before. It was quite the spread today, and he wondered if she’d been planning this little lunch. He was a little irritated at having another person in his life fussing with him, but he was also a little charmed. It was rather surprising that this little old lady had such seemingly genuine concern for his life, enough to do so. With a huff, he thought it was rather like Malfoy, just forcing his ‘care’ on him, without his consent really, and with strange motives, and he wasn’t able to refuse properly. Unlike with Malfoy however, he thought Mrs. Picklewilly had no ulterior motives than just stuffing him with more food and satisfying her need for company and gossip. Mrs. Picklewilly takes another sip, then almost bangs down her cup on the saucer, and it winces.
“I guess we’ll hear about it soon, eh? At least Neville’s already got an owl to send us, if it does happen” Harry laughed.
“Focus, Draco” he muttered under his breath. So, what to do about this information? If it got out, it would definitely hurt Potter, and by extension, Hermione. And in her state, he didn't want to risk anything, even if it made him an 'overbearing dragon'. He huffed. Ron had no right to call him that, since he was the one padding Hermione's chairs and escorting her home every day. Nevertheless she needed to know that certain departments  were infringing on their freedom of movement. His eyes flicked to another piece of information concerning Reginald Edgecombe. Beautiful Edgecombe was using his good looks in more departments, or rather,
Malfoy’s long legs evidently carry him downstairs faster, as he’s already put on the kettle and has started to unpack his groceries, putting fresh produce on the counter by the time Harry gets there. Harry stands in the doorway, watching him for a bit. It is odd, seeing Malfoy occupied with such ordinary tasks as unpacking groceries, or cooking, or tucking in Teddy. There was a quiet efficiency about him. Not because he was fast at what he did, there was no haste involved. Rather, it was that each movement was done with careful deliberation. Harry wondered if it was the product of his etiquette lessons, just like his perfect posture no doubt was. Or rather, perhaps he was just this meticulous, in everything, like the way he picked out the flowers for each of his bouquets. The kettle was whistling, and Harry stepped forward. He hadn’t yet decided how to deal with Malfoy.
“Teddy’s going to be fine. We’re going for a checkup later this week.” Mrs. Picklewilly’s sharp eyes hold his for a bit, and she sips from her dainty china.
“What kind?” asked Teddy’s voice from behind Potter. Ah. Hermione was right. Pastries would get him in the door.
He promptly dropped the shears he was holding, exclaimed “Mildred!”, and clutched at the tiny little owl.
“Really? Because it looks like I’m here buying my mother flowers, and you’re here…. to… what did we decide on?” a light smirk played on his lips. Harry met those glittering, amused eyes.
“Thank you, Potter. I’ll come get you when I’m done.” Malfoy dismissed him, already perusing the buckets full of carnations, lilies, fanged geraniums, and dancing tulips. A bunch of ever-blooming poppies were shivering excitedly at the attention Malfoy was giving them. He smiled slightly, whispering “Yes, you’re very pretty” before continuing his search. The poppies nearly fainted in admiration. Harry snorted, hoping Malfoy couldn’t hear him or notice him watching.
, and he had no way of knowing whether the boy was okay. Whether Potter could even deal with it properly, like family could. Unease settled in his stomach. And Potter, who was already fraying at the edges, was clearly
I promised this was more action packed and then I started writing and now that action is in the next chapter. But! Hermione/Draco friendship! Draco being cool with a Squib! In another suit! Yes?
to his little office in his department. Madam Beauregard nodded at him steadily seeing him arrive, and gave him one of her little smiles. “Good morning, Lord Malfoy” she said, addressing him by his title for the first time. He gave her a sharp smile. “Good morning, Madam Beauregard.” And he knew he had her support, from that alone. She lifted her wand casually, and all the papers on everyone’s desk –each one headlined with “Little Lord to Lose all to Death-Eater Father” were lifted in the air, and burned with a little puff. “No time for gossip, today, do we?” she said a gleam in her eye. He inclined his head, and walked to Hermione’s office. She’d have heard, of course. They needed to discuss damage control. Not for him, no, he wouldn’t involve her in this. But to their cause.
Leaving the reporters where they were, they went into the back, where Neville put the kettle on, and they settled down. It was much quieter in the back, between the more tropical plants, furthest from the storefront. Two cups of strong tea and a frankly disturbingly large piece of treacle tart later (Harry was suspicious of a plot to get him to eat sweets, if not other things), Nevillle and Harry had decided to put up a ward around the side of the shop to keep the noise from outside out, and a sort of screening around the doorpost for any and all recording material; Harry had thought of the Muggle anti-theft gates at stores, and modified a monitoring charm from his Auroring.
be disgusting. Harry was asking himself why he had listened to Mrs. Granger’s insistence on having kids eat healthy breakfasts for the umpteenth time, since it always resulted in Teddy protesting.
“Magic cannot vanish; it is like water. A substance that has to exist in one form or other. It has to contain space, wherever and however it can.” Harry frowned, opened his mouth to ask a question, but the Healer held up a hand to halt him. “What is means it that, when children have growth-spurts, or their magic for some reason is released, they cannot channel or contain it properly. Usually, the magic goes
“Ehm” Teddy starts, and starts rummaging around in the grocery bag, putting some fruit on the table. “I got some slime buckets from uncle George’s shop…” he starts. Draco raises an eyebrow, trying to contain the spill of images in his head. He fails.
“Oh, I’m not even a person, now, Belby?” Malfoy sneers again, and with all the dignity he can muster, wipes his face with a tea towel. There’s still some flower dusting his collar, but his posture is again rigid, his chin high.
”. Well, Draco just tended to disagree with her on these things. Nearly two months of pining and lovesickness was
He dredged up a weak smile for Teddy, and got the floo powder from the jar by the fire. “Let’s go, pup”.
“Say, Drake." He started now, obviously having some sort of idea lodged in his head, ''What’s up with that Harry Potter guy? So much rumours everywhere, it’s like he’s a scorned maiden or something.” Draco grimaced.
I do, Potter. I’d be a lousy secretary if I didn’t. And, much as it pains me to admit, Granger’s my friend. Though you’d never hear me say it about Weasley”. He cleared his throat, and pulled himself upright again. Oddly enough, Harry felt himself lean forwards a bit.
Only then did Draco notice that it was Teddy that was making the table stir; His hair was slowly changing colour and his limbs were shaking.
“Thank you, chap!” he exclaimed upon seeing Harry’s transfigured self behind the large bouquet. He eyed the apron. “Spectral Sprouts, eh? Isn’t that where Harry Potter has fled to? You know ‘m?” he inquired.
“I’ll have them sing “The Astronomer’s Dream”, if you can?”. Harry hummed his assent, and at the till set to instructing the little flowers to sing the right song.
“It is green and has yellow mushrooms! He looks dis-GUS-ting” Teddy giggles, and he looks like he hasn’t been ill in ages, happy. Draco laughs too. How opportune, really, since it’ll give him time to start dinner before Potter throws him out.
“I’ll be right back”. The Healer stood up, and exited the door. Right behind him, a tired looking Hermione came in, closely followed by Ron.
“Why, yes, of course Harry will be the other godparent” she frowns a bit at him, although her eyes still sparkle. “Who else would Ron ask, you silly Slytherin?”. He tries to hold back a groan but fails. He hears Hermione laugh again, and he knows he’s being laughed at.
“You must be Neville Longbottom, right? You own the shop?” he inquires, his eyes turning sharp again.
Still on his hands and knees he heard the bell above the door jingle, announcing a new customer. Three clipped, sharp steps announced a voice.
He hears Blaise’s raised voice, and he Goblin’s stern response. Not unsympathetic sounding, however. Nothing could be done. He left them to it, and stood to leave.
“So. Ehm. Good, then. Well, Ron and I wanted to tell you about something.” She started hesitantly. Harry put down his fork, and raised his eyebrows. Ron swallowed thickly, and took Hermione’s hand. She blushed.
Hermione turns this way and that, looking slightly awkward standing in front of the mirror in pinned-up robes.
“Hello, Potter” he nods. Ever polite, Harry thinks, and grunts back in greeting, navigating Teddy up the steps, who mumbles incomprehensibly. For a moment, he’s annoyed that Malfoy’s not helping him get Teddy up the steps to the front door, but then remembers Malfoy is already carrying a grocery bag, also ostensibly to help them. This prickles Harry even further as he opens the door and stumbles in with Teddy. Malfoy follows him silently, and puts down the bag on the little spindly legged console table in the hallway, and then, as if he’s somehow known what Harry was thinking, reaches out to hoist Teddy up with him.
my child. I meant what I said in the hospital, Ted”. A hopeful little smile was spreading on Teddy’s young face.
“Come along, nosy parker.” Straightening his jacket, furtively casting a de-creasing charm on his pants, he made way for the door in swift steps. Lawrence scrambled up from his seat. They apparated to the nearest Diagon apparition point, in an alleyway just outside
The Ministry was, as ever, buzzing with activity. There were some reporters loitering about in the Atrium, but not many more than was usual. Relieved no one could see him, he made his way to the elevators, and pressed the button for level three, where the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures was situated. He checked the card again, to see who to ask for, and he suddenly felt very heavy.
It had enraged Harry to the point of wanting to tear everything out, only to have the house figuratively dig its heels in.  Small protests from the house against pulling up carpet, somehow nailing itself to the floorboards beneath. Living room wallpaper rippling and changing patterns frantically when Hermione approached it with a peeler, only to have to pause and ask Harry if he still wanted it ripped off –and he had decided he could live with fleur-de-lis, since it wasn’t the Black family crest. Upon removing the ominous elf-heads, a leaded glass window had appeared, brightening the space with sunlight streaming in, nevermind that there were supposed to be neighbours next to them. Slowly, efforts to make the house livable became a negotiation instead of a battle. There were some rooms however, Harry daren’t set foot in, even after years. The formal dining room, the walls covered with the family tapestry, remained dusty and in disrepair. The attic and most of the second floor too, were still closed off. In the end, he had always thought those rooms would be filled with what was to become his own family. And, it had, for a bit. Teddy had come into his life and Grimmauld place at three. Filling up the hallways with wailing, sleepless nights in the dark. Little giggles of laughter, pattering feet on the stairs giving Harry heart palpitations and frantically finding spells to child-proof everything. Nights full of worry, when Teddy wouldn’t stop crying and refused to eat anything Harry cooked. Those nights, too, he had fallen down face first into Sirius’ old bed imagining he could still smell his godfather. Talk to him, even only in his head, because who could say it wasn’t real?
“Potter. What are you doing here?”, Malfoy asked, before recomposing himself and adding “Never mind really, can the florist please help me compose a bouquet?”.
“The younger, yes. May I come in, Potter?” Draco motioned to step forward, but Potter didn’t move away.
I personally feel like this chapter is a mess, but I really wanted to get something out, and make progress in the story.
“What a nightmare. If you’d rather I go?”. At Neville's raised eyebrows, he repeated the question, louder this time. Neville shook his head, and took off the earmuffs.
Standing on a little step, Teddy was beating eggs furiously with a fork, bits having already flown into his currenly fuchsia coloured hair. His eyes were his own honey-colour, and with his scruffy play-clothes, he couldn’t look more like the incarnation of both his parents.
that could compel him to answer? It must be the suit, or whatever was apparently so magnetic about him that even the flowers took notice.
“Just wanted to see how you are.” He says. Harry crosses his arms. Malfoy’s humming again, and the sound is carrying into the hallway. Marcus tilts his head. “Oh, you’re not alone here?” some sort of rakish smile takes over his face. “Didn’t know you had it in you, Harry” he winks, and it suddenly reminds Harry uncomfortably of Lockhart. He’s not sure whether he’s offended. Perhaps he s
“Well spotted, Potter.” He straightens up, strokes the snitches on his waistcoat. “She doesn’t enjoy the way I dress to dinner, no. But it’s not that.” He says quietly. No, it wasn’t just the muggle suits in bright colours he took to wearing to family dinner every Thursday, although it definitely annoyed mother. Harry had finished binding the flowers together, fluffing the leaves a bit. This time, it had to do with him rejecting yet another potential bethrothed.
“See! This is why you deserve this mail! Already trying to buy your way out of it!” the Mailwizard growls at him. Draco takes a step back, lest the spittle hit him in the face. Which would add nicely to the pile of mail about his person, of course. This day was
After a few minutes, Malfoy nodded to himself and then swiftly gathered a bunch of violet geraniums, meadowsweet, and deep purple carnations. Harry straightened up and tried to look busy again with the still incomplete display of sleep-sachets.
He checked on Tommy Matheson, who worked on the muggle literary canon in Hogwarts, looking to extend it to movies with a technology called “Blu-Ray”, whatever that might be. Draco had a ‘television’, certainly, but his “VCR” player had gathered dust ever since he bought it years ago –metaphorically of course, since he wouldn’t abide actual dust in his apartment. Even Ron had recently stated that “VCR” was old fashioned when he and Hermione had come over for dinner, and he should move on to “DVD”’s before “he turned into a crusty old pureblood dragon” for real. Draco huffed a bit at all those nonsensical letter-combinations. At least Wizarding acronyms usually made sense. And he was definitely not a “crusty old dragon”, no matter how often Ron called him that. He owned skinny jeans, for crying out loud (although they were designer,
At breakfast he had grown himself a long white beard, although matching eyebrows had proved too distracting while eating his cereal. Afterwards, they had giggled trying to comb out Colour-Changing Crispy Crups from his beard, Teddy deciding to keep it until just before tea, when he got tired.
After soup and introductory topics have been passed over, his mother finally comes to the point. “We need to do something about your situation, darling”. She states, dabbing her lips with her napkin. Draco looks at his mother’s stern face. No use trying to pretend he doesn’t know what she’s referring to, then. He sets his spoon down.
“Don’t forget about blood traitors like yours truly” Neville adds, grinning a little. Lawrence seems to relax a little again. Harry takes a deep breath.
“However, I have always strived to gain the approval of every adult I looked up to, that could give me that affection.” He laughs a little bitterly at that. It hadn’t worked at the Dursley’s, and it certainly hadn’t affected Dumbledore’s plans for him; he was always meant to be a sacrifice.
Hermione had struck up a friendship with a girl from the bakery, who turned out to not be a girl so much as an Aunt of two little boys, a little younger than Teddy’s age, and they were passing a football on the field. Sanaz was getting them all coffee from a nearby stand. She’d also gotten them some strawberry creampuffs in a bulky Muggle cooler, which Harry was silently eyeing.
“Well, then you should call me Draco, Teddy”. Teddy nodded seriously. Draco smiled at the boy. He thought he could like his cousin.
All in all, the house was livable, but not overly homey. Not somewhere you'd want to be, all alone, rattling about. Harry figured he’d get round to redoing it someday, really. When Teddy was older maybe, or –and he cursed himself now for being so sentimental-, with someone else, expanding their little family. But he could forget about all of that, what with the horribleness of the Witch’ Weekly article, and Marcus’ lousy scribble saying “
if that Marcus Belby had apparently started an underhanded campaign with Edgecombe to give the conservatives a stronghold in Enforcement? So what if Potter's ex turned out to be even more of a prick than he had already suspected? Belby had managed to push for more active tracking on former Death Eaters, as well as what were now called “disruptors of public order”. In this case, Hermione’s people. Their network was being targeted, not even that subtly. And he personally could be affected by these developments, too. Shite.
He thanked her for the tea, and went back to Neville’s shop, begging off work for the rest of the day. Neville took a look at his white face, and seemed to understand. A corner of the days’
“I can’t wait to tell Teddy, he’ll be thrilled” he laughs. Malfoy turns towards him again, his eyes still watery, an attractive flush spanning his cheeks, over the bridge of his nose. So quickly, Malfoy lost all composure he had. It was a revelation.
“Who’s that?”. Teddy came and peeked from behind Potter’s shoulder, and Draco spotted tawny curls in a pale face, before it disappeared again. Potter moved back a bit more, half closing the door already.
Mrs. Picklewilly cleared her throat, and then stated “I’d like you to take the young Mr. Potter to the Ministry Function.” Silence fell. What?
“The shop-owner across the street from Neville? The pickle-shop woman?” she looks slightly bewildered. Draco nods. “What does she have to do with our bill?” Draco leans forward.
As would his suit, for that matter. Of course he shouldn’t have worn the grey velvet when he knew he was going to be about. It would be utterly ruined. But it was a comfortable suit, warm enough to ward off the chill of spring this week. Plus, the waistcoat was embroidered with little bumblebees, which he imagined were rather adorable and disarming. At least, it was what the taylor had told him. Of course, this was also the taylor who had tried to sell him lilac tweed, which had given him disgusting flashbacks to Gilderoy Lockhart, and had instigated a lengthy coughing fit. But the velvet was tactile, and even his mother had complimented him on it when she had seen it first.
“Will it affect his metamorphmagus abilities? He loves using them, you know”. Harry smiles a little bit, thinking of Teddy’s recent outrageous haircolours. The Healer smiled at him. It was rather attractive, even if he looked tired.
“Goldenrod, the yellow tufty plants, are meant as a token for encouraging. Sunflowers you must recognize, implore his loyalty to our cause. They’re also quite beautiful, don’t you agree?”. Potter hummed.
The question blindsided him. Teddy was nine now. They’d had something like this conversation before, when Teddy, at five, had called him “daddy” after spending the week at Bill and Fleur’s, and making friends with some of the nearby Muggle children. Bill had taken him aside quickly when he had seen Harry drain of colour, stating that the other kids had asked Teddy where his mom and dad were. In kid-logic, of course Harry was his dad. He was the one raising him, the only “grown up” he knew to take care of him; memories of Andromeda - “Nana” – taking care of him had already begun to fade. After all, Teddy had become his to take care of at three.
“Hmm?” Draco hummed, raising a perfectly manicured eyebrow. “I take it you have been delivering my arrangements all over the ministry, then?”
“My teeth are going to rot soon, what with Hannah’s baking, Mrs. Picklewilly’s fruitcake, and Hermione’s pregnancy cravings. I don’t think Teddy remembers what vegetables look like, honestly” Potter groaned. Draco felt himself smile, again. It was all rather ridiculous: the bombardment of sweets going round, the mess Potter was in, and now this; him sitting in Potters kitchen in the Black ancestral home.
“I let many people die for me in the war, so I could continue with my 'mission'.” He starts, and Neville wants to interrupt, but Harry silences him with a held-up hand. He briefly checks the store, and wards it wandlessly. He doesn’t want any misunderstandings about the war, but he also doesn’t want the whole world to overhear him. “I manipulated people to give me what I needed to stop the war, I lied, and tricked”. He states. Lawrence’s eyes are wide. Neville’s mouth is pinched.
“Yes. As I mentioned, I am already late to dinner, and she has reason to be cross with me”. He feels Harry’s gaze linger a bit, taking in his appearance overtly. He tries not to preen; he loves this suit, the colour making his skin glow and his hair shine.
“Take a deep breath, now, come on sweetheart.” And Potter led Teddy through some deep breathing. Eventually, after several minutes, the curls turned brown again, and Teddy slumped against Potter. Frankly, Potter looked like crying too, stroking his godson’s back. Draco stood uselessly.
“Christ, stop it! Marcus, calm down.” He takes his arm, and drags him to the hallway. Teddy is standing at the top of the stairs, hidden by shadows, but Harry still knows it’s him. Kids were never as sneaky as they thought they were.
“Really? And you have no ulterior motives to dinner with me?! I find that hard to believe, after reading
While  much more persuasive –she had a point, the old hag, in that the function was in less than a month and he had no proper relationship with Potter yet, it still wouldn’t have convinced him to actually be so crass as to barge into Potters house. No, what actually convinced him, was Neville.
“What was that?” Malfoy leaned forwards, and Harry was hit with a whiff of his expensive cologne, surprisingly warm and woodsy. It was quite a rush, being the center of Malfoy’s full attention. He felt his magic unfurl inside him, just a little, to reach out.
Harry’s slowly mulling Hermione’s letter over while he’s tending to the Horned Aloe Vera, which were especially potent against Dragonfire burns. He doesn’t want to pop one of the little spiky things lest he waste some of the precious liquid inside the horns.
“Children’s magic grows much like children themselves; their magical core is tied to their life force, maturing during puberty, then stabilizing. Sometimes they instinctively know how to channel it properly, in the earliest of wandless magic. Sometimes they don’t, hence the occasional burst of accidental magic.” Harry hummed.
Draco coughed awkwardly. “I’m afraid I’m not Granger, Potter”. He stated, still disbelieving at Potters appearance. Potter frowned, squinted again. At this point Draco realized Potter wasn’t wearing his glasses; perhaps that was why he was squinting so much.
“Yes, isn’t it amazing?! They zoom around too, if you touch the buttons, look!” Teddy demonstrated for Draco, and he felt himself smile despite himself.
“Malfoy’s family was one of Voldemort’s followers”. Lawrence nods; he clearly knows all of this. “His parents, Lucius and Narcissa, had only one child. They, like many other parents, raised that child in their image: they taught him how to ride a broom, to say please and thank you, and equally, that his blood was worth more than that of those around him”. Harry has said this too in his testimonial at the trials. Lawrence bobs his leg up and down impatiently.
This was it. The axe had fallen. The sword of Damocles that had hung over his head, had finally dropped itself in his stupid, weak little neck. Draco sat defeated at the polished mahogany desk in one of the little privacy rooms in Gringotts, eyes drawn to the distorted reflection of himself he saw in the surface. In the background, Blaise was tiredly arguing with their Gringotts Goblin, Mordok, trying to find a loophole that Draco knew well wasn’t there.
He had heard from the Ministry gossip-mill that Hermione had sent the other interviewers away ten minutes after Malfoy’d entered for his interview, and then locked and warded the room. No one exactly knew what had occurred, but take-out had been delivered, nearly a whole night had passed, and they had emerged in the wee hours of the morning, looking red eyed and worse for wear. Malfoy had been hired on the spot, and
“I’m very proud, yes.” he answered, grinning widely at Teddy, who grinned back, his hair now Hermione's bushy brown curls. God, he loved that kid.
“Harry didn’t tell me! Ron and I met him in Mungo’s. It was... awful.” Her voice was heavy with emotion. Draco debated whether to mention he had already visited Grimmauld place, but chose not to. He wasn’t sure Hermione would approve the way he went about it, and he didn’t want to be stopped yet. He still needed Potter. But he could plant the seed for her approval, today. He tapped his finger to his lips, considering.
“Are you okay?” Teddy looked at him, perceptive for his nine years, reflecting Harry’s own green eyes back at him, hair sticking up on every direction.
!” he thrusts the paper in Draco’s face again. Draco hadn’t read it, hadn’t wanted to, and his old cowardly self hadn’t even dared, to be frank. He takes it, tries to still his trembling hand. He had been humiliated, hexed, hurt, and laughed at today. He didn’t want to add losing a friend to the list. So he took it, and read it briefly, while Lawrence stood in front of him, ready for a fight.
that, if not more. And if Draco couldn’t vote in the Wizengamot, including Potter never voting –despite holding the Black
, just, you know...” he trailed off. Harry took the folder, looked up at the man. Did he imagine the blush that was spreading over the man’s pale skin?
Healer Lindsay smiled, and briefly explained, as he had before, what had happened and the measures taken, and about the potions regimen Teddy was supposed to take. He didn’t mention the mind healer again, however.
Harry tries to swallow around the knot in his throat, but fails. He feels rather awful, disappointed and exposed, in his own house.
“I’m certain you are aware that young Mr. Lupin is my cousin.” Hermione lifted her gaze to his, shrewd.
Incidentally, one of the first things he had learned to make for himself, after moving to a mostly-muggle neighbourhood and trying a recipe from a book the previous owner had left. The puddings were a recent addition to his repertoire, finicky little custards. He had shed his outer robes in favor of his grey slacks and blue shirtsleeves, even if he felt a bit exposed. He had resisted rolling up his cuffs, not sure what Teddy would think of the mangled Dark Mark on his arm. He was certain Potter would throw him out immediately upon seeing it.
, so to speak, and sought to motivate him to have a ‘proper family’ by dangling the trust fund before him. It hadn’t yet worked. It wouldn’t, even now, he resolved. He forced himself to unclench his jaw, folded his white hands in his lap. He felt cold. He set himself to prying off the silver and emerald Malfoy crest-ring, wanting to pelt it across the room like a petulant child. He wouldn’t, of course. The Goblin would just pick it up and put it in the Family vault. His father’s vault. He set it on the table with a little
His mind was suddenly abound with all the things he never dared ask his mother. She had never spoken to him about her time at Hogwarts, apart from relating details about her early courtship with his father, which started when she was in sixth year. But never about the things he wondered about; had she been nervous about exams, had she stayed up at night gossiping with the girls in her dorm? Who was her favourite teacher? Did she ever fret about bad grades as Draco had? But now was clearly not the time to ask this near-stranger about all of that. It would betray much about his relationship to his mother, and he didn’t want to cause his mother discomfort trying to find out about things she didn’t want to share. So, sat here in front of him was a woman who was a veritable well of information, and he couldn’t touch it until he knew her angle. The Malfoy pride was a fragile thing, especially so after the war. This Mrs. Picklewilly seemed to read all that in his face, and smiled at him, blue eyes twinkling.
recently with progressive wizards. But she was no stranger to muggle things; he knew she also loved her stapler and sellotape, and a deft hand at using computers too, something that still occasionally baffled Draco, despite the classes he had taken at his local community center for the “digitally challenged”. Which apparently had only included elderly muggles, and Draco, the pureblood wizard.
“I know! I just need some flowers!” He exclaims again, frantically now. The thought of his mother’s disapproving frown prompts him to blurt out “I was held up at work and I really need to bring flowers to dinner to placate mother so she’s -” he finally manages to stop himself. Merlin, how embarrassing, he must be beet red at this point. Harry snorts, but allows him to pick a bouquet before closing, adding in the lullaby-singing baby’s breath that he knows his mother loves.
All thoughts of asking Healer Lindsay to the Ministry Function lay forgotten, as he continues to wonder what he actually knows about who Draco Malfoy is, these days.
“Would you like to meet him?” he countered therefore. Now smiling broadly, wide teeth gleaming, Lawrence nodded. He was
“You know him, right? Went to school with him?” inquired Lawrence, trying to look innocently interested.
’. Somehow they got through most of it before the man came again, days later, to do the same thing all over again. And somehow, Harry still wasn’t protesting. He shook his head. It was probably because of Teddy, and because he still couldn’t shake the lingering apathy that had overtaken him a few months ago, after the intial hurt had sliced through him and he just shut down. Things hurt less now.
, Slytherin as I am, waste my time on things that are useless frivolities?” he leaned in to Potter, bracing his forearms on the till. He was close enough now to get a whiff of Potters smell, and his nostrils flared. He smelled, for lack of a better word,
However, this chapter took me a month to write and I seem to have forgotten all of what I've written before. If there are any major inconsistencies, please tell me so I can fix them. Updates for now, will be there when they'll be there. Hopefully every month at least.
Thus, Draco muses, as Wizengamot member Rattlesby drones on about the importance of pureblood rituals at Easter, they will not win. Blaise had recently informed him that Rattlesby lost a considerable fortune dabbling in the trade of magical creatures –potentially the illegal kind. And, as the meeting draws to a close, he decides he’ll put his own little feeler out on the others, just to wipe the smirks off their faces. He’s sure Lawrence will find something, dig long enough until something nasty shows up. They’re purebloods. Draco knows as no other how many horrible little secrets can be hidden by a good name and a sheen of tradition.
“Let me think…". He was leaning forwards to the flowers, which instantly reacted to his presence -or magic, as they had done before. A faint smile appeared on his face, as if pleased . He tapped a slender finger on his chin while his gleaming grey eyes surveyed the display. After a moment, he nodded to himself. "I’ll take three pink peonies, seven of these white roses, and some of that lullaby-singing baby’s breath”. Harry started gathering the stems as Malfoy talked.
the one that makes those weird drawings of cars with dragontails, and the microwave with whiskers?” he exclaims, looking a bit bewildered.
“It’s fine really, mrs. Picklewilly.” He croaked out. “It’s been nearly a month now, you know.” She tutted disbelievingly.
“I’m not opposed to meeting her, if she’s agreeable” Malfoy says rather stiffly, although he winks at Teddy, who’s beaming at him.
Neville had left just before noon to have lunch with Hannah, who was due in a matter of weeks, perhaps days. He had even trained their little owl to perch on Hannah's shoulder indefinitely, so that it could take off to find Neville at a moment's notice. It was hilarious, and adorable.
. Harry had to laugh. “If you say so, pup”, ruffling Teddy’s hair. “But it’s still a no”, he added more sternly, frowning down. Teddy stopped blinking plaintively and sighed, tugging his sweater crooked again. Harry chuckled.
“No! I have a friend who’s concerned. He’s also Teddy’s cousin, incidentally” she smiled at Sanaz, who nodded thoughfully.
“They can query via the normal channels. I request you redirect mail addressed to me to our query box.” he answers sharply. “Please.” He adds, through his teeth.
“No!” came the reply, and Malfoy turned away again. “It’s the onions” he said defensively. “for the curry, you know”. Harry snorted in disbelief.
“It’s the same message. God, I can’t believe he sent you a personal note and not me!” he looks a bit disgruntled. Harry laughs at the jealous tone.
“But I remember little Dora coming home after a boy broke her heart, and it took longer than this, sweetheart.” She sipped at her glass, lips shiny from the liquid. “Oh, how she cried. Inconsolable for many weeks, until she was allowed to join the local muggle Karate class.” He could hear the smile in her voice.
. Draco starts unpacking the bag further as Teddy is starts to eat an apple. He doesn’t mention washing it, and lets him at it.
He might fail to make a proper dinner for himself every night, but at least he, and by extension Teddy, were well provided with homemade sweet goods. Of course Molly would hand him homemade pies every day of the week if he let her, but he flat out refused to let her see how much it cost him to keep things going. Especially after the Witch’ Weekly article, which still made him feel like crawling up in a corner forever. But he had Teddy, who relied on him, who would yell at him to pay attention when he made a match-stick bridge and wanted to light it up (he’d put paid to that idea just in time), or when he was nagging at Harry that he didn’t want to have cereal for dinner the third time in a row.
He greeted the waitress and they sat down, Lawrence to a frankly frighteningly large tuna-mayo sandwich, Draco to some peppermint tea. He waited until he had finished at least half of it, before starting their conversation.
“Of course not, dear!” she exclaimed, rattling the spoon in her cup. Seeing the look on Draco’s face, she winked at him saucily.
He thought the worst had been over, with his breakup splashed all over the news two days after Marcus had left Grimmauld for the last time, smiling apologetically, leaving Harry on the doorstep feeling like he had been caught by an ambush on an easy Auror mission. By his own partner, for crying out loud. He had no idea how all of a sudden, everyone had known about their breakup. At that point, he'd only told Ron and Hermione that the two of them "weren't doing so well".
“Well, I didn’t buy cereal, actually” he admits. He had intended to bring them some healthy dinner foods, things that would make Potter less pale, maybe wean Teddy off the pastries. Trying not to sound too much like a boring adult he states:
“Whatever, Draco. I don’t want to hear your excuses”. He walks to the door, and Draco looks on helplessly as he opens it. “Don’t call me again, you
Draco watches Potter’s face drain of all colour. He’s already halfway to the floo when he remembers Draco.
He wasn’t yet ready to give up. He hadn’t given up when he was living under Voldemort, suffered through the fall of his family’s name, and this trick of his father was just another little cherry on top of the shit-cake that was post-war Malfoy life. He could deal. He mentally tallied the list of things he needed to do, and took a deep breath. He straightened his spine, looked himself in the eye, and apparated to the Ministry apparition point.
, if he didn’t know Neville was honorouble and honest to his Gryffindor bones, than he would’ve been suspicious he’d been set upon by Mrs. Picklewilly. He had deftly avoided her trying to catch his eye when he left Spectral Sprouts, flipping up his collar against the chilly wind and oncoming rain.
He curled up small, and deposited his glasses and wand on the nightstand with a soft clatter. He didn’t even bother changing his clothes, the sterile smell of St. Mungo’s still clinging to him. It had been the worst day in a long while. The thought of Teddy, sweet Teddy, his bright godson, being strapped down in a St. Mungo’s bed, his magic going haywire, was something Harry hoped he’d never see again.
“I hear you had an unfortunate slime-incident, Potter”, Draco starts, attempting a jest. Potter groans, but his eyes twinkle.
Molly laughed “oh, that wonderful boy” she muttered fondly. “If you’re sure about that breakfast?” she asked, sounding worried, and Harry nodded “I’m sure, I’m the only one at the shop today.”
“Well then, I cannot but notice that this season alone you have rejected both the Greengass girl and the Rosewood girl. Both excellent matches, if I may say so myself.” He feels his mother’s burning gaze on his face, and wills himself not to blush. His cheeks are doomed today.
“Not at all. I noticed his magic calming down as you spoke to him, and I draw my own conclusions from that. However, given the situation-”
“Do any of those use computers or cellphones, by any chance?”. Draco cocked his head, thinking it unlikely. Or they might, without knowing how to use them. Draco refused to think of himself of being in the same category. Yes, he might be pureblood, and computers weren’t his forte, but he had taken a class! With elderly Muggles!
“Teddy, hey, Ted, calm down” Potter took Teddy’s hands, clasped them tightly, Teddy continued to shake ever more violently.
of that thing, Malfoy! Came home to Teddy and he pretended to gag!”. Draco grinned. He knew Potter lived with his godson, his Black cousin. He ignored the little jab of regret in his chest, and pressed on. Potter was hooked; interested. Now he just needed to reel him in, a little. He leaned forward just a tad more, cocking his head.
“Also dear, while I have agreed to hold off the good families for now, I was wondering who you were planning to bring to the Function in a couple of weeks?”. Draco had trailed off on relating the details of Shelly’s report, and now pursed his lips.
managed to vacuum the kitchen and living room, but not tackled the laundry at all, having come home only an hour before. He’d set the table too, for three.
, that was. He could vividly imagine the gleeful faces at the DMLE when he came in, letters full of hexes and curses flying about him, begging for help. Oh, how they would just
He’d never pegged Ron for a mother hen, but it’s certainly the title that fits best. Auror Weasley, fussiest father to be. Although from the stories he's heard about Molly Weasley, perhaps it runs in the family.
“Do I detect some dried sleeping-draught ingredients?”.  Harry was not about to admit to hating them; that would make them agree on something, and that thought was enough to make him shudder.
“Nothing wrong with wanting to make amends, is there?” she said pleasantly, and started unpacking the Muggle cooler. Harry was starting to fume. Why was no one taking his side? It was weird, Malfoy coming by.
to ignore civilian concerns as a Ministry worker, Malfoy” the Mailwizard replies nastily. Draco suppresses a sigh, starting to feel a bit nauseated because of the smelly gas.
a hypocrite, seeing that Potter had likely shagged his way through half of wizarding Britain, with his Savior status, but he could work with it. Embarrassment was as good a start as any, he supposed.
Latin explanations are at the bottom; so too, are the meanings of the flowers in this one. I did take Latin in school but admit it's been too long and I looked all of it up. I also don't actually know of floristry (it's all made up generally anyway, like any good cultural phenomenon), but I have a source I'm consistently using, and I'll just stick to that.
“Say, why don’t you go up and take some of that Pepper-Up, and I’ll see you in a minute, ‘kay?” Teddy nods quickly, and with a last look at Malfoy –who smiles encouragingly at him-, he goes upstairs.
, I want that. What Ron and Hermione have. A boring, domestic existence, complete with messy family dinners and sappy traditions, all of it”. It rushed out, his deepest desire; family.
“I wish they would stop, you know. You wouldn’t believe how many reporters there are hounding him since it happened”. Well, he could certainly believe it. He’d seen them standing in the atrium, waiting to meet an auror, or Belby, or Robards, for comments ever since the infamous Auror Partner’s Romantic Breakup was published in The Prophet. He just hadn’t known there was also an article like… this. And now Hermione was worried, just before she had to meet the Conservative Faction that pillock Edgecombe was also part of. Bollocks. This was hardly a coincidence. If he wasn't so angry, he would have admired their tactics. He deliberately unclenched his jaw, which took some effort.
know, they are carefully crafted messages with a clear purpose”. Potter looked at him disbelievingly.
to lord it over him. Not even mentioning, Belby could be there. He was getting a serious headache at this point. He returned to his own department stiffly, hurriedly going to his little office, ignoring the questioning looks from those working at their desks. He was sure he made quite the spectacle, but he didn’t want to ask for any more help. He would deal with it.
This was pretty bad, all considering. Accidental magic was common in children, but this sort of seizures, he’d never seen before. Magic wasn’t supposed to
That afternoon, Molly had gone to lie down for a bit after lunch, as she was want to do. The kids were good about it, being old enough to understand that this ‘freedom’ was built on trust, and didn’t misbehave too much. They were allowed to roam the garden and grounds up to the neighbours’ fence, eat a snack if they wanted to, and use all the art supplies at hand. There had been some terrible messes and spills, but nothing broken, no one hurt. Until today, that was.
“Go, go!” gestured Potter, behind the flowers, and Neville was gone, Apparated in his apron, still clutching the little bird.
Draco sighed. His mother’s missive might not have been overly convincing, despite his loyalty and love for her. No, another letter had come, later in the evening, from Mrs. Picklewilly, of all people. Her owl was a surprisingly mean thing with ribbons (!) tied to his clawed feet, and had tried to nip him when he wanted to take them off. What self-respecting owl allowed itself to be adorned was completely beyond him, but he was quietly impressed by its tenacity. Also, how had it even found his Muggle apartment!? Clearly he shouldn’t underestimate Mrs. Picklewilly more than he had already; she had some remarkable Snape-like tendencies in secret keeping. Her note, smelling faintly of radish preserves, had read:
His gaze meets Potters’, who looks not furious, but weary, holding his tea in both of his hands. Draco attempts a small smile, but Potter makes no move to return it.
, he was sure, meant friend. At least these ones weren’t blackmail flowers, then. He couldn’t care less about those for Edgecombe. If he dared, he’d put poison ivy in it, and curse it to spit on his face. Unfortunately, he was certain it would cause Neville to lose his business, and he didn’t want that.                                                    After putting aside the last order, Harry leans over the counter in Spectral Sprouts, feeling tired. His eyes follow the pair of witches, barely out of Hogwarts, who are debating between a Witch Basil plant for their flat-share, or a Regrowing-Tomato plant. He might try to convince them to get plugs for both at the price of one full-grown plant. A little more work, but a budget friendly option. He rubs his face, his beard was getting longer.
“Oh well. Yes. Alright, then.” And he practically pushes her out of the door, Draco at her heels, arrangement for the Patils in hand. With a flick of his wand, the doorsign turns to
He shows Teddy how to use the salt and pepper shaker, and the nine-year old is going ham on it, his whole body involved. It doesn’t even occur to Draco to halt him, so endearing is his enthusiasm. Eventually, when he can’t delay it any longer, he turns around to start setting the table.
“Bullocks!” he jumps up, throws his robe off over the chair, and quickly locks up the office, turning off the lights as he goes. It’s late, and everyone’s left their desks. With a sweeping motion of his wand, all the papers on all the desks line up in neat stacks, chairs are pushed in, and devices –Magical and Muggle, are switched off. A blessed silence descends on the department, and taking on last look, he runs to the elevator to take him down to the apparition points. Flowers first then –an apology for more than one offense.
“I think your pajamas are rather fetching, Edward” he commented offhandedly, hoping he wasn’t impertinent.
Hello all! Hope you're all well? Crazy times we're living in. If you're bored of quarantine (good for you, you healthy human!) here's something to tie you over.
-” he heaves, loosening his grip a little “that I enjoyed any second of it, once I saw what it meant. That I wanted any of it.” He steps back, and Lawrence stumbles, looking wide-eyed and a little scared of him.
, it said, followed by a floo address, and interestingly, a Muggle phone number. “You have a phone?” he asked, a little surprised. The healer was definitely looking a bit embarrassed now.
“Well, I was going to recommend not morphing for a week at least. He’ll need to take stabilizing potions for five days, and those also inhibit instinctual magic like metamorphing a little bit.”
“No use dithering around, I suppose. It is good I am seeing you now, dear”. Draco frowned. What an odd way to start an aquintance.
It had been so odd, Malfoy showing up and inviting himself in, that Harry hadn’t known how to react.
Teddy had already finished his and was going over to Malfoy to check on his curry making process, fascinated by the stretching dough for naan. He watched them for a moment, interacting naturally. Malfoy talked to Teddy like he was an adult, although without all the sneer and double entendre. Malfoy was lowering the hob to a quiet simmer, and it seemed that at least all the preparatory work was done. A flick of his wand had a timer floating over the simmering pot, set for the hours until dinner. Apparently curry making was a long process. Teddy was excited about it, something he’d only had for take-out, and loved, if it wasn’t spicy. Malfoy was assuring Teddy it wasn’t spicy, since he wasn’t used to it either. It was strangely adorable, and it made him reluctant to ask Malfoy to leave. After all, if Teddy was okay with it, perhaps it wasn’t all that bad.
Lawrence cannot accept that he's been so tricked by Draco, and goes to find answers to what he considers to be the only reliable source. Of course it has to be Harry, right?
“I assure you, I am not. However, in my department there is no need for mail that includes curses, hexes, or howlers!”. He grits out. The Mailwizard calmly studies an owl that comes in. Draco tries not to combust from impatience.
“If you'd allow me, I could take care of that frankly enormous pile of laundry in Teddy’s room. Bring in some groceries. Even some quick cleaning spells, if you’d let me.” She’d raised an eyebrow at him, but not in critique. He sighed.
“Come see Teddy, Molly made three cakes! THREE!” she couldn’t seem to contain her baffled excitement and Teddy was pulled from Harry’s grasp, soot staining the rug in the living room. Molly bustled in, wearing an apron and her greying red hair a messy know upon her head. She smiled widely upon seeing them, and hugged Teddy on his way to the kitchen, wrangling him from Victoire and kissing him happy birthday.
“Well!? Aren’t you opening it?” Malfoy prods urgently. He’s hovering over him, and smells strongly of raw onions.
“That’s right,” says Neville neutrally. “Draco’s my friend, as well. I think he’s told me about you, actually”, he says. The young man surveys both Harry and Neville, then the empty shop, and seems to come to a decision.
Draco is pestered to check on Harry and Teddy. He catches a glimpse of how bad the situation really is.
people who certainly thought it was a good idea, by the missives they sent him. The first letter to arrive yesterday, after what he now called “The Mungo’s Incident” was from his mother. It had read as follows;
He steps in, closing the door behind him, and takes a seat. He has patience, knows not to break her concentration. But they need to be leaving soon, and he doesn’t want her to fall back into her work for half an hour again, so he clears his throat subtly. She jumps, as if already forgotten he was there.
“Get up” he says to himself. Brighid hoots at him. His job wasn’t about him, really. It was about doing
“Okay. Can we have curry?” he asks. Draco halts. Curry? That wasn’t on his list. Bloody hell. He hasn’t ever made it. Had eaten it, shamefaced, at Ron and Hermione’s place, when they had a ‘take-out night’, and loved it. Especially the naan. He should learn to do so immediately. Scrambling, he tries:
Potter lead them into the kitchen, and gestured to the table “Have a seat. Teddy, why don’t you get dressed and you can have a pastry.” Teddy, already poking inside the pastry bag complained loudly. “But!
” in cheery orange lettering. At Draco’s surprised look, Harry laughed. “You’re not the only one Hermione drags to that shop to eat carrot cake with, you know”. Draco laughed despite himself.
their strings, scattering all over the floor. Expensive plants, those were. Wanted as potion ingredients, show-pieces in terrariums, and as of lately, jewelry. All the rage amongst the Muggle-borns, deemed an animal friendly alternative to other pearls. Neville had started growing some just before Hannah fell pregnant, but still had a hard time keeping them healthy, let alone grow a variety of different colours.                                The red and purple bouquet was due at the Ministry, as had a lot Neville’s orders lately. He had disillusioned himself several times to bring them in, not wanting to be haunted by both the press nor other Ministry workers. Occasionally he stopped by at Hermione’s office, or went to chat with Ron.
“I’m sure you know about the role I played in the war, Lawrence. So you can imagine we weren’t best mates on the quidditch pitch, before.”
No one had greeted him with such enthusiasm in ages, especially not those who only addressed him by his last name. Curious despite his caution, he stepped inside the shop. It smelled like musty flowers and suprisingly, vinegar.
