He had received the call a few moments after he had gotten back to the office from his lunch with Aaron, an unspoken awkwardness lingering between them as they walked back. Draco was quite eager to get away from their empty conversation when the phone rang. It was Marvin, he sounded calm and collected, not even a hint of worry in his voice which made Draco feel secure. His boss had excused him from the rest of the work day, understanding the particular situation that he was in.
“One second!” Draco yelled out, washing off his body for the second time. He turned the water off, reaching for his towel and wrapping it around his waist, his hair dripping slowly down his back. Unsure if Harry had heard him, particularly towards the end when it was becoming increasingly more difficult to keep himself quiet. Turning the door knob, he was Harry waiting patiently outside the door, he looked up from his phone, his eyebrows darting up slightly. Harry’s eyes flashed quickly across Draco’s body, enough for him to notice. He stepped to the side, making way for him to walk through the door, continuing on into his room without another word.
“There you go” Harry grinned, knowing he had caught Draco off guard. They stayed quiet for a while, it wasn’t as uncomfortable anymore. Harry rose to his feet, walking over to his record player that one of his exes bought him. The guy was a pretentious prick but he liked the way the music sounded on record so he kept it. He played some soft music, careful not to pick anything too sensual, before heading back to sit next to Draco.
“Would you want to live here?” He could tell the question caught Draco a little off guard.
“I don’t know - everything? How was it like when you came out? What did you do besides auror work? Have you gone back to Hogwarts?” Draco said, impatient.
Harry knew the feeling, Molly always got so stressed during the holiday season that it was often hardly enjoyable for her. It was hard to watch her run around with her head cut off with no one but Hermione offering a helping hand, sometimes forcing Ron to join. Although he would miss the bustling ambiance of the Burrow during Christmas time, he had a feeling he needed the time off to reflect on his own, preferring a more peaceful day in solitude instead.
This fanfic is coming to a close! I only have one more chapter planned and then its over. It's been wonderful writing for you all.
The shop he ended up choosing was a quaint and rustic looking coffee shop not 5 minutes away from Aaron’s place. The exposed red brick worn and weathered, holding a sign stating “Gelber’s Coffee” in a boxy font. Draco found himself drawn to the establishment, appreciating its ability to hide in plain sight. The interior was riddled with plants of all different sizes, the jungle welcoming him into its arms. The hardware was all copper, matching nicely with the store’s colour scheme. He walked up to the barista, a taller man in his mid 20s, with dark hair and a wide build. As Draco ordered, he felt the eyes of the barista trail his body, flashing back to maintain intense eye contact whenever Draco’s eyes gazed back towards him instead of the menu on the wall. He waited patiently at the other end of the counter as the barista prepared his order, glancing over his shoulder periodically to see Draco people watching out the window. Draco grabbed the tray of two coffees that the other man slid over, attaching a piece of paper with his number to the cups, giving Draco a slight wink before turning around and returning to work. He scoffed as he walked out of the shop, throwing away the paper at the nearest garbage can. Although the man was attractive and very much his type, Draco had no interest in dating muggles, besides a good shag every once in a while, dating someone who wasn’t in the wizarding world was not something that sounded appealing to him.
“It’s not really all that deep though is it? I mean we only really shagged like a couple times really, and it didn’t really mean anything” Draco couldn’t tell whether to laugh or throw a fit. Did he really feel that way about the situation? He knew that they hadn’t talked about it but he always felt that there was a connection that they shared, he didn’t know until today that it was one sided.
At this point, Aaron took Draco’s face in his hands, he gazed into his eyes as if searching for an answer. He leaned forward and connected their lips in a kiss.
“Alright, I suppose that is our cue to leave. He can only get so drunk before he starts becoming a liquified version of himself.” She stated, peeling him off of the couch and into the guest bedroom across the hall.
Draco placed a kiss on Harry’s lips, his mouth opening to deepen the kiss before pulling away.
“Draco.. Are you sure that you’re okay?”
Draco got up and paced around the room, so many questions still left unanswered.
But this was what Harry did, he wasn’t sure when he changed from the all loving boy he used to be, it was sometime after the war. After he had seen everyone around him find love, content with their lives and welcoming life as a gift. Harry, much to his chagrin, felt years behind everyone he was close to, still stuck trying to heal from the trauma of war.
“Hello? Harry?” said Marvin’s voice through a staticy filter of the phone. He never did understand why the Ministry insisted they begin to carry around this muggle device.
“Sounds like a dick.”
He wasn’t sure what he was doing, when he saw Harry last week - for the first time since that New Years in Italy, he had chosen to hide behind a rack of clothes in an attempt to avoid conversation. Harry, of course, had spotted him which led to an even more awkward interaction. He threw the memory out of his mind and focused back onto the laminated menu.
“Why don’t you do me a favour and leave me the fuck alone?” He concluded, baring his eyes into Harry’s one last time. Harry stood there with his mouth slightly agape, unable to speak. At this, Draco turned on the heel of his shoe and continued walking to the portkey, tears now streaming down his face.
That evening the four of them gathered around the boisterous kitching table, Hermione having laid out a feast and setting the table festively. Ron provided an assortment of alcohol for them to drink for which Draco was grateful. ALthough they didn’t necessarily have much in common, at least they were both heavy drinkers.
He took a seat next to Draco on the bed, the mattress dipping underneath his weight. The blonde’s eyes were red and swollen, his face looking sullen and hurt.
I'm writing the next few right now and they are juicyyy ;)
“Sorry I’m late” he said casually. Not knowing what the environment was before he got here.
The man was nothing like the sophisticated and gathered Malfoy that he was trying to forget about, and although that should have been helping, it simply highlighted all of the flaws in Matt.
They were nearing the end of the street and they were laughing at some joke that Aaron had made, before Aaron abruptly stopped.
“Yeah, yeah, I’ll go.” Draco replied nonchalantly, not wanting to seem too eager. Harry smiled wide, bringing him into a rib crushing hug before yelling at him to go get ready.
Draco was livid,
“We’ve recently had to house a large number of people because of a recent raid that left a lot of victims in its trail. Unfortunately this means, we couldn’t house you with the Ministry. Harry being the only one that lives alone, and I’m quite certain he has a spare bedroom, is the one that we’ve asked to take you in for a month or two.” Marvin explained.
“How about we skip the small talk hm?” Draco groaned into the man's ear, hoping that he would get the hint that a healthy relationship wasn't something he was looking for tonight. He complied and pushed Draco up against the wall of the pub, he grabbed his face and brought it up to his, their lips being brought together, both now with a mutual hunger. The man began to trace Draco’s jaw, then his neck, beginning to run his hands against the curve of his torso.
“I know, I know, I’m sorry. I’ll explain everything just please let me in.” Draco pleaded, putting on his best puppy dog face and outreaching his coffee and bagel. Aaron sighed and reluctantly opened the door, rolling his eyes and turning back into his apartment as he did.
“Being Harry Potter has its perks, if you would believe it.” he replied.
“Hey Harry” Harry turned around, not sure what he wanted Draco to say.
A wave of relief washed over Draco and he slumped further into his chair. He couldn’t handle being mad at Harry right now, he needed someone. Harry came and sat next to him, placing a tender arm on his back as Draco breathed heavily.
In spite of the fact that he had never really enjoyed the holidays, he was quite bummed about the unfolding of events this year. At the Manor, it was expected that some sort of argument or disagreement would occur every holiday, usually ending with all of them in separate rooms and Draco bringing in the New Year alone.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Unfortunately, it is in this exact state that I am able to be the most honest. I can’t be nearly as brave when I’m sober, not to be this honest anyway.”
“Oh Merlin, don’t even get me started” Draco stated, placing his hands over his face to hide the blush that was rising to his cheeks.
“Dracoooooooooo! Open the dooooooor!” Harry whined as he leaned against the door frame, sliding sloppily to the side as he saw Draco peak through the door before realizing who it was.
Harry looked up a few seconds later, as if the question was something that was barely worth answering.
His mind had caused quite a distraction for him at work, he was being sloppy with his potions, unable to focus on anything besides that stupid brown curled prick. His boss luckily gave him some leeway, Draco blaming it on the capture of his parents and other seemingly trivial things. Not that he didn’t care about his parents, but it was simply draining to vent over them any further, especially after last week and especially when he knew nothing that he did would make a difference.
“The dishcloth wasn’t the only thing Draco asked you to give me, was it?” The owl hooted, as if amused. “Knowing Draco, Gods, he’d ask you to give me his love. Is that it?”
“What am I going to do with you? What
He hit two more balls to Maisie, watching proudly as the girls made every effort to transfer the ball quicker and more efficiently. They switched afterward, and in the time it took them to change places, Harry found his attention back on Malfoy. He was currently out at shortstop, demonstrating how to take a pick-off throw. Taryn, the pitcher, and Kelly, the catcher, had joined in for this part of the practice as well, having finished warming up.
“Look, Malfoy. It’s a little snake! Merlin, can you imagine how long it must have taken to make one of these stuffed animals?”
“Wait, Malfoy,” said Harry. “What happened?  Who did this—”
The tension in the room was palpable. Eyes narrowed, Draco’s pursed lips suggested he’d quite like to say a few choice words about the direction of the interview. Harry knew Luna’s follow-up questions hadn’t been listed on Draco’s sheet.
“Now, if you’ll add a pinch of the dust,” Granger said, watching Draco powder the mothwings. He extracted a pinch off of the counter and tossed it into the bluish-silvery mixture, watching carefully as Granger carefully stirred seven times. The liquid shimmered, and, in light of the accomplishment, Granger’s eyes positively glowed in response.
“Fuck off,” Draco huffed, blushing against his will.
“Can I come through?” He couldn’t identify her tone of voice, but knew she wouldn’t ask to come over at 1:13 am unless there was a very good reason.
“Does Master Draco want Ceeley to fire call Mistress Malfoy with gratitude?” asked the elf, inadvertently reminding Draco to remember his manners.
There was an audible sigh from Potter, and Draco couldn’t help but be just a little disappointed. “Don’t you want to see the new rennovations?”
“Of course. Time to finish renovating this miserable castle. The one we call home.” He turned back to glare again at the list, which they’d stuck back to the wall with another Sticking Charm, though it was admittedly a bit more wrinkled than before. Despite his gratefulness in being allowed to return to Hogwarts and finish his education, Draco was irked that the eighth years were being treated like children.
“Draco,” he says, overcome with emotion and desire, “You’re beautiful.” Draco’s fully filled by Harry’s cock now, but he’s still unable to move.
At least he would get a stimulating conversation out of visiting the professors, or so Draco thought. He penciled all the office hours into his calendar, and visited five different professors in four different days. On Monday, he found out that his Brit-Lit English professor was interested in Brit-Lit only, which did not parallel Draco’s research interests in the slightest. It was the same deal with his Digital Literature professor on Tuesday, but with one key difference: she scared the hell out of Draco. Apparently, students had never just done simple conversations before. On Wednesday, he was afraid to go and meet his Psychology professor, but in the end he had a very nice conversation with her about Freud and Psychoanalysis. Re-energized, Draco went into Thursday hoping to really hit it off with his Children’s Literature professor simply because he was so, so brilliant in class. However, Draco found him to be removed and distant, having been pushed out the door after only 15 minutes of conversation.
“Now, you boys have been doing an excellent job at trying to track down this group, I’ve gotten word of another planned attack tomorrow in Northern London, I was hoping you two would go and investigate. Unless, of course, you wanna keep bickering about your living quarters Potter.” Harry bitterly shook his head no, and Marvin sent them off.
“For your job?! YOUR JOB? The job that you can’t stand! That’s more important to you?” Draco yelled out, his voice breaking occasionally.
The words took Draco by surprise, he didn’t respond, but he opened the door for Harry to enter, grabbing his arm to lead him to the couch, since he could barely walk without stumbling.
“I’d appreciate it if you kept the fact that the Malfoy family is a target to yourself. I don’t need a crazy Draco stomping into my office first thing Monday morning.” Marvin responded, not even bothering to look up from his work.
“Is this… a good idea?” He asked, grabbing Harry’s face and pulling him deeper into the kiss. Despite how much he was loving this feeling, he couldn’t help but wonder what this would mean for them. Harry pressed his mouth against Draco’s ear,
This still left Draco confused as to what they said about him being a target, and why he couldn’t simply go and live with Aaron for a while. He didn’t want to ask or reveal that he was eavesdropping outside of the door in the first place.
“Thanks.” He mumbled, getting only a grunt from Harry in return.
Harry was humming in the kitchen as he sliced up ingredients for their cheese board that Hermione insisted they try out, having brought reference photos for exactly how she wanted it laid out. Draco was standing towards the back corner of the dining room, sipping on wine and enjoying the chaotic set of events unraveling before him. It’s not that he was exactly uncomfortable with the three of them all together, it was just that he simply felt he didn’t fit in. They had nearly 2 decades of inside jokes and shared experiences, laughing about references that Draco could never understand.
Aaron sympathized with him, always saying the right things and putting his hand on him for comfort. He wasn’t sure why but he hadn’t felt any sort of emotion about his apartment being raided, he knew that he should be afraid, or angry, but to be honest, he just felt exhausted.
He was bent over his railing, breathing in the cold air and smoke, his body numbed from the weather. His fingers were so cold that they had begun to tremor as he tried to bring the cigarette up to his mouth. This was his cue to head inside, throwing the butt over his balcony before he walked back in.
He was disappointed to find out that this year was more of the same. As he walked back, he could hear the distant hurra of a group of people shouting their excitement for the New Year, he had guessed that the clock had struck twelve.
They finished eating and paid, leaving the bistro and returning back to work.
“Sorry”
AHhh! How do you guys feel about Harry lying? What do you think  gonna happen next?
“Oh please, the amount of times I’ve drunk dumped my feelings on you is countless. Consider us even.” Draco had half a heart to reach over and rest his hand on top of Harry’s, but he thought against it. He figured that if anyone should make the first move right now - besides his needless flirting earlier - it should be Harry. He didn’t want to press where he wasn’t wanted.
Draco had half a mind to binge drink himself back into a mindless oblivion, something that had become so routine in his state of living that he often looked past its destructive qualities. It wasn’t the hangovers that got to him, those could be whisked away with a simple potion, but the feelings of emptiness that left him more alone than he was before.
Autumn in London always sparked melancholy feelings in Draco. It was far easier to stay positive and content in the baking heat of summer, even the worst of days able to be fixed with a walk outside where warmth wrapped his body like a blanket. The colder seasons didn’t bring that sort of comfort.
“You were scared. What a lovely excuse.” Draco couldn’t believe he was giving this conversation the time of day. He thought that he valued himself more than to be with people who cheated on him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh Draco, you would not believe who is here, Harry Potter! Apparently Aurora knows him from their auror training, small world huh? Didn’t you go to school with him?” Oliver exclaimed as he pointed over to where Harry was standing by the bar. This night just kept getting worse and worse. Of course Potter had to be here, it's not like Draco was already preoccupied with having to keep other awkward encounters to a minimum, but now he also has to deal with the self righteous saviour of the wizarding world too. The waiter walked past with Draco’s drink and he downed the glass in one swig, placing it back on the tray and signalling for a second. Oliver and Marie eyed him suspiciously,
“Why am I not surprised that this is what you would act like on Christmas?” Harry asked, his mouth pulling upwards into a grin, his body finally complying with getting out of bed.
“You’re an idiot, Harry. Of course I’ll be your boyfriend.”
What Draco finds himself actually concerned with is the instability of not having a label. The two of them have been through rollercoasters of ups and downs, from childhood enemies to friends and now to this, yet none of it feels safe without knowing that Harry is in this just as much as he is.
But what if it was all a one time occurrence? He would wake up and realize the dreaded mistakes of the night before and try and sneak away quietly, the two of them back to awkward silence and lack of eye contact.
He pushed Harry off of him quickly.
Draco sighed in relief, to be quite honest, if it wasn’t for Aaron, he would’ve left hours ago, but hanging out with him was effortless and fun, something he looked forward to whenever they made plans. He changed back into his own clothes and walked to the register to pay, glad that the shopping trip was finally over.
“How were your silly little auror tasks today?” Harry could tell that he was far past tipsy, noticing him swaying lightly in his chair. Harry debated going back into his room, it felt unfitting after he had so adamantly defended him at work.
Harry had left to go to work again the day before, despite it being a weekend. After their moment in the kitchen, they ate dinner in almost complete silence, and haven’t spoken much since. Draco had ran over the events of the past weekend relentlessly, trying to comb through the meticulous details of what he now learned to be his eventual demise. Maybe that was being slightly pessimistic and it was, but overshadowed by his lack of support system now that he had taken it further than he initially wanted to with Harry, he can’t help but be filled with regret.
“Merlin, Potter, you’re gonna give me a bloody heart attack!” Draco exclaimed, clutching his heart in his hand.
Harry placed his hand over Draco’s, staying silent for a moment.
“Wait.” He said, withdrawing from the kiss.
“It’s rude to eavesdrop Harry Potter.” She smiled, before apparating.
“I don’t think pancakes are supposed to be burned Potter.” Draco teased, his mouth up turning into a smile. Harry turned around startled, pulling his wand out in defence. His shoulders relaxed as he realized who it was, his face falling back to one of indifference and his body turning back to the stove.
In his peripheral, he caught a glimpse of a figure standing a few feet away. He broke his eye contact with Harry to see Aaron. Fuck. He thought. Out of all the possible times I could have seen him.
Within 10 minutes the taxi was outside of the building and they were saying goodbye to Ron and Hermione. The four of them laughing at nothing, all drunk and ready to wind down for the night.
“That’s amazing! I know you always hated that place. Where are you working now?” he was genuine in his excitement for Harry.
“You. Me. Quidditch World Cup.” Draco stated, his stomach doing backflips in excitement.
“Right. Well, I should get going, Marie and Oliver are coming over for lunch today.” Draco finally stated.
He wasn’t sure how to respond to him, he thought back to this morning after Harry had left.
Harry gave a half hearted laugh and stared blankly at the wall in front of him, only coming to when he felt a soft tap on his shoulder.
Maybe Aaron would be the wiser choice out of the two men, he was generally more emotionally available, providing comfort and asylum for Draco in his lowest moments, although if he were to go by that measure, Harry did too. Not to mention, Aaron and him have had similar pasts and were able to find an interconnectedness between them that Draco hadn’t experienced before, one of true companionship. Though Draco wasn’t sure if it was a romantic type of companionship in his eyes before this.
“You alright mate?” Oliver questioned, Draco nodded slowly, making up an excuse as to how work was busting his ass, it wasn’t a complete lie, work had been getting a little more difficult lately, having him work later hours. But that wasn’t the origin of his issues, if anything, it helped distract him from them. Oliver didn’t seem to be fully convinced, but he knew better than to integrate Draco when he was in a bad mood.
“Oh. No, that’s alright. I don’t really drink anymore.” Draco said, tucking a stray blonde hair behind his ear. He was a grown man, now into his 30s, and Harry still had some sort of giddying effect on him.
“Well, let's fix that then” Harry reached over towards Draco’s phone, Draco stared at him like he was crazy. Harry just chuckled and got him to unlock the phone, opening up the contacts app and putting his number in.
“Their time will come. Don’t think that Lucius will ever be forgotten by the Renovation, for someone who was in our Lord’s inner circle, he will be penalized greatly.” Romilda spit, her mouth turning up in a wicked smile, seething with revenge.
Casper got up from his chair with a wink towards Harry, clearly amused. He was not nearly the wingman that he thought he was.
“Perhaps that’s just what you feel, but it doesn’t take a genius to notice how he looks at you.” Marie filled Draco’s glass and walked back to the table.
Draco rolled over on the bed, eyes still shut yet burning. He felt incredibly drained from the day before, his emotional state had taken a toll on him and the copious amounts of drinking didn’t help either. He cringed as he thought about his behaviour from the night before, being all giddy and flirtatious with Harry was definitely out of line. He was glad that nothing happened, but still annoyed at the leftover sexual tension that he was feeling, a tent formed with his sheets, proving just how much he needed that hookup with Harry last night. He hadn’t gotten laid in a while - well, realistically it had only been a few weeks - but for Draco that felt like eons.
“I think you’re saying things you might regret tomorrow.” was all that Draco could muster, it felt wrong listening to Harry’s confessions when he was this inebriated.
Once Casper had calmed down, they made their way back to the Ministry, they barely spoke, the air around them dense with emotion. They arrived at Marvin’s office, eager for the day to be over. Both of them felt so beaten up, despite not inciting any form of battle at all. Marvin could tell as soon as he laid eyes on the pair that the news was going to be nothing short of horrid. Harry explained how the event laid out in a quiet voice, he was rarely soft spoken and he could tell that it freaked Marvin out a bit.
Harry walked out of the office, greeting Ron and Hermione with a tight hug, eager to catch up on their lives. They went to this quaint muggle restaurant with dim lighting and warm ambiance. Ron and Hermione talked about their married life and work at the Ministry. Hermione was campaigning to become the next Minister of Magic, which has taken up almost all of the free time she had, which wasn’t much to begin with. Ron had become an auror like Harry, although he was working in a separate department. Harry told the two about his rooming up with Draco, and how it was practically forced on him by Marvin.
“Alright, despite how much I am loving this, we will be decapitated by Hermione if she doesn’t show up to a fully decorated house for tonight. And although I am a grown man I am still very scared of her when faced with her wrath.” Harry said, giggling a little at the image of Hermione’s rage, her hair wild and standing on end, her face red with anger.
“I think he fancies you” She said, swirling the wine around in her glass before taking a sip. Draco’s eyebrows shot up in surprise, his own cheeks now growing pink.
“You look awfully glum, don’t tell me you’ve run out of hangover potion again, you need to take those far too often for your wellbeing” said a voice at the door with a smirk. It was Aaron Turner, his only real friend at work and one he valued immensely”
Let me know what you guys think is going to happen! Chapter 17 should be out early next week :))
Harry was still grateful for their friendship, and how positively they reacted when he came out, Hermione in particular; whereas Ron took a little longer to warm up, but that was only because Harry had to break up with Ginny in the process, leaving her heartbroken. Harry still remained part of the family despite this, still spending every holiday with the Weasley’s, him and Ginny now good friends.
“Do you like it here?”
Harry had looked good, it was strange to see him outside of his everyday auror clothes but Draco wasn’t complaining. His pants hugging him in all the right places.
“I miss you, Draco.” Harry said, his eyes looking down into his glass.
The emptiness of Aaron’s office on Monday dawned over Draco heavily, he couldn’t help but feel guilt for his own part in his absence. He didn’t know whether to give him space or to go to his apartment and apologize. He saw the irony in his lack of feelings for Aaron while he resented Harry deeply for doing the same to him. At this thought, he decided against going to Aaron’s and instead chose to give him the space he assumed that he needed.
The air was warm and welcoming in London. The sky was blue, the sun radiating light and flashing off of reflective buildings. Draco had left the apartment without another word to Harry, unwilling to prolong the few interactions that they did have, in fear of repeating any of the thoughts he had today in the shower. Whenever the sun was beaming and the city was illuminated, Draco’s mood felt exponentially better, that paired with the shower he had taken that washed off the grime and memories of last night, had Draco strolling through the streets with a grin. He was on his way to Aaron’s apartment, planning on stopping by a coffee shop beforehand.
“Did you know? About my parents?” Draco finally said, wary of the response as he took another burning sip out of the bottle. Harry stayed quiet for a while, as if contemplating saying anything at all.
“Take a break for a second, I can promise you I’ll provide you with something far more entertaining.” he teased, slowly taking the book from Draco’s grasp and placing it on the coffee table adjacent to them. Draco whined in rebuttal but made no efforts to stop Harry.
These worries faded away as he entered his apartment, pushing the heavy wooden door open. Marie and Oliver were already seated at the dining table, Aaron laughing among them.
“Scared of what?” He managed to spit out,
They were seated in a quaint part of the bistro, a nook near large sun facing windows at the front of the cafe, further away from the noise and bustle of people enjoying their lunch. They had eventually come to the topic of him and Harry, as he had predicted, and after giving her the rundown of their sloppy drunken hookup, he was now waiting impatiently for any sort of advice that she could provide.
Malfoy nods, revealing crackling steel gray eyes. “I had some words with those little brats running around rampant,” he discloses with no trace of regret. “I had the feeling that you were going to bite off more than you could chew today.”
“Why, dear,” said Mr. Granger, looking perplexed as he patted his daughter on the back. “We’re not the one who was off having her adventures. We’ve been perfectly safe at home this whole time.”
“Wait,” Harry panted. “Draco, wait.”
His wife took a step back while the two children grasped hands and winced. It was unclear whether they were frightened by Draco or expecting some sort of explosion from the man.
“Not all conditions can be diagnosed and handled in an interchangeable fashion,” snarls Malfoy, fighting once again to keep his temper under control.
There was a rustle of movement, and suddenly Potter was next to him on the ground, legs crisscrossed as he comfortably invaded Draco’s space.
“Do we understand, Potter?” Schrader said sardonically, leaning on the edge of Harry’s desk, glaring down at him.
Sobered, Draco sat down in the chair across from her. “Okay,” he said reasonably. “We’ll open the letters. Then, no matter what happens, we get Chinese. Because you’ve gotten me addicted to the stuff.”
The grass was green and the gardens were exquisite, beautifully arranged in a way that reminded Draco of the extensively manicured Manor grounds. He loved the house he and Harry had rented and would in turn make their own.
It’s meant to be a promise, and I accept it as such.
“I want to tell you right off that it might not bring you the closure you seek, Harry. In fact, it might make it more painful. You’ll have to see them both in court and give intimate facts to the judge and jury. They’ll ask very detailed questions and expect equally detailed answers.”
“Yet you’d never know it,” the Captain grumbled. “I tried to get you transferred back to Britain, you know, but the damned Commander interferred again…”
The butterflies seemed to have traveled from the lavender fields to the inside of Draco’s stomach, because even as he butterfly kissed Potter, the feeling only grew stronger. After a minute or so, Potter started to lean back, but without thinking Draco slipped an arm behind Potter’s back and pulled him closer, unwilling to let go.
Hermione said, yet that wasn’t his strong suit. Most days, he still wasn’t even sure he had one.
"Really? You like gardening?”
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
“You managed to save my life,” Harry pointed out. “If you’d identified me, things could have gone a hell of a lot differently.”
Malfoy managed a weak smile at his awful pun.
“What was that, Potter?” Malfoy demanded the moment they sat down with their food. “We were only supposed to be getting biscuits and tea.”
“Um, yeah,” Harry admits. His face is on fire again.
Seeing visible evidence of Harry’s nervousness helped calm Draco’s nerves. “I’m showering right now,” he said, leaning down to kiss Harry without getting dirt all over him. “I’ll only be a short while.”
Finally the moment of truth came. They stopped in front of a granite grave marker, and Draco braced himself as he leaned forward to read the name on the stone.
. He wished Draco would have
Mr. Granger returned with Mrs. Granger in tow. “We would love to sample your wares,” Mrs. Granger said. “I do enjoy a good red.”
“You’re right,” Potter breathed. He sheathed his wand again and glared at his friends. “You lot know where to find me when you can respect my choices.”
“I don’t want to go back,” Harry sighed, slipping his hand into Draco’s and staring up at the sky.
Malfoy seemed satisfied. He walked towards Harry, who stiffened, before gracefully lowering himself down and leaning against the tree next to Harry’s. “Sit, Potter.”
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Even if he disowns you? Since you were so concerned about that before.”
“Much better!” shouted Potter. “But you’ve always got to catch with two hands. Either use your free hand to hold the glove closed after you catch it, or catch the ball and then cover it.”
Shivering, Harry disrobed quickly, tossing his clothes into a pile. Draco huffed. “For Christ’s sakes, Potter, I know you weren’t raised in a barn!”
where he and Seamus agreed to meet.
Not knowing what to say, Draco tried to establish some rapport. He made his voice less crisp, losing his usual enunciation and slurring his words, “Last night was so fucked up, you wouldn’t believe how some of those college girls party.”
“Harry’s been wonderful to me over the years,” Draco said, keeping the defensive tone firmly out of his voice. “I simply must confess,” he said, with a teasing tone of confidentiality as he leaned closer to his old friends, “That I think we’re quite ready for the next step in our relationship.”
It wasn’t hard to amble over to the machines and start turning them on, one by one. Ron filled them with water before adding the necessary ingredients to the espresso machine and firing it up. Soon, the smell of brewing coffee filled the air, and Harry heard Hermione take a deep breath, savoring the aroma.
“Malfoy!” Potter’s voice interrupted him out of his reverie. “Hey, are you almost ready to—What
the Dark Lord. I conspired with the Dark Lord and his army to turn Hogwarts into a battleground, where you watched your friends and family die.”
doing it for Harry, but the thought of gaining another family helped motivate Draco to slip away from the excitement and sneak in through the back door of the Burrow.
“Along with proper mechanics, agility, and

“Seamus’s not invited to any more Friday drink nights,” says Harry frostily, avoiding his mate’s gaze.
In center field, Harry was stiff with anticipation. This did not feel like playing a game of Quidditch. There, the action started right away as he furiously scouted for the Snitch while dodging Bludgers and out of control Chasers. Here, the pitcher controlled the action by putting the ball in play. José wound up, and Harry found himself instinctively stepping back as the ball crossed home plate. He had to take a deep breath to calm down, telling himself that he wasn’t guaranteed any action, and that it was important to stay focused as to not miss things.
The sound of a throat being cleared jolted Draco from his tiredness, anxiety flooding his stomach as he scrambled to cover his exposed parts.
Malfoy looks thoughtful. “I can probably figure it out, Potter.”
like he actually wanted to be on this miserable outing, nor was he intentionally annoying her. It just so happened that the chicken marsala he’d ordered thirty minutes previously, the only saving grace about this evening, was currently commanding all of his attention.
Harry turned to Cale. Though he was anxious to hear the final verdict, he had learned the hard way it wasn’t smart to stick around when Nate was annoyed with something. “Say, want to start warming up now, mate?”
“And me,” said Nels. “This is exactly what I needed for this summer.”
Draco strode out of the bathroom and headed back into his bedroom only to find Potter staring at him like he just Transfigured into a moose. “Avert your eyes, Potter. I know I’m attractive and all, but you simply must control yourself.” To his complete and utter surprise, Potter flushed just the slightest bit. Well, that was interesting. Maybe Potter actually
“Yeah, mate,” said the Weasel, “George is going to give all his free samples away before we get there.”
"We love you too," George smiled.
Harry’s attention is reclaimed; however, as a blonde dancer pulls out an empty chair, stands on it, and pulls open his trench coat before gyrating his pelvis against Seamus’s face. For his part, Seamus is grinning as he laps at the man’s thonged crotch with his tongue. Though Harry has seen Seamus involved in sexual acts countless times, and had even been drawing into participating in one unknowingly just an hour or so before, he can’t help but continue to be turned on. His mate is fucking hot, even though he’s a pill.
OCTOBER 1998
“Cheers,” Hermione said again, proffering her raised bottle. This time Draco clinked it, and they drank deeply.
Harry spun back around and saw beautiful luminescent green moss quickly spreading outward from the middle of the far wall over the sides and ceilings until it reached the very ground Harry and Malfoy were standing on. Amazed, Harry lifted his foot and saw the plushy moss beneath, as if it had simply appeared from nothing.
Nodding sympathetically, Harry took a moment to reflect on the oddness of this situation. Sitting by Dumbledore’s tomb in the aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts, having a heart to heart with Draco Malfoy? He would have never imagined it happening.
“Teaching you how to play baseball.”
“No way, Potter.”
Several thoughts went through her head,
“You use the circle grip for this one,” José instructed, demonstrating how to hold the ball properly before tossing it back to Draco. “Throw it like a fastball.”
He is barely able to process this information before Malfoy turns squarely around and strides back down the middle of the stage to the exit. Harry has a feeling this was part of his act, but wouldn’t be surprised if Malfoy is relieved to get away from him. Though he didn’t reveal his animosity towards Harry while in the final stretch of his act, it had to be hard to perform with his boyhood rival in the audience.
Nonverbally, Potter conjured lube, which was quite impressive; Draco could only do the most basic of nonverbal spells. Immediately, Potter turned his attentions to Draco’s bottom, making sure to lather on some of the substance as to smooth the way. Only once Draco was taken care of did Harry slick himself.
He nodded to the Weasley before exiting the shop, wondering why nothing in his life could possibly be easy.
,” commands the man.
“So,” he remarked casually. Cale snorted from the front seat, though thankfully Malfoy wasn’t paying attention to him. “What song are you going to sing?”
Harry laughs. “And you got your first real challenge today, as well.”
. “Ooh, he’s already blushing!” another girl gushed, “Can we make him do 4 shots?”
“Push back into me, that’s it, Harry,” Seamus coaxes into his ear.
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
He even sounds sincere, thought Harry. Still a little peeved, he asked, “Has your father offered any suggestions?” A second later, he regretted it. Even for Malfoy's sake, that seemed a little cruel.
“I just want you to know that I’ll be fair to you,” Potter said, still completely genuine. “I mean it, Malfoy – all that stuff from before the War, it doesn’t matter now.”
“I am,” said Malfoy stiffly. He offered no additional information.
“Strike!” shouted a man on the far right side of the field, near a white square that was raised off the ground.
At times like these, Zee vividly reminded Harry of Zacharias Smith. He repressed the urge to thump Zee in much the same way as he and Ron had often repressed the urge to thump Smith.
Rolling his eyes, Potter dove back into his cubby and extracted some hiking clothes. They weren’t much different than what Draco usually wore. “Now will you go?” he asked.
“As you very well ought to,” Cale sniffed, discreetly looking over his shoulder for Nate. “Now, how about we drink Chris under the table again tonight? Plenty of time to recover from hangovers before practice tomorrow?"
“Now, I don’t want to inflate your ego or anything, Potter,” he beamed, “But that was fantastic.”
“–-so that just leaves us with three more to go. But do we even need to read them? I think we’ve found out enough about the style of the journal and the formatting.”
Draco’s laugh rang throughout the room. “Potter, I don’t think you’ll ever cease to amuse me.”
“Let’s go,” Draco said, tugging Harry towards the door that led down to the Auror department. There was a security guard there, but it didn’t take more than a few well-placed fireworks to encourage him to leave his station for a brief moment.
“Malfoy,” he said seriously. “I owe you – and your mother – a life-debt from the War, so if there’s anything I can do to help out, just let me know.”
“Helping rebuild the school,” Draco stated, trying to replicate his usual confidence by adopting proper Malfoy posture. “What does it look like I’m doing? Wait, don’t answer that. Hufflepuffs aren’t the sharpest tools in the broom shed.”
Sighing, Draco placed a dishcloth underneath the peas to make them more comfortable against his shin. “You just never give up, do you? Alright, fine.” He could have drawn it out, but there didn’t seem to be much point, considering that he’d already been over all the possible outcomes in his own mind. “I want to see Harry.”
Potter laughed. “I’m sure you have. I know you probably think that this is pretty silly too, but I never got to try it as a kid, and I honestly couldn’t think of a more fitting place…”
“And if those are anything like the ones on the cover,” Draco said, carding a hand through his hair. Shaking his head, he picked up the magazine and flipped to the middle, where there was an enormous glossy two page spread of their crossroads shot where they were walking determinably towards one another, drawn together in spite of their surroundings.
“You’re on,” said Harry. Goody – now he could stick his mates with this awful task. Technology was never his strong suit anyhow. “What’s your address?”
“Granger’s a genius,” Draco said, delicately trying to shift the center of attention away from himself.
Ron held up his beer for a toast, and Harry obliged him. “Cheers, mate. It’ll be nice to have a proper ale again when we get back; to see everyone, visit all the old haunts.”
“–-and Hartely’s ‘Purposeful Stirring,” Draco added. “Because we removed every eighth counter-clockwise stir.”
Neither can fall back to sleep, so they rise from the bed and step out onto Harry’s balcony, hand in hand watching the red sun rise.
“You seriously used the phrase ‘emotional baggage’?” She rolled her eyes.
“Let’s give it another ten minutes,” Harry suggests. I rest my head on his shoulder, because my back’s hurting again and somehow it feels natural.
“I don’t want to stop,” said Draco determinedly, though Harry could feel his legs shaking.
Draco sighed in pleasure, but not to Harry’s satisfaction. It was time. Gently pulling Draco’s bum even higher, he leaned down and softly flicked his tongue over Draco’s rim.
“If I cover my ears, will you stop?”
As they skimmed, something clicked in Draco’s mind. “Granger?” he asked tentatively. “Are you quite alright with publishing a discovery relating to the Dark Arts?”
“I dunno, it feels like he – Asten – took something from me.”
“Let’s not make this a production, shall we?” she snapped.
“Er –” said Harry.
“Merlin,” he snarled, kicking off his trainers and chucking his cloak onto the ugly coat stand—when he came to help them move for a second time, Neville swore it looked like a troll—before plopping down on the sofa next to Draco, trembling with energy. “My presence for Weasley family brunch has been
. Furiously, he turned to the column near the back of the paper that was added a week after the wizarding war concluded, titled “New and Updated Future Promise Legislation.” And sure enough, there it was: Future Promise #99, decreeing that “…with the current shortages on natural resources, all former Voldemort supporters and/or sympathizers are hereby required to pay no less than 115% of the usual rate.” Draco paid the Manor’s bills through a direct deposit system, where the amount owed each month was simply transferred straight to the Natural Resources department of the Ministry.
“Damn Zee and Mike,” growled Nate, still pacing around with his clipboard. “I should have never trusted them to be on time. On Wednesday we’re meeting a full hour and a half before the game."
After carefully folding the dishcloth up and tucking it neatly in his pocket, Harry gave the owl one last pat and went to bed, where he fell asleep with a hopeful longing in his chest that Draco wanted
"Is that a promise?" Draco challenged, losing against his attempt to avoid flirting with Potter.
“More or less, yes,” he affirms, looking queasy. “He was encouraging me to get laid, but I never expected him to force me into that sort of situation. But this
To his surprise, Malfoy flushed. “I can’t answer that. Why does anyone want to have sex?”
“It sure would have made things a lot easier,” said Harry. “But look on the bright side—at least we’ll be a lot closer together than if I was in Gryffindor Tower and you were all the way down in the dungeons.”
“Grab your mitt, Malfoy,” Potter snapped, coming down a notch. “Your first lesson is how to throw the bloody ball.” He led the way out onto the field with Draco following behind and anxiously trying to stuff the miserable thing onto his hand. Potter looked back after a minute and for some reason, took pity. “Here, like this,” he said, showing Draco how to stick his index finger through a special hole in the glove. “This should always be outside the mitt so you have more control when you’re catching.”
“Shut it, you,” said Cale, running half backwards and chucking the ball at Harry. “Wait, aren’t we even going to stretch first?”
“Actually,” says Draco, swiping at his neck with a hand towel, “I’m not very fond of treacle tart.” With that, he makes a beeline for the bathroom, Harry staring dumbfounded at his retreating figure.
Once inside, he made sure to replace his empty bottle of premium shampoo before turning on the water. Except that the water wouldn’t turn on, even as Draco pulled out his wand and attempted to turn the faucet on by magic. His growl of frustration became gradually louder as he tried spell after spell, fantasies of a hot shower evaporating.
“Perhaps it’s perfect for your brazen stubbornness,” said Draco. “But not all of us prefer to emulate creatures that act now and think later.”
Draco fixed him with a deathly look. “Now, now,” Jake smiled, “You weren’t wearing that cold face last night when I-”
“You did say not to only tell you what you wanted to hear anymore,” Hermione said. “And I said yes.”
They sat there in the corridor until Parkinson and Zabini finally left and Harry could return to Draco’s side.
Eventually he encases Draco’s cock in his mouth, forming his lips into a tight ‘O” and bobbing up and down right on Draco’s most pleasurable spot. He uses his hand to grasp the root of Draco’s shaft and pump him at the same time. Draco’s begging for more now, and Harry decides to try something new. At the same time he sucks Draco’s cock further into his mouth, finally deep throating him, he Summons the lube from across the room and coats his finger before gently inserting it into Draco’s hole. The reaction is priceless. Draco keens his hips up for more, crying out softly as Harry finds his prostate and stimulates it. When he feels Draco’s balls tighten, he gives Draco’s cock one last kiss and gently removes his finger.
He had no choice to finish what he and Dream Potter had started and not properly concluded, wanking furiously to thoughts of Potter penetrating him and crying “Draco, Draco!” The pounding of the shower and the hot water could almost substitute for the incredible warmth of Potter’s arms, but of course it fell short.
car, and they weren’t done driving it. The mess was lamentable. He quickly put Rowle out of his misery, placing the gun against his chest and pulling the trigger. Blood streamed out of the bullet hole, running down the man’s suit and coalescing all around him in the car seat. Harry watched the patterns it made, transfixed.
Draco broke out of the embrace and smacked him in the arm. “I’ll have you know, Potter, that I simply was taking you on a tour of France, fulfilling my promise of helping you become less of an uncultured swine. This was a destination that I thought you would particularly enjoy based on your love of castles and architecture.”
Nate did a double take. “Shit, that’s right, Harry. We have an odd number on the team –” he looked downcast for a second, and then straightened back up again with a gleeful look on his face. “I’ve got it! You can work with Draco.” Before either of them could move or even breathe, Nate caught Draco’s eye. “You wouldn’t mind a bit of recreational coaching, would you? I’m sure Danny would fairly compensate you for it.”
“You’re right,” she said eventually, determinedly, wiping her snotty nose on Draco’s shoulder, “And I would rather be alone than have to put up with that whining
Draco nods. “That’s understandable,” he says. “You don’t really want to have it out with either one of them, do you? Or would you rather we cursed them with something permanent?”
“You’re a mess, you know that?” He said, smiling as he continued smoking.
Thank you so much for reading and supporting me through this fic!
“Please, Draco” Harry pleaded, taking his hands and putting them on either side of Draco’s face.
While he was deep in self loathing thought, his back was warmed by the presence of a nearby body, the hairs on his arm and neck coming to a stand as he felt the warm breath coming out of Harry’s mouth. He swallowed hard as he continued to cook, not wanting to be the first to give into any advances.
“Let’s go inside.” Harry said, receiving a dramatic groan from Draco at which Harry only laughed at.
“Marvin, can I call you back please?” Harry said, dropping the call before he got an answer and running after Draco down the stairs.
“You think you cheated on me?” He spat.
This newfound clingy affection that Harry pushed onto Draco the night before had caught him completely off guard. Creating new expectations for what he initially visualized their relationship to be.
“No offence sir, but I think Malfoy has a right to know if his family is in danger, I’m sorry but I can’t agree to keeping that from him, no matter the inconvenience it may cause the Ministry.” Harry seethed. He didn’t adore Malfoy but that didn’t mean he lacked all empathy. Marvin eyed Harry warningly.
“Your eyes,” said Draco reverently, tracing his finger over still-Harry.
“How’re you liking the desk job?” asked Dawlish, crossing his legs and turning a pencil upside down in his hands.
“What the fuck, Harry?” snapped Ron. “Since when do you conspire with the enemy? Or did you forget he's a Death Eater?”
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
Second attempt more fruitful, Harry paid closer attention as Cecelia went on to demonstrate the starting chain, grasping the yarn with the hook and pulling it through the loop already on the shaft. Malfoy remembered the motion and whipped up a quick set of fifteen chain stitches while Harry tried to keep his hands from shaking, unable to find a comfortable way to hold both hook and yarn.
“Come on mate,” urged Cale. They had a spare room in their apartment, and Harry had moved in after the very first team practice.
Their driver was female, so his fellow outfielders held their tongues. But Cale turned around and mouthed “have a nice wank?” at him from the front seat, and Harry felt rather than saw his face flushing.
“Your job feels righter than me?”
“WILKINS!” boomed an angry voice. Draco couldn’t make out who it was, but he instantly eliminated Potter. “I’ll have you chucked out of here for good this time. Wait until McGonagall hears that you’ve been torturing students who have been cleared of all charges!”
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
Draco was afraid to acknowledge him, so he simply pasted a sneer on his face and ignored the Weasel. He noticed Harry and Neville share a quick look of concern.
His eyes met those of his grinning partner’s, and Draco looked away. He’d spent an hour earlier that same day debating the varied uses of a spatula with the man he now had to
Eventually he reached the outer edge of the garden, where he couldn’t help but to sink down next to the saddest, loneliest plant. The soil was cold against his trousers, but numbness was part of him now and he couldn’t really feel anything, not even the hot tea Mother insisted he drink earlier. Draco wanted to have faith, wanted to be able to trust in the strength of Harry’s love for him and his for Harry, but the fear was ultimately too strong.
“Obviously,” said Hermione. “I read every word.”
Charlie waved him off. “You can’t claim something that was already taken before you were born.”
Dinner passed without anything of interest happening, at least, not until one of the campers – an older one, at that – stared directly at Draco and asked, “What does your tattoo mean?”
José shook his head. “I can’t even understand him, man. We’ve gone out for drinks and he’s the chillest dude ever, and then he pulls this.”
“Good effort,” Harry said bracingly, shouldering the bat for a moment. “I hope you lot paid attention to that lesson!” he called, raising his voice a bit as the three girls giggled together. “If you have to catch the ball, call it. If you’re not in the best position, let someone else take it; shout their name.”
Draco sulked. “Yeah, like you’ve never sang a camp song since you’ve been here, Potter. I know for a fact that your favorite’s ‘Black Socks’. Probably has something to do with your severe lack of personal hygiene.”
For some reason, Draco found that oddly hilarious--he blamed it on the glass or so of wine he’d had--and couldn’t stop his uncontrollable laughter from spewing out. He sprawled out on the couch clutching his stomach. In his past life, he might’ve been surprised when Hermione suddenly joined in, but he wasn’t anymore. They eventually ended up plopping down on the floor, rolling around laughing until Hermione’s chuckles turned to tears.
for Merlin’s sake.
Unruffled, he formed an upside-down V on his thigh and Hermione shot out the back windshield. At this point, Ron had already disarmed the second man—a hefty blonde, Harry spared a half-second to note—and knocked him out with his own weapon.
Draco gave her a withering glare because it
Grumbling, Harry hastily drew the coins out of his pocket and passed them over the table to Malfoy. “Fair’s fair. Now let’s have at it, or I’ll start planning for Siberia.”
It was the last part, combined with the stroking and the nudging, that sent Draco over the edge. As his eyes shut and his body tensed, Harry kept up the motions and the whispering until the clenching of his hole caused Harry to buck wildly and pull Draco more tightly to him. They came down together, motions gently slowing to a stop, Harry still in Draco but resting on top of him.
With a glare at Nate and a look at Harry that had surely wilted his insides, Malfoy sashayed out onto the field and began playing catch with Nels from his respective place on the mound.
“Enjoying yourself, Malfoy?”
But then the light retreated from inside of him, instead floating back in front of him, as equally bright as before, to coalesce into a solid wooden door.
Adjusting his cleats on the rubber, Draco struggled to find a comfortable position where he felt balanced.
Why had he let himself be talked into this? Oh, right, Harry reflected sourly, because Draco actually thought it would be a
He fought back against the guilt and tried to shift the blame onto someone else. As usual, he could only hold himself accountable.
. Zee won, and ran to pick up some spare head gear before stepping up to the triangle-rectangle.
The minute his head stopped spinning from Apparation, Harry latched onto Draco and kissed him, accidentally knocking their heads together in his haste. Draco looked surprised.
“It turned into a triangle,” said Cecelia, already hobbling back towards a squashy armchair and an adjacent basket of yarn, “Because you weren’t patient enough to count stitches—it would have become a square, instead.”
“Thanks, Hermione, you have no idea what a lifesaver you are—”
“I’m sure he’s guessed by now,” Draco said. “Leave it alone, Granger. I feel faint. I think I need to go lie down.”
“We’re not reading them tonight,” Harry replied. “Or at least I’m not,” he snapped, wrenching himself away from the comfort and warmth of Draco’s body to open the window and let in a small avalanche of post. “These can wait until the morning,” he said firmly, crawling back into bed and wrapping himself back up in Draco once more.
“Work on your timing, Potter,” Draco grunted, stroking himself back to full hardness.
Harry took a step out of the box and did a practice swing to loosen up his muscles. Becky Lou was on second, and Harry could see that she knew Nate’s plan. Time to execute it. He assumed his regular batting stance again, but this time the corners crept up just a little more. The pitcher delivered a precious meatball, and Harry bunted it just in front of the plate. It should have been the catcher’s responsibility to get to, while the second baseman covered first. Harry didn’t pay attention to logistics as he pounded down the baseline. Nate had given Becky Lou the signal to steal, betting that Harry would lay the bunt down, and she was already almost at third by the time the bunt was recovered by the off-balance catcher.
I pass an old Muggle playset. It’s wooden and has silly little constructions like ladders, bridges, towers, and slides. For the hell of it, I climb the ladder and make my way up to the tallest tower, looking out over the mountain tops. It’s beautiful up here, that’s just about the only saving grace having to do with this experience.
“As if, Malfoy,” Potter spat back. “I was just wondering how you could have managed to put on your jersey backwards when you’re always bragging about how smart you are.”
“Of course I do,” said Potter sincerely, always taking the chance to play Saviour.
He waited a moment before responding. Come with Harry to the Weasley’s Sunday brunch? That sounded like a recipe for disaster. However, it made sense as a logical approach. This way, Harry would be demonstrating his willingness to be a part of the Weasley family while still reinforcing his commitment to Draco. The Weasleys would be forced to recognize Harry alongside Draco or reject him outright. There were several other in-between options, mostly involving various sorts of snubs, but Draco refused to let himself dwell on those.
“Not if I stand him up first.”
“We were just cleaning up the area near the Headmistress’s office,” said Hermione, pulling spiderwebs out of her bushy hair. “Why are you here so late, Harry?”
McGonagall’s expression was formidable. “Chairman, at Hogwarts, we do not
Harry, Cale, and Chris walked up, and Nate pounced on them immediately. “Okay, Harry and Cale are a yes, so Chris? Yes or no?” He pointed the pen at Chris in a rather threatening way.
“Deal,” Harry agrees, running his fingers over Draco’s Marked arm again. In response, Draco caresses his face, and Harry thinks that Draco is going to kiss him. But instead, he gracefully initiates a hug to which Harry responds eagerly. Disappointed, he buries his face in the crook between Draco’s shoulder and neck, holding tightly to the blonde man while resisting the urge to nuzzle in. He hasn’t been able to fully process much of what Draco said, especially the part about dating, but this is no longer the time or place for deep reflection.
house. No wonder he’d overheard so many parents telling their little first years to stay sober.
“Leave it, Ernie,” commanded Abbott. “I plan to speak with Headmistress McGonagall straight away as to why a
Draco joined the hug, wrapping them all tightly together. “Thank you for having us,” he said sincerely. “After the unfortunate press we had before, it was intimidating, to say the least, to come out publically.”
“She might even like crocheting better,” said Draco. “Maybe she’d be willing to learn how to make amigurumi together?” he asked Harry. “Since, you know, other people have no interest in or talent for the craft,” he finished with a smirk.
Lucius was still in Azkaban for his crimes, a situation to which Draco was indifferent. Without his father’s influence, he could have avoided years’ worth of suffering. He would have never joined the Dark Lord out of his own inclination. Draco reluctantly admitted that Lucius was his father, but refused to allow him to play any role in the decisions he made now or would make after Lucius was released.
“What are you lot doing here so late?” asked Harry, pushing away his emotions.
“Never,” Harry said solemnly, and Draco could see the promise in his eyes.
“Fascinating,” said Luna distractedly, still scribbling. They gave her a minute to catch up; Draco Transfiguring more tea while she transcribed. “Draco, is your relationship with Harry something more than just a fling to cope with the aftermath of war?”
him.”
“Of course not,” Seamus laughs. “I swear, Harry, you’ve got to lower those standards a bit. There hasn’t been one man in three years you’ve found suitable. Merlin, if they have a hot arse, go for it.”
At this Potter smiled, and the atmosphere slipped back into one of ease once more. “Was that really so hard to admit?” he asked.
“So you don’t trust me,” said Draco. “You don’t want me because you think I have some elaborate ploy to screw you over. It’s okay, Potter, I get it.” He spun on his heel and turned to leave before he said something he regretted.
“Probably more,” Hermione amended, snatching the top copy and quickly skimming it. “I know I’ve read at least nine issues-–”
Too soon, it was over, and Draco came back to his senses enough to find Harry lovingly carding his fingers through his hair. “Did I live up to my promise?” Draco asked huskily, too chuffed to even consider being annoyed about the mess his hair surely was now.
“Want me to do it?” suggested Harry. Cale nodded yes immediately, and the two jumped out of the car to switch seats. Traffic lights and congested roads practically gave him heart attacks, but Harry secretly loved parallel parking. Arthur Weasley had been so impressed that time when Harry gave him a quick overview of the technique and how to position the mirrors.
“Wow,” Harry said finally, after they’d broken apart.
“Did you just call me pretty?” asked Harry, dumbfounded.
Chris and Cale came over as well, rooting through the box for their usual numbers, 7 and 13.
Potter started moving his fingers in a circular pattern, with just a bit more pressure. It felt amazing. Malfoy was struggling not to push back into Potter’s hand to demand more rubbing and petting, but then Potter spoke.
He forced himself to recall what he and Hermione still had to revise for their
“I’ve heard of sillier things that Muggles do,” said Draco, noticing that his mouth had gone dry.
The thought of Apparating home made him uncomfortable, as usual. No matter what spell he used, Draco could never manage to disguise his smoking from Father. It wasn’t fair or right, but he’d long given up on any semblance of control over his own life, even five years after graduating from Hogwarts.
“Alright,” said Harry, confused. “I’ll just get that, then.” He bent down and scooped the food off of the floor, neatly depositing it into the trash. “Sit down, I’ll make more.”
The girls scattered while they still could, randomly throwing gear into bags before carpooling home.
They converged on home plate, José slapping Harry on the ass and grinning. Even after two months in America, Harry hadn’t yet grown used to the level of familiarity Americans had with one another.
Still teasing, Harry met Draco’s eyes, smirking again. Draco was enthralled by the look of love in Harry's eyes as he started kissing his way up Draco’s chest, lightly tickling his sides. Draco started to get nervous as Harry worked his way down again and began unzipping Draco’s trousers.
“I appreciate it,” Harry said. “Can’t have too much coffee.”
“By all means,” Draco drawled, picking his crochet back up. For good measure, he pulled his ruler back out and made sure that he did, indeed, still have to add another two inches.
“Speaking of leaving,” said Chris, checking his watch. “Weren’t you supposed to be meeting up with our new pal Draco?”
Teaching Associate for one section of Potions 100. Should a TA position become available, you will be appointed at that time.

.” At Harry’s excited, yet slightly worried look, she laughed. “Don’t worry, you’ll burn it off. As you can imagine, we have a very detailed itinerary this week.”
“No need to drive,” said Draco nonchalantly. “There’s a practice field right on campus.” He led the way down the road, away from the large stadium overlooked by his bedroom window, and up a set of stairs to the field. The dirt infield was regular sized, but the grassy outfield stretched out a long way, bordering the Music building and serving as a cut-through to the students coming from the main campus.
“Want to come with us?” Harry flings back. “You might even enjoy it.”
As the team pounded towards home plate, Cale the right fielder slapped Harry on the shoulder. “I think you’ve got a real chance with her, mate!”
McGonagall pursed her lips. “I shall pay Molly Weasley a fire-call this evening,” she said. “However, there is no excuse for this expression of brutality. You both will come with me.” Without glancing back, McGonagall exited the Great Hall. As Harry gathered his things with the intention of following her, Draco quickly stood and pulled him in for a kiss, relishing the physical contact while Weasley glared on from across the table.
Draco’s fork scraped the plate. There were carrots too, and Hermione had remembered to season them with butter and nutmeg. He couldn’t have asked for a better meal. Across the room, another page turned. The silence seemed pregnant.
Draco struggled to hold his tongue. His wand hand twitched under the table, desperate to cast something sinister at the Weasel. The color drained from Mrs. Weasley’s face as she turned to round on him, but before she could lay into the Weasel properly, there was an interruption.
“I'm sure it will work out,” Harry said.
They ended up finding a new place to live (after two weeks of reluctantly splitting their nights between the Manor and Grimmauld Place) in Hogsmeade sometime during the first week of November. It was a shoddy studio flat, with a small kitchen and an even smaller closet—much to Draco’s despair—but the owner wasn’t prejudiced, the neighbors were never home, and they were within walking distance of Hogwarts.
Hogwarts would be re-opening in a couple months, and Draco was nervous. The Minister had sent him an official notification stating that he was required to finish his education in order to keep his pardon. He’d been expecting to go back (and rather longing to, if he was honest with himself) but a lot of his Slytherin classmates were definitely not going to return. It simply wouldn’t be the same—but maybe that wouldn’t be a bad thing.
With only a slightly suspicious glance, George took Draco’s hand and shook it. “Good to see you too, Malfoy.”
“I’m actually studying for my Mastery right now,” Malfoy reveals.
“I absolutely understand your situation,” Hermione retorted. “It’s time to live your life, Draco. If you don’t stop hiding from the world, it’s going to eat away at everything you’ve accomplished.”
“Thanks,” Potter said to the elf.
Harry could definitely feel his face turning red. “Inside me,” he said with not a little bit of hesitation.
Weasley pulled out a pocket knife and started slicing open one of the candies, which Draco hazily recalled to be a Puking Pastille. “Do you see your relationship with Harry as another act of self-preservation?”
Hermione didn’t move. “Does Harry know you’ve ended it?”
Panic flooding him, Draco shot up and grabbed his wand, casting a quick Tempus. He only had minutes to get ready and apparate to Hogwarts, where he was supposed to meet Potter.
Harry quietly observed her, shaking his head. “You didn’t,” he said. “You didn’t drink rum again before lunch on an empty stomach.” Back at Hogwarts, there were one or two occasions when Hermione had done this, before she knew how to mitigate the effect of alcohol. It hadn’t happened since then, not the least because she and Draco drank wine often and her body had adjusted to being poisoned.
Draco was anxiously running his hands through his hair, twitching just the slightest little bit. Harry came to the unpleasant realization that Draco’s anxiety must have worsened since he left London. “You’re here already,” he said, trembling more noticeably now.
He even went back to Debate Club the following week, after a long, self-reflection where he considered the attraction he felt for Jake and what it might mean. Draco wasn’t the type to simply sleep around so he could figure out his sexual identity, but he grudgingly reminded himself to keep it under consideration. Jake, for his part, had been friendlier and more easy-going than when Draco had left his apartment, which was a big relief for Draco. He had been hoping that a momentary lapse of judgement hadn’t screwed up his acquaintance with one person he actually liked in the school. They went on to partner for the next practice debate on women’s health rights and abortion, and annihilated their pro-life competition.
Malfoy’s silver eyes met his, and Harry saw fear and hurt lurking there. “Malfoy—" he said, "Come on. Tell me."
Potter looked around with wide eyes. “Wow, Malfoy. Is this another one of your mother’s gardens?”
“How much do you want?” responds Harry, fiddling with a wooden shot glass cabinet on the wall that’s slightly off-balance.
Draco groaned, pitching his designer soap bar across the room where it shattered against the wall, leaving a pale blue lump on the otherwise pristine wall.
treat,” so Harry didn’t think much of it when Draco yelped and started waving the paper around.
A hint of nervousness came over Draco’s face. Harry could guess why.
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
Draco cocked his head back to look Harry in the eye. “I’m your partner now in every sense of the word,” he corrected, “and don’t get too used to it. I’m equally good on the bottom.”
“’Course,” Harry said, Summoning it. “Want pancakes for breakfast?”
Harry laughed and pulled Malfoy in for the kiss they’d both been longing for. There was something about him, physical appearance aside, which drew Harry in. After a moment, Malfoy pulled away and said, “I guess I see your point; you really do need to get cleaned up, Potter.”
, Kingsley would have us out in no time, especially after that promotion he just got at the barrister’s office.” She shook her head as if to clear the thought from her mind. “But that’s not the point!”
and a giant cloud of steam.
What would he even say to this camper? Draco looked at her awkwardly, trying to think up a question that would prompt a decent conversation. She wasn’t in his group, though, so he couldn’t ask her about the arts and crafts they’d done after breakfast.
“It’s already half-six,” Hermione said, finally interrupting his endless train of thought. “You have five minutes and then you get to proofread it yourself.”
“What do you mean, ‘team meeting’?” howled Zee. “We’ve already
Draco grasped Harry’s arm and frog-marched him towards their bedroom. “I’ll be warm quite soon enough,” he said quietly, trying to convey desire.
They usually went home together, but Draco wanted to stay at Hogwarts later than usual to do some sort of research. Harry’s patient waiting lasted through dinnertime, but, once it was more than an hour after they usually ate, his rumbling stomach encouraged him to quickly cook something to eat. To be fair, he left half for Draco, providing he ever
“Well, Potter?” Malfoy grinned. “In the mood for a cuppa and some biscuits? I’m positively famished.”
La Vie en Rose
They went into the house as a family with a “But dear, what about the rest of the samples?” from Mr. Granger and a faint “Are you really going into the wine business?” from Mrs. Granger as the door closed.
“Potter, you’re most certainly not fine. I can see through that little act you’re putting on. After six years antagonizing you at Hogwarts, don’t you think I can tell your moods apart with ease?”
“Damn straight I have,” says Seamus, clapping a hand down on Harry’s shoulder. “So when’s it going to be? Tomorrow night? I did have plans to drop by this one place, but I can easily incorporate you.”

Settled comfortably at the library, Draco skimmed through

“Still,” said Malfoy, carding a hand through his perfect blonde hair. “I want to make reparations. And to….” He trailed off again, almost as if the words would not come off of his tongue.
’, remember? Slughorn only reiterated that about a million times. We’re drawing on what’s already been done and adding to it--from what we’ve found in our research so far, no one else has ever thought of only adding half the beetles’ eyes at a time or scrambling the yolk before adding the mothwing dust.”
Harry’s heart expanded as he watched Draco sitting with the two elder Weasleys at the picnic table and eating with them, noticing how he visibly grew more comfortable as the conversation went on.
He was relieved when Harry went slowly because his body wasn’t used to this anymore and needed plenty of time to adjust. Harry had really good instincts though, and he kept Draco turned on during the entire adjustment period. By the time Draco was fully filled, he was more than ready to speed things up.
“Potter, I’m not perfect,” Malfoy spat. “I asked for it, alright? I’m fine.”
that a conversation we had, Ron?” snaps Harry. “My apologies again.”
Jake apparently hadn’t noticed how uncomfortable Draco was. He tried again to kiss Draco, but was deflected as Draco turned his head away. Hurt, Jake asked, “Draco?”
It initially felt weird—other than that one time on the living room floor, no one besides Harry had ever cuddled him—and Draco was tense until Hermione reached out and pulled him back against her chest.
“– -If anything, death’s inspired me-–”
“You mean you’re saying yes to a night out?”
Draco started to argue, but something caused him to look down at Narcissa’s left hand. There was no wedding ring there. Softening, he asked, “So you’re finished with Father, then?”
“Go home,” says Draco moodily. “At least one of us has a chance at happiness then.”
“Oomph,” Draco grunted, thumping all the issues of
I understand what he means.
“Harry,” says Ron, laying a hand on his best friend’s shoulder. “Of course I want you to date. But really, I don’t think this is the best way to go about it. I know you but Seamus doesn’t, not as well as I do, and he’s going to push you past your limits.”
“Of course I remember the War,” says Hermione, biting back. “But I honestly believe that a good grasp of a situation and background knowledge about the condition one suffers from is the foundation to solving the problem.”
Harry and Ron have a conversation.
They were getting evicted. Apparently, the seller had learned that Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater, would be occupying the residence along with Harry Potter, Chosen One and Saviour, and so the landlord had canceled their lease.
Blushing, Harry realizes just how stimulating the short dance had been. His trousers are bulging from the hardness of his cock, and he desperately wants the adorable man to come back and incorporate a lap dance into the act. Unfortunately, the dancers rotate, and another scantily dressed man comes near their table. The song switches to a hot and heavy beat, and the dancers all whip back their trench coats to reveal bright red thongs. He can’t help seeking out his dancer and examining the man’s package, which is quite nice.
Every day, they played catch and practiced the different types of throwing and fielding. Harry wanted Malfoy to get as much exposure to the most basic baseball skills as possible, and so he even tried to incorporate extra drills into the regular team practices. Other than a few nasty looks and muttered comments from Zee, the team had been generally accepting of the back to basics review. Nate especially had been thrilled: he always was saying how good mechanics were the key to successful baseball.
Steve mixed the drinks, handing one to Harry. As he was about to take a swig, Harry clicked their glasses together. “Cheers, mate.”
“What are
Somehow, despite his early morning musings, these were concerns that hadn’t come up.
“I fail to see the relevance of this to my current situation with Harry,” Draco said. He flicked the kettle on, drawing a mug out of the cupboard for a cup of tea. “Perhaps it’s true that your ex has changed. Mine has not. He’s still the same boneheaded knob he was a year and a half ago when he left me for the American Aurors.”
The kitchen was spotless, save for the ham and bread in the middle of the floor. “I’ll get that,” Harry said, reaching for his wand.
“Honestly, Draco,” Harry said, nuzzling into Draco’s neck, closer to his ear, “I’ve wanted you ever since the beginning of the semester. But it never seemed to be the right time, and I reckoned I couldn’t push it after I gave you such shit when you brought it up over the summer.”
Harry caught José’s eye, and without a second glance they grabbed mitts and another baseball before making their way out onto the field as well.
. He brought her chocolate the next week as a thank you, and they became fast friends instantly.
He delicately drew breath from the cigarette, trying to make it last longer. It never did, but he somehow still couldn’t convince himself to stop trying.
They sat there for the next fifteen minutes soaking and squeezing Lysol until the floor was more or less back to how it’d been before.
“Let’s go,” Potter finally said, keeping his thoughts private, which was maybe for the best. He stood up and offered a hand to Draco, who let Potter pull him to his feet.
“You’ll come out with great scores,” Ginny promised. “Only Hermione’s beating you for the top of the class,” she grinned.
Draco wasn’t going to argue with him, though the words stung as much as the mark on his face.
“Are we okay?” He asked once he had changed and was now sitting with Harry at the table.
Draco’s heart hadn’t dropped in months in the way it did when he found out that Harry knew about his parents. It wasn’t that he expected him to tell him outside of his bosses orders, although it was quite annoying especially when he hated the job. He just didn’t understand why he couldn’t have told him afterwards, when Draco had specifically asked him.
Marvin’s exhausted face met his glance when he walked in, his under eyes dark with a lack of sleep, and his face grey and colourless. Draco was even more secure in his decision to drop the auror program whenever he saw them look so beat up and restless. He closed the door quietly behind him, greeting Marvin with a handshake and taking a seat on the padded velvet chair in front of the desk.
“Let’s just say it wasn’t the best coping mechanism.” He responded. Truthfully he hadn’t drank since Harry had cheated on him, something about the alcohol painfully reminding him of the time spent with him.
They had danced for around half an hour, their hips would occasionally grind against each other accidentally, and would send a jolt up Draco’s body, daring him to press himself further up against Harry.
“Merlin, Harry…” Draco said with a sigh, looking up at Harry grinning at him from ear to ear.
Harry wanted to cry and run away, but he tried again, this time with slightly more force, as if urging him to kiss back. And he did. His lips pressed back against Harry’s, slow and soft, both of them scared that if they make drastic moves that it’ll scare the other away.
The fall used to be a time of joy for Harry, the falling of the leaves meant returning to Hogwarts once again, the only closest feeling to home he had ever gotten. And although Christmas was bittersweet, he still enjoyed the comfort of the Burrow around that time, its welcoming environment providing a blanket of protection from the cold. But as he graduated the return to Hogwarts had faded in time and as he grew older, his presence at the Burrow was still welcome, but sometimes felt out of place, all of the Weasley’s coupled up with their respective partners and left Harry feeling like a tag along orphan.
This chapter was to sort of explain where both of the boys are at rn, do you guys prefer Draco with Harry or Aaron lmk!!
The words punctured through his chest like a bullet, what should have been so painfully obvious was now for the first time coming to Draco’s mind. Yet in spite of this rationalization, regardless of him knowing the recklessness that he dove towards Harry with, he couldn’t pull himself away.
That part was true, if there was one thing that he and Harry had in common was their never ending list of traumas that they had experienced as adolescents. It had created a strange bond between them, one that couldn’t be understood by nearly anyone else in their lives.
“You noticed?” Draco was surprised, his friends after knowing both of them for several years hadn’t even tied the two together, at least not that he knew of.
Draco’s stomach turned, the alcohol now threatening to make its way back up. Draco sat up straight and backed away from Harry.
“To say the least.” He snarked back. He didn’t mean it, in fact, he enjoyed the first few months of living with Harry immensely. It was only in the last few weeks that things have gotten hostile. Nevertheless, he wanted to hurt Harry’s feelings, prove to him that he didn’t need him.
“Don’t worry it's not a bad thing.” Harry said, laughing at Draco’s tense demeanour.
He did, however, walk over to the nearest liquor store and purchase two bottles of scotch, he had been forced into the social life of muggles for a sense of privacy for so long that he now carried muggle money with him more than he did knuts or sickles.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco sighed and made his way to the kitchen, picking up his mail and sorting through it. He noticed a particular envelope with a red trim. He pulled it out from the bunch, opening it carelessly.
“Ok. Enough lounging around. It’s bloody Christmas morning and we have to get a move on.” Draco exclaimed, jumping out of Harry’s arms and peeling his limbs up from off of the mattress, Harry groaning in protest and knocking his head back to heavy his body.
By no surprise, he had landed in front of Draco’s apartment building, staring up at the dark red brick of the structure. He had been here only once before, stopping by after the raid to look for evidence with Casper. Now, nearly 6 months later, he was seeing it in a completely new light.
And through all of this he had no one to lean on but himself, his two closest friends had both become strangers.
Draco rose from bed after a night of turning in his sleep, unable to stay still or get any bit of rest. This always happened the night before an event that he was anxious for, the night before he was directed to kill Dumbledore, he hadn’t even managed to get a single ounce of sleep. Although this was less extreme, his chest was still heavy and his mind racing. It was the morning of the wedding and his brain had gone through nearly every possible scenario that could occur, as if that would make him any more prepared. He didn’t have to be at the venue until around 4 pm, so he still had the whole day to overthink and get more and more anxious as the time drew closer. It was 7 in the morning, far too early for Malfoy but knowing himself, he knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep any longer. He decided on working on a potion for work in the meantime, hoping to drown himself in his work so as to avoid any confrontation with his own thoughts.
“It was just a drunken thing. He was just the nearest person” Draco shrugged, taking a sip of his coffee. He wasn’t completely sure if what he was saying was true, but that had been the case with nearly everyone else he had slept with so he was sure that it was the same for Potter as well.
They walked up to the entrance of his apartment complex.
The next chapter will also be from Harry's POV, just wanted to provide more context for his interactions with Draco. It should be up midway next week! As always, let me know how you guys are enjoying this fic so far :))
“What's your deal? Are you ok?” Draco asked, still giggling slightly, the alcohol had made it much easier for him to laugh, especially around friends.
“Needed a drink too... I guess.” He knew that was a half assed answer, but he couldn’t tell him he had fought for him at work and now felt a certain obligation to be nice to him. Draco just nodded, sliding over the bottle of liquor against the granite counters, and refilling Harry’s drink, looking up at Harry through his eyebrows towards the end. His stomach churned at the eye contact, he gulped down the entirety of the contents in his glass to suppress it down, before edging it towards Draco for another refill.
“Alright, alright, tell your old pal everything” Aaron chuckled as he pulled up a seat next to Draco and rested his hand on his shoulder. Draco nodded and began to tell him everything, the dinner with his old friends, the engagement, drinking far too much, and even down to seeing Potter at the bar. He could even admit what strange feelings it had stirred up seeing Potter after so long, especially when he had gotten significantly more attractive. It had always been so easy to talk to Aaron, he had been a great listener and always validated his emotions.
Harry left an hour later, claiming he had some Ministry stuff to complete. Draco took this opportunity to call Aaron and invite him over, though they hadn’t been as close recently, he still wanted to update him on the big stuff.
“You’re usually not this nice” Draco responded, glancing over at Harry. It was the first time they made direct eye contact that night for more than a split second. He saw how Draco’s eyes were red, and he had bags under his eyes, something he never pictured Draco having before. He wasn’t sure how to reply back to him, he himself didn’t know why he was being so nonchalant with him.
“I wouldn’t be opposed to it.” He replied followed by a slight smile.
“Jesus Aaron! Do you ever knock?” Draco exclaimed, clutching his chest, with his eyes wide.
“I don’t have your number.” Draco hiccuped, rubbing his eyes.
He was able to admit all of this to himself, able to say that he would beg on his knees for his love if it were ever to be taken away, but yet he still sat here, inches away from the mess of blonde hair reading a book in front of the burning fireplace, and was at a loss for words.
“I suppose this means I’m done being wrapped up with the Ministry?” Draco asked, eager to get out of this office, the air suffocating him slowly.
Draco’s eyes widened.
“Hello Potter” Draco said as he peeked over his shoulder, his voice hoarse and face pale and drained. Harry wasn’t sure how to respond, it was obvious something was wrong. Maybe he somehow found out about his parents.
“No thanks.” He said, grabbing another slice of cold pizza out of the box, trying to walk past Harry.
Harry looked up as if he had something he wanted to say, his eyes darting between his hands and Draco’s eyes, “I-” he paused, grunting in frustration.
“This is familiar,” Draco smirked.
His night had taken a foul turn when he was cursed out in the middle of the Ministry hallway, he couldn’t complain, most of the things that Draco had said were true, and he was painfully aware of them. The occurrence had sent Harry spiralling into a depressive state, making him feel incredibly guilty and unworthy of Draco.
How do you guys like their more affectionate side?
Draco sat on the couch, catching his breath, glancing over at Harry as he opened the door to reveal Hermione and Ron standing there, suitcases in hand.
However, that didn’t get him far. While he was able to keep his feelings for Draco at bay, it had pushed him away completely, his rude remarks and bitter attitude coming back quickly. Each harsh phrase hurt him more than Draco knew.
Draco decided against his obsessive thoughts and headed to the kitchen to make coffee, which he quickly realized was a futile attempt as there were absolutely no groceries anywhere to be found in his apartment. It felt strange being back in his own space, although more comfortable now that he knew Harry was back sleeping in the other room.
“Are you saying what I think you’re saying?” Draco asked, his voice soft for the first time that night.
Marie nodded along, placing a tender hand on his arm in condolence. He felt he was grieving the loss of something he never had.
The group continued on with dinner, sharing two bottles of wine in between themselves, leaving Harry feeling warm and fuzzy. Whenever they all got together, it felt just as it did when they were younger, making Harry feel like life hadn’t changed all that much. The restaurant was starting to close, so they decided on walking Harry home before catching a train. The air was brisk and made his skin prickly, as the hair on his body extended from the abrupt change in temperature. They strolled down the streets in London, sharing stories about their times at Hogwarts, nostalgic for the few days where they felt they weren’t in impending danger. Ron and Hermione walked hand in hand, keeping each other warm, making Harry wildly aware of the emptiness of his own hand. He rarely felt like a third wheel with them, but on specific occasions when it was cold and dark, he wondered how nice it would be to have someone there.
“No, no. It’s just me.” Draco nodded. He wasn’t expecting Harry to still be single, it gave me a tinge of hope that he knew to shut down. Harry and him didn’t work for a plethora of reasons, most of the time the only thing holding them together was their undeniable chemistry, but chemistry can only go so far.
“And why’s that” he could tell that Draco was growing impatient.
“Well. You see Draco dear, I was going to bring you a bottle to congratulate you on your move or something like that, but I drank it unfortunately. I did however stop by the liquor store and grab you one more, which I may or may not have started without you.” Harry slurred, swaying from side to side as his eyelids fluttered.
“Starving. Barely ate today.” he responded. Draco nodded in agreement and stood up from the couch. His hand outstretched to Harry, inviting him to take it. Harry stared at it for a few seconds before clasping his warm hands around Draco’s, allowing him to pull him off of the couch.
Hermione and Ron had been dancing, he wasn’t really sure where Harry was either, and quite frankly he was disinterested in finding him after the things he said earlier, particularly when he was the one that was in the wrong.
“You know about what.”
So when the most exciting part of their day was just them sitting on the front porch of the house, sipping coffee and reading, Harry felt intoxicated in a way that made him want to never return back home. He would buy a property in Italy somewhere, maybe keep a garden or take up knitting.
“It’s no worry, I wasn’t really the best boyfriend so it's understandable. I wanted to apologize for that, by the way, you deserved better.” Harry said genuinely, his face serious and his eyebrows furrowed. “I was an idiot, probably still am.”
Harry needed this. He needed this so badly that his heart ached. He took Draco’s face in his hands, turning it towards him.
Draco woke up to the sound of someone cooking in the kitchen, he could see through the cracks of his eyes that it was already dark outside, his eyes still heavy with sleep. He reached his arms out in a stretch, thankful for the dreamless sleep that finally made him feel rested. He sat up in the bed, eyes still closed as he began to feel the rest of his body waking up. Walking back out of the room, he rubbed his eyes with the sleeve of his shirt, saying a hello to Aaron.
By the time they got to the end of their meal they both couldn’t get their hands off each other, constantly touching. Whether it be through their feet connecting or a hand casually placed on the others arm. What would seem as inconspicuous from the outside was their own signals of desire.
“Well. You see Draco dear, I was going to bring you a bottle to congratulate you on your move or something like that, but I drank it unfortunately. I did however stop by the liquor store and grab you one more, which I may or may not have started without you.” Harry replied, feeling his eyes heavy with the alcohol. He swung up the second bottle, hoping Draco would invite him in.
As he rubbed his thumb over the palm of Noah’s hand, Noah drew back, breaking their stare and taking a large gulp of his wine.
“You have no idea how anal my mother is! I swear to Merlin that woman is absolutely abysmal during the holidays” Casper complained, signalling to the bartender for another round.
Through all the arguing back and forth, he has not once heard Harry mutter the words I’m sorry. Perhaps that's what kept Draco so stubborn from forgiveness, Harry hadn’t even asked for it.
Harry cautiously picked up the gift, “You were really making fun of my wrapping when yours is a dark green envelope?” he laughed.
Harry entered his office, slumping down into his chair with a groan, resulting in a questionable look from Casper.
Draco, knowing that any attempt at denying this request would be inefficacious, nodded.
Harry simply nodded and placed a soft kiss on his cheek.
They were now both incredibly drunk, the group at the party had played several drinking games, most of which Harry and Draco lost, resulting in them having to drink a large amount. They were leaning on each other for most of the night, holding each other up from falling while laughing.
“Suit yourself.” Draco slurred, taking another swig of his drink. Harry brought his own glass up to his lips, thinking about the last time they had talked with Draco this drunk. It was at Noah and Aurora’s wedding and he remembered Draco leaning in a little too close, if Harry was any drunker he probably would have made his own advances on him. He didn’t have too many people he knew at the wedding besides Casper and he had had a rough day at work the night before. Thinking about it now, Harry wasn’t in too different of a situation right now.
“Yeah whatever. Don’t bother Harry, I’m sure he’s just looking for a shag and you happen to be the closest thing. Merlin knows that's his way of picking men anyway.” He stormed off down the street, leaving Draco and Harry alone.
“Draco? Can we talk?” Harry asked, shutting the door behind him.
Draco met Harry’s eyes for the first time that night, the way that Harry was looking at him made him want to look away. The feeling was like someone was looking at him and really seeing him for once.
Harry nodded while pouting his lips, putting his forehead into Draco’s shoulder in defeat. Draco ran his fingers through his hair, feeling the soft curls in between his fingers.
“As a matter of fact, I love cooking. Why don’t you pass me the spatula before you set this whole apartment on fire, ok?” He asked, his voice soft. He had no energy to argue with Potter today, his hand grabbing the spatula from his and signalling for him to go and sit at the table.
“Does Aaron know where you are?” Harry asked.
Harry placed his hands along Draco’s back, his hands sliding his sweater up and touching his bare back. His stomach turned at this simple connection, his mouth opening to deepen the kiss further and his fingers pulling lightly at Harry’s hair. He moaned into this kiss, grinding his hips against Harry’s and arching his back from the contact, his mind both racing and empty at the same time.
“Maybe I don’t either.” Harry responded, bringing their faces closer. Their lips grazed lightly, before Draco reached his face further forward, connecting their lips. The kiss was soft at first, their lips pressing against each other lightly. Though it quickly grew deeper as Harry opened his mouth, their tongues connecting.
Draco pushed Harry out of the room first, going to grab the envelope containing his gift and jamming it into his pant pockets, hoping he had been at least semi-nonchalant.
“Jesus Draco, some weekend you’ve had.” Aaron exclaimed, then offering up exactly what Draco needed.
Maybe that’s why he felt drawn to Draco in the first place, his authenticity with his struggles had taken Harry off guard, it wasn’t often that the people around him didn’t try to hide any discrepancies in their lives. But like all encounters he’s had with affection in the last 10 years, he did anything he could to destroy it, feeling unworthy of the love he saw everyone else experience.
“It’s a funny story actually..” He responded chuckling awkwardly.
The first few weeks of their attempt at a relationship was perfect. At least in the eyes of Harry. He had been a coward, and he was now doing everything he could to prove to Draco that he was willing to make this work.
Draco smiled at the sight of a slumber Harry in his bed, tucking his hair behind his ear affectionately before walking out of the guest room, closing the door quietly behind him.
They were keeping watch of the house from across the street, it had dark red brick with overgrown moss cascading down the sides of the house, the lights still on to maintain a facade that the family was still there. Harry had grown so sick of the auror work, desperate to have an escape from dark magic that he had been forced to hunt down for his whole life. It placed substantial pressure to constantly live up to his own name - Harry Potter, the boy who lived - never allowing him to feel like he could make mistakes or be anything less than prophetic greatness. This led Harry to a distorted view of self worth, he felt that unless he was stopping the next Voldemort, he would become nothing worth remembering, it was a disproportionate punishment that he gave himself, but one he couldn’t let go of. It amazed him how Draco had dropped the auror program, it felt so oddly juxtaposed from the Draco he knew in school. Back then, Harry was known as the brave one and Draco, in Harry’s eyes at least, was a coward. Now, Harry wishes he had the ability to live by his own ruling rather than everyone else's, wishing for the bravery he sees in Draco.
“What?”
“We shouldn’t.” Draco whispered, turning his face away from Harry, his eyes stinging with the threat of tears.
Harry stomped through the halls of the Ministry. How could Marvin even suggest that Harry keep this from Draco? And threaten his job? Harry wasn’t sure if it was entitlement, but he was sure that the last person to lose their job in the auror department would be him. He apparated home, shoving his keys through the lock, and slamming the door behind him as he entered. He attempted to calm himself down using deep breaths, but the effect was miniscule. He walked down the hall, messaging his temple. He peered into Draco’s room, the door was slightly ajar, the room was dark and the sheets were messy, clothes on the floor but Draco nowhere to be seen. If Harry had to deal with kicking out one of Draco’s one night stands right now he might actually lose it. He prepared his voice for more yelling while walking into the kitchen. But the only thing his eyes were greeted by was Draco hunched over a glass of scotch, a half empty bottle no further than an arm's length away. He was wearing a dark grey sweatsuit and his hair was dirty and unkept. He had never seen Draco so undone.
Harry's lips continued to graze over his neck, lingering up towards his ear.
“Wait.” Draco said,
Instead, he had to be riddled by the soul crushing experience of unrequited love, once again.
Fuck. The last thing Draco needed was to have to live in some shitty little shack provided by the ministry, lord knows they wouldn’t provide their finest accommodations to an ex death eater. Still, he nodded curtly. It’s not like he had many other options. They left the room, leaving him alone after instructing him that he had a couple of hours before they would assign him housing. So basically, he just had to skirt off and find something to do until then. He got up from his seat, dusting off his suit from last night. He still hasn’t changed since the wedding since he had to come to the Ministry in the middle of the night. He rubbed his eyes, feeling them burn into the palms of his hands. He desperately needed sleep, and a shower. He still reeked of booze from last night. Pulling out his phone from his pocket, debating dialling Aaron’s number, but deciding against it. He would just show up to Aaron’s apartment as he knew if he called him now after ignoring him for nearly 48 hours, he would get an earful over the phone. And although it may be worse in person, at least he would have the space to leave if need be.
“Do you mind if I borrow some pants and a sweater? My outfit from yesterday reeks of pavement and alcohol.” Harry said, his voice slightly hoarse and his arm crossed against his body in a futile attempt to hide the rest of his nearly naked body.
Although he knew that Draco was still mad, he followed him up the stairs and into the bedroom, wanting to make up before the festivities of the evening.
“Thank you. I don’t think either of us were ready for what happened, looking back we were such kids.” Draco said, hoping to lighten the mood.
Draco wasn’t sure how to answer this. No. But that didn’t feel right. What he felt for Harry wasn’t a want, it was a gut wrenching need.
They called out their goodnights and Draco joined Harry on the couch.
“Wowww so fancy! Just what I expected from pompous Draco Malfoyy” Harry exclaimed, slurring the end of his name.
“Holy fuck, Harry. Are you fucking serious?” He asked.
“Oh. No, sorry, I’m here with my friend so…” Harry trailed off, having a hard time coming up with an excuse.
“That’s what was taking you so long to spit out? An apology? You really are an arrogant bastard” Draco joked, shoving Harry lovingly.
“I’m sorry, I just get scared sometimes.” he said. It was true, Harry did get scared of being vulnerable in any way, especially around someone like Draco. He leaned his head against Draco’s chest, wanting to feel his breath rise and fall. At this, Draco only stiffened, sending a pang to Harry’s heart.
So he was left standing alone while he watched Harry glow with vibrance around his friends.
“I am assuming he will stay in the Potter residence for no less than a month, until we gather our resources to track the location of the next attack.” Harry’s mouth fell agape. Since when did he become a bed and breakfast for ex death eaters? It was bad enough he had to feel uncomfortable in his own home, but to have to keep Draco as a guest for that long felt like his own personal form of torture. Harry kept a mental note to confront Marvin after the meeting, surely the Ministry safe houses would be emptied out within the next week.
They progressed slowly but surely, Draco taking his time to stretch Harry and make sure he was still aroused with the insertion of each new finger.
Malfoy takes a deep breath, looking away for a moment. “During that year when he wasn’t out recruiting giants, Macnair would visit my quarters at the Manor. He’d bring Yaxley with him, though Yaxley never sought me out himself. Father was no longer in the Dark Lord’s good favor, so he couldn’t do anything to protect me.”
Potter took it upon himself to rid them of their shirts, and then their trousers, all the while nibbling Draco’s nipples and kissing his way down his chest until he was at the waistband of Draco’s pants.
As much as Harry’d hated taking those photos, he couldn’t regret the experience in the slightest after seeing the photo splashed across the front cover: the one of Draco leaning against the side of his head in comfort as Harry fervently wished he could Apparate back to their flat and cuddle Draco.
“Thank you,” Draco said. He offered his hand to Weasley, who shook it.
“It’s not your fault, you know,” Potter said mildly as he went over a particularly sore area and Draco struggled to keep from yelping in pain.
Smiling, she clapped her hands together and went to retrieve their lists of interview questions. Lightning quick, Draco broke posture to pour a cup of tea, whipping out his wand and Transfiguring it into what Harry was almost certain was the decaffeinated black tea he consumed in mass quantities.
“I’m sorry that happened, Malfoy.”
Trembling, he handed her the envelope. They briefly made eye contact, and thousand things seemed to pass between them before she looked down to open it. The tearing of the paper seemed too loud in the quiet room, but soon enough the wrinkled envelope was on the table as she unfolded the envelope. Draco took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
“Eat up, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley fondly.
. Was that in New York? he wondered idly. The loud
‘Pal’ and ‘Draco’ were two words Harry did not ever want to hear put together in a sentence again. Though they’d come to an unsteady truce, there was no getting over seven solid years of hatred in one day.
Harry spared a quick what the fuck for the opposing team’s name, and then tuned back into what Nate was saying. “I think we’re nearly there, guys –”
“Why don’t you start taking this dirt out to the greenhouses?” said Harry. "I'm going to work on the walls."
Mimicking Harry’s earlier actions, Draco dips his finger into the lube and looks up questioningly. Harry nods yes, so Draco softly coaxes open Harry’s bum hole and inserts his finger. Even as Draco hits all of Harry’s favorite spots with his mouth as his finger rubs Harry’s prostate, he can’t get the image of Asten out of his head. “Draco,” he gasps. “Please stop – I can’t, I’m not ready for this –”

Malfoy nodded. Harry wasn’t going to push him anymore tonight. He wouldn’t have minded holding Malfoy for longer, but his legs were going numb after being stretched out for so long. He slowly released his grip, and Malfoy slid his own fingertips up Harry’s forearms as he sat up. Finally Malfoy turned to face him, and Harry could see tear tracks from where the droplets had run off Malfoy’s face. Impulsively, he thought about reaching out and wiping Malfoy’s face clean.
Draco had expected that Potter would be good in the sack, but he didn’t think they would manage to develop such synergy with each other. Potter thrust and Draco rose up to meet him, undulating together as though they’d been lovers for years. In a way, Draco almost supposed that they had.
“It’s hard to put into words, but I like your humor, mostly it’s not scathingly directed at me; I like that you can hold a conversation about anything, even if it’s only something I’m interested in; I like that you do little things to show that you care about someone, like when you brought Neville’s Fanged Geraniums extra flies because you remembered how he said they should be rewarded when they went long periods of time without biting someone. I like how you’re competitive and passionate and resilient.”

There was a sound from across the other room and Ron Weasley’s voice was calling out, “Have those Slytherin wankers finally left yet?”
“Oh, I feel like I should tell you that I don’t use hangover potions the morning after,” Potter smirked.
“Fuck,” Harry said, massaging his face bones with both of his hands. “Yup, that was Malfoy.”
“Coffee, Harry?” Ron asked loudly as Hermione snatched the joint out of his hand. Wisely, Ron decided to give it up as a lost cause.
Feeling incredibly awkward, Harry starts moving his hips in a circle, trying to remember a dance move other than the robot. He only grows more uncomfortable when Seamus laces his hands around his waist and starts grinding his crotch into Harry’s arse.
“You – two – need – to – make up your minds,” panted Taryn after three laps around the outer bounds of the field and four times through the agility track Malfoy set up down all three baselines.
“We might even get to see each other if Finnigan doesn’t murder me first,” Draco said. He was only half-joking, too. Draco hadn’t forgotten how Finnigan looked at him with cruelty in his eyes the first day Draco participated in renovations.
They seat themselves, and a young waiter promptly rushes over, carrying water glasses with lime and two menus. Harry already knows what he’s getting, so he watches Draco’s expressions as the other man considers the menu.
to Harry. Somehow, he understood, or was excellent at reading Draco by now, because he restrained himself and remained calmly seated.
Doubtfully, Draco mulls it over. “I’m studying potions, not dueling.”
“Is it something you enjoy, though?” Hermione asked skeptically.
“Harry –”
Draco smiles, but it doesn’t seem to match his eyes. “Thanks. I’m sorry to cut your dessert short, but I forgot about an early engagement I have scheduled for tomorrow morning.”
“Draco,” she hissed at him impatiently. “Where have you been? Thanks for deserting me with a sodding cart full of shit, you wanker.”
Pressure on his wrists. “Look at me. Look at me!” He was being shaken. No choice but to look up. Bright, much too bright. Frightened brown eyes stared into his. “Draco. Come on, breathe with me. In… two… three… four… out… two… three… four.”
“Merlin, that’s way too much information for me,” mumbles Harry, trying to clear his mind of the unfortunate imagery.
analysis, he digested book after book on literary theory with silent thank you’s to scholars such as Terry Eagleton. After forming his initial interpretations, Draco would pull ideas from all different genres of literary theory to apply to the text. He could forget everything while immersed in Athusser’s definitions of ideological apparatuses or Creed’s conceptualization of the monstrous feminine.
happy with Ron anymore. In good faith, I couldn’t let us celebrate our anniversary and pretend that everything’s normal, because it clearly
“Oh,” Draco moaned, closing his eyes. “I do love my plug, but you feel so much better, you know.”

“When you say that, do you mean that you’re never watching Seamus partake in that again, or that you’re never participating in one?”

“That’s not the worst part,” ‘Dromeda said, forging on, as Draco wondered how much more there could possibly be. “As they were escorting Zabini out, some renegade started shouting about how the Ministry wasn’t doing enough. He fancied himself a hero, and shot curses at the defenseless Zabini. The Ministry was forced to protect him, but they clearly didn’t want to.”
“Say,” chirped Zee, “How about letting us off practice tomorrow then?” They met 4 times a week for practice (Nate’s team wasn’t second in the league for nothing) on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturday mornings.
anymore with his...condition,” he finished lamely, face flushed bright red. “I didn’t expect to be talking about sex with you, of all people, Weasley.”
“Even so,” replied Nate. “Today’s going to be productive regardless. Everyone take your positions and let’s get this practice over with.”
“That’s a start, I suppose, for you lousy first-classes.” For the first time since the dreary meeting had begun, Schrader’s visage twisted into what resembled a smile. “And what about you, Weasley?” he shouted unexpectedly, intentionally startling Ron. “Have you been helping Potter or sitting in the corner again writing your stupid little love letters?”

He followed Malfoy down alleyways that were dark even at 8am, weaving in and out of buildings until Harry totally lost his sense of direction. They walked on, silently, for another ten minutes. Malfoy gave nothing away about the final destination from his facial expression.
“I’m bouncing,” I whisper to Pansy and Blaise. “If I have to hear another fucking camp song today, I’m going to go bloody mental.”
“I might be persuaded to like you,” Draco corrected.
Harry was determined to get through his exam and start Auror training full time. Maybe if he had some sense of purpose, if he could find a
“Quite,” Draco confirmed, nursing his tea in what Harry was sure was an attempt to keep from scoffing at her refusal to abide by formal etiquette.
They opened the envelopes at the same time, though Draco was slightly more nervous now that one of his chances was on the line. It was nerve-wracking as well that Hermione had already received so many acceptances…
From the change in music, Harry senses that the performance is coming to an end and feels an accompanying tinge of grief. The dance is marvelous, the sexy cowboy is marvelous, and this kind of thing should go on all night. The man turns his back to the audience one more time, fluffing his arse up as he delicately circles around. With that, he faces forward again, reaching behind him to pull out a silver pistol that Harry hadn’t even noticed and shoots it into the ceiling with a sharp bang. As he lowers his arm, Harry makes eye contact with the dancer and instantly feels his stomach drop painfully.
His recent disinterest in hookup culture was beginning to worry him, every man he has tried to sleep with since that fateful night in October was only ranked in comparison to Draco; and the more they looked, acted, and fucked like he did, the higher on the list they were. Draco had become his gold standard, ruining the pleasure of variety for him.
Draco knew it was time to get back to the ministry as they most likely had made a decision on his housing by now, he was just hoping it wouldn’t be anywhere too aggressively Weasley like. He changed back into his suit, which Aaron had washed while he was asleep. He still didn’t know if he was able to get the clothes from his apartment, he hoped he wouldn’t have to wear exclusively this suit for the next few weeks. He walked back out of the room, and handed the clothes that he was lent back to Aaron. Giving him a tight hug and a kiss on the cheek, unsure what he would do without his help.
They dropped their bags in the hallway when they walked in, gasping at the warm and welcoming atmosphere of the home. The interior was paired with more of the stone cobblestone from the outside, but complemented by warm wood toned furniture and a kitchen that was on the smaller side, but by no means took away from the story book environment.
“Whatever you say Harry.” Ron said, taking a swig of his drink.
They bid each other farewell, Harry watching as the couple walked off down the street, Ron opening his jacket for Hermione to cuddle into.
Harry’s eyes lit up with mischief as he turned the corner into the kitchen.
“Draco? Is that you?” A soft voice asked as he was trying to choose a pair of sunglasses on a cheap rack. He muttered a string of curses in his head, of course now had to be the time he ran into someone. He turned on the heel of his shoe, seeing Aurora’s bleached blonde hair  and small physique looking back at him. He grinned the best he could, knowing it looked incredibly inauthentic as he said,
Harry dove right into the function, saying hellos and hugging his old friends, leaving Draco to awkwardly stand behind him. His chest felt tight with anxiety as he continued to feel unwelcome, he cursed himself for even agreeing to come in the first place.
“Oh fuck off Potter, I don’t need to be spending my time with a self righteous asshole who doesn’t give a crap about anyone else but himself.” Draco picked himself up and gathered his belongings, heading away from Potter, he was just going to spend his time at Aaron’s. He doubted Potter was dying to have him stay at his apartment anyway.
He was greeted with a few dirty looks from the likes of Neville and Seamus, but he chose to ignore them. After all, he understood why they would be pissed at him.
“Merlin, Harry. Don’t say stuff like that.”
They finished cleaning and went back into their respective rooms. Draco shutting the door behind him and leaning against it. He thought of what would happen if he ever did kiss Harry. How he would respond and if they would have sex. Although the idea warmed him, he knew that they were able to coexist only because they hadn’t crossed that line, he feared that if he did, nothing good would come out of it.
Harry stared at him suspiciously, unsure if this was a friendly gesture or if he was simply too drunk to notice it was him. Nevertheless, he nodded and grabbed one from the box. Draco lit his lighter and brought it over to Harry’s mouth as he tilted forward and lit his cigarette. They stood in silence for a while, Draco began to take in the situation that he was put into tonight, and his mood fell drastically. He was lonely, and all the drinking and random guys had taken its toll on his mental health.
“Whatever you say, Potter.” Draco replied, before being quickly swept into a nearby empty alleyway by Harry’s arms.
A tear streamed down Draco’s face, his chest aching with a mixture of smoke and heartache. He had decided on going out himself to buy alcohol, understanding that without it not only will he not be able to sleep, he wouldn’t be able to quiet down his mind either.
He rested his glass on a table, his ability to focus fading as he tried to light the cigarette in his mouth, his point of view disoriented.
“I became an auror. It’s not bad, pretty much what was expected of me, even though I sort of hate it.” Potter replied.
“Hmm?” He mumbled, not looking up from his book, his head rested on the base of his hand.
Harry glanced down at Draco’s lips, his arms on either side of his body. They had been in this exact position more times than he could count, neither of them ever taking it further than this.
“Oh, that was not even half of it. You’ll see it on New Years once Hermione actually lets loose.” Harry laughed, wrapping an arm around Draco’s shoulder and placing a kiss on his temple.
“Me too. I mean - us, us too.” He mumbled awkwardly, receiving a scoff of amusement from Casper behind him.
They made their way down the oak stairs, the cold wood chilling his toes. Harry ran straight for the kitchen, quick to put on a pot of coffee while Draco lit the fireplace with a flick of his wand. He quickly placed the envelope underneath the makeshift Christmas tree they assembled last night (it was actually just a large monstera plant that they found in the kitchen and moved next to the fireplace) and took a seat on one of the fluffier couches in the living room as he waited for Harry to return with their mugs.
The portkey was a rundown and old looking beer mug, its intricate designs being one you can find at nearly any tourist shop in London. It whipped Draco back to England, his body snatched and twisted as he landed on the hard concrete of a side alley. His body ached and he had a headache forming behind his eyes. He had realized now that he arrived in England, he had nowhere to go. His apartment seemed distant and cold, he was afraid of the memories that might strike him as soon as he entered through the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I thought you said I didn’t know what I was doing.” Draco said, his pants growing tighter. He was desperate for Harry, no longer able to deny what they both have been avoiding.
Walking back into his apartment after so long had felt so foreign, he could barely see it as a home anymore without the lingering smell of Harry to warm up the atmosphere. His eyes were bloodshot and puffy from his altercation earlier, and he was deeply exhausted. His apartment was still in shambles from the raid, he cast a quick cleaning charm and made his way to his bedroom as it did its magic.
“Cmon now, don’t be so brittle love, why don’t you talk to me anymore?” Harry whined, scooting closer towards Draco despite his efforts to stay apart.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s great I’m happy for you guys, really. I still feel like that might be something you would want to mention before you know, you get married and all that. Feels sorta unfair to Aurora if you ask me.” He was getting angry and he hated himself for showing any kind of emotion around Noah.
“Sure, why not. Remember that bistro outside my office? Let’s meet there at like 2 on Friday?” He said, his grey eyes waiting for a response.
Harry slipped out of Draco and fell on the bed next to him, both of them sticky with sweat and cum, their breathing heavy. They both stayed silent, their chests rising and falling. The traces of alcohol that he felt before were now all gone.
“Are you sure you have no idea what they could have possibly been looking for?” Asked a stern looking auror, Draco could tell he was questioning him, but it's not as if his record was entirely clear. If whoever raided his apartment really was looking for something, Draco had not the slightest clue what it was, besides, this could have all just been to send a message to him.
“I don’t even know, Marie. Merlin, when did life get this complicated.” He said with a groan, his eyes beginning to burn with the rise of tears, he blinked them away quickly.
He had made plans with Aaron to go suit shopping later today as it was the weekend and although he had a plethora of suits to choose from, none felt fit to wear to the wedding of your ex fuck buddy. Draco threw on a pair of shorts and a casual shirt, knowing that the summer heat was blistering and nothing else would suffice.
They had gone back to Draco’s apartment, deciding to have this conversation there instead of a random alleyway. They sat down on the couch, the brown leather crinkling beneath them, a stiff silence in the air. Harry’s eyes were no longer red with impending tears, they were now cold and glazed over. If Draco had to pinpoint the emotion, he would probably say it was jealousy.
He had been sitting at the island in the kitchen for 20 minutes. Lathering himself in self loathing, reevaluating every selfish and hateful decision he had ever made. This made living with himself feel incredibly difficult. He was filled with so many emotions, ones that made his heart throb in anguish, ones he hadn’t allowed himself to feel out of self preservation. He walked over to the liquor cabinet, turning to alcohol once again to attempt to numb himself out.
Harry turned towards Draco,
He watched the door every time he heard the jingle of the bells above it, anxiously eyeing whoever walked in to see if it was him. Draco took a few deep breaths, closing his eyes and breathing in through his nose, and out through his mouth, stilling his heart beat.
He wasn’t sure if he was more shocked at the invitation or at the soft look in Harry. He had seen it often this past week and it always left him feeling strange. Pity from Harry didn’t feel comfortable, but it showed that he cared, which also felt new.
Harry would tear himself apart limb from limb if it pleased him.
Harry placed a palm over the opened pages of the book, preventing Draco from continuing,
“And why’s that” Draco sighed, annoyed.
Draco’s eyes flew open. There was no way. No way that Harry fucking Potter was in this pub. His pub. He almost forgot about the guy he was with, who was beginning to get on his knees and was kissing down Draco’s abdomen. Draco pushed him off and buttoned up his pants, curious but anxious to walk further towards the voice he heard.
Harry’s eyes grew in wonder, the apartment was beautifully decorated, its design pristine and tasteful.
“I can’t do this when you’re this drunk”
“That being said, I think he’ll come around, with the way he looks at you, it must be hard to deny his feelings. But are you sure that that’s what you want?”
The capturing of his parents has been swallowing Draco up whole. He took the rest of the week off of work and wallowed in his misery at the apartment. Harry had tried to cheer him up all week, bringing him a variety of baked goods on a daily basis and attempting to make him watch happy-go-lucky comedies to distract him. Although Draco appreciated the effort, it felt overbearing, as if he was trying to make up for something that wasn’t his fault.
“Is that so?” Draco’s voice boomed, “So you didn’t know about my parents for months? You didn’t deliberately choose to keep that from me even after you saw how heartbroken I was?” Draco yelled out, his eyes now glossy.
They chatted for a few minutes, catching up on their lives since Hogwarts. Luna was dating Neville now, they had gotten together at work a few years after they graduated. Draco updated her on his alchemy work, telling her about his slight auror detour for a year or two.
“I’m Harry, and by the way, that was amazing.”
“We were outside the greenhouses replanting some of Professor Sprout’s Fanged Geraniums,” said Hermione, as usual more collected and logical than Ron. “And Malfoy came over to dump some fresh dungeon dirt off for us. Ron said—of course, he should have left well enough alone, but that doesn’t justify Malfoy’s response—"
taking priority over all the rest. Instead, after selecting a delicate white cup from the cupboard, pouring in the hot water, and setting her tea to steep, Hermione snatched the Draco’s pre-made cranberry-orange juice out of the refrigerator and dumped it into the Gryffindor mug. Pouring in a generous serving of champagne, she brought the drink into the bathroom, where Draco was standing behind the translucent shower curtain as if waiting on a house-elf.
Draco suspected Slughorn didn’t see—or even know—all the ways in which he and Granger had refined the potion. Nonetheless, they accepted his congratulations with good grace and went back to adding the last few ingredients.
“Great, that’s even more of an incentive for you to help me then.”
“And if that doesn’t work?”
“What’s done is done, Draco,” Narcissa admonished. “We can only move forward. I hope you’ll be open minded enough to consider my beliefs now.”
Sensing that Harry is done talking Ron grips Harry’s shin and says nothing. It’s a comfortable silence, not an awkward one, and the feeling of Ron’s hand grounds Harry and keeps him from falling into unpleasant memories. Before long, they’re snoring away, having been lulled back to sleep by the early hour and the sobering conversation.
. This was a muggle sport called baseball. The knowledge made no difference to Harry as he stood there late into the evening, considering several different possibilities of how he could learn the game.
“Also, I missed you,” he whispered into Draco’s ear.
“You’re probably not going to believe me, because we both know I’m usually really dense about these things,” said Harry. “But I’m pretty convinced that me being a continued part of the Weasley family is contingent on me accepting this invitation and attending the brunch.”
Harry smirked. “Well, what he
“Potter,” chastised Draco. “You wouldn’t be friends with me if you cared what people think, so stop pretending like you do. What’s this really about?”
Narcissa again met her son’s eyes. “Draco, I know about the Ministry and their Future Promise legislation. I’ve kept up with all the news. I know about how former Death Eaters are being blatantly discriminated against for no reason. And I agree with you – this new world is not one that welcomes you or even tolerates you.”
Finally, the oak wooden door swung open, and Draco walked in astride Hermione Granger. Harry’s jaw dropped in surprise; not only was Draco laughing merrily, he had his outer cloak (which he always drew around him like a shield) casually tossed over his shoulder to reveal his Hogwarts sweater. In a very odd way, it was almost like the old days when Draco would strut around the school and Harry would be drawn to his every motion. Only now, Harry could see the genuine enjoyment on his face, could notice the way confidence was slowly inscribing itself back into Draco’s posture. He’d never seen Malfoy look sexier, honestly.
“I’ll find something to do to amuse myself,” Harry intones, settling down to read Draco’s letter again.
Harry thumped his hands on the table in frustration. “You know very well I can’t do that,” he said, glaring at Ron. “Draco’s a bint when he’s pressured. He’ll say I’m
Malfoy sighed, and Harry expected to a lot more resistance to come from the pointy git who (except for yesterday) had never done a hard day’s work in his life. Oddly enough, though, he conjured up a wheelbarrow and even thought to include a shovel. Harry was doubly surprised when Malfoy thrust the shovel down into the collapsed rubble and dumped a big shovelful into the barrow.
“Harry, you let him think that?!”
“I really think you should.”
He knew Harry would definitely feel a burn without a little more prep, but thought he could make it bearable. Slicking his cock to the point where it looked like he’d already come, Draco lined himself up with Harry’s hole and started pushing in, kissing his lover and reassuring him continually so that he didn’t clench and cause unnecessary pain. Only when he was buried balls-deep in Harry did Draco allow himself to finally feel the pleasure of being encased in such a tight space. Even as pleasure ran through him while he began gently thrusting, Draco preferred bottoming. The one part he did appreciate was getting to show Harry the part of sex he loved so much.
Something was nagging at the front of his mind. He tried to embrace the memory, but it eluded him. Frowning, Harry continued to watch the game –rather, the

“Are you sure?” asked Malfoy hesitantly. “Popular opinion be damned, I don’t actually want to bother you.”

Becky Lou batted her eyelashes at Harry and said, “Speaking of bucking yourself –” while making a lewd gesture.
Without another word, Draco wet his finger again and pushed it into Harry. He gasped in response. It felt weird, but strangely good at the same time. When Draco thrust in again, this time it hit something inside of Harry that made him cry out in pleasure.
“Are you married?” Mrs. Weasley asked pleasantly. Behind her, Draco could see George shaking his head.
destroy Voldemort and save the world.
“We’ll have to see,” smiled Harry. “So, how about that treacle tart?”
Harry sighs. “I’ve got to get these delivered to Draco before he has a conniption. He’s stressed about finances, and I think he was half convinced that my offer was too good to be true.”
He finally gets through to her, because Hermione nods in agreement. “Thanks, Malfoy. That actually helps a lot. Of course we want to be there for Harry, and now at least we have a few tools to do that.”
“Yes,” Draco breathes back. “More, Potter.”
Compliments about his abilities as an Auror were really the only ones Harry allowed himself to accept. He smiled again, a real one this time, and asked for more details.
“Prongs,” I return his greeting, albeit unenthusiastically.
“But we’re not square,” Draco said. “I can never repay you for what you’ve done, Potter. I can never prove myself to you; I can never prove that I’m not the git you grew up with.”
“So we’ll be late,” Harry returned, pouncing on Draco unexpectedly. He shrieked, but his cries quickly gave way to moans as Harry yanked down his pants and started flicking his tongue over Draco’s already-sensitive rim.
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
After a while, he finally stopped pacing and sat down on the settee. It was tempting to close his eyes and slid into oblivion for a few moments (he’d hardly gotten any sleep after their fight the night before) but Draco couldn’t keep himself from reflecting over the conversation they’d just had. Humiliating as it was to admit to Harry Potter that he craved
Though he never expected to meet Malfoy in a gay club, particularly one where the latter was erotically dancing, Harry decides this was enough of a coincidence that they should put the past behind them. Also, it’s a really good excuse to get away from Seamus. He starts to get up from his seat, making movements to push his chair in.
Thinking that would be the end of her, Draco slammed back down onto his mattress and pushed his palms against his eyes. His head would not stop pounding. Sure, it may have been a while since he last had some food, but there was no reason for a damn ache that wouldn’t go away. Actually, Draco couldn’t remember what he’d eaten or the last time he’d eaten.
“I wanted to thank you for everything you’ve done for me,” he blurts out, nervously meeting Malfoy’s eyes. “I don’t know what I was thinking, going to the Club today. It seemed like I was fine, but then in an instance, I wasn’t.”
Chastised, Mikey stepped back into the crowd and with a smile, the ringleader addressed Draco again. “That spell I used the first time? Triggers the target to wet their pants. Good luck living this one down, Malfoy.” He ended the Tickling and Freezing Charms and stepped back. But in true mob mentality, the crowd of Hufflepuffs, Gryffindors, and Ravenclaws continued reveling in the sight of Draco Malfoy suspended in the air by his right ankle, shirt inside out over his face, dripping with urine. It ran down his chest and back in thin, warm lines before falling off of his body to the ground.
“And so they’re trying to come through our bloody window,” Draco said with an air of suspicious dismissal. “Thanks for interrupting our shag, you twats!” he hollered.
But Harry had made it for him. For
Sighing, Potter asked, “Is your ‘Me Time’ soon?”
out of the dreaded Halloween Ball too.
“What changed your mind, then?” Harry asked, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist.
“Uh, mate?” asked Harry, “Did you mean to just do that, or were you actually planning a better way to tell Nate that you, er,
“Is that so?”
“Oh, I wonder why you feel related,” says Ron, rolling his eyes. “You’ve only known both of them since you were eleven years old. No shit you feel like family.”
“No squares or triangles,” announced Malfoy. “What should I make, Potter?” he asked, glancing at Harry.
“Of course, Potter,” Malfoy exclaimed. “Malfoys are not plebeians.”
"Are you going to treat him well?" she demanded.
“Wait,” Draco said. “Are you going to be comfortable with Harry coming out here?”
The rest of the week flew by. In the mornings, Nate demanded the entire team’s presence for at least a three hour practice, and Harry often insisted that Malfoy attend and participate in order to pack as much baseball into the day as possible. Harry worked on moving into the place Cale and Chris had managed to secure during the afternoons, secretly levitating boxes when his teammates weren’t looking. He needed a little rest, after all, because in the evening his entire focus was on teaching Malfoy new baseball skills, concentrating on different topics each night in order to give him a well-rounded overview.
“If you want to be with him,” says Ron, surprisingly perceptive for once, “Then do it. I did think for a while at Hogwarts that you and him would be a good match. You’re both bloody stubborn, for one, and determined, and at times rather arrogant –”
He’d managed to get into a productive headspace before the end of Charms, moving seamlessly through Herbology (though working in the dirt reminded him
The moment just wouldn’t seem to end, so she asked, “Are you hungry? Harry and I made some sandwiches earlier if you want some.” That seemed to be the magic word. Ron released Hermione and followed her inside the house, relief evident in his face. While she couldn’t say that she was
“Not yet.”
“We never,” Nate hissed, “Play sports with the intention of hurting a teammate.” For the first time, Draco could see rage bursting through the seams of his calm persona as his New York accent came out in full force.
“Harry, dear!” exclaimed Mrs. Weasley. She too stepped out onto the stoop, pulling Harry against her bosom in a tight hug. “So good to see you. You do quite look like you could do with a good meal. Why don’t you come inside and have some brunch?”
, Harry lost his temper.
“The New York CFBA is putting together a whole summer league for out of state teams to fully milk the publicity and positive press that comes along with us coaching. Our entire team has to play weekly, and we can only add one more person on our roster: a pitcher that can sub out for any other position in case of an injury.”
“I mean,” said Finnigan loudly, “Everything Weasley said is true, of course. Seems like Malfoy could be taken off his pedestal even more, the right bastard.” Many of the former Gryffindors were glaring at him, along with some Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. Though Draco hoped for Slytherin support, he didn’t think that Pansy and Blaise had yet forgiven him.
“What now, Potter?” he called from across the field.
Now that was insulting. Sure, Draco was practically melting from heat, but that wasn’t apparent from his outer appearance. Unless it was the combination of slicked back blonde hair with porcelain skin? But this man’s family was blonde too…with an unpleasant lurch deep in his stomach, Draco realized that his Dark Mark was fully visible with his sleeves pulled back.
“Let me help you,” Harry endears, gazing eagerly at Draco. “I owe you a debt, anyway.”
. He decided to have mercy and gave Draco the whole finger, lubing it again so that it slid past his muscle smoothly.
“You’re late,” she said, checking her watch.
“That certainly makes things easier.” Draco pounced, kissing Harry again much the same way he’d done the first time, taking care not to clack their teeth together again.
from the last five years onto the table. Even though they were in the library nearly every day, Madam Pince insisted on reshelving the copies when they were through. “So we’ve gone through, what, at least three-quarters of these?”
something that trumped blood: hate and bigotry. After what had happened to her daughter, son-in-law, and husband during the War, Draco could never expect forgiveness, let alone mercy.
Ron’s upper lip was curling. “Hermione would never touch Malfoy.”

“Grab a drink?” Eric asks, gesturing in the direction of the bar. Harry is about to nod yes, but then Seamus appears from the woodwork and claps a hand down on Harry’s shoulder.
“We’ll finalize the details after you’ve made all the arrangements,” Professor McGonagall said. “I wish Mr. Malfoy the fullest of recoveries," she said as she left the Hospital Wing.
Throwing a Weasley-signature Bat-Bogey Hex back at Finnigan, Draco watched with satisfaction as the spell hit and great bats started flying out of his roommate’s nose. But all feelings were erased from Draco’s body as several disabling spells hit him at once, rendering him numb. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see several faculty members at the High Table standing up with wands raised. Apparently, defending himself was forbidden, Draco thought hazily as his mind began to blur.
Ron glares at him. “I still don’t actually like you, wanker.”
“That was fantastic,” he said in Draco’s ear, possessively clutching every inch of Draco he could reach.
. Draco’d made it to, well,
“Blimey, Harry, how about a little patience?” Harry paused with his mouth resting up against the side of glass and waited. “Fine, then. To new opportunities?”
“It’s called a base. And you’re on!” Harry took off for first base without a second glance back at Malfoy, feet pounding into the ground in much the same way they had when he’d been playing pickle on the bases during practice. Malfoy had zero chance at beating him, what with those surfer-boy flip flops he was currently sporting.
“I know it’s going against years’ worth of your father’s hateful rhetoric,” admitted Narcissa, “but are you a good enough man, maybe not even a good enough one, but a desperate enough one, to change your viewpoint on this matter?”
Entering into a dive, Abalona cruised straight to Harry’s bedroom window, rapping on the glass with expert precision and the satisfaction of a job well-done. She looked forward to her usual reward of owl treats as the window began to open.
“Good man,” said Charlie approvingly. “More mashed potatoes? How about some of these delicious looking carrots?”
He can’t get enough of Malfoy’s delicious dishes. By the time dessert rolls around, he’s unable to eat another bite. “Want to take a little walk or something before dessert?”
“We’ve had many conversations, Father,” said Draco evenly.
Irked by the insult, Draco again thought of using magic – with just a flick, he could take out a wheel and then the disgusting muggle might reconsider insulting people he knew nothing about: especially a Pureblood wizard that so happened to be a former Death Eater. He took a deep breath and counted to ten, somehow comprehending that the Ministry would have his ass if he tried anything, even in the middle of nowhere.
“Potter, I meant, will you stand in the batter’s box and try to hit the damn ball while I pitch it?”
“Dreary Lane would be more appropriate,” shudders Ron, settling down next to Hermione. He wanted a front row seat to what was sure to be an intense confrontation with Malfoy.
“There’s always Paris, Milan, even New York,” Draco shrugged. “Where do you want to go? I’m really game for anything, Potter, even Siberia.”
“Yes?” hissed Draco.
they’d been allowed out on the playing field again, and Harry had been in heaven pushing his muscles to the limits with running. Though Quidditch usually fulfilled a need deep within him, Harry couldn’t help but feel a true sense of freedom when he was sprinting around the bases. He still couldn’t believe how fast some of his teammates could get the ball to the bases; Nels, for example, possessed a brutally wicked arm. Harry almost wondered if she would make a decent pitcher while he was diving back to second base. Mike laughed at his panicked breathing before slapping his mitt against Harry’s side anyway after catching the ball.
“Oi, Malfoy!” Potter called as he tucked his phone into his back pocket. “Sorry, mate, but we’re going to have to cut tonight short.”
“Let’s go,” Draco said, decided. He rose to his feet and reached a hand down to Neville, pulling him up and accidentally dislodging a potted moss. Amidst the plant’s howling curses, Draco declared “I have a Saviour to find” before setting off for the greenhouse door, Neville following behind him.
Frowning slightly, Draco resolved to send a quick email to Danny to let him know that Draco had gotten roped into coaching and to ask for appropriate compensation. He also decided that he knew enough about the organization to start on the introduction piece of the grant proposal. Vowing to have a semi-productive afternoon before Potter eagerly filled his mind with a thousand baseball rules and plays, Draco Apparated away after glancing around to confirm that there were no muggles in plain sight.

True to his word, as he started to move, Harry found himself in a deeply pleasurable state where he never knew what was coming next because Draco was varying the depth and speed of his motions. Draco felt exquisite as always, clenched around his cock, but it was very different, not being in control. He decided he liked it, perhaps not every time, but for now it was fantastic.”
Draco had been sitting at the Ministry waiting for Harry for nearly 2 hours, the building was almost entirely cleared out as even the employees had already gone home. He agreed that if Harry wasn’t going to arrive within the next 15 minutes, he was going to simply leave and spend the night at Aarons, if his safety was so important to the Ministry, he wouldn’t be sitting here alone.
At one point they had migrated to the kitchen, determined to create some sort of makeshift snack despite having a desperate lack of groceries. It took them far longer than necessary, laughing fits kept slowing their efficiency down. Draco was laughing so hard his jaw was aching, his stomach contracting as he bent over, grabbing Harry’s shoulder to stabilize himself.
“Oh please, you haven’t seen anything yet” Harry replied smugly, grasping the back of Draco’s neck to pull him into a kiss.
“Ok.”
Initially, he looked at the building in disinterest, seeing it as an annoying part of his job, having to go and investigate the apartment of someone who had made his life at Hogwarts more difficult than it needed to be. Now, he was looking at the burgundy coloured building with awe, unable to fathom that the complex housed a man that he could not get out of his mind.
He decided against pondering on the subject, he was making himself angry once again just thinking about it. He paid off his bill and exited the club, taking the long and worn out path home. The woods were silent and brisk, with only the occasional hoot of an owl or a tree branch breaking. The pine trees crowded his peripheral vision and he breathed in the cool fresh air, his nostrils expanding.
“Look, I think he’s telling the truth Marvin, why don’t we just drop it. Rob and I will go and investigate the apartment a little further and see if it leads us anywhere” Harry stated, avoiding eye contact with Draco at all costs. It was strange seeing him so soon after their semi-civilized conversation last night. But now, in the harsh reality of daylight, everything had quickly returned back to their normal. He had been the auror that was put on Draco’s case, considering it was seen as high profile because of Draco’s parents. Making both of them uncomfortable, but they luckily wouldn’t have to see each other much. After this first interview, the rest of it was in the Ministry’s hands.
June 23
The next morning Draco woke up earlier than usual to slip out of the apartment before Nick could wake up. He hated the sober small talk that came after a night of sex so it was best to avoid it all together. He got dressed in last night's clothes, his head filled with pressure that felt like the onset of a brutal headache. He walked out into the main living space of the apartment, actually taking it in for the first time. There was a mid-century modern style to the place, making Draco question how he could have slept with someone with so little taste. He shakes his head in disapproval as he pours himself a glass of water, searching for a piece of paper to write a brief goodbye on. He wrote a sloppy “Had fun last night xx” on a sticky note before tying up his shoes and stepping out the door.
The door was a simple mahogany wood, relatively unvarnished in comparison to the rest of the space. As Harry unlocked the door, Draco was greeted by a vast space, beautifully decorated with mid-century modern furniture, all green and wood tones. His jaw slightly fell agape as he walked further towards the kitchen. One of dark granite and dark wood cabinets, with glossed silver appliances. Draco loved decadent interior spaces but had never gotten around to properly putting together his. He placed his bags down by the island and took a seat on the couch, which were leather and were so perfectly plump they looked as if no one had ever sat on them.
Harry decided to leave it at that, he figured it slightly inappropriate to ask Draco to move with him when he could hardly admit to him being his boyfriend. Still, it made Harry’s heart flutter at the possibility of it being just them two one day, perfectly serine in the countryside.
Draco pulled away, “We shouldn’t”
“Morning” Harry replied, walking past Draco and back into his room.
Harry rubbed his hands over Draco’s head, keeping the tight pressure around his body as Draco continued to sob. He cried until he felt he had nothing left inside of him, until he was drained. His red, swollen eyes, lifted. He rubbed the palm of his hand into his eyes in an attempt to hide the redness of his face, a feeble attempt considering Harry had already seen it.
“Let’s go, I’m taking you out for lunch.” She said sternly, always very similar to a mother figure.
Another empty head shake. It was because of Harry. And it wasn’t.
“Sure, love.” He responded, placing his hand over Harry’s for a second before beginning to walk out of the bistro. He pushed the door open and walked onto the busy London street, the sun beaming down onto his face.
This was a bit of a longer chapter! Let me know what you think so far <3
“Unfortunately, it is in this exact state that I am able to be the most honest. I can’t be nearly as brave when I’m sober, not to be this honest anyway.” he tried to explain.
“As you know, Aaron and I have been friends for years - and up until recently it had been entirely platonic, I didn’t even know he fancied lads.” Harry proceeded to not say anything.
“Yeah, I do. It’s rather peaceful, isn’t it?”
Draco sat back further in his seat, contemplating. “No.” Aaron’s chest lost some of its stiffness, his shoulders falling slightly.
Just like that the illusion was shattered and Draco was back in the kitchen of a man who didn’t love him.
“Go fuck yourself.” Draco exclaimed cooly, his eyes hurt but eyebrows furrowed in anger. Walking away towards the entrance of the club, leaving Harry out in the cold.
But Harry still couldn’t bring himself to leave.
“Oh cmon, I’m only a little bit late, I doubt a couple minutes took that much out of your precious time.” Harry spoke as he giggled to himself lightly, Draco understood now that no matter what half civil conversations they were able to hold before, living with him would be just like being back at Hogwarts all over again.
“How’s Harry Potter land treating you?” Aaron asked, sitting down on the couch next to Draco.
It didn’t help that the main reason he had called him over was to frantically gush over his recent night with Harry, and the feelings of rejection he felt the morning after. Now, even thinking about it feels like an insult against Aaron.
“No.”
He looked as brilliant as ever, he had a slight scruff, a balance in between having missed a few days shaving while also not too eager to maintain a well kept look. He was wearing a light shirt tucked into a pair of khakis, a belt cinching his waist. His hair had grown out, now a little above his shoulders, his curls unruly in their longer state. Draco caught himself staring.
“Not necessarily, Italy in general.”
Harry fumbled with the keys, struggling to fit them into the lock. As he entered the apartment, the smell of fresh herbs and vegetables filled his nose, he never came home to the scent of homemade food. After having to cook so often for the Dursleys, it became an activity that Harry could rarely take pleasure in. He stepped into the front hallway, taking off his winter coat and placing down his work bag. He walked into the kitchen to Draco humming along to a song through his headphones, eyes closed, and head lightly nodding along to the rhythm. He must’ve not noticed Harry come in as he stayed swaying and cooking with his eyes closed for several seconds. Harry, feeling calmer and happier from the light buzz of the alcohol, came up behind Draco and patted him on the shoulder, laughing as Draco jumped slightly, letting out a yelp. Harry bent over his knees, barely containing his laughter of a startled Malfoy.
No matter what relationship they had, Harry would always be irretrievably in love with him.
Draco couldn’t believe what he was hearing.
They had been on the couch for a while, chatting about mindless topics like Quidditch and what their plans for the rest of the weekend were, both sitting on either ends of the sofa, cuddled into their own corners. Avoiding each other’s bodies in fear of what would happen if they didn’t. Draco was baffled at Harry’s ability to go on with their lives as per usual, their soft bickering returning quickly. It’s not like he expected Harry to suddenly bend down at Draco’s feet, but the nonchalance was making him feel like their hookup really did mean nothing to Harry. That this was something he did often, sleep with his friends then go back to friendly banter the next day.
“Could you pass me one?” Aaron asked, clearing his throat slightly.
Harry called for him from the hall, already dressed and waiting at the front door. He had grabbed a bottle of wine to bring and was tapping his foot impatiently. Draco stepped out of his room, fixing his shirt last minute as he slipped on a pair of shoes, ignoring the feeling of Harry staring at him.
Draco licked up the side of his shaft, impressed by its size. His tongue licked slowly over the tip, groans filling the air. As he was continuing his excruciatingly slow movements, the hand on his head pushed the dick further into Draco’s mouth, hitting the back of his throat, resulting in a slight choke, one that couldn’t be heard over the sound of Nick’s moans. He bobbed his head expertly up and down the length of his cock, using his hand as an extension of his mouth towards the base of the dick, eyes watering slightly from the pressure. Nick pulled his head off of his cock, muttering something like fuck, you’re gonna make me cum in between groans as he lifted Draco off his knees, grabbing his wrist and leading him into the bedroom.
“Hello? Draco? Happy New Year darling!” said a drunken and laughing voice from the other end of the phone, he had missed the soft structure of her voice.
After their initial first date, they became practically inseparable. Joining each other on walks to and from work, spending a few nights at Harry’s apartment then switching to Draco’s. It was an unbound and sexually active version of the first few months they had lived together.
Some wave of courage washed over him as he stared, all of a sudden unable to hold back his urge to be in his presence, to feel the warmth of his body, to hear the clattering of his mundane tasks from the other room. He wanted to be with him now and forever, to feel honoured to be able to experience his life with him. Just being with him was enough, he could live a painful life of seeing him fall in love with another, or of never kissing him again, he would rather that than be destined for a painful life of watching the one he loved slip away.
“What about it?” He asked, returning back to his task after the slight hiatus. Draco didn’t even know how to answer, he didn’t know what he wanted from Harry. They were too dysfunctional to date properly, but their brief attempts at friendship had proven not to be enough.
Harry tried reaching over towards Draco, grabbing his arm or making a connection of some sort but Draco flinched away.
The slick fingers continued to pound into Draco, leaving him a mess, his nails digging into Harry’s arms. He felt the fingers slip out, and watched as Harry slipped on a condom onto his own dick, which was standing stiff. Draco marvelled at its size, already beginning to mentally prepare.
Tonight, however, he was determined to prove his own hypothesis wrong. To show himself that Draco had no hold over him, he could still go around sleeping with whoever and not be compelled to remember their hookup.
“We are sorry that this is happening and we are doing everything we can to save them, but a raid into their main building takes time to plan. We have to choose the right moment.” Marvin spoke, his arms crossed against his chest.
Cadmus nodded at the instruction and apparated from the house. Romilda paced around the living room, analyzing the belongings. Her slow step made its way in our direction, cornering us into a wall. Her face was almost directly aligned with mine, her breath warm on my face. My body stood perfectly still, almost willing my heart to stop in fear of it being heard. Casper’s eyes were shut tight, his attempt to block out the situation. She moved an inch closer, almost grazing the cloak.
“Don’t be like that Malfoy, Hermione invited you personally, you gotta get out of this apartment.” Harry said, his eyes turning a little kinder.
“We should probably go soon as I don’t have any groceries in the house and I’m quite hungry.” Draco said, his stomach grumbling in response.
“Wow. No, I think that covers practically everything.” He replied, still processing the plethora of information that was shot at him.
“Um Harry, this is Aaron, my...my friend.” Draco said, introducing the two.
Perhaps he would take a vacation, it did feel awfully sad to try and go alone, but his need for escapism was immense and he didn’t know how he was supposed to continue on without some sort of hiatus from the troubles of his relatively mundane existence.
“Why don’t you join us?” Draco asked, switching between looking at Harry and back at the pot on the stove, making sure it didn’t burn.
“I don’t think I understand Marvin, why can’t I just stay with a friend. I doubt Potter is the only option.”
“Enough with the attitude, you and I both know you don’t have another option other than staying with me, so I’d rather skip the dramatics.” Harry said sternly, looking into Draco’s eyes for some sort of sign that he agreed with what he was saying. Draco nodded lightly and he let go of his arm.
He excused himself from the bar and went to the entrance to grab his coat, he wasn’t planning on going home yet, unwilling to face the empty guest bedroom that used to be Draco’s. As he stepped out of the warm ambiance of the pub and onto the cold winter street, only lit up by streetlights and the yellow candlelight of romantic restaurants, at which Harry scoffed at.
(See the end of the chapter for
He leaned his head on the door frame, hearing Harry’s sobs from outside of the door. How did he find himself in this situation?
Draco looked over his shoulder as he saw Harry awkwardly change into the clothes that he had given him, he was swallowed by the sweater and the pants were slightly baggy around his waist. The slight height difference in between the two men was showing itself through the fabric.
“You’re impossible.” Draco complained, resting his hand on top of Harry’s.
“Yeah, I remember. I’ll be there.” Harry replied, walking off backwards awkwardly and stumbling into a few racks on the way, before turning around and walking out the door of the shop.
He placed a soft knock on the door that was greeted with silence, he slowly opened the door to see Draco sitting on the bed, facing away from him.
Just as was promised, they sat on the same couch 30 minutes later, Draco with a joint in hand. They decided on stepping out onto the balcony to smoke, each taking turns breathing in the smoke. He remembered how Harry had lit the joint, it was in the early evening and the sun was golden against his skin, highlighting his cheekbones making him look sharp and angular, accentuated by the sucking motion as he pulled at the smoke. The tint of the sun still kept a warm feel to his face, he probably stared at his face for far too long, Harry was probably aware of this but neither of them said anything. They looked out over his balcony as they smoked, watching the sun cascade onto the stone buildings, creating sharp lights and darks in the skyline. Draco would wonder about how many different lives were being lived and how minuscule he felt, watching couples walk hand in hand, dogs wagging their tails as their owners took them on walks.
