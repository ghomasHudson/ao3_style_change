"Ah," Potter nods. Draco sees his smile out of the corner of his eye. "And how on Earth do you make my last name sound like an insult every time you use it?"
"Just gave him a peek," Blaise dismisses. "Anyways, you're in gay heaven. Draco isn't at all bad on the eyes, and come on, we
"Everyone in position, Ron and the subjects will be coming in soon!" Theo speaks over the excited chatter in Professor Slughorn's classroom.
If his plan worked successfully, he'd prove that they were in love with each other. Again, his approaches are rather blunt, and most likely will make things a bit awkward for a while, but it'll show them their feelings.
Soon, he was hearing the most outrageous relationships, but then he noticed all the proof to support them.
Blaise sighs, wistfully. "Oh, it is, but he and Abbott have been eyeing each other too much to be comfortable with, honestly. I don't see a drop of homo in him. Used to," he adds, "but unfortunately not anymore."
Draco shifts in his seat, avoiding eye contact. "How does everyone know we were avoiding each other?" he mutters, darkly.
Blaise continues to stare at the ceiling. "I don't know what I see in him," he says, truthfully, almost sheepishly. Theo grins at him, and he winks.
Harry was growing more and more awkward around Draco, and Draco seemed to be extra impassive when having to talk to Harry. It was more frustrating than when they were
"I'd always thought the sexual tension between you and Longbottom was better, anyway," Theo mutters to him, sifting through his homework.
Draco was still hiccuping and wailing, but Theo got him on his feet, and he could, fortunately, walk, unlike Harry.
" he casts, and Draco seizes up from where his hands were a centimeter away from unzipping Harry's trousers, and he was on his knees.
Abruptly, Theo notices that his two dorm mates have successfully listened to their entire conversation, and the two quickly look away when he acknowledges them.
The eighth year consists of a returning twenty-nine people, but with the addition of other years, Blaise summed it up to at least fifty people, which is gonna be crowded but memorable. Which is all that matters, in Blaise's eyes.
Theo pushes past the two shirtless boys, then past the two gaping interrupters, and flees the scene.
"'Course not." Theo smiles at Malone Rogers who takes the potion, making a dramatic grateful deal about it. "But his little, Gryffindor heart doesn't need to know that. I'll just tell him that I need to save up for my little brother's birthday in a heartfelt manner."
Then Draco's face contorts to something worse. "School? Why would I be worried about school?! He's the current most famous wizard in the world — he'll tell
Harry was debating on what 'romantic' meant to him, and what it might mean to Malfoy — to Theodore it pretty much means one rose on his bed — so when he opened the door to be met with Pansy Parkinson he was more than surprised.
"He's doing fine," Theo clears his throat, and busies himself with his toiletries and bedtime routine supplies. "Told me to tell you that he won't be visiting tonight because he's doing something with Granger."
anyways, next chapter is by FAR my favorite chapter so i can't wait to share that one! hope you enjoyed this one!
They walk into the common room. Pansy's eyes zoom in on something, and not before she glances at Draco, cruelly, does she yell: "Oh,
"Obviously he does, though!" Draco insists through his tears and obnoxious sobbing. "Or he wouldn't be torturing me and my poor heart!"
Surely enough, slowly people start trickling in from the dorms of the eighth year tower. The common room greets more than one seventh or sixth year, and Theo watches in fascination as the crowd thickens. Music plays, snacks are spread, and Theo sees Blaise pass a few Galleons to a group of seventh year girls as they carry in a large crate.
"We're gonna go to the dorm, don't bother coming back for a while," Harry says to Theo, winking, and basically snogs Draco out of the room.
Malfoy turns, quickly, sniffing loudly, and studying his book without really reading. "No, not really."
"I said that I will not be getting up until my head feels like it's back in its seams, and that my existence is erased from the universe," he drawls, flipping onto his back.
"'Mione?" Ron shouts, shocked, as he helps Harry up onto the seat where he and Hermione were arguing.
It moves instantly. It turns and turns in a dizzy manner, and everyone gives a gasp as it slows down to a stop in front of Daphne Greengrass.
Blaise nods, collecting food on his plate. "Mostly Potter, though. The other two just get dragged along."
"Thanks, love," Blaise graces them with a charming smile even in his hungover state, and Ginny snorts.
count of these, so don't try anything!" He grins, eyes sparkling as he slowly charms the vials in the front of the room to the separate tables.
"Oh, he'll hate me. Right when we started getting along like true friends. He'll think I'm a freak, and he'll tell the entire school that I fancy him — "
Potter was the first to look up. He was polishing his wand, slowly stroking it, and he gave a smile that was probably supposed to look genuine but just looked sinister.
Theo's eyes widen, and he quickly pushes Harry back. "Whoa, slow down, there, Mister Centaur. It'll look... suspicious if you come back so quick."
Theo rolls his eyes, grunting at the prospect of yet another class with Potter. Of course, most of the eighth year's classes would be the same, since their group was quite small, but he had one class where Malfoy didn't attend, and he was hoping that it'd be the same for Potter.
"Theo?" Harry arches an eyebrow at Nott's first name. Ron merely shrugs. "And bloody perfect," he rolls his eyes. He sighs. "How did you do it, eh? Make him like you, that is."
Right when Blaise gave the last vial, he and Draco were coming down from the stairs, and Ron and Harry were getting ready to leave.
Weasley's eyes widen a little. Theo often chooses to stay remarkably silent during lessons and dinner, so his joking may be surprising. He just prefers to observe, rather than indulge in the...
Spinning around, his eyes land on a crying, blonde Slytherin. Theo, Anthony forgotten, rushes to aid his friend and roommate.
Abruptly, Hermione and Ron stop laughing, Harry flushes and his expression turns curious, and Blaise just gnaws his lip at the heavy gazes on him: Harry's confused, Hermione's upset, and Ron's amused.
Pansy said there were rumors surrounding Dean Thomas and Tracey Davis, but Theo brushed that idea off. Thomas and Seamus Finnegan have been eye-fucking each other since day one, to be completely honest.
He opens the door, and throws the chocolate to Harry, casually. "One of your fans told me to give that to you."
It'll be the first Christmas his Mother has had without his Father. Something no one talks about is the Death Eater trials. The majority of the returning older Slytherins' parents are in Azkaban or are dead by the Kiss. His mother and he got away. No doubt with the help of the boy next to him.
"We'll throw a better one for Christmas. Student-run," Blaise had promised most of the eighth years, who grinned because it was Blaise Zabini talking, and he was one of the best Slytherins in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There would
Theo sighs. "Okay. I know everyone has already played Spin the Wand before, but Blaise's version is different."
Then talks. "Can't blame you, O' Saviour of ours," Blaise now winks at Harry, "and sorry for startling you, but I couldn't help but hear... Did you
"You're too thin, you can't restrain either — " Hermione ignores his sound of protest " — Pansy, Theo, you two will unfreeze them on my word."
"Well, uh... Thank you for... clearing that up for me," says Draco, studying a portrait where the inhabitant is gone. "I'm glad you're not..."
They rush out of the room, and Draco drags Theo to a secluded corner around the bend. Harry follows, shortly.
Theo glances at Anthony Goldstein, who raises his eyes in curiosity like everyone else in the library, then to Madam Pince. He winces at the look on her face.
"Theo isn't dating anyone. Malfoy and I would've already found out," Harry says, wincing when he felt himself almost say
Never mind that. Now, The Theo Triumph — Potter thought of the terrible name, the imbecile — was in the bin with the rest of Draco's plots to defeat Potter, and Draco doesn't even have a Potter as an ally with him.
"Th-Thank you," the Ravenclaw stutters, but then smiles back. Standing up, Theo notes that the boy is taller than him, and must be around Draco's height.
Pansy immediately looks at Theo. "Who do you think is in worse conditioning: Harry/Draco, Ron/Blaise, or Neville/Hannah?"
He settles in his usual, hidden table that sits next to a window, but is less visible from the other tables. He got here extra early, and Madam Pince appears to still be in the Great Hall. He silently pats him on the back before opening up his homework for Arithmancy.
Theo rolls his eyes before passing the potion. Draco, immediately recognizing the pale blue liquid, swallows it in one gulp.
Behind him, Hermione appears. "Hmm. You weren't lying about the braiding hair part," she muttered to Ron. "Hello, Theo. Hello, Blaise."
Theo bites his tongue. He doesn't like pushy people. His parents were pushy people. Weasley is just trying to be a good friend to Potter, and Theo isn't gonna press him.
Hermione bites her lip. "The same with Ron and Blaise," she leans forward, "I've never seen Blaise so...
He and Potter worked remarkably together. Granger would constantly tease the two of them. Saying they were the best pair she'd ever seen.
Theo groans. "Thanks, Blaise." He swishes his oatmeal around in his bowl for a way of ignoring the set of eyes on him from Draco's seat at the table.
Blaise smirks. "Well, of course, Theodore. And has a remarkably white smile," he flashes his pearly whites.
Harry looks up, his expression joyous. He looks to Theo, who offers an encouraging gesture. He clears his throat. "Yeah, er- I think that one statement meant to..."
Theo doesn't spare them a glance for fear of bursting out in laughter. He looks to the blackboard in the front, absentmindedly tapping his fingers on the desk.
But he instead gets the reply of flesh hitting flesh, another attempt at undressing, and several moans for Draco.
her do anything," Theo corrects. "And she wasn't going to succeed anyway! She obviously didn't read the box!"
"I woke up, nearly naked, in my bed, with a shirtless Ronald Weasley only a meter away from me on the ground," he moans, "and I've no idea what happened."
dorm. When she saw who it was, she pushed the things in his hands and fled — most likely getting ready for Harry.
Theo groans then glares icily at Potter. The latter has the decency to look apologetic and pats him on the back before returning to his respective table.
Theo crawls back to his spot, ignoring the cheers, and watches as Harry tickles a random sixth year — which is a very strange desire — and it goes on from there.
"Because he's a sadistic bastard, and would love to see anyone desperate, even his best friend," he says, offhandedly.
Although large, the armchair still makes their sides touch. Electricity swarms through Draco's body at the touch, and he almost gasps. His nose is filled with a nice, woody smell, and the scent of treacle tart, and one last hint of something so unexplainably
Theo lasts the better of five seconds before dropping his fork (along with his Shepard's Pie) and looks at Draco, flustered.
Hermione walks over as well, gives one glance to him, then scoffs and goes back to her window seat. "What is it
"Why does everyone even care?" Draco asks, slumping in his seat. "And why are you all calling him Harry? I thought he was Potter. He
Draco's gaze falls on the freckled boy, and he shifts, "Nothing much. Just uh... Where are the drinks, Blaise?"
After his talk with McGonagall, he thought he'd drop by the dorm to get his supplies for the library — his solitude. But then he walked in, and... and...
Jeers and growls sound out through the crowd, and Theo elbows Blaise, whispering, "Just finish your thought."
Theo blushes and rolls his eyes. The new couple go over to Slughorn, who was watching them with an endearing look.
"McGonagall is coming in twenty, so hurry the fuck up, the place is a mess." A trouser-less Ginny Weasley grumbles. "And great party last night, Zabini."
That is, until Theo's former best mate and current enemy, Blaise Zabini, broke out into fits of laughter. Soon followed Weasley, and then the whole room broke out. Even Granger was giggling.
Harry finds his two best friends where they usually are on a Saturday morning — arguing about random things in a random corridor. He used to think that it was some sort of foreplay, but now he knows it's just a type of therapy. It reminds them that the war is over and that they can go back to the things were before: constant bickering.
Everyone, even the people closest around him, evolves in conversation. As Hermione and Pansy talk about Potions, Ron and Greg about chicken, and Theo and Blaise about gossip— Potter chuckles, gently, from beside him.
Now, Theo giggles, childishly, and wonders how it's still like that a week later. Even Blaise, who Theo always thought of as the most — despite their sorting — brave boy in his grade, couldn't pick up the nerve to approach Weasley on the matter.
Draco snorts, and Theo watches excitedly as Harry looks up at him, and throws one to him. "You try it!"
It might've been odd to see the stony Slytherin wailing, but everyone knows there's a difference between drunk crying, and
Theo frowns, pushing Draco to arm's length. "Is that what you're worried about? What Harry — and the others — think about you? Your past?"
Theo groans at his unfortunate results of having two dramatic dorm mates and nudges Draco with his knee. "Everything is fine."
"Mister Malfoy, my boy, there's something on your essay, could you come here for a moment?!" he calls.
Blaise bites, harshly, at Theo's neck, and Theo lurches back. Blaise gives a shit-eating grin. "Gotta leave a mark."
Harry let out a low whine. "He said something about wanting to see it, before, and he seemed really interested, so I thought we could just scope out the area."
Theo nods, relieved that someone will be in the room with them. He gives them a farewell, then ventures back to his dorm.
Theo sidles over and starts helping the other eighteen-year-old. When finished, he gives him a warm smile.
Anyways, of course, Pansy came in and tried to help him — mind you, he had picked the exact date in which he was going to tell Potter — and Potter has known for nearly a month, and they've barely been talking.
to know the different types of Muggle berries, Mister Jones!" The loud man cries, chuckling. "Not many
The boy has light brown skin, and his hair glistens in it's wavy, black strands. He has bright hazel eyes, and he carries a great number of books. He wears a long, dark blue robe over seemingly Muggle clothes, and he appears to be in Theo's age, with his eighth-year patch right below his Ravenclaw one.
Theo spins. "By competing with each other to see who can become my friend first? This is barbaric! You two can try what you want, but I'm not breaking. Just leave me alone."
Blaise waited four days after Christmas — rather impatiently, Theo might add — and all of the eighth years who left found a way to get back to Hogwarts.
" Blaise reads, after spinning his wand, eyebrows furrowed. "Okay, which kinky fuck thought this one?"
"Mmm," Blaise trails, thinking about Weasley. Then he shakes his head. "Isn't he a little preoccupied with Granger?"
And as if all of his meaningful words meant nothing, Draco erupted into tears at the mention of Harry.
"Blaise!" she cries, and attention finds its way to her and Draco, as she wanted. "Beautiful execution!" They saunter over, and Theo notices Harry edging away from the group. He wraps a hand around Harry's forearm and pulls him back to the scene. Harry groans, pitifully, but doesn't protest.
The two girls look to each other, then burst out in laughter. Hermione chokes out, "Theo, we've known since the beginning of the year. Even Ron knows."
"Hello, Blaise, Nott," Malfoy gives his trademark smirk in Theo's direction, and Theo has to think back to when it started looking appealing. Blaise greets Malfoy back, and Theo does, too.
"He is rather attractive, isn't he? I do hope he comes back from the shower without a shirt," Blaise comments, absentmindedly.
Even though he knew it wasn't true, even though Blaise knew it wasn't true, even though everyone knew it wasn't fucking true, he repeats this in his head;
Theo has a shit-eating grin on his face, when Ron saunters in, smirking. Ron quickly goes to his usual table with Hermione and now Pansy, and sits back to watch the show.
He grunts before sliding out of bed and casts Tempus. He always woke earlier than the other boys, and this was no different. He glanced at Malfoy's closed-curtain bed, then to Potter's whose curtains were only closed halfway.
Ron moans, pitifully, to himself. "It's just... Well, everyone knows Harry's pretty oblivious, and nothing bad on his part, you know that he just gets clueless sometimes. He's pretty observant, otherwise, I mean he
Theo grins, secretly, to himself. He knows what happened. He actually woke up extra early this morning, and on his way from the showers, he saw Blaise in only his underpants in the middle of the hallway. Theo took to dragging him to his dorm, where he saw the half-naked Weasley sleeping on the ground. He then went forth with his plan.
They all look over to see Theo shoving spoonfuls of food in Blaise's mouth, who was furiously scribbling away on a piece of parchment.
Draco has already kissed Granger sweetly, and had given an awkward lap dance to one Ronald Weasley, and looked relieved to see it was only Theo. He gives a reassuring smile, and Theo gives one back, before landing his lips on his.
"They're not bloody idiots, Laney," Davis snaps. "My parents are locked up, and my current home is a ghost house. Wonder why there's such a large number of Slytherins returning, too, Moon? Because we have
Pansy looks at Granger, eyes devouring. "Would you like to join me on seeing what we could do with Firewhiskey, Hermione?"
Theo slides out his shirt, receiving several wolf whistles and a few heavy gazes. He stares pointedly at the wand as he gives it a good twist.
"It was only a couple of Ravenclaws... Oh, Sallis was definitely there," Ron cringes, looking at him, apologetically. "I'll explain it to Harry if he gives you any trouble."
He heard Parkinson and Goyle call to Malfoy, where she was eyeing Bulstrode with the clear message of
Pansy takes on an innocent expression. "Yes, but MacMillan wanted to sit next to his girlfriend instead of Longbottom. See, it's their one month anniversary."
Hermione clears her throat, and says to Pansy, "Pansy, you're writing is a little unclear on this part, could you maybe..."
Theo walks down the corridor, and Ron follows. "At the speed they were going, they should have read it any minute now. Just wait for the shrieks."
It's only a few moments later when he feels eyes on himself, from the opposite side of the room. He sees Anthony Goldstein staring at him, intently, before flushing when caught.
"You totally did! Like, in third – no... Oh, no way!" Blaise exclaims, jumping up. "You've liked both Potter
"Hi," he breathes, heavily, from having run. "You need to do something about the living arrangement."
"Look at his arms and tell me that his title granted him it. No, the bloke is just hot. Anyways, didn't you used to fancy Potter?" Blaise furrows his eyebrows.
He watches as they both start flushing crimson, and he sees Draco edging his wand out to no doubt erase any evidence on what he smelled, so Theo swiftly switches their parchments and hides a smirk.
Draco gapes at her, but Greg simply pushes past them and settles in next to Ron, who is seated on the ground. Pansy follows shortly.
Loud cheers are shaking the floor, and Greengrass turns green. Harry pushes Ron towards her and cheers the loudest.
"Hello, Mister Potter, Malfoy, and Nott." She had greeted after taking them away from the feast in the Great Hall. They stood in the corridor, staring longingly back to the Hall. "As you know, you came back for a repeating year of your seventh, along with many other students your age, correct?"
But Potter came in and spoke for them. Instead of the Kiss, his Father was sent to rot in Azkaban. Which was worse, he didn't know, and his Father seemed impassive to Potter's presence.
After a series of Potter/Malfoy insults spoken right over their heads during lunch, they were quite wary. Theo was starting to loathe the headmistress with a passion.
Theo wonders why he's so deeply comforting a drunk man. He wonders if he's attempting to comfort himself.
"That still doesn't explain why you encouraged her to get one for him," Draco points out, still looking annoyed.
Draco goes to yell at him again, but Harry cuts him off — "Malfoy, Pince." — which immediately silences him. Theo almost smirks, but a glance at Draco quickly changes his mind.
"Yes, well, that same day Harry found out he was bisexual," Hermione glares to a cowering Blaise, "much to his confusion. Then, again, Pansy Parkinson told Draco that Harry knew he was gay, much to Draco's embarrassment. We assume Draco wanted to tell Harry later on, considering everything they've done to...
Greengrass winces from beside her, and Theo grows quiet. "Tracey..." Millicent Bulstrode whispers, warningly.
"Hermione and I will be going on a stroll on the grounds tonight, as well," Pansy says calmly. "But it won't be
So, sure, Harry wasn't certain about his sexual preferences. But, Harry was certain about something.
Since their new obsession with befriending Theodore Nott began, he accompanied his old rival, Draco Malfoy. They made an agreement, and they stuck to it. They shared thoughts, gave answers, and even wandered their new discovery of Theo's sexuality together (which they, of course, got a healthy hint about from Zabini).
ah, i finally don't update at midnight! and so theo's plan completely failed but he gets an A for effort; also, the last chapter before the epilogue will be posted soon, so keep an eye out! :)
gay. I'm not even being stereotypical, he just doesn't try to hide it," Ron chuckles back, and if anyone notices the use of Malfoy's first name, no one announces it.
Theo sighs then bites harshly into a breakfast sausage. "I don't," he responds, sullenly. Malfoy continues to study him.
Theo attaches the letter to a brown, tawny, school owl, and watches as it flies off. He grins at it.
Then, triumphantly, Potter smirks past his shoulder. Theo drops his hand and looks back to Malfoy, who is stabbing his egg with enough force to move a Hungarian Horntail.
Theo nods in agreement. "I'm going to keep an eye out for those two. Poor Blaise and Ron, though. They're clueless."
McGonagall gives a surprising chuckle. "They're teenage boys. You can't expect anything less of them. I know you're more mature for your age, but understand that those two are born competitors. They enjoy fighting. And I just saw them in a deep conversation without throwing an insult, so I believe this is helping everybody. Now, please excuse me, I have a meeting to attend."
"I'm only joking, Granger," Malfoy smirks, in the attractive way he does it, and Harry can't help but thank the wizarding gods that he was already sitting down, for his knees felt much too weak. "Anyways, Potter, we need to talk."
dorm," Blaise says, but then looks at Harry whose eyes are hyperfocused on something behind him. "Harry, is something wrong?"
Weasley pleads for him to stay with his eyes, but Blaise gives him a murderous look, and Theo passes on a hex from a wizard who's practiced dark magic, thank you very much.
Harry barely glanced at the potion before downing it. He yawns, and looks instantly relieved. "Thanks, Theo. What happened last night?"
So, Theo left Leo, his brother, with his aunt and uncle with the intent of passing his NEWTS, getting a job, and raising Leo in the exact opposite ways of his parents. He'd be accepting, caring, and actually useful.
(When he saw Ginny Weasley, he immediately allowed it, though, because that girl knows how to party.)
Daphne turns a bright red, askew from her usual confident attitude, and loud laughter sounds around the crowd. "What a perfect way to start the game," Ginny groans.
Theo glares, hotly. "Shuddup. I actually thought he was interested in that seventh year — Georgia or Gikle or something like that..."
Theo flushes a deep red. He slowly pulls himself up from his library seat to face a terrifying Draco Malfoy and a sick-looking Harry Potter.
"Draco and Greg are hidden away with Pansy in her dorm. And the Gryffindors took mine," he grins, cheekily. "Wonder what Ron is going to wear. Hopefully that tight, navy blue shirt he has."
"Will it always be a dare if it lands on you?" Neville Longbottom asks, from his place next to Hannah Abbott.
Potter rolls his eyes, but neither of his best friends miss the way he smiles softly at the blonde's back.
There are two people that aren't completely crazed about what happened that night. Theo suspects, strongly, that it's because they know what they did, and they don't regret it.
"And I'm sure they're elated about that," Ginny adds, at which Hermione glares at her for, and Ron laughs in a rowdy tone.
As they continue to annoy Malfoy, Theo's inner Hufflepuff urges him to stop it. "Okay, lay off it, guys," he says, and Malfoy looks, gratefully, at him. "His own secrets aren't hurting anybody."
Draco growls, "You bastard!" He flies away from Ron's hands to Theo, but Pansy quickly casts the Confundus Charm as well.
They greet each other like they're at an important gala. Neither will be attending one, anytime soon. Theo momentarily wonders if Blaise is trying to pretend that that's what this is.
Blaise snorts, and looking over, a pout is present. "I wonder what 'something' is," he mocks, smirking at Weasley's flush that travels, once again.
comments, kudos, and bookmarks completely brighten my day, so thanks if you did any of them! there's only the epilogue left! :)
"Not to mention Harry's and Ginevra's," a voice calls, and Pansy Parkinson appears from behind another bookshelf. She leans elegantly against Hermione's chair. "I was eavesdropping, too, sue me."
Theo groans, pitifully, before speaking, reassuringly, "I'm sure Harry could grow to like you, Draco. Even romantically." He slowly tries to pry Draco off him, but Draco clings to him.
He hears Joan Laney and Liliana Moon, and gapes. Laney was a known, reckless but quiet Slytherin, and Moon was a sweet Hufflepuff, but he distinctly remembers Laney wearing a pretty, little yellow flower behind her ear which didn't fit her character at all.
"Now, no questions! After smelling the potion, write down what you smelt on a piece of parchment and exchange it with your table partners. The vials will be out in a second, and I have a
Comes the drawl that Theodore Nott surely should've been used to, but alas, even after sharing a dorm with him for over seven years, he still cringed at Draco Malfoy's low, aristocratic voice.
"Oh, please, Ronald. We've known Harry long enough to know when he's actually in harm and when he's just being dramatic," Hermione rolls her eyes.
"Must be for Potions," Hermione frowns. "Honestly, Ron, you should encourage him to get these things done sooner. Parkinson and Greengrass
Draco nods, quickly, and lets out a sigh. Whether disappointed or relieved, he doesn't know and doesn't think he wants to. For his own damn sanity.
Theo stifles his laughter, as Ron flushes, going to spin the wand. It turns and turns before landing on Parvati Patil. She proceeded to having her hair sniffed, then she landed on Tracey Davis, a Slytherin, who received the first truth.
Longbottom sends him another pointed look. "First move? Me? Thanks for the vote of confidence, mate, but that won't work."
Theo nodded. "Yes, of course. He's just kind of worried that nothing will go back to the same, and you know how he is — so awkward, he'll never be able to start a conversation."
"Now, that's settled!" Slughorn exclaims. "Now, we'll be in groups of three like the tables are in now. Firstly, we'll be trying them, then you'll all make the opposite potion to smell the difference, despite — Oh, Mister Malfoy,
As they walk over to the girl's dormitories, he looks to Longbottom who still beams at Hannah while walking. "Uh, hey, Longbottom, how are you?"
He let his eyes settle on Potter's bed. They scan over the boy, appreciatively. His shirt rode a tad, displaying a sliver of tan, smooth skin covering obvious muscles. How did Potter even pack...
"He wants them together more than we do, Granger," Malone Rogers jumps into his seat next to Elizabeth Tonn, who greets him with a kiss.
The classroom silences, watching the events unfold. Theo mentally groans, and sends a meaningful look to Hermione.
Groaning, Theo drags his body to his dorm. He opens the door and promptly ignores the two enemies waiting for him.
"Really? Hmm. Thought I was one of the few," he trails, looking back at Ron, who hasn't looked away.
"Ah, damn me to the deepest of hell. How did I mess up so crucially? I'm an idiot, almost as much as the moron I fancy. Oh, no, this is terrible. Will Theo tell him — "
Draco knows that Potter isn't homophobic — he and Blaise have hit it off, spectacularly, and Theodore is gay, and Draco is ninety-nine point nine percent sure that both the Weasel and Granger are at least bisexual, too, but —
Abruptly, Draco leaves the classroom, parchment still clutched in his hand. Theo looks at Harry. "Well? Are you going to go after him?"
Theo's eyes roam over the large circle. Nearly the entire eighth year is participating in the highly anticipated Spin the Wand game, and a lot of the braver younger years join in, as well. The other people at the party linger around, watching instead of playing.
Theo rolls his eyes and glances at his clothes. His grey shirt and tight, Muggle, denim jeans that Blaise bought him look nice. He doesn't look too shabby, though he's never considered himself very attractive.
"He's asleep," Theo says, reassuringly, but then frowns. "That, or he's wanking, but either way, he won't hear you."
Theo debates, silently, as to which dorm mate to carry up first, but with his eyes landing on Harry — who is decorated with adoring people, and a couple looking, lustfully — he decides. Harry will not be molested tonight under Theo's watch.
Hermione studies Theo. Then looks to Blaise, then finally Ron. "Think it has to do with Code Silver?"
The Ravenclaw suddenly catches eyes with Theo, and his books tumble to the ground. Theo arches and eyebrow, and, flushed, the boy leans down to pick up all of the volumes.
Blaise frowns. "Potter doesn't work that way. He'd forgive you, hell, even Draco, if you guys tried. And anyway I was talking about how he'd be happy to have the opportunity of fucking. He'll think with his dick."
you," He shakes his head, index finger and thumb pinching the bridge of his nose. "I just happened to have a...
' after Draco left? Was he meaning it as a compliment? Like, 'fucking hell, that Draco really is something. I like him so much'. Or did he mean it like, 'fucking hell, I hate that kid. Why in Merlin's name do I have to talk to him?' Both are very reasonable, and Draco can't know which one is true! Maybe if —
A collective agreement is sounded around, but Theo sees someone — a younger year, presumably — leave the circle, discreetly. Blaise glances at the empty spot, then to Theo, clearly upset, but Theo reassures him with a look.
He feels another body at his side, and a tan chest is in his view. "Really, let me help," Potter whispers.
He rolled off the bed, careful not to let any of the cum hit the comforter and moved to the bathroom to find some tissues, or something. He didn’t know Harry had followed until he found arms circling him from behind and warm kisses being pressed to his neck.
was. If this were a club, he’d drag the man with green eyes into the loo and have his wicked way with him.
“Did you orchestrate this?” he demanded, slightly outraged, watching the hurt build in Harry’s eyes.
The speech was not the most elegant Draco had ever heard, but it was certainly one of the most personal. And it was about him. It made his chest tighten, his stomach warm, and his eyes slightly itchy. He leaned forward and planted a kiss on Harry’s lips.
Draco felt his cock twitch at the words and reached down to grab it. Harry’s hand came up to intervene, stroking Draco’s cock himself and looking at Draco all the while like he was some bloody miracle on Earth.
“Do we have a deal?” Draco asked, realizing too late that that was a question. But then, Harry’s reply had been a question too. Maybe negotiations didn’t count.
With a sigh Draco worked the cock in front of him with vigor. Draco was relieved when the man didn’t reach down to grab his hair or touch him at all. As if that changed the level of intimacy between them somehow. The thought spurred him to suck harder. If he was being too rough the man above him wasn’t letting on. He was moaning occasionally but for the most part he was fairly silent.
Draco came up short at that. That was exactly the problem. Harry was entirely too trusting. Nobody had ever trusted Draco with information as freely as he seemed to.
Draco wanted to wipe the kind grin from Harry’s face. Was he flirting? Draco couldn’t tell but he felt oddly warm - and he was almost certain it wasn’t from the coffee. He sighed. It was far too early in the morning to deal with this mess.
It was 7am and he was due in the office by 8 for an important meeting with a client by 9. He needed to catch the 7:15 Tube to make it. Normally he would have called a car, but his phone had busted the night before thanks to Blaise fucking knocking it off the bar-top four beers in and shattering the screen into a million pieces when it had hit the floor.
Draco came up short at that thought. Maybe he really had planned it. He glanced down at his phone. Still no response. But still, a small voice in the back of Draco’s mind whispered, ‘if he was meeting with publishers, he could be in the meeting with them now
Pansy giggled, letting go of Draco and looking Harry up and down. “Say,” she asked stepping closer, “aren’t you the author who wrote those adventure books?
Green eyes looked at him with mild amusement. “Well, I’m just glad one of us knows what he’s doing.”
“I believe my father’s exact words were "No pansy son of mine is going to ice-skate." Then he turned to my mother and blamed her for the whole affair.”
It wasn’t that Draco was afraid. He'd had plenty of lovers and sexual relationships to feel comfortable with the body of another man pressed up against him. Usually it excited him - or at least excited him enough to cum - but this was entirely different.
Wait - that thought brought Draco up short. “Pansy, I thought those novels were written by Boyd Seeker?”
Draco recognized that it was true. He dropped Harry’s hand abruptly. The other man immediately slipped on the ice. Draco reached out to capture his wrist and pull him back up.
‘Oh sure, Green Eyes would label those dates’ Draco thought, conveniently ignoring the ‘non-date’ part. ‘'What would they talk about?' Draco wondered. Out loud he asked, “So, our coffee shoppe meet-ups are dates?”
Draco’s caffeine deprived brain needed an additional second to process all of Harry’s words, preferring to remain permanently stuck between ‘I told my friends about you’ and ‘I’ve been avoiding you’ as the words reverberated in his mind.
Hours later Draco found himself up on the open rooftop bar of Nimble Grounds. The night air was crisp and clear with a slight breeze that threatened to ruffle his hair as it passed by. The DJ was playing a loud set of the day’s top-40 hits and the atmosphere was lively, with groups of people making their way around the space, visiting various tables with books on display. Glancing around looking for Pansy and Blaise, he spotted them by the bar. Looking down as he made his way over, he watched as the moonlight reflected off the glittering concrete floor under his shoes before he quickly snapped his head back up, chastising himself for looking down. If any reporters or media were to photograph him here it wouldn’t do to be looking so, he shuddered,
Though maybe Harry meant it to have a double meaning. He searched those green eyes for clues but all he could see was mirth and something along the lines of
Draco felt himself melt into the kiss. The feeling of Harry’s hand on his back, soft lips on his, the chasteness of it all - so different from the hard ruthless kisses he sometimes received from his conquests at the clubs. This was all heart and it made Draco’s fucking
Most of the time, if his day started with coffee, Draco was fine. But the day after his last encounter with the green eyes - Harry, he reminded himself - had not started with coffee. Instead it had started with a completely unnecessary meeting run by incompetent fools that lasted far too long, his day going from mildly annoying to down right inexcusable by the end.
“Well, yeah.” Harry looked back at Draco but did not stop walking towards the rental desk. “You can’t expect us to buy skates for two hours of use.”
Harry pulled back. “Lead the way,” he said, holding out his hand to Draco to pull him up off the couch.
He was mentally screaming, literally moaning, and completely lost to the feeling. Harry thrust in and out of him, driving deep inside Draco to stretch him from the inside out.
“I can’t leave you alone for one minute, can I?” the author laughed, and Draco shook his head in bewilderment that Harry was standing
Reaching over to his nightstand, Draco grabbed a bottle of lube. He added a small amount to his hand before slicking Harry’s cock with it, causing the other man to let out a deep moan. Draco used his other hand to play with his hole, stretching himself a moment before slathering more lube there, preparing himself to sit down on Harry’s cock.
Instead, he leaned forward and kissed Harry one more time. “I know,” he said, pulling away, “I’m irresistible.”
Draco wasn’t sure how he felt about the growing dependency, but he didn’t want to let go. He was discovering the trade-offs might be worth the risk.
“Woah, someone’s in a sour mood,” Pansy said with a laugh, “I am going to excuse it because Blaise had one job and clearly he didn’t tell you about the charity event tonight at Nimble Grounds. They’re raising money for the UK branch of the World Literacy Foundation or some such - basically they help kids learn to read-”
By the time the waitress came by and asked if the pair would like dessert, Draco was three glasses of wine and most of his grilled-sea bass down. He had even sampled a bite of Harry’s dish, though he had tried to wait to make sure the other man was completely finished so he would be eating what would essentially become leftovers if not consumed.
“Look, I really am sorry I didn’t tell you about the tour. If I had known it would set us back this much, I would have never- well,” Harry gestured his hand in a dismissive wave, pausing to place their order before turning back to Draco. “Anyway, how have you been? What did I miss around here?”
Harry - had opened the floodgates to a thought pattern Draco thought he’d long buried. It wasn’t that Draco didn’t have feelings - he had
“Draco!” The urgent voice of his secretary hissed through the door. Draco held up a finger to silence her momentarily.
His voice sounded sexy and the dim light made Harry look almost golden. Draco felt like putty under those skilled hands. “Yeah,” he whispered, “I do.”
Draco didn’t know when he’d become a fan of poetry, but Harry’s words certainly seemed to be working their magic on him now.
Draco turned to Harry. Those green eyes looked at him in a combination of anger, victory, and, to Draco’s horror, honor. He felt an uncomfortable feeling build in his stomach at that look, but it was pushed down by his own anger. “What, the fuck, was that?” he asked, voice low and raw, “Did I
Harry closed his eyes, thinking for a moment, and took the green with him. “Okay,” he said opening them back up, “I am going to break the rules of the game and say that question is off limits for now.”
“Don’t answer that,” he said, leaning over and kissing Draco on the side of his mouth, “dessert at your place sounds great.”
He shot Potter a look. He refused to think of him as Harry before he had a steaming hot cup of molten caffeine in his hands.
“Well I just thought, you know,” Harry continued anyway, “Christmas is coming up and there’s going to be outdoor rinks all over town and if this was fun - I mean if we enjoyed it - then you might want to go with me to one of those. In the winter.”
do this. I was concerned about you!” And with that Harry was kissing him, almost harshly and with heavy desperation, pressing them together. He held his hands on the small of Draco's back and pushed him against the desk. Draco felt his cock strain against his trousers.
“Who is he?” Blaise asked Draco bluntly the next time they met in the pub. Draco had only just walked into the pub and already Blaise had picked up on his mood. He’d chosen to say nothing and ignored his friend, which had never solved anything but had bought him a few more moments of peace.
“But, if you want me there-” Harry pulled back, suddenly stopping the kisses, and green eyes looked at him intensely. “Draco, you do not have to handle this alone.”
They stared at each other for a moment, eyes connecting, as Draco debated, still clutching his coffee. “Malfoy,” he finally said, “Draco Malfoy.”
Looking him up and down, Draco took in Harry’s old shoes, his baggy jeans, loose t-shirt, and messy black hair, saving those green eyes for last and realized that he never wanted to go another day without seeing that ridiculously sloppy ensemble, accompanied by those green eyes and heartfelt smile. They were somehow, impossibly, a match on all levels and no matter what Riddle said or what his father wanted, Draco would do nothing to jeopardize what he had found here, in this man, who he knew loved him.
As much as he despised the idea of casual sex in a public loo, he couldn’t deny the fact that his libido had been completely out of control since he’d last seen Harry’s green eyes at Pansy’s bloody charity event. They had taken over his mind, demanding all his attention. He'd repeatedly caught himself wondering about a man he’d cared nothing about.
The thought drove him to kill his second glass of wine. It gave him an excellent excuse to head to the cellar and pick out the next option.
Green eyes looked at him with some measure of surprise. “That might be the most information you’ve ever told me in one go.”
When the shaking subsided some, Harry still lapping at Draco’s dick, Draco reached down and pulled him back up. “We’re not done yet,” he insisted, hopping off the desk and kissing Harry intensely as he lowered his pants to the floor and turned around. “Fuck me,” he commanded abandoning all reason, “I need to feel you, here.”
for me to disappear for a few years into an advanced degree then to walk into the company blind.” He took another sip of wine. “I wanted to go for four years and then get my advanced degree, but my father was insistent I get something at a faster pace and join the board immediately.” Draco looked up at Harry. “I didn’t know if I would get another shot at it at the time, so I opted to earn my bachelors in management and an MBA at the same time.”
Before moving in, Draco took a moment to admire his prize. Harry’s cock stood at attention in front of his face, thick and hot, with beads of precum leaking from the tip. Draco felt something inside him shift as he moved forward to take a broad lick up the shaft, lapping at the salty precum that pooled there, before taking him down to the hilt. Sucking and savoring Harry’s unique flavor, slightly bitter and sweet, not unlike coffee, mixed with a hint of salt. Draco was accustomed to making his club conquests cum quickly, but in this case he found himself wanting to relish the flavor and elongate the moment to continue to feel Harry shudder beneath him.
Draco sighed. ‘How to address that particular topic?’ His past relationships were non-existent to speak of in terms of ‘liking’ - they were more along the lines of closeted quick fucks and random multi-month or year-long escapades that never turned out all that well. His co-chairs and subordinates only pretended to like him for their own advancement. Blaise and Pansy liked him fine, he supposed, but they ran in the same circles of expectation - there were days when they understood him more than they liked him. His own parents didn’t even really like him - unless he was upholding their precious ‘family values,’ it felt like he was no use to them at all.
Draco spread the peanut butter slowly on his bagel before taking a bite, chewing thoughtfully. “And that didn’t count as a question?”
“You are really a good kisser,” Harry said with a smile on his face. He lowered his hand, resting it on the back of Draco's neck.
ones? You gave a speech earlier! I’m Pansy Parkinson.” She held out her hand. “I did a review of your books on my channel. A lot of my followers have read them now. They’re excellent. The magical world you create is just so contained and believable. And I’m in love with Sir Keelan - I ship Lyla and him so hard. But then, I’m kinda hoping you don’t cop out and pair Nola with Whitford and not Blanca- but then your publisher probably controls all that, don’t they? Anyway, if you couldn’t tell, big fan!” She smiled wide.
“Yes, Mother,” he answered, suddenly fighting off the urge to cry, his legs feeling heavy beneath him.
“Potter,” Harry repeated, “it’s my last name. Potter. I thought knowing my surname might put us on a more level playing field. Er- not that exactly, but at least make you feel more comfortable to tell me yours. Or convince you to tell me at least one of your names. I need to call you something, after all. And you probably don’t want me guessing. You’ll end up with a name like Blond Roast, because you’re so hot and, let’s face it, you have no trouble roasting
An hour later, as they lay in bed together, both dirtier and cleaner for the shared shower, tucked into each other’s arms, the thought dawned on Draco that, even if somehow Harry was gone come morning, he’d had the best sex of his life.
Harry had by-passed the lasagna he’d clearly been eyeing on the menu and ordered the osso-bucco instead. “I won’t order something with cheese if you can’t have it,” he’d insisted, “this way you can try some if you want.” Draco wondered if that then extrapolated out to mean he was going to avoid cheese for the rest of his life, or if this
Were Harry anybody else, some nameless, faceless, man in a club, Draco would have said he was hungry for something else. But this was Harry. And from day one this man with his bright green eyes had cast some weird spell over Draco that made him act in ways he never had before.
But one day of being caffeine deprived and having to rely on the burnt coffee in the mTech company kitchen, which was absolute shite, was enough to convince him to return to the shoppe the next day.
“Then when I got to middle school they made everyone enroll in an athletic club. Blaise wanted to try football. I kind of wanted to try gymnastics, but that wasn’t allowed. In the end I followed Blaise into football.” Draco blinked hard. “God, I hate football.”
Draco shook his head, feeling the slight edges of a migraine coming on. He tried to stave it off by taking another sip of his coffee. “Well, now you have my name. Just don’t sell it out to Rumpelstiltskin or some shit, okay?”
“Ugh, listen,” Harry said, his voice sounding as small as Draco had ever heard it. He turned around, “I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry for what happened at the fundraiser-party, er-, thing. I know you don’t need me to fight your battles for you.”
Those shoes stepped over in between Flint’s. Harry held him up by the collar of his shirt. “Leave him the fuck alone. If I ever see you with him again, you’re dead.”
As it happened, Draco had thought of potentially going to a nearby bar, but he was second guessing that option now that he felt slightly buzzed, full, and warm. He looked down at their interconnected hands.
Potter accepts the challenge and looks to Nott. "Look, I know we haven't been properly introduced, and haven't gotten to know each other, but I'm sure we can become friends here."
The two look up at the open pansexual, and Potter blushes a bit, while Malfoy — knowing Blaise — rolls his eyes.
Theo stifles a grin, and Hermione sends him a skeptical glance. "Hey, I just delivered the chocolate! Harry was the one who offered it to Draco, and ended up like... this."
Harry blinks even more before nodding a million times. "I— I will. I will!" Even when he's out the door, you can hear his calls. "Malfoy! Malfoy!
"He's going to the library, so I need you to set up the dorm in a romantic manner," Malfoy informs Harry as they settle in an empty corridor a little ways away from the Hall. "Can you do that?"
" the Gryffindor gushes. Theo blinks, taken aback. Sure, he and the boy didn't hate each other, but they didn't spill intimate secrets, either.
"You speak too little of yourself," Blaise dismisses but looks pleased. He leans in, and instinctively, everyone else does, as well. "Anyways, there's going to be an entire party in here. I can't give more than that, considering we take up a good fifth of the entire year, but it's gonna be good, guys. I've rounded a bunch of material for Christmas."
Theo looks over his shoulder to see a dashing Draco Malfoy in a long, tight-fitting robe. His hair is styled to perfection, as always, and he throws off waves of sexy confidence. Pansy shortly follows in a black, not-so-appropriate dress. Her pale legs seem to go on forever in lacy tights. Greg, the silly boy, comes out last and looks surprisingly handsome in nice robes. He appears nervous and is clinging to Pansy's side. But after Pansy whispers something in his ear, he beams then wanders off.
He stares back, before looking down. "How do you win a staring contest when there's so many pairs of eyes?"
Theo let his gaze fall to Gina Sallis, who sits a few seats away from Goldstein. She whispers fervently to a Hufflepuff while plainly pointing to Harry — who stays oblivious.
Strange, honestly, because after they leave, the East Tower will once again be empty, and eighth years will no longer exist.
Harry stands, abruptly, looking a mixture of embarrassed and angry. "Excuse me." He leaves the room, but not without giving Pansy an "accidental" kick in the ribs on the way out from where she's still rolling.
Draco shakes his head, sheepish but keeping an impassive front. He's been prone to being more expressive, lately. He blames the war.
He's been getting on with Hermione and Ron spectacularly. Hermione enjoys having intellectual conversations with him, and Ron is just so friendly, so they get along fine.
Draco sits in the corner of the room, arms wrapped around a bottle of Firewhiskey, and is mumbling things to himself.
Theo's eyes flicker to Ron, astonished. Ron gives a small shake of his head, and Theo sighs. How does Blaise still believe the two are together?! He thought his best mate was
"Well, at least you're not sharing with Weasley," Blaise says, stretching on his bed. "Honestly, the boy is an oaf."
Even though it was drilled in his mind when he was younger that he would marry a nice, Pureblood wife making little Pureblood babies, Draco Malfoy was not afraid of it.
Malone Rogers and Elizabeth Tonn were among them, and Theo remembers Tonn walking from Potions in a Slytherin green jumper.
"That's still a stupid name, and it doesn't even qualify for this conversation," Ron mumbles, then speaks clearer. "Obviously, 'Mione. Harry's confused and Malfoy probably thinks that he's acting that way because he found out."
Both Ron and Pansy look like they want to say something to help their best friends' future fates, but they stay mute.
"Malfoy. It's just... He's — " Harry groans, and he is quite confused. He has multiple feelings rushing through his veins and penetrating his mind, currently, and he's never been one to enjoy the feeling of vulnerability.
"That's where everything gets a little crazy. Once you spin the wand, words will say what you have to do to who the wand lands on. So, for a barbaric example, I spin the wand and it lands on Greg. Words will appear with what someone wants to do to someone else in the circle. Whether bad or good, I'll have to do it."
"Yeah, sure, whatever. Listen, I got a plan for Harry and Draco." Theo's expression turns childishly excited.
After several minutes, Theo stands, slowly. He eases his hair back into their natural curls, but Blaise swats his hand away, so only one braid remains at the top of his head.
"Draco!" Theo shouts, and Draco, surprised, looks to him. He flushes. "I'm not telling anyone, anything. As you may know, I brought Harry up as well and he said just as interesting things."
"And here comes Choice Number Two, Draco Malfoy. Aren't you elated, Theodore?" Blaise lightly teases, but the reassuring hand on Theo's arm is comforting.
Anyways, it doesn't work like a love potion where the first glance at a person or an enchantment makes the subject fall. Two love — er,
Theo smirks, despite himself. "That's the good part. If you don't do the task, you have to take body shots off of the person you like. Mind you, your desired person can deny the body shots, then you just have to deal with
Theo's eyebrows furrow, and he sits in the chair next to Ron and Harry. "I was eavesdropping, how is that a bad idea?"
"Why in damnation are you always blushing, Weasley?" Theo asks, kind of fondly. He'd like to think they get along.
Malfoy glares, giving him a pretty view of his middle finger, before turning to his book to fake-study again. Blaise gives Theo a look, and Theo sighs, shooting a quick glare to Blaise.
While passing what seems to be Boyle's dormitory, he sees Granger talking to a panicked-looking Parkinson. Curious, he nears, but then Granger slams the door shut after pushing Parkinson in.
The room silenced and watched as Potter slowly dragged his body and chest to the two Slytherins, and settled uncomfortably next to Theo, pointedly ignoring Malfoy and Blaise.
Blaise licks his lips, and the freckle-covered chest turns red, and the two Slytherins watch in amazement as it travels up Weasley's spine, past his neck, and blends the freckles together.
Theo is dumbfounded on how he never noticed him, but he blames it on him not accepting his sexuality till five seconds ago when he first set eyes on this highly attractive boy.
After a moment, Ron pipes up. "Did Blaise spend the night?" Ron quires, trying to look uninterested.
i had always planned to write a chapter dedicated to show the rest of the blaise/ron story but i never got to it. please comment if you think that i should try to pursue that, or if you have anything else to say about the story!!
"I know, right?" Theo's eyes tear up as he clasps a hand over his mouth to stop his snorting noises. "Everyone knows
"You were much more approving," Blaise reads his mind and smiles when Theo raises his eyebrow. "If I told fifth year Draco Malfoy that I was pansexual, he'd sock me out, probably speaking rubbish about pure-blood importance. He, along with Parkinson, Goyle, and the whole school, knows now, but I still prefer you over them. We're just platonically compatible."
"Hi," he says, dumbly, grasping his nightclothes, tightly. He watches as Malfoy rolls his eyes, and Potter looks a tad amused.
"Please, Nott, do not talk to him. The Gryffindor is going to spoil our intelligence with his irritating verbal etiquette," Malfoy says, eyes flickering to Potter.
"It's because of my trustworthy vibes I throw off," Theo said, earning a laugh out of the other boy. "I'm just alluring."
"Oh, no," Theo grins, sinisterly. "I didn't tell them they were in love with each other, no. They simply just led into the trap of reading the box themselves."
"How's your day been, Nott?" Malfoy leans on the table with his elbow and surprisingly looks like he genuinely wants to know.
Harry visibly inhales, sharply. He walks, clumsily, over to his usual table. "Er, Pansy, I– I normally... you know,
"Yeah, there's loads," Hermione continues. "For instance... Ernie Macmillan and Millicent Bulstrode."
There was an encounter that changed Theo's routine up a bit, though. A while ago, Draco had led Theo back to the dorm, only to be met with Harry leaving hurriedly, and then Harry not returning till the next day. Ever since then, they've been working separately.
Hermione flushes a darker red, but nods nonetheless, and follows Pansy. Theo watches, entranced, at how they look together; two extremely clever women emanating beauty and brilliance. They look like the most powerful couple in wizarding history, with Pansy's arm snugly fit around Hermione's waist and Hermione's head tilted in the other woman's space — they look like they have the secret to the universe and you'd have to do the impossible: separate them to get it.
"Yeah, you do, whatever a cornophapic loony is," Ginny says, carelessly. "Anyways, to answer your question, Harry, she's been on little flings with Parkinson, I presume."
The entire class is eighth years. Potions were required after the war, for some reason that Theo doesn't have the care to remember. It's their only class where all twenty-nine eighth years are present.
Potter looks to Theo and opens his mouth to say something, but Weasley cuts him off. "Come on, Harry. Let the bloke get some sleep."
Theo grins as the class swarms Draco and Harry, who thank them for the congratulations. They navigate their way to Theo.
They all burst out in loud laughter, causing all eyes to look at them, and a harsh warning from Madam Pince.
"Okay," Theo smiles at the redhead. "But do you know how to get past him without him seeing you?" Theo halfway jokes.
"As Mister Potter already knows — given that Miss Granger was a large part of it — we are promoting inter-house unity to an extreme for our returning... eighth years, as you will," she continued, "All of the eighth years will be taking residence in the East Tower."
He was rather glad they weren't looking around anymore. As required for the lesson, each and every student in the room were either sniffing the bottles like idiots, are dazedly scribbling down what they smelt. Ivan Crawley was even smiling, fondly, at a flustered Mason Jones.
It wasn’t until later that night that he realized that may have been Harry’s own way of asking him out on a date.
Time slowed down as Draco hit the edge of the rink behind him, the pain sharp down his back. He opened his mouth, ‘fucking hell’ on the tip of his tongue, when suddenly warm arms encircled his waist, Harry’s broad torso pressed against his as the momentum from the crash propelled the other man forward.
“And, anyway, since when did we become friends?” Damn, even Draco could hear the bewilderment coloring his tone.
of emotions - but they were typically of the irritated, frustrated, dissatisfied variety. He’d long ago locked away any of the happy, bright, and kind feelings that left him fuzzy and warm.
Calling on his self control, he ended up ordering a toasted everything bagel instead, which was probably only marginally healthier - certainly less sugar at least. The reality of it was that it was probably anything but as he planned to smother it with peanut butter anyway. Or jelly. Whatever they had that wasn’t cream cheese.
It was naivety, Draco decided later, that convinced him everything was all right. Lucius’ response to the impending collapse had been bribes. The public had never gotten wind of their impending divorce because he had paid off the media to stay silent. A divorce that never happened due to the millions he had paid to Narcissa to stay. For a time, the Malfoy household had seemed poised to recover.
Draco's cheeks dusted pink. 'Well that was unexpected.' He tried to ground himself before responding, "I'm sexy all the time."
It was two days after what Draco was now calling ‘the coffee incident’ in his head. Somehow in the span of 48-hours he’d managed to bag a new client, have Blaise buy him his new phone, and dream about those green eyes staring at him from beneath those ridiculous glasses. And, as the man who possessed those green eyes was standing in front of him again right now, Draco certainly wasn’t going to say a word about
To his own surprise Draco had started to rearrange his morning meetings so there was more time for coffee with those beautiful green eyes which, lately, seemed to be making his days a little brighter. Or maybe it was just the man behind them. Either way, Draco didn’t really want to think too deeply about the reasons behind
Draco didn’t want to think about the fire in his belly that was quickly jumping up into his throat. One thing kept repeating in his mind, ‘Green Eyes was thinking about
, more, Draco hooked his arms under Harry’s and pulled him back up, kissing his lips again with fervor before pulling back, “Bed.” he directed, the word feeling foreign and almost heavy on his tongue.
“Good to meet you.” Harry reached over and somehow balanced all three of the freshly poured pints in his hands. “I would say you can enjoy your beer with us over there, but somehow I feel that wouldn’t be a welcome invitation. So...” He glanced down quickly before looking back up. “I’ll see you around, Draco?”
like I couldn’t handle him? Do you really think I’m a damsel in distress? What, the fuck, are you doing here?”
“Young love,” Harry said, taking a sip of coffee. It wasn’t quite a question but Draco could hear it in his tone.
In an attempt to hide his fraying seams, Draco leaned down and reclaimed Harry’s lips quickly before pulling back and kneeling by the side of the bed, yanking Harry’s boxer-briefs down as he did so.
“She, my ex- that is, she didn’t like this. It devastated her and it created a rift between us. We ended up splitting. We’re still friendly, I suppose, but it’s not the same. She’s married to a nice bloke and has three kids now, and I-” Harry sighed and ran his hand through his hair, which incidentally didn’t seem so messy today. Draco couldn’t help but remember how
Harry sounded angry and hurt now. “And no, I don’t think you’re a damsel in distress - that was just a joke from the other day. I swear. And I’m here because I’m an author. Which begs the question, why are you here?”
Draco found himself melting into the kiss, his legs feeling like jello beneath him as he forced himself to remain standing and wished he had some magical means to teleport them back to his bedroom so he could and skip right to the part where they were pressed together and moving as one. Truly Draco didn’t even know why he cared so much - were this anyone else he would have no problem dragging them into the bathroom stall and locking the door.
“Of course not.” Draco felt his cheeks heat slightly, countering his sarcastic tone. Harry smiled as Draco impulsively reached for Harry’s other wrist and started skating
The two men stared at each other. Like an overpowering tide, Draco thought he would drown in those eyes.
“Well, then,” Draco waved, “get on with it,” encouraging Harry to ask something before taking another bite of his bagel.
Draco frowned slightly at that. “One,” he started in, “you could be lying. About your name, I mean. And two,” he continued, “why do you need to call me something?”
It wasn’t until he left the coffee shoppe that he realized he’d never even taken a sip of his drink.
Harry stood up and downed the last of his coffee before moving over towards Draco and running his hands through his hair, briefly. Draco felt himself lifting up to the touch, he’d been becoming more and more accustomed to it recently.
Draco would have been more than a little shocked by his outburst if, at that exact moment, Harry’s lips hadn’t crashed down upon his own.
Draco moaned into the kiss, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck, coffee cup dangling from his fingertips.
Pansy was speaking, but Draco wasn’t listening. “I have to go,” he told her, ending the call through her protests and immediately searching the internet for the article. He copied the first search result and popped it into a message box.
He drank his first wine glass down to the bottom and refilled it, killing the rest of the bottle in the process. He would have to find another bottle to open down in the wine cellar. Or maybe he’d move onto the harder liquor options. His father had been bringing home a lot of craft brewed meads lately. Draco wasn’t usually one for very sweet drinks, a point Harry had commented on often during their morning coffee breaks, but the fermented honey was very tempting in that moment.
quickly becoming a somebody to Draco. A constant presence in his life who, against all odds, was still there. The person who Draco would fall asleep beside at night and wake up with the next morning, who he got his coffee with, and generally who he started and ended each day next to.
“Ooh feisty - I like it!” the man pressed himself up against Draco as they danced to the music some before the man leaned down and forcefully captured his lips. It didn’t feel great, but Draco let it happen. Let himself be swept up in the sensation of someone kissing his lips.
In response Draco squeezed his arse, an action that spurred Harry to fuck him harder. Then Harry was pressing down on Draco’s shoulders, pushing until he was lying directly on top of his desk. Clearly satisfied with their new position, Harry’s hands returned to grip his hips, pulling him to meet each thrust. Draco was lost to the rhythm as Harry hit that sweet spot inside him repeatedly with a now practiced ease. Harry’s hands were scorching hot where they gripped him, almost painfully tightly, as he thrust in and out, marking Draco’s body and claiming him
Draco fought the urge to hang up on her, enraged. This was bad. Had he been set up? He thought back to Harry’s actions yesterday as he frantically reached out and grabbed the paper from the counter, flipping it open. Sure enough, a full color photo of Harry kissing him in the alley the morning before was staring back at him. Draco felt like he might be sick. Except the picture looked kind of cute, and he looked
Draco already knew this information but suddenly it felt like something new now. Heat pooled in his stomach.
The cheese was surprisingly melty and good for a vegan imitation and the tomatoes in the sauce tasted fresh. The dough was soft and the whole of the pizza had a homemade quality that oddly reminded Draco of Harry - hot and simple by design, but flavorful and complex once he took a bite.
“There’s a part of me that’s always wanted a family. You know - with never having one growing up.” Harry paused here and Draco squirmed, suddenly uncomfortable with the turn in the conversation.
The words barely finished reverberating around the room when the door to his office burst open. Draco, fully expecting to see his father or Riddle before him, was in complete and utter shock when he looked up into expressive green eyes, their intensity burning as they met his. The sound of the door closing shut faded into the background. A hint of mystery flashed over those green eyes before Harry turned away. The sound of the door locking seemed to echo, then the green gaze was back on him.
And it was true. Pansy had become a YouTube fashion influencer at the ripe old age of eleven. It was how the two had met, back before they were a couple.
Draco didn’t even have time to wonder at that thought before Harry was kissing him again, his hands moving to rest on Draco’s hips, as Draco got used to the feeling of the other man inside of him.
Blaise blinked in response but other than that didn’t let on his surprise. “Yeah, I am. And extra exposure of me for the brand is never really a bad thing.”
Who was he to be at Draco’s pub when he had promised a date and never delivered? In fact Harry just fucking disappeared on him. Draco worked not to grit his teeth.
“Narcissa, leave the poor boy alone,” his father quipped at her, “he’s got the entire marketing arm of mTech under his command now.” Lucius turned to look at his son. “I do hope you’re keeping them together over there. Riddle was just saying the other day how there’s been some recent, shall we say,
“We got the gooooods!” he heard Pansy sing behind him into her phone camera, holding up her drink in a move Draco long recognized as her vlog style of recording. “Now to explore, all! We were lucky enough to be invited here by the World Literacy Foundation and their affiliates, who help boost literacy rates here in the UK and around the world - I will put a link in the description down below because, seriously, you all need to go support them! They’re brought in authors from all over for this event too! Jonathan Stroud, Cornelia Funke and Boyd Seeker are all
“Oh my god you do!” Harry laughed. “You totally do. How about this? We try skating today and if we feel like we want this to become a more permanent thing that we do, you can invest in some skates, okay?”
One week passed, then two, then three. Draco slowly stopped being surprised to see Harry every morning at the coffee shoppe and increasingly more nights in his bed. It seemed they were forever finding their balance of dominance and submission between them, and Draco found he had no desire to venture outside their relationship for
“Love you too, Draco,” Pansy said in a mocking tone, cutting in to pull Blaise up and wrap her arm around his waist. “You ready?” she asked them both sweetly.
not.” Harry’s voice was lower now. Almost sexy. Draco found himself suppressing a shudder. “But I’ve made up loads of stories about you. Damsel is only one of many possible roles.”
“I will be.” Harry smiled, completely ignoring Draco’s acidic tone. “I want to be. I’m just - my publisher has me on this deadline. I’ve been working since 5am.”
“Damsel in distress?!” Draco was fighting back full on anger now. Damn this man and his stupid green eyes and glasses. “Who in the world decided I was a fucking damsel in distress?”
“You do realize,” Harry said before he sat, “that if I sit down here that means we’ve progressed to friends.”
He didn’t know why but he’d gone out of his way to pick a place he thought Harry might actually like. And not break his bank account.
“Hey,” Harry said, his voice far gentler then it had any right to be. “All that means is you get another one. Third time’s the charm, right?”
“...are you giving me the silent treatment?” Harry asked, “I might be the first to admit I probably deserve it, but it’s rather childish don’t you think? Plus, you did say ‘excuse me’ earlier so you already broke your vow of silence anyway.” Harry smiled at him.
The thought ripped through Draco’s entire body, sending his head buzzing and his toes aflame. He moved his hand down to unfasten the belt buckle holding up Harry’s jeans, keeping his other hand firmly pressed to Harry’s back until the challenge became too great and he had to employ both of his hands to yank at the
On instinct, Draco bit the inside of his cheek and schooled his features back to neutral. “And now you sound like my mother.”
The question snapped Draco out of his thoughts, as he turned to see green eyes squinting at the menu from behind his glasses.
‘What kind of half-assed coffee shoppe was this?’ Draco would never let that fly if he owned this place.
“Are you laughing at my name?” Draco asked, trying to shove down the jittery feeling in his body. He was almost positive it wasn’t caused by the caffeine. At least not solely.
But until that day, public transit it was. Which he was going to miss if he didn’t get his coffee right now. Why hadn't they completed his order? What was difficult about pouring a cup of their blond roast and adding a splash of soy milk?
“A picnic in the park was romantic,” Harry cheerfully defended, “and you liked it, even if you won’t admit it.”
Draco squeezed tighter and moved faster. His actions earned him the rewards of Harry’s soft moans, which were hot and heavy in his ear, but quiet as to not be heard by the rest of the mTech.
else. Draco sighed and noticed his father listening in with mild interest. Damn his parents for pushing. Maybe if they hadn’t put all their eggs in a single baby basket they could have had a normal child.
Harry gave no reaction to the opulent nature of the building as they rode the elevator up to Draco’s penthouse. He didn’t even make any mention of its proximity to the coffee shoppe. He had only smiled kindly at the doorman who greeted them with his traditional “Welcome back, Mr. Malfoy.” He didn’t comment when Draco let go of his hand to insert a key so the elevator opened directly into his apartment.
Harry leaned back. “Ah, but I have the rest of the day for that. For now I am going to spend my time with this amazing blond roast and enjoy your company.”
“You wanna dance anyway?” the man asked, looking Draco up and down, holding out his hand to pull him up, “What’s your name?”
“Good, because we will be discussing this,” she insisted, “Now for damage control, we will do what is best for you, Draco.”
“Maybe I can find out.” Harry’s voice was hushed and husky in a way Draco had never heard before as he leaned in and kissed him seductively on the lips.
That he would be there in the morning when Draco woke up. That he wanted to stay with Draco regardless of if they ended up sleeping together or not.
Draco hadn’t realized he’d muttered that last bit out loud. To cover his tracks he spat out, “Is that question two, then?”
“So call out of work.” Harry’s eyes shone bright, as if it was the simplest thing in the world. “Even CMO’s need the day off.”
Harry gave him a funny look at that. “Uhhh yeah, okay. Whatever you say, Draco. Your name is safe with me. God, I don’t think I have ever met someone with more trust issues.”
The two boys stumble, then sit on their beds with a sort of curious glance around. Hermione squeaks. "That's not good! That may confuse their
"Oh, you know," Theo says, dismissively. He stands slowly, and a terrible smirk overcomes his face. "Oh, you're
Potter leans against the wall in the alcove, hands buried in pockets, and his head of messy, black hair the only thing visible. He kicks the ground with his shoe, sheepishly.
"Nothing, it's just," Potter stammers, "Ron thought you were interested in him." He seems to measure his words carefully.
"The Hufflepuffs were crying when you didn't pick him up on Saturday breakfasts like you usually do," Greg informs. He momentarily looks like he's confused about why he knows this, before shrugging and settling into his pie.
"She's killing me, Nott. She's so gorgeous, and she doesn't even know it. She keeps on kissing my cheek, but never my lips.
Malfoy looks pained, as he sends Theo a look that is desperately trying to conceal anger. He glances at Potter before speaking. "Yes," he whispers, grudgingly.
"No, I'm comfy." She wears a small smile that the only other person that would notice would probably be Greg. Her eyes are closed. "Go sit next to Harry, he has room."
"Cute," Blaise laughs at the two women, though looks confusedly, at Ron. Theo has to stop himself from banging his head repeatedly against the wall at his best friend's obliviousness.
"That literally sounds like paradise, Theodore," he moans during dinner once. "I'm coming over after dinner. I
"That's your problem. You shouldn't want to break the rules so much," Greg informs her, very helpfully, and biting into a mysterious orange fruit.
Theo's stomach lurches, and he wonders if they were talking about him. "Blaise's," he answers, shortly, but the other two don't miss the unease in his tone.
"To get Draco on his good side again. Mind you," Theo adds, "I hate them chasing me around, but I hate them being awkward with each other even more."
"That you're their friend," she shrugs. "They're two extremely stubborn boys. We've all noticed how you three are on friendly terms now, but they refuse to stop until you tell them who won."
Hermione turns to Theo, arms crossed. Theo's cheeks redden. "Okay, I didn't encourage Sallis to get a
Theo groans as he leans back next Blaise on the boy's bed. He escaped here after a quick scope out of his room to see both boys gone to the showers. He quickly headed here, passing a flustered Weasley.
Theo shifts. "Not too bad. They're not teasing me like they used to, though. And they rarely talk to each other."
"Fine. Only because I'm hungry." Draco dips his teeth into the chocolate, and his eyes catch flames. Harry catches eye contact with him.
Hermione shifts, then set down Ron's old parchments and looked to the Slytherins. "Well, as you know, Harry found out Draco's gay."
"Oh, possibly hell?" He offers. "No? Well, I don't know. Thought you'd know of his whereabouts," he adds, as an afterthought.
(Especially Goldstein, who flushed, impractically, and accepted it with a few mutters of thanks and a cute, small smile.)
Parkinson observes him for a few minutes after that. Harry sits, completely dumbfounded, as Parkinson just studies him — not mockingly, but like she's truly trying to understand him.
Ginny was quick to shut him down. "Whatever, Pig. You're constantly talking about Zabini, can anyone ever catch a break from hearing about his
The Gryffindor gnaws his lip, and barely conceals his hesitant look-around. Students rush around the two former rivals to get to dinner, and Granger is still listening in, raptly.
"Neither of them did, though," insists Theo, expression looking puzzled. "I befriended them at nearly the same time."
It's the night of the party. Considering that this will most likely be the last party in Hogwarts for this particular group of students, most people in the year are hidden away in their dorms, getting ready, swiftly.
"I don't." Blaise shrugs. "But my radar was beeping when he sat next to you earlier, and I think he likes the prospect of sharing a dorm with people other than his best mates."
"Right," agrees Harry, much to his disappointment. He quickly shoulders Ginny for her stupid snickering and swipes up an apple before standing and following Malfoy to the entrance of the Great Hall.
Nonetheless, Theo held his tongue, unlike Potter. "Sorry, professor, but why are you telling us this, now?"
a bit. Although he is still cunningly clever, he doesn't hold all of his old Slytherin traits. Not like Parkinson. She's still
Theo. It was terrible. Theo kept on having to see the two hottest boys in their school in the bare minimum of clothes and was getting excessively flirted on by them, and it was just
Harry flushes. "That's not why–!" His eyes widen, and then he starts walking backward. "I have to go explain to him. Sorry, Theo, I'll meet up with you later."
you about Harry and Draco... Er, I might've slipped something out," he flushes darker, "accidentally, of course!"
Theo sighs. "Draco, no one cares. You were forced, and we understand that. Harry, Ron, Hermione — they all don't care. They went through hell and back in the war, and I'm sure they'd just like to forget. And when you, and I, and Blaise, and Pansy, and Goyle, when we're nice and friendly — it helps them. Harry doesn't think you're neither vile nor disgusting. He sees you as Draco Malfoy — his friend who changed after experiencing a tragic life."
"Well?" He seems to be a mixture of embarrassed and amused as he looks around the room. He sends Theo an unreadable look. "Applaud us."
"Like a wet dream," Theo says, bluntly. Blaise beams at him, Vanishing the mirror and checking the time. "Where are the others, again?"
Theo almost chuckles to himself at the sight of Draco purposely facing away from Harry to block the view of his usually pale face, which is stained deep red.
"We're not any better," Theo murmurs. "His arch enemy, and a random bloke who was on the wrong side of the war."
, reads the white, spidery words that spread above Blaise's wand and in front of Ginny's freckled face.
Theo sighs, then flips on his stomach. Ever since they figured out that he knows about their obvious mutual love for each other they've been avoiding him like the plague. They'd even rather be together than with him. Maybe he shouldn't have been so blunt.
Theo shrugs, avoiding eye contact, sheepishly. "You said some... interesting things last night, but nothing too embarrassing. Just some love... confessions."
he's feeling so much anger, but he is, and he hates it. He also glares at Ron Weasley who has a mixture of emotions on his face, from embarrassment to anger to confusion. Serves him right for desiring Blaise like that right when Anthony spun the wand.
The satisfied smile Parkinson has on her face makes him want to take whatever he said that triggered it, back.
"They were going to figure out sooner or later!" Ron flushes. "It's actually good that you explained it to them how you did."
He keeps his back to them and blindly shuffles through his chest for his books and some parchment to start on his stupid Runes essay.
Theo then bumped into her purposefully on his way back from the library, knowing full well she was heading to
It gets quiet again. Greg snorts at something, but he looks zoned, and Draco doubts that he was even listening to them.
"Anyways, I see Hermione coming down, now. Talk to you later," Neville goes to leave, but then stops. "And uh, thanks. I think I'll go for it. For the first move."
Theodore, being his intellectual self, was the first to catch on. "No," he said automatically but amended at his headmistress' expression. "I mean, professor, they'll kill each other. The idea is insane, so if you plan on carrying it out, please put me in a different dorm."
Harry looks horrified before opting to shove his face in his pillow. "I was drunk, Theo. I didn't mean anything I said."
"Oh, of course not," Theo assures. "If you're lucky, someone just wants to ask the person the wand lands on a question."
He hears silence, then approaching footsteps. There's ruffling and a few grunts next to him before Harry is seemingly pushed down in the seat next to him, his entire body rigid.
Theo groans, then brightens at the sight of Neville Longbottom and Hannah Abbott walking through the eighth year curtain.
But all they wanted was for him to be engaged in the Dark Arts so he can become a little Death Eater like them, then join the Dark Lord's ranks, then have little Death Eater children with some pure-blood wife that was probably a Death Eater, too, but all that got him was a bad reputation and them a life sentence in Azkaban.
"...and then his parrot said, "I like geese!", and then there was a hybrid of two Muggle creatures standing right in my dorm."
Something Theo knows to be significant to all of the returning Slytherins is marks. They need immaculate marks and pretty NEWTS to fix their tarnished, pure-blood names.
Quietly, Hermione snorts, and Blaise — being the only one who heard her — sends her a wink, as well.
Parkinson arches an eyebrow at the aforementioned hand. She lays across Malfoy's bed, arms crossed behind her head, as well as her crossed legs stretched out in front of her, and an absolutely carefree expression decorating her attractive face.
Theo snapped his eyes away, flushed. Shaking his head, he quickly dressed into his robes, and descended to the common room, to wait for Blaise.
Blaise nods and smiles, fondly. "Oh, yeah. Hope he wears it, anyways. And stop messing up your eyebrows."
Theo sighs, running a hand down his face. "That's my fault. I set them up so that when they woke up it looked like they had shagged."
The circle hoots, and Theo groans. He spins the wand for the first time all evening and cringes at the next one.
Theo looks at Anthony Goldstein, who looks at him at the same time. They blush simultaneously, like normal, and then Anthony winks. Theo's insides warm.
Theo was originally scared that the born Slytherin wouldn't fall for his trickiness, but he seemed so anxious about Harry that he fell for it, easily.
McGonagall sent a concerned glance to Theo, before looking to all of them. "I warned you beforehand, considering that Miss Granger shouldn't trouble herself with your reactions if she announced this in the eighth year common room. Please keep this information to yourselves, and do not cause too much of a scene in the East Tower. You are dismissed."
Potter sighs. "Look, Nott. I'm sorry for trying to make you go against Malfoy in some power strike. He just angers me beyond belief, sometimes, and I lost control. We seem to make everything into a competition, even if it might lose the opportunity to gain a friend."
"Okay, everyone, quiet down!" Blaise's voice sounds over the large chatter as he stands next to Theo.
Theo catches on and gapes. "I am not — !" He grows quieter at Pince's glares. "I would not be the bottom."
"If you don't say that these potions were from me then you'll find out," Theo says, cheerfully (and ever a Slytherin), much to Blaise's disdain.
"I thought it'd be better for him to find out himself," Hermione explained one time. "And, of course, he'd give Ron a heart attack with his seductive approaches."
Theo couldn't argue that. With the natural charm that all Zabinis are gifted with, anybody would fall for him.
Hermione flushes, and Theo laughs. Pansy arches an eyebrow with a smirk. "Have you heard what people are saying about you?"
"The incredible increase in inter-house relationships," Hermione finishes for Pansy, who grins at her.
"Nothing more than usual," Weasley mumbles. "And I honestly don't know what he's planning. All I know is that they've come to a... an agreement."
"Must I, Blaise?" Harry groans, yet already settling in between Ron and Hermione. The students all laugh, most beaming at their Saviour. Theo grins when Draco pretend gags jokingly at him.
Ginny snorts, and other people laugh. She edges closer to the wand in the middle of the circle, then gives it a strong spin.
Indeed they were! Theo had opened the door after his shower to be met with the two boys sitting on their beds and calmly talking — which was terrifying enough — and they were motioning to his bed whilst doing so.
"I'm doing fine, Parkinson. How're you?" Harry offers a confident grin, and Parkinson rolls her shoulders.
Streams of light go to his wand, and the word is chorused in unison, and Blaise is seen muttering the spell for the completion of the game.
He admitted to himself that maybe he was a little keen on Cedric Diggory, just a bit, in his fourth year — what with his charms, abilities, and kindness. And he grudgingly reminded himself from time to time about what he thought of Viktor Krum when he first saw him on a broomstick.
"Oh, but blunt is good," Blaise sings, swinging an arm around Theo. "Nice one, Nott. If Draco acts like a prat anytime soon, I've got material for months."
Then a repeat of earlier happens, this time getting them kicked out temporarily — surprisingly, Hermione just smiled.
The groans and people laugh at his misfortune. He doesn't understand why. Harry, Rogers, a Hufflepuff Theo can't remember the name of, and two younger years already have their shirts off, and a few people are nearly naked. Including one Ginny Weasley, who is discreetly rubbing against a shirtless Luna Lovegood, currently.
The three dorm mates erupt in laughter, and Theo smiles, fondly, at them, before taking on a warning expression. "No nonsense in the dorm, boys."
The spins keep on going, and as the circle drank more, the dares became odder. Soon the students who chose to sit out were surrounding the rim of the circle, looking regretfully, to their earlier, sober minds. Among the circle, Harry had already snogged two people, had gotten body shots off him thrice, and had his toes licked by a very flushed sixth year. He kept on drinking to forget each experience. Finally, it landed to Theo, who wasn't nearly as drunk as the other participants and has only had one shot of Ogden's.
That's why when he was first assigned in a dorm with Harry bloody Potter and his old, attractive dormmate, he was very defensive. Even with the modern open-mindedness, straight people still got weird around anyone who wasn't strictly heterosexual.
"Oh!" Theo visibly brightens up. "Yeah, I totally remember that. Ever since then the two have been acting strangely."
"Of course," Blaise scoffs. Then he reevaluates the circle. "Okay, perfect. Theo, would you explain how to play?"
"They're being civilized while they're conversing about my doom. I'm avoiding that place as much as I can, love," Theo clarifies.
The others besides Greg and Theo look confused, but Draco quickly stands up. "I'm going to bed. Tomorrow is Friday, and I'm going to be well-rested for that Runes quiz."
? Right, Pansy there... Perfect. Blaise next to — always flawless, love. And Turpin if you could — nice! Exactly what I was thinking! And...
Theo looks flustered — showing himself from a few months ago — but Blaise scoffs at Hermione. "Oh, come off it, Granger. He used to seem all intelligent and nice, but he's always been this perverted, sneaky little fuck. Besides, what can you expect from someone who rooms with Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter?"
"How's it going with Theo and the dorm?" he asks, buttering his toast, messily, to get the thing in his mouth faster.
Theo nods, motioning him to his abandoned table. The other student looks even more flustered but nonetheless follows him. Theo wonders how such an attractive man can be this flustered with everything Theo does.
"Then go!" Theo pushes the boy forward. Harry stumbles but continues to move forward to Draco's pale blonde hair.
Draco glances, his gaze cruel, at Harry, before walking to his bed and pointedly pulling out a textbook.
"I'm only guessing," Theo shrugs, non-committedly. "I mean, you can't blame him. Ever since you found out, you've been so...
Hermione snorts. "They don't think like that, Theo. With those two, when it's a competition, there's a winner, and there's a loser. No in-between."
Seamus Finnegan clears his throat. "Well, Davis, with all due respect, I have to disagree. Crawley and I are getting along just fine."
"Honestly, Ron, how long have you been searching for me? Everyone knows I go to the library at this time,]." Theo looks at a heavily breathing Ron. This must be what Blaise's wet dreams look like. "Never mind that, everything's settled. We had a little chat."
People congratulate Slughorn as well, and Theo blinks at the scene of all of the different house interacting shamelessly together.
They eat mostly, greeting some familiar, younger Slytherins, and some eighth years. Soon Malfoy walks in, at his side is Pansy Parkinson and Gregory Goyle. A little Slytherin, maybe a second year, follows them, grasping Parkinson's robes — which appears to highly annoy her. Theo watches as they sit down a way down from him and Blaise, and wonders when Blaise chose him over them.
"Of course I didn't tell her!" Theo exclaims. "But somehow she already had a vague idea. I've no idea..."
Yes, very, very shirtless, and they were sitting on their beds, shirtless, with bare chests, and strong bodies, and pale skin and tan skin and they looked smooth, and Theo whimpered, quietly.
And they did. Granger had declared that Jones, Longbottom, and Macmillan were to share a dorm, much to the three's relief (considering some of the earlier arrangements), when she saw the next and paled. Nott had groaned, and Blaise looked on to him and Malfoy in confusion until Granger — with a shaky voice — announced their group:
Blaise takes a deep breath, then looks to Theo. "Now, remember: We are the champions of our success."
The others snort and chuckle, and Draco thinks back to a few weeks ago when he and Potter were chasing Theo together.
“Modified his memory, called a cab and sent him on his way. He thinks we had a splendid evening that ended in mutual pleasure,” Harry sighed, “By the time he was gone, Ginny had locked the wards around our room, and she left the next morning.”
Grasping Harry’s hand with one of his own, Draco used the other to undo Harry’s bowtie and top button of his dress robes. “Look at me Harry,” he instructed, “take a couple of deep slow breathes.”
Nodding noncommittally, Peters kept reading. Harry was grateful because it meant that he didn’t notice the way Harry’s hands shook as he reached for his cloak or the way he had to try twice to turn the doorknob.
Keeping his touches light, Harry kept moving his finger across Draco’s jaw and up around the shell of his ear, “Finally,” Harry was practically whispering now, “when you’re anticipating something, your eyes burn whatever you’re looking at. I felt it last night when I was getting you ready to take me.”
"I love you too, Draco Malfoy." And then Harry reached up to pull Draco down in a kiss that not only portrayed the passion they clearly had but also the love they clearly shared.
"I'm not going to tell you what to do Harry, you got to figure this one out on your own mate, but just so you're aware, and I don't know if this is still the case, the last I heard from Miguel, he had a fiancé." With that, Neville turned and walked away leaving Harry to decide what to do.
Harry’s stomach gave a lurch and he clamped his jaw shut, forcing the nausea back down. He realised that Auror Hanson was still talking.“…someone will need to go check on his progress. We’ll need to speak to him as soon as he is able.” She turned, “Auror Potter, are you okay? You’re rather pale.”
Draco closed his eyes and took a breath before opening them again to say, “No, I don’t want to kill him. I’m his partner.”
Auror Hanson pursed her lips, “I asked if you had any insight to share regarding the case you were consulting on with Mr. Abraxous.”
“Wait!” Draco called after him, “Potter, wait!” Jogging to catch up, he grabbed Harry’s shoulder and pulled, forcing Harry to turn around and face him. “I’m sorry, alright?—I shouldn’t have laughed. Truce?” He asked, extending his hand.
Picking up the cracked frames, Harry shoved them back onto his face as he shouldered his way past a group of young witches waiting to enter the Alley through the back entrance. Pulling out his badge, Harry ignored the gapes and gasps from the witches.  “Move, Auror business.” He commanded.
"He doesn't have a new boyfriend mate." Ron was looking at Harry with an mixed expression of confusion and pity.
Pausing what he was doing, Draco still didn’t turn around, but Harry watched as he shifted uncomfortably on his stool.
“I don’t mind,” Harry nudged him with an elbow, “But I wasn’t talking about last night.”Draco glanced up, and raised an eyebrow, not understanding Harry’s meaning.
He stumbled out of bed with every intention of returning once he’d showered and found a suitable potion for his hang-over but as he stepped out of the shower, he remembered that he had several time-sensitive potions for customers that required his attention. By the time he’d finished at his lab and tried to return to Gimmauld Place, he found the wards had locked him out.
Harry raised his eyes, clearly startled out of his train of thought, and registered Draco standing before him.
So here he was, Monday morning, at work, miserable and still slightly hung-over as even his strongest potion hadn’t managed to get ride of all his symptoms.
Taking a sip of his drink, Harry watched with interest as Neville approached the group, having gone to get another drink, only he didn't return alone. Neville was making easy conversation with a man Harry didn't know, but wouldn't be opposed to meeting based on his outward appearance. Just shorter than Neville, the man was clearly not from England—if Harry had to guess, he would guess Spanish. Turns out he wasn't too far off.
Suddenly, facing Harry under the harsh lights of the Ministry, Draco felt himself shrinking back, recalling the feeling the smallness Lucius made him feel mere hours ago. Not looking at Harry but instead at a point over his shoulder, Draco shrugged, “I just wanted to see you I guess.”
"Yes." Looking back at Draco, he could see the ice blue eyes fill with tears as he continued speaking. "Yes, I will raise Scorpius." Harry moved his other had to frame Draco's face, looking straight into his eyes before proceeding, "I will raise Scorpius and do everything in my power to make sure he knows what an amazing person his father was."
It was Harry's turn to wipe away tears that were slowly falling. "We've done a brilliant job making a mess, haven't we?" He said with a shaky laugh.
Using his thumbs to wipe the tears off Harry's cheeks, Draco pulled Harry close again and breathed in the scent that was distinctly Harry before he closed his eyes and closed the distance between them. The kiss lasted only a few seconds but conveyed enough emotions for a lifetime and as they pulled away from each other, Draco felts his chest tighten and his heart stings give a painful tug. Opening his eyes and looking directly into Harry's, Draco could see that much like his own heart, Harry's heart was also breaking. Letting his hands fall away, and re-clenching his hands into fists, Draco turned and started down the stairs.
Miles away, at the Auror training centre, Harry was falling, racing faster and faster towards the bottom. The weight of darkness closing in on him, his mind going blank as he resigned himself to a permanent end. Knowing that the end was coming near, Harry closed his eyes and waited…
Harry’s eyes flashed and he sat up a bit straighter, “So it’s okay to disrespect me, our relationship, that way. So long as I didn’t know?”
Harry rolled his eyes and ran a hand through his hair, “If it was nothing, you wouldn’t have run away.”
Harry watched with interest as Draco's eyes dilated and a moment later, all of his thoughts were scattered as Draco kissed him with such fervor that all it took all of Harry's will power not to moan into the kiss. Instead, Harry allowed Draco's tongue to enter his mouth as he wrapped his arms tightly around the blonde's waist, pulling him closer so that their bodies were flush against each other and the electricity between them was almost tangible.
Leaving Draco alone to ponder her last words, Luna got up and walked over the where Neville was still sitting with the Sword of Gryffindor clutched in his hands. Draco watched her go, rolling her words around in his head. Was it possible that he had come to care for Harry? Draco had always been drawn to Potter but he had always identified that feeling as loathing. But now that Draco thought about it, he could see the logic in Luna's statement. Deciding that he needed to take a walk to clear his head, and also recognizing that it was only a matter of time before somebody else noticed his presence, Draco got up and headed towards the Entrance Hall.
Grinning, Draco angled himself forward, causing the head of his cock to hit Harry's prostate continually. Harry seemingly forgot how to talk and he saw stars every time Draco hit that spot within him. Knowing that he wasn't going to last too much longer, Draco reached down and grabbed Harry's cock in his own hands, pumping it at a pace that matched the speed at which he was pounding into Harry.
Draco could see the light of recognition grow in his eyes and he braced himself for what he knew was coming.
“I just need to know if he’ll be okay.” Harry exhaled, shoulders sagging a bit at the look on the Healers’ faces.
“And it’s the other way around. Ginny didn’t deserve you. Yes you made a mistake, I’m not saying you didn’t but you deserve someone who will accept every part of you, queer or not and from what you’ve told me, she never would.”
Harry, who despite being exhausted beyond belief, wasn't able to fall asleep no matter how hard he tried. He laid in his bed, tossing and turning, finally resigning himself to just laying there. Of course, the moment the door had opened, he was fully alert, gripping his newly repaired wand tightly in his hand.
And with that, Harry turned away and slowly made his way back to the house with the knowledge that love was indeed stronger than death.
"He is up in the Gryffindor Tower, sleeping in his dormitory." Draco looked over at Luna, surprised that she was talking to him. Luna continued, paying no attention to the look on Draco's face. "I know you are wondering where he is. I also know that you feel like you don't belong here, but you do. You care about Harry and he cares about you too."
Harry reached a hand, wanting so badly to touch and feel proof that Draco was alive, but he withdrew his hand, also afraid of disturbing or hurting Draco as he slept. Instead, Harry drew his wand once more and conjured himself a chair at the foot of Draco’s bed. Settling in, Harry resigned himself to watching the slow rise and fall of Draco’s chest, grateful for that small sign of life.
Andromeda was sitting on one of the couches and when Harry entered, she took one look at his face and rose to her feet. Walking quickly over, she gave him one of her rare hugs, holding him tight as Harry broke down once more.
Not wanting to push his luck though, Harry kept his touches light, and even though this was practically virginal compared to their last meeting, the same chemistry grew around them and Harry felt the want growing in his chest.
Harry turned his back on Draco and resumed his slow walk, and Draco watched him for a few seconds, admiring the admittedly spectacular fit of Harry’s dress robes before deciding to follow him. Between Potter and his waiting dance partners, Potter was preferable. Taking a few long strides to catch up, Draco fell into step next to Harry, opting once again try and get a rise out of the clearly subdued man next to him.
Standing there in sitting room, Scorpius held close to him, Harry couldn't help but feel that this was finally what he needed to help him forget the War and he couldn't help but feel that everything was going to be all right. That he was going to be alright.
Harry watched her go, wondering who this person was that could make the impossibly tough Andromeda Tonks look so disheartened. Taking a deep breath, Harry turned back to face the door and slowly turned the knob. Pushing the door ajar just enough so that he could slip through, Harry let the door close behind him with a muted thud. The room Harry found himself in was not what he expected of a room housing a dying person. It was large and airy, the windows open and the pale rays of sunlight providing the only light source in the room. It was almost idyllic, thought Harry, though he quickly became aware of the only sound in the room—a raspy, labored breath coming from a large bed located between two full windows.
Harry pulled Draco towards his chest again, and seeing Draco's confusing, he seized the opportunity to capture Draco's lips in another bruising kiss that sent shock waves through both of them. Draco moaned in the back of his throat as Harry pulled his hair, forcing his head back and allowing Harry's oh so talented tongue to make a thorough exploration of his mouth.
Draco Malfoy was still sitting alone in the Great Hall. Not long after the Dark Lord fell, his parents had apparated back to Malfoy Manor, but Draco refused to go with them. Hogwarts was really the only place he ever felt at home and despite being alone, there was no other place Draco would rather be.
Deciding to call it a night before it got any worse, Harry headed back towards the ally, desperately hoping it was empty.
“Listen to me, whatever Weasley-Ron—” he corrected— “told you is utter crap. You’re not sick or confused, and you’re not in a phase. You said it yourself, you’re bisexual, or queer, or whatever you want to call it, and there is nothing wrong with that. Just like there would be nothing wrong with you being gay or straight.
Making his way out of the bedroom, Draco meandered towards the kitchen. Opening the fridge, he starred at the dismal selection of food, and decided quickly that nothing there was fit for consumption. Pondering his options, Draco looked through the unfamiliar kitchen trying to find a kettle. Locating one that appeared to have never been used, Draco filled its and set it on the stove to boil. Hopefully, Harry would have proper tea if nothing else. Draco was pleased to find some tea leaves and a strainer sitting in a cupboard next to a collection of mismatched mugs.
“Fuck Draco,” Harry groaned as Draco took him in his mouth. “I won’t last long,” He added, shuddering as Draco put his truly talent tongue to work. Draco just moaned in response, and Harry let his eyes slide close, giving himself over to pressure and heat building at the base of his spine.
It was Draco that pulled away first, partially because of a lack of oxygen, but more so, Harry suspected, because to the overwhelming strength of the connection found in that kiss. The unrestrained heat that had built up in Harry's chest was overwhelming, and he knew that staying any longer would make it impossible to let Draco go. So he pulled away, until Draco's arms fell limply from his hips, and his hands could no longer maintain their grip in Draco' hair so he let his arms fall to his sides.
Absentmindedly moving towards the door, Harry wondered if Draco would actually agree to see him. They hadn’t seen each other since the night of the charity ball a couple of week ago, and since then Harry had to admit he’d been more distracted than usual.
Draining the rest of his drink, Harry walked around the table he was leaning on and made his way towards the man, deciding it was time to rescue him from Hermione before she talked the man's ear off.
The face Draco wore in public was a mask- an artificial face he had trained himself to wear, and Harry knew this. He also knew that when he and Draco were alone, Draco took that mask off, letting only Harry see what lay underneath.This relationship between them had developed not long after the incident in the bathroom. Their brief yet disastrous meeting had reminded both boys that life is fragile and therefore should not be spent in hatred. And on this evening, as the sun slowly sank over the horizon and the two boys stood locked in their embrace on top of the Astronomy Tower, the fragility of life became once again apparent. Draco let out a deep sigh before opening his eyes and moving his and Harry's hands off his face. Turning his back on Harry, Draco leaned forward, his arms coming to rest on the railing, his eyes slowly moving to look down to where Dumbledore had fallen just mere nights ago. Earlier that day, with the help of polyjuice potion, Draco had attended the funeral of the beloved Headmaster and had waited inside the grounds of the castle so he could meet with Harry—one last time. Draco did not move as he felt Harry come up beside him, assuming the same pose as Draco. Raising his eyes and turning his head so that he was looking at Harry's profile, he spoke in a soft voice.
Harry was drawn from his reverie and looked up to see a young witch waiting expectantly behind a counter.
Harry waited until he could no longer hear their voices or footsteps before pulling out his wand to deactivate the alarm he was sure they’d placed on the door. Sure enough, the door handle glowed blue for a brief second and with a small click, the door unlocked.
“No, I’m not sure I do.” Harry stood up, the album falling to the floor as he began to pace the length of the room. “Cause it seems to me Draco,” Harry continued, “that you’re sorry you got caught. Not that it happened.”
Narcissa smiled, “You may wish to button your collar higher, or I might suggest a glamour before seeing your father.”
Auror Hanson studied Harry carefully, probably seeing more than Harry wanted her to see. “Very well Auror Potter. There isn’t much we can do here until the site is clean anyways. But,” she added as Harry made to walk away, “I want you to notify me as soon as he is awake and able to answer questions.”
Draco let out a shaky breath, and when he spoke, his voice was horse and tired sounding. "Harry, I don't want,- I know you, -I don't blame you Harry, though it's so easy to. I can really only blame myself. After all, it was my choice—my choice, my heart, my life, my own fault, not yours…" Draco paused, letting out another breath and wiping away some tears. "All those months, I was like a prisoner in my own home. I thought about you, about how you were living on the run, and I was envious. The danger you faced was so abstract compared to having him there all the time; the fear, the danger was so tangible, I hated feeling like a coward. I hate that I still feel like a coward. On those nights I couldn't, or wouldn't sleep, I would think of our time in Hogwarts, it kept me going. I missed you so much."
“Shame indeed.” Draco licked his lips as he watched Harry move in closer, his hands moving to grip Harry’s hips.
Harry forced himself to take a deep breath, shoving down the panic building inside his chest. He took another shaky breath, “Yeah, I just have a bit of a headache,” he said, “Actually, I think I’m going to go get something from medical.”
"Yes he does. I saw them—they disapparated directly off the dance floor where, let me tell you, they weren't doing much dancing." Now it was Harry's turn to look at his friends in confusion.
Draco was in a foul mood when he stumbled out of the floo into Harry’s perpetually messy kitchen, swearing under his breath as he tripped over the fire poker left lying on the hearth.  Not only was he starving because the restaurant his parents had picked had pitiful portion sizes, he was still seething over the argument he and his father had left unfinished.
Draco whipped around and narrowed his eyes as Hermione picked up the book and walked over, placing it down on his worktable.
The kiss started softly, tenderly and Harry felt himself being pulled in deeper and deeper, needing the reassurance of feeling Draco respond in equal part. Their pace was slow, lazy but that just made the connection that much more intense, and Harry revelled in every feeling of Draco moving beneath him.
Draco dropped his quill, and ink splots began spreading across his careful calculations, “Damn it, Harry,” Draco cursed, looking over at his boyfriend with a glare.
“Merry Christmas, mother. I apologize for missing breakfast this morning.” He said as he took a chair opposite her and poured himself a cup of tea from the pot sitting on the tea table.
Draco thought as he slowly opened his eyes, the effort to do so seemed enormous as his brain was still trying to catch up. He stared at Harry, who hadn’t opened his eyes yet and watched as his tongue traced his lips, as if it was trying to memorize the taste and feel of the kiss they’d just shared.
“As you can tell, I find you very distracting.” Harry said, his voice now normal as he moved away from Draco’s back, not bothering to hide his erection.
Draco was shocked at the state of the castle. The place he had called home for six years was in ruins around him and it made his heart ache as he walked through the debris filled halls. Without really meaning to, Draco arrived at the portrait of the Fat Lady, which he happened to know was the entrance to Gryffindor Tower.
Raising his head, Harry met Draco’s bright gaze, “No, I don’t.” He agreed, and finally giving in, he wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist. “Hold on tight.” He instructed.
Pushing himself up against Harry, Draco tangled his hands through Harry's mass of dark hair, pushing Harry back so that he was pressed between Draco and the stone wall behind him. Harry moaned loudly at the sudden pressure change of having Draco pressed into him and he moved his tongue to trace Draco's jawline.
It was question that Harry had been expecting and one he had an answer for, though he did not know how he had arrived at this conclusion.
“Take the next one.” Draco answered as he grabbed Harry’s hands and pinned them against the wall, leaning in to again capture Harry’s lips.
“I don’t believe for one second you left because that kiss meant nothing. If it really meant nothing, if you didn’t feel anything, you would have stayed and made fun of me for being shit at snogging, or something equally stupid.” Harry paused, waiting for Draco to do or say something, but when he didn’t, Harry kept on going. "I think you ran away because the kiss meant more than you ever expected-it scared you. And all those things you said about finding someone who is deserving, you might want to try believing it yourself. After all these years, you still think of yourself as a Death Eater who only deserves punishment, and it’s utter bullshit.”
Harry heard his name again. “Draco, come on.”  He murmured, “I have a portkey to catch.” And he reached out to push Draco away.
Following his gaze, Auror Hanson spoke, “It isn’t pretty is it?” Without waiting for an answer, she continued, “Anyways, I wanted to talk to you because I know you’ve been working with the owner on that international case. A connection between that case and this seems probable given the extent of the damage and early evidence suggests the fire wasn’t accidental. Any theories?”
Reaching out to pull Draco in even tighter, Harry spread his feet, groaning when Draco’s thigh slotted into place between his legs. Content now to just let Draco lead, he let his senses be overcome by the onslaught of Draco’s smell, his touch, his taste.
Even though every fibre of his physical being was telling him to repeat the experience he’d just shared, Draco knew he needed to leave before Harry opened his eyes. Because despite everything he’d just told Harry about how Ginny didn’t deserve him, Draco knew deep down that he too didn’t deserve Harry. So, like the coward he always knew he was, Draco fled, slipping away almost as silently as he’d come.
“One day, mother. One day.” Draco smiled back, thinking for the first time that he might want the same thing.
The tears that had been building up in both of their eyes finally started to fall. Struggling to get his breath under control, Draco broke into a fit of coughing which wracked his entire frame. Harry moved to help Draco sit up straight and supported him until Draco stopped coughing, and laid back, gasping for breath. Harry reached up to wipe the tear off his own face before moving to wipe Draco's tears away, while Draco lay limp, too tried from the last coughing fit to do anything. As Harry continued to stoke his face, Draco looked up into his eyes.
Draco crossed his arms. “Well, I had to skip breakfast this morning otherwise I would have been late for work.”
Healer Banks’ face softened as she turned to look at Harry again, “You know the true identity of the patient?”
. Squaring his shoulders, Draco said simply, “Because you’re a good man who has always tried to give everyone a chance, even if they’re an ex-Death Eater who definitely didn’t deserve one.” Draco paused, and pressing the advantage he sensed developing at his words, he added, “If you still want me to leave after, I will. You have my word.”
"Didn't mean to what?" Draco interrupted, pulling away from Harry. "Didn't mean to win the war? Didn't mean to destroy my family? Didn't mean to make me a social outcast? I can't even come back to Hogwarts, to my own common room without being ostracised because of the war." Draco stopped suddenly and Harry was so tempted to retaliate, angered by the fact that Draco thought so little of him and his intentions, but Harry held his tongue, recognising that Draco was fighting to stay in control. Instead, Harry waited another few moments before speaking again.
Pacing around Draco’s now restored lab, Harry grinned as an idea popped into his mind. Walking over to the table Draco was working at, Harry perched on an empty stool. He leaned on one arm, chin resting in his hand and watched as Draco carefully measured a pile of dried something and input the weight into his equation.
"Hey Hermione, you planning on asking him questions all night?" Grinning at Hermione as she glared up at him, Harry turned and extended his hand to Miguel, "Sorry about her, she likes to talk. I'm Har…"
Draco’s smile grew as he watched Harry war between being upset over being woken up so early and pleased to see Draco still there.
"Oh god, Draco, you're beautiful." Harry gasped as he lowered his mouth to trail hot kisses all over Draco's chest and abdomen. Draco was writhing beneath Harry's ministration, unable to formulate a real answer to Harry's observation outside of a gasping moan.
Opening his eyes again, Draco moved closer to Harry. Propping himself up on one arm, Draco slowly began pealing away the blankets that were tucked tight up under Harry’s chin, smiling as Harry tried to burrow deeper into his pillow even as Draco pulled the blankets away.
Smiling, Harry made his way to the door but stopped just short and watched as Draco sauntered past. If he didn’t know any better, he’d suggest that Draco was dawdling but Malfoys didn’t dawdle. Stepping out into the street, Harry spoke.
Draco sighed heavily as he looked over the Hogwarts grounds from where he stood on the Astronomy Tower. The sun was barely visible over the horizon; the last rays of sunlight ghosting over Draco's face as he stood there thinking. He thought about the last time he was stood there, almost a year ago. The memory brought a smile to Draco's face, and he closed his eyes, welcoming the memory back.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about Potter,” he spat, “I know exactly what I deserve and it’s definitely not you.”
Draco blinked stupidly at Ron, not in the mood to deal with this. “What do you mean? Is he okay?” Draco could see Ron shaking in anger and his confusion grew.
With the owl gone, Draco had only one thing left to do. He walked to the edge of the Astronomy Tower, to the part with no railings, to the part where Dumbledore has stood, and fell. Draco turned around, his back facing out towards the courtyard, his feet precariously close to the edge. As he stood there on the edge, Draco wondered who would find him the next morning; he wondered who would come to his funeral; he wondered if people would think him weak or be glad he was gone. Draco pushed those thoughts from his mind, instead he thought of Harry, his unruly hair, his smile, of Harry saying "I love you", but mostly of Harry's eyes. Draco held Harry in his mind as he let out a deep breath, and stretched his arms out, stabilising himself slightly as he edged slowly backwards. When he finally felt his feet reach the edge, Draco's last thoughts were of Harry, and he smiled before he leaned backwards.
"I love you too Draco." Harry murmured against Draco's temple and then he let himself cry. He cried because Draco would never see his son go off to Hogwarts, because he would never see his son ride a broom or buy his first wand. He cried for Scorpius because he would never truly know the real Draco Malfoy but what made Harry cry most of all was the fact that Draco was gone and he had spent so little time with the man he loved and who loved him.
Harry didn’t respond this time, he eyes already drifting closed again as he fell back into a light sleep, a small smile on his face.
Ron chuckled, “I believe you were just dismissed Harolds,” and as the wizard scampered away, Ron shot a look at Harry and Draco, “Listen mate, why don‘t we head to the pub and you meet us in a few when you’re done here, yeah?”
The words stood out on the parchment, shimmering a little in the light of the full moon. As Harry re-read the words, his heart sank and Harry suddenly felt sick to his stomach. Harry looked down at the note, scrunching his brow and running a hand over his scar, a habit he had developed whenever he was deep in thought. He wondered what Draco meant; granted he had said that he was leaving but he surely didn't mean forever. Draco couldn't be leaving Harry forever; he wasn't ready to lose another person so dear to him.
"Draco, I can't say I'm sorry for defeating Voldemort," Harry paused as Draco cringed at hearing Voldemort's name, "but," Harry continued, "I am sorry for the rest. It was never my intention to cause you pain. Merlin Draco, I thought about you every night when I was on the run. I wondered all the time where you were, what you were doing. Every night I hoped that you stayed safe. I wanted you to be near me so much it hurt, but in my efforts to make sure we could be together, I hurt you so much more than I could realise. I'm sorry, I just…" Harry let his voice die as he saw a change in Draco's demeanour. He had finally lost control and tears were once again sliding slowly down Draco's face.
Despite the near silence of Draco’s approach, he could tell the second Potter became aware of his presence. Draco smirked, stopping a few feet behind the now stationary Auror.
Draco made to interject but Harry just raised his voice louder, “What is so bloody unreasonable about being pissed off at the fact the man I love was on a date with somebody else?”
Harry smiled and leaned in so that his and Draco's foreheads rested against each other's. Reaching up, Harry ran his fingers through Draco's hair; his hands coming to rest at the base of Draco's neck while his thumbs gently stroked his jaw line. "Thinking about what?" Harry asked still smiling.
Stepping closer to Draco, he continued. “We’ll talk more about this—“ he waved his hand vaguely—“when I’m home and you’ve had a change to settle, okay?”
“Damn it!” He swore loudly as his latest potion turned brilliant blue when it was supposed to be dark navy. Vanishing the ruined potion, Draco threw the reference book he was using across the room, wincing slightly at the loud clatter it made as it hit the floor. Draco dropped his head to the table, wondering if he should just close the shop for the day as he was clearly in no shape to brew anything.
The room was noticeably quiet for the next few moments as Harry steadily worked his way through the tray of food, which Draco watched with mixed amusement as he sipped his tea, picking up the occasional piece of fruit to munch on.
Harry met his uncertain gaze and walked slowly forward. Leaning in to whisper in Draco’s ear, he described every exquisite detail of how he would take Draco apart, piece by piece until he could do nothing else but beg. Harry watched as Draco’s eyes slipped close, he jaw slacken and he could feel a shiver run down Draco’s spine as if he remembering exactly what it felt like when Harry pushed into him.
Finally, Harry spoke up. “How about we start with dinner?” He proposed, and noticing Draco’s nervous glance, added, “not anywhere public, obviously. You can come to mine. Why don’t you send me an owl when you’re done with that potion—you can come over and we can talk about your findings. Would that be okay?” He said, chewing his bottom lip.
Blinking into the white light of the reception area at St. Mungo's, Harry walked over to the reception desk and waited.
Harry’s grip tightened on his wand now in his hand, “Why should I let you? Merlin knows you don’t deserve it.”
“Damn it,” Draco signed and with a wave of his wand, the material disappeared from the cauldron. He turned to face Harry.
“What potion were you trying to make?” Harry inquired, forgetting momentarily his purpose of being there.
“I can’t be late Draco,” Harry tried one last time to pull away, but he knew his heart wasn’t really in it and Draco knew it too.
“Harry?” Draco asked tentatively, walking around so he could see Harry’s face. He knew he didn’t hide his concern nearly as well as Hermione had done when she walked into his lab.
“Fuck.” he murmured under his breath. He just kept staring, taking in the glass that still littered the street and the colourful liquids running slowly down the steps. Harry didn’t know how long he stood there but the sound of a smaller explosion broke his reverie and propelled him further.
“And I thought you caused it,” Hermione continued, “But, you are too. And now I want to know what happened.”
Harry pouted and lapsed into his silent watching. Draco turned back to his equations with a focus that Harry found both highly inspiring and annoying. Not to be deterred however, Harry waited until it was clear Draco was fully immersed in his work before carefully and slowly moving his arm across the table, knocking over several jars of dry ingredients and causing one to crash to the floor.
Draco growled, Harry's voice sounded like pure sex and he was asking Draco to fuck him. Nodding his agreement, Draco rolled Harry onto his back and wasted no time in removing Harry's jeans and boxers. Draco stared down in appreciation for Harry's toned and tanned body.
While he waited for Tilley to return, Draco made himself a cup of tea, sighing contentedly as he took his first sip. Wandering over to the table, where the day’s edition of the
“Very good,” Healer Morin said, “We will be in contact Auror Potter.” Together, the two Healers made their way down the hall and out of sight.
It didn't take long for Miguel to suggest they move elsewhere, and once again Harry's willpower was overridden by the red-hot bloody pumping through his veins, fueling his passion. Since the other man didn't know his way around the club, it was Harry who took charge this time, heading towards the back door and the alleyway which was a popular disapparition spot. When they arrived in the alley, he found himself being pushed up against the brick exterior of the club, Miguel even more aggressive now that they were outside.
Draco started a slow rhythm, keeping Harry distracted by kissing him deeply. When Draco pulled back for air, Harry whimpered "Oh god, Draco…ahhh….faster." And when Draco readjusted so that Harry's legs were wrapped around his waist, Draco began a pace that had Harry yelling "Oh god Draco, so good" over and over again.
Approaching the safety barrier put up by the DMLE and Aurors, Harry was just about to reach for his badge when someone called his name.
Draco choked slightly on the tea he’d just sipped and willed the blush he felt creeping up his neck to go away.
“I mean, he doesn’t want to fucking see you,” Ron repeated slowly, “He knows, alright? The game is up so do yourself a favour and never come near him again.”
Sitting in the silence, Harry thought over the emotion roller coaster the night had turned out to be. Contentment from being with his friends turned into lust and desire for a complete stranger, which was replaced by anger and self-deprecation, which finally subsided to leave a deep rooted despaired. Despair over his inability to choose his own life, make his own decisions, to be with who he loved.
“Before you ask, no I will not tell you what Potter wanted, and I want you to hold all incoming communications for the rest of the day. No interruptions.” Draco said as he heard footsteps and someone walking towards him.
Harry shook his head, “She said she didn’t want to waste any more of her time,” Harry sighed again and replaced his glasses, “Can’t really blame her from walking away from a queer, golden boy or not.”
“Reasonable?” Harry finally ceased his pacing and stood facing Draco, “Reasonable? Tell me what’s so unreasonable about expecting parents to respect the choices of their adult son? What is so unreasonable about expecting my boyfriend to stand up for our relationship in public?”
Harry's eyes flashed with anger as he said in a furious voice, "He was a fucking asshole, and if he comes anywhere near me, or either of you, in the future, he will regret that decision until the day he dies." Harry's tone left Ron and Hermione with no desire to press further and so silence again filled the room.
Harry opened both eyes and stared up at his boyfriend incredulously and Draco shrugged. “We both got what we wanted in the end.”
As Draco pushed into him, Harry felt like he was being split open from the inside. A burning pain spread up his spine, and he let out a yell of pain. Draco watched pain flicker across Harry's face as he let Harry get accustom to the feeling of having Draco in him.
Knowing what his friend was most likely thinking, Neville quickly added, "I know you are very capable Harry, but Miguel, while being brilliant, likes to live a fast past life—in all areas of his life." Still sensing confusion from Harry, Neville continued, "Look, I haven't heard from Miguel in a number of years but the last time I met up with him, the combination of alcohol and other substances he consumed should have been lethal."
Both boys stared at each other in complete silence. Draco was still trying to figure out what to do when Harry finally spoke.
Accepting a cup of tea from Ron, Harry didn't say anything but watched as they each took a seat, and  waited for one of them to ask the first question. It was Ron who spoke first, his voice gentle—a tone he generally reserved for victim interviews or hospital visits.
Harry titled his head back, letting it rest against the brick and Draco chased his movements, not wanting to break contact unless absolutely necessary. Harry’s head lolled to the side as Draco shifted his focus to Harry’s neck and jaw, and he groaned again as Draco sucked a mark that Harry knew would leave a bruise. If he still possessed the capacity to worry, he’d be worried about covering up the bruise before the conference. But his ability to care had seemed to disappear as the blood retreated from his brain. Through the fog though, he still managed to recognize his own name being called from the front of the ally.
Draco smiled weakly at Harry, motioning him to come closer. Still in shock, Harry obliged, moving forward and sitting gingerly on the edge of Draco's bed, trying not to disturb the bed too much. Neither man spoke, only stared into the eyes of the other. Harry's mind was racing, thinking back to the letter he had read only hours before. Did Malfoy really mean what he had written? Had he really loved Harry since fourth year? One look into Draco's eyes silenced all of Harry's questions. Yes, Draco really loved him.
Harry rolled his eyes. In fact, he had made a reservation, but Draco wouldn’t believe him even if he said so and besides, that wasn’t the point. The point was that he was
Truthfully, Harry had seen Draco two days ago when they’d had dinner at a little place in Muggle London, but Hanson didn’t need to know that.
The wizard laughed. “As if I’d believe you. Harry Potter would never date a-“ But what exactly Draco was or what Harry would not date was cut off by the sound of laughing voices as a group walked around the corner, stopping at the scene in front of them.
Stopping in front of the mantel, Harry looked up and saw a picture from his birthday last year. Draco, with an arm around his waist, was giving him a kiss on the cheek as he held out his wrist, proudly displaying the bracelet that was Draco's present to him. Reaching into his pocket, Harry pulled the bracelet out, and brought it to his lips, his shoulders shaking as tears fell down his face.
What Harry decided to do, however, isn't what ended up happening. Looking back on the incident, Harry would argue it was the man's smile and his accent—both were just to irresistible to say no to. So after a second round of drinks, Harry made the rather impulse decision to ask the man to dance, and let Miguel lead him out onto the floor.
The two friends lapsed into silence, as Harry studied the man making his way back to their table with fresh drinks in hand. Turning his head, he looking at Neville, his eyes almost pleading for direction, but Neville didn't want to intervene.
"How do you know I feel like I don't belong?" Even though Draco was pretty sure what Luna was going to say, he couldn't help but ask.
Draco reached down, taking the hands clasped around his waist in his own, loosening their grip so he could turn around and stare into the green eyes he loved so much. "Just thinking" Draco whispered back.
“I was blindsided. And it didn’t mean anything. You have to know that.” Draco stopped, watching Harry as he processed this, anxiety weighing heavy in his chest as he willed Harry to understand and believe him.
Harry nodded but didn’t dare open his mouth. As soon as he thought he could speak without the risk of vomiting on his boss’ shoe, he spoke up. “If it is okay with you ma’am, I can go wait at St. Mungos. Mr. Abraxous was my contact after all.” He tried to keep the desperation out of his voice.
Out on the dance floor, Harry knew the minute Draco's eyes settled on him. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end, and he shivered. Draco's eyes had always had that effect on him. His dance partner apparently misinterpreted his shiver, as he purred "you like that do you?" in Harry's ear as he continued to grind up against Harry in time to the music.
Draco gave a little shrug and wiped at his eyes with his sleeve, “I haven’t seen my parents in months. I couldn’t just walk out on them.”
Finally, Harry broke his silence, stopping as he did so, “Why are you here Draco?” He sounded tired rather than angry, much to Draco’s disappointment.
By the time Draco opened his eyes, Harry had begun retreating but he suddenly felt himself being jerked roughly by the elbow and pulled into the narrow alley between the portkey office and the shop next door.  He just has time to register the took of utter want on Draco’s face before he found himself being pushed against the wall and snogged quite thoroughly.
Finally pulling his eyes away, Harry faced his boss. “No ma’am,” Harry  shook his head, trying to ignore the guilt worming its way into his thoughts, “The last time Mr. Abraxous and I spoke was about a week, and he had hit another dead end. I can pull my notes from the meeting if you’d like.”
Draco nodded and Harry gave a lopsided grin. “Great!” Leaning in, he brushed his lips over Draco’s forehead, “I’ll wait for your owl then.” And with that, he turned towards the stairs, a noticeable bounce in his step.
Finally, when he could no longer feel his fingers and his chest hurt with the force of trying to take his next breath, Draco stood and considered his options. Obviously, he was going to get off Malfoy property, but he also didn’t really want to go back to his empty flat. Glancing at his watch, he hadn’t realized how late it had gotten. And that made up his mind. Walking out of reach of the Malfoy wards, he didn’t let himself take a glance back as he apparated to Gimmauld Place.
Harry shook his head in frustration. He knew in his heart that he had said goodbye to Draco for the last time, but his head insisted on arguing—not accepting the truth that was staring him in the face. Harry whirled around, suddenly startled by the sound of a door opening and feet shuffling.
As Miguel’s tongue worked its way up his neck, Harry looked around the alley, spotting another man in the corner, who watching them with interest. The presence of this stranger caused Neville's previous warning to flood to mind, and Harry tried to push the shorter man away but Miguel wasn't going to be easily moved. Moving his hands under Harry's t-shirt, Miguel ran his hands over Harry's abs as he went back to Harry's weak spot, murmuring in Harry's ear all the things he wanted to do to Harry and it was a
Draco tried to look nonchalant, but he failed as that was another thing Malfoys did not do. “I thought I would take a lunchtime walk to the new bakery at the end of Alley.”
“We know who you are Auror Potter,” the female Healer said with a small smile, “I am Healer Banks, and this is Healer Morin, and yes. We just finished administering treatment to the—”
"I love you Draco" Harry's voice went directly to Draco's heart, shattering what was left of his resolve. And despite feeling his heart strings slowly give way, Draco kept walking. Across the lower platform, down the spiral staircase, along the corridors and down the marble staircase and through the great front doors—the same root they used to escape after Dumbledore's death. Only this time, once outside the gates of the school, instead of disapparating, Draco stopped. Turning to face the school and sinking to the ground, Draco found himself whispering "I love you too Harry" before succumbing to the well of pain that had built up in his chest.
Closing the front door, he noticed his cloak hanging on the stand, realizing his mother most have sent it over with a house elf. After stopping to wash his face, Draco settled at the kitchen table, waiting for Harry to come home.
The Seventh Year dormitory was a large circular room, with five poster beds around the perimeter. Posters of various quidditch teams and even a few Muggle football teams lined the walls. Draco looked around with interest until his eyes came to rest on the only bed with its curtains drawn. Not sure of what to do next, Draco just stood staring at the red curtains surrounding the bed in which Harry Potter was sleeping.
Draco responded to this by casting a lubrication spell and pushing himself into Harry until he was buried completely before either he or Harry has the chance to change their minds or think about what they were about to do.
“Auror Potter, excellent timing.” Senior Auror Hanson, head of investigations, said, approaching him. “I was just about to send for you. I suppose news of this event has started to spread through the Department?”
"I can't Hermione," Harry pulled his hand away from hers, the despair he’d been feeling since leaving the club causing him to lash out angrily. Harry continued, cutting off both Ron and Hermione's attempts to speak. "You know why I can't talk to him, why I can't get back together with him."
Moving in close again, Draco whispered “Merry Christmas Harry,” as he pressed another short kiss to the edge of Harry’s mouth. Harry made to respond, but before he had the chance, Draco cut him of, “Go back to sleep. It’s still early.”
Harry gave a grunt, still taking in the damage that was infinitely worse up close. From here, Harry could smell the acrid smoke from the fire and mix of potions and raw ingredients Draco kept in the shop.
“You’re not even an Auror, how could you be his partner?” The wizard moved even closer, adding “take your hands out of your pockets, slowly and I better not see a wand.”
"Let me come with you Draco. We'll escape together, forget my training, forget your family name, and forget history and the war. We'll get out together, start a new life. We can do it—together." Harry's voice sounded eager, even to his own ears, and the brief glimmer of hope that he felt had disappeared even before Draco shook his head.
To say that Draco had a bad weekend would be an understatement. He woke on Saturday morning uncomfortable from sleeping in his clothes, hung over from finishing almost the whole bottle of wine, and miserable from finding the bed empty and cold.
Making his way up to portrait hole, Harry wondered how he would get into the common room without a password but he decided not to worry about that. If the gargoyle guarding the Headmaster's office was any indication, he was sure the Fat Lady wouldn't have a problem letting him in. And sure enough, his suspicions were confirmed as he approached the portrait hole, the Fat Lady greeted him with a smile and swung wide open, telling Harry to go on up to the dormitory.
It was silent for a few moments, and then Draco said in a soft voice, “We do better. That is, if you still want…” Draco’s left the words unspoken but he knew that Harry caught their meaning anyways.
Draco had no sooner pulled away when Harry dropped to his knees, claiming Draco’s mouth in a searing kiss as his hands scrambled to undo the fastenings on Draco’s robes.  Harry’s hand worked quickly, and Draco pulled away from the kiss to bite into Harry’s shoulder as he reached his climax.
"Harry, there is another reason I wanted to see you before I died. A reason I could not write in a letter. You probably don't know this but not long after the war, I married a young witch that my parents had selected for me. Astoria was a beautiful women but I never loved her. I married her out of obligation and we spent much of our time fighting and being miserable. The only good thing that came out of our marriage was our son, Scorpius. Astoria did not survive his birth and I have been raising Scorpius since then." Here Draco paused, drawing a deep breath before continuing, "My parents did not accept my refusal to remarry and as a result, I have not seen them since Astoria's funeral. Andromeda has helped when she can but she has Teddy to raise and I did not know who else to ask."
“And when you’re thinking on something you bite the corner of your lip.” Harry traced his fingers across Draco’s lower lip and gave it a tug for emphasis, “You do the same thing when you’re trying to decide if I should fuck you or if you should fuck me.”
Harry didn't know what to say. There were so many things he could say, so many things he wanted to say. He wanted to tell Draco not to go, that he couldn't leave him alone, that he wasn't a coward. He didn't want to promise those things to Draco in hopes that not promising would keep Draco here longer, but in the end, looking into Draco's eyes so full of pain and pleading, Harry promised. He promised to keep on going, to keep on loving, to keep on living. He promised because he still loved Draco, and Harry told him that. He told Draco that he was still in love with him, and he would always love him, no matter what. For the first time in that evening, Draco smiled his old warm smile, though his eyes still displayed the pain he felt as he told Harry that he too was still in love, and that no one would have replace Harry in Draco's heart.
“What does that even mean?” Draco called at her retreating figure, but Hermione didn’t respond, leaving Draco to decide if he was going to follow her advice.
When Draco opened his eyes, he found that night had fallen. He listened for a moment for the sound of students heading to the Astronomy Tower for a late night lesson, but it seemed that classes had ended in preparation of end of year exams. Draco closed his eyes again, thinking of his own years at school—hurrying to finish homework late Sunday night, quidditch games on Saturdays, trash talking the Hufflepuffs—so many good memories marred by the horrors of 6th year. Though 6th year had given him Harry for a brief time, it has also caused him to ultimately lose Harry and so much more that he loved. It was 6th year that had ultimately led him to this night, to the decisions he had made, to the actions he was about to take. Draco opened his eyes yet again, setting his jaw with a certain determination. Reaching into his cloak, Draco pulled out a small roll of parchment. He turned to the owl that had been quietly perched on the railing.
“Actually, I’ll require a full report on your past interactions with Mr. Abraxous, as well as a brief on the case.” She sighed, “It’s probably the best lead we’ve got.”
"Auror training making you soft? Or is the "Savior of the World" trying to find some clever way to rid the world of his second greatest enemy?"
Neither man knew how long they stayed wrapped in each other arms but each was listening to the other. Draco heard the constant beat of Harry's heart and it gave him comfort, while Harry listened in agony as every breath Draco drew was more laboured than the last. At last, Draco raised his head. Using all the energy he had left, Draco brought his lips down on Harry's in a chaste kiss that contained a lifetime of emotion.
Draco moved to sit on the other chair but stopped when Harry glared at him. Raising his hands again, Draco took a step back and then he started.
"Draco, wait!" Harry called after him, stumbling in his hurry to follow the blond. Draco was shocked at hearing his name come from Potter's lips. They had only ever called each other Potter and Malfoy to the other's face. Stopping in his surprise, Draco felt a hand grip his elbow and he let himself be spun around so that he was face to face with the Chosen One.
“Okay,” Harry said in an equally soft voice, “We do better.” Harry tilted his chin up and Draco didn’t need to be asked twice.
“Right,” Draco snorted but didn’t bother looking up from the complicated equation he was working on, “I’d believe you but I’m pretty sure you’ve never made a reservation in your life.”
"Draco, wait!" Harry's called after him in a broken voice that told Draco immediately that Harry was crying. Turning around again, Draco watched as Harry half walked, half ran to where he was by the stairs leading to the lower platform. When he reached Draco, Harry hesitated for only a second before wrapping his arms around Draco's waist and burying his face in the side of Draco's neck. Exhaling slowly, Draco removed his hands from his pockets and moved one around Harry's shoulder, the other to the base of neck, holding him close and not caring about the tears stains Harry would leave on his suit jacket. Eventually, Draco moved both his hands to run them through Harry's untamed black hair. Pulling away from Draco's neck, Harry smiled weakly up at Draco and said in a voice hoarse from crying, "Don't I get one last goodbye kiss?"
Slowly, he made his way to the drawing room, and paused to take a deep breath before walking in. Harry was facing away from him, curled in his favour armchair, an empty glass next to him and what appeared to be a photo album open on his lap.
Walking through the archway, Harry move on autopilot stop until he turned the corner at the end of the Alley and saw for the for the first time what remained of Draco’s store. The sight of the charred frame and collapsed roof stopped Harry in in his tracks.
"Four days ago I was miserable Draco. I never thought I would have a purpose outside of being the Chosen One but now, thanks to you, I have a new purpose, a new role to fulfill in life." Harry paused, drawing a deep breath and exhaling before he continued, "You can rest now Draco. Scorpius will be fine, and so will I. I promise you. I love you Draco."
Draco considered Harry for a moment, “Maybe,” he countered, “but you’ll have to wait until I’m done to find out.”
“Very well Master Draco,” the elf bowed, and then added, “Master Lucius bade Tilley to remind Master Draco that he is expected at the Manor shortly.”
“Good idea.” Harry answered and he and Draco stepped aside to let the group through. “Put the first round on my tab. I won’t be long.” He called as the last of the group stepped through the floo.
Hermione nodded, and reaching out, took Ron’s hand as the pair apparated away to Grimmauld Place and an unpleasant conversation.
“Ron? Ron, are you even listening to me?” Hermione stopped walking and turned to find Ron standing in front of a window, mouth hanging open.  Hermione’s annoyance at being ignored was momentarily displaced by curiosity, “What is it?” she asked, walking to stand next to Ron.
“These are the passwords to Harry’s new wards,” She handed Draco a slip of parchment, “You’re going to clean yourself up, have a proper meal and go over there and talk to him.”
“Mr. Abraxous normally does not meet with clientele. All professional communications are written and delivered through his staff,” the witch replied, “but I’ll see if he is willing to make an exception. May I ask what this is in reference to?”
Harry was silent for a few moments, though Draco noticed his fists clenching and unclenching at his sides.
“I’ll have to make it up to you somehow.” Harry whispered in between kisses as he worked his way up Draco’s neck.
"Hey everybody" Neville raised his voice to get the attention of his friends in the general area, "this is Miguel. He was one of my guides when I was studying in Brazil. He's also a herbologist and he is here doing some research."
"Harry Potter, sir, my name is Sophie, sir. I was sent by my Master sir, to bring you to him sir." The elf squeaked out, looking up at Harry with eyes that reminded Harry distinctly of Dobby.
Laughing again, Draco stood up and offered his hand to Harry, “Well come on then,” he said, pulling him up, “Since we missed our reservation, I guess we’ll have to find something else for you to eat.”
Harry walked into the commons, and the soft chatter quickly died away as all eyes fell on Harry. Used to the feeling of being stared and gawked at after his Hogwarts days, Harry put his head down and walked determinedly until he reached the end of the far table where Ron sat, a copy of the day's Daily Prophet clutched tightly in his grip. Harry sat down opposite Ron and raised an eyebrow and neither said anything until Harry couldn't take the silence anymore.
Narcissa laughed as her son turned bright red despite his best efforts. “I do want to meet this person Draco.”
Taking one look at her friend, Hermione knew Harry’s night hadn’t improved since she and Ron left the club. Motioning for Harry to come in, Hermione called for Ron to put the kettle on, knowing that his was going to be a late night. Harry, knowing this house as well as he knew his own, made his way into the lounge and took a seat on one of the couches, and while he waited for Ron and Hermione to join him.
Harry knew what Ron was asking, and he took a moment to look down and collect his thoughts before looking up and answering Ron's question. "I just knew. I could feel it." Harry paused, swallowing thickly, before adding, "He said goodbye."
Draco thought for a moment before answering. “I am attempting to modify a blood replenishing potion to better suit the needs of one of my clients. It is proving more difficult than anticipated.” He added with a grimace.
Harry waited tensely to hear any sound indicating who else was in the room but he heard none. No footsteps, no creaking bed frames, not even the sound of a house elf cleaning up his dishes. Just complete silence. Finally, Harry got tired of waiting and sat up, slowly drawing the curtains back on his bed, his wand pointing in the direction of the door, ready to curse the first thing that moved. But when Harry finally opened his curtain all the way, he was greeted by an exhausted and confused Draco Malfoy staring at him.
“Draco, wait.” For the first time in their argument, Harry sounded tired, and when Draco turned around to face him again, Harry had taken off his glasses and was rubbing at his eyes.
In two short strides, he reached harry and walked straight into Harry’s open arms. He didn’t let go for a very long time.
“Harry?” He called out as he set down the bag of take-out on the table. “Harry?”  Draco wandered through the empty halls of Grimmauld Place, becoming more concerned as Harry remained noticeably absent. Returning to the kitchen, Draco grabbed some floo powder and called out for Ron and Hermione’s flat, poking his head into the fire and waiting for one of them to answer.
“Good.” Harry leaned in and brushed a kiss on Draco’s lips. And even though it was brief, Draco felt warmth flow through his chest for the first time since he’d left the Manor, but all to soon, it was gone as Harry pulled away, brushing past him as he walked to the floo.
"I, um, I just wanted…oh, never mind." Draco suddenly turned on his heel and started walking out of the dormitory before Harry had a chance to process anything.
Draco was left speechless and before he could respond with more question, he was pushed back, almost falling over with the force of Ron closing the floo connection. He sat on the floor for a minute longer before getting to his feet. Grabbing more floo powder, he tried Ron and Hermione’s again, but he knew instantly he wasn’t getting through their wards as he spun around before being deposited back at Grimmauld’s kitchen.
Setting the tray down carefully at the foot of the bed, Draco sat down on the edge of the bed. Picking up a piece of bacon, he moved it slowly in front of Harry’s face.
“Fuck,” Draco mumbled as he followed Harry, propping himself up on one arm to survey Harry below him.
There was a general round of "hey", "welcome" and "nice to meet you" from those gathered around. Hermione, of course, walked up and immediate began questioning the man about his work—her love of knowledge not having waned a bit since Hogwarts. Harry watched the whole thing with mild interest, and he couldn't help but notice that Miguel kept glancing his way, as if hoping to catch Harry's eye.
“I was hoping to consult with him concerning an ongoing investigation. He is not under any suspicious, I’m merely seeking his professional opinion.”
They stood looking at each other for a few minutes longer before Draco spoke again. "I should go Harry…which means that this is…"
“You’re the main speaker. They can’t start without you.” And pressing his advantage he added, “Besides, we won’t take long.”
“Because I couldn’t disrespect my parents that way,” Draco chewed his lip, his parents were always a touchy topic between he and Harry, “They do love me, in their own way. I don’t want to lose them. And besides, I never thought you’d find out.”
Finally, after what felt like an eternity to Draco, Harry opened his eyes and instructed Draco to move. Bending forward, Draco found Harry's lips and caught them in his own as he pulled out and pushed back into Harry, causing Harry to bit Draco's lip in response.
Harry was happy to oblige and pulled Draco's boxers off in one swift motion, taking all of Draco's considerable length in his mouth as he did so. Draco jerked his hips upwards, bucking wildly and moaning constantly at the sudden wet warmth that had enveloped his cock. Harry moved his hands to hold down Draco's hips and his talented tongue and mouth molested Draco's cock to the point that Draco didn't know how much longer he could hold on.
"I know. I overheard you talking to Granger and Weasley earlier this evening. I was hiding below. I know you're not coming back to Hogwarts, I know Dumbledore set some kind of mission for you to complete. I know you Harry, and I know you want me to come, to go into hiding with you, to run away from it all, but I can't. I can't leave my family to pay for my actions. I know what the Dark Lord would do to them, and I could not live with myself knowing that I was the cause…." Draco let his voice fade away into the growing darkness.
Finally, out of pure need for oxygen, they broke apart, gasping for breath and staring intensely into the other's eyes. Running his tongue over he swollen lips, Draco looked down.
His prediction proved true, and he gave a sharp tug on Draco’s hair to warn him before it was too late, but Draco didn’t go anywhere, swallowing the evidence of Harry’s pleasure.
Schooling his features into what he hopped was a neutral, professional expression, Harry walked out of the lift and towards the small waiting area at the end of the hall. If he happened to note exactly what room Draco was in, that was just a side effect of his Auror training.
Done shouting, Harry turned away, clearly unable to keep looking at Draco and resumed his pacing, muttering under his breath about all the things he like to
Turning around, he saw a young security wizard with his wand out. Draco hunched his shoulders and pushed his hands into his pockets. “I’m here to see Har—I mean, Auror Potter.”
Harry pulled away abruptly, and both he and Draco whipped their heads towards the door to see Healer Banks and Head Auror Hanson standing there.
“Um, yes.” Harry stumbled, “I’m looking for the burn victim brought in from Diagon Alley.” He flashed his Auror badge, “I’m from the DMLE.”
Clearing his throat, Harry waited for the two Healers to look up from the parchment they were reading before he spoke. “Are you the medi-team treating—” Harry paused, unsure on what to call Draco—“the victim from the fire in Diagon Alley?” He recovered. “I’m from the DMLE,” he added quickly, reaching for his identification again.
Tilley bowed, “Certainly Master Draco,” she squeaked and before Draco could add anything, she had disapparated.
Harry’s smile grew, “I don’t know exactly either,” he admitted, “all I know is that I haven’t stopped thinking about how much I wanted to kiss you again.”
That night was a good night for Harry. He didn't have any dreams to remind him of what he thought his life should have been nor did he have any nightmares to remind him of what his life turned out to be. No, that night sleep comforted Harry like an old friend, forgetting the horrors of war, the pain of loss, and the disappointment of failure.
“Unfortunately, yes.” Auror Hanson sounded grim. “As soon as it was deemed safe, crews went in and found Mr. Abraxous upstairs in the remains of what appeared to be his lab. As the shop was closed to the public today, his assistant was mercifully not present. Mr. Abraxous was transported immediately to St. Mungo's.”
Harry blinked rapidly a few times, grateful that Draco’s eyes were still closed so he didn’t see the slightly watery smile Harry wore when he spoke, “You were the prat that didn’t notice an altered exploding potion in the package you opened.”
was already waiting, Draco idly read a few articles, through none really held his attention. He startled a bit when Tilley reappeared, cursing slightly as he knocked his tea over.
Moving further down, Harry reached the waistband of Draco's pants. Looking up, Harry received a curt nod from Draco before undoing the button and zipper and removing the pants with extraordinary speed. Cupping Draco's erection through the silk boxers he wore, Harry swore he heard Draco mutter "Fuucckkkk" under his breath. Smirking to himself, Harry slide the boxers down just far enough that the head of Draco's cock was visible. And when Harry circled the head with his tongue in slow swirling motion, Draco's quiet moans became all out groans of "Oh fuck Harry" and pleas for Harry to continue.
Tilley bowed again and was gone, leaving Draco to curse again at his father’s insistence of continuing the tradition of full Christmas breakfast. As if Draco wasn’t old enough to make his own plans for Christmas.
Harry cried until he had no more tears left, and when he couldn't cry any longer, he just sat there, knowing that for the time being he was safe. That being here with his friends to support him was the easy part and that in the morning when he had to get up and face the realities of another day without the man he loved, and that sure as hell wasn't going to be easy.
“Just some muggle,” Harry ran a hand through his hair, “Gin was supposed to be travelling with the Harpies. It’d been a long week, I went out to some bar after hours, and met this guy. We had some drinks—he was hot and willing, I was drunk and stupid.” Harry took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes, and Draco waiting for him to continue.
Walking into the hallway, Draco hung up his cloak and considered his options. He decided against announcing his presence in case Harry used the time to arm himself with his wand. Searching first in the kitchen and then in the sitting room, Draco frowned as he made his way to the next floor, hoping Harry wasn’t still in bed. When the bedroom yielded no Harry, Draco checked the last logical place.
“I brought him back to mine. Gin walked out of the floo, and we were on the couch, his dick in my mouth.”
Smiling—Draco clearly thought he was his assistant, Harry walked up so that was standing right behind Draco and waited for the other man to put down his quill. Finally, when it looked like Draco couldn’t drop, spill or smash anything, Harry spoke up.
He took another breath and loosened the grip on his sides slightly. “Recently, they’ve come to realize I wasn’t going to follow their instructions or meet that expectation. We had a big argument over it, and I thought I convinced them. When they invited me out to dinner, well I never thought—I didn’t know—” His voice trailed off and he looked at Hermione, his eyes pleading with her to understand.
“Mr. Malfoy sustained severe burns to a significant portion of his torso and hands. There were some usual properties to the burns that suggest the fire was magically altered. Quite nasty stuff, actually.”
, Draco thought as he struggled to look away again. Draco wasn’t sure if he or Harry moved in first, but it didn’t really matter. As soon as their lips met, everything around them seemed to disappear, fading as all of Draco’s focus was on the single point of contact he shared with Harry.
Ignoring Harry’s clear failure to look innocent, Draco returned to his work, and Harry grinned more broadly. Watching Draco as he mumbled under his breath and adjusted his scales, Harry considered his options.
A small gasp escaped Harry’s throat before his clamped his mouth closed to prevent any other noises. Moving closer to the bed, Harry took in the thick bandages that covered Draco’s chest and hands and the singed hair laying unevenly across his brow.
"Have you ever been taken by another man Harry" Draco asked, meeting Harry's eyes in a blazing stare. Harry shook his head no and Draco grimaced in spite of himself. That meant that he was going to have to be gentle; the one thing he felt incapable of being right now.
