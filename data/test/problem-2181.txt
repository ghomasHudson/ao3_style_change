It was nothing like the bond between Narcissa and Draco had been. While the string was still reasonably thick, it was obviously not white. Instead, it was a gradient from purple on Snape’s end to teal on Draco’s end.
“How would we do it?” he asked, and Narcissa’s eyes lit up.
Severus felt an immense wave of gratitude for the man. It would’ve been easy for Lupin to simply shut Severus out, to take their antagonistic past as a reason to stay well away from him and let him fend for himself. Instead, there he stood, extending an olive branch.
The snake had grown quite a bit already in the month he had her. Where she’d been barely as long as his forearm before, she now easily stretched from his shoulder to his fingertips — unless she shrunk herself down, which only worked half of the time so far. To Harry’s amusement, Sirona herself had been quite surprised when he’d mentioned that ability to her, as if she hadn’t been aware that she could do such a thing. Sometimes Harry could hardly believe that the Ministry classified prism vipers as XXXX level magical creatures*, Sirona was so adorable. But then again, she was still rather young.
“Oh, certainly, certainly,” the portrait said, reaching for the frame from the inside. With a sudden
Harry grasped the man’s hand as panic flared up inside him. He didn’t get a reaction. His own chest constricted, making it nearly impossible to breathe. He couldn’t die now, not after all this.
“Well,” sighed Slughorn, “it seems both your potions are, for lack of a better word, perfect. I’m afraid you’ll have to share your price.”
“Trust yourself, cub,” he urged. “You’ll do better if you just speak from the heart.”
Albus Dumbledore. He had brought Harry there,
said Sirona.
“I am sure that can be achieved by other means! This is
For now I hope you enjoy the chapter!
He straightened. He refused to hide like a coward. If he could face the Dark Lord on a regular basis, he was capable of facing a moody teenage boy. A little voice in his head whispered that there was a difference, that one of them was simply dangerous, while the other one was
Yes, this had been a good day for once.
Albus strode in with a smile. “Ah, I see the castle cooperated as anticipated. Are you content with the outcome?”
changes to chapter 13 to adjust the tone a little (January 2021). No content changes.
Minerva nodded again, then shook herself and straightened. “Well, I shall leave you to refurbishing. I’ll see you at the welcoming feast.”
Gods, how he hated that toad.
“It’s not Sirius,” replied Harry dismissively. “We’ve already considered that. He was gay.”
If looks could kill, Harry would’ve died on the spot. He met Hermione’s glare steadily, until she eventually sighed and her expression softened. She knew when she was fighting a losing battle.
Lupin pinned him with a fierce look, and Severus was suddenly reminded that this man turned into a rather murderous wolf once a month.
It worked. After they’d settled on the two armchairs between Mrs Weasley and Fleur Delacour, Harry finally sat down too. It was an odd sight. Draco’s mother to his right, separated only by an empty armchair from the twins and the Weaslette, Harry to his left, with Severus right in the first seat of the next couch. Both combinations seemed so unlikely it was slightly jarring, and yet here they were. An army of Weasleys, Granger and, utterly random, Fleur Delacour, all staring expectantly at Harry. Every fibre in Draco’s body was on high alert.
The portrait immediately stopped screeching and gasped instead, eyes bulging so much Harry half expected them to pop out of their sockets any second.
“I bet you are,” Draco replied, but his tone lacked its usual haughtiness. “That was amazing, though. That spell you did, I’ve never seen anything like it before.”
early, and eat the dinner Narcissa had undoubtedly saved for him under a stasis charm. Or maybe he’d just have pre-dawn breakfast, steal some snacks from the pantry and hole up in his room. It sounded like a decent plan.
“—and he has every right to resent me. I’ve done nothing to deserve his forgiveness, let alone his affection. But I am trying to change that, and I hope that I might one day become a man he wants to call father.” Severus sighed heavily. “There are certain…complications, however. My position with the Dark Lord is precarious, and more important than you could possibly imagine. In order to ensure it I have done many regrettable things, some of which Harry will not easily forgive. And I must continue to do them, which doesn’t make this any easier.”
“Tell me, Potter, or would you rather I go look for the information myself?” Snape sneered at him then, and weirdly it made him feel better. This was familiar, this he could deal with. He welcomed the anger heating up his gut, drew energy from it, even though it felt somewhat subdued, almost tame compared to the uncontrollable, white hot rage he was used to.
Harry considered for a moment, then grinned and said, “Draco and I versus you and Severus.”
slow. While most of Harry’s initial shyness was well gone by now, they still hadn’t moved past snogging, although Draco certainly didn’t seem to mind when Harry’s hands wandered under his shirt. Fortunately, Draco had not yet tried to do the same, and Harry wasn’t sure how he’d react once he did. It wasn’t that he didn’t want Draco to touch him, quite the contrary, he was
Harry managed to keep himself from frowning, at least mostly. On one side he really wanted to get his hands on as many healing related books as possible, on the other accepting the offer felt almost like he was selling himself out, like he would have an obligation towards Severus if he took those books. An obligation to talk to him, let him into his room, his life.
‘we’? I’m fairly certain by now that you’re not all that loyal to the Dark Lord, but that just leaves me with more questions. You brought me and mother here before you knew that you’re Potter’s father, so your connection to him has to be through something else. I’m guessing Dumbledore, the man is a meddler to the core, even Mother agrees with that. The most logical conclusion is that you’re not just disloyal, you’re an actual traitor to the Dark Lord. But there’s no certainty of that either; maybe you’re just using Dumbledore to protect mother and me—which we’re eternally grateful for, but if you eventually go back to the Dark Lord, what happens to us then?”
about Harry either. Not anymore. Sometimes they talked about Lily, although the subject was a sore one for Severus. Other times Remus would tell Severus about his time spent among his own kind and be continuously surprised by the man’s apparent tolerance and acceptance towards werewolves, especially considering his past experiences. To say that it had been a shock when he’d come home half-dead the previous day would be an understatement.
“Let’s have a rematch then,” proposed Harry, already walking back to his usual starting position.
Harry just nodded, feeling an eerie sense of deja-vu at how similar Dumbledore’s words sounded to Severus’ back when their Occlumency lessons first began in fifth year. He shoved the vague discomfort away and forced himself to focus.
“Technically, we were not snogging,” Harry replied with a small smirk. “That would involve tongue.”
“As if I had any chance of dissuading him from his plans, trusted or not.”
“It’s a
only to see that it was almost six o’clock already. Practically dinner time.
Harry’s thoughts wandered to all he had learned about Slytherins over the past month. It had thoroughly rattled his perception of the house. Loyalty, while not readily given or easily earned, was of immense importance to them.
“Bombarda,” said Harry.
“Yeah, I mean, they’re nice. Comfortable, too,” Harry said shyly, a blush rising in his cheeks. Merlin, Draco wanted to kiss him senseless.
“It is,” said Harry, and kissed him.
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
“Vaucluse,” Draco said, by way of answer. “Come on, Potter.”
“Seriously, man,” scoffed Mike. “What are you getting out of making things difficult for Draco?”
Malfoy practically whispered his request, and Harry couldn’t hear it. Impatiently, he demanded, “Speak up already.”
He was dragged out of a fitful sleep later that night by the feeling of the wards chiming. Sluggishly, Draco grappled for his wand to cast a
“They’re tangible. DON’T TOUCH THAT.”
.  Surely it couldn’t be that hard, even if he’d never been there? He turned on his heel and immediately felt the journey spiraling out of control; quickly, Draco tried to rectify whatever mistake he’d unwittingly made. What was another place in America? Bloody hell. And oh God, it had to be somewhere muggles wouldn’t see him appearing out of thin air.
“You take
“You’re pouring it on awfully thick,” Hermione said innocently, eating her pancake. “There’s other chores that need to be done, if you’re offering.”
Draco’s lips met his in a sudden burst of passion, and Harry could feel the way Draco’s love burned behind the kiss, stronger and longer-lasting than the lust. He only hoped Draco could feel his love in return, and did all he could to convey it as their tongues caressed as intimately as their entwined hands.
“I have news,” Hermione said one day. They were sitting in the living room together, Draco lounged across the couch, busily crocheting a lacy triangle shawl while Hermione perched in the rocking chair, covered in one of Draco’s cozy homemade afghans.
Harry watched José run towards the mound with a growing sense of trepidation in his stomach. Had he made a mistake by putting Malfoy in this position? He had every confidence in Malfoy’s abilities, but he just wasn’t sure if Malfoy had the same amount of faith in himself. Harry ached while realizing he actually wanted to help Malfoy boost his self-esteem.
“There’s a point?” Ron asked skeptically.
“You have a great sense of humor,” Jake continued. “When you want to, at least. And we have share so many of the same political views. I never thought I’d meet someone with values and beliefs so similar to mine.” He reached out his hand and touched Draco’s cheek, gently stroking his way down to his cheek. “And you’re so, so attractive. I literally can’t even help myself – I always want to touch you. I want you all the time.”
Harry does as he’s bidden, reluctantly lifting off of Malfoy’s lap and feeling around for his clothes. Fortunately, they’re relatively unharmed. He puts them on as Malfoy subtly wipes another small blood smear off of Harry’s back, one that he somehow missed before. After Harry dresses, Malfoy grasps Harry’s hand and turns on the spot to Dissaparate them away.
“We could catch a quick film? Plenty of time before they Portkey in.”
To his surprise, Malfoy chose a quiet but cozy Muggle café somewhere nearby. After Harry regained his balance, Malfoy didn’t let go of his arm. Instead, he tugged Harry towards the front door, saying “They have the best French toast here, Potter. You’ll love it. It comes with cinnamon sugar and fresh orange slices, and you can get a huge side order of potatoes and scrambled eggs.”
“Of course.” Draco met Potter’s eyes and grinned. “Doesn’t everyone?”
“Well, they have to play up the suspense somehow,” Draco said. “And everything they wrote
Harry’s heart dropped as he held the documents that’d arrived only moments before. Draco was going to be so disappointed. Even if they went to live at Grimmauld Place, which Harry was rather hesitant to do, anyway, they’d still be losing their home; the one they’d already started making happy memories in. He was equally hesitant to move into the Manor, even though Draco would have full access to the expansive gardens. As he tried to come up with a solution, all he could see were delicious pancake breakfasts and a flushed Draco covered in mud, laughing at Harry’s horrible garden puns.
He sprang out of bed the next morning at eight, wanting to use the next hour wisely in preparation for his guest. Potter didn’t know it, but destination number two was Malfoy Manor itself. Draco knew he could convince Potter to give his home a second chance after seeing what Draco had in store for him later that morning. After brushing his teeth and sinking into the bathtub, Draco told himself that he would only take fifteen minutes for a relaxing soak.
The living room, thankfully, was tastefully decorated in peaceful colors Draco could have picked out himself, should he have had a room to decorate. He nodded in approval, noticing Potter standing in a position of defeat over by the fireplace.
For good measure, Draco put his hand on Potter’s knee, expecting Potter to throw him off or mutter something under his breath. However, Potter surprised him by taking Draco’s hand in his own and squeezing it gently. Until Potter’s burning hot palm stole over his, Draco hadn’t realized how cold his own hand was. Even as Potter reduced pressure and only clasped his hand lightly, Draco warmed up quickly. It was nice, sitting there with Potter.
“As I was saying,” McGonagall continued, her voice crisp and cool in the afternoon air, “The eighth year roommates have been assigned. Official requests to swap roommates will not be granted for anything other than an extenuating circumstance. I will be personally evaluating these requests, and let me assure you, personality conflicts are not proper justification. And no, Weasley”—Ron was furiously waving his hand in the air to catch McGonagall’s attention—“Couples of any nature will not be permitted to room together.”
“Does he tell you that he loves you?”
“It’ll be fine, Ron,” reasons Harry. “I know what I’m doing. Besides, Seamus would never put me in any seriously compromising situations.”
MAY 2000
“Absolutely,” replied Hermione. Before turning to leave, she pulled Harry into a quick hug and told him that it was good to see him.
“That remains to be seen,” said Hermione. She stumbled a bit when Harry released her and went to close the door, catching herself on the hatstand.
“Almost,” she admitted, causing his heart to drop. “We got a ‘revise and resubmit,’ but Draco, that means they’re going to publish it! From what it says here, they just need us to clarify what the finished result is supposed to look and taste like. Basically, we fix it up, send it back in, and then they publish it!”
Even with the mischievous smile currently adorning Malfoy’s face, Harry tried to hope for the best.
Speaking of Potter, Draco was absolutely not very fond of him in this moment of time. Sure, he was about to get thrown off of the team, and yes, that was a major bummer, but trust Potter to go and volunteer him for the shark tank. Draco had no problem with Potter volunteering
Hurt, Hermione drew back. Ron slid an arm around her shoulders comfortingly and glared at Harry. “What’s wrong with you, mate? We’ve won, everything is back to normal now. You can have everything you've ever wanted."
She smiled. “Luckily, having a Dual Mastery scored me some points with the department. They pulled some strings and found me a mentor who specializes in Potions and Care of Magical Creatures. I won’t be working with a top-tier Master Potioneer, obviously, but this is tailored to my own specializations and what I actually want to do.”
Draco woke up tired, with a pressure point in his head and a neck-ache. His shower didn’t help much; it only made him realize just how much of a mistake it was to stay up reading until the wee hours of the morning when he had to be out the door early. He fought the temptation to stay wrapped up in his towel in the steamy, warm bathroom and crossed back over to his room, plopping back down on his bed, blinking stupidly.
Harry watched with barely restrained emotion as Nate pulled Malfoy aside to presumably give him bad news while the rest of the team secretly watched as they geared up and stretched.
The grumpy batter snorted. “Yeah, right. I was busy running – blazed past the bag too fast to even see Becky Lou at third!”
Harry snickers before signing the document and sealing it with a
“Let’s get some food, yeah?” Mike asked to break the awful silence that followed.
“You have a good memory,” Cecelia praised. “Say, for the sake of old times, why don’t we continue on? I’m sure Harry could catch right up,” she said, smiling at Harry.
Nels gave him thumbs up from behind the plate before relocating her glove into the upper inside corner of the plate. Draco concentrated again, allowing awareness of the rest of his body before honing in on the target.
“How many favorites on this campus do you have, Malfoy?”
mean that we should act like a bunch of numbskull gangbangers!”
actually intrigued to hear this, so he let Slughorn drone on for slightly longer than usual before making his excuses.

Draco nervously followed Karl behind the counter and into the back room, where there was a sink, a mirror, a sterilizer, a few waiting chairs, and an exam table quite like the ones in muggle hospitals.
All of a sudden, it seemed like the air flow was cut off from Hermione’s lungs. The life seemed to go out of her as she acknowledged their unpleasant former reality. “Not even then,” she repeated sadly. “And I loved you, I really did.”
Once Draco wound down, they paused to pour the hot, freshly brewed tea, Draco taking his time adding the perfect amount of milk to his cup, Harry spending too much time watching him but not regretting it for a second.
“None of your business, Malfoy.”
They fell asleep for just long enough to refresh Draco’s mind, and with regret, he slipped out of Potter’s arms after kissing him out of thank you as well as goodbye.
“Voldemort and the other Death Eaters spending the past year at the Manor,” Malfoy said. “You—well, maybe only you—would be able to comprehend the horrors, the
“– That you’d be their Saviour for real.” Draco nodded appreciatively. “Good one, Potter. You can probably imagine my costume taking on similar significance.”
instead of as their Savior. Also, he felt like he could really make a difference in the lives of the children they were going out to help. California was only a bus ride away...
“Say literally anything, Potter," Malfoy said, squeezing his hand.
“Go on,” prompts Ron.
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ
“Can I pitch to you?” Malfoy asked, making eye contact with Harry though his face was flushed and his hands seemed to have a slight tremor.
“I swear to God, if I have to get off of you and investigate,” swore Draco. They were still joined together, and he could feel Draco clenching in irritation.
“Naturally, Granger. I must congratulate you on that most original insight.”
“Where are we?” he asked wonderingly, looking around at his surroundings. There was a magnificent little gray castle with spires and circular towers that Harry couldn’t stop staring at, lying at the base of a beautiful forest and surrounded by rows of stubby little bushes.
“No,” says Harry, “But the most amazing thing happened to me yesterday.”
“Why are you being so negative?” demands Harry, hand in the Floo powder. “It’s like you don’t want me to ever date anyone.”
Harry appreciated that this was the first time Malfoy was ever willingly vulnerable around him. He’d witnessed Malfoy crying once before, and that had not ended well for either of them. But this time, he wanted to put Malfoy at ease, and that made all the difference.
“It’s over,” said Hermione finally, her voice cracking. She didn’t stop crocheting, so Draco took her cue and kept working as well. “I broke up with Ron tonight.”
“No, it’s exactly the point,” snapped Dawlish. “You could have gotten us both killed. How exactly would that look? If Voldemort couldn’t kill you, but then you got yourself trapped in a hostage situation with a second-rate Death Eater!”
“Hello,” he said quietly. It was unfortunate how one attractive man could completely make him feel shy and nervous.
Grateful for Malfoy’s attentions, Harry feels himself becoming more tired by the second. Malfoy is already in near proximity, so he leans over, still completely nude, and lies his head down in Malfoy’s lap.
“All you’ve done is try your best since you’ve got here,” said Potter simply, as though it was proven fact. “He was a good shortstop, sure, but you have more dedication to the team after a week than he did after three years.”
“I would, but it’s a waste of energy,” said Hermione, shrugging. “You’ve already made up your mind. You want this. The only thing left to do is decide how you’re going to proceed. Imagine that you ask him to come out here, and he says yes—he
There’s a wooden bench only about ten feet away, so he crosses over and sits down. It looks out over a grassy knoll bright with beautiful magnolia trees, sunlight streaming through the branches. Malfoy sits down next to him so they’re barely brushing elbows, but he rotates around, sitting cross-legged in order to face Malfoy.
; the year they’d been given to complete the revisions had just absolutely flown by. Completing a Potions mastery took a significant amount of energy and time, even more so than what was required at Hogwarts at the NEWT level. His time, when not in class or at home, was spent in the Potions lab, because the level of precision necessary for high-level brewing required Draco to constantly hone and refine his skills; and the library, where he regularly read research about Memory Potionry and other topics that piqued his interest. Draco was quite mindful of the grueling requirements of the capstone project mandatory for all graduates of the program, especially after hearing rumors about how others had been forced to extend their study in order to finish everything. One of the toughest components, in Draco’s opinion, was the Latin language requirement. While there a specific Potions specializations focused on translating antiquated Potions recipes from Latin into English, the department’s rational was that every Potions Master might run across a situation where they needed to brew a specific Potion in a timely matter and only had access to a recipe written in Latin. Therefore, Latin study was a mandatory part of the curriculum.
“Yeah, definitely,” said Harry, unable to keep the hollow note out of his voice any longer. “‘Course, it would be nice to have a change of pace.” He didn’t have to elaborate on what he meant.
Harry shook his head. “I’d trade it all in a minute for my family, and you know that. Stop romanticizing my situation because it’s just pathetic.”
Harry rubs his temples. They’re his best friends, and more than anything else, he wants to let them in. Maybe they won’t understand, but they can certainly try. And he’ll feel better than if they just keep assuming worst case scenario situations. “Alright,” he concedes, after a long minute. “But I need another whiskey first.” He drains his second, feeling the heat travel down his insides.
“Look,” she said, brave enough to stand in front of him with her sneakers covering the scorched floor. “I know our relationship hasn’t really been the same since the war, but do you want me to get Ron or Hermione?”
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
During his scan of the ballroom, Harry noticed several costumed Ministry employees and non-profit organization members watching him, each biding their time until they came over to vie for his favor. He sighed, giving in – the sooner he greeted them, the sooner they would leave him alone.
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
Herminone blushed. He didn’t have to look at her to see that. “Excuse me, Malfoy,” she said pointedly, “I don’t know how you got it into your head that I’ve been seeing someone, but, as it so happens, you are correct: I have been dating.”
“Wow, Potter,” said Draco, smirking. “Impressive vocabulary there.”
“Nothing bad,” said Nate, shifting his clipboard under his arm and getting ready to head back over to the bus with the rest of the team. “Just that you put yourself 100% into what you do.” He walked away, leaving Draco and Harry to keep twin looks of horror off of their faces.
The shrill sound of Macmillan calling for him couldn’t wipe the smile off of Draco’s face. Instead, he stood up straight, recalled the famous Malfoy sneer, and went back to training not only with his dignity intact, but with fresh motivation propelling him forward.
Narcissa pressed her advantage and took him into her arms. “Draco, a mother will always wish what’s best for her children. I truly believe that this would be a good thing for you. Better than staying holed up in the Manor drinking bloody rum all day,” she adds mischievously.
For good measure, Narcissa opened the windows as well, letting in the sound of birds chirping and the smell of sweet summer air. “You see, Draco? Life goes on outside of this deathly Manor. Every day, little insignificant creatures are adapting to their new world – unlike you.”
“Yes,” Malfoy affirms, looking slightly wary.
Draco stepped back to lean casually against the desk, though Harry could see his fingers trembling. “Out with it, Potter,” he demanded.
Even at the best of times, Malfoy still made no sense. Harry shook his head and willingly followed Malfoy out the Manor’s front door and down the walk, to where they could safely Apparate off the property.
Draco reckoned that nothing had ever appealed to Harry more. Ever since receiving the offer, he’d been ecstatic, trembling with excitement at the merest mention of the program. He felt so useless, Harry said, now that Voldemort was gone. It had been his only purpose; all he’d ever known. And now he had the ultimate offer that would allow him to get back into the game.
“Both,” said José, tossing the ball lightly to Harry. “He has the demeanor for it, that’s for damn sure.”
“I know you’re good,” Harry said gently in Draco’s ear, causing a shiver down his spine.
Seamus’s betrayal doesn’t hit Harry as hard as the understanding that he might be raped. He frantically thinks back to his Occulumency lessons with Snape and tries to block his mind. Maybe the potion’s effects will be blocked if he can only clear his thoughts…
Draco was pulled out of his reverie. “Yes, yes, Potter,” he grumbled. “Always in a rush. Has anyone ever told you that patience is a virtue?”
“Look, I’m tired, hungry, and not in the mood to be putting up with a stupid prat,” snapped Harry. “Either give me some advice I can actually use or bugger off.”
Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ
Dreading about the upcoming term, they brooded on their predicament for another few minutes before the sound of stampeding feet coming up the staircase disturbed them.
Stung, as he always was when someone called him a Death Eater, Draco could only give them his most superior, condescending Malfoy glare as they strode away. It was going to be a long day.
They sat in silence for another ten minutes, watching energetic chipmunks gather nuts after burrowing into some nearby stumps. Potter rose to leave long before Draco was ready to relinquish his company. He turned his eyes down to the ground, unwilling to let Potter see the longing evident on his face.
“Amigurumi, Potter. It's Japanese,” Draco said. He fixed his attention on the colorful toys instead of on Potter. “And it’s used to refer to stuffed animals that are knit or crocheted.”
‘revise and resubmit’ letter, you’re doing the supplemental reading and research on your own.”
“Harry,” she said, closing her hands over his forearms. “It’s okay. I can feel enough for both of us.”
“I’ve missed you,” Harry said, his voice muffled by her bushy hair. “It hasn’t been the same without you, even with Ron around.”
“Malfoy, I’m exhausted. We’ve been driving for four days straight and Nate wouldn’t even let us take any real breaks.”
“As you wish,” Draco consented, puckering up in jest.
She was cut off abruptly as their new Transfiguration professor strode into the room. Harry did his best to quell his jealousy as Draco and Hermione passed notes during the entire lecture; they silently Vanished the parchment, after adding their response, and then made it reappear on the other’s desk. Like Professor McGonagall had so eloquently stated, Vanished objects went into everything, and Harry couldn’t possibly fathom how they were extracting the parchment from nonbeing and bringing it back into reality.
Draco and Hermione establish a working relationship; Harry receives an invitation to brunch at the Burrow.
“It’ll work out in the end, Harry,” Draco says. “I have faith that you’ll overcome this and be a stronger man for it.”
“I suppose I’m glad that they chose to offer an opinion,” said Draco slowly. “But at the same time it’s depressing they even had to in the first place.”
Thank Merlin small children didn’t move quickly. Draco counted his blessings as he and his two co-counselors herded their group of campers from the Lodge, where they’d just finished lunch, all the way to the archery range. Camp Cedarwood was notoriously hot in the summer, and, just like all the other days this week, they’d been in high heat advisory because the temperature was above 100 degrees. Any pace above “slow” would have probably sent him into heat exhaustion.
“I may have incorporated a magic ingredient,” says Malfoy, smiling mischievously. “But no actual magic.”
“How about some acrylic so you can make afghans?”
“Shut up,” Harry hissed, turning around to glare at them.
“Well,” says Harry, “When has the
As Ron sat there, shaking his head, Harry took the opportunity to lap up some of the filling that had escaped out the side of the pastry shell.
He decided to give Potter a moment to think about it, because, after all, Potter wasn’t exactly quick at processing situations.
At two minutes to midnight, Harry suddenly stood, earning a startled look from Draco as he stalked over to the window and opened it.
of Snape being his biological father, he still thought it absurd to consider that— It was just absurd.
“Hey Ginny,” Harry greeted her.
“What?”
Harry hugged him tightly. “Bye, Dad.”
Even though NaNo is still going, I've been a bit slower with writing the last couple days, but I hope to get back into it properly now. Unfortunately, assignments and exams are also drawing nearer and if I'm unlucky I won't be able to do NaNo till the end. But I'll try!
Draco’s head snapped up and Severus suppressed a groan. He’d have to tell Lupin again to send owls, rather than a Patronus. While they had ways to prevent any messages from being delivered in the presence of the Dark Lord or his other marked followers, these spells didn’t hinder sensitive messages from being overheard by others that weren’t marked.
Draco inhaled sharply, and Harry quickly took his hand and gave it a reassuring squeeze.
“You need better aim than that if you plan on knocking me out the old-fashioned way,” Draco drawled, letting a smirk tug on his lips.
It took some effort, but he managed to coax Draco out of bed without too much pouting, the suggestion of a shared shower proving incredibly persuasive. However, by the time they’d made it into the bathroom, Narcissa’s chiming charm had already announced breakfast, which meant that there wasn’t even time for Harry to take a proper shower by himself, settling instead for a quick rinse and hopping into a pair of his new Muggle joggers, throwing on a sweatshirt and hurrying downstairs. But Harry was secretly glad, if he was completely honest with himself—the thought of being that exposed in broad daylight was more than just a little intimidating to him.
with Remus? If she was, he didn’t seem to be too excited about it, judging from the tightness around his eyes as he smiled and shook his head.
Sirona was in the middle of telling him about a hole in the wall somewhere in the common room, when the door opened and Ron came barging in.
He let his hands wander over Potter’s chest to his waist and up his back into his hair again. There was nothing else to think about, nothing that mattered except Potter and keeping him as close as possible for as long as possible. Draco gasped when he suddenly pulled away from his lips, and instead started kissing down Draco’s neck. He was dizzy again. This could kill him, probably, and he wouldn’t even mind. Potter was going to be the death of him, of that he was certain.
It was foolish to expect that to deter Harry. In fact, perfectly unruffled, he gazed back at Draco with lustful green eyes. “Turn around,” he said, all traces of teasing gone from his voice.
“Glad we could be of assistance to each other,” Draco muttered.
“Apparently so do you,” said Harry, lighting a cigarette to take the edge off of his vice induced headache. He didn’t indulge often, but it did feel more urgent when he’d been drinking.
undignified enough to use a bag of frozen peas) a light flipped on above his head. Draco spun around, clutching a container of frozen cranberry juice. Hermione met his eyes, wearing a scowl and her ratty old dressing gown.
“Malfoy?” said a voice from directly outside the shower door. Draco involuntarily jumped, soap flying out of his hand and knocking over the shampoo bottle he'd already half-emptied. Cursing under his breath, Draco took a moment to admire the audacity of Potter, who, even with his lack of manners, wasn’t usually one to go tromping around people’s houses and barging into their closed bathroom doors. Unable to help himself, Draco yanked open the shower door and stuck his head out. Yes, it was Potter all right.
“You volunteered! Remember?”
hole. But can you do me one favor?”
“About time you asked, bloody wanker,” said Cale, slapping Harry on the butt with his mitt. He bent to pick up a spare baseball before slipping out onto the field.
“It needs done again,” Draco said, standing up on creaky knees to dump the bucket into the sink. His pants were stained from the bleach he’d used to clean the toilets earlier, but it didn’t look like he’d noticed yet. White specks dotted his knees, stretching around to cover his calves, and Hermione couldn’t stop the swell of fondness that rose up inside her at the sight. Draco was an odd, anxious man, but he was also incredibly devoted and surprisingly kind. She didn’t have to wonder whether or not it would have made a difference if Draco was their friend back at Hogwarts—of course things would have been different—because events transpired this way for a reason. They were meant to be friends now just as sure as she and Ron weren’t meant to be lovers. Luck and ease of convenience had brought them together, arguments had pushed them apart, but maybe fate could bring them back to some kind of middle ground.
Harry scoffed. “I’m Saint Potter, remember? I never lie. Now warm your arm up so you don’t kill me right off the bat.”
“Shut up,” said Potter, shoving Draco. “Separate them into middle infield and corner basemen.”
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
“No matter,” shrugged Nate. “Not if I know Harry. He’ll have you caught up in a week, trust me.”
Halfway through, Potter’s phone rang. Draco frowned. They usually didn’t have any interruptions, and Draco treasured every moment of his Potter-time. He willed Potter not to answer the phone.
The elf was still standing in the doorway, as if waiting for instructions. Draco decided to give her some. “Fire call the Ministry immediately! I’ll have their supervisor’s head when I get down there!”
“Damn you," said Draco, sense of need and urgency rising. "I need you
He’d thought he’d need it to carry out the plan before him, but, surprisingly, Draco already felt everything the necklace had to offer. All their lives, Potter had needed those things every bit as much as he’d needed them, only now, Potter’s need was greater. Especially after Potter woke up the following morning and learned what Draco had done.
“You mean some gear?” said Potter, rolling his eyes. “Yeah, I surely don’t expect to see you mopping up the field in those ridiculous clothes.”
Finally, they went through one last building and came out in the middle of a dark, dank cave. “Malfoy,” said Harry. “I’ve never been here before so it doesn’t count.”
“We’re not,” she said, beaming, pushing her chair back and making her way across the kitchen to hug him.
He closes his eyes, not sure he wants to hear the end of this story. Malfoy waits for him to open them again before continuing. “They’d share me after, each taking his turn while the other looked on. I was at least lucky to never be forcibly hurt; they always prepared me well.”
Curious, Harry tried to make eye contact with Nate, but he sped away like Cale had lit a fire underneath his ass. After he’d gotten his bag together, Nate looked back and called “Don’t forget your uniforms!” and continued rocketing out of there.
He stumped away and angrily paced around the living room, lost in thought. Finally, after a good half-hour, Harry Summoned parchment and a quill and sat down on the sofa to write, not caring how sloppy his handwriting was. When he finished, Harry thrust the completed list under the door. “Satisfied?” he huffed.
“I want this,” Draco determines. “I need you to know that I want this, I want you.”
“I expect mine’s in the mail,” Hermione says darkly, folding the last of the whipped cream into the blended lime juice and condensed milk.
“Yes, there,” he moaned. “Please, Draco, harder.” Looking down, he saw Draco’s smirk, which was the definition of shit-eating grin. “You arsehole.”
“Nothing,” he said. “Sons of bitches are still in the car.”
“I thought you didn’t want to be a Malfoy anymore,” grumbled Harry.
Draco petted her wild hair, smoothing it back away from her face. “You’re not alone,” he said firmly. “You’ll always have me and Harry.”
He snatched the kettle and poured steaming water over the teabag into his mug, reaching into the cupboard for another one as almost an afterthought. “What’s there to think about? I already told you what Harry did and how I feel about it.”
Dumbfounded, Harry met Mrs. Weasley’s eyes, and Draco witnessed the silent battle of wills between them. It was a showdown almost as intense as some of the ones he’d had with Father during his later school years.
“No, I don’t want to worry you,” Draco says wearily. “It’s better if I don’t say anything, Harry.”
“You might want to clean yourself up first, though,” Harry said, neatly cutting his own pancakes, which were drenched in syrup. “As much as you know I dig the garden.”
Draco softly laughs. “Challenge accepted, Potter.”
With Hermione covering them with her Glock, they leapt out from behind the bakery and sprinted for the pillars. Harry came to a halt behind the one on the far left; Ron, the one on the far right. After seeing they made it safely, Hermione went for the one in the middle. They quickly caught their breath, stuffing guns into holsters on their legs before Hermione gave the “go” signal.
Draco tensed, but the changes to his posture were so slight Harry doubted anyone else could discern his stress. “I have to,” he said quietly. “It’ll be hard enough for me regardless.”
“Really, Malfoy,” Asten smirks, still standing above Harry. “And what are you going to do to stop me? You realize that your job depends on your silence.”
Harry hadn’t said anything since Luna made the suggestion, namely because he wasn’t sure how he felt.
“I’ll try not to let it,” Hermione responded. “It’s been horrible not talking to you for so long, Harry. I miss my best friend.”
“You’re not busy tomorrow, right Harry?” asked Ron. “We’re heading over to Diagon Alley tomorrow; George’s revealing a new product and promised us free samples.”
“Naturally,” Draco agreed. There was still something on his mind. “But you don’t think that I’d be, um, I’d be…”
“Come here,” growled Draco, pushing Harry flat upon the bed and lifting his legs. “I need you.” His declaration went straight to Harry’s groin, causing his own cock to throb with the thought of Draco’s desire for him.
“I actually don’t know,” he admitted. “They’re in bloom now – see the pinkish flowers? They’re one of my favorite things, too.”
Nate glared at him. “Absolutely not, Zee. You don’t come tomorrow and I’ll have your ass. We’re
“Hey,” he protested, though without feeling. “There’ll be plenty of time for that later.”
“It was so hard to watch,” Harry admits. “I trusted you, but before today I never believed that technique makes that big of a deal.”
“Malfoy – don’t be a prat. What’s happened to Harry?”
When he’d gone to Cecelia’s with Draco, Harry hadn’t been able to help himself from buying an amigurumi otter for her. He knew she’d think it was precious regardless of how mad she happened to be when he gave it to her. The eighth-year dormitory wasn’t far away, and for that Harry was relieved, because Gryffindor Tower (which he always seemed to gravitate to anyway) was a much farther walk. He wasn’t strong enough to resist peeking by Draco's room to see if, by some small miracle, he had already returned. He hadn’t, so Harry retrieved the otter and left.
“We’re here, we might as well take ‘em out,” Harry shrugged.
Left alone with players for the first time, Draco gulped. He really didn’t want to fuck this up; Potter would have his head.
“Malfoy, this is amazing. Why didn’t you bring me out here first?”
Harry took another swig of his beer, shaking his head. “I asked first.”
“I get where you’re coming from,” says Harry, still turned towards the fireplace. “But I want to do this.” He faces Ron. “You’re bloody getting married, and I haven’t been on a date in three years.” There was no need to say more. Their eyes connect, and Ron nods once, stiffly. Harry throws the powder into the fireplace and steps in after it. After muttering what almost seemed to be a silent prayer, Ron follows suit.
Draco, in a moment of weakness and shame, said “I’ll try, Mother” and instantly regretted it. Now he would actually have to think about the prospects when his mind wasn’t so warbled.
, but to trace the Obfuscation Elixir and see what other scholars have said about it to make sure we have an original idea.”
Another throw over the rectangle-triangle, this one directly at the spot Draco thought would make him want to swing had he been the one out there with the bat. Zee clearly thought so too, because he crushed the ball out to the left part of the grassy field.
“Malfoy though, he was totally out of line with his response,” said Hermione. “He actually said, ‘I imagine you know all about dirt, Weasel, I hear your home’s practically made of it.’”
“You tosser, they were here all along,” Draco said, neatly removing them from a folder on one of their desks. “Kingsley knows you too well.”
Unable to believe himself, Draco whispered, “No.”
. I do wish him well, of course.”
Harry could tell Draco wanted more details about what they’d be wearing, but the Professor walked in and immediately started the lecture. Luna had to stay until the practical part of the lesson, when she could slip out unnoticed. Savagely, Harry was glad for her inconvenience, even though he knew she was only trying to do them a favor.

Though Pansy’s face initially fell, she covered her disbelief nicely by congratulating the couple and Blaise swiftly followed suit. They spent the evening reminiscing about old times at Hogwarts and mutual acquaintances, never once touching on the War or the more difficult moments when they’d ditched Draco after years of friendship.
happened.” He gestured towards the staggering pile on his desk, which was covered all sorts of odds and ends. It was no wonder, thought Draco, that it took so long for assignments to be graded. Otarres was busy.
Shaking his head, Harry continues laughing, bending over to put his hands on his knees because he’s entirely short of breath. With his peripheral vision, he sees something dark coming toward him, but it doesn’t fully register until it hits him in the side with a dull
Grumbling, Harry begins stamping up Ron and Hermione’s walk. He stops in the middle, turning around to face Malfoy again. “Malfoy, really. I can make it to the door just fine on my own.”
, the most recent study of long term memory loss, and got to work. His letter to Blaise, which he’d meant to finish tonight, was just going to have to wait.
The coffee was getting cold. Wishing again for a Warming Charm, Draco took another delicate sip and stared back out at the mountains, wishing for the thousandth time that he had simply tried harder in school to be Potter’s friend instead of antagonizing him endlessly. In a way, though, he’d gotten exactly what he was after: Potter’s attention. There were some years where Draco found himself always on the Saviour’s radar. But it was never in the exact way he’d hoped for.
“Yes.”
“Bring me the paper, would you?” he managed to get out, trying not to take out his anger on the elf.
Hermione smiled for the first time since they’d left Slughorn’s class. “Malfoy, you're on.”
Harry was thrilled to finally arrive in San Diego. Even though it was only early June, the weather was fantastic. He could spend all his time and California and die a happy, fulfilled man. After crossing from Arizona into California, Nate had had the most interesting (frustrating) time trying to figure out how to drive amongst Californians. Zee’d taken the piss out of him for the full 4 hours it took to finally arrive in San Diego, and Harry couldn’t help but be amused by some of the funnier witticisms that were made. It was Nate, after all, who’d forced them to make the 2,500+ mile drive in less than 3 days. And it was also Nate that would only allow bathroom breaks every two hours and a game of catch every night after dinner. This was supposedly the man who’d coached the number one team in the New York CFBA.
They continued to fly the highway at 80 mph, perfectly safe from a ticket because that was just the speed of traffic around them. Jake looked over and caught Draco’s eye, grinning. Draco returned the smile, desperately trying to omit the lust he was feeling from reaching his face. Jake looked back to the road, and continued to sing along line for line as he exited on College Ave. The atmosphere was still compatible, but Draco had the feeling it wasn’t going to last long.
for me.”
“That sounds reasonable,” said Draco slowly, wondering how on he was possible going to manage an entire infield full of girls. “Er – Potter, we don’t know what positions they’ll be playing yet.”
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
An hour later, he wasn’t so sure. The basic fielding had gone well, but running plays was an absolute nightmare, as was the base running. Several “pickles” had occurred on the field, but for some reason the girls couldn’t get down how to move in from each position and switch from place to place in order to tag the runner out.
Potter grabbed Zee by the shirtsleeves and wrenched him closer so they were nose to nose. Mike clasped his hand firmly on Draco’s arm to provide moral support, ball still firmly clasped in his mitt. They all witnessed Potter lean closer to Zee and threateningly whisper, “If you pull any more bloody stunts like that, you’re going to see what
When Jake pulled away, Draco said, “You really are a wanker. Didn’t you get enough earlier?”
Draco sighed. He didn’t need an omnipresent being to fuck up his life; he could do that fine himself, thank you very much. There wasn’t anything for it. He pulled off the plain black T shirt that had somehow found its way onto his body and reconciled himself to the jumper.
A few minutes passed. “Do you feel better now?” Hermione asked, sounding very far away.
“I’m just not sure it’s meant to be,” Draco said quietly. “Not that I’m qualified, by any means, to be giving relationship advice. Harry and I are as equally unlikely of a match.”
Since we’re friends now, I wipe it away. His expression changes and I wonder if I’ve done something wrong.
“No way,” chortles Harry. “It’s your night, remember?”
“Hedonistic Haunt,” says Seamus calmly. The face grins wickedly, disappearing from the mirror. For a minute, nothing seems to happen, but then the door creaks open and Harry can make out an impeccably crisp foyer with classic black and white accents. They step inside, and two masked men approach, holding blindfolds. Harry observes Seamus let them cover his face, and doesn’t resist when they come for him next.
“You can wish him well while still not wanting to date him and while also disagreeing with his closed-minded idiocy,” Draco said reasonably.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked.
Mimicking Potter’s actions, Draco settled down next to Potter. He rested his hand on Potter’s thigh, close to his knee. Draco didn’t dare go any further up his thigh because his brain might stop working altogether then.
Draco reluctantly walked forward and grasped a car door for the first time, unsure how hard to close it. Fortunately, the guy didn’t seem to mind when he sent it careening into the body of the car.
“The only one deserving of remedial potions is you, Potter!” Draco bawls, soaking in muddy creek water.
There’s only one thing they haven’t done together yet, though both have professed their love multiple times. One Friday before they’re about to go to bed, Harry leans over to whisper in Draco’s ear, “Are you ready?”
When they finally broke apart, Harry snuggled closer to Draco (for warmth). “This was never supposed to happen,” he murmured into Draco’s soft, blonde hair. “We were supposed to be friends.”
“What? Why are you apologising? Narcissa please, let me help you!”
“See you there.”
Severus shook his head. No, even within four hours, Draco was capable enough to produce something that would at least be harmless if it didn’t work. He seemed to be rather familiar with brewing cosmetics, though Severus supposed he should’ve figured that, given Draco’s upbringing with Narcissa. He himself had never really bothered with appearances too much, there were more important things to think about. If he had put his mind to it, he probably could’ve found a solution to the potion fumes ruining his hair within the first few hours of the day, but the truth was that he had simply accepted it as a side-effect of his occupation and stopped bothering about it. Now that Draco had done the work, though, he couldn’t deny that he was mildly intrigued. And Draco had insisted he try it immediately, so what choice did he really have?
Draco laughed, the heavy feeling in his stomach dissolving.
“I’m tired, Pansy, what’s so difficult to understand about that?”
Harry stared at him in wonder. Sure, he remembered those discussions with Draco, when they’d tried to explain spells to each other and neither could really seem to grasp the other’s approach to learning them, but he hadn’t thought about it in that much depth. Now that he did, though, Remus’ attempt at teaching him a shield-breaker charm flashed through his memory. It was a tricky one, wand movement, incantation and intent had to be exactly right—a fact which Remus had repeatedly mentioned as he explained it. Harry had struggled with it for
“Yes, yes,” Severus assured him. “She’s completely unharmed. She even offered to take a new Vow, but Harry refused.”
“How can you be sure?”
Harry’s cheeks reddened slightly and he mumbled something Draco couldn’t understand.
“I already knew about you and Black, there was nothing to tell,” Severus snapped.
Harry regarded him for a moment, pursing his lips, then gave a curt nod.
Remus sat down with a relieved sigh and accepted the glass of firewhisky Severus was holding out to him.
Albus began to pace. There was silence in the hospital wing, all eyes on Albus, as he continued to pace back and forth for several minutes.
“You survived,” he remarked jokingly, eliciting an amused chuckle from Draco.
to ease Harry’s mind— Oh, right. He could. In one smooth motion he pushed Harry onto his back, rolled on top of him and kissed him.
“I was never mad at
The girls eyes flew to Ginny and her brows furrowed the tiniest bit, then her features smoothed over again.
Draco. After spending five years watching him at Hogwarts, it really shouldn’t have surprised Harry. He knew little things, such as what kinds of food Draco liked, the face he’d make when he disagreed with something, the little twitch of his eyebrows when he was annoyed. He knew how Draco inflected his voice to get his point across, how he doodled on his notes sometimes, especially during Transfiguration because he seemed to be practically a prodigy at that. And that was just from their very limited and predominantly negative interactions at Hogwarts during the past years. In the month since Draco had arrived at Grimmauld Place, Harry had learnt a flood of things, even before they’d started sneaking into each other’s rooms—or, well, mostly Harry’s room.
“About two hours ago,” replied Remus. “He’ll be fine, cub. He left immediately, there’s no reason why You-Know-Who would be upset with him.”
“The instructions say specifically to cut it,” Hermione argued.
“I was such an idiot,” Draco went on, his voice barely audible. “It took me way too long to realise what an utter arsehole I was being, and by then it was far too late. By the time I started to question my father’s views, you already hated me with good reason. All of you. Even when I grew to disagree with my father’s ideas, it’s not like I actually had the guts to go against his wishes—I kept up the act, afraid of his reaction if I didn’t. And now even though
“Malfoy?” The word came out wheezing, as he was still gasping for air.
He wondered when Remus would be back. How would he react to Narcissa?
A group of third years scrambled out of his way with wide eyes as he hurried through the common room, before breaking into a jog as soon as he left the portrait hole behind. The corridors were uncomfortably populated as people were making their way back to their common rooms after dinner. Harry wound his way through the stream of Gryffindors, stoically ignoring their curious glances. Eventually he reached a corridor that was not part of the direct route from the Great Hall to Gryffindor tower and he breathed a sigh of relief at the sight of the empty hallway.
“I really doubt that, Harry,” argued Draco, but Harry shook his head.
Oh, who was he kidding? Lupin was right, Lily was the most loyal person he’d ever met—he’d been a fluke, an exception. In an odd way, it made his stomach flutter, even though it had happened years ago. Lily had loved him, in a twisted sort of way. Loved him enough to come to him, enough to be with him even though she’d already agreed to marry James Potter.
The following two days Harry felt a constant lingering tension in his gut, as he waited for replies from Ron and Hermione. When Hedwig finally returned on Sunday evening Harry took the letter off her so hastily that she hooted at him offendedly. After apologising to his owl, feeding her a few treats, he immediately ripped the letter open. It was from Hermione.
he was without Splinching himself. Smiling at the victory, he opened his eyes to take in the new surroundings. He was standing on a boat dock, with large gray rocks surrounding him on the side closest to the open water. It was a bright, clear day, and from the way the waves gently rocked into the shore, the body of water was a lake. Good God, that smell; it reminded Draco of the time the house elves had brought home raw fish and forgotten to clean it for at least a week. Nauseated, Draco set off at a brisk walk down the dock towards the open shore. He walked up the ramp, already sweating from the hot, humid air. Apparently, this wasn’t New York.
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
As he properly reflected on the episode, Draco wondered for about the fifteenth time in as a many minutes if Potter was actually attracted to Zee or if he was just fucking around. It simply wasn’t rational for Potter to like men, though he had left the she-Weasel behind seemingly without a care in the world. Vaguely, Draco wondered if Jake would be jealous of Potter’s devastating good looks and competitive nature. It might not be the best idea to let the two meet.
He didn’t quite know how to respond. Draco had never envisioned himself having an actual conversation with Potter, let alone one where they got along amicably. If he wanted to ever have one again, he reasoned, it was best to be honest with the former great git.
“I’m sorry, Harry,” she said. “I just don’t know how I can.”
“We all were certain you’d be miserable there, homie,” added José. “Besides, you’d be depriving a bunch of teen girls of the chance to drool over you.”
“Mr. Potter!” McGonagall replied. “I can assure you that this issue will be properly handled. No student should be engaged in inappropriate conduct."
Worried he'd gone too far, Harry left the classroom in Draco's wake.
She pushed him over, aiming a pointy elbow into his ribs. “Ouch,” complained Draco. “Fine, I take it back.”
“Excellent,” said Hermione, snagging a random copy of
“Deal,” Draco said, unable to quell the elation that rose up in his gut. “I’ll even finish up the last of the breakfast dishes, if it pleases you.” He ducked as a sausage flew across the table, seemingly out of nowhere, all the while aimed at his face.
“Next one.” He didn’t want to spend any more time thinking about what couldn’t be.
The next couple months flew by. Though Draco still wasn’t entirely welcome by students (or some of the staff) at the Hogwarts renovations, being with Harry made everything worthwhile. Unconsciously, he started working harder and putting more heart into his efforts. Small traits of Harry’s were starting to rub off on him, but Draco was reasonably sure that he was having an equal effect on the Saviour so he wasn’t too upset. For example, Harry seemed to have taken what Draco had said about owning up to his own opinions and desires to heart. Instead of working solidly without breaks all, Harry established a new schedule. Draco considered a later start to the morning, a solid hour for lunch, and calling it quits in the mid-afternoon much more reasonable. What he liked best was that Harry would often drop by the Manor around half-past eight every morning so they could have tea and biscuits together before Apparating over to Hogwarts.
“Thank you,” he whispered finally. “But I don’t want you to treat me differently because of it. I never did.”
He kissed his way down Harry’s chest, flicking his tongue gently over Harry’s nipples. It seemed as though Harry was even more sensitive there than he’d remembered. Eventually he made his way to Harry’s cock, sliding his tongue along it teasingly with more finesse than he’d expected to have. Harry looked like he was thoroughly enjoying himself, pressing into Draco’s mouth with every lick though he was clearly doing his best not to thrust down Draco’s throat.
Draco thoroughly enjoyed his turn destroying Harry’s composure, enjoying every little sound he could entice out of him. When he finally took a deep breath and went to mouth Harry’s cock, Harry pulled Draco up to join their lips.
The rest of breakfast passed in relative silence, Draco’s musings on what intimacy with Harry might be like outweighing his desire for conversation.
“I swear to Merlin, if you say ‘instead of your dick’ I just might have to wake you up at the crack of dawn tomorrow morning too.”
“Hello, Harry dear,” said Mrs. Weasley fondly. “Come have some cake. Draco here simply adores it.”
Harry was disappointed that the lesson was coming to an end, but maybe he’d have a chance at persuading Malfoy to purchase some materials of his own for the sole purpose of letting Harry watch him crochet.
Harry straightened up, and they quickly sprinted across the gap before disappearing again behind the abandoned dollar store; Harry wishing he had the foresight to change out of his dress shoes. It was muddy this time of year. There was one more store—a bakery—between them and the coffee shop, which was set off by itself a good ways away. Fortunately, the car was parked facing away from the bakery, pointed towards the main road. Harry was glad they hadn't driven in that way.
“Excuse me?”
“I was a little shocked, too,” said Draco, watching Harry’s face. “But the issues our questions bring up complement each other, I think. It should prove fascinating for the reader, certainly.”
After knocking back a quick Firewhiskey, Harry made his rounds, thanking those who helped his cause and putting another round of pressure on those who hadn’t. He became increasingly conscious of a gleaming pair of eyes watching his every move, occasionally adding a cheeky swing to his hips. Let Malfoy suck on that, should he happen to see.
He pulled away enough to look her in the eyes, slightly dumbfounded. “Has the wine addled your brain?”
“Well, see you tomorrow, mate,” said Ron, effectively putting an end to the conversation. He placed his hand on the small of Hermione’s back and started leading her towards the Entrance Hall.
“If you’re willing to help,” said Harry.
Harry snorted. “What’s the betting the ‘insider bonus content’ is really you discussing your desire to dress up as a Snitch for me?”
Ron snorted. “Dating is one thing, mate,” he said, raising an eyebrow.
“Well, come on then,” Draco chuckled, stepping onto the front porch to open the door for them. The handle was formed from a real piece of oak, displaying a few of the circles that indicated the age of the tree.
Remus joined in her laughter, and they left the dining room in a much more cheerful mood. Back in his room, Remus tried to read a bit, but found himself distracted.
“My sanity wouldn’t be safe.”
“We always trust you, Harry,” Hermione said indignantly.
“How many damn layers of clothing are you wearing?” he asked between kisses.
For a long moment they just stared at each other, and Severus knew he must look just as eager as Remus. But there was more to discuss before he could give in to the desire to slam the man into a wall and undress him with his teeth.
He pushed the book into Draco’s hands, directing him to stand so he could see it while drawing the runes. His hands were shaking, there was no room for errors here. Harry took a deep breath to calm his racing heart, then put one hand on Severus’ chest, while beginning to draw runes with the other. His magic responded immediately, parts of it flowing along the lines he traced, leaving glowing symbols behind as he focused on replicating the pattern of the form in his mind. Warmth spread through his body, pooling in his palms as he finished the last rune. He felt himself thrumming with magic, his whole body filled to the brim with it. In any other situation, it would’ve been exhilarating. Taking another deep breath, he willed his magic into taking the form he wanted. For some reason he felt no more than a mild sense of surprise when it complied fluently, as if it wasn’t any harder than breathing or blinking.
The twins’ flat was as colourful as their shop. Two couches, one blue and one red, flanked a purple coffee table in the middle of the living room. A wooden table stood by the window, right next to an open door that led into the kitchen. The other three doors were closed, but Harry figured they must lead to the bathroom and Fred and George’s rooms respectively.
“Portable glamour charms, we’ve been developing a range of accessoires that carry charms to disguise the wearer’s appearance. Could come in handy to avoid You-Know-Who’s dogs, don’t you think? Of course, they’re also brilliant for pranks,” George said with a mischievous smile.
. He’d finished his prefect duties with Pansy and returned to their compartment twenty minutes ago. Greg and Vince hadn’t said a single thing beyond a grunt that was supposed to mean Hello, Theo was hiding behind a book, Pansy and Millicent had their noses stuck together discussing gossip, and Blaise had his impassive mask of arrogance on, brooding in silence. That left Draco with nothing to do and nobody to talk to.
Severus waited for the man to continue, but when Remus stayed silent, he relented and asked, “So, what are your intentions?”
“Please tell me you’re not actually suggesting that I live in the same house as
“So, Draco; Potter,” said Pansy, and Draco’s heart plummeted. She couldn’t possibly have noticed anything, could she?! They hadn’t even interacted with each other apart from their staged fight at the gate!
“Voldemort lured you into a trap. He does that. He’s convincing. Nobody is blaming you, Harry. Anyone would’ve fallen for this deception, it’s not your fault.”
“Yeah,” Harry said. “We confirmed it. Severus is my father, it’s even in my Gringotts records. “
Short two hours later, Severus felt worlds better. The scalding hot shower had helped ease some of the soreness in his muscles and after a good, warm meal he finally felt like he had at least
how would he survive Hogwarts? It wouldn’t just be impossible to fully avoid Draco, the git was bound to spread that story like wildfire, letting the whole school know that Harry had a thing for him. He was probably already writing a letter to Parkins—
Also, there’s a Hamilton quote in there, let me know if you can spot it ;)
“She’s right, babe,” Harry said, trying for a smirk. It felt more like a grimace, but he went on undeterred, “If you don’t eat you’ll be hungry hours before the Trolley Lady makes her rounds, and you get awfully bad moods when you’re hungry.”
“It’s about the prophecy,” he began, and could see Harry tense immediately. “Specifically, it’s about how the Dark Lord knew about the prophecy in the first place. As I’m sure Dumbledore has already told you, when Sybil Trelawney made the prophecy to him at the Hog’s Head, the first part of it was overheard by an eavesdropper, before he was caught and thrown out. That eavesdropper— It was me. I overheard the first part of the prophecy and brought it to the Dark Lord. I’m the one who told him. I’m the reason he came after you.”
He frowned at the memory. At the time he had been too shocked to point out that Severus wasn’t even talking to him anymore, and he most definitely did not have a
Severus pretended to check Draco’s grades, then pulled out a blank timetable and tapped it with his wand, making Draco’s classes appear on it. Draco took it with a nod and scanned over it. First-period was Ancient Runes.
Harry was barely two steps into the hall when his eyes found Draco, his expression brightening a little. Draco felt his lips quirk up into a smile and he quickly fought to control his features. He knew that Harry had caught it anyway, because when those green eyes left Draco’s, a tiny smile appeared on his face. Unfortunately—or maybe fortunately, Draco wasn’t quite sure—Harry sat down with his back to Draco and didn’t turn around for the remainder of breakfast.
That got a reaction from Hermione and Harry paused, raising an eyebrow at her.
“No, never,” Remus repeated reassuringly, giving his hand a squeeze. It grounded him a little, even if only by distracting him as the memory of seeing the man lying naked in a bathtub flashed through his mind, almost making him blush again. His eyes met Remus’ and for a moment he thought he saw a hint of hunger flit through them. It was gone too quickly to be sure.
He gave her a flat stare. She chuckled softly.
He looked up at Lupin and their eyes locked. Lupin’s face was set in determination, and Severus was sure he was thinking along the same lines as he himself was.
“From what I’ve heard during dinner you’ve had quite a successful first day.”
He gave Blaise a nudge, whispered “Coming?” and they were off. During the class, Draco did his best to ignore Hermione, who wasn’t half as sneaky about the glances she kept throwing him. It took considerable self-control for Draco not to roll his eyes. For the fact that she was supposed to be the brightest witch of her age, she could be rather dense sometimes. He’d have to talk to Harry about it—it wouldn’t do to keep up their charade only to have Harry’s friends give it all away because they had as much subtlety as an Erumpent during mating season.
Severus didn’t know what to do with himself. Harry had called him Dad. Twice. It wasn’t a word Severus would ever have expected to be associated with. But here they were, and Harry had said it. At least
“Alright, Harry, I’ll take your word for it. Just— Be careful, please. I don’t like the thought of you messing with evil things like that.”
“You’re such a daydreamer,” she laughed. “Neville was asking you a question.”
Remus felt his wards dissolve. Damn, Harry was
“And what’s going on here?” he asked coldly.
Ron looked aghast. Hermione was better at concealing her emotions, but it was clear that she was just as surprised. Harry couldn’t help himself, he laughed.
Remus barely managed to raise a shield in time for Harry’s first attack. Not a stunner, a Reducto. Good to know that the boy still had enough faith in Remus’ abilities to trust him to deflect such a spell aimed directly at his ribcage. Firing back, Remus took two steps to the side, partially hiding behind a tree. Harry evaded the spells instead of blocking them, his steps as secure as they had been after weeks of fighting at Grimmauld Place. Yet the terrain
I just, y'know, have a life to cope with on the side as well, and big projects require me to be able to sit down for longer sessions at a time than was possible in the last few months.
Muffled voices floated from the hallway, and Draco thought he caught one or two enthusiastic “happy birthday” exclamations. His insides felt like ice. Despite Harry’s reassurances, the fear that Harry might turn away from Draco if his friends pressured him flared bright and fresh in his gut.
* * *
“Tired?” he asked softly, nudging the top of Draco’s head with his nose.
“That’s it, Potter, now—”
His thoughts kept wandering back to Severus. Severus and the noises he’d make when Remus took him apart with his mouth. He shook himself. If he kept thinking about it, he’d only get himself worked up and the other man was obviously unavailable. But his mind was refusing to obey him.
Phew, was about time to have some of these conversations. Good thing Harry has Narcissa looking out for him, she really doesn’t miss a thing.
Severus stood in the middle of his room, letting his eyes wander while pretending not to be curious. Harry almost laughed. He had to admit, since this whole…situation had kicked off, his potions teacher had certainly behaved markedly different from before. It wasn’t entirely unpleasant, although he was glad that Severus hadn’t tried to get closer to him too obviously. He wasn’t sure if he could let go of the deeply ingrained mistrust he had for the man, just based on the fact that they were related by blood. After all, he was related to the Dursleys by blood too, and he certainly wouldn’t trust
Minerva gave him a patient look. “Severus, I know you’ve never liked the boy, but are you sure that this isn’t just your biases coming off because he no longer resembles James? Potter has always been generous, I would have been surprised if he’d turned Narcissa away. And while I can not speak for his skills in Occlumency, he’s never been untalented or unintelligent in general. He may have been impulsive, but never cruel—he wouldn’t have attacked Narcissa unless she attacked him.”
Ron didn’t react immediately, still gaping at Harry until she elbowed him in the ribs, and he gave a surprised grunt.
Resolutely, he picked up the basket and went back downstairs. Amicable chatter floated from the room, and Severus had to admit that he was impressed by how well this entire thing was going. He’d expected much worse. Still, his apprehension had not completely vanished yet. He could tell that most of the Weasleys’ reactions had been stunted by the fact that it was Harry’s birthday, and it was only a matter of time until they would voice what they really thought of him. Molly Weasley had certainly been giving him a lot of rather pointed glares. At least the two oldest sons seemed to be comparably tolerant. Taking a deep breath, he rounded the corner and stepped back into the drawing room.
The boy shuffled his feet, his eyes darting between the three of them.
“Maybe I should go to Italy,” Pansy mused dreamily, “find me a smart firecracker like Gia and settle down as a housewife for her.”
Draco was trapped. He had to pull himself together to avoid melting on the spot, his eyes wandering to Potter’s slightly parted lips against his will. His hand twitched towards his wand, readying himself to hex Potter and his stupid strength into oblivion, when his eyes travelled up and met Potter’s. They looked like blazing green fire, dangerous and mesmerising.
Harry hesitated. He did have his reasons for wanting to continue the DA that went beyond the desire to help other students to learn how to defend themselves, but he wasn’t sure how wise it would be to reveal those reasons.
“Professor, what’s with your hand?” he asked, dragging Severus’ attention to it as well.
“Ah, yes, you wouldn’t know,” smirked Severus.
The emotions flitting across Harry’s face appeared and disappeared too rapidly for Severus to truly catch them. Only a few seemed to be reappearing frequently enough to leave a lasting impression; anger, pain, betrayal—valid reactions. Any moment now Harry would probably get up, walk away from him and never look back. He had to try to explain at least.
“At least her meddling seems to have generally positive outcomes, as opposed to Albus’ schemes,” Remus chuckled.
Seeing that Harry hadn’t put up a new shield, Severus shot three stunners in quick succession, hoping that one would find its target. None did. Instead, they suddenly seemed to
Draco turned to look Potter in the eye, but Potter’s gaze dropped to the ground and stayed there. He was suddenly aware that Potter was actually upset by something and not just fabricating reasons to make Draco work harder and stay longer hours.
“Potentially, Father,” Draco said, humoring him. “I think we had a real connection.”
“Well, he obviously came to you first,” said Hermione, “Which means he must have something to say. I suggest going to find him, and this time, actually listening to him. His fears are valid, and if you can’t recognize that, then he’s never going to fully trust you.”
He met her eyes for the first time then, throwing his arms around her and knocking them both over on the sprawling shore. Hermione hugged him back even though he was crushing her, squeezing him with more strength than he’d thought possible. After a minute, Hermione let out a small squeak of discomfort, and Harry rolled off of her ribs only to receive a number of sharp pebbles in his spine for the effort.
Draco sighed. “I try not to think about that, because it wasn’t an option for me. When I was forced into the Dark Lord’s service, it was because he’d threated to harm my family should I refuse him.”
Hermione pulls her head out of the fireplace to exchange a thunderstruck look with Ron before dipping back in to return to the conversation.
“You’re getting caramel in your drink if you even think about touching my tart,” threatened Harry, weapon in hand.
, Potter. I know how hard that must be for you to understand, as you can’t even properly hold a quill.”
“We’ll pick this back up later," said Harry.
With a wicked grin, Potter dropped back down between Draco’s legs and spread them a little bit wider. “Do you feel adventurous, Malfoy?” he asked. Draco couldn’t figure out why.
“Boyfriend,” Malfoy promptly supplied. “And at school. He was the biggest prat ever until this year.”
“Harry, are you sure that this is what you want right now? I know you’ve been going through a bit of a trying time…” hedges Hermione. “Not that I don’t think Malfoy has changed, and all.”
“It’s a quarter to nine,” he said, calmly retrieving the tea he’d abandoned earlier. “And I suggest you spend the time getting yourself properly cleaned up.”
When Draco came to bed later that night, he found a navy blue bedspread and matching fleece blanket underneath. The material was soft and warm against his cheek as he snuggled up against it.
Draco opened his eyes. “Perhaps, Potter. Imagine how much different Hogwarts would have been if we’d actually liked each other sooner.”
, Potter. Just think of what a fantastic
“You’re not making some sort of awkward innuendo, are you?” Harry ventures. Eric’s face turns questioning, and Harry clarifies, “It’s just, I came here with my friend to have a nice night out, but he's pushing me to get off with some random bloke.”
Draco sighed. “No, of course not. Have you read the
All of a sudden, there’s a flash of light in the distance, and I see a circular explosion with small red pieces branching off in multiple directions.
“What’s it going to be?” Nate asked coolly, not backing down.
“Good night, Malfoy.”
He’d almost drifted off to sleep, but then Draco took his hand and wrapped it around his own stomach, binding them together.
“Hey, at least you didn’t have to walk in on it.”
“Harry!” she cried immediately after. “Join us.” To Draco, she said, “Your boyfriend always has extraordinarily good timing.”
Harry puts his assets to good use.
“Potter, I don’t care whose house it is. I’m seeing you walk through that door.”
Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ
“Since just after our last class.”
Somewhere in the distance he could hear Dawlish crying “Harry! Slow down!” as he attempted to catch up with his trainee. Subconsciously, Harry wondered if he wasn’t trying to catch Avery while outrunning Dawlish and leaving him behind forever.
“It makes too much sense for me to have put it up there,” Weasley grumbled, taking off another couch cushion and feeling around in the crevices.
The lump, which had slowly been disappearing again, immediately came back up to rest in its now-normal position in Harry’s throat. He thought carefully, but in the end, the answer was the same. “No, it doesn’t, actually. Britain is home to me regardless of what happens.”
, might I add.”
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
“Damnit, Harry! Now that movie is forever ruined for me. I swear, I’m not going to share my favorite muggle flicks anymore if you keep comparing them with
“–I regret nothing about what happened, so don’t be sorry!” snaps Draco, running his hand rapidly through his hair. A beat goes by, and then he sighs. “Sorry for yelling. I was hoping to quit within the next month anyway, but then I found out my teaching salary is less than advertised.”
Harry waited impatiently for Malfoy in the Great Hall, unconsciously tapping his foot. He was anxious to get on with the renovations and
“Arthur,” said Harry. “What—how?”
The entire flat had been gone over yesterday; Hermione humored Draco by coming up with an incredibly detailed, specific list of chores to do. And then they had done them. It’d taken the better part of the day, but it was all worth it when she’d seen the pleased, proud look on Draco’s face. At least, it was worth it until this morning when Draco decided everything needed done
. Even though he didn’t like crocheting, and didn’t know how. He would have had to teach himself how to make this. Draco vividly remembered the number of hours he spent on his first projects, messing up more than not until finally muscle memory clicked into place and everything got easier. That had taken a while, though. Harry had done this in a very short timespan. He must have worked all day simply to make this for Draco.
“Well done,” he offered.
been horrified by that discovery. He edged for the doorway, seemingly to notice, for the first time, the bleach-speckles lining his trousers. “Just a quick one, then.”
“I’d never ask you to give up your family,” Draco said quietly.
Draco lubed up before hoisting up his legs and softly pushing the toy into the rolling pucker of his arse, taking deep, measured breaths to avoid accidentally clenching a sphincter and causing unnecessary pain. There was a time and place for everything, but pain play was going to have to wait for another day.
“Fine, Potter, I’m sure I can find something suitable for you in my closet. Tipsy!” he summoned the elf. “Help Potter work the shower and give him a set timer—we wouldn’t want to keep Granger and Weasley waiting.”
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
“You bloody well took the first shower yesterday,” said Harry, curling his hands into fists. “And not that you care, but you made me ten minutes late for Transfiguration. McGonagall practically skewered me.”
“Harry!” shouted Cale from way over by the bus. “Come on, we’re going to get brunch.” A very loud honking noise followed the announcement.
(See the end of the chapter for
The jeers, hoots, and snarls coming from surrounding company increased. Draco could make out assorted responses like “Someone grab a camera!” and “I told you Malfoy would get what was coming to him!"
Exasperatedly, Hermione slapped a hand to her forehead. “That’s not what I meant, either, Malfoy,” she groaned. “Emotionally. How did it feel emotionally?”
“It’s not like I didn’t just pay you a compliment too, you great buffoon,” Harry grinned, plastering a wet, noisy kiss behind Draco’s ear.
Harry shook his head. “Who would have thought you’d owe all your success to Weasleys?”
Draco delicately sipped from his bottle, surprised at the quality of the wine. “Wow, Granger, did you spring for these?” he inquired.
going to be famous,” whispered Harry. “And I honestly wouldn’t have it any other way, because we wouldn’t be the same then.”
“You’re impossible,” Harry replies, shaking his head. “And you better not do anything to embarrass me!” he hisses at Ron’s retreating back.
“You’re going to be the death of me, Draco,” Harry groans, reaching around to grasp Draco’s cock and tug it in rhythm with his strokes. “Are you close?”
He briefly considered turning around and telling her how his day had really went, but the fire in his gut hadn’t died down at all. He would have just as quickly been screaming at her – and Harry knew just how well Ginny reacted to raised voices, even if they weren’t specifically directed at her.
This was going to make working with the man impossible. Draco wasn’t going to last a minute without wanting Potter to push him up against one of the walls they were rebuilding and kiss him, then fuck him so thoroughly Draco couldn’t even see straight afterwards.
It seemed like he had friends, albeit not the ones he’d thought he’d have, in the future after all.
Now that Potter was no longer a distraction, Nate turned his attention back to Zee, who looked defensive yet still defiant in spite of all the attention.
The entire dirt field broke out into laughter, and the grumpy batter pointed his bat at Nate again. “Just you wait,
Draco wrapped a red and gold dishcloth in tissue paper before sealing it in a small box and handing the parcel to the owl. “Take this to him,” he said. “And tell him…tell him I’m sorry.”
“Regardless,” said Hermione miserably. She picked up their essay and pulled out her quill and red ink, ready to cross out errors and write suggestions in the margins. “We’d better get back to it.”
being the center of attention.”
“Ah,” he said. “That explains the wine. What did you have, a half-bottle each?”
He stops walking before reaching out and grabbing Draco’s arm. “Draco,” Harry whispers, “I don’t think it’s possible for you to pester me anymore.”
off of the mound to release the ball in a way he hadn’t thought possible before this very moment. The motion was a powerful one, and for the first time in a long time, Draco felt strong.
“Yes. It’s been a constant of my life for so long, I don’t know what I would do if I
“How about a compromise, then?” Malfoy’s posh voice sounded a lot better over the phone than it did in person, and Harry could almost find himself feeling just a little bit better about the situation. Malfoy was strangely reassuring when he wasn’t being a doucher (a new vocab word Harry learned  after Cale cut off a college-aged girl in traffic).
There is no way to follow him off the dance floor without looking like a desperate fool, so Harry starts moving toward the bathrooms. On the way, he is intercepted by a tall brunet with a kind face.
“Bring it on, Finnigan,” Draco said with a confidence that he felt.
The situation is getting direr by the second. Not yet panicking, Harry lands a punch on Asten’s ribs and aims a knee for his crotch, desperate to escape the situation. Before he can execute his next move, Asten whips out his own wand and wordlessly binds Harry’s hands behind his back.
Nodding, Luna picked up the sheet of questions and turned to Harry, presumably about to ask the next one, but Draco hastily added, “After the War, I reached a point where I thought I was irredeemable. Sometimes I still feel that way, but for Harry, I’ll always keep trying to grow as a person.”
There was no hiding his lack of enthusiasm this time. As they sang “He ate all my M&Ms, and my chocolate bars!” Maggie eagerly made eating motions, while Draco’s were much more half-hearted. Vaguely, he wondered what the bloody hell “eminems” were.
“For the record,” she said when they could both breathe again, “I’ve wanted to apologize to you for ages. Ever since that day in Diagon Alley when you showed up with Draco.”
“I think they’re flirting,” Granger said to Harry. “Should we be worried?”
“Here, you can have it,” Malfoy proclaimed, snatching Harry’s tea. “At least you didn’t slobber all over yours.”
“It’s called running through the base,” Potter said suddenly as they were almost halfway back. “You can only do it on first. I’m sure you picked up on the fact that you’re trying to beat the ball there, right?” Draco nodded. “Yeah, well since you’re sprinting down the baseline it would obviously be a major drag to stop right on the thing, so you’re allowed to run through.”
“Agreed,” Potter whispered back. “I think that’s most I’ve ever enjoyed your company.”
Everyone was still rattling off names, but the grumpy man had finally turned around and faced Draco for the first time. He was impossibly filthy, but Draco figured that was typical with all the sliding around in the dirt. Finally glancing at the man’s face for the first time, Draco almost went into shock. He lost all sense of time and place and a chill shot down his spine when he remembered the memories he had of this man. Of course it had to be Harry Bloody Potter, Draco’s rival and, at one point in time, sworn enemy. They had fought on opposite side of the war, and Draco’s had lost. He owed Potter his freedom and even his life. Draco did not like thinking about all the debts he owed Potter. His vision blurred, and he felt the slightest touch of dizziness flooding his sensations. He hoped that his reactions weren’t obvious to the rest of the team, who he’d had just the slightest bit of chance at liking before the grand reveal of Potter…
“I’ll just have to put my dirty clothes back on anyway,” Draco hedged.
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
“I’ve wanted to talk to you since day one,” said Potter genuinely. “This is the first time we’ve been in the same living unit, but I could never find a good time to approach you. After your talk with Beans, though, I could see you weren’t quite right, so –”
“And why’s that?” Draco demanded.
“Fair enough,” Draco conceded. Potter turned and started walking away, and Draco fought not to admire Potter’s ass, streaked as it was with reddish-brown dirt. “Wait – Potter,” Draco called out. “Will you bring me some of that stuff you play in?”
Draco held on just as tightly. “Agreed,” he whispered. “I wish we’d done this sooner.” After a moment, he rolled onto his side, spooning into Harry’s chest, and then Harry felt Draco’s warm come running down his hole and down the back of his thighs.
“Ask that bloody table.” Giving up on finding the elusive ice pack, Draco resigned himself to the bag of frozen peas and sat down at the kitchen table, icing his bruise.
“Mr. Potter and Mr. Weasley,” she said pleasantly. “I’m so happy to have caught you before you left. The good Captain asked me to bring these down and requested that you start on them early, since you’ve already finished all the tasks in your queue.”
“Wake up, Potter,” he breathed in Harry’s ear. “We’re going to be late to Hogwarts.”
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
“It’s not only the press,” Draco insisted. “It’s the entire Wizarding World. I’m universally disliked, Longbottom, and it will wreak havoc on Potter’s life.”
“That’s comforting,” Draco grumbled, taking José’s advice regardless of how cheesy it was. He needed all the help he could get at this point.
“You’re kidding, Harry. You have to be. You heard what I said before about Malfoy using you, right?” said Hermione.
As Nate continued to speak, Malfoy showed no emotion, reacting with cold grace as he nodded in comprehension. Harry caught Nels’ eye and she shook her head slowly, as if she was in a similar state of disbelief.
, no doubt) that had been hired instead of him. The ones that would celebrate their final year by doing what they
While trying not to listen to Ron’s muffled apologies and Hermione’s tearful accusations, Harry went to put on the tea kettle, admiring Draco’s accompanying tea cozy and coasters. He took a hard look at himself in the shining metallic gray stove, wishing that he could be upfront with Draco. But it was too soon. They both needed for this trip to go well, what with how things between them had been left the last time. Once their bond had been re-established, then Harry could finally be honest. But, in the meantime, every second he spent in Draco’s presence with the secret between them was killing him. With a sigh, Harry reached up to the cupboard and started sorting through the teas, looking for Draco’s British blend. He’d work to change what he could, and accept what he could not. Merlin only hope that Draco could do the same.
“Malfoy,” Potter said exasperatedly, already running over to where Draco stood. “Pretend it’s an extension of your hand. When it’s above your stomach, turn the mitt like this–” he demonstrated, rotating his glove around “–if it’s below your belt, like this–” he made another movement, but strangely enough it seemed to make sense to Draco “–and if it’s above your head, do this.” Potter snatched Draco’s hand and moved him through the motions, and he was surprised when Potter’s touch felt wonderful, at least when he wasn’t focused on punching Draco’s lights out. “Let’s try again.”
to pub night. In their past life, he would have thought going out, getting wasted, and doing shameless karaoke would be far beneath Malfoy. He hadn’t intended to ask Malfoy to go in the first place. But there was something about their new friendship that made him gutsier when usually he would have been more careful. Oh, and there was the small matter of how Malfoy’s face fell when Harry told him he had to leave early.
Malfoy’s face turns – if possible – slightly more pale. “You forget who I had living in my house for a year, Potter. It wasn’t all fun and games for me.”
She didn’t get it. There was no such thing as normal, at least not anymore. “I wouldn’t expect you to understand,” said Harry, feeling the anger finally dissipate. There was no use yelling at someone who was just going to misinterpret everything you said anyway.
Draco smiled. Her enthusiasm was surprisingly contagious, and it
?” Malfoy still wore his leather riding crops, and though Harry was partial to them, Ron was unlikely to agree.
“You’re certain?” asked Draco doubtfully.
Bright and early on Monday morning after the trial, Draco prepared for work. Clearly there was a first for everything. Draco tried to be enthusiastic but failed, so there was only one thing left to do: channel his inner Potter. He Transfigured one of his father’s old robes into a set of Muggle jeans and a black T-shirt, hoping his efforts went unnoticed. Draco dreaded meeting his former classmates at Hogwarts who would no doubt delight in witnessing the downfall of the Malfoys.
“I’m sorry I neglected you today. Transfiguration is kind of our time, isn’t it?” Draco said. "I'll do better next time. I'm starting to quite adore your friend, though."
And Draco did. He left Harry’s shirt unbuttoned and slid down to his knees, slowly unzipping Harry’s trousers, Vanishing his pants, – “Hey, those were my favorite pants!” He exclaimed; Draco ignored him – and drawing out his cock.
Visibly, Draco softens.
The end of the season meant moving to California, and Harry was pumped. He started extensively reading teaching theory, as well as rulebooks for both baseball and softball. Being prepared was important to Harry because he wanted to do the best job possible teaching the kids how to play ball. He often exchanged owls with Ron and Hermione, and they were happy that he was happy, if not particularly thrilled to be parted from him. In all honesty, Harry didn’t miss the Wizarding World. It was nice to be around others who saw him as
Term starts and tempers flare, especially after room assignments are given out. Draco has a strong reaction to an unexpected confession.
They sat together quietly on the sofa well into the night. It was nearly midnight before Draco went to fold his blanket up, afterward brushing his teeth and falling into bed. Harry followed him, gently snuggling against Draco and nuzzling into his neck.
He didn’t know what to say. Eventually he settled on “thank you,” even though it didn’t seem nearly sufficient enough.
“Of course it hurts,” Harry joked, loosening Draco’s hold enough to look him in the eyes. “We’re putting something
There was slight disgust on Weasley’s face, and the worst part was, Draco couldn’t really blame him. “So you just show up here out of nowhere, expecting him to be at your beck and call…even when he’s sleeping.”
Looking insulted, Draco replied, “Yes, of course. Harry and I have always had an
“Whatever you did, keep it up. You could literally sell this.”
Malfoy nodded in thanks, and Harry cast a quick nonverbal Cleaning Charm on him before stepping back again. “As I was saying, Potter, you’re not getting out of helping. There’s a lot that goes into fundraising. You can take your pretty little face over to the old lady’s houses and get donations for our endowment fund –”
"What?" Draco spluttered. "Of course I'm not
“Harry, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, the self-declared victor, “Won’t you come in and have some brunch?”
“Fine,” relented Draco. “Go make me pancakes, pleases?”
Potter sighed contentedly. “There’s just one more question left to ask,” he said wisely. “Do you want to travel by plane or boat then?” Draco’s expression of sheer horror was enough to sustain Potter’s mischievousness throughout the rest of the afternoon.
“Thankfully,
“That does sound amazing,” said Potter. “It was actually refreshing to be around you when we were back in London because you were the only one who didn’t make a great big deal about who I was.”
“Sure!” said Hermione brightly, looking guilty for having stolen Draco away from him last night.
He wasn’t sure how to handle that one. He cared, but not enough to encourage a long discussion about feelings and one’s role in the universe. Finally, Harry said quietly “Ginny, you’re not my shrink. I’m not just going to blurt out everything I feel. A lot of the time, I don’t even know.”
He couldn’t control the moisture in his eyes as he remembered how seriously Draco took his crocheting and the way he loved his final products. Harry held the dishcloth to his heart, savoring the effort and feelings Draco had put into making it. He didn’t know what the stitching was called–only vaguely did Harry remember something about
For some reason, a sick feeling was starting to bloom in Draco’s stomach. The butterflies that sealed together his and Harry’s promise were betraying him, pollinating anxiety instead of love.
“Harry…”
After an uncomfortably long set of pauses, they finally got out and started heading down the corridor, back to the windowless drudgery of an office that should be banned because of how depressing the atmosphere was.
“Last batter!” shouted Nate. There was a small scuffle between Zee and a woman at yet another
He expected to fall away, to lose consciousness and awareness simultaneously. Of course, there was always the other option, which Draco had always refused to think about when he was alive. If his life was already a living hell, what right did some deity have to make him spend an eternity there?
“Jesus,” said Nels. “Don’t want much, do they?”
Harry remained silent.
“Definitely not,” Harry said firmly. “I think he still struggles with them; has to do with something Hermione calls ‘internalized oppression,’ but no, I think he’s trying to be more open-minded. Honestly, we wouldn’t be together if he was still a hateful git.” Draco unexpectedly snorted, and Harry had the odd feeling he was trying not to laugh.
“You know, Malfoy,” Potter said, sounding very far away to Draco’s hazy mind, “I’m really glad we did this.”
An amigurumi of a lion lay on the floor, clearly having been knocked down from its former home on the mantle. Rather than returning it to its rightful place, Draco settled in on the couch and pulled a soft crocheted blanket onto his lap. Even after trying every meditation strategy he knew, the limbo stage stayed firmly out of Draco’s grasp. So he instead called upon the memories that remained from his time outside. Chief among them were his family, his friends, Harry… but also his aspirations, his hopes for the future. As if he were playing a game of chess, Draco sat there and visualized every possible outcome that he could think of.
“Of course I am, you great oaf,” huffed Draco. “Come on Potter, please –” he broke off as Potter smiled and turned a minute of attention to his own cock, lubing it with quick strokes. He found himself wanting to taste Potter’s hard, thick cock, feeling slightly regretful it seemed they weren’t going to have time for that today.
Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ
Anyway, this was only a small toy, designed to stretch his passage enough to where he could insert the larger one that really had Draco salivating. Reveling in naughty feeling of being penetrated, he pushed the toy a little farther in and used his wand to make the dildo increasingly penetrate him both harder and faster. Lying back and ignoring the cramp that had formed from contorting at such a ridiculous angle, Draco pulled his cock in time to the strokes, wishing Potter’s calloused hand was touching him instead.
“Should we be worried, mate?” asks Ron worriedly. “He did seem a little out of sorts…at least, for Malfoy.”
“Did you know,” asked Jake, starting the car, “that there are over 700 different chemical agents that can be used in the process of fracking?”
“I’m just going to keep doing that,” Harry said. “Our entire relationship is going to be built on me proving you wrong.”
All too soon, Nate called out to Malfoy to ask if he was ready. Harry saw a lump form in Malfoy’s throat as he nodded yes.
“If it really feels wrong to you,” says Harry resignedly, “You can work without pay. But if you remember, I asked you to teach while we were eating dinner before I even knew about your interview. It’s not charity, Draco. I know how good with magic you are. And how many NEWTS you got.”
"Draco,” said Hermione, “You’ve only got two more weeks to get them in!”
Term was beginning next Monday. There was a large public gathering taking place on the Sunday before, where there would of course be speakers, interviews, and panels present, broadcasted to those unlucky enough to miss the event. On the Friday before the event, which was the last official volunteer workday, McGonagall announced the arrangements for all returning eighth-year students.
"Well this is all fine and good,” Zee said patronizingly, “But we can’t utilize a pitcher who literally has no experience actually pitching in a game situation. Oh wait, he’s never even
“Malfoy—” he ventured, ignoring the pressure in his lungs.
“Hmm,” said Draco, taking the teapot out of Harry’s hands. “Sit down. We’ve got a lot of catching up to do.”
“Thanks?” he offered.
, for Christ’s sake, and hardly did enough magic to even classify as a wizard. Draco balled his hands into fists and tried to breathe, but he was too far gone. On his desk he caught sight of an apple-sized glass decoration that he’d never really liked. In an instant it was in his grasp, and then his arm was hurling the figurine into the wall of its own accord. Of course, Draco’s roommate, Steve, (Mr. C’s-Get-Degrees) chose that moment to unlock their door and walk in. Draco whirled around and met his eyes while the decoration shattered and covered the pair in fragments and glass dust.
Harry shrugged. “Suit yourself.” As Ron chased the whisky with water and started packing away his things, Harry poured out a third measure and downed it.
“What happened?” Draco whispered urgently, angling his face so that his lips could not be read across the table.
“It took me a long time to work through it,” Malfoy says wearily. “Mother and Father were the only ones who knew what happened, but they were incredibly uncomfortable talking about anything to do with the year the Dark Lord spent in our home. Their idea of helping was to suggest a trip to the therapist.”
As Draco went to sit down, Harry ran for the plastic cover they’d started using to protect the chair after long gardening sessions.
“I can’t imagine any lavender more beautiful than the blooms in your backyard.” Harry hadn’t meant to say it, it had just slipped out, but somehow, that was what he was meant to say in this moment. Draco spun around and fixed him with a piercing stare.
“Well, er…is that a good thing?”
They start back to the flat, Draco squishing with every step and Harry flushing hard from trying to control his chuckles. At one point, he breaks out into mirthful giggles again, and Draco rewards him with a muddy handprint in the middle of his back. Harry can’t be too chuffed about it though, because this is the most undone he’s ever seen Draco Malfoy.
“Mm,” groaned Harry. “That’s really nice, Draco.”
“Good, you’re up,” said Harry, entering their bedroom. He was dressed somberly, wearing a matching wedding ring, and Draco wondered if they were going to a funeral. “I know it’s going to be a hard day for you, but we’ll get through it.” Was one of his parents dead?
him had to be in the top ten.
“Have you eaten?”
Almost immediately, the entire group of campers latched onto what was happened and echoed, “This is a repeat song!”
Granger rolled her eyes. “I’ve only been trying to ask you that for the last
Knowing he was being dramatic, Draco placed a delicate hand on his forehead, willing his mother not to continue.
Draco could hear him slamming doors, checking all of his favorite haunts; the kitchen was usually where he waited Harry to get home from his summer class – after three long hours of what Harry referred to as “mind-numbing torture,” he was always thrilled to have Draco and a hot dinner waiting for him.
“Really?” asked Draco, stunned a professor he’d only had for three weeks would be willing to write him a letter of recommendation. “But I haven’t even been in your class that long…” he trailed off.
“All time is relative anyway,” conceded Malfoy. “Come on, Potter, let’s go. We’re going to be late.”
“Well, I haven’t taken a shower in two days,” Harry said, mock seriously. At Draco’s horrified gasp, he said, “Calm down, I was kidding.” Just as Draco let out a sigh of relief, he amended, “It’s actually been three days, not two.” Draco stopped dead in his tracks and stared at Harry like he was a piece of gum stuck to the side of his shoe.
“How about a nice walk around the neighborhood while we let these two catch up?” Drago suggested.
forgiven – to dust brown dirt from the side of his pants.
“Er, forget I said anything,” he says, kicking himself. The tart looks perfectly crumbly and delectable, and he’s still staring at it from outside the lit oven door.
“Do you have a favorite lunch food and a dinner food too?”
, for Merlin’s sake.”
“Shut it, Finnigan,” said Neville, sliding next to Draco into Harry’s empty chair. “I didn’t hear anyone asking for your opinion.”
“You have to go online,” explained Malfoy in what sounded like a patient voice. Harry wasn’t fooled, though. “Browsing Zillow, Trulia, or even Craigslist should turn something up.”
"Like Harry cares what the press thinks of him.”
On impulse, Harry pulled Draco into his arms, sending the magazine to the floor in his haste to be close to him. “I love you,” he whispered. “Thanks for talking me into this.”
“I want to see you too,” said Harry. “But you’re not ready yet, Draco, and there’s something I want to try first.”
Damn. She wouldn’t make it easy for him. ‘Dromeda obviously wanted him to be specific; wanted the proposition to come from him and not her.
“Why not?” said Potter easily. He put his arms down, gracefully allowing the butterflies to once again take flight, and walked over to Draco questioningly.
And oh, how right she would be. Draco felt his muscles clenching at the thought of the American giving it to him. He was sure the man loved like he conversed – wild, passionate, and caring. After sliding out of his trousers and pants, Draco Conjured a towel to cover the bed with before lying back down. He ran his fingers gently over his cock, enjoying the sensation of being touched. Hardness came naturally as his mind continued to provide him with fantasy dates. The lube was almost uncomfortably slick and made Draco feel uncomfortable if it was on his body too long, but he couldn’t deny that it facilitated marvelous pleasure to certain areas of his body.
“When are you going to learn not to lie to me, son?” snarled Father. “You have no interest in the wellbeing of this family.”
After a few minutes of silence, Malfoy sighed. “Potter, I didn’t
“Then what are you worried about?” Harry says wearily, refusing to turn around.
“Draco,” boomed Blaise, rising immediately to grasp Draco’s hand enthusiastically. He’d always appreciated Blaise’s strong gestures of posterity and poise. “It’s been too long.” With every bit of social decorum he possessed, Draco refrained from making a comment about
They ate on in silence, neither paying any attention to the conversations happening around the table. When McGonagall finally gave the morning announcements and called an end to the meal, Harry leaped up and dashed for the Great Hall, holding Draco’s hand tightly. But when Harry opened the door, he was immediately bombarded by a slew of reporters, all accompanied by Quick-Quote quills and spouting questions directly into his face.
“So now we’re moving on to the single crochet. You’re going to work your hook into the back ridge loop of the second stitch in the starting chain,” Cecelia directed. “Yarn over, and then draw the hook through both loops on your hook.” Harry was lost. As Cecelia was distracted by another customer, Malfoy leaned over to help.
“You’ll be stronger now because you have to be,” Hermione said. “What other option do you have?” They were silent for a while, until she sighed, “That’s how I’ve been coping, anyway.”
“Wait,” he said, face twisting up. “I promised myself that, should I ever come out here and talk to you, that I wouldn’t just apologize. I’d try to fix things, to make them right. To make it like it used to be again, but better this time. I’d try to get you back.”
There were cries of “Please!” and “Finally!” coming from all of the girls, and Harry only made them wait another few seconds before giving in.
“Not so fast,” chided Nate. “There are some stipulations. First off, unless everyone agrees, we can’t go.”
“Well, they are pretty superior products,” laughed Harry.
When they finally sat down on the bleachers, bleary even in the cool air, Harry could already feel that it was going to be an unpleasant next few hours. “Team!” Nate bellowed, startling Zee out of his early morning stupor. “This is it! Our second to last practice before you become coaches means I need you at the top of your game
Ignoring their revolted expressions, Nate pumped his fist in the air as he ran out to the rest of the team. “We’re going to California!”
“Hey, you!” Harry bellowed, robes billowing behind him. “Where’re you going? I wasn’t done with you!”
Ron would have probably shoved a Firewhiskey at him and gotten him good and drunk. Though Ron wasn’t the most talkative, at least he wouldn’t be feeling his pain. When they were both past tipsy and Ron could stand conceptualizing him and Draco together, he’d probably have advised Harry to just go and talk to him. After Harry presumably rolled his eyes, Ron would have probably gotten serious and mentioned that when he irked Hermione, begging and admitting that he really was a moron always worked. Past desperation, Harry probably would have done it, even being drunk and all, and still gotten Draco to take him back.
Hermione sighed. “As usual, your timing was awful."
José nodded. “And there’s a ton of low-income kids in California. Why didn’t he do this up in L.A. though? There’s more of a need there than in suburbia San Diego.”
“Just focus on Nels’ mitt,” José said from behind him, sounding very far away.
“I swear, the deal’s off if you tickle me one more time! Damnit, Potter!”
“Dragon, do the movements!” Maggie cried.
“It does,” Hermione said softly. “I’ve spent some of the best years of my life living with you, Draco. France really was the best decision we could have made for ourselves after graduation. I’ve never regretted a second of our lives here.”
“Looks like their car,” Harry confirmed. “Can’t tell which one of them it is, at least not from here.”
“Some have been more accepting than others,” Draco said.
“I couldn’t care less if my father approves. I make my own decisions now.”
“Goodbye, Granger.”
“And now you have one less person to knock out of the competition,” Hermione laughed. “Oh come on, Draco. I know you’re not sorry we won’t have to compete against each other.”
Picking up on the vibe, Macmillan sneered back. “Yes,
When Draco made no motion to explain or to start cleaning up, Steve felt compelled to speak. “Er – I’ll just go find a dustpan, then,” he mumbled, brushing off his hair and bag before hanging the latter on a hook.
“You’ll all get your coaching assignments tomorrow,” said Nate. “I’ve paired us all up – Zee’s with Becky Lou, Mike with José, Nels with Chris, and finally Cale with me.” After that last pairing, his face was more than a little pink. “Alright, everyone back on the bus!”
“You were victimized, but nothing was taken from you,” Malfoy explains, calming his confusion with a simple hand gesture. “Your identity is not based on the act of sex. Sexuality and the expression of sexuality are a part of your identity, but by no means do they fully comprise it.”
“Too many reasons to name,” Harry said simply. “One of them being I don’t want you to hate me for the rest of our lives.”
Malfoy and Nate turned around to stare daggers at him, but Harry defiantly met the eyes of both, barreling ahead anyway as the subconscious part of his brain sighed and wondered how he always got himself into these scrapes. The entire team looked at him in surprise.
Potter absolutely
of yours, and Cissy partly to blame too…” She seemed to check herself and said, “But you have a choice now. And to answer your earlier question, yeah, I think you should go.”
“I just did the wash yesterday,” he says apologetically. “These need to last at least another three days.”
He was treated to the most enormous eye roll he’d ever seen; and, after years of friendship with Pansy, that was saying something.
Instead of being hurt, Malfoy smiled, a look at odds with his appearance. “I’m glad my father is alive, but I’ll be making my own decisions from now on. That’s why I’m here, Potter.”
Instead of resting against the tree, Draco found himself striding right up to the actual tomb and pressing his right hand against it. “‘My mercy?’ ‘Your mercy?’ Ha!” he scoffed. “None of it matters now.” He sank to the ground, pulling his knees up to his chest and pressing his head back against Dumbledore’s memorial. Sighing, Draco reached up to wipe away a stray tear.
“You’ve been offered a marriage proposition,” Father revealed, watching Draco through narrowed eyes. “I’ve already accepted on your behalf. You’re to be wed at the end of summer.”
“I’ll give you sweet.” In a moment of pure self-control, Draco wrestled Harry to the bed and pinned his hands above his head. Once he was sure there would be no more fighting he released them and started kissing his way down Harry’s chest, swirling his tongue around Harry’s nipples in a way that was sure to drive him mad.
“Yes?” he called.
“That he’s a Death Eater.”
“A little, but I’ll manage a couple more rounds,” Harry insisted.
Potter speaks up first, “So, er, would you wanna go to Hogsmeade?”
Taking one last deep breath, he rounded the corner and stepped into the entrance hall, Remus on his heels.
He broke off when Harry jumped up and gave him a bone-crushing hug.
“What is it?”
“Well, since you seem unlikely to attack each other the moment I leave you alone, I shall be returning to Hogwarts now,” he announced briskly. “Don’t forget to do your exercise this evening, Potter, I’ll be back tomorrow for another lesson. Narcissa.” He inclined his head towards her, then promptly spun around and left, his robes billowing behind him.
Draco breathed, tangling his hands in Harry’s hair again—if only to steady himself. Harry grinned up at him, green eyes sparkling with mischief even though his pupils were blown wide with lust. He ran his hands up Draco’s thighs; slowly, teasing, his face so close to Draco’s crotch that he could feel Harry’s breath on the sensitive skin of his cock. Draco whimpered and Harry’s grin widened. Settling one hand on Draco’s hips—providing Draco with some much appreciated stability; his legs were shaking at this point—he ran the other one over the exposed skin around Draco’s hard length, avoiding to touch where he knew Draco wanted him to.
Minerva’s face darkened.
“Go to sleep at a reasonable time,” he quipped as he pulled back, pointing at the clock. It was already past one in the morning.
“James knew,” Remus breathed, half in shock.
the people responsible for this. Hurt them more, make them pay, make them wish they’d never been born.
“It’s Friday evening, you haven’t been to dinner and you did not turn up in the staff lounge. I was getting concerned.”
“Theo gets them too,” he explained, running one hand up and down Harry’s back. “I caught him once in the middle of an attack, back in second year. I had no idea what to do, so I got Madam Pomfrey. She explained that he was having a panic attack and then helped him to calm down. Ever since, whenever he gets panicky he asks me to pinch him, because that sometimes pulls him out before it really starts. And if it doesn’t work, I stay with him and do what Madam Pomfrey did, and it usually helps.”
“Please
Suddenly aware that he was wasting time, Draco did the least Slytherin thing possible and decided to just
Potter hadn’t reemerged from his room for the entire rest of the day. His hopes of seeing him at dinner had proven to be futile, and Draco had been steeling himself for long days of not seeing him at all, making plans in the back of his head on how to coax the Gryffindor out of his shell again. It had worked once, it could work twice, right?
. Maybe everyone felt like this in a relationship, Harry wouldn’t know, but somehow he doubted that. The way he and Draco fit together was…different. More. He’d certainly never felt anything like this for Cho, not even for Cedric, and his crush on Cedric had been much more intense than his feelings for Cho.
Sure, Ron was acting stuck up about Draco, and Hermione would interrogate him into the ground next time he met her; but nobody had hexed anyone, the majority of the Weasleys had accepted Draco as his boyfriend and he’d even caught Narcissa and Mrs— no,
No sooner had he seen them, when Severus strode over to where Harry and Weasley were standing, his face a mask of cold fury. Draco couldn’t quite tell whether the emotion was real or not, but he relied on the assumption that it wasn’t. Either way, it didn’t bode well.
“For telling me about him, again. And for listening,” Severus explained. “I truly appreciate your willingness to include me. You really could’ve done the opposite after how I’ve treated you in the past. For which I’d also like to apologise, again. Not just for our schoolboy disputes, but also for my behaviour when we were colleagues. I shouldn’t have let my actions be guided by past grudges. It seems to be a recurring fault of mine that I’m trying to work on in the future.”
“I thought the same. I guess we’ll find out what it was about when Severus returns.”
A few minutes later, Kreacher had picked up the countless bags of clothing and they left Twilfitt and Tatting’s behind, strolling down Diagon Alley in the mild evening sun. Draco was pleased with himself. If nothing else, at least Harry had proper clothes now. And two Lordships.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “You are incorrigible, Draco. What’s got you so occupied?”
Remus exhaled slowly and shrugged. “It could be worse, but it’s definitely not my favourite thing in the world. It’s too quiet here now.” He laughed. “Never would’ve thought that Grimmauld Place could feel so vast, I always perceived it as somewhat confining and cramped, but now that everyone is gone there’s suddenly way too much empty space.”
Remus thought, wishing once again he could just
Harry drew his eyebrows together. “Yes, as a matter of fact I am.”
known him all his life. Him and his father had been friends back at school, despite being several years apart. They must have been rather close, for his father to name Severus his godfather, but whenever he asked, both of his parents evaded his questions.
“As if you liked Malfoy any better!” Ron retorted angrily.
Instead of sitting down, Harry busied himself with putting the kettle on, as Narcissa and Snape settled at the table.
“Indeed,” Severus confirmed. “I’ve transformed it just a few hours ago. There’s a bathroom as well, but I fear we don’t have time to look at that now. The feast is about to start in only a few minutes and you shouldn’t be seen together too much. Draco, why don’t you go to the Great Hall already? We’ll follow.”
“What? Legilimency is incredibly difficult to learn, much harder than Occlumency; only few people manage,” said Draco. “That’s partially why everyone fears the Dark Lord so much, because he’s such a strong Legilimens.”
for both beta reading and drawing up the original seating order of everyone!
“I’m not talking about the forms, Hermione. I’m talking about
“And what would you teach me that Remus can’t?” Harry demanded, his face still hard.
Draco only gave him an expectant look, waiting for him to go on. Harry took a breath, sitting up a little straighter.
Harry let go of his arm and grinned up at him. “Anything I should know about you and Tonks? She seemed rather interested in your company—and
it works, there’s some sort of reason for it. But these inheritances … what explanation could there possibly be other than that I’m
“Keep both your wands timed, just to be sure. Double check the direction every time before you stir. And do
“Let’s go out,” he proposed, earning himself an incredulous glance from Harry. “Don’t give me that look, we’ve been cooped up in this house for weeks—you even longer than me. As much as this place—and its inhabitants, one in particular—is growing on me, it’s time to go see the outside world again. Seeing how much taller you are than before, you’ll need new robes either way, so how about we go shopping? I need some new dress robes too, and your sweater looks awfully worn.”
Draco frowned at the thought of his boyfriend being swarmed by hordes of girls—and boys, if Blaise’s comments were any indication. Why exactly had he decided to date Harry bloody Potter again?
Harry complied and waited as Severus settled Dumbledore onto an old couch. Only now did he notice that one of Dumbledore’s hands looked rotten and black.
To his great relief, Pansy accepted his incredibly vague answer and jumped into a retelling of her own summer, including a trip to Romania where she’d apparently met the most
Nobody was. Some of his tension drained out of him and he sagged a little as he closed the door behind him with a relieved sigh. He was
He hadn’t intended for anyone to hear, but Remus chuckled next to him and gave him an amused look.
“Of course,” he bit out.
His voice was barely above a whisper when he forced his mouth to form the words “Subscriptio Magus Proprius.”
Compared to how July had seemed to last forever, August flew by incredibly quickly. The inhabitants of Grimmauld Place had established their routines both individually and together, and they’d grown into a real family—at least in Harry’s opinion. Not that he knew much about what real families were supposed to be like, but to him they were one.
Remus clocked his expression and quickly shook his head. “He’s been summoned.”
“Not quite yet, but I do have someone in mind.”
Harry gestured for her to proceed, and Narcissa called for three of her house-elves. With three soft pops, the little creatures appeared promptly in the library, bowing deeply to Narcissa.
It was absurd.
Draco’s nerves fluttered. He had no idea how to play this. Approaching Potter directly was more than likely to end badly, and Draco wasn’t particularly good at expressing how he felt in the first place, especially when what he felt was so
Remus considered for a moment, then replied, “Natural terrain if you want to emphasise the practical relevance.”
“Of course I haven’t forgotten, but you can not just ask me to
“We can’t stay here, can we?”
Ginny narrowed her eyes and answered, “Yes. And who might you be?”
“I’ve found you attractive since third year,” Harry deadpanned, and Draco felt like all the air had been sucked out of his lungs.
Harry laughed and gave them a round of applause, to which they bowed dramatically. Fred opened his mouth to say more but was cut off by Molly who started to berate them for the poster in the window, and Harry quickly ducked away to avoid getting caught in the crossfire. The amount of people in the shop made it difficult to reach the shelves, but Harry managed to squeeze through after a few minutes only to notice that he’d lost Ron and Hermione in the process. For a moment he considered going back, but the crowd of people pushed him further into the store and he decided to just get back to them later.
Harry’s expression darkened and he looked away, green eyes fixed on empty space in the small room.
“I can’t believe you,” Draco muttered eventually, looking awfully put out. But his outrage at Gryffindors breaking into the Slytherin common room was quickly forgotten, when Harry recounted entering the Chamber to find Ginny, meeting sixteen year old Voldemort, still going by the name of Tom Riddle. All blood seemed to drain from Draco’s face when Harry told how he’d fought the Basilisk with the help of a phoenix and a sword out of a hat, how he’d been bitten by the Basilisk and how he’d destroyed the diary with the its tooth, thinking it would be the last thing he’d ever do. Seeing Draco’s expression, Harry quickly moved to grab his boyfriend’s hand to reassure him that he was still very much alive. Both Draco and Narcissa scowled when he told them about Lucius’ involvement in all those events, confirming his suspicion that they had known nothing about it.
“It’s not entirely clear, I’m afraid. Some say that spells that have only one singular function—that of healing—are healing magic, while spells such as cleaning charms have more than one purpose and therefore don’t fall into that specific category. Others claim that healing magic has an inherent quality that other spells lack, although it has never been agreed upon what exactly that would be.” Severus paused, giving him a cautious smile. “I still have some books on this, both on healing itself as well as on the more theoretical debates surrounding it. I could bring them for you, if you’d like.”
, he chided himself.
“Well, I’m not sure if you want to hear it,” Narcissa began, hesitant, as if waiting for Harry to change his mind. When he said nothing, she continued with a sigh, “You do rather resemble someone I know. Someone who used to be very close to Lily Evans.”
“And it has to be me and not you because…?”
“So, what did Dumbledore say? What’s he teaching you?” Hermione asked eagerly.
“For now, I shall teach you the simplest method — the spell Legilimens
Harry thought petulantly. Outwardly, he merely gave a noncommittal shrug.
He took a deep breath to steady himself. Draco reached out to touch his knee.
gonna be fine, right?”
He glared at the clock as if the device itself was at fault for going so slow. To his horror, it promptly disappeared.
a voice deep in his mind supplied. Yes, the portkey. He had to activate the portkey. With tremendous effort he closed his fingers around his wand, reached into his pocket and pulled out the small pin that would bring him home.
Draco twisted his fingers into Harry’s hair more firmly and pulled his head away from his neck, guiding him up to his lips again. He allowed Harry to take control of the kiss for a moment, melting into the sensation of it. After he’d had his fill, it was time to switch things up a little. With a smirk, Draco pulled Harry back by his hair, exposing his neck and eliciting a small hiss from him as he tilted his head backwards. Draco latched on to the side of Harry’s bared neck, biting just hard enough to make Harry gasp again.
because there are other people in your life too.”
Severus’ chest felt tight. Unbearably tight. A wave of emotion threatened to overcome him and, almost instinctively, he slammed his Occlumency shields up. Instantly, he was calm. Detached.
“I sense a ‘but’ there.”
The thought came unbidden, and Remus tried his best to argue against it, only to find that he couldn’t. The assumption was based upon the fact that Lily was the only partner of Severus’ that Remus knew about. That didn’t mean there hadn’t been others, or even if there hadn’t been, that there couldn’t be others. Male others. Severus’ reaction had certainly not been very typical for a straight man. Remus felt his heartbeat quicken. Could Severus be
that?
There was a tense silence as everyone stared at him speechlessly.
“But if you’re wounded by a dark spell, you wouldn’t go to the curse-breaker department, you’d go to St. Mungo’s. How do they treat such things there?”
“Dumbledore trusts him. He hasn’t given me any real reason to distrust his loyalty so far, apart from being a right prick as a teacher up until now. You don’t?”
“You mean back in first year,” Harry assumed.
“Good morning,” she greeted him. “Breakfast is nearly ready.”
Harry woke up feeling well-rested for once. In fact, he was nearly sure he’d never slept so well before in his entire life. And not a single nightmare. Draco had stayed wrapped around him during the night and Harry couldn’t help but smile down at the sleeping blond, revelling in the heat that radiated from Draco’s naked chest. He shivered slightly as memories from the previous night came flooding back into his mind.
Finally, Harry laughed too. He handed the scroll back to Burgock, who made a copy of it at the request of Draco’s mother, and then floated it back to its proper place in the shelves. Harry gave her a grateful look as he pocketed the copy, before turning back to Burgock.
“I know, Ron, but you don’t have your own yet, do you? So, borrow mine.” He dropped his voice to the lowest whisper. “I know all the recipes already anyway.”
“Good,” replied Lupin. “What matters now is that Harry needs us. He’s barely sixteen and the whole wizarding world suddenly expects him to kill You-Know-Who. He’ll need all the support he can get, and you and I are equally responsible for him now.”
Narcissa finally abandoned her spot at the stove and took a seat on Harry’s left next to Draco, while Remus and Snape sat down on the right side of the table. There was a beat of silence, then Remus cleared his throat.
The noise made his head pound — he must’ve hit it when he landed — and he groaned as he pushed himself up into a sitting position. Harry was already halfway to him, grinning broadly.
This one blindsided me with unexpected Wolfstar feels and now I find myself wanting to write a Wolfstar fic. I won’t though, not before this is done, promise. Also, don’t ever mess with Remus’ chocolate. It’s IMPORTANT!
“Missed you,” Harry murmured against his lips, kissing him again before he even had a chance to answer. Draco moaned when Harry caught his lower lip between his teeth, pulling slightly before letting go again.
I have to say that writing Snupin is way out of my comfort zone, compared to writing Drarry, and if it hadn’t been an explicit request from my best friend, I’d be glossing over the details much more for that. I will do my best however to include as much Snupin half-smut (and hopefully smut at some point) as possible.
Severus almost rolled his eyes. Yes, he knew rather well how Draco felt about Potter, much more so than Draco suspected, probably more so than Draco himself. He’d never understand the boy.
With a chuckle, Severus poured him a glass and he took it with a grateful smile.
“Still, somehow something changed. Maybe it’s because he’s suddenly not acting like such a git anymore—but then again the only reason he’s changed his attitude is because I’m his son, so wouldn’t that bring us right back to the start? That it’s all because we’re bound by blood? I still think that’s bullshit. It’s just so
He opened his mouth to say something, but Malfoy was faster.
“No but,” Lupin interrupted him. “We’ll figure it out somehow. I gave a promise to Harry that I wouldn’t let go of him again. I meant that. This boy means the world to me, and even if you’re his biological father, you won’t be caring for him alone. You’ll just have to deal with me around.”
Harry nodded, nibbling on the chocolate.
Albus regarded him for a moment, then nodded minutely. “You may bring the Malfoys to Grimmauld Place. However, should their presence there interfere with Harry’s training we must find another solution. And I must ask that Narcissa makes an Unbreakable Vow to ensure her loyalty—just in case.”
“So?” Dumbledore prodded, and Harry realised that he was waiting for an answer on how Harry had done it.
“You’re not pathetic, it’s natural to wish for parents if you didn’t have any growing up,” Draco chided.
“Excuse me,
It was like Potter was an entirely different person.
Harry blinked, obviously surprised. “We have cake?”
“Hermione Granger isn’t,” Remus remarked.
“Hermione, in case it has slipped your notice: We are at
“I— I’m not sure,” he eventually answered truthfully.
Narcissa let out a sob in Harry’s arms and he tightened his grip. Severus buried his face in his hands.
Draco’s stomach fluttered as he thought about the present hidden in the bookshelf. He had almost lost his mind over what to give Harry for his birthday until he finally bit the bullet and asked Remus for help. He’d come to appreciate the man now that he knew him better. Unfortunately, Remus hadn’t been able to tell him anything that Draco hadn’t already considered: something to do with healing, defence magic, Quidditch, or something personal. In the end, Draco had decided to just do both—one regular gift, for when everyone was visiting, and one personal gift, just between them. Said personal gift now sat between two thick books, covered by a concealment charm and waiting to be summoned as soon as that damned clock finally reached midnight.
“I don’t think so, Harry. Dumbledore said that there was a hook in the pattern, a sort of trigger that would’ve unravelled it all at some point. Lily probably intended the charms to dissolve when you turned seventeen.”
expanding, unfolding, growing in his ribcage. He vaguely remembered a somewhat similar feeling, the first time Lily had told him that she loved him, back in their fourth year at Hogwarts. It was wonderful—and absolutely overwhelmingly too much. Severus suddenly realised he’d stopped breathing and quickly sucked in a sharp breath.
, that simply won’t do. Can you glamour his scar, mother? I’ll go pick some robes of mine he can wear until he gets some of his own.” He beamed at Harry. “Trust me, nobody will recognise you in wizarding attire, without your scar on your new face.”
He couldn’t meet Remus’ eyes, couldn’t shake the feeling that this was all his fault, no matter what anyone said.
his brain reminded him frantically. He ignored it, whimpering instead when Harry pulled back a little.
Narcissa sighed, but nodded. “Of course, come Draco,” she said, getting out of her chair. Draco made an exasperated noise but followed his mother to the front of the kitchen.
Burgock’s eyes widened slightly, but thankfully he didn’t say anything. A faint glow rippled from his wrinkled hand onto Harry, engulfing him for a moment, before dissipating again. Draco watched curiously, he’d never seen the goblins do magic before. When the spell was done, Burgock paused, furrowing his brows.
“It wouldn’t. I am merely trying to be more clear in my communication, seeing as that created…issues before,” Severus drawled, sounding much more like himself now.
She laughed. “I do wonder what he’ll write about now that he doesn’t have Harry to complain about anymore.”
he thought to himself. This whole day had been entirely too much, and it was only early afternoon. He longed to go back to bed and escape his thoughts for a little while. Talking to Remus had been most informative, but also draining. He was still struggling to wrap his mind around the revelations about his parents, while also trying to avoid thinking about Sirius too much. He barely registered that Narcissa had let go of his hand, eyeing him curiously now. It was Snape who pulled him out of his thoughts again.
If I ever see any of those miscreants again, they will not see another sunrise, I swear it.
Draco suppressed a smirk. If academic interest was the key to Granger’s approval, he could work with that. He just needed to get her into a private enough conversation to apologise eventually. As if he’d read his mind, Harry announced that he’d go and get some food, pulling the Weasel along with him and leaving Draco behind alone with Granger. As casually as possible, Draco shifted closer to her, taking Harry’s seat at the edge of the couch. If Granger suspected anything about his intentions she didn’t show it as they began a polite discussion about various books on transfiguration, arithmancy and charms that went beyond N.E.W.T. level.
“I don’t know, love,” Draco said slowly. “Perhaps we should contact Gringotts and ask?”
Not long after Harry had relocated to talk to Granger and the Weasel, people started to move all over the place all of a sudden. First, Charlie decided to sit next to Draco to join Bill’s discussion with Remus and Severus, followed by a visibly exasperated Ginny getting roped into the wedding-cake debate and taking Charlie’s seat. Draco’s mother summoned the house-elves then, telling them to serve a variety of finger-foods Draco knew from countless social functions he’d attended over the years. The snacks were laid out on the same table where the rest of the cake still sat, and within barely a minute, three Weasleys were out of their seats to fill a small plate for themselves. Draco was tempted to follow, if only because one of the three was Bill, meaning that the seat next to Harry was currently free. If he was fast enough—
had somehow managed to distract him. Draco fucking Malfoy and his stupid smirk.
Lord Potter now?” the long-haired Weasley sitting next to Fleur—Bill, Draco remembered—chimed in.
She stared at him wide-eyed. He wasn’t sure how to interpret her tone when she finally asked, “And it works?”
The thought crashed into him like a knockback jinx. Sirius hated Snape. He’d probably have rejected Harry if he’d known. And James— James couldn’t possibly have loved Harry if he’d known.
Was about time Severus came clean about all that. Now Harry just has to accept any of it and give one of those chances Draco is so upset about.
“You didn’t, just— It’s just past dinner time, the corridors are full of students.”
I originally didn’t have this chapter in and thought I’d wrap that conversation up as a sort of flashback, but then decided that it’s a bit of a stretch to let so much time pass until they talk.
Harry smiled. “Hey, sweetheart.” He glanced at the bed and arched his eyebrow. “Missed me, huh?”
Harry had gone motionless just a second before Draco’s fingers had reached his back, before he’d felt—
“Yes, there is. I betrayed you, otherwise the vow wouldn’t have been broken. Whether I acted out of good intentions or not, I still broke your trust, and for that I am truly sorry. Please, Harry, can you forgive me?”
“Yeah, okay.” A flicker of uncertainty clouds Potter’s eyes.
“Well,” said Remus, grinning broadly as he set his glass down, “I’m already exhausted, but you should be fresh as a daisy.”
Remus looked at him in mild confusion.
The second floor had clearly not been renovated yet. He didn’t see much merit in digging through the chaos and moved on quickly.
“Yes! Just— Just leave me alone for a while, please?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wards. Burning. Feels like injury,” Harry replied without stopping. He practically flew down the last few steps into the entrance hall, where he found himself staring at—
Harry’s eyes glittered with curiosity as he followed Severus through the living area. Severus halted in front of the door on the left that led to Harry’s new bedroom and motioned for Harry to go on and open it. He heard his son suck in a sharp breath when he saw the room beyond and Draco’s jaw dropped.
Walls formed from white mist and suddenly he found himself in a room, Dumbledore standing a few steps away from him, smiling.
Severus’ eyebrows shot up. Teach him? That was new. One look at Harry’s face confirmed that Harry was rather sceptical about this proclamation as well.
He screamed when the first Cruciatus curse hit, pulling against his restraints. They might as well have been made from steel, so unyieldingly did they hold him in place. The spell ended, and Severus tried to catch his breath. His vision was blurry, but he could make out enough to see the Dark Lord move away, then return with something shiny in his hands.
Draco hesitated for a split-second, hovering over Harry’s hard cock, before taking the plunge and wrapping his lips around the tip. It tasted salty. Harry gave a guttural moan above him and his fingers tightened in Draco’s hair. Draco decided to take it as a positive sign.
“But I’m disgusting,” Harry murmured against his neck.
“We will protect you,” Severus said firmly.
“I’m sure the potion is just fine, I am merely worried about Severus. It’s rather unconventional for You-Know-Who to have Death Eater meetings in the middle of the day.”
“My gran is ecstatic that we’re friends,” said Neville. “You should hear how she talks about you, I’d almost call her a fan.“
“He told me he didn’t ask for my company and I should leave. When I asked him about our Occlumency lesson he answered that tomorrow would suffice and I should meet him in the library for it. Then he slammed the door in my face.”
Draco was long done with eating when Severus finally approached the sixth year Slytherins to hand out their schedules. After several long, agonising minutes spent debating with Vince and Greg, Severus sighed and requested that the two see him in his office later and moved on to Blaise, whose class choices were approved of in under thirty seconds.
“They’re not worth going to Azkaban for,” he replied, returning Draco’s embrace and running a soothing hand up and down his boyfriend’s back. “I’d rather have you with me than locked up for an unnecessary case of triple-murder.”
“I promise I’ll be okay, Draco,” Harry whispered. “You won’t lose me, alright?”
Severus frowned slightly, but eventually hummed in acknowledgement.
After Harry’s sudden relapse into hiding the previous Saturday, his mood had taken an inexplicable turn for the better on Sunday morning. So much so, that he hadn’t even questioned Severus, when he’d boldly returned to Harry’s room for their Occlumency lesson that evening, instead of calling him down to the library as before. To Severus’ surprise, Harry hadn’t just allowed him into his room, he’d also been willing to discuss healing magic again, which lead to them spending the better part of two hours going over spell-theory and even a fair amount of potions. They had done the same, albeit not as long, every evening since.
Harry rolled his eyes and turned back to face Draco, putting his hands around the other boy’s face.
Finally, Harry set down his cup and turned to face Remus again. “I want you to tell me everything. Every word Dumbledore said, everything you know.” Harry’s voice was hard and his eyes gleamed with determination.
Molly’s face turned red as she opened her mouth to retort but, to Severus’ surprise, Charlie jumped in before she could say another word.
He only nodded in response and sat down at the table. If he was lucky, he could eat and disappear again before anyone else came down. Narcissa would leave him alone at least.
“I’m not supposed to tell you,” said Harry. “I’m not supposed to tell anyone at all, actually, though Dumbledore considered making an exception for Ron and Hermione.”
Remus corrected,
More than one person flinched at his tone. Smith and McLaggen were both inspecting their shoes. The sixth year Slytherins were gaping at Harry — with the exception of Draco, whose expression was completely blank.
“So, what did the prophecy say?” Draco asked.
Suddenly, a warm hand covered his and he looked up in surprise. Remus gave him a gentle smile, shaking his head slightly.
“Nobody knows how to be a parent before they become one,” Narcissa replied smoothly, letting go of his hand again.
“I never got the chance, I would’ve done it after the feast or first thing tomorrow. Dad must’ve mentioned it to him.”
“Certainly, Mr Potter,” Burgock keened. “If you would simply sign here—” He waved his hand at the scroll, which grew a few inches, revealing a line for a signature. “—and provide a single drop of blood next to your signature. Yes, right here.”
the Lord Potter. Just relax, Draco and I will pick suitable attire for you—unless of course you have specific wishes?”
to Draco.
As he waited for some time to pass before following Draco, unease settled in Harry’s stomach, and suddenly he didn’t feel like going to breakfast at all. He was anxious to call Remus and ask Narcissa about his three mysterious inheritances. Why had he just ignored them for so long? Had he learnt nothing? By the time Harry was back in the Gryffindor common room — skipping breakfast — his nerves had effectively eradicated his good mood.
“Draco, there are Blood-Replenishing potions in Severus’ lab, get them,” he said, not wanting to risk shattering the vials by summoning them from the second floor.
“Not now, just tell me what you want!” Harry hated himself for rejecting the man so blatantly, after everything he’d done for him. After another short silence, Remus spoke again, his voice remarkably neutral.
“Thank you. First I want to know what happened to the others, though. Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, and Neville. Are they alright?”
“Watch it,” Potter hissed angrily, green eyes piercing.
“Can I…?”
“No,” he answered thoughtfully, “I don’t think he hates you. He’s confused about it all, he went through a lot in the past—well, his entire life I suppose. You know all the things that happened each year at Hogwarts, and then the Tournament and Voldemort, seeing Cedric Diggory die, the slander the Ministry put him through this past year. It’s a lot for a boy his age. And while I don’t know much about his time before Hogwarts, judging from how he speaks about his relatives—you know, calling them ’the Dursleys’ and such—he wasn’t particularly happy there either. He was very attached to Sirius, he was the first sort-of father Harry ever had. He’s grieving that more than anything else at the moment. He asked me if Sirius would hate him, if he knew.”
say,” replied Harry flatly. “And it’s hardly proof. If I remember correctly, you yourself thought I looked like Sirius first, so it can’t be
The box was filled with all sorts of things—from Gryffindor scarves to closed bottles of Butterbeer that had expired ages ago—but Harry was mostly drawn to the countless letters covering the bottom of it.
“Oh.” Harry felt a slight twinge of guilt about never helping Narcissa with cooking, he’d assumed that the house-elf did most of the work. “Uhm, yeah, I guess if they stayed here with us and promised not to tell anyone anything about this place or the Order, it would be alright. Would they be able to get through the Fidelius charm?”
“I am capable of non-verbal spells, if that’s what you’re asking.”
“That’d be me,” Severus answered in Harry’s stead, his voice silky and dark.
“Well, for one my previous treatment of him. Unfortunately, there is no better explanation than the fact that these charms made him look and act and sound exactly like James Potter, and my old resentment for his would-be father got the better of me. I have no excuse. Still, I want to explain it. Then there’s how I’ve treated his classmates, which is a bit more complicated. There are specific reasons for some of them, but there’s also the simple fact that I was always aware that the Dark Lord would eventually return and Albus would want me to return to my position as a spy. Better to have a reputation for favouring pure-blood Slytherins and bullying muggleborns and children of former Order members.”
“May I see?” Harry asked curiously, and Draco could relate to the sentiment. He was itching to see that scroll for himself, too. Burgock handed the scroll to Harry, who unrolled it and held it out so Draco could read as well. For a split second, Draco was distracted by Harry’s automatic consideration to include him, it made him feel all sorts of weird and soft. However, when Harry suddenly gasped, his eyes flew back to the scroll and he began to read.
, he chided himself. This was not the time for full moon nonsense. Nevertheless, for the rest of their meal he found himself keeping his eyes on Severus far more than usual.
“Well, well,” he said with a chuckle, “barely sixteen and Lord of two Noble and Ancient Houses. How does it feel to move up in the world, Potter?”
everyone of it during dinner.”
Hermione slammed into him barely a second after he’d stepped into the Leaky Cauldron, hugging him tightly. He chuckled softly and hugged her back, his eyes finding Ron who was hanging back a little with Ginny.
“Kreacher?” he asked in surprise.
“So, does that mean I can call you Dad now?” he asked cheekily.
“Huh,” Harry hummed. She got what she deserved then.
The rest of his speech centred on the war, reminding the students that the Dark Lord was quickly gaining followers and his ranks were expanding into positions of power. He warned them to be careful, to report anything out of the ordinary to a member of the staff and to obey the rules set by the teachers, for the sake of everyone’s safety. Severus’ eyes found Harry’s again at that point and this time there was a hint of a smile on Harry’s lips. When Albus wrapped up his speech and sent the students to bed, Severus breathed a small sigh of relief.
“I don’t know what to think, Draco. Why do I allegedly inherit
—a facade. We both married each other to please our parents, uphold certain tradition and expectations.”
Remus gave him an odd look, but didn’t comment on his admission. He shook his head. “I’m sure, Harry. Even if Sirius was bisexual instead of gay, he’d never have slept with Lily around the time you were conceived.”
Harry shifted, extracting himself out of Draco’s arms, eliciting an offended grunt from him. He laughed softly, and Draco felt his lips brush briefly against his forehead.
After he had unpacked his suitcase, he sank down at the desk, staring out of the window. It was a grey day in London and he felt that the bleak view of the street in front of the house matched his glum mood rather well.
“I thought of Sirius,” he spat. “Of how he died.”
Severus smiled. Harry would like that, he was certain of it. Turning back to what used to be his unused side-room, he began to conjure furniture, feeling the pull of Hogwarts’ magic as it supplied him with suitable pieces to be transformed. It saved a remarkable amount of strength, and Severus wondered whether the castle always supported this kind of thing, or whether it depended on more complicated factors.
“Hi guys,” she said brightly.
She smiled. “Of course. So, you think I should join this Order of the Phoenix?”
With that she left, closing the door behind her. Severus remained in his chair for a few moments, wondering how Albus would react to Minerva storming his office with questions. He chuckled. Too bad he couldn’t be there to see that, it would be a sight to behold.
wouldn’t stop pestering me.” He glanced back into the staff room, then doubled up the Muffliato surrounding them before continuing to say, “I had five galleons on Mr Malfoy.”
“Harry, how good to see you,” Albus began pleasantly, but Severus talked over him.
His pulse was still racing, so he summoned a book to distract himself with. It didn’t really work. His thoughts kept wandering back to imagining all the possible ways in which Draco might react, the scenarios ranging from appallingly pessimistic to steamy enough to make Harry’s blood flow south. Did Draco’s showers always take that long?
“I’m not,” Harry said. “Last night I ran into Ron and Hermione after you left and they asked me to go out this morning. I totally forgot that we had plans.”
“I was ready before,” Draco said, trying not to grumble lest Potter tease him some more.
He tugged Potter down too, so they were both on their backs staring up at the stars, encapsulated by the surrounding darkness of the night. Amazingly, Potter actually was interested in the constellations, or, at least he was when Draco pointed them out.
Snickering, Harry took on a more serious face. “I was also informed that you’d decided to come to camp,” he admitted. “Since I vouched for you at your trial, I’ve been informed of major life decisions that you’ve made.” At Draco’s horrified face, he chuckled. “Don’t worry, it was only the really big things. Like when you finished school and stuff.”
Potter looked at him, amused. “Ready to start learning the ‘simple’ game of baseball now, Malfoy?”
Unsure of what to do next, Harry flailed until Draco pressed a small bottle into his hand.
Draco lay back and looked up at the sky. “Are you familiar with the constellations, Potter?” he asked.
“Good thing for you that she was around.”
Tears returned to Draco’s eyes, but he willed them away with every bit of self-control he possessed. Malfoy etiquette training came in handy more often than he’d ever expected.
“I tried,” said Draco honestly. “I just couldn’t.”
“Where’s our first stop?” Harry queries.
It was too much. Words of sympathy, which he hadn’t heard from anyone lately, were too much. Especially coming from
“Excuse me?” he demands, whirling around. “It’s bloody mutual; you’re not forcing me into anything!”
Harry pushed himself off of the floor and stormed out of the room, much to Cale’s and Chris’s amusement. And if he did use the brief ten minute shower to rub one out, no one had to be any the wiser, did they?
“So, what now?”
"We can't let those bastards get away with stealing our territory again!" Harry swore, hands curling into fists.
“‘Squatting?’” Harry inquired doubtfully.
“I did heal it,” hissed Draco once Slughorn continued on his merry way, unfortunately confirming her suspicions. He threw three cups of lacewings into their cauldron, one more than Slughorn’s instructions called for, and added in two drops of lavender essential oil on nothing but a whim.
“You know, Hermione, I can still smell the mold under the sink,” Draco’s voice echoed down the hallway. “The next time that we go to the store, I think we should pick up something stronger. The Lysol just doesn’t seem to cut it—” he walked into the kitchen and stopped short when he saw Harry there, fear, joy, and nervousness passing over his visage at once. “Harry?”
“Glad to hear it, Granger. If Potter wakes up, don’t give him any more Dreamless Sleep. I don’t want to take any chance that he might become addicted to the stuff.”
Potter cuffed his shoulder, drawing Draco in for a bro hug. “Come off it, you wanker,” he said, almost fondly. “I’m happy to help whenever you want.”
“If you’re sure,” hedged Harry, taking Draco’s hands in his own.
“Nor is it for me, Potter,” Draco laughed, lightened by the clarification. “Now where were we?”
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
“I don’t think the public will ever see me in a different light,” Draco said. “My reputation precedes me.”
He cleared his throat. “Say, Granger—Slughorn doesn’t mind if we work in partners for the assignments. Did you want to show me your technique up close?”
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
It was still only just the beginning of the third week of the semester, and Draco was bored shitless, as the Americans would say. There was simply nothing left to do. When he was more forgiving than usual, Draco hung out with Steve. He quickly decided his roommate was most effective in small doses; say, a half an hour once or twice a week. Research for Debate Club could be completed in 2 or so hours, and Draco was absolutely unwilling to make a commitment to another club. After completing everything on each of his class syllabi three weeks in advance, Draco gave in and went to his professors’ office hours.
Seamus smirks. “Oh, you’ll see.” He grasps Harry’s arm above the elbow and spins on the spot to initiate Apparation. After regaining his bearings, Harry discovers that they’d landed in the middle of a very high class business district, filled with Arguers and private Healers. At the end of the row, there is a cream colored square building decorated with tasteful peacock feathers. Though in any other setting the decor would have looked tacky, it works in this situation. Seamus makes for the front door, Harry right behind.
“Because if you turn around to the left, then you’re theoretically in fair territory and you can be tagged out. But if you turn to the right, you’re in foul, and are safe until you get back on the bag again.”

OCTOBER 1998
Exchanging an exasperated look, Draco and Mike wordlessly decide that Mike’s going first, and Draco takes a few steps away as to not crowd him at the position. The ball had been hit to third base, so Mike doesn’t really have any action until the ball’s hit into far right center field and he has to go out for the cut off throw. Draco watches appreciatively as Harry retrieves the ball and hurtles it to Mike, his arm muscles rippling gloriously.
“And now one for you, Draco,” she said, shifting gears unexpectedly. “On that same note, in clear conscious, how can you ask the Saviour to love you after the role you played in the War?”
“Harry,” said Ron. "You
“Not only are you a good partner, you’re a really good top,” Harry said playfully.
again just as much as he did.
Draco found himself chuckling. “Father tried once, but his intentions were quelled once Mother cottoned on.”
Chris and Cale had been lurking on the outskirts of the conflict with Betty Lou, but Draco heard Cale give a low, appreciative whistle. As he looked over, he could see Potter furiously stomping around the parking lot with Nels in tow.
The cold seemed to seep into the flat through the windows, and, from there, right into Draco’s bones. He cast three industrial-strength Warming Charms, even though he was still frighteningly cold after each one, and finally resorted to stuffing towels under the door cracks and putting thin plastic up over the windows. Nothing helped. Eventually, Draco put on one of Potter’s horrible, hideous Christmas sweaters and went to hide under a blanket on the sofa. He studied for his Potions exam until Harry came barreling in the door two hours later.
Five seconds later, Granger and the Weasel were climbing out of their fireplace, hastily dusting off the ash.
“Why are we stopping?” asked Ron.
Beaming, Malfoy accepted Cecelia’s offer. “I must say that I actually want to produce something proper this time,” he sniffed, examining one of the delicate lace doilies decorating the window display. “Before, you contented me with making short rows that ultimately turned into a triangle.”
“That’s one way to put it,” snorts Harry. “Come through. I just made coffee.”
After sending the final letter, Draco fell on the sofa, breathing deeply, already falling into despair. After an hour, he was able to tear himself off of the sofa, tear-stained and aching, and amble over to the Floo to firecall Hermione.
“What about the balls that are kind of in-between positions?” asked Ange, the most inexperienced of the three.
Furiously, he swiped at his hair to dislodge the glass gathered there. He was reminded of his nakedness as he swung around to face Harry, who seemed supremely unaffected by Draco’s tantrum. “Obviously I’m still not good enough, alright? I couldn’t tell you before, because how could I ruin your happy notions that life is getting better for us?!” He picked up another glass ornament and, on second thought, hurtled it at the opposite wall that was much further away. The shower of glass didn’t placate him in the slightest.
Predictably, Zee opened his mouth and went to protest, but Nate silenced him with one sharp look. “Harry has faith in you,” he smiled, doing a quick once over of Malfoy’s body. “And I can almost see what he means. Do you want to give it a go, Draco?” he asked almost excitedly. “Maybe we can make this work.”
In a rare display of affection, Draco threw himself at Harry, nuzzling into the crook between his neck and shoulder. “You’re so good to me,” he said brokenly. “I don’t deserve you.”
Against his will, Draco burst out laughing. “Potter, will you ever get enough?” he cried, trying to come up with something—anything—to use as a retort.
At first, he was just glad to find that he hadn’t Splinched himself. But then, as he looked around, Harry realized that perhaps his id had wrested away too much control. But having agency was a curious thing, and he had, as of late, been unable to shake the feeling that he was watching his life pass him by. How queer that his inner Self chose this specific place to recalibrate his senses.
before I realized it.”

Draco winced. He’d been on the receiving end of Potter’s beatings a couple of times and could definitely attest to his skill in that regard.
“Actually,” Draco said, “I’m looking for a place that has palm trees like here but isn’t so bloody hot and humid. I don’t suppose you’d know of one?”
“Oi, Malfoy. I’m still not done yet. We’ve been driving around for hours and still haven’t come across anything for rent–”
Harry was touched. He met Draco’s eyes and could see his own wonder and surprise reflected within them.
The next morning, Harry wakes while it’s not yet light outside. He loves the feeling of Draco pressed firmly against him, still intertwined tightly around his body. Focusing on the wonderful love-making they’d done the night before, Harry tries to chase away memories of Asten and the rape. He sits quietly for a good half an hour, unable to come to any sort of closure. Finally, just before dawn, he wakes Draco up. “Love,” he whispers, stroking Draco’s hair lavishly and nudging his shoulder. “Wake up.”
“Good plan,” she said, nodding approval. “You’ll have a lot more open to you in terms of jobs. I’d try to get into a 4 year University if you can, though you can do the first two years at a junior college if really necessary. Anyways, nice chatting with you, but my shift’s about to start.”

“Thanks a lot. You’re making me fantastically better here, Longbottom.”
. They were squashed together on a small sofa in what was supposedly the
“I know, you great oaf,” said Draco affectionately, returning the kiss. “I love you too. And I actually did quite like it. But in bed only,” he said, cheeks flushing again. Harry grinned, and Draco rolled his eyes before scooting over and nuzzled himself into the crease between Harry’s neck and chest.
The first mile went quickly; even though Draco wanted to wait until he was properly warmed up to start jogging, he needed an outlet for all the compressed energy brimming within. The truth was, Draco treasured their exchange. He loved telling Harry about his week and hearing about Harry’s in return. Sometimes they veered away from events and talked about everything from movies to the meaning of life. It was refreshing, because Harry had such a different perspective than Draco did. He was also fun to debate, as—gasp—he
“Good,” he said mushily, leaning down to kiss Draco. “I don’t think I’d have it any other way.”
Harry was first over and started reaching for number 0. “Ah ah ah,” said Nate, snatching it back out of his hands. “Nels always takes 0, and it’s too small for you anyway.”
“Malfoy!” Potter grinned, running out of the house without closing the door to launch himself at Draco for a giant bear hug. “My letter came today! This next year is going to be fantastic, we’ll be teaching together, graduating together.” Draco held Harry tightly, clutching at his neck as though they’d never see each other again. Taking Draco’s intimate embrace for excitement, Harry whispered, “Merlin, Draco, things are finally going right for a change.”
Draco snorted. “Have you finally learned to think before you speak, Potter? Does your renewed friendship with Granger change what you said to me earlier today?” he asked. “That you—that you love me.”
As Draco came close to climax, he was unable to keep his mental barriers up. He’d heard rumors about Potter’s lack of skill with Legilimency, so he wasn’t too worried about what Potter might be able to access should he happen to tap into Draco’s subconscious. There was something slightly different about Potter’s face, but Draco didn’t have time to consider it as he let go entirely when Potter pushed him over the edge, driving into his prostate with force yet still holding Draco tenderly as though giving him this pleasure was the most important thing in the world to him.

They made it to the lab right on time, and Draco temporarily forgot his tiredness as he and Hermione were forced to put forth their full concentration to brew the difficult Potion being asked of them. Draco liked brewing, and he liked a challenge, so he was no longer grumpy by the end of the class. He went home anyway, though, because he still needed some rest before tackling the rest of the day’s demands.
, Draco finally remembered – came careening down the road straight over the patch of grass in-between the street and the lane and directly at him. Panicking, Draco dove off the strip towards the nearest tree, attempting to put it between himself and the driver.
Malfoy choked. “Excuse me, what did you say?”

“And you somehow didn’t think to mention all of this to me?” Hermione hisses, stomping over to the Floo.
Draco suspected that she approached the whole affair academically to put distance in front of the reality of his choice, which he already knew she disapproved of. Setting his fork down crisply, he said, “I made the choice that was the most sensible for the both of us. To choose otherwise would only enable the continuation of a mass delusion, one that we’ve indulged in for far too long.”
“Er, did you mean ‘fuck you’?” asked Potter helpfully.
“We’ve exchanged a few letters over the past couple months; things more or less went back to normal after he apologized to you for being such a prat.”

The words almost slipped out, then.
Draco’s attention snapped back to Fred, except Fred was busy chewing on a bite of cake and it had been George who’d said Draco’s name.

dangerous. He did his best to ignore it.
“So,” Hermione began hesitantly, but Ron cut her off, blurting out, “You and Malfoy called it quits again then? I can’t say I’m surprised, he’s—”
“Afraid so,” he said, and filled them in on the prophecy. As expected, they were shocked.
Following this initial run-in between the two, things got heated quite quickly. Within barely more than a day they were back to shoves, tripping-jinxes, and murmured “prat” and “git” whenever they passed each other.
“Shall we go to your vaults then?” the goblin asked eagerly.
. It felt like—” He hesitated, swallowed heavily, looked up at Draco with anxious eyes. “It felt like before I changed. He looked at me like he used to when he hated me. He sounded like he’s gone right back to hating me.”
Narcissa glanced at the grandfather clock at the wall and said quietly, “They should have arrived now.”
With that she left, her footsteps echoing from the staircase. Harry listened as the steps grew fainter and fainter, until he sat in silence at the kitchen table, alone.

“You apologised. To Harry. And he accepted it?”
“You’ll be safe, right? I can trust you to be careful with—”

“Impressive,” Harry said admiringly as he inspected the products. “What’s that?”
“The point,” said Harry, “is that now you get suggestions for designs that match your taste!”
Eventually, she gave him a worried look and asked, “So, how are you really doing?”
“Good,” said Albus, seeming satisfied.
“But,” Harry continued, before the Weasel could counter, “that’s not the thing that I meant to tell you. I’m assuming you two have already told everyone that James Potter isn’t my father, otherwise they’d have asked me why I look so different all of a sudden.”
“Actually,” Remus chimed in, “I had an idea. If I recall correctly, both of you play Quidditch. I thought you might want to go flying?”
Narcissa turned back to Harry and grimaced. “You look just like Severus when he was your age. Not entirely, of course, but there are some obvious resemblances. I’ve had the thought before, when I first saw you, but it didn’t make any sense. I suppose now it does.”
