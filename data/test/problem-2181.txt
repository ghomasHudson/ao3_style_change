But after everyone had taken their food their chatter fell to small talk; Harry saw Hermione nudge Ron. And they argued for a little while before Ron eventually stood up, and everyone’s eyes fell on him, Harry could see Ron sweat profusely from standing in front of his entire family all staring at him. “I- uh,” He started but looked down at Hermione who nodded at him to continue, “On the topics of…” Ron trailed off once again, before slowly saying, “Grandkids,” while staring at Hermione, “Hermione is-” but he didn’t get to finish before Ginny slammed her hands on the table, stood up so fast her chair fell to the ground and screamed, “NO WAY!” Ron stared at her in shock and she slowly picked her chair up again and fell back onto her seat, “Pregnant,” Ron finished, looking around nervously, Ginny stood up again and, in a hurry, and ran around the table to hug Hermione, and Ron. Soon the entire family followed all-embracing Hermione and Ron, exciting chatter all around, “Lovely, lovely, dears,” Molly came around and hugged both Ron and Hermione, “When will they come along then?” She asked, “Middle of July,” Hermione smiled, but she wasn’t looking at Molly who asked the question or the rest of the family either for what it is, she was staring at Ron, looking at him with so much love Harry felt like he was intruding, and he was the only one still sitting.
“I can keep my eyes off him thank you very much. I think he’ll handle just fine without me, can I tell you something?” He asked her as they left the campus for the bus, “Sure” she shrugged “I’ve known him since we were 11, we were… not on good terms”, he settled on because that the thing with it really, they weren't really enemies? Sure they disliked each other a lot but, was it really that bad? He didn’t think so.“How come?” She asks catching his attention once again. “I told you about how I was a brat when I was younger? Yeah, that.” Sabrina just nodded quietly as the bus approached. “But you’ve gotten along so well the last weeks, isn’t that behind you?” And when Draco shook his head she sighed. “You’re hopeless Draco” and after that, they fell silent.
Parkinson gave Harry a small smile and bowed down beside Draco “Draco,” Parkinson said gently Draco shook his head so violently it hit the wall, “We need to get him out of here pronto Parkinson!” Harry hurried her, “I know, I know!,” Parkinson started to dig in her pockets and pulled out a small flask, “what’s that?” Harry asked, stopping her from pouring it into Draco’s mouth she signed at him, “calming drought,” she gave him a look, “can I give it to him yet?” Harry nodded in embarrassment realizing he thought Pansy would poison her best friend. But Draco struggled against her, it didn’t seem to matter how much she tried to assure him that she’d never hurt him at that it was Pansy, Harry couldn’t just look on. “Let me try?” Harry held out his hand for the flask, Parkinson signed and gave to him but stayed seated on the floor beside Draco.
“Yes,” Draco answered the firecall he was getting it was very sudden and he had to get out of the ongoing shower to be able to answer it. His mother’s face showed up in the fireplace and smiled sweetly at him. “Draco dear, hello” She greeted him. “Yes, mother, hello”
He remembers being around 7 years old wandering around the castle as his parents are holding a ball.
Waking up in a bed damped by salty tears has never been pleasant. But it had to do. He groaned and sat up and took a deep breath. He was fine. He tried to convince himself. He stared blindly at his earphones that he must have pulled off in his sleep. He grabbed his phone together with the headphones, his phone charger and his covers and carried them out to the living room and silently wished that he would have a roommate or a boyfriend that could make him breakfast in now that he was in this horrid mood. But alas, he didn’t. So he made himself toast and hot cocoa before sitting himself down in front of the sofa to watch some random movie on Netflix, he was ready to ignore the world for an entire day. He didn’t want to meet anyone at any time today, no thank you.
Just two days later Malfoy went into the muggle café Harry works at. He did buy a coffee and sat down by the windows with a computer, which Harry found weird as well but he kept himself unseen in the back while Malfoy was there.
Out of nowhere, they heard an apparition pop and both of them were on their feet, hands already on their wands. But Teddy just calmly looked up from his drawing and said, “Is great auntie here now?” Andromeda smiled at her grandchild, “I don’t know darling, shall we go check?” Andromeda and Teddy went out into the hallway to greet Narcissa, Malfoy went to pour himself some more wine.
Someone help me. He prayed as he laid down on his sofa again, deciding that, he was not going to get up until he really needed too.
He remembers being 13 years old and scared to death by the Dementors guarding the castle, yet acting so confident, he remembers dressing up as one to scare Potter, and of course, he remembers the boggart.
It stayed like that, Malfoy and his friends came in every Friday and Malfoy stayed until closing so when they didn’t show up on Friday in late November he was worried. And the week afterwards the rest of the gang showed up but not Malfoy and if Harry was honest he had gotten used to Malfoy’s company even though they just talked as Harry cleaned and sometimes walked home together.
And as he smiles at it he can't quite believe that he's still alive, after all, that he's been through. For maybe this life he has lived was a blessing in disguise, as clichè as that might be. Draco smiles to himself as he stared down at the wand in his hands, for all the good, and the bad.
Teddy released him in order for him to take off his cloak and shoes, for those were the rules. Before dragging him into the living room where both his mother and Potter was sat in silence.
“And if it’s just a friend crush, why are you feeling like this? Why are you beating yourself up about this?” - Ronald Weasley.
He remembers being 15 years old, Voldemort was back and he knew, he could not tell anyone or the family reputation will crumble once again. His father had told him.
By the time the countdown was happening Draco and Kevin turned back to the rest of the group and together, everyone present counted down together:
If you've decided to read the previous chapter again you might've noticed I went back and changed a thing, now you see, Draco has a drivings license. I realised I don't know the traffic laws of Britain and doesn't even have a driving license myself, just a minor change, mostly due to the fact that I have no idea how to write it.
He watched Draco put on light make-up and went to change. If he thought Draco looked incredible when he walked into the café it was nothing on how he looked when he came out from his bedroom and looked at Harry with almost pity, “you can’t go to a party like that” Harry rolled his eyes, “unless you’re gonna lend me some clothes I am,” Draco shook his head, “we’re going to your house, you won’t fit in my clothes,” Draco insisted and Harry rolled his eyes, knowing it wasn’t worth fighting him. He would’ve protested had he lived more than 10 minutes away.
He ate the cereal standing, or well, leaned against the counter and tried to blink himself awake. When he was done he simply put his bowl down in the sink, deciding that, that was a problem for future him, slowly packing his bag and heading for his bus.
The evening came faster than Draco had anticipated, and the time came to take the bus to the place Pansy had rented to have the new year’s party in, with him he brought his earphones, earphones and credit card, ready to take a taxi home if he had to. Pulling up messager he messaged Pansy that he was on the bus before plugging his earphones in and disappearing into the world of imagination. The music sounded a long way and through Draco’s earphones, as the bus drove closer to the place Pansy had rented, and Draco walked up to it, there were so many people in there, pressing bodies together like it was that or death.
They decided to go to Draco’s apartment after lunch to hang out and get ready for the party. They played cards and watered Draco’s plants, they had a sarcastic show off that ended up as a playful wrestling fight.
“Malfoy?” Draco turned around and looked at him, he was to steps down and Draco felt so much taller than he was looking down at Potter. “What?” he answered rather softly. “Sabrina came in yesterday…” Potter stepped up the two steps as we talked but kept on holding onto his sleeve. “She seemed upset and I was wondering if you knew anything about it?” They were standing so close Draco could feel Potter breathing at him but found it hard to meet his eyes. Maybe because he knew exactly why Sabrina was upset, maybe because they were too close. He looked down at Potter’s hand grabbing his sleeve, holding onto it tightly as he was afraid Draco would run away, which happened to be exactly what Draco wanted to do.
He was quickly led into the crowded living room, Bill and Fleur had brought their two daughters Victoire and Dominique, who were five and two. And Percy had brought his daughter, Molly II who’s 3 as well as his very pregnant wife Audrey. Harry saw Charlie chilling in the corner was well and gave him a wave, he smiled and waved back. “Harry nice to see you again,” Molly had quickly greeted him with a hug before returning to the kitchen cooking tons of food. “You holding up alright Molly?” Harry said, looking over the 10 meals being cooked at the same time. “Yes, yes, dear, can you fetch Ron for me?” She waved him away to do so. “Um, Ron, Molly wants you in the kitchen,” Harry walked over to the sofa to which everyone had retreated to after they’d greeted him. “Jesus Christ, okay,” Ron sighed and disappeared to the kitchen.
He walked over to the little package that Draco had given him them in. It was still heavy. Harry realised, there must be another. Otherwise, Narcissa couldn’t be wearing an identical stone to Draco’s. He lifted the silk that surrounded them and indeed, there was another one, glaring up at him just as cruelly as the other one had, he picked it up and immediately read the bottom line:
“How old is he again?” She asked, accepting that he wasn’t going this week either. “Seven” Draco muttered. Staring out coldly in the rain. “Besides, the barista that you want me to meet again so badly is going to be there” he inspected his nails as he spoke. In reality, it was no big deal that Potter was going to be there, he was Terry's godfather after all. “Why? You guys aren't cousins? Right? Because sorry Draco, but that'd be disgusting” he made puking sounds behind him. “No, we're not cousins. Potter is Teddy's godfather, so, yeah” Sabrina hmed again behind him before standing, he heard her shoes move against the pavement, a short walk of three steps towards him.
When Andromeda then emerged from her room an hour later, she looked very what he assumed to be ‘traditional’ for wizards and suddenly felt very out of place knowing that he’d be way too underdressed. “Grandma, should I put on my dress robes yet?” Teddy asked her when he spotted her from his chair in the kitchen. “If you want,” The woman replied, and Teddy nodded and walked up to his room in obediently. Andromeda nodded smiling towards Harry before following Teddy up the stairs.
“So it’s a good thing?” Draco asked, browsing his phone. “No! Yeah? Kinda… Does he follow you, he has to follow you,” Before Pansy could start on her frantic rant Draco stopped her “Yep he does.” Draco nodded, only half listening to her.
“At least one,” said Aubrey fondly stroking her belly, “But I wish for her to get out already if I’m honest,” she ended her fond look and patted it before asking for food. And Molly called out for everyone to start the chatter and the plates filling became instant.
“Nothing, nothing,” George said in defeat and walked over to the kitchen to ask if he can help with anything. “At least she has Ronald,” Hermione sighed and rested her head on Harry’s shoulder after he sat down next to her, “The only one who can actually cook anything but basics,” Bill said looking up from playing with his kids on the carpet. Charlie snorted, “Yeah, I think Ron took all of our combined cooking skills,”
Though the chapters are usually around 2 pages and this one is like... 7 pages so... enjoy. I gotta get back to those very intense studying sessions :'))
“You’re that barista Draco has an oh so complicated background with, right?” Harry shrugged “I suppose” like the bookstore employee was brought back to life she looked between them and up to the section they were in, then putting on her obligatory smile again she asked them, “Are you looking for yourself or someone else?” Hermione looked down at the book in her hands “Myself actually” she said it like it was a big wonder it was, which it might be as well. “I’m just here for moral support” Harry quickly added so the girl wouldn’t assume else.
“It’s very you I suppose,” He told her while she was busy looking through one, Hermione nodding in thought. “I think this one will be good, want to get something to read?” when Harry shook his head she snickered a little bit “You know, Draco told he they have a full section of gay pornography in the back”
Ron tilts her head back up to look at him, he’s extremely close, only about an inch or two apart and whispers: “You’re lucky that you’re the best at literally everything else” before pecking her lips quickly before going to sit in the living room again, having finally learned how to work a tv. “You guys are so disgustingly in love Hermione I can barely stand you guys.” Hermione giggled beside him, “Well why don’t you go out and find someone you can be so disgustingly in love with?” she then asked, suddenly looking way to curious and determined to find out.
“I am going to babysit my cousin okay” He waved her off as he leaned on the wall to the booth. It was raining heavily and he almost regretted deciding to take the train instead of apparating. “You can’t use your family as an excuse to not come with us and study every time. Give up darling,” she cooed. “First of all, I’m not using them as an excuse, and second of all. I’m taking a train for three hours to go see my aunt and my little cousin whom I haven’t seen in a month.” Sabrina hmed and sat herself down on the bench in the booth.
“Uncle Draco is here!” Teddy screamed into the kitchen. “I've gathered, darling” He heard Andromeda answer sweetly. “Oh, you look horrible, let me help you,” she said poking her head out from the kitchen. And so with a swift of her wand, Draco was dry and Teddy attacked him, almost making him fall over. Draco just laughed and hugged back. “Thanks, aunt” he nodded towards Andromeda who gave him a thumbs up and went back into the kitchen.
“How did you tell him?” Fleur asks, Hermione turns to her, “I gave him a book,” she said, Ron kissed her temple, “Very her,” He commented. “Well I’m sure you’ll be a great father,” Molly said and smiled at her youngest son who thanked her, “But be sure to cook all the food,” George joked, and Ron laughed, “Oh I’ll be sure to,” he nudged Hermione playfully who hit him back.
Hermione, not knowing what to do dragged him into a dark alley where so no one was I sight and apparated to Harry’s flat.
“So,” Potter said after a pained minute of silence. “Been busy eh?” he asked not turning away from the window. “Let's skip this goddamn small talk Potter” Potter turning towards him, “What shall we talk about then huh, it's not like we have anything in common, now do we?”
Draco looked over at Kevin who gave him a pointed look, Kevin was the only other magical person in his university friend group, they had actually been in the same year, a thing Draco hadn’t really noticed until Kevin told him so, himself.
he thinks, there are a few seats by the countertop so why not. A pling from his phone gets his attention back to his desk again.
Harry puts the presents in the pile, after he charmed them to the right sizes, of course. And sits down between Draco and Teddy, Teddy who soon rushed up to give out the presents to everyone. Teddy, of course, ending up with the most, since he was the youngest but also probably the easiest to buy for, Harry himself had gotten him three while he’d gotten the others one.
“You’re one of both Hermione’s and my best friends and we’ve seen how you act with Teddy and, um, would like you to be the godfather to our child as well? if you want I mean…”
Also, I wanted to clear something up, since I didn't write Molly having the best reaction to Ginny being together with Luna. So the thing is, she isn't homophobic... she's a little confused but will have the spirit eventually.
Long story short, I have now made a proper plot so we're all good, I have some nice guidelines to follow and stuff. I can make no excuses lmao, one thing for sure, there probably won't be one next week, unless I'm procrastinating to study for my tests will say, oof.
Andromeda came out and served the dinner and the boys fell silent and kept to just glance at each other when the other wasn’t looking. Harry felt the room getting hotter by the minute, maybe it was the good food, maybe it was the company, either way, excuse his French, holy shit.
After much looking Draco’s hand finally found what it was looking for. “I found these in the manor the last time I visited,” Draco explained when Harry gave him a curious look, he took out what to the eye looked like any folder, “I’ve always been curious about the history behind magical families,” Harry nodded while Draco browsed, clearly looking for something specific, “Aha,” he said in triumph and gave Harry the folder.
“I am not having this conversation with you right now Herm, how’s the baby getting along?” Harry counters while pouring up half of the food he made in a lunch box and the rest on a plate. “Hey don’t change the subject like that!”
“No, but when you’re dressed like that you’re either trying to impress someone or going somewhere important,” she says as they together round the last corner only to see the bus driving away, “fuck,” Draco whispers stopping in his tracks, Pansy stopping beside him obviously thinking hard about something. She follows him up to the bus stop. “The next one will be here in 10 minutes, Potter will be fine for another 20 min, won’t he?” Draco sits down on the bench beside the bus stop and shrugs. “But how will I survive,” Pansy says dramatically, attempting to mimic Draco’s voice, Draco glares at her and Pansy laughs at him and takes out a cigarette from her purse.
Now the blue-haired guy was back in the kitchen with the other guy behind him, he was ever so close to Draco, either about to kiss the other dude or to have a very private conversation. The blue-haired guy trying to take Draco’s drink away from him. At this point, Harry had to step forward.
“He’s my childhood friend, though brought up to believe all the pure-blood stuff, so was I, by the way, he was forced into becoming a death eater by his father, who’s in prison right now. He got freed from all charges because none other than Harry Potter pleated him not guilty” Pansy smiled at Sabrina and then glanced up at Draco.
It was late and Draco had been writing essays for HOURS and finally, he was done. He had been distracted the whole time, if it wasn’t for this trait of overthinking everything and Pansy constantly messaging him about nothing then maybe he would’ve been done two hours ago.
“Go on, it’ll be fine, but if you really mess up, you’ll just get to the manor, please stay in my apartment until I’ve gotten there so I know you came right,” Draco fussed and almost pushed Harry into the fireplace. “Alright, alright,” Harry gave up and took his boots and jacked in one hand so he could take floopowder into the other. “And then you say ‘Malfoy apartment’” Draco nodded at him to continue. Harry took a deep breath. “Malfoy apartment!” He said and flooed away.
After sitting restlessly at the kitchen table for five minutes after that Harry decided to go upstairs to see what was going on, shyly, feeling as he was intruding, he walked up the stairs and looked into Teddy’s bedroom. “Sorry for intruding-” he said politely stepping in, “I was wondering if I could help with anything?” He asked them collectively. “Well I suppose you could start the kettle,” Andromeda replied before looking him up and down. “Do you have anything else to wear? Something more formal?” She then asked sweetly. “Well yes, I’ve got my fancy dress robes with me, didn’t know how fancy this Christmas thing was going to be… Should I go change into it?” Andromeda nodded “Better safe than sorry I’m afraid, haven’t spent Christmas with my family since I was a little girl you see. But don’t change it in case you get food on your robes. I’ll be down in a minute to take over the kitchen but if you start that’d be to great help.” She smiled at him and Harry nodded back and turned around to go back downstairs “The receipts are on the counter!” Andromeda called after him and he felt his nervousness rise the closer the clock ticked until 12 pm. And as he started the several different meals Andromeda had laid out for him; he heard the sound of someone arriving by floopowder and went out to check who it was.
“Harry have you gone completely mad?!” Ron now went around Hermione and shook him, like he first shook him when he came in. “Probably,” Harry said during a short break in the shaking.
He dressed in his normal muggle Christmas clothing but packed some fancy-dress robes just in case, reducio: ed the presents to fit in his backpack that he was bringing and then apparated over to the apparition point closest to Andromeda's house. It was still dark when he got there, he walked out from the alley where the spot was, though that was hard since it was full of knee-deep snow. He stumbled out on the road soaked in snow he looked around him, the neighbourhood was still quiet, and the streetlamps were the only source of light. It looked beautiful, truly. He walked quietly the rest of the way over to Andromeda’s house, hands in his jacket pockets. Some lights were on in the kitchens for breakfast, Christmas was close in Britain. It had been around one and a half month since the last time he was there and somehow the place had gotten so much more beautiful buried in snow. He walked up their driveway seeing a little boy with blue hair sitting at the dining table eating his breakfast. Harry smiled to himself and rang the doorbell, in the corner of his eye he saw Teddy jump up from the table and run out to the hallway, soon the door opened. “Harry!” Teddy squealed and jumped into his arms. Harry hugged him back hard saying “Hey there buddy,” Harry let himself in the opened door and closed it behind him when Andromeda came around the corner in her night robes smiling at them. “Didn’t think you’d show up this early dear, aren’t you usually a late sleeper?”
“Remember when I told you that my brother died at age 16 in a horrible accident?” Draco nodded. “His name was Colin, he was-” Sabrina put the back of her hand to her forehead and sniffed a little bit before taking a deep breath. “He was magic. Just like you people seem to be, he died in a battle at his school, a battle Draco! He was a little kid, he shouldn’t have-” Sabrina shipped after air and tears started to roll down her cheeks, Draco stood from his desk and walked over to where Sabrina was sitting on the couch. He sighs beside her before taking her hand in his and after a couple of seconds, Pansy held Sabrina’s other hand. “Your brother, he, he didn’t die in vain Sabrina,” Sabrina nodded tears streaming down her face. “He wasn’t, he wasn’t supposed to be there, he was underage and-” Sabrina couldn’t finish. “And he was expelled for being muggle-born,” Draco whispered beside her, Sabrina nodded.
He swallowed hard and tried to compose himself, going back to making breakfast. And when he then was leaving for the Weasley’s house he couldn’t help but put on his dad’s stone before apparating away.
“It was weird and awkward and Narcissa and Andromeda had an argument, so that was nice,” Ginny snorted, “Was it like,” She started, gesturing big with her arms, “blood-purist vs. a good person smackdown?”
“Hey,” Harry had come up behind him, Draco had almost jumped, “Hi,” He replied looking at his friends who, almost together said, “The barista!” to which Harry couldn’t help but chuckle.
“That’s nice of you!” Harry yelled from the hallway, Draco coming out to the hallway, hands on his hips, hushing him, “Teddy is trying to sleep and here you are, yelling across the house,”
“I need alcohol,” Draco said after a while and started to walk at a faster pace towards the house. “That’s not healthy buddy,” Harry said, jogging to come up to Draco’s side again, Draco waved him away.
“I’ll meet you at the next lecture, chill out,” He said and plopped his computer and book down his bag, “Yeah, don’t skip it, and you no longer have a choice but to come to the café afterwards and I hope you know it,” Draco rolled his eyes, “Okay mum,” he said as he put on his jacket and did salute to the rest of the group, “See ya, losers,” and walked out the door.
With one more glance at the ceiling he stands up, admittedly, a little too quickly, he has to hold onto his desk for a moment while his blood pressure goes up again. “More water,” he says to himself before hastily packing his bag with 2 of his school books, a regular book, a notebook, his pencil case along with his computer and charger, throwing in a portable charger to his phone as well.
“No just insecure” Hermione calmly answers and kisses Ron’s forehead before standing up to greet them.
Harry took off the stone to study it further, “But how did you know this was the right one?” he asked running his thumb over the cold stone, “There’s this book that I happened to find in the library at the manor, it said so,” Harry nodded, “But also…” Harry looked up to see Draco innocently biting his lip, “Turn it over,”
“He’ll be fine darling, besides, he can always cancel, right Harry?” Harry looked at her from behind Ron, “I don’t know, maybe, if I’m honest, he seems like a great guy. Haven’t told you guys but he’s been to the café I’m working at to study, usually staying until closing.” Hermione hmed from behind Ron, and Ron, well, shook him some more just for the sake of it. “Hermione, he’s gone mad!”
“They’re upstairs getting Teddy ready,” said Harry, mouth agape. “Right,” Malfoy replied, quickly fixing his robes. Before looking up and smiling at him. “Dressed for muggle Christmas I see,” Making Harry look down at himself, ashamed. “I did take dress robes with me, I’ll have you know,” Harry told him, crossing his arms, turning away and walking towards the kitchen again. Malfoy followed him “Sure you did” he teased behind him, Harry rolled his eyes and returned to the food. “Like a kitchen maid,” Malfoy had commented.
“Students are exhausting,” Neville said, standing up to get another beer. “Promise me one thing Harry,” Neville said, sitting down again, Harry nodded for Neville to go on, “never become a professor,” Harry shrugged, “Listen, I get asked about the snake thing constantly after class it’s become a personality trait,” the rest of them laughed at that, Neville huffing, crossing his arms. “Got it,” Harry smiled,
“Hermione! Is pregnant” Harry stared at him in fake surprise? “Really?!” Ron nodded enthusiastically. “I’m going to be a dad!” Right then Hermione walked through the door “Hi” she waved a little before stepping in. “Hi” Harry waved back as well as he could from the grip that Ron was holding on him right now. “We just came from the doctor, thought we’d stop by,”
I'm back! This early? What! But it's only been 6 days! WOW! I'm really capable of things sometimes, huh.
“Oh hello,” Harry greeted a dusty Draco Malfoy, also dressed in fancy wizarding robes fitting him just right and the colours were just right for his eyes as well as the decoration in the room and Harry looked down at himself and scratched his neck because fuck, why was he like this. “Greetings Potter,” Malfoy replied and cast a cleaning spell on himself and the dust disappeared.
“You want some?” Malfoy asked as he walked by him. “No thank you, not really a wine person” He responds but standing up as well, following Malfoy into the kitchen. Malfoy huffed, “You just haven’t tried the right one yet then.” Harry rolled his eyes, “That’s just what they say” Malfoy raised his eyebrow in challenge “I’m going to make you go wine-tasting with me in France you know”
“Okay, so you dragged me away from the rest of the family for gossip?” Harry shrugged, “Might’ve” Ginny snorted and shook her head, “Luna,” Harry looked happily at her, “Really?” Ginny nodded, clearly amused by the situation at hand, “Okay but, question,” Harry began looking at Ginny gestured for him to go on, “How does that work, don’t you just like either girls or boys?” Ginny raised an eyebrow, “No?”
Malfoy placed his order last and since there was no one after him in the line Harry took the opportunity to chill making Malfoy’s cinnamon latte. Malfoy looked rather uncomfortable as well.
Follow him on Instagram, why the fuck should he do that? He asked himself as he went and did just that.
“Are you doing good, Potter?” she then slowly turns to him, probably sensing his stares. “All good, Mrs Malfoy,” he replies, staring back at her. “Please, call me Narcissa,” she says to him like a reflex, and he nods in reply and continues to eat his food.
“Are you guys going to get married as well?” Molly asked out of nowhere and Ron and Hermione fell silent, smiles falling as they looked at each other, “Not yet,” He quickly commented but added, “But someday, maybe,” mostly to his mothers pleasure, Molly seemed to think that answer was good enough, that or she saw how visibly uncomfortable they both got. “Oh well never mind that then,” She had said, clapping her hands together and her eyes drifted to Harry, “Won’t you be bringing someone next year?”
“Dishwashers are very good inventions right?” Draco said, trying to start up a conversation. There came a quiet “yeah” from where he still stood, by the hallway.
“It’s very stressful but it fine, how’s work? Pansy pissing you off?” Hermione snickered, “Yes” she deadpanned as she stared Parkinson in the soul.
Okay, so! some changes, previously I decided to put some song lyrics in the story however these will be deleted as they don't quite work with the ending I've now come up with. It did with the old one, just not this one hahaha...
“No, well, I’d like for you to bring someone as well, Ginny, a boyfriend would be good for you,” she said, “I have already told you; I’ve already got someone and I’m very happy with her, thank you very much,”
“What’s Malfoy doing here?” Ron asked in a whisper like he was afraid they’d hear when they were on the other side of the restaurant. “I don’t know” Harry groaned. “Maybe he’s here to eat some food with his friends, just like us.” Hermione looked between them. “That’s the only thing that makes sense to me anyway, why else would he be in a restaurant?” “You don’t understand Hermione, he’s EVERYWHERE,” Harry exclaimed.
Then he met Malfoy in the grocery store, this time saw Malfoy saw him as well. Harry remembers the awkward meeting where they just stood and stared at each other until Malfoy pushed past him to get to the vegetable aisle. Not a single word was spoken between them.
When Harry then found himself in a bookstore under the pregnancy section with books labelled ‘We’re gonna have a baby’ or ‘A baby, how it works’ and ‘Babycare’ etcetera he wasn’t really sure what to say.
, Harry thought to himself, “drink this and you’ll feel better okay? We’ll get you out from here,” Draco looked incredibly scared and Harry vaguely remembered his face in the fiendfyre looked similar.
Draco walked out from the bus, fall out boy playing in his earphones, greeting his neighbours in the stairs on his way up to the third floor where he lived. He rather flopped down on his sofa and slept for a little bit than so his homework, he could do neither of those things, however. A ministry official was going to show up in an hour for their last meeting, so he did what Molly Weasley would’ve started doing a week ago, cleaning.
Draco groaned as he put his phone down, “what’s up?” Sabrina asked from beside him. “Nothing, nothing,” Draco said and sat up again. “No, what?” Sabrina continued, “I’m meeting Potter for lunch,” he said tiredly and rubbed his eyes, when he looked around the table he was sitting around with his university friends he saw Kevin looking curiously at him, “What?” he asked, Kevin shrugged, “Nothing,” Draco shrugged back, “Where?” Sabrina said, not looking up from her notebook, “I don’t know man, he’s meeting me outside in 20 min,” Draco replies and stretches and then grins, “Maybe I should start packing my things...” Sabrina looks at him in disappointment, “Draco you can literally write half a page in 20 minutes,” Draco rolled his eyes, still grinning, “You’re underestimating me,” Sabrina looked sideways, “Am I, Draco? Am I?” Draco nodded, “I can write 5 pages in 20 minutes if I really know my shit,” Sabrina raised her eyebrows, “But do you?,” Draco shrugged, “Nope,”
“Also Harry, my mother is expecting you over for Christmas and says you have no choice,” Ron says when they all let go. “Is that a threat?” Harry asked, almost offended. “Knowing my mother, yes.”
“What do you want to watch?” Harry said, on his way to dig out his computer from his bag and take up Netflix.
“Oh so you were serious,” Malfoy said when came back into the kitchen after having left his backpack in the hallway once more. “Yeah,” Harry replied in an exhale. “Looks good” Malfoy gave him a thumbs up and Harry didn’t really know what to do with himself but nodded awkwardly along. He sat down beside Malfoy who sat by the kitchen table sipping a glass of wine. Smiling occasionally at the drawing Teddy was currently drawing. “I’ve never spent Christmas with a pureblood family” Harry suddenly said from nowhere. “The Weasleys are pureblood Potter” Malfoy replied coldly, “A traditional one I mean,” Malfoy sighed beside him, taking another sip of his wine. “It’s not much different from the muggle version of it, you give gifts, eat a fancy dinner and bond with extended family,” Draco took another sip before continuing, “Although, most ‘traditional’ as you like to call them, pureblood families used to have more of a big dance thrown in, although after both wars there aren’t many purebloods left.” Malfoy stopped talking and just stared at the blue-haired boy in front of them both, the silence between them stretching.
Ron let go of him, walked over to his sofa and sat himself down. Harry nodded and went back to the lunch that he was currently making. “What are you making Harry? Smells delicious,” Hermione asked as she looked over his shoulder trying to see what was going on. “Oh, um just a chicken salad.” Hermione hmed from behind him, “must be a spicy one then?” Harry nodded.
“She’s on first-name basis with him?! Ron whispered to Harry, they were still seated around the table with no a single intention to get up. “I guess?” Harry shrugged back.
“So, where were we?” Hermione asked as she sat herself down at the table again. “Malfoy is everywhere?” Ron looked up from having buried his head in his hands. “Oh yeah why don’t we just keep talking about Malfoy” Harry complained.
“Traditionally you only wear the stone if you’re married… but,” Draco trailed off and looked up at his mother who was chatting to Andromeda, wearing an identical stone to Draco’s. “But, what?”
He heard Draco arrive as well and soon he said, “What are you staring at?” Harry turned slowly, looking at Draco, “Your plants,” He stated, Draco raised an eyebrow at him and took out his wand, “Very well,” he said and cleaned the dust of both himself and Harry. And marched away towards the door that Harry assumed lead to the bedroom. He slowly followed Draco and watched as he opened the top left drawer and put his wand in it, fiddling with the Malfoy stone before putting that down as well.
“Oh if it isn’t Draco Malfoy,” Andromeda said when she had come down the stairs to greet the guest. “If it isn’t Andromeda Tonks,” Draco replied and hugged her in greeting. “Cousin Draco!” Teddy lunged himself into Malfoy’s arms, fancy dressed robes and all and Malfoy hugged him back “There, there, Teddy. I was here last week,” Malfoy said putting him down. Andromeda tapped Harry on the shoulder and said, “Go change, I’ll take over the kitchen,” and Harry slowly crept away from the small crowd. Yeah, he felt out of place for sure.
“Let’s stop talking about this, what is going on in your before Christmas freak out? Bought all the presents yet?” Draco asked, looking for something to drastically change the subject with. “I mean, I’ve bought some of them, but don’t know what to buy for the rest so they’re still waiting to be bought, how about you?” She asked, seeming to caught the bait. “Oh, I’ve bought like, 80% of them but there’s a few I’m still considering buying for or not, so.” Pansy nodded.
“What’s up?” Draco asked as he slides away from Teddy and left him to read by himself, “Your mum doesn’t want me to be here,” He said rather quietly, “Oh,” Draco responds and looks over at Teddy who still sat quietly, concentrating on his book. Draco looks back at him and smirks, “Wait until I tell her I’m going to spend my entire summer with you,”
“Honestly Harry, you should teach Hermione how to cook, she is absolutely horrible at it.” Ron grinned walking into the kitchen, which to Hermione glared back at him. “Yeah, sure Ron but aren’t you the stay-at-home boyfriend that not so very secretly took after none other but Molly Weasley with her cooking powers, huh?”
It wasn’t until 3 pm when he got up again, he was starving and not only that but he had to go to work soon as well since he has the evening shift. He made himself presentable for work and then almost ran out of the door, grabbing his fast ramen last minute to eat on his way there. “Hi” he greeted his boss as he clocked in one minute before his shift started. Coming out to the store after he has changed into his work uniform, it was full, which wasn’t normal. “Christmas shoppers” his co-worker informed him when she saw him stare out at the crowd which to he responded “oh.”
When he looked at Harry he remembers exactly what had happened, the panic attack, Pansy and Harry calming him, Harry walking them outside, hand in hand, apparating them here, Draco puking over his white rug. Draco cringed as his brain went over what had happened, a clear mental image of Harry just a few centimetres away, wiping off his makeup gently, brushing his teeth, deeding Draco incapable and Draco not complaining, making Draco take his sleeping meds so he could sleep, leading him to his bed and-.
“I have to shower,” Harry said and Draco knew it was a poor excuse to get away, he’d used it enough himself. Draco hmed as Harry picked up his jacket and put it on. “We’re good right?” Draco felt himself ask self-consciously and Harry shrugged, “‘course,” he said, but Draco wasn’t sure, regardless he let it go, “I’ll see you then,” Harry nodded before unlocking Draco’s door and walking out, “Do you have your wand with you? Phone?” Draco asked like a worried mother and Harry nodded, walking backwards to the stairs, “see you later;” Harry had waved and Draco had waved back. Looking after him as he walked down the stairs,
As they approached the house the party was held in they heard the music become louder and louder, “You think we’re gonna be deaf after this, yeah?” Harry said jokingly, looking over at Draco who stared blankly in front of them as they walked, “Hey, are you okay?” Draco nodded, but Harry wasn’t convinced, “are you sure?” he said, now suddenly worried, “yeah,” Draco breathed, not meeting Harry’s eyes, even though they stopped. “Really?”
“Told me Teddy had missed cousin Draco very, very much” His mother smirked at him as Draco glared at her.
Turning to the guy he went and came back from the dance area with, “Craig I give up,” he said and Craig chuckled, “Draco is Draco,” he said and shrugged, Kevin rolled his eyes, “Clearly,” Harry raised an eyebrow at them, “What do you mean with that?” Craig shrugged, “his mind hits like an imaginary wall sometimes and he kind of tunes out, ya feel me?” Harry nodded though he didn’t really understand. “That’s what happened now?” Craig took a sip from his drink “probably,”
“For.. another 10 minutes, yes” He sighed into the phone as he glanced towards the clock. Meanwhile, Hermione gave a hm. “Aaand when you do get out of work?” and Harry, catching onto something immediately fills himself with, probably unnecessary, worry “Has something happened?” He asks her. “No, no, mum everything's fine” She nervously laughs and he hears a door shut in the distance.
“We meet again,” Ron said bittersweetly, “Hello to you too,” Draco retorted, “Have you been trying to seduce my girlfriend eh?” He asked Draco thought it sounded rather sarcastic he couldn’t be sure but went for it anyway. “Yeah, you know, kiss her one last time until she’s mine,” Draco said, smiling behind his glass of vodka and took a sip. Hermione laughed, she laughed so much she doubled over, “What’s so funny?” Harry asked from beside Ron, though be did have an amused smile playing on his own face, Hermione straightened herself and looked over at Draco who tried to look innocent. “Nothing,” She said, casting a knowing look towards Draco and winked before dragging Ron towards the dancefloor. “What have you done?” “Nothing,” Draco replied, sipping from his glass before adding, “This time,” when Harry raised an eyebrow. “So you decided to join the party huh?” Draco smirked playfully nudging Harry in the shoulder who shoved him back, “Come on let’s get you up and on the dance floor,” Draco said before swallowing the rest of his drink and setting the glass down before takin Harry by the arm and dragging him there,
“Before the expiration date,” Draco said giving it to Pansy, who downed it. “I remember you sitting on a man’s lap, what was that about,” Draco asked, ice cream in his mouth, “drunk me doesn’t know I’m a lesbian and WILL sleep with anyone,” Draco nodded into the ice cream, “well you see, I’m pretty sure I’m sexually attracted to men, just not romantically,” Pansy continued, grabbing her ice cream spoon again. “Because men ain’t shit,” Draco said and Pansy nodded, “because men ain’t shit,” she echoed.
, Draco caught himself thinking. “You said something,” Draco said back, returning to his book at sipping on his tea, Harry sat up beside him, “what’s the clock?” he asked, yawning again, Draco shrugged, “about 10 am I think, there’s enough hot water in the kettle if you want a cup of tea as well,” Draco said, not looking up from his book, beside him, Harry stretched his back cracking as he got his glasses and settled down again, leaning against the wall, watching Draco,
Draco looked around his group of friends, when he looked over at Harry he was met with him already staring at him, Harry seemed to snap out of a trans when he saw Draco looking at him and broke into a smile, “Happy new year’s” he screamed over the sound of the fireworks and the chatter among the people there, “Happy new year’s” Draco yelled back.
“Malfoy’s going to University?” Harry suddenly spoke up making them all turn around to look at him. “Yes? I am?” Malfoy answered with a raised eyebrow. “As in?? Muggle university??” Malfoy leaned against the table Ron and Harry was sitting around, crossed his hands over his chest. “Something wrong with that?” He then asked and after having stared at Harry for a couple seconds Harry shook his head. “Suppose not” Harry crossed his arms and slid down on his own chair.
“So Hermione is pregnant, I hear?” Seamus grinned over his beer glass, Ron puffed his chest out proudly, “sure is,” which made Seamus laugh, “you’re looking way too proud mate,” Seamus said, Dean with his arm around him protectively. “If someone’s gonna have kids out of us it’s him,” Harry said over his glass, pointing to Ron with his thumb, Seamus shrugged, “yeah I mean, me and Dean would’ve troubles doing that on our own and the rest of you are still single,” which made Neville shot his entire beer, “ey mate, chill out,” Seamus laughed when Neville put his glass down on the table, “rough day?” Harry nodded, “you don’t even KNOW,” Neville groaned, Harry snorted, “I feel ya though,”
And so they continued until they had planned their entire journey deciding to go to Ireland, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy and France. And then they went on to book their trip in one go because why not, calculating how long they’d have to stay at each place to get to do all that the wanted to do and if they were going to get there by car, bus, train or plane. Also, make sure that every ticket and hotel where a money back in case they took longer to get there or had to cancel it.
Harry sat down in front of Draco, now unsure of what to do, “Draco,” he said rather firmly and cringed at his tone. “Look at me,” he said a bit more gently but still too demanding for his own liking. But Draco did look at him, his makeup was smudged all over but he was still as beautiful as ever. Harry cleared his throat, “We’re going to get you out of here,” he pressed the flask into Draco’s hand,
Well back at Draco’s flat Pansy sat him down forcefully on the sofa before getting two giant spoons and the ice cream, “spill,” she said, sitting down beside him. “There’s really nothing to spill Pans,” Draco said, taking one of the spoons. “He just kinda woke up, and left, nothing more about that, said he needed to shower before his shift at twelve,” Draco shrugged. Pansy clearly didn’t agree that there’s wasn’t anything to spill, “and when did you guys wake up?” she asked, “I don’t know, around ten maybe,” Pansy hmed to herself. “That seems like a very long shower,” Draco rolled his eyes, “maybe he just needed some time for himself, you know how I am after a party,” Pansy raised her eyebrows “like this,” she said gesturing towards him, “you may be an introvert Dray but, nah, only when you’ve had a bad party,” Draco rolled his eyes, “so by your theory I’d open the door for just anybody? And also, would you consider yesterday as a good party?” Pansy opened her mouth to argue but closed it again.
Yeah I'm sorry this was pretty short but it was just one scene and I kinda want to get as many chapters up before school starts :)
“Have a good night sleep then, or something. May the bed bugs eat you alive, or something like that.” Pansy said and disappeared. Draco muttered, “May the bed bugs eat you alive, what a bitch.”
He had run into the golden trio today when he was out eating with Pansy and Blaise. It was weird, he had been seeing Potter around a lot recently, like some secret force, forcing them to meet.
“Is that what you planned, really? Really?” Harry responds. “Well, now I have” Malfoy winked and took another sip of his wine. Harry sighed “This is why I disliked you for 6 years,” He said and glared grumpily at Malfoy who just smiled behind his wine glass. “Not that I was a spoiled bully then?” Malfoy responded with a glint in his eyes. “Were?” Harry then said without skipping a beat. Which made the other boy break out in laughter. “Sure, Potter. Whatever,”
“Oh bother off Sabrina,” Pansy scoffed and fixed her hair a little. “Can I come over for a second?” Draco rolled his eyes. “Sure, why not, you’re already half here”
As soon as he opened the door Pansy greeted him with a hug, the glitter she had all over her face transferring to Draco’s coat which he quickly took off feeling how many people there are inside, “You should open a window,” He said briefly as Pansy led him over to the bar. “Nonsense,” she said and poured him a shot glass of vodka. Draco rolled his eyes at her before swallowing it in one go,
“No, no he’s fine Ron” Hermione argued. “Would you just go out to the car for a bit alone darling?” Hermione gestured to Ron and the door. “Why?”
He’d gotten Andromeda another cookbook but this was a muggle one since she only had magical ones, somehow, Andromeda thanked him profusely. And he had absolutely no idea what Narcissa would want so he just got her another neckless, since Draco had told him, “You can’t go wrong with necklaces with my mother,” when he’d asked. She nodded thankfully at him.
“I’m sorry,” Pansy said, sounding sincere. “It’s fine” Draco shook his head, taking a deep breath. “Just don’t let it happen again.”
“It’s not like I’m the ideal friend for him, Sabrina. Everyone loves him and hates me, it won’t look good on him, he’ll change his mind.”
A gold moment was when Draco opens his, Harry had gotten him a gift card to the café, the sum on it probably lasting several years. “
“Draco gave it to me,” Harry told her, “And look,” Harry said turning it around, “That’s my dad’s name,”
“There’s a lot of Harry Potters out there you got to be more specific.” Draco turned back to his computer to quickly read through the paragraph he just wrote. “The magical one! Obviously!” Sabrina stretched out her arms in an attempt to make them understand. “Oh yeah, the saviour of the wizarding world?” Pansy snorted. “Quite a tosser, really” She then added. “Yeah, we were in the same year as him, he works as a barista in the café we go to all the time,” Draco turned back to them, adding to what Pansy had said. “Oh.” Sabrina’s posture suddenly became somewhat relaxed. “My brother did say there was a bully or ‘an annoying piece of ass’ as my brother called him, called Draco Malfoy in Harry’s year… So, Wait… You guys are… And you must be the mean girl who bullied the Granger girl…” She pointed at Pansy,
“Yeah, like, the only actual English ones were Black, with a lot of french people in it sure, but English is the origin, and then the Abbotts, McMillans, Potters and Weasleys I think,” Draco put down his fork and started digging in his bag, “But maybe the Weasley’s are Irish?” Harry rolled his eyes, “Is it because of the red hair?” Draco made a face, “Yeah…”
The Malfoy family first came to Britain with William the Conqueror and were awarded land in Wiltshire after rendering unknown, but shady and most likely magical services for King William I.
“Why do you care?” Draco bit out. Because really, this was not Potter’s business whatsoever. Struggling, Draco took himself out of Potter’s grip and kept climbing the stairs. And Potter did catch up to him almost right away. Draco stopped and turned around at his door meeting Potter eye to eye. “Potter. This is not your business, I have never asked you about your personal matters now have I?” Not letting Potter respond he left him open-mouthed to unlock the door.
“Yeah, my crippling loneliness is just getting to me,” Draco said and chuckled, Harry, wrinkled his eyebrows but decided to laugh along.
“Not really, just the usual, what are you doing here?” Pansy sighed as she took off her coat and shoes “Checking up with you, haven’t heard from you in a while so, what should I leave?” She raised an eyebrow and righted herself to her full height of 5’6. “No, but I’m guessing Sabrina will rudely come here soon as well” At Pansy’s furtherly raised eyebrow he sighed and added “I had tea with Potter yesterday,” he starts walking back towards his sofa as he hears Pansy gasp behind him. “You didn’t tell me!” Draco crawled back into his comfy position and grabbed his hot chocolate. “No I didn’t tell you, obviously,” he stated and Pansy huffed before sitting down on the sofa beside him.
He got out at 12, his coworkers insisting he should work full days more often, “because I’m such a delight,” Harry said laughing, walking out. He took the bus home because that’s relaxing, he got time to actually think for the first time since he woke up.
“It’s, it’s me, Sabrina, I know you’re going to hate me now and I totally deserve it just, I hope you forgive me one day.”
And so Harry Potter started to follow Draco Malfoy on Instagram, later also discovering Pansy and Blaise on there and following her too if he just didn’t have to make it worse for himself.
He remembers being 9 years old flying high above the manor, feeling the wind hit his face as his mother looks on from below.
Harry didn’t tell Draco this but he was very happy that he’d come in, Hermione and Ron made no effort to visit him at work, well, Ron had come once when Harry was still pretty new to the place 2 years ago. They were busy, he knew so, but that didn’t mean it didn’t feel like they had time for him.
“Did you? Just call me mum?” Harry laughs into the phone “I told them I called my mum, I’m in a separate room now, so,”
“Great! Thank you... Rowan for your help” He said, put his hands in his pockets and walked out in such a cocky way that Draco could only describe it as ‘fuckboy’. However as soon as the door closed after him Rowan turns over in her chair, “how do you know him? He’s so hot!”
“So, you and Ginny huh,” Harry said after a while and Luna smiled again, “you don’t mind do you?” Harry shook his head, “of course not, you both deserve to be happy,” Luna smiled happily at him, “I heard Molly’s had a harder time with it though,” Harry said, sipping his tea, Luna shrugged lightly, “not really, she just isn’t used to the idea of her daughter not dating you in general, she’ll come around, I know she will,” Harry smiled at the hope in her voice, “she better,” Luna nodded, “it’d be strange if she didn’t, she loves her kids with her whole heart,” Harry nodded at that, there was nothing more accurate about Molly than that. “You’ll come to Sunday dinner on the 5th right?” Harry shrugged, he hadn’t thought about it, “why especially the 5th?” Luna smiled, “I’ll be there it’d be nice if you were too,” Luna had shrugged and Harry had nodded, “I’ll think about it,”
He didn’t think that Potter would’ve even remembered the journey, trip or whatever you want to call it. He thought Potter would’ve at least pretended like he didn’t remember that conversation happening, apparently not.
Going by train meant first taking the bus for a half an hour from campus and then three hours if the trains not late to get to his aunt. After that a walk of 20 solid minutes and THEN he had reached his destination. Walking towards the house he could smell the meat being cooked. Knocking on the door he heard scrabbling inside before a certain boy with vibrant blue hair opened the door. “Draco!” he screeched and went to hug him but Draco stopped him. “Yes, hi there Teddy, but I'm drenched of the rain, I need to dry off first then we can hug okay?” Draco ruffled the boy’s hair as he stepped in.
“Uncle Draco was born with curly hair like the rest of the Blacks.” Potter mused and bent down to keep colouring. “Uncle Draco's a Black? Like grandma was?” Teddy asked. Draco smiles. “Great-aunt Narcissa here was a Black, I'm simply the offspring of an ex-Black” Draco stated. “What does offspring mean?” Draco could hear Teddy whisper in Potter's hear and Potter's whispers back.
“I wouldn’t say that I changed more than you lot.” Draco said, mentioning towards Potter, “However I can say that I now have more breathing room to be that person that I wanted to be,” Draco stopped and looked over at Potter before adding: “Deep, I know” Potter snorted “Yeah”
A wave of an enormous sense of thirst washed over him and he stood to get some water. Just as he’d started sipping on his water Rowan called for him to come up front because someone was there.
Malfoy stayed longer than the others. Much longer. It was a half an hour before closing time and Harry was afraid that he’d have to kick bloke out. As he wandered closer cleaning tables and watching Malfoy’s back he heard him start to hum on some song and soon realising it’s “I won’t say I’m in love” From Hercules.
Although believed to be fully pureblood there have been several instances where the Malfoy family has reproduced with half-bloods and even rich muggles before the statue of secrecy came into place. Because of them integrating with the muggles they became one of the richest wizarding families in the world. Not only rich, however, they are shown to have been or be a bunch of powerful witches and wizards, always earning between 7.0 and 9.6 on magical ability tests, the last one, made on Draco Malfoy (1980-present) at his birth has showed the highest one yet, scoring a 9.6, in contrast to his father, Lucius Malfoy II (1953-present) however who only scored 7.4 at the time of his birth his testing it is therefore believed that Draco Malfoy gained these powers through his mother Narcissa Malfoy née Black (1955-present). These powers are however rumoured to have lowered rather than gotten higher at the time of Draco Malfoy's graduation. Not only that but this extremely magical blood might go unused since Draco Malfoy as it seems has taken up studying medicine at the University of London and going back to his roots of integrating with muggles. In April 2000 there was a reported sighting of Draco Malfoy snogging Kevin Entwhistle a muggle-born from his year at Hogwarts in an alley outside a gay bar in London.
“Summer 2000,” Luna said from behind him, Harry startled, immediately putting the picture down, turning around to face Luna who gave him a puzzled look. She leaned back on her four-poster, gently picking on a flower she had taken from a vase, not looking at Harry, “when I was imprisoned in Malfoy manor Draco would hold guard sometimes,” she took a pedal of the flower, letting it fall to the floor, “when everyone else had gone to bed he’d come back, several plates of food with him,” she looked at Harry then, “or he’d order way too much food for him alone to eat,” another pedal fell to the floor, “on my 17th birthday he brought a cake, it was small, rather a muffin than anything else, but the gesture was genuine,” Luna looked up at the ceiling, smiling, “he’s a good person,” she said, then looking at Harry, “it’s okay to like him,” Harry laughed bitterly, “I don’t,” Harry said and Luna hummed, taking a sip of her tea, “of course you don’t.”
