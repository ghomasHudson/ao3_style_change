Harry smiles thinly—probably because Draco’s grinning. As if the merriment of the last few days is an act, and he’s playing along just for his sake.
As they drove to their target, Harry asked after Astoria and Scorpius. He hated small talk and kept his answers short and devoid of details.
Inside, he was in turmoil. He couldn’t believe that he had bumped into him in muggle London on a Sunday. How the gods cursed him!
Draco was not thinking of anything but getting into work. He was never late. He did not have time to get new clothes from the manor, but his clothes from last night would do. He had only worn them for an hour. They were a little on the tight side for work, but his robe should cover well enough.
Draco was drunk from the wine, at this point, singing, “Myyy Waaayyyy” the same drawn out way Sinatra did, except not at all like Sinatra did, of course. Wine always made him loopy. Blaise was enjoying every minute of Draco’s antics. He couldn’t stop raising his eyebrows and smiling, surprised he knew the lyrics to a Frank Sinatra song. He was a muggle singer. This is why he loved him so desperately. Draco never stopped surprising him.
Draco sits down, taking him in. This is why he didn’t want to ask, but he had to. Harry’s body is taut again, but it’s not as bad as yesterday.
His private life was always to remain private. Nothing was going to change that, not even the great Harry Potter.
“If you decide that’s not something you’re willing to do, or if you tell anyone about this,  I’ll make sure there’s no Wizarding publication in the world, that doesn’t know how pathetic you are. I’ll be certain to mention your boyhood crush on our savior. You’ll be crucified in the papers, not Potter. You’re the ex-death eater, or did you forget? You’ll be cast as the sick, obsessive, pervert who forced him into it, with dark magic. You’ll be lucky to escape Azkaban. You'll definitely lose your job. Not to mention, the damage this will cause to your family. Did you think about that while you were bent over for Potter? Taking his cock up your ass?”
He was preparing to bring Blaise to orgasm with his mouth but realized, as Blaise adjusted himself, that the sheets beneath him were splattered with Blaise's cum already. So he lay on his back near Blaise, staring at the ceiling.
“Nice and hot,” Draco observed, placing his hand softly on Harry’s flaming bottom. He conjured cooling gel and Harry jumped at the chill when Draco smoothed it over his ass. It dried quickly and he let Harry get dressed. When he was fully clothed, Harry looked a bit shaken so Draco grabbed his arm and gave him sensual, deep kiss.
Draco had knocked him out, cold. He smiled to himself and waited for sleep to overcome him, thinking about everything that transpired this evening. He allowed himself to hope that it would continue, for as long as possible, forever even. Maybe, this time around, this could really work. He let the thought fill him up and fell into a sated sleep, with a smile on his face.
“I just…don’t know if I can hurt him, Harry. The things he said today. Awful. So painful. I can’t even imagine it.”
He had expected that outing them to the public would cause their relationship to break apart. Instead, it backfired, and his relationship with Harry had only grown closer.
Draco suctioned his hole fully now gripping him so he wouldn’t move. His face was barely visible because it was so far between Harry’s cheeks, suctioning him and licking relentlessly. Harry had to stroke himself to take the edge off.
Draco got his transfer approved, surprisingly. He had secret hopes that Harry would lobby Shacklebolt to reject it. He had that power, and the minister’s ear. More proof that Harry is done with him. He’s surprised that news of their breakup hasn’t hit the Daily Profit. Suspects Hermione has a hand in it, but she could only hold them off for so long. Once he leaves for Paris, there’s no hiding it. He’s already packed and plans to leave tonight.
Harry smiles wider now, like it’s the best news he’s heard all year. Draco rolls his eyes but smiles back.
Breakfast was a lavish affair. The elves put their best work forward, and there was every manner of breakfast food on the table. Pancakes, french toast with powdered sugar, bacon, sausage, cubed potatoes, sunny side eggs, scrambled eggs, eggs Benedict, a huge fruit platter, coffee, orange juice, and more. It was enough to feed 25 people, at least.
When he began working yet another glass, a few hours later, he began to see things in a new light. He had lost count of how much he had to drink.
That Saturday, there was to be an annual ministry ball, celebrating the date ending the war. Essentially, it was a day honoring the great Harry Potter.
Shacklebolt begins the meeting, but Harry’s hardly listening to a single word. His head is full of Draco— wielding the whip, torturing his body with pleasure, his fingers, his voice, his praise, the sheer joy of kneeling in front of him. There seems to be room for nothing else, and he stares in the general direction of Shacklebolt to make it seem like he’s listening. Finally, he chances a glance at his Master. Draco narrows his burning storm-grey eyes at him and instead of glaring hatefully back the way he always has, he finds he can’t hold his gaze. He lowers them to the table immediately.
Standing taller, Draco looked at his reflection in the mirror, studying himself. Serious face, set jaw…consciously, he forced himself to relax. That lessened the tightness around eyes, made his face more gentle. Still stern, strong…but not angry. He wasn’t angry, not at Harry. Not really; Harry would learn and they would be fine. If he didn’t learn, that was also fine. Draco didn’t know if he was capable of teaching him.
Harry went to a clearing in the room and fidgeted nervously. He suddenly had no idea what to do with his hands and was keenly aware of them dangling stupidly at his sides.
That evening, as Draco showered, Harry lit the bedroom with soft candlelight, after disrobing. He took massage oil from the drawer and placed it on top of the nightstand. When Draco came out, he smiled at the warm sight. Harry’s naked body on display, with his broad shoulders, huge cock, bulging muscles, and piercing green eyes, always made him swoon. This was love, he thought. This was so much better than anything that could be found in a dinky dungeon.
Draco doesn’t answer, just continues thrusting inside at a slow pace, lost to the bliss of Harry’s hot heat.
When it was over, Harry was still breathing hard on his chest. He seemed reluctant to part from Draco’s body. Draco immediately felt a wave of exhaustion overtake him as bottoming drained his energy far more than topping ever did. Sleep was quickly approaching. He felt Harry kiss him one last time and lay next to him, cuddling into his side. They both, immediately, fell into a sated sleep.
Thankfully, the food came at just that time. Prime rib for Harry, a 6 oz. fillet mignon for Draco, and sides of roasted cauliflower, gratin potatoes, balsamic green beans and lobster mac and cheese.
He changes into gray sweats and an old, torn, Gryffindor T-shirt and sets up camp on the half-heart couch, pulling out a quidditch magazine to get his mind off him. He doesn’t want to be up in the bedroom, waiting. It makes him think of his blond-haired naked body bathed in moonlight on his duvet. The couch is danger too. Draco’s fucked him on it numerous times. Even the kitchen bothers him. One night, when Harry was getting frazzled over cooking an Alfredo pasta, Draco pulled him down and fucked him right on the kitchen floor. Eased his tension well enough then, but it only makes him think of his limitless libido now.
“I know you have a new boyfriend and all, but what the fuck, Drake? The contract doesn’t hurt you. It doesn’t hurt Harry. It makes no difference for you two. Can’t you let me keep this small piece of us, just as a momento? It doesn’t affect your life in any way. You’d forgotten all about it, until recently.” He turns to face him.
He didn’t realize it at that time, during that intense hour, lost to lust as he was, but he apparently continued his
Harry stared at him cruelly, not appreciating his dismissive tone, but he did not argue, as he usually did. He walked out, slamming the door closed behind him.
“This is called a spanking horse. See these shelves on the side? I want you to put your knees here and kneel over the center bench. Hold onto the handles underneath at the front…Yes that’s it, pet. That’s good.”
Draco noticed all the healers rush into his room and ran in. He thrust all the healers aside and got right in his face, putting his hand on his shoulders to push him down.
He received an owl during lunchtime from his financial advisor at Gringott’s and his private investigator, both. Draco thanked his lucky stars that he had such efficient men working for him. They were certainly paid enough to do the job quickly.
He didn’t move a muscle. He was too shocked by Harry’s proclamation, and his own orgasmic reaction, to do much of anything. Harry came up behind him and wrapped his arms around him. Draco stiffened in response.
He's sleeping, and Draco’s crawling out of his skin with the need to know if he means what he’s saying. The fact remains, he was with that woman and nothing could take it back. Harry didn’t even seek him out to explain. He doesn’t judge him for it. He’s angry, but mostly, he understands.
Draco was trembling in his arms. They had fallen to the floor together. He rubbed his eyes furiously and his voice cracked.
They didn’t notice Draco approaching, wrapped up as they were. Draco had to clear his throat to announce his presence.
Every sexual act between them was initiated by Draco himself. It was never Blaise, and this is the way he preferred it.
Draco’s eyes starting closing. He felt Harry stroking his cheek, brushing his white blonde hair from his eyes. The last thing he felt before falling into sleep was Harry’s lips softly kissing his forehead.
“Listen, obviously I haven’t told anyone and never will. You can trust me Draco. Are you two in love?”
“No. Go. You feel feverish. Too hot. Always. I’ll be alright in about fifteen minutes. I can take over.”
Draco understands now—why they run. Fairy tale princesses. Overwhelmed sensory kids, abused teenagers. Everyone who’s ever seen a horror, heard horrible news. When there’s a deatheater attack,
All he thought about was how guilty he felt even hugging Blaise, and it burned to know that Harry had such little faith in him.
“Harry, it’s not that. I always want you.” He scooted forward to kiss him gently. Harry savored it, then stared at the ceiling, crossing his arms.
Draco landed yet another punishing blow. Blaise’s ass was blotching an angry red now, all over. He shut his eyes tightly at the pain, but his cock did not waver from full hardness.
Their breakfast was incredible. It consisted of 20 different small plates with various foods inside - mezza, they called it. Three different kinds of olives, pickled radishes, and so much more. Draco was starved. His favorite was the spicy Turkish beef sausage called ‘basterma.’
“The fact that you let me hit you until you almost couldn’t take it anymore isn’t submission, Harry. It’s
It was still around 1pm, and Draco never arrived home this early. The house was completely quiet. He called out for Astoria, as he went up the stairs, but there was no reply. He started to worry.
“I missed you so much! Can we go skateboarding at the park?! Please dad. I’ve been locked inside all weekend with house elves and French lessons.” At that, he made a face.
His arms were still crossed. His face had turned from an angry glare to one of sadness, and Draco couldn’t stand him looking like this, for another second.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about, Potter. You know nothing about me or my relationship with Blaise. So shut your fucking mouth.”
He needed to be the one in control. Without it, their friendship could be compromised. They were already in too deep as it was.
He stopped, staring up into his green eyes. They were sparkling with lust and perhaps, a little fear.
Harry taking control was just as hot as when he let Draco take control. He can’t decide which way is better, but right now, the former is winning. No wonder he did this for six months. Draco lifts his hips, gripping the table’s edge as he tries not to thrust. Harry walks him to the ledge and stops when Draco’s shaking, brushing kisses over the inside of his leg.
“That’s why you’re here. To get me to break it.” Blaise chuckles. “Nice try Draco, but no, I’d really rather not. You’ll realize why in due time.”
Blaise’s knees began to tremble at the pain and position, but he remained on his feet, an impressive feat. He could not use his hands to balance himself as they were tied behind him.
Then, there’s the fact that I can’t bring myself to have sex with her anymore. We fight about that too. I’ve brought up the separation to her numerous times, but she always guilt trips me with the kids. It works. I can’t imagine hurting my children like that, even the idea of hurting her, is sometimes too much for me. In my mind, we are separated, but she refuses to accept it. I’m going to make it official soon, whether she guilts me or not. I’m not happy with her.
In that moment, he’s sure down to his bones that Harry is dead. He is so sure, tears start filling his eyes, so he’s nearly blind as his body propels himself towards his bed.
Everywhere Draco went in France, he was ogled at openly by both men and women. Most Frenchman were short and Draco towered over them with his lithe 6’1 frame. Paired with his white-blonde hair and grey eyes, Draco was an exotic tourist who probably starred in their fantasies.
After showering, he put his silk pajama bottoms on and poured himself a drink. It had to be ordered up special as it wasn’t available in his room.
This was his second betrayal of the day. A man could only take so much. He refused to confront her about this now.
“He’s going to be okay. You know that, right, Harry? Nothing that is wrong with him is threatening his life.”
He heard Harry stand up and come close behind him, felt calloused hands stroking his arms. His potent magic seeped through his shirt, warming him instantly.
“It was only for a half hour. It was way before this started between us, when I was overseeing renovations.
She popped out of sight and by the time she had returned, Blaise was already heading down the master staircase, shirtless,
At the word ‘whore,’ Harry shrieked. Draco felt his inner muscles spasm around his cock and his hand fill with a viscous fluid. Draco immediately blew his load with a loud shout.
Anxiety started to swell in his body, but he tried to hold it off. He needed to think of other people’s interests over his own. He had been a selfish prick for too long. How could he possibly deny Blaise a family, when it is what he has been pushing him towards, for over ten years?
Harry blushed and Draco knew instantly, he was right. This was about bloody Blaise. He was almost disappointed to have it confirmed. He was even more angry now, as he was just starting to warm up to the idea.
Harry was a different matter entirely. Their ‘relationship’ as it were, began as a mutual hatred and disregard for the other’s well-being. As children, Harry disrespected him at every turn. Even now, he often displayed a lack of respect when he was angry. He would have to learn to control his emotions, something that he, himself, admitted to be a near impossibility. It is what prevented him from being a skilled occlumens, even as an adult.
“You have to be sure you want to be with me, Harry. I can’t do this back and forth thing, even for you…You have to be certain that you’ll never put us through this madness ever again, and you might have to see someone, a professional, to talk to. Because I don’t think all the spankings in the world will be enough.”
“Don’t you dare call me a coward, Potter! When would I have time to fuck Blaise? You’re here every bloody night and I work with you, all day.”
Adjusting himself, he stared harder at the head snuggled to his chest, and angled himself to get a closer look. He brushed some dark locks aside, and
“Maybe you should leave me. I deserve it. I’m nothing. I’m no one. And I keep hurting you. Hurting Blaise. You deserve so much better than me. Why are you with me? I’m worthless.”
As Draco showered and brushed his teeth, he couldn’t stop being haunted by a feeling of inadequacy. He didn’t like it. He was a Malfoy, after all. He worked so hard to restore his name to something honorable, and now, it was like he had went back in time. He thought of his shame right after the war, how lowly he felt then. He felt the same way now. It was hardly putting him in a sexy mood.
He rolled so that Harry was on top of him and gripped his bottom tightly to thrust hard upwards, against his clothed cock, and his orgasm broke free, at the same time as Harry’s.
When it’s over, Harry is panting and leaking copiously from his cock, his death grip on the cross loosens and he goes limp. Without the restraints holding him up, he would’ve sank into a wasted pile of boneless limbs to the ground. He feels hands stroking his back and ass with cooling gel and sighs in relief. Draco dips a lube-slicked finger inside his hole to stretch him, probing his prostate, and he groans in response.
“Just transfigure something you have. Don’t make this hard Malfoy. We deserve to relax a bit before heading back to work.”
Blaise smiled, nodding emphatically, and began eating his lunch. He chatted idly about details of the wedding. It was apparently going to be a grand affair, but Draco’s mind wandered. He didn’t want to do this but felt he had to. He was already dreading next Wednesday, and he hoped he could stay hard, throughout. It would be embarrassing if he had a repeat episode of erectile dysfunction. He banished the thought from his mind and refocused on Blaise, offering input wherever he could.
The inside of his warm, wet mouth was pure heaven. The pressure around his cock was already becoming too much to bear. He felt Harry’s fingers stroking his balls while his other hand stroked the base of his cock, in time with his sucks. After only a few minutes, he was already approaching his orgasm.
His enormous cock points to the ceiling, an angry red. It looks too big for his body now. Draco licks his lips at the sight.
A young man was bent over a small rectangular table. His wrists were chained down at the end of it, fully extended downwards, and his ankles were chained apart on the opposite end. He was completely naked and soaked with sweat. He was being penetrated at both ends. A tall, burly dark haired man was ramming into him brutally from behind while another shorter man stood in front feeding him his cock. The chains rattled loudly against the metal legs of the table as the man behind him thrust forward at a relentless pace, slapping his flesh loudly. He was grunting with each thrust. Suddenly, the man in front of him, pulled out, rapidly stroking his cock to reach orgasm, and blew his load all over his face, groaning loudly. The chained man closed his eyes tight against the onslaught and cum splattered the floor beneath him as it dripped down his chin. This seemed to trigger the man behind him to reach orgasm, as well. He pulled out of him swiftly, removed the muggle plastic enclosing his cock and shot his load all over his ass. When he was done, he smacked his ass and left the room.
Draco grinned dazedly at him. His love for him him surged inside his body. It seemed preposterous that only last night, only an hour ago, he considered cheating on him. He could never do anything to jeopardize this.
“No, actually, they can’t. You need to stop caring about what other people think. How come I don’t give a fuck? And I just found out about it. It made the papers. It blew over...mostly.”
When he turns around he catches Harry’s blank eyes, but he doesn’t care. His face is still painfully beautiful this close, and he hasn’t laid eyes on him like this in so long. He has to embrace him. He rubs a cheek against his hair, feeling all the tension in his muscles slowly uncoil. He hasn’t been able to hug him in days.
Harry sat down to pull on the boots. The expensive leather was soft enough to fit over the ankle cuffs, hugging them so he could feel them when he took a step.
After a few minutes of Blaise’s even breathing, he released him gently and moved to the other side of the bed. He was too tired to think, and the second he closed his eyes, he immediately fell asleep.
A few nights later over a glass of firewhiskey, Draco’s drafting his letter for transfer to the DMLE in Paris when his floo rings, announcing another visitor.
“Draco Malfoy.” He says the name like he’s trying it on for size. “I feel sort of…floaty. Like I’m halfway high.” His eyes do look a little glazed. He’s still getting that relaxing potion, but he looks more lucid.
“In your life? I lost my job today, my would-be lover, my wife. My best friend is lying in a hospital bed, because of me, and I can’t even go to my own home.”
So locked into his nonsensical jealousy…that he can’t live his life. He can’t follow through on any of his feelings. Not even the important ones. The worst thing is that he knows
As he trekked into his bedroom, he heard a rustling coming from his walk-in closet. His heartbeat picked up in fear. Who could get through the Malfoy wards and get passed his elves? He drew his wand and opened his door, surprised to see Blaise standing there, looking guilty, with his hands behind his back.
He moved up his neck across his cheek, skipping his mouth, to the other cheek, then down to his chest. He got on his knees as he moved his lips down his abs, still not touching, but leaving goosebumps in his wake. Blaise shivered.
He felt he deserved a gold metal for staying away from Harry’s tight ass throughout the week. It took significant effort to do so. They spent more time together than usual, often going out together on big cases. Their public office anger simmered down to one of feigned polite indifference.
“You know what you’re agreeing to, don’t you, baby?” Draco asked anxiously. “I’m fine just playing, but when I pledge my heart and the red collar, it’s forever. You’re agreeing you’ll be mine ’til death do us part. No one else gets to see this arse but me.”
Harry leaned back on the couch, holding up Draco’s ass so that he could control the pace from below. His blonde angel began stroking his cock in time with his thrusts. Harry thrusted upwards against his prostate relentlessly, at a rapid pace. Draco braced himself on his his chest with his free hand, his mind and body drifting off into a sea of desire. His orgasm was already approaching.
Mr Wolfe spoke up, chuckling. “Ah, Monsieur Malfoy, always insisting on a one-man sub. Selfish as always. He belongs to you only and wouldn’t obey anyone else I assume, like your last…But what happened to Blaise? Yours for ten years, if I remember correctly. So lovely, maybe more so than this one. I never saw a sub more enamored with his master.”
Draco flung into action, working quickly to remove Harry’s pants and boxers off his body, completely, so that he could spread his legs as far as he wanted. He pulled them off aggressively, dragging Harry to slide backwards on the floor, in his haste.
It makes him dizzy with power. He feels that their relationship is invincible, dynamic, and nothing could break it.
Blaise smiles excitedly, then schools his face into a concerned look of consternation and fear. Putting his hands behind his back, he stands tall into display position, looking at the ground. Draco is panicking inside because he didn’t expect to jump into play so soon. He’s been preparing himself for this moment the entire week, but it’s still too soon. He tries to adopt a severe expression as he approaches Blaise. He needs to play this carefully.
“I guess you really aren’t an exhibitionist,” Draco said, unhooking the leash to stash it in his pocket. He reached to unbuckle the collar, but Harry stopped him with a hesitant hand.
He cast the preparation charms and breached his entrance in one smooth stroke. Draco squeezed his eyes shut at the blissful tight heat. Harry hadn’t been fucked in months and his hole was gripping him in a tight velvet fist. He started thrusting quickly. This was no time for a gentle fuck. He could sense this is what Harry needed as he heard his moans of ecstasy. A few long minutes went by and Draco’s orgasm was swelling up inside him. It was too soon, but it could not be helped.
Draco still wasn’t ready. His body was, but his brain needed to catch up. He held Harry back who frowned at being rebuffed. He needed to check on Blaise, anyway. It would be a perfect excuse to get out and clear his head.
His nerve endings were firing throughout his whole body sending shockwaves of desire to his brain. Harry slowly pushed in, refusing to pick up the pace, even when Draco slammed backwards. He pushed Draco’s outer leg upwards so that he had full control and
He moved deeper now adjusting his angle, determined to find the sweet spot. He thrust forward at a slightly awkward angle and Harry yelped and shook.
“You could never lose me Drake. I’ll be yours forever. I love you, so much.” Renewed tears starting falling with vigor. Draco recoiled at the second admission of love. He was never good with that.
“I honestly, don’t know what got into me. I was just so angry at you for choosing Potter, of all people. I always suspected, but it still burned to be right. I know I was completely out of line, and nothing will excuse my behavior, but you can’t imagine how much it hurt to see you with him like that. Our whole lives, you’ve told me that I was the only man you’d ever been with. I took that to mean that I would always be the only one. I know that’s selfish, but I can’t help it.
After Harry moved into the manor, they decided on a little vacation to the south of France. Two weeks on the Malfoy yacht, both to celebrate Draco’s full recovery and for Harry’s birthday. Draco is packing their toys on a Friday morning in July when Harry returns from the magical psychologist.
He tells himself he isn’t even here. He’s probably just with the kids at Ginny’s house. He’s panicking for no reason. Harry’s always been a slob, perhaps he forgot about the fruit. As he walks up the stairs, his footsteps muted by the long runner, he clings to the idea that his bedroom will be empty when he pushes open the door.
Draco took a deep breath. He knew that was a dig at him for claiming he hadn’t remembered their first time.
After they spent hours around the markets and got nowhere, they headed back to their hotel in the center of Istanbul in Taksim Square. Draco was exhausted from all the walking.
“Harry is better off without me. He’ll be sad for a little while, but he’ll get over it. I’m sure there’s a line of people just waiting for
“You seem to misunderstand what I mean by submission, pet. I’m not looking to make you scream in pain. The fact that you let me hit you, whip you, spank you, and tie you up isn’t the submission I’m after.”
Draco pushed it all the way in, so that it sat directly on his p spot and withdrew his fingers to get his wand.
“I’m sorry Blaise. I can’t. I’m on a tight schedule. Scorpius is with his mom. I never get the weekends alone, and I have so much to get through today. Perhaps another time.”
“You could be a right selfish git, you know that? I have a date with Pansy and I’m not standing her up. Isn’t this what you wanted for me? How am I suppose to maintain a relationship if you keep popping up whenever you fancy a shag. It’s not fair to me.”
“You may not love me, but you still want me. Lie to yourself all you want. Lie to Harry. But don’t you dare fucking lie to me, Draco. I deserve better than that,” he says angrily.
“You’re doing this for Potter, aren’t you? You fucking bastard. I’ll never release you from that contract! You’ll have to kill me first.”
Harry resist the urge to roll his eyes. He’s only wearing black cargo pants and a fitted black button up. It makes him think of Draco’s style, and he tries to emulate it. No one could pull it off like him, he thinks wistfully. His new assistant flirts heavily with him every chance she gets, and Harry regrets initially being receptive as part of his plot against Draco. He can’t find it in himself to be rude to her. Goes against the sweet savior image. Besides, all the women he flirts with know about his relationship with Draco. He’s sure they only think of him as their gay flirty friend.
He knelt behind Harry, mouth watering at the sight of his hairless hole. Harry must have been using grooming charms on himself, in preparation for this moment. He used his wand to cast a cleaning charm and licked him from his perineum to his hole, and above. Harry moaned behind his gag, and Draco was thankful his hand was still squeezing his cock because the sound threatened to tip him over. He missed his musky masculine taste. He had not tasted in him in so long, in light of being the bottom. Harry usually prepared him this way.
Draco decided to do the same with Scorpius. He was still on good terms with Astoria and was welcome at the cottage, whenever he so desired. He was desperate to focus his attention on someone other than Harry, who never failed to make him feel off-balance.
His father and all his forefathers must be rolling in their graves. It was a humiliation unbefitting a Malfoy, one he was not prepared to endure. He imagined this would eventually happen, but he could not anticipate the brutal reality he found himself in. Imagination and reality were two very different things. Nothing could have prepared him for this.
Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. Draco jumped in his chair, startled, but quickly shuffled his papers, pretending to do work. The door flew open.
This went on for a few moments before Scorpius couldn’t take it anymore and jumped out dramatically behind Astoria with his hands up in the air like an actor in a play, proclaiming,
“Besides, it was doomed from the start. Everyone was waiting for us to end. The deatheater and the savior, It goes against nature. We’re just... not good for each other. I’m surprised you, of all people, would want me with Harry.”
Harry scooted off his chair to kneel in front of him and put both hands on his thighs now, rubbing softly. His head was bowed submissively and he wasn’t meeting Draco’s eyes. It was a good look on him.
Harry flexed and cracked his knuckles menacingly, one hand twitching on his wand. Draco would have been touched by his fierce possessiveness if he wasn’t struck with the horror of the sinking truth.
He stepped forward the same time that Harry did and kissed him softly. This kiss felt different, now that he knew he was in love with him. It wasn’t just a prelude to sex anymore. He grabbed Harry’s face and poured all his love into that kiss. Harry moaned in his mouth, pulling him forward, rubbing their cocks together. It was clear what Harry wanted.
“France and thanks…listen Harry, I know you’re still angry, and that’s fine. Maybe you need to take a break from me…think about what you want.”
“If it were nothing, you wouldn’t be lying in a hospital bed. You’ve hardly been at home from working so hard. The kids miss you. I miss you. No more going into the field for overnight trips.
Unconsciously, he stepped forward to get a closer look and reached up to touch them. When Harry drew in a breath at the feeling of tenderness, he snatched his hand away, as if he had been burned. What was he doing? The firewhiskey had addled his brain. He needed to force himself to put distance between them. Draco stepped away and around the couch, using it as a physical barrier.
Harry pulled on dark red leather pants that sat extremely low and tight on his hips. He buttoned a thin white silk shirt to his throat to cover the collar. It was so thin that his nipples showed through. He started to tuck the shirt into his tight trousers when Draco came over to him.
“Shut it! The only problem we have is you! So just please. Please release yourself from the contract. Think about it, at least.”
What he lacked in experience, he made up for in enthusiasm. He caressed his balls while he sucked shallowly on Draco’s cock, almost half way, using his tongue to lap at the underside and around the tip.
The truth was that Draco’s dreams often involved Harry fucking him. He was too scared to even admit it, out loud, but had been craving it, every day, for the last month.
“You wish. She’s staying at her sister’s until Sunday night. I don’t lie about my family, unlike some people.”
When lunch was over, he trudged back up to his office, a feeling of dread making his steps heavy against the stairs.
“All of life is just one anything. That’s what makes it interesting. Follow on your course and see what all your anythings are gonna be.”
“A cooling off period will not make a difference. We were enemies our whole lives for a reason. You told me, yourself, you don’t know why you bother with me. It’s not just this morning. Ever since I let you into my life, it’s been nothing but chaos. My work has suffered, and I hardly recognize myself anymore. I don’t like who I’ve become. I can’t handle all the ups and downs. I’m not cut out for this. It’s too much.”
He scoured the newspapers every day. If Blaise was out in public on a date, there most certainly would be a story about it. He was not nearly as hounded by the media as Harry, but his dating life was of particular interest to the Wizarding world, considering his large fortune.
Multiple opportunities to be honest and up front with Blaise had presented themselves, but he choose the dishonest route. He should have just told him the truth, but this was something he could never forgive. Blaise was dead to him. He not only forced him out of the closet, but he revealed his relationship with Harry.
Dinner was mostly a pleasant affair. Draco and Astoria were quiet as Scorpius prattled on about everything Draco had missed while he was gone. Towards the end of the meal, he brought up something that both surprised and alarmed him.
“I’m just worried is all. One of the unspeakables who works with me said he was all over her. The guy is making a fool of you, publicly. I just don’t see you tolerating that.”
“Harry, I’m so sorry you had to see that. I promise you it didn’t mean anything. He is a bitch. He’s just trying to ruin what we have. That happened a while ago.”
Draco looks into his eyes and sees the savior of mankind, a man who loves him so desperately, despite all his faults. A man who's willing to kneel and submit to him. He’s asking for this small thing, and he has to oblige him. He has no choice.
His rage was so potent that he took out his wand and pointed it at the breakfast table. All the glasses and plates shattered into hundreds of pieces. The dining room table cracked in two and caved inwards. He pointed his wand at the walls and fired at will, shattering the glass windows. He destroyed everything in sight.
“Why are you bringing up Blaise, all the sudden? You haven’t mentioned him in months. Listen to me, Harry. I never want you to compare yourself to that codswallop. He’s dead to me. You and I are completely different. Can’t you see how much I love you? I never even came close to feeling about him, the way I feel about you. You’re everything to me, everything I could ever want. The sex is wonderful, as is. I don’t want it any other way. Please, let’s not fight about this.”
Harry looked like he wanted to say something about Draco’s perfect family life, but Draco was stroking his arm soothingly, and he didn’t want to push it. He turned back around and pushed back so he was curled against Draco’s front. He grabbed his arm from behind and wrapped it around himself.
He was mourning the fact that this was exactly what Harry must have gone through the night before, but Harry hadn’t begged him to stop. He had not gagged him, for this specific reason. He wanted Harry to be able to vocalize his displeasure. If Harry had begged Draco to stop, he would have. He was no rapist, though he had come awfully close, last night.
He practically ran up those stairs, before he could change his mind. He barreled through the crowd, desperate for fresh air and sense. He needed to remember himself before he became slave to this smaller, significantly darker, part of himself.
Once they realize Draco is clutching Harry Potter, there’s a torrent of healers that spring forward and he’s immediately hauled onto a stretcher. Harry turns his head a little, looking for his eyes.
Draco was sorely tempted but held his ground. He promised himself he would not cheat on Harry, even if it was not possible he would ever find out. Draco would know and the guilt would eat him alive. This was Harry’s biggest fear, that Draco would cheat on him with some submissive bloke, and he loved him too much to have that fear realized.
He can tell Draco is drifting between sleep and wakefulness, even though it’s only nine o’ clock. He’s so tired that he doesn’t shift from his position at the edge of the bed. One arm is thrown over his eyes. If Harry wasn’t so desperate for him, missing him when he’s lying right next to him, then he would have let him sleep. Harry’s kept him up all week with his madness. He knows, because he wasn’t sleeping either.
“Bienvenue dans le donjon souterrain, où tous vos fantasmes deviennent réalité. N'oubliez pas qu'il n'y a pas de règles ici dans le métro. Nous espérons que vous serez en sécurité et que vous profiterez de votre soirée.”
He did not greet him as he walked forward, with purposeful strides. Instead, he plucked Draco’s drink out of his hand to put it on the side table. It clanked on the glass top, and he pulled him up by his jumper to kiss him, soundly.
His recent encounters with Harry had obliterated all his old memories. He felt like he was living in someone else’s body, and every cell in this new body was filled with Harry’s scent. He worried that Blaise would be able to tell what happened just by looking at him, as if Harry were seeping out through his very pores.
Blaise wasn’t listening. He strolled behind Draco’s desk and bent down to kiss him, but Draco put a hand on his chest to stop him.
Draco sighed, feeling doubly horrible now. He was too busy focusing on his own wounds that he couldn’t see how deep Harry’s went.
While Harry spends the day away, Draco is seized with the desire to visit Blaise to find out how it went with David. No matter his hesitancy, he loves Harry too much to lose him over this. Feeling Harry’s pain keenly last night makes him want the contract gone, once and for all. He floo calls Blaise and is relieved to see him returned from France. He asks after Pansy.
“Love to watch you cum, love the look on your face, the tension in your shoulders, love the sounds you make, Master,” Harry lowered his tone, making it husky and dark as he whispered to Draco,
Harry reached around to grasp Draco’s cock in his hand and started to stroke. After only half a minute, Draco’s orgasm tore out of him and ropes of cum splattered the ivory couch.
“Listen Drake. I’m sorry. I know I’m out of line but the problem is, you have no other friends to tell you when things are fucked up. Best case scenario, he’s not cheating on you, but he’s making you a laughing stock. I know you’ve always had a crush on the guy, but you’re better than this. You’re the best man I know.”
Harry was thrilled beyond his wildest dreams, not realizing that Draco probably took him on this trip to surprise him with the announcement that the contract with Blaise was finally dissolved. No wonder he was anxious to find him a new Dom. It must have been painful to break Blaise’s heart, and he wanted someone to replace him. This meant that Harry could be his, truly his, forever. He could finally sign the contract. He instantly pictured their wedding ceremony, Draco in trim white robes standing across from him as they said their vows. It felt closer to his reality than ever.
When he arrived, Harry was preening himself in the parlor mirror. He was beautifully dressed in tight fitting black plaid trousers and a crisp white button-down shirt. Upon closer inspection, Draco realized he used Veela potion on his hair to get it to lie flat in soft waves. He wasn’t wearing his glasses.
Draco was an idiot. He should have realized this was happening, but had never experienced it before, so he didn’t recognize the signs. The giddiness he felt at the sound of Harry’s motorcycle revving outside his house. Being haunted by memories of Harry when he wasn’t around. Those were huge clues, but if he really thought about it, it began way back when they were in Turkey. He remembered the magnetic pull he felt towards him the day after they had first had sex.
Blaise furrowed his eyebrows and Draco could literally see a light go out in his eyes. There was no answer from him.
It seemed that another discussion was imminent, but Draco did not think it would be necessary for Harry.
Eventually, when Harry’s breathing evened out, Draco detached himself from Harry, and floo’d back to the manor to his own bed. He missed it. There was a calmness to sleeping alone that he simply needed right now.
Blaise walked in the parlor to great him. The man looked like sex on a stick. He wore an expensive looking tight cobalt blue t-shirt that brought out his eyes, and perfect fitting black joggers. Harry was always in his ratty old T-shirt.
However, two Doms appeared to be having some sort of competition, their subs bent over two tables receiving a counted number of strokes from their weapon of choice. Each Dom was whipping the submissive owned by the other, the idea being to see which sub cried uncle first.
Harry kissed his neck while he quickly undid Draco’s belt from behind. He unbuttoned his trousers and pushed his pants, along with boxers, down far enough to only expose his porcelain ass.
Draco’s body flushed with anger. The scene was too reminiscent of true play. How dare a sub speak to him this way? He tightened his hold and twisted his arm, nearly to the point of breaking. Harry let out a panicked shriek.
He became very displeased with him if he did throw a tantrum, turning cold and distant for several days, purposely. It was torture for Scorpius. He hated doing this to his son, but he was very good at it, having received years of experience from his own father.
He groaned at Harry's words. Draco’s cock rose to vicious hardness midway through and now, he was in pain. Harry feels it and lets out a soft chuckle.
Draco’s limbs had turned into jelly and could not support him, though he tried to remain upright. Eventually he sank to the floor, breathing heavily, sitting next to Blaise, their backs against the door, placing one arm over his knees in silent thanks.
He did not want to tell him what Blaise said. He wanted him to think it was his, independent idea. Besides, Draco would just dismiss it and insist that Blaise was just trying to get under his skin. While that may be true, it did not change the fact that he was haunted by his cruel words and he was afraid he might end up being right, in the end.
Firewhiskey. That’s what he needs. He flexes his hands and realizes they’re blistered—from holding the flogger too tightly. He can barely move the right one. Tears sting his eyes. He lets the damn things fall as he walks into the parlor. Then he drags in a deep breath and lifts his head.
tightly against Blaise’s back, trembling slightly, squirting the last of his cum in his tight hole. He felt instantly better, boneless, needing release far more than usual after his interactions with Harry earlier in the week.
He didn’t make a single sexual move on Draco the entire time he was at his house. He was his normal friendly, impassive self, both during drinks, and during the skateboard session. It was a huge turn on and made him crave Blaise in a new way.
“Fuck you Potter!” He kept swinging at him, and they were circling each other, but Harry was dodging him easily, choosing, wisely, not to attack him in return. He was shocked by his partner’s behavior. He seemed determine to beat him to a bloody pulp.
Draco wanted to throw him on the bed and fuck him right now. His cock was straining his leather pants.
A welt starts to form there and Draco hates himself for what he’s about to do next. He wishes he didn’t magic proof the room so he could conjure ear plugs. But he deserves to be haunted by this.
Astoria looked like she wanted to give Draco a piece of her mind, on what she considered to be disgusting about Draco, in turn. She remained silent.
Draco picked up his pace, jabbing at the exact angle he knew would drive him wild. Blaise maneuvered his tied wrists towards his cock. He only brushed it with his fingers once and came all over the sheets. Draco stilled, allowing him to finish. Then forced him to lie flay on his stomach, and reared up, on top of him, straight backed. Blaise had squeezed deliciously around his cock and his orgasm was close. He held Blaise’s ass apart as he thrust inside rapidly.
He remembered how Harry pursued him relentlessly, not accepting no for an answer. How he grabbed Draco’s arms hard enough to bruise in the men’s locker room and kissed him, without permission, for the first time. This is the man who thought he wanted to be a sub? Draco shook his head again, smirking at Harry’s obvious lack of insight.
Harry’s up off the bed so fast it makes Draco’s head spin. He holds his breath until he walks downstairs to find Harry at the kitchen counter. His whole body is taut, his shoulders heaving, casting thin and wavering shadows in the dim light of the table lamp.
Harry takes a swig of his bottle. He wants to tell Draco that it wasn’t going to help, that Blaise would never let him go, but even just saying it in his head is enough to make him light-headed with misery. He tries to stand because he can’t look at Draco’s perfect body crouched beside him a second longer. He gets up and the room tilts. He’s drunk. Draco wraps both his arms around him. His lips press against Harry’s hair. When he draws back, Draco captures his hand.
“He’s my friend, dad. We’ve been owling each other every day since we met. I promised him I would teach him how to skateboard this weekend.”
He was saying too much, and it was pathetic to his own ears, but he couldn’t help it. Harry pulls his hands away. His face is tight and pained as he detaches himself, presumably to go back to his side of the bed. Instead, he throws the covers off and lies on the center of the bed flat on his belly with his ass high in open invitation.
Draco said nothing as he climbed up onto the stair master for his typical thirty minute cardio warm up. It was Draco’s favorite machine, as he believed it kept his bum high and tight.
It was obvious that Draco was a dominant in the BDSM world. Though he was lean, he was also tall, and his calm mask of indifference gave off an intense sexual energy of authority and control. He imagined it was his auror training that did it, or maybe it was because his ethereal good looks inspired lust in every sex.
Harry hoped desperately that his comment didn’t mean what he thought it meant. Submitting to Draco was one thing; he had never considered that his submission might mean that Draco would give him to someone else to use.
Ten minutes later, Harry joined, looking relaxed, eyes down respectfully. The collar looked beautiful underneath the black silk robe he wore.
Fortunately, after a few minutes, a man of medium build and inconsequential looks strode forward. He was dressed like an investment banker and wore a gold metal band on his ring finger. He whispered softly to the submissive and stroked his hair gently. Draco could not hear what was being said, but he saw the chained man nod to him and the investment banker began to disrobe. He went to the glass cabinet and withdrew a gag that he tied around his mouth and a long leather whip. He stroked the leather over his ass softly for a few moments and then cracked it once over ass, with modest strength. The man on the table moaned behind his gag and Draco saw his cock harden, as it was poking out from the back end of the table. The man continued whipping him gently and the chained man’s cock started leaking pre-cum on the floor.
That always managed to strike a chord in Scorpius who truly believed he would one day be cast away from his loving family, orphaned to the commoners, if he did not meet the standard. He was very proud to be a Malfoy. Draco always made him feel as if being a Malfoy was not just a given surname, but a privelage to be earned.
With a sting to his ego, Draco realizes that he intends to treat him as no more than coworker in front of his children. Blaise’s words float back to him, and he’s seized with a sick desire to tell them that their beloved father was begging “Auror Malfoy” to fuck him like a whore, only last night. He doesn’t know what Harry’s playing at as they’re all old enough to understand what’s going on, but he relents. Hoping his face betrays none of the anguish he feels within, he steps back into the floo and vanishes without a word.
He’s only happy when Draco’s right by him. All his shaking’s stopped, and he does seem sedated. Still, every minute or two, he’ll open his poor, glassy eye and look around for him.
“I also don’t hate the idea of you choking me and fucking me at the same time. I think it’ll be hot, sir.”
Harry walked stiffly towards the door. His back was an angry red, but Draco hadn’t harmed him in any permanent way. He closed the door softly behind him.
He wasn’t used to scotch. Firewhiskey was strong, but not like this. His brain felt addled and he was enjoying the light touch.
Scorpius seemed to remember himself, but he was seething. He was a Malfoy, after all. He still had a temper.
Draco knelt between his legs and began stroking his cock lightly while generously lubing his hole with a single finger. Overly sensitive as he was, Harry went wild, moaning continuously.
"Open those cock-sucking lips for me, Potter." Harry immediately obeys and Draco shoves in deep enough to make him gag. The hot heat of his mouth is enough to make his eyes roll and he squeezes his fingers in his raven locks for leverage, pulling and pushing brutally, fully controlling the pace. Harry's mouth is just another hole for him to fuck, and he wants him to believe it. He knows it's what he craves. The back of Harry’s head bangs ominously against the door until tears stream down his face and he’s choking, hanging onto Draco's thighs for dear life. The savior of the wizarding world is on his knees getting throat raped by Draco Malfoy, loving every second of it. Loud thuds echo against Malfoy Manor's front door, and it's simply too much for Draco. He feels like he's in a dream when he cums down his throat in mere minutes, letting out a loud groan. Though gasping for air, Harry swallows it all with a smug look of satisfaction on his tear-stained face.
He did not want to hurt him this way. He needed it to be good for Blaise. He needed to remind him who his master was and why. He used another stretching charm, put more lube on his cock, and tried again. The passage was smooth and Blaise began moaning. Draco used his left hand to pull his hair and his right hand to stabilize his hip as he thrust inside, shallowly.
Being alone with the fire crackling and the book in his hand was soothing. He began to relax in his chair.
Harry frowned at him but followed his lead, for now. They both got dressed and padded down to the kitchen.
Draco braced himself on the back of the couch, bending over more, as Harry thrust inside him. Harry leaned over with him, refusing to let their skin part. He began thrusting into him slowly, but deeply, muttering the whole time,
He indicated for him to stand. Harry looked nervous, as if Draco was going to throw him out of his house at any moment. Draco removed his harness and pointed at the clothes for Harry to get dressed. He leaned against the dresser and crossed his ankles in front of him.
…I can’t stop thinking about those nights in Turkey. That was the happiest I’ve been in a very long time. I’ve never really wanted anyone before. All my choices were taken away from me. My parents’ death, living with my aunt, defeating Voldemort, becoming an auror, marrying Ginny. It was all out of my hands. This is the only thing I’ve ever wanted. And I know you feel something for me too. Don’t try to deny it.”
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
he let out between short breaths. At the sound of his desperate words and the feeling of Harry’s tight grip on his ass, signifying his end, Draco fell over the edge with him. They came at the same time. It was a rather, short amount of time, but Draco didn’t mind. It was just too fucking good to mind at all, really.
At least, he had enough respect not to fuck Blaise in his house, where his son slept. Harry…well, Harry was a different matter. He refused to think about him.
Yet, the temptation of taking Harry out as a sub in public was far too great. He needed to scope the BDSM scene to find a new Dom for Blaise, which would be another way to bring Harry closer. He already sent a message to the owner of
“A shrug isn’t going to cut it. We had an incredible weekend last Saturday, but I felt distant from you tonight. Don’t you want me anymore? Now that you’ve had me, you’re pulling away. I can feel it. You always make me feel like I’m not good enough and I’m trying to be what you need. I stayed away all week. What is it you want? I’ll do whatever it is.”
“Mmm, feeling you on top of me and in control is so hot. I can’t wait to have you inside me. What’s wrong with tonight?” He said between loud necking sounds.
Draco blushes. He did always like to watch, especially the sight of Blaise on his knees, sucking his cock, his thick black eyelashes fluttering. And
Harry lets out a sigh of relief and closes his eyes as he’s pushed on his back. He braces himself to take him, spreading his legs wide, planting his feet flat on the bed so he can push back against him, no matter how much it hurts. He needs this. Draco rolls on top of him, bracing his hands on the bed on either side of Harry, sure to not rest any of his weight. Rubbing their cocks together more, Harry is already panting with need.
Harry looks at Draco’s unconscious body lying on the hospital bed. The dark magic Blaise used was like a mixture of the bombardia and sectumsempra spell. All his bones were shattered and it was possible that the gashes would never heal completely. His left arm may never be usable again because it took the curse head on. His skull was cracked at the back, but no
Draco doesn’t know what to say to that, but he thinks of Harry’s last words to him the previous night.
so strong, that every single person in the park got knocked flat to the ground. Screams filled the park as the jet of green light streamed past and headed straight for Draco, but it was absorbed by the shield. The cloaked figure tried to turn on his heel but Harry snapped his fingers, and he was bounded by his hands and feet and fell over before he could disaparate. Harry jumped up in a blind rage and strode over to the figure with Draco hot on his heels. When he pulled the cloak back, it was just an ordinary bloke he’d never seen before. Harry was seized with the desire to kill this man with his bare hands. Drawing his hand back to punch him, Draco caught it, holding him back.
“A little to the left!” he laughs through his sobs, like he’s gone mad. Draco’s had to switch the whip to his left hand because his right hand is cramping up.
His anger towards him had died down, but his decision to stop the affair remained unchanged. Harry is the whole reason he was in this mess, in the first place. He was a destabilizing force in Draco’s life, and he imagined it would only get worse with time.
Still, one thousand galleons a month, over a five-year period, was sixty-thousand galleons more, than what Draco was willing to part with.
He walks faster. Suddenly, he has to see his face. Because he still believes that he will be the same man. His man. If he sees him and tells him what he’s finally done for him, then this will all go back to normal.
He did not think it beneath him, rather, he just wasn’t wired that way. Some people were meant to wield the crop and others were born to feel its sharp sting. Blaise was such a person. Draco firmly believed that Harry, most likely, fell in neither of these categories. He was not at the far end of either kinky spectrum, and that was okay. It was not for everyone. He loved him anyway. He believed he could live his entire life sustained on Harry’s love alone. He was used to living a life of control and denying his baser needs.
“But what about all our friends? Pureblood couples don’t get divorced. It’s simply not done. The shame of it…” she sobbed, unable to continue.
Draco can’t help feeling a sharp sting to his pride, but he ignores it. This is what he wants, he reminds himself.
“I think you two need to sit down and have a civilized conversation about it before that happens…I can tell Harry still loves you.”
The sight that greeted him looked like a scene from a pornographic horror movie. It looked ten times worse from third party prospective. Harry had already watched most of the memory. Blaise was tied down and it looked like Draco was working up to his fifth orgasm, already. Ample cum had flooded the rim around Blaise’s hole and stuck onto his dick as he pulled out.
Draco rushed forward to help him stay standing. He grabbed his sweaty body, but Harry was too heavy for him, and he fell to the floor.
Soon, they were both undressed and rolling around naked in the sheets kissing passionately. They both struggled to be on top. Eventually, Harry allowed Draco to be on top and rubbed their cocks together with his hands.
“Sweet merlin, Draco. You literally just fucked me unconscious.” And Harry starts laughing. He can’t stop himself. He can’t stop the pure unadulterated joy that’s swelling up. It continues until he hears Draco laugh with him. And
Draco’s not sure the table will hold him, but it’s big enough—and turns out, pretty sturdy. He lies on his back thinking of how horrified Neech will be to see this as this table was reserved for food prep. Luckily, not an elf was in sight. They knew to steer clear of them when they were together. Harry wraps his hands behind his knees and pulls him closer to the table’s edge. The shift makes Draco’s balls drop off the table. Harry’s eyes hold his as he strokes his sac.
You fit around me better than anything, tighter than anyone I’ve had before. You move like music on me. Honestly, it’s a thing of beauty.”
He insisted it wasn’t the sex. He had to assume it was the strict terms he forced Harry to agree to, last night. He imagined it was asking for a lot, as Harry did not usually operate this way. He was, by definition, not a casual person. He did everything, bravely, with his whole heart.
It took a few strokes for Draco to bury himself to the hilt. He held still, waiting for him to adjust, focusing
Ten minutes later, there was a soft knock on his door and Blaise walked in, shutting the door behind him, throwing up silence and locking charms.
He saw Harry cast a cleaning charm on himself, but he remained lying flat, trying to catch his breath. His head was turned so that his cheek lay flat on the ground, and his eyes were closed. He was naked from the waist down. Only his socks remained. Draco picked up his pants and boxers and threw them at him, startling him. He felt Harry looking at him, but didn’t meet his gaze.
Draco’s halfie bounces as he moves around the kitchen. It occurs to him that he should have thrown some clothes on, but he was worried. When he steps over to the table with two plates on his arm, Draco can’t help smirking. Harry grabs his hip, then his cock.
He started stroking it through his trousers to relieve the tension when the fire suddenly flared green, and Harry walked through his fireplace.
Harry was probably right, but Draco held onto his rage and all the tumbles of emotion he was forced to experience since Harry came into the picture. He blocked the sex from his mind and focused on his inner turmoil instead.
When the aftershocks wear off, Draco leans forward, careful not put any weight on Harry and kisses him gently. As they part, Harry lets out a startled laugh with tears at the corner of his eyes.
When they exited the door, Harry looked around the alley to make sure they were alone and pinned Draco to the wall. He held his wrists up on either side of his head and kissed him hard, his tongue swirling in his mouth.
He held strong to his Malfoy pride. He would admit no such thing. It was usually Harry vocalizing how much he needed him. This was the way he preferred it. He pushed backwards in an attempt to make Harry forget his request.
Harry tuts. “As if he has a standing chance against me. I’ll have him hanging by his toenails before he gets a curse out.”
Blaise worked in the Department of mysteries and would often sneak up to Draco’s office to see him. He did not know whether it was a blessing or a curse that Draco was always so near him, yet so far away.
She never raised her voice to him, trusting his judgment in everything. She was the perfect wife in every way.
“You want my cock inside you?” Harry leans closer to his ear. “You want me inside your tight little hole?”
When Harry looked up, he almost creamed his pants. His pupils were blow black and there was a new desperation there. Pleading.
Draco was doing his best work, sucking his cock like it was his life force and Harry was floundering, unable to keep still. Draco had to use his hands to pin him down by his thighs as he continued to suck.
When they reached the end, Harry jumped into the water and swam out. Draco called after him but he motioned for him to follow. Not wanting to be outdone, he jumped in.
He felt the covers being flung aside and Harry watching him from above. He did not look up, afraid of what he would find in Harry’s jade-colored eyes, but he heard him moaning as Draco licked and suck him down, sensually. Draco’s own cock was hard, but he ignored it.
It wasn’t a very tall waterfall, only about 15 feet high, but Draco’s eyes widened and Harry noticed.
He cast a quick cleaning charm on the couch in front of him and collapsed onto it, almost hyperventilating.
Blaise rose his eyebrows at that. Recently, Draco came to Blaise’s for the purposes of sex after work. They would usually go to the clubhouse for drinks. They exchanged a few long minutes of silence, staring at the fire in the hearth.
“Yes Harry. I may be the Dom, but you have the power to stop me at any time. I want you to choose a safeword now. Yellow means slow down or end the scene, but not the play. Your safeword will end it, completely. Choose something non-sexual.”
“Of course not Harry. You’ve been wanting this for a long time, and I was waiting for you to be ready. I thought it would make you happy. I’m sorry. Just forget the contract, okay?
When he returned home to the manor, he was almost grateful that Harry had not arrived yet. He decided to go horseback riding to clear his mind.
Draco didn’t mention that it was his fault that Harry was in the hospital in the first place. Harry had lost his head trying to protect Draco. It was also his fault that the werewolves were there in the first place. It was the scent of his cum and Harry’s cum dripping out of his ass that attracted them.
Today, Draco hadn’t an ounce of loathing inside, only remorse. He had fucked it all out of his system, last night. He stroked Harry’s arm lovingly, but he did not wake. He caressed his chiseled abs, down to his half-hard cock, and tugged it gently. Harry murmured in his sleep, but still, did not wake.
Harry instantly fell down on his knees and unbuckled Draco’s trousers quickly, pulling out his cock. He sucked him right down to the hilt, self-inflicting his gagging reflex. Draco sighed in relief at the blissful feeling of Harry’s warm, wet mouth and began stroking his hair, down to his cheeks, lovingly. This was all he needed. He just needed his Harry again. That’s all it was. He was just missing him.
Draco buried his face in the pillow and tried pushing back to fuck himself on Harry’s cock. He allowed him a few strokes before stilling his hips, firmly.
He laughed softly. It was a cruel sound. Harry hunched his shoulders as a defensive move. His pulse quickened.
And then it’s 9:45. There’s firewhiskey in the cabinet. Of course. He should have thought of it before, but he rarely ever drinks unless Draco’s offering.
Draco sighs, removing a collar from his pocket. This one is thin, not strong enough to bear a leash, but what it represents is undeniable. He turns and places it around Blaise’s neck. A shiver wracks his body.
Draco stared at him, for a moment, at a complete loss to what he was talking about, until Harry looked at his crotch and bit his lip, lustfully. He looked down and realized his hand was still on his hardening cock. He snatched it away. Harry was grinning.
Draco finally turned to Blaise who wasn’t moving. He kept calling his name, but there was no response. There was so much blood. Draco’s insides clenched horribly at the sight. Blood soaked his shirt and surrounded him on the linoleum below.
Instead, he went to his room and packed an overnight bag for himself. He did not want to sleep across the hall from her, after she was fucking, merlin knows, who. This was his perfect wife, the mother of his child, and someone was sticking his prick inside her, this whole time, in his own house. He felt bile rise in his throat. She was disgusting. She had disgraced him and made him a cuckhold.
you. You’ll see. If the stupid contract is enough to break you apart, then you won’t make it anyway.”
Blaise leans his head on his left shoulder and hugs around him, squeezing different parts of his upper body.
Draco slides up next to him on the bed, and he’s already half hard. Harry hears him faintly cast a few charms, then a lube slicked hand comes down on his cock, stroking him. It’s nothing like his own hand. It’s pure bliss to feel that calloused hand on his cock, the hand that was going to go to Paris and never feel again. Overwhelmed with emotion, he turns on his side to face Draco and kiss him sensually. As they kiss, Draco starts rubbing their cocks together, but it’s not enough.
Sensing he’s awake, Harry runs his hands down Draco’s abs. “I love you, Draco.” He moves lower. Draco is half hard and growing under his touch. Harry groans. “I’ve missed this.”
It seems like you just threw me away, for one hot, quick, fuck. I just wanted to hurt you, as much as possible, at the time…
Blaise was the only man Draco had ever been with, unable to trust others enough not to out him to the public. Draco’s reputation was a fragile thing already. He could not risk it. His family would be destroyed.
he was not going to let Harry scare him away from fulfilling his duties as an auror. For the last week, his work had suffered as a result of being caught up in their sexcapades. What a waste, he thought. It was all for nothing. He had lost everything for a few good fucks.
He left the gym to go to the lockers, without looking at Harry, and immediately disrobed to enter the shower.
He decided he had to wade this out until the end of the weekend, and then they’d discuss if they should go forward. He just hoped he wouldn’t lose his cool before that. He cast a freshening charm on himself to get the horrid smell of smoke off him before he want to the safe room. Over an hour had passed.
Curse the gods for this particular side effect of over twenty years of friendship. Blaise knew him too well.
Blaise searches his eyes, glances at his lips...then releases him roughly, walking away. He stands at a distance with his back to Draco.
This slow, sensual fuck was like torture for Draco. He was forced to realize right then, as Harry feasted softly on his neck, licking, kissing, sucking, and nibbling from behind, that maybe, just maybe, this was more than sex.
Who knows if Harry was really falling for him?  Who knows if anything Harry said was the truth, or just a result of the wolf’s poison?
At 8pm, he stepped into his floo to reach Grimmauld Place. Harry was sitting in the parlor, waiting for him.
Harry burned with anger at Draco’s expert skills that far surpassed his own and wondered if he had gotten so good at sucking cock from his fifteen years of experience with Blaise.
When he exits, he feels an electric shock of paralyzing anguish and his legs won’t hold him. He sinks to the floor against the wall right outside the door. Holds his face in his hands. Tears stream down his face as he listens to Blaise’s screaming sobs. The fact that he’ll only be in there for thirty minutes doesn’t comfort him because Blaise doesn’t know that. He eventually stops calling for him and starts calling for his house elf, Pippy. She doesn’t come. When Blaise starts pleading for his dead mother, Draco realizes he has to get out of there or he risks losing any semblance of sanity.
“It is difficult to say, sir…the things I want make me blush. I want you to take me whenever you want, regardless if I’m ready for it, with or without the collar. I want you to want me that badly. I wish I could wear your collar all the time. I can’t wait to earn the one you bought me. I want you to grab onto it and
When Harry doesn’t do it, he’s scared he’s going to hurt him, Draco shifts around so he’s on his side more, and he lays his cheek against Harry’s throat.
Guilt overwhelmed him when he thought of his Wednesday plans. He wasn’t lying to Harry now, but it would be a lie in four days time. There is no way he would be able to go through with it. He would just have to cancel on Blaise.
Draco woke up the next morning, smiling. He could not remember the last time he woke up so bleeding happy. He felt like a kid on Christmas morning. He stretched his limbs and they cracked ominously. He was sore all over, but he was hardly upset about it. To the contrary, he felt he could wake up with sore muscles like this, for the rest of his life. He reached over to the other side of the bed but grasped only sheets. Harry wasn’t there. He panicked and looked around the room.
Around 1pm, he received an official letter from the Ministry of Magic informing him that he was reinstated to full active duty.
“That’s not how you meant it Draco, and you know it. What is this game you’re playing? Are you that much of a coward that you can’t admit this is more than sex? Or are you fucking Blaise behind my back still? Is that where your true heart lies?”
Draco’s so conditioned—such an animal—that hearing his name from Harry’s lips makes his pulse pick up.
Harry fucked him hard and fast this time, with a hand stabilizing his hip as they both lay on their side. Draco was already spent, but his cock began to stir after a few long minutes of this treatment. He was only half-hard but the sensation of Harry fucking him, so forcefully, was incredible.
Draco woke abruptly at 3am in a panic. He had been dreaming about Harry. They were out on a case together and Harry got hit with a fatal curse, blood spattered everywhere. He looked over, thankful that Harry was safe in his bed, instead, sleeping soundly.
Draco smiled, watching his beautiful boy. His sensitivity and responsiveness struck a chord deep within him. Harry’s eyes were half closed, when Draco wiped off his chin, sucking his fingers sensually to enjoy the taste.
He didn’t trust himself at the moment. He couldn’t name his feelings but he felt a gravitational pull towards the marked man today. It felt dangerous.
“Harry, you’re overreacting. It really is just the kids. I’m sorry. I promise I’ll make it up to you, but I know I can be a handful. I understand if you’re getting tired of me and want to end this.”
It was the first words he spoke since their physical altercation had started. The words shot straight to his cock and Draco kneeled over his flattened body and quickly aligned himself. He breached his entrance and was completely lost, now, deep inside Harry’s tight hole. The squeezing around his cock wiped out every rational thought from his brain.
Finally, when Draco is sweating and shaking and can’t help it—he’s about to cum—he rubs himself over Harry’s hot spot and he shudders his name.
It appeared Harry couldn’t help himself. His hand began to creep around his thigh to the front. Draco couldn’t help but feel disappointed, for the first time in his life, at the feeling of Harry’s calloused fingers wrapping around his thick cock.
He started panicking, internally, though outwardly he remained calm. This was Blaise’s worst nightmare, come true. He had to do something to calm him down, but he couldn’t think of what. He remained silent, with his head bowed. After a minute he asked,
“Was your sub? Still is, Draco. He belongs to you even more than I belong to you. As long as that contract remains unbroken, his claim to you is stronger than mine. How do you think that makes me feel?”
When Harry saw he wasn’t going to be rebuffed, he grew more daring and rubbed higher on his inner thigh.
He noticed Harry’s cock oozing precum on his hardwood. He wanted to lick it off the floor but had to contained himself.
Harry felt like crying, but he couldn’t shame Draco that way so he blinked rapidly and looked at the floor.
He refused to think of him now, lest he go soft. He had a job to do. He started talking to get his mind of him.
By Wednesday, his hard-to-get act started grating his nerves. He hated himself for it, but Harry ‘playing it cool’ didn’t suit him. It was not his style. He was not cool. He was a man of extremes. Either he was begging to be filled, clinging to Draco like a second skin, or he was completely cold towards Draco, pretending to not care if he lived or died. The man had no middle ground.
Harry was shaking by the time he got to his cock. He was many thing, but an unskilled lover was not one of them.
Draco was trying so hard to keep quiet, but Harry’s skills were beginning to match his own. He could take so much more of Draco’s cock down his throat now. After a few minutes of this treatment, Draco felt his orgasm upon him.
Draco has other ideas. He scoots up behind him and starts rubbing his erection on him. Harry tries not to make a sound, but there’s a low groan he can’t seem to keep in.
immediately. Harry was moaning in bursts, still trying to keep quiet, as best he could. He saw Harry put his fist in his mouth and bite down. Draco wandlessly lubed his finger and started fingering his hole in time with his sucking. Harry’s knees weakened and he almost fell down, but caught himself on the wall behind him, bending his knees for support. Draco took his cock all the way down his throat and stilled. He swallowed so that Harry could feel the squeezing sensation of his throat muscles contracting tightly around his cock. His nose was buried in his pubic hair and he couldn’t breathe, but he was okay with that. He pressed two fingers up, deep against his prostate and swallowed again. Harry’s loud groans echoed in the shower and he tried desperately to pull Draco up from the floor. Draco kept his cock buried down his throat, as long as he could, then stood up at Harry’s bequest.
Draco’s hair was still wet from a shower. He was dressed in tailored charcoal colored joggers and a fitted light grey t-shirt that brought out the silver of his eyes. Harry sighed at the sight, but did not greet him.
Draco could not believe Harry’s brash rudeness. The man had absolutely no tact. This was a delicate matter and his best friend, not Harry’s. It wasn’t for Harry to decide how to break the news. That responsibility fell to Draco, and Draco alone.
Draco needed to taste him. He got under the sheets and plopped his cock in his mouth, licking languidly. He felt Harry tense beneath him, finally awake, but didn’t relent.
Draco thanked his lucky stars that he sometimes dressed in professional clothing when coming into work, then changed if he had to go out into the public. He tired of wearing the same thing every day.
He became lost in thought. It was only last night that he was fucking Harry in that Turkish hotel room, their hands intertwined as he worked him from above.
“That was before your new terms, Draco. I’m well aware that you could fuck Blaise at any time and I can’t even ask about it. This is pathetic. I deserve better than this. You try to act like this is casual but I can see right through you. I know you’re as invested as I am, but you’re too scared to admit it. I’m getting tired of this.”
Electricity was surging everywhere Harry touched through Draco, as he once again, became an unthinking vessel of pure sensation.
Harry nodded against the pillow, still facing the wall. Draco didn’t mind. He preferred it because he did not want to look into Harry’s eyes. He always hated how he got lost in them. Harry seemed to understand his needs, now, without having to ask.
Finally arriving home, Harry went straight into his office to conduct his daily ritual of jerking off in the pensive memory. It started after his conversation with Blaise in the atrium, a few weeks back. He knew it was sick, but it always made him feel better.
Draco grabbed his arm, roughly, to turn and face him and saw tears flowing freely down his face. He embraced him right away. He hadn’t cried like this since his mother had died. Now, it was because of him. He felt like such an asshole.
When he finally pulled out, cum began to trickle out of Draco’s hole. Harry fell down to his knees and started to lick between his cheeks again, apparently not minding his own taste.
Draco wished he could avoid it, but attendance by aurors was mandatory. It would be the first formal function he would be attending, without Astoria. The thought of attending alone made him feel exposed and vulnerable, but he would have to endure. He did not want to do anything that would jeopardize Shacklebolt approving his transfer to France. He planned to  stay for an hour and leave.
They kiss, so long and soft and slow, and then they’re twined together. Draco brushes his lips over his cheek.
Draco pulled the shirt free, so that it hung loose over the trousers, and unbuttoned most of the buttons, exposing the collar and his smooth, golden chest. He left two buttons intact, just at Harry’s waist. Harry didn’t want to look down, afraid that when he moved, the top of his cock would be exposed. Draco rolled each sleeve twice, exposing the cuffs encircling Harry’s wrists.
Harry regained consciousness immediately after the blood replenishing potions and tried to get out of bed. Draco was talking to a healer outside of his room. The healer with Harry insisted he remain in bed to rest, but he continued to struggle. She sent out an alarm with her wand so that more healers could come in to help restrain him, but he threw them all off.
His heart clenched painfully. Blaise still loved him, even after all this time. Though he deserved to suffer, it still made him uncomfortable.
As long as he took his altered wolfsbane potion, these crazed emotions would simmer. He’d see clearly again.
He senses Harry inching slowly in the room, but he doesn’t look up. Finally, he sees him kneeling in front of him and he goes to grab Draco’s hand. Draco wants to recoil from the touch, but he can’t. That’s how wasted he is for Harry. He can’t let him feel rejected for a single minute. He’s trained, like an animal, to not hurt him, even his body betrays him. His touch, the sound of his name from Harry’s lips, is enough to give his heart a little kick. Meanwhile, Harry is going out of his way to hurt Draco as effectively as possible.
“Were they tough? Oh, I don’t remember. That was the year there was a megalomaniac controlling the world right?”
He pounced on Draco immediately, gripping his cock through his trousers. He rutted against him viciously, like an animal. He began unbuttoning his shirt.
It didn’t serve Harry to continue to pretend like he didn’t have limits, and it was, after all, Draco’s responsibility to find them. Draco continued with the flogger, though his strokes were much lighter. Harry was sore enough at this point that he didn’t need the strikes to be heavy; they’d be painful in any case.
Pippy greeted him and informed him that Blaise was upstairs, allowing him to pass. Draco took the steps two at a time, intending to surprise him.
“I didn’t think you’d have the balls to offer me a contract if his was still holding. I always just assumed you were waiting for him to break it. What the bloody hell is this, Draco? You’re signing me up, just to be another one of your whores? Is that what I am to you?”
That stung his pride. Harry never attacked his work ethic in the past, yet here he was, degrading him in front of some newbie auror, ten years his junior.
When the trembling stops, he rolls off Harry with his eyes closed and tries to catch his breath. He imagines the sight he made, lying on the grass in broad daylight with his half hard cock out.
He swallows it all and wipes his eyes before he moves him out of his mouth. When he looks up at his face, his eyes are closed. Then he looks at Harry and his lips pull tight at the corners. It’s that secret smile, but it doesn’t reach his eyes.
Then, to his shock, he felt something hard digging into his thigh. He looked down and gasped, realizing that Harry was sporting a hard, impressive erection.
He opened the door of the laboratory where he was looking through a magical microscope, Jacob bent over him with a hand on his back. The room was deathly quiet.
“I know what this is really about. This is about your bloody obsession with Potter! I saw you cozying up with him just this morning and now you’re calling this off? Am I suppose to believe that’s a coincidence?
At that time, they had come to a mutual understanding that this was nothing more than sex and would always remain secret. Blaise agreed.
When he came out, he was naked, as was his custom, but tonight, he felt vulnerable. He headed to the wardrobe to put on underwear.
“Who knows, really. The important thing is that I get to keep my job. I can’t wait to get back to work.”
Then, he floo called his private investigator to find out about Nott’s financial transactions over the past five years. He would get to the bottom of this, no matter what it took.
Some of them were deadly, but Draco took a particular interest in one dangerous potion that was turning up in the schoolbags of Hogwarts children.
This appeared to be the absolute worst thing to say. Draco felt his temper explode in his chest and tossed his book aside angrily. It hit the opposite wall.
He was extremely rough with Blaise, to be sure, but it was nothing Blaise could not handle. He had endured rougher treatment from Draco. In the past, there were many occasions when he kept Blaise tied up for hours, torturing his body with pleasure and pain, not allowing him to cum until the very end.
Draco did not answer right away. He almost wanted to admit that the same exact thought had occurred to him earlier this evening. He had to hold himself back, as well as he could, or he would end up being at Harry’s complete mercy, lost forever. He could already feel it happening.
After they picked up the case files and were briefed by Shacklebolt, they found themselves on a snowy mountaintop in a small secluded cabin, in the middle of a snowstorm.
Draco was dizzy by the time he apparated back to Blaise’s to shower and change. Harry flooded his entire central nervous system. It was like he had overdosed on Harry, but it never seemed to be enough. The man was like a drug.
Keeping his head turned, he pushed Draco’s chest up to sit straight backed onto his cock instead, so that he was now buried completely. Gripping his ass with both hands to control the pace, he began moving his body quickly back and forth to bring himself to a quick orgasm. He put his feet flat on the bed and thrust upwards, hard and fast, gritting his teeth. In under a minute, he forced his orgasm out and shot his load inside Draco, before he even had the chance to cum, then pushed him off.
“I’m so sorry Draco. Don’t worry. It’ll blow over, like everything else does. I’ll stand by you in this.”
“You can’t be serious. You were going to let me sign this contract with Blaise still in the picture?” his voice rising to incredulous fury. The plates and glasses started shaking on the table, his accidental magic going haywire.
Harry was grunting, with every stroke, unable to help himself. His rhythmic grunts drove Draco to the brink. It was the sweetest melody. Draco could listen to it for the rest of his life. He knew it was a dangerous thought, but he wanted Harry to understand how much he wanted him.
After they exited the alley and emerged onto a public street, Harry realized he was facing the walk into the club. Wearing a collar and leash. A very obvious leash. The silver links glittered under the streetlights like diamonds.
Meanwhile, Blaise is still his, more than he is. Fresh tears spill over. Draco strokes his cheek and leans forward to kiss him gently.
Harry gave him a harsh look, but behind it, he could see hurt in his eyes. He walked with long strides past Draco, bumping hard into his shoulder, making him stumble sidewise.
I’ve been loyal and devoted to you for two decades and you think I’m going to sacrifice you to the bloody chosen one after he’s been on your radar a few months? Someone who doesn’t honor you the way you deserve? You’re mad.”
Draco exploded. “That’s the bloody problem Blaise! Ever since Harry found out about our contract, he’s been giving me hell!”
His anger was rising now. Blaise was baiting him, and he knew it, but he still felt like he needed to prove himself. There was no way he was in love with
He could almost imagine it was Harry himself, as their hair texture and color were similar. He closed his eyes as Blaise brought him to full hardness quickly, deep-throating him, every other suck, stroking his own cock in the process. It felt wonderful but, even this felt wrong somehow. Harry wasn’t this skilled at sucking cock. His fumbling erratic movements were missing.
Draco huffed in frustration. Of course, he was going to play the boss card today, the high and mighty head auror.
He forced himself to think of him now, and eventually regained control. This was for Blaise, alone, not for him. He went over to the drawers to retrieve a medium sized flogger. This wouldn’t hurt him or leave a bruise, but it would sting, smartly. He would feel it for a few days.
Hermione was right this morning when she was talking to Draco in the kitchen. Harry’s not himself. Not during the few hours he goes into the DMLE each day, and not when he’s here with Draco.
Harry kissed him back with fervor, in an explosion of passion, like he couldn’t believe it was finally happening and would stop at any moment. It made Draco stumble backwards. He thrust his tongue into his mouth and Draco felt it deep down in toes. He tasted deliciously sweet and minty underneath the scotch. Electricity surged through him. He had never felt anything like it. ‘It must be the scotch.’ That was his last coherent thought.
Draco gripped his hand and held it close, but it wasn’t enough. He made Harry got on the sofa with him and hold him. He groaned in relaxed pleasure. Harry kissed his jaw.
Draco narrowed his eyes. He wanted to throttle him. Only Blaise was allowed to call him Drake. Blaise smiled guiltily and shrugged, as if to excuse his behavior.
How had he fallen asleep with Blaise? He usually always returned to the manor to sleep, unless it was a weekend.
Harry scoffs. “Healers…children that graduated yesterday. No knowledge of the dark arts. If Snape were alive he could’ve healed him in a heartbeat. They’re probably making him suffer longer on purpose because they know his past. Or they have no bloody idea what they’re doing!”
If he’d taken his head out of his ass, in time to realize it, then maybe he could have stopped it in its tracks, before it grew into this vicious beast. Now that he could name it, he felt it deep inside his soul, lodged in, permanently.
Harry has never been away from him this long, and Draco misses him so much that it feels like a physical ache. Without his warmth, Draco hardly sleeps at night. It dawns on him that it’s more than just love, Harry is essential to his survival.
“That’s no way to speak to your boss, Malfoy. Do you want your badge revoked, again? You will do no such thing. I’ll pick them up whenever my schedule permits it. If you damage a single item, there will be hell to pay.”
Draco nodded to him and proceeded to the lounge room that was also guarded. The room’s entrance had two heavy iron doors and was positioned in the foyer before the dance floor became visible. Draco was thankful he recently visited as he now recognized most of the workers and they recognized him, in turn. The owner must have informed them of his arrival.
“No Blaise, you were absolutely right. What’s the point of living your life for other people? I think you should give this Jacob bloke a fair shot and see where it goes. I’ll keep my distance this time…”
“Yes, did you forget spankings hurt, pet? You haven’t received a true spanking in quite some time,” Draco said calmly, surveying the lovely handprint he’d left on Harry’s right cheek. He wondered if the environment of his office was making him more sensitive to his spanks than the flogger in the playroom.
Draco softly laughed in return. “I thought you were happy I brought you here. Isn’t this what you wanted?”
He personally led Draco to a heavy black metal door that was guarded by an oversized bouncer and was immediately let through. They descended a long, dark, staircase that was lit softly by dark red light. There was a small foyer at the bottom with a hostess who greeted them enthusiatically.
“Don’t be silly Harry. We’ll leave that for the evenings. The elves will watch over them while they sleep. You’re the one that’s been begging to see that BDSM club. We could leave the collar at home if you want. I think this will be good for the us. All of us. Come on, it’s Paris. They’ll love it, and you say your kids have never seen it.”
Harry was in much better spirits after their office play, and Draco was forced to realize that constant rough sex, though pleasurable, was no match for the joy Harry felt, playing his submissive. He worried it would take over their relationship, but he wanted to give him everything he needed. He also remembered that Harry was practically panting when he put his hands on him in public. He wanted Draco’s public affections, and he wasn’t going to deny him anymore. He felt like he was finally taking care of his boy the way he deserved, and he decided to kick it up a notch. They were just finishing dinner when Draco presented his perfect plan.
He comes harder than he ever has. So hard that by the time Draco opens his eyes, he wonders how he got there. He’s slumped half on top of him. Harry’s got an arm behind his head, his bicep bulging, and he’s sort of smirking at him, even though his abs are streaked with cum and one of his legs is still up on his back. Draco laughs, and his lips twist into something like a grim smile.
Draco waited for the typical ‘they’re all after my money’ speech from Blaise to explain why he hadn’t been dating recently.
Cum splattered his stomach and Harry was shocked by his sudden orgasm. He didn’t realize it had been building up for so long or maybe he underestimated Draco’s desire for him.
He couldn’t stop disappointment flitting across his face. It was there only a split second, and it was gone, but Blaise caught it.
They glared at each other. Harry knew how much Draco hated this junior auror who was ten years his junior and always touching Harry, any chance he got. He hung on Harry’s every word and it irked him, to no end. The junior auror sensed the tension in the room and quickly excused himself, shutting the door behind him.
He showed him a few more rooms, an upstairs drawing room that still needed to be redone, and finally, ended back in Harry’s room. Harry closed the door behind him and pushed him against the wall to kiss him.
When imbibed, they made the person feel euphoric, as if they were on a different plane of magic, an alternate universe where they were invincible. Consequently, it loosened all their inhibitions and made them very susceptible to suggestion. Not a good combination. It was being used recreationally.
“I expect you’ll go back to your boy-toy to beg his forgiveness. You’ll get right down on your knees and suck his cock, won’t you? That’s how bloody pathetic you are.”
Draco loved arriving at the ministry this early, as all was quiet. Draco enjoyed the stillness and instantly felt more calm.
“Ah!” Harry’s eyes fly open in shock at the feeling of Draco’s too tight hole squeezing around him. He shivers as searing hot pleasure courses through him and he locks his gaze with Draco, his half-hooded eyes are black throughout.
He cast the lubrication charm on his own cock, spreading it around and threw his wand aside. Without hesitating, he thrust inside all the way to the hilt.
“Oh pet, what am I going to do with you? One day I shall have to teach how to heel. But right now, we will discover your limits. Today and for the rest of the weekend, you will be in the collar. Is that agreeable to you pet?”
Harry’s behavior had significantly changed since he had made his request. He constantly flirted with everyone in the office, man or woman, making sure Draco would see. On the nights he slept over, he would leave his dirty socks and underwear littered all over Draco’s bedroom, knowing how much he hated untidiness. Then, there was the lack of sex. Harry knew it was against the rules for him to hold his cock back, for ransom. They had promised each other to never take their problems to the bedroom.
Draco sighs, detaching himself. He throws an arm over his eyes until he feels little vibrations next to him. Harry is trembling. Moving to cuddle him again, Harry tries half-heartedly to shuck him off, but Draco holds him tightly in his arms.
As he looked up at Harry, his face twisted in pure pleasure, controlling the pace from above, he became even more convinced that he could never be a sub. Draco never permitted his sub to top from the bottom, not in life, and certainly, not in the bedroom. His Dom inside ached to punish him, but he held it back.
Harry pushed up on one arm and Draco could hear him better now. He was alternating harsh panting breaths with straining groans, and just as Draco was about to consider him too stubborn, he broke.
The next day, Draco’s single intention was to focus on his work. He was letting his personal life overrun his work life. He made a promise, to himself, to work through lunch.
He’s white-knuckling the door, looking like an apparition with his pale face and his sharp-edged physique. Just one glance, and Draco can see he’s shaking. He steps under the shower’s spray with him. Draco barely gets his arms around him him before his knees buckle.
“I think we should get over there just before lunch time. They’ll have to leave for food eventually…”
Still, he could not help feeling a small twinge of disappointment at Harry’s absence, despite himself. Morning sex was his favorite. Sunday morning sex was particularly enjoyable as one could take as long as needed, without rushing to go to work.
Harry hung his head low. Draco turned him around. He bent his head low too, to kiss Harry. He only half-heartedly returned it.
turned back around to cuddle against him. He loved being the little spoon. He held Draco’s arms tight around his body and quickly fell asleep. He was likely, beyond exhausted. Draco pulled the covers over them. The smell of sex lingered in the air.
When Draco said nothing, he let out a cruel, shrill laugh, one he’d never heard from Blaise. It reminded him of the Dark Lord’s laugh and plunged Draco into terrible memories of darker times. The similarity was uncanny. It made his blood run, ice cold.
Harry felt himself completely weaken at the sight of his master begging and crying on his knees before him. It was a sight he thought he would never see in his life. His heart contracted painfully and he felt a sting in his own eyes to see the man he loved suffering like this.
He also frequently wondered at the reason for inviting him in the first place. Did he think they could be friends? Or was it pity? He couldn’t decide which was worse.
Draco went to his wardrobe and dressed in boxer briefs and a full silk pajama set. He usually slept only in his underwear. He crawled in on the other side of the bed and turned to face the wall, shutting his eyes.
“Harry?” Something soft and warm rubs his back. Harry recoils from the touch, lifts his head from the bed.
He supposed that the elektra-complex was true, after all. All women just wanted to fuck some version of their father.
Harry looked up at Draco, a smile gracing his face in response to their boys, but his face was like stone, betraying no emotion, praying for this to be over as soon as possible. He had three minutes left to endure him sitting so close. He could feel the man’s magic, potent in the air,
“Nothing happened, but it’s something I’ve been thinking about, for a while now. Please Draco. I want you to do it to me, no holding back. I want to see your dominant side. You always hide it from me. I love you and there’s no part of yourself that I wouldn’t accept.”
Harry pushed back so that he was flush against Draco’s body and pulled his arms around himself. His body was trembling, and Draco felt, yet another knife, pierce his, already, aching heart.
Astoria was more affectionate with him than usual when they got back from riding, tending to his every need. Every time Draco spent time with Scorpius, her eyes would begin to water as if it were the most beautiful thing she’d ever seen.
Astoria was sitting straight backed on the couch, looking extremely nervous. Draco entered, without a word, and filled two glasses with firewhiskey. He handed one to her, and she was surprised to see the glass in her hand. Astoria never drank hard liquor, only wine, and only, on special occasions. This is what Draco preferred, but he didn’t have to insist on it. She was the quintessential Purebred lady, without his help.
The impossibility of telling Blaise what had occured between last night and this morning hit him so hard, he almost felt winded.
over the summer by the best magical psychologists in the world, believing that it would prepare him to succeed in the real world. It did not hurt to know the information, when it came to manipulating people to achieve one’s goals.
Draco went upstairs to grab his suitcase, then came back down to the floo. He waited for Harry to come into the parlor to see him off, but he never came.
He knew he was despicable for even considering fucking Blaise again, but he wasn’t being selfish. It was for the greater good. Blaise had been so good to him when the roles were reversed, when Draco was engaged and Blaise was the single one. He had a debt owed. A Malfoy always paid his debts.
As they sat on the blanket, they both watched their sons chatting like they’ve known each other forever. They heard them discuss their fathers, realizing that they were both the sons of aurors and expanding on what that meant to them.
As Blaise thrust forward, it slipped out and landed lamely on Draco’s thigh. Blaise reached behind him to put it back in, and realized he had gone completely soft.
Then someone was prodding him with their wand, and he didn’t see him anywhere. He hates being in a hospital bed, so he tries to push them off of him.
She was right. Even as he said it, the idea of another man touching her gave him tingles of disgust. He would rather force himself to fuck her, and that would be disagreeable to him, as well.
A thrill of delight, his pride puffs up, and then he feels sick to his stomach. He’s pathetic for still wanting Blaise’s affections. He knows, right then, that Harry’s been absolutely right to be a bastard to him. He chastises himself. He wants to whip his own back with the flogger.
She gives him a few food choices. He doesn’t really pick one, but she returns a few minutes later with a plate of waffles.
Harry was already in bed when he stepped out of his bathroom, naked, but for his boxers, he assumed. He couldn’t tell because he was under the covers.
Ginny interrupted. “Have you lost your marbles? You’re resting then coming home! He could handle it, can’t you Draco?”
Harry shakes his head, sipping his firewhiskey. “As long as I’m with you, your life is in mortal danger.”
Blaise nodded in return and began to stroll across King’s cross station to the apparition point. With every step he took away from Draco, the longing for him returned and he missed him already. He felt pathetic and a little used, though he could hardly blame Draco for that.
“You must learn that you’re not to command me to do anything. You may ask nicely, and I may or may not oblige, but never give me an order. Commands are mine to make and yours to follow. Do you understand?”
When his parcel marked with the apothecary stamp arrived an hour later, Harry chose that moment to knock on his door and burst through, requesting a copy of a report he completed that morning.
“Don’t speak of things you know nothing about. You’re performance in my room today was appalling. I’m not going to continue with this Harry.”
Draco could not handle all the emotion in them, so he quickly flipped around, laying on his belly, and budged up on his knees so that Harry had easy access to his raised ass. Harry caressed his bottom tenderly, kissing each cheek, then moved to finger him. Draco smacked his fingers away. Couldn’t he tell how desperately he needed him?
“I just want your perfect cock all to myself, but tomorrow night is fine. I’m going to lick…and suck…and kiss every inch of your body,” he said between licks and sucks on his neck.
He rolled his eyes but got in. In truth, he feared for his safety. He read the statistics on car accidents and considered them death on wheels, but he wasn’t about to show fear.
Harry lies quickly. “You guys are a bunch of twisted fucks. What’s he need a Dom for that badly anyway?”
He let the aftershocks of his orgasm fade, and he pulled out of him, stumbling on broken glass in the process. It cracked and crunched beneath his shoes. The sound struck him with a deep sadness. He wiped his forehead which was drenched in sweat. He quickly tucked his half hard cock back into his trousers and buttoned them closed.
He knew what Blaise was alluding to with that comment. Harry did, indeed, drive him crazy when they traveled together. That’s why the very first thing Draco did the night he came back from a work trip was tuck Scorpius into bed and floo to Blaise’s for an entire evening of fucking. It had become tradition.
When he arrived at Grimmauld Place that night, it felt cold and uninviting. Harry had not lit the fire in the hearth. There were hardly any lamps on. He though that perhaps Harry had stood him up, but when he walked to the kitchen he saw Harry sitting at the kitchen table with a half empty bottle of firewhiskey next to him with a matching half empty glass in front of him. The kitchen was dark, lit only by a single candle in the center of the table. It impressed upon Draco a sense of foreboding.  Harry had his hands clasped on the table in front of him. He looked unkept.
Harry had cupped his mouth with his hands during Draco’s rant and by the end of it, had descended into chuckles at Draco’s limp dick bastard comment. He couldn’t stop giggling, but he was trying hard to hide it. He started shaking with the effort to conceal his wracking laughter.
“It’s okay, it’s over. Harry, listen, it’s done, you’re safe. Breathe. Just breathe, sweetheart, I’m right here. I’m here and I’ve got you, and it’s over.” Draco was shaking, he knew he was, and he had to fight to keep calm. The last thing they needed right now was his guilt and self-recrimination.
“Tell me your words, baby.” He strokes his back softly with the flogger, the heaviest one in Blaise’s arsenal. He always asks for his words. If he didn’t, it would raise suspicion.
He had not used his safe word in years. He did not have to. Draco had long known all of his hard and soft limits and made sure he enjoyed every second. His single goal was to bring Blaise the utmost pleasure, to make him beg to cum, before Draco had even touched his hole.
Draco nodded and Harry removed each piece of clothing carefully, like he was unwrapping a long-awaited present. He folded each piece and set it on the chair, until Draco was completely nude.
The first thing he does is conjure a small metal cage. He puts a black sheet over it, so Blaise doesn’t see it. He cast another spell to disillusion the sheet to act as a sort of invisibility cloak. The cage was Blaise’s hard limit as enclosed spaces have always been a deep rooted fear. Through time, however, Draco taught him to enter the cage willingly. As long as his master was in his line of sight, or he could hear him, Blaise didn’t panic. He casts a charm on it to automatically open thirty minutes after someone enters it, but he hopes he won’t have to use it.
Before end of day, he sent Harry a paper airplane memo asking him if he was coming to the manor, as he’d done every night for the past few weeks. His answer took a long time to come back, but when it did, Draco eagerly opened it, surprised to even be hearing a reply.
Draco considered him for a moment, shocked he was even asking. Blaise had never dared even approach him, since his betrayal.
That meant they couldn’t play tonight. That meant no training. No punishment. Staring at his plate morosely, he let out a heavy sigh of disappointment.
Harry sighed in relief as the hard hand that had punished him began to stroke his heated skin, soothing away the sting that had flagged his erection. He was aware of the throbbing warmth of his backside starting to flow towards the front, and his cock slowly filled again.
Blaise moaned in response. Groans of pain were escaping him with the latter half of the slaps. The sounds made Draco want to cum all over his ass, but the potion, though driving his libido to dizzying heights, also allowed him to control his orgasm.
It was easy to subdue his dominant side while Harry was so close to him, blanketing him with his waves of power.
“Yes, please sir,” Harry said meekly. He gasped when he suddenly felt Draco’s hand on his rigid shaft. The warm calloused hand stroked him just the way he liked. Harry spread his thighs helplessly, allowing Draco better access, moaning when a thumb swiped firmly over the head of his aching cock, sliding in the pre-cum that dripped to the carpet.
“Fuck you, Malfoy!” His face was livid as he sat on the floor, clutching his broken nose with one hand.
He knew it was wrong, but he needed to remind Blaise…of what? He didn’t know, but he needed to do this. He wanted to do this. He planned to keep his promise. He wasn’t going to fuck him, but what was a kiss between friends?
He didn’t know what to feel about Harry, but he knew what he felt about himself. He felt low. A part of him knew he deserved it, for fucking Blaise. The other part of him was inclined to tell Harry to bugger off, for all of eternity. No one treated a Malfoy that way, no matter what the reason. This was the second time he’d been degraded with sex in two days, and it had never happened before in his life.
He always took it so well too, never complained when Draco pounded into him too roughly or tied his wrists together too tightly.
Draco took this chance of having attention averted from him to glance passed the reporters. Hundreds of ministry employees stood still, observing the mayhem, with interest.
A number of men were receiving discreet blow jobs in darkened booths and unclaimed subs were standing or kneeling against the wall, waiting to see if they would get lucky tonight.
Even though several weeks had past, he couldn’t get the visions of a naked Harry, moaning beneath him,
The difference was that Draco’s usual disposition towards his son was very sunny and loving. When he turned cold, the stark contrast made Scorpius miserable. He would beg for his forgiveness. Scorpius adored his father and wanted to please him in every way. He idolized Draco as his hero, almost as much as he idolized Harry Potter, himself.
Harry, it turned out, was a terrible chess player. He never thought out his moves, in advance, which was the only way one could be successful at chess. Draco had already beaten him once and was going to beat him again. One thing he was good at, that Harry wasn’t. Instead of feeling boastful, it only weakened him to Harry more. It was very endearing, how terrible he was at it. He wondered if there was a single quality in Harry he didn’t love. He shook his head of the pathetic thought and refocused on the chess game.
His hard hand swatted Harry’s left cheek firmly, and he watched as the rounded flesh flattened for a moment, before bouncing back into shape. Draco felt his own cock stir. Never daring to take such liberties at work didn’t mean he didn’t think about it. This was even more exciting than he had fantasized it would be, and he wondered why he didn’t do it sooner. The sight of Harry’s incredibly beautiful body squirming over his lap, the head auror insignia on his back, ass reddened with two symmetrical handprints, made him harder than he’d been when he fantasized about it. He must really remember to thank his lover for this exquisite pleasure. Just when he thought his love for him had reached its upper limit, he found the ceiling rising to accommodate more.
Rumors were flying about Blaise’s persistent bachelorhood in pureblood circles, especially recently, as Blaise had not been spotted out on dates with pureblood women in quite some time.
“Ginny only needed me to watch them this morning…I’m sorry, Draco. I don’t know why I behaved that way. Even the kids got mad at me for being a prat to you. They know about us…I talk about you all the time.”
Meanwhile, Draco was considered a pariah in the Wizarding world. He was still scoffed at, even while out with his family. His wife, Astoria and son, Scorpius were sometimes with him when this occurred. He would leave Madam Malkins with his family, when a mother with her child would quickly walk across the street to avoid him, as if he were a leper. It irked him to no end that his family was still paying the price for his mistakes as a child.
Draco bristled at the pet name. He hated it. He often worried that the man bent over on his hands and knees in front of him placed too much stock in their arrangement, that he had grown too attached, emotionally.
By the time he woke up again, it was almost dinner time. He showered, dressed, and went downstairs to find Scorpius and Astoria sitting at the dinner table.
They both used the floo and vanished to the ministry together. Luckily, the ministry was bustling with people so no one noticed them arrive together.
“Someone better tell me why my two best aurors are making a spectacle of themselves in front of the entire Ministry. Fighting like common muggles, honestly! You’ve brought shame upon the entire department. What has gotten into you two?”
Still, the thought of Harry leaving him instantly caused a few silent tears to fall. They mixed with the shower’s water and disappeared down the drain with his will.
A house elf, Pippy, greeted him immediately, “Hello master Draco, can Pippy offer you a refreshment while you is waiting?”
Harry was standing at the side of the bed so he could see memory Draco’s face better and had a close up Draco’s cock sliding in and out.
Draco was still wriggling, trying to get out of his tight grip, trying to communicate to him that this wasn’t something he wanted. Harry moved up to bite his neck again, in an effort to subdue him.
Draco braced himself against the couch, a little afraid. His magic was still tinged with rage, and he could feel it.
“My” *thrust* “good” *thrust* “boy” *thrust* and then he stilled, buried deep inside him, cumming hard.
“No. I broke it off the day he said those things to you. The man has no social tact. He causes nothing but chaos in my life. I’m done with him.”
After a short swim around the rocks, there was a small cave entrance that could only be reached if you swam to it. It was completely hidden from view. When they reached the cave, Harry led them inside to a beautiful hidden waterfall.
"I know him better than anyone, Potter. I know the deepest, darkest corners of Draco you will never reach. He’ll never fuck you the same way he fucks me. He probably isn’t fucking you at all. He’s hiding himself from you and one day, he will tire of the mundane sex you have to offer. And guess where I’ll be? Waiting, patiently, for him to remember his true self and come back to me, where he belongs.”
He began to stroke his cock until he heard a loud thud coming from his in-suite bathroom. He got up to inspect and only then, realized his shower was running. His bedroom was the size of a large loft apartment so he could not hear it initially. He smiled to himself and went in to join him.
“And I need to know. Because Harry is my best friend, and there’s nothing more important to me than his happiness…Do you still love him?”
Draco’s temper started rising, recalling that Blaise, had indeed shoved his dick in his mouth, just Monday morning, because of Harry’s misstep.
As he strolled to his office, he thought about how obsessed he was with getting Draco to reveal himself to him fully. To treat him like he would treat Blaise. In his time apart from Draco, he spent hours pouring over books at the muggle library on submission. “How to be a Good Submissive 101” lay on his nightstand at Grimmauld. It was difficult to navigate. Took days just going over the different tools these sick bastards used. The problem was that it was for someone already in a D/s relationship. It didn’t say anything about how to convince a dominant to take you in hand. During his other time at Grimmauld, he revisited the pensive memory…
“Tell me about it. Any more emotion and I’ll self destruct.” Draco says, covering his eyes with his hands.
“Not that I’m complaining, but why the sudden change of heart? I hope you’re not saying that because of a stupid newspaper article. I won’t be able to handle it if you retreat, again, from me, after this blows over.”
It’s a beautiful sunny Saturday, and the park is packed full of wizarding families and their children. Draco sets up the blanket for them under an oak tree and sits cross legged as Harry lays his head in his lap, staring up at him. Draco never looks sexier than when he’s reading a book. Birds are chirping in the background as slivers of light stream through the tree leaves catching his golden blonde hair.
Tears were flowing freely down her face. Her enormous blue eyes sparkled with salt water. She looked so beautiful, even now. It was like a dagger to his heart. That was his last thought before removing the gag and bindings, and closing the door softly behind him.
That should shock him into action—and it does. His eyelids peel open, just enough so he can see how glazed they are. Then his eyelids squeeze shut. His shoulders jerk. He realizes…he’s shaking.
Then he shoves Draco up against the wall, covers his mouth with his, and rubs against him until they’re thrusting at each other. Draco goes for his zipper, and his hand locks around his wrist.
Still, he smiled, remembering how good he had taken it from him. It was just like old times. Though his muscles were sore and weak, his power had been restored. He felt like himself again. He unconsciously scratched his cock at the memory and realized he was fully erect. He removed the covers to find his cock an angry reddish purple. It was almost painful. How long did this blasted potion work?
His play room is finally set up, and today, he’s got a new addition. A Saint Andrew’s cross glimmers dangerously in the center of the room. Draco wastes no time in restraining him to the X-cross by his ankles, wrists, and waist. Harry hugs the cross like it’s his lifesaver. With a flick of his wand, his auror robes are ripped from his body and he’s clutching the cross naked. Draco walks to his trunk to retrieve a small flogger.
Was that his voice? It came out as a high pitched whimper. Draco was ashamed to hear it sound so breathy, desperate, and worst of all, honest. Harry resumed his slow torturous pace. They were twenty-five minutes in, by now, and Draco was lost in a haze of lust, his inhibitions wiped clean. Suddenly, he couldn’t stop talking. It was like a dam had broken and he couldn’t stop the water crashing through.
“Thank you bringing me here. I’ll never forget it.” He leaned up to give Draco a deep kiss which Draco half-heartedly returned. He allowed his mouth to be plundered by Blaise’s tongue before leaning out of it and kissing him on the forehead.
Draco laughed. “It won’t be that bad, Harry. You’ll see. You might enjoy going to the club every now and then. And now I think perhaps you’d better get back to calling me sir.”
“I’m transferring to the DMLE in Paris and could really use your support in this, Harry. It’s what I need to do…Please.”
Draco dressed in a flurry, not meeting Harry’s eyes. When he went downstairs, his front door mail slot was pouring in letters. He summoned a wooden plank to block them, but then they started pouring out of the fireplace, flying around his parlor.
“You won’t need to. Just going to pop in to take the potion, grab a snack, and come back. You’ll be okay?”
Harry smirked at his joke, playing upon Draco’s earlier words. Quickly undoing his trousers, he took his cock into his mouth. He blew him like his life depended on it. The tears only stopped as Draco grabbed his hair and shot his load into his hot heat. Even then, a few still managed to escape. He wiped his face quickly so Harry wouldn’t see.
Worse still, Blaise decided to reincarnate back to his submissive self who relied on Draco to make the first advance.
Draco laughed in return. His face was bright and flushed from physical activity. He was in a wonderful mood, both from the firewhiskey and the thrill of skateboarding. His heart warmed at Blaise’s generosity towards his son.
Harry had used him. Everything he said was a lie. Draco was mistaken to believe him, and he paid the price, not just with blood. The werewolves showing up, right after he was filled with Harry’s cum, was divine intervention. It was swift punishment for his rash mistake, a sign that what they did was wrong, no matter how good it felt at the time.
this was so good. Too good. He never thought he could love Harry more, but he was just proven wrong.
Draco smiled and nodded at him. He did not notice he was tense or behaving in such a manor to reveal it, but perhaps, it was subconscious.
Draco stood in front of Harry’s door, dreading what was on the other side. He didn’t believe in the muggle God, but made the sign of the cross, just in case, and braced himself as he entered.
When he arrived at the gym, he was unsurprised to see Harry with boxing gloves on, working the punching bag with brute force. His intention seemed to be to knock the bag off its chains completely. He was shirtless this evening, sweat dripping off of his entire upper body, giving it a wet sheen.
Draco dresses in tailored black trousers and a fitted black v-neck short sleeved shirt. Nothing overstated. He doesn’t want to dress in leather because he doesn’t want Blaise to see it coming. He wants him to believe it’s spontaneous, that Draco can’t resist him.
“Just finish that report and get it on my desk in an hour! It’s not alchemy, Malfoy. If you can’t handle it, I’ll find someone who will.”
All the heads of the department are called away to Germany for an emergency meeting over an outbreak of a magical sickness that’s torn through parts of Asia. It’s a more aggressive version of spattergroit, but some of those affected are not recovering and others have died from the disease. It’s highly unusual and there’s suffocating tension in the conference room, for fear that it could spread to the magical population of England. Their numbers are only just recovering, having sustained heavy losses from the war. It’s with a sick twisting in his gut that Harry thinks there could be an enemy with no face, claiming the lives of thousands.
Draco winced. “I don’t doubt you, baby.” He confessed, stroking his hair. He demanded honesty and he had to give it back.
Blaise is in his lounge clothes, fresh from a shower. His blue eyes are sparking like the ocean on a hot summer day, and he looks mythical, like the son of Poseidon. He’s wearing a flitted blue V-neck shirt and grey joggers.
Just then, Harry knocked loudly on the open door before announcing merrily, “Reports ready!” with a tone of bursting accomplishment, as if he had just solved the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
Blaise leaned close, now, whispering vehemently, but softly enough, so that no one around them would hear.
Neech came back quickly and placed an ornate gold jewelry box on the table. It looked very old, but still in pristine condition. He opened it and withdrew a solid titanium bracelet that had the Malfoy coat of arms. It had a myriad of protective enchantments that would alert Draco to his location, should he ever be in grave danger. It would also protect him from minor curses. He shimmied it out of its velvet pouch. It would only unclasp at Draco's touch.
After the first day, Draco finally finds out what’s wrong with him, though he can’t understand why they won’t just use a damn potion to fix it. There seemed to be a deadly reaction between the altered wolfsbane potion and alcohol.
Perhaps, he simply needs some time to himself, he thinks, as he dresses in riding gear, intending to take his mind off his troubles by spending the day with his horses. As he stands in front of the mirror, taking in his sand colored breeches, black knee high boots, and fitted black polo shirt, he remembers that it drives Harry mad with lust to see him dressed like this.
“Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” His grin was so charming it made his knees weak. He was too horny for this. He resented that smile and instantly slipped into Dom mode.
it was worse than he thought it would be.The paper made it sound like Draco bewitched Harry into it, using dark magic. There was speculation about a love potion. A small part, at the end, described Draco’s enduring love the

His ass was high in the air, his face down, pushed into the cushion, his hands tied behind his back. The vision made Draco impossibly harder.
breaking out into occasional shivers. Sometimes, he forgets how sensitive his Harry is to all this stimulus. He doesn’t seem to desensitize with time. Every time Draco slips the collar on him, it ends with his tearful orgasm. And each one is as delicious to Draco as the last. His arms are swinging like dead weight before Draco places him gently in the bed and pulls the cover over them. After a few long minutes, Harry’s breathing starts to even out. He doesn’t look up at Draco because he’s not allowed to,
At Draco’s silence, Harry rushes to get out of the shower. Draco holds his head in his hands, letting the water cascade over his head.
Draco was too tired to think of anything, while he undressed. He winced when he removed his shirt. The dried cum from earlier made it stick to his body, reluctant to be parted from the skin. He smelled the potent stench of sex as he removed his boxers, and it reminded him what an absolute idiot he was.
How much he hated him often threatened to overwhelm him. The fact that Harry had saved his life, for seemingly no reason at all, only increased his ire. That he had grown into this hulk of a figure after his awkward skinny boyish phase only made matters worse. It seemed cruelly unjust.
“Are you all right?” Draco asked softly. “Physically? There’s no broken skin and I couldn’t find any damaged muscle, but I’m not in your skin.”
Draco wakes up the next morning to an empty bed. Harry’s not at work either, and he finds out from the secretary that all the department heads left for Germany in the wake of the magical healthcare crisis sweeping Asia.
This went against all the rules. Though it was true sometimes a sub would act out purposely to receive punishment, they certainly never ‘demanded’ punishment. Draco had little patience for that. This was another example of topping from the bottom. Harry was forcing Draco, which took the fun right out of it. He was trying to control him.
He’s not moving around much—but his thoughts are. He replays the whole thing, mapping out the space between right now and their first kiss in the ministry showers all those months ago, using his auror skills like he might map out the crimes of a serial killer.
His eyes were cast low, still not meeting Draco’s, but he suddenly needed to see them. He needed to know how Harry truly felt about this night. What would be in those green orbs? Vulnerability, fear, hesitancy, regret? He reached up and unbuckled his collar, kissing Harry sensually on the mouth.
He dressed quickly for the day and went downstairs. The boys were already at the breakfast table, chatting animately, and Draco took his spot at the head of the table, immersing himself in the Sunday paper.
By the time there was a knock at his door, announcing Harry’s return, he was fully dressed and back in work mode, studying the case file. He opened the door with it in hand, reading, not looking up to greet Harry, but finally speaking,
The whole time, Harry just wanted Draco to hold him, but he doesn’t. Still, he falls asleep with his hand rubbing his arm. Draco stays by his bed the whole time and would lean in and kiss his hand and rub his hair.
“Oh! Master, please” Harry sobbed, boneless against the bench, but he still staunchly and stubbornly chose not to use his safe words.
When Blaise was satisfied by Draco’s hardness, he used his wand to cast cleaning, lubrication, and stretching charms on himself. He thrust his fingers inside his own hole a few times before climbing on top of Draco. Grasping Draco’s cock at the base, he lined it up with his hole, before sinking down on it, all the way to the hilt.
Harry didn’t answer right away, just kept scratching the parchment with his damn quill. Draco remembered the last time he told Harry he would be transferring to Paris. He’d outright refused to let him go, and then let Draco fuck him in the middle of a ministry ball honoring his victory in the war.
Draco was in turmoil. It hurt so badly to have experienced a Harry, madly in love with him, one minute, to a Harry who couldn’t even meet his eye, let alone, touch him. He reached across the table to stroke his hand, the way Harry often did for him, but he pulled his hand away before they could make contact.
He imparts a warning that the plug has a purple dye that will be released if he tries to remove it and doesn’t sleep much that night, thinking about how many times Harry will have to toss off in the night to relieve himself. It will never be enough. He advises him to wear tight boxer briefs and to bring a change of underwear to work.
He suddenly needed Harry inside him. He could not wait a moment longer. He broke the kiss and reached for his wand to case the preparation charms on himself. He forced Harry’s underwear down and pulled his cock towards his hole, trying to communicate silently, what it is he needed. Harry bored intensely into his eyes. They were full of lust and something more.
He practically runs to the floo in Blaise’s parlor, straight to Grimmauld Place. It lands him on the street outside and Harry’s wards easily let him through. The house is dark and empty. It’s only then that Draco realizes he’s shirtless, and there’s little specks of blood on his arms. He unties the shirt from his face and wears it, charming the blood from his clothes and body. He’s soaked with sweat, but he can’t be bothered by that now. He searches the house, but Harry’s nowhere in sight. He should have returned by now. Perhaps, he’s still at the office.
Blaise thrust his cock straight down into his throat and held his face there by his hair, choking Draco. He gagged at the rough treatment, but Blaise held fast and put a hand over his nose so he couldn’t breathe from it. Draco’s eyes started to water, instantly.
Draco moved forward to pluck the coffee from his hands and place it on his desk. Forgetting his no-fraternizing policy at work, he kissed him softly and embraced him, before stepping back.
Draco grabbed his ass with his legs, pulling him forward, just before his cock had a chance to escape.
Blaise did not answer right away. Lost in ecstasy as he was, he could barely catch his breath through all the moaning.
“You will find out in good time, pet. I believe I gave you an order,” Draco said with slight menace.
Harry’s kisses were like a drug. It flooded his central nervous system with pure pleasure, wiping out everything in its path. Draco hardly knew his own name. What he did know was that his cock was achingly hard and pushing against Harry’s through the thin barrier of their pants.
‘What in the bloody hell just happened?’ Draco wondered. He was still in a state of shock over the whole ordeal.
Harry could apparently sense his anger and didn’t make a reply. Instead, he stood up and embraced him.
Harry hesitated pulling back against the leash. “Where exactly are we going…sir?” He remembered to add.
Harry reached his door first, as Draco walked onwards. Before he went into his office, he turned and faced them, speaking in his loud, brash, authoritative head auror voice.
WARNING: episodes with non-con/rape elements can be found at the end of this chapter. Proceed with caution or skip this chapter.
Draco sent a quick reply back that he would, indeed, meet him at 8pm. It was the perfect time as he would be able to have dinner with his family first.
“Malfoy, these are all wrong. You spelled the names of the werewolves incorrectly. This is a rookie mistake. We have to redo the entire report now. Do you think I have nothing better to do, than to be stuck in your gods-forsaken office, all afternoon?”
after only two weekends spent together, one month apart. He wasn’t like all the other miserable wretches that bowed and simpered for Harry because of his hero status. The very idea was insulting. This was the whole reason he never wanted to give into Harry in the first place.
An entire day with Scorpius would set him right. He would take him to the new Wizarding Amusement Park that Scorpius had been begging to go to. Apparently there were flying rollercoasters that shot straight up, high enough to reach the clouds, and then back down. Astoria offered to take him, but he only wanted his father with him, as Astoria never stepped foot on a rollercoaster.
On a night several weeks after that fateful weekend of submission, Harry walks into Malfoy Manor, and Draco is waiting for him just besides the door. Hearing his flying motorcycle revving outside was enough to get him hard and leaking and flying to the foyer to surprise him. The minute the door closes, Harry doesn’t see Draco as he comes up behind him to slip the leather collar around his neck. He gasps as he’s pulled backwards by his collar and slammed against the door. The air exits his body in a rush, leaving him winded, and Draco has to devour him before he can catch another breath. He plunges his tongue in his mouth, holding his jaw open with one hand while his other hand works quickly to unbutton his trousers. The second his dick is out, he pushes him down to his knees and slaps his face hard with his cock... once, twice, again. The smacking sounds alone are enough to make him blow all over his face.
Draco resolved to never surrender to Harry again, no matter what he said. It was too risky, in any case. He could not jeopardize his family for someone who couldn’t be bothered to be honest with him. It was not worth it.
Draco considered this for a moment, and realized he did not like what he was hearing, but he could not say why. Perhaps, he just didn’t like change. His face fell into a frown while he was thinking. Blaise noticed. Relishing his response, he decided to push it further.
“I can do that,” Draco said, smiling to see the hopeful happy look in his eyes after the pinched, miserable expression in the club. He finally got through to Harry. They didn’t lose themselves in the fantasy, after all. Harry wanted him, all of him, with all his faults and all his sins. Draco was almost scared by how how happy he was as he led them back to the hotel for a passionate night of tender lovemaking.
“What gives, Potter? You say you’re ready to submit, but you can’t even follow a simple instruction.”
