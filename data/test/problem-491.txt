Harry Potter with a scowl on his face when they got a new assignment. Harry Potter with a distinctive glow on his face when he flew in the eighth year Quidditch games. Harry Potter in tatty pyjamas rubbing his eyes as he came out of the bathroom. Harry Potter shooting Draco a thumbs up when he got his NEWT results in the Great Hall, and Draco just rolling his eyes in return, struggling to hide his smile.
Draco propped his glasses onto his nose and blew gently at his coffee as he pondered the stockroom. He let out a little snort - he probably needed more stock for it to be considered that. It was barely past nine, so even if he opened the shop now he could still probably have a couple of hours to himself. He was working on a report about Angel’s Trumpet and its properties (both poisonous and otherwise), hoping to sell it to St Mungos. Draco set his mug down on top of the cabinet, casting a stasis charm, before putting on a face mask and apron. He walked out to the front of the shop, flipping the sign to OPEN.
"Make me, Potter." Draco held his gaze steadily, every bit the challenge. The darker boy stalked towards him, leaning in close to his ear. Who needed breathing anyway?
He shook his head, struggling to make sense of it all. He needed to clear his head, desperately. If he was careful, there was just enough time to take to the quidditch pitch before curfew.
It came in phases. For the first term, Draco Malfoy was quiet and reserved, giving apologies to almost everyone in their year who had returned, and keeping out of the way the rest of the time. The first few weeks it was like he was trying to disappear altogether.
Draco extracted himself as quickly as he could, dusting off his robes as Potter scrambled up beside him. He picked up his glasses from the floor, tucking them securely into his pocket.
“I’ve been working on it.” Potter had the audacity to smirk, and Malfoy’s heart nearly exploded. Merlin, he had a good mind to wipe that look off of his face.
Yeah, that's why he threw up blood last night - because he's perfectly healthy. Not. Draco stepped into the fireplace, flooing straight to St Mungos. He took the steps up to the second floor, pulling out the letter as he rushed up to the receptionist. He handed it to her, and she looked up at him with a perfectly generic smile. "One moment, please."
Draco hummed thankfully, sitting up carefully so as not to anger his throbbing head further. “Less of a bitch.” He murmured. He sipped at it, the warmth of it easing a bit of the tension in his body. “What time is it?”
Lucy let out a loud meow, and Harry flicked his gaze over to see her staring fixedly at the fireplace, and the next second it roared to life. How were cats so bloody intuitive?
“No. It. Is. Not.” Pansy enunciated each word harshly, pushing herself up. Draco flicked his eyes over to her, meeting her determined gaze. “This will be good for you, Draco. And even better for me, when I read it sober tomorrow.” She grinned.
The air had a slight chill to it as they stepped outside the restaurant, both full and warm and content. Draco couldn't remember the last time he had felt this happy. They walked on in silence, but it wasn't awkward. When Draco peered at Harry, he found he was already staring at him. "Your hair is glowing,"
“Work is rarely exciting for anyone.” Harry replied. He smiled and nodded to the emporium owner, picking up his bag with his spare arm and slinging it over his shoulder. He turned around, locking eyes with a familiar pair of silver ones.
The gryffindor took himself down to the drawing room, sitting himself down at the desk. He took out a quill, explaining what had happened to Hagrid, hoping he knew about what to do. If not, he only really had one more option…
Rita Skeeter sat across from him, digging in her handbag for what Harry assumed was her Quick-Quotes Quill. They were seated in one of Harry’s favourite muggle cafés, not wanting to be disturbed as they most likely would have been in a wizarding one. Harry had offered to pay, not wanting the awful experience of watching Rita flounder with muggle money.
Hermione’s spaces were mostly tidy, except her bookcase in the lounge; which had originally been alphabetised but now had books stuffed anywhere they could be. The coffee table in the lounge was scattered with sports magazines and coffee cup stains, and the bulb in the corner lamp had gone three weeks ago but everyone kept forgetting to buy a new one. Old TV guides sat on top of the TV, collecting dust, and the mantel on top of the fireplace was overflowing with photo frames of their friends and family. Down the hall, the spare bedroom was decorated in purposefully generic colours and bedding, but a box in the top of the wardrobe held Harry’s spare toothbrush and a pair of PJs he had once forgotten. The kitchen was filled with spare crockery from the burrow, and any missing items were replaced with horribly contrasting modern utensils. Cooking books that Hermione promised she’d use sat covered in dust on top of the fridge, which was covered in magnets that different Weasleys would bring from their travels.
This story started out as a way for me you try writing longer fics that weren't just pure smut, and ended up meaning a lot to me.
“Draco! Draco!” Harry burst into the shop, beaming from ear to ear. A witch and her child in the corner looked over curiously as Draco stepped down from the ladder where he had been restocking leaves.
“Harry! Language!” Andy tutted, resting her free hand on her hip. Harry ignored her, standing Teddy on his thighs and looking at him in wonder. He giggled, grabbing onto Harry’s shirt with his tiny fists.
"IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I'LL KILL YOU HARRY!" Weasley's voice screamed over the roar of the fiendfyre, but Draco couldn't take his eyes away from the dirt-covered boy diving towards him, one hand outstretched.
"I've - I've got to go." Harry blurted out, reaching forward and grabbing the cloak from Draco. The slytherin frowned, watching as Harry dashed for the door.
“Hit a soft spot, did I?” Harry let out a dry chuckle. “How am I supposed to trust you, Malfoy?” He hissed.
They lay panting for a moment, before Draco slid off and curled into Harry's side. Potter slid his arm around him and kissed the top of his head. Is this what heaven felt like?
“Yes you are." Luna turned to the Gryffindor. "Harry. You shouldn’t have been so naïve and taken the easy route of speaking to Rita Skeeter. Even you sounded bad in that article.” Her words held no malice, just fact. She then turned her attention to Draco. “Yes, the words weren’t the kindest. But they worked, Draco.” She looked down at Sylvia, making soft kissy noises at her as she scratched under her chin, seemingly unaware as to the need for an explanation.
Draco poured himself another glass of wine and almost spilled it when an all too familiar voice sounded behind him. "Its been a while, Malfoy."
"I knew I never should have trusted you." Malfoy spat, pushing the darker man back, harder, making him stumble back as the two grappled with childish violence. His words were cold and harsh, and some part of him knew he was going too far, but he couldn’t stop the anger and anxiety from taking control.
Git. A term Harry had long associated with a certain blonde Slytherin. Ginormous Irritating Twat, as one could interpret. Pillock, if one were so inclined. Pompous, almost always. Posh, indubitably. Stuck up his own arse, without a doubt.
But there was the voice in the back of his mind. You only have two months. You should spend it how you want, the rest be damned. He couldn't do that though, could he? That was selfish of him. Who cares about selfish? These are your last days.
"Oh please. Pansy knows everything." Draco huffed, crossing his arms. His best friend may have worked several floors above, managing the Ministry's public appearance, but she knew every ounce of gossip in the colossal building. "Now tell me where he is, so I can knock his teeth out."
Harry sat up to look at him, reaching forward to pull on a piece of Draco’s hair. “Of course I’m excited, it’s our six month anniversary.”
"I'll go for a BLT, and an americano." Draco answered, placing the menu back behind the salt and pepper shakers. If only Pansy could see him sat across from the boy wonder; she’d have a field day.
"Did you here that? Daddy called me daft!" Harry spun around, yielding the giggling toddler like a shield. He leaned into Sirius' ear. "I think we should tickle him!"
Harry felt his own tears threatening in his throat, thoughts of losing another pet owl too much to bear. “Don’t worry, Paeson.” Harry crouched down, pushing a treat through the cage door and watching Alfie eat it nonchalantly. “I’ll take him back to my house and speak to some friends of mine. Hopefully one of them will be able to help.”
He had never said it so explicitly before, so bluntly. But the thoughts had been plaguing him for so long, it should have been a relief to finally let them out. All he felt was anger.
It was a little over a week later when Harry was left in disbelief once again. He looked up as Neville walked towards him, then continued to stare as he walked straight past, leaning over Malfoy’s desk. He said something and Harry watched as the Slytherin gave a small smile and nodded. Harry felt the rage boil in his chest, and he gripped his quill so tight in his hand it almost snapped.
“Or three.” Hermione grumbled, sipping her wine. “I love you, Harry, you know I do. And I'm glad Malfoy has helped you out with your nightmares. But he hasn’t apologised to me yet.”
"Michelin Star, it's a muggle rating system. It means it's a very good restaurant, to put it lightly."
Draco frowned. He knew it was only small, but he hadn’t been able to get that moment out of his head. When had Potter ever been that close to him? Okay, so he had, but Draco doubted teenage violence could be put in the same category as this kind of tender touch. Harry’s skin had been so rough, but his touch was so gentle. And Merlin, his eyes, those ridiculously charismatic green eyes that were so vivid against his dark skin. They had been looking at Draco with such earnest kindness. He was so utterly fucked.
"It's taller than I thought." Harry looked up at the Eiffel Tower, childlike awe on his face. Draco couldn't bring himself to look up at it, preferring to look at Harry instead. They stood beneath the enormous structure, surrounded by couples and young families. Harry looked perfect, dark curls and wide eyes; a lovely contrast against his tough guy beard.
Maybe not. Harry scrambled away, and Draco turned to face him. He almost looked… hurt. The Gryffindor rubbed at his head, and nodded to the glass on his nightstand. “Can I have that?”
Harry Potter asleep on the sofa in the common room of the eighth year dorms when Draco came down to try and walk off another nightmare. The way the dying embers cast shadows across his cheekbones.
This was it. This was the time to back out. But Harry had never been one to back down, and certainly not now, with his stomach full of butterflies for the first time in a long time.
Despite insisting that Mr Malfoy's murky past did not involve murder, Mr potter conceded that the pureblood had been a tireless brute at school. Thankfully, the pureblood’s talent for potions opened the door for his redemption at Mr Potter’s hands, as a last resort, our saviour had asked for his skills to be used to treat his anguish.
Harry chewed on the inside of his cheek, trying to not let his annoyance show. "If you'd let me finish, I could tell you." He sighed. "I suffered from nightmares. More often than not, I was scared to sleep and have to face the monsters I thought I'd killed."
"Well, yeah." He shrugged. "When we're not trying to bash each other’s heads in, we get along surprisingly well."
Sylvia jumped onto Pansy’s lap, disgruntled at being left out. Pansy stroked her absentmindedly. “Are you wanking over him again?
"Don't even start Potter. I should have known your half-wit brain would struggle with a task as simple as this!" Draco laughed coldly. He had set his expectations far too high it seemed, because all his hard work had now taken a complete u-turn into the gutter.
“I know. Thank you.” Just then, the doorbell rang. The two of them looked over, and Draco put Teddy down.  “I’ll see you later.” He kissed his aunt on the cheek and ruffled Teddy’s hair. “Au revoir, nounours (Goodbye, teddy bear).” He didn’t want to intrude too long, and his heart was already threatening to beat out of his chest. He offered a wave before apparating away.
It was clear that Mr Potter was overcome with emotion, and so we ended our discussion there, parting with thanks.
“I think we’d better change the conversation before you find yourself in my bad books, Monsieur Malfoy.” Pansy raised her brows at him, sipping her drink.
“Well, I never claimed to be the best. I work with the owls rather than the customers, and one of them has become really unwell.” The darker man explained, crossing his arms over his chest.
"Yeah but that's different, Malfoy. I did that to you!" Draco smacked him lightly on the back of the head and held up his left arm.
"Real men don't waste time on things that take them away from their role at home," his father had once said. Mother took him anyway a few times, before he started Hogwarts.
“No!” Harry cleared his throat, “I mean, no, I’d...I’d like you to.” Was it hot? He felt hot. “It’s only down the road.”
{This chapter contains explicit smut, but also some key things. I have highlighted the beginning and end of the explicit content with this >>> _-_-_-_ -_-_-_-_}
Draco shook his firm hand with his own clammy one and followed him as he took them into a small office. "What is this about?" his voice shook.
“Bloody hell, Malfoy. I didn’t realise it would be this hard to take you out to dinner.” Potter crossed his arms. “And don’t speak french at me, you know full well I don’t understand.”
“I don’t want to hear your excuses! Let me go!” Harry grabbed draco’s wrist and squeezed hard, until the other boy let go with a yelp of pain. He spun on his heel and stormed off, but Draco wasn’t having any of it. He marched up to him and pushed him back until his back hit the wall. The taller boy pressed his body against the shorter’s, his arms pinning him down on either side of his head.
"Stop saying hurtful things just because you're angry. You know that you're doing it. You need to stop." Draco stood up too, offering his hand. He quickly glanced at Teddy, who was fast asleep.
Harry let out a loud groan as he stretched his arms above his head, his eyes screwed shut as he shook off the sleep from his muscles. Draco watched him from the corner of his eye, his gaze drawn to the sliver of dark skin that peaked out from under Harry’s t-shirt as he stretched. As Harry dropped his arms and opened his eyes, Draco turned away - not wanting to be teased by his boyfriend for being caught staring.
"That is a load of bollocks and you know it! You're a flirty drunk and a stupidly good dancer. Plus, who else would I go with?" She batted her eyelashes at him. Draco snorted.
"Yeah, it's good, great." He winced. "Well not great, like fantastically great, just good. It’s a normal amount of good, not like really good, like it's good that you're friends. Friends with Malfoy. Nothing more, nothing less. Like those bears, do you remember those bears and the porridge? You and Malfoy are like some perfect porridge." Ron's skin bloomed as red as his hair as the words continued to pour from his mouth.
"I thought you liked me mean," Draco laughed and pecked him on the lips, sliding out from under him. He filled up the kettle. "What were you looking for?"
He grabbed the rest of the ingredients from the fridge, and waved his wand at the muggle radio. "Sonus initium," he murmured, as the music poured out. Too much silence reminded him of dinner times at Privet Drive, the scathing stare from his uncle that he could feel on the back of his neck as he cooked dinner.
The slytherin tried to smile back, but his mind was racing; so it came out more like a wince. “Edward is a metamorphmagus?”
The blond spun round with a deadly glare."Je vais te tuer, jolie garçon (I'm going to kill you, pretty boy)." He seethed, taking a step closer. “The front page of the Daily fucking Prophet?" He screeched, any of his remaining pureblood decorum flying out of the window.
"Oh fuck, indeed." Malfoy hissed, narrowing his eyes. "Shall I read you an extract, Monsieur Potter?" His voice dripping with sarcasm.
“Since you’re here, I might as well.” Pansy took another sip of her drink. “I’ve got a plan, you see.”
“I’d love to, Draco, I really would. It’s just…” She paused, looking uncharacteristically nervous. “I mean, I was drunk too.”
Harry wiped his hands on his apron, pulling his best friends in for a hug. "Sorry I'm running a bit late."
When Harry laughed, it was like music to his ears, and he found himself joining in too. How were their lives always so absurd?
Harry unconsciously took a step back, feeling suddenly strange at having Malfoy’s face only an inch or two away from his. It was his turn to snort. “Jealous? What kind of bullshit are you on, Malfoy?”
“It’s gonna be a bloody scene in a minute when the two of us show up, uncoordinated and gay!” He hissed back.
Draco stood again and pushed Potter back until the back of his knees hit the bed. He reached into his side drawer and pulled out a pot of lube as Potter crawled backwards onto the bed. He tossed it to him with a wink.
“I’m sorry to barge in, Andy. I’ve just had a rough day and wondered if you fancied a BLT?” He held up the paper bag sheepishly, and Andy smiled before letting him in. Merlin, he was thankful for her constant hospitality. He walked in, taking off his shoes before he walked into the lounge. He settled himself on the rug, leaning back against the floral print sofa.
I certainly did you. I hated you, it's true. For many reasons. For stealing the limelight, for bettering me, for dismissing me. But I also admired you, envied you. Resented you, and myself, for my cowardice, for my choices, for having the family that I did, that I do.
Potter whipped his head round to look at him, coughing to try and hide his shock. "It's alright, I didn't mean to come on too strong." This was definitely one of the weirdest conversations Draco had ever had.
And, oh, Merlin, he was right; so right. Potter’s hair was so soft, and smelt so good, and - he wasn’t breathing too heavy was he? Draco dropped his eyes to Harry’s face. It was a lot closer than he thought. Shit.
The woman picked up the coins and placed them in the register as the jingle chimed again to signal his departure.
The writing was messy, the ink smeared in places, a stain of some kind in the bottom right corner. But Harry knew this handwriting, spent his teenage years seeing this writing, obsessing over it some nights. And he knew the writing on the front of the letter doesn’t match.
Harry pulled his hand away, struggling to keep the disgust from his face. "He hasn't given me a fake potion. For Merlin’s sake." He took a deep breath, pinching his nose. "During the war, I was captured, but had taken a stinging hex to the face. It just managed to distort my appearance enough that Lucius and Bellatrix couldn't recognise me. They asked Draco to identify me. He knew it was me, but refused to tell them." Harry looked away. "If not for him, I might have died that day."
Harry snorted. “That’s rich coming from the bloke who’s so in love with his own voice that he makes the whole year suffer with it.”
Pansy smirked. “Speaking of rainbows, that’s why I’m here.” She watched as the waitress approached. The two women both ordered pots of tea. “I’m quite surprised about your earrings, Lovegood.” The horns twirled around as they dangled from the Ravenclaw’s earlobes. Not only were they very expensive, it was very hard to find ethically sourced Unicorn products.
Draco took another swig of his wine, barely avoiding spilling it in his position. “Harry Potter, le garçon qui a survécu (the boy who lived). Rumoured to have had more than amicable relations with Hermione Granger, was seen with Cho Chang on multiple occasions, took Parvati Patil to the Yule Ball, dated Ginny Weasley.” He listed, holding up his fingers one by one.
Draco didn't know how much time had passed when he finally got up off the floor, not looking as he flushed the loo. He turned on the shower, stripping off and stepping under the water; allowing it to wash him of the makeup, the sick, the blood, the tears. He felt numb as he scrubbed his skin, not bothering to dry off before he climbed into bed and succumbing to the exhaustion.
{This chapter contains explicit smut, but also some key things. I have highlighted the beginning and end of the explicit content with this >>> _-_-_-_ -_-_-_-_}
"I suppose that's why I like you. You don't care about whether or not I saved the world. You'll still be an arse," he chuckled.
He nodded. “Sure. Let me drop my bag in the back first.” He didn’t spend much time in the front of the shop, except for things like swapping the owls over. They swapped them every three hours so that they all had a chance to stretch their wings. He spent the majority of his time in the aviary (If you could even call it that - it was so huge), caring for the owls and training the younger ones.
Draco huffs. “Maybe not. But tell me you don’t enjoy the image of his huge arse crammed into that cupboard.”
When their laughs died down, they watched each other for a moment. Draco reached up to cup Harry’s cheek. “We should probably get out and dry off, my mother will be making a toast soon.” He said quietly. Harry placed his hand over Draco’s and nodded. They got out, casting some quick drying spells.
“No, I’m here to stare into your eyes and profess my love.” Harry rolled his eyes, looking far too cute for someone Draco was supposed to dislike.
“Well, that’s good at least.” Ron said distractedly. He was always so impressed with television. “Sometimes I wish I could tell my dad about this stuff, but he’d go mental, never leave me or you alone.” He added, nodding at the TV.
The restaurant opens up to reveal high ceilings and white stone walls, with draping fabrics and low lighting. It's reasonably quiet, and the waitress shows them to a corner table with a large potted plant, giving the illusion of being alone. The whole atmosphere is intimate and luxurious, and Draco has to admit he is impressed.
The barn owl flew up to him, landing on his shoulder with an affectionate peck on the ear. “Hey, Alfie.” Harry said softly, giving him a treat. “You okay?” The bird nudged him, and he took that as a yes. “Glad to hear it, I’ll come see you later, okay? I need to sort all the mess out first.”
Neville’s cheeks bloomed red, taking in the sight of all of his friends' faces staring at him. “Umm…”
“Why would they have sex on your bed? They have their own beds that are perfectly fine for such things.”
Luna had brought him shopping with her after their lunch together; and had explained how the muggles raised money for charity by donating their unwanted things. It was like a much more humble version of the charity auctions that Draco had attended, but without the chandeliers, suits and cocktail dresses. He quite liked the idea. The ‘something filled with love’ ended up being a well worn, tassled, brown leather jacket from over a decade ago. He had been informed that Ginny loved it.
Barely a moment later, the doorbell rang. Deciding to let Kreacher deal with it, Harry continued fussing Lucy.
“Ah, ah. Play nice Tedster.” Harry said, running his hands through the boy’s black hair. It was much like his own. He supposed Remus' must have been the same colour when he was young. “You say ‘old hens’ as if you’re well into your seventies.” He shakes his head in mock disappointment at Andy. “You haven’t even reached your forty-eighth birthday yet.”
Mr Potter has recently been in contact with his old rival; Mr Draco Malfoy. A pureblood ex-death eater, Mr Malfoy's ample inheritance no doubt encouraged his newfound clamber back to respectable society. When I enquired as to the reason for their reignited communication, Mr Potter admitted that he had fallen far into the grisly pit of despair, and that he had felt this was his only choice.
Draco was still more than ten paces away from her, but could feel the older witch’s eyes practically piercing his soul. “Uhm, yes. Nice to meet you.” He walked forwards, extending his hand. Peason shook it briskly.
Draco looked up at her, an enthusiastic smile on his face. "Can we do that thing that the muggles were doing?"
“Can be easily cleaned.” Draco finishes, pushing the curls that had stuck to Harry’s wet eyes away from his face. “Talk to me.” He whispers the words, letting his voice fill with sincerity.
“You are going to listen to me, Harry, because I swear to Merlin I have not been planning tomorrow for weeks just for your Gryffindor pride to ruin it.” Draco looked down at Harry and took a calming breath when he realised he wasn’t looking back at him. “Baby, look at me.” Draco tilted Harry’s chin up, until green eyes shone into his grey ones.
"Well...yeah." Potter ran a hand through his curls nervously, only helping to add to the chaos on top of his head.
His pearly companion trotted ahead of him, her collar jingling excitedly as she jumped on the counter with her loudest meow so far that morning. “Yes, yes. I know, Sylly. You’d think I’d been starving you.” He tutted at her, offering her a condoling scratch under the chin. He made his way through the door behind the counter, the cat flap sounding just behind him. The back of the shop was equal in size to the front; comprised of the stock room, brewing room and la chambre cozy (the cozy room). The first two were through to his left, and he stood in the latter, waving his wand absentmindedly at the kettle as he searched for the cat biscuits. He topped up the bowl before hanging up his coat.
Harry thought it over. What bad could come from it? He’d simply owl Rita Skeeter (no doubt Hermione knew her address) and request an interview. She’d jump at the chance. And, this way, if it went well, Malfoy might actually owe him a bit; which was always a good thing.
How had it taken him so long to realise this? Teddy was nearly two! Everytime Draco saw him, Teddy had had white hair. Once or twice, he had caught a glimpse of lighter brown hair, but had blamed it on a trick of the light, because whenever he was there, his hair had been white. He supposed it should be a compliment, though since he lived with Andromeda, he probably didn’t find her brown hair very exciting.
The two men headed out of the Great Hall together. Harry was so distracted he almost didn’t recognise the head of white blond hair standing just outside the doors.
"Come for me, Draco," Harry whispered, and Merlin's tits, who was Draco to say no to that. He fucked him harder, panting, but it was the face Harry was making that tipped him over.  The sight of Harry Potter underneath him, dark curls stuck to his forehead, lips parted in ecstasy as he chased his own orgasm, was one Draco knew he would never forget.
The blond’s heart sunk, and he slowly turned his head, offering a politely surprised smile. “Balveer! What brings you here?”
“My eyes!” Ron squealed, immediately covering his face with his hands. “My eyes!” He screamed again.
They ordered some cocktails, and Draco thanked the waitress. He turned back to Harry to find him already staring.
“Can I help you with something, Potter? Or are you planning to just stand there gaping?” The blond crossed his arms across his chest. Harry had to fight the urge to pinch himself after not seeing him for so long. This had to be some kind of joke. Why would he come to Malfoy for help? Of all the people in the world, he doubted anyone could top the list for "Most Awkward Person To Discuss Trauma Nightmares With" except Malfoy. Then again, there weren’t many people Harry did want to discuss them with. He mentally cursed. If it had been anyone except Luna who told him to come here, he would have marched right out and sent them a very 'expressive' owl (as Hermione would put it).
The Gryffindor thought over his argument with Malfoy, and the one before that, and the one before that… “Is it bad that I quite enjoy being angry?” He leant closer, his voice low. “The arguments, the adrenaline.”
Draco was faintly aware of a vibrating next to his thigh, and it seemed to be getting louder by the second. He pulled away as Potter sighed and pulled his vibrating wand from his Pocket. He tapped it to his palm.
“Okay, yeah. I’m starting some new potions to help with it.” The previous night had been just as Draco described. This time, as Nagini had slinked towards him in the rubble of the castle, Hermione’s screams had been replaced with laughter. When he turned to her, she was sitting on his sofa next to Ron, glass of wine in hand.
The sight of Potter's flabbergasted face was both adorable and hilarious. He really was easy to read.
“Yes! He’s back with Paeson now, and she’s so happy, Merlin, I’ve never seen her so happy.” Harry reached forward to clasp Draco’s hand without thinking. “Thank you, Draco.”
“It is?” Harry’s heart felt like it might explode out of his chest. What was Malfoy saying? It couldn’t be...that he returned Harry’s feelings? Surely not.
“Don’t pout like that. It’s my mother-” Draco started, but was cut off by Harry holding up his hand and standing up.
“PANSY!” Draco lurched forwards, his stomach doing the same. Merlin, anxiety and alcohol did not mix well.
“I’m making enchilada’s tonight mate. Sound good?” Ron’s voice carried to Harry from the kitchen as he kicked off his shoes. He was back around Hermione and Ron’s again tonight - he should really host the next meal. Their flat was one of Harry’s favourite places, decorated in blues and golds and filled with things that were just so them.
Harry thought it over. Passion? The reasoning made sense...for anyone but Malfoy. Harry certainly felt strongly for him; a strong sense of hatred and loathing. But what Ginny was describing was different. She was describing something other than hatred…
“I don’t know, I just…” Harry trailed off, rethinking talking to Ginny. They weren’t as close as he was to Hermione or Ron, but she was still his friend and maybe a fresh set of eyes could  be helpful.
"No, as he is the reason for my betterment. I'm very thankful that he could help me with this. Malfoy has recently opened his own potion shop, Grotte aux Remèdes. I hope someone might hear my story and go there, and that they might find the help they need." He said, his hands shaking.
And then Harry heard a hiss in his ear, so close it made him sick, and he turned to see the blood red eyes of Voldemort as Nagini's fangs pierced him. Instead of the usual darkness, he opened his eyes to meet a pair of chocolate ones.
"Ah. I'm sorry mate. Everything has to be so official, doesn't it?" Harry turned back to the chopping board, his friend's weirdness slowly drifting from his mind.
"So is everyone, doesn't mean I can't try and charm my best friend," she winked at him and Draco smirked.
“Ah, Harry. Just in time. Could you help me swap them out?” The older woman greeted him with a nod. Paeson was probably in her early fifties, and was fit for her age. She was a very straightforward woman, who could easily be mistaken for cold; which was not helped by her grey hair being shaved short in a typically masculine style.
They sat down in the dying sunlight of the early evening and Draco winked at Harry. “Thank Merlin for my inheritance; it does make romantic dates easier when you can secure such a fantastic view.”
“Yes, but it’s been playing on my mind ever since. Is it really so far-fetched to think that maybe he wants to do well?”
“There’s nothing to sort out, Potter. That article is completely your fault.” Draco sniffed, walking back around the counter, wanting to distance them.
Harry pushed open the door to Eeylops Owl Emporium, the jingle of the bell above the door making the woman behind the counter raise her head from where she had been wiping it down. The shop was dark, seemingly suspended in a constant state of twilight, and smelt earthy, like dirt and straw.
"Hermione got me the shirt, as a Christmas present," he pointed down at his chest. "We have matching ones," he chuckled.
“I’m good. Got a whole day of first years today, you’d think they’d be better behaved this far into the year, but they can still be a bit tricky.”
And with that, he walked off down the street. Harry watched him go, his mind reeling from how fast the past 10 minutes had gone. He looked down at the card.
Draco flooed to the nearest stop to the restaurant, casting a quick dusting spell over his coat to get rid of any ash. It was a Monday night, and the London streets were pretty quiet, Draco slipping easily into the gentle flow of the people on the pavement. He reached the restaurant and looked at his watch. 6.59PM.
“Can’t sleep?” She plucked one from the bag, biting into it and leaving a smudge of sugar on her lips.
"Thank you for doing this with me, Luna." Harry said. The anger from earlier sat just barely contained inside of him, after having read the Daily Prophet article. It was full of lies and mis-truths, exaggerations and embellishments. Why had he thought he could trust Rita Skeeter?
“Look, I’m sorry, okay? It might go well, you never know. I do sometimes have good ideas, and honesty is always the best pol-”
Maybe it was the excitement? Harry nodded to himself as he walked down the street, his mind racing. Yes, that must be it.
The Dark Mark was no longer black, instead looking itself like scar tissue, pink skin winding intricately over Draco's otherwise pale arm.
“Good Afternoon, Malfoy.” Harry said, pulling his scarf down as the woman left. He could make out Sylvia napping on a large cushion behind the counter. Now he was here, he could feel his nerves starting to flutter in his stomach.
Just when all hope seemed lost, an angel appeared, white halo glowing from the light outside. Well, maybe angel was an exaggeration, especially when it came to this particular Slytherin. Harry locked eyes with Malfoy across the bar, shock flashing across his face. What in Merlin’s name was he doing here?
Harry sat on the bar stool next to her, pulling a couple of beers out of the carrier bag he’d brought with him. He opened the first, sliding it over to Ron, before cracking open his own.
"What would you prefer? Want me to push you up against a wall with my fists in your robes like we're back at Hogwarts?" Draco choked on his drink, an all too enticing image dancing in his mind.
~You should really clean up Teddy’s toys, Harry.~ She had laughed, and when Harry turned back to Nagini, all he saw was a toy snake on his rug. Hermione picked it up, shaking her head. ~If I’d had anymore to drink, I would have thought this was real.~
It wasn’t long until he did see it with his own eyes. Malfoy was working quickly, and with every friend Harry lost to an apology, his confusion and anger only grew.
He didn't have to tell Harry twice. The Gryffindor took off again at a jog, back up to the common room. He needed to talk to someone, get these feelings out in the open, or he wouldn't sleep. When he entered the empty common room, he went over to the base of the girl's staircase.
His breathing came fast and the room spun around him. He kicked off his shoes as he fell onto his bed. He closed his eyes, counting his breaths until sleep fell over him.
“Andromeda gave it to me. I didn’t realise you were Edward’s god-father. I went and asked her on the off chance she had it from when you were in The Order, but apparently you see each other regularly.” Draco explained, raising an eyebrow on his aristocratic face. He walked over and sat in one of the plush armchairs.
“She always comes back having had a good time.” Ginny added, kissing her girlfriend on the cheek from where she sat with her arm thrown around the Ravenclaw. “I’m not his biggest fan, but Luna likes him and that’s enough for me.”
"Merlin tits. Bring him up if you must." Harry snapped. He almost felt bad, but he didn’t have the energy to process the guilt as well as his anger at that moment.
The blond’s heart stuttered. “Harry?” He whispered. He opened the door further, taking a couple of steps inside. “Harry?” He asked again, louder.
I hope you're free. I said we'd do something more low-key next time - how about a canal-side walk and an icecream on me?
He kissed Potter's chest, then his shoulders, then his neck, and finally his mouth. He looked into his bright green eyes as he lined his cock up. "Are you ready?" Potter held his gaze and nodded.
Draco pressed his hand to Potter's cheek and used the other to bring him closer. He gasped into the kiss and Draco took it as an opportunity to deepen the kiss. He licked Potter's lip carefully and he reacted beautifully, moaning and kissing him harder.
He slapped his cheeks, trying to get some colour in them. He plastered on his smile in the mirror, and turned around.
The voice boomed from the tip and Potter sighed. Draco looked up from his wand to his face. He looked thoroughly fucked, and they hadn't even had sex. His lips were slightly swollen, his face flushed and his hair sticking out even more than usual. Draco wanted to find out what he actually looked like after sex.
Draco couldn't stop himself as he began sobbing, curling up in a ball on his bathroom floor. The tears left black smudges on his hands and shirt, and he gasped for breath, pulling at his hair. He cried for his mother, for the times he had shouted at her, not realising how much she loved him. He cried for his friends, for the times he had ditched them. He cried for his future, one that he would never have. He pressed his face into the floor, as his breathing slowed, his eyes screwed shut.
Grabbing his broom and invisibility cloak from the dorms, Harry crept back through the common room and out the portrait hole, making his way through the castle. The sky was clear, the air crisp, and the Gryffindor team captain was eager to make the most of it.
He caught a glimpse of Luna and Tonks at the next table over. Walking over, he shook his head. “You should tell your husband not to be so rude.” He joked, sitting down. Again, nothing.
"Two….Two months…" Draco repeated quietly, mostly to himself. So this was it, this was to be his final time in this world. It was almost funny how he had spent so many years fearing he would die the next day, and now he had just started to manage to enjoy life, it was all to end.
“Homophobic?” Malfoy asked, somehow shocked. “I’m not homophobic!” He laughed, making Harry’s anger only deepen.
“No you didn’t. But you almost barrelled me over, so you must have been quite determined to get here.”
“We’re fine, Jolie garçon (pretty boy).” Malfoy copied his expression, steeling himself. “I’m sorry too. I say vicious things sometimes.” He looked away, his nerves too much. “If I get through these customers without getting my bollocks hexed off, I’ll even take back all of the things I’ve said.” He chuckled, nervously.
Harry thought it over. At least he wouldn't be harassed by anyone, plus it would be interesting to see Malfoy in a muggle environment.
“Good thing I’m staying then. No one will dare to hurt you if I’m here.” Harry gave him a small smile, thankful to have Malfoy back on his side. Merlin, he never thought he’d think that.
“Why don’t you take a picture? It’ll last longer.” He winked up at him. Potter took a few steps back and held up his hands like he was taking a picture.
Draco suddenly screamed as a singular bee strayed from the group, moving a whole half a foot closer. He pulled on Harry’s trousers tighter, and the Gryffindor stumbled, pulled dangerously close. He grabbed Draco’s shoulders for stability but since Draco was pulling so tightly, it just pushed them both over. They fell into the fountain, water cascading over them, Harry landing on top, his knee between the Slytherin’s legs. They spluttered and splashed, and Potter instinctively grabbed the front of the other man’s shirt to pull him above the water, sitting back on his ankles.
Draco’s heart was racing, Harry’s body heat behind him only making things worse. They’d never done this before. Never spooned, never even slept in the same bed. He knew it was only because Harry was half asleep, and still probably half drunk, but still his heart was in his throat. Draco listened to his breathing, trying to focus on anything but the growing warmth in his loins. Soon, Harry’s breaths lulled him into a shallow sleep.
Harry sipped at his tea, trying his best to copy his memory of Malfoy’s perfect air of nonchalance. Face blank, apart from mild interest, posture relaxed but not bored. He'd decided against a pint, imaging the headlines: HARRY POTTER: HERO TURNED ALCOHOLIC.
That’s what she had said, and even now, Draco didn’t understand what she meant. Either way, they had become the most unlikely of friends. They still met frequently to hang out.
“I just..I didn’t think-” The darker man’s voice cracks, and he takes a deep breath. Draco feels strangely proud as he does this; proud that Harry isn’t going to run away like he had done before when his emotions were too much. “I didn’t think anyone could love me.” The words come out small, and the Gryffindor buries his face back in Draco’s chest.
"Narcissa Malfoy, I sentence you to exile. You are not to return to Great Britain without express permission of the Minister of Magic. You are also to pay a fine of 500,000 galleons to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to help pay for reparations."
“Come on.” Harry looped his arm through the blond’s and tugged him down the street. They walked in silence for a minute, the darker man completely oblivious to Draco’s frantic thoughts. “Do you wanna stay at mine?”
“Look, Potter. We don’t have to make this bigger than it needs to be. Let’s just agree to forget about it.”
“It is. One many can’t afford.” He winked, all too pleased at the darker man’s scowl. “Let me get my coat.”
Harry rubbed at his forehead as he spoke. “He said some bullshit about a truce. As if I’d ever think that he wasn’t a dick.” He snorted. “He almost sounded genuine, you know? Then I remembered that this is Malfoy and there’s not an honest bone in his body.”
“I wish I knew what you were thinking.” The blond whispered, and Harry dragged his eyes from his lips up to his eyes to find them watching him sadly.
"Draco?" Harry held him, horror painted across his features as Draco wheezed and sputtered, blood dripping from his lips. "Draco!" He looked around frantically. "Help! Someone help!" The waitress came out, before darting back inside with shouts in French.
Pansy was in stark contrast to the Ravenclaw, her shoulder length black hair hanging pin straight, her eyes framed with carefully perfected eyeliner. She wore a tight fitting black dress and heels. The two opposites stared at each other.
Draco pouts, opening the second drawer in the wardrobe and tossing him his favourite navy sweater. “Is not.”
Draco smiled to himself and apparated home. The mirror in his room revealed that he was just as disheveled as Potter, and it sent a happy shiver down his spine.
"Like what you see, Potter?" He smirks, trying his best to appear smug - though Merlin knows if he managed to look anything other than the bundle of nerves he really was..
Harry pulled open his bedroom door and Lucy jumped down from the bed with a soft meow. All the doors inside the house had charms on them to allow her to move freely about. “Kreacher.” Harry called as he walked down the hallway. The elf appeared in front of him, a grisly frown on his face. When his ‘ownership’ had officially passed onto Harry, he had gifted the house elf with one of his old tshirts; setting him free. Kreacher had confided that after spending all of his life working for the Blacks, he didn’t know much else, and wished to remain in the house. He had been more than happy to take up residence in the attic, and still offered to serve Harry. Harry hadn’t felt very comfortable with it, and had asked him more times than he could count to not call him master, but Kreacher had insisted. Still, Harry didn’t call on him often.
Harry shivers at his words, biting his lip. Draco groans at the sight and crushes their lips together. When they finally pull apart, breathless and hazy-eyed; Harry growls and pushes Draco away.
"Are we really doing this, Potter?" Draco tugged gently at his hair to pull him up so he could see his face.
Draco sat down, gripping the arms of the chair tightly. Moors frowned and clasped his hands on the desk in front of him.
None of that could happen right away of course, he still had to sort through artifacts, photos, abandoned belongings, furniture,  strip the carpets and wallpaper, scrub all the nooks and crannies, fix broken floor boards, repaint, retile - the whole bloody works. He preferred to do it the muggle way, it felt so much more rewarding. It should have been daunting, but as Harry sat on the floor of one of the spare rooms, old clothes covered in grime and dust, sipping a beer as Lucy wound her way around his legs, he only felt hopeful. It was a refreshing feeling, having so much time ahead of him, and so little to worry about.
Draco kicked off his shoes as he walked into his apartment, unbuttoning the top of his shirt. He allowed himself a moment of weakness; leaning against the wall to catch his breath and slow his heart after the four flights of stairs up to his apartment. They had never winded him before - but he supposed that’s what dying did to you. It was a warm, sunny, spring afternoon and he was eager to spend it reading on his balcony.
“Love. It seems to be a new favourite pet name of yours.” Harry flashes him a dazzling smile, though far too care-free to be serious.
Potter laughed then, a bitter sound, that sounded like he found it all absurd and made Draco’s insides twist. “Oh, please, Malfoy. We both know that I’m not perfect. We both know just how angry and stupid I can be. Don’t spit your lies at me.” He stood, his hands balled by his side.
Draco followed, his tall stance and cool looks hiding the knotted ball in his stomach. Was Harry Potter really about to buy him a drink? He wondered if Pansy could see him, pictured the shocked smirk on her face. She’d no doubt pester him for every single detail later, and there was no doubt he’d spill them all. If there was any of course; maybe Potter would just pass him his drink and leave.
What on earth was that about? He knew Malfoy made him feel a lot of things, but that? He’d never had butterflies like that, even with Ginny. It was beyond weird. It felt so...strange.
Dracl turned to his father and held out the package. "Father?" Lucius simply sniffed in response and turned back to his paper.
Draco watched as Potter licked his spoon clean, dropping it into the storage compartment of the pram before tossing the empty cup into the bin. He had thought the golden boy couldn't look better, but the way he smiled at Edward only cast an even brighter light over his features.
It's not everyday that one is invited for a cup of tea with Harry Potter; The Boy Who Lived (now the Young Man Who Lived Twice).
"Sorry I'm late!" Harry panted, running over to Luna. They had agreed to meet outside her and Ginny's flat before the party.
Hermione and Ron are expecting them at their apartment in just under fifteen minutes, and his boyfriend is still in the bathroom; no doubt trying to tame the mop on his head. That is another thing Draco secretly loves about him, how no one, not even the golden boy himself can tame the raw chaos that was Harry Potter.
Harry yawned widely, scratching his head as he plonked himself down at the staff table. Neville nudged the pumpkin juice towards him, shooting him a sympathetic look.
A lot of my feelings are unnecessary, some unscrupulous, some unwanted, unfounded, but most of them unreturned. For when have you ever looked into my eyes the way I do yours? When have you lain in the dark, retracing our encounters? Or remembering the colour of your eyes, or the pattern of your freckles, or the way you thin your lips in rage, or lick them with anxiety or when, perhaps, have you thought of me at all? Outside of your obligation to that is? Your obligation to hate me, despise me, distrust me. Please tell me that’s what it is; an obligation. Or at least tell me that you don’t anymore, don’t resent me, loathe me. That’s what I need to believe.
Draco had tucked the note under Potter's hand before laying a blanket over him and heading back up to his room. Potter had smiled at him that morning at breakfast, and Draco had nodded back, hurrying out of the Great Hall with butterflies in his stomach.
"Why did you leave it in the house, you daft bat?" Draco sighed dramatically as he stepped out into the sun, coming towards the giggling figure crouched over on the grass.
Draco, as always, was as quick as anything. By the time they broke apart, one long moment later, he had the situation at hand. When they pulled away, he planted a warm kiss on Harry’s cheek, taking his hand.
Malfoy’s jaw dropped. He hadn’t even said please! Potter was a cheeky bloody bastard… And yet; he found himself smiling, making his way to the door with a warm flutter in his chest. Were they really that comfortable around each other now? So comfortable that Harry could trust him to be left to his own devices? Well, it’s not like he was a child - though he did feel as giddy as one.
They walked side by side silently in the dying light of the evening. After several minutes, Harry finally spoke up.
Harry plonked himself down, ignoring her and turning to Neville. “What’s going on with you and Malfoy?”
McGonagall nodded goodbye and the two women swept out of the portrait. Draco sighed loudly and flung himself onto the sofa, rubbing his eyes.
"I wish I could have seen his face." Harry chuckled, his drink-addled brain applauding his quick thinking.
“Of course, master.” The elf disappeared with a pop as Harry trotted down the stairs, pausing to grab his shoes from the entrance way. The ground floor was pretty useless these days, the large dining room now used as a storage room for all the old furniture, as well as a cot that Harry had bought in case Teddy ever needed to stay. The entrance hall was once again grand and elegant (if you ignored all of Harry’s battered trainers scattered by the front door). The paintings had all been taken down, as had the elf heads, and the walls had been given a fresh lick of paint. Harry found the library welcoming, but didn’t spend much time in there, preferring the lounge - especially since it was so close to his room.
"Death eater? Don't give me that bollocks Malfoy," Potter huffed. "You know full well that I don't blame you for the war."
Draco looked back up, searching his face as he blinked back tears. “What have I done to deserve forgiveness?”
He was incredibly excited to see the results. Images of Harry’s proud face flashed through his mind, making his heart stop and stutter.
Harry pouted and walked towards him, shoving him into the wall. "Don't be mean, Malfoy." He pressed his chest against his.
“Nope. But just like when I said that to you, we have an argument to sort out.” Harry pulled off his scarf and crossed his arms.
Draco pushed the head of his cock in and they hissed in unison. He watched Potter's face as he slowly pushed himself further in and almost came right then when he saw his eyes roll back.
Harry looked over to see the witch trying not to intrude as she waited to be served. “Right, of course. Thanks again, Malfoy.” He nodded, trying to gain composure as he strode out of the shop.
Draco growled in frustration, wanting to punch something. Fuck this, he thought, following after Harry, stupid bastard.
“Morning, Harry. Didn’t expect to see you today.” Paeson’s voice was more feminine than her appearance.
“Oh mon Dieu (Oh my God).” He screeched, hands instinctively balling in the front of Harry’s trousers. He yanked him in front of him, using him as a shield from the bees.
“How’ve you been over the past few days, Harry? I bumped into Luna and she mentioned something about a possible solution for your nightmares?”
What the fuck? Draco was one of his best friends. He hadn’t thought they’d crossed a boundary last night, but his racing heart begged to differ. Harry had never thought of the Slytherin as anything but his friend, though he wasn’t blind to his attributes. Draco was gorgeous, and kind, and made Harry laugh. He even enjoyed their bickering. But why had he pulled him in to bed? Why had he had dreams about them making out? Draco was his friend.  Seeing him as something more? He’d never really thought about it.
She had been his rock all these years, always drying his tears and straightening his robes after Lucius had struck him. She always knew what he was thinking, and was the only person in the world who cared for him.
“Sure, I’ll be one sec. Head up to the lounge if you want.” Harry looked at him curiously before heading down the hallway.
Draco woke with a hangover that was nowhere near as bad as he expected. With a groan he lifted himself out of bed, stretching with a yawn as memories of the night before came back to him. Potter's green eyes, Potter's freckles, Potter's flirting.
“You want to know what’s going on, jolie garcon (pretty boy)?” Draco hissed, spinning around. “What’s going on is that I can’t do this. I can’t sit here, with you, playing make-believe, when I should be in fucking Azkaban for all my bad judgements and misdeeds and cowardice and betrayal! I can’t sit here knowing how fucking awful I am, and sit next to the most perfect, most handsome, most bloody brilliant wizard to ever exist!”
“Exactly, it’s your mother, Draco. I thought I at least meant enough to you for you to tell her about me, about us.”
“Make yourself comfortable, why don’t you?” Harry huffed, mulling over this information. For some reason it had never clicked in his brain, but of course Andy was Malfoy’s aunt.
“Then why did you call it Draco a few minutes ago?” The slytherin tilted his head. “I know you didn’t see me.”
He stepped closer, staring at Draco intently. "It really is, the moon… it makes it glow." He reached up to run his fingers through it. Draco's breath hitched and he closed his eyes to the touch. It felt so nice. Before he could open them again, he felt the warmth of Potter come closer, and then his lips pressed against his own.
He decided to leave his robes in favour of a much more muggle coat, a long dark one that went down to the floor. He was as ready as he'd ever be.
“I don’t want to hear your pathetic excuse, Malfoy.” Harry said his name like it tasted just as bitter as he felt.
Draco shuffled his feet and from his viewpoint Harry could see his knuckles whiten as he clasped his hands tightly. “I’m well. I’ve made some new friends, and Pansy keeps me on my toes as she always has.”
Rita squinted, pursing her lips tightly as she weighed her options. Finally, after a long moment, she put the quill down, pulling out a regular one. "Please continue." She said tightly.
"True. But that doesn't mean I don't care." Draco said, recalling the nights in eighth year when he had come down to the common room to find Potter curled up on the sofa. After the first few times, Draco had begun draping a blanket over him. He wonders if Potter knows that it was him.
“You don’t have to thank me, Harry.” Luna said with a gentle lilt to her voice as she squeezed his arm. The two stood bundled against the chill outside of Grottes aux Remèdes. “I’m sure I won’t be needed. Dear Draco can just get easily overwhelmed at the moment.”
"Nothing, Harry." Hermione turned to him a disconcerting smile. "Just that you seem to be spending a lot of time with Malfoy recently."
All these thoughts swirled in his head, and Draco had to steady himself against the wall. Maybe he was more hungover than he realized.
Harry woke with a start, letting out a small gasp. His arm was draped over Draco’s waist, his face nestled in his hair. Strangely, he felt almost content, warm and safe, surrounded by Draco’s scent.
"I'm afraid there's been a mistake, Mr Malfoy." He paused to look up at Draco, who swallowed thickly. "You were told that it looked as though you had two months." He cleared his throat and Draco thought that he might throttle him with all his dramatic pauses. "There was an error in the report. It was supposed to say two weeks."
Harry looked back at him, his best friend trapped under a large piece of rubble as tears streamed down his face. Hermione’s screams continued.
"I'll tell you once I've got some of that in me." Draco nodded at the waitress as she dropped off the drinks. He passed two shots to Pansy and took two for himself.
Draco sighed heavily, barely resisting the urge to roll his eyes. “Quand me laisserais-tu tranquille (When will you leave me alone)?” It had barely been forty-eight hours since he’d argued with Potter, and yet here he was; standing in his shop with a nervous smile. The morning had been slow and tedious - there was only so many times he could tidy the same untouched shelves.
Harry took off at a sprint across the field, not stopping until he ran out of breath outside the Great Hall.
“I need to head out, babe.” Ginny kissed her on the cheek and pulled out of her grasp. “Let me know how it goes, Harry.” She squeezed his arm.
“I trust your judgement mate, most of the time at least.” Ron said, taking a swig from his own pint. “If you say he’s changed, I’m sure he has. But he owes Hermione an apology before he can be let into the group.”
The two had never spoken much, despite working together. Amicable acquaintances was probably the most appropriate term for their relationship. Of course, that didn’t mean that a highly-inappropriate workplace crush hadn’t developed. Harry was, as always, oblivious to Malfoy’s returned feelings. He didn’t dare at that moment to think about how nice Malfoy felt against him, or the way his heart raced. Would he help him?
"That's all. Merci, Potter." Draco tried his best at a genuine smile, but it came out awkward. It was hard when he was most practiced at polite indifference or a mocking smirk.
“Thank you.” He said, wiping his shoes and going through to the kitchen. It was impeccably tidy, as always. He looked around for his coat, finding it hanging on the back of the utility room door.
“I really don’t mean to be rude, but Draco’s been promising me a dance and Merlin knows he’ll wiggle his way out of it if he can.” Harry chuckled, giving the Slytherin a playful smack on the arm.
It still amazed him how this shop could feel so much at home, perhaps even more so than his own apartment. La chambre cozy was where he could relax, his own private space, unseen by anyone except himself. It had a small kitchen in the back corner, and he had filled the rest of the space with a fraying green velvet loveseat, stained oak wood coffee table, one of Sylvia’s many beds and scratching posts, and a rather large pile of cushions and blankets. All of them had been an impulse buy from a muggle charity shop that Luna had dragged him into in search of ‘something filled with love’. He had been browsing wizard magazines for weeks in search of furniture, and could never find anything that felt right.
A loud scream echoed out, penetrating the howls of the wind, the agony in Hermione’s voice permeating the air with urgency. He looked towards the sound, searching the clouds of dust desperately.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry. It’s a force of habit. I should know better.” The raven-haired witch looked out of the window.  “I really don’t hate them anymore.” She paused. “I’ve been taught better, by some wonderful witches and wizards.” She turned to Luna and winked.
At the sound of her name, the young snowy cat ceased her licking and trotted up to him, her soft purring joining the sound of Harry’s ragged breathing. She butted her head against his hand and he let himself relax against his pillows as she crawled onto his chest, her purring becoming louder by the second. Merlin, he was glad to have her. The nightmares, although less frequent these days, had cursed Harry with a new intensity since the battle. He had somehow managed to trudge through eighth year, but the terrors still persisted more nights than not. Images of mangled corpses, blood stained uniforms and splintered wands flashed across his mind, and he couldn’t stop the shiver that wrenched its way up his spine.
Pansy leant on the stone archway to the water garden, sipping her champagne, Luna next to her, both watching with smiles on their faces.
Harry picked Teddy up under the arms, holding him in front of him like a shield. “He’s bloody blond!” But as he said this, he watched with wide eyes as his hair turned raven black. “What in Merlin’s tits!”
Water half-dripped, half-poured from their bodies, their chests pressed together, Harry’s fists still balled in Draco’s shirt.
Draco's eyes fell closed, and his hand slid down Harry's face to land on his chest. Harry howled, a guttural, painful sound, as he held Draco's lifeless body. Their story was over, a book that had ended. It would be revisited often, the pages worn at the edges as Harry went back to remember it. One day, the book would be put on a shelf, never to be read again, and when someone asked him about it, Harry would smile sadly and think about what could have been.
Harry followed him over, ignoring the looks from the other guests. Just through the archway was a beautiful garden, filled with flowers, lined with willow trees. A stone path wound its way through the long grass, and just at the edge of what could be seen was a large, ornate water fountain with cherubs carved into it. “Wow.” He breathed, the first time he had ever been so breath taken by nature.
Draco sat at his breakfast counter, a thoroughly chewed quill between his lips and a steaming mug of tea beside him. He stared at the parchment in front of him, his stomach twisting.
The afternoon had passed quickly, and the gryffindor couldn't help the smile that crept across his features as he remembered the looks he and Malfoy had shared. It was like they'd been friends forever, and was almost bittersweet when Harry thought about the time they had wasted hating each other. But things weren't that simple, were they? It wasn't just some school boy rivalry. There was a war, lives at stake, and what was done couldn't be changed.
Pansy’s voice rang in his ears. "T'es foutu (you're screwed)." Yes, he most certainly was. Draco carried Teddy as Harry pushed the empty pushchair, and in a few short minutes they were back in the warmth. He put the toddler down and took off his coat, hanging it up. “I must admit that I feel bad, constantly barging into your home.”
Pansy held her hand up with a snort. "You don't even know the half of it. I was upset, but then I thought about it and I realised I would be happy to try a polyamorous relationship - except…" she paused for emotional effect.
“I mean yeah, but he doesn’t really believe it. That you can just have other people in your own home with just the press of a button.” Harry said nothing, just sitting with a raised eyebrow. Ron shoved him. “I know they're not really here, you tosser.”
“Yes, I will.” Potter stepped forwards, looking rather like someone about to do something stupid. So Draco stepped back. He stepped away from the man he wanted and back into his fear.
Harry stood up, chasing after him and wrestling him to the ground as Sirius screamed in delight. "He's down! Come and get him!"
“Can you please not have an entire foreign conversation in front of me? I feel very left out.” Malfoy raised his eyebrow, crossing his arms.
“I think you mean intoxicating.” Draco chuckles and Harry narrowes his eyes. “You’re so cute when you do that.”
Pansy covered her shock with a smirk, shaking her head. She was always so shocked by the other woman’s blunt honesty. “That doesn’t mean I don’t like you.” She sat down.
Draco Malfoy stood before her, a polite smile etched on his face. Now a young man, he held himself well, with a palpable aura of sophistication. The apothecary knew otherwise of course, having handmade his anxiety medication for the past few months.
Mr Potter had called me in urgency, requesting not only my reporting skills, but my companionship. Having been in acquaintance with Mr Potter for nearly five years, it is safe to say that our relationship is one that is tight-knit and very personal.
He sat down on the sofa, folding his cloak over his lap. Not a moment later, Potter appeared, out of breath and a little bit frazzled. “You didn’t have to run, you silly git.” He took the glass that he offered. “Thanks.” Just the sight of the other man seemed to calm him down a bit.
"I was supposed to show you that I could be sophisticated, like you, in a place like this." He gestures around him, looking more vulnerable by the second. Draco had guessed as much, but it still did funny things to his stomach to hear Potter say he was trying to impress him.
“Mother insisted.” The man rolled his eyes playfully, before his face grew more serious. “I was wanting to talk to you.”
“This is about Harry and Draco, isn’t it?” Hermione sighed. “Ron and I had agreed not to get involved, to let Harry figure it out himself.”
The blond stood too, stuffing his hands in his pockets as he watched the lion’s movements. “I suppose it seems that way, to you.” He took a deep breath, as if readying himself. “The truth is, I’ve been feeling this way for a long time.”
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, resting his head under his chin. “I’m sorry for getting mad.”
"I don't suffer from them anymore. That's what I'm here to talk about." Harry swigged the last of his tea. "I took a new potion. It's got rid of my nightmares, and I'm extremely grateful for it."
Draco grabbed Potter's chin and made him look at him. "The past is the past, Potter. Focus on where we are right now."
“How are you sleeping at the moment?” Andromeda’s voice pulled Harry’s gaze away from where he had been playing with Teddy. He was sat on her living room floor, surrounded with toys as he watched his god-son with adoration. He hadn’t spent as much time with him as he wanted in his eighth year, but he’d been quick to remedy that. Now he never went more than a few days without seeing them. Andy was a fantastic guardian to Teddy, and Harry found himself looking at her like a second mum, or maybe like a wise wine aunt.
Draco pushed his chair back with a screech, his gaze steely. "This was a mistake, Potter. I appreciate you asking me to lunch, but I'm afraid I must get back to the shop." He stood, grabbing his coat from the back of his chair.
“Not this one, it’s only been developed in the past couple of months. It uses the good bit of your subconscious to fight the anxious part. I think you should try it.” Luna paused, smiling at Harry in a way that made him think she knew he would try it, if only for her. “Go to Grotte aux Remèdes at the far end of Diagon Alley and say I sent you.”
Tears fell down his cheeks. He had no future. He should owl Potter and tell him that he couldn't see him. Didn't want to see him. All it would do is cause more suffering in the long term.
Draco had been slacking with his visits recently, only fire calling his mother over Easter, and last seeing her back at Christmas.
“I don’t know. But you certainly make a change from these other posh gits - I can at least remember your name.”
“Headmistress McGonagall has been kind enough to show me how the reparations are doing, and I asked to look at the new living quarters - as your letters have been so brief recently.” Narcissa’s tone was formal, but held a tinge of disappointment that had Draco bowing his head.
Pansy shrugged. “I had a pint of water and a sandwich after you passed out. Woke up feeling perfectly fine.”
Andy came running in, bottle of milk still in hand, eyes wide. “What’s happened? Is everything okay?”
He flooed to Andromeda’s doorstep, hoping Teddy could cheer him up a bit. He didn’t want the questions that would come from Ron and Hermione, and Andy was very good at keeping to herself. He rang the doorbell, and after several strangely long minutes, the middle Black sister opened the door.
“I do hope that’s my cousin and not your secret illegitimate child, Potter.” The drawling aristocratic tone of Draco Malfoy called behind the bench. He had dropped off the potion the week before, but Harry hadn’t seen him since.
After taking a minute to cool down, trying to remind himself of all the reasons that punching a brick wall would be bad, Harry returned to the coffee shop and waited to collect the food to go. Malfoy had always had a talent for riling him up, and a flare for the dramatic. And yet; Harry still always found himself drawn to him in this uncontrollable way. Bloody posh git, he thought.
"Now, you spend your remaining time however you wish." The healer smiled sadly at him. "We estimate two months, Mr Malfoy."
Draco looked up from where he had been studying the coffee stains on the table to find Harry watching him intensely, something flashing in his eyes that he couldn’t work out. "You haven't really given me the chance." The blond rebutted, frowning into his coffee. Since when had Potter ever shown any interest in their reconnection?
Draco didn’t know whether to laugh or scowl. Who was the dramatic one now? “Don’t interrupt me. I was just trying to-”
“Mmm, but soon you’re gonna be more coffee and wideye potion than you are man.” She raised her eyebrows at him as she licked her lips.
Harry watched helplessly as his best friend stepped towards him. “If you had died, none of this would have happened!” The darker boy tried to speak, but his voice caught in his throat. All he could do was watch as Ron strode towards him, shouting, Hermione’s screams still violently ravaging the air. He had to go, he had to leave, to run, to be the coward he knew he was.
Potter suddenly pushed him away, the two of them panting. Draco was sure his cheeks were pink. "For fucks sake, Malfoy," Potter practically snarled, grabbing his arm and pulling him between the houses and pushing him up against the wall.
"Shut your mouth. You know nothing about me." Malfoy seethed, his pale skin was tinged red with anger, and the look he was giving Harry probably should have killed him on the spot.
"Cheers, Malfoy. So do you, although you always look smart." he blushed as he said it. That just won't do, Draco decides. He looked far too adorable.
“Let them.” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “At least my face would brighten the absolute drivel that they’re putting out these days.” He drawled.
Harry still had him pressed against the wall, the close proximity only adding to the fire he held inside. “What the fuck are you doing with Neville?”
“Yes, you are. You’re cute, and brave, and awfully stubborn. You have a ridiculously good arse, and horrific fashion sense.” Draco doesn’t know where the words are coming from, but he can’t stop them. Not when he’s never been so happy. “You snore like you’re trying to wake up the entire street, and you have an obsession with mixing foods that shouldn’t go together. You are more than people realise, Harry James Potter, and I love you for it.”
Draco snorted. "You're gonna act innocent? You-" he jabbed his finger into Harry’s chest, "-were just as guilty as me."
“I insist.” Potter looked over his shoulder. “The bar’s just there, right?” He said, taking off with a wave of his hand.
"How would I have known that you would even talk to me?" Draco avoided his eyes. Understandably, whenever he had even considered the idea of talking to the Gryffindor, he had been dissuaded by images of black eyes and broken noses.
“Don’t even get me started. I’ve been assigned to this prick, Peters. He smells like stale sweat and cheesy feet.”
"How have I been keeping?" Potter snorted, dropping three sugar cubes into his drink. "This is probably the longest conversation we've had since the trials." Draco thought back to the months following the battle, how Potter had spoken at his and his mother’s trials. He didn’t know what was more mortifying, the dubious looks on the wizengamot’s faces or when he thanked Harry afterwards.
“See you later, Luce.” He gave her a singular stroke as she gobbled her food. Grabbing his flask and the paper bag, he closed his eyes and, with the familiar jerk of apparating, he opened them to the still dark sky, the wind nipping at his cheeks.
“Alright. I can do that.” He agreed, offering his hand to Malfoy. The blond regarded it silently, his pointy features perfectly blank, before stretching out his own pale hand. Why did he have such nice hands?
“Draco, what’s going on?” Potter’s voice held concern, but Draco ignored it, rubbing at his head as his heart raced. “Draco?”
Maybe he was wrong, maybe it wasn’t Malfoy. Sixth year had certainly proven that he wasn’t the best at handwriting. But it added up, the ‘limelight’ , the ‘cowardice’, the ‘family’. And who else had been close enough to him to comment on his freckles, or lips, or eyes, and still matched the things that had been said like Malfoy did?
“True.” Pansy conceded. “But you took me to the Yule Ball. And you kissed Daphne, don’t you remember?”
“Wait, really?” Hermione exclaimed, before looking thoughtful. “I mean it makes sense, he was always top of the class in Potions in school.” She traced her finger around the rim of her glass as she spoke.
"You don't even have my address!" Draco called, but he was already out of earshot. He couldn't help the smile that creeped over his face. He was going on a date. With Harry Potter. Merlin’s tits.
He rolled them over, pinning Draco's hands above his head. Draco could just about hear a small voice over the sound of his heartbeat saying that it was good they'd walked so far along the river - there was only one other person around and he was dozing on a blanket 30 feet away.
“Well who’s genius idea was it to use Rita Skeeter?!” Draco snapped, leaning forwards into Potter’s unspoken challenge. As always, he met Harry straight-on, not stepping down, letting his anger control the situation.
“Alright, alright. Potter, I’m sorry I was an arse. I’ll help out, okay? That’s what I came here to say.” Draco looked down at his hands, unable to look at Harry any longer.
If Draco was lucky enough, he’d wake up before Pansy tomorrow, and could burn the blasted thing before she could bully him about it.
“He’s in love!” Seamus declared, slapping Harry on the back. Hermione shot him a pointed look. The Irish man ignored it.
“How in Merlin’s name did you come to that conclusion? I did nothing but sing your praises!” Harry ran his hands through his hair, his barely-contained emotions starting to spill out. “I even told her about the bloody manor and the stinging hex!”
“Calling you what?” Draco asks distractedly, trying desperately not to stare as his boyfriend pulls on his jeans, all thoughts leaving his head except whether or not they have time for him to give Harry’s cock a quick worship.
“Draco, you have to let me sign this paper.” Harry chuckled. “Move.” He whispered the last word in parseltongue, and the white corn snake reluctantly shifted out of the way so that he could give his signature. Harry had named the snake as such because of it’s naughty nature, much like it’s human counterpart in eighth year. By the time they had reached the end of the year, the slytherin seemed like a completely different person.
"I am aware of that, sir." Draco tried hard not to grind his teeth. How this buffoon was his superior he had no idea.
“Lucy?” Draco repeated, and at the sound of her name, Lucy jumped down from Harry’s chest. He peeked over as she trotted up to Draco, sniffing him intently. “When did you get her?”
“Never thought I’d say it, mate.” Both men fell onto the sofa, Pig taking off to look out the window. Lucy watched with interest from her scratching tower.
"Malfoy!" Potter waved as he crossed the street. He was wearing a black button up shirt, untucked over some tight black trousers. Draco wondered what his arse looked like. He looked smart, sexy. He hadn't managed to tame his curls, but Draco actually prefers it. He wondered if he'd ever admit it.
Fucking shit, Draco thought, as he raced through to his bathroom to brush his teeth. He popped some pain medication for his pounding head before pulling on some clothes.
“Get out of my flat!” Draco ordered, pointing to the fireplace as his cheeks burned red. Bloody Blaise and his love for gossip.
"If I remember correctly, Malfoy, you volunteered to be interviewed by her during fourth year, and were more than eager to spread lies about me! At least I didn’t lie!”
“Thanks, guys.” Harry said, suddenly having to blink back tears. It was such a relief to feel this kind of optimism again, after having resigned himself to having nightmares indefinitely. “Anyways, Ron, How’s training going?”
“Fucking hell.” Harry stuttered, his mind reeling. So this WAS a date! And not only that, Malfoy wanted to go on another one? Wait. Harry rewound the conversation in his head. Did Malfoy just say they should get a room?!
Harry Potter with dark hollows under his eyes, standing to speak for Draco at his trial. The awkward thank you, Potter, afterwards, as the two boys took it in turns to briefly glance at each other before looking away.
“Because Pansy gets off on scheming.” Draco snorted. The two men walked slowly towards the water feature in comfortable silence, taking in the garden. They reached into the water at the same time to trail their fingers in it.
Harry watched as he walked around to see the two of them. “And who would be the mother?” His gaze couldn't help but linger on the way the blond’s cheeks were bitten with pink.
She marched ahead along the cobbles, hips swaying and wedges gently clapping on the ground. Luna and Harry followed, around this corner and that, until the chatter became louder and louder, and the hedges parted in an arch to reveal a sprawling lawn filled with guests; most of whom were questionable purebloods, waiters and a large gazebo with tables, chairs and a buffet table. One of the waiters came up to them, tray filled with champagne flutes, and offered it. Harry took one, looking around.
“No!” Harry pulled at one of the perfect inky ringlets. “I just assumed someone in the family had black hair. That maybe he got it from your side.” Harry ran his hands through the soft curls on Teddy’s head.
He had already almost knocked the bottle off the table at the start of the meal (thank god for them both having a seeker's reflexes) and had to ask Draco about half of the dishes on the menu.When the food had arrived and Draco had seen Potter's face go funny, he had asked the waitress to bring an extra portion of chips. It seemed he was right, as by the time they had arrived Potter had eaten everything on his carefully put together plate. Draco had insisted they share and then sadly exclaimed how he had overestimated his appetite and insisted that Potter eat the rest for him.
He soon spotted Narcissa Malfoy, chatting with a group of other over-dressed women. Harry looked down at his button up and jeans, frowning. He felt very underdressed. Thankfully, there were no reporters that he could see. What was he doing here? He turned around to ask, but Luna and Pansy had struck up a conversation, walking away, leaving him feeling completely lost. What on earth was he here for?
And so, when Harry woke up exactly three weeks after first visiting Malfoy’s shop, he decided that he was going to visit again. After his morning shift, he apparated to Diagon Alley, pulling his scarf up over his face. He stood outside the shop, trying to peak discreetly through the window in the door. Malfoy stood inside, glasses on as he pointed at different potions behind the counter. The middle aged woman in front of him nodded, pointing at the same bottle that Malfoy was. Harry pushed open the door, letting the wind chimes signal his entrance.
“I can’t stand it!” Ron growled, standing up from where he had been crouching, his hands over his ears. His eyes locked with Harry’s, and pure rage distorted his features. “This is your fault!” He bellowed, his hands dropping to ball into fists at his side. He stepped towards Harry. “Listen to her! You should have died, Harry!”
“Oh do shut up for once, Malfoy.” Harry almost spat. “You can’t tell me you thought I’d trust you? What in Merlin’s name gave you the idea that I’d just shake your hand and be done with it?”
"Those bastards!" Draco stood up in anger. "Tell me who they are Pansy, and I'll make them regret ever hurting you."
Harry turned just in time to see him disappear with a crack, leaving him to growl at the empty space where he had been, cursing loudly.
A sudden darkness washed over him, an intense weight in his stomach. What was he thinking? He was going to die. There would be no future for him. No anniversaries, no Christmases. No moving in together, no family. No arguments and make-ups. No growing old.
"And dim." He laughed and ducked out of the way of another smack. Malfoy couldn't help but laugh too. They continued walking.
He shushed her, stroking her hair. Pansy had been a lot more tearful since the war, but that was usually after a glass of wine while she gushed about how much she loved everyone. Draco walked her to the sofa and sat her down.
"I could say the same about you." He flipped them over. He didn't know what was better, Potter leaning over him or Potter underneath him. They crashed their lips together again, a delicious battle of dominance ensuing.
Draco flicked his gaze back up at him. “Yes.” He took a breath and rolled his eyes. “I’m not a monster. If there’s a way to help out, I will.”
Both young men turned back to their food, Harry reaching for the pot of coffee he’d asked for. The noise in the hall rose, and he looked up just in time to catch the post before it hit his plate. Being a Hogwarts alumni and a seeker definitely helped during breakfast.
He hadn’t moved, but he was flustered, and half-hard, and more than a little bit confused. He needed to calm down, cool down. He needed a cold shower. But how could he move? He didn’t want to wake Draco, deal with his questions. He could barely remember pulling him into bed, yet alone why he did it. Oh that’s right, he was too busy dreaming about kissing him. Fuck! What was he gonna do?
Potter huffed, crossing his arms. He couldn’t look Malfoy in the eye, couldn’t hide how he felt to be forgotten, no, hidden, purposely missed out of his boyfriend’s life.
Malfoy smirked, watching Harry carefully. They held each other’s gaze, each other’s stomach filled with butterflies.
She could still remember the day they died, the way tears had brimmed in her family housekeeper's eyes as she asked her to sit down. At 12 years old she had known what that look meant; her parents would not return home ever again. She swallowed thickly.
“Wait!” Harry called out to Luna, his anger quickly fading. She was right after all, he couldn’t deny it. He went around the counter, grabbing Malfoy’s arm before he could step away in confusion. He leant in close, not noticing the way the blond’s breath caught, and wiped away the soot on his cheek with his thumb. Thank Merlin, Draco’s cheeks were already a bit flushed, otherwise his blush would have only mortified him further. Harry stepped away with a nervous smile, dropping his arm. “Sorry, you had something on your face.” He paused, watching the other man closely. “Look, I’m sorry, alright? I was wrong to go to Skeeter, but I tried so hard to tell her the truth, of how you’ve changed.” He snorted. “Or at least, how you’ve changed, most of the time.” He took a deep breath. “Are we okay?”
Malfoy followed behind, his eyes adjusting to the lower light, breathing in the smell of straw. It had been years since he’d been here. The person behind the counter frowned at the two, though that could’ve just been their face.
Luna walked forward and grabbed Harry’s hand. “You should at least try it.” She gave it a firm squeeze before dropping it.
Well, he wasn't wrong. Draco was wearing long denim shorts, canvas shoes, and a white short sleeved button up with his shades tucked into the top. He felt weirdly free without his suits and robes, but he would never admit it.
“I want to.” The darker man shrugged, as if his words hadn’t just sent a jolt of lightning through the blond’s body. He wanted to?
“...and then we spent the next thirty minutes chatting! Like friends! It was weird as fuck, guys. But we get along really well.” Harry said, his voice slightly slurred as he waved his half empty beer glass around. He was sat in the pub his friends frequented, two and a half pints into his rant about Malfoy.
And this is not healthy, it can’t be. Progress is healthy, moving on is healthy. And perhaps just imagining you reading this will contribute towards that.
Potter let out a startled shriek and spun around, clutching his chest. Draco had never laughed so hard. "The saviour of the wizarding world folks, acclaimed war veteran," he said between gasps.
Draco pulled out a paper package and unwrapped it to reveal a half eaten cake. He cut two slices and passed one over. "It's French, my mother sent it over."
The shop was lined with shelves holding jars and drawers, bottles and plants, cauldrons and books. Candles floated just above head level much like in the Great Hall at Hogwarts, and a curtained off area in the far corner held a sign that read “consultation room”. It felt welcoming, surprisingly so for a shop. The whole place was empty, except for a cat lounging on the counter to Harry’s right, next to the till.
Goodbye, Draco Malfoy, she thought, I'll read about your death in the Prophet within the month, and then I will truly be happy.
“My thoughts exactly.” Draco smiled, and they looked at each other for a moment, before bursting out laughing.
Harry had been hoping for Hermione, or maybe Ron, but as his gaze settled on Ginny sitting next to the common room fireplace, he realised that maybe she could help too. The younger Gryffindor glanced up from her copy of Quidditch Weekly, looking Harry up and down.
