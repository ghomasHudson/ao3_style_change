Ron rolled his eyes, yet they widened as a message popped up on his screen. ‘
“Oi!” Michael yelled. “Leave ‘im alone, Malfoy!”
Harry nodded at the phone, then typed back. ‘
Ron turned back to the game, muttering under his breath. “Harry could’ve easily beaten you.”
there was something. Harry couldn’t shake the thought of the blood from his head. Or how he stayed almost completely to himself. How he was late to class and didn’t sleep. Of course, people struggle with PTSD differently. Harry’s struggles were different then say Hermione’s, or Neville’s. He had no idea what really happened to Draco over the last few years, and what the turmoil could have triggered… but he was determined to find out. Blaise was worried about him, and he had known him longer. Something was wrong.
Harry grinned. “Good. Really fantastic! I think we’ll do really well this year actually, I’m excited. It will be nice to play again, proper.”
“Chandelier?” he whispered. “Yeah. I’m surprised you remember that.”
” The snake vanished and Draco panted, closing his eyes. Harry could hear him counting to ten in the chaos of the room. Finally, he opened his eyes and returned his wand to duelling stance.
Harry shrugged, before reaching out and taking something else from the platter as Draco returned to his book. Or, seemed to, at least.
He wondered what it would have been like if they could have joked around when they were younger. If they had have talked like they do now, when they were eleven. If Draco had known then what he knew now about his family’s biases and perspective on the Weasleys and muggle-borns. Would they have been friends? Would they be close now? Would Harry have been able to help him in sixth year, to stay away from the dark-side? Persuade him to accept protection by the Order. Would Draco have confided in him that summer, when he was forced to take the mark? Would Harry have denied the hat putting him in Slytherin? Would they have been roomates? Would he have still stayed friends with Ron? Would he have become friends with Hermione? Everything would have been so different…
“How do you think Maya is doing?” Harry asked, chewing a piece of whatever he’d been cutting.
He thought about that for a moment, handing her another handful of ingredients. “Happy. I knew something was wrong and pursued it, and now he’s opening up to me. I can support him more, now that I know what’s going on.”
“Morning, Harry,” called Neville, struggling to tuck his shirt into his trousers.
“Harry!” The hiss of a boy’s voice caught his attention over the noise of the students shuffling out of their seats along the long classroom. He turned to see Blaise staring at him.
Malfoy looked up. “What? You think things have changed?”
Draco smiled slightly. “I was lucky it didn’t get me in the eyes.”
Malfoy still didn’t respond. He shoved a chocolate in his mouth to shut them up, and soon more mewing filled the room.
to be the same.”
Clearly, the other three tables noticed this hesitation, because soon all three tables were clapping and cheering. The staff joined in, followed, half-heartedly, by the Slytherin students.
McGonagall steered them through the doorway into a tower, then up the winding staircase. Paintings stared at the throng of students, and with a pang, it struck Harry that he knew their faces. The walls were lined with portraits of past students, of aurors lost in the war, members of the order… Harry’s eyes watered as he came to the grinning face of Fred Weasley. Harry, Ron, and Hermione all stopped. Ron touched the painting gently, letting his finger fall from the top of the frame to the bottom. The rest of the group halted as well, and McGonagall smiled sadly back at them.
Malfoy rolled his eyes at the paper. ‘You never stop, do you?’
A moment later, as Harry flipped through a textbook, a reply popped up on his screen. ‘Reading.’
“I couldn’t leave you there.”
“I thought they were friends?” Hermione voiced, speaking what everyone had been thinking the previous night.
“Well,” Ron smiled over at him. “I guess you were both pretty wrong about each other.”
“Of course.”
Harry caught sight on Luna being sent backwards and knocked on her ass by Ginny, who first looked proud and then concerned when it took Luna a second to stand again. Harry pursed his lips, turning back to Ron, and missed dodging a hex a second to late. HE was hit with flipendo, and smacked into the back wall with a hard thud. He fell to the floor, staring up at Ron, who’d stepped towards him, an arm outstretched. Harry took it and Ron pulled him up. “Sorry, mate. You alright?”
“I-I tried to save you. Both of you.”
Harry smiled in spite of himself. ‘
Ron had lines etched on his forehead when Harry turned back to him. “What was that about?”
Draco smirked. “Yeah, well that’s one thing Granger and I
As Harry stood to leave with Ron, Malfoy emerged from his curtains. The boys all froze, staring at him silently. Malfoy glared at them, icy eyes penetrating them. “WHAT,” he bellowed. “Can I not just brush my bloody teeth? Can’t I do
’ He set his phone back down, lifting a forkful of food to his mouth.
A moment later a new voice startled Harry’s attention away from his phone once again. Pansy was standing next to Hermione, a plate of food and a cup of steaming tea in her hands. “Can I sit here?”
“I know.”
Harry’s mouth had gone dry. “Thanks for telling me, Luna. That, uh… that’s important to know.”
“Fucking Death Eater! Who let
“What do you guys talk about?”
“For fucks sake, guys,” Harry interjected, pushing past them. “We can’t just leave him in that pain. Merlin, let me do it.” He pulled the boy’s curtains open, stepped inside, and then pulled them shut again. Malfoy lay curled up in his bed, writhing in pain and throwing his head back and forth. Another scream started and Harry sat on the edge of his bed. He grasped the boy’s arm, but Malfoy yanked out of Harry’s grip. “Malfoy, wake up!” He tried again, but the other boy seemed more frantic this time as he ripped away from Harry. “Malfoy, wake up! It’s not real. Wake up. Wake up!” Malfoy screamed again. He had to hold the other boy’s arms down to get him to stop thrashing so he could speak to him. “It’s not real, Draco. Wake up. It’s not real, I promise. He’s not here, Draco. Wake up. Wake up!”
“Harry had to tell them all off after Malfoy left. Blaise, too.”
“Draco—”
Draco could practically
Harry layed down his cards. “And I had jack-squat.” They both laughed at him as Justin rounded up the cards and began to shuffle them.
“Sure, but why not like a Golden Retriever or a lab or something?”
Harry glanced across the hall at Malfoy, then back at Ron. “Maybe.” Out of the reach of Ron’s prying eyes, Harry typed another reply.
Harry stared at her. “What? Are you serious? I testified on her and Draco’s behalf!”
“No,” said Harry, frowning. “Is it falling asleep or staying asleep that’s the problem? Or nightmares, maybe?”
Harry took a deep breath, then read through the message again. Playing dumb, he typed back: ‘
Draco is awake while Ron comforts Harry after a nightmare. The next morning, Harry teaches some friends to play 31, and later, has a text conversation with Draco about the previous night.
He raised his brows. “Ron texted you?”
Malfoy dropped his gaze. “Think whatever the hell you want.”
Harry rolling his eyes. “Yeah, whatever. Like you wouldn’t do the same if Hermione was watching.”
Pansy blushed, looking at the table. “They usually do. I used to, too. But I came across an order form once in a magazine for muggle products like you use Hermione, and I just found them fascinating. I managed to get the conversion right I guess and order some. Now I get some for Christmas and my birthday… I don’t really know how my family manages to get them, but I’m grateful.”
The doors of the Great Hall swung open revealing the familiar face of the students’ Herbology professor, who led a group of about thirty students into the hall. The upper-year students all cheered, shouting their welcomes to the shy eleven-year-olds walking past. Their eyes moved sky-wards to the enchanted ceilings, roamed over the long tables and the smiling faces of students. Some smiled, some bit their lips… others looked downright terrified.
“You bet,” Harry grinned. “Think we’ll get many new players?”
A slight smile appeared on Malfoy’s face. Harry watched as he typed, and his phone vibrated in his hand. ‘Hey.’
The three grinned at him and Justin started dealing. “Absolutely.”
Draco’s tired eyes were focused on his own. “Thank you.”
Ron rolled his eyes, digressing. “Fine.”
Harry turned back his way and caught a horrified look on Draco’s face. Harry raised his brows and the other boy turned away, yelling “
Malfoy, Harry noticed, never came to breakfast that morning—but he did beat them to potions. He was the first one there, already copying the instructions from the board. Harry and Hermione slid into their seats, with Ron in front of them, speaking lowly until the class began to fill with other students. They chatted through most of the class, gossiping and laughing as they brewed that day’s potion. Blaise sat across the aisle with Malfoy, but despite the darker skinned boy’s efforts, the blond never spoke to him.
“But he won’t know it’s you,” Ron protested.
“Do you really need to cause any more harm than you already have?”
“Snake.”
Ron pulled him into his arms. “It’s okay, mate. It wasn’t your fault.”
without being accused of plotting some evil scheme? For Merlin’s sake!”
“No. His Aunt and Uncle despise people like us. They treated him real bad, and they hid it from him. Even tried to hide his Hogwarts letter.”
Harry nodded. “So then what do you want to know?”
After a few more minutes Draco heard their plates landing on the table. Someone muttered a spell and the plates and platters vanished. He could feel Harry stretch beside him before leaning back into the couch. Either Ron or Dean yawned. Then Ron’s voice piped up. “Harry, what was that game called that we played the other day?”
agree on. But don’t get any ideas about trying to impress
“Oh, he’s fine. Just a tad startled.”
“Oh.”
“What?”
we didn’t tie. Sometimes we’d be tied the whole year and come out with slightly different final grades. He’s brilliant. It’s one of the things that made him so infuriating.”
Harry frowned, twiddling a pen between his thumb and index finger on his left hand as he thought of what to say. ‘
“I know. Damn Weasley always finds a way to beat ya.”
‘Nope.’
Blaise raised his eyebrows, standing now, too. “You heard him… you heard Voldemort torture him?”
Sorry, gotta go to class now. Talk to you later.’
Harry glanced at Dean, who was openly laughing at Ron, but he himself had a gleam of curiosity in his eye. “Oh, I was just wondering if you wanted something to eat?”
“Don’t be. I know you only ask because you care about me.”
Harry squinted over at them, then rolled his eyes. “Fine. We’ll bring them in to practice their positioning on defence. Happy?”
A scrawny boy with mousy hair clambered onto the stool. He stared into the crowd for a second, then closed his dark eyes tightly. The hat paused, muttering to the boy, who shrugged. “Gryffindor!”
Draco turned back to Blaise. “I’m gunna go back to bed now. G’night lads.”
“Secondly, I would like to introduce our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Spunks! He has gladly accepted the position and is excited to teach you all this year. Treat him well.
Hermione nodded. “That’s good.”
He pointed to Draco, and it took Harry a moment to realize what was going on. The blond was staring at the flames at the other end of the room, paralyzed in fear. His eyes were glassy, but there was no mistaking the look on his face. It was the exact same one Harry had seen during the Battle of Hogwarts in the Room of Requirement. Blaise looked at Harry, desperately. “The flames are going to get over here eventually. Help me.”
‘And no… I deserve it anyways.’
More scraping chair legs pulled Harry’s attention away from Luna. Blaise had pulled up a chair beside him and was sitting with his stomach against the back. Harry bit his lip. “Is he okay?”
‘Fine. I won’t tell you either.’
Harry shrugged. “Honestly, Ron, I have no idea. It wasn’t something I expected from myself either… I just… I can’t stand to see anyone in pain, you know that. And especially after the war, and after how he was living and used by Voldemort, and Crabbe dying and I just
“I…” He stood there, slack-jawed, searching her eyes frantically. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” He turned abruptly and hurried from the room.
Harry watched the boys chatting around the room and he sat at the end of his bed, wiping sleep from his eyes. For the past five minutes, Ron had been talking to him groggily, but Harry was sure that neither of them would remember that conversation after five more. His eyes wandered to the bathroom door, waiting for someone to exit the shower so that he could get in. Just as he was about to look back at Ron, the door swung open. Malfoy emerged; white towel wrapped around his slim waist. Harry furrowed his eyebrows as the blond hurried to his bed with his head down, then snapped his curtains shut wordlessly.
Harry’s breathing shuddered as he attempted to calm himself and Draco felt a pang in his chest. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be. Harry saved so many lives… how could he possibly think any of this was his fault. He hadn’t asked for this, just as Draco hadn’t asked to be on the wrong side of the War. Besides, he was there when Fred died. He was killed in an explosion that could’ve just as easily killed anyone else. How was that Harry’s fault?
“What’s he sayin’? Does he know it’s you?”
Then he stood and walked away, leaving Draco on the ground, swiping his eyes with the heels of his hands. Harry strode briskly to the Great Hall to meet Ron and Hermione, who greeted him with warm smiles. He piled lasagna onto his plate and dug in, avoiding questions about what had happened with Draco altogether. Although, he couldn’t avoid it for long. Near the end of dinner his phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out stared at the glowing screen with a mix of relief and disbelief.
“I just…” he ran a hand through his hair. “Look at me and look at you. We are completely different. It put me in Slytherin before it even touched my head, Harry. And you’re nothing like me.”
The call had been quiet, but Harry had still picked it up from across the aisle. He glanced over to see Pansy tugging on Draco’s shoulder, the opposite one which was occupied by a tiny hamster. His gaze was focused on Harry’s desk and he scrunched his eyebrows, looking between Draco and the small bird. His silver eyes were openly staring, transfixed on the twittering creature. He snapped his fingers, but the other boy didn’t look up. His breathing was slightly heavier—Harry could see his chest rising and falling.
They turned to Harry again. Ned spoke. “But we thought you hated him.”
“Probably. He’s at the top of that class with me and Ernie.”
Malfoy left the note on his desk without a reply, but Harry swore he saw a smile flicker across his face as he rolled his eyes once more. He wondered why Malfoy lacked so much venom, as he’d become so accustomed to it now. It was almost unsettling without it.
As the boys headed to bed that night, many of them were goofing around. Blaise and Draco sat together on the latter’s bed, joking about something that had happened in between classes that day. Justin, Seamus, and Terry were stacking pillows on Michael’s back, stealing as many as they could before he woke up. Theo and Tony were standing by Ernie’s bed, the three of them discussing classwork (or at least that’s what they said), but many of the other’s assumed they were really discussing a prank they’d overheard one of the younger Slytherin girls was planning.
Hermione was chuckling as she scribbled an answer on her paper, and Susan and Sue seemed amused, judging by the nodding and laughing coming from them. Pansy, across from Draco, was simply beaming at her friend, and Harry knew why. She didn’t get to see him like this much anymore. And Harry hoped beyond hope that they’d all see more of his sense of humour and snark over the coming months.
‘I’ve just got some stuff going on, and they don’t really know about it. But it’s not important right now. You don’t even know me.’
Blaise shrugged. “I don’t know, honestly. Probably not. I think he’s struggling just like everyone else.”
But not. It was kind of nice, not bickering. Not trying to one up each other even in the first few days. But it did make him wary, because something had changed. A lot.
Ron looked puzzled. “Then why did you?”
“Yeah. It’s not that unusual. Always tried to hold everything back, even when we knew he was upset. Pansy or I would check on him and he’d just push us away. Anyways… Are you okay, Harry?”
“Muggle card game. I’ll teach you.”
Transfiguration antics, a group conversation, and dancing.
Harry rolled his eyes again, scratching the back of his neck. “Fine. At least
Harry waved the boys past him and jumped down into the next row with Blaise. The blond’s breathing had picked up, Harry noticed, as he got closer. He placed his hand on Draco’s shoulder, but the other boy flinched and shoved him off. Harry looked to Blaise, then back to Draco. “We need to move. They can put the fire out, out we have to go out in the corridor. Let’s go.”
The boys all looked at each other. “Well,” Seamus said. “Anyone care to find out how they managed to fit us all into one room?” There was some laughter from the group of boys as they followed Seamus to the stairs.
“Me, too.”
“Just let me clean you up, Draco. Stop being a stubborn git and sit your arse down in a chair.”
Malfoy looked back down at his book. “Yeah, well… you have a reason not to be.”
“That’s kinda nice for him.”
Harry smirked. “Did I startle you?”
“What? They’re cute!”
“I am, too,” Harry smiled.
The characters began floating away, into the distance beyond Draco’s reach. It wasn’t the woman who had been calling out.
Ron sighed. “Harry’s gunna stay with him a bit longer.”
“Yeah. Said some kids hexed you. Let’s see the damage.”
Harry shook his head. “Nothing. Nevermind.” Harry walked into the stall Draco had just occupied, closed the stall door behind him, then shoved the towel under it, away from the spray. He turned the shower on, twisting the knob until it was sure to be scalding. He closed his eyes with his head down, letting the heat wash over him, run into his eyes, and let the steam rise around him. His head shot up, gagging at the smell of blood. He whipped his head around, searching for it, but could not see while his glasses lay outside the door with his towel.
Harry stuffed his phone back in his pocket and headed for the stairs. A bit of potato had slipped off onto the stairs, but he doubted anyone would notice. He pushed the door open and slipped inside, unnoticed at first. Draco was laying on his stomach, as he usually was, typing on his phone. He shut it off when he heard Harry’s footsteps, and looked up, startled. His mouth dropped open slightly once he realized what Harry had in his hands, to which Harry smiled. “I, er… you didn’t eat. So I brought you some dinner.”
He grinned. ‘
“Forget it.”
Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor table cheered as Ned beamed, hopped off the stool, and strode down the aisle to where the prefects at the table sat. Ned slid onto the bench beside Hermione, staring at Harry. Harry smiled at the young boy.
“He can’t speak yet,” she said. “None of them can. They’re not strong enough. But soon enough, they’ll be able to.”
Harry smiled over at Draco, but he was staring at the textbook sitting on his desk. He was blinking at it slowly, head down. Harry wondered if maybe he was remembering something that had happened. But if it was Harry’s use of sectumsempra or Crabbe’s use of fiendfyre he wasn’t sure.
“We know that—”
be ashamed. He
“So are you. It just took you a while to realize it.”
“Drop it, mate,” said Neville. “I think he’s right. What do you all think?”
“You were all just trying to get out of there… I didn’t think you even noticed it slashing me.”
“And lastly, to my eighth years, once again. I ask you to please stay behind after the feast has ended. I will be leading you up to your new dormitory, as we do not have room for another dorm in your old ones. The staff and I have worked incredibly hard on it, so we sincerely hope it is to your tastes. And with that, let the feast begin!”
“Goodnight, Draco.”
“Oh, Merlin,” Harry smirked. “That couldn’t have ended well.”
Ginny smiled at them. “So? Ready for another season of ass-kicking?”
could
Harry smiled. “Don’t worry. Dean and I can help you out with that.”
Shocked that he texted first, he replied instantly. ‘
are coping. That’s all. I’ll see you in class.”
Tentatively, he turned his attention to Harry, who was holding up a deck of cards. Muggle cards. He quirked his head, then brushed a piece of hair out of his face before it could get into his eyes. “What is it?”
he’d beaten me to the answer.”
“Don’t we all. Say, when do you think you’ll be holding Quidditch trials?”
“What did you girls do last night?”
“Absolutely not,” Justin Finch-Fletchely barked. “We are all dealing with stuff. We are all probably going to have nightmares at some point, and would probably all appreciate being woken from them. I don’t think that any of us should use silencing charms at night for that.”
“Hey,” Pansy beamed. “You got a text from your number neighbour!”
“Why?”
“Odd?”
Hermione pursed her lips, then nodded. “You’re right, Neville.”
She nodded at him. “I hope he’s okay.”
Near the end of the practice, Harry coasted over to where Urquhart was resting on the ground observing his team. He eyed Harry as he approached but did not act hostile. Harry held his hand out after landing, which Urquhart took. “Welcome back,” Harry said with a grin.
“Harry,” Hermione said, placing a gentle hand on his arm. “What is it?”
He shook his head before going back to his phone and typing a response. ‘
Ron looked between Harry and Hermione. “Wait… there’s only seven dormitories. Where are we supposed to sleep? On the floor?”
“Of course I noticed,” Harry said in disbelief. “I’ve always been aware of you for some reason. And you
“Harry and Cedric helped each other in the Triwizard Tournment,” Ron pointed out, looking smug.
“No, Ron. What did we literally just talk about last night?”
Harry looked over at Blaise and Draco, then back to Hermione. He gestured for her to come closer and she leaned down for him to whisper. “I think Draco’s remembering the fiendfyre. I had to help Blaise get him to move. He’s panicking a little, I think.”
The Great Hall was full of chatter when Harry and Ron plopped down at the Gryffindor table across from Hermione. “Good morning,” she chirped, smiling at the pair over her muffin. “Have a good night last night?”
She raised her eyebrows. “A nightmare, I presume?”
Blaise blew air into his cheeks, then let it out. He looked up at Harry. “No. But he wouldn’t talk to me about it. Pushed me off when I got close enough to grab his wrist.”
“Are you guys working on the potions essay?” Padma asked.
Draco shrugged. “Off snogging some bloke, probably,” he chuckled. Then he pulled up a chair, so he was facing them both. “What were you two starting with?”
“Morning.”
“Okay, okay,” Ron digressed, holding his hands up. “Let’s just get started then. Hermione, what were you saying before?”
“Thanks,” Draco replied. He looked up, potatoes loaded onto his fork, then he looked down again. “I, er… I wasn’t going to play this year, originally,” he admitted.
A moment later he plopped down in the empty chair beside Harry, and the Gryffindor looked up. His blond hair was dishevelled and messy because of the wind. Harry decided he liked it that way, and also that his silver and green quidditch robes hugged his body nicely. He looked very attractive. Furrowing his brows at himself, he shook the thought away. “Windy out, was it?”
“Harry?” His gaze focused on Hermione across from him, her eyes boring into his.
“I’m not sure,” said Hermione. “But I’m sure they’ve thought of something.”
“Well, there’s quite a few, but the ones I know of are avis, bombarda, cantis, confringo, everte statum, expulso, flipendo, incarcerous, lacarnum inflamarae, levicorpus, langlock, locomotor mortis, mimblewimble, oppugno, petrificus totalus, reducto, rictumsempra, steleus, the stinging jinx, stupefy, and tarentellegra.”
Demelza smiled. “Okay. Thanks guys… I feel better now.”
Harry scowled.
The Great Hall was bustling with students when they walked in, as per usual, the smell of eggs and sausage mingling with the sugary sweet scent of cereals like Pixie Puffs. Yawning, Ron slid onto the bench beside Hermione and gave her a peck on the cheek.
“Has he been talking to you about… you know…what’s going on?”
She shrugged, looking between him and Ron. “I guess something else came up. I’m not sure what could have, though. She wasn’t very involved.”
Ron gestured to Harry, who took what he was asking as, ‘Are you staying?’ He nodded back.
“Fine,” she announced, shutting her book. “I’m going to the library early then. Ginny said she’d meet me in an hour. I’ll see you later.”
The boys around him laughed as Goyle glowered. “Whatever.”
As quietly as he could he opened his trunk, slipped on some jeans and a t-shirt, then tied his shoes. He didn’t want to wake the other boy, knowing he already had a particularly hard time sleeping. After closing the door silently, he jogged down the stairs to find Ron and Hermione. They were sitting on opposite couches from each other, Ron playing chess with Justin and Hermione reading. A plate of food between sat beside Ron that was untouched. Pansy sat beside Hermione, reading a magazine, while Blaise sat in an armchair, perusing a textbook.
“Have you now? How?”
“Look,” Harry interjected. “I know this wasn’t what we all had in mind… but at least we’re back. So what’s the harm in getting to know each other. We’ve all changed since we first met, and since the War, so what’s the harm in goofing around a bit?”
Hermione turned to him, hand outstretched. “Hi, Ned. I’m Hermione—”
“Now’s as good a time as any to ask him about it though. When you get a chance.” Draco nodded, eyes still transfixed on Harry, smiling as the song ended and Dean walked to his phone to change it. Some of the boys began clapping, and Draco joined in when Ron did.
Harry, Ron, and Draco headed upstairs around midnight, smiles still lingering on their faces from the night’s antics. As they neared the stop, music and singing reached Harrys ears. The lamenting instrumental and deep voice became clearer outside the door, and Harry looked at both Ron and Draco, who seemed bewildered, before pushing the door open silently. Dean and Michael were standing in the middle of the room, Take Me to Church by Hosier blasting from a speaker. It was about three-quarters of the way through, and the two were belting it out. The other boys watched in either amusement or annoyance.
Draco had a few unexpected encounters that day, and all of them had to do with none other than Harry Potter.
“Are you sure?”
“You wish!” Harry called back, handing the snitch to Seamus. He headed down to the centre of the pitch to start the match.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, eyes wandering to Draco. When his eyes snapped back to Hermione, she was smirking. “What?”
Harry stared at him a moment longer, then turned and left the room, wondering why his heart was racing. It was only Draco. He plopped down in a chair cross from Ron, with Hermione on his left and pulled out his Potions textbook, followed by his phone. It buzzed in his hand. ‘Its not always the same. Usually I feel like I can’t breathe, when really I’m hyperventilating. And I just can’t stop thinking, about everything or sometimes just one thing and it gets too much. I get really hot and I can’t always see properly and it freaks me out so I close my eyes and I get nauseous… It makes me shake and I hate it because sometimes I can’t stop for hours after… it makes me really exhausted. And they happen a lot so it makes school hard sometimes. But I’m not always aware of my surroundings and its terrifying so sometimes I’ll push people away and sometimes I won’t bc it brings me back to reality. Sometimes I can talk and tell someone what’s happening and sometimes I can’t say anything at all or sometimes I try and talk but none of it makes sense to me because half of what im thinking I’m saying out loud but not all of it… idk. But it scares the shit out of me.’
“Draco--”
“Thirdly, because of the events of last year I feel it very pressing that I comment on this. The war was fought bravely, and although there were tragic casualties, the students that you see in this room were all very brave and valiant. All of you deserve to be here. Please respect each other. No house is better, nor worse than another… and neither is any student. Work together, support each other… you have all seen some horrible things. The staff have been trained to help you deal with your trauma, and we would like you to know that there is always someone here to help you.
She rifled through her bag and produced a few sheets. To Harry’s surprise, he picked up his spare pen, and started drawing on the page. Hermione watched him curiously, as did Harry. He worked silently for a few minutes, before turning the sheet back to Hermione. She studied it, then circled a part. “I think the rest of it is right, but I don’t know about this part here…” She watched him as he tapped the pen against his chin. “Geez, Draco. Aren’t you hot in long sleeves? It was hot out today.”
“Perfect, Miss Granger. Five points to Gryffindor. How about someone else now… who can tell me some different defensive spells that come in handy? Yes, Mister Malfoy.”
Harry’s attention shifted entirely to the front of the room. The young girl who sat on the stool looked exactly like the young version of Cho Chang that Harry could remember. He pursed his lips, nodding to himself.
‘I’m gay. I like blokes.’
Harry chortled and Hermione took the mirror back and placed it on the table. Draco turned to her and, much quicker than Harry, turned Hermione’s hair platinum blond. He smirked and she picked up the mirror, grimacing. “Oh no… Draco, how is it that you and Luna can actually pull off this hair colour?”
’ he typed, then pressed send.
“So?” Dean said.
Pansy’s eyes lit up. “Really? You’d do that?”
“You did the same thing with Ginny!
Harry glanced down the table to where Ginny sat with Luna. She waved at him and he waved back, glad that they were on such good terms. ‘
“The only person who’s beaten me in grades is Granger. She’s the
‘I need someone to help bring me back to my senses, like what’s really happening around me. Get me to breathe I guess. That’s what I struggle with the most. It doesn’t help if ur rough w me. Makes it worse actually. Like if ur gunna touch me, which can work, don’t just grab me, u know? I already startle easily.’
“How’re you feeling this morning?”
“Seamus, mate, we all already knew that,” said Terry.
Of course, some of these things he’d already known, even if he’d tried not to admit it. The
Harry glanced passed them to the blond who sat with his eyes downcast, trying to sink into the floor. He looked back at the two first-years, but Hermione had started for him. “He saved our lives from Voldemort,” she said.
Harry smiled to himself. ‘
He wrenched his eyes open, glaring at the Dark Mark on his forearm. At the scars above and below it… the ones overtop that had become thin, white lines instead… At the chunk of angry, red skin that reformed every time he tried to cut it off. Eyes furious, loathing the brand of evil, of the choice he didn’t get to make for himself, he summed a razor. Draco stuck the corner into the red mark, then dragged it upwards, slicing underneath the skin. The snake could still be seen underneath—he dug deeper. Blood filled his palm and ran down his arm and leg, washed down the drain by the fierce pressure of the water. Finally, it severed, falling to the floor of the stall, leaving his arm searing and leaking fervently. He banished it, still cradling his arm. However, no matter how hard he tried to get away from it, to escape evil’s shadow, he wasn’t Peter Pan. He couldn’t get away, and the Dark Mark appeared in the same spot it would be for the rest of his life.
Ron emerged from the bathroom and strode towards him, holding his towel on. “Morning, mate.” He let the towel fall as he picked through his clothes to find his boxers. Harry raised a brow. “What? I’m too lazy to draw the curtains again and then put them back.”
“Is Draco still sleeping?” Blaise asked, not looking up from his textbook.
“It’s very faint… how do Professors read their work?”
Hermione shook her head, still laughing. “Oh, that’s too funny.”
“Yeah,” said Ron, taking a small step back.
‘Your best friend sounds like someone I’d be friends with’
“Snake got your tongue?” Ernie asked. “Worried you’ll make more of a fool of yourself? Let loose some dark secrets?”
‘No. His mate beat me to it. We aren’t exactly friends... but it was still unnerving to see him like that.’
Draco didn’t switch his gaze, just continued reading the same line over again for the third time. “Hi.”
“Scary?” Dean finished for Ernie, who nodded. “That’s what being tortured sounds like.”
Harry straightened up and pulled something from his pocket. “
“Nothing, Harry!” She smiled then, something glinting in her eyes. “How did the Quidditch planning go last night with Ginny?”
Harry furrowed his brows. “Then why would you agree?”
“Yes,
‘shut it. How about something you like to do?’
Ron wakes Harry early the next day, much to his dismay, to discuss the previous night's events. Gryffindor has quidditch trials that night, along with Slytherin.
He turned back to face the blond, who’s face showed poorly concealed shock. “Yeah?”
Harry was mostly quiet now—only sniffles escaped him every now and then. Ron was mumbling to him, but the sound didn’t travel as far as it had before. A smile tugged at the blond’s lips, glad that Harry had such a good friend. He picked his book back up, scanning the lines, but they didn’t really sink in. His mind was on Harry and nothing seemed to be able to pull it away. He was talking with Ron in hushed voices and didn’t seem so distraught anymore. The thickness of tears in his voice had left and it now held the grogginess of sleep. He chuckled and Draco smiled in spite of himself, hiding his face behind the pages. After fighting it off his face he lowered the book slightly, eyes watching over the top of the old paperback. Ron had retreated to his own bed and drawn the curtains.
Ernie laughed, as did some of the other boys. “Why did you even bother to come back, Malfoy? Why are you even here?” Malfoy still didn’t answer. “Stupid prick,” Ernie mumbled. “Acting like this just cuz’ he doesn’t rule the school anymore. Daddy’s power ran out.”
Finally, while stirring another ingredient into the mix, she turned to Harry. “So, how’s the ‘number neighbour’ situation going?”
Harry laughed. “Of all dogs, Blaise, you choose a Beagle?”
“31?”
‘You sound like a good friend.’
Harry nodded his head towards the side of the pitch. “She’s already training over there with Jimmy.”
only children. All very young. Especially when this started, when they were only 14. Now, at 18, Draco was a shell of the confident, arrogant boy Harry had known. Who he’d possibly been taught to be. But whatever he had been, he wasn’t that now. And Harry desperately wanted him to stop crying… to take this pain he was feeling and… and… he didn’t know. But he knew that on top of whatever suffering was going-on post-war… there was something else. It had triggered something else. Possibly something that had been dormant…
The reply came a moment later, causing both Ron and Hermione to look at him questioningly. ‘Hi.’
Draco felt a pang of disappointment run through him, but from what part of the conversation he wasn’t sure. Probably just from missing Quidditch, he presumed. He had always had a natural talent for flying, and missed being able to show it off as the boys were describing.
Draco gave him a look that was eerily similar to one Hermione often gave them. “Doesn’t mean I shouldn’t be working on it.”
Harry returned to the task at hand, placing two sandwiches on his plate. He took a sip of his pumpkin juice, sloshing a little over the side of his goblet when his phone buzzed.
“I knew this would happen!”
The three are silent for a few moments, each caught up in their own thoughts, or, book. Harry fiddled with his wand between his fingers, the scar on his right hand catching the light. He glanced away from it to the untied lace on his shoe. Hauling his leg up onto the seat he slung one into a loop and tied it. “It’s weird, isn’t it? Coming back here? After everything… and it’s supposed to just go back to normal? I mean… nothing feels normal. I certainly don’t. This train ride doesn’t… how is this school year supposed to?”
“Why?” Dean questioned. “We don’t even really know them.”
The girls nodded. Padma sat next to Harry and Sue sat beside Ron, both pulling out partially started essays. Harry went back to his paper, adding a transition sentence onto his first body paragraph, squinting at it skeptically. Padma eyed him but said nothing. His phone buzzed once more and he held it away from Padma, not that she would’ve tried to read what he was saying, but just to be sure.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Potions.”
Once they were all settled around the window, Harry spoke up. “Okay, so I know this is going to sound stupid, but hear me out. I think we should introduce ourselves, because a lot of us don’t really know each other or anything about each other.”
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him. “Are you thick? Of course there is! We all just went through a bloody war.”
His heart was beating faster, he could feel it.
Dean waved a hand. “They’ll figure it out eventually.”
Harry shrugged, staring at the knife slicing his gurdyroots. “I dunno. Anything, really.”
Harry frowned. “Did that to me too, the other night. At first at least.”
Malfoy raised his eyes to meet Blaise’s. There was something present there which Harry couldn’t understand, yet wished he could. Malfoy shook his head, trying to make Blaise take them back. He wouldn’t.
Hermione flipped the page and made a disgusted noise. Harry glanced up at her, briefly. “What?”
He grasped the blond’s arm, and Blaise grasped the other one, and together they tugged him forwards. His gaze snapped away and he hurried with Harry and Blaise, taking wild looks back at the orange glow and jets of water. Blaise elbowed his way through a group of people and brought them to a bench against the wall, where Harry pulled Draco down to sit. He was back to staring at the flames, which were slowly being put out. Harry could tell it wasn’t that serious, but obviously to Draco, it did not seem that way. Blaise, who sat on Draco’s other side, surveyed him. He was heaving for breath, completely unaware that some other students were staring at him. It was as if all he could see was the fire. The scene repeating in his head like a broken record. Crabbe’s scream as he fell into the inferno…
Feeling heat rising in his face he licked his lips, then said, “Okay, er… what is it?”
“Come on, Ron,” Hermione chortled. “Just do it!”
Heart pounding, Draco startled awake early the next morning. The nightmare, now receding back into the depths of his brain, had left him sick and sweaty. His platinum hair was plastered to his face, his clothes soaked in sweat. Throwing his legs over the side of the bed and pushing through the curtains, he flew to the bathroom and into a toilet stall, dropped to his knees and emptied his stomach. He tried to stay quiet as he retched, not wanting to wake any of the other boys when they still had half an hour to sleep. He panted in between heaves, frustrated at himself for allowing this to happen again. Although, he knew it wouldn’t stop anytime soon. It happened every day… it got the best of him.
Draco Malfoy: ‘Hey. I just wanted to thank you for the advice. The same guy as before had a nightmare last night and I went and checked on him.’
“A few final notes before I release you to your own devices. You are allowed to sit at whichever table you would like for meals. Also, for this year only, you will be allowed to return to your positions on your house Quidditch teams, should you so choose.” She glanced at a few students in particular, whose eyes shone with this news. “When you eventually retreat upstairs for the night, please note that your beds have been chosen for you. The colour of your bedding represents your house, and you will find your trunks at the foot of your bed. Any questions?” No one raised their hand. “Perfect! I hope that you all have a wonderful final year. I know you are all dealing with your own grief and your own struggles… I hope that you can overcome you differences and find support and friendships in one another. And, please do remember, that you can always reach out to myself or another staff member if you feel you need help, or someone else does. Goodnight to you all.”
Im ok. U?’
Hermione didn’t glance up from the book she had her nose buried in. “You could always go for any type of food, Ron.”
He nodded. “Yeah, sounds good.”
Dean chuckled. “Of course I have. I’m a master at it, back home.”
Something wasn’t right, here.
Susan flicked her long red plait over her shoulder, looking across the table. “Hey, Pansy?”
“Sure.”
Blaise stood. “I’ll go.” The group watched as he dusted himself off and headed for Malfoy’s bed. Blaise stuck his head through the emerald curtains, and their muffled voices could be heard. A moment later Blaise closed the curtains and returned to the group. He sat back down on the floor, looking up at Harry. “He said he’s fine and he’s just going to read.”
“Huh?” He looked down, and sure enough, his screen had lit up.
Draco consoles Harry after a bad nightmare. The other boys think something's up.
“No…” Harry whispered. “I’d have to fall asleep for that. My brain just doesn’t shut up sometimes. Can you have nightmares while you’re awake?”
The portrait swung inwards, like how the one in Gryffindor tower did. The old witch stepped inside, beckoning for the rest of them to follow her inside. Once this was achieved, smiles graced many of their faces. The common room was mainly stone and wood, with a large fireplace on one end of the room. In front of it sat a wooden coffee table surrounded in a semi-circle with a long couch and two chairs. On the far left was a large bay window with a sill, as well as a few small tables and one long one beside it. On the immediate right on the door they had just come in was an enormous bookshelf, which Hermione grinned at, eyes sparkling. In the middle of the room, on a purplish-grey carpet were two long couches and two armchairs, which formed a circle. A couple of end-tables sat with them, as well. And finally, a spiral staircase with a gold-coloured railing led to where they could all only assume was their dormitories.
Ron looked over Harry’s shoulder and he flinched, almost throwing his phone. “Sorry, didn’t mean to startle you,” said Ron, cringing. “I forgot about that. Are you texting Malfoy?”
“Very true.”
“Very observant, Potter. And you’re talking to me
It sounded as though Ron had choked on something. “No I wouldn’t! She’s already into me.” Harry and Dean both laughed. “What? I don’t need to impress her.”
Malfoy tested it on his parchment. “It’s grey.”
Most of the other boys were awake when Harry sat up the Wednesday morning. He’d accidentally fallen asleep with his curtains open, and could see his peers milling around the room, chatting idly as they got ready for the day. However, Harry quickly noticed that he wasn’t the only one who’d left their curtains open—Malfoy had done the same thing. His hair stuck up slightly where it hit the pillow, and he looked more relaxed than Harry had seen him in a long time. In his outstretched hand lay a novel, but what novel it was Harry could not quite make out. Malfoy was only holding onto it loosely, as if it would fall any moment.
Harry spots something weird getting ready for class, Hermione tells the boy's about antics in the girls' dormitory, and Harry discovers his unlikely number neighbour.
“See the pink tip on the other end?” Malfoy nodded. “Rub that against the pencil mark you made.”
Another chair pulled out, this time the one beside where Harry’s bag was sitting. Blaise sat down, tapping Hannah’s arm and mumbling something about how he had a herbology question but couldn’t find Neville.
“Where did you get all of your makeup?” Hermione voiced. “I thought witches usually just used their wands?”
Blaise, Seamus, and Dean snickered, while Justin, Neville, and Ernie rolled their eyes. The cries and Draco’s incoherent mumbling from inside the curtain subsided and the group turned back to the curtains as if they could see through them to the pair of boys sitting in silence.
Beside him, Hermione was grinning at a fluffy guinea pig, revealing that she’d always wanted one as a kid. She rambled on, and Harry half-listened, attempting to turn his quill into, well, anything. At first all he managed was a worm, and Hermione grimaced, picking up the limp body in between her fingers. Even Ron had turned around and stuck his tongue out in disgust. Harry cursed under his breath, took the worm from Hermione and tried again. He closed his eyes, focused on the wand movement, then opened them to see a small, light grey bird. It turned its small beak up at him, eyes taking him in with curiosity. He smiled, leaning back in his chair to observe it.
“We need to accept each other,” Harry said softly. “All of us. And as much as you may not like it, that includes him, too. Got it?”
She eyed him suspiciously but didn’t dispute. “Okay, just checking. You seemed upset.”
‘I think I have PTSD, and it’s making things really hard for me. But I don’t think it’s just that. I think other things are going on too, like anxiety and idek what else. I don’t understand what’s happening to me but it’s driving me nuts. Idk how to stop it or what to do about it. One of the boys in my dorm is starting to figure it all out if he hasn’t already and I’m scared. I don’t want him to spread it around or just think I’m weak or that I deserve it, even though I do. I know I do. But the War was really hard on me and some of the stuff that happened I just can’t shake. It comes out at the worst times and I can’t control it and I feel like I’m losing Im my mind.’
“Not bad, actually. Lavender and Parvati stood in the middle, picked something from the pile and asked who’s it was. I learned a lot about some of the girls.”
Hey everyone! I hope you enjoyed this chapter as much as I enjoyed writing it! Let me know your thoughts in the comments. Until next time! -Emma :)
Harry didn’t head to bed until late that night. He’d spent most of his evening planning Quidditch trials and new plays with Ginny. They were up until two am talking technical and tactical approaches until she could barely keep her eyes open, almost spilling a mug of tea on their carefully sculpted diagrams. Harry sent her off to bed, hoping that she wouldn’t be caught out of bed after curfew. He wasn’t sure if McGonagall, or Filch for that matter, would be more or less strict after the war.
Harry caught Hermione staring at him out of the corner of his eye. “What?”
“Five points to Ravenclaw. Anyone else want to name a few? Alright, Mister Finch-Fletchely.”
‘Fine.’
“Looks more like flirting to me.”
“The babbling curse, conjunctivitis, furnunculus, obscuro, serpensortia, slugulus errecto, and ventus are some others I’ve read about or used.”
“Don’t be,” Ron waved a hand. “Could’ve been me waking everyone else up. It was Neville a few days ago. Before that it was Justin. It happens to all of us.”
“Yeah, that works.” Harry handed her the parchment, then continued slicing as she wrote. He read it over when she placed it in front of him. ‘You okay? – Harry & Hermione’ He levitated it and let it fall onto Malfoy’s desk.
McGonagall rose from behind her desk slowly, shaken by the sudden explosion. She looked out over the room, to a third of her mixed-year class under their desks. She was sure that they too had just relived their own traumas from the war in the span of one minute. She sighed sadly, then addressed the rest of her class who had not reacted so severely as the rest took their seats. “I want to remind you all, that some of your classmates are really struggling with the events they witnessed and went through in the war. And for some, even for a few years prior to that. This may happen sometimes… reactions like this. And to those of you who may be struggling, and who just dropped like I did… you are safe. This is a safe place for you, and no harm shall come to you here. I am sincerely sorry for what you have all had to go through. As for class, we will take a short break. If you need to leave, that is okay. You are dismissed. I hope you are okay, and if you are not, I, as well as all of the other teachers and your
!” Him and Justin had been duelling fiercely, and they both had to move diligently to avoid getting hit.
“Thanks?” Harry looked in the mirror and then nodded. “Thanks.”
‘Good’
Blaise smirked. “He was clearly holding Harry right against his chest. I mean, when I’ve gotten him through nightmares or vice-versa we’ve hugged each other, but never like
McGonagall had the class working on human transfiguration that day. Harry grinned at Hermione when they were able to start practicing. He knew that Hermione was good at this particular branch of magic, as she had transfigured Ron the previous year, and was hoping she could give him some pointers. She rolled her eyes in response, knowing what he was thinking. “Don’t get your hopes up, Harry.”
“Not really. Ginny’s still gunna take her anger at a guy who catcalled her today out on me!”
“Well, you’ll let me know if you find anything out, right? I want to be there for him, too.”
Malfoy looked up at all the eyes staring at him. He picked at his fingers in his lap. “Draco. I speak French and I… er—”
“We brought you some food, Harry,” said Hermione.
“That’s not the same thing, Ronald! They could’ve died…” Her voice petered out as she realized what she’d said, her eyes glancing at Harry.
Malfoy nodded. “Okay.” He returned to his book.
Draco’s face softened and he dropped his gaze. “Just go.” Harry nodded, leaving the room wordlessly, and leaving Draco alone with a tightness in his chest and throat that he couldn’t get to leave.
Harry’s eyes widened with realization. The bird looked almost exactly like the ones that used to be in the cage upstairs. The one by the room of requirement. The one which was now empty… Harry turned abruptly to his desk, closed his eyes and redid the spell. When he opened them again, a caterpillar inched towards Hermione. He turned back to his left. Draco was blinking furiously, looking at his desk with Pansy’s hand on his shoulder.
Harry was shaking his head with a smile when a thought struck him. “He used to get in a lot of shit for that from his parents, you know.”
“Said he was going back to the dorm. Probably won’t come to dinner tonight so I’ll bring him some.”
Harry chuckled. “Your name is kind of a given. But we could also do… how about an interesting fact or two about yourselves?” The group shrugged collectively, some snickering out a “yeah” or a “sure.” Harry pointed to himself. “I guess I’ll start. Uh… I’m Harry. I… man I didn’t think this through. I can no longer speak Parseltongue and I kind of have an obsession with Chocolate Frogs.”
And he was anonymous.
“Are you alright, Harry?”
Friday came quickly, much to the students delight. The last few days had been spent mostly doing homework, but they had been able to do much of it together, which made it seem not as bad. Today many of them had a light load of classes and were praying for the day to go by quickly. Many of them had transfiguration as their final class of the day, and because McGonagall was the favourite professor of many, they looked forward to her class.
Harry hid behind a suit of armour as he watched Goyle bash into Draco, sending his small figure flying into the wall and sliding down to the floor with a thud. He looked up at the other Slytherin, dazed. “Scared, Malfoy?”
Malfoy flinched, but tried to cover it up but readjusting his position. Harry’s eyes narrowed at him. “Yeah. He did. Anything else you’d like to remind me of, Potter? Or is that enough for one day?”
“What happened to ‘best two out of three?’”
Harry did a double take, staring at the spots of red on the floor. By one of the middle showers, the water was tinged slightly with red. A few droplets of blood could be seen on the floor there, as well. Harry sucked a breath in. The boys would usually shave in a mirror, and showers don’t normally have mirrors… So why was one of the boys bleeding? And which one of them was it? Harry stood on his tip-toes trying to see their hair over the stall doors, but they were too high. He stooped to look under. Pale skinned feet. That ruled out Blaise…
“It’s not that bad, honestly—”
‘Nothing major. A little rough. But when isn’t it.’
Harry furrowed his brows. “You think they’ll make another dorm? For the first years? Because every year we’ve had the same dorm.”
“Leave me alone,” he sniffed. “I’m fine.”
excited about something again.” Harry paused, handing her another ingredient. She dropped it in and stirred. “How’s it going with all the girls in your dorm?”
“No!” His heard whipped up to look at Harry. He wasn’t sure what was worse, seeing the tears still falling down his cheeks or the desperate look in his eyes. “Because you don’t know me! You don’t know what I’ve been through and even if there was something more going on, I wouldn’t tell. So why are you trying?”
Ron threw the door open as Harry did up his fly and he was still fiddling with his helmet. Ginny rolled her eyes at the pair, turning and walking back down the stairs. They quickly caught up to her, pushing past Blaise, Pansy, and Draco on their way out. Briefly, Harry’s eyes met Draco’s, before the other boy tore his gaze away.
How could Lupin and Tonks be proud of him when he was the reason their son was an orphan? And some Godfather he was, returning to Hogwarts and leaving baby Teddy with Andromeda Tonks. At least Sirius had a good reason for being absent. And Fred… how come Fred wasn’t livid? He knew George was suffering, knew that he’d been separated from his twin because of Harry. His entire family was suffering because of
Eyes at the Slytherin table went wide as they stared at the sweet looking girl in front of them. Of course, many of them remembered being so young an innocent, it was only that none of them felt that way anymore. Alice blinked at them, confusion evident on her face. She didn’t quite realize what was going through the heads of her peers… the first student sorted right after the war, the war started by Slytherin supremacists, and not fought against by many Slytherin students, was one of them. However, unlike past years, there was no booing. Only stunned silence.
Hermione gave him a look. “And that’s useful to me how?”
Harry and Ron looked at each other, then Harry glanced over his shoulder at Draco, then back to Hermione with a sigh. “Draco was screaming his head off in the middle of the night and woke us all up.”
They joined their peers at their house tables silently, sliding along the wooden benches to their desired places. Although the school was open, the Hall seemed incredibly empty. There were less students than there had previously been… Harry glanced down the table at the spot where he normally would’ve seen Colin Creevey, his camera lens glinting. The table of Hogwarts staff where he should’ve seen the scowling face of Severus Snape… And, the vacant space at the Slytherin table that belonged to Vincent Crabbe. He could still hear the boy’s scream as he fell into the fire, the look on Malfoy’s face as he watched his friend disappear, and they way that he had gripped Harry as they’d flown out of the inferno— from one monster into another.
The Slytherin Quidditch team had practice that night, so Draco, Daphne, Goyle, and Blaise were gone for most of the evening. Due to her friends being out at practice, Pansy had pulled up a chair with the trio and sidled down to do some homework. For quite a while it was just the four of them, but eventually both Susan Bones and Sue Lie sat down to join them.
“He’s only thinking so hard because all of his hobbies include being a Death Eater,” sniggered Ernie. Some of the boys laughed.
“Or both.”
Harry made a face, surprised at this revelation. He knew Malfoy was smart, but he’d never realized how bookish he really was.
When Thursday morning arrived, no one was quite ready to start duelling again for DADA. Not the students who’d fought in the war at least. Harry stalked through the halls with Ron towards the classroom, and Hermione had gone early to talk to Professor Spunks about how this could affect some of the class. Harry shoved his wand into his pocket and frowned at Ron, knowing he was thinking the same things as he was. Many of the other eighth years had an look of apprehension on their faces, as did a few of the seventh years as they entered the classroom.
He shook his head. “No. he’ll know it’s me, and he can’t know yet.”
‘Funny. If u actually knew me, you would.’
He took it tentatively, eyes focused on the half-clear, half dark tube of ink. He rolled it between his fingers, looked in the hollow end as well as the tip. Then he handed it back to Harry. “So the ink is in the tube, and it comes out when you apply pressure?”
Harry felt a pang in his chest, his eyes widening. He was taken aback by this feeling and looked down at himself. He heard Hermione’s concern in her voice as she said, “Are you okay, Harry?”
Harry and Ron were summoned by Ginny after classes that day. They had bolted upstairs after their final class and changed from their robes into their scarlet and gold quidditch uniforms. She had been let in by Hermione and was startling the two boys within two minutes.
“I was imprisoned in their cellar, remember? Because of the snatchers?”
Charms class that afternoon went slightly haywire. Not from the beginning, of course. It started just like any other class. Flitwick had them working on some more review, just of charms they had learned in the last couple of years to get that mindset back again. Harry sat near the top of the room, situated between Hermione and Ron. Seamus and Dean sat on Ron’s right,  goofing off with charms they’d learned over the summer. Flitwick was shaking his head at them, but his smile showed he was impressed. Hemione was talking to Sue and Padma, who were sitting nearby as well. In the next row down, Draco and Blaise were practicing the bubble-head charm. Draco had the bubble around his head, smiling at Blaise, who poked it with his wand. Draco, faking offence, backed away from his friend, pointing his wand at him.
Those words seemed to break Draco out of his daze. He stood abruptly and took off in the opposite direction from everyone else. Blaise stood to follow but Harry held up a hand. “My turn.” He spun on his heel and left in the same way as Draco had, leaving Hermione and Blaise staring after him.
His eyes moved back to Harry. He still sat upright, sniffing. He wiped his eyes with the back of his hands, swiping away the stray tears lingering on his cheeks. Then he let out a long breath, rolled over onto his left side, and tried to find sleep.
“Please, just drop it, guys. I said something stupid. That’s all.”
Ron smiled. “You don’t have to. I think I kinda get it. I mean, I don’t think everyone should go after him. He was nasty as a kid but he’s different now. We are
Harry gulped. “Remember that curse I used on Malfoy, back in sixth year?”
Blaise looked up. “You don’t?”
Another instant reply. ‘that would take too long to explain, and make my identity way too obvious.’
Harry and Ron looked at each other then back at Pansy, who sipped at her tea. “Draco and Blaise both left the table halfway through breakfast.”
“I dragged you up onto that stack of furniture while you were unconscious! I could’ve left you there. But I didn’t.”
Another instant reply. ‘Don’t be.’
The boys all spun to face the pair, and a commotion erupted around the room.
Ron Weasley: He doesn’t know I’m texting u.
“Oi!” Draco called, sneering at the larger Slytherin. “Goyle! Why don’t you shut your buffoon sized mouth! We don’t need your opinion.”
“Giving you freckles.”
“I don’t know,” shrugged Dean. “Maybe because he’s had it put on him? I’m not sure.”
Dean nodded. “I could hear him from the upper floors, even though I was in the cellar, with Luna. She heard, too. I’m glad Harry was able to wake him up. I think he knew what was happening, too.”
By the time lunch rolled around, Harry had been wondering what had happened all morning. It wouldn’t leave him alone, the smell of blood nagging at him during his lessons. It had to have been Malfoy… right? He was the only one in that stall that morning, and the scent had been
Harry took that all in, reading it over several times as he walked back to the common room with Ron and Hermione. As he stepped inside the room with them, he scanned it for Draco. When he was sure he wasn’t there, he typed back. ‘
He stopped between his bed and Malfoy’s, contemplating. The boy looked so peaceful reading, unlike how he’s seemed since the sixth year. He didn’t seem on edge now, or like he was carrying the world on his shoulders at sixteen years old… However, something still nagged at Harry. He tossed his toothbrush onto his bed and padded over to Malfoy’s. Hesitantly, he tapped him on the shoulder.
“No. But thank you.”
‘potions…’
‘They might not see it that way.’
“Fine, fine,” Ron gave in, a smile spreading across his face. He opened his messages and brought up a new conversation. ‘
“Thanks,” he said sheepishly. His cheeks were flushed, but Harry couldn’t tell if it was from the wind or embarrassment. Harry nodded at him and they were back to circling, having lost the snitch.
“Harry!”
one.”
Harry cringed, remembering what had happened. Draco had probably still been awake. ‘
Harry slung his bag onto his shoulder. “Yeah, let’s head out.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “It was alright.”
Draco took a sharp intake of breath, a physical pain registering in his chest. He shook his head. “Harry…” The Gryffindor was inconsolable at the moment, and he had no idea how Harry had managed to calm
“Excellent! Of course, as I said, I will not tolerate the use of those spells in this room, under any circumstances. They are incredibly dangerous. Five more points to Slytherin.”
Seamus looked at Dean, who only shook his head before dropping his gaze. When he looked backup he was smirking. “Have you payed any attention to Seamus and I? At all? Because… well…”
He raised an eyebrow with a smirk. “No. Time to do some reading for me.” He sank down in the other armchair there, opening his book and fiddling with his wand in his right hand.
“What’re you thinkin’ about, mate?”
She nodded. “Time. Forgiveness. And an open mind.”
She laughed, shaking her head at him. “Can’t tell me I didn’t try.”
problems on this earth that need attending to. ‘
are here for you.” She stared pointedly around the room; hands clasped in front of her. “We shall resume in fifteen minutes.”
“Yes, Draco. Why is that so shocking?”
Hey all! I had fun writing this chapter, so let me know what you think! Until next time. -Emma :)
“Probably the same as they were last year. Not that we’d really know that schedule.”
Abruptly, Malfoy stood. He handed Blaise the box of sweets and turned his back, heading for his bed. Harry watched him with curious eyes, the other boys mainly with sneers of satisfaction. Malfoy snapped his curtains closed, hiding him from their glares. The boy’s turned back to each other, rolling their eyes. The malice was gone though—they knew they’d went too far.
. But he said he’s never been allowed to and… I dunno, Hermione. He told me a lot of things I bet he never would have admitted before, especially to me. And then later he texted me about it, not knowing it was me of course, but he told me he thinks he has PTSD and anxiety, which makes sense. I mean, a lot of us do. And we talked about what happens when it’s bad and what helps and what doesn’t, and how he should tell people he trusts…”
His fingers flew over the keys.
Faith opened her mouth to object as McGonagall’s voice filled the room. “Good evening everyone, and welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few announcements before we begin the feast. First off, I would like to welcome back our eighth years. They are students who’s final year was interrupted during the Wizarding War, and have been invited back to finish their NEWTs. Please treat them as you would any other student.
“She wasn’t even a Death-Eater,” said Ron. “What do they want with her now?”
“I’m surprised I didn’t sleep in,” Ron laughed.
Hermione tapped her chin with her wand. “Change the colour of my hair.”
Harry pulled a face. “Who do you take me for?” Ron smiled, then went back to staring at Hermione’s book. Harry’s phone lit up again. ‘He helped me through the aftermath of a nightmare where I relived something awful that happened to me. He’s always checking on me. He keeps telling me he knows I’m not okay and that I should talk to someone. But idk how. I’ve just always been told that I should just take it and I deserve it anyways but it just hurts so bad. And I can’t show it outwardly. I can’t ask for help. I just can’t. I’ve never been like that. I guess that’s because nothing was ever this bad, it was just trivial things. But the last few years have been cruel. Ik it’s not just me. So many people are suffering, so why shouldn’t I? If they can all deal with it, I should just do it on my own, too. It shouldn’t matter what I’m going through, right?’
“But you’re not fine. I know you’re not.”
’You don’t know him or me… trust me. He would.’
Ron laughed. “Is that that thing that ‘Mione was using back in the summer?”
“Ravenclaw!”
After staring at the message or a solid 30 seconds, Harry typed back. ‘
“Er, yeah. Have you seen him?”
Hermione. I appreciate it, but I’m coping. Some days are hard, but you will either be able to tell or I’ll let you know. Yeah?”
“That’s rough,” said Hermione. “It’s been hard on all of us. He doesn’t deserve that.”
Ron sighed. “I guess the people who post this stuff online have just gotten lucky. Your turn, Harry.”
“Why did you take it?” Harry asked.
He looked around at everyone else at the table who were either in t-shirts or had their sleeves rolled, then down at himself in his vest and long-sleeved button down. “No. It’s getting colder now that its evening.” Hermione looked at him skeptically but said nothing. He turned the paper back to her. “What do you think about this?”
The Slytherin didn’t miss a beat. “I’m bored. You’re reading. Let’s play snap.” To Harry and Ron's surprise, the two girls had been talking quite a bit since they got back, although they never did before. Ron had told Harry he thought it was because their beds were across from each other, and they had a few classes together.
“Huh.” A ghost of a smile appeared on his face. “So is that all muggles have to write with? Like us with quills?”
Harry frowned when he read the last text, wanting to respond, but it was time to go to class. ‘U dont know the half of it.’
Malfoy dropped his gaze, staring at the floor. “Why would you assume that I’m not?”
He scratched the back of his neck with his wand. “Not yet, but I’ve looked at it. Why?”
“Okay,” said Seamus, nodding with a smirk.
They were all working on homework from DADA, rifling through textbooks and scribbling answers on paper. The time passed smoothly. They chatted amongst themselves, sometimes conversing with others passing their table, sometimes laughing at each other and poking fun. Harry enjoyed it. He’d never really gotten to know Susan or Sue, and was glad that he was being given the chance to. Hermione was right, Sue was ridiculously funny, and he could see how Susan and Hermione had made fast friends through the years.
“Start of term… I thought I told you. Some guy that goes here. What are the chances?”
Harry watched as they all headed down towards them. Daphne gave him a smile, as did Blaise, while Goyle scowled. Draco pulled out of a spinning dive upside-down to look at Harry momentarily, a questioning look in his eyes. Harry nodded at them before returning to instruct his own team. He glided to where he was at the same level as Hermione and Seamus in the stands. “Can you guys collect the balls from the chasers and beaters then re-release them? We are gunna scrimmage Slytherin.”
The crying doesn’t get very loud, explaining why none of the other boys got up to investigate. Harry was probably the only other person awake. He debated getting up to see who it was and maybe sitting with them for a moment, but he took too long to decide. There were a few shuddering breaths and then the boy stopped crying. Harry’s heart lurched. He knew how it felt, to cry by yourself at night, after everything that had happened. Night was when his thoughts were the most overwhelming… they overpowered him sometimes, though not as often as they had at first. Harry bit his lip as he shoved the map under his pillow after deactivating it. He rolled over on his side, wondering whose pain he’d been eavesdropping on.
‘Year?’
He glanced up from his email inbox to look at her. “Can we please
A mishap in transfiguration leads to realisations of trauma and uncomfortable conversations.
up so late?”
“I’m fine.”
Harry rolled his eyes, then nudged him back. “Not gunna happen.”
Harry and Hermione leaned against each other as Ron held her hand, stroking his thumb over her knuckles. He looked rather pale before, but his colour was beginning to come back as he talked to Neville. He was only mumbling back to Ron as he sat with his head in his hands, elbows on Hermione’s desk.
“Back off!”
“But this early?”
“Scared of my sister, Draco?”
Draco’s chest tightened as he put his book down, straightening up against his headboard. As Ron got closer, he whispered, “
“What do you mean?” Blaise asked.
Harry nodded solemnly. “Yeah. I went over to him after Goyle left and he just kept saying he was fine. I told him that I knew he wasn’t and that he was allowed to
By this point, Draco was mostly recovered. He was breathing almost normally again, and the trembling had mostly subsided. He leaned back against the wall, raising his head, though his eyes were closed. Harry watched him as he swiped at his eyes, sniffling, his face red, blotchy, and tear streaked. His chest tightened at the sight. Without looking at him, Draco spoke. “You can leave… you should get back to bed…”
They made their way to their beds in silence, not wanting to disrupt the only other person in there—Malfoy. He was laying on his stomach, reading, book propped up on the foot of his bed. Harry decided to copy him, spreading his work out in front of him, and praying that his inkwell wouldn’t fall over. Ron sat against his headboard; parchment draped over a textbook. His potions book was open in front of him, and he glanced down every few seconds to read from it. The boys bickered back and forth periodically about their answers.
He nodded. “Yeah, alright. Why not?” He watched as Harry grinned at the cards and found himself trying to supress one of his own. Harry shuffled them, cut the deck, then started dealing. He picked up a face card and surveyed it’s still image, then smirked up at the rest of the group. “I’m gunna win.”
Harry reread the text from Draco and smiled. ‘
“Ned.”
Hey everyone! So sorry for the lack of updates recently! I got my wisdom teeth out, had exams for my summer class, and kind of became a part of a new fandom. One of my best friends got me into this anime called Bungo Stray Dogs and now I'm addicted. I've written some one shot's for it so if you're also a fan, maybe check them out! I've never watched anime before but I relly enjoyed it! Anyways, the next chapter of this story as well as Unmasked should be up soon! Thanks for reading and let me know your thoughts! Until next time. -Em :)
Ron turned to him, brows raised. “What’s so funny?”
‘Fine. U?’
Ron flushed a bright red from the tips of his ears to his chin, stuffing his book as close to his face as he could. Harry knew that feeling, the one of wishing the world would swallow you up whole… He bet that Malfoy was feeling it, too. He watched as Malfoy looked back up at Ron’s hidden face, and relief washed over him. Harry bit his lip as he watched him, sure Malfoy thought he wasn’t watching.
There was a unanimous agreement among them, and they all headed back to their beds, drawing their curtains.
“That’s because it’s not. But I don’t know exactly what. He’s always been one to hide how he feels. Drilled into him, I guess. That or he’s scared.”
The blond stormed to the bathroom and Harry watched him go, then turned and left the room with Ron.
“Do you like them?” Harry asked, surprised.
Harry pursed his lips. “Yeah.” His stare lingered for a moment longer, before he pushed through the curtains and out of sight.
She shook her head. “Not really. Draco just up and left, and then Blaise followed muttering something about ‘getting to the bottom of something.’ Whatever that means.”
Outside Draco’s curtains, Blaise still sat with Ron in silence. The two were utterly bewildered, but somehow, not at all surprised. Blaise chuckled to himself, recalling Draco’s reply to Goyle.
Harry’s gaze followed Blaise’s as it traveled to Draco’s empty bed and back. “No one is your responsibility but yourself. You need to make sure that
Harry felt himself flush and forced his eyes down to his cereal. “Yeah. Me too.”
“How did he not end up in jail?” Faith whispered.
,” and sent it towards Harry so Ron could see him. He knew Ron was sitting on the edge of the boy’s bed, but he couldn’t bring himself to take his eyes off of Harry.
Across the aisle from him, Draco was crouching, ashen faced and staring between Dean and Luna, then the splintered desk. He was breathing heavily, wand hand shaking as he held it out in front of him. Pansy was leaned over him, mumbling. “Get up, it’s okay. It wasn’t an attack. You’re fine…” He stayed put.
“Yeah,” Pansy said, a smile ghosting her lips. “I’m sure he will.”
A slim, sandy-haired girl stepped out from the crowd. She turned, sat on the stool, cheeks flushed pink as the hat was lowered onto her head. The whole school paused as the Sorting Hat thought to itself and muttered to Alice, and then… “Slytherin!”
“You don’t have to—"
might be a problem.”
“He did try to help me when I was in the Manor. He would bring me extra food and heal my wounds when he could. But they did awful things to him there, too. I could hear him scream when they tortured him. It was quite awful… I don’t blame him for being scared.”
“Nah. I’m no good at exploding snap.”
Back at his bed he stuffed his toothbrush away, then opened his trunk and grabbed his robes. Once his pants were on, he drew his curtains back and sat on the end of his bed. Ron emerged then, clad in a towel around his waist. After a moment inside his curtains he returned.
“Nah. He just asked me if I was a guy or a girl,” Harry shrugged.
Draco swallowed his potatoes. “Urquhart needed a seeker. He asked me to come back because no one wanted all of the attention on them because of Slytherin’s bad wrap.”
He was pretty sure he knew, as he turned back to his paper, but he wanted to know what it meant for
,” then pressed it to the exposed skin. The blood came away on the cloth and Harry stood from his stooped position to stare at Draco’s face and neck.
Harry and Hermione both looked up to see Draco standing there, fiddling with his tie. Harry nodded. “Where’s Pansy?”
(See the end of the chapter for

Harry chuckled out loud at that, causing Ron to glance up at him. ‘I’d be happy to oblige ;)’
The trio entered the potions classroom together, taking their seats as they laughed at Ron, who stumbled over a chair. Harry and Hermione slid into a table together, with Ron in front of them. Slughorn was writing on the blackboard at the front, his messy scrawl covering the entire thing. Today’s potion would clearly take a while, and Hermione pulled out her materials and began taking notes. Reluctantly, Harry copied her, taking down his hints and other anecdotes on a piece of parchment. Most of the class did the same as they settled in. Malfoy was the last one to enter the room, plopping down alone in the seat across the aisle from Harry as the bell rang.
“The real trouble was waking him up. I tried to shake him awake but I guess he thought I was Him… he kept pulling away from me. I had to pin his arms down so I could talk without him thrashing.”
like.
“Come on, Harry,” it urged. “Get up.”
The two boys ascended the stairs, lugging their bags over their shoulders and their partially done work in their arms. Ron managed to twist the knob with his elbow, to which Harry gave him a bewildered look. Ron simply shrugged, a smile on his face.
He washed quickly, nausea coming over him at the smell and its implications. He hurried out of the bathroom while Ron hummed to himself, snapping his curtains shut.
“I did!”
Ron cleared his throat. “Well Blaise and Harry are all chummy now,” he joked. “And Draco, well, he’s not so bad once he’s not being a git. Harry would know, wouldn’t you, Harry?”
Although the group of Gryffindors received odd looks from many of the boys, they came over anyways. Goyle lamented over (with Blaise looking thankful to have an excuse to leave) and leaned against the wall. Terry put his phone down and came over as well, sitting next to Neville on his bed. Malfoy closed his book, slid off his bed, and sat cross-legged on the floor next to Dean’s bed. The Hufflepuff boys stopped their conversation to join the rest of the boys, as did the Ravenclaw boys and Theo.
“You still think about it, or was it just because you saw the scars?”
“It’s not. But it’s fun for me!”
Harry was calling out again, flinching in his sleep. “I’m sorry! I’m so sorry!”
The three practically ran across the field to the pitch, where Harry thrust the key into the lock on the broom-shed and let them in. They retrieved their brooms (after Harry and Ron’s were sent up by Mrs. Weasley with their uniforms) and headed out onto the pitch.
“Looking for Draco?” Blaise asked.
Ron smiled. “That’s good. It’s what you needed.”
Beside Ron, Justin mumbled, “
Draco sliced into his arm above and below the mark in desperation—angry red tears and gashes standing out against his porcelain skin. Five more, six more, seven… the back of his head hit the wall as he dropped the razor to the floor, bringing a hand up to his mouth to stifle a sob. His shoulders shook as he cried, hand still over his mouth so that the boys whom were starting to enter the room wouldn’t hear him. An angry, pained scream of a sob tore from his throat and his face scrunched up as he sank to the floor, watching the blood dance its way down the drain. It still flowed from his arm and he watched it from where his head rested on his knees as it left his body. He bit down on his hand to keep quiet… a silencing charm would be useless now, he couldn’t open his mouth to speak without a sound escaping that he wouldn’t want to.
“Now the other one,” Harry pressed. “Come on now.”
‘U don’t know who I am. Remember?’
They walked in relative silence back to the tower that housed their dorms. As they ascended the stairs, Ron paused. Harry and Hermione turned to see his hand lingering on one of the paintings. Fred. He was waving at Ron, who was talking to him in a low voice. Harry and Hermione stepped forward and waved, but let Ron have a moment with his brother. He did this whenever there weren’t too many people using the stairs. Harry did too, sometimes, with Fred, with Lupin and Tonks. Sometimes even Colin.
Ron chuckled. “I’m sure Hermione is looking forward to it.”
Harry turned his attention back to Draco, still sitting against the wall. His façade didn’t last long—barely until Goyle was around the corner. Then it crumbled and tears leaked from his eyes. Harry watched as he drew his knees up to his chest and buried his face in between them. He could hear him crying. Tentatively, Harry stepped back into sight and started towards him.
He stepped into the bathroom for the first time, scanning it. There was a row of sinks on the left hand side, across from a row of six toilet stalls. Straight ahead of Harry were six more stalls, this time for showers. They had tall white doors which matched the small tiles covering the floor. All of the showers were occupied, so Harry figured they were filled by the boys he hadn’t yet seen: Ron, Seamus, Malfoy, Blaise, Terry, and Michael.
“Me too,” said Ron.
If he did, he said nothing about it. Draco tried earnestly to continue his studying, but found it impossible when the boy next to him began talking about Quidditch. Every time he tried to read the next line, he had to go back and read the previous one. The sound of Harry’s voice was utterly distracting, and he all but gave up and listened to their conversation.
Harry shook his head. He looked back at Draco, worrying his bottom lip between his teeth.
“No seriously, what?”
When he sat back down to do homework, Harry smiled at him, as if he didn’t believe he’d really come back. Draco only cocked an eyebrow in mild amusement, before flipping through his textbook until he found the right section.
Ginny and Maya came running out of the changerooms, both taking a long stride and taking off into the air with the others. Harry laughed, released the balls, then followed his team up into the air. He looked around, taking in the team zooming laps around him, warming up. Maya was a fair flyer, although she would definitely need some training to be a beater. She had more of the build of a chaser or a seeker. Harry smiled, wondering if she would take over for him next year.
“We’ll see.”
The table went quiet as Draco stared at him, spluttering. “I… you… you what? No, that’s not possible.”
“Morning, mate. How’d you sleep?”
just a nightmare. That’s all. Surely, he’d forget about it. Surely, he wouldn’t catch on to the million other things going on… Right?
‘Uh… I’ve never really had anyone get to know me before… how do you do that?’
Harry glanced up at the Slytherin table, searching for the familiar blond head. Malfoy sat with Pansy and Blaise, pushing food around his plate. It was virtually untouched. Harry turned back to his friends. Hermione had a textbook in front of her plate, eyes rapidly scanning the words. How she took information in that fast always baffled him. Beside him, Ron had already finished one sandwich and was working on the second one. He looked up at Harry, eyebrows raised.
“I fought him with your wand, Draco.”
Susan and Sue were smiling at the two girls, and then Sue piped up. “More makeup means you have to try some on us!”
The blond scowled. “You’re not my Mother, Potter.”
call out when it hit you.”
“You’re trying to figure me out, and I don’t like it.”
Pansy nodded, face suddenly solemn. “Yeah. Gives him somebody to talk to with anonymity… He’s not the same now as he was before. I guess I shouldn’t have expected him to be. But it’s still a little…”
He smirked. “I have an essay to write. But we can work on it together.”
Of course she’d be a Ravenclaw. Just like her older sister.
Hey everyone! Let me know what you think! The next chapter should be coming very soon! Until next time. -Emma :)
Then Hermione was tugging on his sleeve, telling him it was only an accident, sounding like she was more trying to convince herself than him. Ginny sat up straight behind him, staring back at Ron through Harry’s desk legs. The rest of the class was staring at them, mouths gaping. Harry opened his mouth to speak and his voice came out raspy. “I’m sorry—we—the war—” He looked back to the front and his face softened. “Seamus…”
Chair legs scraped across the floor and everyone’s eyes turned to look at Draco, who marched over to Luna and Ginny, fiddling with the Slytherin ring he wore on his right hand. Both girls stared up at him, confusion evident on their faces. He opened and closed his mouth a few times before the words came tumbling out. “Luna, I’m so sorry about everything that happened at the manor. I’m sorry I couldn’t stop it. I’m—I’m so sorry.” His breathing still hadn’t calmed—it actually seemed to be getting harsher.
Dean nodded. “All the time. Whenever something went wrong or didn’t go as planned… when Ron, Harry, and Hermione escaped…
“Stop being a mother hen. Why are
very like him.”
‘Fuck no! My life would be hell if I was. Especially bc of recent events.’
He thought he saw Ron roll his eyes, but couldn’t be sure. “Because I want to talk to you about what happened last night.”
Harry bit his lip, looking around at the other boys. He noticed that Malfoy, who’d had his head down the entire time, was still not making eye-contact with anyone. He was incredibly reserved, and Harry was not used to it in the slightest. He looked back at Justin. “Are you sure? I don’t want to bother you guys.”
“Huh?”
Draco gave him a look, a mixture of amusement and something Harry couldn’t place. “You don’t have to thank her. She knows.”
“Granger?”
,” he seethed. “Crabbe’s
“O-okay.” The freckles scattered across his face and he picked up the mirror when Harry was done. He took in the small dots covering his nose and cheeks and tilted his head, staring at them with a smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry chuckled. “Yes. It is.”
“That is cute. I wish I had a younger sister.” She stabbed a sausage with her fork and brought it to her mouth. “Did I tell you Draco got a message from his number neighbour.”
“You argued with the hat,” he said, face blank.
‘Okay. I will. Thanks.’
Harry and Ron looked at each other before leaving their desks and heading to the back of the room across from each other. Harry stood against the back wall and watched as his classmates paired up and joined the two lines. Hermione came and stood on his left, across from Pansy, who’d been sitting across the aisle from her with Draco. Draco came and stood on Harry’s right, across from Justin, of all people. To Hermione’s left was Luna, with Ginny. On Draco’s right, was Theo Nott, across from Blaise. Neville was next to Blaise, paired up with Hannah Abbott. Seamus was beside Luna, with Dean across from him. As the rest of the class got into line, Harry took a deep breath, then looked at Ron. He lowered his hands in a ‘calm down’ gesture. Harry nodded, looking away. Although he was nervous, he knew that Ron wasn’t going to hurt him.
“You’re bleeding.”
“Shh.”
“Sorry? What d’ya mean?”
“I tried to calm him down, of course. It took a while, but it worked eventually.” Hermione nodded, chuckling to herself as she finished her toast. “What?”
Harry turned to leave but hesitated as he stepped away from his bed. He shook his head, took a few more steps, then turned again. He stared at Malfoy laying on his stomach, hair blocking his eyes from view. He sighed to himself, stepping closer to the other boy. He stole himself before asking, “Are you okay?” There was no way the other boy didn’t hear him in the stark silence, but he did not give any indication that he had heard Harry. “Malfoy?” Still nothing. “Malfoy. Are you okay?”
Ron hid a snort with a cough as Harry spoke up. “I wouldn’t say that about him.”
Pansy joins the trio for breakfast. Then charms class doesn't go as expected, leading to a confrontation between Goyle and Draco, and Draco and Harry.
Harry laughed. “Yeah. It’s supposed to be.”
“Great, actually! I didn’t think we’d all get on so well. But they’re such nice girls, most of them. Very different personalities, though.”
Harry gasped for air, and Draco could feel his whole body shaking as his own often did after having crucio used on him. He shook his head against the blond’s chest. “I couldn’t save them… I never wanted any of this…”
Draco grinned. “Nah, just the speed of my broom.”
Draco took his wand from Harry’s outstretched hand and whispered, “Thank you.”
“You didn’t even have a wand,” Goyle scoffed.
The class chatted idly as they worked, seventh and eighth years mingling. Houses mingling. Harry grinned down at his scales.
“Hufflepuff!”
“My wand was broken, that’s why I took yours. I fought him with it. But my wand is fixed now, and I just remembered that I have yours today when I saw that you still had your mother’s. I thought you’d like it back.”
to him like he was a normal person… a normal conversation, like he was checking in with a friend… He should’ve just told him to bugger off, but the kid was persistent as fuck, and he had to admit… it was nice. But then he’d blathered and admitted to the trip-jinx and not being able to sleep and
Harry stared down at the grey speech bubble on his screen, then locked his phone. His read receipts were off anyways. “What are the chances?”
“Yeah, well, too bad,” Seamus replied. “Dean?”
Soon McGonagall arrived in the corridor, Filch behind her. They entered as Hermione exited the classroom with a few others who were supporting Professor Flitwick. She wandered over to Harry and stood next to him. “McGonagall is just going to survey the damage, I think.”
“It is?”
he scanned the page to see exactly were in the room everyone was located. On Harry’s left was the door to the stairs, as well as to the bathroom. On his right, the window. On the same wall as him, Wayne slept closest to the door, followed by Michael, Theo, Seamus, himself, Ron, Ernie, and Neville. On the opposite wall, Tony was closest to the door. He was followed by Justin, Terry, Goyle, Malfoy, Blaise, and Dean, who’s bed had a great view of the castle grounds.
“Yeah,” Ron nodded. “Nice guy. Wish Goyle hadn’t come back though.”
‘No. I was still awake. Reading. It was just upsetting to watch.’
“I do. Very much. And I’m glad that you’re feeling better today. Also glad that Draco was able to calm you down last night so you weren’t by yourself.”
“Can I join you?”
“I didn’t know that…”
Harry shuffled the deck, then cut it and dealt them each three cards. He turned the top card up for Justin. An ace of hearts. “Fuck.”
Draco nodded, his body held tensely, but a smile on his face.
Cho!”
Neville, Justin, and Ernie stood off to the side, with Ron standing groggily and Blaise staring from where he’d sat up in bed. They all watched as Draco pushed past them all, reaching out for Harry’s curtains. Ernie grabbed his sleeve, raising his brows. “What do you think you’re doing?”
Hermione whipped back around to face Harry and Ron. “No. Way,” she laughed.
‘No.’
“Potter.”
“It took us six years,” piped up Seamus.
“I find it really interesting. It’s kinda a mix of a bunch of classes, like transfiguration and potions. It teaches you about transmutation, and turning a substance into another form. My professor said it was very similar to a muggle subject called… chemistry, I think. Is that what it’s called?” He looked between Hermione and Harry, who both nodded. “Anyways, I find it fascinating.”
Draco rolled his eyes, but sat, nonetheless. Harry surveyed him. He took in the scratches on his face and neck, and a deeper one in his left knee, tearing through the pantleg of his trousers. He shook his head, getting to work pulling the skin back together and healing the cut on his knee. He pointed his wand at the cloth he’d brought, muttered ‘
“You’re not fine,” he whispered, resting a hand on Draco’s upper back. Draco pushed him off again, turning his head away from whoever was there with him, not aware enough to be able to tell. He couldn’t stop the sobs that tore from his throat, and he shook his head at himself, barely able to draw in a breath. “Draco…”
Ron looked between Harry and Blaise’s sullen faces, and those of his peers. He faked a stretch, yawning loudly. “I think it’s time for bed.”
“Then are you friends?”
The dark-haired girl looked up from her textbook. “Yes?”
exactly?”
“Merlin, Harry…”
Sue looked down the table at him this time. “Why are you taking so many classes? Besides Hermione, you have to be taking the most NEWTs!”
Draco’s eyes scanned the pages with ease, the print blurring together as the characters appeared inside his head. They moved as if in a film, actions and dialogue creating one cohesive unit. A man and a woman were talking, strolling down a path in the middle of the night, only sparse streetlamps illuminating their faces. Their conversation was hushed, their faces barely visible. The woman brushed a piece of hair out of her face, giving the dark-haired man a stern look. He took a step back, grinning in spite of her serious tone. When she stepped towards him, he did not move, amusement glinting in his eyes. “Fred,” the woman said—cried. “Fred!”
A scream pierced the midnight air, cutting through it so completely that all of the boys practically jumped out of their beds. It held pain and terror, causing those awake to search avidly for the source. Many of them headed for Harry’s bed, remembering his warning from before. However, when Harry threw his curtains aside, their faces became shocked. Ron stared at him groggily, brows furrowed. They all turned to look at the only bed with the curtains still drawn. Malfoy.
“In English?”
He was teasing, and Harry couldn’t help but smile. Draco still had this snark to him, and he loved it. “Also means you have to get passed Ginny.”
Hermione smiled up at her. “Because that’s another way to win.”
Harry crouched down and put his hand on Draco’s shoulder. “You did what you had to do… but you aren’t your past.”
“Those are the scars I left… Snape said he got lucky. He could’ve died. He lost so much blood that day…”
“On what?”
“Sorry,” Ron and Hermione both said.
Hermione’s eyes stared right at Harry, but he quickly looked away as Hermione answered. “No. When?”
“Like a rock!”
Harry chuckled. “Whatever you say. Hurry up, Hermione wants to actually have breakfast with us today instead of us running late.”
“Because it’s temporary. You can erase it.”
“No. Just working.”
He scowled at her, then pulled his phone out of his pocket and opened his messages. ‘
Blaise smiled. “Of course. Thanks for helping, Harry.” He held out his hand.
He was silent all day. Whenever Harry saw him in class or in the halls, his head was bowed, no words ever crossing his lips. He never saw him in the Great Hall either, for that matter. Not at breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Not once.
Harry stopped in his tracks. “How’d you know it was me?”
“You made a game out of it?” Harry asked, amused.
Susan looked over at Draco, then the stack of textbooks beside him. “What other classes are you taking, Draco?”
“My fault. I couldn’t stop it!”
“I’m only asking—”
“I told you,” Harry stated as Hermione looked up at the two of them. “I’m not going to mess with him. I think something’s up.”
He and Draco circled each other above the play, waiting for a glimmer of gold to catch their eye. No sooner had Harry thought that, however, than he saw a gold streak near the Gryffindor goalposts. A blur of gold and silver nearby told him that Draco had also seen the snitch and Harry leaned forwards, accelerating until the two were neck-in-neck, both reaching for the golden orb. But it’s fluttering wings deceived them and it cut back underneath the two seekers, heading the other way. Harry did the looping dive that he had been practicing, following the snitch. Draco attempted to copy him, but Harry heard him yelp behind him. He turned to see Draco hanging off of his broom, where he had slid off trying to flip upside-down, his footing having been misplaced. Harry floated closely underneath him, allowing the blond to adjust his hands and push off of Harry’s broom with one foot back onto his own.
“As always, no one is to go into the Forbidden Forest. It is still off limits, as it the Restricted Section of the library, unless you have a signed note from a teacher.
Harry went back to his cereal, snorting as he watched Seamus down the table slap Neville in the face with a sausage. He squinted at them, wondering how on earth he was friends with them. Ironically, of course. He loved them, all of the boy’s he’d spent the last eight years with.
No matter what, though, he hoped that they’d feel better in the morning. When the sunlight came in through the window, the shower would wash away the thoughts of the night before, and the whirlwind of classes could distract them. Maybe then, like Harry, they’d be okay. For a little while.
“Mate.” Seamus let out a breathy laugh. “I don’t think there’s much of a maybe to that.”
“Harry, you’re doing it again.”
Harry remained tense the rest of the day, mind whirling with questions and memories alike. By the end of the day he was overly quiet, causing Ron and Hermione to try and coax conversation out of him. He didn’t reply, and soon after Justin came by, telling the two Gryffindors that he saw Harry with the portraits that day. They stopped pressing him but kept a watchful eye.
“Or both?”
He pointed his fork at her as he chewed. “You know what? I think they will.” He nudged Harry with his elbow. “Gotta do something to keep this one away from my snitch.”
Ron stepped over his broom and pushed off, hovering in the air. “Sounds good. Let’s go!”
Thought that Harry didn’t see the tear that fell onto the page of his book.
’ He stared incredulously at the screen, exiting the chat, then swiping left to delete it. “Bugger.” He sent the same message to his other ‘Number Neighbour,’ hoping for a better turn out.
“Well, seeing as you are the
Harry glanced over at them with a smile, and then his eyes lit up at the first chords of Pompeii by Bastille. He looked back at Dean. “I
“Nothing,” she said, shaking her head.
“Is that why you didn’t shower?”
Something wasn’t right. Something about the way the boy carried himself. About the way he spoke and acted during class. About the way he seemed like a shell of who he used to be, progressively for the last few years.
He scoffed. “Think it’s funny? I thought you’d be the first person to throw one my way.”
Harry and Hermione slid into a pair of desks, and Ron sat in front of them with Dean. Pansy and Blaise walked in and sat at different tables—Pansy across from Ron with Daphne, and Blaise across from Harry, next to an empty desk that was presumably for Malfoy. Blaise took out his materials and spread them on the desk, similar to how Hermione did with hers. Harry glanced around as some seventh years filled the room. Ginny appeared with Luna, and the pair sat behind Harry and Hermione.
reading.”
However, no matter what he said, a part of him that lingered in the back of his mind told him otherwise.
Harry glanced over at Ron, who was listening intently. “Well, sometimes it’s hard if you don’t press down hard enough. Some are more faint than others. You’d usually use them for math, drawing science diagrams, learning other languages…”
“Yeah. I guess I did.” He studied his bed sheets for a moment, picking at a fluff before raising his eyes to meet Draco’s. “Thank you.” Draco nodded, still watching him with worried eyes. “You can go back to bed now.”
Hermione huffed over and plopped down beside Ron, rolling her eyes. “He’s adamant that we duel today. I just… I don’t think some people are ready for that yet. I know it’s in the curriculum, but why do we have to do it so early?”
“First I think you should fix that monstrosity on Mister Malfoy’s head… and then try adding or removing freckles.”
Hermione nodded, sighing as she looked across at Ron, who sat beside Harry. Ron coughed. “You know our names and what we’ve done, maybe… but that doesn’t go for everyone here.”
Pansy furrowed her brows. “Then why was Hermione mad that she had three kings? They’re all different suits. And why did she knock?”
A chorus of goodnights followed him back to his bed, where he drew the curtains. Flopping down on his bed he recalled the events that just happened. His reaction had been almost immediate when he realized it was Harry screaming… as if it was innate to go to him. Like it was second nature. And yet, even though he’d never done it, it didn’t feel wrong or weird.
“Okay fine, geez.” He shut the door, chuckling as he returned to his bed.
“Dammit, Ron!” Harry laughed, rolling his eyes. “Really?”
Draco stared up at him, out of breath and wincing. “I--”
He scoffed, wiping tears off his face. “Why are you here? Why are you so fucking persistent? Why are you even talking to me about this?”
“Nah, don’t be. I couldn’t sleep anyways.”
She smiled. “Good morning.”
Harry glared at him. “Your turn.”
all the time.”
“Yeah.”
Harry’s phone buzzed against his leg and he pulled it out. ‘Him and I have never been friends. But lately he just wants to help and idk what to do. I’m not very trusting… never have been. But like symptoms wise? This is embarrassing. I get a lot of panic attacks and nightmares, and usually one will lead to the other, which sometimes leads to just a full on breakdown, which is even more embarrassing. Flashbacks, too. I just… I get a lot of things that trigger me I guess. And it’s stupid there’s so many things that get to me and I hate it its like it never stops and idk what to do about it I just want it to stop. I jump at everything and I constantly have headaches. Sometimes I snap at people but I don’t mean to. And I try to act normal but sometimes it’s too hard and I just can’t and then ppl get worried about me but I don’t want them too bc I’m a worthless piece of shit and I’ve caused too much damage and I have to stop talking now or you’ll figure out who I am.’
“Uh-huh.”
He rolled his eyes. “I’m
Draco made a face, then shook his head, standing from the chair. “Come on. You should go back to bed. Sorry Ron woke you for this.”
Draco opened his mouth to speak but was cut off by another drawn-out scream. Draco shuddered, knowing too well what caused screams like that. He stared at the other boy for a moment, before turning swiftly and slipping through the split in the curtains.
“Hey,” Harry said, turning to look at him.
that way. All the houses. I mean, Pansy it super outgoing and spunky, but Daphne is quite poised and reserved. Not snobby like I thought she’d be though. Sue is ridiculously funny, and Padma is a born leader.”
Harry frowned as he shut off his phone, replacing it in his pocket. Draco had dodged the question. He knew that he’d let him comfort him last night, but he wasn’t in his right mind then. Something didn’t seem right with him though, and more than just the effects of the war. Even
Hi everyone! Thanks for reading another chapter. I hope you enjoyed it. Definitely let me know what you think! Until next time. - Emma :)
Ron snorted. “Yeah, okay.”
Harry loaded some eggs onto his plate as Ron poured them both some juice. He handed Harry his goblet as he spoke. “So what exactly happened last night?”
“Like what?”
“Okay,” he said, but at the same time, Seamus erupted with a whooping laughter. It reminded Harry somehow of a parrot, but also of a clown you’d see at a circus. Seamus eyed them all, and Dean soon started meowing at him like a kitten. That made Seamus actually laugh, and the whooping became louder. Harry bit the inside of his cheek as he glanced at the door, praying the girls wouldn’t come and bang it down with a noise complaint.
Harry poured himself some Pixie Puffs and immediately tucked in. Hermione looked up at him from her textbook. “Are you feeling better today, Harry?” He glanced up with raised brows. “Well, you weren’t yourself yesterday and Ron told me about last night…”
“I’m trying because you’re hurting. I can tell.”
“Oh, yeah? I wish I could sleep like that every night.”
“Morning, mate. Sleep well?”
The rumbling on the tracks, although no different in reality, resonated differently this time. Loud enough to notice to the average person, but for Harry, swirling in his thoughts and numbing them simultaneously. The foliage of the countryside flew past his window in a whirlwind of green, yet he didn’t really see it. It only reminded him of their screams…
“I guess Seamus and Dean might be right.”
They ate in relative silence, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. Eventually, Harry spoke up, directing his comment at the silent Slytherin. “Good game.”
“I agree,” said Ron. “She was able to email all of the eighth-year prefects our new round schedules right away!”
“Okay…” He pulled out his phone and began scrolling through his school emails. One from Maya, asking about extra Quidditch training drills. Professor McGonagall reminding them about an assignment due date. Assigned reading from potions, which, Harry assumed, was what Blaise was reading.
“Yeah, in only a fraction of the time!”
Instantly, Draco replied. ‘Why?’
“Tell me about it,” he said, fiddling with his tie. “I’ve been having nightmares nearly every night, they just hadn’t been bad enough yet for me to thrash around, I guess. But last night was… bad.”
“It is, and you know it! Him and I were there, thinking we were bringing Potter to Him.”
Ron grinned. “I could always go for a chocolate frog.”
“I bet. It’s nice to see you excited about something again.”
Finally, he let himself be pulled to Harry’s side. Harry could sense the fear and the pain coursing through Draco’s body as he cried violently, sobs wracking his body.
Harry nodded, eyes staring into his lap as he shook his head. “Something doesn’t seem right with him, Blaise.”
Harry just looked at her, only half paying attention. His brain was preoccupied.
Perhaps.’
“No, it’s not magic. There’s a tube on the inside.” Harry twisted the end off, pulling out the tube and handing it across to him.
Harry slammed his book on the table accidentally and cringed. “Nothing.”
Harry dragged a hand over his face, trying not to let his voice come out as exasperated as he felt. “Why? Because you think I’ll figure out what’s up?”
Draco shrugged, not looking up as he spoke in a pretend nonchalant voice. However, it wasn’t very effective, as it broke at the end. “A lot of things are my fault…”
Malfoy was sitting at the Slytherin table with the other Slytherins who had chosen to return. Among them were Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Goyle, Daphne Greengrass, Theodore Nott, Millicent Bullstrode, and Tracey Davis. It seemed to Harry as though the only Slytherin in his year whom had not returned was the one who couldn’t. His gaze strayed to the slumped figure of Malfoy. The boy who had grown up as his rival, yet during the war had turned around and saved Harry’s life. Of course, Harry had done the same in turn… but where that left them, he wasn’t sure.
“Yeah, that one! Say, Dean, have you played it?”
would’ve got up this early.”
Ron closed his eyes, the fact that he had no idea what to do about this anymore evident in his expression. “I know.”
A small smiled graced Draco’s lips as he flicked his wand, light dancing from the tip. “I appreciate it.”
Malfoy’s eyes were back on his book. “No. Trip-jinx.”
Just a quick note!
Pansy and Blaise were watching him now, too. “It’s a muggle card game,” he explained. “Kinda similar to Blackja—nevermind. Basically, you have to collect 31 points of all the same suit. So Justin had an ace, queen, and jack of hearts, which equals 31 because the ace is eleven and the face cards are all ten. Does that make sense?”
“You’re sure.”
“We don’t all have to be best friends,” Blaise said. “But contrary to what you probably think… not all Slytherins are evil.”
“I know, ‘Mione. We’re all dealing with it. But I mean more than that… I don’t know.”
“It’s my fault!” Harry sobbed, barely able to choke out the words. “All my fault. My fault.”
She only shook her head, pulling a handheld mirror out of her bag. “Here.”
“Staring at Draco.”
He set his phone down on the table when the typing bubble appeared. Harry looked up at Hermione, who was flipping through her ancient runes textbook, pointing things out to Ron and explaining their meanings. She glanced up at Harry. “Do you think Draco would want to study Ancient Runes with me later?”
Ron threw his bag over his shoulder. “You think Hermione will take that as an excuse?”
Harry looked back to Ron, who had his wand out in front of them. As he turned back red light shot from it once more, and Harry instinctively yelled, “
behind me,
‘No. I don’t plan to.’
Ten minutes or more he sat like that, water cascading down his body, over his puffy eyes, over his scars, his protruding ribs… He breathed deeply in an attempt to calm himself down.
A thousand images, sounds, and feelings flashed through Harrys brain. From the war, from camping, from the news, from his visions… He swallowed thickly. “Someone should go… see what’s up.”
‘That would give me away…’
Silence for a moment, and then Dean spoke. “She’s doing alright. I don’t think that’s the right position for her though. I reckon next year Ginny’ll move her to seeker.”
Harry shook his head to clear his thoughts, then scooted one seat over from the window. “Yeah, actually. I think I’ll have a chocolate frog.”
“Wow. Never saw that one coming,” Hermione smirked, glancing between Harry and Ron, trying to find the blonde Hufflepuff. “Did you see the drawing Sue’s little sister sent her yesterday morning?”
“Stop what?”
“It’s always you.”
“You mean this one?” Harry glanced back over his shoulder to where the blond held the snitch between his fingers. “It came over my way. Thought you’d like it back.”
“Alright, everyone. I don’t know about you but I’m exhausted. Any of the girls care to come upstairs and see our new dorm with me?” A few girls, mainly Lavender, the Patil twins, and Hannah, followed her right away. A few lingered in small groups downstairs, while a few more trailed after Hermione.
“You haven’t tied your shoes.”
He startled, eyes searching her face before his brain fully processed her question. “Yeah! Yeah. Sorry, just… never mind.”
After all of the boys had introduced themselves, Harry brought out some candies that allowed people to impersonate animals and objects. Harry distinctly remembered whistling steam out of his ears when he was younger.
“I showed last night after practice, thank you very much!”
“What about her?”
“Is he okay? I mean… that was…” Theo trailed off.
“Boys are on the right, girls are on the left. Oh, and also, Prefects, could you please step forward so I may speak with you.” Hermione, Ron, Malfoy, Pansy, Ernie MacMillan, Hannah Abbott, Anthony Goldstein, and Padma Patil stepped forwards. “The eight of you,” she continued, “will continue your duties as normal. I will be sending an email to you all tonight with your schedule. You may still give and take house points, as well as give detentions, but please be reasonable. You are the role models for our new students, and all of the other students who have returned, the same as you. Show them our unity and inter-house cooperation. I am counting on you.”
“I know.”
“It’s your fault, you know,” Goyle said lowly. “It’s your fault he’s dead, Draco.”
“Yeah. We’ve talked about it quite a bit, actually. He’s told me about some of what happened to him during the war and how it came to be. About, uh… different symptoms he’s experiencing.” She raised her brows. “After that fire in charms he kept pushing me away, saying he was fine even though he was crying on the floor and Goyle had just shoved him into the wall and blamed him relentlessly for his friend’s death. Oh, and also telling him that he’d make his life a living hell.”
“Stupid Git! Can’t stop fighting, can you?”
Harry looked at Hermione, who agreed, then he tuned to face Draco. The blond sat very still, watching as Harry pointed his wand at his hair, stared very intently and muttered the spell. Sure enough, when Harry retracted his wand, Draco’s hair had turned the same shade of black as Harry’s own. He gaped, taking in the sight of Draco with dark hair. It definitely didn’t suit him, but it was interesting, nonetheless.
Blaise nodded back towards the staircase. “He’s probably upstairs. See you later.”
“Why?”
“Are you okay?”
“Hang on a minute,” a deep voice said. Goyle sat up from the darkness a few beds over. “Malfoy. Are you growing soft? Do I need to alert the press?”
“Can we play? Harry?”
Harry swallowed thickly. “I knew you were dreaming about being tortured that night because… I heard it. When you were tortured by Voldemort. I could hear you screaming. And I’m not the only one who’s heard you and knows what he did to you.”
“Well, yeah! I was kind of caught up in other thoughts this summer, and was excited just to go back…”
Malfoy rolled onto his back to look at Harry, book resting on his chest. He raised his eyebrows. Harry cleared his throat. “You should sleep.”
he was so stupid! People had never necessarily been a big fan of him, but at least then he was spending more time on his feet than on the floor. Now he was being forced to hear what everyone else had to say about him and his family… he hadn’t chosen that fate! It had chosen him… But he supposed he deserved it… Hadn’t he made some hurtful remarks to others before?
Harry brought his hand to Draco’s back, rubbing slow, gentle circles into the tense muscles. Draco shuddered, but did not object, as he had to Harry’s arm around him. Harry wondered if Draco even realized who was with him right now. Wondered if he thought it was Blaise, or Theo, or anyone but him. It didn’t seem to matter though, because Draco was starting to calm down. He was still shaking and jolting, but his sobs had subsided to mere tears.
Transfiguration was nosier than usual that day, the seventh and eighth years mingling, chatting, and laughing amongst themselves while they worked on a new spell. They’d done similar work before in previous years and were now turning their quills into small animals.
Harry shook his head. ‘
“I wish I could say the same for me,” Harry laughed. “I’m sure we’ll all warm up to each other. It’s just going to take some time.”
He watched Malfoy’s face, where a small smile appeared. He texted back instantly. ‘I’m a guy.’
disappeared from the glowing screen. He opened the message, ‘Hey.’
Ron watched as Harry drew his curtains, blocking him from everyone’s view. He sighed, not knowing what to do to draw Harry out of his own head, out of his spiral of depression and self-hatred. Stuffing his hands in his pockets he wandered over to Draco and Blaise, who were watching him with raised brows. The boys talked for a while, avoiding the topic of Harry and the chaos inside his head.
“Of course!” Harry exclaimed, then lowered his voice to a whisper. “I could’ve killed him… I never meant to really hurt him. Yeah, we never liked each other, but I’d never wish that kind of harm on him.”
“No. What was it of?”
Ron smirked. “Can’t mess with him if he knows it’s you, I guess.”
Harry woke the next morning to Ron shaking him. “Get up, Harry! Hermione was just at the door asking if we were ready to go to breakfast.”
“You should’ve.”
“Right… sorry. That’s Luna Lovegood, at Ravenclaw, right? I know she was part of that group you all formed a few years ago!”
‘Id say… about 4 years.’
“What if he lashes out?” Justin asked, voice shaking.
Ron huffed, shoving another forkful in his mouth. “Fine. As long as we do it together.”
Malfoy wasn’t okay.
“No,” Harry said. “We aren’t friends either. I just don’t hate him.”
Pansy laughed. “Duh.”
Harry snorted, drawing Ron and Hermione’s attention. He just waved them off, shaking his head.
“Yeah,” Harry mumbled, crumbs falling back onto his plate. Blaise looked up at him with a face that said, ‘
He rubbed Harry’s back. “Shh. You’re okay.”
“He’s starting to trust you. Both versions of you.”
“But how?” Ron questioned.
Harry turned his attention away from him, and grabbed something off of one of the platters. The three boys were silent for a moment, the only sounds the sliding of the platters across the coffee table and who he was sure was Ron almost spilling a pitcher of water across from him. He rolled his eyes at his book, but they were mostly hidden by his hair anyways. He peaked up slightly to look around him, and saw Harry’s flushed face turned down at his plate, cutting something in his lap. He was still in his scarlet and gold quidditch sweater and as Draco’s eyes raked his body, he felt his face turning the same shade of red. Quickly, he turned his eyes back to his book, praying that Harry hadn’t noticed.
Pansy huffed, glancing around the room. She smiled as she spotted Blaise coming down the stairs, his wand and a textbook tucked under his arm. “Blaise, have you seen Draco?”
“Er… I want to win one?”
Seamus and Justin were standing by his bed, and Dean was waking Ron by the looks of it. Draco watched with curious eyes as Ron emerged from his curtains, concern etched into the lines of his face.
She chuckled. “Well, it started pretty calm. We were all just doing our own thing. I was reading. Mandy, Pansy, and Daphne were on their phones. I’m pretty sure Hannah was already asleep. But a couple of the girls were levitating pillows, trying to drop them on each other’s heads. It was Kellah and Susan, I believe. All of the sudden, one smacked Pansy right in the face!”
Ron held him tighter, face stony. “It wasn’t your fault, Harry. You know that.”
Hey everyone! Let me know what you thought of this chapter! See you soon! -Emma :)
“Very good, very good! Five points to Slytherin. How about some of the common jinxes and hexes used in duelling… Miss Lovegood?”
“Leave me alone, Potter.”
“Yeah, well it’s taken them eight now,” Ron grumbled.
“It’s nice to
“How do you feel about that?”
Harry turned to Ron, who was trying to turn vinegar to wine. Harry remembered Hermione doing it in sixth year, and laughed when all Ron achieved was creating ripples in the clear liquid. “Go on then,” Ron chided. “You try it.”
After quite a few competitive rounds of 31, Harry, Ron, and Hermione headed to the Great Hall for some lunch. While piling a couple of sandwiches onto his plate, Harry’s phone vibrated in his pocket. He pulled it out and watched as the name
“That’s a matter of opinion.”
Harry glanced down as he tied his tie. “What’re our classes today, d’ya think?”
“I know. When he finally woke up, he jumped back and sat against the wall, kinda like he was when you came in. I don’t think he ever realized that you did, by the way. But he was still super out of it then, staring ahead. Then he just started crying and I… I dunno, Ron. It was scary. I honestly don’t even think he realized that I was there at first. I think he was too lost to recognize it was me. He pushed me away the first time I put my arm around him and kept telling me he was fine… But I dunno… eventually he let me. It was all happening at once and it was confusing…”
Harry bit his lip, wondering how to phrase this
“Me, as well,” said Blaise. “I just… I don’t want to say anything about it and freak either of them out.”
“Oh, then yes. Absolutely.”
Harry bounded up the stairs to the nearly empty dorm. As he entered Malfoy glanced up from his book at him, then continued reading wordlessly. Harry turned his back to him as he searched his trunk for his textbook. Shaking his head, he stood, going to his nightstand instead. It wasn’t there either. But as he turned, brows furrowed, he caught a glimpse of the cover between his nightstand and his bed. “Aha,” he whispered, picking it up. “Found you, you bugger.” Behind him, he thought he heard Malfoy snort, but when he turned around the boy’s face looked exactly the same as it had before.
“It was one night.”
Hey everyone! This was a particularly hard chapter to write for me because of the self-harm. I hope it came across the way I was intending it to. Let me know what you thought of it. Thanks for reading. Until next time, guys. -Emma :)
Ron was clearly in the shower, judging by his clothes and bag sitting on his bed. Seamus tied his shoes, immersed in conversation with Terry beside him. Draco’s bed was made, curtains pulled back, bag gone. Blaise, however, stood across from Harry, pulling his shirt over his head. He glanced up at the Gryffindor and smiled. “Morning, Harry.”
‘Nope. Tired.’
feel bad.”
incredulous looks the boys gave him when he actually did.
‘Hey… I’m really struggling rn. Can I talk to you?’
“I didn’t, but Draco did. Last night. He came over to me in the common room with a piece of parchment and a wicked grin and I just
Draco cleared his throat. “You can use several defensive spells to shield yourself or force objects away. Some common examples are depulso, fianto duri, fumos, and protego. You can also use healing charms and counter spells, such as vulnera senenteur, rennervate, relashio, libera corpus, ferula, expelliarmus, episkey, ennervate, and anapneo.”
Harry stuffed eggs into his mouth the next morning, scrolling through a list of drill ideas Ginny had sent him the night before. Ron sat beside him, immersed in conversation with Hermione while she flipped through the Daily Prophet. They’d only been there for twenty minutes, but Ron had already finished twice the amount that Harry had, but then again, Harry didn’t usually have much of an appetite. Not like he used to.
Harry had mostly been asking the questions back although he already knew the answer, but for this once in particular, he was genuinely curious.
Draco attempted to cover his flinch of surprise by rolling his shoulders. “Don’t be. You did the same for me.”
He replied quickly. ‘Idk exactly, ive never really had anyone try and help me. When I had that really bad nightmare that one boy I told u about came and sat w me. He just had his arm around me and idk if it helped but it was nice to have that physical comfort I guess. I wasnt alone, and it was like for once I wasnt going through it alone. But I pushed him off at first. Something happened earlier today too and I think he wanted to do the same thing but I kept saying I was fine. Idk what it is about him but I cant understand him wanting to be there for me and I was never suppose to take comfort from ppl anyways and I don’t trust many ppl so even tho I wanted it it was hard to take. Does that even make sense?’
Ron glanced up at him as he reached the couches. “Morning mate.”
Harry snorted, but watched as he settled into his plate. Draco wasn’t one to just come and sit with a group of them doing homework when he was asked, or to do it and also act as though it was completely normal. Then it clicked.
“None of this is your fault…”
“Of course. Over Christmas maybe? But sometime for sure!”
Harry shrugged, glancing at his phone again. “I guess it was, er, just something I didn’t catch on to. Do you think that’s how he learned so much about the vanishing cabinet and how to work it?”
“Oh, for fucks sake,” Harry grumbled, rolling out of bed and sliding his glasses onto his face. Ron backed out of his curtains so he could change his bottoms, and then Harry slid them back open, slinging his shirt onto both arms.
Harry frowned, thumbs flying over the keys.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Why?’
“That’s not true! I can’t stand those bogey flavoured beans…”
“Jesus, Hermione! Could’ve said good morning. Ron’s in the shower.”
“Fine. I don’t sleep much anymore. Happy?”
“Exactly.”
‘He looked like he was in so much pain, and I’ve always known him to be so strong… Part of me wanted to shake him and the other half wanted to make sure he was okay.’
“You may not realize it, but that is
“What?”
Jimmy raised his hand and Harry nodded at him. “What days will we be practicing this year?”
A bang erupted from the front of the room, reverberating off of the walls as splinters of wood flew into the air, sparks and miscellaneous debris following it. Immediately, Harry and many of his classmates dropped under their desks. His breathing was harsh, ears ringing, as he stared around for the source, wand clutched tightly in his hand. His head whipped back and forth, searching for the threat. Hermione was clutching his arm, Ron in front of him, eyes blown wide.
‘Are you a guy or a girl?’
“No, I--”
Once he knew, it would make it a lot easier to recognize.
Harry stared into his icy irises. “I will if you answer my question.”
Draco raised his still very-blond eyebrows at Harry. “Do I look that bad?”
Justin turned to the two of them. “Is there something going on between those two?”
.” A snake flew from the end of his wand, landing ten feet away from Draco. It slithered forwards and Draco jumped back with a gasp. He quickly hit the wall with his back, eyes blown wide. Justin only stood still, an eyebrow quirked in a sort of concerned curiosity.
“You mean luck,” said Hermione, nose still buried in her book. Harry snorted as Ron glared at her. She glanced up at him briefly, “You know it's true. Harry could’ve easily beaten you.”
Hermione chuckled as she finished her plate. “Well, it wasn’t the best drawing in the world. She is only six, you know.” Pansy shrugged. “I thought it was really cute. Sue’s face just lit up when she showed us last night after dinner.”
“Oh, ha-ha,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “Very funny.”
Draco sat bolt upright with a gasp, shoving himself back against the wall, staring straight ahead. He was panting, eyes wide. His jaw quivered as his eyes watered, swallowing thickly. He attempted to supress the first one, but quickly broke down in sobs. Startled, but not surprised, Harry slung his arm around the boy’s back. Draco struggled at first, pulling away from the comforting arm. “I’m f-fine! Leave me alone!”
“Yes. Now please leave me alone. I happen to
“That was…”
The boys all stared at each other, contemplating what the two boys had said.
Harry’s laughter boomed as he strode to Ron and Draco, pulling them by the arms. At first, they resisted, but Draco soon gave in. Harry had begun to sing along again, as had all of the other boys who knew the song. His eyes glinted with joy and Draco couldn’t resist him, allowing him to pull him to the center of the room to dance. Ron followed, acting reluctant but truly glad to see Harry happy and having fun. Seamus had pulled Neville and Blaise over, and Michael had brought Terry and a reluctant Theo. Justin joined on his own, dancing beside Dean. Soon, all of the boys were up and moving, except for Goyle, of course, who sat glowering against his headboard.
(See the end of the chapter for
Another scream rang out and a few of them jumped. Dean covered his ears, looking at Harry and Ron, as if begging them to understand his silent plea. Ron turned to them all. “One of us needs to wake him.”
“That’s exactly why. Because he was showing his caring side that not many people get to see. Clearly Goyle never saw it, but I did sometimes. And speaking of him consoling Harry… that patch on his shirt?”
“Not bad. When I fell back asleep, I slept like a rock.”
Harry’s heart clenched again.
“Alright,” said Draco, standing from the table. “I’ll go get my stuff.”
Once they did, Ron stood, whispering that he was going to check on the two of them. He slid the curtains apart gently, stepping halfway inside. He glanced over the scene before him, concerned. Harry had his arm around Draco, who was trembling. ‘Is he okay?’ Ron mouthed.
Draco nodded back, then turned to fly back to his team. He turned and called over his shoulder. “I might have to give it back to you a second time after this match!”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “That’s what I just said.”
“Just… what Draco said to Goyle.”
“Alright. Now, I’d like you to partner up. I won’t partner you this time, because it’s just review, and as I have been told, some of you may not be very comfortable with this so soon after the war. Take your time, get used to it, and if you need to stop, take a few minutes. Off you go.”
After wiping his mouth and flushing the toilet, he surveyed himself in the mirror. His whole body was slender, and he thanked Merlin for the fact that his robes hid the extent of the damage that was so obvious in his pyjamas if you looked for too long. He looked sickly, or was at least getting there. His ribs had become more prominent, face almost gaunt… His eyes narrowed at his reflection in disgust. As if that wasn’t bad enough, the dark bags under his eyes weren’t going anywhere anytime soon. The spark was gone from them, too. He hadn’t seen it in years. As far as he was concerned, they were dead.
back in? Seriously…”
She scrunched her brows, but quickly returned to her work. Harry returned to his conversation, fingers flying over the keys.
Harry laid on his back, twitching and convulsing by the means of invisible hands. His face contorted in pain, his chest heaving for air between the bouts of torture. Briefly, Draco wondered why he was being tortured, but quickly brushed it off. He sat on the edge of Harry’s bed, reached out and shook his arm gently. “Harry, wake up.” The other boy let out another scream. His whole body tensed, and then thrashed against the force attacking it inside his head. Draco shook him harder. “Harry, wake up!” His body shook as he started crying, tears slipping down over his temples as Draco shook him several more times. “It’s not real, Harry! Wake up!”
Behind him, Ginny was checking on Luna, who was shaking a little. Harry swallowed hard. Luna had always been so strong, and nothing seemed to rattle her. But then he heard her whispering to Ginny about how she heard stuff like that a lot, sometimes worse, like screaming, while she was imprisoned in the Malfoy’s cellar.
Harry continued to scroll through his inbox, selecting one from Professor Sprout about needing extra help with mandrakes. Harry cringed, shaking his head at it. Then a banner spanned the top of his screen and his eyes scanned the notification.
She chuckled. “And?”
‘Fine. Uh… do u have a girlfriend?’
Harry pretended to be annoyed at Ron for a minute or so. But truthfully, for the rest of dinner, he kept glancing over to the Slytherin table. He didn’t really know why he was doing so… but he supposed over his school career, that perhaps he’d made a habit of it.
“Okay, okay. I guess it’s only fair, since you’ve both done yours.” Harry opened his messages, brought up a new convo, then typed in his number minus one on the last digit. ‘
Harry had to reread the message several times before he could accept that it was real.
Justin turned to him, pushing a piece of dark hair off of his forehead with annoyance. “Ron. This is our third game and I haven’t won one yet.”
Blaise snorted as Ernie said. “Nothing. Nevermind.”
Harry averted his gaze, silently laughing to himself. He turned to Justin. “Who’s winning?”
“I knew that part… Dean told me.”
Ron flew backwards and fell on his ass, then smirked at Harry. Red light came his way and soon he was laughing uncontrollably. Harry pointed and shot again, but Ron deflected the hex.
“They don’t act like you,” said Ernie, bewildered.
Potions, as the last class of the day, seemed to drag by. Harry sat with Hermione, cutting and weighing while she took care of the cauldron. They sat in relative silence while the rest of the class chatted, both caught up in their own thoughts.
Harry grinned. “Alright now, who’s ready to get started on our first practice, I guess, since we don’t need to do trials. Ginny and I have been working on some new drills and plays for this season, and I have a really good feeling about them.”
Harry stared at him for a moment, open mouthed. The he nodded curtly, eyes boring a hole in his plate.
She crinkled her nose. “But he was only
“I think it was supposed to be a unicorn.”
A million thoughts whirled in Harry’s head. He didn’t know what to do… what to say. Here was his supposed rival, ex-Death Eater, broken boy… in tears against Harry’s side. Needless to say, Harry never thought he’d see the day where this situation arose. But before his eyes flashed images of the sixth year, when Harry had walked in on Draco sobbing in the bathroom. He couldn’t help but wonder how things would have gone if he had consoled him, just
Odd morning encounters, texting, and muggles confusing (interesting?) Ron and Draco.
“I’m reading.”
She looked at him out of the corner of her eye. “No, Harry. Before, I would’ve found it odd, but I mean, look at me. Friends with Pansy freakin Parksinson.” Harry laughed, quirking his head in agreement. “Besides, you two aren’t that different. I think it will be good for you both, actually.”
Hey all, I'm so sorry for disappearing for literal months. My mental health fell through a wormhole or something, I broke up with my boyfriend of two and a half years, was dealing with summer school and barely passing and then fell down the fandom hellhole of a show that really helped pull me out of a dark place. So I'm very grateful for the Bungou Stray Dogs community because I don't know if I'd be functioning without it. I was so stressed guys, I'm 19 and my roots are grey what the hell. But I am back and excited to see where this story goes! As promised, here is an update, and I very much hoped that you enjoy it.
“Boo. Blaise, snap?”
actually like those?”
“Shh,” Harry hissed, checking that Draco hadn’t heard her. He hadn’t, as he was chatting idly with Blaise. “It’s going fine.”
Gingerly, he grabbed the other boy’s chin and tilted his head to the left, exposing the two jagged scrapes on his neck. Draco hissed as Harry pressed the wet cloth to them. “Sorry,” he mumbled back. Again, he healed them quickly with his wand, then put both hands on his jaw to look at his face in the candlelight. Draco looked up at him, his silvery eyes looking into Harry’s as he scanned the cuts and blood on his face. He found a few small cuts on his cheekbone and by his lip and healed them. Then he brought the cloth up and dabbed at the cuts. His pale skin had been stained in other places by the bleeding, and Harry wiped the splotches from his face. As he went to drop his hand he caught sight of a thick, pale scar on his cheek. Without thinking he ran his thumb over it, his knuckles brushing Draco’s skin. “The—”
