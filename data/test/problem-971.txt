"What do you find so funny?" Draco gasped as Potter's breath ghosted over his neck.
"Are you offering to play?" Potter drawled and Draco's face flushed.
"No," Severus answered. "He has never been late for a detention. His classes, yes, but never for a detention."
"Worth protecting!"
"There must be another way," Draco whispered. "Death can't be the only way to break a Horcrux."
If Potter heard him, he didn't react and Draco felt his stomach drop.
Severus pulled his wand and carefully looked into Potter's blank eyes.
"There were more students when the founders started the school than now," Draco announced and Potter looked up from his book in the library with a frown. "That's why there are so many classrooms filled with furniture."
"Snape," Draco replied and Potter looked up sharply.
"Except a Horcrux!"
"We have plans in place," Severus said reluctantly and Draco looked at him. "We just have to get the timing right. This matter with Potter threw us."
"What's she like?" Potter asked.
"Most likely."
"We just have to face the monsoon to get to it," Potter added as his shoulder brushed Draco's.
"Hold him," Severus told him as he uncapped a potion. "Tightly."
"Albus is an old man, Draco." Severus told him with a sad look in his eyes. "He's already been poisoned due to his own folly and he knows there is no cure. He wants his death to be worth something. I am more concerned with how Potter is going to deal with this."
Lupin rose to his feet and Draco expected Potter to give the other man a hug or something but he stayed where he was beside him. Lupin gave them a small smile before leaving. Potter leaned forward on the lounge and cupped the back of his head. Draco didn't know what to do as he sat there. He placed his hand on Potter's back and rubbed it.
Draco looked down and frowned at the complex runes on the page. He knew for a fact that Potter didn't take that class. Not to mention the fact that the book looked too advanced even for him and he was in the sixth-year Runes class.
"I respect him," Severus answered vaguely.
"Harry," Draco uttered. "We'll work something out. Just give us a chance. This is as much a shock to us as you."
Draco rolled the paper up and slipped out the three potions and handed two to Potter. He looked them over before sighing. He broke the seal on the first one and gulped it down. He grimaced at the taste before throwing back the second one.
"Noted," Potter agreed.
"Not much we can do now," Severus conceded. "Albus has played his hand in this, we have no choice now. Potter will be a witness to his death."
Draco lunged forward but he was too slow as Potter hit the ground hard. He winced at the sound and quickly grabbed Potter's shoulder and pushed him onto his back. Potter was out cold as Severus quickly knelt beside him. He touched his fingers to the reddened and bloody scar. Draco turned to look at his godfather then felt his stomach drop at the expression on Severus's pale face.
"He decided that his last act was going to find a Horcrux," Potter said slowly.
Potter pulled him close as he broke off the kiss as his hand slipped down his pants and grabbed him. Draco groaned loudly as his eyes slipped shut as the other man played with him. He could feel himself getting closer and his eyes flicked open and locked with Potter.
"You are dismissed, Mr Malfoy," McGonagall snapped.
He found himself at Severus's door and he knocked loudly.
"The mess of glass around me, says different." Potter said mildly.
"You decided to take a late-night walk to the stream and something happened," Draco grumbled, still half asleep. "Care to explain what?"
"Yes," Draco answered and shifted his legs.
"And take into account that Potter will be there," Draco added and shared a look with his godfather. "I know that you tried to keep him away from seeing this."
Draco frowned at those words, he didn't know much about Potter's home life, beyond what Severus had told him. He was starting to get an inkling that it wasn't a happy one. He must have stood there too long for Potter started to lower the blanket and his eyes became guarded.
"Plenty," Potter replied mildly as he let his hands rest near his sides.
Draco didn't stop him this time as he looked down at the blanket that Potter had left behind. He crouched down and noticed a few books and picked them up. Muggle fiction greeted him and he was sure that this was Potter's new hiding spot. He sat down on the blanket and read through the blurbs on the back of the books in interest. It was a good half an hour before he left the classroom and headed down to the dungeons.
"He's a creepy old man."
"I'm the boy who lived," Potter stated as he gave him a grin and held his hands out. "Cursed more than just by the killing spell."
"No problems," Potter answered.
Potter wasn't in classes for the next few days and Draco grew concerned but his trust in Severus held. Three days after Draco found Potter in that room, he picked up on the soft sounds of a guitar. He smiled with a skip in his step as he headed towards the classroom. He closed the door softly behind him before turning and taking in the sight of Potter sitting there. He had a book open in front of him as he picked away on his guitar.
"The first task is finding a cupboard within Hogwarts," Voldemort told him. "I will provide pictures for you."
Potter paused with the axe in his hand and Draco felt a bolt of fear run through him. There was a glint in the other boy's eyes that he didn't like as he stood there. Potter slammed the axe down and the blade stuck in the stump. Draco pulled back slightly as Potter stalked towards him, there was a raw edge to him as he grabbed the water. He gulped it down in one go before turning around.
"I can do that," Draco said with a smirk. "It's a role I was born to."
Draco intoned and another desk went up.
"You know that she's related to my godfather, Sirius Black." Potter remarked and Draco could feel the tension in his body.
He held the glasses out and Potter sat up on the ground.
Potter yelped as the rock hit him in the shoulder and quickly jumped to his feet. Granger looked around until her eyes locked on him while Draco stalked forward with a sneer on his lips. Potter focused on him with a glare.
Draco tensed in his chair at that answer, that meant that his father thought that he would argue. Lucius was not a man that could hold his temper and Draco always seemed to push the wrong buttons.
"What?" Potter asked.
"Draco!" Severus snapped.
Draco snorted as Potter gave them another wave before disappearing from the room.
Draco snorted and looked Potter over. He looked tired and his face was a little pale but his eyes were sharp. He wondered what type of memory could lay the other boy out so much but he knew that Potter wouldn't tell him.
"What do you want?" Potter spat and Draco reeled back.
Potter's eyes grew distant as Severus frowned in concentration. Draco sat forward in his chair when Potter's hand clenched then he jumped to his feet when blood slowly dribbled down from the scar on his brow. That hadn't happened before as Draco stood close and knew not to interrupt the spell. His eyes were drawn to that blood as it curved down Potter's face. His brow was furrowed then suddenly and without warning. Harry's eyes rolled up.
"No," Potter cut him off. "Why are you here with me? You don't have to be here."
Draco frowned when Potter kept chopping up the wood. Draco just started to gather up the kindling.
"You learn to wash quickly when it's only cold water," Potter said, casually.
The other boy had closed himself off completely as he sat there and Draco just stared.
"Sure," Potter answered without a pause. "Malfoy is just worrying about nothing."
Draco nodded, he knew that. He looked back down at Potter and felt rage pulse through him. Someone had tried to kill him, Severus didn't lighten or exaggerate his words. Someone had come into the school and almost killed the man before him. Instead of feeling happy about that; Draco wanted to hunt down that person and return what had been done to Potter.
Potter nodded and picked up his bag from the floor and walked off without a word. McGonagall's lips thinned even more before turning on Weasley.
"You’re a Horcrux," Severus stated without blunting his words.
Potter gave him a grin that had his stomach flipping.
"Should you be telling me this?"
"I'm not sure," Potter said slowly. "I was hit from behind…then they pulled a bag over my head."
"That would be a reward for him," Draco added with a smirk.
"Where is he?" Severus demanded.
Draco nodded and Severus released him. The taller man glanced at Potter but he looked away from them.
"Really?" Draco asked in surprise. "Who does know about it?"
Potter groaned but didn't look away, Severus pulled back quickly before he slipped his potion pouch from his robes. Potter screwed his eyes shut.
"No," Potter said. "I know that it's safe where it is."
"That's a little melodramatic even for you," Draco drawled.
"What is going on here," Minerva McGonagall exclaimed from the doorway and both boys froze. "Well?"
"I find myself starting to like him," Severus remarked. "Then hating myself for it."
"Yes," Potter groaned and leaned back on the wall and Draco let his hand drop. " He's been doing nothing but 'talk' to me…I don't like this."
"My-ah," Potter stated to say then he closed off completely.
"Potter," Severus warned.
Draco gave him a glare and his fingers twitched on his wand.
"Well," Potter intoned as he leaned back on a desk. "Going off my record so far, whatever is going to happen will be at the end of the school year."
"Enough!" Severus growled and Potter glared at him. "Detention at six tonight with me."
Potter knelt down with the wood and started to stack it up as the Slytherins watched him.
"We don't breed like rabbits," Draco stated with a sneer. "Unless you're a Weasley."
"You have to work a fire up," Potter replied as he went on with his work. "These smaller pieces start a fire."
"Have you had a night without a detention?" Draco asked in interest.
Potter stared at the blood on his hand before slowly looking at Severus and raised an eyebrow.
Draco nodded and placed his hand on Potter's leg and rubbed.
"But-" Draco grunted as Potter's elbow slammed into his stomach.
"I don't think I'll really have one," Potter replied and Draco felt his stomach clench at the words, he could hear the honesty in his words.
"Is that your way of seducing me to your bed?" Draco questioned with a smirk.
"Nothing to say, Potter?" Draco called after the boy.
Draco looked at his godfather in shock.
"I don't care," Potter growled. "The little ferret threw a rock at me!"
"Close," Draco whispered.
Severus gave him a glare and Draco pulled back at that expression.
"Why?" Draco demanded, his temper flaring.
Potter trailed kisses down his neck and Draco groaned at the feeling. The other boy's fingers played with the hair at the base of his neck and he felt a shiver go down his back. He started slightly when Potter slipped his hand under his shirt and touched on his back then chuckled.
Draco looked at him sharply but Potter had never been stupid and Draco nodded sharply. Potter gave him a glance over before nodding and walking away. Draco didn't follow him, he needed a moment to try and muddle through his own thoughts.
Draco found himself in the unused part of the castle that night and wasn't surprised to hear the sound of a guitar. He crept closer and stood next to the slightly open door and listened to the music. There was a different tone to the notes tonight, softer and slower and when Potter started to sing. It had a haunting quality to it as Draco listened. He leaned back on the wall and let the sound run over him.
"When I work it out, Potter." Draco replied as he walked towards the door to the classroom. "I'll let you know."
"The Dark Lord has another task for you," Narcissa said softly.
"Two days ago," Severus said tonelessly. "He was found in one of the classrooms on the third floor. The Headmaster had been concerned when he'd stopped showing up for meals."
"Harry started it!" Weasley snapped. "He threw a punch at me!"
"You know that they won't expel him," Draco grumbled and Blaise looked at him with a smirk.
Draco noticed the way that Potter froze at the word 'godfather' and stayed turned away from him.
"I haven't seen you around lately," Potter commented mildly. "I thought you might have been destroying another bathroom."
"Something like that," Potter stated and crossed his arms over his chest. "Are you done now?"
Severus looked more pale than normal and his hair was in a limp tail at the back of his neck. He limped slightly as he walked back to the lounge and slowly eased himself down. Draco looked him over in concern.
Draco snorted and looked up at Severus.
"Severus-"
"Shut it!" Draco shouted as rage ran through him and he got in Potter's face. "You know nothing!"
Potter looked him over before giving him a small smile and a sharp nod.
"Damn," Draco muttered but he didn't mind as Potter helped him to his feet.
"No."
Draco gave a laugh as Potter grinned at him. Something settling between them.
Draco slipped the device away into his pocket as he settled on the floor beside Potter. He gently rubbed his shoulder as he waited, each whimper that Potter made sent a bolt of concern through him. Potter curled up in a tight ball with his hands clenched around his skull. Draco gently stroked his shoulder until he heard the door open. He looked up when Severus swept into the room and quickly knelt before them.
"No," Potter slurred. "Gone."
"What would you know!" Draco hissed as he jumped off the boulder.
They fell into silence, if the death eaters got the upper hand, everything that Draco knew would end. The fact that Dumbledore knew what was coming gave him some type of hope that he would have plans in place. Draco paused his thoughts and wondered when he'd started to think of it from the other side of the fence. When did, what he'd learned at his father's knee, stop making sense to him. He had a feeling that Potter was to blame for that as well.
"Limiting my choices?" Potter pondered with a smirk.
Draco swallowed the lump in his throat before nodding.
"Give me a reason not to," Potter whispered.
"Here," Draco offered as he held the glasses.
"I need a little time," Potter said, without turning.
"From my understanding it was very abusive," Draco mentioned. "His father was a muggle and his mother a witch. Their marriage was under investigation by the Ministry but nothing could be proven. Until his mother was murdered when he was a teenager."
"No," Draco muttered.
"Snape killed Dumbledore," Potter uttered and tightened his hold briefly. "Was that the plan?"
Draco looked around the bare room, there was nothing of Potter's in the room. His friends had brought nothing down to him.
"I'm sure there's enough room," Draco replied and Potter chuckled.
"Everyone, file into the classroom," McGonagall ordered. "Mr Weasley, go to the hospital wing."
McGonagall's lips thinned even more at that answer before she looked at Draco.
Severus glared down his nose at the girl and she shrunk back. Interestingly, Potter stepped in front of her and met Severus's glare head on.
Draco's shoulders slumped and he walked over to the potion master and out into the hallway. He could feel the rage rolling off the older man and he knew that this wasn't going to go well. Severus held his office door open and Draco slinked past him and into the room.
Severus snorted and Draco turned a glare on his godfather.
He then cursed his godfather and his cunning. He'd set it up that he would take the same detention with Potter.
Draco stepped back sharply from the bed at the thought. At what point had those thoughts changed? At what point did he see Potter differently?
"Possibly," Draco muttered. "Are you done brooding in back rooms?"
"It wasn't just him, Potter." Draco countered. "I saw you after you were attacked in the hospital wing."
"Did something happen?" Draco asked. "Do you want anything?"
"You should have said something," Severus grumbled.
," Potter countered as he flicked his wand.
"There are," Draco replied lamely and Potter's lips twitched up.
"How are you feeling?" Draco asked instead and Potter grimaced.
"Traumatic?" Draco inquired.
"Have you ever wondered why there are so many rooms like this in the castle?" Potter asked into the silence.
Draco looked at Severus with large eyes, the image of that green light still before him. He felt numb and stuck to the spot as the breeze tugged at his hair and clothes. Severus turned away from the window. He could see the pain in his face and eyes before something caught the taller man's attention and he paled.
Potter was gone.
"Was not!" Draco hissed and glanced over at Potter but he was just reading his book.
Potter didn't react and Draco felt for a pulse, it felt rapid and his breathing was a little quick. His skin felt cold as Draco looked around. He would need to use magic to get him back to the cabin. Draco pulled his wand and hesitated before giving it a flick as he cast the floating charm. Potter lifted up in the air limply and Draco quickly led him back to the cabin. He settled him down in front of the fireplace and looked over at the fire that Potter had built up earlier but hadn't lit. He picked up the matches and lit the paper in the middle of the pyramid of wood and it caught quickly.
Potter was slow to open his eyes and look at him. Severus cursed as he pulled his wand. Potter flinched back slightly and Severus paused before reaching out and grasping his chin. Draco could tell that Potter was having problems focusing on them as Severus slipped his glasses off.
"Is this part of the plan?" Potter questioned, his voice hoarse.
"I don't know if I should yell at you or congratulated you," Severus drawled and Draco looked up. "I'm not sure how you got Potter to take the blame for your mistake."
"Lessons…detentions," Potter laughed and tapped a finger on one of the keys. "I think he decides which one, depending on how his day has gone."
"Do you feel sick?" Draco asked as he crept back to him.
He was a head taller than Potter as he glared down into those green eyes. He bunched his fists up and before he knew it, he threw a punch at the smaller man. Potter didn't move out of his way, he just turned with the blow. The fight went out of Draco as he stood there, slightly shaking. Potter turned his face back towards him, he'd split his lip and Draco could see a red mark on his cheek.
!" Draco snapped.
"And here I was thinking that I could help my Slytherin friends," Potter said sarcastically. "In that case, I shall leave so that you can carry on with your evil plan."
"Take care of him, Draco." Severus warned which Draco thought was unnecessary.
"My dragon," Narcissa greeted Draco, when he stepped through the fireplace.
Draco's eyes caught on Potter and Granger sitting together at the Gryffindor table. Weasley sat further down the table with Thomas and Longbottom between them. Granger had a book out on the table and Potter had an odd look on his face. He frowned slightly at that expression and the way that Granger kept tapping the book.
"Draco," Narcissa cut in. "This is the second part of your task."
He touched on one of the marks and Potter shifted slightly. He was only under the sheet and Draco pulled on it slightly. He wasn't sure if he was relieved or not that he was wearing underwear as he uncovered him. Potter blinked his eyes open and looked at him.
Severus wasn't trying to teach Potter to protect his mind but to try and narrow down how Voldemort was getting in. Severus just held his wand up but didn't cast the spell and Draco frowned at that hesitation. His godfather rarely hesitated.
"I am not a child!" Draco yelled and stalked towards him.
"Potter?" Draco questioned and those eyes slowly looked up. "Right there?"
"Severus," Draco warned and his godfather glanced over at him.
"Yes, Professor," Draco answered.
"None of your business, Malfoy." Potter hissed and gathered up his books. "Stay in your own little pureblood world!"
"On your back," Draco whispered and Potter complied.
Draco glanced over at the other boy as he sat back in his seat.
"We have hinted that Harry disappeared when the Death Eaters broke in," Lupin said with a smirk. "From reports, both the Ministry and the Death Eaters are blaming each other. Lucius has put forward that he withdrew you from the school due to it being 'unsecure and unsafe'."
"No," Potter whispered.
Potter quirked a smile and walked past him. Draco's eyes caught on his taunt ass then his eyes wander up…he froze.
"Just report to your father," Voldemort answered. "We are unsure in what kind of state that the cupboard will be in."
"How does he do it?" Draco whispered and Severus lifted an eyebrow. "How does he deal with knowing that his own death is coming?"
Severus's eyes sharpened and Draco carefully blanked his mind.
"What do you want, Malfoy?" Potter questioned. "You were quick to say that I am throwing my life away. Just what do you want?"
"Whoa!" Potter exclaimed and held his hands up. "Didn't mean to startle you."
Draco just snorted and rubbed his back, until Potter held his hand out for the last potion and knocked that one back. Draco slipped the three empty potion vials away as Potter rested his head back on the lounge and closed his eyes. His eyes were drawn to the pale expanse of his throat and how soft the skin would be under his lips and he shifted.
"I just need some time," Potter said hoarsely.
Potter chuckled as he brought his hand back up and curled it around the back of his head. Potter drew him down and Draco met him in a kiss. His hand slipped around his back while Potter still held his wrist. He expected the kiss to be rough but it wasn't as Draco opened his mouth and Potter teased him. They took their time as Draco drew Potter closer until there was no space between them.
"Is that part of the plan?" Potter asked then used the wall to get to his feet.
The rumour of Potter destroying the bathroom spread around the school like wild fire and Draco noticed the way that Potter sat alone at the Gryffindor table. Even Ginny Weasley wasn't talking to him and Draco had observed the looks that Granger and Weasley would shoot Potter and the tense conversations in the hallways. He glanced over when Robert Hellsing walked over to Potter and took a seat next to him without question. They received a few looks as Robert spoke to Potter before standing and leaving.
"What?" Potter questioned and Draco laughed. "Problem?"
"Anything, my Lord." Draco answered as he held back his fear.
"There were more," Potter said so softly that Draco had to strain to hear him. "I had problems remembering, I knew that Zabini had something to do with it but there were others."
Draco stumbled back at that word and felt something cold settle in his stomach. Potter just watched him as he leaned back into the wall behind him. His eyes darted down to the bugle in his pants, he could clearly see that Potter was interested.
Draco glanced down at Potter to see the smile on his lips as he watched the animals. The other man seemed to be at peace even with the earlier revelations. Draco was sure that this was the kind of place that Potter would settle. Strangely enough, Draco could see himself being happy here as well as he touched Potter's hand resting on his thigh.
Draco glanced over to Potter, curled up in the sleeping bag, while he sat close by in the small tent. The images of the rush from the castle still fresh in his mind. Potter following after them like a puppy as the potion still worked in his system. They'd used as many secret passages that they could to stay out of sight. The cries of Dumbledore's death whispering through to them and the confusion on Potter's face, haunting him. Severus had shoved two bags at him and a way to contact him before passing him a portkey. The disarray of the Shrieking Shack the last image of Hogwarts he had before they were whisked away.
Potter just kept walking and Draco got more and more frustrated with each step.
"Take him through to the bedroom," Severus ordered.
Potter froze as Granger swirled around while Snape looked the scene over. Potter's eyes didn’t leave him as they blazed in rage.
"Harry!" Draco snapped and tapped his cheek.
Draco had never heard anyone mention that Potter played as he strummed through another song and Draco watched. He was enthralled by the way that Potter's fingers danced over the strings and his soft voice. He was sure that the music he played was muggle, since he didn't know it. The fact that Potter didn't work out of a book spoke of practise and time with the instrument.
Draco snorted and looked down at the Gryffindor before him. Potter was bruised and bloody and Draco wondered just how far that fight had gone. He'd washed his face but Draco could see the faint bruising, a cut near his hairline and blood on his uniform as he sat against the wall beside one of the windows in the unused classroom. It was one of Potter's current hiding spots and he noticed that he didn't have his guitar with him this time.
"Give me five minutes," Severus answered. "Tell Potter to do the exercises that we practised."
"Should have just cursed you!" Potter fummed and Draco was concerned that it was in real anger.
The other boy slowly removed his hands and squinted up at Draco with red eyes as he rested his head back on the wall behind him. Draco rushed forward as concern bolted through him. Potter was paper white which just made his bloodshot eyes stand out even more. He could tell that it wasn't tears that were making his eyes red as Potter squeezed them closed.
"You didn't think to go to the hospital wing?" Draco questioned as he crossed his arms over his chest.
Potted pulled back before bringing the axe down with the wood still attached to the end onto the stump and it made a loud crack. He lifted the blade with the wood still attached and brought it down again and it split in two.
Draco shivered at Potter's words and looked at him carefully.
"We have a holiday home in the woods like this," Draco admitted and Potter chuckled.
"My father was a stag Animagus," Potter remarked. "Can't say that I've looked at them the same since."
"Then what happened?" Potter pressed. "I felt like I was going to pass out. Everything kept slipping away."
"Of course, mother." Draco said with a smile.
"Potter?" Draco repeated as he crouched down before him. "What happened?"
Potter finished the song and blinked his eyes open. His left eye was swollen but his green eyes were still sharp.
"What is it mother?" Draco questioned.
"Your godfather?" Potter questioned as he took a seat on the blanket.
"Coming, Severus?" Bellatrix questioned.
"So, the rain will last four," Potter commented with that lopsided smile of his.
"Point me, Harry Potter." Draco intoned and watched the wand spin before it focused.
"Is he normally late?" Draco questioned.
"What is going on?" Potter inquired.
Potter got a faraway look on his face and Draco wished that he could take back the words. The other boy turned away and looked into the fire. Draco waited him out but he knew that he wasn't going to say any more.
Severus looked away and Draco felt his stomach drop.
"You are close with him?" Potter inquired.
Potter nodded and his eyes snapped back into focus as he hugged himself. Draco wanted to wrap his arms around him and offer some type of comfort but could tell that he would have refused it. Draco just rubbed his arm, offering what he could.
"Do you trust Snape?" Potter questioned, a while later.
Draco sucked in a breath when he felt and saw the cold look in his eyes. He hadn't realised last night when he felt the skin of Potter's back and the way his fingers had skipped slightly.
"Draco," Severus said and Draco looked back at him. "This is not over even when Albus is gone. The fight will still go on."
"Just after Christmas," Draco uttered.
"This is concerning, Potter." Severus remarked as he slipped out a couple of other potions.
"Not well," Potter muttered. "I haven't gone too far down the stream. Does it get deeper?"
"Fifty points from Gryffindor for fighting, Mr Weasley." McGonagall stated and Weasley opened his mouth. "And a week of detentions."
"Harry," Draco gasped and fell to his knees before him.
They sat there for a while just watching the rain as it fell softly around them. Each absorbed in their own thoughts. Both of their lives now changed forever.
"Reality settling in?" Potter questioned softly.
"Do you have something to say, Ms Granger?" McGonagall's voice whipped out.
Draco sneered as he noticed Severus coming around the corner.
"I feel like I should give you a detention for not applying this thinking to your studies," Severus drawled and Draco laughed again.
"Until everything happens," Draco clarified. "Just remember that we have our roles to play, Harry."
"I don't think that has anything to do with you," Potter said coldly and Draco pulled back at those words.
"Is this something I should be concerned with?" Severus requested with a sigh.
"You could say that," Draco answered and looked around. "Care to share that blanket?"
"Why did you take up Legilimency with Severus?" Draco asked, instead of touching on Dumbledore's mortally.
will be concerned to hear about my behaviour."
"Not sure," Draco said with a shrug. "After Lunch, probably. How are you, Severus?"
Draco stood up and Severus embraced him in a hug and held him tight for a second before releasing him. His dark eyes looked him over before giving him a small smile.
Draco paused when he realised that he was on his feet and shouting at the seated wizard. Potter just looked at him mildly. He was sure that Potter had found himself in his situation more than once since school started.
"I agreed to an unbreakable vow," Severus intoned. "My feelings are irrelevant."
"Potter?"
"Then what?"
"He likes pain," Draco remarked as he crossed his arms over his chest.
"Albus left a message," Severus announced, looking pale. "He took Potter somewhere, he left a note to say that they will be back for the plan to go ahead. That Potter will have his cloak and wants him to be at the tower."
"And why would I do that?" Draco questioned with a smirk that he knew would push at Potter's temper.
Draco looked at Potter sharply but he wasn't looking at him but at Lupin and an awkward silence fell. Lupin leaned forward in his chair and Draco shifted uncomfortably.
Draco's eyes caught on Harry Potter sitting alone at a desk in the corner of the library in interest. Lately he'd noticed that the Gryffindor had been on his own more than with his two sidekicks since school had started a week ago. The rumour of Granger and Weasley being found in a compromising position in a classroom had spread through the school quickly. Draco had noticed the way that Potter had placed himself away from the other two since then. He walked down one of the aisles and looked through the gap in the shelf and books at the other boy.
Severus quickly stepped into the hallway and closed the door behind him.
Voldemort stepped forward and Draco held his ground. The man before him could have him screaming on the floor with an uttered word and Draco knew that his father would do nothing to stop him. He quickly blanked his thoughts as he stood there and Voldemort's lips curled up in a parody of a smile.
"Draco," Narcissa started to say then stopped and looked away.
Draco blushed and Severus cocked his head to the side.
Potter quirked a smile but Draco hadn't been lying. The other boy looked pale with dark smudges under his eyes and had a few beads of sweat on his brow. His eyes were dull and Draco knew that he was still a little confused from the lingering effects of the poison, not that Potter would show that weakness.
"Potter?" Draco said softly.
"What?" Potter uttered and wiped his forehead. "Ah."
"What would you know!" Draco snapped.
It was the first day back from holidays and Draco was happy to see the castle. He looked around the Great Hall as he caught up with friends then frowned when he didn't see Potter at the Gryffindor table. He felt a bolt of concern run through him at that. Did something happen? Did they move Potter somewhere else? He found that he couldn't pay attention through dinner and he quickly left his friends behind. He went for a walk around the classrooms that Potter used to hide in.
They would deal with the problem of the Horcrux tomorrow.
Potter looked up at them with large eyes and Draco felt fear run through him. Something was wrong with that look and his movements.
"I won't ask," Severus drawled. "I'm not sure that I need to know the details."
"Mother liked to go there for Christmas," Draco continued. "She used to deck it out herself and we would all sit around the table for Christmas dinner."
"Did you want to join him, Ms Granger?" Severus offered, sweetly.
Draco blushed deeply and looked at his godfather with large eyes. He hadn't meant to say that as Severus looked at him in shocked silence.
"This is the third time that you have not completed your set work," McGonagall snapped and Potter shrugged a shoulder. "Ten points from Gryffindor and detention tonight where you can complete your work."
Draco snorted and stepped up to the front door and grabbed the handle. He felt the wards pass over him before the door opened under his hand. He stepped in and could tell that the place hadn't been used for a while by the dust and the musty smell.
Draco started and almost dropped the book in his hand when a knock sounded at the front door. He grabbed his wand and crept forward.
"No," Severus snapped.
"Would you rather that I say that I wanted to fuck you?" Draco stated mildly.
"Okay," Draco agreed. "You just tell me what I need to do."
"You," Potter stated and looked at him. "If anyone else knew they didn't say anything."
Severus cursed and Draco looked at his godfather as he pulled a hand through his hair roughly. He could tell that he was agitated and on edge.
"Then why are there less magical children now?" Potter questioned.
Potter groaned before blinking his eyes open. There was a glazed look to his eyes and Draco wasn't sure if he was aware of what was going on around him.
Potter blinked his eyes open and looked at him and Draco shivered at his expression.
"Fine," Draco snapped and jumped to his feet. "Have it your way, Potter!"
"You can work out his writing," Potter grumbled and handed it over. "I can only pick out his insults on my assignments."
Potter was soon covered in sweat as he worked through the wheel burrow before picking up the handles and going back to the pile. Draco frowned at the fact that Potter didn't want him to help. He'd been happy to take the blame for his little temper tantrum but wouldn't take his offer of help.
"Ron-" Granger went to say.
"I am so sorry, my dragon." Narcissa whispered. "This is not the life that I would have picked for you."
Draco and Severus pulled him to his feet and Potter staggered into Severus. The taller man grabbed his shoulder tightly as he cursed.
"Yes," Narcissa answered with a hard look in her eyes. "He thought that it would be better that I speak with you."
"I'm going to have a shower," Draco grumbled.
"That is all, Draco." Voldemort purred. "Please me in this and you will do well within my ranks."
"Yes," Potter replied as he set his guitar aside and picked the book up. "Arrived this morning."
Draco rushed out of the room and down the hall to Severus's rooms and knocked loudly. Severus appeared quickly and looked at him with a frown.
"He can't make it to the hospital wing," Draco pointed out. "Or the tower."
"No," Severus answered and looked them over. "What else happened?"
"Yeah, Granger isn't good enough to fight over," Vincent added. "I know I wouldn't want to get into those pants."
Draco helped Potter through to the bedroom and eased him down onto the side of the bed. Potter just sat there and looked like he wasn't sure where he was.
"At least I'm still trying!"
"We will have to proceed as planned," Severus stated.
"What were you doing with Dumbledore?"
"Potter knows how to cook," Draco replied with a smirk.
Potter paused and looked at him with an eyebrow raised.
"Draco?" Severus called out.
"Aiming high," Potter commented, mildly.
"One burrow should do," Hagrid said with a grin. "Ya know where I 'eep them."
"No," Draco replied. "Just different."
"So, it wasn't a complete bust?" Potter asked with an odd note in his voice.
"Don't do something stupid," Severus warned.
"I doubt I would have been able to hide for long," Potter replied. "How did you find me?"
"I'll be sure to jump in the way of the killing curse then," Potter drawled. "And save you the trouble of hunting me down."
Draco soon learned that Potter could cook and had nightmares at night. Draco didn't ask about what and Potter didn't remark on the fact that they would wake curled up around the other or the fact that Draco would wake up with a hard on. Draco tried not to stare when Potter would chop up the wood for the fire and Potter wouldn't call him out when he caught him at it. They quickly learned which topics to broach and which ones to let go and he was surprised to find how easily they fell into living together.
"Are you going to use it against him?"
"Enjoy your castle then, Severus." Bellatrix cackled before running after the others.
Draco woke slowly the next morning to the soft sounds of birds and Potter's arm over him. He shifted back slightly as he glanced over his shoulder but the other boy was still out. Severus had warned him that he would sleep for a while and when he woke that he had to take a potion to flush out the rest of the poison. Draco just took in the feel of the arm over him and the warmth of the body behind him as he relaxed back. He had no idea what his life held now, but he had played his cards. Done what needed to be done and put his trust in Severus.
Draco frowned when Potter limped towards the door.
Draco could feel his temper flaring at those words then realised that's what Potter wanted. He'd been around him long enough to know when Potter was trying to stoke his temper.
He looked up briefly before curling his hand around him and slid his hand up his cock then down and Draco was coming hard. When he came back to himself, he noticed Potter watching him again and he shifted. The man had made him come twice and Draco was sure that he hadn't come at all. Draco sat up and closed the distance between them. He slipped his hand into his underwear and grabbed him.
"You could say that."
Draco placed the back of his hand to Potter's forehead, ignoring the dried blood. He felt a little hot as the other man gave him an exasperated look.
Draco turned back the piano and started on the song that he'd been learning and Potter added his instrument to the mix. He didn't have the music before him but he proved that he didn't need it as Draco struggled through. He would stop and start as he read the sheet music and Potter would strum along. He found it was easier as Potter played and he picked up the song quickly. They continued on like that for the next hour before Draco stopped.
Potter barked a laugh and the tension that had been there since Severus had left, broke. Potter reached out and placed his hand on Draco's arm and rubbed it.
"Call…" Potter tried to say but trailed off as he grabbed his head.
There were scratch and bite marks on Potter's pale skin as he struggled to draw in breath. Severus grabbed the boy's chin and turned his head towards them. Draco shuttered at the blank look in his eyes.
"What happened?" Potter whispered behind him.
"What do you think of Dumbledore?" Draco asked in interest. "You have worked with him a long time."
"Potter pulled his wand on me," Draco whined and Potter's face flushed.
Potter quirked a smile and dropped his arms and stepped forward. Draco was surprised when Potter grabbed him in a tight hug. Draco just wrapped his arms around the shorter man and took in the feel and smell of him. He had no idea where this was going, nor did he care.
"I better be going," Lupin announced and gave Draco a nod. "Take care."
"Thank you for the chance, my Lord." Draco replied as he nodded his head.
"You have spent the last two weeks looking up students' family trees?" Potter said in disbelief.
"More like less self-council before he says something," Severus answered. "We need to work out how the Dark Lord is getting through to him without eye contact."
Draco's fingers skipped over the keys of the piano as the notes sang out and he smiled. With a little fixing up, and dragging Severus in to help him, the piano was playable again. Even with his lack of skill. He paused and glanced over when he heard a guitar to see Potter standing there. He stopped playing as Potter settled on a desk and plucked out a few cords. He hadn't expected to see the other boy.
"If you wish to think of yourself that way, Potter." Severus said lightly and looked him over. "How do you feel?"
Once he was sure that the fire wasn't going to go out. He rushed to the bedroom and pulled the blankets off the bed. He touched on Potter clothes and noticed that they were wet as well as cold. He paused briefly before stripping him down to his underwear and hung up his clothes. Potter started to shiver as Draco added another log to the fire. He settled the blankets around him but his shaking didn't subside. He looked at the curse scar and could see that it was still bleeding and frowned. Something had happened.
"I can do that," Potter said with a smirk.
"Harry," Draco whispered.
"In fact, Potter." Draco grumbled. "Don't mention this again."
Draco shivered and pulled back to look at Potter and the smirk on his lips.
No answer came back to him and he cursed. He walked around the cabin to where they kept the wood without any luck. He slipped back into the cabin and grabbed his wand and a torch. He walked back out the door and held the wand on his palm.
Draco is due to start his sixth year at Hogwarts with two tasks from the Dark Lord over his head. One to find a certain cupboard and the other to become a murderer. That is just the start of his problems when he starts to see his life and Harry Potter in a different light. AU Year 6. Slash DM/HP
"Nothing," Potter answered and pulled back.
"Your second task is to kill Albus Dumbledore by the end of the school year," Narcissa uttered.
Draco sighed and made his way over to the sleeping bag and gently nudged Potter over and curled along his back. They only had the one but it was large enough for both of them as he placed an arm over Potter's chest and took in the sounds of his soft breathing. So much had happened so quickly and Draco's mind was still trying to process it as he slipped into exhausted sleep.
"Yes," Severus answered. "Can I have a look?"
"I don't know, Draco."
Draco hoped that he never covered himself with that kind of coldness. Like his father and others, a protection against his own feelings.
Potter whirled on them with a hard look in his eyes. Draco felt that coldness in his stomach at the expression on his face.
"And detention for the next month and two hundred points from Gryffindor," McGonagall added. "What are you doing here, Mr Malfoy? Were you responsible for this as well?"
"Malfoy."
Potter slowly blinked his eyes open and tried to focus on them as Draco stepped forward. He crouched down and Potter didn't react as he grabbed his arm.
"And Severus would be," Draco said with a smirk. "I bet that is killing him."
Potter's chuckle followed him out of the door.
Draco frowned in confusion and looked at his godfather. He had known the man all his life and yet he didn't know him. The rebirth of Voldemort had changed all their lives.
Potter watched him until he disappeared around the corner before looking back down at his book.
Draco was dragging his feet as he made his way down the hallway in Malfoy manor. He wouldn't say he was being childish, even if his father would see it that way, he just didn't want to hurry to where he had to be. He paused outside of his father's office before knocking.
Draco grabbed Potter's arms as Severus pulled his wand and uttered a spell before tipping the potion in his hand onto Potter's bare chest and down his body. It sizzled as it hit and spread out across his exposed skin. Potter yelled out and struggled against his hold. Severus quickly dropped the vial and grabbed his legs to hold him still as he screamed. The sound went right through Draco while Severus cringed. Potter then slumped as his screams cut off as the potion was fully absorbed into his skin.
Snape gave them both a look over before turning on his heels and stalked away. Draco gave the two Gryffindors a sneer before following after his godfather. That part of the plan had worked. He could feel Potter's eyes burning into his back and hopped that he didn't take it personally.
"When the founders started this school," Draco expanded. "There were more students back then than there are now."
Draco stepped in close and Potter looked up at him.
"What?" Potter questioned.
," Potter retorted, his eyes flashing as he stood toe to toe with Severus.
"Snape," Potter whispered, his voice hoarse.
"Run, Draco." Severus told him as Potter looked up at them in confusion. "For they will be after Potter's blood."
"Is that so," Severus said with a smirk as he leaned forward in his chair and looked at him. "No other reason?"
"If you keep those down," Draco said mildly as Potter paled. "You are to take this one."
"Harry," Draco gasped and Potter quickly pulled back.
Potter's lips quirked up in a twisted smile that had a shiver going down his back.
Potter just nodded against him and that gave Draco an indicator of how he felt. He shared a look with Severus as they made their way down the hallway slowly. Potter was hurting and badly even with the pain potion. Severus tapped his wand against a door and pushed it open to find a guest room.
"We have enough food to last about three days," Draco said with a sigh.
"Fine," Potter said and turned.
"His childhood?" Harry questioned with an odd look in his eyes.
"About cupboards," Potter said with that smirk. "Sadly, a lot. About this cupboard, nothing."
"Not yet," Severus answered. "I need you to keep an eye on Potter…not that that will be much of a problem for you."
"Then feel free to leave," Potter remarked as his hands clenched.
Potter turned back to him with a frown.
Potter had skill with both the instrument and his voice as he moved from haunting song to slow ballads. It was very different to the last time Draco had heard him and a frown stole across his face. When the music paused, he waited for it to continue. He started when the door beside him opened and Potter stepped out.
"Sure," Potter countered sarcastically and rolled onto his back. "You could just get in the bed."
"So, you have just stopped caring?" Draco hissed in anger. "That's a bit selfish."
"Um," Draco stuttered and could feel his face heating up.
"So that's it then," Draco uttered. "You are just going to stop fighting?"
"Draco?" Severus questioned.
"God, I hate that man." Potter groaned as he held his head between his knees.
Potter placed the guitar on the blanket and Draco reached for it. When Potter didn't stop him, he picked it up and looked it over. He didn't know much about the instrument but it looked like it was high quality.
Draco quickly got up from his seat and took his mother in a hug. It wasn't her fault; his father had set them on this road.
"They aren't the only ones," Potter purred and kissed the side of his neck.
Potter turned on the log to face him.
Draco could feel his face heating as Severus gave him a look that had him blushing. Draco was saved from replying when chopping started up from outside and they looked over that way.
"Quickly!" Severus hissed and appeared before him. "Potter, stop! We have to go, now!"
"Maybe one," Potter admitted, dryly. "Snape has already commented that I'm heading towards the Weasley twin's record. I'm sure that Fred and George won't be happy with that news."
"I'm getting Severus," Draco announced as he stood.
Draco snorted and glanced at him and Potter gave him a smile.
Draco felt cold as he sat on a large boulder at the edge of the Great Lake. His mother's words running through his head. He was supposed to find that cupboard so that he could let death eaters into the school. He was then supposed to kill Albus Dumbledore and if he failed then Severus Snape would finish the job. He just felt cold at the thought, even with his godfather's support.
Draco wandered over to the mantle and looked down at the other boy. Potter looked up at him and Draco gave him a smile as he took in his shaggy, mess of hair plastered to his head.
"You can go back to your common room," Severus told him as he laid a hand on his shoulder. "I'll take care of this."
"Bloody fish," Potter cursed.
Draco stepped back to give him room and didn't miss the wince as Potter settled on his feet. He reached out and touched his fingers to the other boy's arm and Potter started. Green eyes locked with his but he didn't pull away.
Whispers started up around the hall at Weasley's words. Draco looked at Potter sharply but he just crossed his arms over his chest and said nothing. He hadn't realised how much Potter had fallen out with his friends as he focused on Granger. The girl had her lips thinned and was glaring at her boyfriend.
"What about wizarding bands?" Draco questioned and Potter grimaced.
"He does have guardians?" Draco questioned.
"I started fighting against it then the pain started," Potter whispered. "I think it was the Dark Lord using the scar. Next thing I remember is waking up here. How did I end up here?"
Lupin looked between them as Potter gave him a matching smirk.
Potter trailed off again and looked down at the floor.
Severus let the threat hang as Potter glared at him.
He looked up to see amused green eyes watching him and a smile on Potter's face. The shorter boy stepped closer and held out his hand.
"I am more concerned with how having that Horcrux in his mind could have contaminated him," Severus countered. "You must admit that his behaviour has changed since the Dark Lord tried to take over his mind."
Potter stepped back sharply as his face paled. His hand dropped and Draco held his eyes.
"Really?"
"No," Harry muttered and rubbed his arm. "I can understand that upbringing."
"No," Potter snapped as he threw more wood into the burrow.
"You shave," Potter commented as his fingers wandered.
Severus sighed and ran a hand over his limp hair and Draco tensed.
Lupin nodded and Draco had to give him credit for not pushing.
"I'm happy here," Potter replied evenly. "Beds are too soft."
"Have you run out of detentions?" Draco remarked as he picked up his dropped book and slipped his wand away.
Draco looked down at Potter as Severus stepped around the bed and grabbed his shoulder. His grip was tight as he shook his shoulder slightly.
"Can we make it at seven?" Potter replied as he sat back in his seat. "I have a detention with Snape at six."
"Of course," Draco intoned with a sniff. "The grand plan."
"You threw a rock at me!"
"What else aren't you telling me?" Severus questioned.
"But Harry didn't do anything!" Granger defended.
"Then have my way with you," Draco added.
"Not well," Draco answered. "But I can carry a tune and you don't seem to know wizarding music."
"That sounds very sentimental for a Malfoy," Potter drawled.
Draco stepped closer as Potter slowly pulled himself to his feet. He was sure that he would have a black eye while blood dripped down his chin from his nose. From the slightly hunched way that he stood, Weasley had landed some good blows.
"What?" Draco repeated.
"I don't have much of a choice now do I, Snape?" Potter bit back.
Potter looked him over slowly and Draco tried not to shift on his feet at the look. He shouldn't have given him so much information. Potter was always good at making connections between seemingly unrelated information.
"You scared me!" Draco hissed.
"Did you get in another fight?" Draco groaned and Potter looked over to him.
"Should we head back?" Draco asked. "Those deer have made me hungry."
Potter quirked up his lips in a lopsided smile and the tension drained from the room. Severus nodded and Potter set himself on his feet as he faced him. There was a determined look on his face.
Weasley soon had Potter pinned to the ground and the other boy was just trying to deflect the blows. Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan jumped forward and pulled Weasley off Potter just as McGonagall appeared.
"You don't know anything!" Draco spat then stalked off.
"And using that cupboard is going to be any different!"
It was late afternoon when Draco came across Potter. He was sitting on a log near where the stream widened into a large lake. Potter looked over at him as Draco stepped closer and patted the log next to him. Draco gave him a sneer before settling down. He started slightly when Potter wrapped his arm around his waist and pulled him close. Draco rested against his side while he took in the sight of the lake.
"That is a disturbing thought," Draco drawled with a shiver.
Lupin sighed and looked at them from his armchair.
"We do not fight in the hallways, Mr Potter." McGonagall snapped. "Go to the Headmaster."
Draco laughed as Potter gave him a lopsided grin.
Draco gathered up the last of the wood as Potter drank down the rest of the water. His eyes kept being draw back to him as the other boy walked up to Hagrid's door and knocked. The giant answered and Potter handed over the jug and glasses. They spoke quietly as Draco watched them from a distance and he didn't miss the way that Hagrid's eyes would dart over to him. Potter turned away and walked back towards him with smooth steps.
"You're welcome," Severus replied as he sat back in his seat.
"What is going on here?" McGonagall demanded.
"A lot," Draco replied and Potter's arm shifted slightly but he didn't remove it. "What do you remember?"
"Did he say where he took Potter?" Draco asked, once Severus got a hold of himself.
"I haven't found the cupboard yet," Draco said quickly. "Hogwarts is full of rooms full of furniture-"
Draco paused when he heard the soft sounds of a guitar. He was in a part of castle that wasn't used often and there were no classrooms in this wing. He hadn't expected to come across anyone and that's why he was there. He crept closer to the sound and noticed a door open further along the hall and the soft sounds of singing. He knew it was a male by the tone as he settled with his back to the wall beside the open door and listened.
"He wasn't there," Draco defended. "Where is he?"
"Regardless of what happens," Severus said, his voice soft. "I'm proud of you."
Draco snarled and pulled Potter forward before slamming him back again. Potter grunted at the impact but didn't fight back. Draco let him go before swinging his fist into Potter's face. The boy went down hard on the ground and Draco stood above him and sneered. He pulled his foot back then stopped. Instead, he crouched down and picked up Potter's glasses. The other boy looked up at him with slightly out of focus eyes.
"Your mother contacted me," Severus said softly. "She's missing you."
"I brought some newspapers as well," Lupin remarked. "Minerva has taken over the school for now but I don't think that will last. Your father, Draco, is already pushing for Severus to step into the Headmaster's position, which may work better for us."
"Talk to Severus," Narcissa told him with conviction in her voice. "He will explain it all."
"Severus said that there is a cabin to the north," Draco told him as Potter settled next to him on the ground in the slight shelter that the tent flap gave them.
"Sure," Potter declared. "You can cook this time."
"I could feel him trying to pick up the memories," Potter confessed with an odd tone to his voice.
"What would you know!" Draco yelled again as he stalked towards Potter.
"That the best you can do?" Draco countered.
"Potter," Filch ordered without looking at the other boy. "Show the prince what he'll be doing. I'll be back in one hour."
Draco stormed out of the room, not even glancing back. Draco had cooled down by the time that he arrived outside of Severus's rooms. He knocked on the door loudly before tapping his foot as he waited. Severus opened the door and looked him over before pushing the door further open.
"Watch it, Potter!" Draco called after him but the other boy didn't turn.
"He said that it was my fault," Potter whispered hoarsely. "That his father was dead and it was my fault. I remember that clearly."
Draco picked up the rock off the ground and threw it as hard as he could at the mirror. He watched in satisfaction as it shattered as the rock impacted it. He picked up the next rock and threw it at the next mirror with the same result. Every time, he saw his father's face, moments before the mirror shattered. He felt gratified as he destroyed each panel of glass until he was surrounded broken shards. He panted in breaths as he felt tears on his face but he didn't care.
"That is still a while off, Draco." Severus reminded him. "Christmas break is in a couple of weeks."
"You going?" Potter questioned and clenched his arm around him.
The person could carry a tune as he plucked away on the guitar before falling silent as he continued to strum along to a song that Draco didn't know. The person paused slightly before starting another song, showing skill as he made his way through the melody. Draco peered around the door and froze when he spotted Potter sitting there. The other boy was focused on the instrument in his hands as the sound floated on the air.
Draco turned his eyes on the other man and held back in the shiver as he looked into those inhuman red eyes. He bowed as he'd been taught and Voldemort chuckled.
"Harry!" Granger squeaked. "You heard what McGonagall said!"
"Yes!" Draco exclaimed smugly.
"What do you want, Potter?" Draco blurted out.
"Were Potter's friends told?" Draco asked in interest.
Draco fell silent then noticed how low the sun sat. Filch hadn't come back after an hour.
Weasley growled and threw the first punch as Potter slipped back and Granger yelled out. Weasley shrugged off his girlfriend and launched himself at Potter and they went down in a tangle of limbs as students jeered and shouted. Draco winced as Weasley landed a few blows due to his greater weight and height even if Potter got a few good hits in himself.
Everything is going to plan. Potter is to take potion one and two and if he keeps them down, give him potion three. Stay safe.'
Draco bit back on what he wanted to say to that, he could feel the heat from the other boy. He wrapped an arm around his shoulders and Potter tensed before relaxing.
"I'm going to check with the Headmaster," Severus told him. "If he turns up, keep him here."
"I stole it from my cousin," Potter remarked as he sat back against the wall, under the window. "Had to get it fixed up but it's a good brand. A waste on him, my uncle wasn't impressed when Dudley just shoved it in the back room."
"I suppose," Potter said slowly. "There is one piano on the second floor that is probably better than the others."
The other boy froze when he saw him before a hard look came across his face and he continued down the hall.
"That's sounding more like a Malfoy," Potter said with a smile.
"But you weren't at the same time?"
Potter gave him a look that Draco hadn't seen before. He had a soft look in his eyes and a smile on his lips. Draco did the only thing that he could at that look. He leaned forward and captured his lips in a kiss. Potter slipped his hand into his hair while he deepened the kiss. Draco could tell that he'd had practise as their tongues tangled while Draco tasted the man.
Draco woke with a start then frowned when he didn't find Potter in the bed. He reached out but the other side was cold and it was still dark out. He pulled himself from the bed and snagged up his coat, the days may be getting warm but the nights were still cool. He walked into the main room then felt fear settle in his stomach when he didn't find Potter there either. Draco checked the bathroom before he headed to the front door. He shivered as he looked out at the dark forest and didn't know where to start.
Draco cringed when Potter threw a punch and hit Blaise straight on and the boy went down. Yelling sounded on the air as Potter stood there as Blaise stared up at him with blood drippling down his face. The boy then yelled and lunched himself at Potter and the Gryffindor slipped to the side easily. Draco smirked at that, as Potter showed talent as he fended off the taller boy.
"I suppose," Potter consented. "I still think like a muggle."
Draco held still as Potter's eyes slipped out of focus while Severus cast the spell. They held locked in that stare for a while before Potter blinked his eyes. Severus lowered his wand with a frown. Potter pushed his glasses up and rubbed his eyes. Draco stood and filled a glass of water for him. He held it out and Potter took it from his hand with a nod and a soft look.
"Ha!" Potter laughed and folded his arms behind his head. "I'm not some fourteen-year-old girl."
Draco felt his heart clench at the words and wished that Potter would look up. He let him go at the pace he needed to.
Draco grabbed one of Potter's arms as Severus grabbed the other. The other boy was out of it even if his eyes were open and they had him laid out on his back. Severus placed his fingers at his throat as Draco pushed his robe to the side then paused.
His thoughts then turned another way as he recalled Potter's words and how he'd found him. He didn't want to think about what would have happened if he hadn't woken when he had. Potter shifted behind him and muttered in his sleep. The other man didn't sleep well. Draco had worked that out within the first couple of nights they'd slept in the same space.
Potter just shrugged and they fell into silence for a while.
"I don't want to talk about it," Potter answered and Severus's expression darkened.
"Just to make sure that a cat wasn't being murdered," Draco retorted.
Potter gave them a wave over his shoulder as he walked towards the door.
Potter laughed and Draco felt himself relaxing as the frustrations of trying to get the cupboard to work, drained away. He looked Potter over as he looked at the rune work above the door of the cupboard and the writing. The other boy was looking better and he didn't see any odd bruises.
"Oh," Potter muttered and Draco could tell that he was slipping back to sleep. "Later?'
"He's a little out of it," Draco reported.
Potter gave him such a smirk that Draco shifted on his feet.
"Have you seen a piano in your travels through these junk rooms?" Draco questioned when Potter stopped.
Potter was focused on the book in front of him and had a few more around him. He had always thought of Granger as the smart one of that trio and to see Potter bent over a book had him frowning. The other boy had changed since the end of his fifth year and Draco had a feeling that he was dealing with more than what others knew. Draco crept closer along the stacks and tried to see what Potter was looking at but he couldn't see the titles on the books and he gave up.
"Draco," Severus called and he looked at his godfather. "We have a mission to complete."
"You need to be very careful," Severus warned as he tightened his grip on his shoulder. "Are you sure that you can do this Draco? It may involve Potter as well."
"I thought it would help," Potter sighed and turned on the bench seat to look at him head on. "I broke into the restricted area and read through the books there. Snape says that the barrier that I've placed is better but I don't have the mind for that type of magic. That didn't sit right with me."
Draco tried to relax as another part of him took notice of the situation while Potter's breathing evened out. He touched on the hand on his stomach and could feel the roughness and the calluses on his knuckles. He grabbed a hold of his reactions as he settled back and closed his eyes and just tried to sleep.
"Tired," Severus replied. "The last month has not been kind."
"What are we doing?" Potter uttered, defeat in his voice.
"He probably saved you from being expelled," Severus told him.
"Yes," Draco answered. "He was camped out on the seventh floor, west wing."
"He doesn't normally come back," Potter replied. "You can go."
He landed smoothly and turned on the other boy as he clenched his hands into fists.
"A moment of your time?" Severus requested and Draco nodded.
"No," Potter replied and sat up. "He doesn't know about it."
"You know something is coming," Draco blurted out then blushed when Potter raised an eyebrow.
Potter didn't stop as he slammed the door behind him as he stormed out of the room. Draco ran across the room and grabbed the doorhandle then cursed. It was locked and by the time that Draco had worked out the spell.
"What are you talking about, Malfoy?"
Draco let him go like he'd been burned and took a step back. There was a cold look in Potter's eyes as he looked at him and Draco frowned. The other boy could be so hot and cold lately.
"It’s the hair," Potter grumbled as he reached up to his dark hair. "It's a curse, I tell you."
"Where did Albus take him?" Severus muttered as he pushed Potter's shirt up and cursed. "Damn you, Albus."
"Shame that he's still here," Blaise uttered under his breath.
Draco gave his godfather a smile as the older man focused on the book in his hands. Severus then shut it and cursed when he looked at the cover.
"If you want to think of it that way," Potter said as he stood up.
Potter pulled back to look up at him and Draco gave him a soft smile.
"I think you should leave," Potter said with steel in his voice.
"Go," Potter groaned as he grabbed his head in both hands as he slipped further down to the floor. "Oh, god."
"Then what?"
"Just thinking," Draco said as he got to his feet. "I'll just pack these clothes away."
Potter groaned as they helped him sit up against the cupboard. He tilted his head back as he closed his eyes.
The confusion lifted from the other boy and Potter looked him over.
Potter just lifted his head and rested it back on the stone wall and Draco paused.
"I know, Draco." Potter sighed and ran a hand through his hair.
"Bloody Potter," Severus swore. "He stole this from the restricted section. That means that I'll have to face Madam Pince when I return it."
"If that makes you feel better about what happened," Potter stated and Lupin reeled back. "Either way, he's still dead."
"Of course, my Lord." Lucius said quickly as Draco straightened.
"I don't know," Draco admitted. "I still haven't been able to find that cupboard and I only have until the end of the school year, Severus!"
Potter snorted, "Yeah, okay."
"Don't think that's possible," Potter grumbled.
"Do it," Potter snapped and Severus raised his wand.
"Saying what?" Draco asked as he tensed.
"Potter mustn't have caught anything," Draco explained. "He always comes back in a mood when he doesn't get anything."
Draco looked at Potter but he wasn't looking at him and Draco had no choice but to leave the room. Leave the mess that he'd made for Potter to clean up.
"Your second task will be explained at a later date," Voldemort continued.
"He's still the same," Draco remarked with conviction.
"Come, Draco." Narcissa encouraged. "Let's go down to the kitchen and get something to eat with our tea."
"Snape," Potter greeted. "Thank you for the potions."
"That might have been what snapped me out of it," Potter conceded before he looked up at him.
"Potter!" Draco yelped as Severus snorted.
Draco woke slowly to the feeling of Potter curled along his back and their legs tangled together. The fire had burnt down and soft light was filtering into the room as Draco took in the feeling of his naked skin against Potter's. It was a little jarring since he was used to some type of clothing between them. What they had done last night came back to him and he felt himself harden and yet felt satisfied at the same time.
Draco nodded and picked up the first bag that Lupin had dropped off. They were mostly full of clothes and he was sure that Lupin had filled up the kitchen as well. Potter picked up the other bag and pawed through it until he came to the potion pouch with a letter wrapped around it that Severus had added.
"Potter," Draco said in a rush.
Severus snorted as the front door opened and Potter came in with his arms full of wood. He paused when he saw Severus and his look darkened but so did Severus's. Draco knew that they didn't like the other but they had proved that they could work together.
Potter trailed off and Draco couldn't resist the temptation to reach out and grab his arm. Potter slowly looked up and Draco sucked in a breath at the raw look in his eyes.
Draco noticed Potter's eyes taking him in as well as he slinked towards him with smooth steps. He felt hunger run through him at that grace as Potter stopped before him. He then reached out and cupped him and Draco tensed.
"No," Potter answered for her.
"Why am I not surprised."
"Thinking of learning?" Draco asked as he perched himself on one of the desks. "I would think improving your marks would be time better spent."
"Can you do it?" Draco uttered.
He slowly looked up into those green eyes watching him, an unreadable expression on his face. He never thought he would get to this point and he realised that Potter still had his hand on him as he slowly played with his balls. Draco panted harshly as he rolled onto his back. Potter gave him a smirk that had him twitching and slowly hardening again. No one else could get him hard so quick as Potter fingers played with him as much as they did on his guitar.
"Very well," Potter said softly. "I suppose I better teach you to cook then."
"I recognized Zabini's voice," Potter said into the silence. "There were others, I tried to fight back. I managed to get the bag off my head but they were wearing masks and they knew what they were doing. They knew where to hit to make it count. They wanted to draw it out…"
Draco slowed his steps and turned the corner to see Weasley's red face as he stood toe to toe with Potter. Granger was behind Weasley and had a hand around his wrist, holding him back as she hissed something.
Draco growled and grabbed the other boy's shirt and swung him around before slamming his back into a tree. He got into Potter's face, the other boy not even fighting back.
Potter looked at him for a second before grinning and taking his hand.
"Potter!" Severus snapped. "Focus!"
"Fuzzy?" Potter asked, vaguely.
"Just keep walking," Potter said, his voice far away. "Felt like a tug, pulling on me."
Draco nodded in agreement and stepped closer. Potter just eyed him off. They hadn't been this close since Draco had kissed him. He settled in front of Potter and felt that urge again. The other boy just watched him in interest, his last move had been met with distain. He let his hand rest on Potter's arm again and when he wasn't shrugged off, he ran his hand down.
"Potter hasn't said," Severus told him. "He won't tell us and we don't think that it was a student staying here."
"Very well," Severus relented. "I should be going. Be careful, both of you. If anything changes, you know how to contact me."
"This is your fault!" Draco hissed.
"I'll start a fire," Potter offered. "If you want to take a shower first. I'm assuming there is a spell for hot water?"
Draco pulled further back to take in the man next to him. Potter had a far-away look in his eyes.
Draco braced himself on his elbows as he kissed the man below him while one of Potter's hands wandered down his back and he shivered. He pulled back just far enough to kiss down Potter's neck and he turned his head to the side as he panted loudly. The only other sound was the fire crackling then Potter slipped his hand into his underwear and grabbed him. Draco groaned loudly and bucked forward as he nibbled up Potter's neck.
"Potter!" Draco yelped.
McGonagall turned away just as Granger leaned over and hissed something to Potter. The boy just glanced at her before picking up a muggle pen and drawing in his notebook.
Draco relaxed as he grabbed the door handle and opened it up to see Severus on the other side. He grinned as he stood to the side and the older man stepped in and drew him into a hug. He hugged his godfather back before Severus pushed him to arm's length and looked him over.
Draco turned to the other boy as rage flooded through him then he noticed the smile on his lips. Potter was teasing him and Draco tried to control his temper.
He felt Severus's eyes on his back until he turned a corner and pulled his wand. He flicked it as he cast a spell and followed the direction that it was pulling him. That was where the others had failed. When Potter wanted to be alone, he wasn't always alone. Draco frowned as the spell took him to the seventh floor of the castle then to the west wing. He could tell that this part of the castle hadn't been used in a very long time as his feet kicked up dust. He looked down but couldn't see any other footsteps besides his own.
Draco chuckled and looked at him in amusement. Potter laid a hand on his leg and Draco didn't look too far into that. Potter leaned into him and rubbed his eyes with his other hand.
"Ha!" Draco laughed and stepped closer. "And why would I do that!"
Draco felt cold as he cupped Potter's face gently then ran his hand down his neck. He could feel the pulse under his fingers as he looked into Potter's face. They had only just started something and now…now he didn't know what was going to happen. Potter suddenly groaned and his eyes flicked open. Draco didn't remove his hand as those green eyes focused on him.
"What would be my fault this time?" Potter asked, tonelessly.
Draco's eyes locked with Potter's with a frown.
"A little," Potter admitted.
Draco looked at the clock for the third time and even Severus looked on edge.
"You know nothing!" Draco snarled as he got in the other boy's face.
"Faggot," Weasley uttered under his breath. "This is all your bloody fault!"
"Do you mind if I have a shower first then?"
"He's a good man," Draco said in his godfather's defence. "And can scare the shit out of you at the same time."
"You're welcome to it," Potter offered with a grin.
"She thinks that you are wasting your time," Weasley replied as he stood. "And so do I, he is gone, Harry."
Severus chuckled and gave him a soft look.
"You were the one to punch me," Potter retorted. "What was that about?"
"Felt odd, like I was in two places at once," Potter replied and slowly sat up and placed his back to the lounge. "Then there was another presence in my mind before everything went black. Did I pass out?"
Draco hesitated before he opened the door and stepped into the room. There would have been a time when that hesitation wasn't there. That time had passed as he schooled his face carefully. He blanked his thoughts, as his godfather had taught him, and faced his father and his guest.
"What's your problem!" Potter snapped.
"Just place them in the box near the door," Potter ordered and Draco bristled then relaxed.
"Sirius Black," Severus replied, reluctantly. "His godfather was killed."
"What are you talking about?" Severus demanded.
Hagrid glanced over at Draco before heading back inside to cottage. Draco stepped over to the table and poured water into the two glasses and held one up for Potter, whom just ignored him.
Draco chuckled, that sounded like his godfather. Potter turned back around on the bench and started to play the piano again and Draco just watched him. He could feel a calm come over him even when he hit the wrong keys. Potter would just keep going before starting over again. He seemed to have a natural talent for music. Potter let the last note of the song hang before folding up the book and closed the lid of the piano. He held the book out to Draco and he took it in his hand.
Draco looked back at Potter to see that he had his head tilted back and his eyes closed. He knew he wasn't asleep as he rested there. That fact alone gave him an idea of how he felt. Potter would go out of his way to not show a weakness.
"Sorry," Draco offered to Blaise on the other side of the table.
"It drew you in here," Potter countered but Draco could tell that he'd hit a nerve.
"Magical homes," Potter muttered. "Could lead to anywhere."
He started when Potter grabbed his wrist, stopping him. His eyes shot up to his green ones. Draco couldn't read the expression on his face.
"Like killing myself?" Potter asked coldly. "For that would solve a lot of problems!"
"Potter looked like he'd been in another fight," Draco reported. "He's limping and wouldn't go to the hospital wing."
Potter nodded sharply and walked out of the room without another word.
"Yes," Potter answered. "But I think he was having as much trouble pulling them up as I was remembering them. I could feel his frustration as I was trying to block him…"
Draco paused at the use of his first name before giving him a grin and did just that.
Draco startled and looked over to see Potter standing there looking out over the lake. It would be so easy to blame the Gryffindor for all his problems. It was his fault that the madman was back and he now faced the task of killing a man. Of letting in murders into the school for an unknown task. He shivered and hugged himself at the thought. Potter looked at him then, his eyes running over him.
"Potter," Severus snapped.
"Harry," Lupin tried to say.
Severus sighed and looked Draco over.
"Making yourself at home, Potter?"
Draco was heading back to the common room when he heard a slight shuffle and he stopped. No one should be around, since it was past curfew. He looked around the hall and noticed a door of one of the classrooms open. He crept closer but didn't hear anything as he peered around the doorframe and looked into the room. He paused when he saw someone crouched down, against the wall, with their hands over their heads. Draco stepped closer then recognised the student.
"Tell me what happened?" Draco pushed.
Draco quickly grabbed it and swung it around them before he pushed Potter back. He could feel his hot breaths on his back and the slight hitch. Potter wrapped an arm around his chest and pulled him closer as Bellatrix and three other Death Eaters appeared. Severus quickly turned and shifted his weight to cover their movements.
"Is father out?" Draco asked carefully.
"You know him," Severus sighed. "Probably better than his friends at the moment."
"What do we do?" Draco questioned and gently touched his fingers to Potter's face, his skin felt cold.
"Guinea pig," Potter remarked and Severus quirked his lips up.
"I don't know," Severus admitted as he sat back on his heels. "The Dark Lord can't be permanently killed while a Horcrux is still intact."
"Spend a lot of time around cupboards, Potter."
"You were poisoned," Draco told him. "You have to take another potion for that."
Draco stepped to the side and waved a hand towards the bathroom.
Draco walked over to the box and placed the wood into it with the others before turning around. He froze when he saw Potter with his shirt pulled up as he used the fabric to wipe his face down. His eyes lingered on the hard muscles of Potter's chest and stomach on show. He pulled his eyes away and walked back towards him and picked up more of the slivers of wood. Potter finished the last piece of wood and brought the axe down on the stump.
"I need you to aim higher," Draco hissed.
Draco felt cold flood through him as Blaise looked back over at the Gryffindor table. Potter looked up then narrowed his eyes as Blaise smirked then gave him an air kiss. Potter's face tightened as Granger looked up then she said something to him, drawing his attention back. Draco felt that coldness spread as he connected the dots.
"Legilimency," Severus answered. "I would assume that I touched on a memory that was buried deep in Potter's mind. Would you care to enlighten me on what that was?"
"Not me," Potter added tiredly and looked down at the potions. "What did you give me?"
"There are more empty rooms than purebloods at this school," Draco whispered.
"Without a
"How long were you planning on hiding in here?" Draco questioned and Potter's eyes grew guarded.
"He's stopped caring about everything," Severus remarked as he rubbed his chin. "He doesn't care about his friends, school work or the rules. Everything, except what he did for you."
"So," Potter remarked as he walked around the cupboard. "Did you finally find a closet to come out of?"
McGonagall looked at the pair over the top of her glasses while Draco watched the interaction in interest. McGonagall moved on with the class and Draco noted the way that Potter didn't pay the least bit of attention as he just drew in his notebook. Draco just filed it away as another puzzle piece in his mind as he focused on the class.
"He has problems," Greg muttered from beside him. "I wonder what happened to break up that trio?"
Potter just stared at him as Draco curled his hand around his wrist and slipped his wand out of his hand. Potter just let it go and Draco placed both of their wands on a table close by.
"Yes," Severus answered. "He was a Death Eater and it looks like he had second thoughts. He died before the end of the last war. This gives us a clue about where the real Horcrux could be."
"I wasn't protecting him," Potter tried to explain. "It's just that…I'm not used to adults believing me and…I wasn't sure myself what had happened…Snape…"
Draco stalked forward as rage ran through him but it wasn't for the boy in front of him. Potter held his wand out but Draco could see that he was reluctant to use it.
"What are you doing here, Potter?" Severus demanded.
Draco tuned the two boys out as their descriptions got more graphic then noticed the way that Blaise looked at Potter. There was a glint in his eyes and Draco felt a cold stone settle in his stomach.
"I got bored," Potter said, casually.
Draco snorted and looked at Potter in amusement.
"Just get under the covers, Draco."
"Keeping an eye on you," Draco replied and Potter's eyes flicked to him.
"Get his shirt off," Severus ordered as he quickly unbuckled Potter's belt.
"My mother?" Draco questioned and Potter nodded. "She's hard to explain. To me, she is loving and we spent a lot of time together when I was growing up. To others, she can be cold and lives up to the image of the Malfoy name."
Potter chuckled and Draco found himself smiling despite the water drippling down his back. They made their way in silence for the next hour until a cabin caught their attention. It sat alone on a slight hill with the trees set further back. The grass and wildflowers surrounded the clearing and Draco was sure that a spell kept them under control. It was made from stone with a chimney and only looked small from the outside. He knew if it was a magical home that it could be deceiving of what was inside.
Potter tightened his hold before he stepped back and Draco reluctantly let him go. Those green eyes looked him over before a mask seemed to fall into place and he nodded.
"Yes, my Lord."
"We'll have a look at it and may have to move it," Severus said softly as he rubbed his face. "I'll talk to Albus tomorrow."
"That doesn't begin to cover it," Potter commented as he ran his hand down the side of the wooden cabinet. "So, what's the deal with this? Is it a doorway to Narnia?"
"How's your mother doing?" Draco asked softly and Blaise's eyes flicked to him.
Draco took that all in and the way that Potter seemed more focused on the book on the table then what was going on around him. Draco's eyes then caught on Severus but his godfather was also focused on Potter. He frowned at that fact before Severus's eyes flicked to him. Draco gave him a small smile and Severus's eyes darkened and the smile slipped. He knew the reason and he wasn't looking forward to the detention later in the day.
Potter stepped back sharply as his face drained of colour which just made the blood swiped across his forehead stand out even more. Draco took a step closer and Potter's eyes locked on him.
Severus paused and looked at him with a frown.
"Harry," Draco snapped and tapped his face. "Potter!"
"Mr Malfoy," Severus called with a hard look in his eyes. "My office, now!"
"Hunting," Draco answered. "He knows his stuff when it comes to berries and setting traps."
"You know that there is a bed," Draco sniffed as he crossed his arms over his chest.
"Of course, Professor." Potter replied mildly. "I'm sure that my
"Shove it," Draco snapped. "You better know how to use that compass."
Potter stalked off towards the restricted section and placed the book back before leaving the library.
"You wanted to restart these lessons. If you could learn to shield your mind, Potter." Severus snapped. "I wouldn't have to!"
Weasley gave him one last glare before stalking off and Draco tried to calm his rapidly beating heart.
Draco waited for his mother to continue but she just looked at the table. He clenched his hand around hers, drawing her attention back to him. He could see the sadness and something else in her eyes.
"That you would cover for him," Draco hissed and slipped his hands down to Potter's hips.
Severus opened his mouth then paused and Potter gave him a nod. He walked out of the room and returned quickly with a gold locket on a chain. He held it out to Severus and the potion master took it in his hand. He frowned as he opened it up then something cleared from his face.
"Right," Severus said. "Let's get you sitting up."
"When will he be back?" Severus questioned.
"I ordered in a book," Potter said as he nodded to the book. "Some of what I know transfers over."
Draco and Severus looked at the cupboard before Draco looked back down at his book. The spell should have worked and yet it hadn't. Severus lowered his wand with a frown and looked down at the book in confusion. They both started when the door banged open and Potter walked in. He paused when he saw both of them before closing the door firmly behind him.
"Severus would have said something if he knew who did it," Draco told him and Potter cocked his head to the side.
"You'll be the death of me," Draco whispered and kissed that bare shoulder again.
"Do you want help?" Potter offered and Draco almost tripped. "What's the matter, Malfoy? Too straight forward for you?"
Draco carefully stepped back and Potter let him. The other boy crossed his arms over his chest and stared at the floor.
"No," Draco snapped as he crossed his arms over his chest. "Why are you even here?"
"Where is he?" Severus asked with a frown.
Draco looked away and felt sick in the pit of his stomach. Before the school year was out; one of them would be responsible for Albus Dumbledore's death. He selfishly hoped that it wasn't him.
"What are your plans, Draco?" Severus asked as he placed his drink down on the table.
"I'll see you tomorrow then?" Potter asked as he crossed his arms over his chest.
"Well," Severus replied and looked him over. "Something on your mind?"
"Sorry, Professor." Granger said quickly.
He set off with his torch out as he scanned the forest and followed his wand. He frowned when it led him towards the stream and his concern rose. Then his light fell on a dark-haired figure sprawled out on the ground. Draco dashed forward with fear in his gut.
Potter nodded and locked eyes with Severus and the man whispered the spell. Draco reached out and grabbed Potter's hand, needing something in that moment. Slowly Potter's eyes came back into focus and Draco tightened his hold on his hand. The other boy looked down at their joined hands before flicking his eyes up to Draco.
"Even if it comes down to cursing Potter or using your wand to kill?"
"What about Severus?" Draco broached.
"You don't even take Runes as a class," Draco pointed out.
"About time," Filch sneered. "Lose your way, Malfoy?"
"See ya then," The boy said with a smile and walked off.
"What are you talking about?" Draco defended.
"Go on," Potter encouraged. "That was barely a punch."
They were so close that Draco could easily close the distance between them and he felt his mouth go dry. He had been here before and with Potter's mostly naked body against his own skin, he was finding it hard to hold back as his body responded.
"Ha!" Draco barked. "I can understand that feeling."
Draco stepped back into the bedroom and placed his wand back down. He quickly dressed before stepping back out. He walked over to the lounge and sat down next to Potter. Their shoulders brushing each other. Lupin looked them over but Potter just leaned back next to him, without a word.
Severus stepped over to the fireplace and stepped through with a flare of floo powder. Draco didn't have to wait long before the potion master stepped back through. Draco tensed at the expression on his godfather's face.
Severus nodded slowly.
Potter placed his finger on the wood and tapped it with the blade and it stuck. He then hit the wood down with the blade still dug in a couple of times and it split into a small slice. He then worked the larger piece of wood down into ten pieces. He held one out to Draco, it was only a little wider than his wand.
"I get that feeling," Potter replied evenly.
"Just what am I Snape?"
"Severus," Draco warned.
"Why did you protect him?" Draco demanded. "It was his father's own fault for getting killed!"
"Scared?" Potter taunted and Draco groaned.
"And when you did?"
He was instantly awake as he grabbed his wand off the bedside table. He jumped out of the bed and rushed to the door and ripped it open. Just to see Remus Lupin seated next to Potter as they both glanced over at him from the chairs in the main room. He sighed in relief and lowered his wand. He blushed when he realised that he was only in his underwear and Potter gave him a smirk.
Severus and Draco stared at Potter and he glanced up at them.
"No, Potter." Draco cut in. "Why do you keep fighting and getting detentions. Disappearing and you won't even talk about what happened at the end of the Christmas break!"
"How's Severus?" Draco asked.
"It does give us leverage with your father," Lupin added.
Severus nodded sharply as the pain potion worked and Potter relaxed back into the wall. Draco was sure that if they left him there that Potter would fall asleep that way.
Severus looked at him head on and Draco met his eyes. Now that the words were out there, he wasn't taking them back.
"Just as long as it doesn't end in a death," Potter remarked.
Potter didn't release him as he captured one of his legs with his own and they settled back into the sleeping bag.
"Stop deflecting!"
"As long as she doesn't catch you."
"I hope so," Draco replied, dryly.
"How much product do you use?" Potter whispered as his fingers slipped down and touched on his neck.
Surprisingly, Potter followed Snape's directions and that hinted to Draco how he felt. Severus placed his wand tip to Potter's left temple and the boy flinched before relaxing back.
"Your turn, Potter." Draco stated.
"Did Severus give you any potions for Potter?" Draco asked and Lupin frowned.
When he heard the muffled sounds of a guitar, he knew that he was on the right track. He slipped his wand away and crept closer to where he could hear the music coming from. He placed his hand on the door and could feel the locking charm. He knocked loudly and waited. The music cut off and Draco knocked again.
"Don't mess up the hair," Draco warned.
"Nothing," Draco replied easily.
Potter nodded without turning.
"Makes up for your bad eye sight," Draco remarked with a sneer.
"Tracking charm," Draco explained. "How did you hide yourself from the Headmaster and Severus?"
"No," Draco answered.
"Sounds like he doesn't want to be found," Draco remarked, his mind already thinking of the spots Potter like to hide. "What do you need me for?"
"I am where I want to be," Draco replied and Potter raised an eyebrow. "With you."
Potter appeared with a yell and Draco lunged forward and tackled him to the ground.
"No," Potter stated before Draco could open his month. "He just heard the noise."
"You would think that it would be the other way around," Potter pointed out. "Since muggle populations have expanded in the last thousand years. Why hasn't the wizarding world?"
Severus's jaw clenched, he'd thrown him with his question and Draco got a real hint of Snape's feelings. Then the mask came over his face.
"I kind of like it in here," Draco remarked.
Draco slammed open the door to the unused classroom. Potter turned on him with his wand out. Draco then slammed the door behind him before pulling his wand and throwing out a spell. Potter yelped as he dodged to the side.
Potter just groaned and rubbed a hand over his face. Draco laughed as he slipped his shirt over his head. He reached for his belt while Potter's eyes focused on him while he settled his hands behind his head. Draco slipped his pants down and stepped towards the bed. He knelt on the side and looked at Potter.
"But we have wands for that," Draco whined.
Draco turned on the other man and Potter gave him a smirk before getting to his feet. Draco's eyes took in the sight of him. From his broad shoulders and hard chest. He had the body of a man that worked out, even if he was on the shorter side, with lean legs and a slim waist. His shaggy black hair gave him a rugged look which was offset by the red scar and dried blood. He had a sprinkling of dark hair on his chest and down to his groin and unlike others Draco had been with. He didn't shave around his genitals but did keep it trim.
Potter waved his hand and Draco settled down next to him.
"What's wrong with your leg?" Draco asked and Potter paused.
"They didn't expel you," Draco commented and Potter gave him a smirk.
Potter just sneered at him then started walking again. They fell into silence as Potter led them down towards Hagrid's hut. They stopped near a large wood pile and Potter grabbed up a wheel burrow and started to fill it. Draco stood back, unsure if he should help him or not. Potter shrugged out of his robes, until he stood in just his long pants and shirt before going back to the work.
"And if he doesn't want to be found?"
"No," Draco countered as he stood up. "You could have stopped me, I saw the way that you fought with Blaise."
"I can see that the Malfoy line in strong," Voldemort remarked. "I hope your son will be just as loyal as you Lucius."
He grabbed Potter's shoulder and pulled and he rolled limply onto his back. He was cold to the touch and was only wearing his long pants and a shirt. That wasn't the concerning part and what had Draco's heart racing. It was the blood down the side of his face. Draco quickly cupped his cold cheeks before he pulled a cloth from his pocket and dipped it into the stream beside him. He wiped his face down and frowned when he could tell that the blood came from the reddened scar on Potter's brow.
"What are you doing?" Potter grumbled as he rubbed his face.
"Not mental pain," Potter retorted and Severus snorted.
"Yes, muggle band." Potter answered.
"Sirius's brother?" Potter asked as he sat forward on the lounge in interest.
"You won't put any effort into potions and yet this…" Severus grumbled and took the book from the Gryffindor's hand.
"If you tell anyone about this," Draco hissed and those red eyes looked at him. "You will have physical pain to go with the metal pain you are feeling."
When he came up empty handed, he made his way towards the hospital wing. He almost jumped out of his skin when Severus grabbed his arm and pulled him into a room. He pulled himself loose as his heart raced.
"Or mine?" Potter asked.
Draco paused in the hallway when he heard the notes of a piano playing. The song sounded vaguely familiar as he crept closer then quirked a smile when he heard swearing. It looked like Potter was trying his hand at a different instrument. Draco slipped into the room and looked over at the other boy. He had a pencil behind his ear and a book open as he tapped away on the keys. He glanced over when Draco closed the distance.
"You can use the bed," Potter said into the silence. "I'm happy here."
"No, Potter."
"Thanks, 'Arry."
Potter just groaned as he laid back on the bed with his legs still hanging over the side and placed his arm over his eyes. Draco walked into the main room and looked at Severus and the potions that he'd laid out on the table.
"No," Severus replied. "But someone came close to doing it for him."
"He's…" Severus chocked.
"Harry!" Granger hissed while Potter ignored her. "You can't keep this up!"
"That's why he's been having so much trouble blocking the Dark Lord from his mind," Severus explained. "It's not a matter of barriers."
"What happened at the end of the last school year?" Draco questioned. "What sent him to the edge?"
Draco frowned when he could hear yelling in the corridor as he headed towards the transfiguration classroom.
"Harry!" Hermione yelped. "Stop it!"
Draco crossed his arms over his chest, if the other man was being stubborn then so be it. Potter finished filling the wheel burrow and pushed it over towards Hagrid's hut and a large stump of wood. He picked up an axe that was there and grabbed the first piece of wood and started to chop it into smaller pieces. Draco could tell that Potter had done this many times before as he leaned back against the tree and watched him.
Potter stepped closer and looked him over, there was an edge about him that Draco hadn't seen before. Potter turned and looked at the cabinet before looking back to him.
Draco eyed Potter off but he was giving nothing away as he ate.
"Yes, he is," Potter confirmed and looked down at the keys. "He has that feeling around him. A smell of death."
Draco Malfoy dragged his feet as he headed to his detention with Filch in confusion, Severus normally like to dish out his own punishment. He walked out onto the lawns of Hogwarts and took in the clear day and sighed. He'd made the mistake, he should be doing the punishment. He paused when he stepped around the corner of the castle and spotted Potter standing with Filch.
"Very well," Potter announced as he stood from the desk. "You have a deal."
"Are you alright?" Draco asked in concern.
"Sorry," Potter offered. "Head is killing me."
"If you have detentions with Filch for the week, then yes." Draco grumbled.
"They like to tease you," Draco drawled.
"Draco," Potter whispered and he shivered at the use of his first name. "I didn't plan to cover for him. That was not my intention…"
"We haven't got long," Draco told him.
"Yeah, Potter found them. His skills don't progress into fishing."
His attention caught on a seventh-year Hufflepuff in interest as he walked towards Potter.
"I bet she would be a squealer," Greg said with a smirk.
"Someone would have heard that," Draco commented. "What are we going to do?"
Draco sat at the Slytherin table on the first night back at school. He was surrounded by his friends and classmates and yet felt alone as he sat there. He glanced around the noisy hall and his eyes caught on Potter seated at the Gryffindor table. Granger sat on one side of him and was talking to Weasley while Ginny sat on his other side. Potter himself was just looking down at his plate. Draco frowned at that behaviour as Potter just played with his food. No one seemed to be talking to Potter and he seemed happy with that.
"What would you know," Potter grumbled under his breath as he weaved through the junk.
They got Potter on his feet but he wasn't steady as he swayed there. Draco eyed him off before slipping under his arm and taking some of his weight.
A/N: This story is a little out of my comfort zone and not just with the pairing (normally ship Harry/Severus). This is from a different character point of view that I found difficult at times. Hope you enjoy.
"Malfoy Manor," Draco intoned as he stepped in and disappeared.
"Come on," Draco encouraged.
"There was a seventh-year that would meet with him," Draco blurted out. "It could have been him!"
"But-" Weasley went to say and Granger elbowed him. "Yes, professor."
Severus stood up smoothly and Draco noticed Potter tense. The taller man stepped towards the younger man but he held his ground as he watched him, warily.
"I don't know his name," Draco replied. "He's in Hufflepuff."
"Very well," Severus consented. "You will tell me if this becomes an issue, Draco."
"He's a Horcrux," Severus uttered.
"Not that I really want to help with your Slytherin plan," Potter remarked. "Page three thirty-two."
Draco snorted as he stood from the table and Potter watched him.
"He's dying," Draco said softly.
"Yes," Severus drawled. "Now, go!"
Draco squeaked and dropped the book in his hand as he turned his wand on Potter standing there.
Potter then closed the distance this time and touched his lips to his. Draco pulled him closer as his lips opened under Potter's and teased him. He ran his hands down to his ass and grabbed him and Potter gasped. Draco took full advantage as he pushed his hips up and rubbed himself into the body above him. He then growled and rolled them.
"Morning," Potter muttered and rolled onto his back.
"I was trying," Potter grumbled then winced and shut his eyes tightly with a groan.
"Coffee," Severus requested, his voice strained.
He could feel Potter's eyes on his back as he stormed out of the library.
"Legilimency can do that?" Draco questioned and Severus sighed. "He is completely out of it. That never happened when you were teaching me."
"My godfather informed me that you have decided to camp out here," Draco mentioned mildly. "From the look of it, he was right."
"What about the Black house?" Potter broached.
"Regulus Black," Severus stated.
"We just sit this out?"
The two boys nodded and walked that way, casting glares at each other.
"Yes, Professor." Potter replied.
The other boy just gave him a nod and a look of sympathy. His fellow Slytherins didn't quite understand the fact that Severus was his godfather. Draco fell into step with the taller man as they weaved through the common room and out into the hallway.
"You have that look on your face," Potter muttered and Draco looked away.
The other boy didn't respond and Draco wasn't sure what he should do as he knelt there. He cursed before stripping off his own clothes and slipped under the blanket. He wrapped his arms around Potter, feeling his cold skin and shivered. He gently tangled his legs with Potter's and held him close. The fire warmed up the room quickly as the shaking in the man before him eased off. He could feel something settle in him as Potter stopped shaking and Draco ran his hand down the bare skin. The hard muscle under that skin as Draco kissed Potter's shoulder. The fear he'd felt at finding him sprawled out on the ground and bloody eased off.
Potter stepped back and Draco froze at that move. It was unlike Potter to back down.
McGonagall's lips thinned as her eyes looked over her glasses at Potter.
"That too," Severus amended. "Something new that I've been working on."
Draco snorted at those words and Severus frowned.
Draco sat without question and looked down at the floor.
Draco found himself watching Potter then getting frustrated at himself. He tried to convice himself it was to know his enemy but he couldn't push away the…interest in the odd bruises on the other boy. The black eye was just the start as the weather turned cooler and he could see the bruises on his arms and the odd one on his face. Potter's friends were no different but Draco noticed that Potter seemed to sit with Ginny Weasley more than her brother and Granger.
"I thought my life was screwed up," Potter remarked as he picked up his guitar and plucked away on the strings.
"Dark times are already here," Potter hissed as his eyes flashed green.
"Nice place you have here," Draco remarked as he took in the piles of stuff. "Hoarders would envy this."
"I've been working on something new," Potter remarked when he paused.
"No, they are not," Severus agreed. "They came to see him, then left."
Draco shivered at the thought of being branded by that madman.
Draco found himself in Potter's face, those green eyes blazing. Draco just grabbed him and pulled him into a heated kiss. Potter met that heat as he pulled him close and deepened the kiss. His hands were rough on Draco's skin before Potter pulled back with a gasp. Draco's hands were still bundled up in Potter's uniform as he looked down into those eyes.
"Malfoy!" Potter shouted as he kept moving.
"For now," Potter replied. "The Professors seem to be following me around lately and Filch has been asking for me."
"That's it for today," Potter remarked. "I know that I need a shower now."
"No!" Potter yelled as he struggled.
"More likely to be Rebecca Kettleson," Greg butt in.
"Lay him down," Severus ordered quickly.
"Albus is at the end of his rope with the boy," Severus commented and Draco felt his stomach clench. "And once Albus is gone…"
"You want me to get Snape?" Draco asked with a frown.
"You were looking for Potter," Severus stated. "I saw you watching the Gryffindor table. Why?"
"Or he could have been attacked again," Severus countered with a glint in his eyes. "We still don't know who was responsible for that."
"I know," Potter snapped in frustration and shrugged Severus's hand off.
"Snape?"
"Surviving," Draco answered. "While others work out plans."
"There's a door to somewhere," Draco pointed out and Potter glanced over that way.
," Severus intoned softly. "Bring forward what happened, Potter."
"I could do with a deer steak," Draco commented and Potter snorted.
"Not everything is as it seems," Draco whispered, standing close enough that he could smell Potter's scent. "Dark times are coming."
"It's broken," Draco said quickly. "I'm trying to fix it."
"Fourth floor," Draco replied as he took a seat across from Severus. "But I don't think that it works."
"Sometimes you have to feel physical pain to deal with emotional pain," Severus responded.
"I didn't," Draco whispered.
"Yes," Draco answered. "Completely and if anyone can solve this problem then it is him."
"Nothing," Draco answered.
Draco looked into those dancing green eyes and could feel his chest tighten as his cock strained against his pants. Draco made the first move this time as he ran his hands into that shaggy mess of hair and captured Potter's lips. He deepened the kiss as he pushed into Potter then groaned when a hand found the front of his pants and rubbed him. He hadn't expected this as Potter rubbed him. He rocked his hips forward into the other boy as Potter stepped back into the wall. Draco took over control as one of his hands grabbed Potter's ass as he rubbed himself into him.
Draco felt concern run through him at that.
Draco chuckled and gave him a fond look and Potter frowned.
Potter pulled back but didn't release his hold and Draco looked him in the eyes. He'd never thought he would find himself in this situation and he hadn't been lying to Potter. He was where he wanted to be.
"Potter!" Draco shouted and grabbed the other boy's arm. "Would you stop!"
Draco heard a bang followed by cursing and his smile turned into a smirk before the door was ripped open. Potter stood there with a glare and a smudge of dust over his cheek. He sighed when he saw him and pushed the door open. Draco stepped through and closed the door behind him.
"From experience, I would have to disagree with you," Potter said tonelessly.
"Damn Slytherins," Potter grumbled without heat. "Yes, Draco. My Uncle's rage got the best of him one night."
"What are you talking about?"
"The Dark Lord?"
"What?" Draco demanded.
Draco nodded, he trusted his godfather more than anyone in his life. He just hoped that he would save him from having to kill a man. He looked up into that stern face and those hard black eyes.
Severus snorted as he poured a glass of juice and pushed it towards Draco before filling another glass.
"What do you want, Malfoy?" Potter questioned. "I would have believed that spying was beneath you?"
Severus flicked through the book in interest and Draco leaned closer. It was a book of advanced runes.
"Fucking Death Eater," Weasley hissed at him and Draco sneered.
"Is that a new book?" Draco asked.
"Wasn't he out to kill him?" Draco questioned in confusion.
"You didn't say anything," Draco pressed.
The two boys fell into silence and Draco shifted as he looked around the classroom. It looked like it was being used for storage, much like so many other rooms. A fact that was making his task that much harder.
Draco nodded since he couldn't have said anything through the lump in his throat. Potter turned back towards the bathroom and Draco took in the scaring on his back. He would guess that it had been made by a belt and spoke loudly of Potter's home life. He swallowed hard as the other man disappeared into the other room. He couldn't shake that image from his mind.
Potter just waved a hand with a guarded look in his eyes.
"Yes," Draco replied. "Just sleep."
"You're up to something, Malfoy." Potter stated.
"And our disappearance?" Draco inquired.
"Draco?" Severus voice came through the device.
Draco held his hand out and Potter looked at it blankly. Draco wiggled his fingers and Potter snarled and pulled himself to his feet and stood there. Draco could already see the bruise coming up on the other boy's face.
"It was useless," Potter spat with a glint in his eyes. "A fake."
"Sh," Potter whispered and tugged him back into his side. "We'll talk about that later."
"That would be taking inbreeding to new levels," Potter retorted.
"Well," Potter said. "Have a good afternoon then."
"I know that it's been hard this year, Harry." Lupin said softly. "Sirius's own stupidity led to his death."
"My place is here," Severus replied mildly.
Draco had the kettle boiling quickly as he made up the coffee for his godfather. His eyes kept straying over to the man in question and he could see that he was hurting and knew that Voldemort was behind it. The shake in Severus's hand gave that away and he felt rage run through him and fear. That could be him, if he didn't play his cards right. The image of Potter with his shirt pulled up came to mind as he walked the coffee over and held it out.
"We shall see," Voldemort intoned as his eyes looked Draco over. "I have a task for you, Draco."
The fact that they were now stuck in a small cabin for an unknown amount of time played on his mind. He didn't know if that would be torture or not as Potter swallowed before he opened his eyes and glanced at him.
"Bloody Slytherin," Potter cursed before sliding his fingers into Draco's hair and pulling him down.
"Don't try to break the whole piece with one blow," Potter intoned as he cut the wood up. "Kindling is more fiddly."
Potter just laid on his back and looked at him and Draco felt foolish for his words.
"Then he's doing what he has too," Severus said. "I'll be there soon."
"There are more rooms like this one in the castle than the rooms we use," Potter pointed out. "Have you ever wondered why?"
Potter's words floated back to him.
"In a way," Draco said and Potter looked over his shoulder. "It's a doorway to another wardrobe."
"They all use some type of spell," Potter remarked. "Takes the fun out of it."
"What?" Potter whispered with a frown. "What's that look for?"
Draco looked out at the rain from the shelter at the front of the tent and sighed. Severus had told him to head north from where the portkey spat them out and they would find a cabin that they could use for a while. With the rain, Draco was reluctant to go anywhere.  Severus had packed a few changes of clothes and food but neither one would last long.
"You're spending more time here than Hermione," Weasley cried as he dropped into the seat across from the other boy. "Why do you keep looking up these Runes?"
He grabbed his bag and the guitar and stood. Draco gave him a sneer as Potter came closer and he stepped in his way. Potter just barged past him and Draco almost lost his balance.
"Ron," Potter replied and laid his head back against the wall. "For a pureblood, he forgets that he's a wizard too much. I think it comes from having too many brothers."
Potter waved his hand to indicate the room.
Draco looked down at Potter curled up in the bed with one arm hanging over the side as he snored softly. He stepped closer and crouched down as he looked into Potter's sleeping face. He touched his fingers to the other man's forehead and could feel the heat there, even with the potions that Severus had left them. He slipped his hand down Potter's neck to his shoulder and took in the redness of the scratches and bite marks.
"Where is it?" Severus asked.
"Who?" Draco asked as Potter settled next to him on the lounge.
"Why are you here?" Potter asked, breaking the silence.
Draco placed the apple in the cupboard and shut the door as Severus cast the spell. He opened the door again to find the apple gone. He stared at the inside of the empty cupboard and wasn't sure what to think. Severus clasped his hand to his shoulder and Draco appreciated the support in that moment. His godfather knew what he needed as he sighed.
"Unsettled," Lupin replied. "We all knew that Albus's death was coming, but it's still a shock. Minerva isn't taking it well and the Ministry are asking questions about how Death Eaters were able to get into the school. So far, Severus's involvement has been kept under wraps. Bellatrix Lestrange is being held responsible for Albus's death."
Severus paused with a frown and Draco felt that concern go up a notch.
"He's becoming a wild card," Severus remarked. "I'll speak to Albus and see if he can help him. He seems to talk to you more than anyone else."
Severus waved him to the lounge in front of the fire and they settled in.
"I don't see any of your adoring fans," Draco said with a smirk. "Did you scare them off?"
Potter shrugged and met his eyes and Draco sucked in a breath. He wasn't being melodramatic, he believed his words. Draco stepped forward and closed the distance between them and Potter frowned.
Draco wheeled the burrow back to the stump and picked up the first piece of wood. He plunked it down and picked up the axe and swung it down. He'd never split wood before and it didn't go to plan as the axe blade got stuck and he cursed. He tried to drive it down but that just stuck the blade even more. He then tried to wiggle it off which wasn't very effective. He cursed under his breath then froze when he heard a chuckle.
Potter snorted and walked around to the back of the wardrobe and Draco placed his book away in his bag. He would have to talk to Severus about Potter knowing what he was doing.
"My father's death," Draco blurted out then paused once the words were out there.
Draco stared at him as his face flushed in anger.
"Where is your homework, Mr Potter?" McGonagall questioned from the front of the classroom.
Potter nodded but he could tell that he was on the edge of passing out and he wasn't sure why. He glanced over to Severus as the other Death Eaters started to leave. He had to get his attention without alerting the others. He fumbled a piece of wood and flicked it towards the man. It landed with a clatter near Severus and he paused as Bellatrix turned back at the sound.
Draco tripped on his feet and went sprawling as he landed on his ass. Potter stood above him and Draco braced himself for his reaction as the other boy panted. Potter had his hands curled into fists by his sides before he turned on his heels and stalked towards the door.
"What's caught your attention, Draco?" Blaise asked.
"What are you doing here, Malfoy?" Potter questioned and Draco shrugged.
Draco looked down at him, so close that he could easily close the distance between them. Toe over that line that had been drawn between them as Potter glared at him.
"She knows that something is going on," Severus replied as he clasped a hand to his shoulder. "She knows that Lucius and the Dark Lord don't have you."
"Are you still having lessons with him?"
"Maybe to some," Potter grumbled as he looked back down at his book.
"I'm still here," Potter remarked, dryly. "Like a bad penny, always turning back up."
"I think that he just likes being beat up," Draco grumbled.
"What about, Potter?" Draco asked and Severus's mask slipped slightly.
"Seems an odd place to build a cabin," Potter remarked as they closed in on it.
"I'm unsure what that memory was," Severus admitted. "However, it was one that he must have had buried very deep."
"Of the emptiness in your mind, Potter?" Severus countered.
Draco settled in as Potter's hand wandered. He'd never thought, a year ago, that he would be in this situation. The fact that he was with Potter in this situation, even more so.
Potter glanced away.
Potter snorted on the back of his neck and Draco shivered at the feeling. Soon, deep breathing filled the silence and Draco just listened to that and the birds. They were free for now but he wasn't sure how long that would last.
"Yes," Draco answered. "Has Dumbledore spoken to you."
"Hey, Harry." The boy greeted and Potter looked up. "Are we still on for tonight?"
"And yet you are here with him and Granger and Weasley are not," Severus pointed out.
"Are you still here?" Weasley asked as he walked over and Potter looked up.
"Apparently Saturday nights in the Gryffindor tower were more interesting," Draco countered.
Draco nodded as that feeling spread.
Draco glared at the caretaker which just made the man sneer even more.
"No," Potter stated and stepped forward, glass crunching under his shoes. "Something has upset you."
"Speaking from experience?" Draco asked in interest.
"What's that look for, Malfoy?" Potter asked. "I thought you would be happy that I might fall a year behind."
"What!" Draco squeaked. "How am I supposed to do that?"
'Draco,
"Well, they take pride in their record-"
Draco tensed and felt a bolt of fear run through him. It was only Potter's arm around him holding him in place. Bellatrix then turned the wand to the open window.
"What happened?" Draco repeated, then uttered without thought. "He didn't try to commit suicide?"
Draco felt a bolt go through him at the words and was happy that Potter was on the other side of the cupboard and couldn't see him. Potter looked around the side of the piece of furniture and raised an eyebrow when Draco didn't say anything.
A fish suddenly jumped out of the lake and Potter groaned as Draco snorted.
Draco knocked on Severus's door both in excitement and dread. He waited impatiently before he knocked again. He cursed under his breath and looked around the hallway. The door opened and Draco looked back sharply then paused at the look of his godfather.
"Off limits at the moment," Lupin commented. "With the Order in and out, we can't trust you and Mr Malfoy being there. Draco's standing with the Order is still on unstable ground."
"What are you doing here?" Draco demanded.
"What has gotten into you!" Potter yelled.
"I apologise," Draco said and Potter paused. "For the other day. I shouldn't have done that."
"Start looking," Severus hissed. "Report back to me before curfew."
Potter was quiet that night as he made up dinner and they ate with more space between them than normal. Draco wasn't sure what to say as he sat there. Unsure what had caused the distance between them.
"You must play the loyal Malfoy until then," Severus added.
"The scars on your back?" Draco broached.
Potter surprised him by nodding and Draco got the feeling that Potter respected Lupin more than other adults in his life. He pulled out his wand and passed it over to the other man. They both looked at him and Draco sighed before pulling his own wand and holding it out. It felt strange to let the wand go but they were still armed in a way.
Draco reached out and grabbed his mother's hand in his and Narcissa gave him a smile. He loved his mother and knew that he would do anything for her which his father had used against him on more than one occasion. Lucius called it a weakness, Draco saw it as being human. Something that he wasn't sure that Lucius understood.
"Fucking Slytherins!" Potter cursed and turned his back on them as he crossed his arms over his chest.
"What happens now?" Draco asked as he glanced back to the open bedroom door.
"Ah, good morning." Draco stuttered. "I'll be back in a minute."
Draco looked up from the chess board before him to see Severus standing there.
Potter just kept walking without breaking stride. Draco bristled at that but didn't call out again.
Draco chuckled and Severus gave him a look of amusement.
Draco slumped down to his knees before the other boy at those words. Potter looked him over in amusement.
"Startled, were you?" Severus drawled with amusement in his eyes. "Or were you too busy spying on Potter?"
"Potter!" Draco yelled.
"Hope that he isn't here when the time comes," Severus replied simply.
"No," Draco replied, honestly.
"Would rather that you didn't go in there at all," Potter muttered as he slitted his eyes open.
"How about tomorrow instead?" The Hufflepuff said. "I know that Snape's detentions can go longer than an hour."
Potter squeaked as he sprawled out his back and Draco took him in another kiss as he shifted to lay between his legs. This time it was Potter that grabbed his ass and Draco pulled back with a gasp. He looked down into those green eyes and gave him a grin.
"What happens now?" Potter questioned. "Do we just hide here? What about the Horcruxes?"
