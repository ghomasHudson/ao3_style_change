“I don’t particularly want to be pregnant.” Harry feels Draco tense beside him. “But I very much want the baby we’ll be getting at the end of it.”
“Mmm. Same.” Harry’s mouth waters at the memory of licking his way into Draco’s heat whilst Draco was spread open on the tabletop. “You…you make my body feel good in a way that literally no one has before. It’s wonderful. I have only one complaint about our sex life, actually.”
“Hmm?” Harry's consciousness stretches towards Draco’s voice, struggling to form words. The world around him moves slowly, through a thick fog. He’s aware of Draco’s voice and Healer Carr’s, but he can’t make sense of the words.
“Worse.” Harry laughs as his son turns a bit green at that declaration. “But worth it. Having a baby with a partner you love is worth an awful lot of pain and sacrifice.”
“So are you getting married sooner then?” Lily is all smiles. Harry figured his little girl would be excited about a baby.
Draco escorts Harry to the elevators, up three floors and down a long hallway to a set of double doors. The sign above them reads “Department of Dark Magic Damage Research.” He opens the door for Harry and steps in behind him.
“Yes. Please.” Harry nods, unable to peel his gaze away from the little lips and nose and eyes that make up his and Draco’s son.
“We know. But we’re thinking about University.” Matthew appears hesitant but then goes on. “I’ve always wanted to go for law. I’d like to be a prosecutor, I think.”
Scorpius and Draco both fold their long, lanky bodies onto the bed and Harry smiles, wondering if Regulus will take after his father and brother in height.
Harry presses out against Draco’s cock, waiting for the burning to settle and allow the pleasure to overtake the discomfort. Draco’s eyes are closed and Harry can’t tell if he’s trying not to cum or resisting the urge to move.
“Good deal.” Harry turns his attention to Lily as Draco Apparates away. “How was the end of your first year, Lil?”
Harry arches an eyebrow at Draco. “Are you calling Hermione a swot? Or are you calling yourself a swot?”
“True.” Harry is reluctant to let this go, but he also knows Draco is right. He loves his work, but he doesn’t
“Wear the charcoal trousers and the green jumper. Will you get too warm if you wear a dress shirt under it?”
“Do you know how lucky your kids are to have you as their father?” Draco kisses Harry’s cheek. “As for what we’ll tell James, let me go fetch some parchment and a quill and we’ll figure it out.”
Harry’s heart is shattered for Matthew. His parents are clearly making no effort to be understanding or accepting. They’re simply…rejecting him.
A bright burst of light illuminates the length of the string of magic, setting their skin aglow where it rests.
Draco gently rocks them back and forth as Harry moans. The wedge from earlier feels like it’s being hammered into his hips and there’s an immense amount of pressure pushing down towards the base of his spine. He’s certain his hips are going to shatter. Guttural noises escape his mouth, unlike anything he’s ever heard before.
“Removed the benevolent magic from the imaging. It’s residual Dark Magic. It can’t do any harm under most circumstances, but if the core is strained, it moves in and causes haemorrhaging. I suspect if I had an average magical core, I’d have been dead already.”
Harry stretches out his hand and spells on the lights surrounding the pitch as they approach. “I’m sorry people made you feel unwanted. You’re welcome to fly here any time you wish. Scorpius, too.” He turns towards a small building to the side of the pitch. “Come on, I’ll show you the changing room and where we keep the brooms and balls.”
He turns to find Draco standing at the top of the stairs, looking immaculate in his deep ruby dress robes and Harry momentarily forgets to breathe.
“Everything is progressing well.” The Healer withdraws her fingers and doffs her gloves. “We will continue to check every other week until twelve weeks. The canal is usually fully developed at that time. After that it will just be quick checks of your membrane.”
Harry looks down at the outfits. One is dark wash denims that fit rather snug, a dark burgundy dress shirt, and a charcoal sport blazer. The other is fitted charcoal trousers and a supersoft deep green ribbed, fitted, turtleneck jumper. Harry turns to Hermione and waggles his eyebrows. “Let’s go with Slytherin green, just for the fun of it.”
Minerva draws her wand, pulling a silver tendril of magic from Draco’s left hand, looping it around their hands before settling her wand on Harry’s right.
Collective gasps could be heard all around the room, Harry happy with the outcome cheerfully removed the hat and handed it to the shocked older woman that had introduced herself as Minerva and made his way down the stairs and towards the Slytherin table.
“Oh! Hello sweethearts!” Ms. Adkins jumped up as she saw Sabrina entering the room first, followed closely by Harry and then the last two. “Brooke has been waiting for you to visit since she woke up! Come in, come in,” she ushered them in and closed the door behind them so they didn’t disturb anyone in the hall. Sabrina gave the flowers to Brooke’s mum to put in a vase and everyone was now crowding around Brooke’s bed, carefully hugging and kissing her, trying not to make her move too much. Mrs. Beaumont warning was fresh in their minds. Brooke wasn’t her daredevil self, obviously tired and in pain, but Harry knew better than anyone else what it meant to have loved ones around you in times of need and pain. Something he was fortunate to have now for the past three years.
“Now you ungrateful…” Vernon tried to cut him off, but Harry was having none of it. He pushed them all down on the sofa next to each other and locked them in with his magic.
Harry was mesmerized by the breath-taking beauty of the chateau which was surrounded by colourful gardens and lawns created out of the mountainous landscape with magic. You could hear a mixture of French, Spanish, Portuguese and Dutch languages as they went about the grounds, a part of harry wanted desperately to be here with Sabrina. A stupid irrational part of him feared that he might lose touch with the Beaumont family after he starts attending Hogwarts, even though they had proved to him at every opportunity that he was truly and wholeheartedly accepted and loved as a part of the family, he could help but just wonder
“Well, you can show me the catalog or whatever they have of the school you’re going to! And your dad thinks that I’m going to get a letter from Hogwarts, so you can show me all the pictures and tell me about the academic aspect of it! I would love to learn more!” To be honest, Harry had no clue what to expect from Hogwarts. What would the classes be? The rooms? The other kids? And he remembers Benoit saying something about Quidditch. Apparently it’s a very big deal over there, like how soccer was here. That was the analogy that he had gotten from him.
They were all sitting in Sabrina’s mother’s SUV. Céleste Beaumont was a very beautiful woman with blond hair and green eyes that could almost rival Harry’s. Any time Harry would see her -- which was not much since she traveled all around the world running a muggle (which he had learnt is a term used for non-magical humans) company called Morphée Joaillerie which was based in Paris -- she would always be kind and gentle with him. She would teach him all that he had missed about being a wizard growing up with magic-hating muggles, but most of all Harry loved Sabrina’s father, Laurent. He was ‘a stay at home dad’ catering to his children’s every needs, which included Sabrina’s older siblings, Adele and Benoit. Both older siblings resided in Paris and helped run the company and its various branches with their mother. Keeping the family business alive and fruitful was the long and proud tradition of the Beaumont family since the family firm started trading in Versailles in 1777, and attracted the patronage of its most famous client, Marie Antoinette. The family firm then moved to Paris eventually settling at 9 Rue de la Paix. And now Céleste and Henry, her brother, were the fourteenth generation that owned it.
She touched his forehead where the lightning bolt had permanent residence. “But mon lapin, I have a feeling that you will surprise me once again and do what our society deems impossible.” She kissed Harry’s slightly now pink forehead.
“Do you want more pasta before I drop you off back home? Its almost nine! You need your eight hours of sleep before school tomorrow! Always important to start the week off in a good mood!” She was saying as she guided Harry out of her make-shift office and into the kitchen, where a big bowl of pasta was still sitting with a few red stains around it. He would have removed the stains using his magic but he still wasn’t sure if he should tell Mrs. Art about it. She may like magic in theory, in her stories, but how would she react if she knew it was real? Would she shun him like the Dursleys? That wasn’t a question he was willing to find an answer to. She was the only thing keeping him sane and anchoring him to this awful world he was destined to live in. Honestly, Harry didn’t know how much of this he could take. Would the Dursleys let him leave? Go to university? And even if they didn’t, Harry had planned an elaborate escape. After all, with him being more intelligent than his peers and the fact that he could do magic, how hard could it be for him to make money and live on his own?
“Charms are a type of magic spell concerned with enchanting an object to behave in a way that isn't normal for that object. For example, the Summoning Charm brings an object to the caster. Charms are also something of a catch-all for spells that aren't Transfiguration, like spells that change the inherent nature of an object. In some sense, if a spell isn't Transfiguration, it's probably a Charm.
The Sorting Hat aware of his thoughts mused again “Loyalty, eh? Are you sure? Slytherins are associated with cunning, ambition, and a tendency to look after their own. Slytherin has produced its share of Dark witches and wizards, beware. They are always striving to be the best, something they have in common with Ravenclaws. However, Slytherins will never leave their own behind.”
He would have never though that this was the way things would end. So much has changed and was going to change.
“Yes Ma'am!” Harry had already secured his jacket in one hand and was running towards the door to help Samantha open it.
Inside the cart was very loud you could hear many loud voices with different accents speaking excitedly, members of each now full cart exchanging names and house aspirations.
“Oh Mrs. Art, don’t worry! Like you said he only did it because he was jealous! I mean his horse looked like a hippopotamus!” It was moments like this that Samantha was reminded Harry was just a six year old kid - or as he insisted six
to know? Do you?” Petunia was whispering in his ears, trying to calm him down as she rubbed his arms. Who’s
“As I was saying earlier,” he gave Benoit a look. “I took Adele’s advice and meditated, trying to calm my magic and connect to my surroundings! And it finally worked! I was soooo close to giving up! But I finally did it! I could feel everything and it was… it was… I don’t even know how to really describe it…” Harry was shaking his head as if to get rid of the returning feelings.
Harry was floating. He could feel everything. The vibrations, the textures, even taste the colors around him. As if nothing and everything in existence was now a part of him, just as a finger or toe, an extension of his body. There but not really there. It was so confusing. And the amount of emotions and vibrations around him did little to help him understand. He felt overwhelmed and underwhelmed at the same time. Emotions all blended together giving birth to something new.
This was going to be a very, very long day, locked in an auditorium with everyone that hates him. Perfect.
I just don’t understand how could all the gods decide that his kids are going to harm and endanger everyone before they even do anything?” Harry said heatedly. “To be honest Mrs. Art, I don’t think the moral of this story is good for kids, punish someone for something you assume they will do in the future? Maybe capturing them in the first place will make them bad people afterwards?” He turned his head towards Mrs. Art - or Samantha as she kept persisting him to call her. She was just looking at him, a smile stretched out on her lips.
They had all met the first day of classes at The Wiseman private school for gifted children and had formed a special relationship among themselves. They were his family now.
Harry spent the next couple of days going through his textbooks, comparing his with Sabrina’s trying to soak up as much knowledge as he could. In-between all that Harry and Benoit even managed to get back at Adele and Sabrina evening the score after the whole glitter incident.
arrives. Normally students wait to purchase everything after receiving the letter but the Beaumont’s wanted to avoid the inevitable crowds of families and long lines scrambling to buy school supplies and apparently the headmaster of Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore had agreed to send the Beaumont’s the supply list ahead of time to avoid unnecessary risks.
But at times like these, as rare as they were a couple years ago, they were becoming more frequent, becoming his every day.
As Harry was trying on different colored and styled robes, the two men kept going on about how Wizard clothing and fashion is frozen in time, harking back to the seventeenth century, when the magical community went into hiding from muggles. Mason thought that this nostalgic devotion to this old-fashioned form of dressing is a way to cling onto old ways and old times, and Noah argued that it was a matter of cultural pride. Both were very interesting points that Harry had never thought of until then.as they were poking and measuring various limbs Harry couldn’t help but notice in the mirror the way the two men worked around each other, completely in synch just like Celest and Laurent do, the rare moments when they are together, work had been demanding a lot of the trio's attention more than usual, something about a big show coming up and the winter line.
After all the mess was swiped away by Adèle and Sabrina, Benoit made a point of stomping out of the living room while sending death glares towards his siblings and muttering swear words in French that could still be heard even after he left the room.
-Harry knew then that if he practiced enough, he could do anything he wanted and stop his tormentors. Which may not have been one of his best ideas because as soon as things started to move around the house and dishes started floating towards the sink to be washed, the Dursleys had reacted very
Harry was not ready to let go of what he had just attained. After all these years of solitary holidays, staring out of the window he had what he always wanted, and now he was being forced to leave it all for being
“Good, good. Now Mrs. Art will be picking me up in an hour; that should be enough time for you to empty Dudley’s room for me. Oh and I require your credit card to buy new furniture. I do not like your taste. It’s so… tacky. I’m sure Mrs. Art wouldn’t mind taking me shopping.” He let out a deep breath. Wow, it was so liberating to let that all out and he was getting excited about his new room and going shopping! He had never gone to a mall before, this was indeed going to be very exciting!
“Any day now mon soleil [My sunshine]. Now you and Harry best get ready, your piano instructor will be here any minute! Off you go! Ill clear the table…” the dishes were already lifted in the air and making their way to the washing counter. Laurent seemed to be occupied with the task at hand, so Harry turned to Adèle to ask the question that had been burning at the back of his mind all afternoon.
“Yes,” she smiled at him and dove in her pile of papers to find something. “Okay here it is! On problem 43 what did you get for the value of x, y, and z? I mean I got answers but they look strange…” she was looking at the numbers as if she could mentally make them solve themselves, actually a conversation that they had two years ago. No actual results were found.
school, Beauxbatons which actually means beautiful wands in French,” she gave Harry a pointed look, as she always did when she taught him a new word. “Is a beautiful chateau in the Pyrenees Mountains in France, the name of our headmistress is Olympe Maxime, she’s a half giant from Greek descendants, although papa says that she denies it! She was even a seeker!” Seriously, a half giant? That’s so cool! Harry really wanted to see one up close
After the three hours back to back piano lessons for Harry and Sabrina, the two almost eleven-year old’s were getting ready to meet Celeste at:
“Yes sir, we only have five more kids to pair with their parents. They were lucky,” the firefighter named Clint turned around towards the five kids he had just mentioned. And oh so surprising, Harry was one of them. He wouldn’t be too shocked if he was the last kid left sitting on the stretcher.
“Ooh ! En voilà une idée brillante!!” She smiled at him and clasped his hand into hers. “Well your school is a castle in Scotland,” she said as she was leaning back into her seat and because of the contact he had to do the same to be comfortable.
“Plus I’m feeling slightly peckish and I know papa made his famous Sole Meuniere!” And with that the boys started running. Oh god Harry did not want to face Sabrina now. Bugger, she knew him better than he knew himself.
Later in the night as Laurent caught Harry sneaking glasses at the envelope now sitting on the Hall Dining table, he proceeded to tell him more about the crest of Hogwarts and the motto that appears on it:
The Slytherin common room and dormitories were located in Slytherin Dungeon. The students entered the Dungeon through a concealed stone wall.  Which they must present the correct password to open the wall and reveal the entrance to the common room. Severus Snape his head of the house, which Harry was getting a sense did not like Harry at all and seemed displeased he was sorted into his house repeated several times that the password to the common room changes every fortnight and that the students need to Keep an eye on the noticeboard.
“We want the finest robes for our Harry, so we came to the finest establishment!” she complimented them in her French accent which seems to make Mr. Twilfitt beam even wider if that was at all possible, his husband was less emotive.
“Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus,” which Benoit entering the kitchen had heard, interjected that meant “Never tickle a sleeping dragon.”. Very fitting.
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July.
“Get out of this goddamn car and start explaining what the hell you did!” Vernon shouted as soon as the car was parked. Well it seemed he was going with option two. This was going to be very interesting.
“Do They Know It’s Christmas?” by Band Aid was playing on the radio as Harry, Sabrina, Brooke and Felix were trying to decorate a Christmas tree. Conner was away with his family visiting his grandparents in Ireland and he was not pleased, not at all. After a half hour tantrum and some bribing from his parents, Conner had agreed to go to Ireland ‘willingly’ after they bribed him with a Nintendo game thing. Harry had seen one at Felix’s house but he was never really interested in playing that game with some Italian lad named Mario or something. After playing with holograms and creating his wildest dreams into reality with magic, games like Mario just seemed really lame to Harry and Sabrina, of course but she was never vocal about it.
harm him. Well she added that last part after Harry had proposed to make Dudley crazy by making him believe his room was hunted. “Okay, well try to think of a good one! After he threw his cranberry juice on your painting last Wednesday…..” she just shook her head madly.
Three shops later they had purchased everything but Harry's wand, he still simply didn’t understand the need for one but had to pretend to be excited, accompanying Sabrina on her trip to the wand shop in Nice was… quite a sight. He had never seen her so happy and excited in his life. So, Harry plastered a smile on his face and followed the family into gloomy shop as they got closer he could read the Peeling gold letters over the door that read “Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 BC.” Upon entering he was met with an old, tall man with pale eyes and skin peering at them with curiosity from behind the counter. Clearly, he spent a lot of time indoors.
“I can straighten the edges and maybe take the glue stains off, it’s really easy...” before he could finish his sentence Sabrina’s deep frown shut him up. Ok, apparently that was the wrong thing to say.
“HAAAARYYYY!!!” Petunia had been shouting his name for the past minute. Harry hurriedly put on his cloths over his wet body, having just stepped out of the shower. He would just dry himself with his magic when the Dursleys weren’t around. As Harry opened the door Petunia stated yelling again.
“I give you…six months,” she said as Harry was now standing behind her overlooking on what she was working on. It looked like a diary in French. Now he needed to perfect his skills!
Even though no one but Harry and the Dursleys knew what had really happened between the two, Harry had let the Beaumont family know that the Dursleys didn’t approve of his heritage and that was why he had no information of what he really was. So everyone was happy to cooperate and do as instructed.
“Thirty, maybe forty minutes….” He had faraway look in his sea green eyes which was nearly buried under his long golden blond strands of hair, clearly not paying attention to Harry’s question.
“Which we can discuss at a later date.” She rubbed circles on his back and drew him to herself in a half hug. “Not all magical creatures can do this and for some it is harder than others, specifically human witches or wizards… The more we distance ourselves from nature the harder it gets, now I don’t mean physical distance, but our minds.”
“Oh well, at least you have me to challenge that brilliant brain of yours! Which remiiiiiiiiiiindss,” she stretched the last word while she bent down by her desk to collect a stack of books, “Me to give you these.” A loud thud averted his eyes to her desk where the books where residing.
The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. Turning over the envelope over, with trembling hands, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. The moment he had both been eagerly expecting and avoiding had finally arrived. Not being able to wait any longer he tore the envelope open and revealed the folder paper from within its confines. Folding the paper open the letters could be seen written in a beautiful cursive:
As she was taking a breath, Harry couldn’t contain himself and asked all the questions he was holding onto during her talk.
“I’m fine, Mrs. Art,” he managed to say in a small voice, not wanting to draw more attention to himself.
So to his utter surprise, Vernon had agreed with her when she had asked him if Harry could spend the weekends with her. He guessed they would rather get rid of him for two days and relax, rather than just keep him locked up in his cupboard.
“I have a feeling about you, young one. Pick up these wands see if you feel a bond to any of them, there are a few in the back that I think will do…” he was now down the dark hallway in search of more wands for Harry to try out.
The hat was battered and old; completely patched, frayed, and extremely dirty. Every time it spoke or sang, a tear along the brim opened like a mouth. Laurent had told Harry that the Hat spoke to the wearer inside of the hat with a small, quiet voice, using Legilimency to interpret their thoughts and respond to them. Another very exciting and peculiar thing at Hogwarts.
“And Dudley, honey, we need you to go to your room. We don’t want you hearing this.” Petunia gave Harry a heated look, and turning around, she guided Dudley towards the stairs. Okay then, this was Harry’s moment to set the record straight. He just loved to use that analogy even though he didn’t quite get it. Samantha did explain it to him but still… that didn’t matter right now. “Actually Petunia, I want Dudley to be here for this. I think it’s about time that we… have a talk.” Harry straightened his back and pushed his headache away. He didn’t have time for that, yet. And by the glare that he was getting from her it seemed that trying to keep that headache at bay was a very smart move. He wanted to do this right and not get angry or show any emotion at all. He had read that that particular trait in people made others wary.
Without pause, all other Slytherins raised their glasses and echoed his sentiments. Harry already felt better. He had made the right choice. The sorting ceremony carried on for another hour and once it was done the students were ushered by their heads of houses toward their own private common rooms.
“Well, now – Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?” Harry looked at both hands for a split second before answering “well, I’m right-handed”.
“Oi! You two stop taking a piss! Her room is around the corner!” Harry shouted at them and was met with a nurse’s icy glare. Oops. Better walk faster. The door to her room was open and Harry saw Brooke’s mum, Ms. Adkins, sitting on a chair by the window and typing furiously on her phone. Her red hair spilling around her in odd angles attesting to her staying by her daughter’s side every second.
“You need patience! But to answer some of your questions: yes, if you ever succeed in attuning yourself with nature that will help you immensely, as it is an unlimited source of power. But there are limitations specifically when used in the dark arts. Now when I say that I don’t mean the new ministry interpretation of dark magic, but the old laws laid down by Merlin and those before him…” Looking at Harry’s slightly confused and curious gaze she chuckled.
"Young Harry let me walk you through the process… The wand chooses the wizard. That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wand lore... These connections are complex. An initial attraction, and then a mutual quest for experience, the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand." He was now starring deep into Harrys eyes, as if somehow, he could physically make him understand his words through the power of his gaze.
Harry took calming breaths and opened his eyes, now a mischievous gleam in them. Two can play this game. He just had to find an opportunity which he can make sure he will have the upper hand and trap her! “anything for you, sweet cheeks!” Harry gave her a big smile and walked out of the kitchen practically skipping to the bathroom. He had plans to make, and everyone knows that the shower is the best place to brainstorm.
After the customary greetings and hugs, the group made their way to the shop. The first thing that captured Harry's attention were the golden mannequins bearing the latest wizard fashions sitting in the window display. Inside, the shop was lit by multiple big chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, the light of the many candles making the polished wood that covered the wall and most of the furnishings seem to glitter which made harry want to run up and touch the material. The sitting area was decorated with plush velvet furniture and a wooden table with a very finely detailed red tablecloth, where tea and biscuits were floating about, waiting to serve the new patrons. Now that they were ushered in and seated Harry could see more mannequins lining the back walls, showing various wizard fashions, but no trace of muggle fashion could be seen anywhere. It was obvious that this was a shop that everything is made to order.
As the song was playing, Harry was rummaging through the big box labeled ‘XMAS’ with Felix trying to find the big star that went on top of the tree, but they had not been lucky so far.
Well that wouldn’t do, Harry thought to himself. He needed to find the broken pieces and make it whole again. The spell that was meant to fix things came to his mind, ‘The Mending Charm, also known as the Repairing Charm (Reparo) is a charm that can be used to seamlessly repair a broken object. It works against most material. This charm was invented by Orabella Nuttley, in or before 1754.’ He remembered as Laurent was telling him about this Charm a couple of weeks ago. He never understood why other magical creatures needed words to conjure what was within them. After all, magic was a part of them and Harry didn’t need words to conjure it and make it do what he desired. He could just will it and voila! Whatever Harry desired (with some limitation here and there, as he had discovered during the years) would take shape or happen.
“A Charm might cause something to flash different colors. It might cause an object to levitate or even fly through the air. Charms can make a person laugh or dance or even create a bubble of breathable air around a person's head. In all of these cases, the object or the person doesn't really change, they just do something unexpected. Some Charms can be extremely powerful. The Fidelius Charm, for example, can completely hide a person or a place in such a way that no one can find them unless they are given the location by a
They had decided that they would all take Sabrina to her designated station and send her off first and then accompany Harry to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters and make sure to remind him they loved him and will be missing him dearly. Laurent especially felt like he was losing a son he had just found. Definitely more hours will be spent either baking or woodworking when celeste is away as well. Laurent was a true family man, nothing made him happier and more content than being with all his family and taking care of them.
“Oui maman,” she kissed her mother’s cheek and picked up the bouquet of flowers Céleste had bought for Brooke, and got out of the car.
“Your father, on the other hand, favoured a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favoured it – it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.” Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.
“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.”
A couple of minutes into his chat with Hermione he had discovered that both her parents were muggles, So it was quite a shock when her letter accompanied by professor McGonagall had arrived at her house, therefore she had spent all summer preparing for her first year at Hogwarts and had already memorized half of the spells they will be learning the coming months. He appreciated her forethought and her similar thirst for information. Maybe they will get along after all. Ron was a whole different story, as Harry later in the ride discovered Ron came from one of the 28 pureblood families (which his own used to be a part of at some point in history) and had grown up surrounded with magic, but somehow still lacked the ability to perform a simple cleaning charm. Huh. Apparently, not everyone is naturally in tune with their magic, he wondered why that was? Was something causing a glitch in his magic?
As much as Harry despised the man, he could help but burst out laughing, leaving Vernon very confused. He had assumed Harry would be mad at him for making fun of his magical world. Little did he know even Harry found many customs and laws of these magical beings utterly ridiculous.
And that, to this date, was one of the best days of his life in the six years that he had been breathing on this earth. There were a couple of reasons for this:
“You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.” Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.
He felt like he understood the universe. He was the universe. It controlled him and he controlled it. Forever expanding and shrinking. Pulsing all around him. Colors melting into each other creating shades he never knew even existed. Does he even exist anymore? He didn’t care.
“I have personally seen an foxfire mark the boundaries of a magic circle at a location that was identified as a receptive power spot and attuned to a planned ritual the day before. I’ve seen more than one site be dry and comfortable, with a round hole in the clouds overhead, on days that were cold and rainy. Even birds have joined in rituals, flying around the circle when energy was being raised!” She was now looking at him more seriously.
Hello Beautiful people! If you are still reading this story THANK YOU! and I apologize for uploading once every blue moon... 8 chapters in 6 years... all I can say life gets in the way, my dudes. Hope you all enjoy and stay safe & strong during these hard times.
“Oh Harry, mon lapin!” Here we go with the nicknames again. As much as he pretended to dislike them, he liked them, very, very much. And he knew that they knew. And unspoken truth among the family.
“Deal, same stakes then?” The two best friends shook hands and a green light passed through them, sealing the deal. This would be interesting.
Laurent went first followed by Sabrina, Adele and Benoit supervised as Harry flooed and soon joined the party. During the trip, Harry noticed other fireplaces and hearths zooming past him, but everything was zooming too fast after a few seconds that he couldn’t recognize anything anymore, everything was just a mash of colors, which slightly reminded him of his meditation sessions.
birthday so we can invite everyone! And I’m making a game board so we can keep track of the scores and give out a grand prize at the end! Sort of like the tri-wizard tournament, isn’t that a brilliant idea? oui?” she was shaking the board in his face now as if that was going to help change his mind. But he understood what she meant. You can’t always rely on magic to do everything, sometimes you have to take the time and do it by hand taking in the experience. Laurent called it a muggle meditation. From time to time he would find Laurent at his woodworking table sanding his latest designs, a table, a chair, a credenza… the list went on. Apparently, the movements he made with his hands helped him meditate and think, also helped with his wand movements which Harry found fascinating. That is one of the reasons he loved his piano lessons with Sabrina. He liked using his hands, another reason why he found wands so ridiculous. It inhibited the witches and wizards to actually feel and control the magic in a natural organic way, instead they channel it all through a stick to make their spells more accurate and potent. Why use an extension? An outside tool to control something that’s within you?
“‘arry mate! Oi!” Benoits voice snapped him out of his self-musings. All Harry could focus on was the envelope that Benoit handed to him. Deep breaths.
Harry was so lucky to have made such amazing friends, they were so different, yet they are had stuck together since the day they met at the academy. He had promised them all to write letters and keep in touch when he went to his ‘fancy’ boarding school in Scotland. He had told them it was what his late parents would have wanted, that it was a family tradition that he could not break, being the only one left. Not a complete lie, by the way, Harry had assured himself. He had rather not lie but this one was out of his hands. In order to be part of this new exciting world, he had to abide by the rules or make he never gets caught if he were to ‘step around’ them”.
“Harry James Potter! I have been waiting here for five minutes! Didn’t I tell you to hurry up! Its Dudley’s first year graduation! Ah my smart Dudders!” She gushed the last part and hurriedly got into the bathroom and shut the door loudly in his face. Typical for her to leave out Harry; he was graduating too! And he had gotten full marks in every lesson! But that somehow made the Dudleys despise him more, telling him how he was a freak and his high IQ was caused by a side effect of his freakishness.
She was now nodding her head which made her sun kissed blond hair bounce slightly around her, still deep in thought probably trying to see what else she should tell him.
Before Harry could overthink this any longer the Sorting Hat had made its decision “Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, there's no doubt about that. No?”
“Harry, what are you going on about mate?” Benoit was now crouching down next to him and raking his eyes over Harry’s small form, looking for scratches and bruises.
“Ohhh yes, yes, Dumbledore! I knew he had a funny name! Merci papa!” She turned her head towards harry again. “So the headmaster is Albus Dumbledore. He is said to be on the side of the light and very powerful! Have a very long white beard and wears colorful robes with dancing kittens and elves!” She seemed to find this person very amusing, and he couldn’t blame her. Dancing kittens and elves? Really? What kind of a school was he going to? Where monsters and ghouls running around freely? And fairies making him breakfast? He didn’t like this feeling of the unknown, he wanted to be prepared. “But
“How did you make it stop?” Benoît was screaming at the spot where harry used to be lying down, the glitter had already blinded his vision, poor thing. If it hadn’t looked so funny harry would have helped him but he decided to enjoy the scene unfolding before him for a couple more seconds as he, Adèle and Sabrina were watching him in amusement. From the stories Harry had heard about the pranks Benoît had pulled on his siblings, this was considered
on a banana peel last week, and her pancakes landed all around her, she had been more vigilant. And Harry could sense a weak repellent shield around her, probably got the spell from Adèle, since Benoît had sided with Harry and thus this had been deemed a girls vs boys battle.
After they had all disbursed Harry went in search for his luggage and owl which he had been told was placed in the dormitories after the sorting. Upon locating his belongings Harry now had to find a suitable bed. He didn’t want anything in the middle. The more privacy he could have the better. Harry located an unclaimed bed at the further side of the dorms, the last bed in the row, framed by two beautiful large windows that look out into the lake, the shimmering blue light mixing with the green of the room making it even more magical. Not wasting a second Harry summoned all his belongings and apparated them unto his chosen bed before the silver-haired boy that had also been on his way to Harry's chosen bed could blink.
I know I've been gone for far too long, between being a thesis student and work I barely have time to sleep but this voice in the back of my head has been nagging me to finish this story. so I typed up this chapter after 2 years... just bear with beautiful people, I have very very delicious things planned ahead...
After the tour concluded and all the excitement seemed to have taken a toll on the children, they were all led back to the dorms and told to pick a bed and start unpacking.
“Does that mean I can perform any sort of ritual or spells better with the help of nature if I’m attuned to it? How long does that take? Can all magical beings do that? What are the limitations? Also Benoit said something about dark magic…” he was cut off by Adele’s laugh.
Harry stares back into those silvery eyes and nods. Draco’s hands move to cup Harry’s face and Harry’s lightly grips Draco’s hips and everything starts moving a little slower. And then Draco’s soft lips are on his and it’s better than he ever could have imagined.
Harry drifts halfway into consciousness the next morning and his sleep-addled brain wonders, blearily, which of the kids had climbed into his bed last night. He cracks his eyes open and the blond head next to him certainly doesn’t belong to any of the kids. As the haze of sleep lifts fully from him, the previous night comes flooding back and he smiles contentedly
“That works. Until then, we don’t have to name names if we say we’ve got a partner, but I also don’t intend on hiding the fact that I’m in a relationship if the issue comes up.” Draco pauses. “I assume you’ll tell Hermione?”
“Now, see in the imaging how his head is down, but a little to the left side?” James nods. “So find the centre of the bottom of the abdomen, then shift a little to the left.”
“Good afternoon, Mr Potter!” Healer Carr bustles in and begins her usual set up. “How are you feeling?”
The kids all move forward to hug him, Scorpius included. “I love all four of you very much. Have a good term, and write whenever you can, okay?”
“I’ve thought about it, too, but I know I’m not ready yet.” Hermione hesitates before seeming to decide to go on. “But as silly as it sounds, I’m too scared to do it alone.”
“I’m your own personal cautionary tale,” Harry laughs. He and Draco are adults and in a committed relationship — they are thrilled to be having a baby — but if the circumstances can keep his son from ending up pregnant too young, that’s an added bonus.
“I’d prefer to make Matthew a Potter myself in a few years, Lil.” He tips his head back to kiss Matthew’s jaw quickly.
“Yeah, I—“ Harry pauses as footsteps come down the stairs. James and Matthew turn into the kitchen, hand in hand. They both still look like they’ve been crying, but they also look rather sated, and Harry isn’t quite sure he wants to know how they’ve worked off their feelings to get to that state.
Harry has just returned to the bedroom from putting the books away in the study when Draco’s throwing open the window to let Woody in. The owl pecks at Draco’s fingers as he tries to untie the parchment from his leg.
Harry looks to Draco, whose eyes are tear-filled eyes like his own, and the blond nods. “I had planned to talk to you tonight about taking your name. Scorp had his part of the idea on his own, though.”
“Boy I have told you time and time again, not to talk like that! You’re not better than anyone here! And no normal boy your age talks like that!” Vernon was now glaring at Harry, his eyes were livid. It always irritated Vernon when he spoke in a well-mannered and grammatically correct way; something his own son and wife, or even himself for that matter, lacked greatly.
“Really Sabrina? Rubik’s cube? You know we should get one for Felix! See how our little Einstein will do! You know after Harry, I have the best record! 19.5 seconds! Still don’t know how Harry does it! 8 seconds! Pshh.”
Sensing his uneasiness Hagrid quickly got everyone’s attention back to himself and started sputtering facts about the lands and the building itself. Harry lost in his thoughts picked up some things Hagrid was saying… Hogwarts was hugged by a vast forested area, and a fairly large lake, in the highlands of Scotland…If Muggles approach the castle, all they will see is a moldering ruin with a sign warning them to keep out, that it is unsafe. That’s a cool trick that Harry definitely wanted to learn how to do, could he just will it? He needed to experiment at a later time. They all hastily exited the boats now seeing the towers in their full glory, you could practically see the young girls and boys bursting with excitement. They were finally
“Harry?” Hearing his name made him snap out of his musings. His friends had long accepted this little quirk of his, after spending so many years in his head and talking to himself, he had gotten used to it.
By the time he was done reading the letter for the third time, he looked up to see Sabrina, Laurent, and Benoit looking at him with smiles on their faces. He loved them so much.
The room was now mostly empty, only a couple frames and marker stains left on the wall, but Harry knew he could just fix that with a little magic. He just had to will it hard enough. He knew he could make anything happen as long as he wished it hard enough, and he couldn’t wait to find the boundaries of his ability and discover new tricks.
“welcome, welcome! Let me light up a couple more candles for you.” As he turned to do just as he promised Harry began to inspect the wands laid out before him and process the information that he was just given. They all looked so beautiful and delicate. A true fine piece of art. He just couldn’t see it anything really other than just that. Maybe when he finds his own wand he will feel differently. He had been told the bond between a wizard and their wand is very sacred and special. As Harry was inspecting the wands Sabrina and Benoît disappeared to the back of the shop and Adele left to buy a few ingredients for the potion she was currently brewing before the shops closed. Adele and Laurent were watching him like hawks and whispering back and forth among themselves most probably trying to figure out how to address all this later, nearly every shop they went to there had been comments about his parents and Lord Voldemort.
“Harry, given your past and history it is no surprise that you are such a gifted wizard. Your powers are so advanced and you haven’t even started at Hogwarts!  There are so many wizards and witches that can’t do what you have accomplished so far! You don’t even have a wand yet!”
“But he should at least answer one or three of my emails,” Draco said in a defensive tone. He let out a sigh.
Draco might be skinny, but he wasn’t as weak as people liked to believe. He had muscles; he had played Quidditch for Salazar’s sake.
Unfortunately, Potter had played Quidditch too, and he was just as strong; maybe stronger. Shouting to Draco to calm down, he pushed him away until they were both lying on the floor, panting heavily and far from the bed, as they had rolled across the room in the ferocious match that had just taken place.
But thought the better of it, especially once he saw the look on Draco's face, his expression hard and cold. Draco regretted the small question he had uttered before, the one where he had asked Harry to move in. "You let me believe you were dead!" He said instead, eyes shooting daggers at Harry. Oh, the things he would do... "You troll! I was obviously very desperate!"
Harry had absolutely no idea where Draco had learnt healing spells. They hadn’t covered that yet in any class, he was sure of it. He really wanted to ask but didn’t dare to interrupt Draco’s spell-work. He didn’t wish to repeat second year again or something similar to it.
Draco smashed his head against the surface of the table and groaned. He suddenly felt utterly defeated. “Why are you even here then, Weasley?”
“No, but I’ve got a feeling you’re about to suggest something anyway,” Draco said with a sigh. Weasley nodded to confirm that Draco’s been right, and he inwardly groaned in frustration.
Draco drew a breath, focusing on making it a calm one. His heart had begun to race with worry, and that wasn't good at all.
This wasn’t what Draco wanted to hear. He began feeling exasperated; Weasley was supposed to help and support him, not scold him! What on earth was so wrong with writing so much? Just because he’d written eighty-eight emails between last night and this morning, and three hundred the other day, didn’t mean that...Harry could have answered him
Draco squeezed his eyes shut. No, he couldn’t do it. It was embarrassing; too bloody desperate. Just the
Potter was in his apartment, Draco corrected himself, and he wasn't supposed to be, and he had so many questions, but the room spun a little, and he was nauseous and—
Still smirking, Draco tilted his head to one side. “Everyone has their secrets, Potter. It’s rude to ask. But… maybe you’d learn how to handle a knife properly in potions if you weren’t so…
The new tab his boyfriend had just opened was blank mostly. At the top of the screen, Draco read: new email.
Draco thought as Weasley led the way to the liquor cabinet again. Weasley might not be half-bad if he really thought about it. This could be fun. Or maybe it was just his drunken mind talking. It most likely was.
Ron Weasley lay sprawled out on Draco's sofa, snoring heavily in his slumber. Ozzy had curled up close, sleeping with his head tucked under Ron's chin. Midnight lay on his stomach while Dante was nowhere to be seen. Cats and a sleeping Ron was the type of disgustingly adorable image that would have had Hermione Granger's heart beating extra fast, and Draco would have scowled and sent Weasley home—had he seen it. It just so happens that he hadn't,
Draco said, narrowing his eyes. But then his head leaned on Harry's shoulder, and he allowed himself a short rest. The potion might have got rid of the hangover, but he still felt tired. And Harry was warm and comfortable and too inviting not to right now. "Later. I hate you, you know. But you're warm, so I suppose you are forgiven." He snuggled even closer, getting himself comfortable despite being on the floor.
him. The Slytherin moved his wand slowly over Harry’s wounded hand, and little by little, the skin was sewn together again.
Weasley's laugh faded out, and he shook his head. He wiped tears from his eyes. "No, I'm telling you. I don't. He's working. That's all I know."
"To hell with it," Draco said to the ceiling. Harry chuckled lightly with his head resting on Draco's chest. Draco's nostrils were filled with the smell of the wizard's hair, and it was strange how his mood could shift so quickly. As soon as Weasley's annoying face had disappeared, Draco had relaxed, and then he and Harry had had an extremely good time.
“The computer course, yes,” Draco finished for him, not bothering to look up. “And I told you, I chose to not ask Granger because I didn’t want her to go on any rants or ask any stupid questions—”
A/N: This story is finished, I'm editing it at the moment. Sorry that it took a while; I'm currently struggling with some health issues. Thank you for your patience. <3
Ozzy was curled into a little grey and white ball in Weasley’s lap, sleeping heavily while Weasley’s wide hand absentmindedly slowly stroked over the top of the cat’s head down to his back. It took all Draco’s might not to grimace at that.
of asking Ronald Weasley for help was embarrassing, and he was sure even the reflection in the mirror laughed at him or at least thought he was mental. Draco had been practising different ways to
The whole reason (from Draco’s point of view) for why Ronald Weasley was in Draco’s apartment right now was because Draco—who definitely wasn’t desperate—needed him to solve the mystery of his boyfriend. Harry seemed to have disappeared from the surface of the earth. He had stopped replying to Draco’s emails after Draco had drunk-written Harry again, and the wizard couldn’t simply be angry because of
that sofa is uncomfortable. My back kills me.” He yawned again, putting down Ozzy on the floor anyway as Draco threw him another glare. He stroked the cat over its back before raising his arms above his head, stretching, then moving his hand to massage his lower back.
“Well…” Draco had no answer to that. He really didn’t, because he couldn’t understand how Weasley wasn’t pacing back and forth with him, just as worried.
Ron and Hermione sent each other silly things like that all the time, and Harry wanted to send them too. Now, when he was going away on a longer mission, he had seized his chance.
computer. Ozzy was in his lap too, and Weasley hadn’t objected or pushed the cat away. That was surprising, actually, and Draco couldn’t help but wonder what Granger would do if she saw that. He knew very well that Weasley hadn’t been very fond of that giant ball of ginger fur--Harry had told him all the stories.
“Wanted to surprise you,” Harry said, grinning at him, unable to mask the happiness Draco himself hid so well.
Okay, truth be told, he was, perhaps, addicted to it. There was a slight chance that might be the case.
Draco didn’t care much for Christmas or New Year’s, but the anxiety of being alone while everyone else celebrated with their loved ones was almost unbearable. His stomach churned with worry; would he be able to handle the holidays by himself?
Harry had a faint memory that his cousin Dudley had had a computer, not that he was ever allowed near it unless the Dursley's weren't home and Harry, if he was lucky, could sneak into Dudley's room. It felt brilliant to have a computer of his own now when he was an adult, and he was so happy his best friends had one each as well. Harry had looked so much forward to initiate Draco into the world of computers, and he'd been fantasising about all the quirky love notes he would send. Draco would say he hated them, but Harry knew he'd secretly love them.
Because talk they would. Once Weasley went home to his sad little flat, Draco sure as hell had several things to say to Potter.
"And that's how it works!" Harry grinned. "Of course, I'll walk you through this more in-depth later…" He said the last part in a much lower voice, right into Draco's ear.
“We should email each other!” Harry said, with all the energy and excitement of a first-year on a sugar quill. He gestured eagerly to the brilliant Muggle device in front of them that had Draco frowning.
“What if I do?” He whispered before finally claiming Harry’s lips in a soft kiss. It quickly became hungry and intense; it had been such a long time since their last one—possibly a million years. Harry softly gripped Draco’s arm, holding on while Draco passionately kissed him, enjoying Harry’s helpless little moan that he couldn’t stop from coming out as their tongues met. It appeared that Harry might have missed him too, just as much as Draco had missed him. The warm, fuzzy feeling of sheer joy twisted his stomach, making Draco almost desperate to spread wings and fly because he could barely contain himself when Harry ran a hand up his leg, up his thigh, reaching the buttons of his trousers, his fly—
“I can’t believe you’re not worried,” Draco said, coming to a halt in front of the redhead. “You should be.
It ached badly; when they a few minutes later left the classroom, Harry couldn’t deny that fact any longer. He had almost forgotten about it as Malfoy and Snape had distracted him, but now when he walked up to the hospital wing with Malfoy several feet ahead of him, Harry gritted his teeth to cope with the sharp pain. Draco said something, but Harry leant against one wall before they even managed to get out of the dungeons. He was just going to stay there for a little while, maybe Malfoy would grow tired of it and then they could just silently agree on that he took Harry to madam Pomfrey. While in reality, Harry would go there by himself because he couldn’t really do this in the presence of the Slytherin. After all, if he hadn’t been so distracted by him and his looks and the way he moved, he wouldn’t be in this situation.
"How many times do I have to tell you? You would've heard something then," Ron continued, still sitting in Draco's chair and still stroking the peacefully sleeping Ozzy in his lap. "An Auror would've shown up here and told you the news. They know you two are together. You're listed as his next of kin for Merlin's sake."
“What? Merlin, no, I didn’t! Didn’t mean to…to violate you, why’d you say that?!” Harry said, horrified, blushing an ugly shade of red. “Look, Draco, I can explain everything!”
Saturday morning rolled around and brought a bright sun that shone right on Draco’s face the minute he carefully opened his eyes. Both Draco and Harry had forgotten to pull the curtains last night, apparently, and the light did nothing to ease the headache he currently had. Draco groaned inwardly, lifting his head the tiniest bit from the pillow, only to have his head fall back onto the soft material again.
Two hours later, Draco woke up to the smell of fried eggs and coffee, and the first thing he saw was a Harry with wild, sleep-tousled hair. Harry was in a good mood, tossing the hangover potion to Draco as he went into the bedroom. Draco took the vial gratefully in hand; it was like Potter
Draco was in such deep sleep that he didn't wake up when the door to his bedroom was opened slowly, and somebody entered, walking soundlessly across the carpeted floor. There was a gentle creak as the very somebody climbed in the bed and lay down next to him. The somebody lay there silent and still for a few seconds before an arm slowly curled around Draco's waist beneath the covers. Then the very somebody proceeded to edge even closer to the sleeping form of Draco Malfoy, nuzzling the nape of Draco's neck, inhaling his scent. It smelt a bit like lemon and remnants of alcohol from the previous night. Lips pressed against soft, pale and sleep-warm skin, moving rather boldly to continue their quest of kissing the side of Draco's neck, the outer shell of his ear, sliding over his jawline to eventually reach his mouth, where they gently pressed a kiss to Draco's always perfect, soft lips. One kiss became two,
He needed Hermione Granger. Harry knew Draco didn’t want Hermione’s help either, but he couldn’t snap at her like he could at Harry anymore and especially not with Ron present. So Harry pretended to go to the bathroom and sent Hermione a secret Patronus.
So yes, Potter was the main--only--reason he had asked Weasley to come. Alone too. He could never have Granger in his household; Draco thought she would have been too curious about why Draco was the way he was right now. Or say something reasonable that Draco wouldn't be able to hear right now--he was closer than he liked to admit to putting up missing posters on every available surface outside. Plus, he knew Potter was closer to Weaselbee anyway, even though Draco didn't like to think about it. Weasley made his head hurt.
Harry was pretty fond of the computer. He had had his for about three months, and he and Ron had fun emailing each other. Hermione sent Harry emails too, but she wasn’t as fun as Ron. Ron sent funny pictures, completely in love with what the Internet had to offer. It was a whole world inside one machine.
Three hours later, Harry rubbed his temples, feeling frustrated. He had yelled, Draco had yelled, even Draco's three cats had had their fair share of opinions. Insults had been exchanged, and Draco had sent the computer mouse flying twice through the dining room with the help of his wand.
His brows furrowed in concentration, and Harry couldn't take his eyes off him. He could stare forever, just drown in that perfect image, and…
"Hey, wanna do something fun?" Ron suddenly asked out of the blue before Draco could open his mouth to object. It had got dark outside, and inside Draco's dining room, the bright Christmas lights from the tree glowed red and green, casting a horrible glow to Ron's infuriatingly orange hair.
“Go away, Malfoy,” Harry said, trying his best to sound threatening but it didn’t come out the way he wanted. Merlin, Draco was so
“Maybe because you never let him catch his breath,” Weasley suggested, scanning Draco’s inbox. “You’ve written a shit ton of emails, mate. I mean, I don’t think I’ve ever written this many in my entire life. I’m not even sure Hermione has, or we have combined. How many are they?” He tried counting them, but quickly gave up, noting that it was “bloody never-ending.”
"What am I doing here, Malfoy?" Weasley asked again after a few moments of silence. "Why did you send me emails, practically shouting for me to come?" He shook his head. "Blimey, this computer-thing has turned you mental…"
“Thank you…” Harry mumbled, cheeks tinting pink. He looked at his newly repaired wound in astonishment; there was only a pink scar there now and no blood. Truth be told, Draco had done an excellent job. Harry flexed his fingers slowly, feeling how the skin around the scar strained a bit. It was a strange feeling.
“Merry Christmas, Draco,” Harry said in a low voice, kissing the top of his head. He didn’t say anything, but he knew that Draco was happy that he was back home even if he had a hard time showing it. Well, a hard time showing it until Draco without warning lifted his head and clashed their lips together before taking Harry to his bed and showing him
“Well, that makes a lot more sense.” Draco smiles. “So I can hold your hand in the middle of wizarding London and no one would be the wiser?”
Harry obligingly stands while Hermione looks him over. Her hand appears in the Floo and she spins one finger, so he rotates in a circle for her, as well.
“I’ll talk with him tomorrow, and we can try to set something up for him either at Hogwarts or starting over Easter.”
Tears spring to Harry’s eyes, and he squeezes Draco’s hand, looking over at him. Draco’s eyes are also bright.
“We talked about it today while we were shopping. James says you’ve been alone for too long and he likes that you have a…what do you call Draco again?”
“Scorpius has been asking for one for years at this point. He claims it will help him keep in touch with me, even though they’re not permitted at Hogwarts.” Draco rolls his eyes. “I have some co-workers who use them often, as well.”
“Quite huge. I’m also having a lot of hip pain and more of that pressure down low.” He shifts again under the blankets. “I’m having more trouble sleeping, as well, just because I can’t get comfortable. And when I do, this one decides to use my organs as trampolines. I’ve spent a few nights in the chair when nothing else works.”
Keeping his eyes focused on his plate, Harry exhales heavily. “I think I might have feelings for someone.” Harry chances a quick look at Hermione, just in time to see her eyes widen slightly.
“Sure!” James pushes away from the table and everyone else follows. Lily hurries to start pulling blankets and extra pillows from the chest behind the couch and passing them to Matthew, who lays them out on the couches and chairs. Draco starts levitating furniture so everyone will be able to see the screen.
Draco’s tongue begins a steady rhythm of thrusts in and out of Harry, and a hand snakes around his hips to allow fingers to caress his rock-hard erection and tug at his balls.
Warmth floods Harry’s body. How on earth can one person make him feel so…cherished? Returning the smile, Harry takes a deep breath.
“You know me well.” He can never put anything past Hermione, and thank goodness for that, because it’s kept him out of trouble more than once.
Harry hugs Al and stands. “I’m going to go see how the unpacking is going, but Draco ordered dinner and it should be here in an hour or so.”
Harry is startled by his own internal musings. No ‘falling.’ No ‘could.’ Just ‘love.’ He loves him, and he can’t find any argument in his mind to the contrary.
“That’s an excellent aspiration, Matthew,” Draco smiles. Harry knows that Draco initially wanted to go into law, as well. Unfortunately, no one would accept him given his past, and he had to choose a different goal. He’s fulfilled now with his potions career, but Harry suspects he sees a lot of himself in Matthew and is eager to support him.
“Still better. I hate the bedrest, but it’s helped. James, will you call for Draco, please? He’s in the study.” James shifts to go find Draco but pauses when the man in question comes through the door.
“Scorp and I wondered if it might happen,” Al confesses. “You seemed like you might go well together. I’m ok with it.”
“Low back again, but it’s starting to wrap around my belly.” Harry looks to James. “Would you Floo Healer Carr and tell her it’s not an extreme emergency, but I think I need to be checked over?”
Harry swallows. “That’d be great; I’ll just pop this in the player.” Harry puts the wine down on the table and busies himself with the DVD player while Draco shelves the movies.
Lily comes thundering down the stairs as quickly as she’d gone up them and thrusts a DVD case into her dad’s hands.
“No. I don’t even remember the last time I used my wand. Maybe over the holiday, when we were decorating for Christmas?”
“I’m really glad you’re happy, Dad. We were all kind of worried about you being alone when we all went to Hogwarts.”
Malfoy nods in understanding and observes Harry with a look of gentle expectation. Harry lets his eyes fall closed briefly as he sorts his emotions from the basic facts about the situation. He still rages when he lets it get the better of him, but this is neither the time nor place for that.
The kiss makes Harry weak at the knees. Through it, he feels not only his magic contentedly running alongside Draco’s, but also a pulse of what he can only describe as love rushing through him.
been in a relationship like this. It scares the shit out of me. But it’s wonderful and I want it to last and I want
“I would be quite pleased if it was Matthew. He’s a wonderful young man. But I’d still rather not be a grandfather before you graduate.”
Harry reaches across the table and covers one of Hermione’s hands with his own. “Do you still miss Ron?”
“Mm-hmm,” Harry smiles and closes his eyes. Harry has been pleased with how easily he and Draco bridged from friends to dating and he’s even more thrilled with how compatible they seem to be sexually. Harry had been afraid reality wouldn’t live up to his fantasy and instead, it seems to be even better.
“Merlin, yes, please. It’s been almost a month, Draco. Just because I was too sick for us to do anything, doesn’t mean I haven’t wanted it. I’ve missed you.”
“We would love that.” Draco’s voice is thick. Harry can do little more than nod in confirmation. Healer Carr’s wand begins to move again and she stops to highlight and measure tiny arms and spine and legs, before settling on the area in question.
“No, she’s a Ravenclaw, like her mum.” Blaise shakes his head. “She’s very bright, but she doesn’t have a cunning bone in her body.”
Harry turns to his stomach and adjusts himself comfortably, face down on top of his forearms. He hears the button on Draco’s jeans pop open and the soft purr as the zipper falls, then the soft rustle of fabric as Draco divests himself of his clothes. He feels Draco straddle his body and then settle on his arse.
“Daddy!!!” Lily immediately dashes for her dad when she and Draco appear in the living room. Draco smiles as Harry wraps his arms around his daughter.
