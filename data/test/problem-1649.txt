"Oh, Harry," Andromeda said, standing in the door. "How nice to see you." She didn’t budge from the doorway. "I thought you were coming Thursday."
None of this made any sense: the urgency of Harry needing Draco like this, a piano bench where there was better, softer furniture steps away, how this satisfied even though it was the type of directionless, desperate fumbling he hadn't done in years. Draco, with that surprising strength, stood up and dumped them on the armchair, which expanded so Harry could lean back against Draco's chest.
Having run out of expensive stuff to buy his friends and family in the last few years, he bought a Wizarding hammam-style spa day for Andromeda and Molly, a lecture series with a pilot for Arthur, a voucher for international Portkey travel for most of the adults, and so many toys for the kids that Hermione started giving out her extendable gift bags every year in anticipation.
You pointed at the wall behind you, the building on the corner of the street. I couldn’t see the entrance, but from the window, it was a cafe. The one near home, the one I had taken Ron and Hermione to. “I work here. You?”
"You're not. But whoever is making you this happy? You should keep him around." Then Oliver flicked Harry’s nose, and there was a bit of a tussle as Harry flicked him right back on the ear, which Oliver hated.
"You're on the bench for the next away match. I was supposed to wait until we were there to announce it. I won't do that," Coach said to him, after pulling him aside at training. "Some team investors were not happy with your writing."
“I love you,” he says. And then, repeats, as if Draco could have misunderstood. “I love you, Draco Malfoy.”
No, they haven’t. Draco can’t even imagine what is going on in Harry’s head right now, though he’s tried to, more than once. Draco can’t really relate to his seventeen year old self anymore, not in a way that resonates with what Harry must be feeling.
His own socks rest on the floor; Harry used to prise them off Draco’s feet and heat them with his own hands.
The moon’s dazzling light radiates through the magnificent windows, hitting everything Draco’s left forgotten and hidden inside this place.
exhausted, which is no surprise considering how late it is. His schedule at St Mungo’s gets worse by the day, something expected for a person training to be a healer and on the path to deciding which specialty to undertake. If he hadn’t moved in with Harry and quit his job at Camden (though he had been coerced into it), Draco isn’t sure he would’ve managed the hours and providing for himself. That Harry worries about his coffee and eating habits is certainly a bonus.
"And hunters like trophies. Honestly." Harry shifted too far forward trying to make sure the bird bath sat straight on the ground and kicked the stone base. The pain was enough to sting, but he could tell there was no real damage except to his pride as Draco watched him hop around.
The days are getting hotter, and since neither of them feels like hot drinks, they both decide to rest under the shadow of a tree, surrounded by the laughter of the children playing around them and the scent of fresh grass.
"Who’s Constantine?" Harry tried to ask neutrally, but he didn’t make a habit out of kissing other people’s boyfriends and didn’t want to have started last night.
Harry’s grip eases, and he takes a step back, lips slack with surprise. Draco doesn’t let him go, arms enveloping him and pulling him closer still, as his soul screams,
Two weeks later, Draco finds himself in front of a cafe near their flat where he’s arranged to meet his mother. As he stares at her figure behind the windows, he ponders if it was the best choice to refuse Harry’s offer to accompany him. He needs to do this alone, though. He
Harry hugs him with promises of “I’m here, babe” and “It’s okay,” while holding his shaking body. Harry doesn’t say he’s not going anywhere and Draco doesn’t ask him to. They’re both too terrified of the truth to acknowledge it, it seems.
Words are not enough to translate the feeling of the lump in his chest where Draco’s heart should be beating. He gapes at Harry, who stares back, unaware of Draco’s internal turmoil.
Harry was in the hotel lobby before he heard a familiar voice call "Potter!" He turned around and there was Viktor Krum.
glances back in mournful silence, as if Draco isn’t here, or if he isn’t worthy of an answer. He insists, cold tears burning his cheeks. “Why did you take him from me? Take me to him! Please! Don’t let—”
familiar, or because he’s spent the last half hour searching every cabinet for a mug for his coffee.
"You’ve been doing a wonderful job with the house, and I don’t mean to rush you. You’ve also taken the time to explain a lot about the magic and my family’s things…and I know you don’t…it’s…" Harry trailed off. He snapped his mouth shut.
There were more commemorative plates for weddings, memorials, and births; some for family, some for presumed friends. He recognised last names too: Meadowes, Longbottom, Nott, and even Weasley.
"No, it’s where you do flips and tricks on the ground," Harry tried. Coach dismissed this comparison with a hand wave.
“They are possibly kind of okay with you now,” Harry rectifies, smiling up at him. “And Teddy and Luna definitely love you. I don’t—This feels right, Draco. Don’t you think?”
Pansy’s magic slips to envelop Harry’s head, assessing his brain and cognitive functions. Draco examines her work with interest, even though he’s not been Harry’s Healer for years now. He does not notice Harry’s eyes doing the same.
to each other whenever Harry shows up. Harry always says it was nice seeing him when he leaves, and Draco’s always left with an annoying buzzing in his chest.
"So I said ‘they wield quite a bit of power politically because of how Wizengamot seats are distributed traditionally, even with reforms’, and she said, ‘Ah so, they are all rich enough that no one can say different.’"
When Harry stumbles into him again two days later, as Draco’s walking to an appointment, he’s not that surprised somehow. He tells Harry a bit about what he knows from his travels. Harry listens attentively and disappears again when Draco’s finished.
When Harry woke up the next morning, the house appeared lighter somehow. Harry walked the floors. The curtains were the same, the walls covered in the same dingy wallpaper. There was no more light coming through the skylight than normal, but something about the house felt more inviting.
Harry opens his mouth a few times before actual words slip through his lips, throaty from disuse, filled with rage. “Get. Out… Of here.”
"I’ll see you when you’re fully healed and not a second before. Rest. Stretch. Water," Harry said, not willing to abandon his Captain persona.
Draco hasn’t smoked since he first started the therapy group, but he grabs the cigarette anyway, lets Potter light it and brings it to his lips. This feels too important, and he can’t quite say why.
Harry went flying first. He could skip a few days here and there, but he reserved that for when he was ill or the weather was awful. He would lose the precision in his seat if he didn't get on a broom every day. It was nothing to grab his two-way Portkey to the Hyde Park regulation pitch once he'd put on his training gear.
The Hogwarts Express stands beside them on the tracks. It’s so still and silent, Draco doubts for a second that it's really there. There’s no colour to it. The vivid red of the cars that his childish mind worshipped for years is now a pallid grey.
"In my first season about ten years ago, Montague left the Wasps in the middle of the season," Harry said. Draco nodded. "It wasn’t an injury. He was fine. The real reason that he was fired is that the
Its towering trunk rises to the sky, still as huge as in his memory. However, it’s now naked, darkened by desolation. The small circle of stones surrounding its base had been destroyed many years ago. If it was still intact, it’d be buried deep in the snow that blankets the tree in a dull white.
"You’ll have to keep playing the piano here," Harry tried to joke around the lump in his throat. "It’d be a shame to have it just sit here."
"He’s really the only person who can help you with this, don’t mess around with him." Hermione was furrowing her brow.
How can he keep going after losing everything? The question almost escapes his lips. Instead, Draco nuzzles her back until his own stench starts to bother him, and the need to shower becomes too loud to ignore for the first time in days.
Harry tips his head to the side, staring intently at Draco. “They said you are the one who cured me.” He doesn’t say it with all the words, but Draco is sure Harry knows he died for him.
"If you mean to pass it on as a house and not a headache for Teddy, you’ll want it. Even if you don’t, if you don’t restore the house, it’ll fade and disappear."
And he rereads them one by one, as he adjusts himself  inside the tub, turning the temperature of the water to scalding and letting it burn his skin, hoping it might peel off  his pain.
If by that she means she’s been busy with Harry’s return, Draco understands. He knows she’s here because of the divorce in the papers, most likely, and all the other hurtful headlines about Draco. He suddenly wishes she could have, indeed, come earlier, but he’s determined not to resent Harry for that.
He shouts instructions on autopilot, before he even has time to rationalise what’s really happening. Draco’s losing Elle, and he’s not prepared for that.
Draco understood why it wasn’t working, and why they needed that time, but he also didn’t want to be alone. He wanted Harry close to him, where he could touch him, hug him, soothe his fears.
“Nothing,” she replies, but it doesn’t appease him. Pansy sighs. “Nothing. Just, what would he come here so much for? He told me he hates St Mungo’s.”
Draco chuckles, nodding. “At the time, I thought I wouldn’t get another chance with you. That was it. I had my shot, and had lost it.”
And Draco can relate to that. He is uncomfortable with the amount of pity cast in his direction whenever he goes out. He stopped frequenting magical parts of London, relenting to walk his own neighbourhood.
Draco’s grin falters, his fingers grip harder. “You’re not dead, Harry.” He shakes his head vehemently. “You’re alive, my love. You’re in a coma.”
Rather than dwell on this, Harry decided to take a page out of Draco’s book as he ascended the stairs and forgo greetings.
Draco pulls away from Elle, hands falling limply on his sides. He's not ready to say it, but this is the last thing he can do for her. So, he forces the words out through the thick lump in his throat. “Time of death…”
"Remember the thing about my house?" Harry asked. "I need another favour. Are you still friends with Malfoy?"
"I understand a project of this complexity is frustrating. I assure you, although it seems like progress is slow, you will see results soon," Draco said. His tone was professional.
Despite Harry’s warning, Draco croons against his nape as he climbs up the mattress. Harry grumbles absently, but creeps closer, pressing his back to Draco’s chest, so open and pliant Draco’s heart does a loop. Harry treats him as if he’s worthy of it all; his dinners, his trust, even his warnings.
"Here is your story. Some of your grandfather’s things went to your parents’ house in Godric’s Hollow. The rest went to the Lupin home. Then, on November 15, 1981, someone broke into the Lupin home and stole what was left in there. With no master left in residence, the house couldn’t defend itself."
He finishes his soup and pushes the bowl away, before the words escape through gritted teeth. “To summarise, he wanted to be free to bang people, especially since it would surely end up in the papers.”
It doesn’t matter, because Harry is here, holding Draco. There’s hope, there’s life again. Draco will find a solution for Harry’s curse, and things will be alright. Everything will be fine.
"She said, if she wrote the letter, it would include much more colourful language." Harry grinned. "Also her fee is calculated before deductions by the League."
it?” Harry repeats incredulously. “I love it. It’s the perfect house, Draco. It has everything. And it’s within our budget.”
Draco’s brain supplies, but he shakes the thought away. It’s too late to be hopeful, and he’s tired of trying.
part in each other's lives now. The thought comforts Draco, but it doesn’t seem to have the same effect on Harry.
She can’t finish her sentence for the same reason Draco can’t, for the life of him, come up with any happy scenario for his future with Harry while Harry still has no memories. Harry hates him.
He caught Pansy and Percy in the hallway coming back in, Pansy with her face tilted up to Percy, hand on his bearded cheek. He was rubbing her shoulder and murmuring in her ear something too low for Harry to catch. They looked so fond of each other Harry felt more embarrassed than if he caught them kissing.
You came to me again, and I didn’t run away. Luna glanced at me once, but seeing my reassuring grin, she traded us for a corner with a girl who had been tailing her since we first stepped in.
“That reminds me of something, Draco! You’re lucky you’re not the one with no memory, or I’d say you were trying to get out of our bet.”
The first stop every season was with the Healers, and they each followed their assigned Healer to a station set up with blinders on either side of a treadmill. Harry ran, pleased enough with his speed while they waved their wand, breathed into a potion that turned a pleasant bright blue affirming his lung function was optimal. The body scan turned up light inflammation, standard for yesterday’s workout.
His fingers clench around his abdomen, the nauseating feeling of loss and helplessness growing inside of him. Draco barely registers the need to throw up, and almost doesn’t make it into the bathroom fast enough to dispel whatever he’s eaten today in the toilet. His retching echoes against the tiles, a disgusting noise filling his whirling head. He sobs and hopes he can release some of the ugliness inside him, along with the food. Draco wonders if his heart might come out now and decides quickly he doesn’t need it. He doesn’t want to carry it anymore.
"Didn’t make plans in time," Harry said. Not that it was an excuse. He could. Draco hummed a little. They parted with well-wishes, and Draco said he would return January third.
“It’s impossible to know,” Draco says, and shudders as the words hang in the air, heavy and loaded. She should know—she’s married to Harry’s Healer. She should know, but she still hopes anyway. Draco can’t hold onto that kind of hope when he’s already lost
"Just because it's old doesn't mean you should keep it," Draco said. "I know that’s funny coming from me."
Harry grumbled but he wanted this tapestry in the library dealt with, and Draco had already spent an inordinate amount of time on this project as it was.
Harry ran a hand over the sheets again. He was too tired to change them. It was late, anyway. He could spell them clean to return.
"Like a poltergeist?" Ron asked. He thought about it for a moment. "No, you’re not even there most of the year." Ron would know. He had left the Auror force after a few years because he found the Ministry hard to stomach, but he dealt with Dark magic more recently than Harry.
Harry gets up and immediately opens one cabinet, bringing a plain blue mug to Draco. He had filled his cupboards with new mugs, plates, and other utensils that had been broken in his fit of rage. He still misses the old ones, and wonders absently if Harry seems so familiar with his house’s organisation because it
Harry’s apologies never leave Draco, and he has to ignore how mad they make him feel. It’s not Harry’s fault. None of it is. And Draco can’t be mad at him, no matter how the shock of that request still has him reeling on his feet.
Draco finally understands why Marvin thought they could be good to each other, and why Potter reminded him of Draco. Potter, not unlike Draco, is paralysed by guilt and grief that shouldn’t live in a person so young; a pain so strong that it's hard to separate it from who they are.
By the time he gets to St Mungo’s the next morning, head pounding at the absence of Hangover Potion—all the ones he had home were used the weeks previous in Draco’s attempts at drinking himself to oblivion—and a glare capable of decimating anyone who crossed his path, he’s given up remembering the entire night. Draco woke up in his recently restored bedroom this morning, and he trusts Blaise enough to know things couldn’t have escalated too badly—the lack of news about his drunkenness in the morning papers is also a great reassurance.
Harry’s eyes are so wide, the white in them glows in the darkness. He stays silent for so long, Draco wonders if he’ll say something.
"I’ll still write the letter. I don’t care about the fine at all, and I might as well do something good if the League is going to complain no matter what." Harry said.
Harry had never had an argument like this before. They understood each other. Draco kept writing Harry and visiting. It almost felt normal, like they had bypassed the fight. They even had sex once when Draco came to check a reference in the house library. Except afterwards, when Harry had almost murmured how he felt, Draco heaved a sigh and got dressed.
Hope lodges inside Draco slowly, crashing against his heart painfully. He allows it, because it’s been too long since he’s last felt it. Draco
"If you wish," he paused dramatically, "to smoke filthy, disgusting cigarettes. Might I suggest doing it on our grounds and not in the toilets at 3 o’clock, rousing your entire House from their slumber?"
He looked around the sleek room, with its glass doors, ferns, and abstract splashes of red. There had been a controversy when she first moved in here that her office was offensively Muggle and ruining the character of Diagon Alley, which Harry became aware of about five years ago when a
“I don’t know what you mean,” Draco replied, dismissively, turning to leave the stable and the conversation. He had tried very hard not to make friends, intent on absorbing all he could to take home to his father.
Harry had thought the little narrow path in the bare back garden was the only green space in the house. Now there was this little wild, lush patch of land heavily scented with citrus and honeysuckle and full to the brim with small bushes he didn’t recognise from Hogwarts or gardening as a kid. He was going to have to call Neville to check out the plants. The garden wasn’t big enough to fly in, but he loved it. Harry left it off the list for removal for Draco, which included the garage for flying carpets, the ballroom, the third parlour, and the galley for house-elves.
Mrs Weasley stays until night falls. The scent of food permeates the house, but it doesn’t last long, and soon the joyfulness of her presence fades into the hole Draco’s been digging up in his life. He’s eaten enough to be full, but he still feels empty and nauseous.
Now Draco was the one whose voice caught when he went to answer. "Yes, I’m going to—" Harry nipped his neck a few times, and Draco came all over his hand, gasping. Harry sat down heavily next to him, leaning on Draco’s shoulder. Draco cleaned them both with another wordless gesture, and Harry pulled his pants back up, feeling both uncertain and exhilarated.
It’s been only a few years. She shouldn’t have aged so much. The urge to take care, to nourish her surges inside him. Father had made him promise, long before Hogwarts, the Dark Lord and the war, that he’d always protect his mother. He had failed his promise. He had let her down.
"You’re friends with Draco, aren’t you?" Harry asked, putting his mug down on the table. It seemed without Harry noticing, Draco had infiltrated Harry’s entire friend group.
Draco doesn’t push it, resigned to observe Harry from his spot on the couch, now thankful for the distance between their bodies, as Harry flips the pages of the album Draco had put together many years ago. He tries not to stare too much, but fails so miserably that when Harry feels his gaze on him and lifts his head to direct a smile at Draco, he feels his cheeks burning.
He’s shaking slightly as he approaches the old building. Draco’s now used to its tacky pillars rising to the ceiling and the too bright yellow facade, though he had hated it the first time he stepped into the place. The blinding yellow has become a welcoming balm against his eyes, now contrasting with the heavily clouded sky.
Having dealt with many difficult patients over the years, Draco’s become one of the best in his field. And Elle, along with Harry, are definitely the most complex ones he’s had.
"It’s New Year’s Eve," Draco said, as if this was supposed to mean something to Harry. "My friends are going out." Harry stared back, puzzled. "I wanted to see if you want to come."
I winked at her, before tugging your hand. “Let’s go, then, and when we come back I’ll show you what else I can handle.”
“He could have just left a bigger piece of paper for a note, the bugger,” Draco mutters under his breath, but there’s a smile on his face. He is often confronted with those sticky notes around the house, and he can’t help but find it endearing, the way Harry gets attached to objects like his little yellow pad or his mug.
to be someone else for one night. You could use charms, polyjuice (as long as the hair in the potion was muggle) or anything you’d like, but the magic in the place would shift your appearance to how you truly felt — regardless of whether you liked it, thus overwhelming you.
But when he thought of those dark months of insomnia and nightmares and chest pain, he never thought of those things first. He remembered finding out Oliver had told Assistant Coach Jurgen Harry was unwell, because he worried. Harry had been furious with Oliver, because it was the only emotion he could whip up with any reliability. Harry promised to see someone. He went to mandatory appointments during training. He remembered the tick of the clock in the first Healer’s office. He remembered being terrified everyone was lying and that Quidditch would be ripped away from him. He had never been that badly off again. But he marked that time in headlines.
“It’s okay. I don’t mind. There’s no pain here,” Harry says. “Ruby came once. She stayed for a while, more than the others. We played until she had to leave.”
"I hear you. I'll try to…" But Harry was cut off by Draco kissing him lightly. His heart jumped at Draco's hand running along his wrists and sides. Draco had been blazingly jealous, Harry realised. He was trying and failing to keep it under wraps, hiding behind the bite of sarcasm.
It was a solid half hour before Harry saw the glint hovering down at the grass and sped for it. He ducked the Bludger aimed at him but it grazed him as it ricocheted back with a flare of dull burning pain. It had been a risky move even before a Bludger had nicked him. He pulled out of the dive so fast that he could feel the dew from the grass blow back on him.
Draco’s head jerks to the side, his grimace directed at whoever interrupted them in his lunch break—though his glare is diminished by the satisfaction of hearing his name in the voice of the intruder Mediwitch. Draco had made a point of having everyone at St Mungo’s calling him by his new surname, since taking Harry’s name at their wedding. It’s got a nice ring to it that doesn’t seize to amaze him.
"No need. I understand," Draco said. Draco offered a handshake, and Harry took it even though it felt like a weirdly formal gesture. Draco’s hand was warmer than he expected.
Harry doesn’t bring the bond up again when he meets Draco. And he meets Draco so often it feels like they’re always together. Draco doesn’t question his motives for coming to St Mungo’s this time, he knows Harry is there mostly to see him and he revels in having his attention all to himself.
The quiet stretches between them for a while, and Draco finishes his bowl. He reaches tentatively for another.
Draco gave the portrait a much harder jab of his wand with a complicated wiggle at the end, and she fell silent once again.
Ron didn’t seem surprised by Harry's question at all. He let out a sigh and flopped onto the floor, gesturing for Harry to join him. Harry did. He could have swore that the hallways were wider when they were younger. Harry unravelled the raw edge of the hall runner.
Second, and most shocking, he learned that most people can’t see thestrals. It had never occurred to him to think otherwise, since every stable hand, every breeder and potential buyer, every jockey and trainer, even his mother and father, could all see them.
He gulps down the fear. “Yes, that’s right. There’s something I need to tell you, Harry, about the day you woke up,” Draco starts, as steadily as he can, when all he hears is his heart thumping loudly in his ribcage. “What do you know about your curse?”
Something about the plea undid Harry. The idea of Draco reduced to single words was heady. If Harry had more patience, maybe he would see if there was a point where Draco lost speech entirely. But Harry only paused to breathe through his nose before taking Draco further down his throat.
Draco sighs against warm lips, and settles by Harry’s side. He whispers, before sleep takes over him, and he’s not sure Harry hears, but Draco’s sure Harry knows. “I learned from you… the courage to stay.”
They lapsed into silence. Harry found himself watching Draco as he talked to Greg. Draco was being quiet and gentle, and he wasn’t gesturing as much as he normally did when speaking. It was like he had turned down the volume on his personality.
“It will never work because you don’t want it to!” Harry snaps, at the same time the window shatters. The patterns of the cracks create strange forms on the floor, lit up by the light coming from the street.
Harry does tell him. He seems distracted enough that the change of subject slides between them easily. He tells Draco about the time he spent with Charlie Weasley in Romania, and Draco laughs when he realises what ‘
"Your mother was a much better pianist than I have ever been." But dutifully, he bent his head, squinted and pushed his glasses back up his nose. Draco played with more care before the melody collapsed underneath his fingers, and he gave up, taking his hands off the keys.
"You could come along if you wanted?" Harry asked. He didn’t know why he asked. But sometimes parents and friends of the players came to watch. "Teddy will be there."
"Not sure I’d leave my Gran there if it looked like this," Harry quipped. But the house had been a cocoon from the world when he needed it.
He thought everything would be okay when he found Harry trapped in Limbo and brought him back. But nothing’s okay. He should be happy he’s awake now, and he has a chance to live again. Yet, he can’t shake the feeling of loss settling in his chest and wonders if that’s how Harry felt throughout all of those years. Is that his curse? Being forever lost and alone?
His mind draws a blank as he averts his eyes to a crack on the floor. He can still feel Potter’s gaze on him, his magic crackling and electric, testing him,
After some more pleasantries and a promise to send season opener tickets for Diane, Harry left the fire, went back to the parlour, and gave it over to Draco without a single glance at the scroll.
"I'm easy," Harry said. But Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry as if he was being difficult. Draco didn’t accept that.
"So your opinion, as my friend, is that I’m a coward," Harry said. This bright, heavy feeling in his chest had to be anger.
But Draco can’t answer her. He can’t speak. His lips are numb and heavy. He takes a deep breath, and the air burns inside him. He can’t cry, not here. Not yet.
“I'm making an exception,” Marvin mutters, without raising his eyes from whatever he’s writing on the yellow pad.
Harry glances at him now, head tipped to the side, eyes dazed and distant. Draco tightens his grip, as if Harry might disappear if he blinks, if he’s not touching him. He doesn’t need to blink; he tells himself he’s not alive and movements as such are nothing but a reflex of a life he can’t leave behind. But Harry is here with him. That should be all that matters.
In the meantime, on the other side of Harry, Adrian was trying to wheedle Gemma into doing an impression.
“Fuck!” Draco curses, grabbing the object and throwing it away before anyone else can interrupt him.
It doesn’t matter, in the end. He smoked yesterday, and he knows he’s going to smoke again as soon as he gets out of this room.
"No, I need you around for that. I’ll finish sorting through this floor for anything dangerous and rebuild the wards."
Draco left a long note for Harry detailing the rebuilt wards and requesting a meeting to finalise them, so Harry cleared out some time on his schedule now that training camp was winding down.
The girl is a recurring patient, and she’s often directed to the same room in the Janus Thickey Ward where Draco—or Pansy, for a brief period—meets her. Alone.
"Nothing's wrong," Harry said. "I just found some of my parents' things, and it's been overwhelming."
He lifts the instrument, muscle memory aiding him in positioning it properly and playing the song he knows so well. His music fills the room, louder than the lyrics he now wishes he could forget, awaking memories that will never let him rest.
"I find most cake too sweet," Harry admitted. He had gone off sugar in recent years, as it gave him headaches if he had too much. Last time he ate treacle tart, he had to go lie down, which made him feel like someone’s maiden aunt.
They rest on the beach, fingers laced together, thighs pressing against one another as the waves smoothly wash the sand by their feet and the other shapeless shadows saunter unaware of their presence.
Harry is in his living room and this is a sight Draco had given up on witnessing again. Harry simply
Harry frowns for a second before he smiles and looks back at the book. “That’s nice. I like the violin, I think.”
"That I’d been to Azkaban, and it wasn’t pleasant, so I suggested returning them and saving themselves a trip," Draco said.
Draco snaps his head up, eyes finally meeting Harry’s, sending a shiver down his spine. He’s been so afraid to look at them, to see the rage that had fed them when they were younger. Though in this moment, all he sees there is the turmoil of confusion and grief. Rather, he
"Season’s good," Harry said. But there was something about the expectant look in Draco's eye that made Harry want to say more, so he told him about Coach’s attempt to make them master the new move without giving away what it was.
“Really?” Draco breathes out, Harry’s groin pressing against his, and he feels Harry’s grin against his skin as Harry slowly pushes his shirt up.
He made a point of checking on Atty again before leaving for the hotel. The Healers had taken care of the worst of the bruising. Her back looked tender and was hot to the touch, but she threw her arms around him.
From the moment Harry sat at the table, he knew that Theodore Nott did not like him in the slightest. He watched Harry like he was liable to steal the silverware and set fire to the carpet.
Draco beams at his veiled yes, and starts a list in his head of every coffee he knows Harry will love.
"I didn’t want one. I think they ruin the brick facade, and the building shouldn’t allow them," said Draco.
Draco’s arm itches with the urgency to hide it. He can’t do that. His mark is hidden under the sleeve of his shirt, but he can’t pretend it isn’t there.
This grants him Granger’s attention. She puts down her volume with more force than necessary. Draco recognises the cover as one of his father’s books about Celtic familial rituals. He remembers reading it a long time ago; he remembers longing to be a part of it.
it, hoping to see Harry, and whenever Harry stays long for too many days at a time, Draco ends up smoking a new pack of cigarettes.
Potter’s cheeks redden and he shoves his hands under his thighs, but his eyes never cease to find Draco’s.
Draco is sure all this food could feed an entire army, but he doesn’t say so, walking closely behind her.
Draco doesn’t want to be special. Not anymore. Not when being someone special meant he had to hurt people and watch people he loved getting hurt. He just wants to be no one, to fade into the background and disappear.
"Beautiful day to fly," Harry answered. They chatted for a moment before Harry kicked off with standard warm-up drills. He worked on a few basic manoeuvres and climbing speed. Grace practised diving again and again, and Harry watched her for a bit.
that person, somewhere inside, somewhere in his past. And part of him always will be. This Harry, who saved him a few weeks ago from Fiendfyre, who doesn’t know who Draco became, who hasn’t shared a life with him, has every right to resent him forever. He still can’t explain how his Harry fell in love with him in the first place.
His exchanges with his cousin have become somewhat scarce since Harry woke up, and that’s not something he can blame Teddy for. Draco’s the one who’s been avoiding anyone who’s had contact with Harry.
“I have many regrets, Draco,” she says gravely. “But the biggest one of them is that I have let pride impede my relationship with my son. I have lived with that pain, and shame, and the doubt that you would ever want to speak to me again.” She takes a deep breath. “I shouldn’t have pushed you. I should have protected you and cared for you when the world turned its back on us. I failed you as a mother.”
Draco pulls him closer in lieu of a reply, their bodies mingling under the covers, and Harry hums happily. His magic is always warm and comfortable, and Draco is not sure anymore how he’s supposed to feel without it.
"Yeah, sorry, I didn’t dress up or anything," Harry said. He wore black joggers and a black t-shirt, while both of them looked smart-ish, Seamus in a black polo and beige slacks, and Padma in turquoise robes pinned up in what looked like a complicated series of knots.
Harry’s voice is barely a whisper as he retracts his hand. His silhouette is poorly defined by the light coming out the curtain-less window of their room. “I need to tell you something.”
Harry felt there was something nice about waking up and knowing he only had to finish his morning workout. Draco was here, in the library. He was halfway between a set before he heard the piano again, clear as day.
Harry made a neutral noise. He could still feel Draco's steady gaze on him. No surprise there, as he'd spent all of school watching him and being watched; he was well familiar with the feeling. Harry went back to diligently scooping his magic into walls.
Harry gave Draco his favourite non-custom broom, Volta TX, a sleek olive wood Italian racing model. He couldn’t fly it much anyway since it would come with doom and gloom about the British broom industry if it came out Harry Potter favoured foreign make, especially with the complaints about the Falcons recruiting internationally.
“You mean still?” Harry nods. “Julie took it. That Muggle friend from your college. You had your friends over occasionally. That’s the biggest reason we moved into a Muggle neighbourhood, actually. This and to run away from the press, naturally.”
"We’re not doing this. Please unpack this in your next therapy session and not while your come is still dripping out of my—"
Janet finishes her story. Marvin says something to his right. And then Potter’s gaze is  on him again, heated and calculating.
Though it’s not the weekend yet, Marvin is there when Draco faces the familiar yellow walls again. The facade has been repainted, he notices distantly; it looks even brighter than ten years ago. Some windows have been changed for more modern frames. But the inside of the building looks exactly the same as it had the last time he came, albeit cleaner.
as well. You had wanted the same thing I did; you had had the same idea. Your face was different, something as disconcerting as relieving now, I noticed, watching your bushy brown hair, round features and thin lips. Despite that, I recognised the two bright moons beaming in the club’s lights, eyes that had been following mine for years, never really finding them.
“There’s nothing simple about it,” Draco pushes on. “How can you say you’re in love with me? Everything is different for you. You should despise me. This can be a part of the bond,” he concludes, shaking his head. Heart thumping so hard it's painful, creating a lump in his throat. “You might be experiencing feelings that are not yours.”
"You're a Kant," Draco said, leaning back in the seat. It seemed casual but somehow the toe of his loafer pulled Harry’s trouser leg up until Harry had to duck his head to hide his smile. "Honestly, what kind of Gryffindor nonsense is that? You are what you do."
"Half the time I want to fucking kill him, but he was also the first person to come around when my parents disowned me, and I don’t know what I’d do without him."
“Do you have anything to do now?” she asks, and Draco shakes his head. “I’m going to the centre. It’s been quite some time since you’ve been there, right?”
On Saturday night, the bond is more alive than Draco’s ever felt it. It’s whirring with anxiety and desperation. Draco knows Harry is here, in his house, before he hears the loud and anguished banging on the door. He opens it to face a bloodshot-eyed Harry on his doorstep, soaked and shaking from the cold rain outside.
Blaise had given him a cigarette last night. And he'd bought Draco several more drinks. So many that the night blurred into a mix of fading light and whispered songs Draco didn’t know.
He nods absently, shoving his nose against one interesting volume about house magic he’d been reading before the distraction. They’ve talked about it before, albeit never too seriously. However, when Harry says nothing else and Draco lifts his head from his place on the floor and finds Harry’s earnest eyes, he knows this time is for real.
Draco is panting as he makes his way through the corridor until his office door is in sight. He slides in, leaning against the door once it’s closed. It’s the only thing he can do not to fall to pieces in the middle of the hospital.
He averts his eyes from the screen of his phone—they'd ended up buying them with matching colours, Harry’s red and Draco’s green—where Harry’s last text missive stares at him: Drake, they don’t believe I ave the most gorgue. Gorgeous, amazing, if sometimes a prat, boyfriend in the world. Where are u? Come save me.
Things have been amicable. They haven’t interacted with each other since the day at Serendipity, and the only thing Draco got from Harry was the reply to his missive, stating that he had no intention of taking anything away from Draco. But he'd accept the ring.
It worries him, sometimes, that he has everything. That he can lose it all in the blink of an eye. But mostly when he catches Harry’s vacant gaze or his memory slips. And sometimes, when Draco’s own dreams are flooded with images of solitude and despair.
She cut through again. "How dare you, my blood and bone, turn this house against me! Silence me in my own home!"
Harry was always first out to the stadium with his black Captain’s armband secure around his left arm and his broom in his right. The crowd’s roar picked up. Harry used to wave, but stopped when he was accused of gloating. Still, his heart always fluttered and his belly swooped at the sounds of Falcons fans chanting.
Draco sighs with relief, taking a sip of his coffee. The bitterness burns his throat, awakens his body. He closes his eyes, welcoming it with a moan.
Elle was attacked by an insidious time curse, one so quiet she hadn’t noticed she was cursed at first. Although it’s different from Harry’s, Draco’s very sure about which curse was used. He can’t do much, for it has intertwined itself with her own magic and bones after too long without treatment. The spell had months to silently esconce her body and magic before she presented the first symptoms—which also made it almost impossible to identify her attacker.
Their relationship is splashed across the papers not a week later, with a picture of them carelessly kissing in the cafe near the centre, under the headline
"Oh, will you lighten the fuck up, Harry? Less Snape, more Lockhart please," Pansy said. Harry laughed genuinely then. Pansy smirked. "He is capable of smiling, Toni, don’t let him fool you."
"Falcons, we are going all the way to the finals. No question about it. It's been a great season, we've had great results. That ranking reflects some luck on our part but also hard work. And if we’ve worked this hard, I want everyone to see it through. I want everyone eating well and sleeping well and in top form. I want everyone to put it all in. We take home another banner, we'll be going down in history. No one has ever taken home a Cup two years in a row. Until now."
When the first letter accidentally falls in the water and the ink dissolves into streams of darkness on the surface, Draco’s grief tightens in his chest.
"What did you say to them?" Harry was…overwhelmed. Dragonhide satchel belonging to James Potter, rocking chair, three vases (Etruscan 19th century? read Draco’s annotation), horsehair mattress, set of thirteen elven-made goblets, Muggle linen chest, phoenix shaped diamond brooch belonging to Euphemia Potter and on and on.
"Oh, Diane is fine. She’s very busy at the clinic. Kids are driving me up the wall. They are both obsessed with some popstar this summer, and at this point I think I could be his understudy. Any chance you want to take them to a stadium tour? No? What can I do for you?"
"How did you even manage this?" he asked aloud. He felt silly when the house didn’t do anything in response.
Draco has avoided thinking about Harry and their situation. But now that he's convinced that the way to go is severing their bond, he’s trying to resume his research.
It is on Draco’s fourteenth morning of grieving since Harry woke, when Pansy finally shows up. He thought she’d come sooner, but he imagines she must be extremely busy treating the recently-woken Saviour of the Wizarding World, his husband. Not that he’ll ever admit that being alone affects him in any way, but Pansy is also a helpful supplier of information on Harry’s improvement.
"My apologies, Auror Zabini. I would like to report a theft." Harry was trying to keep his voice nice and even. Blaise leaned back in his chair and flicked a paper towards Harry with his wand.
"I have no opinion on this, I was an only child," Harry said. "I will spoil each one of your twenty future kids, although remembering their names after the first ten might get dicey."
Silence reigns in the room, and Draco takes it as a cue to continue. “That they’ll try to hurt me again, for what I’ve done. I couldn’t defend myself then, and I wouldn’t now. I knew how. I know how, but I...”
And then, Harry is pulling away suddenly as a crowd of young students run past them, almost stumbling into their bodies, shouting excitedly.
Once, he had gone on a handful of dates with a Muggle woman named Samantha right after Ginny. Having only been dumped once before, he hadn't seen it coming when she said, "the problem is, Harry, you're fundamentally incurious," and proceeded in that vein for a long hour until Harry decided he'd had enough and left her in the middle of the Pret in Angel Central.
"To make you feel bad," Harry said. He knew now not all damage was done with a closed fist or a harsh word.
"It's more complicated than that," Harry guessed. There was some clarity on how tricky very powerful magic was, even underneath all the theory.
"Interesting," Draco said. Draco looked at him now like he looked at everything else in the house—like something solvable, knowable.
But Hermione came back and was at her limit for emotional discussions. She proceeded to tell them over dinner about her current campaign about wand legislation for sentient magical beings.
Draco would be insulted if Harry asked him for an afternoon flying or to come to one of his matches to settle up his debt, though Harry wanted more than anything to impress Draco with his flying. Draco was all about significance and symbolism, as the past few months had more than proved.
Teddy demonstrated. Draco flicked his wand, and all the objects started orbiting the orange. Each planet spun on its axis and also at different speeds. The amount of fine control Draco demonstrated for this was impressive.
We shared a bed, a wall of cats nestle separating our bodies. Her body radiated comfortable warmth beside me, and it was enough for the sleepiness to settle inside my mind and take me far.
“This is all my fault, it’s because of…” Harry shakes his head, hands resting on Draco’s chest as they lay in Harry’s room—now fully decorated with pictures on the walls, a wardrobe, drawers and a beautiful window they enchanted to always display the beach, upon Harry’s suggestion. “You can just stay.”
Ginny learned to deflect with humour from the best, so she put on a leer and said, "Luna knows how to share."
like the rustle of passing pages of a book, or the clink of glass against crystal. It’s soft, and comfortable. Ron sounds like children’s laughter, the bustling talk of a crowd, the cheers of fans after a good match. Pansy...” Harry hunches his shoulders, chuckling to himself. “Like a storm, thunder echoing in the darkness.”
The club was not like any I had seen before. I hadn’t been to many places before secluding myself in the flat, so I wasn’t one to talk. Still, it was not as uncomfortable as the ones Hermione, Ron or Ginny had dragged me before.
Draco had never noticed before the day at the park the gold flecks in Harry’s eyes, like the sunlight finding a breach in all that green. He’s never been so close to Harry, not like this, never been allowed to stare freely at him and he wonders, absently, what Harry sees when he looks at Draco.
But this is different, because not only is Draco acutely aware of the hours passing, but his body senses it too. He’s tired, his legs are sore and throbbing. His eyes, still swollen from the earlier cry, don’t have time to heal when new tears stain his reddened cheeks.
He allows himself some degree of relief and pride for a second and adds, “Nice to meet you all, Harry’s talked so much about—”
She takes a long look at him, but says nothing, before setting the table in a corner and transfiguring one chair into another table. It’s not as elegant as his own, but it works fine to hold all the trays she’s brought. The wine, though, disappears somewhere inside the cupboards and Draco’s in no hurry to get it back.
Harry didn’t think he had a lot of fashion sense, but even he doubted black Nike tech fleece was going to cut it wherever they were going.
Healer Cameron stares at him appraisingly for so long, and Draco’s sure the weeping act won’t do any good for his bargain.
Pansy shrugged. "He was jealous of me for having the choice and not taking it. Personally, I prefer clean breaks. It ate at me." She said it lightly, like she rehearsed her words to cover the truth.
Well, to say he feared this question is an understatement. Draco’s stomach falls a little as he prepares the answer he had feared for so long. “It means,” he starts, inhaling. “That sometimes we can feel... what the other is feeling.”
"How do you want to…?" But Harry was already reaching between them to jerk him off too. Draco's eyes were half closed like he had been the one to orgasm, and he Summoned some lube to Harry's hand with a twitch of his finger.
"Not anymore. I fly a little. I think I’m too tall now to be a Seeker," Draco said. Harry measured him up by sight and gently wrapped a hand around Draco’s wrist, holding it out to his side. The wine was going to Harry’s head a little, but Draco hadn’t objected to his touch.
When they finally part ways, Draco feels like he’s never been more exposed, despite the fact that they hadn’t exchanged a word besides a polite “goodbye.”
He’s not sure how he should react. His body definitely wants to jump at Harry and hold him. It doesn’t seem prudent.
The season always slowed down in the winter. Even with state-of-the-art climate charm systems and warming benches, it was harder to get fans into seats, and over time, the games dwindled until it almost felt like a mid-season break.
He takes the letter from her and shoves it back in the envelope to deal with later, eyes intently staring at his hands as they manoeuvre the paper. When he finally lifts his head, both Pansy and Blaise have schooled their expressions to a mask of indifference that is clearly just a show.
Despite the urgency and magic starvation that has taken him since he made the bond with an unconscious Harry, fear clutches his skin, holding him back. If Harry decides he doesn’t like what he sees in Draco today, that’s it, there’s no other hope for him. Everything will be over.
Draco was wearing one of his starched shirts again. For someone who had once told Harry off for his training leggings, Draco wore trousers so tight, they were indecent. He was an astounding hypocrite. He could have gone with a perfectly acceptable shoulder wand holster, or even the chest holster that Aurors used, and Harry knew he owned both. Instead, he had a thigh holster strapped to his leg like a garter. Fucking ridiculous.
“I knew it was going to happen. I was supposed to die,” Harry sobs in the darkness, and his fingers feel... too light, barely there.
"I shouldn’t delay. I have to…I should do that now. I’ll be back later today," Draco said. He sounded a bit frazzled. Harry thought the task was a simple one, but Draco left before Harry could stop him.
He can try his best. That was what Harry repeated to him all the time, wasn’t it? They were trying their best when they met again after the war, when they held each other in cold and dark nights, when they tried to stick their pieces back together.
Kreacher is doing everything he can, though it doesn’t diminish Draco’s abandonment issues. He’s been a right prick the last few weeks, and he knows it: refusing to eat, or to leave the couch unless to use the loo.
"Always glad to be of service." He didn't even wait for Harry to leave before he called, "Emmy? Come take the public desk back. Harry Potter has gone."
"But Lucius Malfoy—" and Andromeda sounded faintly murderous here. "Well, my sister’s husband has always been one for dramatics. And my sister would perish on the spot if she exercised her moral backbone more than once. So, here we are. Draco is the best of the lot of them." She made a small flicking gesture as if to ward off a bad omen.
"Constantine is my cat," Draco said with faint amusement. He held out a hand and two phials shot out of his coat pocket. He handed one to Harry, who was still trying to sit up and process the events of last night. They had
"I wouldn't talk to my parents either if they were a pair of Death Eater sympathisers who profited off of people’s suffering," George said. Pansy froze. Percy glared at him across the table. Even Ginny winced.
He had never seen these sheets before. They were deep crimson and silky to the touch. They were not something he would have bought for himself, that was for certain. On the corner there was still a Harrods tag.
it. But even he knows this might be impossible. And Harry is here, now, interacting with him of his own volition.
Harry laughed. "Let’s just say people have a lot of opinions about what I should be doing. But I like doing my own thing. Always have," Harry said. That wasn’t what Pansy had written, but she nodded along.
The man's grin broadens a bit, as if this is not a sufficient rejection, and he doesn’t glance in Blaise’s direction when he leans closer. Draco all but holds himself stiff not to lean back from him, though he pretty much wants to.
"You don’t want people to know, but you want me to come," Draco stated flatly. It wasn’t a question. There was a difference between friends, the Falcons, and family, and the nameless, faceless Public that Harry answered to, although it was harder to articulate the more he wanted to.
, he tells himself, as Healer Cameron nods goodbye. Just one, and things will be fine. He will be fine.
Draco huffs a laugh, rolling his eyes, and proceeds to detail the important steps of the spell he’s just cast on her. He’s still half expecting some consequence or another to present itself, but nothing happens as he tells Elle about one of the branches of the Alder tree he’s got from Hogwarts and used to bind her magic to. The twig is lying by the potion flasks, gleaming faintly with reminiscent magic still transferring back to her. Elle takes it in her fingers delicately and hugs it to her chest, and her tears finally slide down her cheeks.
"You’re a good friend," Harry said. And to his surprise, he meant it. Harry was closer to her than anyone else in Falcons HQ. Pansy made a sound of faint disgust, but she wore a pleased little smile afterwards.
“You’re alive and well,” he says, finally. Draco nods to the Mediwitch standing on the other side of the bed. The woman silently leaves the room.
Nothing the papers publish about the curse is remotely close to the whole truth, although they all agree it’s something related to Harry’s last battle with Voldemort. Hermione is the one who told Harry about his condition and she tells Draco he looked surprised that Draco died to get him back. Still no word from him, though. He guesses dying for him isn’t enough.
He takes in the sight of Harry, as he coyly enters the room and closes the door. Harry’s attention is on him again. Not just some accidental grin on the way out or rushed goodbyes. Harry stares at him directly, and Draco isn’t embarrassed in the slightest about his bloodshot eyes and reddened cheeks. He’s human, and he’s hurting, and Harry probably knows that already, anyway.
But Harry is awake. Despite the wide eyes he sports, his magic is not the frantic mess it becomes when he is too far gone by his nightmares.
The bond tugs inside of him for now, settling contently between them. And this is when Draco realises what he’s been missing about Elle’s case, how he can fix it.
Harry turned his attention to rolling them onto the bed sheets. He took one broad palm and traced the same path on Draco's skin where Draco had touched him. Draco watched him do it, heavy-lidded but alert. He looked better than Harry could have imagined. Harry pulled him closer again to kiss, revelling in the fact they could do this. Harry broke their kiss to throw his shirt off.
"Yes, Jean. No, Jean, that’s fine you don’t have to come. Very kind of you. Just a cold. Thanks, thanks so much. We’ll call in the morning," Ron said.
Harry put Rose on his shoulders. She weighed practically nothing to him. She pinched him by accident once or twice when she got too excited. Then she asked to be let down, and they cartwheeled in the grass until Harry was feeling a bit dizzy.
Draco averts his eyes from the glossy green, staring at the shells on the top of the closest pillar again. They are beautiful things, and he wonders who went to the trouble of positioning them just so.
"Mr Potter, there are rumours that you might not get called up for England because of a perceived attitude problem. Care to answer?"
Harry wrote to Percy, who, with several caveats, also recommended Draco Malfoy. So Harry finally gave in and tried to set an appointment via the address on the card Blaise had sent. An owl came back with one word scrawled on a corner of parchment.
Draco tries to convince himself there are no tears in this lifeless place, but he feels the coldness of them on his cheeks, anyway. He knows he wouldn’t have survived life without Harry if his mother hadn't been by side. Draco wouldn’t have had the will to keep going without her strong, safe arms holding him up, pushing him in the right direction. When he lost her, he had thought his world had ended again. But it was her love, and his own love for her, and for Harry, that kept him going.
Their first big fight happened about a month after Harry moved in with Draco. It had been months and Draco still wasn’t able to sleep an entire night without waking Harry up to make sure he was there. That Harry was alive, even though the bond was always latently pulsing inside him. Harry had become very attuned to Draco, and when it happened, Harry held him close in the middle of the night and whispered “I’m here,” as many times as Draco needed to hear it. It seemed only natural that the next step of their relationship was living together.
Harry didn't know what to say to that. He wanted to say he understood, but he didn't really. The Dursleys had been awful, but at least Harry had the assurance his actual parents had been decent people, even if he never knew them.
Draco smiles softly. If he could just hold him for a second. Touch his hand, assure him that everything would be fine, like Draco’s friends have been trying to do to him. Harry is
The way Harry’s eyes dart from one building, to the trees surrounding his old campus, to the assortment of students scattered around is endearing. His magic spills out of his body like waves, the warmth of it crashing against Draco’s own. Draco tries showing him everything he knows, despite having visited the place only twice—once to exalt one of Harry’s art exhibitions, and another time to deliver the papers of his dropout, when Harry was so far gone that he couldn’t attend the classes anymore.
"1987 was a terrible year for Bordeaux," Draco said. But he poured them two glasses anyway and sipped his.
"But you could do this any time. If you want to learn to drive or play piano, you could start tomorrow," Draco pressed.
Luna seemed satisfied by my resolve, a slight smile spreading on her lips, while she applied eyeliner on me. “I’ll be there too, so don’t trouble yourself more than you have to. If you're not alright, we’ll take off.”
If tears run down his face, they’re cold and bring an icy burn to his cheeks. Draco really thought he had no tears left to cry.
"Captain!" came a familiar voice from behind him as he entered the locker room. Stella Abidi, the centre Chaser, was grinning widely, already laced into her Quidditch leathers.
Harry tried to wrap his mind around the kind of loyalty that would have you refuse to speak for a decade but show up when told.
The highlight of Draco’s week is the notable lack of his name in the papers since he’s gone back to work. He thought people would be more worked up over what he’s up to, but he figures, now that he’s not related to their saviour anymore, he’s not worth the trouble, not when they have so much on Harry to publish.
Draco barely realises he’s been leaning forward and has to pull back slightly to keep from touching Harry. He takes a deep breath, feeling the heat coming in from the bond. Harry feels so warm.
Draco nods, entranced by the curve of Harry’s finger on his mug and the way he’s trying so hard to be civil to a man he used to despise.
Draco spent the last few days researching many of the same old tomes in Celtic magic and bonding he used when looking for a counter-curse for Harry, and the last hour explaining to Pansy how he thinks he can cure Elle. He’d got the idea from Harry, from their own bond. It’s not the same, but if Draco can only get Elle’s magic to stay bound to something, like the Malfoy magic used to be bonded to the C
"I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear that," Andromeda said, standing by the door. They were both all dressed up, Andromeda in jeans and a jumper meant to look like a Potter jersey, Teddy head to toe in grey and white, including a new pair of Falcons trainers that Harry was mildly embarrassed to remember had a design that bore his name.
"I did some research into your family," Draco said. "Lots of newspaper clippings and correspondence on record." He took a good long look at each dish and recorded it down in his notebook.
Harry finds him surrounded by those books. Half-lidded eyes are trying to focus on the words he’s reading, their concept being almost entirely lost by his exhausted brain.
“Harry?” Draco calls, hovering over his chest, touching his pale face. “Harry, please. Please, come back,” he pleads, to whoever is listening. The Forest, the Tree, Harry himself. He can’t cry anymore, he’s tired of shedding tears, he’s tired of living like this. Like a part of him is missing.
He has no time to consider whether the exchange was real. He’s glad he’s had one last meeting with Elle, even if it was all in his head. His heart feels lighter, his chest not so tight.
"This is…I'm going to die," Harry gasped out. It was overwhelming to have Draco inside him. He didn’t know it would be like this. All-consuming, languid heat sparked deep inside his body. Draco stopped and held Harry open with a thumb, ran a finger along where they were joined. He was looking, Harry realised with a shiver of pleasure. The sound Harry made was low, involuntary.
"Hello," Harry said. A normal person might have contacted someone or at least summoned an owl from his mailing service. Harry had instead walked for an hour and showed up on Pansy’s doorstep after his workout, and he was both overheated and shivering cold. Being famous had ruined him; he was a little too used to showing up somewhere and being accepted.
Even now, most mornings, he tried to do laps. He picked hotels with Olympic length pools even if they were Muggle because something in him went quiet and still at the scent of chlorine and salt and the coolness against his skin to start off the day.
had started to appease Pansy’s concerns, but it didn’t take long until Draco started genuinely wanting to be better, to
"Thanks Bletchley," Gemma said, pressing a kiss to his cheek, which Miles bore with good humour, waving her off.
Harry really didn’t know what to make of that. Having Draco around had been strange and unsettling. And, these days, Harry never bothered trying to process his emotions by thinking. He went to the parlour he had cleared when he was trying to move the wall. He had gone a bit heavier than he should have on the weights this morning, so he spent most of his time stretching and testing his weaker ankle. He would have to go to Penelope for a different off-season workout schedule if he was going to be tinkering at Grimmauld full time.
Of course he didn’t, Draco is aware of that. Harry hasn’t learned to be selfish yet. In Harry’s head, he just gave up his life so the Wizarding World could live and that’s the type of thing he does. He sacrifices. And that’s what Draco loves most about him.
Harry assumed that Pansy had a serious falling out because she never spoke of them and Christmas at the Weasleys was two years ago, but he wasn't looped in enough to know if she'd been disowned wholesale, privately or otherwise. He frowned.
"Luna!" Harry said with delight and hugged her. She looked with obvious interest from Draco to Harry, but said nothing beyond ‘hullo’ with two fluttering kisses to Draco’s cheek.
Elle shrugs, not pressing the issue about Harry nor confirming his suspicions about her lack of interest in her own situation.
“I lost you. I lost you and I was all alone again,” he says once, before he can hold back the frightened words. Or tears.
The chest unlatched without any trouble. Inside were layers of what looked like straw and objects wrapped in yellowing newspaper. It went much deeper than Harry would have expected.
"Yeah?" Harry asked. It wasn’t like Ron sat around pining. In those years, Ron had gone to Auror training and went on a date or two. Nothing serious. Ron was picking at the other edge of the carpet, separating it into beige strings.
Milo spat at the Arrows Chaser, and a second referee had come to push the teams back to their sides. Harry put an arm across Milo’s chest, but he was big enough that Harry knew Milo backed down out of respect for Harry, rather than because of Harry's strength.
"No," Draco said. "You are a magical anomaly and freakishly powerful." Draco was looking at Harry's hands again.
“You don’t like it when I touch you.” Even if it wasn’t entirely true, it wasn’t a question, and so I stayed silent. “Do you prefer me to ask before touching you?”
He doesn’t complain (yet again) about Harry’s tactlessness, or how he had shattered every single one of the crystal wine glasses he had extracted from the manor with his gawky fingers.
"I don't like the Bludgers," a girl said. The boy next to her agreed with a vigorous shake of his head.
"Ah, so the extended blowjob scene in His Minister’s Secret between the spy and his nemesis is meant to be thrilling but not sexy," Draco teased.
Marvin smiles at him like he knows what Draco’s on about, and they change the topic to the new improvements of the centre. Luna follows them quietly, greeting a few people on the way.
"It’s not that simple," Draco said. His tone was placating as if he was humouring Harry, as if Harry was being unreasonable for not wanting to live in a constant state of surprise with food, artefacts, and Merlin knew what else popping up. Harry gritted his teeth.
Stella copied it with her customary flourish. She made it look easy, leaving her hands behind her back to hover. They tried, even shouting pointers at each other, but half of them relied on momentum and speed, and the other half found themselves wobbling, unused to balancing with the shifting of their thighs once they were upside down without their hands. Stella blew her whistle.
"You don't want a puffy face for Wiz Sport." Pansy held out a hand, and someone dutifully passed her an under-eye mask. She froze it with her wand and stuck the shiny gold foil below Harry’s eyes with a delicate hand. He hissed in discomfort.
He was crawling into Harry’s lap, and even though Harry was a little embarrassed, he held Draco’s gaze steadily.
"I wonder…" Draco reached for a cup in the top layer and then withdrew his hand as if stung. "I can’t touch any of this either."
They stumbled upstairs where every single bedroom was locked but Harry's. He was pretty certain the house had locked the other bedrooms to help him out.
"Final touches on your new wards. Wand out," Draco said. Harry obeyed. "First, we’re going to list authorised visitors. They’ll be able to Apparate in without asking first, so remember that. Don’t authorise anyone you don’t want in your house unless they knock. You’ll say, 'authorised visitors' and then full name. You can change these later."
"When I was a little girl, I wanted to play for the Harpies," Pansy said, looking at Ginny. Ginny, in a rare show of modesty, blushed pink. "But I'm not a good flier."
Harry was there for the demonstrations, but he always tried to do one activity with each age group. He started in the morning with the under-seventeens, who were always a mix of awestruck and cynical.
"It’s my birthday, and if I eat all of Molly’s cake, I’m going to be sick." Harry led him into the kitchen and offered him a slice.
"Strike ‘em dead!" Most of the bar was hooting and cheering at this point. It took a while for the foot stamping and table banging to subside. Harry always took the first shot of the season, though he didn’t much like Blishen’s Whisky. He loved this more than anything.
"Tea?" Harry offered after they had finished assessing what was left to be done upon Neville’s return. They sat and had some, with biscuits for Neville.
Marvin’s grin grows wider for a second. He’s at least ten years older than Draco, but it never looks like it when he’s smiling. His positive and calm demeanour is, in Draco’s opinion, what makes his dysfunctional groups work so well together.
Harry is not supposed to be here half an hour early. He’s not supposed to be drinking coffee while looking so out of place.
In the end, Harry always comes back. He’s sure his heart will cease beating completely soon just from the sight of Harry alone.
"I’ll send you my apples this autumn. You’ve never eaten a better one. You see, you can eat whatever you want, as long as it’s organic. It’s modern food that’s the problem," Luc said as Harry arrived at five am. Luc was talking to Atty who nodded attentively, all eagerness. They were all early, a habit borne out of nerves and a healthy fear of dashing across the complex while Coach was looking for you.
To Harry, he’s nothing more than the bully who made his life a miserable hell in school, not long ago, and hurt the people he loved.
If he never tried to attempt that bond or died to find Harry’s soul and bring him back, he’d still have more than what he has now. He’d still have
Three matches to go. The match against Ballycastle was interminable in the driving rain. They eked out a win that felt less like a victory than a stop after three full hours of play. Harry's ankle felt off, and he was covered in mud and sweat. He rallied for the post-match interview after his massage and then excused himself.
"Anyone seen a little girl?" Ron was searching all around the garden wall, careful not to look at Rose. Rosie ran into his shins. "I'm looking for my Daisy."
Her skin seems more thin and dry than before, wrinkled. Mother’s beautiful blonde hair has lost part of the glow it used to display.
No, no. This is also wrong. Harry doesn’t hold him anymore. Harry doesn’t understand him like this anymore, without words, without a second glance.
“But I am.” Harry bites his lower lip, and the act, small as it is, is so much like Harry it hurts to look at. “You didn’t answer me. How long?”
Though her expression is grave, her eyes shine with a glint of excitement. He can’t imagine what would make her so thrilled. The only thing that might have the same effect on him is finding the cure for Harry’s problem. Draco doubts she has.
Draco stares at the dark veins spreading at a slow pace over Harry’s chest. He doesn’t dare touch it, he can’t stare at it for too long either. Has it always been there? Had Draco not noticed it before because he was blind or because he just refused to accept it for what it truly was: their end?
"I have always known that. You think I don’t know that? If they want to make shit up they will, whether or not you participate," Draco said.
So, last year he learned to swim. None of that half crawl, half dog paddle stuff he had done before when Petunia abandoned Harry in the far lane of a community centre pool while Dudley took lessons.
Draco snorts, rolling his eyes. “You clearly don’t understand the intricacies of shape altering spells, darling. Leave it for the professionals.”
Harry woke up with the weight of half of Draco flung across him, a knee pressing his thighs open, breaths on his neck, an arm heavy across his chest and drawing him in tight. It had been a while since he let someone hold him. The night was clear in his memory, despite a slight wine headache and a dry mouth. Draco stirred behind him, and Harry froze. Just a minute longer, he thought, and fell asleep again. This time when he awoke, Draco was already up, sitting in bed with his legs still tangled with Harry’s. Draco had an imprint of pillowcase creases on his face, and he looked at Harry bleary eyed.
Draco’s tied up, impotent and unable to help her. He’s a healer, but he can’t cure his patient. It took years to understand Harry’s condition, to learn what to do to bring him back. His solution was never ideal. But Harry’s awake for now, his soul trapped here by the bond Draco performed. He now has
is a big deal," Barbara said. Harry was inclined to agree, and then remembered what the Body Issue entailed.
"No. Kingsley and Dumbledore did a sweep before they made it Order headquarters, remember?" Ron said.
“Hello, Harry,” he greets. When Harry only slightly recoils at the sound of his voice, Draco continues. “Thank you for meeting with me. I realize this might be difficult, and...”
Draco was offended at the very thought. "Antique, handcrafted furniture with the impressions of the magical imprints of your family? No. You wouldn’t sell something like that."
I met you later that night, too. You didn’t touch my body, just the wall behind me. When I hugged your neck and pulled you closer, closer and
Draco doesn’t ask Hermione how she knows he’s there when he opens the door, just stares at her bright, wide eyes and fatigued frown.
“Nothing. You know what?” Harry rises from the couch, worrying his lower lip. He takes a glance at their picture over the hearth mantel, and when he turns to Draco again, his expression is stern. “I do resent you, Malfoy. For not telling me this before. I’ve got to get out of here.”
Draco’s head jerks to the side, and he hovers over Elle’s body. “Elle? It’s okay. You’re going to be okay,” Draco whispers, though he knows better not to make promises he can’t keep. “I’m here.”
The large tree on the far side turned out to be a dancing camphor laurel which smelt strongly of mint when Neville crushed a leaf between his thumb and forefinger. It swayed, making a loud shushing noise with its leaves.
Three, two, one. After all that, it was simple enough, and Harry pressed his lips to Draco’s mouth. Draco swayed into him. The kiss was a little rough but still sweet. Harry thought he might like all wine more now he tasted it on Draco's tongue.
To Harry's surprise, after a round of hugs and cheek kisses, Draco took Harry's arm, and they left as they arrived. Together. He leaned into Harry in a way that made Harry feel like he'd been left in charge even though it was Draco who steered them to the Apparition Point.
Harry ignored him. He waited until they were up to start slow circles to search. He saw the Snitch hover for a second by Oliver. He dived, almost catching it, when a Bludger blindsided him from where Louis had been and knocked Harry off-course with a loud crack, and his head snapped to the front. The stadium all groaned as one.
"Just a little something. Didn’t take more than a moment," Molly said, making a dismissive gesture. Hermione, George, Andromeda, and Harry all tried not to laugh when they saw the defeated look on Ron’s face.
"Get your own." Blaise popped half a biscuit in his mouth and made a face he probably thought made him look like he was seriously considering something. Harry rolled his eyes.
Draco and Harry have fun redecorating the house from scratch. Some things go back to the way they were; Draco’s study for one. Others are made completely anew; like the kitchen with now blue cupboards and white tiled walls.
He’s still trying to control his smile when he comes to fetch Harry, after sending a Patronus to Hermione. The room is ready for Harry. There's a set of the silk dragon printed pyjamas resting on the bed, and a new towel on the bathroom. If Harry feels Draco’s bliss through the bond—and Draco’s embarrassingly sure that he does—he doesn’t say a thing before thanking him and locking himself inside the prepared bedroom.
"These things are much more tolerable if you bring someone with you," Ginny said. They stood at the edge of the dance floor, where Luna was whirling around a Junior Kestrels player who could have been her sister, throwing off light as the spangles on her gold dress caught the firelight.
“I can understand Potter,” Blaise blurts. His voice sounds normal, but his fingers rest stiffly on the table.
The grounds of the Burrow had been filled with couches and armchairs. Spheres of light weaved through tree branches, while some floated around, following  guests as they walked, creating a whimsical ambience. An enormous lounge area held most of the tables, with white tented ceilings rising to the skyline. As night fell, the stars twinkled above them, silently witnessing their union. Even though it was all very elegant, the reception still seemed warm and intimate.
A new baby was born during the night, and Draco hurried over as soon as the sun peeked over the ridge around the preserve to make a portrait.
"You should have brought Pansy. We could have had a nice time," Blaise said to Harry. He was transparent in baiting Draco for a reaction. But it was Daphne who chimed in.
Soon enough, we were there with them, my body stuck to Luna’s, trying to avoid anyone else that got too close. One deep breath. Two. Three. People were bumping into me. The thin protection of my cardigan had become a defence mechanism, too hot now to be a safe space and not a suffocating armour.
He’s the one who drove them apart, the one to reject their bond and their connection because of petty certainties and cowardly fears. He can’t live with this guilt. But he can’t live without Harry again, either.
His feet sink deep into the snow, the cold trying to break into the layers of warming charms he has around his body as he walks towards the main doors. He doesn’t enter the house, though. He’d already taken everything he’s ever needed from here during the years he spent researching Harry’s curse.
Draco swallows and looks too. This is the Harry who’s been more alive than ever since he woke up from the coma. The Harry who tried to get to know the man Draco had become, even though he had no reason to. The Harry that learned to love him for who he is. Draco loves this Harry.
"I'm just fucking with you," Harry added, looking away. He was a liar. But Draco was also something like a friend at this point, and he was employing Draco to fix his house, not to fuck him into a mattress so he could sleep properly. Harry rubbed his hands over his face with frustration. He felt like, once again, he was showing Draco his worst self.
"My godfather Sirius Black gave it to me upon his death. It had been his mother’s house. We used it during the war." Draco made another listening noise. "Dumbledore tested it to make sure it had passed to me." Harry said defensively. He disliked the implication that the house wasn’t his. It was his. It was all he had left of his godfather.
reporter asked, "Do you have any comments for the Diagon Alley Business Improvement District on your agent's shopfront?" and he answered, "Mate, I play Quidditch."
Draco was breathless when he retreated to the pavement. Harry knew then that Draco would not come in. Still, Draco was smiling.
And Harry did wake up, but he is nowhere close to this room, and it now feels devoid of the hope that kept Draco going for five years.
Neville came to look at the courtyard with little fuss. He couldn’t resist the lure of the unknown. Neville picked up a pebble and hurled it at the opening, and a small clang sounded as it reached just above the height of the house.
"Sometimes I think the Muggles are at an advantage over us, I'll tell you," Harry muttered under his breath.
It was always nice to talk to Viktor because he understood what it was like today on the pitch. With anyone else, it would have felt like he had to explain. They sat in Harry’s hotel room with barely a splash of whiskey in a glass, talking about referees and rookies.
Maybe he'll be like the heroes in Celtic eschatology. He'll return to his own plane to find all of his loved ones dead, because he had been gone for centuries.
Harry's elf refused to obey Draco, leading them to a small quarrel that remains unresolved. But the initial sting of betrayal fades as soon as Draco lays eyes on the delicious plate of food Harry left for him on the stove.
As she promised, Astoria Greengrass wrote with recommendations for Kyoto and a day trip to a nearby city. She was so easygoing and inquisitive, it was easy to write her back. She asked about Alexandria and Athens. She was a different kind of Slytherin, because she was so agreeable, Harry ended up with plans she made without him realising.
Draco looked as though he had wandered out of a library and found himself at Harry’s front step. Harry had seen many society page spreads where Draco wore sharp, fitted designer Muggle suits and dress robes, so this must be his work attire. It seemed inappropriate.
It wasn’t their fault that I didn’t belong in my body some mornings, or that in others I felt detached from it and everything that made me who I was. Except for
Harry kicked off and, even through his goggles, a fine mist made it difficult to see more than a few metres in any direction. It wasn’t any condition for playing, but the League declared too late for cancellation without a forfeit. In autumn, they might have thrown in the towel. But it was spring now, and, this close to the finals, even one point for a draw was worth the risk of zero points for a loss or withdrawal. It would affect their ranking going into finals.
Now, Harry would never be lacking. Draco touched him all the time, more than anyone he'd known. In small ways, like it was natural to hook an ankle around his when they ate together, to put his cold fingers in the holes in his old clothes to remind him to throw them out, to rest a hand lightly on his shoulder to manoeuvre around him, although now the kitchen had enough room to pass without being that close.
“Well, it doesn’t matter anymore,” Draco announces, lifting his teacup for a toast. The girls happily oblige, and the china clinks softly. “I’m coming back.”
He purposefully avoids Harry’s eyes, afraid of the same rage he saw before, and keeps out of his line of sight to avoid another outburst. He can’t tell what he fears most right now, as his mind supplies a neverending list of things that might have gone wrong.
"We were together for about three years. The whole time, I thought my parents had no idea. But they knew everything. I agreed that I should stop seeing Daniel. I almost agreed to marry Astoria. Made myself miserable over it."
"Ah, there's my Rosie-Posie! I found her! I found her!" Ron swept Rose into his arms and kissed her cheeks while she giggled.
Harry hadn't realised he had expected Draco to scar until now. But sometimes, it seemed like his whole life until adulthood had been a dream. The past was distant, unreal. It felt like there should be physical evidence of every transgression he ever made, that every good deed and bad deed should be on a ledger, plain to see.
He walked to the bench. The stadium on both sides was booing the referees so loudly, the announcement was drowned out as they called a timeout. Min-woo came up from the benches having been called by an assistant coach, and Stella dropped into their small side huddle.
Draco turns around to meet Luna’s bright grin. It’s been quite some time since he’s last seen her, their schedules keeping them from their weekly afternoon tea over the last few weeks. She’s wearing her soft blue robes—Draco had been envious at the beginning of their work when she started using the robes specific for the children’s ward—and her hair in a tousled bun held by her wand.
"Why?" George said later, in the garden alone with Harry. Harry could think of many questions that could be, but he thought he understood more than anyone how it felt to know your loved ones were gone and people who seemed far less deserving were alive and well.
But going from the front of the house to the back, all Harry encountered were more former classmates and no Neville. Thaddeus had been lovely. Another man, a colleague of Padma’s who started off talking to Harry like a confrontation, was not.
It was two weeks before Harry felt like a human being again, instead of a Quidditch perpetual motion machine. Every night, he fell asleep right away, and, soon enough, the house would dim the lights as he came in, somehow shortening the walk to his bedroom. Harry was fairly certain Draco was here every day, but other than moving piles of paper or the occasional forgotten mug of tea with a Warming Charm over it, he didn’t see him at all until the day he had a morning off.
Who could forget? Giannopoulos, the Arrow’s Keeper, would be in any advert he could sign for the next decade to pay back all the high interest loans his spouse of seventy-two hours had taken out before disappearing to Isla Mujeres.
There’s a Mediwitch waiting for him by the hospital’s Floo. The short, middle-aged woman is ready to take him to Elle’s room, as if Draco doesn’t know the way by heart.
He and Harry had quietly walked back to Draco’s house side by side. Their hands brushed so softly, Draco wouldn’t be sure they were touching if it was not for the bond vibrating whenever they did. Harry didn’t feel safe to Apparate yet, with his magic wildly misbehaving, so he had asked to take Draco’s Floo. Then, he stepped into the hearth and grinned at Draco. For a second, Draco had pretended the world was fine. There was nothing wrong with his life, nothing dragging Harry away from him. And then Harry had disappeared in green flames and Draco sighed to his lonely living room.
"No. It’s not advisable if you are hoping to pass the House to a non-blood relative, and, as I said, it’s secure, but not dependable. In any case, the original owner is as much to blame as the blood wards. Magical objects and constructions inherit the prejudices of their creators."
Harry was warming up to the restaurant as they stepped through the bank of Floos and a host escorted them past the main dining room into a different private room than last time. It was rare to feel that secure in a Wizarding establishment, but some tension fell away now he knew he couldn’t be photographed.
"You tell me all the time you don’t care about the League, and you want to do your own thing, and this and that. Yes, in my professional opinion it would be terrible. It wouldn’t be worse than ‘99 but it wouldn’t be fun. I know it was hard for you. But you aren’t alone and you take that flak all the time for every other cause. Then, when it came time to piss people off for something that matters to you personally, you said no."
“I thought you were a wizard, Draco.” Harry snorts, despite the slightest shake of his limbs, lifting the towel.
But mother doesn’t let him speak, raising a warning hand. “I love you, Draco. I will always love you. And if you allow me, I want to know the man you have become. I want to be a part of your life again.”
“Yeah, mate.” Ron tried to reach me, but he soon realised what he was doing and retracted his hands. “We’ve always known you’re different, it doesn’t change how we feel about you.”
Marvin’s eyes finally meet his, calm and understanding, and a dreadful shiver runs down Draco’s spine. Marvin is gentle and caring, but his gaze can pierce through metal when he’s after the truth, and it scares the hell out of him.
, think about what it means. He lifts his head defiantly, glaring at Draco. “Don’t you think I don’t know what this is? You send your friends here because you don’t trust me to be alone anymore.”
When they moved into this house, Harry had let Draco decorate the entire place almost by himself. He had made their room, the study, and the others. But when it came to Harry’s space, Draco had filled it only with art supplies and let Harry furnish the rest as he pleased.
During Harry's time in the league, Quidditch uniforms had changed gradually from the bulky robes, breeches, and leather of years past to fitted jerseys, black running tights, and sleeker guards for the wrist, elbows and shin. Almost everyone switched to soft boots in team colours with reinforced toes. Better for flying in.
If their fingers brush when he passes the book, Draco does not scream. But he wants to, when the shadow of a touch
"If the birthday girl wants oysters and red wine with her cheese plate, we order oysters and red wine with her cheese plate," Blaise said. He turned and whispered something to Daphne, who threw her head back and laughed.
"I am going to jump out the window and join a monastery if this is about Oliver," Ron said. That made it sound much worse than it was. There was nothing wrong with the occasional victory lap when they were both single. It had been about a year since the last time.
The more that he thought about it, the Life Debt bothered Harry. He did some reading. He even sat up in the team hotel lounge reading a few books Hermione had sent, skimming historical accounts, including one of a witch named Landy Gendarme who used a Life Debt to make a woman her servant for ten years. Another wizard asked for someone's home and all their possessions. Another demanded someone’s firstborn to rear, which seemed distinctly more in the genre of evil fairytale witch than should be allowed by the law. Harry didn’t want to have that much leverage over another person.
"It’s not the waiting. It’s that she asked me to wait, and I wanted to," Ron said. Harry had never really thought of quiet devotion as love. Sacrifice, yes. Passion, yes. But not a declaration like ‘I will wait for you.’
I didn’t understand how it mattered, since we’d change our faces in the end, but I let her do what she wanted, anyway.
“Look…” she starts, backing away when he shifts and removes her fingers from his hair. “You’ll get over this, Draco. You both will. And you’ll be happy, okay? Just, please, let me help you.”
"Oh, he’s long gone. Said something about some special cactus blooming at midnight," Seamus said. Harry snorted. It wasn’t that serious. But speaking of Malfoy, Seamus had their house fixed by Draco, hadn’t he?
He releases a heavy breath, letting the steam coming out of his cup heat his face and ground his thoughts.
Harry sighs, relieved, and closes his eyes. He chuckles softly before looking at Draco again. “You can even name our first kid Scorpion like you wanted.”
Sam and Milo snickered. Harry didn’t bother looking back. He flexed his hand in his weightlifting gloves, taking time to admire the glitter nail varnish he’d picked out before following through on his final deadlift. He had been feeling celebratory.
"Gladly," Draco said, accent crisp. But only three seconds went by before he asked, "So where are you off to?"
nice to go out again with his friend, to not have to worry about anything, to have company and drink and forget his life. But this isn’t as easy as it’s supposed to be. As Draco wants it to be. Because he
Harry and Julie had exchanged phone numbers, because Harry apparently has a new mobile, and they hugged briefly when they parted.
"I never felt like I knew him." Harry admitted. "It wasn’t serious, but he was never…he's always like that. I felt that Blaise was always putting on a front."
Harry leaned forward for a kiss even though sitting up took more effort than he wanted. It still surprised him every time they did this. Even after months of being together, he expected that Draco would withdraw from him. Harry got to have this whenever he wanted now. Outside of the constraints of training all the time.
Harry doesn’t seem to mind doing all the work, as he peppers Draco’s neck with kisses and small bites. The scowl etched on Harry's face slowly fades into relief, then arousal.
"Oh, it’s not that. I mean, that’s not—" Neville’s expression turned sheepish. "I…uh....well, once or twice I guess depending on how you define it. We had…er, relations of the sexual sort, and it’s kind of awkward when we see each other now?"
Harry’s eyes flicker around the room, from the colorful afghan (a gift from a lady at the centre) covering his second-hand couch, to the adjoining and pointedly messy kitchen. Something inside Draco flares defensively at Harry’s interested gaze, but before he can say something he’ll regret, he hides in his bedroom to retrieve a towel.
When Pansy and Hermione come to get the girls at night, they’re assaulted with enthusiastic yelps about the new
The only release he gets is from the many cigarettes he smokes in his free time. New packs are piling up in his office drawers each day. He regrets breaking his promise about not smoking anymore, but he needs the respite.
“It’s been happening since I woke up from the coma. At first I thought I was just... I don’t know what I thought.” He releases a self-deprecating chuckle that Draco wants to smother. “I hear things. But it’s not... not voices or anything. I just. You know how you said you feel my magic or Luna always says she can see people’s auras?”
, Draco thinks. He survived. It had not been exactly living, an existence devoid of light. But he’s breathing, and he’s moving, and that should be enough.
"It’s one in the afternoon," Draco said. But he slipped off to the guest bathroom after asking for a towel and came downstairs dressed in a different outfit as Harry was scrambling the eggs.
, not enough time for too much damage, despite Pansy’s trepidations and the cold that’s now fully left his body.
He’s on his second glass when the wine starts tasting sour and unpleasant on his tongue and he can’t drink another drop of it. The bottle ends up abandoned on the kitchen table, along with a myriad of objects that he, in his boredom, dug up from the cupboards; mugs, plates, bowls, everything he could get his hands on, which reminded him too much of Harry. It’s too bad that everything in the house reminds him of Harry.
“Harry, wait!” you called after me. My feet stopped on the pavement against my will. Or maybe I wanted to turn around and see your flushed face, your eyes looking for mine and never finding them. Our charms had vanished, and the face that glanced at me was truly yours, as much as mine was truly me.
He could use a cigarette right now, but when his fingers grope his pockets, he finds none. Oh, right, Draco doesn’t smoke anymore. But is it still breaking a promise if the one he'd promised doesn't remember it?
"Ron, Hermione, Neville, and Pansy were all busy," Harry answered. Ginny reached up to adjust his tie, a boring black. Harry could see the headlines already. Always a fabrication, but never anything he dreaded, never anything remotely true.
Three bowls of soup rest under Stasis on the table. The aroma of spices mixed with the earthy fragrance of pesto wafts through the room, filling his lungs and leaving a burning sensation in his taste buds.
He’s a failure, and he’s alone because of it. Draco feels like the last piece of a puzzle, and he can’t fit anywhere. He can’t save himself. How could he have ever hoped to save Elle?
"Well, we know you’ve got several charities that you support. You’re a busy man. But readers will wonder: Is there anyone special in your life right now?" Lee asked. Lee had to ask, Harry knew, so he didn’t begrudge him the question.
, he thinks. He needs Harry to make him feel it so much he’s bruised, he’s scarred from Harry’s touch. This is wrong, but it feels so right.
Draco doesn’t think twice before sealing it and sending it to his future ex-husband, along with a small box carrying Harry’s wedding ring—something he’s been holding onto for the last five years. The other pair to that jewel rests on the table, the white gold bands of the double infinity glinting in the light. His fingers graze the jewellery, and it burns.
Potter slowly starts opening up to the group. Every session, whenever Draco says something, Potter immediately asks to share something in return. Even though they’re surrounded by other people like them, it always feels like it’s only them when they talk.
Draco forces his gaze from Harry to the figures, before turning back to him, pressing his fingers against Harry’s. “How do you know that?”
Draco takes a deep breath and tries not to panic when no air reaches his lungs. He’s not dead this time, but this remains a place in which perception escapes his awareness.
“Thanks,” Harry says, shrugging and staring at the hand Draco’s resting on top of the cat’s head. “I don’t think I’m good enough, though, I just—”
"That's fine," Draco said. Draco poured them another glass, Harry asked the house for another bottle, and they went trudging upstairs.
He looked good. Very good. He had perfected the effortlessly tousled hair that many a stylist tried and failed to give Harry. He wore a pair of indecently tight brown tweed trousers, a billowing white shirt, scuffed brogues, and a hunter green cardigan. Harry had never quite got an eye for whether non-robe clothing was magic or Muggle, especially now Muggle clothes were in fashion.
Theo didn't give him a chance to respond. He rose from his chair and joined Greg and Draco in the far corner. He put his shoes on the low couch, and Draco pushed him playfully until the shoes were back off the couch. Harry wasn’t sure of the feeling churning around in his belly. He turned his attention back to the group.
They’re here because of Harry. And Harry, much to Draco’s dismay and astonishment, doesn’t appreciate being the centre of attention, even if said attention is focused on his own wellbeing. That there was ever a time when Draco thought Harry Potter was an arrogant prick who craved attention seems a distant memory.
"I wouldn't know," Pansy said, cutting into her roast carefully. Manners must be hard to forget even with the Weasleys' mismatched cutlery. "We aren't on speaking terms."
The majority of the footage features Harry unashamedly asking their guests to talk to the camera, with some skewed shots of the beautiful decorations. Mother had helped Draco not only pick their wedding rings, but plan the whole thing. He would have been happy enough with a smaller ceremony, but his mother always dreamed of planning a huge wedding for her only son, and Draco and Harry couldn’t say no.
"Laugh like I’ve just told you a funny joke," Toni instructed while Harry hovered a little higher up so she could shoot from below. Harry did, but it felt unnatural.
Potter averts his eyes, cheeks reddening either because of the sun or his embarrassment. “Just... Er… Okay? I’ve been thinking about joining an art school, but... Argh.”
Draco laughs helplessly, not minding the tears this time. He takes a deep breath, sealing his lips against Harry’s, and whispers when he pulls away, “You came back to me.”
Perhaps there’s a chance they might even be friends. They had crossed that bridge before, after all.
Pansy’s mask falls first. “Did you two talk?” She raises a brow, concern written on her face. He’s glad it’s not pity.
Draco coloured. "You can wear other people’s rings, but it would be inappropriate under these circumstances. Let your ring settle," Draco said gently. Harry had the vague feeling he had just suggested something tactless.
Draco half expects to meet dead plants and cobwebs wrapping Harry’s old painting. That’s not the sight that greets him when he finally musters up the courage to open the door and enter the room.
I looked down, and wasn’t surprised to see my body had changed again, to fit Luna’s shirt more perfectly. A girl's body. I was someone else, but with my eyes.
Luna gestures with her head to the way to the closest Apparition point, two streets ahead, and they start walking. “Your group doesn’t come by anymore. Some stayed for a couple of years. Marvin is the only one from that time that still works there. He has his own office now. He usually comes by the centre on weekends, like me.”
Draco can't bring himself to cast a Patronus now, unable to face the translucent blue stag, and settles to watch as Pansy’s mockingbird slithered its way out of St Mungo's and away—into the Department of Mysteries, where the Hermione spends most of her time  nowadays.
Pansy stops now as well, Draco notices distantly. His feet drag him closer, against his mind's reasoning that Harry’s magic will hurt him. Harry wouldn’t hurt him. Draco never had trouble believing that in the previous years, but why does it feel like the biggest lie he’s ever told himself?
"I’m off. I’ve got to do a preliminary look at another house today," Draco said. He bent and hugged Teddy. He pressed his cheek against Andromeda’s. Draco was almost at the door when he turned back to the three of them.
"I should go," Draco said. His hair was a mess. Harry stood up too, wincing at the ache from the hard floor. Draco leaned in first with a kiss that was all sweet satisfaction. He took a second one with his hand cupped on Harry’s cheek.
, tumble out of his lips before Draco can put a leash on them. “I think we should try to sever our bond.”
"You're cold," Draco said. The covers leapt to his hand and the sheets were dry suddenly. He drew the blankets over them both.
Draco knows she and Harry had been good friends during his time in college. His grin falls when he remembers the truth of why he hasn't contacted any of Harry’s Muggle friends. Draco couldn’t really be with them knowing an important part of their little group was missing.
“My transfer to the hospital I wanted to study in was approved,” Draco says, and his grin is genuine.
He hasn’t left his home in days, and he can’t recall the last time he took a bath. His hair is sticking up everywhere, and he knows for a fact that the bags under his eyes have grown to a worrying level. He feels he’s lost some weight, although the idea of looking at his paler-than-normal figure in the mirror is nauseating. If he does this, he knows all he’ll see reflected in him is the man Harry hates.
He listens to the voice in his head reminding him what Harry needs right now is space. He needs rest and familiarity, not an agonising display of affection. Draco convinces himself it’s the bond’s magic, electric, crackling between them, and not his own feelings surfacing through his fingers.
Healer Cameron points at the corridor, excusing themselves and waits until Draco follows to close the door behind them.
"This is excellent work gossip, you have to pay attention." Pansy flopped onto his bed, at home like she was Ron or Hermione. "Turns out, she’s been stealing player Healer records. Her father is trying to pay to make it go away." Harry dropped the clothes he was gathering in the bedroom in shock.
However, having your skin against mine wasn’t disturbing, it was hot and different, but safe. It distracted me from the distant thunder of the music pounding in my chest, making my heart beat faster than it intended, and the disconcerting sensation of bodies bumping against mine.
Ruby stalks up to them, meowing like the world is ending. She jumps on the couch, settling on Harry’s thighs as his hand comes up to pet her head distractedly.
Sirius also kept lists. Not a journal per se; all loose. But there were lists of things to teach Harry, things to tell Moony, the Quidditch rankings. He favoured Puddlemere.
"I don’t know if I feel up for anything stressful," Harry said as Draco led him down to the kitchen.
“Hi...” Potter starts, and everyone turns to him. “I’m Harry. Harry Potter. My parents died when I was little and I—I didn't know who they were until I was eleven. I'm lost. I think I... sometimes I wish I wasn’t myself. That I didn't have this name.”
Draco recoils to his side of the couch, trying to keep the lump in his throat from making him choke. He isn’t even sure what’s the right answer, if there is one. “I’m sorry. I... I thought you wouldn’t believe me. That you would resent me. I was a coward.” Still is. He’d have found reason to keep it for longer, if it was not for Pansy. And to be fair, Draco doesn't think he would believe himself.
"Consider yourself lucky. It's a powerful house that wants you to be the owner. One of my clients was tossed out of their window by their house while
"I’m not obsessed. I told you. I like it. Sometimes I wish I had more of the put-together thing you’ve got going on," Harry admitted.
He wishes he could apparate to his destination, but he’s too afraid of that, of being pulled by the darkness, or the void, of being sucked into this place and disappearing forever like so many other things have. Instead, Draco keeps walking around the house at a slow and strenuous pace.
“You seem to be recovering well,” he says, at the same time Harry’s rough voice enunciates, “You seem to be doing well.”
Draco had started the research on his own, but as soon as Pansy and Granger got wind of it, they joined him. And since he needs help to go through this material and to determine what is useful for their case, he agreed to work with them. He’s thankful for that now. The company releases some of the pressure inside his chest, reminding him they’re doing this because Harry’s life is at stake, and also Granger’s preliminary knowledge on the curse will probably be helpful.
He is standing still, his foot tapping the floor anxiously, as Pansy disperses the crowd that has formed there and calls for Hermione.
Harry gives him an unimpressed glance and shoves him against a wall, hands on his hips and lips all over his neck, because allegedly Draco’s very sexy when he’s a haughty prick. The books don’t fall and Draco can’t complain.
The hope that he might, one day, get his husband back dissipated during those groveling weeks. But he can, at least, ease their path, and answer whatever questions Harry might have. If Draco can convince the wizard that he’s a better man now then maybe… maybe Harry’s magic won’t flare again when he sees Draco. Perhaps Harry won’t hate him so much.
"I know Ginny. God, I’m not trying to…" Harry could feel the edge of his mood tipping fast towards something more sad than pensive. But her smile was steady, and she kicked at him again playfully.
Ron tipped his head back against the wall before speaking. "I asked my dad. He told me that Mum was recruited to be a champion duellist straight out of Hogwarts. And when he decided he loved her, he was ready to wait for as long as it would have taken for her to come back to him. If she wanted to tour the whole world, he would have waited. She didn’t end up doing it obviously. But that’s how I felt about Hermione. She didn’t owe me anything. I knew she might finish uni and meet someone else. But I waited."
He hasn’t seen her since the day Harry woke up and the Weasley matriarch came marching down St Mungo’s threatening anyone who tried to keep her from seeing her adopted child.
"That’s just the way magical houses are sometimes. I dunno. Mum and Dad said the Burrow put in an additional room before they even knew they were having Ginny."
"I don't know," Draco replied. Draco's shirt was buttoned up wrong. He shoved his hand in his pocket roughly and pushed his hair back from his face with the other.
to push him around in bed—and put a steady arm across Harry's chest pulling them closer still, with small movements of his hips. He wrapped a hand around him then and in the end, Harry didn't know what tipped him over the edge. Only that Draco followed with a soft "oh fuck" as if he was surprised.
Pansy slowly shakes her head, her tone is now distant, not worried, but resentful. “Draco, you’ve lost your mind and crossed every limit with this. You can’t play with his life like this.” She raises a finger, pointing at his chest. “You’ll tell him today, Draco. Or I will.”
"Curtains? Enough with the crank calls. You call again and I’m phoning the police and your school, Timothy. You ought to be ashamed of yourself," someone Harry called at the Harrods said before hanging up.
"I learned about SafeHome when they brought a group of Wizarding kids to watch a match during my second season. They were a much smaller organisation then they are now. Many of those kids told me that the best part of the match was that they could meet me."
"Thank you!" they said in chorus. Each child got a chance to come up and shake his hand before queuing. Rose walked around the press table and launched herself into Harry’s arms instead. She was getting taller, looking more and more like her parents. He had to remember to get in a bit more kid time before training started.
“Draco…” Pansy’s tone turns softer at his display of weakness, and Draco hates it. He hates she’s being condescending with him because she thinks he needs it, needs to be pitied. “Does Harry know about it?”
Draco expects to see that exchange with Harry in the news the next day, and he smokes half of his new pack of cigarettes waiting for it, but it doesn’t happen and nobody at St Mungo’s actually comments on Harry’s presence there. He gathers that it has probably become something common during Draco’s time off and that he won’t get a chance to see Harry again. He’s not that lucky.
Draco’s rational side wants him to say. He can’t. He can never say no to Harry, to this, as much as the panic threatens to overtake him. Draco is too far gone to care.
One day, when Harry sees Draco’s violin—one of the few things he managed to remove from the Manor—among the boxes he brought from his flat, he asks Draco to play. Draco does then, and  again and again whenever Harry feels anxious. And it is the sounds of the violin, and Ruby’s purr, and Harry’s laughter that make the cries of hate fade in the background of Draco’s life.
"We’re going to be late for Astoria’s party, aren’t we?" Draco asked when Harry dropped to his knees before the piano bench. Draco was the one to push his clothing out of the way.
"I owe you a Life Debt. If you had wanted to invoke it, I would be here anyway with considerably less money to show for it." His tone was bitter.
The fight leaves him. His grin falls and his heart feels so heavy. How did that happen? What is he going to do now?
"I think your version of us being friends includes this," Draco said, gesturing at the bed. Harry wanted to deny it but it was true. Sex was better than nothing. Having Draco a little was better than not having him at all. Even if it hurt.
Draco watched closely as Harry put on his glasses, picked through the collection, and put on a record.
, Draco repeats mentally, as the weight of his body crashes against the wall. Harry will be better without him. Now that he knows the spell he’s performed on Elle works, he can devise a new way to keep Harry’s soul on this plane without being connected to another soul like it is now. Draco’s not sure how to do that yet. Not the spell, he’s confident enough that he can work it out, but living without sharing their souls.
Marvin probably sees it in his face, because Draco is blessed with another one of his reassuring smiles before the man is turning his head to the door.
“Nobody knows what I did, except for Charlie,” Harry continues. “Apparently we had a thing.” He grimaces, not as much in distaste as Draco would have hoped, but in confusion. “He’s back in London for a couple of weeks and filled me in about my time in Romania.”
“I feel more like myself today.” But somehow it had much less to do with my appearance than with these feelings. I was full, and whole, and a quiet and tentative hope settled in my chest.
"The second is that we are practising precision. The difference between a good Quidditch player and a great Quidditch player is a few seconds, a half inch, or a slight angle."
And then he shoves all the others inside the water, gets up and vanishes everything, from the tub to the letters, with a wave of his wand. It’s beyond him how he even used that bathroom throughout the course of those years, when all it does is remind him of the baths he shared with Harry after terrible days at work.
At least verifiably true, and he paid the fine during the Quidditch World Cup in Athens, though the pride party was nowhere near the event. He was more careful from then on.
Draco had most of the books transported from the Manor the previous week, refusing to set foot in the place again. Harry can’t stop complaining about the amount of books piling up on their flat—and, honestly, this isn’t even half of the Manor’s collection—and Draco, for the most part, refuses to shrink them. It could mess with their magic. Most of the magic in them is faint, some are dark, but Draco can feel it whenever he touches a page. Some of the volumes are older than their lineages and too important and delicate to mess with, but that’s a concept Potter doesn’t seem able to grasp.
Draco’s heart stops for a second, and he finally meets Harry’s eyes. But the man dodges his glance. “What…?”
Min-woo caught the Snitch in thirty. Harry was the first to pick him up onto his shoulder. He did not care whether the media was going to call him out again for being too boisterous. He didn't care if it was gloating. He patted Oliver on the back. He gave Atty a warm hug as tears streamed down her face.
"Wasn't sure you wanted me to," Harry replied. Draco was so close, drying off the last dish by hand with a brisk efficiency that told Harry, unlike most wizards, Draco had done that before.
Draco embraced him the way Harry would have preferred. Friendly. Plausible deniability. No evidence. Nothing to see. Harry didn’t want that. He didn’t want a polite victory, with an acceptable image of them side-by-side so no one would know. He wanted to tell people he loved Draco Malfoy. He wanted to celebrate like everyone else in public. Draco’s gaze registered the necklace and Harry felt exposed.
The two years after Vincent’s birth are the happiest in Draco’s memory. His father noticed his particular attachment to the young thestral and, instead of shooing Draco away like always, used the opportunity to indoctrinate him into the family business. He was put in charge of Vincent’s care, and, as soon as enough time had passed, his early training.
They often come to visit Harry, and Draco likes to think now they come because of him, too. He enjoys aunt Andromeda’s company immensely and is starting to believe it’s really easy to love a kid like Teddy.
It turned out that Draco knew quite a lot about satellites. When Andromeda called them for dinner, Harry had drifted into a half sleep. Teddy raced downstairs.
"The way I see it, cheering for the Cannons is neutral," Ron said. Ginny rolled her eyes. They had both heard this before, but he persisted.
up to have him back by his side. They can’t take this away from him now. They can’t take Harry from him again.
"That's an impressively elaborate ploy for very little information. There’s no way he let you out early with all that," Harry said, picking his clothes off the floor.
Afterwards, Harry bought a salad and took the train back to London, getting in late enough that there were no signs of Malfoy when he returned home. Harry went to shelve the records. He was certain he would run out of space, but then the house shivered and gave him an extra shelf, so they all stood up straight.
“You see me almost every week,” Draco argues with no veritable force, but Blaise only laughs, pushing the door, and doesn’t reply.
The Healers cleared Harry to join training again with a warning to come back if his shoulder twinged.
When he wakes up, he’s not sure for how long he’s been sleeping. It doesn’t feel like long, for the way his limbs move with ease as he sits back from where he’s been slumped over Harry’s body, despite the previous soreness from his stroll into the woods.
“I…” Draco starts, and the words are so low and raspy he clears his throat before continuing. “Would you like anything to drink?”
Draco’s eyes widen a bit. Harry has never offered before, and Draco has never asked, content in imagining the space in secret. Harry is always with him, anyway, the rest shouldn’t matter.
"Do you think you’re funny?" Pansy pursed her lips, nostrils flaring. Harry wisely declined to respond. He had remembered. Very late.
The curtains fly open somewhere to his right, bathing the room in blinding sunlight and warmth. Draco closes his eyes against the brightness.
Draco’s stomach twists dreadfully. Whatever Harry is feeling, it doesn’t seem like something that will make Draco happy. It’s dark and painful, filled with guilt and doubt.
"It was eighth year. You weren't there. It was just a weird time. All any of us did was study, drink, have breakdowns, and have weird grief sex. It was like the world’s worst ongoing orgy."
"If you are getting married, I’ll look over the marriage contract. You’re the top athlete in the league. Do you remember what happened to Giannopoulos?"
Harry wasn’t all that good at Galleons to pounds conversion but he nearly had a stroke. He didn’t spend that much on anything that wasn’t practical, and this was an eye-watering expense. These sheets must have been woven and enchanted by Merlin himself.
Harry rubbed his face in his hands. No one had ever told him being Captain entailed this much emotional management.
"Any questions about Quidditch, young reporters?" Pansy redirected. They all sat up straighter when she passed. Her heels clicked on the floor over the hum of the giggles and side conversations.
He’s been researching non-stop about Elle’s case, but it’s not like he hasn’t been doing that for years with no success. Nothing new comes forth, and if Draco’s not given up already it’s because he won’t be able to live with himself knowing he didn’t do everything possible to help his patient.
She backs away when he pushes her arm, finding no resistance in his limbs, which is surprising for someone who seemingly stayed for weeks in death’s embrace.
Harry knew he was being dismissed. Perhaps he could explain that he was tired, and his ankle was bothering him again, and he always worried it was the first sign of the end of the road for his career. That he wasn’t sure if the food was made or stolen, and it made his skin itch.
"Sweetheart." Only Blaise could make an endearment sound like an insult. "As much as it brings me great pleasure to deny you anything, we can't help you with your house." Then he sat back, "But if you bring me a tin of these, I'll tell you more." He tapped a yellow plastic container on his desk.
"We’ll just want to check if there’s anything that works well with the house first, but I can sell it for a fee."
“I still can’t believe you bet you’d pose nude,” Harry snorts. His hands are hidden in his jeans pockets, eyes locked on the art building from where students swarm out, probably just after a class.
“I’d never wish to make you uncomfortable,” Draco starts, and finds his voice is raspy and low, eyes cast down on the surface of his untouched coffee. His fingers are shaking wildly. He clasps them under the table firmly and prays that his voice will come out even. “I... I did despicable things in my past, you have every right to hate me. I will do anything I can to...”
"Grand-aunt Wally," Draco said. Harry couldn’t read his expression, but Draco didn’t sound all that happy to see her. "Harry, come here."
Harry grins softly, kissing Draco’s hand before taking it in his own. “I will always forgive you, Draco. And love you. You know that.”
Harry hesitates, his eyes darting from a point over Draco’s left shoulder to the interior of the house.
"I’ll sign something, if it helps," Harry said. He did it rarely because there was always a question of whether he should be neutral as a public figure.
“I don’t want that on there,” Harry had said, mustering as much calm as he could. “We can take more photos. New photos!”
Pansy recoils. She suddenly seems smaller and hurt. She recovers quickly, straightening her shoulders. “I’m your Healer, Potter. I need you to communicate with me, if I’m to heal you.”
He sits down, finally, in his usual chair, back toward the window and the table below that will hold whatever food the group brings for the meeting. This time, Draco brought some leftovers moussaka his boss let him take from Egeu, the restaurant where he works that serves Mediterranean cuisine. His eyes are fixed on the door and anyone coming in.
Draco wishes he could reply with this, but it’d be a lie their souls would pick up instantly. If Harry hadn’t crossed his path, depressed and broken two years after the war, Draco is not sure if they’d have ended up here, if he’d have fallen for him, transforming the obsession of years into something healing and beautiful.
Harry laced his boots left foot first. He never ordered seafood the day before a match. He always had to be first on the pitch from their team's walkout. And he added in the necklace Draco gave him. He brought it up to brush his lips against the cool metal briefly before kicking off.
He shouldn’t have smoked—he had made a promise to Harry many years ago—or lapsed into drinking again like that, Draco knows this much. But he’s feeling lighter and the guilt won’t trap him. He went out; he saw people and had something close to fun, by what he can gather from the flashes of memories.
Her face is flushed. Though crinkles have made their way into the corner of her eyes earlier than he’s seen happen to anyone else at this age, this is the youngest he’s ever felt Elle to be.
Even Oliver and Sam, who were all in on new Quidditch techniques, swore up a storm. Atty seemed to get it the fastest, but even she couldn’t manage it consistently. Once she slipped sideways, and Luc caught her on his broom.
Draco doesn’t turn until the voice echoes in the quietness. “Hello,” the man says. “Can I buy you a drink?”
You turned to the side, the corner of your lips turning up slowly, head coming to rest on my chest. “I thought a lot about it over the years. Therapy helped, you should try it.” You sounded confident, when you stated, “This is who I want to be. This is me.”
