It had been Professor McGonagall, who was standing up, along with Headmaster Dumbledore and the other three House Heads—Professor Sprout for Hufflepuff, Professor Flitwick for Ravenclaw, and Professor Snape for Slytherin.
His parents really weren’t the Howler-sending type, and he only got a very sternly-worded letter from them the day after Sirius’s. The godawful, everchanging castle stairs only messed him up twice on the way to classes. Even though he couldn’t practice his flying, McGonagall had never said anything about giving Ron pointers for his upcoming Gryffindor Keeper tryouts from the ground. Watching his best friend’s clean turns and dives, Harry genuinely, unbiasedly had no doubt that he would make it.
It was not Lily or James Potter’s voice that thundered across the hall.
Now, with her large brown eyes zoned in so sharply on him, he chickened out again.
“Looking for something, Weasley?” A horribly familiar sneer appeared in the doorway. Harry also caught a flash of pretentiously-styled hair and long, pale fingers. Scabbers the rat dangled in between those fingers, writhing and squeaking in panic.
Harry thought to himself. The first punch he’d thrown had also been the last of the fight, if it could really be called that. The weak baby had fled the moment blood had started flowing from his nose, heading straight to the conductor to tattletale like a five-year-old. Harry didn’t see how it was his problem that Malfoy’s father had never taught him how to throw a proper punch.
“You can have my sweater if you want, Harry.” Peter Pettigrew, the second of his parents’ best friends, offered kindly. Unfortunately, his bright red, newt-patterned sweater did not seem like a huge step up from Harry’s current daffodil situation.
Hermione cuddled her cat protectively. “Like Harry said, this isn’t the first time your rat has gone missing, and this isn’t the first time you’ve wrongly accused Crookshanks! It’s not our fault that you can’t keep track of your own pet!”
“...I’m sure everyone won’t mind,” Fred finished.
Harry whirled towards him, and was rather startled to see a matching badge on his robes as well.
“Do you really want him back, Weasley?” Draco Malfoy leaned casually against the frame of the door, bouncing Scabbers up and down by the tail as if he were a yo-yo. “A bit shabby for a proper wizard’s animal companion, isn’t he?”
With two of the greatest people in the world now by his side, Harry felt as if he could handle anything this school year had in store for him. Even...
“I’d do it again in a heartbeat.” Harry squeezed her shoulder. His eye caught on a new glint on her robes. It was a recognizable badge, laid in their house’s trademark red and gold. The metal ribbon in the middle spelled out Hermione’s new title in bold, capital letters.
“I don’t want to hear it, Mr. Potter,” she cut him off with an invisible blade. “You’ve just sent another student to the
Meanwhile, James Potter had been the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team during his years. His father had led the house to total victories in his three-year reign, and had actually been scouted by a few professional teams. But his true dream had been to start a family with Lily, and so he’d found a career as a Transfigurator for a private shipping company closer to home.
Harry supposed that his father’s banana-yellow wool sweater might’ve been considered acceptable during his time at 70s’ Hogwarts, possibly even flattering with his broader physique. But with Harry’s scrawnier body and even scrawnier amount of confidence, the sweater made him look like a deflated bottle of mustard. A long-expired bottle of mustard.
Sweetheart Cedric struggled to find someway to defend Malfoy, but this proved to be a great challenge. Not much could be said about Draco Malfoy’s personality, if his own housemates, his own
“I read it in this year’s edition of the student handbook.” She cut a little smugly into a sausage. “Which you two should get started on reading as well.”
Mudblood was a slur for muggle-born magic-wielders, coined by self-important “pureblood” families such as the Malfoys. It needlessly labeled, tainted, millions of incredible witches and wizards all over the world. Bright sparks like Hermione Granger. Like Lily Potter.
Cho Chang, Ravenclaw’s Seeker. Harry’s crush for the past year. She seemed even prettier than she had been the year before, her silken, ink-dark hair a little longer, her cheeks a little rosier with slight embarrassment as she stood.
She looked in between the three of them, and though it was well-veiled, Harry thought he could see a hint of affection. Her protectiveness of her students had always made her James Potter’s favorite professor.
“How-” The professor sputtered. Her office door was protected by multiple complex magical wards. “How did the two of you-”
Both voices were cut off by the sound of Harry sliding the door open, their owners immediately whirling towards his arrival.
His smile dropped.
“I actually like that a lot more than ‘Good morning.’” He meant it. “Good moon to you too, Luna.”
“I do not!” Had that comparison really been necessary right in front of Cho and Cedric?
“I suppose your outburst was not entirely unreasonable, Mr. Potter. I will ensure that Mr. Malfoy faces his consequences as well. Fifteen points from Gryffindor, and I shall lessen your own punishment.”
“Absolutely not. This is lined with genuine dragon hide.” Sirius betrayed him.
But he had always thought that he and Ron were on a closer, lower academic level. Together, they’d always teased Hermione about her looming stacks of books, then begged her for the first paragraph of their essays on the history of Portkeys due the next morning.
There was something peculiar about Malfoy’s reaction to her insult, a strange paleness that suddenly came over his already-fair skin, making him look as if he’d seen a ghost. Making him look like a ghost himself. Perhaps it was just Harry’s imagination, but he could’ve sworn that there was almost... fear, in the boy’s thin face.
Unfortunately, around the same time Harry had begun to like her, she had started going out with Cedric Diggory. Six-foot-one, perfectly-coiffed hair, endearing-dimples Diggory. That was just his luck in romance. Of course, he had already been seated next to Cho, and flashed her one of those devastatingly beautiful smiles now. She grinned back with equal happiness. Harry, something ugly curling in the pit of his stomach, forced himself to applaud. Just like Ginny, he would have to get over it.
, Harry realized glumly. He wished he himself had thrown on something nicer than a wrinkly, ancient Weird Sisters T-shirt.
Now, if only he could find the someone else who was willing to do the same.
the year of house unity.
Harry turned desperately to his father for help. But James Potter looked just as mournful, hugging his now-bare arms for warmth. “Mind your mother. And what’s wrong with my sweater?”
“Where was your significant other?”
They sat there snuggled together for a while, both content, happy and enjoying the silence.
“How’s it going?” she asked, lifting her book up slightly so she could see his face.
Love BobIII xxx
The start of the year feast was extravagant as always. Draco hadn’t had a proper meal in ages so he ignored the wary looks people were giving and just dug into the food. The eighth years sat with the houses as they always had so Draco was surrounded by his fellow Slytherins, a mix of those who took part in the war and those who didn’t.
“You were such a little a git!”
“GINNY!”
This broke them out of there trance. Because out of everyone in the room, that had sounded like Ginny.
“The magnificent Potter wants to be my partner?”
“Ginny? Quidditch probably”
“Nothing.”
“Hmmph”
“So?” Hermione queried?
Draco ignored all this and walked straight to the eighth year’s bedroom, which was slightly large for only one person. None of the Slytherins had come back. He unpacked his things and sat on his bed, it was going to be a long night till lessons tomorrow.
I've been using my puppy dog eyes to get the both of you to put up with my nonsense for a very long time!
"Maybe you shouldn't sing the kids to sleep with a song that tells them you're a creep and a weirdo!"
Since you are not home yet, I'm assuming that you are either having a lot of fun helping little Mac settle into his new home, or you're having a hard time reassuring him that everything is going to be alright now. What sort of situation was he in? What are the names of these muggles that were supposed to be taking care of him, and where exactly do they live? Note, I had absolutely nothing to do with it if they disappear in a couple of months.
Pull yourself together Harry, you're supposed to be getting your thoughts out, not tenting your trousers in the middle of the kitchen!
"NO!!! FUCK YOU MORE!!!" Harry returns, physically picking up a book to hurl at Draco.
I nodded. "Of course. I assure you, I can dominate and whip you without expecting to shag you as my reward."
So I dropped by Unity House for a bit today. I *meant* to stop by your office and snog the bloody hell out of you, but I got distracted by the kids reenacting (and doing a rather good job playing) the song "Trashing the Camp." I don't know why, but I *love* that song, and so I ended up summoning my guitar and making some thumping noises as they banged on rubbish bins and glass jars and the like. They had a *blast* tearing up pieces of paper and tossing them all over like confetti.
I guess technically I only killed Quirrel and helped Voldemort off himself, but I did kill a century old basilisk when I was 12. I wonder if I should add that to my count?
Thus, tea ran long and was a *lot* of catching up between the family members. My father used the opportunity to go out to a pub or a pureblood wizard only club with Ivan. They actually get along rather well when grandmama isn't trying to rile my father up. Ivan has a terrifically dark sense of humor when grandmama isn't around to keep him in check, haha.
I know that she's only six months old and not quite ready for solid food, but Viona seemed interested in everything we ate, and whenever I gave her a small taste of something, she seemed to love it every bit as much as I did. If this girl travels with us all the time, she's going to be quite the connoisseur!
One girl of about 14 looked up at me in surprise. We had actually hidden about a hundred Galleons all over the grounds for students to find if they were vigilant. Also, lots and lots of biscuits in stasis charms simply to give reluctant students a reason to participate. In any case, there was one golden crown charmed so only girls could see it and one set of golden antlers that only boys could see.
"FUCK YOU!"
Harry
Poor Hermione. Maybe I shouldn't have brought her into this. She seems to be taking these things so hard. No matter how much you prepare for parenthood, there's no way of understanding the constant fear that comes along with it. You think it will be gooey baby kisses and night feedings, first words and potty training. But the reality is this constant worry that any decision you make will utterly ruin them. Will letting our babies go on a weekend vacation with their loving grandparents and cousins give them a lifetime complex of thinking their parents didn't love them enough to spend every minute with them? Will spending every minute with them turn them into codependent adults who have no idea who they are except who they are in relation to someone else? Yeah, actual thoughts that run through my head!
But sometimes I feel a bit like Arthur that first time he saw me sitting at his breakfast table; "Huh, what? Did we get a new child I don't know about? This one doesn't even have red hair!"
Harry and Draco play just a little bit, and then Harry tells Draco what his favorite part was.
He looked extremely relieved to have an excuse to escape the crowd. "Er, yeah, sounds good."
Anyway, moving on.
Amas Veritas,
P.S. I may or may not have something devious in mind for the camping at the festival.
Whoa whoa whoa! Calm yourself Iago!
Once I had my track suit on - which was fashionably done in shades of blue - you helped me pull my hair into a messy pony tail. I know, my hair is only just barely long enough for a pony or a man bun, but having it just fly however it likes when I'm running annoys me, so pony it is.
My sanity,
Oh well, I suppose that's a worry for another time. NOW, I'm rather tired and am quite looking forward to going to bed. Hopefully you've returned from the stables. If so, prepare to be molested!
All of that was a long way to say that since I'd seen my gorgeous dragon friend flying near the edge of the forest closest to Hogwarts, I decided to take Oliver into the forest to meet with her. I always found it strange that she knew who I was, even in human form, but she does. Perhaps I smell the same in both forms?
: Hold me please! But as weird as you think it is, can we keep talking this way? I’m actually wondering if I broke my vocal cords or something because I’ve tried to talk a few times, mostly when you were responding a ton at once, and I’m still just squeaking and crying.
"I'm going to magic a harness on you and restrain you a bit, because for the first time at the very least, you really SHOULD NOT move. Not even to squirm uncomfortably," I warned him.
My heart is yours,
Thinking of you fills me with a wonderful feeling, I love everything about you, especially your touch,
They told me, as usual, how much they've enjoyed watching our children and our family grow. How amazed they are that they have more great grandchildren. And when I broke down a little, talking about my fears for Gabe and his health, my parents did their best to hold me - and Gods is that the worst part of being parentless, never having the feeling of being held by them that feeling of safety and love and warmth - and assure me that they were watching Gabriel, that he is growing and wonderful and they had every bit of faith that he would grow up safe and happy and loved.
Well shite. It's been a while since I've had to write one of these. Erm, whenever either of you get this will you please come down to the British Wizarding Embassy and come get me?
Hmm, maybe we should ask George if we have a tab.
I think that since I don't have much to write about anyway, I'll sign off here and see if I can entice Rita to come in after all.
Sunday October 10th
My Dragon,
I'm quite sure the Healer had no idea what to make of us, you sobbing a river and me laughing so giddily it sounded like I was sobbing too. The two of us holding each other and nearly jumping for joy. Our kiss that lasted long enough that she thought she had to break us up and get on with the appointment before the hour was up.
"This is a safe neighborhood" allows people to think they're better than those who live in "less safe" places.
Tuesday at 2:24 PM
But to recap, I had a chance to reexamine my life and came to the conclusion that I need to make an actual commitment to taking care of my mental health. Prior to now, I've been sort of catering to it, letting it control me. I'm going to be more proactive in controlling it instead.
It didn't take a lot of blood, maybe three mouthfuls, but then I was in the best mood ever. I felt like I'd used my bad side to do good. I felt like I'd saved the world from evil! I felt like I had the absolute BEST husbands in the world, and it was extremely important that I prove it to them.
Hannah and I both laughed.
Birthday August 8, 2018
Thankfully you were a bit calmer and took over. "No Princess, Harry and I are married, but Harry, AND Oliver, AND I are getting married. Harry and I proposed to Oliver while on holiday and he said yes!"
Harry! What'd'ja do to my baby?!?!
As I said, it was rather fun. After the presentation, the French Minister asked me to give them some time to discuss the matter, and so now, I am waiting in what I can only guess is some sort of official state guest waiting room. It's cozy, well decorated, full of comfortable furniture, and I've been provided with a lovely tea (not just the actual beverage but also a tray of tiny sandwiches and petit fours to go with it) and a nice bottle of Chateau D'or - which Pippa is helping me drink since it is rather excellent. She's also in love with the lemon poppyseed petit fours. I joked about her been pregnant ravenous, and then cast a pregnancy test spell on her.
And don't you worry Draco my love, I am sure that our beloved Minister Granger will send for backup when Hurricane Draco arrives. She knows precisely the team of men to call to tame that storm.
But getting to the point. McGonagall feels that if this were his O.W.L. or N.E.W.T. year, she'd go to the necessary lengths to accommodate his pregnancy so that he could focus on his studies, but since this is his Sixth Year, it might be easier on him all around to be removed from Hogwarts. Which was why she decided to talk to me before talking to you.
Harry,
What IS important is that over the past month or so, that potential informant managed to send Robards 2 (and a half, since one was extremely short) emails giving slightly clearer information. Enough to know that the criminal is, erm… not necessarily dangerous so much as an evil genius - so to speak. He is using his magic to con hoards of muggles into giving him a ton of money.
And you! You may have gone late with Zwei, but you went early with Eri and twins almost always come early, so you most likely have a lot less time ahead of you than I do. I feel fine about it now, but I assume you're going to have a bit of a nightmare on your hands come June!
Harry
I'm posting twice today because I'm so freakin' antsy to get y'all caught up to what we're writing today, heh heh heh...
And the worst part is, I am so proud of him. I love that he knows exactly what his priorities are and that he's across the world making it on his own. Starting his life with his wife. He's wonderful and brilliant and I just want him to be happy. This is just so damn hard.
"Congratulations, you are this year's Forest King," Luna informed him, resizing the antlers, that also formed a sort of crown, to fit his head.
Nearing 3 o'clock, a silvery intangible hare startled our team by bursting into the room. In a dreamy voice that could only belong to one person, it said: "Good afternoon Harry. I do hope you are enjoying your time away from Unity House. Nothing is seriously wrong, so please don't panic, it's just that we think one of the kids performed some accidental magic on one of the toilets, and now it won't stop flooding. I sent a Patronus to Greg, but he's off working on a custom playhouse for a paying customer and can't just drop everything and come help out, so I was wondering what you'd like me to do?"
That's a reference to you, in case you suddenly think I'm having heart problems. You're still so miserable! :-(
When even shaking him failed to rouse him, I told Viona to cast an Innervate on him. She did it nonverbally, but even so, I'm dead certain that she cast a stinging hex on him instead. He came to with a gasp that sounded like he'd been hit by the Cruciatus Curse. Huh... as I write this now, I have to wonder if that's actually what she cast...
I felt you were so focused on the child's rescue that you had blinders on and couldn't see the issues with Robards' behavior. I wasn't about to waste precious time in the session having a big blow-up. So I went around you.
You make me feel loved.
Even the best things have to come to an end eventually. We both started feeling worn out as the night danced on. We had to make our excuses and leave the party to the guests - and our girls - because we just couldn't stay any longer. So we came home and went straight to bed - both too exhausted to even shag.
"Sorry," she mumbled, looking away with a light blush.
I have no idea if she would have hexed him or kicked him in the bollocks, because before she even had a chance to react, I had uncontrollably Apparated right over to him and had him by the neck.
"Yes you did," I admitted with a soft smile before returning your kiss.
I nearly went to where the two of you were to ask. But no, what Rowe said has logic to it. Mahafsoun started acting this way after taking those potions, and the theory that they're affecting her badly makes enough sense that I figured that the only real solution to the problem would be to wait for the change to the potions to take effect.
"WHO IS THIS MAN?!"
First of all, thank you so much for holding me last night. It made a world of difference. I know you *say* you love me, and I guess I believe it most of the time, but there's always that little bit somewhere buried way down deep inside that cannot believe that *you* love *me.* I've done so many terrible things in my life that - Merlin! I'm only 19 years old and I've plotted murder and - trying as little as possible - nearly won a war before I just gave up and joined your side. I couldn't be open about it - of course - but I was on you side since about halfway through sixth year. I did what I had to, but my heart wasn't really in it. Probably why it took me so long to fix that mother buggering cabinet.
HOWEVER, I really don't think that I was wrong in overreacting. Especially now. See, just as you asked, I decided to come into the house and take a quick loo break to relieve myself and freshen up, and then head over to the two of you so that I could take our fussy baby girl into my arms and dance her to a much needed nap.
My beautiful husbands,
I have a job I love and am fulfilled by.
Your frustrated roar of :"I can't help it!!" Was just too cute.
I needed you to have a reminder of our reality. Something to hold onto when the babes are sleeping and I'm busy in the loo or something. So, last night I laid you down and undressed you. You argued a bit about not feeling ready for anything sexual. I hope you didn't think I was trying to pressure you. It wasn't meant to be sexual. The night of our anniversary, I gently kissed your entire body until you fell fast asleep. Last night I had a slightly different plan in mind. I bit and sucked, only gentling my kisses when I needed to soothe a spot I'd already marked. Thoroughly claiming you as mine. So, when you have a moment of panic, all you need to do is find some spot where I bit hard enough to break the skin or a spot where I sucked hard enough to leave a bruise. Every one of those spots is proof of my love, proof of reality, proof of us.
Then I sent Trey off to get himself ready, I had laid his little robes out for him, and made my way to the littlest set of almost triplets. Now I like to talk about how our babies are all brilliant little geniuses that are well ahead of any other baby, but I honestly get that the babies don't have any idea of what I'm talking about. They react to the tone of my voice, they like when I smile at them, but when I tell them all about how special today is, they have no idea what I mean. They currently don't care about anything beyond a clean nappy, a tummy full of milk, and snuggles.
That's when an emissary from Gringotts came in to do their own analysis. According to their magical scans, he is indeed Sirius Black, from the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black, according to their scans his original birthday (which we just missed I can't believe it! I forget everything!) was November 3, 1959 which would make him fifty, but his file with the Goblins automatically updated his birth year to 1973 the day he was spit out of the veil. Again, more proof that he is who he says he is and did not age beyond the veil.
She gave me a look like she could not believe that I seriously expected this half pint pixie to do so much as punch her with the force of a marshmallow. Interestingly, my timid mouse backed WAY up.
Fuck Harry! I have no idea how to respond to that information!!! On the one hand, Elena is 18, but on the other, she's still just my little girl! I immediately came up with a plan to create a minor emergency to occupy Antonio. I just wasn't sure if I was going to make his mother mildly ill so that he had to go home and nurse her back to health, or if I should hex him into an overnight stay at St. Mungo's.
I could see that I'd made the Viper uncomfortable, which he confirmed by deflecting. "Merciful Merlin man! Just exactly how many things do you have to put on your face?!"
I know I tell you that you aren't the ice prince, and that I can't believe I ever thought of you as icy. But. It is so cold here that I think we are all covered in a layer of frost! Donna's family was not kidding, we had no idea what winter felt like.
Age 19
Silly puppy,
"Draco! Draco, my love, you are NOT dreaming!" You shouted, still not letting me get a clear shot at our mostly beloved Healer.
"What are we celebrating?" The girls asked in unison. As I explained it to them, I gestured to and then looked over at Theo and Blaise. Blaise was staring at Kisa as if she was the first meal he'd seen in three weeks.
Hermione's having her baby!!! I'll be right there!
Ugh! My whole body aches! I feel like I fell asleep in class and my students took that as their cue to beat me half to death! Not to mention, I woke up about an hour earlier than usual because I felt like I needed to have an urgent and unpleasant conversation with the toilet, but once I got there, nothing happened. I ended up drinking from my never ending cup of milk while I waited to see if there was an actual reason my body woke me up so alarmingly, but nope. I soon felt right as rain. So, I tried to go back to bed, only I couldn't sleep because I was hungry, and upon reflection, I wonder if it was a gnawing hunger that woke me and I simply mistook it.
Also, I was more certain than ever that something wasn't quite right about him.
Beloved,
One of those humans is now nineteen weeks along, which means next week we have your checkup with Rowe and we should be able to find out what version we're getting! I am so excited! We can start seriously discussing names. Not that I didn't just LOVE all of your suggestions. I just … uh … they were all so lovely but I don't want to accidentally pick a name that one of our daughters has picked out for their baby.
Ginny and Viktor
Ciao,
I absolutely love that you tied me up before waking me this morning. It was a sensual and tactile delight to be helpless and struggling against my bonds as you teased the fuck out of me. First by finishing that licking and marking you started the other night - the jam was definitely involved - and then by having your glorious way with me.
First, I want to apologize, if I thought there were any other options I would have told you both what was happening. If I thought there was a way I could get around the instructions I was given, I would have done so. Unfortunately there would have been absolutely no way to tip you off without making it obvious you'd been tipped off. You see ... okay let me back up to the beginning. I'm sure my narrative will wander all over the place, but I will try my best to do this as chronologically as possible.
Harry
Oh, obviously it was our amazing public shagfest where I got to live out my puppy fantasies and feel thoroughly owned by you. Nope, although sweet Circe I will be wanking to that night for years!
"If you're serious, I am sort of a tiny bit attached to one of the younger boys at Unity Africa. He's that one who's about two with skin so black that it actually has a bit of a powdery look to it and makes his teeth damn near GLOW when he opens his mouth."
Draco
The last time the stalked man saw his work mate was... on a bus. He was on a date with his young girlfriend, when he looked back and noticed his work mate giving him a rather dark stare. He brought his girlfriend to his flat to cook her a nice dinner and watch some telly together - and had a feeling he was being followed, but when he turned to look, there was no one there. He didn't see his mate again, and then the mate turned up murdered.
But I also want to give you everything your heart desires, and you want kids. So with no real reason to need to wait, I decided that I don't want to wait either. And it's probably a good thing that I did because, well...
When we finally gave in and let you come, you came with a scream. Came down with a soft sigh. And immediately fell asleep with a smile on your face.
P.S. Pippa has us all scheduled to meet with our Mind Healers before we even THINK about buggering off on holiday.
In roughly six or seven weeks we will reveal what's going on. Our family will be thrilled to hear they're getting a new life to add to our ever growing circle. Our children will be so happy to hear they'll be getting another brother or sister. But for now, it's just this precious thing between you, me, and the bun.
"YESS!!!" Eris hissed. "You'll LOVE Inuyasha!"
Friday, July 21st
"Lovely!" The female interviewer purred; I think her name was Siobhan. "Draco Malfoy, would you please come out here for a few minutes?"
For our drinks, I had my never ending cup of milk with me, and ordered a nice bottle of Cuveé Diamant for us to share, and we each had tea. Although, I think you might have ordered an espresso while I was in the loo for a moment because you got a tiny cup of something that smelled good. I know you love that vile stuff, so I'm not sure why you - actually, you probably just forgot until I was away from the table and a server came to check on us.
"Jumping up and down in excitement, he exclaims: 'Grandmum!' Then he races outside to greet her - using a large dog door because he couldn't quite turn the doorknob. Except that he sees a man getting out of the car. His joy and excitement gets even bigger. 'DADDY!!!' He runs and throws himself into the man's arms.
Thursday July 28, 2016
Which is good news if I've ever heard any. The babies are healthy. I'm more or less healthy, simply easily tired. And your tour is soon coming to an end. Unless you're invited on a few more stops.
I should sign off now and pay attention to the breathtaking view, but before I do, what was it you were going to say about Donnie? You said: "Draco, you won't believe what I saw Donnie doing!" And then you were interrupted and forgot all about telling me the rest of the story, so now I'm mildly dying to know.
Just like those beautiful memories you're predicting all of our kids will be taking with them to school. Quidditch and birthday cakes and halloween costumes. Memories of us being loving with eachother, kissing each other, while they pretend to be disgusted by it but will later be glad they were always able to see how in love their fathers are.
"Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling, do you feel my heart beating, do you understand, do you feel the same, am I only drea~~~ming, is this burning an eternal flame?" Shtara and Elena led the others through the soft but powerful back up vocals. "I believe it's meant to be, darling, I watch you when you are sleeping, you belong with me, do you feel the same, am I only dreaming, or is this burning an eternal flame? Say my name, sunshine's through the rain, a life so lonely, and then come and ease the pain, I don't want to lose this fee~~ling, OHHHHHH!..."
Missing you too,
You didn’t ruin anything my love. Holding your hand and staring into your eyes while that heartbeat came out loud and clear? I have no words. I am so torn because I don’t want to be insensitive and I don’t want to rub it in, but I have a piece of you growing inside of me. It’s just. I can’t. I love you more and more every day. Every day I think I love you the most amount of love possible and then bam, the next day I love you even more.
The only other part of her speech that caught my attention was when she talked about how her brother loved her kids. How he doted on them, watching them when she needed him to, and was basically wrapped around their tiny fingers. This made me wonder WHEN AND IF Robards ever bloody slept?! Sigh...
But best of all was that I could see it in your eyes when you wanted 'rescuing' and so, would excuse myself from my own dance partner to go over and cut in on yours. This happened so often (about a third of the times that you agreed to dance with others) that it became something of a fond joke the others told as they gazed at you adoringly. We danced together nearly half of all the total dances, and your skill improves dramatically when you're in my arms. Or at least I'm paying so much attention to your perfect green eyes that I completely don't notice what your feet are doing.
Dear Draco,
Oh thank all the Gods. I have no control. I have no worries. No power. I just get to BE.
All of my love,
I'm giving him something he can feel, all my lovin', to let him know, this love is real,
Draco
This morning we woke up with one of those cozy, let's stay in bed, warm chats. Soft kisses and whispered words. And come to find out his issues don't stem from seeing the face of his ex in miniature bringing back bad memories. They stem from seeing exactly what he and Edmond were robbed of by his ex-in-laws. In bright colors and baby-soft skin, he held a baby that looked like what a baby of theirs could have looked like. The exhaustion and hormones were intense that all he could focus on was the unfairness of it all.
I gave her an impish grin. "Do it again, but this time, step to the RIGHT."
Monday July 26th
AO3 was having unicorn issues today and I thought my computer had a virus. I totally freaked out and had to run virus scans and then I noticed that it only happened on AO3, so I looked up their Twitter and found out it was just them, lol, phew!
"Alright, I see Eris, she's handing Luka off to Hazel, who has promised to watch him for the night. After that, she Apparates to a shadow near a large house - almost a mansion. From the shadow, she walks to the front door, which is wide open and it's clear before she even takes a step inside that there's loud music blaring and a party in full swing.
Therefore, once all the paperwork is completed, Antonio Litwin will be transferred from the Ministry holding cells to Unity House - where Greg is busy working on the other thing you had to agree to - making sure he had his own room he could be locked up in *if necessary* to ensure the safety of the other children. He will stay at Unity House until his trial for the murder of his father - at which point, he will either be convicted and sent to prison, or cleared and returned to his mother - presuming that she's in any condition to care for him by that point.
"Yes sir," Ramsey grumbled in acceptance.
Friday October 19th
"I... huh... I guess I'm pretty brilliant then?"
You want an assistant? But that's what you have me for!
I myself have been spending most of the day getting the two rescues we got a few weeks ago ready to go home. They've been working hard on rebuilding that barn and it should have been done this upcoming Monday, but in the meantime these horses actually found a forever home so they won't be going back to their fosters anyway. The timing works out great since I was panicking a bit about what I was going to do about them while we're gone.
P.S. I was a bit panicked when I read you saying you made a bonehead mistake and overcompensated. I was worried you had strained your magic. I'm really glad it was just you spoiling our children and not hurting yourself!
Not that I am going to force her to leave Hogwarts, I won't be one of those parents from years ago sending their daughter to some unwed mother's home to hide a pregnancy and then bring her home without her baby. Or, even worse, do that creepy thing where the parent raises the child as their baby brother or sister. Gross.
Parker (Ballard) Wood
I wanted you immediately, but I wasn't necessarily in a rush to get to the main event. I didn't even really care what you'd set up, I just walked to where you were sitting and climbed in your lap, kissing you softly and slowly. I'm not sure how long we just stayed that way, no groping hands or grinding hips, just sweet kisses while breathing in each other.
Robards smiled at Morgana. "She's gotten bigger since I last saw her."
I know you were so so so tired Draco, but you seemed to really have messed with your sleep schedule! It's the middle of the day Saturday and you're sound asleep. You basically went to sleep yesterday when everyone else was waking up and pretty much slept until it was time for the rest of us to go to bed. Then by the time you were tired again it was late this morning. We have a big celebratory dinner planned in about an hour Love, we're going to need you there. You're a very important part of the celebrating you know!
"Switch!"
As much as I wanted to stalk after them and show them exactly why it's never a good idea to mess with me, I had more important things to deal with. Crossing my arms over my chest, I stared you down. "Oi mutt! Calm the fuck down! Rage isn't good for the baby!"
I desperately wanted to be in the room with you, but Rowe snarled at me that there simply wasn't room with all the TRAINED staff she needed, and so, I was curtly ordered to take my kids home, or if that was too far away from you for me to handle, the nearest waiting room.
"Oh shut up!" A portrait I recognized as sounding like my great Aunt Hortentia Malfoy commanded. "YOU are not even a real Malfoy!"
And for the rest of the day, every time he saw someone in the family for the first time he told them, "It's my Jazzy's day, you have to tell her Happy Birthday and give her extra hugs and kisses!" And then he would stare them down until they did as commanded. He's a very fierce little general when it comes to making sure his little sister is treated well.
Draco
Fine," I said with a heavy exhalation. "Let me just write out a voucher for a Million Galleons to fund the Mental Health department. I want the money to be used to hire more staff, better train the ones you have, and probably most important of all, offer free screenings to anyone who seems like it might benefit them."
Instead, we were halfway through the soup when I heard the floo go off, and then the two of them storming into the dining room. Our River, ever the little boy, shouting "Oi! Who's a guy gotta bribe around here to get himself a bowl of Muffy's famous leek and potato?" Which of course was followed by shrieking, squealing, and excited tears. I'm not sure how anyone else reacted though. I would have knocked over an old lady to get to my little River!
Yours,
Smiling, I gave him exactly what he wanted until you came home and quite possibly passed out before you had fully flopped into our bed.
Shtara Malfoy
Thus, when I walked into the Russian Equivalent of the Ministry, I had Jaz on my arm like a little lady, Pippa at my back, with Vani and Leah flanking a bit to our backs. It was rather impressive even if it looked a bit like a weird foreign gentleman bringing a couple of noble girls for an odd fieldtrip.
Even though I have popped into Unity over the last two weeks here and there, and I came in yesterday after Healer Rowe came by, today is my first full day back at Unity House. Apparently they can survive without my constant presence. It's a relief seeing as I will be having a baby in roughly three months, but I also feel a little unimportant. So I drowned my sorrows in fresh biscuits and now my stomach is not happy with me.
Draco talks about love and plotting murder.
You stuck your tongue out at him. "I have a specific type, and it's blond, arrogant, vain, and domineering."
As I was debating this in my head, it slowly occurred to me that the shape was not that of a deer. Nope, it was a human. I got to watch as a somewhat husky man was unbutchered, unmurdered, and dragged away in a presumably drugged unconscious state. I was frankly amazed that the old man had the strength to do so by himself!
WHAT?!?!
"I hope you realize that no matter what you learn about yourself, Harry will love you as much as he ever did," I reminded him.
Tonight was rather unexpected, wasn't it?
Harry and Oliver watch Draco sleep for a bit, and Draco learns a bit from the police.
"Oi, not so loud! The LAST thing I need is for one of my dads to hear you and come running. They're both cool, you know, trying their best to be supportive of my choices, but I can tell that they're really not okay with the things I want to do. My dad Harry keeps telling me directly that just because I know how to be safe, doesn't mean I should be doing anything in the first place. And my dad Draco... well, he seems a bit torn between..." he trailed off with a sigh and a shrug. Then continued. "Anyway, yeah, I've managed to find a bit of alone time with a girl or two - long enough to practice a few things on her. It's makes me happy to make HER happy, you know?"
Actually, it might be easiest to have people custom order the device with the language they need translated and the language they need it translated into as the only two on the device. But anyway, I'm apparently running late for dinner now, and so had better wrap this up and get a move on it.
I have one more morning talk show tomorrow and then it's time to get ready for the Gala. Are you excited? I was already excited, I can't wait to see you full stop. But I really can't wait to spend the night in your arms.
I listened immediately. I'm not sure what everyone else did. But I've locked myself in our room. Please come home and remind me why I shouldn't hex our daughter's fiancé's father.
Some day her beauty (and she is gorgeous) might fade, but her smile that never dims will light up her face always. There may come a day when her voice will not be as strong, her range may shrink, and her lungs might falter, but her voice singing with joy will remain.
And that's when the floodgates let go. I have emailed you my feelings. We've talked in hushed whispers while watching our son sleep. It's not like I thought I'd really been bottling anything in, just trying to be calm in front of Zaire. "Oh Sirius, my little boy is hurting so much. We've only had him for such a short time and I already feel as though I'm failing him. I want to get him the moon and stars. I want to make it so that he never had to experience any of this trauma. I want to hurt anyone who had any hand in allowing the abuse he experienced. I want to scream and rage and sob to any gods that will listen that my son didn't deserve this!" I let it all out in a rush and ended on a choked sob, "but I have to be strong and brave for him. It's so hard."
January 10, 2001
"My dragon babies," I murmured, feeling a little guilty that it's been a while since I last checked on them. I mean they were doing really well and so I logically knew they weren't starving or lonely, but still, I felt like I'd be a complete bastard if I didn't go say hi to them on Christmas. Besides... I'd bought them presents.
Yes, yes, yes, Ollie. You tried getting my attention a full minute before the win. I just couldn't get over that Yeti!
Wow, we will talk about the other contents of your drawers later ...
Draco has another nightmare.
I thought the donation boxes were great. Just subtle enough to not be a blatant demand for money, but noticeable enough that people can easily donate without having to hunt them down. I love that they're actually shaped like Unity House! You had Greg build them I assume? Well he did a fantastic job! Right down to the deep blue shutters and front door.
My love, I uh, maybe, so .... er. Hmm. What if we took one of my regular sized toys, and then charmed it to -er- move and then you AND the toy were um together in me? Is that weird? I just was picturing yours and how mouthwateringly wonderful it is, then thinking about how odd a strap on would look next to it and then BAM now I have the idea of your cock and an extra in me at the same time. But, you're what I need, I'm not like a size queen or anything, I just, nevermind.
As for the hearing, after our lawyers made their case, Kingsley asked the opposition why they felt it was any sort of legal or fair to keep money that clearly belonged to Oliver. They (well, their lawyers) stated their position that they actually had no idea (prior to being served papers) that the money had come from Oliver. They always assumed that their son had simply earned or saved it from what they gave him, and had returned it to their vault for safety.
Meanwhile, from what I could tell, Ivan had secured a nearly immediate meeting with the Minister, and was somewhat anxious to rush me out of the Ministry so that he could get to it. He pounded me on the back genially.
You had been sitting on the edge of the bed next to me, but now you leapt to your feet and flung your hands out in frustration as you roared: "YOU ARE NOT AN AUROR!!!"
Love you more than I love myself,
Or, if you insist, we can replace Girl Draco with La Reina del Dragón. We'll call her Reina for short.
P.S. Don't worry, my big bad fox will keep your cute little marmoset nice and safe from the scary animals!
Draco talks about the reason Tabitha called for him.
When I asked if I could bring the trio, Tabitha actually insisted they would be helpful playing with the younger kids as a bit of a distraction from the boring process of paperwork and the anxiety-ridden process of waiting for their parents to come and get them.
Draco and Harry discuss how likely it is that Harry's life is like a fictional story.
Today was so much fun! I really do adore Donna's family, they're warm and welcoming, and I don't know if it's because they're American or because they have a beloved child who's a squib, or if they're just great people, but they are so accepting. They don't care that their child is a squib, the don't care that she's married to a muggle, they love their granddaughter and don't seem to care what level of magic she ends up with, they're great to us, they were very sweet to our kids, I'm just so happy to know them and happy that Dudley can see what this kind of family feels like. I definitely got the worse end of the deal being raised by his parents, but it wasn't so great for him either. They gave him terrible eating habits. They taught him to be spoiled and judgmental and a bully. He's had to work very hard to unlearn a lot from his childhood. You know how hard that can be!
Maybe because I'm pregnant, but I have to admit that it took a bit of effort on my part to hand Xander over. And it hurt just a little to leave without him. I kept thinking about the demon and how he or she would feel if the only person who'd held her for more than the time it took to feed or change her just suddenly abandoned her to strangers. I probably shouldn't have had him sleep in bed with us, but where else was I supposed to put him? In any case, I persevered and feel better now that I've had a decent night's sleep.
"Draco, this was lovely and look at how hard my boy is, it would seem he enjoys a good spanking almost as much as your mutt, but this seems to be a good punishment for after he misbehaves, what if I just want to keep him from getting into things before he has a chance to do something naughty?" Well now I know you must have talked, he had such an evil smirk that I'm sure he had to have known exactly what was going to come next. And I did too. One of my very favorites!
Monday June 16th
I had a blast last night at movie night. I am a bit sad that it wasn't like it used to be when we had a pile of babies on top of us, but just having Jaz with us gave me an excuse to hide my face in your hair while I cried. The whole movie is a tear jerker for me, I mean come on the little girl who lost her parents? And Nani, trying to be a parent and a sister and feeling like she's failing at everything. Just trying to wing it and hope you don't damage the tiny person you're surviving for? I spent the entire movie trying to figure out if I identify with Lilo or with Nani, or even as David when I think of my friend relationship with all of the Unity Kids throughout the years, and then at the end I was Stitch. "This is my family. I found it all on my own. It's little, and broken, but still good. Yeah. Still good." The only word in that sentence that doesn't resonate with me is "little."
Harry James Malfoy
Draco
I think I just really want to be home. My agent did mention that he had received some additional requests for stops on my tour but I told him I just didn't have it in me to extend this trip any further. I'm fine don't worry, but I am definitely feeling the exhaustion of trying to do this while 24-25 weeks pregnant. The sales of this first novel have been high enough that there will definitely be another tour when the second one comes out. And that will be in the fall, so we'll both have had our babies by then and we can all go together. So I told him to tell the stop requests that they will be our first stops on the next tour.
"You're clearly too drunk to see straight, dad! I'm NOT mom! Go find her!"
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day,
But we have many magical children. This isn't like our Shtara having no magic. The other kids are good about not rubbing their powers in her face and she loves the benefits that come along with living in a magical family. If this is something we have to keep away from Ren completely, how will we accomplish this without stifling the magic of everyone else?
She sized him up for a moment before nodding. "Alright." Then she gave me a shrewd look as she pulled off her Slytherin robes and tossed them off to the side. "Are there any rules? Any particular tactics I should use or avoid?"
"I'm certain you don't actually want to know. Ask any of the older kids and you'll learn that your dad and I do LOTS of weird shite like this. One time, Elena caught me licking jam off Harry's back."
I stroked her spine, deciding to speed things up before she cracked and blew our cover. "Normally, I like my potential lovers to play hard to get and challenge me, but from the first moment I laid eyes on you, I knew you were it for the night. So we can do this the long way by dancing and flirting, or we can just go find a hotel room."
I've already had a lovely morning and I'm about to head off to my second class. I had stopped in during the little break I have between my first and second hoping to see you but you were still sleeping. So I had to make due with staring at your beautiful, relaxed, sleepy face. Poor, sad, me.
Oh yeah, did the ladies forget to mention WHO took those fertility potions? Yeah, they fertility spiked Ron's wine. Later that night, he's all "bottoms up." And now our dear sweet Ron is pregnant with their ninth child!
You entered me with that groan you always make, like you just found heaven. At that point, you turned into a sweet and tender lover. I almost feel cherished! Clearly, this part of our marriage is always going to be fantastic.
"Good, come to my office and we'll see what we can do about getting our hands on that legal document they had her sign," Robards said.
Now if I so much as put a shirt in our closet he is pointing and smiling and Morgana is ready to fling every single item in an effort to make her baby giggle.
Along the same lines - and perhaps one of the biggest reasons I want this freedom - is that more than just playing mind and power games with others, I want the ability to actually twist them to my will when needed. The situation with Jules is the perfect example, he was looking to shag and I used that expectation and hope to get him in a position where he had to listen to me. I never wanted to actually shag him, and my desire to simply snog and grind with him on the dance floor died when I realized how young he actually was. At the beginning - as I said to him - I really thought that he might be 18, but even that felt too young in my opinion to be doing what he was doing. I wanted to lay a trap for him and use some very tempting bait so that I could uncover the truth and talk him into at least trying a better way.
I cannot begin to explain to you how happy I am to be done with this book tour. With all book tours actually, unless I write another book in the future. I am glad to have done it, I'm glad I got my story out there, I enjoyed most of my experiences meeting fans and doing interviews and signings. I'm just ready for it to be over so I can live my life without the constant weight of "Have you finished the next one? Have you finished the edits? Have you selected the cover art? What's the next title? Who's this one dedicated to?" Just knowing that the next time we travel it WILL be for pleasure!
So, I woke up this morning bright and early. Or dark and early technically. I knew we had a huge day ahead of us, I needed to get Siri and Zwei's birthday breakfasts ready, we were planning on having our big talk, and as soon as I'm done writing this email, I am taking off to bring the mischief twins for their Birthday Rafting Adventure!
Unless you made us plans for today, I am thinking we should head into the muggle world and do our shopping. We need at least one nice set of formal wear for the upcoming wedding. We don't need to get Viona anything special because she has so many dresses, but I am going to anyway. I'm the MumDad and I say she gets a fancy new dress! And we can probably wander around some baby stores and see if anything for Dudley and Donna's nursery jump out at as, provided you can remember what she told you as far as themes go! And then if we don't run out of energy we can go talk to the tailor to see about sending in some of our clothes to add the extension charms on them.
"How do I do that?" She asked with a look of disbelief.
The entire room was silent in shock. None of us could believe our eyes when Blaise sprouted wings, growled possessively, and then disappeared into thin air with her.
Harry
I'm gonna love you forever,
When the Circle of Life came on first thing, his eyes lit up in recognition. His lips twisted in an amused smirk and I swear I heard him whisper to Ron that you haven't lived until you've heard the song sung IN the actual Savannah, haha!
But the whole morning and early afternoon went on like that. I stepped in horse shite twice. Venus was NOT in the mood to cuddle me when I decided to try to relax with a cup of coffee in the sun room (not that I blame her, I am not particularly good company right now). But don't worry, even without my cat weaving in and out through my legs I still managed to splatter coffee down my front. Don't worry, it was definitely scalding hot and burnt like hell.
He's just too much sometimes!
"Hazel, but Rowe is well aware that you and Harry tend to bring more than one child to each appointment, and so, I'm sure that Harry is planning to bring Zaire and possibly Jaz."
Hopefully you get home from class quickly tomorrow, I will try to keep Jaz from freaking out as long as I can. I feel like the biggest shite father in the world. I was so focused on my worries, on Hazel's recuperation, at Eris' stress from dealing with her best friend's recuperation, that I completely missed just how upset our sweet Jaz was by your absence. She seems to be that sweet go-with-the-flow child, never truly freaking out about anything. And sometimes I forget that she hides behind that sweetness when she's worried. When you got home earlier, she looked at you like someone dying of thirst seeing a glass of water.
And that's when it finally clicked for him. "Wait. He had shagged us Tuesday morning and knew he was headed home for more shagging Tuesday evening. He has two men who can cover pretty much every sexual want he has. I've even told him I don't think I could go to full beatings but that I would love to dominate him occasionally. But he was still turned on and enticed by Hermione. He was having a rough time the day he got the massage and there was a woman massaging him that reminded him of a female you."
Love you,
Earlier when I came home, it was to a giant cuddle puddle. We watched happy movies that made us all laugh, and then we put the younger ones to bed so that I could talk to all our older ones (even Jules and Romeo) and tell them everything that happened over the last few weeks - to a certain extent. Even though Elena and Viona are well aware of the things Kisa does, I couldn't say some things for plausible deniability reasons.
Her eyes got impossibly wider and even more crazed than they already were. Maybe she's Blaise's mate because she's part veela as well, because I swear she started shrieking at me in a tone that could not have been human. "Harry! I am used to getting everything I want. I go through who I want to go through. And I take any prisoner I damn well please. And now I am stuck on some man who's already in love with two other people!"
And Heidi and Bailey have decided that Martin is the dreamiest boy they've ever laid their eyes on. Ten is much too young for crushes right? Right? I think we need to keep Elena hanging around Kisa, I want her to think people staring at her makes them cretins for a long time!
Otherwise I'll murder them myself!
Love you,
Love and kisses!
He gulped without meaning to. "Yes dear," he assured her, looking paler than usual.
I'm really proud of you sweetheart, you didn't so much as make a face even though you were woken early and then covered in syrupy kisses. Some even got in your hair and you didn't so much as scowl.
She looked confused. "Why do you care?"
Hell of a pitcher though.
I imagine when he does head off to Hogwarts that he will then start counting down for when Jaz will join them.
Draco's email is still first, and I have decided to keep it that way until the posts catch up with where we currently are. It'll probably be about a week or so ^_^
I mean, if it were a matter of this baby being mine and either coming with us or being with either of two criminals, then the answer is easy, he comes with us. But, if we could fix it so that his biology is in line with his true parentage AND he can get adopted by a wonderful loving family that DOESN'T already have … damnit I'm too tired, how many kids do we have again?!? Kidding of course. A family that doesn't already have five children. It's five right? What do we do?
Fine! You caught me. I shrieked and spun in circles looking for an intruder. I'm glad it didn't upset Caelum, he just looked at me like I'd lost the plot. A soft set of giggles, "I'm not here to hurt ya, I'm here in the portrait Luv." Well now I just felt ridiculous. I managed to find who was speaking, a pretty redhead in a painting of wildflowers. Wait, a redhead in a Malfoy painting? What was going on?
Love,
The pain of it probably wouldn't have phased me at all had I been expecting or even asking for it, but since it was unexpected and not in my control in the slightest, it wore me down surprisingly quickly, making me press my lips together as I continued my deep breathing. My hands were pressed to this bloody gigantic bump, and I think I may have curled just a bit to try to pressure her into settling down.
As I settled myself into a sturdy chair with nice arm supports as if I were a King sitting on my throne, I grinned at you. That's when a couple came over to ask if you had ever been figged before. Well, my memory was a bit fuzzy at that moment because I was nearly shagged out, but I couldn't recall. So, I thought, what the hell, why not? It's only 3AM and we've got a few more hours to kill.
Side note, we have to do that! I can lay on the bed and you can lay on top of me (facing away), and someone can shag the bloody fuck out of you. I can be like a breathing bed for - OH! We could do it in a club! That way, we could be watched too!
Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side, Cherish the joy, you keep bringing it into my life, Cherish your strength, you got the power to make me feel good,
But my students were staring at me curiously. "Did ya somehow manage to have a baby since we last saw ya, guv?"
But Love, you have to try and look at this logically. Have you ever felt you had a lesser bond with Elena versus Eris? A lesser bond with Viona versus Zwei? You didn't meet Elena until she was eight, almost nine, and we didn't adopt her for months after meeting her. Do you think our bond with her is in some way "less?" Of course you don't. Is there a selfish part of me that wishes we had always had each of our children from the moment they were born? Yes, because I hate knowing there's a part of their life I'm not a part of. But I wouldn't take away Lainie's years with her parents. I'd not take away River's few short years with his mum. I *would* take away Zaire's years with his biological father, but that's more because of the monstrous behavior than anything to do with not bonding with him.
Draco
P.P.S. I have a full Jareth costume for you! Or I suppose it's really for me, but who's keeping track?
Kisa and Elena were also at the first party, but both had plans to leave before the second party. Kisa - I suppose - technically had a right to be at the second party because it was literally FOR three of her lovers, but she (like us) didn't really feel comfortable playing at a party that involved us and most of the guests were people she didn't really know except as our friends. Obviously, the same reasons apply to Elena but probably even more so, hahaha.
Breathe Harry, breathe.
Yeah, I think squatter is our best descriptor. I’m also partial to his own label of “freeloader.” He may be a squatting freeloader but at least he’s aware of his shortcomings?
Ya loon.
Warning: Drama and angst ahead.
I have to be a bit quick. My lawyers are giving me access to one of their laptops (apparently they've all discovered how useful these can be for storing and quickly accessing a vast amount of information and are easier to carry than a massive pile of files (even shrunk down in a pouch, haha), and so, have bought up a bunch of them for the entire firm. Good to know that this part of my hybrid tech business is catching on!
However, THAT was a strange conversation between the two of us, when I mentioned that you'd slipped a secret message into my email telling me not to go to the Aurors or Unspeakables, and also kept hinting that I should stay out of the Ministry. Hermione gave me a funny look like she'd just figured something out, and that was about the time she decided to call them off, so maybe she understood that you wouldn't be asking us to back off so much unless you had a really good reason for it.
"I put that advert in the Prophet you asked for," Pippa informed me. "It actually ran yesterday and will continue until Friday."
Okay, I have become Rambling Harry again haven't I?
In 1980, a young witch named Moira Lakeland went missing. She was nine years old at the time. The description matched Penni, a pretty honey-toned brunette, with hazel eyes. Now, her father was a muggle born and was killed during the first wizarding war. So again, I almost skipped over her case, because with a dead father, who would be the creepy guy forcing her to be Louise? Also, her name wasn't Louise.
I think I broke Draco...
I love that you're already training Viona. She's amazing. She claps her hands for Muffy to clean her booty?!? That is so adorable!
Sorry, rambling! I think I'm unconsciously doing that thing you do when you don't want to talk about something directly.
It wasn't my first intention to set them up, but I will admit that I wondered if it might happen. Even I didn't expect it so quickly! But then again, it seems that both of them are quick when it comes to matters of love, as evidenced by Romeo kissing his first crush rather than try talking to him. And also, Elena has reported that Jules is very popular at her school, which is not surprising since the performing arts often attracts people who are different or at least open to different sexualities.
Feeling in fabulous spirits, I decided that I simply had to pop in and hopefully catch you at your desk for a few minutes. Instead, I had to catch you at the Park and kiss you so thoroughly that you were too dizzy with happiness to protest me Apparating us straight to your office and giving Tabitha a bit of a show since neither of us noticed or cared that she was there.
THANK MERLIN she's a Japanese Witch! I hadn't known she was a witch and she probably wasn't planning on telling us, but then... hahaha! She's now utterly DYING to meet you, Harry my love, and also has a bit of love for our fit as hell Quidditch star husband.
Saturday June 17th
Surprisingly enough, after quite a bit of shagging from our Anniversary trip and my birthday celebration, I was tired enough tonight to fall asleep in your arms with *no* shagging. At least, not yet. It's currently 2AM (more or less) and I've just fed the babies. You are looking as irresistible as ever in your sleep, and so, I'm going to molest you. I'm going to see if I can do it so stealthily that you only wake up just before you're about to fill my mouth, hahaha.
I shifted my head just enough to comply, and my inherent and well practiced Legilimency skills kicked in and slipped me into his mind, which he had prepared for by having his Mind Stables ready for me to enter. Happy and encouraged, he took me by the hand and kissed me, which is interesting in that it feels nearly as good as the real thing.
Harry
My Own,
I'm not the only one concerned about my students though. Robards has taken steps to ensure that they're all being monitored by security spells when not on duty, and paired up with senior Aurors when on duty. So, for now, we have to believe that everyone is safe.
But then you entered the room and the entire world vanished. There was nothing but you. I held you tight and kissed you so passionately that we had to be literally torn apart by the Aurors before either of us heard a word anyone else said. Such as: "Mr. Malfoy, please stop kissing your husband so that we can proceed."
"I want a sister!" Siri countered. "Like Jazzie, because little brothers can be SO ANNOYING!"
Or, I suppose I won't back all the way up quite yet. I am sure you both are interested to know all the criminals responsible for the last few weeks of fear have been caught and are now in custody. Auror custody. Aurors that are well aware they were infiltrated and fooled from within. Aurors who are royally furious about that fact and are providing round the clock vigilant custody. The fuckers responsible aren't going anywhere!
Honestly, am I the only person who's seeing how absolutely horrifying it is to denote sensuality and over the top flirtation as the main personality traits of a VICTIM OF THE SEXUAL SLAVE TRADE? "She can't stop herself from flirting with them"?!? That came out of Hermione Granger's mouth? Then we should teach her to stop it. Of course she's a "natural" flirt, she had to be to avoid beatings if she didn't catch enough Johns that day.
"Do you actually want to know, or are you just asking because it seems like the thing to do?" Robards questioned in mild amusement.
Ahh, I'm getting off track. I have to put into perspective that everything and everyone is fine. They're all fine. No one is hurt, everyone we love is safe and accounted for. But it was a scary few hours that could have ended sadly or even tragically.
I shrugged and sort of leaned back in my chair a little. "I actually practice it all the time without really realizing it. I mean yes, I respect privacy, and so, don't constantly read my husband and kids' minds, but pretty much every time I step out of the house, if I meet a person's eyes, I take a look around to make sure they're not some sort of potential threat to me or my family."
Harry
"However, I promise you that you will not have three full term babies in there. While the situation is unusual, it is not unprecedented. Your conception with Lily and Caelum was actually very similar, the placentas just happened to grow at almost the exact same time, so their progress was equal. We will not let any of them go past the thirty-six week mark, with the exception of Baby C, if they want stay in there longer after the births of A and B. Best case scenario, we will take A at thirty-six weeks when B and C are thirty-three and thirty-one weeks. After that we can either take B at their thirty-six week mark, leaving C in for two more weeks, or we can wait and take them both when C is at thirty-six. All of this is best case scenario depending on your health."
"Erm..." he droned in confusion.
Anyway, we set them in their area and I pulled you into my arms so we could snuggle as we tried to get comfortable in our new bed. It really was time to get a new bed as our old one had been expanded so many times that I think most of the cushioning had been spread a bit too thin. Plus, it really seems like Zaire and Jaz have decided to permanently room with Zwei, and so...
Since her dress code for the wedding was beachwear or whatever made you comfortable, I myself was extremely happy to go completely naked. Some of our kids were naked. Others were wearing swim cozzies. Hazel was topless with a long and flowing skirt. Viona wore a stylish blue mini dress that almost looked like she could be conducting a business meeting... in a grand ballroom. Oliver wore khaki shorts and a Hawaiian shirt. Sebastian looked like he was attending a rainy and depressing funeral.
And the silence surrounding us became a shouted, "Shite! Fuck! Hell's bells. I'm so sorry mates. I can't believe I just walked in on the two of you. I know better than to just walk into your room, but this is the play room. I thought play room meant like gobstones, or exploding snap and a chess board, maybe some muggle darts, not this kind of play. I'll just get out of your way; again, so sorry. I'll not come in here again without knocking. Or ever, sorry I mean I won't ever come into your sex room."
All of my love,
I guess we will go shopping tomorrow for an ant farm. "Cool" I am "so excited." But Dragon, I really thought you knew me better than that. You decided to hold my shaft hostage until I gave in to your demands? Do you know anything about me? I was going to let you hold it hostage as long as you wanted to! You ridiculous man of mine.
"Exactly! It's *cute,*" she sneered in disgust. "Whereas Delia is sexy! And actually, Cordelia is sort of old fashioned and dignified, so I wouldn't mind that either, but Cordy makes me sound like boy - like GORDY!"
I'm so glad he skipped over his pride and reached out to us for help. I didn't actually sleep much that night because I was assuming he would want to come talk. That's why I ended up taking that nap yesterday. Oh, did you not realize I took a nap? It's probably because I ended up curling up in a ball in the stables. I woke up covered in hay.
"What about raids? Do you think you'll ever want to go on a raid?"
I suppose even if I miss the museum, it will have been worth it to come back home early this morning. I can't believe Siri and Zwei assumed this weekend trip meant they wouldn't be getting their birthday breakfasts in bed! Absolutely ridiculous children. As if I'd miss their fourteenth and thirteenth birthdays! I only missed River's this past year because he has a wife and lives on the other side of the planet. I know Maha cares for me, but I get the feeling her father in law popping into their kitchen at the crack of dawn to bring her husband pancakes and sing the Happy Birthday song may have been a bit much for her patience.
Wednesday October 3rd,
Probably unsurprising to you, that made me cry as well.
Draco, I want to apologize for essentially throwing you under the bus. I know you were worried about Ollie not wanting us now that he didn't need us and instead of talking to you face to face, I decided to email you about it. Which I get has always been our dynamic, that way you can process things emotionally before we talk about them in person. But with no warning, I essentially outed you to Oliver and placed you in an emotionally charged situation. I am very very very proud of you for not freaking out. Instead, you dealt with it maturely and lovingly. Much more mature than I did by running away, literally, from my feelings.
Come find me and take advantage of me if you're in the mood! Preferably before I challenge Lucius to another "I can take WAY more cock than you can" contest!
Anyway, I am going to head to sleep, but I figured I would get all of this out and warn you before you climb into bed and are wondering why our son is sleeping snuggled up to a caboose.
I had a bit of a respite in dance class as I was able to lose myself in the dance, which kept my mind off everything else. But then I popped back to the Manor (had Muffy Apparate me) to change for my combat class. Once back in the closet, I honestly COULD NOT remember what I was planning to do. I mean I could infer based on the fact that I was in my closet, that I was planning to change clothes.
Age 14
Without giving Oliver a chance to object, I Apparated him straight home, trusting that you'd either come with us, or say goodbye and follow within a minute. Once home, I pulled Oliver into my arms and kissed his temple.
"Well yeah, unless you've gone in and organized things a bit, your mind will probably be disorganized and chaotic. It's like... you know how when you're listening to someone talk, no matter how close you are paying attention, you have thoughts pop up. So now imagine that the conversation is the setting - like a sitting room - and all of those thoughts are like our kids popping in and out to ask questions or demand five seconds of attention before running off again. You can see how that might seem messy to a visitor who normally likes to keep a nice and tidy house."
Friday July 28th
At that point, I gave into the urge to nearly abandon my thrusting so that I could kiss the both of you for a few minutes. Thus, when Oliver turned his head to the side so that his mouth was free to yell at me, I couldn't help but be amused.
It only took me a moment to realize that Ron hadn't moved, his cock just sitting there next to our faces. I looked up at him and realized this was the moment I wasn't sure about. Until you commanded in my ear, "Go on baby, suck him, I know you want to. I think you've always wanted to at least a little. He tastes so good. You'll suck him for me won't you?" Well nothing was going to stop me at that point. For my master I could do anything. I took him all the way in. He did taste good. Just a little different, but he'd been in your mouth long enough that there was just enough familiarity to it. Gods, I was sucking one of my best friends while my husband was sunk balls deep into my other best friend.
"How much?" She asked shrewdly.
I’ve actually been spending quite a bit of time with Oberon lately. I know he really enjoys spending time with you Draco, you have a way with him. You’re able to give him a safe way and a safe space to express his anger, frustration, and betrayal at his situation. And Merlin knows he needs that outlet.
Love,
Sunday at 12:26 AM
“Anime,” Harry corrected automatically before crowing in triumph that he'd won the war.
-	Age 17
Both Mahafsoun and I chuckled at that. I was holding onto her and leaning my head against hers as she rested hers on my chest. One or both of us was purring like a cat and I was tempted to brush her the first moment we could get away for a bit of a chat.
I bet the TortureGarden thing is why you feel as though you're forgetting something that Pippa isn't here to remind you of. Since in your mind it was supposed to be this weekend and now we aren't going. The timing worked out well for the plans, but it's also good since you're so focused on the abduction case. Can you imagine trying to have fun in such an extreme kink party while the case research just sits in the back of your mind?
BAH! Just SAYING that is hard as fuck!
At the same time, Ginny was ordering me to unlace and remove her right boot and give her a bit of a foot massage before putting her boot back on and lacing it back up again. That was actually hotter than I thought it'd be. However, as you saw and smirked at, Ginny doesn't have the experience or talent for domination that Luna has, and so, I was a rather naughty sub, disobeying orders by doing extra things like licking her thigh teasingly and pinching her when she looked over to see what Luna was doing.
. Touch. What's. Mine!" We all looked over to find you standing next to the table and surrounded by a literal halo of fire. Your hair was whipping around wildly in a nonexistent wind. You looked glorious! I *think* the lights in the mall were flickering and the background music got static-y. The look on your face promised to murder them all in hot blood and then feed their entrails to hellhounds while licking their blood off your hands. They let me go and held their hands up while slowly backing away.
Saturday September 15, 2018
My other half,
As we were standing up to head out, Ollie managed to find us. We got one of those giant beautiful Ollie smiles, his brown eyes sparkling, "Oi you two fit blokes! It's party time!"
"Ooo, I like that," Luna purred.
After our bath, we obviously came to bed - allowing Elena to do as she liked in her room until her bedtime. She probably danced or practiced her guitar. I was a bit too tired to do anything before we all fell asleep, but now that I'm done with this feeding and it's right about midnight, I think I'm going to lick you some more and see if that spot on your neck was washed thoroughly enough to remove all traces of jam.
Friday October 13th
Good morning my love,
The flight yesterday wasn't too bad. I know we're accomplished travelers, but I always get a bit worried that things are going to go poorly for some reason. But as with any time we fly west I always laugh when we've gone back in time a bit. Twelve hour flight and it's only four hours later? That's some real magical stuff!
This morning? Sunrise at 6:45 A.M. in a completely glass building? Not quite as romantic. I don't even know what I thought initially, wow who turned on the lights I think, but upon fully opening my eyes I was actually a little afraid I'd been blinded. Somebody turn off the damn sun! I felt like those two obnoxious neighbors in that Christmas movie, Christmas Vacation I think? Stumbling around crashing into things because the light was blinding. Knocking over glasses of champagne. If there had been a set of stairs I would have fallen down them.
I feel very bad for Auror Bletchly. As the lead Auror on this particular part of the case, he was required to be in the room with the Warden and the Dementors so that he could actually 'hear' the answers and verify that the Warden wasn't omitting or changing anything. I wouldn't have traded places with him for anything short of personally solving/avenging your murder (or that of any of our children). I think I'm going to buy him something very nice to apologize for putting him in that situation. Perhaps a bottle of Dragon Barrel Brandy.
"Keep on practicing when you can until next Wednesday, but please keep in mind that if you do it too much, you can actually harm Herbert," I advised.
"I know," I murmured, still stroking his hair.
After I finished singing, and you quietly listened to the whole song even though you were impatient to get to the kisses, you pulled me into bed on top of you and gave me a demanding kiss.
Deviously yours,
Phoebe Rayne Wood – Nicknames by Harry: Phoebs (Feebs)
Yes, I drank all the coffees! If you wanted me to share more than just the one mug, you probably should have labeled them all for other people. Otherwise I will assume all generous coffee flavored gifts brought into the room by my husband are for me. Although you are also Ollie's husband, so I probably should have assumed at least one of them was his. But as you mentioned, not a concern since they all ended up with their own mugs of coffee.
Beatrix was feeling off and we thought she should go get checked out. She thought it was possible that she was just having Braxton Hicks contractions and would get sent right back home. Nope, full fledged labor. I stayed a bit into the evening with her, but despite the fact that I have actually been through a pregnancy, the thirteen year old girl wanted a woman with her. I don't blame her. I was there for Hermione's labor, I'm perfectly happy avoiding that again!
Hurry home to me,
Elena: "Hush! I can't confirm that here! There are probably ears in the walls... And besides, don't act so shocked, you Insta-owl me all the time details of new conquests."
My everything,
My favorite part of today was when we returned to the hotel - after our fabulous dinner - when we had two whole hours (plus a few minutes) of luxury in the Aqlla spa. We were bathed in steam, soaked in a Jacuzzi - sipping on champagne - pampered with body scrubs and face masks, and then massaged until even you calmed down, my excitable little mutt.
They were still laughing as they walked into the potions classroom.
Harry’s response to this comment was a look of hurt and “Hey!! Rude!!” and a whispered “true but still rude.”
“You heard!” and he walked out the door.
It was Ron who replied, “Does anyone ever look forward to potions?” this gained him an elbow to his side from Hermione. Which made Draco chuckle, they really were a cute couple.
“You heard!” and he walked out the door.
“it’s a good thing your pretty” she stroked his hair.
Draco ignored all this and walked straight to the eighth year’s bedroom, which was slightly large for only one person. None of the Slytherins had come back. He unpacked his things and sat on his bed, it was going to be a long night till lessons tomorrow.
One possible reason why this was his problem was that he wasn’t sure if they were in the hall yet, he hadn’t checked yet.
After a couple of minutes they pulled away from each other. They stood there both breathing deeply and looking into the others eyes, both with big grins.
When the castle eventually came into view it looked the same as it always had, they must have decided to build it exactly the same as it had been before, the turrets rising into the twilight sky and castle windows all lit up with a yellow glow from the candles inside. It was the same old Hogwarts as it had always been. If Draco looked close enough he could see the boats the first years were on slowly moving towards the castle.
“So what’s with all the fire whisky?”
____________________
and that it is so short
As no one would want to sit with him Draco decided to walk, it wasn’t far to the castle and it wasn’t too cold.
For a short moment he stood still staring at Ginny not sure what to do, everyone was looking at him, this wasn't how this argument was to go. Then he made his choice, it was now or never. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath and started to walk towards Draco.
There was no point lying to Ginny, she knew him better than most people. So he told her about what Malfoy and him had been doing throughout the day, he even added the part about him possibly liking Malfoy, it was Ginny, she’d have guessed eventually.
“That’s so cute!!” she grinned at him, then got a devious look on her face, “we should have a massive break up!! Full on argument in the entrance! Just imagine it” her eyes glinted with mischief.
Ron burst out laughing while Draco blushed.
“Your welcome, can I ask what you were dreaming about?”
“Shush, now why have you been lessons today?”
“I don’t know. I was supposed to go to the common room to be by myself for a bit. Then I found myself in the dungeons, then I saw you and I realised I didn’t want to be myself. That’s why I asked to you to follow me. Then I just kept walking and walking. I’m sorry for causing you trouble I just can’t be alone.” His eyes started to fill up, he could have exploded there and then and spouted all of his problems to the other boy, the boy he had hated for so many years, the boy who stood in front of him now, no longer with hatred in his eyes but worry. Draco Malfoy was worried about Harry Potter.
"LIKE YOU WOULD LISTEN YOUR TOO BUSY WITH QUIDDITCH TO CARE, I CAN NEVER FIND YOU!"
After keeping his eyes closed for a few minutes he opened them again, blinked, then blinked again. Then it hit him, why where the bed sheets red?
He turned his head to the nightstand and saw that someone had left a glass of water and a note, he smiled, he knew exactly who it was from.
Harry nearly fell off the sofa at this, where had she got that idea from?
When it was time for the lesson to end, neither of them wanted to let go of the other, but they were never go admit this, so they reluctantly let go. They walked out of the classroom together and came face to face with Hermione and Ron.
“You remember? I wasn’t sure you would so I chose here.”
Once at the door he looked in and saw Potter,
Once they reached the main part of Hogsmead, Ron and Hermione went towards Madam Pudiffoots for a bit of ‘coupley time’ as Ginny called it. Ginny herself went to join her classmates at the The Three Broomsticks. This left Draco and Harry alone with a difficult decision….
They stayed like that for the rest of the day, eating sweats and swapping stories and kisses in equal measure. Ron and Hermione eventually joined them, bringing with them drinks and cake.
The stranger laughed, “just you friendly neighbourhood umbrella man, but you can call me Harry.”
Draco quickly looked away, “it’s just a recurring dream I have, im in Malfoy manor and im walking down a corridor I don’t know, then someone shouts av…ava…the killing curse then I wake up.”
When the door had shoot Draco just smiled towards “Yeah I did, and I wish you had” he took a bite out of his breakfast and gave a small sigh “it’s not like I haven’t liked you since we met”.
“Hi Potter.”
Harry tried to give her evils but ended up laughing. Turning to Draco he hauled him up off the seat and carried/dragged him to the nearest courtyard.
Harry face fell a bit, “I went searching for you on the train, wanted to offer the olive branch, clean slate and all that. I found you asleep, you looked scared but I didn’t want to startle you, I left them in front of you for when you woke up.”
Potter had swiftly turned away and walked down the corridor. Leaving a bemused Draco on his own.
"I'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT ME! IF YOU HAD PROBLEMS WITH ME WHY NOT TELL ME AND NOT EVERYONE THAT WILL LISTEN!"
something was happening between him a Draco, something had to change.
Harry’s smile grew, where the Harry from last night, this person was all smiles, no hint at what Malfoy had seen. He decided to push this to the back of his mind and focus on the present, if Harry wanted to talk about it he would.
“But you’ll get soaked through I can always buy another one.”
The Sorting Hat said its poem, a poem of remembrance for those who fought in the war, how all houses were now united and how everyone need to support each other and get rid of old prejudices and feuds. There was a mixture of clapping and tears when it finished.
“Why thank you” Ginny gave a nod of the head as a bow.
The sentence was going round and round his brain. Why had she argued that? Why drag Draco into it?
So the day of the break-up had arrived. Ron, Hermione and Luna were all in on it as they all knew that Harry and Ginny hadn't been Harry and Ginny for a long time. To make the break-up seem more realistic Harry and Ginny had been dropping slight hints to people about how 'annoying' the other one was being to anyone that would listen. Harry had a very strange moment with Dean when Dean started to list off all the things Ginny used to annoy him with and all Harry could do was stand there and listen and nod when appropriate.
“You look like you need this mate.” Ron was holding out a whisky glass with the bottle in the other. “Ginny says she stole it but it was never really hidden.”
When they eventually made it to the Great Hall, looking a bit red in the face and messy haired. This was usual for Harry but Draco, not so much.
“That is the end game yes”.
Harry stared at him with confusion, what on earth could Malfoy mean? A variety of scenarios then whizzed through Harry’s mind, the one that he liked most was the one of Malfoy grabbing him and kissing him. Blushing at this thought he just nodded at Malfoy.
Harry got off the bed and pulled him into a hug and held him tight, his heart was beating fast, and not from what had happened with Draco though that had caused it to beat incredibly fast, but from what felt like relief. He knew Ron would accept him and be happy for him but there had still been a small bit of worry, which he could only assume was natural, but to hear Ron say that he was his brother and that he accepted him no matter what, that had caused him to have a sudden rush of emotions, “I love you so much Ron”.
Uni has been an absolute ball-ache but is finished for the summer so hopefully more chapter updates!!
They got some funny looks when Draco walked to the Gryffindor table,
“Starving!” Harry lead the way through the big doors and walked to where Hermione and Ron where sat.
“Isn’t it dinner time now? Want to go to the great hall?”
Draco looked at Harry, who looked at him back, answering for the both of them replied “sure why not I could do with a drink”.
“Why do Granger and Weasley keep looking over at us?”
Second year “did you know he’s the heir of Slytherin”
“I was wondering when you’d finally call.”
“What’s going on?”
Draco POV
He felt Potter shake his head against him.
Harry winked at him, “I’ll just share Draco’s.”
“Probably? You’re not sure?”
The first years were sorted into their houses all welcomed with open arms and the Headmistress McGonagall got up and did her final speech encouraging everyone to do their best etc etc, Draco just wanted to get to bed.
“Want to stay here hugging?” he wasn’t going to push the other to boy to answer, he’d talk when he wanted to.
“YOU KNEW?!?! YOU KNEW I WASN’T IN TROUBLE!”
“Shut up Malfoy, yes or no?”
The response he got was a wide smile and a “I don’t know but I kind of love.”
They released each other and Draco let his arms drop and wrap around Harry, “spoil sports” he tuned his head and planted a kiss on Harry’s cheek, “your turn for the shower”
He took a sip of water, it had never tasted so good, and opened the note:
Oh for Merlin’s sake! Malfoy had noticed? He was going to kill them!
Harry sent him a knowing smile, “you okay? How much have you drunk?”
“I hope so.” He then handed Draco the umbrella, “keep it everybody needs a trusty umbrella.”
“Where was your significant other?”
They released each other and Draco let his arms drop and wrap around Harry, “spoil sports” he tuned his head and planted a kiss on Harry’s cheek, “your turn for the shower”
They all walked to potions together as a group, which got them some confused looks from people who saw them, Draco Malfoy was walking with Harry Ron and Hermione?
He walked out of the bathroom and saw Harry and Ron hugging, he smiled, he had never had close friends, he’d had what he now called brown nosing followers, but he had never had the kind of friendship the golden trio where famous for having, and now he was part of it, they had made him feel welcomed and loved.
I did think if any of the children were going to steal this animal it would have been Atreyu, my little Dr Doolittle. My animal whisperer. A random squirrel told him to come see the new chinchilla? I mean, from any other child I'd probably assume some very strong imagination skills were at work. But from Trey? I believe it.
All of my Love,
Thus, I am officially done with my business meeting here in France! That said, I had time to write this email (while drinking wine with the Minister and Officials) as clerks went over EVERY detail of the agreement with a fine tooth comb to spot loopholes and the like. Now that they are done, I'm going to sign the contract, the Minister is going to sign it, and I'll be free to head off to the best Chocolaterie in France to buy chocolates, flowers, possibly jewelry, and a dozen bottles of the best wine I can find before returning to your side.
Argh,
"And now, did anyone find a pair of golden antlers?" Luna asked.
No, I don't care.
Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger, Minister for Magic
The other thing I wanted to talk with you about was my plan to offer Shayla a different solution. See, it seems as though her concerns are A) having to be pregnant and giving birth during a very busy and stressful seventh year and B) having to adopt out a child, knowing they would be out there for the rest of her life when she feels too young to raise them right away.
November 30, 2003
Yes, it probably looked bad, but I hope you trust that is wasn't as bad as it looked.
No. Bad Harry, no vigilantism!
My Love,
Thursday December 3rd
Assumed Ron’s biologically
This utterly gobsmacked her. She reeled from the shock for a few moments until the vendor snapped for her to hurry up and order something so that he could serve those in line behind us. She mumbled an order that I didn't quite catch, but the vendor did. He nodded and asked me what I wanted.
Sorry, I didn't mean to rail on you. I just think we're still in a place where we can fix this before it becomes a permanent problem. I KNOW that when you try to save the world in your mind you ARE focusing on us. I know that you think catching killers and saving the world is all your desperate need to keep the world safe for your family and to make sure you stay a good person for your family. I may scream and yell that you're being selfish, but I am completely aware that you think you're being selfless and doing it for us.
"Care to dance with me? Maybe sing? BOTH???" I invited.
There were definitely threats.
"Excuse me, Misters Malfoy, Josh Hanson from the Daily Prophet. May I have a moment of your time? Also, you both seem very free with your affection in public. Is there a chance that this might wander into inappropriate territory, and do you mind if I get a few pictures?"
With One Thousand Kisses,
Wednesday September 6th
Draco
But there is ACTUAL good news. I suppose. Rowe noticed during her exam that I'm lactating, and asked me reasonable questions on how it's going, and after I snarled at her for invading my privacy - despite consenting to a full body exam - I admitted that I'm the worst and most pathetic person in the world that I can't seem to figure out something as simple as letting a baby do what a baby intuitively knows how to do. Latch on and drink.
Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy
So, they're not doing great near Hagrid's hut because the magic that would normally keep nonmagical creatures away seems to be bothering them, and he can't find anyone who wants to take on TWO skittish horses and he definitely doesn't want to separate them. And isn't it so lucky that while we have magic and we have intense warding, we don't have anything on our grounds that would keep away non-magical creatures. AND we have a stable! AND we have children who love animals and are super responsible when caring for animals!
You deserved to sleep in, and at this point I think I would be confused if our Christmas "morning" celebrations happened at seven a.m. the way most people's holiday happens. Our family traditions involve a ridiculously yummy breakfast buffet that is pretty much a free for all until mid-afternoon and just spending time together all morning. Staying in our jammies all day. And then our eldest children years ago began my favorite tradition of all; being as loud and obnoxious as possible until Daddy Dragon comes out of his cave.
So, uh, how to distract myself? Oh, I know .... I can't believe you actually made it home in time for dinner last night. This is the last weekend before the big anniversary week festivities begin. I'm surprised Hermione let you go home at all, let alone at a reasonable time. And she didn't send her patronus to come get you until you were already awake? Let me get this straight, Hermione Granger has a massive week's worth of important plans starting two days from now, you were allowed to sleep in yesterday and today, and she let you go home to have a meal with your family? Who is this woman and why didn't she exist during my fifth year?
Harry
I thought to myself, I miss Lucius. Which is weird because of all those times he tried to kill me. Remember that Luci? When you used to try and kill me? And then there was the time I gave you a stinky sock. Bahahahahaha! You should have seen the look on your face Lulu. You were all "grrr" and I was all "ha-ha" and you were all "someday you will shag my son and carry my grandchildren"
I instructed the team to send out about half of the drones to map the area surrounding the crime scene, so that I could keep track off all the innocents that could potentially stumble into our path and inadvertently delay us. Part of the wards that were going to be set up were wards to keep everyone else in their house and not interested in us or what we were doing.
Harry's not feeling so well.
Well, that was certainly a day. I arrived home around twoish. Perhaps even as early as 1:40, and I was so tired that I Apparated straight to our bedroom and crawled in bed to pass out. I *think* Jaz may have been in bed napping when I arrived, I'm not certain as I was too bleary eyed to notice.
All in all, the night was a roaring success. The *only* thing that could have made it better, my love, was if you had come to be by my side and hold my hand as I danced from time to time. But I'm thoroughly exhausted now, so I don't even have the energy to molest you. I promise to make it up to you when I get a chance.
I knew we had to tell our family immediately that a new Malfoy had joined the fray, but I just assumed they would all get to meet him when we got back. And he will meet the extended group when we get back. All the aunts and uncles and cousins and friends that are family. We don't even need to plan anything extra since Viona and Alric are having their engagement party the weekend after we get home.
I don't feel like I'm at one hundred percent, but I definitely feel better than I did a few days ago. I even managed to go without nightmares last night and I didn't even need to take dreamless sleep to do it. I wasn't going to leave you hanging two nights in a row taking care of all the children yourself. A solid night's sleep the night before, multiple mind healing sessions, a relaxing bath, and my gorgeous husband giving me my happy ending all combined to make me one blissed out wizard.
So that's what we're doing. I threw on a gorgeous pair of dragon printed pants but nothing else as we were going to be dancing, so what would be the point? Then we brought the babies, who were apparently also recently fed and happy enough to coo and play, to my parents, who took them joyfully. Sheesh, you'd think they never saw them!

I laughed. "Actually, I was just coming to tell you that I'm going to do it."
Wait, why am I talking about costumes? Are we throwing a party? Because if we do, we can make it a costume party and the theme can be - as risqué as possible - with a prize for the person who manages to come closest to being naked without *actually* being naked. At least at first.
Draco
Oliver kissed me, and for a brief moment, I saw a flash of... sadness? Guilt? Something, but then it vanished to be replaced by love. Actually, the weirdest part about being married to two men I don't quite remember is the kissing. I mean shagging is fun and definitely powerful and loving, but I am capable of doing that without my heart getting involved. Whereas with kissing, I feel like it's something more intimate and special. For example, Oliver kissed me and I had a warning blare in my head that said something like: Don't kiss ANYONE for three months!!! Which left me confused and wondering if I should push him away and tell him that I had to wait a few months before I could kiss him.
Anyway, about a half an hour before class, I had them all stop so that I could demonstrate the first two pain centers on them. I did this by first pointing out the general location on a practice dummy, but since the spot varies a bit based on body size and shape, I then punched them in those spots so that they would KNOW where they were and remember them forever.
You replied almost right away: Do you WANT to do it?

"I watched over him, my heart breaking every day because I wanted him to be loved and safe, but I also couldn't bring myself to get the attention of someone that could report him to child services. What if they found out that he's a..." she faltered, sounding rather emotional.
But I really can't wrap my mind around him being willing to go search for him. You certainly weren't wrong when you told him that you and I would take care of his kids as if they were our own. I already adore them. And Ori seems to have really attached himself to Bel and Tommy. I think even if Viper stayed and they moved to their own place that we would be seeing a lot of them.
Tomorrow is my first interview, I am so nervous.  It's a little girl, 8 years old, in a foster home in Cardiff. What if I say the wrong thing and muck it up? What if her caretakers won't allow her to come? What if she hates me and doesn't want to come? I obviously need to dress muggle, but I don't want to show up looking like a door to door salesman. What do you think? Black trousers and my dark grey jumper? Would that make me look too authoritarian? Maybe I should wear jeans and a colorful shirt? But I don't want to look like someone they couldn't entrust children to. I'm going to lose my mind!
So, to answer your question, Harry, YES! We need to go back to our Island so that I have a physical representation of not doing magic, and also, maybe we should keep Serenity away from me until we figure out a way to fix her allergy.
You looked ever so slightly drunk as Blaise carried you to the cushy massage table and lay you on it so that he had the perfect access to rim you even as you had all the support you needed. I still held your leash, and so, stood by - not only for an excellent view, but so that I could run a hand through your hair and kiss you whenever I wanted. You were soon flushed with passion and looked oh so beautiful.
Draco is a bit overwhelmed.
Thursday July 21st
Anyway, I woke up nice and early this morning, you were in bed sound asleep as was Jaz and Zaire. But as soon as I started wiggling my way out from under the pile of limbs I managed to wake them both. Not you, you sleep like the dead! So off to the kitchens we went to make Elena her birthday breakfast. Pancakes, bacon, eggs, a mountain of fresh fruit, fresh whipped cream, and the absolute yummiest maple syrup to exist that we get from our friends still living in Canada.
"No... and yes... She really likes snogging, and she ALSO likes to take off our shirts, which I really like. It feels so good. Then her hands will wander to places that I'm not entirely comfortable with her touching. When I tell her to stop, she does, but then I spend the rest of the time wondering if she won't like me if I don't let her do whatever she wants."
Happy birthday to me!
I chuckled. "Something I can help you with?"
My Beautiful Husband,
Bracelet pointed up at the large windows near the top of the building. "The sun here is excellent and I sometimes like to garden a bit."
Congratulations my successful husband,
I popped into our loo, thinking I would take a nice relaxing soak with some bubbles. Get myself clean while I had a bit of relaxing bubble bath comfort. No. Your daughter Shtara had brought that damn bear into OUR loo so she could give HIM a bubble bath. Ok, I am going to take that back. I've heard people do that, refer to a child as their spouse's when the child is being naughty. I thought it might be funny, but it just made me feel badly.

Zwei seemed fine once he wrapped himself around me like a little spider monkey, but I think he must have woken up and been confused about where he was. He seemed awfully upset before he realized I was there. It's been quite a while since he's done much climbing in with us. I thought he was just growing out of it. But did you know he actually climbs in with Siri fairly often? So it's not so much that he's grown out of night waking and going for comfort, but that his big brother is his comfort. I am so thrilled they have each other, but also so sad that they don't seem to need us as much.
Draco
Hmmm, now that I am listing all the things I've interfered or blown through structured Auror plans maybe I wasn't escorted for my own safety but to make sure I didn't interfere with the raid. I might be a little offended. But really, that's fair. I have a history of ignoring best raiding practices to power through and get to the criminal. And I won't apologize for having done it before. When people's lives are in danger I don't care what protocol is, I'm going to blast in and get to my family.
Lucky for us, our three babies are pretty well settled and only seem to get up roughly once per night, sometimes not at all in the case of sweet Morgana. Although it's probably not so much that she is being sweet and more to do with really loving her sleep just like her Daddy Draco. Gabe and Dyl are less likely to sleep the whole night through, whether that's because Dylan can't go very long without wanting to eat, or sometimes Gabriel's brain activity shakes him out of a restful sleep, I'm not completely sure.
Looking antsy with excitement, she grabbed me by the hand and started dragging me toward the loo, before stopping abruptly and pointing toward the exit. I nodded in agreement and took the lead. Once outside the club, neither of us broke character.
Note: In Draco's email, he's used to talking directly to Harry - and does so a bit - but then because what he's describing, he's talking to both Harry and Oliver, and so, at times, it does seem to come across awkwardly. Sorry! It's not going to be a regular occurrence, I think, lol.
How dare they call our children names? Mudbloods and foreigners? Adoption makes them not worthy to be Malfoys? Not having blonde hair means they're not really Malfoys? Are you kidding me? I am so proud of Viona, Eris, and Orion for standing their ground and telling those portraits exactly what they thought of them. It sounds like their real criteria for being a "True Malfoy" is being narrow minded, judgmental, and unwilling to look past their exceptionally pointy noses!
After I got out of bed and found something perfect to wear in my closet. I helped River get dressed in a formal yet somehow even more adorable because of it set of dress robes. Then I strapped Ori to your back and Eri to your front. Elena popped in wearing a lovely black summer dress with a white sash and a white ribbon with a big bow around her neck with black shoes. She gave River a kiss on his cheek, and then we made our way as a family to the breakfast room where Mike and Jackie Lewis were waiting with my parents and siblings so that we could eat as a family before leaving.
But those nights where we fall into bed laughing, tickling each other, or teasing each other. Where I call you "Malfoy!" in the same way I did when we were teenaged arseholes, and you call me "Potter!" with the sharp P and a sneer on your face. When we try a new position and our sweaty skin makes us slip and fall, or I get a glance of us in the mirror and the reflection makes it much less sexy than it feels. And I fall more and more in love with you.
My solid foundations,
Harry
I gently pulled up her skirt just enough to see: "Oh wow! Yes, that's a head. Orion? Can you and Ben support Mara so that she can squat and the chair be pushed out of the way. This probably won't take a minute."
Well, back to the grind for me. Pictures to color and swings to push. It's a hard knock life.
-	Assumed Ron’s biologically
He looked away and blushed. "Since Hawaii."
"Yes my lady," I replied clearly in a confident and yet obedient tone of voice.
She actually reminds me so much of Zaire when he was young. Both so hurt by monsters who should have loved them, so hidden within their safe little shells. And then they took these brave steps to leave their safe space to reconnect and be loved. I hope when I grow up I’m half as brave as either of them!
Lastly, I dreamt that I was kissing you and it was so intense that I honestly thought it was real - except that I woke up to find that I was definitely alone and needing you so badly it sort of hurt. Like an ache all over my body. So I went to search for you and drag you back to bed for a few minutes. Thankfully, Viona was playing with Della and my mother was on hand to watch them so that me Apparating right next to you and then bringing you directly to bed - dirty hands, still holding a plant, and all - was not a problem. I'm not even sure if you had enough coherent thought to set the plant aside as I vanished your trousers and plain cotton pants so that I could get at the goods that second.
Draco, he thought we were giving him back. I know I shouldn't have been surprised, you can't fix a lifetime of trauma with a handful of biscuits and one safe night. But he was so hurt by us. Well, we didn't technically need him to come with to fill out the paperwork, so we tried to tell him he could stay and we would go. And that made things worse! "You leave me?" Those sad eyes will be the death of me.
When Tabitha knocked on the door twenty or so minutes later, I ended the spell and let you have your squealing orgasm. Also, try to keep in mind that even though I'm technically on a zero magic restriction, Healer Rowe *did* say that I could cast basic spells if I needed to, and I checked, an orgasm denial spell uses only a tiny bit more magic than a Leviosa, so - as long as I'm not doing it a hundred times a day - I feel that it's safe enough for me to cast.
The storm is over.
I made my way to him and asked him "Hey baby, why aren't you opening yours?" pointing at his untouched pile.
"Are you alright love?" I asked in concern because she looked pale and nearly ready to faint herself.
Since Viona was still clinging to you, I took both of the twins and kissed both girls on the cheek. "Goodnight. You'll be able to talk to Harry in the morning - before I even wake up, most likely."
You know she'd want to see Mandla and Elna! How many African booths will there be? One for each country? Or is it just going to be separated into Northern, Southern, and Central, or some other grouping? I'm so excited! I can't wait!
Love you,
But the answers to everything else were really interesting. The plan is to have him talk about his experiences in the veil with the unspeakables, we have to make sure they don't start dissecting him like a science experiment, but it's such a completely unexpected event that they want to know everything that happened.
In any case, after we BOTH got over our initial awkward embarrassment, he asked all the questions he had and I answered them as honestly as I could. And I'm SO GLAD he asked me, because he had so much stuff wrong! For example, he thought that frotting ONLY referred to rubbing one's fully clothed member against an inanimate object until... ejaculation I suppose. Not sure if he was going to say that because I laughed and corrected him before he could finish his sentence.
Ok, now that I’m done blubbering I can see the screen again and can respond to your email.
You know, on Saturday when you said you wanted me to come and let you rest your head in my lap while you grumbled and growled, I assumed we would eventually start discussing what we have going on. I thought you might cry or need some quiet time, maybe even rant angrily for a bit. I did not expect you to literally lie in my lap while making growling and grumbling noises that only very rarely resembled actual words.
“Yeah he does”
They were still laughing as they walked into the potions classroom.
Where in the name of Merlin was Potter taking him? They’d walked all the way through the dungeon and were now walking through the Entrance Hall. They had passed a couple of other students on their walk, but when no-one was around then Draco would shout out “Potter!” to try and get the chosen ones attention and ask him what was going, it was all very confusing for multiple reasons:
“Yes?”
“In your...”
Harry just continued to gawp at her. She waved her hand in front of him, clicked her fingers, then gave up and just waited for him to emerge from his current state of confusion.
Draco’s mind was racing, he’d just watched Harry and Ginny have a full blown argument which has now resulted in Harry walking towards him.
“I have not the bottle drink!” Draco nodded to emphasise his point, it was meant to be a short nod but when his chin touched his chest he realised he had gone too far, his whole body then followed and the floor was soon coming to meet his face. Before this happened however, two sets of arms were around him and placing him back in his seat.
When Draco opened his eyes it got worse, why was it so bright?
He stopped pacing, turned on the spot and looked towards the reason for his problem. Harry was walking towards with his signature smile on his face, where was Granger and Weasley?
Malfoy just smiled at him, “Me of course.”
The ‘love birds’ as they were going to be referred to in the future came over hands clasped together and sending heart eyes to each other.
He walked into the entrance and all of a sudden saw Ginny storming towards him. She stopped just in front of him and sent him a subtle wink that only he could have spotted and also an apologetic look,
Ron chuckled, “It has hasn’t it.”
They burst into laughter and stayed on the sofa till Hermione and Ron joined them and the spoke about what had happened after Harry and Draco left the party. The jist was everyone got absolutely wasted, couples left early, people hooked up and more than one couple got caught by prefects in broom closests.
“Are you having an ‘affair’ with Malfoy?” she put air quotes around the word affair as they were no longer together.
i am so so sorry this has taken so long!!
“What are we?”
“Bed…..?” he was very confused, why was Ron smiling at him like that?
This entire scenario was ridiculous, he had followed Potter without thinking and now he was thinking about Potter’s arse, what was happening?
“I’ve never been more proud” Ginny said giving her a high five.
“Everything.” He moved his head so it was resting in the crook of Malfoy’s neck, it felt right, he felt like he in the place he was mean to be.
Draco sighed and rested his head against the wall behind him.
He nodded in agreement and rested his head on Harry’s shoulder.
What was he meant to do?
“That’s so cute!!” she grinned at him, then got a devious look on her face, “we should have a massive break up!! Full on argument in the entrance! Just imagine it” her eyes glinted with mischief.
They both groaned in unison, “only making it more real guys.”
“Draco!”
And he was alone. His friends gone. Parents in Azkaban.
“Well I’m partnered with you, so less looking forward to it and more dreading it” he sent Harry his signature smirk.
After getting themselves comfy they sat in silence for a while, so long that Harry thought Malfoy had gone to sleep. Looking over at Draco Harry saw he wasn’t asleep but gazing at him intently, with a look of concern.
“I don’t know. I was supposed to go to the common room to be by myself for a bit. Then I found myself in the dungeons, then I saw you and I realised I didn’t want to be myself. That’s why I asked to you to follow me. Then I just kept walking and walking. I’m sorry for causing you trouble I just can’t be alone.” His eyes started to fill up, he could have exploded there and then and spouted all of his problems to the other boy, the boy he had hated for so many years, the boy who stood in front of him now, no longer with hatred in his eyes but worry. Draco Malfoy was worried about Harry Potter.
“Wooh!!!”
After clearing his throat Harry spoke, talking mostly to the floor than Draco.
They had started to draw quite a crowd, students and some teachers had formed a circle around them, Harry was happy about this till he simultaneously spotted Draco with and eyebrow raised and heard Ginny say…
Before Draco could defend himself, a Malfoy never got drunk, they were always composed and dignified, Ginny walked past “He’s drunk the bottle.”
“We’re officially students, why am I already stressed?”
Harry had to laugh at this remembering the time Draco drank too much fire whisky, “you were so drunk.”
As he stood to leave an arm shot out of the covers and grabbed him and pulled him back down.
They spent the rest of the weekend sitting around the fireplace in the common room, playing various games and talking about nothing in particular. Draco grew to love Ginny and could tell why Harry fell for her, he loved watching Hermione and Ron together, and started to feel bad for how he treated them in the past.
“Should I take him outside?” this was directed at Ginny but Draco answered.
“I have no idea.” He whispered back through gritted teeth.
They looked at each other and smiled, this was going to be so much fun!
When he was walking towards the classroom he heard talking coming towards him and saw that it was Potter and his friends, hoping they hadn’t spotted him he quickly entered the classroom. Once in the classroom Draco found the desk that was right at the back of the classroom as far away from everyone as he could be.
Ron coughed, scratched his head and stated very loudly that he was “going to go get a shower.”
“Want to talk about it?”
Draco turned to Harry, “what in Merlin’s name is going on?”
“What are we?”
Harry’s eyes bugged out of his face,
“But isn’t the great hall full of people?”
He saw Potter, Weasley, female Weasley and Granger get onto train and was about to follow and ask to sit with them, but changed his mind. Why would they want to sit with him? They must despise him.
A laugh bubbled in Harry’s stomach, “pardon?”
He was pacing in front of the entrance to the grand hall. He wasn’t quite sure why though. There were two possible reasons for why he was doing this, one of them was that he was waiting for Potter and his entourage to arrive so they could all go in together, or he was building up courage to go in and sit with them.
“I’m saying yes anyway, I love you Malfoy”
“I’m not sure, but looking back don’t you think it’s been building up for years?”
"I'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT ME! IF YOU HAD PROBLEMS WITH ME WHY NOT TELL ME AND NOT EVERYONE THAT WILL LISTEN!"
“Does he think where..”
Harry was having a dilemma, an adorable and snoring dilemma.
“Shut up Malfoy, yes or no?”
Ron smiled back, “it’s a good thing I love you both or I’d have used a bucket.”
He could have stayed in Malfoys arms forever, but he knew he would have to move at some point. He stood there feeling Malfoy breathing. He was the first to let go and he looked up at the other boy, he could have sworn Malfoy looked disappointed to be no longer holding him.
While at the same time Harry looked scarred, hugged a pillow to himself and whispering “I’ve never been more scarred”
“Ginny, that’s evil”
“Draco’s father would definitely hear about it.”
“yesh!”
“You know I meant nothing by that.”
“How did you find me?”
He sat up straighter, and looked around him. The head movement made his stomach churn. Closing his eyes and holding the bridge of his nose did help, then he took a deep breath and thought back to what happened.
“next to my…”
Draco stared down at his broken umbrella with a look of betrayal. He had just started his last year of university so had popped to the shops for the essentials of coffee and pasta, the healthy diet of a student.
please leave any comments you have!!
The same looked crossed Harry’s face but this time he kept his composure.
What was surprising was that Draco himself didn’t question this, who knew the day would come where he felt more at home in the Gryffindor common room in the arms of Harry Potter.
____________
Draco and Ginny shared a small smile between them, I silent agreement. Draco had to smile to himself as well. A year ago he would never have imagined being friends with Ron, Hermione and Ginny. He definitely never would have imagined he would be dating the famous Harry Potter, even though I small part of him back then had wished it could happen.
Ginny face betrayed her, she was obviously trying to be caring but she burst out laughing instead, “Yesh you should Harry. The air might do him shome good”
“Shworry”.
“Okay. But again, where are we going?”
The next day when Draco went to put the umbrella away he found a piece of paper in the bag with a number on it the words
His peaceful night meant he had overslept which meant he had to check his timetable, his first lesson was transfiguration,
He saw the Golden Trio walk in and it was obvious that Weasley and Granger were finaly together so they sat next to each leaving Potter alone. To the confusion of Draco, Potter decided to sit next to him. Once he had sat down Draco sent him a confused look.
Draco looked at him eyes wide and repeated his previous question but with a lot more volume and followed by Harry raising his eye brows and walking towards Draco’s bed.
“I never said that, I said she was probably at quidditch.”
First year it had been “look its Harry Potter!”
At that moment Draco grabbed his shoulders and moved him so that Harry was stood staring up at him a couple of steps down, the look of confusion fixed to his face.
“Let’s sit on the floor.”
“Where? I thought you were going to find Ginny.”
“So fancy being partners?”
“That’s what you got from that?”
Draco couldn’t think of a retort but Harry must have but he drowned out the friendly bickering, he was taken aback by Ron’s comment, he had said he loved them, both of them, all his past friendships had been built on fear and wanting followers not family, but now he had a family and it made him feel safe and he knew it he got off the bed and gave Ron a hug.
“Wow. But you have Weasley Junior I bet your as bad.”
Draco was usually a very composed person but seeing the chosen one in his bed looking at him expectantly and patting the space next to him. Draco walked slowly towards the bed and sat on the edge tentatively now knowing where to put his hands or his legs. Next thing he knew harry had his hands around his waist and was knelt behind him pulling him into him. Draco put his head back and rested it on his chest, “we can’t do anything you know that? Ron could finish his concert at any moment and walk in on us.”
One possible reason why this was his problem was that he wasn’t sure if they were in the hall yet, he hadn’t checked yet.
“Ashamed, tired, embarrassed, tired…did I say ashamed?” he walked over and sat on Harry’s lap.
Ron just rolled his eyes and went back to eating. Hermione was still looking at her friend concerned, apparently Draco wasn’t the only one concerned about Harry’s mood.
“Draco!”
He must have been lost in his own thoughts as he hadn’t noticed Harry walk over to him, until he was stood right in front of him their noses almost touching. “Come with me?”
___________________
“Have we ever been normal though” she sent him a cheeky smile.
When the lesson was over it was break so while the trio invited him to come with them to wherever they were going, Draco said he needed to go to the library to get a book and promised to see them in Charms, when in actual fact he just needed a break.
Once they reached the main part of Hogsmead, Ron and Hermione went towards Madam Pudiffoots for a bit of ‘coupley time’ as Ginny called it. Ginny herself went to join her classmates at the The Three Broomsticks. This left Draco and Harry alone with a difficult decision….
The week previously had flown by, Harry and Draco had spent as much time as they could together, while also hanging around with Ron, Hermione and Ginny. Draco had also started to notice that more people were saying hello to him on the corridor, when he had brought this up Ron told him that it was just the effect of being friends with Harry. Hermione and Ginny backed him up on this while Harry just blushed.
“So potions, you coming Draco?” Why was Granger being nice to him as well? Didn’t he deserve to be excluded? He sided with Voldemort, he had gotten the dark mark.
Third year had been quieter
“Should I take him outside?” this was directed at Ginny but Draco answered.
Draco must have gone into auto pilot because before he knew it he was almost back at his common room.

Hermione and Ginny backed him up on this while Harry just blushed.
Potter had swiftly turned away and walked down the corridor. Leaving a bemused Draco on his own.
“I have not the bottle drink!” Draco nodded to emphasise his point, it was meant to be a short nod but when his chin touched his chest he realised he had gone too far, his whole body then followed and the floor was soon coming to meet his face. Before this happened however, two sets of arms were around him and placing him back in his seat.
“Your welcome, can I ask what you were dreaming about?”
They stood hugging each other for a few minutes when they were suddenly both enveloped in a wash of mint and soggy arms encapsulated them both, “Why are we hugging and why wasn’t I invited, also this feels like a dream I had one night.”
As he went to walk towards the entrance to it he heard footsteps, slow ones that didn’t seem to have any purpose and were just going. Following the noise Draco found himself in walking towards the potions classroom.
“Would you like to sit with us?”
Draco watched Harry walk away, what had just happened?
Harry found himself being pulled into a hug he felt Malfoys arms tighten around and he let himself e held.
“Traitor” he whispered at it, his perfectly styled hair getting drenched and his shopping back slowly filling with water. He sighed and looked in the direction he needed to walk, it was another ten minutes but it was closer than anywhere else.
“I’m fine, I do have a question for you though?”
“Malfoy!!”
Malfoy burst out laughing, partly at the look on Harry’s face, he looked adorably confused, and how far Harry was from the truth of what was actually happening.
“Urgh” Harry put his hands on his face, “I’m well and truly fucked.”
Draco took this as a chance to get back into bed and o to sleep, Harry really was sweet.
“Thanks, Ron I really do need it.” Draco took the glass, downed it and as Ron was telling him to take it easy he grabbed the bottle.
When they stopped, to their surprise, people started to cheer, and some even handed each other money. Ginny was stood there smiling at them and Harry realised something, she had planned this from the start.
After the war he was back to being just Harry Potter the boy who’d defeated Voldemort, twice!
“Where have you been?” the recognisable voice of Hermione reached his ears.
“Yeah perfectly fine”, he sent them a very fake smile “so potions is it?”
“I know!!”
“Oh really?” Harry raised his eyebrow.
“Well as you told me before I have no one else so how could I say no?”
“There you are!”
“Why are you sitting next me?”
While at the same time Harry looked scarred, hugged a pillow to himself and whispering “I’ve never been more scarred”
“Being me comes with some perks I will be honest. Let’s go in I’m starving.”
The sentence was going round and round his brain. Why had she argued that? Why drag Draco into it?
Draco POV
Draco just stared at him, “It was you?!”
There was a pause before Potter slowly nodded his head. Malfoy chuckled, if his father could see him now.
Dracos response was a loud laugh that erupted from his stomach, surprising him and his two friends. “Sorry Harry.” He took a deep breath then turned to Ginny “I promise to look after him and try to keep him out of trouble” then adding “I hope we can be friends, I’ll need a helper.” For good measure.
Harry chuckled, “yes you did, and I just got straddled by him, so I win.”
“And this is bad?” she tilted her head to emphasise her question.
Is what Draco felt like saying, instead he went for a more subtle answer
Ginny ran over to them, “that went well I think”, her hands were on her hips and she was looking around nodding.
She shook her head, grabbed her book and booped him on the head with it.
“You might have been the chosen one to defeat the dark lord but you weren’t the chosen one when it came to potions.”
It was one of the best weekend Draco had had at Hogwarts.
The rest of the lesson went by silently, McGonagall being the teacher she was no one would dare talk while she was, out of both resect and fear.
He carried on going but harry just watched him, it was the cutest drunk ramble he had seen, Ron’s were usually incoherent except for the word Hermione, he was sure Hermione got more intelligent when she drank who can say discombobulate when drunk? But with Draco he just looked more human, more animated, than the persona he showed, and Harry knew exactly how to shut him up.
When he had left his house he was proud of himself for taking his umbrella as it had rained as soon as he had walked out of door but now walking back his faithful umbrella had turned inside out,
“Trouble? Why would you be in trouble?” Quickly adding, “What have you done?”
“MALFOY!” Now Harry was annoyed. Was he in trouble? Why were they going to go to Madam Malkins? Why wasn’t Malfoy giving him a clue? “Am I in trouble?”
He must have been lost in his thoughts as he didn’t notice Ginny sit next to him. Even though they’d split they still classed each other as one of their close friends.
She laughed, “well it is, isn’t it?”
He saw the Golden Trio walk in and it was obvious that Weasley and Granger were finaly together so they sat next to each leaving Potter alone. To the confusion of Draco, Potter decided to sit next to him. Once he had sat down Draco sent him a confused look.
This gained another “Hey!” from the topic of this interaction and a “we already are friends, I wouldn’t hand him over to someone who wasn’t.”
Draco was still sleeping so he put it on the night stand and left a note with it.
“From?”
The rest of the lesson went by silently, McGonagall being the teacher she was no one would dare talk while she was, out of both resect and fear.
“Am I not allowed to be?”
He then got his phone.
How was this only the first day? So much stuff was happening.
“The magnificent Potter wants to be my partner?”
“What’s going on?” not breaking the eye contact.
She shook her head, grabbed her book and booped him on the head with it.
“You do know that could be classed as stalking?”
He raised an eyebrow, “and that would be?”
They sat there snuggled together for a while, both content, happy and enjoying the silence.
“What are we going to do?” Draco turned his head towards Harry, refusing to let go of his arm.
“Mate, let me put a shirt on first.”
For the rest of the day whenever one of them caught Hermione, or Ron, or both looking at them they would do something coupley, either hold the other ones hand, place their head of the others shoulder or even hug the other one. They were too caught up in their game not to notice their students catching onto the way they were behaving, it was then that the rumours of the Draco and Harry “affair” started to spread.
After getting themselves comfy they sat in silence for a while, so long that Harry thought Malfoy had gone to sleep. Looking over at Draco Harry saw he wasn’t asleep but gazing at him intently, with a look of concern.
“I have no idea what you’re on about” he flourished his arms to accentuate his point making him realise he was holding something in his hand, he squinted to try and focus his eyes but fire whisky was causing everything to seem blurry. He needed answers! Shoving it towards harry “What’s this?! Everything’s blurry, I’m seeing things how I imagine you do without glasses!”
“Just imagine what it’d be like if those two got together.”
“Be honest, did you invite me to sit with you so you wouldn’t have to be a third wheel to those two?”
To say draco was confused was an understatement. All he could think about on his walk back to his common was his conversation with Potter. What had flashed over Potter’s face? Last he had heard Potter and the Weasley girl had been completely smitten and there had been rumours that Potter had proposed. Then why had Potter gone all quiet when Ginny had been mentioned?
It was Ron who replied, “Does anyone ever look forward to potions?” this gained him an elbow to his side from Hermione. Which made Draco chuckle, they really were a cute couple.
Ron looked at him concerned, “morning mate, you seem happy.”
He smiled back “no we haven’t”.
Draco stopped abruptly and turned.
“I’m not sure, but looking back don’t you think it’s been building up for years?”
“Ow!!”
Draco lifted his head enough to say “sorry” then flopped his head down again.
He placed a kiss on Harry’s cheek.
He smiled at Draco, “hope you don’t mind, I saw you struggling and couldn’t let a good looking man like you get soaked could I?”
Harry pulled him into a tight hug, kissing him on the forehead, Draco had a feeling he was trying to kiss the nightmares away.
“I’m sure it’s fine, anyway you’re with me!”
Where in the name of Merlin was Potter taking him? They’d walked all the way through the dungeon and were now walking through the Entrance Hall. They had passed a couple of other students on their walk, but when no-one was around then Draco would shout out “Potter!” to try and get the chosen ones attention and ask him what was going, it was all very confusing for multiple reasons:
When Draco opened his eyes it got worse, why was it so bright?
And he was alone. His friends gone. Parents in Azkaban.
Something flashed across Harrys face but instead of replying he turned to his friends.
Silence followed, only broken by the sound of running water and Ron singing loudly in the shower.
“Hmmph”
He smiled, when had Harry put that in there?
It was going to be a night to remember……..for anyone who wasn’t Draco.
“The first time we met inside Hogwarts was here and you refused to be my friend, this time I hope you’ll give me a more positive answer.” He winked at Harry because he kind of already knew the answer. “The first 7 years we knew each other I was a dick, mostly from a chip on my shoulder because I liked you, but you know all this already”
Second year “did you know he’s the heir of Slytherin”
This entire scenario was ridiculous, he had followed Potter without thinking and now he was thinking about Potter’s arse, what was happening?
Harry woke up the next morning with a sore neck, in the arm chair he had sat down in the night before and a blanket on him. He recognised it as Hermione’s, she always looked after him.
They got some funny looks when Draco walked to the Gryffindor table,
Draco shared there confusion, how was this happening, he’d been back at Hogwarts for one night and already things were changing, it made him feel slightly uncomfortable, he was also being made uncomfortable by the worried looks Potter kept sending him,
“No was waiting for you.”
“urh, um, eh?”
“no…….?”
“And you has that title?”
“From?”
Draco sent him a wide smile, “Just teasing, I was genuinely touched by it, didn’t know who to thank, so thank you.”
“I’ll see you tomorrow Malfoy.” He then turned and walked away, hands shoved in his robe pockets and his shoulders bent.

“But isn’t the great hall full of people?”
He just smiled at her, gave her a peck on the forehead, nodded to Ron who was sprawled on the couch in front on the fire and went up to his room.
and he had lost any inhibitions he had left around the 10
Harry slowly nodded his head and then waited for Malfoy’s response. When Malfoy chuckled Harry felt it move through him and it made all his problems melt away.
“Want to talk about it?”
Harry smiled and stroked the blondes hair,
Malfoy was pacing, Malfoy never paced, but there he was. Pacing.
How had walked to the dungeons without us crossing paths? (He didn’t notice the piece of paper in Harry’s hands.)
“How did you find me?”
“You had breakfast yet?”
Time stopped, Harry didn't know someone so pale could blush as much as Draco was doing now. He could hear his own heart beat speed up, why had she said that? Then he saw her face she was sending him a mischievous smile, almost daring him to do exactly what his heart was telling him to. She really did know him better than anyone.
