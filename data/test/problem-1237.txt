Glowering, eyes glimmering malevolently, Seraphim backed away, following the sound of Draco's boots on the pavement. The gang of gothic teens let them go, laughing and saluting them. Despite the good outcome, Seraphim was a bit shaken. He turned and hurried Draco along, and they practically jogged back to the house.
"Gemino and Flagrante Curses," Severus hissed. "Don't touch anything or we'll be swimming in this stuff."
"A curse scar is a scar created by a magical curse unable to complete its purpose," Remus explained. "The failed or incomplete curse leaves a residue that wishes to finish its job, but doesn't have the power to do so. The curses that injured Shadow in the graveyard were all allowed to do what they were made to do, so there is no magical residue left to resist healing. If Shadow continues with his weekly skin treatments, they should all disappear in about three months."
"Be still," Severus warned, coming forward and placing a hand on Shadow’s chest to enforce the command. "You have been in a coma for about seven hours now. It is almost midnight."
Boy. Those two sets of very horrific experiences shape who he is. He may seem more coherent than either Boy or Demon, but he is not well, Shadow. He is sick and hurt. He doesn't think or feel the way any normal person would. His reality is severely warped. You can't hold him accountable to a morality he doesn't know exists. Dursley almost beat him to death dozens of times for things he didn't understand. He didn't remember what you had done or what happened before hand. All he knew was that a man existed to seemingly beat him and torture him. Right? That's what he thinks people do. This is reinforced by what happened with the Death Eaters. You can't expect him to understand that it's not okay to hurt or kill others."
It was unnecessary. Everyone still standing bolted for the castle, knowing it was their only hope. Remus hesitated. His heart beat quickly. The werewolf in him resonated to the magic spiraling faster, tighter through the air. He suddenly understood. Shadow… Harry… his other cub. Growling, he beat back his wolf and walked toward the Dark source. His pup needed him.
At first, Charlie held himself apart, but soon his whole countenance melted as he lightheartedly debated with his father about the purpose of a Muggle rubber duck. Molly admonished them all to behave and eat their dinners, but she was smiling around the table with bright eyes. Soon, before they knew it, Tonks and Hermione were pulled into the merry conversation, McGonagall began to recall past Christmases with a gently smiling Shacklebolt, and Remus and Sirius began arguing about pranks with the twins.
Charlie sighed and rubbed at his face. "He's going to live, but he's still very hurt. It's going to take some time before he's up and about. Poppy's not sure she can prevent scarring. She said thoughts burn worse than almost anything else."
To this end, Umbridge took a temporary leave of absence from Hogwarts to confer with the new Minister and to guide him. She was, after all, more experienced with the office of Minister than Scrimgeour, who had only recently been appointed Head of MLE. He would need her advice, and she was only too happy to provide it.
"T-Tom was always thinking how great he was. How h-he was invincible and how powerful he was. And he was always thinking about y-you, Harry. He was so mad that he couldn't figure out how you defeated him. He was o-obsessed with it and the idea of finally destroying you to prove that he was truly a Lord of the D-Dark, as he called it."
now!" he cried, voice beginning to tremble and his anger giving way to desperation. "You accused me of not trusting you. Well, what about trusting me? I wouldn't keep something from you for the fun of it, Gin. Obviously this is hard. Obviously what's wrong with me is something bigger than I can deal with, but I do trust you. I trust you, Ginny. So I'm going to tell you something. Something you're going to regret knowing. Something I had wished very hard you would never know about me."
Draco had always seemed to accept him, no matter his flaws. When his mind was fractured into several different personalities, he'd accepted it calmly. After the Adoption Ritual and his whole appearance had shifted, Draco had said,
"Have the scouts also been observing the landscape?" Harry asked, eyes roving over the seven locations presented to him.
Female's screaming pierced his sensitive ears. He snarled and the Black lashed forward, impaling the sick-female through the throat. The sound cut off only to be replaced by the alpha's roar. He spun to face the alpha and stood on his back legs at his full height, making himself bigger. He staggered as the alpha's blow struck his cheek, but his wings snapped out wide for balance and he didn't fall.
In any case, he had advanced past that ignorance. He had continued to learn. Salazar had been studying the makeup of the mind for centuries. And with such knowledgeable eyes, he looked around him now and felt almost like he was finally seeing the advanced mind he had envisioned so long ago.
Shadow began to get the picture and felt himself go cold. Seraphim. He now remembered the burning scar, dropping the compact, and activating his jacket. He turned to look again at the little girl to find her studying him intently. Her gaze settled on his green eye. She looked deep inside it and Shadow felt dizzy all of a sudden, but then she blinked and the strange feeling passed.
"No. He told them they went off on their own, trusting nobody. It's not so unbelievable for Professor Snape to do such a thing." Remus smiled wryly, his eyes darkening to brown once more. "They questioned Draco more vigorously than they did Sirius, actually. It's not so far fetched for Siri to be clueless, but they expected Draco to know what's happening around him. They wanted to know everything they could about Shadow's transformation, his adoption, and any future plans they had made."
"May I ask why you feel missing meals is acceptable?" Severus asked pointedly. He waved his wand and summoned a chair from the sitting room. He settled into it gracefully.
After a few hours of sleep, those with Animagus ability slowly crept toward Malfoy Manor fifteen minutes before the sun was due to rise on Monday, February 22nd. Draco had revealed that the manor wards had a vulnerability. There were two different system of wards; one that activated at night, the other that activated during the day.
Seraphim is nuts. Merging with him would be like a death sentence. You heard Salazar. He can't be fixed! Merging would just strip me of the last bit of sanity I have."
"Okay, everyone. It's almost twelve-thirty. Time to go to bed, but before we go, I want to tell you I've mastered the Animagus transformation." She quickly turned into a mouse and back again. "You have only one chance at it, and it's a very advanced bit of magic, but anyone who wants to give it a try, stay after, and I'll go over the process with you."
The Room formed itself into a small, intimate lounge, producing two couches that were plush and comforting. Ginny grabbed one of the big pillows and hugged it to her stomach protectively. Her eyes were red-rimmed from crying, but there was still a spark of temper as she stared at Shadow challengingly. Neville sat beside her at a slight angle, while the two Slytherins sat across from them.
Shadow crossed his arms, the magical jacket rustling with the gesture. As soon as they had gotten back, Shadow had put it on. He stared at Draco, his face pale and unreadable. "I'm hardly helpless."
He turned and led the two teens further into the Chamber. They passed the basilisk and moved toward the two sofa chairs and the piano, which still sat innocently in the corner a few feet away. Shadow had picked up one of the fallen rocks and now he set it down. Swirling his wand slowly, he stared at it through half-lidded eyes. Slowly the rock morphed into a chair that matched the other two, except this one had stone-colored cushions instead of the green that the other's sported.
"You're not scared of Demon at all?" Shadow asked incredulously. His eyes were narrowed and he reached up to brush his bangs out of his face, unconsciously revealing the pale jagged scar.
Neville and Rodolphus were halfway down the hall by now, the Order members were pressed backward, almost at the front doors. Soon they would be forced outside and Neville would escape with Rodolphus. Draco knew his love would try something desperate, but was terrified it would cost Harry too dearly. To his astonishment, however, the horrific wounds began to heal as Harry screamed, the sound so desperate that Draco instantly realized what had happened.
Severus met his son's eyes and internally winced at the look of fear and desperation in the pale emerald gaze. "I will help you."
The girl blushed, but she stood and took the stool next to Shadow. He smiled at her and began a quiet conversation about secrecy spells and such. Hermione answered enthusiastically, also bringing up a few things she had been thinking about, like how they would communicate with each other without being caught. The others took her cue and began small conversations as they waited.
They balanced each other perfectly. Fred was the driving motivation, the one with the wicked sense of humor; George gave them purpose and creativity. Fred was the one who enjoyed the limelight. He was the flamboyant one and kept George from retreating into himself too much. On the other hand, it was George who tamed his brother's wildness just enough to prevent him from falling into the excesses that he was susceptible too, like drinking or law-breaking. George kept Fred from getting too carried away.
"That is why it is important someone get this into him while the seizure is relatively mild." Severus glared at the werewolf in annoyance. Surely that was self-evident. "However, if he cannot swallow, it will absorb through the oral skin, so at least make sure it stays in his mouth. It will not be as effective administered this way, so use both vials instead of one. Understood?"
"First thing's first." Shadow stood and gestured to the divide that separated the others from the Slytherins despite the tight quarters. "This cannot continue. At least, not while in this group. What House you're in doesn't matter here. Learning to defend yourself and your friends from attack is what's important."
Now he found himself in front of a house that had no vehicles out front and no noise coming from inside. He looked through the windows, his feet in agony. He saw no one; the house was empty. He tried the front door, the back door; they were both locked. Inside it was warm. He knew that, but all he could think of to do was break a window. That would hurt.
"I thought we'd work on dueling and defensive magic first," Shadow began. "Occlumency is easier to learn when your magic is exhausted since you need to learn how to discipline your mind without your magic to truly master the art. Split into pairs and duel. Draco and I will be walking around and taking notes on how far along you are and what you should work on here to best help you."
The Aurors prepared to cast again as the creature roared with rage, a rage that was very familiar to Draco. Draco closed his eyes expecting to be torn in two as he stood in the way between Demon and his prey, but instead white wings surrounded him and he was pulled against a smooth, surprisingly warm chest.
Harry ran his hands through his messy black hair, his eyes bright with mirth behind his glasses. "I thought you would like to be greeted. I would have gone as myself, but that is problematic lately. Besides, we've discovered that I don't tire out as quickly when I move about in my animal form."
wouldn't take the risk of upsetting the damned Ministry of Magic to report the truth, then she would find a paper that would. Tightly clutching her purse that held the long account of Harry Potter, The Boy-Who-Lived, Melissa set out on her mission.
"We'll run free tonight under the full moon," Remus offered the jittery man. Everything was starting to weigh on Sirius and it was showing. If a little freedom would help, Remus thought it was worth the risk.
At first Marissa thought it was more play, but then she quickly grew subdued. "Draco?" she asked, her big brown eyes wide and beseeching.
Shadow grimaced and covered his face. "I thought I could just kill Harry off, leave him buried, and finally live a life of my own. I knew the Order and my old friends would be sad, but… They didn't really know me. They didn't really care. That's what I told myself. That they'd get over it. I told myself that I
would be so naïve as to think it possible to avoid the inevitable confrontation such an action would provoke!"
Shadow gasped and lifted his head. Neville stood in the doorway looking worried and sleepy. Shadow fought to control his breathing, to stop the tears, the trembling, hide the pain and terror and hatred, but he couldn't move, couldn't speak.
Motion to the right drew his eyes and they widened dramatically. Ron and Hermione were pressed into a corner, making out heavily. The redhead's hand was up her shirt and Hermione had both hands buried in his hair. Beyond shocked, Shadow approached cautiously. Their mouths worked furiously and the smacking noises and moans softly filled the air. Shadow grimaced, his stomach churning. He honestly thought he might be sick.
"I am perfectly capable of murdering to protect myself," he said, returning to stare into his own weird eyes. "Dumbledore, for example. I certainly don't mourn for the Dursleys. They tortured me. Enjoyed it, even. I was a child in their care and Vernon whipped me, beat me, cut me, burned my body. I don't remember any of it, but Boy does. Boy lived through Vernon's abuse everyday for ten years.
"Good," Sirius said roughly, sudden tears in his eyes. He hugged the teen tightly. "I don't know what I'd do without you."
"He has a one," Neville assured, guiding her downstairs and toward the kitchen. Tea would help calm her nerves. "I promise. As soon as he can't hear or see us, he'll calm down. He'll be okay." At least, he hoped so. He had no idea what was going on, what had happened. He was all twisted up inside with worry, but having to calm his grandmother gave him something to focus on.
Leanne couldn't give them much more information than she already had and McGonagall ordered her to the Hospital Wing for a Calming Potion.
Severus studied his son's eyes for a moment before sneering and handing him the potions and salves they would need. Shadow tossed half to the blond and went up to his room without a word of explanation. He didn't think he could tell his father what had happened between Draco and him even if he had wanted to. He wasn't even sure himself.
"I was in the Dark Lord's mind," he said hoarsely, never looking away from his father, needing that connection. Severus didn't flinch. He stayed strong and his face remained passive and accepting. It kept Shadow grounded. "He cast the Killing Curse and suddenly I was sucked in. He killed Avery. I can still feel it. Before it was resonating in my bones," he whispered, wrapping his arms around his chest.
Wait. He knew that voice. Lifting his head as far as he could, he peered through the light and caught sight of red hair. "Great," he muttered and let his head fall back heavily. It was Charlie Weasley, one of the Order Triad. He felt the sheer terror that had sent his heart racing fade. His muscles quivered as the adrenaline left his system. At least it wasn't Death Eaters. "Actually, I'm not a Malfoy anymore. Got disinherited and disowned. I'm Draco Black, Sirius Black's Heir," he informed him and settled in for a very long, very tedious few days.
"That's fine. I doubt they'll question me that long," Shadow shrugged. He leaned forward, eyes intent. "So what's the story you've come up with?"
"I don't know where to start," Salazar admitted, still staring unblinkingly at the teen. "I've never seen anything like this before. Your condition truly is remarkable."
"Thanks." Shadow blushed, surprised by how much Severus's approval affected him. He brushed curls from his eyes in a nervous gesture and eyed his father. "That's not why you wanted this meeting though."
Severus almost snarled out loud, but he was saved from a response by the door opening. Two pairs of watchful eyes snapped forward as Lucius walked in.
"Please, forgive me," Severus said soothingly, raising his hands in a placating gesture. "I should have warned you."
Draco smiled. Happiness lit up inside him, cutting through the maelstrom like lightning. The dark emotions tattered and frayed, storm clouds banished by the sun, and Harry could only stare in wonder as Draco's utter joy washed over him.
In answer, the man removed a piece of parchment from his inner robe pocket. "This is a general timeline of the most credible history I could create for you. It's my background; most is truth, some is falsehood."
Suddenly, Shadow was trembling. He let go of Neville and stepped away. His back hit the door and he slid down, staring up at his brother with lost, tormented eyes. The teen clutched at his shirt, his hand twisting the fabric above his heart. Voice breaking, he demanded, “Think you can save me now?”
Draco's hands tightened around his. His eyes flashed with temper and embarrassment made his cheeks flushed. "Because I cannot bare it that you associate me with Lockhart. I
Seraphim's hands grasped his hips and held him still as the alter ground their erections together. Draco screamed, his legs giving out as the Black magic helped make them slick. Seraphim fell with him, landing on top with an excited growl. The talon's broke his skin, the sharp pain only making things spiral higher. The blood obviously affected Seraphim, as the Black dove forward and practically blanked him in one long caress that had him arching and screaming breathlessly, eyes blind to everything except the fireworks.
Draco sneered, finding the display crass and naïve. Shaking his head, he moved toward the dresser where there was a single picture framed. It was of Regulus and the Quidditch team. The teenagers stood proudly in crisp Hogwarts robes, the Slytherin crest on each chest. Regulus was sitting in the middle of the front row and grinning the same grin Sirius was famous for. The snitch was flapping wildly in his upraised fist. Seeker, of course he was; Draco sighed.
The Gryffindor sighed. "My magic is different from other wizards," he began. "I have Elemental magic. That's why my wand work is always unstable and below average. My true magic is rooted in the Earth. I can sense the soil, the creatures living there. I can commune with plants and help them grow. I have a special teacher who comes once a week to help me with it. There are three levels to Earth magic and I've mastered the first one. One of the things this allows me to do is to sense where people are if they are on the earth or only a little below the surface. That's how I knew to find Shadow in the Chamber. I sensed him down there."
Neville never would have guessed it. His grandmother was very much against sneaking around. She was a pure Gryffindor and only respected direct action. Guess he wasn't the only one with secrets. Her attitude had changed completely, as well. She didn't talk down to him at all, and best of all, she wasn't constantly questioning him.
"Maybe," Shadow said and continued over the noises of denial this provoked from the others. "But that's not what this is about. Is that clear to everyone? Keep your beliefs to yourself. This is a defense group."
"Snake…" Green eyes narrowed dangerously. "No. Not there. Too many people. Him… Neville…taken," he said, recalling the name Draco had used for the ill teen. "Not safe. Stay here. I get more food. Pack safe here."
"The story says I've been raised here with Omi and Severus with occasional tutors. I need your help understanding what exactly that entails. Would you two be willing to put your childhood lessons in a Pensieve so I can know first hand what I'm claiming to have gone through?"
"I believe you destroyed a second one in the graveyard," Severus offered. "I think Demon is just as destructive as a basilisk."
He dove deep down toward the dark ocean floor where light didn't reach. He created his own light and kept going when it was so dark and deep that he was no longer sure he was in an ocean. It seemed more like a black hole of nothingness. Just when he was about to turn back, he saw it. It looked like storm shutters over a cellar. Severus knew that within that cellar would stand two more doors; one made of stone leading to Demon and the other a small cupboard door leading to Boy.
He hit something inside his love and Harry screamed wildly, his nails drawing bloody furrows down Draco's shoulders. Draco couldn't take any more. He followed his lover over the cliff, adding his own cry of pleasure to Harry's and further soaking their stomachs. Collapsing bonelessly, Draco sprawled across Harry's chest.
"Shadow," Neville greeted. The brunet looked just as tired, but he smelled of dirt instead of potions.
The fledgling flung herself forward into his waist. Seraphim raised his wings to keep his balance and growled in irritation. He didn't like his movements hindered, but he did nothing overt to move the female. She smelled excited and happy, but more importantly she smelled healthy. The sense of pain that had hung around her was almost gone. He brought his soon-mate forward with a sweep of his wing. He leaned over so he could take some of the smaller male's head feathers into his mouth to preen them. He was very pleased with him. He had done well with their fledgling.
. That was going to have to change immediately. He handed over the letter to Severus to read and quickly tore into the next one.
"My footing became unsteady and I deemed it unwise to raise a shield or any other magic while he was in such a temper. Ducking seemed the wiser course," Severus explained, voice level, face still blank. "We will be discussing your control or lack thereof later, Draco."
She was tall and slender with light brown eyes and long, curly auburn hair. She would have been considered beautiful if her face wasn't always so steely. Her lips were always tight and slightly turned down at the corners and her light eyes were bright with calculation. She was ambitious and ruthless, two Slytherin qualities, but she lacked the third: deviousness. She did not possess the capacity to hide her intent behind the many masks Slytherins wore to beguile allies and enemies alike.
"He wouldn't speak to my mother or me, but sometimes he'd fly into rages of paranoia, suspecting us of betrayal…" Draco paused, letting the music distance him from his story.
"Thank you." Harry smiled at her, thinking of her son Anthony. He was in the DA and was a good fighter, although he was very suspicious of everyone.
Then Boy had been brutalized in the graveyard by sadistic, insane men using magic - the only thing that had ever helped Boy - in the cruelest ways possible to inflict as much agony as they could for almost two hours. That was an eternity when struggling with pain. Draco had witnessed what happened in the graveyard. Unraveled wasn't too far from the truth. It had been gruesome; worse even than anything he had seen Demon do to the people at the hospital.
"No," Shadow said faintly, black crowding the edges of his vision. "No. Don't. You'll just make it worse."
She wiggled and Shadow put her on the floor before opening the dressing room door. Severus's face softened with a smile as little Marissa walked out. The white dress fell to her knees, the bottom poofy with a crinoline underskirt. Yellow embroidered flowers decorated the bodice and the bottom hem. To top it off, she had on little shiny dress shoes with a sparkly buckle.
"Only when he acts suspiciously!" Ginny countered hotly, crossing her arms and glaring at Neville. "I thought we got over the secrets thing, but obviously I was wrong. Maybe you even made up that story so that I wouldn't come snooping around!"
Quickly rolling it up, he shoved it into the backpack he carried. He moved forward after the lynx form of Shadow. As they passed the statue of Magical Brethren, a second cloak was pulled off, revealing Ron, Hermione, and Ginny. The three of them fell into step behind Draco and a nervous Neville. Fifty paces later, the twins shimmered into view beside the abandoned security table after removing the disillusionment charms they had used.
Severus knelt and pulled him into a loose hug. "I am sorry, Shadow. I promised to stand beside you, and I was unable to keep that promise."
"Come on, boy, I won't hurt you," the brown-haired man said gently, lifting the spoon to Neville's mouth.
"Draco," Severus drawled, poisonously sweet. "Even someone of your limited intelligence should be aware of when to call for help. You're no Hufflepuff or Gryffindor to arrogantly believe you can handle any situation. This leads me to question why else you didn’t summon me."
The cat ignored his words and moved gracefully forward, its short tail lashing gently behind it with every step. Draco tensed and prepared to fire a spell; the beast was only fifteen feet away… ten… He opened his mouth to shout a blasting curse when suddenly the animal stopped and sat on its haunches. Draco gasped, surprised.
Shadow went looking for Draco. He found the blond in the common room and quickly pulled him into one of the private sitting rooms. Draco was furious when he heard what happened. He quickly told Shadow about coming up to his room Wednesday night and Curtis Warrington's threat.
"I'll talk to Severus later," Shadow reassured him. "I'm just not ready yet. I'm still thinking about things. Besides, it's not like he'll help your case. He doesn't think messing around with Seraphim is a good idea, either."
Shadow sat silently in a chair, his hands rubbing at his face tiredly. "We have to finish this war soon or there's going to be nothing left after this is over."
Severus snarled silently, but the oncoming tirade was cut off at the sound of many people approaching. The Potion Master ran toward the downed Moody and searched his person before levitating him. "We must go!"
, was never beaten and broken like I know he was. I don't associate myself with that kind of trauma because I'm not damaged. It bothers me that you always thought of me in those terms."
Draco let him go and stood, taking a few steps back. "How long were you pretending to sleep?" he asked as he searched Shadow's expression.
Remus arrived back at Headquarters feeling glad to be back. Minerva had set him out on an errand for her and only now had he completed it. He found her in the study she had claimed as her office. She looked up and smiled, but her face was tired, her eyes dark.
Severus watched as his son's eyes widened in animalistic panic, his arms twitched in a flail-like gesture, his breath wheezing in and out of his lungs. "Occlude. Stay calm. We are safe," Severus said softly, knowing if Harry panicked, he would run mindlessly down the tunnel and most likely into enemy hands. His hand tightened around his wand, ready to use it to knock his son unconscious.
He whined low in his throat and the smaller male hurried forward. He offered a cup full of liquid and the clean smell of cool water hit his senses, driving him to whine needily again. His soon-mate helped him drink. The liquid brought strength back to his limbs and he rose into a careful crouch, his wings out for balance as he took in the new place.
Shadow leaned back in his chair and sighed, remembering this past summer when he and Draco had shared a room at Grimmauld Place. His nightmares had been particularly bad then and he'd wake Draco several times a week. The Slytherin had never gotten annoyed. Instead, Draco had talked him out of it, careful not to touch him and make it worse - just talked to him until Shadow’s heart had stopped racing and the terror had slowly crept back into the corners of his mind where it hid.
"Ron!" Hermione cried, but she was too far away to stop what was happening, especially with Montague dueling her. If she dropped her guard, she'd be done.
The boy was screaming now, hoarse rasping screams, almost breathless with terror. Umbridge didn't know what she expected, but it wasn't this.
"He's staying on as the Grounds Keeper," Miles added, shrugging. "Professor Grubby-Plank is coming back to teach next term."
The teen lay as if sleeping, face slack and peaceful, but he was not merely sleeping. Shadow was in a deep coma, completely unresponsive to outside stimuli. His dreams were his sole reality now.
Cooing, almost chirping, he moved forward and wrapped the Boy in his wings, pulling her forward and surrounding her with the White in his feathers. The scent of pain and fresh blood evaporated, and slowly, so very slowly, the terror drained away with it. He rocked the little fledgling held to his bare blood-spattered chest. The Boy was small enough to hold with one arm, so he cradled her there as he moved across the floor to the window.
"After Draco told me the story of the raid on Malfoy Manor, I returned and fetched your things." Severus uncurled from his uncomfortable position on the couch and stood. His back popped loudly and he grimaced.
Draco actually considered that. Success before pride at this point. He couldn't mess around. Too much depended on him making the right decision. He took stock of his condition and frowned as the aches, pains, and exhaustion fully registered.
"Is this not the creature who attacked St. Mungo's over Christmas break?" McGonagall asked carefully.
A growl sounded to the right and Charlie spun to see five half-transformed werewolves spring out of the darkness. He cried a warning, but it was too late. He went down under a heavy body. A vicious bite tore into his shoulder and, with a roar of pain, he got busy fighting for his life.
When he'd had a seizure and come back after torturing the Dursleys, Draco had stood beside him as Shadow had stared in a mirror. Draco hadn't flinched from his badly scarred body and tried to convince him that he wasn't a monster. Yes, the Slytherin had always supported him - quietly, loudly, whatever was needed - but there was also play between them.
The first floor was dark, dusty, and the same as he remembered it. He moved toward the stairs. The door at the top was shut but hung a little to the side, allowing a solid bar of light to fall across his face. Taking a deep breath, practically vibrating with tension, he toed the door open to keep his wand aimed forward. Nothing could have prepared him for what he saw.
Draco stopped at an unassuming door and pushed it open. It was a bathroom. Shadow fell on the sink, slurping up the deliciously cold water. Draco waited, keeping an eye on the hallway. Several minutes later, Shadow finally pulled himself away. His belly was painfully full, swishing when he moved.
He shifted Shadow to one arm and reached for his wand. He conjured a bowl of water and summoned a wash cloth. Very carefully he dipped the cloth in the water and wiped at the cold-sweat and tears marring Shadow's face. He smiled as his love slowly relaxed, his eyes fluttering closed as he rested his head in the crook of Draco’s neck.
"I'll stop by again tomorrow night with a charmed pendant. It will get you into the Chamber. Use it only in emergencies or if you're
"Because," Salazar sneered, unimpressed with the teen's intelligence, "that means Voldemort can't take Seraphim from you by simply calling for him. Had the Dark Lord known what was really going on, he could have easily devastated your power and possessed all of Demon's strength whenever he wanted. Now he can't. It's too late. Demon no longer exists. Seraphim is yours. He is cleansed of Voldemort's personality and instincts. Now he is shaped solely by the experiences he endured as both Demon and Boy, as well as the emotions you imbued both alters with."
Severus and Remus were standing behind Harry to either side of Draco like good bodyguards. Both of them were under Polyjuice. Severus was a tall, blonde muscle head, while Remus was an older black man. They couldn't have picked disguises that looked more different if they'd tried, but both had a readiness in their posture that said they weren't to be messed with.
Unexpectedly a gust of fresh air brushed by them as someone flung open the door to the Room of Requirement. Smoke billowed past them as it raced toward the open door and the hallway beyond it. A figure moved forward, but a wall of fire cut between them. Sirius wasn't sure if that was a good thing or not. He only caught a glimpse of the figure and with the smoke he wasn't sure if it were Umbridge or a friend to the rescue.
Draco smiled back and chuckled softly. "Considering your new Animagus form, I'd say you're a fallen angel. How about Seph? Short for Seraphim."
"Thank god we know where the locket is." Shadow's fists clenched and his eyes glowed faintly. "This has got to stop."
So he merely Obliviated her and crafted the most intricate and complex memories he was capable of to make her think nothing odd had happened in the detention. A boggart had appeared, took the form of a Ministry executioner, and frightened Shadow until Umbridge banished it and let the shaken teen go, smug in the knowledge she had power over Shadow and, through him, his awful father. Hopefully the artificial satisfaction he had implemented would lead her to leave Shadow alone for awhile.
"It seems like there is a small space, about twenty feet wide, between the outside defenses and the inside defenses where there are no spells," Sirius answered. "You must have fallen into that area between the two that is clear."
"I can s-sense Demon's m-m-magic. I think he's cl-cl-close to the surface," Neville explained barely above hearing level.
Severus strode over. His pale features kept twitching out of the perfect bland mask he was trying to conform his expression to. "Why didn't you tell me sooner about the visions?"
The blond lay cold and clammy. His breath literally frosted the air. Shadow shakily cast warming charms, any that he knew. If Draco's core body temperature dropped too low, he would die. He looked up to see Severus's distraction fall and another assault was coming. He looked back and saw Neville sitting with wide eyes, awake, but still weak. The Gryffindor flung his wand forward and bolstered Shadow's shields, but it wasn't going to be enough. That understanding passed between the two teens, horror and resignation drifting through their eyes like clouds.
"When you graduate, you will be forced to work with people you don't necessarily like or enjoy. Think of this as practice. Any injury or insult to your fellow Housemates, even if they are your enemy, is a slur and insult to you personally. Remember, this is a good time to make allies and future connections. The most ambitious and determined witches and wizards are standing next to you, so protect them as you would future assets."
"You don't have to," Draco promised. "Your mental barriers are strong enough to keep him locked in. It's the seizures that free him, but Professor Snape made a potion to help with that. Every since your first seizure, he's been working on it. He just got it finished the day of your birthday while you slept. That's why he was so mad at Lupin and Black for letting you go outside alone. He has a potion that can keep you unconscious until you reassert control."
," Severus hissed softly, a deadly threat glittering in his eyes. He stood and leaned over his desk threateningly. "Especially that idiot Black."
Neville's head snapped up. His eyes widened in his already pale face as a hunted expression stole across his features. "I-I don't kn-know," he stammered nervously.
Shadow eyed his friend. Draco had fallen silent and pensive, obviously upset about something. "Tell me."
"It's not that simple and you know it," Shadow answered pointedly, meeting his brother's angry gaze. When Professor Lockhart had done bad things to them, they hadn't come forward either.
"I'm sorry my disappearance as Harry caused you all such grief…" he began carefully, feeling his way through the situation. "I certainly didn't want to hurt anyone. To be honest, I didn't know you guys would take it so hard."
He went around the circle, pushing them to think in more and more detail, bringing the image to life.
Seraphim collapsed on the bedroom floor as soon as the portkey released him. His head swam and nausea welled in his throat. Sensing movement from the side, he slashed out with the knife, a snarl on his lips.
"That was a letter from Percy," Ron spat furiously. His fist lashed out and punched the wall. The girls' eyes got wide. "He wants to know why Hermione is giving the great Undersecretary a hard time in DADA. I guess Umbridge complains to Fudge or something about there being a group of students who she suspects has plans to work against the Ministry. Dear Percy thinks I need to distance myself from awful Hermione. That she may be influenced by a dangerous crowd of anarchists! He said anarchists and was talking about the Order!"
He turned and saw Marissa standing there, looking upset. "What is it, sweetie?" he asked, pulling her into his arms and standing.
Lucius caressed the cauldron before gesturing sharply at the two Death Eaters waiting obediently near the door. Severus watched as they deftly placed preserving spells on the potion and carried the whole cauldron out of the room.
Draco laughed. "Sure." He pulled his lover down with him, and this time, it was he who rolled onto his side and draped a protective arm across his love's chest.
"The mediwizard informed me you would be hungry," she said and gestured toward the kitchen. "You won't do anyone any good fainting. Eat and then you may go, young man. And the longer you argue, the longer it will be before you return to the Order, so I suggest you hurry into that kitchen."
Without another word, he turned and headed for the stairs. Remus was in Shadow's bedroom as Severus knew he would be. The werewolf sat beside the bed, his head hanging and his hand tightly wrapped around Shadow's.
Content, filled with a happy exhaustion, he lay on his stomach, one arm wrapped around his soon-mate, the other around their fledgling, and spread a wing over them both. Soon they were all asleep, warm in their blankets and safe in their nest.
Shadow sighed and closed his eyes. He leaned back against the headboard trying to marshal his thoughts. Draco waited patiently. When Shadow peeked at him, his friend was still determined to have this out now. "Fine." He sat up straight. "I'm still feeling unsure about your relationship with Seraphim. It upsets me that you won't help me think of ways to keep him locked away as much as possible. Even though I know he has to come Out for the full moon, I don't like that you don't share my feeling of regret over that."
"I thought… I thought you were dead," Shadow whispered into his father's chest. He felt shaken to his core. Severus had come to represent home, safety, security, and care. The thought of losing the man was terrifying.
Draco hesitated but relented. Sighing, the blond crawled back into the bed he and Shadow had been sharing. There wasn't enough rooms to give Draco one of his own. He was just lucky Shadow didn't mind. The twins had also offered, but three to a bed was a bit much. Plus Draco had a suspicion that he wouldn't come out of their room whole by morning. The Weasley twins were utterly insane.
"I just found him like this," George heard himself answering his irate professor. The spell Umbridge cast on him was so powerful he couldn't even allude to what happened at the detention.
Shadow fumed silently as the two left him. The more people who knew his secret, the higher the chance that his enemies would learn of it, putting him in more danger. Danger he wasn't ready to face. He was still scowling when Severus came back.
Severus felt the almost sweetness of that power. It was purer than anything he had ever experienced with the Dark Lord, but years as a slave to Voldemort had taught Severus a lot. He immediately sunk to his knees and tilted his had slightly to the side, exposing his long throat.
Finally, he felt the magical lock give way. Crying out in triumph, Draco threw open the door and stepped into a room of light. Eyes wide, he stared at the splendor around him. The room wasn't that big really, but it felt enormous. The walls were golden; huge Roman columns stood in rows like some kind of majestic forest. He could just barely make out figures etched into the pure marble, but before he could take a closer look, all of his attention was consumed by the pure white globe pulsing in the center of the room.
Shadow flew out of bed, covered in sweat. Panting, wild-eyed, he stumbled into the farthest corner of the room and stood there, shaken and confused and angry. Twice! That was twice now that he had a… a…
"Just answer the question. Where are we?" Shadow demanded. He climbed out of the tall bed and realized he was still dressed in the jeans, long sleeved shirt, and black jacket he'd had on the day before. At least no one undressed him without letting him know.
Silence met her declaration. She eyed both men. She was starting to think that it wasn't just Severus in on the conspiracy and that made her even angrier. "No. I think you both know where Potter is. I think he is close and reachable. I think you helped him construct this absurd cover about China, which Miss Granger has informed me has holes in it regarding the temple in which he says he is staying. This is too important to keep from me, Severus, Sirius. You know how much is riding on his safety, as well as our ability to aid and protect him. Things are going to get worse from here on out. He can no longer remain in hiding. Do you understand?"
Black mist spiraled out of the wand. Draco fought to keep his hand steady. The closer the cloud got to Amycus, the more streamline it became until it streaked across the distance like a miniature Dementor. Amycus jerked, his back arching. A scream of pure despair erupted from his throat. The girl, Alice, screamed and scrambled out of her seat, away from the man now convulsing on the floor.
"Oh, Viktor!" She flung her arms around his neck and sobbed. "I've just been so confused. So many bad things are happening. It's all happening so fast. Everyone's so afraid. They all look to me in the DA to help them and it's so overwhelming."
Hermione kept looking back, but she didn't know what else to say. It was all too much! Not only had Harry been here all this time, but it was like her worst fear had come to life - that Harry was lost to her forever. She never expected Harry himself to be the one to deliver the terrible news.
As much as he hated it, he knew he wasn't ready for that kind of intimacy, even with Draco. It was maddening because he needed it as much as he feared it. This was the first time he'd allowed himself to really think about it since then. It sent his heart racing. He fought to breathe past the panic. God, had he really done that? Draco had been
"It's not that I don't feel worthy, like I'm not good enough or something." Shadow shook his head helplessly, fingers white where they clutched the blanket up around his neck. "It's just… all the stuff I've been through. With my Dissociative Identity Disorder, Lockhart, Dark Lords, Demon and Boy… It's too much, you know? It's almost too much for me, let alone someone who doesn't have to deal with it if they don't want to. And who would? Want to, I mean."
"Then Ron, Ginny, and Hermione got suspicious and cornered us. They threatened to blow the whole thing if we didn't let them come," George added, head downcast. "So we took them to Neville. They convinced him to let them come along instead of just tying them up there. We flooed to the Leaky Cauldron and then took a Muggle taxi to the Ministry's public entrance. Draco and Shadow were waiting for us there."
"I guess we'll deal with it when school lets out for the summer." Shadow hated the idea of waiting. He wanted to make sure the rite was ended as soon as possible to make sure Draco was safe, but he didn't see how he could while they were here at school.
"I know how hard that was for you to admit, Shadow," Severus said while reaching across the table to grab his son's wrist. "I'm proud of you that you took that first step."
Draco quickly cut in, trying to distract them both from his friend. "Aren't you dating Krum, Granger?"
"M-Master Regulus took form his pocket a locket like the one the Dark Lord had," the elf sobbed. "And he told Kreacher to take it and, when the basin was empty, to switch the lockets… And he told Kreacher to leave without him! And never… tell what he… had done… but to destroy the first… locket… And he drank… all the potion… and Kreacher swapped the lockets…. And watched as Master… Regulus… was dragged beneath the water… by the cold dead hands in the water…"
With a laugh and a swirl of his wand, he sent the candy hurtling toward the owner. It filled his mouth and muffled his screams. Soon he was choking and gagging as more and more candy and chocolates were stuffed down his throat. Lucius smiled.
He vividly remembered coming upon Shadow in the Dursleys' house after Demon had finished reaping his vengeance. His brother had been blood-spattered and deeply in shock. What if he was that way now? He might be lost or afraid. Neville knew he might be the only one who could find him, but even thinking about using his Earth magic made him want to sick up again. He gritted his teeth, sending spikes of pain through his skull.
"I'll tell what you were doing in here. I'll tell your brother, your heart-father, and I'll tell the Headmistress."
His blue eyes looked up at her. He and Charlie were the only ones who had blue eyes. The rest of her brothers had brown, like her. He and Charlie were special. They were the nicest to her. Looking at Ron now, he looked older and tired. He looked like he was trying to tell her something, but she couldn't understand. She couldn't think.
"Are you done playing like children?" Severus drawled from the doorway. With a single flick of his wand, Draco's barrier had disintegrated.
Severus was skilled and vicious, especially when it came to protecting his son, but he was only one man. He was standing against three well-trained Death Eaters. Draco was a help, but the boy was quickly approaching the end of his strength. Fatigue would take him down soon even if the Death Eaters didn't.
First he was walking down the stone corridor, wishing he were brave enough to touch Demon's door, lust and excitement consuming him at the idea of all the destruction Demon was capable of… Then he was in a bed, the sheets bunched around him, twisting under his grasping hands, a mouth working him, nails tantalizing the sensitive skin on his inner thighs, and the moans… Oh, the moans that almost pushed him over the edge, the vibrations cutting straight through him…
Sirius hugged her tightly, pulling her into his lap and against his chest. "Bye, pet. Don't have too much fun without me." He ruffled her hair before setting her gently on her feet.
"I think it's going to suck and I don't see why I should bother," Shadow said stubbornly, glaring into his father's eyes.
Before bed, the Weasley clan and Hermione went up to Ron's bedroom. The redhead was woken by Poppy and he smiled tiredly at his family. They talked quietly, giving him support and love. He was even able to open his presents with their help. Poppy smiled at the touching scene, but she had to ask them to leave after an hour when tension lines appeared on her patient's face.
! Suddenly, an idea struck the alter. It was so new and unusual that he had to laugh. If smashing these pathetic little
Draco glanced over and met his gaze and Shadow realized he had never seen eyes that color. A grey-silver, flinty almost, in the morning sunlight. The strength of Draco's promise to stand and fight beside him, fight
A Blasting Curse shot by one of the minions guarding the manor slipped around Draco's shield. Propelled backward, the lynx rolled end over end down the hard concrete stairs. He slid once he reached the bottom in a clumsy sprawl of limbs along the slick dungeon floor. Sneezing, the lynx transformed back to his human form. Harry opened his eyes to darkness that hadn't seemed nearly so black a second ago, but on the plus side the smell of feces, sickness, and mildew was also blessedly muted.
More Order members poured into the room, shouting reports. All the Death Eaters had fled. Neville attacked Elphias Dodge, the old man's cries sending the others scattering backward out of range of the deranged teen's influence. Bill cast at the vines again and again, but they kept growing back and in a few minutes a new tree stood tall, Elphias silenced, dead.
Draco's frown deepened when they went in the opposite direction as the Chamber. It took him only five minutes to realize Shadow was sneaking up to Gryffindor Tower. He groaned silently and rolled his eyes. Why must Shadow do such crazy things? But he was committed, so he kept his eyes open and his senses alert. His wand was ready to stun anyone who happened upon them. Luckily, Shadow had timed it right and they arrived without discovery.
Fudge had been ordered to print his answer in Monday morning's paper. It was Saturday morning now. The war started in two days. Shadow lifted his head and handed the paper over. Severus read it avidly. Shadow turned and sat heavily, putting his head in his hands.
"Thank you, Severus. I will go over them immediately and have Neville over for dinner sometime soon." Remus stood and took the books. "May I ask who Shadow has an interest in?"
"He's very talented. I thought I'd help him. His voice projects better from up there, don't you think?" Luna asked dreamily, her blue eyes smiling up into his.
Neville sat hunched against the wall. His face was white as snow and his eyes were glassy. Shadow skid up to him and knelt. He put his fingers against this brother's pulse point and sighed in relief when he felt the steady thump. Neville groaned and his head fell limply sideways as he passed out.
“Nothing." Shadow scowled, brushing black curls off his forehead. "As much as I want to, doing anything will lose me the only advantage I have and place Severus in danger of her wrath. She has to think she has control over me."
Mice possess great courage in facing a world that is so much bigger than they are. They often feel fear but will not allow it to control them for long. A Mouse-type person is too rational to allow that, but sometimes that rationality is a failing, leading the person to disregard all instincts and intuition.
"Where's Draco?" he asked softly. Neville couldn't speak or move. Seraphim backhanded him viciously across the face, and the teen fell with a startled cry. "WHERE IS HE?" he bellowed.
"Let's hope you weren't so thorough this time, dear friend," Lucius said lowly. With that, he turned and stalked from the room. Avery and Nott followed and slammed the door behind them.
Rocking his whole body forward on every downward thrust of his fingers, the piano's voice grew louder and louder. Shadow threw back his head as the beat picked up, became angry. So wrapped up in the moment, the absolute freedom, the perfect release, he didn't realize he wasn’t alone.
"Yes. He and Draco were both taken. We're looking for them now." Remus lifted a rag from the end table by Neville's head. One charm later and it was damp with cool water. He gently wiped at the teen's sweaty face. "Rest. I'll tell you as soon as we find them."
Severus pulled him in and quickly slammed his door shut again. The man looked around the room. Remus and Neville were on one couch. Shadow and Draco were sitting across from them, and there were two arm chairs at each end completing the circle. Sirius sighed. He had obviously been asked to come to hear bad news.
"And, finally, Professor Dolores Umbridge will be the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Now, there are further announcements, but we shall have them after…"
Shadow felt an uncontrollable smile spread across his face. The response was so Draco-like that he could literally hear his friend's voice in his head. He had a fond flashback of the careful dance of letters between them last summer.
. Shadow leaned back and gently wiped the blood away. There was no escaping it. Draco was dying and not even Seraphim could save him, even if Shadow were to call the alter Out. Draco was dying and it was because of Shadow. It wasn't fair because Draco had given him so much, had tried so damn hard to hold everything together. He was a hero, as stupid as that sounded, he really was.
Draco sat up, clutching his wand. "Harry!" he cried when he saw he was no longer dealing with Seph. "Are you okay?"
Shadow stared down at the front page headline. Draco leaned in to read with him. Both were frowning in seconds. Glancing quickly around the table, Draco noted those who shared their expression and those who remained neutral. He was pleased to see more Slytherins than he expected to read the article with faint disapproval.
Shadow met Neville's eyes. "No. My brother's right. It does no good to dwell on how I feel about the Umbitch." He looked to Draco and asked, "What time is it?"
Tired eyes - haunted eyes - rose to his. Voice thick and needy, she whispered, "Where did th’angel go?"
Magic left him in a powerful punch, funneled through his wand, and spiraled out like an invisible tornado that teased the robes of the three wizards in front of him as it passed. The elder goblin tensed, his step faltering before he turned and smiled at Draco.
Shadow took the potion with trembling hands, fat teardrops still clinging to his long dark lashes. He looked younger than his age, worn down and vulnerable, his formidable barriers temporarily overcome.
"Can't you be serious?" Blaise came off the wall and stalked over to his bed. He flung his wand down and sat. "This isn't a joke."
"No, thank Merlin." Blaise shook his head and stared at the far wall. "I've only had to duel once so far. I lost."
"Maybe we should!" Shadow challenged. "It was an abusive relationship that fucked me up. Who's to say I won't walk right into another one? Huh? What if I go out there and am attracted to a bad relationship because that is all I know? What if I start wanting more
Ginny smiled up at Mr. Lovegood as he opened his door. The elder man laughed and tugged her into his house, shutting the door behind her. Ginny stumbled a bit, surprised at the enthusiastic welcome.
"Boy is completely insane now. The abuse he has suffered for years and the torture this summer… It was too much for any human to endure, let alone a helpless child," Remus agreed softly. "Especially since Boy's mentality is that of a five-year-old."
His pelvic bone shattered with a disgusting cracking noise. Large splinters pierced though his skin and carved through the highly-sensitive groin nerves. Agony sheared his world in two; it was so great he could not even scream, reduced to a gibbering, drooling wreck.
"Papa was so mad," she confessed, shaking. "He… He… pushed me. I fell and got cutted on the glass 'cause Mama broke the bottle… I should'a been more careful!"
Unsteady ground heaved violently and the arch with the veil completely disintegrated. Shacklebolt stumbled back, coughing against the dust. Draco covered his face, protecting it. Seraphim gasped, but managed to stand and drag the blond and Severus further up the benches and away from the collapsing ruin. The ground was still shaking and it was getting worse.
Shadow doubted that very much. Standing, he made his way to the door, knowing Severus's dark eyes were still on him. He felt fragile and brittle. It wasn't a feeling that made him at all happy. He wanted Severus to come with him, but he couldn't bring himself to ask for his company either. It was too great a weakness.
"All right. We'll leave off therapy every week; instead we'll have it every month," Severus allowed.
Ginny lifted her head to see Ron staring across the room. The seething mass of students, vampires, and Death Eaters parted just enough for her to see Hermione fall to the floor. Ron lashed his wand forward and summoned the girl's body. Ginny wheezed, her chest too tight as she crawled forward. Words, words she vaguely recognized, brought her attention back to her brother.
Confusion had him tilting his head, his wings bunching up on his back. Why were they not at their safe nest? Why were they in this warren? He no longer smelled the fog-predators, but the smell of death was just as unpleasant, not to mention the fact that humans had been in this warren recently. He growled at his soon-mate, asking why they had moved from their nest.
The teen's face seemed to crumple in on itself, his apathy evaporating as grief roared to the surface. Shadow moved forward instantly. He sat next to his friend and wrapped an arm around his shoulders as Rogan sobbed into his shaking hands.
Neville couldn't stop smiling at the thought. Remus deserved a chance at happiness and love. It had been too long denied him as it was. He couldn't wait to write Shadow via their connected parchments to tell him everything!
Salazar ignored him and continued to carefully separate the Baron's essence from Shadow's complex and meticulously compartmentalized mind.
Draco gasped, his back arching as his heart gave a hard beat and continued its rhythm. He quickly blinked away tears and smiled up at Hermione Granger. "Thank…" His gratitude was cut short as a vampire came up behind her and grabbed her head, breaking her neck. Draco screamed in denial, jumping to his feet with his wand practically vibrating in his hand.
"My intention was not to lay my burden on your shoulders. It is in the past," Severus said softly. His emotions were gone and in their place was the open pool that had been such a comfort to Shadow in the past. "I am honored to have a second chance as a father. Thank you, Shadow."
"Things are beginning to get bad," she said gravely, staring at him through tired hazel eyes. Her hair was looking more grey than usual and Shadow felt a sudden pang of sympathy. "I promised your father that you would be safe here. I am appalled that you came so close to injury."
Seraphim glared at him, but the bruise reminded him that he had failed and the blond deserved consideration. Sighing, he nodded but added, "You will stay with me."
"If I have to!" Shadow retorted and picked up his pace. "It'd be more sane than what you're suggesting! I'm just not power-blind to see it!"
"Write me any information you gather about the Death Eaters," Draco responded, ignoring the jab. "I'll help you make plans. We still have over half a basilisk in the school."
"Snap out of it, Neville!" Remus snapped harshly, stepping forward with golden eyes. "You don't know what you're doing!"
Ron was looking over her shoulder and muttering the phrases that most sounded like their friend. Hermione had to admit it
Gasping, his heart rocketed in his chest. His eyes were wild and his mouth gaped open in desperate denial. Cheeks flushed with arousal, his groin burning with a deep aching need, he shuddered and flung himself from the bed. He stood there shaking, knowing he couldn't escape the dream just by leaving the bed, or the room, or even the castle.
A couch sat a few feet away with black pillows on it. A stone fireplace was to his right with a warm fire crackling peacefully. Shadow was sweating in the jacket he wore, but when he moved to take it off, he realized it was his straight jacket and his arms were pinned around him.
"How can you hesitate when all that loot is sitting right in front of you?" Sirius exclaimed, flinging himself at the teen and shaking him hard by the shoulders. "Look alive, man! There be gifts to plunder!"
Boy watched this familiar gesture and sighed softly. He lowered his arms and leaned his head tiredly against the couch, looking up at Draco almost sleepily. "Sometimes I remember and the dark has nothing to keep me from remembering. Then the dark is just another bad place," Boy explained with hitching breaths, silent tears rolling down his grief-stricken face. "Boy is bad and deserves to be punished."
He grinned and tickled her tummy. "And that's why I love you so, my dear. You know how to appreciate a good piece of cake."
Ron's blush tripled. "Oh… ah… I see…" Embarrassed beyond belief, he pushed open the portrait and hurried through.
Draco complied. He explained as best he could about the attack on Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade, the fight with Lucius, Neville's kidnapping, working with the Order, and the rescue, stopping only to provide more detail when Severus interrupted with sharp questions. By the time he finished, the vegetables and spices were added and they left the pot to simmer. Severus conjured two chairs to go with the single table, and they sat together silently, lost in thought.
George tapped his chin thoughtfully, looking at the ceiling. "I guess we could turn our attention back to the spying Muggle devices you gave us. We could finish magic-proofing them and have Padfoot plant them at HQ."
Severus looked around with crystal clarity. He hadn't been this still inside since he was an active spy. His thoughts - the constant mental chatter - were suppressed. His mind was operating at a highly perceptive and reactive level. It was a mindset very much attuned to the immediate present.
Shadow blushed, his heart rate picking up as he stared into Draco's luminous grey eyes. "What happened? Where are we?” Only then realizing he was naked, he gasped and pulled his knees to his chest, covering himself as much as he could.
Determined, Shadow knelt and pulled him half into his lap. "Draco. You did it. You did it; it's over."
Umbridge practically glowed, she was so ecstatic. "Well, well. I should have known. Yes. You two have always leaned toward dangerous ventures. But this! You've really outdone yourselves time, delinquents."
Shadow made his face completely blank and stood at the empty seat next to Severus's. He inclined his head as McGonagall gestured at everyone around the table to introduce them. As he met the eyes of each person named, there was an identical spike of shock and wariness either quickly buried or shrugged off when they caught a good look at his eyes. He wished his eyes were normal, wished he didn't cause that reaction, but he knew wishes like that were worthless. He'd have to deal with it and the reaction his eyes would always evoke.
Backs straightened and wand arms stiffened. Ginny smiled at them encouragingly. This was it; their time to prove themselves. And they were going to give some Death Eaters the surprise of their life.
He didn't really know Ginny all that well. She was a year younger. He hadn't noticed how mature she acted or how quick-witted she was. She looked physically different from the last time he’d seen her, too. It was amazing how much girls could change in just a couple months. Her chest was filling out as well as her curves. Her hair was a bit longer, still thick and dark red. Her eyes were bright with intelligence and humor. Mostly, he was thinking about how he would have an excuse to hang out with Neville if he befriended Ginny now, since she was bound to spend a lot of time with her boyfriend once they returned to school.
"Not bad. Looks like you've had a good teacher." Draco laughed as his hand dropped from Shadow’s head to land gently on Shadow's shoulder.
In the end, the boys decided that it was best to wait. There was really nothing else they could do. They didn't have an explanation about what took place at St Mungo's or a plausible story about their disappearance from Grimmauld Place. To be more precise, they didn't have any way to back up any story they could create. For that, they would need Severus' help. So they decided to stay at Snape House until the Potions Master and Sirius returned from trying to remove the Horcrux from the cave.
The Aurors hesitated, but they turned and left the house. Augusta slammed it behind them and spun around, staring at her grandson.
"Umbridge had it this whole time," Draco said in disgust, lip curled. "We hope she has it here with her. As soon as we get our hands on it, we'll bring it down and stab it with a basilisk fang."
"Montague is really serious about the Quidditch Cup this year because it's his last chance to get the attention of the professional teams," Miles continued, the sandy-haired boy flushed with enthusiasm. "Our only real competition is Gryffindor this year. Seventh-year Angelina Johnson is their Captain. She's also a Chaser, but it's her first year as Captain. We hope that gives us an edge."
The three of them sat quietly for the rest of the evening as night drew near and the fog grew thicker on the ground. Marissa slept for about an hour, the rest of the time she just cuddled next to Draco or Shadow, whichever of the teens was sitting with her at the time. Draco even went out and got Marissa a sweatshirt, paper, and crayons.
Draco inclined his head, but he did not inform him as to the reason of his weight gain and more healthy appearance.
"You know, I knew there was a reason we're friends. I like the way you think," Shadow said with a smile. "Let's have a first meeting this Saturday at the Hog's Head. It's our first Hogsmeade weekend and that'll get everyone away from Hogwarts and out from under the bitch's eye."
"Hermione, it's going to be okay," Shadow soothed. "If they are blocking the owls, then I'll get a message out somehow. You can write them a letter, telling them to move."
Shadow's head snapped around and he caught sight of George huddled under a table. He was holding his right arm to his chest and it didn't look good. It was bent in about three different places; the hand and forearm looked mangled. Hermione lay unconscious next to the redhead, a steady stream of blood trickling out of her nose.
"It's wonderful," Shadow answered, not comfortable with the hand holding his own. Sweat slicked his palm and dampened his face.
It use to be agonizing to withdraw from the Earth, but now he only sighed wistfully. He opened his eyes and started jogging in the direction he knew they were running. Remus followed silently, trusting him and not asking for an explanation. That meant more to Neville than he cared to admit. Very few people in the world trusted him to be competent.
All eyes turned to the single fourteen-year-old in the class. Shadow met her gaze. It was hard to read any emotion in it. Whether or not it was because one eye was a pale lime green and the other was an summer-sky blue was uncertain. He evaluated her expression and stance for a handful of seconds before acknowledging the summons.
"Yes," Boy admitted shyly. He was curled defensively over his vulnerable stomach. His head was tucked down, covering his throat, and his curls hid his eyes mostly from view. He looked frightened and utterly vulnerable.
"I am not the cause," Severus said coldly, glaring at her. "The child is merely tired. Even I can see as much."
Ron smiled wryly at him. "Look. I'm an idiot. I never mean to be, but I just can't seem to get away from it." He rubbed the back of his head, ruffling his short, red hair. "I'm sorry about before. Can we try this again?"
Draco didn't look any different. He was wheezing and gasping, blood still pouring down his face. His eyes were unfocused. He wasn't aware of anything going on around him. Pain still etched itself on his face. Shadow held his hand gently and looked to Remus and Sirius for reassurance, a painful vulnerability shinning in his eyes.
Shadow scowled. A refusal was on the tip of his tongue. He knew very well that Salazar was eager to get his phantom hands on his psyche. The Hogwarts founder that Shadow was the perfect specimen of complex psychology to examine, but his father and Draco were right. Something had to be done about the mental connection to Voldemort. Especially now that they had such vital information to keep absolutely secret.
She studied his face for a moment before nodding. She could accept that. "What about the Earth thing?" she persisted.
The former blond now had deep black hair. They cut it short in the back, but left his chin-length bangs alone. They styled it in a side sweep, so that the left side of his face was exposed, but it covered the other half. With his pale skin and lean, lanky form, he looked like a stereotypical emo teenager.
"We can't go after them directly," Shadow repeated, irritated he had to repeat himself. "It'll start a war among the students and will push people even more firmly against us. It'll make the Death Eater supporters pull together to defend themselves because they're outnumbered. It may even force those who are sitting on the fence to jump to their side to protect themselves from the threats of the Death Eater wanna-be's."
"I don't really remember what happened after Rodolphus helped me escape. It's like a bad dream. I was so empty… Then the Earth was back. It was almost like that time I almost got lost in Earth with Rowena." He shook his head, his hands clenching on his knees. "The m-m-manor was such a small place, with insignificant people scrambling around. I had to get out, that's all that mattered. I was just trying to get out."
"Very well. Everyone grab hold of me.” Severus examined Neville's drawn face. "Hold especially tight, Longbottom. We wouldn't want to leave half of you here."
"Of course," Neville agreed quickly. He helped Remus to his feet and allowed the man to lean on his shoulder.
Shacklebolt's mouth dropped open as the ground trembled under their feet and the archway began to crumble. Draco lashed out and finally freed himself from the Auror's steel-like grip. He flung his arms around Seraphim's waist, ignoring the magical shock that stung his arms, and pulled backward.
Seraphim realized he was trapped with a horrified howl. He crouched down, shivering in terrified horror as his mind flashed back to a graveyard filled with unremitting torture. Figures with hated white masks shifted and moved along the tree line. Surrounded, pinned, helpless once again, great sobs wracked his frame. The monster with a snake face and human body laughed. It echoed, overlapped with the memory of his Uncle's voice.
when he visited life, found comfort only in the deep dark, locked in. Demon hated life - Hated the blue sky above him that mocked his rage and his Boy's agonized existence.
Seeing his rising distress, Severus leaned forward and captured Shadow's eyes with his own. "Talk to me."
"I know." Harry smiled and stepped up to his lover. Standing on tip-toe, he kissed the blond's cheek and wrapped him in a quick, warm hug. "Same for you. Be careful, Draco."
Knowing Shadow would be busy dealing with that, Severus decided to have the therapy session with Boy on Saturday after the morning DA session instead of trying to squeeze it in on Sunday. After Boy's therapy, he insisted that they have a normal session for the remaining time leading up to dinner. Shadow wasn't looking forward to that, either, but he had no choice in the matter.
Neville glared so fiercely over Remus's shoulder that if looks could kill Charlie would have fallen dead. "I didn't talk about Harry to anyone, but if I did, Rodolphus wouldn't have told. He wouldn't have betrayed me."
Shadow nodded and followed McGonagall down the hallway. She stopped at the second door from the stairs and he felt a sudden thrill. How were his Gryffindor associates going to react? He was thinking about telling them the truth, but he had yet come to a decision.
Draco opened his eyes to see that Shadow was watching his face while he still played. The brunet didn't turn away as he made eye contact, and Draco shivered, turning his head forward, looking blindly ahead. It wasn't the color of Shadow's eyes that made him look away; it was the understanding in them. He knew his friend was seeing him through his empathy, and it was disturbing to know Shadow could feel his grief and hurt as if it were his own.
"Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League?" Angelina asked hopefully, overhearing. She was still furious that the Gryffindor Quidditch team hadn't been given permission by Umbridge to play. They were the only ones refused, resulting in the whole team coming tonight. They suspected they were denied in part because of the twins, but also because Umbridge wanted to stick it to the Headmistress. Gryffindor wasn't happy, to say the least.
Fred explained them. "We're trying to figure out how to get the same effect with a charm or maybe a potion. We could make one of our eyes green so we match yours or we could go one brown."
"I get it." Shadow looked away quickly, almost wincing. He glanced at the door with true longing. He had reached the end of his tolerance with the subject. All he wanted was to leave the room quickly. "I'm kind of hungry. Can I go? It was just a dream, anyway."
He must have passed out because the next thing he knew Draco was shaking him and calling his name with fear in his voice. Shadow sat up slowly. His chest was still throbbing and he was damp with sweat. His hands were still shaking, the taste of blood still in his mouth. He looked up into Draco's worried grey eyes and clung to his steady arms.
Seraphim smiled and touched his cheek very briefly with his finger tips before climbing to his feet. He swayed, completely naked, magic beginning to swirl around him in powerful, invisible waves.
Severus inclined his head. "I wish to give you Pensieve memories of my time building this house with Amalia. As well as the memory of Tabitha being born. You should know as much as you can about her if she is to be your mother."
The teens nodded and levitated the trunks upstairs without another word. They put Hermione's trunk into Ginny's room and then had a brief argument. Draco didn't want to room with the twins this time. He wanted to put Neville with them instead and stay with Shadow. Shadow argued that he hadn't spent much time with his brother lately, but the truth of the matter was that Shadow didn't think he could handle sleeping with Draco so close every night.
Sirius grinned, irrepressible, but before he could say anything else, a high-pitched shriek sounded from upstairs. Both Sirius and Severus sprinted for the stairs. They could hear Draco's voice fast with worry, trying to calm the other teen down. Severus burst into the dueling room first, terrified to find Seraphim, but his son's two-colored eyes looked up at him at his entrance.
The door opened across the room. Rogan, Miles, and Lillian stepped inside. They looked a bit haggard, all three standing stiffly due to injuries, but their eyes burned bright just like Draco's. Shadow met them in the middle of the room. He clasped Rogan on the shoulder, pulled an excitedly smiling Miles into a hug, and shook hands with Lillian.
"You don't have to do this," Shadow repeated for about the tenth time. He was looking off to the side, not meeting anyone's eyes. It was obvious that he was embarrassed.
Severus still had hope that he'd be able to create a potion to help his son. He spent his days on experimental potions and brewing for a discreet apothecary in London. It paid him but not as well as he would have liked. His experiments were costly in both time and money, which limited how many he could make in a month.
Corey Fenwick was waiting in the kitchen, tapping his foot impatiently. When he caught sight of the two teens, his face lit up in a broad grin. "Bout time! Let's get this show on the road!"
"You aren't fighting again, are you?" Rogan asked, stepping into the corridor. The last bit of pounding piano music had woken him. He was looking at Draco with a frown, stance defensive, and the blond smiled, glad Shadow was being protected.
Godric broke the delicate ward he held and created a new one. A three dimensional, see-through sketch of Hogwarts rotated on his palm. In a clipped voice, the phantom pointed out every means of access obediently. The blond memorized everything, ideas simmering at the back of his mind as he listened.
"This is the second time I've had to intervene on your behalf, Neville," she said sternly, putting her hands on her hips. "You tell me to send Mr. Lupin to the Ministry after you if you weren't back in two hours, and now I find you being interrogated by the Order. Just what are you up to, young man? I tried to give you some freedom now that you are finally showing promise, but I'm not going to let you drag our name through the mud!"
Tomorrow morning, the students would make their way to Hogsmeade's train station and ride back to London where their families would take them home for the Christmas holiday. Bright crystal light was pouring down from the charmed ceiling. Everyone was chatting happily about their up-coming vacations or how much they were going to miss their friends. Laughter danced up and down the four House tables, and the teachers watched the playful children with fond smiles. It was good to see some things remained untainted.
"I owe you too much. You have to stick around and collect. What good Slytherin would pass up a deal like that, huh?"
Severus folded his hands in front of his mouth as he regarded his son solemnly. "It has everything to do with the topic at hand. You seem to be under the impression that I can turn my concern for you off and on. I was not here during your first seizure. I was not aware of them until the day of the adoption ritual when Lupin approached me in concern. He feared the ritual would provoke another one. I looked at his report and deemed the likelihood of a seizure happening due to the ritual slight.
Draco smiled sadly. "I don't think any such place exists. Besides, I need something from Hogwarts. Please, Seph?"
Draco went first. Seraphim descended much slower, his wings out and slowing his fall. As soon as they reached the bottom, they moved quickly past the dead basilisk that had initially intrigued Seraphim. It wasn't until they were entering the dinning room and Seraphim's stomach rumbled, triggering Draco's own, that he felt a wave incredible self-reproach hit him.
Moody was still staring at the rock sheet and didn't block the spell. He collapsed into a deep slumber.
Severus waved the gratitude away with a familiar gesture. To change the subject, he looked to the smirking blond standing beside them. "Make yourself useful and help me up," he growled.
After the craziness of leaving, it was nice to find a quiet carriage. The three Prefects of their group weren't with them, doing their duties and getting inducted by the Head Boy and Girl. The twins were causing havoc with their friends whom they haven't seen all summer. That left just Shadow, Neville, and Ginny. They found a compartment practically empty with one small girl with long blonde hair sitting alone and reading the Quibbler upside-down.
Septima walked into Ancient Runes silently. Her hazel eyes scanned the room. There were nine students, all Third-years except for Shadow Snape whom she had come to see. It wasn't hard to find the boy. He was different from his peers. It was in his body language and his strange eyes. A maturity and an intensity that even the older students didn't have.
! That kind of heartless brutality wasn't something intrinsic to me. It came naturally to Voldemort's foul, stinking soul. So, yes. I have a monster's soul leeching onto mine, but the plus side was that what Demon did wasn't really
Shadow heard something like ritual in those words, but he had no idea what it meant besides the obvious. It had a profound effect on Draco, though. Fury and then a painful pride flew across his face before settling into something cold, dangerous, and determined. Magic slashed through the air, tasting of cold steel. Draco's eyes were silver.
Severus sneered at the man, ready to reject him out of hand. He could carry his own son without help, but Draco caught his eye. There was no expression on his face and he didn't make any subtle gesture, but Severus could read his intent easily. It was a Slytherin way of communicating and he paused to reevaluate the ex-convict.
"Pretty good..." Shadow sighed. He turned toward the hearth, staring at the flames. His arm rested over the armrest and his posture was relaxed. "Considering we're at war and we're not really doing anything about it." Severus was about to speak, but Shadow gestured him to wait. "I know the Order is working hard, tracking the Death Eaters and setting up warning alarms and support networks. And I know Sirius is on the hunt for Horcruxes, but all that is defensive. I don't feel like we have much more time."
His eyes were feverish, but there was no denying the determination in them. Shadow meant it. If Draco pushed this, he'd abandon their friendship. Hurt, frustrated, but also desperately afraid to lose what little ground he had with Shadow, Draco nodded tightly. Shadow relaxed, his expression almost painfully relieved, and Draco smiled sadly, his eyes dark and soulful. He would do anything to for Shadow, even deny their future, it seemed.
Seraphim brushed her with his wing and nuzzled her cheek briefly before pushing her toward the table.
Shadow memorized the words. He could feel the simple wisdom in them, but Severus was right. He didn't understand what it meant for him personally.
"I can't even imagine," Minerva said softly, wishing she had the power to erase the haunted expression from Severus' face.
"Not really," he answered honestly with a shrug. "Not more than last time. Relationships are fine, but I don't particularly want one. It doesn't matter to me."
"Can't… help… it," Shadow gasped. Tears were beginning to streak down his face as his thighs spasmed, but he was still grinning so much his cheeks hurt.
"Not really.” Shadow shrugged. "I suspect I know where I'm going. And even if I don't get into my father's House, it doesn't really matter to me. I'm not taking many classes with whichever House I'm in anyway."
Hermione laughed. "No wonder you got the Buddhist and Vishnu thing mixed up. You're not even there!"
"What do you want me to do?" Shadow demanded, jumping to his feet and standing his ground. "Occlumency doesn't work all the way! I do not slack in my mental defenses! I didn't do this on purpose!"
"Just listen," Harry said quietly, eyes on his lap once again. "Please. This is hard enough to talk about."
"They disrupted my class and then walked out! They cast aspersions on the Ministry's laws!" Umbridge spat, eye blazing. "I will not stand for this!"
"Maybe." Shadow grinned, amazed that he really did feel better. He hadn't realized how much was being done behind the scenes. It comforted him to know that the Order was still taking the upcoming war seriously and not relaxing their guard after the long silence of these last few months from the Death Eater front.
Shadow hurt. Everything was sore, his throat ached, and his head felt like someone was hammering invisible nails into his skull. Cracking an eye open, he groaned in relief. Wherever he was, it was cool and dark. Gathering his strength, he managed to pry both eyes open. They were heavy and gummed, but he had to know where he was. Had to know he was safe before he could let go again. He felt like he was trying to climb out of a dark, slippery well.
"I will give you a full briefing, Minerva," he murmured, feeling protective of both his son and his Slytherin. "Once I have all the facts and consult with Poppy."
"I think all these forced, whole body transformations are starting to take a toll," Draco said softly, his nimble fingers working out all the knots.
Severus gestured and the prefects melted back into the crowd. "Tomorrow is your first day of classes. Be watchful and make your House proud. Think carefully before you act. You are Slytherins now and your choices reflect on all of us. Mr. Pucey, please show the First-years to their dormitory."
"I'm so glad my little Luna has such friends. It's been so long since we've had such a busy birthday party. Tomorrow will be a glorious day. It's not every day you turn fifteen, after all." Mr. Lovegood laughed again and led her deeper into the house. "We'll have sweet meats and honey roasted peas. It'll be splendid."
"My Lord," Lucius said, bowing so deeply he was almost kissing his knees. "Nagini may not have been able to fetch the prophecy because she doesn't possess enough of your pure essence. She taints it with her own soul. As you know, we are not fully aware of the effects of you using a live specimen for a Horcrux instead of an item. Now we know and I will not fail you again."
Both boys gasped and, when they could see again, discovered Charlie Weasley and Kingsley Shacklebolt standing at their sides. Shadow dropped his shields, Charlie taking his place. The redhead spared him a glance, merely to ascertain his status, before focusing on the battle. The curly-haired teen grabbed Draco and dragged him over to Neville. They sat huddled together for warmth and safety; Shadow kept his wand out and cast a few spells here and there, but mostly he sat guard as his brother fainted once again.
The old Auror didn't turn to face her or respond. He kept his eyes pinned to the curly-haired teen. Shadow met the fearsome gaze impassively and said nothing. Mrs. Weasley came out with large dishes of food hovering around her. With a deft flick of her wand, she had it laid out on the table in no time.
"Why do you do that?" She frowned up at him. She had waited long enough for Neville to open up to her. It was time to take things into her own hands.
Shadow laughed softly, a weight lifted off his shoulders. "Want to go out to the greenhouses? We could help Professor Sprout get the plants ready for winter."
Lucius turned disappointed eyes on the Gryffindor. "I'll be back soon, boy. Then you'll tell me about that monster. You'll tell me everything I want to know."
Draco held him almost painfully tight, his fingertips almost bruising as they clutched at his shoulder blades and tugged at his hair. Shadow moaned, deep in his throat, gasping for air, he couldn’t breathe and something was coming, washing over him, making him shake and shiver, and he thrust even more widely against the blond. Draco’s hips hit the door again and again, thumping as they almost fought against each other.
From the corner of his eye, he saw Healers push open the doors, coming to investigate. The cold, logical part of his mind still present understood that if they tried to interfere, which they would, Demon would kill them without a second thought, with barely a first thought. As if in slow motion, he watched them point and scream instructions as they saw the intruder hunched over Lockhart's bloody soon-to-be corpse. His wand came up; he felt his lips move but heard nothing and they were blasted backward. They flew through the doors and Draco locked them shut.
She nodded solemnly, laying her head trustingly on his shoulder. Draco sighed and pet her now brushed out hair. It fell to the middle of her back in gorgeous waves. He carried her to the blankets in the corner and tucked her in.
His only chance… his family's… Draco's… the Wizarding World's one chance… was for him to stop letting the fear control him. Shadow had to let go of his fear… of fear…
"I think it's about time you opened your presents, Harry.” Sirius grinned as Omi cleared the last of the plates away.
"Not yet," Hermione answered. "But I don't think they know we helped. If anyone gets in trouble, it will be the twins, but I don't think they mind."
Severus didn't even stop to answer. "The clouds are breaking up. I suspect Demon has left the area. Go see if the mutt and wolf managed to get killed before my son vanished." The front door to the house slammed on the last word.
A child of about five ran in front of her. Blood was spattered across his face. His eyes were wide and horrified. He was running blindly, panic-stricken. Without warning, a grey-furred nightmare of teeth and claws leapt from a dark alley and landed on the child, swamping him. The terrified screams became agonized shrieks as Greyback feasted on his favorite meal.
Shadow explained away his ignorance as his father not liking Halloween. This was the one holiday that Severus secluded himself in his quarters and didn't come out unless he had to. Amalia was shopping for Halloween costumes when she and Tabitha were attacked and murdered, so the holiday didn't provide good memories for him.
Severus didn't respond to Shadow's gratitude, instead he sneered lightly and served himself some eggs. Draco and Shadow shared a wry smile at this and followed his example. Some things would never change.
"Calm down," Draco murmured softly. He crouched and practically pulled Shadow into his lap, rubbing his back and arms, trying to stop the faint trembling in the brunet's muscles. "It's okay. Just tell me what happened."
"I was thinking," Shadow said softly, turning sideways in his chair so that he could face his father. Morning sunlight streamed in through the open window and revealed dark circles under Shadow's solemn eyes. "It really sucks that I led the Aurors to Neville and our home, but on the other hand it showed us the Ministry is still actively searching for us. We can't go back to school, can we? Do you think they know I was the creature that attacked St Mungo's?"
"I dream… weird things," Ron admitted. "Pomfrey says that they blurred the foreign impressions as much as they could, but I'll remember some of it." He sighed and pressed his forehead against the glass. "When I'm awake, I don't really think differently, but I
Harry sat down and quickly began to eat to prevent any comments from his father about the kiss he had witnessed.
"Do not tell me, woman," he hissed viciously, pale and shaking with both pain and rage. "It's not as if you will see to that disgraceful boy."
Neville stood, the Earth pouring strength into his body, filling him when for so long he'd been empty. Rodolphus leaned on his shoulder and Neville easily supported his weight. They were going to get out of here. They were going to be free. Nothing was going to stop him.
When he woke up the next morning, he discovered that Draco had been right. He did feel more stable after sleeping. None of his problems had disappeared, but he felt his cool intellect rising to the fore and he sighed in relief. First things first. He lifted his wand and spelled Marissa into sleep, making sure she wouldn't wake until he was ready.
Shadow spoke softly beside her. "My father was a Death Eater only because he didn't know what it meant to be one. When he did understand, he fled and has done nothing but break himself over and over again for the cause of the Light. My father saw first hand what would happen to a world under the hands of Death Eaters and he is now dedicated, heart and soul, to standing against that. He's a hero in his own right and I'm sick of you all looking down on him because of your hateful bigotry!"
"You're right. We apologize," Draco said smoothly. He handed the Animagus his empty plate and bowed gracefully in front of Shadow. "Care to dance?"
A woman's laugh erupted from the Death Eater to the right of Lucius. She reached up and removed her mask, revealing a beautiful face with bright hazel-green eyes. Long golden-brown hair framed her aristocratic features. She looked like Lenora Selwyn, a fourth year Slytherin. If this woman
Harry blushed hotly as he jerked out of Draco's arms. Severus stood over by the kitchen table smirking, his arms crossed over his chest, a single slender eyebrow raised.
Draco lay down. His hand brushed Seraphim's arm accidentally and the alter pulled it away. Draco sighed and closed his eyes. He had no idea how they were going to get Shadow back, but he hoped it was soon. This was likely going to kill him.
Filled with pride fit to bursting, he'd been further impressed when the smaller male had managed to procure them food. He was still not certain how that had been done, but all that mattered was that his mate had provided for them. Now he felt content and lazy, pleased with their fully successful mating. The Beta would forever be marked as Seraphim's; none would dare touch him now. Growling in pleasure, he arched, sliding his still sensitive skin against his naked mate.
"Everyone's going to know Shadow is Harry Potter if we don't hide the lightning bolt scar," Neville fretted.
Severus had to admit, if only to himself, that his son looked quite intimidating, his blue eye, his green, both glowing with an inhumane light as his powerful magic began slashing through the air like razor-sharp blades, but he was also encouraged. If Shadow's response was anger on behalf of Amalia, he was not feeling humiliated or ashamed.
"Seph," Draco said urgently, eyes wide. "Don't hurt him. He doesn't mean it. He's hurt and confused."
Shadow laughed. "I know, isn't it? I didn't expect it, but it's hilarious! I remember when I thought Severus was a vampire myself."
"I've been informed that the examiner who was going to test you tomorrow morning for your Potions OWL had a family crisis, so she will be testing you tonight instead. Five thirty, Potions classroom. Our detention has been rescheduled for tomorrow, same time."
"Child." Firenze bowed so that their faces were close. "Had you not written your father, where would he be?"
Harry's eyes, uncovered by his glasses, went wide, but he didn't move to interrupt. He knew what the ritual entailed; he wasn't surprised. Still, it was hard to watch Severus bleed before him and do nothing.
She lifted the spell book and activated one of the most ancient and revered spells. The words were foreign and beautiful, and at the end of the chant, the two couples gasped as their magic was pulled from them. The two ribbons glowed around their clasped hands. The four stood stiffly, their hair and robes flaring gently as the light sunk into their skin. When the magic faded, the two couples collapsed forward, the only think keeping them from falling was each other.
All evidence of his son was gone, but the dark magic used to kill the two Dursleys still soaked the walls as did the residue of the acute suffering of the victims. It would draw attention very soon, but first… Severus walked out onto the lawn and shot the Dark Mark into the night sky before Dissapparating.
"Dismissed, Mr. Snape.” Umbridge smiled, practically vibrating with victory as the young teen fled her presence.
"I don't really have to go home," Neville said suddenly. "I'm coming with you. I'll go home so no one gets suspicious and I'll meet you there."
After about five minutes, Severus collected himself and stood. "We have a lot of ground to cover. There are forty-seven Wizarding pawnshops in England and Sirius has only checked twelve. I suggest we split up into pairs."
Neville shivered. He looked to the twins for help, but the redheads were staring at Draco, strange looks on their faces. Neville sighed and reached out for his brother's arm. He shook it lightly. "Shadow," he called reprovingly.
"He called Shadow a poof!" Neville cried, jumping to his feet, fists clenched and cheeks red with a mixture of embarrassment and fury.
Now that Severus mentioned it, Harry realized the supposed Order members were using surprisingly vicious and Dark spells. Confused, he loped across the marble chamber, sensuously slipping around the violently dancing mass. He sped up, now almost running, only to find that the battle was even more fierce on the front doorstep.
The sound of talking and chairs scraping as everyone got up to leave filled the room. Shadow watched them go, wondering how many would show up. About twenty-eight students were there now, he hoped at least half would show up on Wednesday. He had no doubt that once the group got underway word would spread and they'd get more members, but they had to have members in the first place in order for that to happen.
Draco nodded, accepting that. At least Shadow was admitting that they needed to talk. "So lets talk about Severus then. I understand he was busy working on your potion, but what's he busy with now? We still see very little of him."
Severus released the goblet and stood solemnly by, his face carefully blank of all expression as his son lifted the potion to his lips.
A man in his thirties or so moved forward to stand behind Tonks. He had short black hair and bright blue eyes. "Mr. Potter. I'm Stephan Pritchard and proudly work under Mrs. Lupin. My son, Graham Pritchard, is a Second-year Slytherin. I wanted you to know how much your return will mean to him and others in Hogwarts. I'm aware that you did not have to come back. Thank you."
"Not really." Neville smiled wryly, self-hate in his eyes. "But I promise not to get upset over this in front of Shadow again. Even if you do k-kiss him. He really did look happy when you were d-dancing."
"I would never reject him!" Neville protested. His shoulders straightened and Draco was not pleased to discover the Gryffindor was two inches taller than him and at least twenty pounds heavier. Of course, that wouldn't matter if their wands got involved. Draco was unquestionably the better dueler.
Demon reached forward, ignoring the blond's flinch, and got a grip on the back of his neck. "Boy," he almost purred, his smile showing teeth. Pulling Draco toward him, he pushed the blond past him to face the man that lay in a crumpled, terrified heap on the floor. From where he stood behind Draco, Demon reached forward to caress Draco's smooth, pale cheek.
And now Draco was lying in front of him. Beautiful, laughing, fierce Draco - the dancer, the dueler, the Seeker, with an obsession with appearance and a fondness for delicacies and fine things - All that was gone, ravished by this deadly curse. His soft blond hair was matted and greasy with sweat, which smelled sweet with sickness. His fair skin, dry and papery, was tinged blue around the lips.
"I'll try," Neville said firmly, purpose burning in his eyes as he nodded firmly. "I'll do anything to help Harry."
Draco shook his head. "I believe I've lost my appetite." He was watching the lynx with a sort of horrified fascination. This was so far from Pureblood manners that it really couldn't compare.
The smile that lit his lover's face made something in Shadow ignite. He growled and thrust upward, drawing both their legs onto the bed and their hips into line. They both gasped. Draco released Shadow's hair and quickly worked on the damn buttons of Shadow's shirt. Shadow returned the favor by undoing Draco's.
Neville scrambled into a sitting position, pushing at the debris that had fallen all around him. The ceiling had collapsed, opening the house to the outside. Behind him, he could see people slowly beginning to stand, escaping more rubble. His eyes went wide as he recognized a man with grey-streaked hair.
"There is always the death penalty. If I'm dead, Voldemort can't get a hold of me and the danger I pose to everyone will be eliminated. But then I'd be dooming everyone to a world of darkness and despair because -
"I don't know where to look for the Horcruxes," Shadow admitted, feeling himself flush with shame, but also anger. "I can't do this by myself. I need help. You said you went against your herd to help me."
Severus took a step forward, but the teen's whole body tensed and he raised his fists before him in warning. Severus paused and considered his next move. The fact that this Seraphim alter had pulled him from the veil, possibly permanently expending all his massive amounts of magic to do so, made him feel oddly indebted, but he also wanted Shadow back with him. Severus forced himself to concentrate, finding it surprisingly hard to do so, and tried to reach his son with his mind.
Roaring in fury, the Black lashed forward like a hundred swords. The alpha exploded in hot fresh blood. Large chunks of sick-flesh rained to the floor. Exulted, victorious, he kicked the head of the alpha away with a triumphant howl. He had bested the alpha! He was Alpha of all alphas! Pleasure-growling, wings flared gloriously, he turned toward the fledgling. She was pressed into the corner. Her terror-scent was so strong now that he almost choked on it.
Having three leaders to double check the others would hopefully prevent corruption like Dumbledore’s, and three leaders should insure at least one person would always be available to make decisions. Kingsley Shacklebolt, an Auror, and Minerva McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, were elected as two of the three. The third to complete the Triad was surprisingly Bill Weasley, Curse Breaker, and only he would be devoted to the Order full-time.
Shadow watched as fifty-two names were put on paper. (Slytherin was always the smallest House.) Once done, Draco started from the top starring, checking, and underlining almost every single name except for a small majority that Draco was unsure about.
"Draco, Nev, would you excuse us?" Shadow asked calmly, standing as the last of the plates were vanished from the table. "I have a few things I'd like to discuss with our teachers."
Tabitha was born in the game room, of all places. Amalia was playing the evasion game when her water broke. Omi fetched Severus who fetched the medi-wizard. Tabitha was born twenty minutes later. She was a long, thin baby, was red and blotchy, and she screamed for hours until she finally fell asleep.
The creature let out a piercing howl as it leapt forward and tackled Draco to the floor. The deadly spell struck the demon in the back, but it was merely swallowed by shadow. Lucius spun and ran for the opening behind the witch. Knott was holding it open, screaming for him to hurry. Lucius dove for passage and kicked out, sending Knott sprawling forward.
"Amalia worked for the ministry. She was a Law Wizard and she supported my case. It was through her meticulous efforts and Dumbledore's influence that I didn't end up in Azkaban for longer than the few months I was incarcerated there. I often called her insane because she never left me alone, even when her responsibility was finished. She would answer that it wasn't mad to care for someone.
The tape clicked off, coming to its end. Fred and George stared at each other. Both of them were thinking of the details they had read off that stats page posted on the wall in the strategy room. The sheer level of Dark magic the creature left in its wake, the way the creature mutilated and tortured the people in the hospital ward, the way it effortlessly and wandlessly struck down two people with Killing Curses; none of it was something to take lightly. This was serious. Very, very serious.
"The feather marks are not similar to the Dark Mark. Rowena agrees. The feathers allow Draco and Marissa to connect to Seraphim whereas the Dark Mark allows the Dark Lord power over the bearer. They are almost opposite in nature. It is within the werewolf's nature to mark their territory. Seraphim thought of it on his own. The Black magic gave him the knowledge to create the magical bonds.
"You can see how rare that would be," Rowena said excitedly, looking back and forth between the two solemn Slytherins. "Usually either one or the other of the two mental and physical states are achieved. Never in history that I'm aware of has a single person been able to access both planes at once, and this child is able to do that. He is very, very special."
Tabby loved to splash in the sink and Amalia would blow bubbles over her stomach just to hear her scream with laughter.
Draco went down hard, but he rolled and jumped right back to his feet. His teeth were bared and shone as lightning flashed above. Severus made a hand gesture. Neville couldn't believe it, but Draco instantly backed down and began hurrying back toward them.
being left behind! Her brothers did that to her all the time. Maybe she could use this room to her advantage. She'd be careful. She just wanted to be a
"No one move!" Lucius bellowed, glaring hatefully at his son. "Especially you, Mrs. Selwyn!" he spat at the smirking woman.
"That is not good news," Charlie murmured gravely. Severus knew plenty. If Voldemort caught wind even of a fraction of Severus's knowledge the Order and Harry both would be at a severe disadvantage.
The two teenagers pumped steadily, their legs in synch. Slowly they began to swing higher and faster. Seraphim griped the chain tightly with his magic, fear in his eyes, but Draco could also see a childlike excitement growing as the falling sensation got stronger and stronger. Soon, they were as high as the swing would let them go and both were grinning ear to ear. Draco whooped and laughed out loud, suddenly struck with the memory of flying in the snow with Shadow. He looked over at Seraphim and found the alter huffing, emerald eyes twinkling with pure joy. It was a beautiful sight.
Neville looked up at Draco. His brown eyes were bloodshot, but his hands stopped shaking as he realized that Draco truly did understand. He nodded. "I'm sorry," he said softly but firmly. "I didn't realize. Of course I'll help you. I never meant to make Shadow feel like that. It isn't true. He's
His thoughts cleared when Harry got out of bed. It was in his posture, the defeated way he hung his head so that his curls hid his face and the way his shoulders were hunched in. What his brother said finally sunk in. "Wait!… What do you mean? Harry, I don't care that you stayed in here."
Shadow snorted. He could see Draco's smug smile now at being described as incorruptible. And it was true in many ways. Lucius had tried very hard to mold his son in his own image, but Draco would never be anyone but himself.
Lucius's face was covered with a mask, but Harry could feel his cruel amusement clearly through his empathy and knew he was grinning. "Scared, Potter?" Lucius shook his head. "My Lord would like a private meeting."
Remus straightened his robes and brought his hand up to knock on the heavy door. He waited a minute before Augusta opened it. He smiled at her, hoping she'd let him in. No such luck. She regarded him sternly and didn't move to open the door wider in welcome.
Shadow opened his eyes. "We need to know what's happening out there. We need to know what the Aurors know and if they're after us."
"Shadow… That's a nice name. A good name to hide in; shadows can be very deep.” Luna smiled sweetly and ducked behind her magazine again.
"It is a good form," Remus contradicted the snickering teens. "It's small and good for spying. It also attests to a strong personality."
"I won't let that happen," Neville said fiercely. "I haven't been doing my part to help you, but I will now. I'll find a way to keep this Seraphim from hurting others. You aren't alone, Shadow!"
"Are you going to tell the Order?" George asked worriedly. "Because we know there's a good portion that wants to kill Shadow. Just because Moody's gone doesn't mean they don't still feel that way."
Remus wore thread-bare brown pants and an off-white button-up shirt. His legs were crossed defensively and his hands were clenched on his knee. His graying hair was pulled back in a low, short ponytail and his face was severely lined with stress and fatigue. The full moon was this week, and the deeper color of his amber made sure no one forgot it.
"Sir!" George said quickly, backing up, but he didn't have to say anything else as Boy's terrified scream and the scent of sour urine filled the air.
The witch chuckled, her voice raspy. She placed her long fingered hands with curling nails flat on the table as she leaned forward. "Such a modest, little man. Don't be afraid," she cooed. "Marigold'll take good care of you."
Severus was deeply uncomfortable, but he knew how important it was to make this clear. His lank hair fell around his face as he looked down at his traumatized son. “There's nothing wrong with Draco falling in love with you, Shadow. It's hardly surprising, though you may not see it now. You are an incredible person. You deserve love, and I can see that he truly does loves you."
"Come on," he said gently, his breath ghosting over Shadow's lips. "We're just tired. Let's get some sleep."
"I've devised a potion that will return your genetic structure to what it was before the adoption by suppressing my genetics. It lasts a duration of twelve hours before wearing off and will be completely undetectable by any diagnostic spells."
"So what happened, ey, boy?" the old man cut in, practically yelling. "Captured by them Death Munchers, ey?"
"We have done nothing wrong," Augusta stated and stepped between her grandson and the Auror’s line of sight. "Shadow was up in Neville's room for about ten minutes before he came down. He was agitated and I had Neville write Professor Snape to come fetch his son. When the Professor arrived, I questioned him. He didn't answer my questions and took his son and left. We did not see how they traveled and we do not know where they went."
"Like an overload," the twin answered softly, defeated. At least they had managed to keep Shadow's lynx Animagus form secret. "It was too much. Everything whited out and then I was on my hands and knees and nothing hurt. I tingled all over, but it wasn't a bad feeling exactly. Just overwhelming."
Gently, lovingly, he brushed Shadow's curls away from his face and whispered softly, "Sweet dreams."
Draco rolled backward over the arm of his chair and out of the path of the red streak of light. Then they were running and dodging among the Chamber's pillars, spells zipping and splashing around them.
"Don't forget you're a Slytherin," Draco added. He sat on the bed next to his friend and placed his hand on his back. "The world better watch out, remember?"
Shadow took them to a day-spa. They got there just before it closed and with some shameless flirting on Sirius's part, they got a quick session with some tanning lotion and the tanning beds. After an hour, they came out a few degrees darker. A spray-on-tan added by a professional finished the job, giving them a healthy almond color that was far from the pale white that was natural for all four of them.
"Neville. Maybe you're right. We'll never know," Charlie interrupted, talking loudly over the teen's heavy breathing and loud sobs. Remus was practically curled around him, rocking him back and forth. "Did he ever ask you about Harry? Did you talk to him?"
safe? Another pack was coming after them? He didn't know what to do and that terrified him. Hyperventilating, he backed to the door, shaking his head mutely.
"If the locket was there, it isn't now," he reported and reached for the papers in his coat. "And it gets worse. I didn't want to tell you in a letter but here."
Face twisted in rage and despair at never being done, Seraphim very reluctantly listened to the not-boy. He cut his thumb on debris, hissing at the sting, and spread it on the ring.
Shadow sighed and relaxed. "I did see her expression after she ran my physical, and then Remus took her aside and talked to her privately afterward. So I guess I did know."
Remus frowned deeply. "It's not anything I'd like to go through again. It was like watching a short, thick worm move under Shadow's skin from his head to his chest."
Shadow hummed thoughtfully, enjoying the man's utter submission. "Perhaps I should take things into my own hands," he said with a dark and sadistic smile. "Our other preparations are almost finished. I am ready to step into the world once more."
Luna watched Lady Longbottom storm upstairs, presumably to her bedroom, after Professor Snape and Shadow took their leave. She was just settling on the couch when she heard a door creek softly open. She watched the stairs attentively and sure enough Neville came creeping quietly down them.
"Magic's back," Seraphim confirmed, hoping the blond would be reassured. He could protect them again.
McGonagall stared stonily at the witch sitting across her desk. The edict from the Ministry lay under her tightly clasped hands. "Regardless of Minister Fudge's certainty of your competency, what experience do you have to suggest you would fulfill the post of Potion's instructor. I am not aware that you achieved a Masters in the art."
Looking for support, Shadow glanced at his father and smiled when he saw the man's consternation. It seemed true that pain shared was pain halved. Resigned, father and son entered the store. Draco led them unerringly to all the right departments. Marissa followed in his wake, helping him pick out colors and styles of shirts and pants. Shadow and Severus followed, surprised despite themselves.
"Yes, Professor," Shadow agreed, his heart pounding. He could only think of one reason why Sirius would need to speak to him.
He'd had enough! Neville had been avoiding him all week. After the shy Gryffindor had asked if Shadow was okay when they had run into each other in the halls on Monday, his brother had been conspicuously absent. Shadow hadn't even seen him at meals. In Transfiguration, Neville was the last to arrive and the first to leave.
Within minutes, he was panting at the blond's door. It was locked. Furious, Shadow flung his magic forward and the door blew almost off its hinges. Nothing was going to stop him. He was so focused on the target of his ire, Shadow barely noticed the state of the room as he marched forward.
Shadow realized that even Sirius seemed solemn and in agreement. Sighing, he backed down. "Fine, but I'm not saying that ridiculous You-Know-Who crap. I'll call him Tom from now on."
That was it. Neville completely crumpled, falling into Remus' arms. He began to sob and hyperventilate at the same time, his hands clutching painfully at Remus' shirt. In less than half a minute, he fainted. Remus cast a levitation charm on him and looked to Severus with strained, worried eyes.
"That is appreciated, Minerva.” He moved curiously to the next door. It opened into a room identical to Shadow's except the walls were dark blue and the bed was Slytherin green. He quirked his lips at his colleague, making Minerva laughed.
The bruises around Draco’s eyes had deepened even as he lay senseless from powerful pain-relieving potions. Despite them, deep wrinkles still creased Draco's forehead, attesting to the acute pain he felt in every joint. Bloody towels lay abandoned beside Shadow's chair from the many nosebleeds he'd tried to staunch, since magic didn't seem to work on them any longer.
Severus was amazed that Shadow was saying so much, but listened intently to his son. He could feel a huge
"Isn't it amazing? These were top of the line sixty years ago.” She grinned as she handed it over. "I found them yesterday, but I wasn't sure if I was allowed to take them, so I put them back. What do you think? Should I keep them?"
There was a slight pause and then Moody said in a low, grim voice. "I think Malfoy knew the creature somehow. Why else protect it?"
"I recalled the Pensieve sessions," he reassured his agitated son. "Dumbledore told you it was important that you remember the Dark Lord liked to keep trophies. I assumed that was a hint about what he would later show you. Then he concentrated on showing you Merope selling Slytherin's locket and emphasized the Gaunt ring. I put them on the list and Black finally found one, but it is good to confirm that Nagini is a Horcrux."
"I'm sure not," Severus drawled. "You were in Gryffindor mode and wanted to take all the risks yourself."
Shadow pushed open her office door and stepped into the room. The floor was carpeted in a rich, red-wine color. The walls were painted white, on which hung dozens of moving and mewing framed pictures of kittens. There was a love seat - white with a rose pattern - in front of the elaborate and heavy wooden desk. A floor lamp with a lacy cover stood to the side. The desk itself had dollies and delicate china tea cups. Overall, the room was hideous.
Draco and Shadow stood grimly silent. They'd wondered what Carrow was doing. They knew it was bad, but this was truly awful. She was addicting minors and forcing them to crave a power that could easily slip out of control. Marissa, feeling the tension, came over and pressed herself into Draco's legs.
"But Malfoy's just tricking you! No way would he go against his Death Eater father! Neither would Nott Jr. or any of them!" Ron argued back. He was honestly worried about his friend. He didn't want him to get hurt. "They've already tried to kill you once with that cursed necklace thing that got Katie! Have you forgotten about that? They almost
"I'm also surprised at how many people don't believe Tom's back. They need to be told. How else are they going to protect themselves and prepare?"
Shadow stood and frowned down at himself. His jeans were too short and a bit looser than he remembered. His shirt was the same. Lifting his hands, he stared at the pale skin. He knew what he was going to feel, but he lifted his hand to his hair anyway. He was unsurprised to feel the soft curls. He spun around to face his father. Without glasses, he could see the man's neutral expression clearly.
"Yeah, right," Shadow sneered. He sighed and looked down at the table. At his hands. At the wood. None of it was helping him. He looked up at the phantom. "Fine. But only when I'm asleep. And if I say no more, then you stop and you don't come back again unless summoned."
Without hesitation, he opened the trunk, grabbed a fang, and set the diadem on the lid. He felt darkness pull at his senses, felt the semi-sentience scratch at his mental walls. Harry narrowed his eyes and slammed his arm down, piercing the Horcrux like butter. A shrill scream sounded, forcing Harry to cover his ears and stagger away. He quickly regained his footing and kicked out, sending the remains of the diadem sliding across the floor.
It was as if Demon were riding him, wrapped around his shoulders, his clawed fingers gripping his hair, but the alter wasn't trying to come Out. He was merely sharing the rage, communing with Shadow, whispering to him like he constantly whispered to Boy. In that moment, Shadow saw how Boy and Demon were two different faces of the same entity. Demon was aware of all of Boy's sufferings because he was the pure rage produced by them.
They knelt there for an eternity. Their knees grew numb, then their legs, but neither of them moved. Shadow never stopped humming. Eventually Draco ran out of energy, if not emotion, and he fell silent. Shadow allowed his song to come to an end and Draco shivered as he felt dry lips brush his temple.
"I know." Draco forced Shadow to turn from the mirror. "Look at me. It wasn't your fault. You couldn't control what Demon did. You were not responsible."
By the time he was back in the Chamber, his outrage had turned into something harder, colder. With utter certainty, he knew Umbridge and the Carrows wouldn't survive this war. He'd see to it. He pushed aside his new determination as he reached the side passage. The door swung open and Draco felt a grin stretch his face. When Godric had alerted him to his love's arrival, he hadn't really believed it.
"I'm sorry," Draco said quickly, hoping to stave off another round of hysterics. "It's okay. I won't touch you. I'm sorry."
"That's probably for the best," Draco said softly, eyes on the very tense Shadow. "Seraphim probably wouldn't appreciate you hanging around. He doesn't trust people very easily."
"Harry? Are you all right?" Neville flushed. It was a very stupid question. How could Harry be okay after all this?
The lynx snorted. Its tail lashing with humor as the white peacock's tail rose in a gorgeous display; its delicate neck preening. The flock gurgled and shifted around the new male, giving him space and ignoring the recipient of the display. The back door to the manor opened, spilling a golden square of light out into the garden.
The teen blinked his green eyes but didn't respond. Severus took a chance and moved a half-step closer. Seraphim growled again and the knife lifted higher. Severus stopped and just regarded the boy. He was obviously ill, weak, and needed care. He couldn't imagine how hard this journey had been for him. He
Severus leaned back and regarded his son through expressionless eyes. He had considered the matter very thoroughly and the scenario he had told Minerva was the best way to go, but he was concerned. Would Shadow want to be the child of such a union, no matter how the story ended? Would it further damage Shadow’s fragile self-image to be forced to adopt such history? Severus certainly wished he could give his son a better beginning, but he saw little else he could do.
She leaned into the gesture, her eyes a bright blue. "I'm perfect. The Minister contacted Minerva last night. He's passing us the most urgent DE sightings so we can help take the burden off the Aurors. We busted two DE's this morning hustling a shopkeeper. Dropped them trussed up at the Ministry's doorstep. The Aurors were pleased."
"It is," Severus agreed and stood. He made his way to his couch and Shadow followed. With a flick of the Potion Master's wand, a fire started and cackled merrily. It was still the tail end of summer, but the dungeons always got a little chilly at night.
Neville frowned and regarded her suspiciously. "Do you know who's been watching me? What do they want?"
"Well, the only classes left that might be useful are Transfiguration, Astronomy, and Herbology. What do you suggest?"
Shadow wanted to protest, but that made sense. Since he'd marked Draco and Marissa with the mysterious feather tattoo, he was afraid his connection to Voldemort wasn't as severed as he'd thought. Reluctantly, he nodded. "Do it quick."
"Yeah." She took his hand and stood on tip-toe to kiss his cheek, covering the spot Luna had just touched. "They fixed me yesterday. Things are getting pretty intense there and, well, Mum didn't want the kids around so we all went to see friends. When I got to your house, your grandmother said you came here."
"It's a good thing you didn't," Shadow shook his head as Draco accepted the exuberant hug from the little girl. "It wasn't anything she needed to see. I'm glad you stayed with her."
All the Weasley children - except for Percy, who was still working at the Ministry and didn't approve of his family supporting the Order - filled the table with chatter. Everyone ate at record speeds, eager to get going.
Draco blinked at that. He was skilled, yes, but when it came to sheer magical strength he was pretty sure Remus bested him by a fair margin. After all, Draco hadn't gone through his majority yet. His magic was still growing.
"We can't exactly free Minerva without making the Order look even more guilty. Not to mention it would be very difficult and most probably cost us a good number of our members. As for Hogwarts, there's nothing we can do. It's locked down. Even if we could break the wards, which I don't think we can, we shouldn't. It would render the school vulnerable to the Dark Lord."
Severus came into the room a moment later, looking to see why Draco hadn't returned. His heart ached at the state his son was in, but he wisely ignored it and got Neville sitting up. It took some coaxing, but he eventually had the Gryffindor standing and moving under his own power to the kitchen.
They walked through the rooms slowly, pretending like they were stalking prey. Sirius had taught Marissa this game and she insisted Draco play with her. Shrugging, the blond crouched and pretended to hunt for Shadow, smiling when Marissa giggled. They moved cautiously until all the rooms were searched. No Shadow. Draco was beginning to worry that his best friend had disappeared again when they entered the main hall where the basilisk remains rested. Shadow was bent over the corpse, working mechanically, his expression distant.
