Harry snorts. “He sends me an invite every month as well. Doesn’t mean I have any interest in going.”
Outrageously, unfairly good.
It ends as quickly and surprisingly as it began. Potter pulls back with a gasp, staggering a step backwards into the street. His lips are bright red and his eyes are flashing. The thundercloud is in full effect. Draco almost feels like he can
Malfoy sits on a bench opposite the shop. Harry watches the way his knee bounces with pent-up frustration, his hands twisting in his lap. He looks up at Harry and reaches out for the pile of photos again. Harry gives them to him and Malfoy begins to look closely at each one, studying them in turn.
“Close the door on your way out.”
for the evening. Malfoy arches an eyebrow at him with a smile, like he’s waiting expectantly for something. Harry racks his brains trying to think what. An apology? An explanation?
He certainly tried to convince Draco that an evening of marshmallows and making out was only a precursor to a great deal more fun they
“For a second, back there with the plant, I thought you’d —”
Draco sinks back in his chair, confused. “Pardon?”
“Yes, yes. Arrest me. You can do that later, I promise.” He pushes past Harry to the door. Harry sighs. They always make a break for it.
Harry is suddenly aware of the sound of his own heart beating, hard and fast, and of the faces of those around him — Neville, pale and slack jawed. Hermione paralysed with shock. Luna’s eyes filling with tears. Even the Slytherins are frozen, transfixed by the horror of the scene unfolding before them.
“Quidditch?”
Harry lifts his head out of the Pensieve, frustrated.
Belle’s room is occupied when he arrives. Melinda and another Trainee are pulling up fresh sheets and carefully levitating Belle back into bed. Harry is about to go in when he something makes him pause.
A wizarding club, then. Interesting. Draco’s been to ones in Paris and Berlin, of course. But London? Are there even any in London?
“Lost my appetite,” Harry says. Ron nods grimly, and Harry takes that as his cue to leave before he can get drawn any further into Hermione and Luna’s argument, or the others’ determined efforts to drink it all away.
“Don’t
“I’ll leave you two to get reacquainted.”
and other bits of paperwork on one end of the table, and he sets to sending that towards the rubbish as well when he realises that the top of the pile is the folder Hermione left behind.
Harry takes an experimental step forward and finds he can move again. “Luna, cast your lights!”
Harry wonders why coming back is so important to Malfoy, but he suspects he understands on some level. If something forced Harry away from England he’d fight tooth and nail to come back. And Malfoy’s even more proud than he is.
“Usually, though, people really appreciate it. That you’re living right. That you’re trying to set things right.” He gets up, taking their cups to the sink and rinsing them. “I’ll see you on Monday,” he says, giving Draco a gentle clap on the back as he heads out the kitchen door to his van.
“I’ve decided all the houses are equally good,” Teddy concludes, tugging his robe out of Draco’s grasp. “It doesn’t matter if I’m a Gryffindor like Harry, or a Slytherin like you, or a Ravenclaw like Luna, or a Hufflepuff like my mum.”
Finally, Teddy turns to Draco.
It isn’t that she’s wrong, exactly, but it dawns on him that he can’t work out when all of the important parts of his life crossed the Atlantic, seemingly without him noticing. It feels unsettling. Like he’s the half-repaired bits of Potter Cottage, still with a gaping hole in the roof. Improving incrementally in little fits and starts.
“But you said you didn’t see anybody!” Ron sounds exasperated now.
As they gather around her, the entrance to the tunnel becomes clear. As does the small sign reading
Andromeda turns her teacup around and around in her hand, as if she’s trying to decide what to say.
before Pansy can snatch it out of his grasp.
“You can’t exactly describe it as barbaric, Hermione. It’s just magic,” Ginny says with a shrug. “I like the idea of going for a bit of a hike in the fresh air and throwing a few harmless spells around.”
Downstairs, Harry is surprised to find Hermione sitting at the dining table, a scattering of books and papers around her.
“Do something about it, Draco,” she chides. “You’re becoming unbearable. You can’t let this go on.”
“Let’s go into the house,” Draco breaks the silence. “Leave the staff to clean up.”
“What do you mean?”
“There’s a pond near the Burrow, and I have skates I borrowed from the Weasleys. It’s an hour out of your day, maximum. And you get to prove your theory right about the calendar. Surely you can turn that into some dusty journal article afterwards. It’s a win-win.”
Draco watches as Potter hovers low alongside Teddy, correcting his grip and his lean. Then he shows him how to put more weight into his footrests to shift his balance. Teddy listens, rapt.
Hannah is the strongest swimmer even without any magical enhancements and so she takes the lead. Harry feels a gentle tug on the rope in his hand and kicks off to follow.
“I couldn’t believe you’d survived. That you’d finally managed to put a stop to it all. I was so bloody grateful for you. I hated you so much and at the same time I was so
, not December!"
“It’s possible the pictures aren’t faked,” Hermione says thoughtfully, picking up one in which photo-Harry is smacking a kiss to an irritated-looking Malfoy’s cheek.
It’s true that Malfoy hasn’t exactly been swanning around this weekend like one of the family peacocks, preening over his wealth and opulent surroundings — the way he might have done when they were at school. If anything, he’s seemed as trapped here as the rest of them. Weighed down under an unbearable sense of duty and family expectation. Living in the shadow of an erratic and cruel patriarch.
Andromeda gives a sad nod, as if this is to be expected.
Draco flushes. “I overheard Granger and Weasley last night. Weasley suggested they conjure you a cake and got an absolute earful about wasting war rations and Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration.”
“It’s
Harry wants to find the words to ask him to stay, but he pauses too long and the Floo roars and then it’s just him, staring at tiny Muggle pictures of a Draco Malfoy he fell in love with and now doesn’t even know.
“Somewhere wizards will feel comfortable, but somewhere that’s undeniably Muggle.”
“Of course I didn’t,” Malfoy scoffs, still looking irate. “Show me this notice.”
Draco is shaking uncontrollably, and there’s just so much blood, soaking through the thin cotton of his school shirt and spreading in the water underneath him. It’s a horrible, vibrant red, so much worse than he remembers.
before now. As far as Harry knows, no one has seen Malfoy since the war. How has Hermione even
“Suit yourself,” she says happily. “I have rounds.” She drifts off in the direction of the general wards, her voice lifting up again in song. “
“A training camp, of sorts,” Harry answers gamely, hoping that if he professes it with enough confidence, the squad will believe him. “We’re going to embed ourselves with Malfoy’s team in Prague. Learn more about new Quidditch firsthand, from the experts.”
“Us,” Draco snorts, clearly still furious. “There is no
Cassie rubs against his knee. She’s hungry, he thinks. He’ll buy extra food to leave with the neighbours in the morning.
“Happy birthday.”
“These must have been expensive,” Neville whistles, as they sit down, enjoying the heated charms and plush cushioning.
“You’ve done extremely well, boys. Everything I wanted from you.”
She means it as a joke, grinning broadly at him, but it makes Harry feel even worse. That was six months’ ago.
Harry and Ginny’s relationship had fallen apart long before Harry realised he preferred wizards to witches. She’d dealt with her post-war grief by becoming an absolute tornado of activity, returning to Hogwarts primarily just to play Quidditch. She practised every hour of available daylight, and eventually trialled and became one of the youngest professional players to be drafted by the Harpies.
. That sort of thing.”
But Harry keeps going, the words tumbling out. “I blundered along, everyone else thinking I had some grand destiny — that I was
Ron makes a strangled noise of disbelief, prompting his partner to elbow him as she reaches for a jug of juice.
It’s been a long, disastrous sort of day, and Harry’s cheered to come home to his tree. He remembers the calendar picture that Rose had revealed, and digs around in his Christmas shopping bags for the candles he’d purchased. Sure enough, when he lights a couple on the windowsill, the seventh door glows contentedly. Behind door nine, he finds a picture of a Christmas cracker. Something he hasn’t bought yet and definitely needs to. It can go on the list for when he stocks up on the groceries at the weekend. It’s not that he doesn’t trust Kreacher, but the elf’s cooking can go astray, and it won’t hurt to have a few back-ups in the pantry.
of them walking from there. There’s no reason for them to suspect everyone will pop away magically, leaving their galleons in the silver bowl of his mother’s edged with runes, sitting beside the storage cabinet where they will retrieve their wands.
The light through the tall windows is still bright, the summer evening warm outside, and Harry moves across the room to let in some fresh air. The room feels stale. Hermione is sitting cross-legged on the floor, maps and plans fanned out around her, chewing on a quill. He wonders if she’s been there all day. It’s only been six weeks, but Harry almost can’t imagine his library without Hermione camped out in it. In the beginning, she just popped over to dig around for books in the old Black collection. But it progressed to being a much better meeting place for them all, given the unplottable location. Now she’s a semi-permanent fixture.
, Draco thinks.
Luna toys with one of her wide earrings. “Gingko biloba,” she says. “Extremely good for cognitive function.”
It’s too good to be true. The idea of the Arrows being owned by the Appleby community. Able to be exactly the kind of club they want to be, heading into a new season as a top tier team who’ll be able to attract sponsors and advertisers. Harry feels as overwhelmed as he had been at the final whistle, his throat tight and tears pricking hotly at his eyes.
,” Rowena says, her voice echoing off the walls, and Harry feels the room shudder again, stone groaning and shifting.
“Are you wearing leaves in your ears?” Malfoy says, puzzled.
Ron looks around at all of them. “Reckon you do.” He pauses, taking in Harry and Draco’s joined hands and gives Harry an exasperated roll of his eyes while grinning. “Reckon we could all do with a bit more talking in general.”
Mostly, he’s fine.
“Pans—”
,” he growls, in a voice far too old for his young body, and with a wave of his wand casts Draco straight out of the dream.
“Worried wizarding Britain isn’t big enough for both of us?” Draco asks, arching an eyebrow at him.
Harry decides to fly another couple of circuits while he has the stadium to himself. He circles the hoops and leans hard into a turn, diving towards the ground and feeling the ache and strain in his legs and arms as he pulls out of the manoeuvre safely and soars back into the air. It feels amazing.
, Harry thinks.
The path they follow is crowded with trees and bushes, completely overgrown. Ron leads, taking out his continued frustration at the whole Malfoy situation on errant branches with snappish wand movements.
It’s a trap. He senses it immediately, but he’s not sure how to get out of it.
His wrist burns. A sob escapes his throat.
Harry’s reshuffling the pile of post to get to the last one when his blood runs cold. The final envelope isn’t addressed to him at all. It’s addressed to Draco Malfoy.
“Too far, huh?” he asks gently, and Harry’s acutely aware of the way his exhausted muscles are trembling, as Draco guides them both in to land.
it quickly and sends it back to the tree.
He nods, but of course he won’t be. He’s already planning to call Hannah the second he leaves here and tell her he can’t make it. Mother has a collection of Portkeys at the Manor that are already set for the house in Provence. He can be there in a couple of hours, enough time for an elf to open up some of the rooms. There’s no way in fucking hell he’s going to sit around waiting for whatever scraps Harry bloody Potter wants to throw his way.
Harry steels himself for the inevitable dressing-down he’s about to receive. A venomous rant about proper time-keeping, and dining rooms being for dining, and toast being plebeian anyway, and whatever else Malfoy’s winding up to send his way.  But instead, Malfoy just gives him a long unreadable stare, and then turns to Sato and asks her to continue. The pair of them walk away briskly, leaving Harry behind in a confused cloud of expensive-smelling cologne.
“The Manor was like that?” Harry sounds curious now, rather than full of judgement.
Harry can’t really answer that. Being in this house is so surreal that it seems to have tipped over into not really that upsetting. It’s macabre, certainly, but he’s not haunted by flashbacks or anything. He’s surprised by the strength of Neville’s reaction though he supposes everyone carries their memories of the war in different ways.
Back on his side of the hearth, Harry retrieves his stocking from the carton and hangs it from the mantle. Much like the very first Christmas sweater Molly ever knitted him, this slightly-misshapen quilted stocking fills him with a warm sense of belonging. And now, seeing it hang in his own house, a fresh sense of determination.
“It happened in a barn, Potter. There’s always a chicken somewhere.”
“What?”
“Red will be fine,” Potter laughs, seeming just as surprised as Draco.
Ron sighs in frustration. “Start again. Let’s be abundantly clear, on the basis that I am not, and have never been, shagging Pansy Parkinson. What time was this?”
She’s clearly exhausted and flustered. It’s not a good look on her and it makes Draco uncomfortable.
Cassie next turns to Ron.
“How nice of you to come back, Mudblood,” Bellatrix croons, sauntering towards Hermione, who seems frozen in place.
Before Ron can say anything, she turns and flings the library doors open, striding through and leaving the rest of them in her wake.
He brings his full attention back to the spell and can feel the impact the castle is having on the others. Luna is managing to hold her corner steady but both Hannah and Draco are having trouble. Harry pushes the edges of his magic out to the left and right, trying to bolster the places where they’re struggling, weaving his power into the gaps in their own.
Malfoy doesn’t move, fixing him with a cold stare, and not lowering his wand an inch.
Harry waves a hand impatiently. “No, I know. Why the fuck would you go?”
“How big?”
“Right now the rings are just rings. They’re in a kind of stasis, I guess, is the best way to describe it. They can’t hurt anybody, but they also can’t do anything. They’re about as powerful as a plastic ring from a Christmas cracker.”
serious. That blasted calendar proves it. It was only interested when I was doing things with someone I cared about. But I don’t want either of our jobs to be on the line, or for us to be sneaking around snogging in broom closets. I want this to be … official.”
Neville laughs. “Are you serious? You know what he gets like.” Then he pauses for a long moment, considering Harry closely. “Or, maybe you don’t. Harry, this research is his life’s work. He absolutely disappears into it. He once burnt a hole in his hand when a ring imploded on him. He had to spend a week in Mungo’s when something went wrong and he exhausted his magical core trying to fix my parents’ ones.”
. I was so lost, and so
“What do you want?” he manages. It seems unlikely that Weasley’s going to pull a wand while carrying a child, but one never really knows.
Malfoy draws back to look at Harry with a small, self-conscious smile. “Indeed. Much better restaurants.”
Neville frowns and laughs at the same time. “Your birthday party? The one you invited us all to, with actual hand-written invites and all. Very unlike you, really.”
And then it’s just the two of them, looking at each other cautiously.
Luna greets both Harry and Malfoy warmly, something that produces a slightly exasperated noise from Ron.
Draco usually keeps to himself on the weekends when there isn’t a game, so Harry’s surprised to find him leaning against a scoreboard watching Harry coach MiniQuidditch on Saturday morning, chatting to Hermione of all people. Harry’s been at it for about an hour, cheering the children on their little training brooms, flying back and forth a few feet off the ground. He’s freshly invested in it now that he’s flying at about the same level as his young charges, including Rose. He has no idea how long Draco’s been standing there and feels self-conscious again. Hermione watching is one thing, Draco watching is something else altogether.
The Aurors detained the startled wizard who had been manning the stall, interrogating him as if he’d been trying to start the Third Wizarding War rather than flogging some warmed over nuts. Then the investigation moved out to all of the other vendors, and the well-meaning witch who’d organised the Christmas market in the first place, and then everyone who’d purchased anything that day. Harry kept insisting it must have been a curse, but his protests fell on deaf ears in the wake of Malfoy’s efforts.
, he corrects himself. He’s spent weeks with Teddy teasing him about using the wrong words for things. Now he’s going to have to switch back. He shakes his head. It doesn’t help to think about his godson.
Instead, he steps aside as Ron pushes forwards, then stops, staring down at the body.
Malfoy arches an eyebrow at him. “My subscription must have gotten lost in the intercontinental mail.”
“And, yes — he was very mean with it,” Luna goes on. “Hateful to both Draco and his mother. Accusing them of not supporting him enough in the past, and not being committed enough to his beliefs about what might be coming in the future.”
Harry glances again at a small tendril of smoke snaking up from one of the burnt-out orbs and casts a quick fire-suppression spell over the whole thing to be safe. Enchanted decorations, he decides firmly, will be nowhere near the top of the list.
“And which would

“Nevermind pictures, trust us it works. We’ll show you.”
“Don’t you
Until now.
“You want to spend your Christmas Eve experimenting with whether our friends get along?” Draco laughed, looping his scarf around his neck. Harry hated how the layers of clothes were going on, and not coming off.
To be honest, Harry wouldn’t have been at all surprised to learn that Santa
“Some of the most beautiful magic I’ve ever seen,” stammered a wide-eyed trainee stumbling out of one of Malfoy’s Basic Curses workshops and running straight into Harry.
“And you know that it’s not something you should be touching.”
Neville frowns. “Forgot to have it? What sort of memory charm is that?”
“I think he feels it’s something he has to do,” Lovegood says, scraping her spoon noisily across the bottom of her bowl. “I see him an awful lot when he’s injured. Harry has a strong sense of duty.”
“A bit like
“Draco Malfoy!” he crows with a smug grin, looking unbearably pleased with himself. “Imagine seeing you here, on a Wednesday at this bar, where you apparently always are on Wednesday evenings.” His eyes are an unreasonably vivid green behind his glasses. Draco hates himself a little bit for noticing.
“That’s Passover,” he muses, dumping the last of the files he’s collected back on his desk and backing away from them carefully, hands out in front of himself to catch any that threaten to slide again. “Not Christmas.”
“Well, you’ll sleep better in your own bed.” Neville sounds reassuring, although Harry thinks he might be overselling the comforts of the hospital wing.
Harry wants to object strongly to that characterisation coming from Parkinson, of all people. The irony is outrageous. But he’s brought up short by the realisation that she must know — that Malfoy must have told her. He wonders how much she’s been told — and whether Zabini and the others are also in possession of the same information. Whatever it is, the look that Parkinson gives him tells him she fully intends to use it to make his situation more awkward.
The next day, a weak late-winter sun appears for what feels like the first time since Harry arrived in London.
Sundays are when Teddy comes to stay, and some weeks, Andromeda just sends him through the Floo on his own after dinner, his backpack for school on and usually midway through a long tale about the cartoon he’s been watching or the latest level on the video game he’s obsessed with. Other times, Draco goes to Grimmauld Place to have dinner with them both first. When he examines the contents of his pantry that afternoon, he decides today is one of those days.
The lightning arcs across the sky above them, flashing bright across the Hall and bouncing off the millions of shards of glass. A horrible cracking sound snaps through the silence and Harry hears a scream behind him. He can’t look though, starting to rush toward Ron as he sees the shattered wood of the poles that carry the house banners break off and start to fall. His momentum is abruptly stalled as someone grabs him from behind, yanking him bodily backwards and out of the way of a giant chunk of falling masonry. The stone disintegrates at his feet and Harry gasps, realising that somehow Malfoy has just appeared out of nowhere and saved his life. But he doesn’t get more than a split-second to think about it as he’s forced to watch the broken pole knock Ron from the table and into the mounds of glass.
“You will turn out some very blonde children,” Parkinson muses, eyeing Luna carefully, her head tilted to one side as if she’s trying to solve a particularly complex puzzle.
He’s not sure how long he’s been slumped there, replaying the events of the last few days, when he hears Ron through the Floo.
“Any questions?”
Harry nods absently. His nervous energy has returned in spades.
Harry expects Draco to get annoyed, but it’s as if he’s pleased to find someone finally really appreciating his specialist expertise, patiently explaining everything in more detail than he’s ever done for Harry, and practically basking in the attention. By the time the final whistle goes,
truth, at the very least. He swigs back the last of his drink, slamming his glass a little too firmly down on the table. Everyone looks in his direction.
what to expect,” she says, looking each of them in the eye. “The Room of Requirement has had very little consistently written about it because every witch or wizard’s encounter with it is so different. But it’s my belief that it’s at the very heart of the castle’s magic. Dumbledore always used to say
how he is. Not flat out like this, anyway. Draco is immediately on edge, trying to think about how to divert her.
Malfoy scowls at him. That, at least, is familiar. Harry finds himself almost grateful for it. They clean the room, light the torches in the sconces, and drag in comfier chairs from Pomfrey’s quarters. Neville is just in the process of sorting out food for them all when Hannah announces that she’s finished.
Molly gives a pat on the arm. “Your love life is your own, dear. You don’t need to pretend on my account.”
these! I’m playing at Marcus’s tomorrow and he doesn’t have any of these Saurexes and I am lending him
“Get out.”
Harry frowns. His penmanship could certainly do with some work. But it’s usually just easier to let Hermione write things up. She’s been better at that since they were eleven. It’s not like that’s going to change any time soon.
Draco is still right there, in his personal space. Far too close. Harry can see the bruised circles under his eyes.
“I think, perhaps, we have this under control now,” Obliviator McMichael says, appearing immediately at Harry’s elbow. “I…uh, thank you for your assistance, Auror Potter. But we could do with creating fewer problems we need to clean up.”
The League afterparty is enormous: a tribute to the overwhelming success of the season. The dance floor is packed, and the crowd at the bar several rows deep. Ron and Hermione fight their way through the throngs and return with several bottles of champagne, and they’re both filled with praise and enthusiasm about the game and how well the Arrows played. Harry enjoys several glasses with them before they beg off, needing to relieve Molly from babysitting duty.
Harry’s levity disappears. Draco can see him struggling with the idea.
“Maybe you can borrow one?” she suggests hopefully, which is how Harry comes to be arriving at the Hogwarts gates in his everyday uniform, wearing mismatched gloves, with Robard’s medal pinned to his chest.
Talking to Potter.
“This is family magic,” Malfoy explains. “Designed to encourage lost souls to move on. It’s...
,” Draco interrupts quickly. “When I said she wasn’t with Blaise, I meant Pansy is as heterosexual as I am: by which I mean not at all. She was definitely not with Ron Weasley.”
“The prefects’ bathroom!” Luna points, trying to refasten her hair out of her face. “We can get cleaned up.”
The cottage’s kitchen is bright and airy with big high windows. Potter is at the sink peeling potatoes by hand.
“No.” Just the thought of planning ahead to hook up with Malfoy is ridiculous. Maybe Harry finds himself in Malfoy’s orbit more often than he should, but Harry never intends for it to happen. He just doesn’t seem able to stop.
“Why did you want to come back all of a sudden?”
this, and yet his wand still itches in its holster. He decides the only way to keep from annoying her is to stay busy, and so he braves the crowds in Diagon for the last of his holiday errands.
Hermione and Malfoy exchange an unreadable look, but then he just turns back to them all and nods, arching an eyebrow at Harry as if he’s asking a question. Harry feels the back of his neck heat. He looks away.
There’s a small cracking sound from somewhere on Harry’s right, and he freezes, swivelling slowly. Malfoy emerges from behind a tree, several hundred feet away, wand drawn. He begins to cast, and Harry’s struck again by the beautiful precision of his magic. Just as his

Kreacher glances between them both and at last has the good grace to look a little confused.
should be a suspect.
“Quite the crowd,” he manages, taking a deep swig of his drink.
Luna rounds the bed and sits beside him.
Which is how Draco found himself fidgeting in the passenger seat of a Range Rover three weekends in a row while a Muggle estate agent drove him around the Cotswolds looking at listed heritage buildings, until they pulled into Rotherhithe Farm and he knew immediately that he was on the right track. The agent had rambled on and on about the thirteenth century house and the barons who had owned the place through successive generations. “The first Viscount Harcourt was probably the one who installed the second floor over the great hall,” she said, but Draco wasn’t listening. He was taking in the way the house and its buildings, squat stone tucked into the countryside, felt so similar to a wizarding property and yet didn’t have a trace of magic. It was when she showed him the barns, stone buildings over a thousand years old with heavy, beamed roofs, that he knew this was the place. “They’ve been hosting weddings here,” she said, her heels clacking on the cobbled floor. “But you could turn it into another guest house…or…”
“Hermione?” Hannah’s voice is suddenly very small.
“So he likes Quidditch. It’s not a sign that anything fundamental has changed.”
“Where are you off to now?” she asks as they pay the bill.
“A house as old as Grimmauld will have its own lights,” Malfoy says confidently, calling for Kreacher. “I remember them from visiting my dreadful old Great Aunt as a child.”
," Teddy chimes in. Draco refrains from pointing out that the animatronic ghosts had caused both children to shriek all the same.
They’re trapped on the fourth floor.
he hasn’t ever set foot in this room before. “Why are you here?”
The article even manages to quote Harry saying to the Tornadoes coach that he’s the one to focus on the fundamentals, while Draco—
“I’ll come,” Harry says. “I mean, not to… just to keep you company.”
Hermione shows him a series of little checkmarks inside the cover of her notebook. “This is my best guess,” she says. “We were aiming to conduct the ritual on the night of the Solstice because it would amplify its power. We won’t know for sure if it’s the right day, but it will be close enough to have some effect.”
This is the first time Harry’s noticed that Ron is, in fact, wearing gloves.
But then Malfoy adds quickly, “Save the mulled wine for tomorrow,” and Harry dares to let himself hope again. “We’ll need it if you think you’re going to get me to sing Christmas carols in public.”
Harry doesn’t know what he’d expected. Perhaps the old Malfoy antagonism; a sneer and some jibe about how Harry was too stupid to understand the information he was being offered. Or forced sincerity perhaps, pleading with Harry to believe him.
But it only really gets worse from there.
“Ms Bulstrode? Mr Nott?” Ron asks.
“We need to see all the paperwork around the opening of this
“What is it?”
Potter rubs at his arms as if he’s cold all of a sudden, even though the day is reasonably mild.
Narcissa shakes her head again. “I’m not saying anything.”
“Is that it?” Hermione asks, her voice skeptical.
Zabini finally breaks out in a slow clap, loud in the suffocating quiet. “Bravo, old man. Quite the coup. Your bride is, as we always expected, far too good for you.”
how to get under Ron’s skin.
The eggs are cold. Harry isn’t hungry anymore anyway.
“I’m going to get a drink,” Draco says, and pats Harry’s knee as he leaves.
“You cannot
The pieces click into place instantly for Harry, but Ron still looks confused.
“You what? You hate egg.”
“As you know,” Parkinson goes on, snapping her wand in the direction of a huge velvet curtain that smooths itself out obediently and turns white, like a movie screen. “The Appleby Arrows are on the verge of bankruptcy. I have been appointed to ensure that doesn’t happen.” Another flick, and the screen fills with charts, all of them declining depressingly down and to the right.
So a repeat performance with Potter is completely off the table. It would be a disaster.
“I don’t think it’s that serious,” Harry argues, although he’s not sure he believes that himself. “Seems more like a prank than anything. A little unnerving, maybe. But there hasn’t been anything threatening in it.”
“But did it work?” Hannah asks. “What’s happened to the castle?”
Hermione nods, though she doesn’t really seem appeased. “I’m going to lie down before dinner,” she sighs. “I figure I’ll need some rest in order to get through it.”
Draco’s chest clenches.
Draco takes a Portkey from his flat with Teddy.
Draco wakes to the sound of Harry in the shower. A glance at the clock shows it’s still early. He has more than enough time to dress and prepare himself for breakfast in the Great Hall before the more formal ceremonies.
“This is Polyjuice?” he asks.
She stalks from the room. Zabini puts his glass down and follows her. Bulstrode stares hatefully at Harry and stays where she is, spearing her salad on her fork with unnecessary force — seemingly determined to make everyone feel even more awkward. It works — she and Nott concentrate on finishing their meals and don’t engage anyone in conversation. Ginny puts her cutlery down with a slightly nauseated look. Hermione and Neville strike up a conversation about hyacinths that goes on for longer than Harry would have thought humanly possible.
“Shall we talk about it now, then, while we’re on our own?”
“Don’t mention my father,” Malfoy snaps back, losing some of his composure.
Before she can work up the courage, he slips past her and strides straight to the till, giving Bethany a wee wave, and holding up the book. She gives him a thumbs up to indicate she’ll add it to his account. He ducks into the back room and straight into the Floo to St Mungo’s.
At this, even Neville has had enough. “Sir, that’s completely uncalled for.”

left me. You all left me to go back to school by myself — no Fred, no George, just me — while the three of you went hunting Horcruxes, because I was just… well. I was always just Ron’s sister, wasn’t I, Harry? Fine for a quick grope behind the greenhouses. But not actually worth talking to or bringing along — or
— I want to be remembered; for something
“And so with this modified version of artificial Wolfsbane, we think the lycanthrope registration will be completely unnecessary. They’ll be able to live normally and…”
They lean the beam inside the small crumbling, stone structure.
Neville seems a little flustered at this, running his hand repeatedly through his hair. “You don’t think he was right, do you?” he asks, addressing the question to the table at large. “About Voldemort, I mean.”
She gives Draco a stern glare over Cranswick’s shoulder, as she takes the old man’s elbow. “Now, Mr Cranswick, I have some merchandise designs I would simply love your input on.” She steers him away into the crowd.
Christmas has definitely come to Grimmauld Place, finally.
Draco doesn’t know what to say to that, his throat thick with emotion.
trapped in here?” Ron’s expression is horrified.
“Draco Malfoy reported his mother falling unwell in suspicious circumstances. It was investigated by the Auror Department. I’d like to see the file.”

Malfoy wrinkles his nose at the challenge, as if Harry’s just asked him to perform a basic
Andromeda is the only one he keeps in anything like regular contact with, and even that’s every couple of months at best. Teddy, at age nine, is utterly disinterested in a fire-call with a godfather he doesn’t remember, and while Andromeda will occasionally make him kneel down and say hello, it’s always stilted and Harry can never think of anything much to say in response.
“Do you think it will give us the same tasks to do next Christmas, or new ones?” he asks, getting up and crowding Draco against the door, hands on his waist.
it is you want to start seeing, I think his tone will change.”
Harry’s head snaps up and he finds Malfoy staring at him.
The cameras flash again.
“What? Oh. No,” Neville mumbles, clearly uninterested in the topic, and then wanders out again without the oil he came in for. Harry shakes his head with a laugh.
On Friday, the view from Belle’s windows has changed. They now look out on a stable, eaves laden with snow. The doors are wide.
“I’m so sorry,” Harry rushes on. “I never wanted to oppose you. Merlin, I can’t think of anything worse than being Minister for Magic.”
of that, here you were helping young queer kids find their way in the world and being the best dad Teddy could hope for and helping single mums get on their feet again, and I mean. Fuck, Draco. Like, how could I ever hope to live up to that, you know? I was just glad you found me fit enough to want to keep fucking me.”
Harry launches himself at Draco, pressing him back against the wall and kissing his startled face. Draco laughs, wrapping his arms tightly around Harry and pulling him close.
“I’m going to try,” he says, pushing up to his feet and dusting off his hands. He strides over to the wall and tries to put all of the same will he put behind his previous requests of the Room years before.
He starts the letter with the easy part, which is saying sorry. Explanations are much tougher. He doesn’t have the words to explain about going to the Farm and realising just how much progress Draco’s made since the War. Somehow it’s been different than watching his friends move on without him. A thin strand of their old competitiveness makes him feel like if
Draco stares at it in disbelief.
clean. Kreacher is not sure why Master seemed to think he had not been keeping on top of his chores.”
“What did he mean?” Harry says to Luna later, sounding sulky even to his own ears. He’s curled up in Luna’s armchair, watching while she mixes ingredients together for a muscle relaxant potion. It smells like juniper and woodsmoke, and has, at least, managed to restore Harry’s mood a little.
But first he has to
Harry falls asleep that night thinking about the angry red fog and the way Malfoy’s cufflinks caught the light when he cast. Hopefully the door will be open by tomorrow, or Harry’s confident he’s going to be the one facing the blame.
As if sensing his discomfort, Hermione says, “I just mean, we should ask him. If Luna is in trouble, he could help.”
“I don’t think it’s harsh at all,” Harry argues, folding his flyers over tightly and twisting them a little in his hand. He was expecting Luna to be complimentary. Everyone else has been.
Draco collapses back against the bed with a sigh. He’s so tired, and in a great deal of pain. None of this is making sense.
“Fancy,” Elsa says, admiring the sleek new model. “I thought British wizards didn’t know about phones or computers or
“If I go, then the whole thing is suddenly about me, isn’t it.” He doesn’t really express it as a question. “They want me to give a speech, to
It’s a chilling thought, that what Hermione was able to achieve for her parents—removing their memories of her, implanting false ones—could possibly have happened to him.
Draco hums noncommittally and wonders if he needs another pair of socks. “I’m sure Neville will do a fine job of the speech.” And then, more quietly as he rummages in a drawer wondering how many pairs Harry has made off with, “He has done every other year.”
. Home is where the heart is.
Hermione nods. “I think so.”
Harry realises that Hermione and Neville can’t move until Malfoy does or they’ll be outside his shield and at the mercy of everything that’s being flung at them. And Malfoy is trying so hard to maintain the unfamiliar shield spell above them that he can’t do anything else.
I’d found the Horcruxes faster. Is it my fault for coming back here and bringing an entire Dark army to the gates?”
Draco laughs abruptly, as if Harry’s told him a very funny joke. Harry waits for an explanation.
in wizarding London in flagrant breach of the rules, putting everyone at risk. And instead it’s like the voice in his head that is trying to tell him that is, for the first time in a long time, tiny and thready and easily ignored.
Harry is just wrestling with why that idea seems disappointing when Malfoy gives him a long, considering look. It’s as if he’s weighing every aspect of Harry, and it’s ridiculous, but Harry suddenly doesn’t want to be found wanting. Draco seems to reach some sort of decision as he stands and leans right into Harry’s personal space, his lips warm against Harry’s ear. “Though if you want me on the floor, I don’t have to get the students back to school for an hour or so.”
If she’s affected by Allsop’s smug tone, she doesn’t show it.
Ron intervenes, “Ginny, don’t —”
can. I don’t want to see you get hurt.”
“Yes,” Harry hears himself saying, over the noisy rush of his heart pounding in his ears. “We should make sure.”
“The calendar knew I was faking!” Harry feels triumphant. He’s sure he’s right about this.
“We’re here,” Malfoy says, pointing out the obvious, because this is their hotel room, and
“I want to see her. And as an Auror—”
“Surely it’s obvious, Granger. It’s convincing us to stay the fuck away.” Draco sits with his knees tucked to his chest — curled up tight and defensive. Harry desperately wants back his relaxed sprawling posture from the night before, when the two of them were confiding in each other quietly in the dark.
“Hey!” the odious little man shouts back. “That’s a crime, that is. Going to report you for criminal damage.”
average cook, and Christmas spirit. That has to count for something.
“Rubbish,” Ron responds, waiting for Draco to deposit his glass and join him. “It’s not about volume, it’s about
“This is ridiculous. You can’t make us stay here,” Nott says.
At this, the elf seems to perk up immeasurably, a dreamy little smile taking over his gnarled features. “The engagement of Master Draco and Miss Lovegood,” he says, as if Harry must be a little daft to have forgotten.
Harry stuffs it into his pocket with a scowl.
“Kitchen magic,” Hannah whispers back. “It’s got a whole life of its own. You should see the deep fryer at the Leaky if I don’t feed it potatoes regularly enough.” Hannah works summers at the pub to pay for her Healer training. She’s always slipping them extra chips. Harry’s never given much thought to where they come from.
“Off you go, give it a try,” he encourages, and Teddy shoots off across the park like a skyrocket.
want to go. It’s not like
It’s too cold to be outside, really, but he casts a few lazy warming charms and perches on the back step anyway. The night sky is clear and the stars seem impossibly bright. It doesn’t help him to shake off the slightly haunted feeling. He hears the door open and close behind him.
“Neville and Luna stay. I can…I can handle the rest of this list, but you fire the two of them and I’m gone as well.”
Harry’s owl arrives around eleven, and is filthy enough that Draco casts an
He thinks about just coming clean to Hermione, but he doesn’t feel right about outing Malfoy, and if he gives her that ammunition — tells her all the many and varied ways they’ve shagged each other over the last couple of years — she’s likely to just blow the place up right now. Besides, he’s not sure what he’d even say. That he’s found himself impossibly attracted to one of the worst people they both know? That when he first received Luna’s invite, he had a moment where he thought maybe Malfoy wanted to see him intentionally, rather than just putting up with Harry barreling into his life when fortune crossed their paths? Although if Harry’s being honest with himself, he can’t really keep blaming fortune. He was the one who’d found out that Malfoy was part of a charity delegation meeting in Edinburgh in March, so that wasn’t exactly an accident. And he’s pretty sure Malfoy had seen the headlines about Harry opening the new Muggle-born wizarding school in Cornwall in the paper, so his appearing at The Mermaid’s Tail that night probably hadn’t been fate.
lovely, but you need to put poor Neville out of his misery and tell him you have feelings for him too.”
“Completely sure, Harry. He’s in with Belle?” she asked, and when Harry nodded, she took off her outer cloak and sat down in an uncomfortable-looking chair opposite him. “Then we wait.”
Kreacher’s whole countenance perks up when he sees Malfoy, and he greets him with a grovelling, “Master of the House of Black,” that makes Harry roll his eyes. Harry waits for Malfoy to be rude or dismissive, the way his father would have been, but he just compliments Kreacher on his baking and asks whether the house has a spade. Kreacher practically trips over himself to show Malfoy a cupboard by the back door that Harry’s never paid any attention to, which seems to be stocked with moth-eaten-looking winter cloaks, Wellington boots, and yes, garden implements.
He looks sickly in the green glow of the charm, and the amount of blood on his clothes is horrifying. Hermione draws up a chair beside the head of his bed, her expression agonised. Hannah gathers the potions and equipment she needs and gets to work.
There’s a sudden stony silence in the room. Harry doesn’t have the first idea how to fill it.
took up six column inches.
“I like money,” she concludes simply, waving her wand at the screen and reverting it to its original state as a curtain. “If you don’t like money, you can keep playing village Quidditch until you die on a broom. But you’ll be doing it on your own. That’s the proposal. You have a week to decide.”
“What do you mean?” Harry asks, confused.
Hermione sighs and gently tugs her finger back from Hugo, picking the baby up as he starts to fuss. She frowns at Harry, a sign he’s coming to recognise means he’s freshly disappointed her in some way.
He hears Melinda groan, “God, now we’re in even more trouble. I’m never passing this rotation.”
,” and really Harry can’t help but agree.
Malfoy laughs, but there’s no humour in it at all. The sound falls flat in the silence between them. Harry listens to the distant chime of a heartbeat monitor.
The big double doors to the Cyprian Youdle Memorial Dining Room are closed, but Parkinson barely pauses, flicking her wand out of the sleeve of her jacket and casting so that they swing back dramatically on squeaking hinges. The twelve owners of the other teams in the League look up in unison, startled. Little fairy cakes and club sandwiches are piled high in the centre of the table, and they look almost comically out of place, as if the very old and very wealthy wizards were playing tea party.
“That last passage of play was really swift. Honestly, Morgan and North, you were really quick out there and it showed.”
“Yes, but today is a particularly good day for you to be here. Belle isn’t doing so well.”
“Uncle Harry’s? Can I come?” Rose’s ears prick up at the mention of Grimmauld Place.
And Harry knows if anyone can, she can.
, his father.”
“Brilliant,” says Draco, absurdly grateful for the reprieve, wiping at his face with his sleeve. “A Galleon per gnome?”
. Hundreds of them, by the looks.
“Seriously, mate? Why can’t we sit with you like usual?”
about it quite as much.
It’s only as she walks back through the barrier that Draco feels the tears on his cheeks.
“We need to go home, Harry. To your room at Grimmauld Place. Ron and Hermione and Luna. Molly and the children. They’re all there waiting for you.”
Leila is just as encouraging with Harry as she’d been with his team. She explains the difference between the spells she uses on her broom and the counterbalancing magic she uses on herself. At one point she pauses awkwardly.
” Malfoy exclaims suddenly, grabbing Luna around the waist and swinging her wildly to the right before lowering her carefully to the ground. “Nobody move.”
He winds up sitting down at the table with Neville on one side of him and Ginny on the other. The conversation definitely does not flow. Ginny seems knackered and Harry is reluctant to question her too much. The headlines about her being dropped from the Harpies after a lacklustre season were pretty unforgiving, and Harry is all too familiar with being the centre of that kind of unwanted public attention, so he leaves her be.
“I think you should start flying again,” Draco announces. As if that weren’t a bloody ridiculous thing to say, given they’re currently both about thirty feet off the ground. Harry gestures sarcastically at his broom as if to say as much.
“Where on earth did you get that?” he yelps as she pulls in and parks in front of Draco’s building in a ludicrous oversized van. She practically needs a step ladder to exit her seat. She helps Rose down, who calls an abrupt hello to Draco as she tears past him to join Teddy and the others.
doesn’t do casual. He used to, in the immediate aftermath of the war. Lost in a complicated sea of grief about his father, dealing with his own culpability, mostly scorned by a community that felt he’d escaped the punishment he deserved. He spent a lot of time in Muggle London, hell-bent on discovering how wrong Lucius Malfoy had been about everything. And time in Muggle London lead to time in Muggle bars and clubs, drinking to forget and experimenting with anyone and everything. But it was a soulless, empty time, and it made him no happier than he had been before he started. So he found himself a Mind Healer, moved out of the Manor, and began to exclusively date Maxwell Eaton, a wizard whose family had been in France for the previous ten years and had no interest in anything Draco had done or not done during the war. That lasted six months. After Maxwell, there was Francis. And after Francis, there was Dean.
“Wonder what?” Harry asks.
He rocks back in his chair, which doesn’t look entirely safe given its spindly antique frame, one of his legs kicked up on the other, leering at Cassie as she casts the diagnostic spell on his wand.
Everyone freezes, craning their necks to try to see what Malfoy is doing. He draws his wand and tries several spells that do nothing before one finally takes and a large plastic garbage bag wraps itself around a handful of books that had been by Luna’s feet. He twists the top of the bag off with magic and flings it several yards away from them.
Casey looks shocked, stilled by the venom in Malfoy’s tone.
“Maybe, I don’t know. Need to get through this first, don’t we?” He doesn’t mean it to sound morbid, but his best friend is lying in a bloody hospital bed, they haven’t seen sunlight in days, and death seems to be waiting for them around every corner.
His first night’s sleep is fitful. His bed feels lumpy and uncomfortable and not at all like he remembers.
what was for dinner! I
“Who do you think insisted I first consult you all those years ago?! It certainly wasn’t
Hermione goes up to the attic with him, bending double with laughter when she sees the enormous bell wrapped in a quilt. Harry concedes it wasn’t his best work. Together they dismantle the bell, levitating it into a corner of the attic and removing its charmed clapper altogether. Hermione casts a vigorous set of warming charms and the two of them climb out onto the roof to knit the tiles back into place. It’s a clear night, and the stars seem impossibly close. Around Grimmauld Place Harry’s neighbours have decorated their houses. An inflatable Santa is stuffed into the small balcony of a flat across the way. The bare branches of a tree in the front yard at number eight have been hung with brightly coloured lanterns. Number three has a row of giant light-up candy canes—presumably not the carnivorous wizarding kind—all along the rails of their fence. Everywhere he looks there are fairy lights.
“On second thought, it can wait.”
He falls asleep that night happy and optimistic.

“Luna?”
“You look very nice,” he says, and means it. Her blue dress is one he hasn’t seen before and looks a great deal more on point than the sorts of things Hermione usually wears. She smooths it self-consciously.
. Harry turns the card over in his hand, as if there might be more of an explanation on the back. He hasn’t seen Luna in a couple of months either, which isn’t all that surprising. She’s a great one for dropping off the radar and turning back up with tales of spice markets in Turkey or healing rituals she’s learned from ancient Chinese wizards. What
“You inspire many feelings, Harry,” he continues with a sigh. “Confidence isn’t one of them.”
“ME?!” Harry is incredulous. “How about
Hermione gives her an odd look, but nods.
“You know him. Always slightly bent out of shape about something. I don’t think he wants me there but he can’t think of a reason to object, I guess. Striding about like he owns the place.”
“Do you know any reason why someone might want Lucius Malfoy dead?” Ron asks.
“Oh, get on with it, Potter,” Malfoy huffs out in a half-laugh and closes the distance, pressing their lips together.
“Your parents aren’t joining us tonight, old man?” Zabini asks his friend.
“No,” Ron shakes his head weakly. “I just have to lie here. Merlin knows what you lot are going to face up there.”
“Well, it so happens you’re in luck.” Draco gives him a conspiratorial smile, pointing at the front near the stage where Hannah is tapping her foot to a truly execrable cover of “Bleeding Love.” Draco’s considering putting it on the banned list. To do this, he’d have to create a banned list, but it seems worth it this year. “Madame Longbottom over there accompanied them this evening. It seems the Hogwarts infirmary is blessedly empty tonight.”
“Oh,” says Harry, momentarily stumped. “Maybe she was just lost.”
“Maybe we don’t actually
“I should
Clutching the file, he heads back up to his and Hermione’s office. She’s nowhere to be seen, so he makes himself a cup of tea and sits down to read. The Investigating Aurors were McCabe and Dillon—two men nearing retirement who vastly prefer the comfort of their overly cushioned office chairs to anything approaching real Auror work. Harry suspects the investigation suffered more through apathy than malice. The file is thin, and reflects exactly the kind of cursory, biased approach that Draco described yesterday. The sheer laziness makes Harry’s blood boil.
“You did
He’s not even really sure why Harry is here, sitting on the end of his bed, watching him pack a bag. They’d talked about going to the Wand, but Draco has an early Portkey and he’s not really in the mood, and Harry seems distracted and out of sorts. Like he’s spoiling for an argument.
Harry nods.
Luna laughs delightedly. “Goodness, no,” she hugs him briefly, and offers no further explanation, wandering off into the shop to help someone who can’t reach a designer ceramic travel-cauldron on a high shelf.
And just like that, the switch is flipped, and all around them the trees surrounding the snow-covered town square are lit up with Christmas lights in greens and reds and golds.
Harry, bizarrely, finds himself wanting to defend Malfoy. He’s had his own share of overreactions over the years. Trauma does odd things to people.
He makes a show of plumping his pillows for several long minutes, and then lies back and closes his eyes.
“Yes! My feet nearly went out from under me as soon as I stepped on it.”
Harry cuts him off with another kiss. “Hush, you annoying prick. It’s not that I don’t
“We have an obligation, to this next generation.” Her voice carries under a gentle Sonorus across the still spring morning. “To remember the things that they will not. The Muggles have a poem that they read at memorials like this as a tribute to their fallen, and I would like to close with those words.
“Thank you. Now, I’m going to go to the office and finish up this paperwork. Contact me there when you’re happy to come in.”
The advent calendar, now the only bright spot in the room, flickers happily.  Harry opens door two. He expects it to be empty and unpainted like the others, but the back of it shows a drawing of Christmas cards sitting along a mantlepiece. It makes Harry smile. At least one piece of this ludicrous Christmas commitment seems to be working. Now he just needs to get cracking on the rest.
Neville gives him a look as if what Harry’s said is utterly ridiculous.
Draco’s mouth opens and closes again. A flush rises on his cheeks.
, Harry. We can do this. You’ve hunted enough Dark wizards for several lifetimes. It’s time to do something for yourself now. It’s okay to want things for yourself.”
“A chair?! What’s a
Except that her suggestion keeps gnawing at him as he heads back to the Leaky, and it won’t leave him alone as he eats a bowl of bland soup at the bar. He asks Kim, the waitress, about the Bent Wand and she gives him directions to a new street opened up after the war. He has no interest at all in seeing what Malfoy’s up to, but the idea that British wizards have caught up with the modern world enough to have gay bars out in the open is sort of intriguing. He could just go have a drink there. It doesn’t mean he has to talk to Malfoy. In fact the thought of
Ginny covers her eyes with her hands, and Harry places a sympathetic hand on her shoulder.
“Can I buy one?”
Harry eyes the oversized candy canes with horror.
“What do you mean, the car?”
The crowd dwindles, and Teddy seems pleased by the unexpected playdate with Rose, so before Draco can think too much further about it, it’s just him and Harry. The silence in the staff room seems oppressive.
“And the suit…” the shorter witch says, her expression dreamy. “Randall said he took one look at the uniform robes, swore in French, and just walked away.”
Draco very much wants to say no. He did exactly what Hermione asked of him today. He came here and he supported Harry and Neville’s work, and he praised him appropriately and he behaved like a grownup, and that should be enough.
share,” he tries to reason with her.
The oil-painted figure looks around the edges of his frame, taking in his surroundings. He doesn’t seem that impressed. “It’s better than the vault, I suppose. There is daylight at least. And a little better than the ruin. Not so damp.”
The tea scalds the back of Harry’s throat. “What?”
“Is this meal breakfast?” Hannah asks when Harry joins them back in the common room. She’s pulling out food pouches and looking at the labels in confusion.
“Food’s here,” he says quietly, but she startles anyway, as if she’s surprised to see him in the room.
But Harry can’t shake the sense that
Potter scrapes his plate clean. “I don’t really care about the house stuff. My home is in New York, and Godric’s Hollow is destroyed,” he concludes, and Draco thinks for a horrifying moment that he might actually lick his knife, but he eventually just deposits his cutlery on the table. “But I really want the things out of the vault, so. The sooner you can sort it, the better, I guess.”
“Yes,” Casey nods sagely, unable to contain his smug grin. “
Malfoy finishes his incantation with a flourish, watches the coloured spell-lines over Belle’s body dissipate, and then exchanges his wand for a quill to start taking notes.
“This is nice,” he says, which feels like an inarticulate way to describe how he’s feeling.
He’s about to object that he wasn’t actually here to see Malfoy, so it doesn’t matter, but he supposes he has just come from his office, so that isn’t one hundred percent accurate.
The food is delicious and comforting and Harry starts to relax. Hermione nudges his knee under the table and gives him a warm smile. He realises he’s missed seeing her at work every day.
Ron shrugs. “Probably doesn’t want to give us anything to work with. You know what these old families are like. Not a word to law enforcement without an advocate. The Malfoys in particular seem to think of us as nothing but Ministry minions.”
, he decides, and starts ripping out all the plants he thinks he remembers as weeds from herbology classes. He does it for hours, until there’s a towering pile of greenery wilting on the stone behind him, until his fingers are muddy and scratched.
The elder Malfoy ignores her. He glares at his empty wineglass as if it’s personally offended him before a trembling elf is bold enough to appear at his elbow and top it up again.
“But Molly—”
Hermione wriggles again, slipping free of his grasp. He lets out a frustrated growl, lunging for her and missing as she crumples abruptly to the floor.
a quill and parchment and pens an RSVP, tying it to Lancelot’s leg before he can think about it too carefully.
Harry glances back at Draco’s wrist, covered again by the sweater, but only just. Now that he knows it’s there, he can even make out the glow of the vicious red band through the fabric.
“I’m sorry…
“You found nothing at the Manor?” he asks, pushing his luck. Hermione isn’t supposed to tell him anything, and he only made that worse by turning up there before her.
“Weak,” Ron admits. “Like my insides have been a bit scrambled.”

Seven years of habit breaks through Draco’s panic, and he opens his mouth to make an inevitable snide jab about the Golden Trio before catching himself. Potter doesn’t even notice.

. But they’re not
“His case-closure rate is very high,” Harry agrees, definitely not looking in her direction and instead concentrating on tying off a fiddly bit of thread.
“What now?” Draco asks, the tremor in his voice giving away more than he probably intends.
Draco flicks a mild stinging hex at her leg under the table, but she barely flinches for laughing.
They make short work of the roofing tiles and Hermione readily agrees to hot toddies afterwards. They cup the warm mugs in front of the fireplace.
at it. The metal door slams back noisily on its hinges. Harry grabs Maxwell’s broom.
here, remember.”
“You’re going to kit out a kitchen just for me to cook in?”
Ron makes a sort of strangled noise and coughs to clear his throat.
“You’re not getting rid of me that easily,” he sneers.
“Mostly,” Fleamont replies. “It was a depressing place to be, but better than always sitting in the dark. I slept in the vault, however, particularly in winter.”
Harry glances around the tiny office, wondering for a wild moment if someone is watching him and he’s being pranked in some unspecified way. He thinks about just leaving: the office, the bank, the entire country. But then he thinks about the words
seasonal. I just need a uniform jacket and some plain trousers, please.”
Thinking about the stabilising spells as a prosthesis is useful, he realises. The metaphor is a little clumsy, but he’s worked out that, in order to fix the rings the way he usually would, Lily’s ring first needs a kind of a transplant. If he can

“He was in the treatment room with that patient for nearly twenty hours. And he comes out of the Staff Lounge after he’s cleaned up and changed, and announces that he’s going to sleep the sleep of the righteous and no one should send him a Patronus under any circumstances or they’ll find their toenails have fallen off and blah blah,” Casey waves a dramatic hand around as part of his impression,”Threats in French, etcetera.”
“We’ll leave you to it,” Padma says politely, deftly wanding the porcelain debris away as she grabs Harry’s wrist.
in my house, I’d ask that my representative be present from now on while you’re talking to my son and his friends.”
Draco snorts. “Potter’s trapped in a vision of the wizarding world that didn’t exist before the war and certainly doesn’t exist now. You can’t expect me to—”
“I sent Granger a referral.”
“Did you appease the calendar, win the heart of the fair maiden, et cetera?”
“You only turn ten once. Besides, next year he’s off to school, and we won’t get as much time together. It’s nice to have something to do with him before then.”
carols.”
“Do you know what the worst part is? I know,
It feels a little bit like a trap, but one that Draco wants to spring now, rather than wait. It’s one thing to have a quickie out the back of a pub. It’s another to put years of animosity behind them. If Potter is going to get high and mighty about Draco’s past, he’d rather get it all out in the open, so he can politely decline this job and get on with his life. He doesn’t

to show for it.”
“What’s Malfoy think?”
“It’s not just slippery,” he spits out. “There’s something repelling us.”
“What is it? What’s wrong?” Harry asks. He’s uncomfortably exposed in nothing but his boxer briefs. He reaches for his glasses and jams them on his face.
Malfoy, of the—”
Harry tries not to flinch at Draco’s reversion to his family name.
at the floorboard, which smoothes itself firmly into place, then he reaches for Harry’s hand. “May I?”
He splutters back up, coughing.
“Take a ... take a picture,” Pete whispers urgently, flapping a hand at Carl, who startles and fiddles with the catches on his bag.
“I could just arrest you, you know, and we could go back to the Ministry right now, where people are going to be far less interested than I am in hearing your side of the story.”
He feels Hannah pull gently at his arm, shifting him out of her way. “Let me, Harry.”
If there’s anywhere no one wants to see ten years after the scene of a battle, it’s the place where the wounded and dying were brought. Neville takes charge, using an industrial strength banishing spell he learned at the apothecary to vanish bed linen, bandages, and stains. Harry finds a broom in a closet and sweeps the dust by hand, more for something to do than anything else. Luna comes back from Pomfrey’s rooms with a pile of clean sheets and makes up a bed, before Neville carefully lowers Ron onto it.
“I did,” Harry laughs. “But I kept it safe.”
Hannah laughs awkwardly. “Then Hermione’s right, you must have misread it.”
“Well, a Muggle wouldn’t know that unless they knew you, Harry. Do you think this is connected to the Dursleys somehow?”
Harry looks around the room, crouching to the floor where he’d found the body, pressing the palm of his hand into the thick pile of the carpet.
Harry moves on instinct, taking up a battle stance and flinging spells as quickly as he can. He’s dimly aware of the others behind him, but he knows that what little defensive magic they have was learned here at school, which will be of no use to them. His shields are up and he finds himself able to deflect the smaller projectiles until he’s forced to duel with a particularly aggressive broadsword that’s almost as long as he is tall.
“Agreed,” says Luna happily, sitting down on the floor and sliding some parchment towards herself.
The Prague trip manages to do exactly what they hoped it would. The team are working well together, and Harry has to finally reluctantly concede that the methods Draco’s brought with him are useful and important. Even his snappish coaching style suddenly seems more productive than it had before. Less like Snape yelling at Harry and more like Snape teaching Slytherins, he supposes. Still unrelenting and focussed, but at least underpinned with a real desire to find a way to help them win. Wood is back to being enthusiastic and encouraging, not yelling all the time. And, not unrelatedly, Maxwell seems to have regained his confidence.
Ginny’s calm disappears, and colour floods her face. “Right,” she snaps. “
“The rest of you, you’re going to do everything you can to open the field up for Isha. I want
” Harry asks quietly. “
Harry jerks awake. His neck sends shooting pains of protest where he’s managed to sort of fold himself in half in a hard plastic waiting room chair.
Harry figures he isn’t going to get an invitation to sit down, so he draws out the chair on the other side of Malfoy’s desk and does so anyway as he gathers his thoughts.
“No.”
“That will be all then,” Ron says, putting his pen down and gesturing expansively toward the door. Zabini doesn’t wait to be told twice. Whatever artificial camaraderie he and Ron had appeared to enjoy after Ron’s victory in the hunt the day before has completely disappeared.
“Didn’t what?” Hermione asks in confusion.
He keeps telling himself he probably won’t go. Even as he stands under the weak shower in his ensuite and drags a comb through his hair. Even as he finds himself dressed in the new suit unaccountably early, staring at the clock on the kitchen wall and waiting for it to tick around to a respectable time. He thinks about putting his pajamas back on. If the bottle of firewhisky wasn’t empty, he probably would.
“I wanted one more guest to join us,” he says, looking over his shoulder, as Draco comes out of the house. The guests gasp, and Harry sort of wants to as well, but for a completely different reason. Draco’s midnight blue shirt shows off his pale skin to best advantage, and it’s open at the neck giving Harry too many reasons to concentrate on his collarbones. Draco keeps his eyes on Harry, giving him a small smile of encouragement, and Harry feels steeled by the bravery it's taken for him to step out here in front of a group of people who think they hate him and want him imprisoned, or worse. He turns back to the crowd.
Ron nods toward the door at Cassie and she gathers up her parchment notes and follows him out.
“I’m thinking that
“He’s so fast,” Harry overhears her saying dreamily to Belinda Morgan as they head in from the pitch to get changed one afternoon. “I’ve never seen anyone fly like that.”
Draco rolls his eyes as he stands up, brushing the dust and creases from his pants and running a hand through his hair. Harry stays where he is, not sure he can quite trust himself to move, the memory of Draco’s touch still singing in every nerve.
Harry wonders what not being
“Rubbish. I’m proposing to make it faster and more interesting.”
Harry would elbow her in the ribs, but he knows he’d just fall down again. “We need to hold hands
“You’re bloody brilliant,” he says, before stepping away, leaving Harry in an addled cloud of heat and expensive cologne. Draco turns back to the cabinet, slamming the doors shut and casting rapidly.
“Where can I go ice-skating?” he asks Padma as soon as she arrives in the office.
He busies himself with his preparations, finding the ritual at least calming.
“We’re making Yule logs,” she says, turning the decorated stick she has in her hand around to show him. It’s so covered in glitter glue and ribbons, you can’t really see the wood anymore, but Harry figures that’s not really the point.
Prompt Three:
Malfoy ignores him. “That’s why Nott bailed, isn’t it, Granger? Got cold feet. Whatever you promised him wasn’t enough to risk his neck and his job?”
if it was ok to date me?!”
Draco opens his mouth and then closes it again. A lecture on magical theory is probably not going to help matters right now.
The truth is, Draco’s managed to dismantle basically every single one of Harry’s assumptions about him. He’s still sharp and aggressive with his tone, still snide with his humour and incredibly demanding of the team. He’s quick to cut Harry off in disagreement with a play or strategy, and far too prone to just flying away in a snit sometimes, knowing Harry can’t follow him. Draco bristles about the rules of the League and derides the other owners and frequently flings hexes into the empty stands out of sheer frustration.
“Harry! Are you decent?” she shouts, clattering up the stairs to his room, her Auror boots making a fierce noise on the polished wood. Harry rubs the sleep from his eyes and sits up, dragging the covers around himself before the door flies open.
“Is that true?” Hannah asks in surprise.
“You’ve fixed them?!” Harry gasps, glancing from the rings to Draco’s face and back again in quick succession. He doesn’t make any move to take them.
Harry snorts. He can absolutely imagine Lucius ruining whatever small sparks of joy Malfoy might have found when he was young.
He’s far too weak to Apparate directly away, though the thought is tempting.
“Luna,” Hermione sighs in frustration. “You really must tell us what is actually going on. I mean, you clearly don’t have feelings for
Draco puts his takeaway coffee cup on the corner of the desk as he unwraps his scarf. He shuffles his chair around a little so that he can look at Potter’s profile while he’s listening to the elder Weasley. It seems to make Potter gratifyingly uncomfortable, and he pushes his own chair back, forming a strangely awkward little triangle. Draco smirks at him, pleased to see he’s not the only one ruffled by this whole nightmare, and wraps both his hands back around his coffee cup before turning his attention to Bill. “How can I help?”
Harry seems to contemplate this for a long moment. Then he takes a deep breath and squares his shoulders as if he’s trying to steel himself for something. Draco would recognise that Gryffindor pose anywhere—as if he’s about to throw himself recklessly into danger. Harry turns fully to face him.
“I’ve got my eye on you,” Pansy warns, pointing at him with one long, blood-red nail.
“There’s a possibility you’ve overlooked,” Hermione says, her tone cautious.
In the Lounge, the giant broken Advent calendar has been taken down and in its place is a charmed illusion of a cosy fireplace. The stones are fat and round and the high mantlepiece has  stockings hung across it, each spelled to change through the names of the Healers on duty at the time. A Yule log burns merrily in the hearth, giving off no heat, but all of the warm light of a real fire. Casey has his wand out and is putting the finishing touches to it.
“She’s confessed to it. In front of many, many witnesses.”
“No,” whispers Luna brokenly, to Harry’s left.
“Where the castle’s
It’s not the
Back on the fifth floor, Hannah gives the password and Harry finds himself holding his breath but the door slides open without incident. Inside, the mermaid-decorated stained glass has fallen to the ground, but the rest of the bathroom is just as he remembers it, right down to the enormous, foaming tub, still magically heated after all this time.
“So, what. You went and ate poncy Muggle food in the middle of nowhere?”
Platters of roast chicken float in from the kitchen, arranging themselves neatly down the centre of the table. Harry thinks it’s time they concentrated on that and not whatever nonsense the
“How are you feeling?”
“We’re making gingerbread biscuits. Why don’t you roll out some dough and I’ll make you a coffee.”
“My father gave me a training broom when I turned eight,” Draco says, trying not to let it sound as gloating as he would have at that age. Truth was he’d fallen off more than he’d managed to stay on, and his father had stalked away muttering about him being too coddled by his mother and his general lack of athletic prowess.
“Is it safe to move him?”
, before his brain catches up with himself and he realises just how little Potter would care.
“Two or three weeks, I’d say. I thought I’d be able to work under less protection by now—that’s what slows me down—but I’m not there yet.”
Luna and Leila meet the team as they land, wrapping them in heated blankets and handing out potions. Harry hugs Isha tightly. “That was some of the bravest play I’ve ever seen.”
nonsense! I don’t see why I’m forced to pretend otherwise at my own dining table. What a collection of absolute riff-raff. It’s just as well we don’t have any bloody family portraits in here — our ancestors would be
, Draco. It’s never been nothing between the two of you.”
Luna gives a delicate shrug. “I don’t agree with the rules,” she says, and takes out her wand.
Better than he is, in any event. He feels tired and scratchy. Dislocated by being back somewhere familiar and having it not feel very familiar at all.
Hermione narrows her eyes at her and then tries to sit up a little straighter.
“He really doesn’t, Harry,” Luna replies. “He only cares about his mother. He loves her, and he believes she just couldn’t survive it. Can you imagine it: Narcissa, turned out of her home? Because he can’t, and nor can I.”
Draco’s embarrassed to realise he hadn’t given it much thought. He’s never sat inside the Weasley car and assumed it worked a bit like the Knight Bus. Plenty of room for everyone.
Malfoy looks back, eyes narrow, as if he’s about to say something cutting. But then he rolls his shoulders and seems to relax again. “This is supposed to help us work together as a team, Potter. Not much opportunity for bonding if I’m off somewhere soaking in a room-sized bath.”
“Draco didn’t charm the broom.”
“Giving up?” he asks quietly, although it still seems too loud for the quiet green of the woods now Blaise and the unicorn are gone, and Malfoy starts, spinning around to notice him for the first time. He glares at Harry, squaring his shoulders.
“Best guess? I was wearing the lame Christmas clothing it foisted on me, but no one else was.”
rings are restored. It will just be a house, in the way that my flat is just a flat.”
Ron scoffs, oblivious to Harry’s discomfort. “That’s probably been in every
“Snakes escaping the zoo?” he suggests drily, and Harry laughs.
“Don’t lie,” Harry snaps, and without really planning it, he finds himself advancing faster across the clearing, until he’s toe to toe with Malfoy. Harry can feel the heat of his own anger rolling off him, meeting Malfoy’s coldness. Malfoy takes a step backwards until he has his back to a tree.
