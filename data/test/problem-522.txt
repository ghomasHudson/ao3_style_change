He was abruptly cut off by the group that Harry had lost, which had just entered back into the Great Hall from outside. Seamus and Hermione were stumbling, and both bore the traces of recent tears, all red and puffy-eyed, clutching each other tightly, but both smiling in between irregular sobs and gasps for breath. Ron was guiding them both by their shoulders, Neville was doing his best to be assuring, Luna supplying an addition to what he was saying here and there, while Dean was simply bringing up the rear. Harry stood up, concerned, and strode towards them, to which Draco rolled his eyes; 'Always swooping in to save the day…'
Forgetting whatever else he had planned to say, Harry merely nods and looks around. Draco picks up on his loss for conversation starters, and  takes the opportunity to address something that had been lingering in his mind for most of the day.
Malfoy scoffed, “For Merlin’s sake, Potter! I meant against a door.”
They looked from each other, back inside, then both started frantically knocking against the glass. Not a budge from either of the men inside. Harry moved to the pigeonhole and started shouting their names through it, Draco still knocking on the glass.
“It was a hard job, clearing up this place, wasn’t it?”
“Perhaps.” Draco repeated, pulling his jacket straight. “At the very least, let me assist in trying to rouse your friends? Two pairs of fists are better than one.”
After not even fifteen minutes of chatting, Scorpius got fidgety and climbed down onto the floor, pulling Draco after him, who happily obliged. Out of the back door and into the garden, Scorpius crouched next to an upside-down bucket that had a hole in the bottom, and with one eye squeezed shut he peered into it, “Spiky niffer, Dad!”
“Sheepish as ever, then.” Malfoy took a couple of steps closer, studying Harry with an interest that made him want to squirm.
“Malfoy, I know you’re joking, but it really sounds like you’re mocking me. Anyway, what is your patronus? I never saw you produce one.”
“Erm… Tea, if you have any.”
“And quite strongly enchanted. Anti-burglary with silencing, you’ve no chance of getting through.”
Draco tested the wobbliness of the table, then deduced that it was acceptable.
“No one important.”
“I never thought I would have to assure you of the fact, I thought I would end up defending myself against the idea that I might have ever had feelings for my rival. But here we are.”
“Ah- No, just something Malfoy said yesterday. Apparently my transfiguration skills are shite.”
'If only Dobby had been here to experience this!' Harry smiled at the image of Dobby in potions class, or charms, probably turning pieces of parchment into birds.
Harry blinked, and the lens was gone, the sudden brightness around him was blinding. Where he had just been looking at a heap of rubble, two pillars stood in the hallway. To his left, where embers had been smoldering around a burned-out pile of ash and blackened wood, was the table that the teachers would sit at, covered in flowers and candles. The ominous ringing suddenly stopped, and Harry looked professor McGonagall in the eye.
Draco smiled, and Harry knew exactly the feeling that Draco had in that moment, the warm and fond feeling of thinking of the giggling face of your children, something that would make any parent smile.
“Erm, no I gave you guys the keys, and forgot that I’d need them myself.”
“I think it’s good that George is here.” said Luna, for the first time she’d addressed the group as a whole during the evening, up until then she’d only talked separately to Neville and Harry.
Harry knew Hermione would be alright when her usual sharp tone came right back up to put her husband in line, “Ronald, really? Tie that robe properly.”
“Morning, Potter. Coffee?”
“Well… Would you like me to see if I could help? Unsolvable cases are sort of my thing.”
“I didn’t know until tonight, that I’ve always regretted not doing this earlier…”
“You can’t sleep sitting against the front of your house.”
He nearly pulled the door off its hinges in his rush to get back inside. Standing in front of the hallway mirror, he pulls his fingers through his fingers through his hair that now reaches past his upper back, and gathers it with a black ribbon at his nape. He stuffs his equally dark button-down into his trousers, decides against a jacket, and steps into a pair expensive-looking dress shoes. He takes a breath, then follows the powder he just tossed into the fireplace, swallowed by green flames.
“Of course you did.” Harry moved on from the disappointment, “Alright, so no mixing business with pleasure-”
Dear Mr Draco Malfoy
Harry nodded, “Apologies, Professor. I grew impatient…”
“Why are you giving me these, Harry?”
James, holding a stuffed hippogriff toy, beamed at her, while Albus looked from his mother to his father, then made grabby hands at the latter, who picked him up with a smile. After glancing at the clock on the wall, Harry moved through the kitchen to the hallway, transferring Albus to Ginny on the way. In discontentment, Albus whined and reached for him again.
‘If he wasn’t, I’d be worried,’ Harry thought, but shook his head, “It didn’t come up in conversation last night. I don’t think arranging centerpieces makes him gay, though.”
“It’s wonderful to see so many people together for a good time, young Victoire is lucky to grow up in such a large family that loves her. I’m grateful that my cousin can experience the Weasley's warmth.”
Minerva McGonagall
“Thank you, that means a lot to me.”
Ron suddenly swung his arm out and pointed triumphantly through a couple of people at who was unmistakably Draco Malfoy.
A few minutes of silence set in, during which Draco was simply confused at Harry’s resolution to be annoyingly stubborn and his determination in the matter. The night air was clearing Draco’s mind a bit, chasing away the alcohol-induced cloudiness in his mind. Harry’s hair had become messier than it was at the beginning of the evening, but somehow it was a comfort to Draco, to see some of the old Harry again. Those smart dress robes and the well-groomed stubble didn’t fit in with the Harry that Draco remembered. His headstrong attitude had never gone though, and he’d heard how well that trait worked out for him while he was doing his job.
Hermione huffed, “But I said that Neville, Luna, Seamus and Dean could stay with us, so they could celebrate Victoire’s birthday at the Burrow with us tomorrow.”
Teddy looked Draco up and down, then holds out his hand and Draco shakes it, “Hello Ted, it’s great to meet you. My name is Draco, we’re cousins.”
Harry's eyes slid from the contact they were holding with Malfoy’s, to the stone floor. With a witty response lacking, Malfoy’s smile fell, with eyes squinted and eyebrows creased in confusion.
He only laughed softly, nodded or shook his head to agree with his son whenever he wanted assurance and smiled, because he couldn’t help the grin his little boy always brought to his face. Astoria simply sat and listened, at first fighting the jealousy that wrenched at her heart, but it slowly subsided every time Scorpius laughed, because she knew Draco made him happy, there was always a sparkle to him whenever Draco sent a letter.
Once home, he puts his sons to bed, and after a few attempts to read a page of a book, Harry gives up and settles into sleep as well, wiped out after the day.
Finding the whole thing rather funny, Draco looked from Dean and Seamus to Harry with a growing smile, “Do they…”
Ginny, stood in the doorway, still in her pj's, red-orange hair sticking up in all directions, like the lashing flames in a fire, chuckled sleepily, followed by a yawn, "Mmh, morning to you too," she responded, stepping aside as Harry walked into the home. Ginny looked from Harry, back outside before closing the door, "No Ted?"
The next morning, with sun streaming into the flat, Harry pushed himself up to sit with a heavy groan. He stretched, but stopped mid-yawn when he failed to recognize his surroundings. He blinked a few times against the sunlight to his left, through the windows he could see the buildings of a city he couldn’t place, and when he looked around the room over the back of the sofa, he was even more confused. He reached for his wand, but realised he wasn’t wearing his jacket, which was over by the dining table. He got up, intending to retrieve it, but the headache that split its way through his head had him grabbing the sofa for support. He groaned again, and marched his way over to the dining table, where he could see through a doorway into a kitchen, where Malfoy was nonchalantly standing, coffee cup in hand, reading a newspaper. Harry’s brow creased,
“Maybe. You just proved you’re still an arsehole though.”
“Plenty of books on the subject, I’m sure.”
Ted stumbled, falling, were it not for Harry catching him, "How're you doin'?"
“You’re kidding.” was the accusation that fell from Malfoy’s lips, and Harry couldn’t help but chuckle under the circumstances.
"Didn't we?"
“Why don’t you just charm the door open?”
Wedging his hand between Draco and Seamus to push them apart, Harry shot a look that could kill at the intruder, but didn’t have a chance to say anything before Draco beat him to it, “Jog on, Finnigan.”
A few moments of silence passed, both of them lost in thoughts too intimate to tell, until finally Harry picked up on something Malfoy had said and he had overlooked at the time.
Even Eric looked shaken, raising his chin as he made steady eye contact with James.
Now there was cursing from the Gryffindors.
A loud rumbling was now coming from the cauldron, like thunder or a thousand horses hooves.
“He’s mine, I found him first! You’re not going to take him away from me!” He growled, walking around the bassinet and placing himself between them and the sleeping infant.
“Draco…you just bumped the on-button for that old vacuum cleaner. If you don’t want to fool around here, I know this part of the house is creepy. I guess I’ve gotten used to it-”
Harry had been squirming in panic, but now relaxed, recognizing his voice.
Harry’s arms crept around his neck and Draco allowed a true smile to spread across his face as he carried his love across the threshold.
! Here at Gringotts we have the most powerful magical protections in the entire world! It is most inadvisable to keep your valuable belongings in your
“Very well Mr. Malfoy. I’ll bring your suggestion to the Headmaster. In the meantime, you’re going to need a wand in each hand to keep track of them. May I suggest you recruit some of your year-mates for the task?”
Lucius looked at him in surprise.
Dumbledore suddenly was nodding off, faint snores coming from behind his beard.
“I guess it’s about time for you to eat, and I’d better get on the train so Tom doesn’t have a panic attack when it leaves.” He mused.
The most dreadful revenge Ron could possibly wreak on his mother would be, simply, growing up before she was quite ready for it.
Harry let out a breath.
And oh, how wrong that had been. The stupid Gryffindor had betrayed him where it hurt most in order to protect him from small
“Potter? Where are you?”
His eyebrows rose as his own hair lost its smooth sheen, puffing out slightly with a static charge.
This whole evil wizard business was a complete crock, he’d never done anything evil in his life.
“Very good. Now, if you could be so kind, Harry.”

“Silencio” Draco whispered, before very carefully opening the door just a crack.

“Is your invisibility cloak large enough for two?” Draco asked.
“I see are familiar with French philosophy.”
Then the encouraging tug on his magic became a suddenly greedy
Slow, hissing laughter could be heard from the throne.
“It’s easy. I
“You’ve already taken away her inheritance. Family vaults. Family heirlooms going back hundreds of generations. The family home.” Draco said flatly.
Draco smirked.
“The war…” Tom remembered.
“Kindly avoid insulting my relative and the youngest representative of the Great and Noble House, Zabini.” Draco snapped, removing the girl’s portfolio and shoving the binder onto Blaise. “I’ll be finding my cousin myself. See that the others are properly approached.”
Snape turned from Jamie to the Gryffindors with real anger in his eyes.
“Is he alright?” Tom asked, alarmed.
The two of them sat tensely, waiting for Madame Pomfrey to return with their potions. Potter had a large handkerchief clamped around his nose with one hand, covering most of his face. What Draco could see was bruised up. Pomfrey had said Draco had three bruised ribs and one of his knuckle joints had dislocated with that first punch.
Why, then?
“We’re all going to die!” Frankie moans.
, the rule had been, love for family, and only for the family, and never presume on a bond that has not yet been set in magic.
“And either must die by the hand of the other.”
Head up.
“This is Puff, he’s a dragon like Papa.” He informed the child importantly.
“Well the last one…he couldn’t undo the Langlock in time to avoid the Petrificus, and then he was vulnerable to the bodybind.” Potter said.
There was a brief scramble as they recognized Potter’s voice and moved to obey, hesitating slightly as they saw that Draco was Potter’s companion.
“Graceful as ever, Potter.”
The more disturbing thought was that the idea did not seem nearly as horrible as Draco had previously believed. Or, so said the small voice in the back of Draco’s mind. Draco wasn’t disturbed at all, at this moment.
“Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, get inside the castle!” McGonagal ordered them tensely.
Dumbledore nodded in agreement.
“And snog him.”
Draco dropped into the Malfoy mask to let his mother know he was serious.
Draco’s mind raced frantically back to that night. Harry entered the Dark Lord’s mind when he was angry or very pleased. He was only annoyed, not truly angered, when Lucius had barged in. And he’d seemed bored even when Draco had asserted control over the Malfoy lands…
“Well Edgar. There’s one of those hairy-armed older boys that is coming just for you.”
Draco lessened his grip, just slightly.
“Gentlemen, I believe we’ve gotten off subject.” Dumbledore intoned.
“Shut up, Eric! I’m telling it!” James shushed the other boy, his eyes widening as he turned back to Frankie, who was still staring at him, aghast at the picture being painted.
Especially the muggleborn witch who was apparently not only scarily competent with magical research, but was also familiar with Muggle research that could vastly enhance Potions development.
Tom carefully handed Scorpius to Jamie and turned towards Lucius, nodding towards the wide platform where the two grand staircases met against the wall and proceeding down the stairs towards it.
“Um…”
Severus Snape clasped his hands behind his back and stared placidly down his nose at his godson.
“It rejuvenates the lifter…probably takes something away from whoever you use it on. It
James patted his shoulder comfortingly.
“In light of your vows, by the powers vested in me, I pronounce you husband, and husband. You may now kiss as a token of your sealed union before all these witnesses.”
terms.
“Nothing at all.” Draco snapped.
Under “Ritual Gifts” were “Flowers, (roses appear to be the most common)”, “Chocolate candies (apparently there is a ritually significant packaging that is highly important), “Jewelry (a pattern appears to progress from non-wearable artifacts, to earings or necklaces, with the most advanced such item being a locket, and finally a ring, which is symbolic of the actual marriage proposal).
“When Bella cursed me, why did you use the killing curse?”
Harry glared at the older students.
“Just because I’m on your side doesn’t mean I’ve stopped my scheming. Now stop asking questions about your gift, it’s very improper.”
“It would. It’s very old magic.”
There was another rustling noise. More wind?
As it was, aside from the controversial pin…and the unfortunate
“I’ve snooped on him already. He’s on the fast track to friendship with Cloud Zabini.”
“He’ll bring it RIGHT down on your face, feathers flying everywhere!” he shouted enthusiastically.
“Only a little, look I’ll go easy on you so you can see.”
“Arthur,” Draco nearly choked with surprise as the man’s first name rolled off his tongue. Of course. The spell would force them to use each other’s first names except in formal ceremonies. “you
“It sounds like we’re in all Muggle places for our honeymoon. So, we can be as anonymous as we want. How does that sound?”
Thomas Marvelo Riddle, an aging but nonetheless handsome wizard, stood on a pedestal with his advisors clustered around him. Draco noticed Lucius at his right hand. The members of the Wizengamut, and a throng of people stood below the pedestal listening eagerly to whatever he was saying.
In the doorway was a tall, lanky man with dark greasy hair, wand trained on him and a very dangerous look on his face.
“That’s-”
Mr. Zabini’s eyes went wide at that.
“Call them off!”
Draco approached Harry’s disembodied head and reached towards where he knew his waist would be.
Draco crossed to his father and took the bag, turning to face Harry.
“Thank you, Blaise.” He said softly, so only his friend could hear.
Draco did
“So. This is the best you’re going to get from me.” Potter said simply.
But how to tell if Potter
Harry looked at him searchingly.
“Anyways, the alihotsy and scarab take a while to react. In those amounts, and with only one-seventh of it stirred the same direction as scarab, a good ten hours or so.” Draco assured him. “You’ll want to make yourself puke after class, of course, to make sure it’s not still in your stomach.”
The powerful spells keeping his hair beautiful and perfectly in place had worked during that entire time, even with the magical explosion of their bonding. But he had no idea if it would have held up to Bellatrix’s use of Dark magic on him. Or…perhaps more likely…Madame Pomfrey could have removed his grooming charms to avoid cross-interferences with healing spells.
“She’s faxing your supplies list right now.” He informed his father, just as the phone gave a warning flash, and Draco deftly caught the rolled-up parchment that had been apparated right in front of him.
“You saw James’ Runespoor and you fainted.”
And…that soup
but him to know. That he was going to such lengths to keep
Flint took the hint and, with another formal bow, returned to his circle of classmates.
Draco dropped him, going suddenly cold. He pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and calmly wiped the spittle from his cheek.
“Heating Up Your Sex Life”…promised for some
The lawyers had barely left when he heard his mother’s soft knock on the door.
As you wish.
“You look…perfect. Don’t change anything.”
“Even you can’t deny blood-relation matters when you’re talking about old
The ceremony was small and simple. The two young men stood face to face atop a grassy knoll, the priest behind them bracketed by the setting sun.
Tom’s eyes narrowed.
Draco could almost hear the protective thoughts churning through her mind now. To back out of a negotiated marriage at this late stage was controversial at best, and with Draco’s current level of emotional investment, intolerably cruel.
“No, he’s right Harry. She’s an exiled pureblood, her relatives are in charge of bringing her up in the Wizarding World until she’s of age. If it weren’t for Malfoy they’d revert to females and it’d be Bellatrix in charge of her.” Weasley told his friend.
Draco seated himself at the Slytherin table, making room for Jaime at his side.
“Do you promise to never cast an Unforgivable Curse again?” she asked.
Or maybe it was his imagination.
“Yes. I know who you are, young man. What are you doing in my house?”
Shacklebolt turned from Dumbledore to Draco in surprise, before blurting out his next question.
Weasley nodded begrudgingly, recognizing the formality. Potter on the other hand was clearly not happy with the arrangement.
He took the Exploding Snap box and stacked it on top of the card that represented a bed on the end.
“Harry knows perfectly well where he stands with me, and he’s the only one who needs to. Now, is he in there, or am I going to have to start torturing random Gryffindors for the password to the tower?”
“Potter was the one getting to accept his own proposal, which was something he’d always wished for anyways. Trust me, I know him quite well. He’ll never sign a betrothal contract for Jamie. He’ll let her choose someone on her own.”
“Draco…you’ve been doing your hair all day! Can we go now?”
“God, Draco. Don’t tempt me! I promised them I’d stay far, far away!”
“Which in this case, would release an unusually potent alihotsy-scarab bomb. Which would have been prevented from exploding properly for quite a while, due to the thickness of the Glumbumble coating. And would therefore have continued to meld with the
“Back to yourself, Potter?”
Draco paused dramatically.
“Ah!”
“I…no I don’t think so.”
Harry obeyed and pulled out a note.
Blaise tapped their joined hands with his wand, clearing his throat.
“I wanted to let you know I’m planning to bond with Potter tonight.” Draco informed him. “I hope you have your portkey?”
Deputy Headmistress McGonagall paused as excited chatter sprung up amongst the students.
“Kreacher will keep Master Draco’s secrets!”
impressive. Molly must be very proud.” Draco started off.
Regulus wiped at his eyes, furious at having been caught crying, and regarded the speaker.
exactly on speaking terms, Potter.” Draco reminded him.
Draco nodded. This was as close to a blessing a Dark wizard was going to get from the old man.
“Got it Malfoy. You just try to catch the Snitch for once, yeah?”
“I see. And what is the intention behind this power play?”
The sharp smell of Harry’s seed hit Draco’s nostrils and, on impulse, he quickly unbuttoned his own pants and stroked himself once, twice, three times and then he was also spraying his seed all over Harry’s half-naked body, over his bedsheets, marking the place where he slept.
Draco looked at his mother blankly for a moment. Finally he relented.
Potter obeyed, they turned, catching each other in almost a waltz position, and Draco shivered as he felt the singe of a spell flying past his ear – Potter casting a powerful Expelliarmus at a Death Eater that had appeared behind him.
“~~There are several, why would they be in our pocket if they were not for snakes?~~”
“I’m giving the Black estate to Jamie.” Potter said.
“Sssooo. It is now
was shown to a close ally like Blaise by
Or so Draco had planned. And so Draco had determined. Of course, that decision had been based on incomplete information. It had based on a…well…in all honesty a rather foolish assumption that sexual play with Harry Potter would be just a better version of the sexual play he’d enjoyed with Pansy, as well as with the various desireable Slytherins of both genders, since he’d first come into his pubescent desire for such things.
“Alright Potter?” Draco asked in his lowest voice, this time letting just his lips pull slightly at the shell of Potter’s ear, as if it had merely been in his way when he opened his mouth to speak. Potter shuddered, and Draco allowed his erection to bump into Potter’s backside once again.
? For almost killing me?”
Finally Potter broke the silence.
“Now what do you see?”
. There are a lot of wands out there, especially going back into the past. We’ll find out what this is, and we’ll deal with it if it’s a threat, okay?”
Potter started to turn, but Draco latched on to him, holding him fast.
“Excuse me?”
How could he have been so completely mindless?
“That’s a horribly rude thing to say, Regulus! You’re lucky P-Papa didn’t hear you or you’d be writing even
Ron and Granger were next, hugging Harry exuberantly while sending evil looks in Draco’s direction.
“But your guardians are the Potter-Malfoys!” Greengrass gasped, clearly awed. From the emphasis on the second old family, it was clear his surprise had nothing to do with Harry’s known talent as a Parselmouth, himself.
“Yeah, well you tricked me into it.”
we won’t be able to say the same about any of you.” Draco said severely.
He waited, an eyebrow raised. His father nodded his apology and Draco formed the Intent that would cause the phone to connect to Granger’s personal line.
“It seems quite unnecessary. I see no reason to make a gift of what is only needed for a few years at most.”
“But why not Gryffindor? Your father was a Gryffindor, you know.” Dumbledore seemed perplexed.
“Yes. I am your cousin. And…wizards and witches take family very seriously. Do you know what it means to be a Black, Jamie?” Draco told her.
“Excuse me? You mean…wait…are you trying to say that they have to practice ‘safe-sex’?” Granger asked incredulously.
Draco just looked at the two lawyers.
“Remus will still smell it, you know.”
“Anything to add, Mr. Malfoy?”
“Troublemakers.” Draco cut off the rosy picture Potter was trying to paint abruptly. “They’re the grand masters of chaos and consternation. They exist to thumb their noses at authority and propriety.”
Not that Draco would stoop to such a common ritual. For a union of three powerful families as Malfoy, Potter, and Black, nothing less than the royal traditions of heirloom, magic, and blood would be appropriate.
His mother nodded, the message received.
“I don’t want to be a…an idiot,” Jamie informed him. Draco smiled approvingly.
Draco shrugged.
Potter huffed and crossed his arms.
, of all things!
Draco allowed his hand to slide a few inches forward, his thumb caressing back and forth on the inside of Harry’s thigh. Harry dropped his fork with a gratifyingly clumsy-sounding clatter. The leg was burning against his hand through the fabric of Potter’s trousers, a burning pleasure that was nearly painful. Draco continued his narrative in a softer voice.
“Aahhhhhh!”
The pawn.
Draco ignored him, focusing in on Harry.
“I know who he’s betrothed to.”
Frankie frowned.
As a distraction technique, it was brilliant and entirely effective, a small Slytherin portion of his brain noted, as Draco’s body eagerly made its way up the creaky stairway to the second floor, padding along to until he found the door the werewolf indicated.
He took another deep breath, searching with his eyes.
Chuckling with a muggleborn. What is the world coming to?
“We’re having…
“Why you…you can’t
“Matrimonius extremis.” Draco managed to incant, just before…
Scorpius.” Draco told him. “We know you aren’t evil, but we won’t risk the life of our son. If your existence itself is a threat to him, I will do what is necessary.”
“What?”
Draco took that horrible limb and forced it near his own face. Grimacing. He had a strong stomach, even this wasn’t enough. He put two fingers in his mouth. The taste of his own oozing flesh did it for him.
“I think that’s enough, gentlemen.” Dumbledore agreed. “Are you satisfied that Mr. Malfoy is innocent?”
“Is it done?” he asked.
“Okay, we’ll have to actually make a working potion…lets see…sneezewort, scurvy-grass, and lovage are the inflammants…alihotsy and glumbumble counterbalance each other to impede the brain processes…jobberknoll and scarab effects inverted by dragon blood and hellebore…sopohorus…hmm…”
“Like a raging lion.” Draco mused.
“Oh.” Potter said again.
“So… they can understand you? When you tell them to do things, they’ll do it?”
“I…he…he seems nice. But Draco-”
“Tom has had some trouble with the wand you gave him. Or perhaps I should say…wands.” Harry added, pulling the familiar length of Yew from his inner pocket. Tom produced a similar wand from his own pocket.
“Now Harry, we don’t need to encourage Jamie to be rude to adults. Even portraits.”
Draco smirked.
“You suggest an attack?”
A white graceful hand laid calmly against the cool grain of the wood, it opened.
“To arrange for part of a betrothal gift.”
“You speak.”
Tom decided the boy was interesting. He drew carefully on the pureblood social skills Draco had drilled into him over the last few months.
“Black! Welcome to Gryffindor! I’ve been hearing you and James are a really formidable pair with the Beater’s bats – are you planning to try out for the team next year?”
There was now an unmistakeable growling of constant thunder coming from the cauldron. Draco dragged himself wearily to his feet. The inside of the cauldron was a constant staccato of flashes as chain lightning bounced between the walls of the cauldron.
Harry frowned in worry as James was sorted into Hufflepuff. Neither twin looked happy at being separated, and no surprise. The two hadn’t been separated since their birth, the only time he could think of that they’d been separated even for a moment was when Regulus had been presented to the Black family magic as the new heir.
Draco opened the parchment that contained his essay on the Confusing and Befuddlement Drought for a quick review. Yes, the full recipe
Rose petals were strewn artistically all along the table, and a single long-stemmed rose with its thorns intact lay long-wise in the very center.
“No. It’s at Gri-, ugh. It’s at Sirius’ house.”
you I didn’t want to have sex in public, Draco!”
“Anyone interesting among those?”
At that moment, his interrogation was interrupted by the entrance of the massive flock of owls. Draco rescued his toast as the Daily Prophet dropped down in front of him.
Weasley reached for the package only to recoil as one of the swans snapped at his hand.
“Okay, so what do you have in mind then?”
“You aren’t seeing everything. You see the wand above the water, and you see its reflection in the water. You don’t see the wand in the water, nor
Draco took a large step to his left and pivoted counterclockwise, sweeping his vision from right to left as he turned, disarming a Death Eater as he turned.
“We’ll need him as a bonder, Professor.” Draco said smoothly.

“Very well, I’ll respect your secrets, Draco. Prepare yourself please.”

This time, as he entered the Room of Requirement, there were no mats or training dummies. Instead, a maze of shelves, assorted junk, and, near one wall, a half-repaired Vanishing Cabinet.
“Domare Ilixa Inuito!”
Draco didn’t answer.
“No, that’s purple. Red or blue if the magic has decided the gender, yet.” He objected. “Did you use an unorthodox scrying charm on my
“What?”
Draco held up his hand.
“I so swear.” A third line of magical fire swirled around Draco’s wrist and then they sunk into his skin, where he felt them buzzing for a moment before the sensation faded.
“That’s a disgusting remnant of a patriarchal concept of institutionalized possessiveness!” Granger sniffed in disgust. “If there’s no option to end the marriage, it becomes an involuntary situation and you’ll both feel trapped in it.”
“I mean. The roses. And now…
“Where we’ve rented you a tidy bungalow on the beach!”
Draco smirked knowingly at the Gryffindor.
Draco ignored the savage “If you do, I’ll break every bone in your body” from Ron.
Draco smirked in amusement.
“Why thank you, Mr. Malfoy! Oh my, I never thought I’d see the day…go! Go on, the two of you, end this horrid feud foolishness now!”
Lucius emptied his stomach into the bathroom sink.
Potter was squirming deliciously now, barely able to move in Nagini’s secure hold on his wrists and ankles.
Draco held a finger to his lips and led him to the dungeons.
The Gryffindor was clearly jealous.
Draco smirked.
“You would have me claim him assss my heir, young Lord Malfoy. Train him up as a Dark Prince?”
“I would never…Draco…how can you say that?”
[We recognize the Head of the House of Malfoy as Draco Malfoy]
! I love it when they fight!” Fenrir giggled, back on his feet, and Draco raised his wand defensively as something nastier than usual shone in his eyes.
“Nonsense! As long as the boundaries of the contracts, and the state of technical virginity is guarded by appropriate spells, I see no reason to interfere with their exploration. I do most certainly approve of the limit of two guests per prefect, however…that should keep your…

The light flush in his cheeks darkened and spread slightly.
Ah yes. Potter’s fetish. No doubt Potter was quite hard right now under his robes, only inches from Draco’s very fingertips. Draco thought back to that Pensieve memory, he knew Potter’s erection would be nut-brown, with a vein of purple running up the underside, the pink head just peeking out the opening of-
Harry shook his head as if to shake himself free from these memories and their constricting grip on him.
With one hand he combed his fingers through the messy mop of hair that was equally beaded with sweat, the other free hand found him turning the faucet of a sink in front of him. Draco attempted to wash his face to cool down, but stopped as he looked up at his reflection, if you could even call it that, in the blurry mirror. Eyes red, face thin due to his lack of eating these days, skin grey...
"I don't really know one..." Harry said, flushing with embarrassment.
"Where are we going?" Draco asked when they reached the doors leading out to the grounds of Hogwarts. They had practically run from their dorms and Draco was a little out of breath.
"Only partially. We haven't had a ball for a while, you can imagine why. I can't say I miss them though."
"I- what?!" Harry practically shouted, rushing over to the mirror on the wall, trying to ignore the snickering from Dean and Ron looking at him like he had a third head. "Shit," Harry muttered as he recognized the slight bruise on his neck right above his collarbone where his shirt covered it. It was slightly faded but still recognizable and he started to flush. How had he not noticed it?!
Almost everyone except the Slytherin's cheered as Gryffindor won and Cooper descended to the ground to be surrounded by her teammates.
"Hey! I can bathe myself!" Draco said, suddenly embarrassed.
"Hey! Not my fault you had been avoiding me!"
"You woulda thought he had a missing limb by the way they all looked at him! Parading around him like a spectacle like that!" Ron groaned as they sat down, drawing the blinds to the windows.
"Uh, it's like a list of things you want to do before you die."
When they all got back to Ron's room after lunch Hermione immediately rounded on him, "Tell me everything!"
Millicent Bulstrode — beater
"Harry," Ron said rushing up to him, Hermione following behind, "we tried to help we really did. But no one would-"
"You guys got to help me find a girlfriend!" Pansy said over Draco's complaining.
"Oh come off it Malfoy, you know what I mean," Harry said, speeding up and stopping in front of Draco, making him pause. "Are we really going to spend the whole year like this."
While Draco was internally panicking, Harry was glaring over at Lavender. He wanted to proclaim that he and Draco were done playing, then and there, but he knew that if he said something, Hermione was bound to question him about it later. So, he sat quietly steaming as Lavender leaned over and pressed her lips hungrily to Draco's.
“Are you going to sit next to us today?” Harry asked, keeping his voice low even though he had no idea why. He felt like talking too loud would break the calm between them and he didn’t want to do that.
"Oh, I'm serious," Seamus said as Dean buried his head in his free hand, "we are."
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, sitting down across from Draco.
"I love you too."
When they reached the outskirts of Hogwarts Harry let go of Draco's hand unwillingly and they both felt a little disappointed.
Harry felt himself smile, grabbing the parchment to write back.
"Alright, I won't keep you, thanks again for your help."
Draco felt him shift again and put his hands to the hem of Draco's shirt and tried to pull it up.
------------------------
“Now I’m just a bit nervous about who did it. You know? It stresses me out that they still haven’t figured that out,” Harry said, not noticing the way Draco fidgeted with his hands and kept his eyes on his drink.
Harry knew she was just joking, but it still made his stomach flip a little uneasily.
"Well, they'd serve as an excellent distraction don't you think?" Draco said and a wide smile crawled it's way across Harry's face.
-----------------------
This distraction was caused by Harry and Draco sending each other awkward looks the entire time and seemingly avoiding each other. It didn't help the tension between them that everyone was staring ether and an hour into practice Harry decided to call an end for the day.
“Hey, are you going with anyone to the Yule Ball?” Harry asked, proud of himself when he didn’t sound nearly as nervous as he felt.
"Yeah, you're one to talk, Draco. At least the rest of us have admitted we're gay and you're still just sitting there pretending to be straight," Pansy replied.
"Well you two obviously weren't going to say something and the tension was getting annoying!" Pansy replied crossing her arms and chuckling at Draco's flabbergasted look.
----------------------------
Will they react terribly? Harry wondered, taking a bite of his own eggs. He vaguely wondered if they'd poisoned them, but decided that it might be worse to not eat them or spit them back out. Scratch that, they'll definitely react terribly, Harry thought, the question is how terribly. Like we're about to both die, terribly, or Draco's about to get disowned, terribly.
-----------------------------
-----------------------------
"What? What's wrong-"
Harry took a bite of his sandwich and Ginny leaned over to whisper in his ear, "With a 'friend' huh?" Ginny smirked at him and Harry blushed lightly. "We both know who you were really with."
"Not a clue," Harry mumbled, pushing his food around his plate. The fact that going with Draco even crossed his mind had him a bit stressed now.
"People change," Harry shrugged.
"Yeah," Harry responded feeling slightly awkward. It had been months since the war and he still hadn't asked her out again, it just hadn't felt right. Harry had thought about it, and in all honesty, he felt as though he didn't really ever like her. Sure, he cared about her, loved her even, but just not like that; which then got him thinking about other girls he liked and realized the only other one had been Cho, which had been a whole mess on it's own, and he felt as though he might have never liked her either. That had him thinking again and he wondered why he ever felt like he liked her and ended up with a whole other conclusion that he might have wanted to be with her simply because Cedric Diggory had dated her, which brought up a whole other existential crisis that he decided he didn't want to think about while sleeping on the floor of Ron's bedroom.
Breakfast continued with Harry thinking silently and Seamus and Dean shooting him nervous glances, he figured he should probably talk to them later.
"Yeah, but you won't ask your crush out. At least I tried."
Ron stared after him, a thoughtful expression on his face.
Blaise cleared his throat, trying to break some of the tension in the air and gain his composure. He quickly picked up the bottle and gave it a spin.
They all stood out on the lawn three minutes to midnight as George finished setting up the fireworks. Hermione was standing between Harry and Ron, dressed in one of his jumpers. Even with heating charms, they could still feel the cold.
"We were thinking we should all have another party this Friday after classes. You two should come too," Dean said, gesturing to Luna and Ginny.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Nobody?" Harry finally asked looking at Ron. He found it slightly hard to believe that absolutely no one wanted to room with him and would rather room with Slytherins.
Pomfrey stared at him a moment, looking slightly surprised. Okay, definitely not normal, Harry thought. "Glowing?"
"So we're on a first name basis now?"  Malfoy said, smirking.
He felt like he was going a little crazy.
"Ugh!" Draco's sudden appearance startled Harry and he groaned when he hit his head on the shelf above him. "What does it look like I'm doing? I'm looking for the leaves." Harry rubbed the back of his head as Draco rolled his eyes at him.
"Well yeah, I mean, I'd have to be dumb to not realize it after that scene you put on with Parkinson earlier."
"Just because I said I'd kiss him out of everyone in the circle, doesn't mean I like him. It only means he was the least repulsive out of the group."
---------------------------
Before Harry could even think about it, he was agreeing and Draco was sitting down next to him - rather closely - and getting some looks from other students.
"What is the best compliment?"
"Oh thank goodness you're awake," Harry could see Madam Pomfrey bustling around him through the haze currently fogging his vision. "How are you feeling?"
"Oh good, that was fast," Madam Pomfrey said when Harry entered the hospital wing. "I have some more information on the potion that you'll probably be happy to hear. Snape has been trying to figure out when it'll wear off, and it seems like it will only take three moon cycles. Meaning, the effects will wear off on New Years day at precisely 7:51pm."
"Why would I care when Potter will get here," Draco said with a slight scowl, but it didn't deter Seamus. If anything, it seemed to edge him on.
I was wondering if you wanted to meet up just after midnight on New Years? My parents usually go to bed right after the clock strikes midnight. They have a toast and then go straight to bed, so I was thinking it'd be the perfect chance to see each other? If you can get away that is.
"So? Everyone deserves second chances. He hasn't done a single thing wrong this whole year so far, and has been nice as far as nice goes for him. He's been nice to you right, Harry?"
“Nah, that one I could see,” Ron said and Harry turned to gape at him, “What? You two are always together and hanging all over each other. Like you’re a pair of magnets.”
The whole thing gave him a headache and he had no idea why.
"I didn't talk about him all the time!" Draco said indignantly, trying to save his dignity.
“No way, are you for real? Does he actually like you?”
"Ron, leave it. Tryouts are over, let's go back inside," Harry said trying to grab Ron's arm and drag him away from Blaise, but Ron just shook him off.
"Okay," Draco said, not making any move to leave Harry's arms.
"It wasn't even a long one, it was rather short for a Quidditch match actually," Ron said.
"Who would try to ruin the potion?" Draco said as they made their way back to the dorms, "It just doesn't make any sense."
"I don't know what you mean, we haven't fought in days."
Thirdly, what is the wizarding world's opinion on homosexuality? This was probably the most puzzling. He could remember all the times Vernon would yell about people engaging in immoral acts and how "all those fags are going to burn hell!" Harry couldn't picture a society where homosexuality was a normal thing, he supposed he should probably look into it since he was part of that world now.
"I know what the colors mean."
"One on personality or something I've worked hard at, you know?" Hermione said, "Something that isn't based on looks."
Sunday Draco sat at the Gryffindor table with the rest of the Slytherin trio for the welcome back feast. He was holding hands proudly with Harry and he could hear people talking about them through the hall, but for once he couldn't care less.
"But he-" Draco started as he got off the ground, but was cut off by a firm look from McGonagall.
December 22, 1998
"Yep, and you better. I deserve it, you slept all day."
"Who's the special bloke? Is he in your grade?" George asked.
"Great!" Dean said happily, and turned back toward the board.
"You know though, the face you made when I yelled was kind of cute," Harry said with a small smile.
They all seemed to go quiet for a moment, the information sinking in.
Harry leaned in towards Draco's ear, "Wish we weren't in the middle of the great hall, or I'd kiss you."
"Oh I must've forgotten, sorry 'bout that," Ron said.
----------------------------
Harry picked up the bottle hesitantly and it landed on Draco.
"Draco, we're not going to break you up," Narcissa said, reaching out and placing her hand over his on the table.
Ron looked at Harry's neck too then and his face reddened.
"Like I'll ever get along with him," Draco scoffed, walking back to his bed to pick up his book and return it to his bookshelf.
Harry was thankful he liked him, he didn't want to be in any more trouble.
Draco led Harry to the gate where he'd be able to apparate from. "I'll see you when we get back to school," Draco said, pulling Harry into a quick hug.
Harry stopped him by pressing his lips back against Draco's and Draco soon lost himself in the kiss and let his hands trail a line of fire down to the waistband of Harry's underwear. Hooking his fingers under the waistband, he yanked them down and off; Harry shifted to let him do so.
"It's not," Harry said, flopping back down next to Draco, "Hermione just overreacts a bit. It'd really only be dangerous if we had someone like Voldemort trying to get into the castle again, but anyone who'd try that are pretty much all in Azkaban and don't have enough power to try anyway."
"Truth," Neville said and hoped it was the right decision. It evidently wasn't as her smirk spread wider if that was even possible.
Ginny let out a sigh, letting her head flop into her hands. "I sent a letter to my parents finally, telling them about Luna... about our relationship."
Blaise only laughed when this sent Draco stammering again, trying to deny it.
"You were actually serious about that?" Draco asked, "I thought you'd forgotten about it actually."
"Don't worry no one is around to hear," Ginny said laughing.
Ron seemed to find that completely irrelevant though and immediately went to asking the first thing that popped into his head, “Did you kiss him back?”
“Unless it’s me,” Ron made a face, “I’d freak out if he liked me. Or ‘Mione.” Harry and Hermione both just stared at him. “What?! Don’t you think that would be super weird?”
The day after Christmas felt really lazy. Harry woke up after eleven and was met with an almost silent house. He could hear Molly Weasley Bustling around the kitchen downstairs preparing some sort of food.
"What the-" Draco heard Pansy's voice from below but neither Harry nor Draco stopped.
"Lunch doesn't start for another hour. Go get the blankets and leave the food to me," Harry laughed, already slipping his shoes on to sneak down to the kitchens. Draco watched him go, wondering where on earth he was headed to.
-----------------------------
“Ugh, please don’t tell me you ran away after that,” Hermione groaned, rubbing her face with her hands.
"Oh he's definitely a closet case," she giggled, "And dense too."
"No one seems to like what house they're being placed in this year," Harry finally said after the fifth person to be placed somewhere other than Gryffindor looked longingly after the Gryffindors.
"What's your favorite candy?" Harry asked as soon as they entered the shop.
"Let's just go Ron. If we leave now we can go do something together," Hermione said. By the look Hermione was giving Ron, he was sure he didn't want to know what 'do something together meant' but it did the trick, Ron seemed to edge up a bit.
The first Quidditch practice was set for that afternoon and Harry knew that Draco would be there. He was dreading it. Especially since practices had been set for Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays, meaning Harry would have to see Draco three times a week.
"As you all know, we have eighth years for the first time this year, and as such accommodations have been made. At the end of the feast, all eighth years please follow Madam Hooch to your dormitories and they have been combined this year. For the sake of keeping with the theme of inter-house unity this year, you will be allowed to choose your roommate. Though some rules apply: you may not room with someone of the opposite gender and your roommate needs to be someone of a different house. Now, enjoy the feast." Groans rang out at the news of having to room with someone from another house, but they quickly settled down at the sight of food.
"I mean he's friends with more than- wait what?! You did this?!" Draco practically shouted, getting a very stern look from Madam Pince but he didn't much care. "I can't believe you did that!"
Draco picked up the bottle and gave it a spin. The bottle spun and everyone watched as it slowed to a stop, pointing at Blaise who was seated next to Draco.
"Yes. I've got to do something interesting before I leave the school."
If Draco saw the deep blush coating Harry's cheeks, he didn't comment, just let his eyes continue to trail over names.
“You can’t freak out if I tell you okay?” Harry said, mostly to Ron.
"Draaaco."
And don't worry, I'll be safe.
But Harry was covering Draco's hand with his own and he didn't look like he was going to be taking off or berating him for his feelings any time soon.
Harry smiled at the use of his name. They'd been doing more and more things other than homework during their punishments lately, and as a result, Draco had been calling him Harry more. He loved the sound of his name on his tongue.
Harry had to stifle a laugh as Ron sat down. Ginny handed Ron the bottle with a smirk and Ron spun it a little harder than he needed to.
"Nothing much," Harry said and Draco raised an eyebrow at him. "It was something personal that she's dealing with." Harry let out a sigh, Draco was awfully nosy.
Monday morning came and it was awkward to say the least, they both avoided each other as they got ready and for once Harry was the first out of the dorm.
"But you don't think that's it."
“Yeah, good thing too or I would’ve had to come get you. Now, come on,” Draco said, lacing their fingers together and dragging him out the doors and out into the winter air.
It was now a few hours to summer break though, and Draco and Harry decided it might be time to share their relationship status to Hermione and Ron, lest they start asking questions about why Draco was now living with Harry. But, after that their plans consisted of leaving to the beach for a few weeks to escape the press and reporters that were bound to come, if only for a couple more weeks.
"I haven't."
Pansy swatted at his leg playfully, "I'm not a player. Just because girls actually like me doesn't make me a player."
"No problem," Seamus gave her a thumbs up as they walked away to sit down.
"Whatever do you mean Potter?" Draco said, walking slightly ahead of Harry.
Hermione just gave him a we both know that is bullshit look in response.
"They've been hanging out around each other so much lately, and they obviously like each other. The better question is how didn't you know," Hermione laughed a bit.
"Erm- no one,"
"Oh! Before you go, I heard people are starting a ton of new clubs this year. You know, school unity and all that jazz. But the point is, there's going to be a fair-like thing on Sunday for all the clubs. Want to join Crabbe, Blaise and I? I suppose it's worth checking out. Plus I heard there's gonna be food and stuff."
"Mmm," Harry groaned, flipping over, "Gimmie a few minutes."
“Yeah, but I’m on time!”
"Really?" Draco asked, heart feeling like it was about to beat out of his chest.
“Any special reason you’ve picked out such a nice restaurant?” Draco smirked over his menu at Harry, he had a feeling he knew where this night was going. Harry’s face reddened and Draco knew he’d guessed right.
"What are you thinking about?" Draco asked after a moment of comfortable silence and then suddenly wished he hadn't.
Standing up too, Harry said, "We could still make the class if we go now, a scourgify would be good enough to clean up."
Draco and Harry found themselves seated in front of McGonagall's desk in a matter of minutes. McGonagall gave them both a disappointed look as they stared at their shoes.
Harry flushed, as he realized Ron had come to the same conclusion he had: Draco was in love. He could only pray he didn't realize with whom.
“Well, I had no idea how you’d react, to be honest, and it’s not like either of you like him much.”
"That's good, I was worried when you collapsed," Draco said. Harry looked over at him; his head was down and he had a look in his eyes Harry couldn't quite place. The look made him feel oddly bad and he reached his hand out, fingers grazing Draco's before grabbing his hand and giving a gentle squeeze.
"We should talk," Ron said after watching Harry and Draco sprint off up the stairs. He'd have time to wonder about that later, right now he was curious about Hermione.
"Is what bad?" Harry asked taking a bite of the sandwich he'd been pushing around his plate.
"Truth," Hermione replied.
Harry only glared at him and then seemed to get an idea, "I was thinking we should do the prank on Filch tonight. Our first match as the eighth year team is this weekend and having fireworks for after the match would be pretty cool."
"Really? But you went to the Yule Ball together."
"Oh not much, they just wanted to say good game and I said their team would do fine against Hufflepuff."
Harry rolled his eyes, "I can prep myself if you'd rather."
Looking down, he realized why: Draco was laying across his arm. Harry hadn't realized he'd fallen asleep in Draco's bed last night. Instead of trying to turn over, Harry just mushed his face into the back of Draco's neck, letting out a contented sigh as he caught the scent of Draco's shampoo. Harry slipped an arm around Draco's waist, pulling him closer to himself and Draco started to stir.
Draco cautiously took a seat next to Harry and felt very self conscious as people started to filter into the room and some looked over at the group confused.
"I suppose."
Harry continued to eat his dinner as Hermione and Ron dived into a conversation about classes and how Ron hadn't done his homework.
Their food and butterbeers came eventually after a bit of Harry pointing out different people and commenting on the colors. No one had a new color though.
"Dare," Draco grumbled, figuring it couldn't be too bad.
Lavender offered to go first and with a spin of the bottle, the first pair was picked to be Lavender and Goyle. Lavender got up to sit in front of Goyle, after a bit of complaining. Almost as soon as it started, Goyle pulled away. It's not that he didn't think she was pretty or anything, but the idea of kissing someone was very unappealing and he pulled back after a couple seconds.
“I bet the grounds of Hogwarts will be covered in snow by tomorrow,” Harry said, glancing over at Draco.
"The room can provide decorations if you ask for it, I'm sure," Harry said.
"You have a hickey, mate," Dean said, snickering.
Pansy laughed as she shrugged off her top and dropped it next to herself, "You're a prude." She picked up the bottle then and spun it. Harry watched as Draco's expression turned into one of nervousness as the bottle spun, because Pansy was the one with the bottle it meant that they were probably about to be targeted if it landed on them. It landed on Blaise though, and both boys let out a quiet sigh of relief.
Ron let out a laugh, "Yeah, I know. I know it was only a game. You're allowed to have fun."
"And what makes you think I would want to play with you."
The gesture made Draco freeze. His head was spinning as he stared at Harry's outstretched hand. Should he accept? Before he even had a chance to contemplate it Harry was already talking again.
"Shit," Draco said, scrambling to get up, class had started 15 minutes ago.
"I do not sound or act like that!" Draco shouted, shoving her over.
"You think he saw anything?" Draco said, looking nervously up at Harry from the floor.
"Denser than stone!" Blaise cried.
"So, are you two on a date too?" Neville asked and Blaise snickered. Both Harry and Draco blushed bright red.
"Happy New Years Eve! You're staying until school starts back up again I assume?"
"I'm with Zacharias Smith, who is still kinda a dick but he's okay I suppose, and Seamus got the only decent option: Ernie MacMillian," Dean said, leaning in to join the conversation.
He also liked being with Ron.
Harry quickly jerked his eyes back to his textbook, the last thing he wanted was to get caught staring at Draco, especially if he was caught by Draco. Harry did not want to make it any more awkward than it already was, Draco could not find out how he was feeling. So Harry would continue to only watch him silently.
"Mmhmm," Harry mumbled, watching Draco walk up the stairs. "Here can you hold this for a moment Ron? I've gotta make sure he doesn't chuck my things out the window or something," Harry handed his cake slice off to Ron and then rushed up the stairs as fast as his body would let him.
"What was it supposed to do?" Draco asked, head spinning slightly from the alcohol.
"Hey, didn't know you came up," Harry said, walking over to his trunk to get clothes to change into.
"Yeah Yeah," Harry laughed, sliding down to lay his head on Draco's shoulder with a contented sigh. He felt Draco lay his head down on top of his own and they slipped into a comfortable silence.
"Took ya long enough," Ron said with a smirk as Harry entered, "What did the Ravenclaw captain have to say?"
"It'll grow out, but whatever spell Seamus used was a strong one," Hermione imputed, "Even McGonagall couldn't get it completely out."
"Our NEWTS of course," Hermione said like it was obvious, "and you should be studying too. They're coming up and I imagine you haven't even started making flash cards."
"Making that creepy grin," Ron replied and Blaise's grin turned into a scowl.
It had been a month since Draco agreed to date Harry for real and Harry couldn't have been any happier. Even besides them dating, things had been going great. The eighth-year quidditch team had won against Gryffindor on Saturday, his grades had improved greatly with Draco's help, and he'd been having the most enjoyable year at Hogwarts so far. No crazy guy after him, no arch nemesis constantly bullying him, no weird mysteries to solve, and no insane tournaments to get volunteered for unwillingly.
"I said you two have been getting along quite well lately."
Draco wasn't able to say anything, his throat felt tight. His world was crumbling around him. I screwed up, was the only thought running through his head. Running on repeat.
"And why do you say it like that?"
"Pipe down Weasley," Pansy replied coolly, "that's part of the game. If it was that big of a deal, then they can just take a shot." Ron glared at her.
It was Halloween and there was to be a party in the eighth year dorms. Dean and Seamus were in charge of bringing alcohol as they seemed to be the best at sneaking unbelievable amounts of alcohol into Hogwarts. The party was supposed to start in ten minutes and Harry was lounging lazily in the corner of the room watching out across the common room as Pansy went through the alcohol piled on the table in a way that she seemed to think wasn't suspicious. Harry figured she would be tipsy before the party even started.
“And then he asked me if I was going with anyone!” Draco complained to Pansy back in her room after the Quidditch match, “He asked me that while literally holding my hand!”
“Then, yeah, I’ll sit with you.”
Draco laughed, pulling Harry into a hug, “You really are an idiot sometimes you know? Of course I’ll go with you.”
"Well, no... but it'd be fun."
Harry felt his face heat up as he realized that Draco had in fact noticed that he'd been staring at him.
"Well that was unexpected," Pansy said as she pulled her own books out of her bag.
"Shit," Harry said when he woke up the next day, Draco curled up against his chest, on the floor of the astronomy tower. They were definitely late for class if the sun shining brightly against his eyes was anything to go by.
They stayed silent for a moment, wrapped up in each other’s arms when Draco suddenly pulled back, “Wait a minute, do you even know how to dance?”
“Maybe he was really a Squib.”
“~~The two-leg disturbs us with its inharmonious noises.~~”
“Draco! What happened?”
“Um. I’m sorry I almost killed you.”
“I was not unhappy.”
“You skipped getting to sleep with me, in between some of those meals.” Harry pouted.
“I’ll be seeing you then, Bill.”
“Red hair. Yeah.”
“I did
Draco barely dodged it, finding the prospect of bodily harm curiously undaunting as the heavy thing loomed over him for that moment before he stumbled to the side, his robes gusting around him with the whoosh of air as the falling thing slammed into the ground inches from where he knelt.
the blood-traiters were up to horrible,
most people aren’t used to Parceltongue!”
“And keep your shoulders straight!” he called after her.
Potter cast a Notice-Me-Not charm on the alcove while Draco searched his own pockets and came up with a few pieces of string.
“I have…family?”
“My associates are preparing a…distraction. He will not be so powerful when the time comes.”
“Have you done as I asked?”
“How can you even think of
“Slytherin!”
Draco sneered back, mildly offended.
“But…what about the note!”
Potter’s parents were fortunate to be safely dead and, hopefully, no longer sexually attractive to him.
“Shame! Oh, shame! How can friendship be so cruel!? But no, too far.”
.” Draco snapped. “Now
Well. Fenrir really didn’t belong on this mission, the Dark Lord would just have to accept the loss.
“Fine then! Our gallant heroic lads…
“You’re serious, aren’t you. Since when did you go from trying to kill Harry to wanting to marry him? If I’m going to help you, I really need to know what you’re after, Malfoy.”
“They’re used to light explosions of a potion called gasoline inside a very small space, so that the walls of the space are forced to move…and they convert that movement to cause the wheels of an automobile to spin.” Arthur explained excitedly.
“And which efforts would those be?” Blaise asked, his eyes glinting interest.
“A guy?”
“It needs no claiming. What is Malfoy, is Malfoy. If I did not respect your continued use of this place while you have need of it, the grounds would have expelled what they viewed an invader from the premises.”
that is Lord Malfoy, and it is now yours. Tell me young Lord Malfoy, are you here to claim what is yourrss?”
Draco bowed to the Dark Lord, then to Potter.
The Great Hall was disturbingly empty in the middle of the night.
“Do you, Draco Malfoy, swear that you will never reveal what you know of concerning Professor Snape’s activities and allegiances in the war, to his detriment?”
“Better not let Potter hearing you talk about Amortentia. He’s had his own share of close calls with that particular brew.” Draco warned his father.
Tom looked at the old man sadly.
“Good. Let’s join tea then. Aunt Bellatrix has something I have need of.”
Draco sighed, feeling inexplicably guilty for taking advantage of Potter’s state to finish the spell…perhaps it would have been more sporting to do it from behind when Potter was in his right mind. Oh well. Time to set Potter to rights before those innocent eyes accused him any more.
proposals.”
Blood. Breath. Tears. Flesh. Bile.
“I’m trying to forget.”
“Come now, Granger, this is a boarding school.” Draco said reasonably. “Adolescents live here, grow up here together, away from their parents. Of course a good deal of experimentation will be going on. Best we control the location and make sure certain the children don’t accidentally give away something they don’t hold title to.”
“Ah.” Draco said mysteriously, casting a quick tempus. “Right on time.”
“Are you okay?”
“But, what if there’s something to that? Voldemort was really vulnerable to that because of the unicorn blood.” Harry suggested, “Maybe the power of love is simplifying things, but what if the Marks are reacting because they’re being unraveled somehow? Is that possible?”
that always seem to see things as you want them to.”
“How?”
“Malfoys do
“And finally on the agenda today, Proposition four-hundred-twenty-seven…introduced by Prefect Finch-Fletchley…suggesting that Prefects be allowed to bring up to two guests at any one time with them into the prefects bath.”
“Three drops of veritaserum diluted into water, and a Rules potion.”
Draco looked into Potter’s pretty green eyes, allowing some emotion to show in his own eyes as he gazed into his fiance’s face.
“Well.
“Oh. It’s…always been the only real home I ever knew.”
“I…I’d like that, thank you.”
“Do you mind if I look at the memory?”
“He’s afraid you will become a target.” She nodded. “The sentiment is admirable, if misguided.”
, Potter.”
Dumbledore recoiled backwards, his chair rocking with the impact. Draco noted his eyes were suddenly bloodshot.
Draco made a note to brew Polyjuice himself, as soon as possible.
“Some boys came but they were loud and scary,” Jamie told him.
“Well, I doubt he’ll put this in
irresponsible. Just tasteless.” Blaise corrected.
“Fine. Yes. But if he’s making friends with a Muggle then, he’s found a way to change how he thinks. I just want him to learn how to live in the world again and be a part of it.”
“Going to break my nose, Malfoy?” Potter taunted, clearly furious at the manhandling.
The few Light Malfoys had always hidden the Sceptre during their lives, ashamed of its connotations. But the more numerous Dark wizards and witches, and even one Dark Lord, had always retrieved it. Flaunted it, corrupting its use to more and more heinous acts.
Draco shifted uneasily, then sat down carefully.
“Where in Egypt?”
side, they are grossly out of line. If you feel the need to speak with someone about it, ask one of your Prefects to arrange for you to meet with you. My father was the Dark Lord’s chief lieutenant. I know what pressure is.”
Ah. Two weeks and Harry was still poring through his proposal contract. No doubt, Granger was invaluable to him there, Draco thought enviously. If only Pansy or Blaise had her organizational skills. He wondered idly what Granger would make of the anti-incest clauses in the agreement. He hoped the vague boilerplate language his barristers had constructed would be sufficiently discreet to avoid embarrassing Harry.
Draco kept his wand pointed at the water, his magical energy feeding the localized maelstrom that was forming around Potter’s straining member, leaving barely a ripple on the surface of the water.
Lucius smiled, putting his wand back into his cane.
“Well, we
“No! Not them, please not them. Draco? Why are you doing this? We were going to be married! I thought you wanted to be together!” Potter pleaded, eyes desperate.
Harry handed his wand to Tom and accepted Voldemort’s wand from Ollivander.
Draco winked at the man. Using Potter’s feelings towards him to manipulate him into accepting a truce, enabling the Malfoys to survive a generation dominated by an immensely powerful Light wizard…that would be the strategy Snape would have used. The one he was subtly pushing Draco towards.
The Burrow was not, as Draco had been led to believe, a fetid dump packed beyond capacity with hand-me-down clothes, heirlooms of dubious magical or monetary value, and an unending supply of little red-headed people packed in like little rodents everywhere.
“I never said I was nice. Only powerful. Which means you should most certainly do as I say. Now, how has young Lord Malfoy been educating you on the Noble Struggle?”
“But one of thessse headsssss wassss shared by the father called Harry.” The Critic said.
Granger squeaked, her mouth opening and closing. Draco just smirked and continued.
Draco followed the man outside, then into a medium-sized shed. Inside was what appeared to be the elder Weasley’s workshop. Odd artifacts littered the area, some of them clearly Muggle in origin and others were just…
“And if there are unexpected variables?”
Narcissa just smiled a very glittery Black smile at him, her eyes almost malicious with glee.
Tom considered it. Rather a clever custom, he thought. Repetition on a daily basis, from a young age, would make young heirs quite malleable to their parents’ will by the time they reached adolescence. Draco had explained to him that a great amount of family ritual magic was designed to prepare for and counter the wildness that stage of life brought with it.
one. But I still think you’re pulling something, Malfoy. I’ll be watching you!” he threatened, eye spinning crazily.
“Expecting someone?”
“But it’s not a surprise if I promised it, is it!” Draco said logically.
“You know I will.”
“Inspiring a Romantic Revival”…might be useful after the 100-year-honeymoon charm had worn off, but not terribly helpful at this point
“He will. You gave him that push, but he’s doing that. Now is the world ready for Lucius Malfoy in his pro-Muggle phase?” he teased.
“So let’s move on to you, then.” Tonks pointed at the boy who’d been questioning James.
?” he stammered.
“I’ll ignore the situation for now. Tell me about the last bolthole.”
“I do not intend to cross wands with the Dark Lord. I am a Malfoy. We deal in other men’s deepest secrets. Even the Dark Lord has his weaknesses.”
He noiselessly slipped through the door, shutting it silently behind him. A locking spell for good measure.
His body was wracked with pain as he coughed convulsively, spitting up dark blood into the grass.
“I play no games but those I am certain to win, Lord Voldemort.”
“We found him years ago. Undoing the curse he was trapped under required bonding him to a new magical soul and allowing them to enter the physical world together.”
Draco’s lips quirked at the mention of his name.
Blaise looked at her uncertainly.
“What did you get me Harry?”
“Severus, my boy, I hope you will not repeat my mistakes.” Dumbledore chastised gently. “You of all people understand how such low expectations can back one into a corner.”
“Wait a minute.” Granger interrupted. “Just because your father went to prison he has to…
Warm steam billowed out into his face, and Draco cast a quick charm to prevent the cold air outside the room from streaming in and giving him away.
a Prefect, Potter. Unlike yourself, I might add.”
His father started to sneer, then just stared at him, his face white.
A bark of greeting signaled his presence, and green eyes lit up as they found him.
Draco let out a breath.
“Very well. I will leave it to your Prefects to show you to your sleeping arrangements. Good evening.”
after a Quidditch game!”
“No, you’re not.” Harry said firmly.
“Besides having different effects, Reducto is a straight-line targeting spell, while Muffliato is a general-effect spell, yes. Though of course the latter isn’t wise if you’ve allies in the vicinity.”
“Boys. Come to meet your new brother?” he said, his voice warm despite his clear exhaustion.
me to make him my best friend.” Draco objected.
“Okay. There are two items I need you to recover, in two locations. I think you’ll know what I want them for when you analyze them. Suffice to say that I know what use they’ve been put to and I don’t approve in the least.” Draco said.
Harry shuddered, and Draco hesitantly put a hand on the small of his back. Harry didn’t pull away, at least.
“Granger, if you’d thought before you’d spoken, you’d notice that Harry and myself were both
“I think we can agree to keep the questions general enough to avoid prying into your family’s private business affairs, wouldn’t you say so Kingsley?”
Jamie looked shocked.
Draco pulled back, both for his own self-preservation and to clarify.
The Critic sniffed with disdain.
“Not precisely. I know she is attempting to sabotage my figure, however.” Draco said gravely.
“Mrs. Weasley. This is…this should be an heirloom for your family, I couldn’t possibly take something like this from you. Please, give it to one of your sons!”
Draco noticed that Dumbledore hadn’t protested this line of questioning. Clearly he wanted surety of Draco’s sincerety as much as the others did. Well, now you know what I’m after, you nosy old man, get me out of this!
“A…a pensieve? Transfer spells? What are you talking about?”
Draco just nodded.
“You knew him?” she asked, her voice sounding awed.
“Very good. Now leave the plate. I need Molly to believe I’ve eaten it all.”
he had any preparation for. His knuckles bled, a sharp burning
Harry had sidled up to him as soon as he saw what was in the box, and therefore hadn’t seen his face. He was suddenly whispering urgently in his ear.
“It’s what all the secrecy was about. In fact, it’s been illegal to disclose to someone like you for centuries, I have no idea how Granger got authorization for this program, actually. It’s possibly the only universally enforced law in my world.” Lucius told him, holding the wand out for inspection.
Draco leaned back.
The magic swirled around the room, sealing it. They would not be able leave until they had finished what they started.
“Good.”
energy that made Draco’s manhood stand rigidly at attention inside his robes.
James squirmed under his father’s gaze, but nodded.
an insult! It’s…it’s almost like declaring blood feud!” Granger scolded him.
“Bloody soul link.” Draco growled under his breath, annoyed.
“Jamie. The Magic gift is given by someone personally known to both the suitor and the one being courted. The last gift is given personally…at the end.”
He turned his attention back to Nott, who had been watching the exchange without comment.
That done, Scrimgeour discreetly exited the office, along with most of the Aurors, and Moody shuffled forward to carefully place three drops of Veritaserum on Draco’s tongue and watch him swallow it.
Dumbledore’s head shot up again, his eyes horrified.
“Dum Dubello Voldemort”
“I really think we should be getting back to our dorms. Potions first thing tomorrow.”
His voice was on edge, his entire body tensed and straining in anticipation of where Draco’s lips would touch next.
Draco knew exactly what he wanted.
Granger looked suspicious now.
“Show me.” Draco ordered. The far wall disappeared, revealing a staircase.
“Pretty well, I’d say. After he gave me the note for you, he had a muggle friend already waiting on him, a promising physicist out of MIT, and they seemed as thick as thieves. I think he was genuinely enjoying his company!”
Tom nodded.
Draco forced himself to meet the powerful green eyes.
had better
question, actually. Is Harry inside?”
Harry gasped at the sight laid out before him.
“Flying broomsticks?” Jonas looked like he was barely holding back a giggle “That was one I thought must surely be a myth!”
Draco stared at him.
“Of course, Professor.”
“Yes, Harry Potter. I’ve heard a lot about you from mother. The Wrackspurts tried to get Regulus too, but I chased them away.”
“Can we see inside too?” James begged, quickly joined by his brother.
Blood. Breath. Tears. Flesh.
daughter, who would be getting to know her father now if he hadn’t lost his life on one of your little missions, Potter? You know, I suspect if Sirius hadn’t been so distracted with his best friend’s son, he might have spent that time looking into Ministry records of his case and found his daughter. You owe this to her, Potter.” Draco argued forcefully.
The boy smiled, the gentle expression crossing his hunted features with difficulty.
“Well-played, Malfoy.”
Draco slid his hand down the Gryffindor’s arm and clasped his hand, interlacing their fingers. Since Harry was momentarily struck dumb, Draco would get to ask the first question. Ah, how he loved being a Slytherin.
“DRACO!” Blaise shouted, right next to his ear.
James caught on immediately, and nodded gravely in agreement.
here together!” a more worldly fifth-year added, to blushes all around.
And Harry was suddenly sobbing, and Draco was holding him in his arms, soothing his tears with a frantic tenderness that escalated with the painful sight of every salty little drop.
“Jamina, what a pleasant surprise!” he said evenly, rage boiling in his eyes “How did you find New York?”
should not actually
Tom returned the bow.
“Dedico meus vires toto, nisi mis mortis, munimentum meus vir.”
No scar. Interesting.
“Ronald.
“And that’s exactly why we can’t trust him! Anyways,
And the greatest fear…well…the etching on the pitiful grave marker was barely legible, but Draco was fairly certain it bore the Dark Lord’s name. The Dark Lord feared death. Which would have to be true, considering the ludicruous number of Horcruxes he’d created.
“I think what Harry’s trying to say is, he never knew Sirius had a daughter, and now that he does he’d like to get to know her. Isn’t that right Harry?” Granger put in helpfully.
Regulus shrugged.
“Sweet. ~~You up for some mischief and mayhem, Hissyfit?~~”
“When the time comes.”
“He’s blood.”
Potter spit in his face.
“No…he was just some boy, he said Scorp chose him to take care of him so he was his adopted brother. He got really mad when we woke him up arguing.”
“No. But I think when you consider the wording of my Oath, and the nature of the items, you’ll understand how important this task is. What I will tell you is a list of the known wards and protections around each item.”
“Well, Orpheus, when Draco defeated Voldemort, he disrupted some of the pieces of magic that he had created. And one of those was imprisoning me. And because Draco and Harry were going all over Britain hunting down Voldemort’s pieces of magic, they found where I was, and did a ritual to get me out. Only, Harry was pregnant with Scorpius and they didn’t know I was in there, so I got soul bonded to Scion Scorpius Malfoy. So since my mother died and Voldemort killed my father, they adopted me into the family.”
“And that’s when the dog turned into Sirius!” Potter related excitedly.
, Master Draco!”
“He didn’t use a spell, he just sort of pushed us around with magic, without saying anything.”
“You know something I don’t know?”
“Due to Horcruxes, not his own inherent magic. He is strong, but not the only power in the world.”
It didn’t take long.
Hermione looked down at the baby. Sure enough, the tiny face scrunched in a yawn, and then the eyes opened slowly to view the world.
The putrid unwashed smell rose up like a wave. Draco paused, suppressing a gagging reflex.
One sleeve was slightly shorter than the other. An odd design, perhaps intended to enable easy access to a wand in a wrist sheath? But no, the shorter sleeve had not been widened at the end to accommodate such a device.
romantic, in a way.” He seemed to be looking at Draco’s throat suddenly, and his face colored and his eyes went a bit glassy. “Though…it will be hard.” The blush deepened. “Um, I mean, difficult. Not to…do….”
“I’ve been calling you by your first name nearly this entire year, surely you could do me the same courtesy by now?” he said calmly.
That was
“I hope the twins aren’t getting in trouble…” Draco teased.
Regulus clutched at his stomach as a knot of loss almost made him double over, his vision swimming with tears until all he could make out was a pair of muggle shoes – Nike sneakers – standing patiently in front of him.
!” he swore fiercely.
Next to the one with long, slightly curly blond hair stood a tall, regal-looking mand with long blond hair tied back in a loose tail, arm around an elegantly beautiful blond woman. Beside them, a dark-haired teenaged girl and a tall black teenaged boy.
“Not here.”
That did it. Ron broke from Granger’s warning grasp and drew his wand in a fury.
He guided him carefully up the winding brick path, then stood behind his husband, placing his hands over his eyes.
The twins faltered a moment.
“You…are sending me away?”
There it was, the girl’s face betrayed just the slightest flicker of annoyance. Clearly he’d tangled her nets with his interference. Slytherin after all.
“Malfoy.” Draco said.
“Yes. Quite.” Draco took the brief pause to cut off her torrent of speech. Even if she was quite right. “Well, after looking through this book, which I understand is just barely an introduction to the subject for someone with no knowledge whatsoever, I’ve come to a decision. I think these muggle theories should be developed in a magical context. There should be a Magical Periodic Table, to start with, and a deeper analysis of the properties within each magical ingredient and how they interact.”
“Malfoy.” Potter spat hatefully, a spark of something finally coming into those lifeless eyes. “What do you want?” The boy’s fists clenched, looking at Draco’s pointed wand then pointedly ignoring it, raising his chin defiantly. Beaten but not quite broken, clearly.
“It is exceedingly rare. A child can perform it accidentally, as random discharges. After gaining a wand, however…the energy is channeled through the core and such random discharges only occur when an especially powerful wizard loses control of his magic. Very dangerous.” Severus told him carefully.
“Oh.” Potter said.
Draco wondered if the relationship through Jaimie could have affected Potter’s familial loyalty to Draco without Potter being aware of that relationship? This was the only rational explanation Draco could think of. It certainly was something that deserved close consideration – familial loyalty and it’s interactions with magic were the very bedrock of pureblood politics, and if they could operate outside of
Then Draco’s vision was dimming as he slumped to his knees, registering that Harry’s face was so close and sweet up close as he was grasped by the shoulders, panicked voices raised as he slipped into unconsciousness.
“No! They can’t!”
Regulus looked like he was on the verge of tears.
“We have to do something!” Frankie begged.
Draco smiled tightly at her.
“Is it?” Harry said, sounding very interested.
“Yessss, we have dissscovered the ssssecret wordssss of the fathersss already.” The Dreamer said.
Draco woke up the next morning with a groan.
"And as for if the effects had mixed, can you think of any kind of mix that would be useful to them?"
Draco stared at him for a moment and then sighed, "Fine, I'll come. But if I don't like it, I'm never going again."
"What are you acting all smug about," Blaise said, elbowing her in the ribs, "you've never even dated someone."
"Well I have homework that I have to finish so we'll do that." Harry didn't seem very pleased to find out that he was going to be spending an hour doing homework with Malfoy, but agreed anyway, resigned to his fate.
"Maybe I should go drink some of that potion so I can let you know. I'm interested to see what everyone looks like too."
"You got more alcohol?" Luna said as they worked their way down the hall.
Harry paused for a second, then, "I have no idea who might have done it, and no idea what the effects are. I have noticed people glowing different colors though, and sometimes people glow brighter than others."
Hagrid looked over at him, suddenly surprised, "What d'ya mean?"
"Same here, I was just as shocked as you."
"I say we prank Filch."
"You do. You're hopeless."
“You didn’t hear?” Hemione asked and when she got blank stares in response she continued, “Harry and Malfoy went on a date to Hogwarts today-”
And then it all came flooding back to him. Pansy was the one who had messed with the potion, but she'd also only done it because she thought it would make them admit their feelings to each other. His head was hurting too bad to think about this too deeply and he flopped back onto his bed.
"I was thinking we could go to the Slytherin tryouts for our punishment."
"I bet he got off scot free, too," Pansy growled, anger obvious in her face and voice.
"Ron," Lavender said without a moment of hesitation and winked at Ron who looked like he wanted to be sick. Hermione scooted closer to Ron. Draco picked up the coin and flipped it, the group watched as Draco caught it from midair and flipped it on his arm, "tails," he announced, passing it to Lavender.
"Sure!"
Draco snuck out of the dorm less than an hour later when Harry never returned. He was wandering down the hall when he slammed into what seemed like empty air.
"Oh har har."
"You just gotta give it more time. There's no way he doesn't like you," Blaise said.
"Ron, let him talk.'
"No, I can do it," Draco said, face hardening with resolve and Harry smiled a bit.
"I'm sweaty and gross," Harry mumbled, "I should probably shower and then we can get back to setting up the fort."
------------------------
They ran until Harry grabbed Draco, pulling him behind a tapestry. Not even a few seconds later they heard Filch's footsteps hurry past their hiding spot. "I'll find you, and you'll be expelled!" he shouted as he rushed past.
"I wonder how the dormitories are going to work this year as there aren't many of us coming back and the dormitories aren't made for eighth years too," Hermione said, coming to his rescue.
Harry was just reaching down to unbutton Draco's pants when Draco reached up to stop him. "Not yet," he breathed, "Sorry..." Draco turned his head to avoid Harry's eyes.
Hermione and Ron looked at each other before heading after him. They both knew Harry wasn't telling them everything, but they didn't know exactly what it was he wasn't telling them.
"Nah, I was trying to be healthy. Though I suppose I should've," Draco mused, opening up the packaging and grabbing the frog before it could escape.
"So if you add that, it will increase its potency," Draco looked up to find Harry staring dumbly at him, "were you even listening?"
Sure, it wasn't horrible, he had to admit Draco didn't smell bad. That wasn't the issue though; some idiot thought it would be a fun idea to douse the entire room in Amortentia. Their idea was that everyone could try and find the one the room smelled like. It'd be fun, according to the people who set up the party, because everyone would be wearing masks and costumes. Harry hadn't found the amusement in it. With the war recently over and everything, though, Harry decided it would be mean to say no to an idea that everyone had seemed so excited about.
"You ready?" Draco said and a very small shy smile spread across his features and Harry had to remember how to breathe.
-------------------------------
Goosebumps formed on the back of Harry's neck from the cold air. He was seated between Ron and Draco high up in the stands and the cold air set his teeth chattering. Harry tightened his scarf around himself to try and combat the cold air, but it didn't help much.
The game carried on for a bit, everyone drinking a bit and starting to get a little tipsy. Even Hermione gave in and was sharing a bottle of firewhiskey between her and Ron. It was Pansy's turn and the bottle rolled to a stop in front of Harry, who was feeling a bit more than tipsy.
"I should probably let your mother know I'm fine," Harry said, hurrying towards the house.
“You said sorry in your letter,” Draco pointed out, and Harry couldn’t help but notice the anger in his voice.
"So?"
The gentleness with which Draco spoke, took Harry by surprise. How am I ever supposed to get over him if he keeps doing things like this, Harry thought. Harry sucked in a shuddering breath, "I don't always remember them. They're often jumbled up and make little sense." Harry sighed and looked down at Draco who was still leaning on his shoulder. Draco didn't say anything, simply letting Harry speak. "Tonight though, I know it was about my aunt and uncle. They're who I used to live with after my parents... you know." Harry stopped then and Draco realized he didn't know how to continue.
"I'm really glad I invited you too," Blaise let out a nervous, breathy, laugh, "and I've also had a really good time. I'd love to do something with you again some time."
Harry pulled away after a moment and Draco opened his eyes, not remembering closing them in the first place. Draco watched as Harry grabbed his shampoo and poured some onto Draco's head.
A small smile spread across Draco's face and Harry grinned. "I'll take that as a yes."
"Yeah, I visited Draco," Harry whispered back, "His parents know about us now." Ginny shot him a look that was equal parts shocked and interested. "I'll tell you about it later."
"I was here earlier, but you weren't waking and Pomfrey forced me to go to class," Draco said all in a hurry and his words seemed to blur together a bit and it wasn't helping Harry's head that Draco seemed to be glowing red. "I was so worried."
“I should’ve known,” Draco laughed.
"What have I been excited for?" Dean said, coming out of the group of people too and snaking his arm around Seamus' shoulders.
"Honey, it was obvious."
His eyes made their way past Ron and Hermione to where Draco was sitting at his table across the hall, both face and red haze glowing brightly.
"You look nice," Blaise said with a smirk as Draco emerged from their shared bathroom, "did you finally land a date?"
"They were kissing when I came in," Ron hissed to Hermione when he got back and Hermione's head jerked to look at him.
Harry looked away before Draco could notice him staring.
"Okay I have another game idea since it's not midnight yet," Pansy said and an evil smile crossed her lips.
Romilda Vane — seeker
Draco could feel eyes on the back of his head the entire lesson, but was refusing to turn around. After the embarrassing experience of waking up next to Potter, of all people, and no less wake up cuddling him, he didn't want to go near him. If Pansy found out he'd never hear the end of it.
Harry tried his best to walk normally into the Great Hall for breakfast, he really did, but he couldn't help it. Hermione noticed something was up almost immediately, especially when he tried to sit down and his face scrunched up in pain. He managed to fend off her questions by telling her he'd just practiced extra hard last night for Quidditch and was just sore, but Seamus and Dean were sending him knowing looks all through breakfast.
Harry,
"Stop. Both of you," Hermione said, putting up a hand to stop Harry who was starting to mimic Draco, "The whole purpose of you two hanging out is for you two to stop fighting."
Love,
"Oh sorry," Hermione said when they bumped into each other. "Oh, sorry Malfoy," she said when she realized who it was, "I'll just uh-" she made to move around him when he stopped her.
"Malfoy," he snarled, turning around to glare at Draco through his mask.
"I didn't-" Draco started to say but the kid cut him off with a new string of insults.
She found her walking down the hall almost immediately and quickly told her what was going on and in seconds they were up in Draco and Harry's dorm room.
"Since when?" Ron said with a tone of contempt, he knew that Harry and Draco had seemed to be getting along better but Harry had reassured him that they weren't anything more and he felt angry that Harry would befriend someone like Draco. Hermione, on the other hand, felt angry at Ron's complete obliviousness and the tone he used, especially when Harry was so obviously feeling pretty happy about it.
"Go away Malfoy," Ron said, sending Malfoy a glare as he started to laugh and walk off, Goyle, Pansy, and Blaise following behind.
"Okay, last question," Hermione said, picking up the last piece of paper. "Never have I ever liked someone in the circle." Everyone took a shot except Goyle who blushed from the embarrassment.
"Ah, Mr. Longbottom," McGonagall said as she looked up from her papers, "and Mr. Zabini, what do I owe the pleasure?"
"Ugh, this is the worst," Ron groaned as they entered his room, but his opinion quickly changed as Hermione pulled her shirt off and handed it over to him. Ron stared for a moment sputtering.
"It was just punishment Pansy, we sat and did homework. What were you expecting?"
I've made it to Hogwarts alright and the feast was fine. The eighth years have our own dormitories this year but I'm stuck with Potter of all people. We were supposed to be able to choose our rooms but instead stupid Potter slammed into me in the hall. As I'm sure you're already aware, the new headmaster is McGonagall and she stopped us in the hall and not only made us late to pick our roommate but also has required us to spend at least an hour a day together. She won't let us refuse either and now I'm stuck hanging out with him until the end of the school year! It's preposterous, what are we even supposed to do?!
Harry chuckled to himself as he watched them bicker and was slightly startled by a small cough from a Ravenclaw girl who had walked up in front of Harry without him realizing. The girl didn't seem to be much younger than Harry but judging by the fact he had no clue who she was he guessed she was a sixth or seventh year.
"Ugh," Harry groaned softly and dropped his head into his arms. Hermione gave him a curious glance but continued to take notes, Ron however was grateful for the distraction.
"Well, that's pretty much all I talked to, I'm sure there are more. Goyle played as a beater last year remember? So I'd imagine he might still be interested."
Harry thankfully took it, "Terrible," he groaned, "I would fail that class without you."
One thing that made dating Draco great was that he got to kiss him. Harry was quickly becoming addicted to Draco's lips.
"Mmm," Draco mumbled, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes as Harry continued to cuddle up to his back, "mornin'"
"I know, I love you too," Harry said and pulled Draco back down for another light kiss. He really loved when Draco showed his soft side as he was doing now. He'd rarely seen it before this year and he knew that Draco didn't show it to just anyone, the thought sent butterflies to his stomach.
Blaise and Neville had planned to meet on Sunday to work on the herbology project Neville was doing, but it was awkward to say the least.
"How has that been by the way?"
They made it up the pathway to the front of the house, Draco reached out pushing the grand doors open to admit them. Harry was immediately taken back to the time he, Ron and Hermione had been taken by death eaters.
"Sure, but shouldn't you be working to find who the room smells of - instead of messing around with me?" Harry said, putting a hand up to Draco's chest to push him away, but he just grabbed that hand as well and intertwined their fingers.
"Yes, I think that would be a great idea, as I much prefer the silence," Draco shot a glare at Harry, and moved to go around him but Harry reached out and grabbed his arm.
"You're perfectly regular."
"We can't just let him continue to walk around and do and say whatever he wants with no consideration for anyone!" Ron shot back.
"I uh- how did you know? That you liked guys, I mean."
"No, not at all. Those two at that table over there are glowing a pretty bright red though," Harry said, pointing to what seemed to be a young couple. From the looks of it they seemed to be Hogwarts students.
"Sorry... if I woke you..." Harry murmured, already starting to drift back to sleep now that Draco was there. The dream had been about Draco, afterall. Harry had dreamed that Draco had fallen into the flames in the Room of Requirement and had been in the middle of a fit of panic when Draco woke him.
"Angry? Nah, a little jealous, sure, but not angry," Ron laughed.
When Pansy made it back to the circle without falling, the game resumed and in a couple rounds Luna was getting up to press a light kiss to Pansy's lips. Blaise hoped that'd make her happy, but instead it seemed to do the opposite as she flopped down on her back and complained about how badly she wanted a girlfriend.  (Me too Pansy)
"So are you going to get in this time by yourself or will I have to shove you in again?" Harry asked when he had toed off his shoes and looked back to see Draco hadn't moved.
"Hey! It's not that bad," Harry laughed as Draco tossed the comb down on the bed.
"His friends are going on a date and he didn't want to bother them," Draco said, running his hands through his hair.
"It's too cold for it only being October," Draco grumbled, taking off his cloak, setting it down on the seat next to himself. They'd selected a booth at the back in a semi-private area. It suited them both as neither of them liked the attention being in public brought.
The inside of the greenhouse was warm and everywhere he looked it was covered in greenery.
"Because you wouldn't want this when you're awake," saying it stung and he almost just wanted to throw caution to the wind and continue, but this was Draco and he didn't want to do anything he didn't want. "You're drunk, we both are. We should just sleep."
"Come on, I know a hall that not many people walk though," Ginny said and started to lead him through the crowd and to an adjacent hall that was empty. "So what did you need to talk about?" Ginny asked when they came to a stop.
"Mmhmm," Hermione said.
"Yeah, I mean, you'd probably get to change in the same locker rooms as Potter."
“I was bored,” Pansy said with a shrug as she helped herself to a leftover pancake. “This looks like a fancy breakfast. Special occasion?” Pansy said with a wink at Harry.
"I think so?" Harry said, eyes finding their way to Draco across the room again, "I was going to ask if he wanted to sit with us actually if that's okay?"
Thank you all so much, again, and have a wonderful day!
"I hate sharing a room with him! He's the most annoying roommate I've ever had!" Ron groaned  at the table at breakfast the next morning. Hermione was seated next to him and Neville and Harry were seated in front of him.
"Pansy," Hermione replied confidently. Pansy was a great roommate, Hermione thought and was glad she had roomed with her. She wouldn't change her roommate if she could. Lavender flipped the coin and it landed on heads.
"Lunch is ready!" Molly called from the kitchen then and they made their way down the stairs.
“And you didn’t tell us?!” Hermione said.
By the time Draco got out of the shower, Harry was on his last sentence of the essay and felt quite proud of himself.
Draco paused for a second as for a moment two different interpretations of that went through his head: Harry was worried for him or Harry was worried he was going to do something evil again. He chose to interpret it as the latter as it gave him a reason to argue; they had been too friendly lately and he needed to return it to normal.
"Oh yeah! Have you guys got it set yet?"
"Just because he hasn't tried to let any Dark Lords into the castle this semester, doesn't make him any less of a git," Ron mumbled and picked up his pace to go into Honey dukes.
Draco took a shot.
Okay but like I really like this chapter, but it was also so hard to write as I'm not great at writing dialogue. But here it is, the longest chapter yet!
“We didn’t get in a fight-” Harry started.
"Fair-" Blaise started but was interrupted by the door slamming open, displaying Pansy in the doorway, dressed in a solid black dress that bunched around her knees.
"So, what are we going to do tonight?" Harry questioned, noticing Draco looking at him.
----------------------------------------
"I wish you wouldn't call me that," Harry grumbled but Draco ignored him.
His head seemed to stop spinning after gulping down the disgusting liquid, but the haze remained, "What happened?"
"Sure, no problem."
"I'm sure they won't care as long as you're happy," Hermione said with a comforting smile as she reached across to give Ginny's hands a small squeeze.
"Well, if the colors have to do with liking someone, what about those who don't like people, ever? Like aromantic people," Hermione said, nodding as Harry seemed to be piecing it together.
"So your dad gave it to you. I feel bad for your kids, they're going to be cursed with this mop."
"That's just the thing!" Draco cut her off, "You didn't think. You're not a master at potions, you had no way to know for sure how the potion would affect us, and you were willing to let us drink it!" Pansy's eyes grew a bit teary as Draco fumed at her, "You never think about these things. You just rush blindly in! Forget the fact that it didn't work like you expected for a moment, what was your plan if McGonagall found out. We're all on a very tight leash here after our involvement in the war and you were ready to throw everything away for what?! For him to confess feelings for me that are more than likely aren't even there?!"
"I'm sorry," Harry murmured, watching as Draco's fingernails ran across the edge of the table.
Let me know.
"Potter only invited him to hangout," Blaise informed.
"Yeah, I know you do, I do too," Blaise said, leaning his head against Pansy's shoulder as they sat in front of the fire.
"Oh, um- yeah, he can still be a git- ow!" Hermione elbowed him again, "but he's been pretty nice to us this year. I think he regrets how he acted in the past. He and Harry are roommates too, and they've gotten along pretty well."
"So, are you going to take any girls to Hogsmeade this weekend?" Ron tried to ask casually. Hermione shot him a glare over the top of her book that he tried to ignore. He didn't want to straight-up ask Harry if he liked Draco, he didn't want to make him feel uncomfortable, but he also wanted to help him if he could. "You've had a lot of girls ask you out lately."
"Well maybe I've just realized that I needed to grow up. There's a lot more important things than blood status," a murmur went around the room but Draco didn't feel an ounce of regret, "Maybe you should try it." With that he turned back around to head to his room, leaving the shocked Slytherin's on the steps.
"You wouldn't have said that last year," Draco mumbled, dropping Harry's gaze and looking down at his hands.
Draco's heart rate picked up as Blaise turned to ask Pansy the next question and Draco realized he'd be next.
Harry groaned as he leaned into Draco, placing his hands on Draco's chest again. Draco pushed him back to the wall, their chests pressed against each other, their tongues moving together, fighting for dominance. Draco ran his hands back down his chest again, brushing his nipples, and Draco felt him moan, arching up into him and he got an idea.
Harry gulped as Draco leaned forward.
"Like I look neon or something?" Ron asked and Harry turned to look at him, taking in the red haze around his friend.
On another note, I got you a Christmas gift that I was hoping to give you when we got back to school. Or we could possibly meet in Diagon Alley before we go back and I could give it to you then?
Ron noticed the new hair color first and tugged on Harry's sleeve to get him to look, "Trying something new are we Malfoy?" Ron laughed.
"What brought this on?" Draco felt slightly intrigued and slightly worried all at once.
Draco sighed, leaning back against the bathroom sink. "He asked me out."
"Well how was I supposed to know!"
"Where on earth did you fall asleep at?" Hermione continued, "Neither of us saw you come back last night, and you weren't in bed when we woke up."
“It doesn’t hurt to dress up once in a while though,” Pansy said, “I actually picked you up something to wear too.”
Draco had returned from dinner early to start his homework for the weekend, while Pansy and Blaise stayed in the great hall. He pulled out his potions textbook then, flipping to the chapter he had to read to do the required essay. The fire was burning in the grate and he felt the warmth from it on his legs. A sigh escaped his lips as he shrunk lower into the cushions, grateful for the silence of the common room.
"If you're so bored go talk to Parkinson or Zabini," Harry's voice was slightly muffled by the pillows.
"And I've said it a million time: you're in denial."
"What did you come to talk about?" Harry grumbled, feeling slightly put out after being thoroughly embarrassed.
"Alright, then I'll meet you then."
"Oh! Yes," Pansy said turning back to the notebook and proceeding to narrate, "Step one: compliment him."
Draco looked at him shocked for a moment, there were a million things he was expecting Harry to ask him, but that definitely wasn't one. "Well, not common exactly. Why do you ask?"
"You're so beautiful," Harry whispered. Draco moaned as his hands brushed lower, and Draco reached out, grabbing Harry's wrists.
"I'm bi," Hermione said, staring resolutely at the fire, if Ron was going to react poorly she didn't want to see it.
"Not at all," Ron groaned, "Malfoy was on top of Harry. Please obliviate me."
Draco
Draco let out a sigh, looking down at the mandrakes, "Yeah. Are you really surprised? My father wanted to do anything that would please the Dark Lord and letting him have full reign over the manor was a good way to show loyalty."
"Alright, I'll give you something for it and then you can go if you'd like. I'll have to discuss this with Professor Snape and Headmistress McGonagall and when I have more information I'll come find you, alright?"
“I’m thinking we just do what we want,” Draco replied.
"Thanks guys," Seamus smiled and then noticed Harry sitting quietly and his smile dropped slightly, "You alright Harry? You've been awfully quiet."
--------------------------------
"Shhhh, what if someone overheard you?" Harry said, quickly shushing her.
---------------------------
"Last I checked I wasn't normal."
"Like, is it bad between you and Malfoy? After last night I mean, you remember right? I don't think you were drunk enough at that time to forget." Harry colored as he realized what she was talking about. "I mean, he usually sits on the other side of the table and now he's sitting with his back to you."
Draco let out a shaky breath as Harry ran his lips to the scars that littered his abdomen, his tongue tracing its way down them and to his navel.
"Yeah, we should probably go to bed too," Ron said, standing up and heading towards the stairs, Harry and Hermione following behind.
“Well, if he’s ignoring you, you could write him a letter asking to meet up and saying you’re sorry. I don’t suggest asking him to the Yule Ball through a letter, though, so make sure to just ask him to meet up,” Hermione suggested.
Draco purposely brushed his lips against Harry's neck then and Harry let out a soft gasp. Draco lifted his head then to look at Harry. They gazed at each other a moment and then Draco leaned down, capturing Harry's lips in a soft kiss and that was a bit too brief in Harry's opinion.
He was happy and that was all that mattered.
Harry looked over when he felt something hit his shoulder and saw Draco asleep, leaning against him, his book held in loose fingers resting on his lap. Harry smiled at the sight.
When Seamus made it back to the dorm room door and closed it, they all ran back down the stairs, snickering and tripping the whole way like little children.
I mean, Draco did talk to me about this several weeks ago, Harry thought to himself, wizards don't care about gender. It was still surprising that Hermione didn't care though, as she was muggle. Though, that would be typical of her caring nature, he supposed.
"Here, this door leads outside to the greenhouse," Draco said, pushing open a door that looked exactly the same as every other door if Harry was being honest.
"Uh, it's about something you said earlier..." Harry said, trailing off. Ginny stayed silent though, waiting for him to continue and he eventually did. "You said you were bi, and I was wondering what that meant?"
"Hmmm," Draco feigned thinking about it, even though he'd do just about anything Harry wanted, " I don't know if I want to sit around watching a bunch of Gryffindorks playing Quidditch."
"Potions started ten minutes ago."
Harry let out a sigh and finally looked up to meet her eyes, “No, we didn’t get into a fight... Well not really anyway.” When Ron and Hermione both said nothing, he continued, “You know how Draco glows red…”
"I'll be alright. I'm just sore."
"Who do you think it was then?"
"So what are we working on today?" Blaise said, staring down at his trainers.
"I heard something about a date and came as soon as I heard," Pansy declared, closing the door and making her way to Draco's bed. Promptly making herself at home.
When Harry entered the room, they looked up and quickly turned red as they spotted Harry. Hermione was the first to speak, clearing her throat and trying to pretend Harry didn't just find them tangled up on the couch as they were.
When Draco got into his room it wasn't long after Harry had gone to bed, but Draco could tell he was already asleep by the soft snores he could hear coming from Harry' bed. Draco caught himself smiling and hurried to take a shower.
"You'll see."
Ron seemed to brighten immediately, "Ohh that's smart 'Mione! I didn't even think of that!"
"I don't think he's up to anything!" Harry said, defensive.
“Of course, I learned how for the Yule ball back in fourth year, remember?”
"No way," Draco breathed, reaching out to run his fingertips over their names in the dorm. "Where did you get this?"
“Will it interfere with the magic?”
They chased the bitter-tasting serum with the veritaserum-laced water.
“Yes, you’re right. And I’m quite sure you have some interns in your department who have their connections to that world. There’s that young fellow, with the spiky hair, who’s always bespelling Muggle music onto the queue at the social gatherings.”
“We came to give him Puff!” James announced.
Potter did some kind of impossible mid-loop twist that let him suddenly cut right in front of Draco, the nose of his broom rapping across Draco’s knuckles, his thigh slamming into Draco’s shoulder and sending him careening off to the left.
“Wait a minute. What were you doing in the Prefects Bath?”
“Then…there was another matter. Which is
Harry looked down at him.
“Destroyed.” Draco said firmly. “You won’t remember that those things occurred at all.”
“You were staring at him, just now. You always look at him, you know.” She interrupted.
“My father has seen his grave. Just an ordinary muggle who got caught by a lonely witch’s Amortentia brew.”
“It’s Malfoy!” One of the twins said.
“Has he expressed this directly?”
Draco handed him the scroll and watched him unroll it, reading the incantation inside.
The stands erupted in a deafening roar as Draco shakily pulled himself into a sitting position…just in time to see Potter’s face flushed with victory and hear “…AND HARRY POTTER HAS CAUGHT THS SNITCH! GRYFFINDOR WINS!”
The woman crossed her arms menacingly and glared meaningfully at his bowl.
“Hi. You’re the Potter-Malfoys!”
"I'll be proud to help, my Wizard friend."
before I decide to have you now, anyways.” Draco sneered.
Now he was dogging Draco’s heels relentlessly, and he wasn’t being a gentleman about it anymore.
“And…dragons?”
“Besides the joy of restoring them to their rightful owners?” Draco asked innocently.
“That’s…a very attractive offer, Malfoy.” Granger finally said, looking completely stunned.
with me, Potter.” Draco sneered.
The Gryffindor blushed harder.
“I asked Potter to meet me by Greenhouse Five. You should signal the others to begin the assault in about fifteen minutes.”
VERY WELL, GIVE MY LOVE TO GINNY AND HERMIONE, AND MAKE SURE HARRY IS USING THE PROPER PROTECTIVE SPELLS WHEN HE’S WITH HIS SPECIAL SOMEONE, UNDERSTAND? I’D HATE FOR SOMETHING WONDERFUL TO BE RUINED BY A MOMENT OF YOUTHFUL LUSTS GETTING OUT OF CONTROL! NOW I DON’T KNOW IF HARRY HAS BEEN SEEING A BOY OR A GIRL, BUT THERE’S DANGERS IN BOTH AND SINCE I’VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE YOU THE BIRDS AND BEES TALK BUT NOT HARRY, I’M JUST GOING TO HAVE TO TRUST YOU TO EXPLAIN THINGS TO HIM, SO HE DOESN’T GET A GIRL PREGNANT, OR GET HIMSELF PREGNANT, OR VOID HIS VIRGINITY BY ENGAGING IN PENETRATIVE-
“The thing is, Potter, no matter how you might try to pretend otherwise, you
“Oh…it’s a formula. The first part tells what his first impression was of you. ‘The very pretty boy with big green eyes’…awww.” She teased.
“Of course not.” Draco sneered. “Not by my own hand, at least.”
“Whom he counts among his enemies.” Draco countered.
“Today you will be brewing a potion you learned about last year. The Confusing and Befuddlement Draught. I will be returning your essays on the subject from the last year to you, and they will be your only reference.” Professor Snape said evilly.
“What-, what the hell did you do, Malfoy? What is all this?”
“Oh, that! Well, that was a Horcrux. What’s left in you isn’t a Horcrux, my boy. It’s a purified soul, so its magic is strengthened by Love, of course. And since little Scorpius was conceived in love, and young Tom here latched onto him so he could have someone to love, well, that’s all the magic he really needed to manifest in solid form. Voldemort never did understand the power of Love, but this new Tom Riddle clearly does. With Love comes the power to heal, the power to create life, and sadly the power to hurt us as well. My poor, poor Gellert, how I miss him so…”
“It’s all being payed for out of your honeymoon vaults anyways!”
“Yes, yes, my boy. Let’s get to work, shall we?”
Lupin closed the book he’d been reading and rose gracefully to his feet, crossing one arm across his stomach and propping the other elbow on his fist, his hand coming up to stroke his chin in a thoughtful gesture.
“Hmm. Yes that would fit with the Potter traditions. If I recall James Potter was quite shameless in his pursuit of Lily Evans. It was quite painful to watch, especially since she gave him no encouragement, and in fact could barely stand the sight of him. Still, I suppose it worked in the end. No one was laughing at him during their wedding.”
The Great Hall was in uproar.
“Draco, is there anything else you can tell me?”
“It’s just one day, I’m sure she can’t do too much damage.”
“Not get them--”
The Boy Who Lived looked…awful.
“You will. You
“Right after-”
“What do you want, Malfoy?” Potter asked tiredly.
“So…the actual memories…are they--”
“And?”

He was suddenly enfolded in a four-armed hug between the two men, and Harry nodded as Draco behind him said into his ear,
“Oh right. Draco, I mean.” Bill said awkwardly.

“Draco, I’m a little concerned about his son and Thomas. This little ‘family hobby’ of the Zabini’s is not healthy for those close to them.”
“Master

“Thissss ssssspeaking issssss foolisssshnessss, the other issss an intruder and ssssshould die!” Snapped a third voice.
“Oh, you’ll just have to wait and see, my friend. Just you wait.”
“I suppose we’ll be off to let the two of you enjoy the show…er…enjoy yourselves.” He grunted.
“Regulus, James, I know we told you you’d be getting a new brother.” Draco told them carefully. “Well, it seems your Daddy’s magic had a surprise for us.”
, and never even consult me?” he hissed furiously.
“Well, there is that. I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t do for you then, now would it.”
“Yeah.” Tom said, feeling edgy from the separation even though he could feel warm vibes of contentment from several cars back. He guessed Harry was feeding him. Good. Harry didn’t tend to be as good with schedules as Draco was.
Draco leaned forward, ready to set out the facts simply for his father.

“If there’s a threat? Mate, it’s Voldemort! Of course it’s a threat!”
“But...fine, I suppose if they wait until they are old enough to be trusted with that. So I suppose Jamie wouldn’t want a contract, then. But what about you, Potter. You’re grown. I’m sure you can see this is a wise mixture for your seed. It’s really the only way to honor Sirius, as well. Would you be willing to agree to your side of the contract, and wait until Jamie grows old enough to…eh…
“I don’t care about that. I just want him to wake up.”
Draco glared at the interfering girl.

"We aren't asking. As Minister of Magic, I've issuedan executive order that all necessary steps be taken to investigate the breakout and recover the prisoners, particularly Lucius Malfoy." Scrimgeour said, purposely loud enough for everyone to hear. Obviously he was here to generate headlines.
Harry seemed to take the hint, wrapping his long arms around Draco in a way that made him feel more utterly safe than he’d ever thought possible.
“I guess combinations are the only real way to fight anybody who knows anything.” Harry said slowly.
Draco smirked.
“Lord Weasley. Is there somewhere private we could have a word?”
“I hope so.”
The two walked side-by-side, only inches apart, into the open grounds. A small cadre of DA students had formed a small defensive knot, holding their own effectively against the first probes by the Death Eaters.
There was really only one possible explanation.

Harry looked at him uncomprehendingly, and Draco sighed. He’d known getting into this that some house training would be required.
Cloud seemed to have regained his composure and nodded graciously in dismissal.
Draco nodded. This was unavoidable. Still. The Dark Lord must be misled on one point.
“That was a very dangerous thing to attempt, Mr. Malfoy.”
“He’s got Papa’s hair.” Regulus observed.
“Two thousand eight.” Draco informed him calmly.
Draco just smirked at her.
“Look, this is the way I am and people need to just get over it.”
“Well, you’ve gone to school with me for nearly six years, you should know I’d have a more complex agenda than that.” Draco said, feeling insulted.
“There are plenty of wards to alert us if he needs anything. And the house elves are very capable.” Draco assured him.
“Yes well, if everyone else is a Gryffindor it would, wouldn’t it?”
“Professor Snape, could I see you in your office?” Draco asked politely.
There was only one more element, which he’d need help for after all of this.
“I am certain the creature that controlled those marks is completely destroyed. I do not know exactly what method Voldemort used to key the control of the marks to his own essence. Obviously he retained some connection after losing his original body, and even after creating a new body based on your blood. Clearly it was to his soul, which he stored in the Horcruxes. But…he may have given a broad definition of his soul in order to maximize his ability to assert control in diverse situations. It’s conceivable that this purified fragment inherited the Marks.”
“Yes. But I don’t know the language of Potter’s muggle upbringing.” Draco said.
“But James called you-”
“He bites, too. Probably have Moony for lunch, he’s good and mad.” Harry told them solemnly.

“Family is everything. And he’d be on the losing side of the war.”
“Lucius, surely Harry and Draco told you of their plans to adopt the other Slytherin heir?” Jamie said, with just an ounce of condescension in her voice.
Then another owl flew in, divebombing the Gryffindor table, a bright red envelope clutched in its talon.
“Was he?” Draco asked sharply, pleased. Perhaps the spy was beginning to see reason and would open negotiations.
On the left, Potter’s greatest fear was, surprisingly,
“You wish me to be a spy.”
Which was why this next section of the scroll would be so interesting.
“Ok then! I think we can all be adults about this!” Hermione summarized.
“If tales are true, you were a little snot in first year.” Lupin countered.
“We made,”
He laughed nervously, putting the offending hand behind his back.
“Draco, you shouldn’t be doing any of that-”
“Anything more you can tell us about this person? Did he give his name?”
And then it was his turn.

as his core rebalanced itself, and he could look down to where Potter’s head of sopping-wet hair (still somehow looking like a ludicrous mess) was huddled miserably on his chest, Potter pressing his face desperately into Draco’s stomach as he cried.

magic, they’ve identified, and understand what they’ll do if you put any two of them together.” Potter said.
Harry barely glanced at what he indicated, then did a double-take, his jaw dropping.
“Hey are you alright, man? You kinda rushed off, I thought…oh.”
Ollivander turned to Regulus and James as if nothing out of the ordinary had just happened.
“Remember what I told you about wizards and childbearing?”
that dreaming of torturing someone made me…made me…made me…”
“By all means, Harry,”
That would not do. Fortunately, Draco knew exactly how to set it right. There was really only one currency in Slytherin alliances.
“Family is everything, Harry.”
“When the wands connect, Harry, you need to relax. Tom, there will be a bead of light, you need to concentrate on pushing that bead with your magic until it hits your wand in Harry’s hand. Understood?”
“Something else to ask me, Nott?”
Draco nodded slowly.
Draco grabbed the boys wrist.
“But-”

“I have reason to believe he would not be adverse to the idea. But…I also know he was raised by Muggles and…expects things to be handled very differently than what I am accustomed to. The courtship rituals…I’ve tried researching in Muggle literature, but haven’t found much of use on that front. As a personal confidant of Potter’s…you would know the rituals specific to his family and background, correct?”
“Oh, Wrackspurts are these nasty little fairy creatures, mostly invisible of course, that mess with your head and make you feel all kinds of wacked out like you’re on some kind of-”
“Muggle chocolate, you mean. And yes. Here, I’ll show you.” Draco drew out the small box and handed it to her, watching as she opened it and gasped as the chocolate frog tried to escape.
“Do your worsssst, one-head.” The Critic spat.
“I wanted Slytherin,” the girl said. “And I’m too quiet to be a Puffball. And I don’t like to study.”
“Hopefully.” Draco said smugly. “You can go ahead with the diagnostic Madame Pomfrey.”
at such a level…such exclusive knowledge could be highly useful in the future.
No, Lucius Malfoy felt out of place because he was old. His magical heritage smoothed away some of his fifty-odd years from his face, but despite the breeding and manners of his fellows he knew his mannerisms were dated. Probably more so due to his own upbringing in the Wizarding World. The young people around him glowed with vigor and excitement and it all made Lucius feel very tired.
“Mr. Ollivander, I’m so sorry to trouble you with this. There was…a complication with the ritual that banished Voldemort. Only the evil part of him is gone and Tom is…well…what’s left.” He told him in a low voice.
“Passable.” He agreed mildly.
Draco pulled Potter into a kiss, feeling that raw magic burning against him once again…strange that he’d been craving the uncomfortable sensation…as Potter’s tongue dueled with his.
“Very. She was the one who reminded me of…um…how much I liked you when we met in Madame Malkins, you know.” Draco said.
“I do have one other matter that I could use your considerable contacts on, however.” Draco said carefully. “Which is somewhat outside your role as barristers. I would prefer this be done by those who are bound to me. It would enable you to consider a shadow of this development outside your duties here.”

“Ah ha!” Harry called out from the doorway. Draco turned to look and felt something warm stirring between his legs as he took in Harry’s naked torso stretching up out of the narrow waist of his pajama pants.

“Malfoy?”
Draco decided to take another tack.
Draco, recovering quickly from the pure horror of Molly Weasley speculating out loud and in public about he and Harry’s sexual acts, looked up just in time to see the Golden Trio rushing out the doors of the Great Hall.
“Oh?” Draco raised an eyebrow.
Draco made a decision.
“You’re right. I’ll ring Parvati tonight and see if she has any advice. Maybe we should have encouraged them to be more independent, growing up…”
Draco read the note twice over without comment.
Draco winced.

“I actually have two matters to talk to you about, the second being quite delicate.” He told her.
“Look. I’ll think about what you said. I don’t think I’m going to end up marrying Jamie. But if it’s that important, I know Muggles have ways of making a baby without having…uh…well you know. Without marrying and…stuff.” Harry blushed again.

Draco retaliated for the tease by jabbing his fingers into the Gryffindor’s stomach in a tickling motion, then running for his life as his boyfriend came for revenge.
“Of course.” Draco said pleasantly. “So. Usually it’s something unimportant. But in this case I also happen to be annoyed with him.”
The children gathered round.
“I think I’d like to have my barrister with me. As is my right.” Draco said, stubbornly.
He pushed Potter towards the door.

Fred and George stopped for a moment, the wind taken out of their sails entirely.
“And I’m sure Mr. and Miss Weasley’s condition has nothing to do with that?”
“I’ve done my best to help you make a well-considered decision. The Dark Lord doesn’t need recruits who don’t realize what they’re-”
Jamie waited expectantly. It was a tactic he’d taught her. Don’t even ask, let the other person answer the question they imagine you want answered.
“Draco Malfoy! Shame on you putting yourself and Harry in danger that way! Why, you’re practically
Lucius looked at the younger man, surprised. This man was a wizard?
“Are you sure you know where you’re going?” Regulus whispered to his friend.
“Fine. Give this to Harry. And here, give him these too.” Draco handed her a small scroll and another long-stemmed rose. “Mind the thorns.”
“Fudge is buyable. I’m not concerned.”
“Thomas, and Zabini I believe?” Draco stepped forward offering his hand palm up, fingers spread to display no hostile magical devices.

“Yes. On condition.”
Draco nodded solemnly, every line of his body arranged to express a dignified respect, bordering on awe.

Lucius breathed a sigh as the low-level panic he’d had running in the background receded somewhat. Despite his somewhat rocky relationship with his son-in-law, Lucius knew one thing. Harry Potter-Malfoy was a wizard holding a magical heritage that was unprecedented since Merlin, and more importantly had the will to use that power to protect those he held dear. And Draco was the keenest advisor ever to stand behind such a throne. Whatever new darkness stirred, once warned they would not stop until all they had built was safe from it.
Draco crossed his own arms.
Harry threw himself into the high-backed seat across from his husband and glared at him.
“Just his hand.” Draco confirmed.

“Ronald? What kind of packages do swans carry?”
instinctual grasp?”
“I was afraid something like this might happen, eventually.”
Draco next noticed a very young version of the Weasley…riding what looked to be a stone horse.
“Of course. We’re both male, after all. No dowry, double the honeymoon.”
“The Dark Lord told us…”
“Potter?”
“Will nothing in my life ever be normal?”
With that the two Malfoys removed themselves from the office, casting several highly specialized and obscure locking charms on the door before leaving the entrance.
Draco hung up the phone, then waited a moment while the device built up a visible magical charge.
Draco observed, disgusted, as his father quickly fell to his knees.
, and we’ll call each other whatever we want.” Draco whispered fiercely.
“I’ll get you! Stupify!”
“That you did, my boy. Why was that? What was Mr. Malfoy’s mistake?”
“Yeah, I’d better introduce you and make sure Thomas keeps the claws in. He’s very territorial with him.”
Tom sat down at the table and placed his hands on the surface before him.
WHAT!?
“Where was Thomas?”
Then he remembered the list, and the Occlumency session he’d observed in Potter’s memories.
“It’s…it’s a muggle thing. Religion. I’ve never talked to Harry about it, really. I’m just telling you what he’s probably grown up around.”
“What is your name?”
He looked hard at Draco.
“The Lord Harry Potter is being courted by none other than…” Draco paused dramatically, “The Lord Draco Malfoy.”
Draco jumped and whirled around.
“Mrs. Weasley, this

“~~I don’t think it’s for snakes, guys.~~”
“What do you mean-”

His mother looked at him with a troubled gaze.
at him, and very dizzy from the potion Potter had apparently bathed in, the smell of which was filling the small space.
“I am sooo happy to meet all my new Hufflepuffs! I am Professor Tonks, you kids can all just call me Tonks, and I’ll be your Head of House! That means I’m sort of the parent of our little family-away-from-home here in Hufflepuff! So if any of you have any problems or just want to talk just ask and I’ll be right and ready to talk to you any time! I’ll also be teaching you guys Transfiguration but let’s let the school stuff wait until classes tomorrow! For now, let’s get to know each other! I’ll start, I’m Tonks, I have a husband Remus and a son Teddy. My best friend is Molly and my favorite thing to do is flying! Okay, now you!”
“Your
“I’m aware of the breakout, yes.”
Draco glared at the list. Each of the items seemed to make sense, even if a twisted sort of muggle-sense. But only individually. As a list…none of the items were consistent in every account of a courtship, and no predictable pattern was obvious to Draco.
His godfather was a traitor. Severus was working for Dumbledore
, so they were discussing whether or not it was a trap. The Golden Trio themselves were up by the Head table, whispering furiously with the Headmaster about something.
“Part of the ritual. Can you get me the set of potions from that satchel over there?” Draco asked.
Deserted.
Harry recoiled from the beautiful object in horror.
remember your Cloak, Potter.”
Professor Tonks got out all that in one long, fast, breathless sentence.
“So, how are you going to convince me that it’ll be worth it to wait to have sex with you?” Harry asked, and Draco thanked a lifetime of training for the fact that he did
“What, Jamie.”
Draco held his eyes for a moment. The message was clear. Draco was still, in fact, a Dark wizard. One who would use that branch of magic on Potters behalf. But Dark.
The man froze. Tom could see a tall, handsome man with dark skin standing behind him, his wand held delicately at the back of his neck.
Harry looked up at the Potions Master, something old, and painful, and compassionate in his eyes.
“Yes! Yes I will.” Harry said eagerly.
As he touched it, it rang.
“Likewise.” The child affirmed, shaking his hand, and not letting go.
“Will this work?”
“Lord Voldemort, I think the time for the marriage is drawing near. We should make appropriate plans.”
“You are Slytherin, Harry. As much as Gryffindor.”
“A spoilsport, Malfoy!”
Draco felt a heaviness of pain at the realization that this man he had loved from infancy was now less than what he was. He resisted the sharp sensation behind his eyes, knowing his father would be further diminished to see his son reduced to tears at his condition.
“Oh. The surprise? It’s just – Expelliarmus! Stupefy! Stupefy!”
been willing to do exactly that, something that Draco couldn’t exactly grill him for without explaining how he came to know the secret.
The snickers were cut off by Professor Snape’s next pronouncement.
“Fetch my writing set from my room.”
“Regulus?” James asked, incredulous, suddenly confronted with his brother’s terrified and betrayed face. “What are you doing here?”
“A threat? To Scorpius? Me? Is your master mad?

Over generations, magical traits are reinforced, made stronger, and the ancestral stores of magic are added to with each new magical birth, until they form a reservoir of magic that is unique and intelligent and
“Oh Harry! Please, don’t stop! Take me and make me yours!”
Finally Blaise stood up.
“You were not supposed to know that, gentlemen.”
A scuffling sound…a…a foot on the pavement?
Kreacher had settled down since, tolerating the rest of the family as long as he was permitted to follow Regulus around worshipfully.
“Alistor.” Dumbledore rebuked him.
“I’ve been calling your name for the last five minutes, Malfoy.” Blaise said, eyebrow raised in supplication. That had better be supplication.
“Just for the wedding? I…I’d really like to see you dressed up, with your hair curly like…like after the other one.”
…from the Killing Curse as well.
Blaise and Pansy arrived at exactly the appointed time. Draco nodded approvingly.
Draco looked at the boy, trying to decide how much to tell him. He’d known Blaise for a long time, they’d been conspirators and allies, and before that, playmates. They understood each other well. The boy was the very embodiment of
“One of many wonderful and terrifying things you’re about to learn of, my friend.”
Well, this explained why Potter hadn’t accepted the proposal of a marriage to Jamie. Draco would have to keep tabs on this pathetic little crush, hopefully Potter would lose his fixation and be more amenable in the future.
The hexes were lost in a powerful haze of overwhelming magic, Harry’s magic and Draco’s magic combining into an incredibly strong, incredibly sophisticated series of shields around them as they completed the ritual.
Draco reached the greenhouses with time to spare, walking over to the agreed-on spot and looking around for his betrothed, who had to be hiding under his Invisibility Cloak somewhere.

“Good. Blaise?”
“I like it when you say ‘our’.”
“So…it needs to work when we test it. But after it’s bottled and added to his stores…” Draco let the thought hang.
“Really?”
He stared at his reflection in the mirror. No, it was very nearly perfect. Just a bit more charm-work and he’d be back to his normal sexy self.
“There
“Well, the Gryffindors don’t seem to even know. But whoever it is, it’s controversial. The Golden Trio has been seen arguing more than normal, lately.” Pansy said.

He found her deep in animated conversation with a nervous-looking fellow wearing thick glasses and waving his hands around as he talked. He tapped her firmly on the shoulder.
attacked us!” Regulus added, pointing at where their assailant had been standing.”
Your magic will enter me through your seed. A blood pathway will channel my magic to you.”
The Planner hissed thoughtfully at this bit of philosophy, then nodded its agreement.
“Well, it's Sirius' fault, already signed and sealed. There’s no way to fix it in this generation.”
Draco squeezed his hand softly in warning.
“Draco. Perhaps I am not the person most suited to give you…
And Harry Potter
Potter winced at the use of his last name.
Two hours later Draco was black and blue, and more tired than he’d ever been.
“Oh. Hmm, with the changes you made I suppose the standard antidote isn’t wise. Take him to the hospital wing for a charms-based cure.” Snape said absently, then walked off muttering, “Glumbumble and sopohorus. Hmm, I wonder if…”
“The stone will keep your phoenix from entering the office, and wand-magic is useless inside this room. With the door magically locked, you’ll be in here until the portkey activates – and then it will be far too late for you to intervene.”
Regulus tested the knob, and it turned easily. Together they slowly pushed the door open.
Disgusting.
“Tempurature raised by…uh…fourteen degrees Celsius, the waveform would disperse when no longer in contact with the nitrogen. Oh holy Jesus.”
“Right! See you Malfoy.” Potter said awkwardly.
“Draco! Please tell me what happened? Did you and Harry have a fight?”
It was lopsided, clearly wrapped by hand…as in a human hand, not an elf. And the name-tag bore the label “To Draco Malfoy, from Molly Weasley.”
“I expect he’ll nevertheless want to hear what I have to say.” Draco replied.
“You were in the bath, and…touching yourself, so I used a spell I know to make the water touch you too. It’s a progressive spell, so I have to keep feeding it. Like Leviosia. But then your magic recognized my magical signature…and, of course our cores are always hungry for each other now. Normally we’re both doing things to each other, and close enough to touch, so we feed off each other at the same time – balancing each other. But this was one-way.”
A strange yellow glow settled around him.
“Okay. I’m…uh…sorry.” Potter said awkwardly, finally pulling his arm away.
Scrimgeour looked worried. One thing to take the hard line on nasty Malfoys, but he didn't want his Aurors brutalizing young wealthy Scions of powerful families. That sort of image was political suicide.
“No they won’t, the Healer said Papa fainted when the baby was born and will need his rest, and Daddy looked really tired too.”
Draco gave his son the evil eye and Regulus shut up.
“You forget the matter of Harry Potter, boy.” Voldemort said.
“Think about it,
“We joined. With a
His hand crept under the sheet, inching towards Draco’s crotch.
Draco tapped another icon with his wand, and observed depicted below him the Dark Lord’s greatest fear and greatest wish.
“I said nice punch.”
“Perfume? Muggles put
Interesting.
Draco looked up and around himself. Harry was apparently still gathering his props for lessons tomorrow. He bent down and whispered to the infant.
The moon shone down benignly from a ceiling enchanted to show a starry night sky. In the center of the room, the bassinet was a gleaming white under the soft moonlight.
“Draco, you’re closest to him, and a Slytherin. You should talk to him.” Harry said.
He stopped short.
Finally, the robes were in a small puddle at Harry’s feet, and Draco almost groaned in frustration as he saw the Gryffindor was wearing full muggle regalia underneath. The shirt slipped effortlessly over Harry’s touseled head, baring tawny skin stretched richly across a lean musculature. Draco eyed the smooth tan skin for a moment while Harry tugged futilely at his trousers.
with magical artifacts?”
The other heads hissed and muttered in angry disagreement.
The boys screamed.
“In the meantime, let’s try to keep a cool head about this. Draco is confident the evil of Voldemort was purged. We’ve been cleaning up random pieces of his old spellwork for the last decade, and taking a cautious and unpanicked approach has always been best for that. The Dark Mark is a particularly ugly piece of magic, but I don’t see any reason we should abandon the methodology that has worked so well for it.”
“Gentlemen. There will be no fighting in the Hospital Wing. Mr. Malfoy, here is a potion to heal your ribs and another to reset your joint. Mr. Potter, you’re in rather worse condition, you’ll take a bit more work.” Pomfrey glared at Draco before handing him two vials.
Thomas frowned at that.
Potter was gaping.
that!”
All of this, he saw in the crafty glint of the Mudblood’s eyes as she briskly ushered Ron towards the Prefects bath.
seek his notice!” Draco explained in a hushed voice.
Potter was just coming out of the washroom. Draco quickly slipped his hand into his pocket and pulled out the blank scroll he’d shrunk there, quickly enlarging it and holding it innocently in his free hand as he pointed his wand.
Draco scowled, and allowed it was possible.
“Are you
“Thoughtful in what way?”
Draco cut off that line of thought before it led to another activity from research, altogether.
. You’ll forgive me if I’m a bit skeptical.” He said cautiously.
The white pillars of the candlesticks formed a cordon, all the way down the considerable length of the Head table, the gold candleholders with their exquisite carvings gleaming softly against the deep green of the tablecloth. The tongues of flame at the tops of the candles, up above their heads, like a line of soft-white fire casting shadows whose direction changed with the slightest puff of breeze.
“What’s this?”
Harry’s sensitive ears caught something anyways.
The slight falter in his father’s step was barely discernable, and Draco realized the Dementors had somewhat thinned the man’s implacable will. Still, Draco didn’t allow his dismay at that thought keep him from driving the final blow, by sitting behind the massive desk and leaving his father a seat before it.
“Because it’s the right thing to do, ‘Mione! Hell, if even the ferret can see that you should be able to! She’s his daughter and never knew him, and Harry did even though he’s not really his son. It’s not fair to her, she’s a real Black! How would you like it if you were taken from your parents at birth and someone else replaced you?” Weasley argued.
“What about Potter?” Draco asked.
Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step.
“But I like being Jamie!”
“Puff. I’ll inform him.” The boy said curtly.
His twin Regulus Sirius leapt into action, sliding noiselessly past James and down the darkened corridor, padded feet sliding gently on the polished wood floor. In seconds, Regulus arrived at THE corner, the one that overlooked the DOOR.
Draco examined the connections to Weasel and Granger. These were the only really strong attachments Potter seemed to have.
Moody seemed to understand that, at least.
“Harry, please no?” Draco asked desperately.
“Jimmy, and Frederick, and Susie, and Donny, and Sam!” Harry grinned back, pointing at each child in turn. “Kids, this is Draco, my- oh, Moony,
Severus was telling him indirectly that he should try to reverse their present antagonism. But was that even possible?
“What was that, Nott?” Draco asked dangerously.
“~~Hey! Where did you get that?~~”
“You’re the Heir of Gryffindor, Harry.” Granger said dismissively. “Anyways. The first is a very old family heirloom. I wonder what Malfoy chose…surely not something dark I hope!”
“We’re you’re big brothers.”
Draco changed sides.
Draco exhaled and held his breath to counteract the flush that rose. Somehow he felt like Lupin knew he’d blushed anyways.
“What are you suggesting?”
No Ravenclaws studying.
The entire common room shuddered at the idea of actually marrying a Mudblood. Consummation with their raw, uncultivated young magic was rumored to be an experience that was both extreme and scarring…wizards who’d secretly mated with Mudblood witches were often unable to enjoy relations with their proper wives from then on.
Draco frowned slightly, knowing Thomas had successfully scared off his friend from trying to hold his brother. They would need to have another talk about his territorial instincts with regard to Scorpius.
“We have some questions for Mr. Malfoy, here.”
“Yes I will, Malfoy.” Potter said, his voice raw with loneliness.
“It always is. At least they won’t have all the issues we had to deal with at that age.”
“You’ve met my father. What do you think?”
“This is very,
This was no place for a baby. Wherever the train would go, perhaps there would at least be food there.
“So first fill the reaction vessel with liquid nitrogen.”
“This is…I can’t possibly accept this! It’s far too much!”
Finally Harry seemed satisfied with his efforts, and turned to Draco. His eyes looked troubled and…afraid.
A tall lanky teen laughed uproariously as he tumbled in the grass, a large black dog and a small crowd of children rolling on the ground with him. Chuckling some more as the big wolf managed to pin him on his back for a round of sloppy doggy kisses.
Draco stared. His godfather was hinting that he should consider…what? Joining the Light?
, Headmaster, could you please just tell us what you found?” Hermione growled impatiently.
The girl looked shifty.
“Harry, it’s the middle of the night.”
“Oh! Fleur, yeah, she’s well…yeah, she’s amazing! Mom just loves her!”
would most certainly not be carrying it.” Draco sniffed. “Not that that’s likely to happen anyways. Considering…well…
“Nothing. I thought we were already handling family business.”
“Gringotts Bank Office, Wards and Curses Division, Office of-”
Harry still was looking to the side, over Draco’s shoulder. The beautiful green eyes staring at the wall behind him as if to forget he was there.
Despite the distraction of the amorous mop and the scrub brush, which was now using its follicles to lovingly fondle the curve of Draco’s arse, he found himself responding to Harry’s magic.
“That is…the most…fucked up thing I ever heard in my life!” Harry wheezed, holding his side.
Lily Evans had been rumored to be an extremely powerful Mudblood witch, only a Potter or a Weasley could possibly have handled the amounts of raw magic that would have been her part of the exchange that happens during consummation. Or the Gaunts or Zabinis of the Dark families, though the latter would be an extremely unhealthy alliance for the Mudblood involved.
“Scream for me, Harry.”
“Um. Well actually, Hermione made me buy new clothes.” Potter muttered.
Draco squeezed his knee comfortingly under the table.
“Um…I’m Regulus. Potter-Malfoy Black.” Regulus offered his hand hesitantly.
Draco observed himself as his lip lifted in a sneer. Definitely himself. How could he be Potter’s weakness?
Draco ignored the Dark Lord’s amusement as he carefully closed the bag, tying the drawstring shut.
And as a result, their rituals seemed sporadic and without pattern to Draco’s unfamiliar eye.
“You’re right. So…what are you blackmailing Professor Snape for?” Blaise knew better than to try to pry after the information that would give Draco leverage over the man. There were limits, after all.
“So keep them off-balance, on the defensive.” Harry summed up.
The tone was friendly and complimentary at every turn, but the odd turn of phrase here and there…seemed to be just holding back from a more hostile viewpoint on just about every topic. Draco winced at the mention of the Philosopher’s Stone, Rita was basically implying that Harry Potter had kept it for his own use, when everyone knew Dumbledore had destroyed the thing.
“Hi.”
“Have you ever
His enemies:
“Well, from my research, I understand it is customary to have sexual intercourse during the courtship process.” Draco leaned forward intensely, hoping to make his argument more compelling.  “Harry...I
Potter nodded, slipping it out of his pocket and putting it over his head.
“Ah, you’ve a strong sense of justice. I wonder if I should put you in Gryffindor this time? How ironic that would be! But no, for you I sense it must be either Ravenclaw or Slytherin.”
“You’re…Lord Malfoy…afraid…Mrs. Weasley’s cooking…trans fats…because they’ll make you fat!”
“Yessss! Now be quiet! If we get caught in here there will be SO much trouble!” Lysander hissed at him, tugging relentlessly on his hand, studying the movement of the local invisible creatures for a moment before pulling Regulus decisively to one carved door, its intimidating surface inscribed with three massive characters, “H1B”.
“Malfoy?” The boy looked up attentively. The Slytherin had been leaving Draco alone while he was brooding, now was time for action.
“Uh…guys…”
Harry blushed crimson.
, Potter. We
end up in Slytherin?” he asked Harry, wonderingly.
Tom reluctantly relinquished Scorpius to Harry with a stern admonishment that his brother would be due for feeding in thirty minutes and that his father had best remember that the infant preferred his milk warmed with just a very light sweetening spell. Harry took the child with appropriate assurances and shooed the teen off to “go make some friends and don’t be shy”.
“Let’s go.”
His mother followed him persistently.
, I can feel your magic burning into me?”
that silly phobia to establish his early foothold in the dangerous world of House politics.
“Jamie! Jamie!”
“Yes, thank you Thomas! I hope that you will call me Orpheus?”
“The Black line-”
Draco leaned back, relaxed.
Some of the older students chuckled at that, though Harry caught an air of playful menace in a few that rather reminded him of the Weaseley twins.
“What? What secrets about me? I helped you solve your riddle, surely you can grant me this small favor?” Tom asked.
“Come on, we have to sit down for this.”
“Well, what if we split up?”
Malfoy has been…
“Hush Ronald! Of course he knows! That’s the only possible explanation for this!”
An hour later Draco was staring confusedly at the magically inscribed parchment. Harry Potter in the middle, his friends and allies, apparently grouped and ranked in order of importance:
“See? There’s that big Potter heart showing through! You’d do anything for Regulus, wouldn’t you?”
Jamie paused in her conversation, then turned around slowly, looking at the Gryffindor expectantly.
Potter sighed as Ron walked off.
“You’re an unpredictable variable in a delicate situation.” Draco told him. “So I’m removing you.”
“Mr. Malfoy. I’m afraid I’m going to have to strongly suggest you find another incantation. This one is quite dangerous. And it could result in a very unpleasant sentence to Azkaban.”
Draco raised his wand and cast a glamour, then a notice-me-not charm on the bag before turning to leave the room.
Draco admired her technique for a long moment. The bed warmer was a very awkward weapon for self-discipline, as it involved a four-foot long handle, at the end of which was a round pan, sealed closed by a lid. The pan was endowed with a multitude of charms to preserve the toasty state of the warmed sheets for the remainder of the night.
“Tell me he threatened to sue!”
“What did I ever do to deserve you?”
Draco would hold him to it.
“What?!” Granger pressed.
“The one called Jamessssss, foolisssssh one-head. Who else could it be?” The Critic snapped.
“Refusing to say his name gives him more power-” Potter started to object.
In seconds, there was a tangled mess exhausted of children, teen, and wolf on the lawn, each feebly attempting small vengeful attacks on the others. Interrupted nicely by the clanging bell that signaled dinner.
Draco smiled at him.
“Potter. You have to understand something. You may trust Granger, but
“Come swim with me, Harry.” Draco almost whispered the words.
the War, I think the Magic should take the form of a protective charm.” Draco told them.
“Promise.”
“Well. I suggest you get some food in your stomach then.”
The phrasing of the letter was according to the traditional formula for the first stage of the Heirloom, Magic, Blood ritual.
“Of courrssse. But tell me, young Lord Malfoy, why you do not offer a life-long gift asss your fathhher?”
“If we’re a family, doesn’t that mean I get a whole bunch of big brothers to pick on me?”
“Well, let’s just say I used a few Slytherin tricks to get you free from your normal duties to help me out with something a lot more important.”
“You weren’t in the bed.” Harry moved forward, putting a hand each on Regulus’ and James’ shoulders as he drew them towards where his husband held the infant.
Draco paused. He
“No. I’m not quite finished.”
“Yeah, keep hitting or he’ll get you back guys!”
Harry’s hands shook as his fingers grazed the smooth sanded surface of the oak door.
“Yes…did they separate you, too?”
Draco nodded, with one of those

“Child. The girl’s been raised by Muggles, basic logic and analyticial thinking have to be impressed from birth.”
going to be a part of them whether you’re ready or not!” he fumed.
“Harry! My goodness! What are you doing here?” the old man exclaimed.
“Family business.” Draco said.
“Both these subjects will be taught in a workshop format by one of our two new additions to the Professorial staff here at Hogwarts, which I am

“In the middle of the night? But…but then we’ll be asleep!”
with that kind of information!” she cooed.
Regulus and James both focused on Tommy, interested at the prospect of a tale of magical daring-do. Their fathers had told them very dry, matter-of-fact stories of their adventures that tended to suck all the fun out of them.
“Mr. Malfoy will eat with us.” Mrs. Weasley said firmly.

one of Molly’s celebration dinners a week ago! I can’t take another!” Draco panted to his husband.
“Cut his nose off to spite his face. Or…A.K. a fly on his own nose.” Potter smirked.
“Dark magic, Jamie.
“There really
“Like what kinds of things can they do?”
“Have your Cloak?”
“So what’s it like living with them? We hear all sorts of stories. Do they really duel over breakfast and then start doing sex stuff right in the middle of the fight?”
“Indeed my Lord.”
“Yeah, I bet we can make even some of the older kids scream if you sneak up on them with it!”
She looked about to run over and start filling her arms with books when Ron grabbed her arm.
“You foolsssss, hissssing about nonssssenssse when we have a missssion to perform. Alwaysssss the endlesssss debate, never a ressssst, never a moment’sssss peace for your idiocy!” the Critic whined.
“Of course we will! We’re both of excellent bloodlines, powerful magic, intelligent, and of course gorgeous. Our children will be perfect!”
“You have a visitor.” Molly said.
Draco cast a localized Notice-Me-Not on the flower.
The creature squirmed, but didn’t deny it.
“Nothing.” Draco stepped past the angry redhead and on down the corridor.
Then, involve Potter as an accessory?
Draco smirked. There was indeed such a spell, but even Harry didn't need to know
That would change, he resolved.
“Good.”
“Uh…I didn’t much care for it actually.” Tom said with a straight face.
“Come in mother.”
bounce the Killing Curse off his forehead as an infant. That’s quite…extreme, for accidental magic.” He finally said.
Harry guided his husband, the baby still in his arms, out of the nursery into the hallway.
“Like Dumbledore?”
Draco looked hard at the connection. A glimpse of Ginny Weasley, flying on her broom, cheeks flushed and eyes dancing with merriment. Then she was lying on a stone floor somewhere, and Potter was rushing to her, gathering her up in his arms.
Pansy let out a gasp, her hands covering her mouth in horror as her eyes grew huge in shocked disbelief.
“Gender?” he asked, weakly.
“Frankie, meet Hissyfit!”
Draco sneered, secretly hoping that Harry would grab him by the lapels of the muggle suit he was wearing and
“Go on, young Lord Malffffoy.”
And well-done, too. Dizzy was holding the handle about a foot from the end, her small hands poised down at knee-level, snapping the brass pan up towards her face with admirable precision.
Draco accioed his gift and placed it in Harry’s hands, kneeling next to his bony knees where he could see his expression.
The Ravenclaws were speculating on the identity of the translucent rod that had been spotted, as well as the implications of what could only be Heirloom, Magic, Blood – the rumors from second year about Harry Potter being the Heir of Slytherin were being brought up again and ruthlessly analyzed.
“Ron! Be nice!” Granger scolded the redhead, then turned to Draco.
“I heard the Hogwarts Express is the size of a house, bigger even!”
Draco positioned himself carefully, downwind of the three.
“You’re getting homework help from a Mudblood!?” Pansy exclaimed, shocked.
“None other.”
“Do take him away.”
Draco handed Bill two small scrolls written in his own hand.
to go.”
“You can open them now.”
“Very true. Which makes it very fortunate that the Dark Lord was so kind as to make Harry Potter his magical heir.” Draco said idly.
“Product of one of those sordid prison romances, no doubt,” Blaise commented dryly.
Harry’s hips slammed upward and Draco carefully pinned him down to the bed at the waist as he sucked lightly at the viscous substance.
Potter held out for a good three seconds before falling to his knees and retching explosively into the toilet.
Potter swallowed, looking down at the lumpy canvas bag.
Potter nodded, drawing his wand.
James frowned.
“Then let us be reconciled.” Arthur finished.
The twins paused and glanced guiltily up at the balcony to see if their father had witnessed their dreadful
“It’s Professor Dumbledore! He can see invisible things!”
“Yeah, so what business is it of yours?”
Arthur held out his own bloody hand as well.
“Oh no. I won’t be taking over Grimmauld. Sirius had a daughter, and I’ve persuaded Potter to gift her with the Black estate as his rightful heiress.”
“I’ve changed my name to Thomas Marvolo Slytherin, you can still call me Tom though.” He said a bit shyly.
Then he took his husband’s face in his hands and whispered to him fiercely.

of casting a familiar green-colored curse at…Draco himself. A vicious, rabid-looking version of Draco, face twisted into a rictus of hatred, a similar green glow just growing on the end of his wand.
“You heard the strategy. Take advantage of their Keeper and Chaser having to fly for their lives, yeah? Run up the score.”
Molly chuckled.
didn’t get it. You can’t deny, Sirius Black was the type to A.K. a fly perched on his own nose, if he got mad enough.”
It was several hours before Draco could get away by himself to examine the scroll.

The two grinned at each other, and knew they’d each made a true friend.
