She buried her hands in the soft grass, plucking a few strands and running them through her fingers. "The things they told us in class, in History of Magic… Dad, they were so matter-of-fact, and then we had to discuss different causes of the war, and there was a project on major contributing factors to the progress of the war. It went on for weeks, and almost all of it was around you and our family. And I couldn't react because people were watching, but so much of it, I was learning for the first time."
Pansy snorted. "Pervert. Okay, Potter, stand up and let's get this moving. Find something here you like and use your wand."
So Draco sat in the front row of the auditorium, watching as Harry took a deep, steadying breath and began his story.
He feels his face get hot. It's kind of embarrassing to have a song, but Lyra has special songs too. There's one that Daddy sings to her when she's upset and one he sings her when he's happy and they're playing.
Harry shushed her. "This is how they do things, sweetie. He already stayed with you and Papa longer than they wanted him to."
Harry closed his eyes at the mention of Dudley's name. "I told him I'd be here. I'm the only family he has left. I mean, there's Marge, but Merlin, I can't imagine she'll be any comfort."
It was almost an hour before Hermione arrived at St Mungo's. Draco had managed to pull himself together, clean his face, and get some tea for himself and his aunt. His mother had arrived to keep her company, so Draco was sitting in the waiting area when Hermione stalked down the hallway from the lifts.
Like that shop up the block with its formal, black canvas that covered the entrance. It was softened by the flower displays spilling out onto the pavement, practically begging the passing shopper to stop and admire the blooms.
"And the bigger picture is that I love you." Draco sighed and lowered his voice. "I would give you everything because you're my family. But I have to let you do the same."
Draco rolled his eyes. "I did. We can't force the issue, but I can punish her for being disrespectful. I won't let that slide."
"Guess so. There are some apples and pears on top if you're hungry now." He looked back at the files on his desk. "Anyway, I think we need to question the neighbour again."
There was a chain hanging from the little ceiling next to a bare bulb, and Draco took it, pulled, and gasped.
"They're an approved foster family, Draco," Hermione chided, pushing her hair behind her ear. They take care of children until we can find them a permanent family. It'll be okay. They're trained for it."
"Thanks." Draco crossed the room to where Molly sat on a kitchen chair, a sobbing Alex in her arms. "Hi, Alex. Molly. What's going on?"
"Yeah, you know, one of those little, smelly, crying things that looks like a mandrake?" Ron challenged, and Hermione slapped his knee.
I swallowed the lump in my throat and nodded, unable to muster up the 'fine' I generally responded with to such inane questions. Of course, I wasn't okay. I was twenty-nine years old, and I was going home to an empty, silent house, devoid of laughter and love.
His hair was soft, and I trailed my fingers down the short lock that fell close to his left eye, letting the tips trace along his sharp cheekbone, slowly memorising the feel of his face under my touch.
"And then she adds stuff to it. Broccoli, carrots, whatever vegetable is handy, usually. And that's when she's not adding additional helpings of meat or potatoes or whatever."
I was not mourning. I knew Teddy wasn't dead. I was happy for my godson, and from the letters he sent every couple of days, I knew he was having a blast at school. He'd made new friends and was getting up to the appropriate levels of mischief.
"Draco?" Harry said, the question in his voice familiar. Draco didn't know how to answer; he just knew that he needed to think this through, that the entire situation wasn't sitting right with him.
Draco Malfoy was his friend. Not just a friendly-type person Harry sometimes did homework with, but someone Harry now sought out to talk to when something was on his mind. Or when he wanted to share a snack, like now.
"He's alone, Draco." Her voice was so quiet as she spoke. "They don't want him. Obviously, we wouldn't even let his father's family make a claim if they tried. The case against them is pretty ironclad, but the old pure-blood nonsense is still strong in Spain and it's looking more and more like they might get off with only fines and a slap on the wrist." She scowled. "Their Minister insists they've—and I quote—'suffered enough with the loss of both their sons.' Never mind that they were an indirect cause of one's death and a direct cause of the other's."
"Draco," Harry whined, but in the bottom of his stomach was that thrill he got when Draco got like this. He refused to admit to it, though.
Arthur is coming to sit with Harry, so you need to go home and sleep in your own bed. Molly is at the house with Lyra and Alex, cooking up a storm and filling your kitchen with food. Go home, sleep, shower, and reassure your daughter."
He kept hold of her hand and walked her to the sofa in the sitting room, which Molly had mercifully cleared of the other children. Draco could hear them upstairs giggling.
Three weeks later, I'd not even felt up to leaving the house, let alone doing something productive like cleaning or working on my stories…or even taking a shower. But it was Hermione's birthday, and Ron had made plans, insisting I tag along.
Harry scowled then raised his wand and threw up a charm to prevent the sounds of the kitchen from escaping. The Crup and cat had already made their escapes at the first signs of discord. It wasn't often anymore that Draco and Harry had an all-out brawl, but when it did, it was epic enough that the pets remembered.
Draco stood up, his bones creaking, and walked into the bathroom, grabbing a flannel and running water over it to wipe up his face. His eyes were swollen from crying, and he looked a mess. He took a deep breath, then let it out slowly, watching a bit of colour re-enter his cheeks. "It's Monday, I believe," he finally answered Harry. "Around four in the morning."
I turned for the door before remembering my plans for the day — the plans that had so far been decimated and squashed into bicorn powder. At least I could still apologise and get that off my list.
Draco put everything back into the basket, his stomach twisting at Potter's expression. They usually ate lunch together, and as much as he wanted to try the delightful basket of food, he didn't like how it made him feel. "Wait!"
"Don't be. It only matters to the ridiculous pure-bloods he and my mother socialise with. It doesn't matter to anyone else, certainly not me."
Harry took a step back. It was too soon. He couldn't listen to this now. He had a whole day to get through. "No—"
Draco watched as Harry stepped to the podium, the spotlight falling over him in the darkened hall. The audience quieted, and Draco's stomach turned with nerves and anticipation.
I also posted another story tonight outside this series. It's a one-shot with a Squib OC (no pairing), but there's a baby Harry involved, and I'm a little bit proud of it. It's called
In the down moments between tasks, the darkness would close back in, the negative thoughts encroaching on my resolve to keep going, telling me I wasn't good enough, that I was alone, that I was useless. But I'd think of Draco, of the fire in his eyes when he told me I had friends who loved me, and the memory would push it all back.
Gathii turned to me, his broad smile lighting his gorgeous eyes, and one feeling certainly became clear.
And Harry's mouth, his ever-moving, ever-twitching, ever-expressive mouth with the lips that Draco loved to kiss and sometimes still, even after all these years, itched to punch from time to time—he didn't, of course, but no one knew how to get under his skin like Harry—this mouth was still. So still. So lifeless.
"It's after ten; Lyra will already be in bed, and from what I'm told, Alex is tucked in next to her. What
So he did. Well, he told them everything he thought Harry would be comfortable sharing, but seeing as how Harry wasn't really opening up, there wasn't much he had to leave out. Mostly, it was just the details he skipped over — they didn't need to know about the panic attack or glassy eyes.
"But then this came from Andi," he said and held out the letter, watching her scan the words. "And Harry's not home, and Teddy—"
Draco's shoulders fell and his stomach unclenched. Right. Teddy. He pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped at his nose. "He's okay. You got him here in time, and they healed him right up. He's sleeping at the moment, but he's up and about. I'm sure he'll be in here as soon as he's awake again."
Harry's throat hurt. Draco wasn't going to make him talk about it all, he wasn't going to have to put this all into words and try to explain. No, Draco just understood.
"…doesn't look good, but he's here and they're working on him. Let Malfoy sleep. I'll send you an update as soon as we have it."
"I don't even know how to do that!" I hissed, trying to keep my voice down, not wanting to wake Teddy. "It's a ridiculous idea. I'm just me, not a writer."
Draco chuckled. "So does mine, idiot. Here." Draco cast a quick Breath-Freshening Charm on Harry, then one on himself. He smiled gently like he understood. "This doesn't change anything; either you're bent or you're not. This will just help you know one way or the other. If you don't like it, you'll know. If you do, then you can decide if it's worth it."
Harry stared at a bird on the veranda, picking at something in the flower pots. Petunia and Vernon were dead.
He rarely let me forget it in the years to come, as my small collection of stories soon became a larger series, each fantastically decorated by Luna Lovegood and then eagerly published by a Muggle publishing house. And when they were being carried in Flourish and Blotts two years later, nobody seemed to care that they were written by H.J. Evans. They simply bought them anyway.
"Don't you think it might help?" Hermione's voice was gentle, and I could tell she was restraining herself from nagging at me, which I really did appreciate.
"I'd like that," Harry said, and the answering grin on Draco's face made Harry's stomach warm. He followed the man into the back of the shop and watched as Draco began to skillfully build the bouquet for Susan.
And if Harry's name sped things along, Draco didn't mind. He wasn't as self-effacing as his husband was.
Tindles, Draco's house-elf, stepped from the cupboard in the hallway where she'd Apparated from the manor.
Draco scooted closer, gently rubbing the cloth across Harry's oily forehead, wiping away the crust around his eyes. Harry leaned into the touch like a cat seeking a caress, and Draco felt his eyes burn again at the thought that he'd almost lost this man. His mind sought another topic, trying to distract his anxiety from spiralling.
Harry paused at the end of the hallway as it opened into the common room, taking in the noise and movement of his classmates. Everyone seemed to be gathered in groups around the large central table they'd made from the smaller workbenches last November. It had been the Hufflepuffs' idea, and he found he really liked it, allowing everyone to study together despite their houses.
"Papa!" Lyra said when she noticed Teddy's attention had turned. "Teddy's going home today. He had an adventure with Daddy, but it wasn't a very nice one."
"Please come out and have some dinner. I thawed some of Molly's vegetable soup that you love so much."
"We sent a team to the location of the report…" Hermione's voice grew quiet, and Draco met her eyes.
"Because you weren't ready," he said quietly, and I realised I must have spoken aloud. My face heated.
Draco's stomach felt sour, so he got up, stirred the simmering meat on the cooker before preparing a pot of tea. He didn't say much, just thought about his own family, the way Lucius would have reacted if he would have even spoken kindly to a Muggle, let alone deem to marry one. He could understand why they'd try to send her family away, why they'd relocate to another country themselves.
I jerked. Teddy. Oh my God. Teddy. He'd lost so much, and now his grandmother was gone, too. The war was over. Stuff like this wasn't supposed to happen anymore.
Draco looked at his watch and sighed. "This is what I get for deciding to stay in the common room on a Saturday instead of finding some quiet, hidden room somewhere. Come on." He stood up and held his hand out for Harry. Harry took it, and Draco pulled him to his feet.
It sounded like one of the pets, like maybe one of them was crying, but as Draco stepped into the bedroom and pulled on his pyjamas, he noticed Cat asleep on the bed, Caius in the hallway outside the children's doors, and Thalia was off delivering a letter to Blaise and Charlie on the continent.
He went through the morning in an exhausted fog, like a hangover from the days of stress and upset. Getting the children moving, dressed, fed, was more than twice the work of doing it for just Lyra. Having babysat Hermione's kids often enough, it wasn't too far out of his comfort zone, but in his current state, it was almost more than he wanted to manage.
"You have a lot of nerve coming here," she said, her eyes narrowed and her chin held high. "Though I suppose even a hellion like you may have eventually learned a bit of gratitude."
"So, that's it. There's no family," Hermione said finally, accepting the cup of tea Draco handed her with a sad but grateful smile.
Papa says that it's what you think of as family that really matters, and that blood or adoptions have nothing to do with it. Papa is pretty smart, so he must be right.
When he didn't move to take it, she nudged his hand. "You have to eat. Harry needs you to be strong. Lyra needs you to be healthy. Eat."
Which was ridiculous and melodramatic. Of course someone would adopt him, give him a family, and he'd grow up happy and loved. Draco just hoped that whoever they were, they deserved this brave child.
Draco looked interested and reached for it, beginning to read the cover as another song called "Lightning Crashes" played, and it was fucking brilliant. Harry couldn't keep the grin off his face.
He let her attempt the cut and it came out rather well, actually. But the entire ordeal left him exhausted, and thankfully, everyone had left. Except for Draco.
"He did, but he wasn't in time to save Alex's mummy and daddy. He doesn't have any brothers or sisters or grandparents to be here with him right now, either, so Aunt Hermione and I are watching him until they can find someone."
Hermione raised an eyebrow. "Grunge, huh? Okay, let's try…" She started rifling through the pile, but Theo slid one to the top and pushed it to her.
"What about the rest of the family's things," Draco asked quietly, remembering Harry's lack of any of his parents' belongings. "We can't just leave everything there to be thrown away."
Yet, he'd done it. He'd lain himself bare for everyone to see, and fuck, he'd been amazing. He'd stood up there in front of a room full of strangers and told about his own personal demons. Harry wanted to help people, as usual, wanted to bring them hope. It was one of the things that Draco loved most about Harry, his boundless love for people he didn't even know.
He thought about the jungle and the loch. Wild and lonely. "I want to understand," he finally said and met Harry's deep green eyes. "When you're ready."
"Merlin, you're an angsty fuck, aren't you?" Draco asked. "If you want to be happy, tell everyone to fuck off and do what you want to do. It should be easier for you, shouldn't it? Everyone already likes you."
"Breathe," Luna said quietly, and she took his hand in hers, her cool fingers bringing him back to the moment. "You're enough as you are. Forget all that. Just be Harry."
"Oh, God." I heard a long whine, as though an animal were in pain, and with detached interest, I realised the sound was coming from me.
Draco took a deep breath. Harry was going to be okay, and it'd not do to make Teddy fret about what was past. "He was hurt pretty badly. They couldn't identify the curse, and it was making his magic behave erratically. They had to keep him in stasis for a couple of days until they could figure it out."
That's why his absence was so difficult. He was such an intricate part of every facet of my life. Even my work, my stories, revolved around an iteration of him that would forever be eight years old.
Simon always told me that when you feel too much, you should try to pull it apart into individual emotions. So, I found a little park near the stadium and sat on a bench, running through everything that had just happened, sifting through all the feelings spinning in my body, trying to make sense of it all.
She whirled on him. "My parents are fine because I was able to find them after the war and reverse it. And they had money, and I forged visas for them, and they were skilled professionals. My parents were fine because of
Harry barked out a laugh, and Draco grinned. Lyra's special paint set had been a major point of contention between the children, and Draco had already bought a set for Alex to unwrap for Christmas.
"And we're lucky to have him. That's what family is, Draco. It goes two ways. It doesn't matter if you're blood-related or if the child just wanders in from a flying car in the middle of the night. Once they're yours, they're yours. And you're theirs. It's really that simple."
Soft blond locks of hair framed Draco's face, making Harry's fingers itch to push them back. There was a promise in his old rival's grey eyes, and it was one Harry realised he wanted to claim. It was more than just the perfect arse, though that was definitely part of it. No, Harry wanted to see what made this new Malfoy tick. He wanted to hear how he got here to this adorable little shop in Belgravia.
Draco's eyes stung, and he reached for Harry's head, pulling it down so their foreheads rested against one another, their noses nearly touching. "I would still have suffered."
Harry rolled his eyes, but they landed on Alex and narrowed. "Whatever you need to do, yeah. He needs a place to feel safe while they locate his family." Harry held out his hand. "You're a good man, Draco Malfoy."
"We don't have to go in," Draco said quietly. He could feel the emotions pouring from Harry, but he couldn't quite tell what they were. Dread, for sure, but there was so much more. "Dudley would understand."
Draco turned to the large man, Harry's cousin who'd been the same age, who'd lived in this house while Harry slept in a cupboard under the stairs like a house-elf.
"I keep them separated by season and occasion. It won't look like this many when I'm done," Draco explained. "The bigger question is, how do you exist with only three pairs?"
Dudley looked much the same as he'd always looked, just older and slightly slimmer, especially around the face. He'd grown into his body, and though he was still big, he looked comfortable in his skin. His red-rimmed eyes brightened when Harry and Draco entered the church.
His eyes were glazed over, his mind clearly a million miles, or perhaps twenty years, away. Occasionally, a tear would slip from the corner of his eye, but he didn't appear to be aware of it. He only held on tight to Draco's hand.
"I've got you," he said into my ear while the reality of it all clicked into place, the grief slicing through me. So I held on.
"We'll go first." Draco tossed the powder into the fire, called out his destination, and then stepped through. Alex whimpered as they spun, but then it was over and Draco stepped out into the St Mungo's reception, which was blessedly empty of visitors. He gave Alex a little squeeze. "We're here. You can open your eyes and watch for Lyra."
"No! If you weren't here, where would Pa be? And I wouldn't be here! Alex would be Merlin-knows-where, but not here, with us, with people who love him. And you'd be dead because…what? Because you're some bloody hero?"
"I—I don't understand. I just saw her yesterday when I dropped Teddy home. She was fine." I felt numb; I knew I should be feeling something,
He ran to the Floo in Harry's office, tossing in the powder and calling out the Floo address. "Hermione," he called out as soon as the flames turned green, sticking his head through the flames. "Hermione!"
The first thing that hit Harry was the smell. It was exactly the same, that intense, synthetic lemon scent that his aunt preferred in her cleaning supplies. He hated it, and the scent memories that came with it reminded him of hot summer days spent scrubbing his aunt's floors, wiping down the bathroom, polishing the woodwork. The smell would coat Harry's hands and no amount of scrubbing would get it out. And then at night, in the cupboard, the smell would be so intense it'd burn his throat and eyes.
"Nonsense," Draco said, trying not to look at Harry and see his reaction. "It's rude for me to eat this without also offering some to my friend. Harry," he started, finally turning and finding Harry staring like Draco was a purple Hippogriff, "would you like to share this?"
"It's a gay bar," Draco leaned close and said into Harry's ear, his warm breath making the hair on Harry's neck rise. "Well, not entirely, but mostly. They host drag nights and are notably gay-friendly. We're here to find somebody for you to flirt with, remember?"
Draco let out a choke of a laugh through the tears in his throat. "Yeah, he was always good at that."
They were all little pieces of the puzzle that made up the man he'd come to care for. The man he loved. And while there were still a few puzzle pieces missing, that was part of the fun — trying to figure it all out and see the whole picture.
The thing is, when you plan something out so entirely in your mind and you think about it for days, it never goes how you thought it would. This was no exception.
Harry shrugged. "Don't know. Never thought about it." And he hadn't. He'd heard different songs as a kid, but he couldn't identify any of them as something he liked or didn't like. Except maybe Celestina Warbeck. Ugh.
The crowds flowed around them on the train platform, leaving a buffer of space between everyone else and her family. It was something that she realised now always seemed to happen, but she'd never really thought about it until now.
"Really?" Lyra asked, her eyes wide and her little body practically vibrating where she sat on the armchair. She looked back and forth between Harry and Draco like she was afraid they were pranking her. It was several days after their initial decision, and as they'd learned that the legalities of the adoption were large but not anything that would ultimately hinder them, they decided they were ready to talk to the kids.
He was about to begin changing to his pyjamas when a tapping on the window drew his attention. A moment of panic fluttered in Draco's stomach, only passing when he noticed it was only Otus, Andromeda's screech owl. If Harry was there, perhaps he'd just got caught up with Teddy and had dinner there. With Teddy in Auror training and Harry in charge of the training program, it wasn't completely unexpected for Harry to spend extra evenings with his godson.
I stared, stunned, listening to the sizzling of the onions and wondering what the hell had just happened. I replayed Draco's words, growing more irritated by the minute.
Draco froze. That was new and… unexpected. "Like, as friends getting drinks after work?" He needed to clarify, to put those little pixies dancing in his stomach to rest.
Draco stood, listening as Harry's gentle baritone repeated the song through another time. A tear slipped down Draco's cheek and his heart swelled for this man who held their family together. The man who only wanted to hold his family close, who opened his heart to a boy alone in the night, who wanted the best for them all, including Draco.
Harry stared. "Wow," he finally said, and then he considered everything and sighed. "So now what are you going to do?"
And whether he dreamt of a little boy in a cupboard or a man holding him in the night, he couldn't remember. He only knew he dreamt of Harry.
"It's going to be horrible," he said, louder now, winding himself up again. "All those people are going to be horrible."
Harry smiled. The man sounded posh, which he supposed made sense. Arranging flowers all day did seem the type of thing that would take a special type of person. It wasn't like Neville, working in the greenhouses. It was more…artsy…Harry decided.
But he wasn't talking. He wasn't really doing anything, actually. When Draco had come home the previous evening, Harry hadn't showered and there'd been no sign that he'd eaten the entire day. He was sitting on the outdoor sofa and staring out at the river. Draco had been unable to coax him to eat much but had finally managed to get him to clean up and go to bed.
The sobs grew louder and Draco just held on, helpless to do anything else, his own face wet with the grief for the child, praying to whatever powers might be listening that his own daughter wouldn't have to go through this same pain.
Her eyes were burning now, and she started biting her nails, which was a terrible habit and she hated it, but she didn't care right now.
I didn't understand at the time why the idea made me so antsy, but I realise now it was fear. I was afraid to hope for something so entirely different than what I'd always known and expected from life. It sounded too good to be true, like a dream I hadn't even recalled I'd had, but it formed vividly in my mind when put into words. So I lashed out, knowing that Draco wouldn't walk away from me.
She took his hand. "Not exactly. Draco, he's asking for you. Alex wanted to see Harry, but he also asked for Harry's Draco. I think…" Her brown eyes met his. "…I think he sees you as an extension of Harry, as someone who will protect him. I think he might trust you enough, and he wants to help Harry get better."
"I am!" Susan cheered. "Come on, Theo. You're going to help me. You don't have to sing, just be up there with me and help me dance."
The hand moving to his head made it worse. Harry was comforting him, combing his gentle fingers through Draco's hair in the way that usually made him purr. Now, though, it just reminded him how much he didn't deserve this man.
"They have him under a Stasis Charm so it can't do any more damage while they figure out what the curse is and how to counter it." She waited until Draco looked up into her face. "We'll figure it out, Draco. We're tracking down leads, and we're going through the brother's house to see if we can find any reference to spells that could do something like this."
It'd begun with his alarm going off twenty minutes late and the shower running cold after only five minutes. It was then enhanced by Teddy throwing a tantrum while Harry was getting him ready for playschool. His godson simply
"And what's for lunch today?" Draco asked, and he felt his lips twitch. He would not smile. He would
"Hermione." He could hear the plea in his voice. He was too tired and emotionally exhausted to care. It was just past midnight and there was still no word from Harry.
"And sometimes it's going to feel like we're paying more attention to him because he's smaller and needs extra help," Harry added, "but we love you both so much and there will be times we pay extra attention to you too."
Draco sighed and stepped away, and Harry was thankful for the space. He slid to the floor, back to the kitchen cupboard, his eyes still closed.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "This is my shop. Are you looking for flowers?" And then his eyes widened, and Harry could see the fear in them. "Or is this about something for your work?"
Rose brushed past her, running off to see Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron. Dad and Pa were next to them, ruffling Rose's curly, red hair while Alex and Hugo chattered away about something only little brothers would likely appreciate.
Draco was standing by the door, his back stiff, which was not like him. Shit. I'd really messed things up, and I needed to clear the air. I hated to see him so uncomfortable.
St Mungo's was busy, though not inordinately so. Healers and staff hurried about periodically, but there was a general calm to the Spell Damage Ward. Draco approached the private rooms near the end where he could see several Aurors milling about. Ron made his way to them as Draco veered towards Andromeda.
Draco removed Harry's undershirt and pants, and urged Harry into the shower. The water was perfect, streaming over him and washing away the ache that was lingering around the edges of his body. Draco joined him moments later, letting the water darken his blond hair and fall down his back. Then Draco turned and wrapped himself around Harry.
"Excuse me," Harry said, pulling away and backing from the room, unable to stomach any more of her hateful words.
"No," Teddy growled, leveraging his body up and off the other side of the bed, then losing his balance and nearly falling before he caught himself on the mattress. He pushed himself back up and stood, his eyes fierce. "Where's Harry?"
"Your daughter just learned all about your roles in the war, including the information from the biography that arsehole, Breddings, did a couple of years ago. And you don't think that is the cause of your daughter's suddenly strange behaviour towards you?"
And then Lyra woke him early, screaming that Alex was gone and Papa needed to come quick and find him. As if Alex wasn't passed out in the bed next to Draco, his thumb hanging from his mouth.
Draco's head turned back from the window, and his narrowed eyes landed on Harry. "What do you mean, you didn't know you were going?"
Harry closed his eyes, thinking about the reactions of the public, of the people who expected him to marry Ginny or Susan and start a family. Then he thought of the feel of Draco's hard body hovering over him. It was no contest. "Definitely."
I watched the train pull out of the station and stood staring as the parents and younger siblings slowly turned and left the platform. He was gone, and I was alone. Again.
Ginny leant forwards and threw her arms around Luna's slim shoulders, then caught her mouth in a long, drawn-out kiss.
"No," Harry interrupted, realising what had happened. "No, she's not my girlfriend. She's my Auror partner. Susan Bones. Hufflepuff, our year in school?"
Helen chuckled, and Draco tried to keep from blushing. The room sat in silence for several more minutes, Lyra surprisingly quiet, as though she fully understood the magnitude of the situation. Which, Draco realised, she might.
He nodded again, so Draco raised his wand slowly and spelled the lights brighter. The child never took his eyes from Draco's wand, his body stiff.
Draco shook his head and swung his feet off the side of the bed. "I have to go. I have to be there. If he doesn't make it, and I wasn't there—"
He shrugged. "The basics. She knows we fought in it, and that I had a role in the final battle and it's why people know my name."
Pulling back, Draco looked at Harry, and it wasn't pity in his red-rimmed, grey eyes, nor was it rejection or disgust as Harry had feared. It was understanding.
But the morning was over now, and he'd had a quiet lunch in a Muggle park, sitting next to a quiet pond watching the birds. His head was clear, his afternoon open so he could finish his paperwork on his last case, and he felt the stress of the day melting away.
"Hardly," Draco agreed, a slight smile turning the corners of his mouth, but then his face sobered. "Still, the sentiment stands. What is it you want me to do? What can I do to make you stop watching me like I'm up to something? Like something about me disturbs you?"
There was something about this door. It was only a cupboard. Petunia had probably packed up Harry's things and kept them here for storage or something. Nothing more.
He took her hand and pulled her down next to him, leaning over and giving in to that kiss, laying one on her cheek. "You're a goddess."
little brother, so that will make him special. And I'll be able to teach him all about how to be a Malfoy-Potter."
"He hated that house," Luna said quietly. "He never spoke of it, not really, but he hated it there."
Harry started to laugh, imagining the look on Lucius Malfoy's face. "Merlin, I wish I could have seen that."
"Mm-hmm. I mean, she kind of spills everything anyway, so it was intermingled with commentary about Hippogriffs, excitement over next year's electives, and random questions about the war, but yes, she told me she thought the girl was cute and wondered what age I thought she should consider dating."
But as he'd learned countless times before, Harry hated talking about his feelings, no matter what Ginny and Luna seemed to think.
, the sign read, and the sweet smell of flowers Harry couldn't identify flooded his senses. This would be perfect.
I really wasn't sure what I was getting into when I signed up for the Pod-Together fest. I just knew I'd be writing a story and getting a podfic out of it. What I actually got what so much better. I received a partner who helped brainstorm and vet the ideas of the story, who was a cheerleader every step of the way, and whose input, edits, and encouragement made this story something I am truly proud of.
Malfoy relaxed slightly and gestured to the room. "Well, it's as you see. Flowers are flowers, and the clientele in this neighbourhood is much more diverse and accepting than my other… options."
There were tears audible in Hermione's voice when she spoke. "Love you. Sorry." She was quiet for a moment while Draco felt his world fall apart around him. "That's it. But Draco, that doesn't mean he's not okay."
"The teacher said he just walked up to Voldemort and let him hit him with the Killing Curse." She let out a sob. "How could he
"Thank you," Harry said through a yawn, draping himself across his chair like a bearskin rug in an old cartoon.
"So I've decided you need to have a night out," Draco said, flopping down on the common room couch next to Harry. "We need to come up with some way for you to get out and flaunt yourself to the
I rolled my eyes and handed my friend his preferred glass of wine before I sat down with my beer, ready to watch the football match on the telly.
Looking at the clock, he turned, ignoring his mess, and took down two wine glasses, pouring himself and Harry each a drink. Then he took his wine and a book to the bedroom veranda and settled in to wait.
Draco sighed. "Please tell me what you're thinking. I don't care if you think it's stupid or that I won't understand," he said, and he didn't even cringe at the note of begging in his voice. He was just so worried. "Michelle always says that you have to get your feelings out before they can begin making sense."
Draco gave him a small smile, amused. "Well, you've had all the women doting on you already, it sounds like."
After their delightful lunch in the park, during which time Harry called him Draco four times—four!—Draco began to make plans to return the favour. He didn't cook, but perhaps he could take Po— er, Harry, out to lunch at that new pub on the corner.
The thing was, Harry was coming to admire Draco. With each passing month of their eighth year, Draco appeared freer, happier than Harry had ever seen him before. It was like some previously-unspoken-of mask had fallen. He laughed louder, he spoke livelier, and he drew in those around him. He ignored the taunts of those intent on holding his past against him and, instead, worked to prove them wrong, to show them that he'd changed, that he was no longer the little shit they'd all once known.
Harry leaned into Draco's shoulders as they left the church and gave a little snort. "Should be fun."
Draco snorted, irritated. "He's just being stubborn and trying to push his way of things, and in this case, he's overstepping."
Harry nodded and turned, trying not to show his dissatisfaction at the answer. His burgeoning friendship with Malfoy, with
"Stop," Draco said, and he hoped the plea in his voice didn't sound as much like a beg as it seemed.
“Draco!” Nott was becoming angrier by the second, his face was red and his wand was starting to rise, despite Parkinson’s hold of his arm.
"Me neither," confessed Harry. If Hermione had been angry, then Ron would probably be too. And then there was Sirius. He sighed and tried to compose himself. "But we can figure it out together," he said, gently squeezing his boyfriend's arms. "I mean, you said it yourself once. That the people that matter have your back? I have yours."
Draco scoffed, “Merlin, you are hopeless.” He studied the board carefully. “Pick the tower. No, not that one- Oh, just let me.” He moved the piece and grinned. “Your turn, Weasley.”
“Yikes,” said Fred sympathetically, before grinning at them “But I see now why Harry’s looking all silly."
He was fiddling with the small pin, enjoying the peace of the room, when he heard the door open, followed by two sets of steps quickly approaching.
“Does it look bad?” asked Harry as he sat on the table. He was afraid he had used too much Sleekeazy's, he only wanted to flatten it a bit.
There was a short laugh behind him, making Harry pocket it and turn around. Dudley’s smile faltered when he met Harry’s frown, the bigger boy coughing into his hand and glancing away. “So it’s true, then,” he said, eyes fixed on the trunk. “You are leaving.”
Ron blinked. “You mean the Aurors? No- I mean, that’s what my dad told me, but I’m sure that if they had found something word would have gotten out. The Prophet is, uh-” His friends scratched that back of his head. “Well, they were all over the trial.”
The back of his head hits the wall and he groans in pain, but there is no time to dwell on it, he can see the other hall to his left, leading to the exit, to safety.
, but I understand.” Draco pursed his lips and dropped his hand. “I’m, however, not very pleased with you about all,” he waved his hand at the cave. “
Harry reluctantly let go of him and stood up, but placed his hands on the bed and leaned in. “I’ll go, but stop reading and go to sleep,” he whispered.
. Malfoy is a proud creature, driven by emotions like anger, impulsive in that way, and Harry can only think of one reason he would ever accept his help.
“And then we go straight to Dumbledore,” says Harry and watches mesmerized as mistrust crosses Malfoy’s face. He has missed that, he realises, the way Malfoy’s features portray his emotions so loudly, so clear for Harry to read. All he had gotten this year had been dull, a husk of what it had been, but now Malfoy was back.
right there. Harry doesn’t know why the sight makes him feel so elated, but he dismisses it and presses on, “I can help you with that.”
Silence stretched for the second it took Harry to lean in, place a hand on the cushion to balance himself and kiss him.
Remus gave him a sharp look. “Be quiet or be gone, Padfoot,” he said in a low voice that almost sounded like a growl. “The idea is to make Harry feel comfortable so he can share his doubts with us, not tease him.”
"Of course I didn't!" snapped Draco in exasperation. "But I knew you had to. I understood. And I spent the entire walk back under the sodding rain figuring out what I would do and now you-" his voice faltered. "Why didn't you tell her?"
Time stopped when his eyes met the grey ones, as if they had been seeking for them all this time and they could finally rest now, sighing
Now the bagel on Harry’s plate looked like the least appetising thing to exist. “Right...” He stood up from the table. “I think I might need another nap. Just a few hours. I don't want to be tired all day.”
are telling me I have a dumb face,” retorted Harry, and his cousin frowned at him before looking away. “But yeah, it was him.”
There was a heavy silence, that lasted until it was broken by a clap. “Right, we are just going to go," said Fred, nudging the first years to start walking again.
“No real use? They already got twenty-six galleons, Hermione,” said Ron, then grinning. “Plus, I think Harry-"
That made him pause.  It was true Draco hadn’t levitated anyone as his father had done, but there was no denying he had been pretty awful. Feeling a sliver of hope, Harry asked them, “But he grew out of it?”
At least that's what he plans to do. He wants to help Malfoy, even if he is an absolute git, because now he can't forget the haunted expression on Malfoy's face the entire year. Harry had thought it was because he was up to something, but now that he knew it was this…
“This is not about sides, Malfoy, but your pride.” Triumph roars in Harry’s chest when Malfoy gapes at him before turning his head to the side, away from his eyes. Harry grips his wrist tighter and presses him further into the wall. “Voldemort did this, don’t you hate him for that?”
“I’m packing,” answered Harry, giving his cousin one last suspicious glance before going back to stuffing his things inside the trunk. He wrapped his broom in some old shirts to keep it safe and placed it on top of the rest of things, along with other fragile valuables like bottles of ink, potions ingredients, the eagle feather quill Hermione had gifted him and his
. I chose this place because no one ever comes here-" She glanced carefully at the bartender, relieved when she found him quite far from them, attending a witch. “Professor Flitwick said we were allowed to come here, so it’s not against the rules either."
yelled a part of Harry's brain, but the rest was very preoccupied with how alluring his boyfriend looked. He wanted to kiss him more, maybe hear him gasp like that again. "Sorry," he whispered instead.
“Surely you are aware of the rumours,” continued Skeeter, not deterred by Draco’s lie. “About your father-”
“Padfoot, the train,” warned Remus, and Sirius stepped to the side to let him give Harry’s shoulder a squeeze. “Take care, Harry, and do try to avoid trouble.”
“That’s enough!” Nott’s outburst managed to drag the attention of the room away from the pair and towards him. Harry had never heard him raise his voice like that, or seen him so furious. “Not another word, Draco.”
Sweet. The incredible sweetness of rich caramel broke through the awful bitterness of the outside, then mixing into a devastatingly good combination.
Harry refrained from saying anything embarrassing. “Not any more than you.” He approached him. “I just felt like taking a walk.”
“I can speak for myself, sir,” cut in Hermione sternly, startling the man. “He hasn’t apologized, not yet. But I’m sure he will, at the proper time."
"That was one time, Potter" muttered Draco, shoving Harry when he laughed. "Whatever. Longbottom's weird obsession may turn out to be useful now. So make sure to ask him."
"What?" Mundungus blinked at the crowd in confusion. "I just thought that after what he did last year to Harry-"
If Umbridge’s job under Fudge wasn’t enough to mark her as bad news, the way she interrupted Dumbledore’s speech definitely was. Harry, Ron and Hermione gaped, and a glance at the Slytherin table showed both Draco and Parkinson exchanging an amused glance, the latter holding a hand to her mouth as if shocked.
Harry, Ron and Hermione watched them leave, Draco bickering with Parkinson while Luna giggled at the insults. It was an odd sight only for them to see, the halls still void of the students that soon would run down the stairs to catch breakfast before it vanished from the tables.
. Although, having seen how excited Sirius was, Harry suspected he might be there as extra supervision as well.
Hermione’s gaze was calculating, looking at Ron as if he were a puzzle. Harry looked between the two of them, managing to catch the moment realisation hit Hermione’s brown eyes. “This isn’t about the Slytherins,” she mused, and her face softened. “Ron, you don’t have to feel envious. I-”
“Don’t think I will.” Sirius grinned and clapped his hands. “Well, you have to tell me all about your cousin over dinner, but first go leave your jacket and stuff in your room. It’s the same one you slept in last year, but if you don’t like it we can choose another. Kreacher already left your trunk there, but don’t unpack now, I’ll help you later.”
Despite all that, when he started hearing noises downstairs, well after the Dursleys had left town for some dumb event, Harry pocketed it quickly.
Draco scrunched his nose. “Don’t speak with your mouth full," he chastised, then switching to a bright smile and looking very pleased with himself. “And of course it’s good,
"We need to kick out the Slytherins," muttered Ernie, arms crossed over his chest. The rest of the group that had congregated on one side of the room and kept glaring at the rest of it shared nods of agreement.
Harry left detention late that evening, watching how the cuts on his hand closed but still left the skin around them raw and red. His head hurt from the sheer anger at Umbridge, who had once again sat in front of him calmly, taking her tea with a side of his suffering. As he walked through the halls, the distant sound of a discussion reached his ears, making him rush ahead when he recognized the voices.
And look he did, because he had avoided it for too long. The Black Family tapestry felt like the centre of a hurricane, dragging his eyes and holding them in. Gone was the dust that once hid its rich dark colours, gone the humidity stains near the top, but it remained unchanged; Draco’s name untouched, linked to his parents by solid lines of gold, something that last year had been a point of concern and now…
"Harry," Ginny finally said, "you don't really have a problem with them being happy, do you? I mean, you've been the one preaching all year that the past is the past and all that rubbish."
Draco turned his head and looked at Harry, his dark hair messy with sweat, his face and chest flushed. His husband. His family. His love. "Yeah, me too."
Draco watched the room cheer, standing to show their appreciation. Merlin, he was proud of his husband.
"More than once, and she meant it." He turned his head and finally looked at Draco, his eyes serious and resigned. "Dudley said she wasn't coming back to the house. Didn't want to leave her beloved dogs that long, so at least we won't have to deal with her."
The blood in Draco's veins froze. Teddy was only in training. There was no way he'd be in the field alone…and Harry wasn't home.
"Don't panic yet. Being Department Head means I can get some answers. Now go to Teddy. I'll be there soon."
"I know, but it's not really what I thought it'd be, you know? And I've been talking to the Healers, and watching, and really considering what I want to do with my life. I want to help people, but I also want a family someday." He paused and took a deep breath, and when he continued, his eyes were solemn. "I don't want to have to go through everything you and Uncle Harry have, not for something I don't particularly want anyway. Being a Healer will have its challenges, I know that. I just… I think it just feels right in a way the whole Auror thing never did, you know?"
Molly watched them and smiled, then stood, brushing out the long skirt of her robes and walking over to the counter to finish preparing whatever she was cooking. "Did Harry take Lyra upstairs then? She definitely needed a time out. She was getting cheeky, telling me how I should go about reprimanding Alex."
"It was the first film Harry ever showed me. We watched it with Teddy." He sighed and felt his face flush at what he was about to admit, but he wanted her opinion. He really did. No one knew family like she did. "Molly, I told him he needed to butt out of some issues I'm having with the Manor, that it was a Malfoy family problem and didn't concern him."
The class leaned forward with sincere interest for the first time that lesson. Satisfied he had their undivided attention, Lockhart took hold of the cover and whipped it off the cage. There was a beat of silence and then Theo snorted.
“I thought you might like to get all the mail Dobby's been hoarding,” he said when he noticed Harry. “And you've some birthday gifts too.”
At four o'clock Hagrid walked into the hall. “Good to see yer all right,” he said, smiling down at them.
Harry stalled, turning the tape on at full volume so that the tinny sound drifted up to them from the headphones. “Yeah, I guess. Snape told me it might just have been, er, emotional stress or something.”
“Here, girl – take your book –” he thrust it into her hands. “It's the best your father can give you.” He twisted out of Hagrid's grip and snarled at Draco. “Buy your books and let's go!”
“Er, Ollie says that he used to see you hide from some Gryffindors in a classroom further down this corridor,” Harry said nervously.
“That can have its uses, too. And I imagine Olamide would be eager to tell you all he knows, if you're the only Parselmouth he has contact with.”
“I'm not proud of it. I joined shortly after leaving school, when I was young, angry and alone. That does not excuse what I did. But I realised my mistake, and offered my services to the headmaster as a spy. I have spent the rest of my life trying to atone for my foolishness.”
Sirius gave him a thin smile. “I understand if you don’t want to,” he said, looking uncertain. “It’s not exactly a good place, and Kreacher is just a vermin, but-"
“How can you be sure? We haven’t done much, Harry,” said Draco seriously, a hard-to-read expression on his eyes. “I’m not like Granger and Weasley, I’m not running headfirst into trouble with you.”
“No, Sirius, they do this time,” said Harry. “Lucius Malfoy recognized you at the platform. He must have been the one to tell the Ministry."
“There,” he said to himself. It was his room now, and he allowed himself a moment to just stare and smile. He was stopped by a chirp that made him look at the corner of the room where Hedwig’s cage stood over a table. “You are liking the new place?” he asked.
Harry couldn’t. “Is it really what you want? Or just what you feel like you should do?” There was no answer, and he pressed on. “I also said that I would be here for you either way, that I’ll have your back, remember?”
Harry did manage to keep his eyes on the practice, despite the overwhelming itch to just glance at Draco and see whatever he was doing.
Harry snorted and broke apart to grin at his godfather. “He says you were quite a talented boy and that he would have wanted you in his House.”
“Yeah, you were humming them all morning.” Harry grinned back but didn’t slow down. He hadn’t seen Draco since last night and was worried about how he would take the news. Or how his friends would take the news. He glanced at the galleon on his hand, still with no engraved message.
“You still remember that?” Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry, who said nothing, and then let out a sigh. “Of course you do. Yes, I thought I should, since that sodding man is important enough for you to drag me to a cave.” Draco tried for a grin that came out more like a grimace. “But then, well...”
King’s Cross looked grim under the cloudy sky of London, just like the faces of the Aurors in black suits waiting for them by the entrance. One of them attempted to haul Harry by the arm to escort him inside, but Sirius scowled at him.
reassuring,” said Draco, and then he brought Harry’s hand to his lips, gently kissing the skin just next to the scars, the gesture rendering Harry speechless. The blond looked up at him with a slight frown. “You must be tired, let’s get you back to your common room."
“Hey, what’s your problem?!” asked Ron harshly, but the girl all but ignored him, blazing eyes fixed on Harry with fury.
“What is going on here?!" came Remus' voice, loud enough to break through the ringing. He and Sirius had appeared next to Harry, the first stopping between him and Mundungus.
It makes Harry smile against his own will, and he extends a hand for the other to take, and despite the intense animosity between them, he doesn’t doubt for a second Malfoy will accept it. And when he does, his pale hand gripping Harry’s tightly, as if it were part of a fight between them, it feels like the world is finally in place.
"You are not a Death Eater," he says to the wolf, which says nothing in return. Harry takes that as an answer and nods, accepting that he had been wrong.
And also, fun fact: I love dragons. That's one of the reasons The Goblet of Fire is my favourite movie.
“You are mistaken, Dursley,” said Dumbledore coolly. “The reason I must discuss this with you is not Harry’s safety, but yours. As you must know, the wizard known as Lord Voldemort has returned to Britain, which places you in peril.”
The bricks finished shifting, revealing a quite changed Diagon Alley. Just the sight of it seemed to dampen Sirius’ mood, as he dropped his grin and led them in quietly. Harry could understand how his godfather felt. It was as if a cloud had fallen upon the street, everything looking distinctly less alive. Many shops were closed, their showcases empty and windows hastily covered with wooden planks.
Draco looked at him, his silver eyes wide in surprise before softening. “I see,” he said, giving Harry a smile as he returned the cloak. “In that case, it must be very special; Demiguise cloaks don’t usually last so long.”
“Let’s get out of here. Or inside somewhere, I guess.” Harry tugged at his hand to start walking towards the village. “Where would you like to go?”
Harry let himself plop down on his bed, his hand coming to rest next to the book he had left there. Harry picked it up, once again admiring the blue cover with the drawn Bard.
But Draco didn’t return it. Instead, his eyes dropped to the floor as he worried his lower lip with his teeth, to the point Harry feared the skin would break.
Harry wasn’t prepared at all. He had been mostly joking, but now that he could see the extension of pale skin bared for him, he couldn’t help but kiss it again, just below the ear. Draco tightened his grip on his shirt and let out a groan, the sound making Harry’s blood rush and, out of an impulse, he stuck his tongue out and tasted his skin.
Hermione raised an eyebrow at him. “Harry, that’s very kind of you, but I don’t think you, well...."
They proceeded to ignore each other, Harry taking out his Charm essay to work on. And Malfoy doing whatever he was doing. The silence continued, feeling tenser by the second like a stretched rope. Harry felt alert and could tell Malfoy did too.
Neville pocketed his invitation. “Right, about that…” He gave Harry a worried look. “I thought you were going to find Malfoy.”
Draco opened his mouth and Kreacher pulled at his ears even harder, as if trying to tear them apart before they could hear what he was about to say next. “It’s an order,” hissed the blond and the elf let out a whimper.
The bagel felt like concrete when Harry passed it down. “Is Lucius really going to stay there for life?” he asked.
“Teachers don’t get access to the list before it is ready. They would have to ask each teacher individually, and I doubt Snape would go through the trouble,” said Lupin. “This year the booklist was quite late as well."
“Yes, of course,” said Draco, standing up. He glanced at Harry, who noticed he seemed a bit tense, and then followed Nott. Both of them disappeared behind a shelf and probably kept walking because Harry didn’t hear any conversation start near them.
“Mind sharing with the class?” They turned around, finding Ron giving them an almost offended look from where he was seated. Hermione looked at Harry, asking for permission, and passed on the short letter when Harry just shrugged. There wasn’t much to see after all.
There was no time at all, and Harry wanted to yell at Draco for making him waste it, but he couldn’t, not when the blond was looking at him like that. “It has to be quick,” he said, already turning around towards the fire.
Sirius shrugged. “I’ll leave it to Molly or Moony then." He gave Harry another grin. “I could ask them right now."
Their voices grew distant as Harry passed by the tables, following after Draco. He caught up with him just outside the Hall, at the same spot where they had met during Yule. The blond was wearing his blue scarf and seemed nervous.
He opened his eyes. It was still dark, and he was walking down the long corridor of the Department of Mysteries again. The door opened to another corridor and at the end of it was a room with many shelves, filled to the top with white spheres that looked like Trelawney’s crystal balls.
Harry tensed, feeling alert. He and Malfoy might have established an odd truce at the moment, but Harry wouldn’t accept any ill comments about his friends. And he knew Malfoy was full of those.
Harry chuckled. "I know, it's just that I like doing things for him, or making him laugh-" Was he being sappy now? He didn't care, it was true. "I like seeing him happy, Hermione. He has
“They left after Weasley stopped dropping the Quaffle, said it was too boring,” drawled Draco. “Personally, I found the nose bleeding interesting. Is that a new tactic you are trying? Bleeding on your opponents?"
The blond scrunched his nose. “Merlin, this woman has an altar to Fudge here,” he turned it around to show the photo of the Minister, looking at them proudly under his green bowl hat. “You should have heard her talk about the man, Pansy is completely sure she is in love with him or something.”
Harry shifted from one foot to another. “About Kreacher...was that what you wanted to tell me after the holidays?”
It was probably terrible of him, but that made Harry howl with laughter even louder. And if Draco hadn't been keeping his eyes straight ahead, Harry was sure he would have received an amazing glare.
“Godric, Harry, why do you sound as if it were the end of the world? I understand that you are whipped and want to see him, but...” His eyebrows furrowed and he placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Is there something wrong?”
“Oh, that’s a shame...” Fleur sighed. “But he must come to the wedding, oui?” Harry meant to answer, but she waved a finger at him. “I won’t take no for an answer! I simply
The idea to check the map had come from a place of desperation, but it had been brilliant. Because Draco Malfoy was on his way to the owlery,
George shook his head. “There are no rules that prohibit making or testing products. I know my rights."
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know, help her when the occasion arises. At least that’s what worked in my case. He ran out of ink and I gave some to him, god-knows-why since I didn’t like him at the time.”
Harry looked at Draco, standing by the door looking surprised at the scene. Their eyes crossed, and Harry wondered if he had enough courage. As the blond gave him a small smile, Harry hoped he did.
Another possibility had begun forming in Harry’s head the past days, as the many days went on and nothing changed. It had grown louder last night, keeping him awake when he felt his eyelids turn heavier.
“It was your first match, Ronnie, you will do better next time,” said Fred, and Harry and George nodded.
“I found out something about some people that I know,” he said, simplifying it down to no acts or no names. “Or well, knew in some way,” he corrected, because he didn’t really know his father, as Snape’s memory had proved.
behind,” said Harry, because he wasn't. He had a pile of work, sure, but it had gone back to normal size after he started working with Draco. He opened his mouth to say just that when something else caught his eye. "Ah, Hermione, look!"
“That hurt,” he said and Draco pressed a kiss to the spot, his soft lips calming the pain his teeth had left and trailing up. Harry let his hand fall to the blond’s waist, finding bare skin from where Draco’s black shirt had ridden up.
And it was the last straw for Harry, as he remembered that boy was not his anymore, that it was all over. He looked at his friends, witnessing how their upset faces turned into surprised horror as tears started blurring his vision.
One chapter to go! I'm already working on the next part, but I'll most likely start posting it next year. I'm quite excited about this one (!!!)
“Believe me, I have no desire for overstaying my welcome, but there are a few matters to discuss.” The Headmaster didn’t take a seat, but merely crossed his hands in front of him and looked at the Dursleys seriously. “Once Harry leaves tonight, he will not return nor call this house his home anymore. This will cease the protection I placed upon it fifteen years ago, that in other circumstances would have remained until Harry came of age.”
Malfoy is breathing heavily, his chest rising and falling in a movement Harry can feel because they are that close. “Why?” he asks, his eyes narrowing in suspicion. “Why are
He stood still until she returned to her reading, and then made sure he was out of sight before rushing down the halls of shelves. He hadn’t checked the map again since the gate and there was a chance Draco could have left in the time it had taken Harry to get there. The library was as empty as the rest of the castle since the work of the younger students wasn’t harsh enough for them to slave over the weekends and the older ones had thrown the towel on their piles of work for the day.
The rest of the ride was easier; Harry spent it with his head on Draco’s lap, the blond running fingers through his hair while keeping a conversation with Hermione. It was about the NEWTs, so Harry was all too happy to ignore it, just as he was to ignore the bewildered looks his friends kept throwing at him.
Harry smiled, eyes fixed on the letter as he lightly swayed back on the swing. The heat of the day was finally retreating, but it also meant the light would be gone soon as well. He wanted to finish reading Draco’s letter before he had to return.
Harry turned to his friends, and the three of them sat down around Umbridge’s horrid office to stare at the fireplace. As Draco said, it ended up being a long wait, and the clock was near to midnight and Ron had already finished eating through a basket of sweets he found when the fire flickered to life once again.
Snape looked down at the class. "Antidote to Weedosoros. Page 278. You might have to try it, so I suggest you do
To Harry’s puzzlement, Dudley’s face cleared up. “Really?” he asked, sounding vaguely hopeful, then going back to rubbing his neck. “This person, uh, she doesn’t like me very much, says I’m a brute. And at first I thought she was just a nosey bitch, but, now, you know...” Dudley halted his own words and frowned at Harry. “So what did you do?”
“As painful as it may be, do not mention my name in your meeting,” said Draco slowly. He raised an eyebrow when Harry looked dismayed. “Not what you were expecting?"
Dumbledore’s eyes crinkled before he turned towards Slughorn. “It’s regrettable you don’t want the job, Horace, but do know you are always welcome at Hogwarts, if you choose to visit, no matter the security measures we might place. So long”
“I’ll say whatever I want!” yells Malfoy, trying to no avail to free himself and then closing his other hand in a fist that Harry stops from meeting his face just in time by holding onto the wrist. “Get your dirty hands off me, Potter! Haven’t you done enough? My life is over,” Malfoy’s voice takes a desperate edge and his eyes remind Harry of the sea during a storm, “My parents can’t even look at me, I’m not their son anymore but a filthy creature-” Harry is startled when Malfoy lets out a wry laugh. “Is that it, then, Potter? You like me now that I have become filthy, like that mudblood you like so much?”
Harry turned to McGonagall. Parvati was standing next to her, schedule hiding her lower face while her dark eyes looked at Harry with open curiosity and a hint of pity that made him frown. Parvati blinked and moved away when he approached.
Right? But the wolf only blinks at him slowly, looking exhausted, and Harry thinks again of the dark circles under Malfoy's eyes. "You don't want to be alone?"
“It’s just a possibility we have to consider, Harry,” replied Hermione seriously. “I mean, doesn’t it bother you that he didn’t sign?"
“If you have already received your schedules, I imagine there must be much more productive things to do with your time than gossip," she said, making a group of younger students mumble apologies and scramble.
He noticed his slip up and looked up at his friends cautiously. Ron seemed a bit surprised, but he smiled and leaned over to ruffle Harry’s hair. “Of course, mate.”
What was Harry supposed to do in this situation? The man before him not only was a supporter of Voldemort, which made him Harry’s enemy, he was also, and this is where things got weird, the father of his
The trio could tell something was wrong from the moment they saw a group of Slytherins hanging at the back of the class. That by itself wasn’t unusual, but the amount of whispering coming from the group was never a good sign.
“We have an hour left.” Draco stood up, primly brushed off the grass from his trousers and offered a hand to Harry. “If you don’t stare at me too much, it’ll be enough."
Harry exchanged a look with Hermione, who seemed confused by the question too. “Well, Ron, I live here,” he said.
Fenrir Greyback had a thick neck, a scarred face and teeth as sharp as a knife, and if those things weren't enough to be a warning, then the expression on Remus' face definitely was.
though Harry, looking at the ceiling as he felt his face heat up again. He had seen people exchanging sweets all day with distant amusement, nodding to Ron’s complaints about it, but now that he was doing so himself it felt ridiculously good, like the truffle itself.
Harry stored the egg on his bag and went to follow him. He sent Myrtle a deep scowl, but the girl only giggled at him.
said the gesture, and just like most of the things Draco silently offered, Harry felt compelled to accept.
Next to him, Draco let out a sigh, then stepping back to stare at the empty spot the Patronus had left as if looking for any remains of its presence. Which reminded Harry of something.
," said Harry, gesturing frantically. He leaned forwards on his chair and narrowed his eyes at the girl. "What do you know about him?"
Harry watched his friends leave the castle along with the rest of students and sighed. Hermione had made him promise to start with the egg immediately after they left, so he had a tiring day ahead.
He looked up at the sounds of chairs moving. Class was clearing out, the other students walking out of the room with sullen expressions, many throwing Harry jealous glares. One of them was Nott, the expression on his face absolutely murderous. That made Harry feel even better, but then, he looked at Draco and his bubble burst in a single pop.
Harry hummed, then clapping to attract the attention of the group once again. "Alright, while we sort this out I want everyone to pair up. We are going to start with the basics, the Disarming Charm, so-"
For a moment there was stunned silence as the flames consumed the paper and Harry looked at Draco, waiting for his reaction.
.” Ron was peering over his shoulder. “So your book has weird scribbles? Mine only has tears, and some puke I think.”
The only complaint Harry had was Snape himself, who kept looking at them as if offended whenever he passed by their table. However, the man had said nothing to Draco besides useful pieces of advice about whatever potion they might be preparing. Which was something he definitely didn’t do with Gryffindors.
“But you did it!” laughed Harry, pulling him into a side hug and kissing his cheek, pride swelling on his chest. “A corporeal Patronus, Draco!"
Hermione's face was starting to turn red now, as she moved her hands as if gesturing at Harry to stop. "No, it's not like that-" she spluttered, her voice slightly rising. "I don't know where you would get that idea. I certainly don't-"
Harry sighed. “I mean, it doesn’t matter what I write, Trelawney will just say it means I’m going to die a horrible death anyway."
Harry checked around again and leaned in. "Champions have to open the Ball, you know. If I showed up alone McGonagall would have killed me before the Second Task even got the chance."
“The Draught of Peace is quite tricky,” explained Zabini. “And since our resident class pet insists on coming here, we must follow."
“You should stop being a bully, Big D, she sounds like she doesn’t like that.” From Dudley’s expression, Harry could tell he had already thought about doing that, so he added, “And you should do something nice for her.”
Hermione nodded. “I’m honestly appalled by that. Many of the people you said were mentioned last night are just plain awful.”
"His mother," said Sirius, pointing at the name over Draco's, "Narcissa is my first cousin. Along with her sister Bellatrix."
Harry reached to grab it and, after some hesitation, Sirius gave it to him. “I fucking hate this newspaper,” muttered Harry, eyes cast down on the photograph. Despite how much it hurt, he couldn’t look away. He understood Draco now, just why he had been unable to stop reading the article announcing his father’s trial back on the train.
Hermione raised an eyebrow as Harry walked her further in, the table where he usually sat with Draco near the back of the library. “Less noisy,” explained Harry, wishing he could tell her it was because they didn’t want Umbridge to notice them if she walked in. He rolled his eyes when Hermione hummed in disbelief.
?" he repeated, but instead of the relief Harry had been expecting, Draco's expression was livid as he rounded the table. "Why?!"
PS: Right, so which was the best date? This one or the first one? Personally, I would prefer the ice cream parlour over either haha.
Harry shook his head, “I need a date. Quickly,” declared Harry. He looked around, noticing Parvati and Padma walking down the stairs, and immediately calling after them.
Moody frowned at him but showed no signs of stopping and Harry started to feel a bit desperate. Next to him, he could see Nott and other Slytherins trying to step forwards, but Moody reeled them back with a dark glare.
“Not killing her. Sorry to disappoint.” Draco came to a stop again and glanced around the empty corridor before looking at Harry rather seriously. “You owe me a favour," he said, or more so declared.
“Well, I… I don’t know. I wasn’t expecting it, and it’s a first for me too, but it feels all… wrong, you know? I mean, he told me to leave it there. We have been together for one…” Harry paused. “One year and two months, how can we just
Draco pointed at the clock near the entrance of the library as they passed by it. “You are already breaking curfew, Harry," he said with a grin. "There’s no way one can get from here to the dorms in five minutes. It's just a matter of leaving before getting kicked out by Pince."
It was a small bathroom; big if one considered that it was made for a train and probably had some expansion charm on it, but definitely made for just one person, so a few drops of water fell on Harry’s face when Draco splashed his own. “Hey,” he complained, reaching to wipe them off with his sleeve.
As he left the classroom behind, his hand went to his pocket. The fake galleon hadn’t shuddered,  the sign Draco would send him once it was time to leave, which was odd because Harry felt that he had taken longer than planned. He hurried down the halls towards the Great Hall, hoping Umbridge hadn't noticed his absence at dinner yet. He was just a few hallways away when odd noises reached his ears; short-lived and muffled, like gunshots at the distance.
“I know, but he did,” said Harry. Draco looked at him with annoyment, let out a huff and pulled him into the bathroom. The door closed behind Harry’s back, pressed against it as Draco scowled at him a bit more before turning around to use the sink.
“Well, I didn’t know he wasn’t writing, did I?” retorted Sirius, and Harry closed his mouth. “And if I came to you and told you; hey, Harry, we have asked Snivellus to spy on your boyfriend so don’t worry-”
“You’ll have to kill me first,” whispered Sirius. And a cruel laugh left Harry’s lips, the sound followed by a curse and Sirius’ screams of pain. Someone else was screaming too and the heat of the day had returned, especially in his scar, that burned, and only then Harry realised it was him.
The only positive aspect of winter for Harry, one he wouldn’t say aloud in fear of sounding terribly cheesy, was the lovely pink tinge on Draco’s face caused by the coldness. Even when he kept the lower half of his face covered by a scarf, Harry could still see it on his pale nose.
Harry could only stare up at him, trying to take in every detail and engrave it on his memory. Draco was unusually quiet, his eyes completely focused on his movements. His pale cheeks were dusted pink and Harry felt his heart sore with hope because the bathroom wasn’t cold, nor too hot.
“I’m sure they just wanted to scare you,” said Harry reassuringly, although he wasn’t sure because the twins could be quite vindictive. They had shoved Monteague, another member of the Inquisitorial Squad, inside a weird cabinet when he had tried to remove points from them. “I might be at fault for that.”
Silver light poured from the end of his wand, stronger than before and startling both of them when instead of growing in a wide circle, it moved away, making a slow circle around the room as it took form.
Snape’s office resembled the Potions classroom a lot, also filled with many fragile-looking bottles just waiting to fall on the floor and break. Snape told him to shut the door, and then started explaining what Occlumency was.
The match was long over and the sun had already set by the time Harry and Hermione made their way to the Tower.
“I think he would have sent you a howler in that case,” huffed Ron, sitting next to Harry as he opened the letter.
Harry felt an odd combination of embarrassment and happiness at that. Because god-knows-what Sirius had been saying, but it was also a reminder of what Draco had done. For him.
Ron shuddered. "Because Harry is always there and I can't stand them- I mean, I like them apart, but together, ugh." He stuck out his tongue and made a face. "Sickening. With you I don't have to worry about that."
“Quite the opposite.” Draco placed his hands on Harry's shoulders, his smile turning into a mischievous grin. “Think about it, I can assure she knows nothing about what you and your little band are up to."
By the end of the inspection, Hermione had tears of fury in her eyes, glaring at Umbridge as she left and looking an inch away from hexing her. Harry felt the same way, after having to stand the awful woman treating Hagrid as if he were below her, speaking slowly and in a patronizing way. Hagrid’s loss at the treatment had only made it worse, the man looking severely less enthusiastic as he continued the class.
“Of course,” muttered Skeeter, reaching into her purse to take out her acid green quill. “Then, let’s begin, Harry. Give me the facts, give me the events, give me the names.”
Harry didn't answer, too busy looking at the trio walking away, and not noticing the pair of curious brown eyes studying his face.
"Good, good. That is," said Harry, trying not to show his relief. "Well, let's work on this potion before Snape bites my head off again."
That was completely wrong “He did nothing!” snapped Harry, feeling a bit guilty when Ginny looked betrayed. The girl didn’t know anything, so it was understandable that she was confused, but Harry didn't have time to explain. “Ron, Hermione, can you-?”
He looked up, searching for anyone to tell. Dumbledore was making his way to him, face set on a harsh line. Behind him, he could see the crowd slowly realising something was wrong, the music hesitantly pausing, concerned looks starting to be exchanged. From the front, Fleur and Cedric exchanged a glance, and rose to their feet, Viktor remained seated behind them, giving Harry a blank look.
Because it was Malfoy Manor? It was the Malfoy estate? He had a duty to the estate that was his, not Harry's, to pass on to his descendants.
But Draco didn't understand; he thought Harry was just being a stubborn, Muggle-raised wizard who didn't understand elves. And maybe he didn't understand them, not really, but it made his stomach ill to give the little elf orders. Even when she begged for them.
And then I saw him in Gathii's arms, and everything I'd planned to tell Draco seemed insignificant, but I wasn't sure how.
"He's getting married. Her name is Makena. He's having a ceremony here in England and then another in Kenya with her family near where they'll be living."
"Yeah, I get that." Dudley sniffled and his voice sounded thick. "I don't know what to do next. I mean, I know I have to take care of everything, but it's just me. My girlfriend is helping with the logistics of the funeral and stuff, but I just wish that I had someone else here who
Hermione smiled and gave Draco a knowing look, then proceeded to the lifts. Lyra proceeded to chat to Alex the entire way. "When Aunt Hermione had a baby last year, I got to come here and see him. His name is Hugo."
Draco pulled Harry close, their wet, naked bodies fitting together in that way that always amazed Harry, like two puzzle pieces snapped into place. He usually found it arousing, but now it was just comforting.
die and saved the fucking world?" She whirled on Teddy. "How about any of that? Because they didn't tell me any of that, and I got to sit through lectures on it with the entire room staring at me, knowing that was my dad."
, and while they'd all become close since Draco's return from France — thanks to Neville and Pansy shacking up — he wasn't sure he'd ever get used to the Weasley…crassness.
Merlin, now what? Draco wracked his brain, trying to figure out what he could say that would help the child relax. "Can I get you something to eat? Are you hungry?"
"Fine," she cried, smacking it down on the table. "Just, fine!" She turned and stormed out of the room, thumping loudly up the stairs and slamming her door.
"I told them to fuck off. I mean, I didn't use those words with my Mum, but I did with Lucius. He's a right fucking bastard, and I told him to shove his pureblood nonsense up his arse, that I didn't care what he thought and would live my own life."
"You're welcome. In return, tomorrow you're going to tutor me on that advanced Shield Charm since I didn't get to work on it today."
"All those things you mentioned? They weren't going to be possible in a world with Voldemort. He was hell-bent on destroying so much, and I was the one person who could fix it. It was because I wanted Teddy to be able to grow up in peace, to give my schoolmates like Draco and Luna a chance at a better life, the chance to have a family and people they loved. If I couldn't have it, at least other people could."
She softened her gaze and smiled gently before turning to Lyra, holding her hand out for the girl. "Lyra, honey, your parents want to have a few minutes of grown-up talk. Let's go see Grandma Molly, okay?"
"Yeah." He dropped his hand and sighed. "And then he went off and nearly got himself killed. We talked a little when he woke up, but this is still hanging out there."
"But, I don't look like anyone else on the wall-rug," Alex said, thinking about his sister and how much she looked like the other Malfoys and like Daddy. He didn't look like any of them because he was different.
Hermione narrowed her eyes, and Draco looked into their brown depths, urging her to trust him and give him a few minutes.
would. He was so small, but he was fast and he made me so mad, always saying whatever it was that would rev me up fastest."
Because, and here was the real kicker, he was devastated. He really was. The loss of Petunia, particularly, hurt in a way he'd never expected. He was so,
Hermione closed her eyes for a moment, and when she opened them, she looked sad. "What have you told Lyra about the war?"
He got down really close and could see several familiar faces. Below Grandmother were Papa and Daddy, a beautiful golden branch tying them together. And below them was a young girl, her hair the colour of Papa's and their aunt Luna's — Lyra had grown in Aunt Luna's tummy, after all — and her eyes the colour of Daddy's, a grass-like green. But next to her…
Luna pulled away from Ginny and clapped her hands like a five-year-old offered ice cream. "Yes, please! I love champagne!"
"Try that. The band is called Live, and track seven is my favourite. It's called 'All Over Me.' Trust me; it's classic."
"No! I mean yes, you didn't tell me, and no, I didn't know about your shit childhood, of that fucking cupboard, but that's not what I'm trying to say."
"She is," Draco agreed. "I've never seen her like this, really. She barely lets him out of her sight, and he seems to relax with her. I just…" he trailed off, looking down at Alex's brown curls. "I can't see him going off with strangers. He's been through so much, and right now, we're the only familiar people he has in the entire world. It's going to be hard enough when they find his Muggle family, but these other people are wholly unrelated to him."
Harry was stunned for a moment, and looked at the tapestry again. Its extension on the wall, along with the many connections, made it feel like a spider-web, capturing and unforgiving. He stared at Draco’s name, on the very edge of it, and the tree turned into the maws of a beast, ready to close around it at any moment. And Harry felt like he wanted to take it out of there, but the golden lines were strong and solid. Family wasn’t a choice, but-
Harry frowned. It did make sense, but Voldemort had still used his closeness to Sirius. And even if that weren't the case, Harry was tired of not being told things. "I understand," he said despite all that, because he did appreciate the man.
Harry looked back at her, raising an eyebrow in confusion. "Like eventually, right?" he said, not sure why she seemed so worked up by the idea.
He stumbled out of the door in a rush and stepped around a group of people, his frantic search only stopping when he saw him, the name was out of his lips before he could even realise he was opening them.
Malfoy grabbed his hand, dragging him behind a large bush and pulling them both down until it hid them.
Love. What Dumbledore was convinced had saved him when he was a baby, but it couldn’t be the same one. The love the girls had been referring to had to be more like the one Ron’s parents felt for each other.
Panic makes Harry raise his hands to push it away, but then confusion takes over because there is no pain, no sharp teeth sinking on his throat and ripping it apart, there's only more sniffs and then a sudden whimper as the wolf backs away.
Harry had totally forgotten about that. He had told Ron he would be back quick, and it had been at least an hour since. “He is going to kill me.”
“Oh, yes, very tasteful." Ron's words were followed by a startlingly loud feminine giggle. For a stupid second, Harry thought it had been Hermione, but she was sitting next to him and didn’t look amused in the slightest.
Harry and Draco remained under the Cloak until they got into Hermione's room. It was smaller than their own, with only three beds in it. Like the common room it was round and red.
They entered the Great Hall to find most of the school there already. The house tables had been removed, leaving a long stage that ran the length of the hall. Greg and Vince cleared a path through the crowd so that they were standing next to one side of the stage. Harry waved at Hermione and Neville on the other side, and was relieved when they both waved back.
“Of course, Mr Nott! How else will you learn how to fight them? Now then, let's see what you can do with them!” With that he unlocked the cage and stepped back quickly.
Harry sighed. “When we had detention with Lockhart, I heard it just before he dismissed us. But no one else heard it, so Draco and Millicent assumed it must have been me imagining things.”
“Yes, sir,” Draco replied. “When Harry was taken down into the Chamber, I sort of, well, I didn't handle it very well. Eventually I found a Prefect and had her Floo call Professor Snape, demanding he take me to visit Hermione in the infirmary. I wanted to see the best friend I still had left,” Draco paused and cleared his throat. “Anyway, I went to hold her hand, and noticed she had a scrap of paper in her hand. It was a page that had been torn out of a library book. It was about basilisks, and she'd written 'pipes' in the margin. That's how it's been getting around the school: in the plumbing.”
“Dobby has stopped Harry Potter's mail, sir,” the elf said, and pulled a thick stack of letters from inside his pillowcase.
Snape didn't lead him to his office, but the Potions classroom, closing the door behind them. Harry stood next to a desk uncertainly.
“No, I came to talk to you about it. We only got our Hogwarts letters yesterday, I hadn't really thought about when we might go,” Harry said.
The entire class looked at Daphne who was blushing happily in the first row. While she certainly wasn't dumb, she didn't usually come out with top marks. Pansy whispered something to her that made her hit Pansy on the shoulder. Lockhart wasn't looking however, as he was too busy lifting a covered cage onto his desk.
Harry read his quiz and looked up at Lockhart in disbelief. Every single question contained Lockhart's full name. What was worse, Harry actually knew some of the answers from reading the books. In a decidedly bad mood now, Harry answered what he did know, then left nonsense answers for the others. Hopefully Lockhart didn't know much about the Muggle world.
A flash of annoyance crossed Lockhart's face before he grinned at Theo. “Ah, Mr Nott, don't be so dismissive! These little rascals gave the Gryffindors quite a bit of trouble the other day. But I think you lot could do a bit better, don't you?”
Harry stifled a yawn, making Gemma giggle. He glared at her over his tea. “How are you always this cheery?”
Harry looked back at the Malfoys. Draco looked as if he'd been trying to follow the conversation, while his mother was watching Harry with wide eyes. “Er, I take it Draco didn't tell you I speak Parseltongue, then?”
Pomfrey's office door banged open and she made her way over. “All of you out right now! This boy has thirty-three bones to regrow and he needs rest!”
After Harry and Draco easily beat Greg and Vince, they got changed out of their snow-covered clothes and went up to the Great Hall for the Christmas feast. The hall was decorated just as magnificently as it had been the year before, although there were far less students this year. The Slytherin table was nearly half full, but the other three tables had less than ten students each. Harry looked across at the Gryffindor table where Hermione appeared to be in awkward conversation with the Weasley girl.
They spent the morning brewing, with Snape asking Harry a question about most steps. Finally, they had two cauldrons simmering with nearly completed potions.
They stopped rough housing when Mrs Malfoy led them into the bakery. Five minutes later and Harry and Draco were happily trying each other's milkshakes as Mrs Malfoy sipped her coffee and they waited for their food.
Lockhart must have finally noticed Snape's expression as he quickly changed tacks. “Well! Enough from us! Professor Snape, if you'd like to assist, let's get them into pairs so they can have a go!”
“The Headmaster. Still, I was able to use my arm as an excuse to get out of being made to act out scenes from his books in class.” Harry chopped the last starfish a little harder than necessary at the memory of those classes.
Harry was woken early on Christmas morning by Draco bouncing onto his bed and shaking him. “Get up, Harry, there are presents!”
Harry had no answer to this, and was uncomfortably aware that his friends were watching the conversation.
” Snape cried. A jet of red light shot out of his wand and hit Lockhart squarely in the chest. His wand flew out of his hand and he shot into the air before flying backwards off the stage to hit the wall behind it. Harry high-fived Draco as they cheered along with the other Slytherins.
“Feel like a picnic?” Harry asked a little breathlessly. They both looked out the doorway to the still slightly snowy grounds. “All right, an indoor picnic?”
Draco looked a little happier at that. “Good. I tried to find you a Parseltongue dictionary, but apparently they don't exist. The clerk I spoke to said there isn't a written language, which is just stupid. How can you teach anyone a language if you can't write it down?”
“McGonagall called me into her office last night and convinced me not to take Divination next year. She said something about it being too difficult to organise for me to take so many classes, and then informed me that the entire subject wouldn't be intellectually stimulating for me,” she replied quickly. “Too much guess work and not enough logical thinking in her opinion.”
There was a strange choking sound behind Harry, and he spun around to see an extremely old, extremely ill-looking bird sitting on a perch. Most of its feathers had fallen out, and Harry thought it was one of the ugliest things he'd seen in a while. It stared back at him before giving another coughing sound, and then it burst into flames.
“Nonsense! While it wouldn't take long to Apparate to Gringotts, that will be unnecessary. The shop we're going to will be happy to send your bill to the goblins to sort out. We're some of their most valued customers, you see,” she said.
Ernie looked at her pityingly. “Susan, think about it. How could a baby do that, if he didn't have some strong, Dark magic? You-Know-Who probably saw him as a threat, and went to snuff him out before he got too powerful. And even if Potter isn't a pure-blood, I've heard he hates the Muggles he lives with.”
Mrs Malfoy shrunk down his trunk and broomstick in silence, and handed them to Draco as she peered closer at the cupboard. Suddenly, she straightened up and closed the door. When Harry looked up at her, her face held none of its earlier warmth. She marched into the lounge, with both boys following, Draco's arm still around Harry. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia fell silent as Mrs Malfoy entered the room. Dudley was hiding unsuccessfully behind the arm of the couch.
“I'm giving him extra lessons in Potions, Minerva. But yes, if he deserved it I'd have no qualms about assigning him detention tomorrow.”
“Yeah, but he doesn't use them to hurt people! Besides, you were able to talk him out of hatching a dragon last year. Would he really have listened to you and given up the egg if he wanted to attack people with monsters?” Harry stood up. “We have to go talk to him.”
Draco came down the stairs, and a second later Tilly popped back into the foyer and deposited his trunk next to Harry's.
Snape closed his eyes briefly then shook his head. He levitated the mirror in front of the basilisk's face. “Tell it to open its eyes.”
“Congratulations on the worst Valentine ever, but he's not interested,” he snarled at the Weasley girl. Her face flushed as red as her hair and she ran off into a classroom.
Twenty minutes later they were on their way to the Slytherin common room when Harry stopped. “Let's go see Snape instead.”
Hagrid looked at Draco for a moment before jerking his head in a short nod and picking up the kettle. They seated themselves at the table as Hagrid busied himself serving the tea.
Harry allowed Draco to drag him out of the dorm. He saw the remains of what had clearly been a successful party in the common room, and more than one older student was passed out on the couches amid empty bottles.
He paced the room and tried to take stock of what he had. An owl, paper and pencils, but no way to get her out to get help. A few old novels he'd already read that summer. Some of Dudley's old broken toys. That was it.
Draco tightened his hold on Harry's waist. “I saw it on our way into the bathroom,” he said quietly.
Draco stared after him for a second before returning to his seat. “So what did you just say? I think I recognised half of it.”
McGonagall raised a hand. “Not quite. Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are finally ready to be harvested. As I speak, she and Professor Snape are preparing them for the potion which will be used to cure those who have been Petrified. Not only will your friends be returned to full health tonight, but one of them may even be able to tell us the identity of their attacker.”
Dobby wrung the hem of his pillowcase. “Dobby can't say, sir. Dobby just wants Harry Potter to be safe, and Hogwarts won't be safe for Harry Potter this year.”
They carefully shut the office door firmly behind them, picked up their bags from the ruined classroom and ran off, giggling at the thought of what the pixies would do once they woke up.
Draco leaned forward with interest, but Mrs Malfoy was shaking her head. “They won't do any good, Harry. Your music device won't operate at the Manor, nor at Hogwarts. Too much magic in the atmosphere for Muggle technology to work.”
They watched as she ran out of the hall. “Remind me to never get between her and a book,” Draco said.
Draco nodded. “This was before the Statute of Secrecy, of course. Mother told me all about it; my father doesn't like to mention him.”
“Just don't mention her, alright?” Draco whispered yet again. He and Harry were waiting for Mr Malfoy in the foyer, both clutching their Hogwarts letters.
“I got caught with Aragog. They thought he killed that girl in the bathroom. I was just a lad so they expelled me instead of sendin' me to Azkaban.”
“Gather round, everyone!” Lockhart looked more dishevelled as he surveyed the scene. “Well, seems I'd better teach you all how to block. Perhaps some volunteers... Miss Granger and Mr Longbottom, up you get.”
Harry rested Hedwig's cage on his trunk as he hugged Draco goodbye. “Thank you,” he whispered to Narcissa over Draco's shoulder. She gave him a small smile in return.
Harry blinked and looked around the shower stall, trying to remember how he'd gotten there. He felt tired, and the warm steam was doing nothing to wake him up. A glance at his wrinkled hands told him he'd been standing under the water for some time, so he got out and dried off.
They couldn't see its face because of the angle they were at, but the result was instantaneous. The basilisk jerked briefly as though having a seizure, before a ripple swept through it from head to tail, and it was still.
“Oh, right, sorry,” she pulled back and beamed at him, before hugging Draco. “And you! Where have you been? We were so worried about you!”
Dumbledore came walking backwards into the room, with McGonagall coming after him. They were carrying something stiff between them which they hauled onto a bed. Harry raised himself slightly to get a better look as McGonagall rushed off to Pomfrey's office.
When the elf disappeared, Harry quickly put on his dressing gown and slippers, and picked up his letters.
“Shit!” Harry looked around him desperately for some water, but couldn't see anything. He watched helplessly as the bird gave a shriek and burnt into a pile of ash. Harry swore again as he crept closer. He was already in enough trouble without Dumbledore thinking he'd killed his bird, too. He heard the door open and jerked around.
She stopped on the edge of the crowd next to the Hogwarts Express. She pulled out their trunks and reversed the shrinking spell. Harry and Draco gratefully rested the heavy owl cages on top of them. Mrs Malfoy fussed with Draco's collar.
“But I booked the pitch! I booked it!” Wood yelled. Despite the fact that he looked close to frothing at the mouth, Harry couldn't help admiring his accent.
Draco made as if to hug him, but stopped when Snape shook his head. “Harry, you are not the first person to be taken in by the Dark Lord. Older and more experienced wizards than you have willingly followed him.”
Mrs Malfoy ignored his hand and pulled him into a hug. “It was a pleasure, Harry. And what I said to Draco goes for you, too. Stay safe this year.”
shall ask her. I do not want you two sneaking around like you did last year, do you understand?” When they nodded, he continued. “Good. Now, Mr Potter, I need to address the rest of the house. When I am through, I want your Cloak.”
Snape looked at him intently. “I understand that you are unaccustomed to adults looking out for your welfare, but you are a Slytherin. Try not to act like a Gryffindor.”
Harry laughed. “So, nothing like Daphne, then. Wait, does this mean we can't sneak into the Gryffindor common room anymore?”
“Draco tells me you're becoming quite a formidable player,” Mrs Malfoy said as she seated herself opposite Harry.
Draco looked around the room. “We're going to figure out who's doing this. And they're going to pay.”
“Blimey, there's a lot here,” Harry said as he flicked through. Most of it was from Draco and Hermione, but there were a few from Pansy, Daphne and Theo, and even one or two from his other friends.
Draco gave a weak smile, and Snape snorted. “Perhaps I'll take to possessing you each time you've a Potions essay to write.”
“Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I've been sitting on for some time!” Lockhart paused as he smiled at everyone. Harry stared at his mouth; he'd never seen someone show that many teeth before. It was blinding.
“Mother says the Ministry wants to get it over with as quickly as possible to avoid the bad publicity,” Draco said. “It's because of you, of course.”
Before Harry knew what was happening, Ainsley had guided him into a large changing room and was taking his measurements. He was reminded of the way Ollivander had measured him when he bought his wand, but the memory soon faded. Where Ollivander had been quiet and a little creepy, Ainsley was a cheery fellow. The way he kept saying “ah” made Harry think of a pirate, and he gave a series of friendly but detailed instructions to a non-stop stream of assistants who came in to join them. They quickly returned, each with armfuls of clothing which were hung up on hooks around the room.
“Yeah, well, they're not the nicest family,” Harry grumbled, pulling a pin out to look at it closely.
They walked on, and soon left the formal gardens behind, and entered a vast expanse of lawn, bordered by yet more hedges. There were pale statues scattered over the grass, a large marble gazebo off to the side, and a man-made pond at the base of the gentle slope.
Theo arrived next to Harry in time to repel the Bludger on its return. “Did you put some sort of Summoning Charm on this, Harry?” he yelled.
“Well, he's not a particularly good one, if that's the case,” she said. They stared at her. “Think about it. Both times you heard someone saying they were going to kill. So far, everyone's just been Petrified rather than killed, but not because you were able to change or prevent anything from your advanced warning. So I don't think that's it.”
Dobby disappeared with a crack. Harry hastily put the water jug back on the table and lay back against his pillow, shifting his sore arm as he watched the infirmary door.
“I did. I couldn't continue to use the name of my filthy Muggle father, so I chose a name that I knew would strike terror into all who heard it.” Tom smiled. To Harry's confusion, he looked more solid than he had earlier. “From what Ginny and yourself have told me, I succeeded in that. Do you know, she couldn't bear to even write the name at first? Not you, though. Why is that?”
Harry snapped the diary shut as the last of Tom's reply sank into the paper. He emerged from his bed, grabbed his Slytherin scarf and met Draco's expectant gaze.
“Yes. You need to make a formal complaint about Lockhart. He de-boned your entire arm!” Draco's eyes flashed. “Against your consent, too.”
“Well, they had a screaming row, which was unusual, as they don't really shout much. I could hear them all the way from my room. Judging from the crashes, I think Mother demolished a large part of Father's study; it took most of the house-elves a week to get it sorted again. And then it all went quiet and a while later, Father came up and told me I'd be going to Hogwarts after all.”
“You're not crazy, Harry,” Hermione sighed. “I'm sure there's an explanation. We just don't have enough information to work it out yet.”
Tilly disappeared as Harry walked into the room. The Malfoy owlery was much smaller than the one at Hogwarts, but the smell was the same. He found Hedwig perched next to Thoth, and grinned at the thought of them becoming friends, when he noticed they weren't alone.
“Remarkable,” Mr Malfoy said. He stared at Harry for a few seconds, before standing up. “Draco, I've meetings tomorrow that I must prepare for now.”
“Happy Christmas, Hedwig,” Harry murmured as he took the envelope off her. It had a toothpick and a note from the Dursleys, telling him to ask if he could stay at Hogwarts over the summer holidays. Harry balled the lot up and threw it into the nearest fire before stroking Hedwig. “Not even some interesting Muggle stuff I could give to Tracey or Theo. But thanks for bringing it – I'll take you to the kitchens for some meat later, all right?”
“I wanted to borrow some hair pins. To practise picking locks without magic,” he elaborated when she looked at him oddly.
Dobby shook his head, making his ears flap. “No, Harry Potter is in danger. Dobby just wants Harry Potter to be safe. When Harry Potter defeated the Dark Lord, life improved for house elves. Dobby is still treated like vermin by Master, of course, but mostly, things improved for house elves when the Dark Lord fell. And now that the Chamber of Secrets is open again – ”
Harry paused, then laid his head on Draco's shoulder. “We had lunch while we were waiting for the potion to finish. And he... He said I can go talk to him again on Boxing Day. About Mum.”
“Oh, that,” Draco grinned. “I tracked down Peeves and convinced him to come good on the favour he owed me.”
“History of Magic. She used to fall asleep in class, I believe, and dropped the subject as soon as she was able.”
“They're probably right,” Harry said, not taking his eyes off the dust mote that was floating above him. His reverie was broken some time later by Pansy hitting him with a pillow. “Ow.”
“Er, hello. Can I help you?” he asked it nervously. He had no idea why a house-elf would be in his room.
Sure enough, he found Draco and Hermione waiting for him. Draco was pacing impatiently as he and Hermione argued quietly. They stopped talking when they saw him step off the staircase.
When they got there, there was a crowd of kids in front of the window, and they had to push through to get a glimpse of the new broom. Draco stared at it enviously, while Harry told himself that his old Nimbus 2000 was flying just fine.
Mr Malfoy returned the embrace, then looked at Harry. “I trust you've enjoyed your stay at Malfoy Manor.”
Harry completed the rest of his chores in a much better mood than he'd begun them with, but his bad mood soon returned when he saw the meagre dinner Aunt Petunia had provided for him. He ate it sourly as he eyed the pork roasting in the oven. He'd be happy once this dinner with the Masons was over. Sullenly, he made his way up to his room, ignoring Uncle Vernon's final warning as the doorbell rang.
“What the ever-loving fuck is going on?” Draco asked as he sat down. Apart from Daphne, who was gigglier than was usual for the morning, the rest of their friends looked nauseated. Pansy pointed to the staff table with a jerk.
Snape snorted. “Unfortunately for you, Lockhart has requested to take the detention himself. As the injured party, I can hardly deny him.”
“Oh yeah?” Harry reached up and quickly messed up Draco's hair. Draco howled and shoved him back, and they continued to jostle each other behind Mrs Malfoy's back.
Harry opened his mouth to further argue the point, but something about Draco's expression stopped him. “Whatever. Come on, let's get this over with.”
“False alarm,” he said to their concerned looks. He shoved something into Harry's pocket under the table. Harry stuck his hand into his pocket and felt the slippery folds of his Cloak. He shot a questioning look at Draco and got an innocent smile in return.
,” Harry muttered quickly, and started stuffing his things back into his bag. Next thing he knew, the dwarf had pushed him over and was sitting on his legs.
“Thanks, Tilly,” Harry said as he gently took the letter off Hedwig's leg. “Could you please give her some bacon and then return her to the owlery?”
Tilly bowed and disappeared, leaving Harry alone in his room. He filled his mug, piling it high with marshmallows, then began sorting out his mail. It took him a few hours and many mugs of hot chocolate until he'd read through everything and written out replies. Finally, he had letters for Hermione, Pansy, Daphne, Theo, Blaise and Tracey. He'd also made a birthday card for Neville, drawing a red and gold lion on the cover, as he knew Neville's birthday was sometime around his own.
Harry waved at his friends as he set off for the library, trying to ignore the way heads swivelled as he passed by. Getting this sorted out with Justin would hopefully lessen the cloud of suspicion hanging over Harry's head. At the very least, he couldn't make things any worse.
Snape cleared his throat. “Once Mr Malfoy had opened the entrance to the Chamber, I felt it was far too dangerous for him to accompany me down.”
Harry stared back, before rewinding to the start of the song and putting a headphone in Draco's ear and pressing play again. “Just listen.”
“Morning,” Draco replied. He waited silently for Harry to finish getting ready, before they set off for breakfast.
Draco let out a bitter laugh. “Trust me, it was him. He hates that I'm friends with Hagrid, and he's always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to Hogwarts. He has the other governors in his pocket and he's very influential with Fudge.”
“Seriously, who chooses their passwords?” Draco whispered in Harry's ear as they slipped in behind her.
“Yeah, Draco's been the same with me,” Harry laughed. He and Ginny grinned at each other as Draco and the twins looked at each other.
Harry spent the rest of lunch trying to sort through what Hermione and Neville had told him. They chatted to each other as Harry silently followed them down to Potions, where he was so distracted he almost missed a step in his Hair-Raising Potion.
Snape paused and looked out over the room. “I trust you all understand the seriousness of the situation we are now in. Anyone found flouting the new rules will be harshly punished. Thus far, there have been no Slytherins attacked, and I would very much like to keep it that way. If any one of you has any information about the attacks, inform a member of staff. Finally, if any of you become upset or anxious, I reiterate that the Prefects will be able to contact me. Prefects, if you would see me for a moment.”
Harry shrugged. “Well, it's a stone castle, isn't it? Besides, he said in a chapter on fire crabs that he's an expert on dousing fires and repairing any damage caused, sir.”
The Slytherin stand was full by the time they arrived, but Pansy had saved them some seats. “Where's Hermione?” she asked.
Harry rolled his eyes and watched the Gryffindors huddled together at the far end of the table. “What will you do if the real heir gets caught?”
“She really misses you when you're at Hogwarts, doesn't she?” Harry asked once they were in the hallway.
“Over reacting? Harry, Hagrid has just informed us that there is a colony of giant, man-eating spiders living in the forest. I think I'm being rather calm given the situation,” Draco said. “What's to stop them picking off students?”
” Dumbledore strode through the crowd, with a trail of teachers behind him. He moved around the students to gently lift Mrs Norris from the wall. “Come with me, Argus. Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy.”
The next thing Harry knew, he was standing outside of Myrtle's bathroom, unsure of how long he'd been there for. He shook his head and took off for the Entrance Hall. Pepperup could wait; Draco wouldn't.
Malfoy sneered at him. “I hardly have a problem, Potter. Apart from you being here, of course. Mind solving that?”
It was vaguely annoying and Harry felt that tug of envy again before he dismissed it. He waved to his friends and walked in the opposite direction with Ginny to look for a compartment, hoping to find Draco quickly.
As if burned, Harry wrenches his hand away, realising one second too late that his movement had been too sudden, and he watches helplessly as Malfoy first frowns, then groans into his shirt and finally flutters his eyes open.
Rumours had hit the mill, just like Draco had said, because now that Umbridge was gone, Blaise had been more than happy to reveal what had really happened with the Squad, without mentioning what had happened at the office, of course. And when the rest of the D.A had gone to Harry for confirmation and got it, it had spread all around the school.
“A bit of water never killed anyone.” Harry placed a hand on the centre of the table. “But we could try running.”
