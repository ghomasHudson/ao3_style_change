”Nagini”, the cold voice continues with a hiss. ”You are out of luck. I will not be feeding Wormtail to you after all…”
Madam Maxime goes first, raising her wand into the air… a long, silver ribbon shoots out of it and twists around in the air, creating a large figure eight. The audience applauds and Sirius thumps Harry on the shoulder.
the match”, Draco corrects with a smirk. ”I’ll be the one directing the Harry Potter fanclub to cheer —”
”Quite right”, Slughorn says. ”You recognised it, I suppose, by its distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen, yes?”
”We’re fine, Harry”, Hermione says kindly and even indulges him with a small, polite smile, but it quickly falls again as she spots something over his shoulder.
Harry sits back and wipes his face with his sleeve, looking between his dads uncomfortably. Remus is very obviously avoiding Sirius’s eye and instead glares at Harry’s porridge, even as he keeps rubbing Harry’s back gently. Sirius is throwing surreptitious glances in his husband’s direction, looking positively chastisized, but doesn’t say anything.
”Exactly”, Dumbledore says. ”Harry’s wand and Voldemort’s share cores. Each of them contain a feather from the same phoenix…
Harry’s stifles a sigh and slowly drifts a little closer to him. He can tell the other boy is tensing, getting ready to bolt, but he keeps drifting closer and closer to him until their broomsticks are nearly knocking into each other.
Harry beams as his daddy gives Draco a gentle pat on the shoulder and then pushes past him to shake the hands of all of Harry’s other friends casually, as if it’s not a big deal at all that he just hugged Draco for the first time. Draco is standing rigidly, still clearly in shock, when Harry brushes their fingers together and then he shakes out of it slightly and meets his gaze.
”It’s okay”, he says. ”I’ll take my Invisibility Cloak and sneak through the trapdoor and I’ll grab the stone before he can get his hands on it and keep it safe until tomorrow when Dumbledore gets back.”
Harry glances over, accidentally locking eyes with Ron who is standing next to the frizzy-haired witch.
”Actually, I was wondering if I might have a word…?” the man says, smoothly dodging his offered hand and slipping an arm around Harry’s shoulders instead.
Searching for the right words to start with, Harry looks around the room. The sun-bleached wallpaper, the old wooden desk by the window covering in notes for Remus book project and the two framed photographs propped up against the window frame. One of his dads as young men, maybe seventeen, sharing a blanket and a kiss. One of him and Draco from last year.
Harry chuckles tiredly and hums in agreement, his eyelids growing heavier and heavier. Finally, sleep wins though and darkness overtakes him.
”I dunno…” Draco mutters again, forcing his head up and blinking some focus back into his eyes. ”It probably means nothing, that you’re here, but… I dunno, I feel like… As long as I know
Desperate to touch, Harry drags his hands over the other boy’s body but he can barely make out his shape through all the layers he’s wearing — and speaking of which, his own clothes are stifling hot all of a sudden… He wants nothing more than to just tear them off — Well, he might possibly want to tear Draco’s off more —
Ron bats Harry’s hands away from him and pins him with a furious look, pointing a finger over his shoulder in Draco’s direction.
”You’re right, though”, Sirius says seriously, combing his fingers through the hair at the back of his neck. ”It
”Are you okay, Harry?” Remus hisses wildly, his hands roaming over his head and back, feeling for injuries.
What do you think you’re playing at, walking around the Forbidden Forest alone at night? I want you to swear, by return owl, that you are not going to leave the castle alone after dark again!
”I know…” Harry mumbles, letting the thought fill him up with a much needed warmth. ”I know, you’re right. Sorry for being a grump.”
The boys creep closer and Harry notices that some of the black pieces are missing, whereas the white side on the far end of the room seems to be intact.
”Look there”, Hagrid says. ”See that stuff shinin’ on the ground? Tha’ silvery stuff? Tha’s unicorn blood, which means there’s a unicorn in there tha’s badly hurt. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. So, what we’re gonna do is try an’ find the poor thing… We might have ter put it out of its misery an’ all…”
”Oh, right, right”, Sirius says dismissively. ”We didn’t get to talk then, though. Unfortunately. You know, she was always one of my favourite family members?” he tells Draco. ”That’s not saying much in our family, granted, but I always liked her enough…”
The rumours about Hagrid being part giant has already spread throughout the castle, but the gamekeeper himself haven’t been spotted since the Yule Ball and when Harry and the other Slytherins make their way down to his hut for their first Care Of Magical Creatures lesson of the spring term, it isn’t the half-giant who is waiting for them but an elderly witch with close-cropped grey hair and a stern expression to rival that of McGonagall’s.
”Not a clue”, Harry shakes his head. ”But I keep dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries and in the dream I feel this longing to get it open and get to the other side… I never understood what the big deal was, but clearly Voldemort has been thinking about it all these months, yearning for whatever’s inside and I’ve been channeling that in my sleep!”
and they hop inside hurriedly. Harry scans the numbers on the buttons quickly, thinking back to theat day in the summer when he was here with his dad and pressing the button with the nine on it. With a stomach-jolting jostle, the lift begins to descend rapidly into the darkness below them. Harry feels Draco inch closer to him, his hand clambering to grip his at his side and Harry gives it a reassuring squeeze.
As the party rages on in the Slytherin Common Room, Harry seats himself on one of the sofas in front of the fire and tries to focus on the people around him instead of the one person missing from the celebrations. But even with a rather tipsy Blaise lounging on the floor in front of him and leaning back against his leg, and a horklump drunk Seamus draped heavily over his side, Harry finds his mind wandering to Draco alone in the dorm… Even when Seamus gives him a blow-by-blow account of the other champions’ dealings with their dragons, in a steadily slurring voice, Harry keeps glancing over to the passageway leading to the boys’ dorms, until his attention is snatched once more by a reeking, hot breath tickling his ear…
, amongst the regular white eggs between the Hungarian Horntail’s clawed feet, glints the golden egg —
The thought of his dads recoiling from him in horror is enough to turn Harry’s stomach inside-out, but it can’t be helped. He needs to tell them everything. Because he needs them to help him understand, and to tell him things will be all right.
On the other hand, the plan doesn’t work at all, because McLaggen continues walking toward them and Draco can’t very well enjoy his kiss with Potter when someone as slimy as Cormac McLaggen is watching, so he pulls back, entirely out of breath.
to kill you may be taking it a little too far.” Pansy was always trying to be the voice of reason. Draco hated it, it made it much harder to argue with her.
Pansy softly clears her throat, and two sets of eyes turn to her. “Don’t be mad, Draco, but he, ah, actually doesn’t. I didn’t send all five of them.”
Teddy drifts off to sleep, his head on Draco’s chest and his legs over Harry’s torso, clutching his favorite stuffed dragon. Draco reaches over and runs his fingers through the boy’s hair; when he sleeps, it always turns the same sandy brown colour that Remus’ was.
Ron came out of the kitchen where he had been putting away their breakfast dishes. “Draco, it’s okay. You left your wand on the table.”
He brings a hand to Draco’s chest, fingers running over part of the diagonal scar that stretches from Draco’s neck to his hip.
Hermione and Ron knew something was going on, but Ginny was the first to figure it out. (She then quietly told everyone else – knowing Harry needed support, even if he wasn’t yet able to talk about his feelings.)
He turned and saw two pairs of eyes looking at him from one of the couches. One person was trying — unsuccessfully, Draco might add — to stifle their giggles behind a red and gold throw pillow.
Draco dumped the box out all over the bed, ignoring Harry’s half-hearted protest. He selected a strawberry one and held it out.
From them, he wasn’t sure who moved first, but suddenly, there was the gentle pressure of Draco’s lips against his own. It stayed soft and slow, the perfect first kiss. Small movements, small breaths, and when Draco pulled back, he didn’t move far.
“No one! I promise, I didn’t even tell Pansy.” The rest goes unsaid; Draco’s no longer close enough to anyone else to be spreading secrets.
“What a way to treat your oldest friend,” she asks, feigning offense. “I came to make sure you hadn’t been murdered, considering when I left you had Harry yelling at you from one direction and McLaggen walking up from the other.”
Draco must be hallucinating. Maybe he inhaled some fumes in the shop and the whole last, insufferable week has been some sort of potion-induced dream.
He glanced towards the window now, and while it was dark outside, he could just make out the shape of something against the glass.
He glanced over, grey eyes meeting green, and took a moment to admire one of the most handsome men he had ever seen. Tall, thin, with messy black hair, wire-rimmed glasses and wearing a slightly too-large sweater, Draco was immediately drawn in.
“You’re discussing the letters?” Blaise didn’t wait for a response. “At least wait until I’m out of the room, I can’t have this conversation twice in the span of five minutes. ‘Do you think he meant what he wrote? Do you think we’ll ever be able to talk in person?’” His tone was slightly mocking, but he was smiling.
“Thought you might be hungry,” he said, setting the tray down on the bed. He smiled sheepishly, “We did use a lot of energy last night.”
Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like they’ll have time at the moment — from behind them, there’s a faint pop of Apparition, and Draco turns, horrified, to find McLaggen walking down the street, his own letter in hand. He has the gall to wink when he catches Draco’s eye, and Draco does the only thing he can think of to ensure McLaggen knows, without a doubt, that Draco is very much Not Interested.
Draco opened his eyes to see the flaming red hair of the girl Weasley; the foot that had woken him up belonged to her. He couldn’t say he was surprised by the tactic.
They had made their way back to the dorms last night, exhausted from kissing and exhausted from talking. Harry had asked Draco to stay, and so he did.
So instead, he was left to cry alone outside the classroom and work to reconcile the image of his parents as doting and loving with the knowledge that they had abused a child.
But that laugh — that was all it took. It should have been obvious immediately, but maybe Draco had been willfully oblivious to the truth.
“I thought you wanted this?” Potter’s brow furrowed in confusion. “Otherwise, why do you keep coming to my bed?”
She made her way to the bedroom to get dressed, pulling out a navy-coloured jumper and some jeans. The woman in bed behind her stirred, and Hermione turned to kiss her good morning.
He almost recognised the writing, but like a word on the tip of his tongue, he couldn’t place where he had seen it before.
Following the horde was a solitary tawny owl. It was small, but its feathers were a beautiful mix of white and different browns. In its beak, it carried a single letter, which it swooped down to deliver to Harry. It wasn’t a bird he was familiar with, but it had the multi-coloured band around one foot marking it as a Hogwarts owl.
Harry left lecture notes for him on his bed, he knew Malfoy had been home those days only because the pile of papers had been straightened and moved to Malfoy’s desk.
Even with that decision made, the day passed slowly. It was the strange time of year between winter and spring, where it was lovely out but not yet warm, and Harry didn’t want to go out in the cold. Still, he didn’t want to be cooped up inside all day. Ron wasn’t answering his texts, which meant he was either hungover or was still with Hermione. Harry suspected the former and hoped, for Ron’s sake, for the latter.
Harry nodded again, reaching for Draco’s hand. “I know. It wouldn’t have worked then, but now, we’re different people.”
Thank you to everyone who's sticking with the story! <3 I'm having fun writing it and I hope you're all enjoying.
The Floo roars green, and Harry’s left alone in their flat. He busies himself by cleaning the dishes and making their bed, all the while hoping that Draco’s doing okay.
The corridor hadn’t been of true interest to the trio since their first year and all the nasty business of the stone. None of the rooms were in active use for students, so it had been deemed less important to fix.
“Please, will you come back to our dorm so we can go to bed? I’ll let you take your drink on the way,” Harry pleaded.
She was the one that made him realize it. Sitting at the bar with Luna, listening to her talk about her trips and the creatures she had seen, Ron realized he was lacking passion in his work.
It had only been a couple of days since the news, since the announcement of Lucius’ sentence, so perhaps it wasn’t surprising that Draco hadn’t yet returned to Hogwarts. But with winter hols coming up soon, Harry wasn’t sure they’d have a chance to talk — to really talk — before break. It worried him.
As expected, none of the letters have been replaced, even though Pansy promised, she promised — and then it hits him. Being the sneaky Slytherin she is, Pansy agreed to never tell anyone about the letters; she didn’t say anything about not sending them.
Draco turned to look at the table behind him. A woman with bushy black hair was talking to a chubby, sandy-haired man – clearly neither of them cared much about the outcome of the bet. It was obvious that one of the two redheads had been the one to give the dare.
He put his pumpkin juice down so fast that half of it spilled on Neville, but Harry couldn’t be bothered to notice. He only had eyes for Draco, who was finally,
They sat in comfortable silence for what seemed like hours, the crackling of the logs the only sound in the room.
Stretched back against the wall, hands loosely cupping his half-empty mug, Blaise looks disinterested in the proceedings, but they’ve been friends for too long for Draco to buy the act.
The thing is, this last letter is different. It’s the most recent of the five, but it’s also the only one that expresses real feelings; this one references the war, it references seven years of animosity and handshakes that could have gone differently, scared boys who should have tried harder.
Even though they had been dating for a few months, they were trying to take things slow. Their history had never been, well, easy to say the least, and neither Harry nor Draco wanted to mess up what they had now.
He brushed it and braided it, became fascinated with it. When they first kissed – after a successful trip looking for bowtruckles – Ron pulled her hair out of her bun and let the long blonde strands tangle between them.
“Pans, I spend all of my free time with you – I thought you knew I liked you. You didn’t have to buy a pet to get my attention.”
He climbed into his own bed, his flannel sheets wrapping around him. There was a crash on the other side of the room and a slurred curse before Harry felt the weight of another person fall on top of him.
That seems to grab her whole focus, and she turns to him, her eyes growing wide as she claps her hands together. “Give it, give it! What did he say?”
“Merlin, Harry — you should know better than to open mail when you don’t recognise the sender! Did you even check to see if it was cursed?” She gestured to the space around them. “I know you have experience with that spell.”
Draco huffed. “Instead of a pretentious eleven-year-old, I’m branded as a Death Eater and you saved the wizarding world. Have we really changed that much?”
Running through the secret passageways, Harry was turning corners quickly with no regard for who else might be there — truthfully, he wasn’t expecting anyone else to be there. He was steps away from exiting the passageway and entering the Great Hall when he ran into none other than Malfoy.
“Almost seven. I was just headed to the library to get some studying in before breakfast. Would you, well,” Granger looked at Draco strangely, “Would you like me to help you back to your dorm? The Fat Lady said you’ve been here for hours.”
It was daft, to go outside this late — and in the cold — but he had to see Draco, and he knew exactly where he would find him.
It didn’t start when they were eleven, or seventeen, fighting a madman and fighting the demons within themselves. It didn’t start when they were both healing, focused on themselves as they adjusted to a freedom neither thought they would live to see.
“You already have one rejection,” he continues. “So you’re waiting on three more bachelors to show up. With the hints from earlier — and after dorming with you for seven years — one of them is obviously Potter.”
Harry sighs and Floos to the Ministry. With his top-level security clearance, it doesn’t take long before he’s striding into the Department of Mysteries.
With Malfoy pressing down against him, Harry was left with no choice but to look into those grey eyes. “Do you not want me?” Malfoy whispered. He looked upset, his brow was furrowed and Harry wanted nothing more than to smooth the lines.
Harry slides his fingers through Draco’s hair and kisses his cheek when Draco looks up. “I’m here to take you home.”
Harry has streaks of flour through his jet-black hair and across his shirt, and Teddy has a spot of chocolate on his nose. His hair is turquoise, as it is whenever he’s happy.
“I – I must have the wrong house. I’m looking for Harry.” The man takes a step back, grabbing the girl’s hand in one of his own.
Draco can feel Potter edging towards him, and Draco can feel himself doing the same. He has an overwhelming urge to touch – to reach out and grab Potter’s hand, run his fingers through Potter’s inky black hair.
Draco nods, standing slowly. His nose is red and his cheeks are pale – Harry can see why Hermione owled him.
Both fully naked, they take a minute to appreciate each other, the fading afternoon sun clearly illuminating the room.
“What are you doing hanging around Gryffindor? Especially in your pyjamas?” Weasley asked, seeming genuinely curious. Draco felt a surge of gratitude towards Granger, it seemed she hadn’t told the other two-thirds of the Golden Trio that she had found him yesterday.
Remus was the last of the Marauders. Peter, though alive, was not allowed to consider himself one of them, not after what he did. Remus could live without James – as much as anyone could live without part of themselves – but he couldn’t imagine life without Sirius.
Pansy crosses her arms, a tell of hers when she’s trying not to cry, anchoring herself as a distraction. “You’re lonely. And sad, and I thought maybe one of these would lead to something,”
Harry was offended, but only for a moment: There was a soft smile around Malfoy’s face. If he was anyone else, Harry would think he was joking.
He ended up sleepwalking again. Draco remembered the password into the Gryffindor common room, mumbling “purple pixies” when the Fat Lady prompted him for it.
Pansy sat in the dirt with Luna on her break, and Luna did nothing but tell her there were wrackspurts floating around her head.
He parked out front and forced himself out of his car, pulling the sleeves of his jumper over his hands as he did so. There were so many new scars, so many new wrinkles and grey hairs since he had last been here. Because he had been here, all those years ago – when he was still strong, hopeful; when he was still unbroken.
“Just let me in! Damnit, Draco, I know we aren’t friends, but I live with you. I do care about you.”
Pansy smiled. They’d been together for years now, she knew Hermione often grew thoughtful as the seasons changed. “Are they?”
The club was loud and filled with people; Draco would have expected nothing less from a Friday night. He sat alone at the bar, having been ditched by both Pansy and Blaise when they found someone more interesting, more willing to go home with them. He was used to it.
“Pansy,” he says, his voice cutting. “Any idea why I received a letter from Charlie Weasley last night?”
Pausing, Draco props himself up on an elbow to look at Harry more directly. “That wasn’t in the letter,” he says, feeling unsure.
On this particular morning, Harry wakes to find Draco’s side of the bed empty, save for half a dozen wrinkled tissues. Draco’s magic always gets a bit iffy when he isn’t feeling well, causing him to use muggle methods.
While he was busy not looking, he did find Pansy Parkinson, Malfoy’s closest friend. Where he was tall, she was short, where he was sharp angles, she was sharp with words. Her tongue could cut better than any knife, but more often than not, she used her weapon to tell off those who deserved it. Harry was terrified of her, but really, she was all right.
Harry debated texting Malfoy, but decided against it. They weren’t friends; it was better that he was with Blaise instead of awkwardly hanging out with Harry.
Grabbing Harry’s hand, he pulls them toward his bedroom and shoves Harry down on the bed before climbing on top of him. “I’ve been waiting for this for years,” he says between kisses, “so I hope you don’t find it too forward if I tell you to get your kit off.”
Draco’s arm was wrapped around Harry’s torso, one of his pale legs shoved between Harry’s darker thighs and his head buried in Harry’s neck. If they were dating, it would have been sweet.
He made his way to the common room, bringing a blanket from his bed and lighting the fire once he arrived. The warmth filled the room, and the flickering light cast everything in soft shadows.
It doesn’t take long for Pansy to emerge. She walks right up to him and wraps her arms around his waist, planting a light kiss against his cheek.
His friendship with Luna grew with each trip they took. They would spend hours in the hotel, looking at maps and laying out resources talking about the animals, and Ron started to play with Luna’s
Draco couldn’t help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation. “Your friends decided I’m the most attractive person here?”
Yet as he reached for the doorknob, he had no idea what he was planning to say – how was he supposed to greet someone he hadn’t seen in thirteen years?
“Darling, just tell him how you feel. Or at least try to befriend him — Granger already likes you, so that gives you an in.”
“— And, as I was saying, I can't just ‘tell Potter how I feel.’ Salazar, what are you, a bloody Hufflepuff?”
“Darling, learn to take a joke,” Pansy rolled her eyes. “Of course I’ll help, though I don’t know what you want me to do.”
The season wouldn’t last; they never did. But this, Hermione thought as she nodded at Pansy, this would. They’d continue to grow old together as autumn turned to winter, as another year passed them by.
“I’ve had a crush on you forever and you barely even talk to me. And now I’m stuck with Henry who steals everything!”
Malfoy throws his head back and laughs. “That’s it? You’re accusing me of what exactly? Getting attention?”
Malfoy kept eye contact with Harry as he shimmied out of his jeans, revealing black pants and long, pale legs.
In the summer, much of the work was getting classrooms ready for students. They fixed walls and righted tables, mended the stone and cleaned spell marks off the classroom walls. They needed to do enough that there was no question of Hogwarts being able to reopen. In the fall, they worked on the grounds under Hagrid’s leadership, making sure the magical creatures would have space to return.
About a cup and a half of coffee later, the Floo turns green and Pansy comes through — but it stays lit as Blaise follows her out.
Draco turned the corner sharply, lost in his thoughts and ran directly into Potter and Weasley, interrupting Weasley’s train of thought.
“I know something’s going on,” Blaise whispered, looking at his parchment and pretending to take notes. “I’m here if you need to talk.”
But for some reason, the visual confirmation isn’t enough, and Harry feels the urge to reach out and touch Draco. So he does. He lightly strokes Draco’s hair – which is silkier than it looks – and runs his thumb across Draco’s angular cheekbone.
“Neville, look at me. I would never want you to think that. You’re right, I didn’t like you before this year. But I didn’t like you because we were preparing to fight a war for our entire childhoods, and when it came, you were sad, depressed; you led a resistance in these walls, but you didn’t let anyone through your own.
He was starting to think he would be, soon. The medication would help, and Harry had good people in his life to help him and support him. The war was over, and it was time for him to start living.
Sighing, Harry looked down his roommate. He was sloshed, and reeked of alcohol, but Harry couldn’t help but notice how beautiful he was. His pale hair was more mussed than Harry had ever seen it, but it provided a soft frame to his face, a contrast to the harsh angles of his cheekbones and jaw.
It’s enough. Draco wasn’t looking for a declaration of love, or a serious discussion meant to define the relationship — he just wanted to make sure he wouldn’t be left with a broken heart and an empty bed come morning.
What’s Malfoy doing? And who is this mysterious “he” – Harry feels a tug in his stomach at the thought of Malfoy trying to get someone else’s attention.
There is chorus of intrigued murmurs around the crowd and Harry gasps when suddenly a face emerges from the dark mist. It’s a face that he’s seen once before, he realises. Several years ago, inside the Dark Forest: It’s an oddly square face with very sharp cheekbones, with blonde hair hanging in tufts down its sides, and two brilliantly blue eyes gleaming under a tufted fringe. It sits on the broad shoulders of a man’s upper body, that smoothly morphs into the palomino body of a horse.
Just as he’d suspected, it’s with a red raw hand that he makes his way back to the dungeons three hours later. Umbridge had interrupted him an hour earlier tonight, not out of kindness or mercy, but simply because that’s the amount of time it took Harry to create a deep enough cut in his hand.
He swallows down a yell of frustration and starts walking quickly again, barely even paying attention to where he’s going — it doesn’t matter, it just feels good to be
… so slowly, in fact, that by the time he’s finished, there’s only ten more minutes left of the lesson.
”Come on, come on, quickly…” Remus mutters, dragging Harry along behind him. ”This way, this way… God, packed with muggles, of course… Here we are, platform nine…”
”Okay”, Harry says breathlessly as Sirius keeps pushing him to walk faster, until finally he’s running alongside him, clutching his hand desperately so as not to lose him in the late morning crowd.
”Potter!” the Slytherin barks, but Harry ignores him and focuses his attention back to the fluttering owl in front of him. ”What’s your problem? Potter!”
It comes as no surprise that Professor Snape is good at chess, but when he’s got Harry in check mate after only three moves, when Harry is still working out his strategy, it starts to dawn on Harry that he might very well be the best chess player he’s ever met, better than both Ron and Draco combined… They keep playing though, and after the first two games, the professor starts giving Harry pointers and they actually end up having a good time together. So much so that, when the hour has passed and it’s time to go to the feast, Harry feels like they’ve only just got started and he’s actually reluctant to stop playing.
”No, not the real Moody — Barty Crouch Jr., when he was impersonating Moody, last year — he transformed Draco into a ferret, then he made him bounce up and down on the floor —
As soon as the two larger boys decide to stop cracking their knuckles for the evening and both disappear behind their bed-hangings, Seamus immediately makes a beeline for their four-posters and throws a
He dives to avoid it and Lucian manages to hit it again but with no time to aim, this time he sends it in a random direction; once again, the bludger swerves like a boomerang and heads for Harry’s head again —
He waits until his dads’s voices quiet down out in the kitchen, then ventures out of his bedroom again. He finds Sirius sprawled out on the sofa listening to the Wireless, but there’s no sign of Remus anywhere.
He staggers to his feet, careful not to trod on any of the creatures that have now begun to croak and jump around on the floor.
The rest of the lesson continues in the same fashion and everyone is excited to go up to the glass box and study Hinkypunk more closely, but Harry is hardly even aware of anything that goes on around him, taking notes on auto-pilot and not raising his hand a single time… As the bell rings, Remus asks him to stay behind and for the first time ever, Harry wishes he would just let him be… He doesn’t know what to think about everything he’s just found out, let alone what to say…
”I’m sorry, but you’re simply too nosy to live, Potter…” Quirrell says in a drawling voice. ”Scurrying around the school at Hallowe’en like that, for all I knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone…”
”With all due respect, Albus”, Dawlish says, frowning. ”You are the Headmaster of Hogwarts, not a Ministry Official… we need to get Harry’s
Grabbing at the material of the other boy’s robes, Harry presses their bodies flush together, desperate for closeness and — as warmth pools in his belly and then trickles lower and lower — for friction. His hips buck as if they have a mind of their own. His growing hardness grinding against Draco who gasps and mirrors the movement twice before wrenching himself away. They stand a mere inch apart, staring at each other in stunned silence, with chests heaving and pupils blown.
Harry whips his head around and nearly groans as he sees Gilderoy Lockhart striding towards them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him and his teeth gleaming.
”So, now that we are all fed and watered”, he says gently, smiling down at them. ”I must once more ask for your attention, while I give out a few notices… Mr Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include Screaming Yo-yos, Fanged Frosbees and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. The full list comprises some four hundred and thirty-seven items, I believe, and can be viewed in Mr Filch’s office, if anybody would like to check it…”
When they’re two hundred yards from the shore, Sirius wades out to meet them. He loops an arm around Draco’s waist and smoothly transfers the boy’s weight from Harry to himself, dragging him towards the shore and Harry feels a surge of relief and gratitude as his numb limbs barely have enough strength left in them to carry his weight out of the water, let alone the combined weight of himself and Draco and it would have been extremely embarrassing if he would have collapsed this close to the finish line…
”Now, they’ll be attracted by the smell o’ the meat, but I’m going ter give ’em a call anyway, ’cause they’ll like ter know it’s me…” Hagrid tells the class.
His dads must sense it too, because they take turns patting him on the back and petting his hair, until finally Harry pulls his head away from Remus hand and mumbles at him to
The shadowed person gets closer and closer to him and Harry tenses his muscles, readying himself for a fight or —
”I did, in fact, not mean to imply anything”, Dumbledore says and all but matches his tone. ”But upon learning that the famous founder of the house could talk to snakes, just like he himself could, Riddle became even more excited and I believe it only increased his sense of self-importance… However, if he did frighten or impress his fellow Slytherins with demonstrations of Parseltongue in the Common Room, no hint of it ever reached the staff and he showed no outward arrogance and aggression at all. In fact, an unusually talented and very good-looking orphan, he naturally drew the attention and sympathy of all of his teachers almost from the moment he arrived. He seemed polite, quiet and any hunger for power that slipped through the cracks of his social persona was understandably interpreted as a thirst for knowledge. Nearly all were most favourably impressed by him.”
He’s still fighting the urge to fall asleep on his feet as they’re all trudging back to the dungeons and the stuffy potions classroom does very little to wake him up. Harry slumps into his seat next to Draco, trusting the blonde to pay attention to the instructions while he rests his head on his hand and stares unseeingly at the cauldron in front of him, focusing on not allowing his eyelids to close.
So Harry and Dumbledore will have their moments in this fic, however, their relationship will not be as close as in canon, since as far as Harry is concerned, Dumbledore is just his Headmaster and they've barely even spoken to one another.
Harry whips his head around and stares at Snape in horror. The man merely glares back, shaking out his robes and flicking his damp hair out of his face.
”And then Harry made that comment about — Yep, I remember”, the other girl nods, squinting seriously at the ceiling.
”Cutting it a bit close to curfew”, Slughorn says, even as he steps back and unlocks the door for them. ”But go on then… You know your way around, Harry—”
Harry tears his eyes away from the clawed foot of the professor’s wooden leg and meets his good eye politely. The magical one flicks round to zoom in on him as well.
Harry holds his breath plunges his face into the swirling, silvery substance. He lands in front of a much younger, slimmer and less balding Professor Slughorn. He blinks in surprise and takes a step back. The man is sitting in the same winged armchair that Harry has seen in his quarters now, grasping a wineglass in one hand and picking his way through a box of crystallised pineapple with his other.
Harry blinks stupidly at the blonde, while his brain whirrs to a sudden stop, before sluggishly trying to backtrack for any clues he might have missed that would explain where
Once the phial is filled, he stumbles back to the cauldron and tips it over. The blood dribbles into the cauldron and its content gives off an aggressive hiss, then begins to turn from its blood red colour to pearly white, diamond sparks shooting out of it, while Wormtail slumps to the ground and cradles his bleeding stump to his chest, sobbing quietly.
He glances over at his daddy to find him staring back at him with a knowing look, but he says nothing. Harry ducks his head, feeling a twinge of something in his stomach. Sirius seems genuinely unaware of their silent exchange, because he keeps chatting away about Quidditch happily and, Harry swallows a tired sigh, he’s already drawn the parallel to James.
Professor Snape’s glare ushers the rest of the class out of the classroom at record speed and as soon as they’re alone, he turns to face Harry with a dour frown that is somewhat mitigated when he shakes his hair out of his face. Harry quickly presses his lips together to hide his ausement.
”Last night was the third night this week that I went to check on you and you weren’t in your bed”, Remus says with forced calm. ”I want you to tell me the truth, Harry… how many nights have you snuck out?”
”Next time, try and break into someone else’s department, eh, Harry?” he says good-naturedly and winks at him.
Feeling his heart pound in his chest and his legs tremble slightly under him, Harry walks over to it.
, stunned with a similar reaction. That time, it was vault in Gringott’s that had been broken into. Another impenetrable place. He knows now that it had been Voldemort who broke in to that vault, even if he was possessing Quirrell at the time. And if there was any doubt in Harry’s mind who broke these Death Eaters out of prison, that connection would surely convince him.
Harry doesn’t remember much about the night before, even after Seamus’ hangover spell, but he figures whatever they got up to, it must have done some patching up because the atmosphere is definitely lighter and, although Malfoy doesn’t go out of his way to talk to him, he does jerk his head a little to the side as if to say
When the mail arrives, Harry instinctively scans the ceiling for Hedwig but then he remembers he’s yet to write home and tell his dads the dates of this year’s Hogsmeade weekends and makes a mental note to jot them down later this afternoon, knowing they have a free period after lunch and Draco wants to spend it in the Common Room to complete their homework for Charms and Divination anyway.
Harry blinks, and releases an incredulous breath. He’s starting to see why his dads like Dumbledore so much…
Then he remembers Rita Skeeter and her photographer catching him and Draco kissing… His stomach flips as her sugary voices echoes in his head:
Dumbledore, Harry”, Remus chastisises him gently, then sighs and puts his mug down on the bedside table again, then turns to face Harry more fully. ”And yes. In fact, he has already offered me the post permanently.”
A stunned silence falls inside the carriage, and then as one, all of Harry’s friends begin to snicker and shake their heads.
Harry takes one step towards the door to the circular room, but stumbles to a stop as it swings open and two other Death Eaters come barrelling into the room.
”It’s all right, sweetie…” Lily says softly. ”We weren’t meant to have more than a year together, you and I… but know that you carry my love with you always…”
”Don’t start”, Draco mutters, seemingly reading his mind and quickly ducks his head plant a kiss on Harry’s lips. ”Now, come on… I’m starving!”
The three-headed dog starts growling ominously and Draco clutches Harry’s arm so tightly he’s sure he’ll have bruises come morning.
— and if we don’t stop him — there won’t be a Hogwarts left to be expelled from! He’ll flatten it to the ground, or, or, turn it into a school for Dark Arts or something!”
”Now, let’s see what happens to Longbottom’s toad…” Snape says. ”If he has managed to produce a Shrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don’t doubt, he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned…”
He reaches across Draco, careful not to wake him up and grabs his glasses from the nightstand. He puts them on and as the lump regains the shape of his boyfriend, Harry can’t help but to release a soft breath of relief. Rationally, he knows it’s impossible (not to mention silly) that he would somehow find himself in the wrong universe again suddenly. But he also knows that the knot in his stomach, even though it has very little to do with rationale, is going to treat him to many sleepless nights in the next few weeks.
Heart thudding excitedly in his chest, Harry schools his face in a neutral mask and nods. Snape’s eyes narrow further.
”Draco…” Sirius murmurs. ”I know this is hard. Believe me, I know. I’ve been where you are right now and I hate to tell you this, but the time to pick a side—”
managed to get to bed apparently… Sirius smiles wryly to himself. Although he can think of quite a number of things he prefers over being on the receiving end of Lily Potter’s wrath, the memory is still a fond one.
In the next moment, he sees the three Weasley brothers take their own seats further up the aisle, confirming Remus’s suspicion that they’d been the last to arrive. He can see Granger sitting in the same row, presumably Ron’s date for the day. Next to her, Mister and Mrs Weasley are sitting along with an old, grumpy-looking witch.
Harry’s stomach plummets again as he slowly turns his head to see a very ashen-faced Ernie point a trembling finger at him.
”Nothing, just…” Harry squeezes the other boy’s wrist gently. ”I hope he felt like he could run away, that he could go to the other Harry like I told him… I hope he didn’t feel like he had nowhere to go or… that he has to face all this on his own…”
Harry scrambles up to sitting, lighting his wand again and holding it over his head he can just make out Draco’s anxious face from the other bed.
Harry thinks. That’s the only explanation for his behaviour. Because the man is clearly overcompensating. He keeps brewing hot chocolate and baking treats, all of which he supplies Harry with only to quickly disappear into another room again.
Because of the impending arrival of the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, the lesson is cut short by half an hour and Professor Snape instructs them all to leave their cauldrons at the back of the class and put a Stasis Charm on them.
”That’s enough cheek from you for one night, mister Potter”, the girl says with mock sternness and he snickers.
Remembering the dream when he wakes up the next morning, Harry blushes furiously and before he gets out of bed he quickly looks down to make sure there is no evidence of exactly what kind of dreams he’s been having, knowing that his friends will mercilessly take the mick out of him for the rest of the —
— and Harry can’t help but wonder if the other boy’s dreams are somehow plagued by whatever might have happened between him and his father, like Harry’s own traumatic memories are haunting his dreams… that’s all…
” Harry splutters indignantly and their friends snicker around them, but Draco merely narrows his eyes. ”Oh, come on! You were there — you were all there —
The rest of the day passes in a sort of blur, with one boring lesson (Herbology) bleeding into an even more boring one (History of Magic) until the monotony is finally broken up by Double Transfiguration with the strict Professor McGonagall who, like Professor Snape, starts the lesson off by reminding them all that they are now in their OWL year and every lesson leading up to the very difficult examination at the end of the school year, as well as every homework assignment, are all
did nothing wrong after all, but after that nasty business with that house-elf of his as well, let’s just say he took it very hard, very hard indeed — and now he has no-one looking after him either, and like I said, he
Harry feels his mouth go dry as he watches the image of himself wrap its legs around the other boy’s waist eagerly and reaching up behind him to grab onto the armrest, as the blonde head ducks down and begins to kiss its way down the length of his throat, popping the buttons on his shirt open and flicking the material aside as he continues further and further down the smaller boy’s chest.
Fresh tears well up in Harry’s eyes and tumble down his cheeks. He tries to burrow back into his daddy’s chest, but Remus keeps him at arm’s length and fixes him with a stern look.
”You want to dance?” Draco asks innocently behind him and Harry can practically hear the amused smile in his voice.
When Harry walks into the kitchen, Sirius has just finished setting the table and slumps down in his usual seat. Harry joins him and exchanges a surprised look with him, before turning back towards the stove. Remus is hovering by Draco’s shoulder, watching the younger man single-handedly prepare dinner with only a few words of encouragement by the sounds of it.
”Couple of times”, Sirius says. ”Always in a café, because she refused to come to the flat and I refused to come here…”
”No”, Harry gasps and before he’s even aware of what he’s doing, he’s pushes past the blurry blonde blob perched on the side of his bed and stumbled to his feet.
Light spills into his head; time curves around his back, gets tangled up in his legs, arms, he can hear bir sogn; His Daddy is handing him a mug of hot chocolate; the universe bends around him, twists over his head; Sirius opening the
”Harry, go join Remus on the sofa for a sec…” Sirius says, squeezing past him and walking out into the hall.
”There you are…” Sirius sleep-gravelly voice says suddenly and Harry turns around in his seat to see his dad leaning against the doorframe behind him. ”Everything alright?”
”This mirror is the key to finding the Stone”, Quirrell mutters from behind the mirror. ”Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this… But not to worry… I’ll work it out… I have all night…”
”I do wish you would stop doing that…” the older man grumbles, but there is a hint of sparkle in his eyes.
”Well, as good as…” Pansy says flippantly. ”She definitely had tears in her eyes. I thought she was going to snap, she was
Seconds later, Madam Hooch’s whistle rings out and Harry dives towards the ground, flanked by the two burly Beaters. They land in front of Flint who is glaring at the two taller boys, demanding to know what’s going on.
”It would be a shame to just get rid of them though”, Pansy says. ”Some of them might be positive. You never know.”
Painfully aware that he might be stuck in this world for a while, Harry debates with himself whether he should make more of an effort with the Gryffindors. But before he’s made his mind up, the Portrait Hole opens and Ron and Granger climb through it. Harry watches the pair cut across the Common Room to sit down with the others and feels a twinge of longing at seeing their camaraderie with each other.
The noises from the stands, the frantic drone of the commentating voice, the solid wood between his legs, the rough surface of the broom handle pressed between his hands and the swooping sensation in his belly as he flies in a loop and swerves — it’s all just another Quidditch match — and
He makes a nose-dive towards the door and pulls up just before he crashes and lands smoothly on the floor. Ron and Draco both land next to him, their brooms clattering to the floor.
Harry watches Snape disappear into the shadows of the corridor and even after the man has been swallowed up by the darkness, he remains outside the common room, holding his breath and listening to the echoes of the man’s footsteps. He then takes a deep breath and whispers the password. The wall rearranges itself and allows him entrance.
She glares over at one of the sinks and Harry sees a soggy book lying underneath it. He walks over and bends down to pick it up. He can tell it’s a diary, because it’s got a faded date printed on the front —
Three weeks into the school year, after a particularly fun and thrilling DADA lesson where they got to study Kappas — water-dwelling creatures that usually live in ponds and try to strangle anyone they come across with their scaly, webbed hands — Remus once again asks Harry to stay behind at the end of the lesson. They wait for the last students to file out of the classroom and then move into the adjoining office. Remus tells Harry to take a seat and then more or less collapses into his own chair.
Finally, the golden plates on the tables in front of them are magically switched to sparkling clean ones and the murmur in the Great Hall rises to an excited buzz, that dies down instantly as Professor Dumbledore stands up and smiles down at them all, his eyes twinkling more than ever behind his half-moon spectacles.
Riddle pauses with a cold smile, then continues as if Harry never spoke at all, ”Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Salazar himself… But—”
Harry is aware of moving through the night air, the chill of is hitting his face and ruffling his hair and blinks his eyes open. For a moment he thinks he might be flying, but there’s no broomstick between his legs, in fact at first he thinks there’s nothing but darkness,
Granger’s eyes dart all over his face and her eyebrow twitches, but Ron is luckily unaware. Harry ducks his head to hide the blush that is clearly breaking out all over his face, but not quickly enough to miss the knowing smirk Granger sends his way.
Harry is gripped by a overwhelming emotion, it feels like guilt and fear and relief all mixed into one. He knows he should say something to her. But his throat has closed up and no matter how hard he tries, his voice just won’t cooperate.
Harry curls up in his own bed, feeling strangely hollow and heavy at the same time. He presses his eyes shut, but it’s at least an hour before sleep finally takes him.
”I wasn’t scared… exactly…” Harry mumbles awkwardly, looking down at his balled up fists on the table, hidden inside the sleeves of his jumper.
”I have only ever taught a handful of students with such instincts — Harry’s mother, Sybill, I’m not sure you ever had the pleasure — a bit before your time, I daresay — Lily Evans, was one of them. Harry, and only a couple of others of his peers. In fact, that’s a lot for one year, you normally only get one, if that… In Lily’s year there were the two, and that was unusual, unusual indeed —Oh! Severus, speak of the trolls!”
Draco merely looks scandalised at the idea and won’t explain why. Harry glances over at the other table and catches Ron’s eye.
Hanging out with Ron at the Yule Ball had been very relaxed and fun (disasterous consequences with Draco aside) and he’s pretty sure that he would have a great time if he were to hang out with just the twins for an afternoon as well. But Ron and the twins plus Granger and Ginny, all at once. That’s a lot of personalities to interact with.
noncommittally at that, but his defiant frown smoothes out slightly and he proceeds to sip his coffee silently afterwards.
”I’ll see you after the task on Tuesday, okay? Just promise me you’ll stay safe until then”, Remus murmurs passionately as he hugs him.
Harry glances up and catches the furious glint in his daddy’s eyes as he stares down at the words carved into Harry’s hand. Sirius is watching him with a worried, almost frightened look in his eyes. Both of their faces have drained of all colour, but they both remain calm.
He drags his feet over to the dorms and gets his toiletry bag and towel from his trunk and goes to the communal boys’ bathroom to brush his teeth and on his way back again, he makes another beeline for his friends’ little study camp in front of the fire to kiss Draco good night, before crawling into bed.
Finally Remus looks up and meets Harry’s gaze. Smiling a little sadly, he reaches out and strokes Harry over the head.
”Fine…” Harry mutters and lowers his leg again, bending over to stick his face into the flames instead. ”
”We’re not running out of time”, Harry says calmly. ”We have all day tomorrow as well and we’ll be able to be more efficient after a good night’s sleep.”
”I have something to tell you—!” the girl counters, wrenching free from his grasp with a scowl and shoving the parchment in his face again.
They buy lunch in a small almost hidden-away café that Harry didn’t see the name of and Remus finds them a secluded corner booth, and makes sure Harry has the seat with the back to the rest of the room. He smiles gently at Harry when he glances up, meeting his eyes for the first time and blushing for acting like a little child and crying like that, out in public no less… For a brief moment he wonders if the boy from the shop had seen him break down, or he’d seen Remus comfort him, but then decides he doesn’t care. He
”Yeah”, Pansy says, lounging back in her seat. ”You know the one… Harry must be the one to defeat He Who Must Not Be Named… You tell him, Harry—”
”Yeah”, Harry nods. ”All the others were watched and Hermione insisted we make sure Sirius wasn’t in Grimmauld Place before we went to London—”
Next to him, Draco instinctively looks over his shoulder and Harry’s stomach flips over as he finds himself in the crossfire of those familiar grey eyes — silver now as another flash of lightening erupts around them — the other boy’s hair is a darker shade of blonde and plastered to his face, and tendrils of rain water are trailing down the sides of his face, making him glow… The moment only lasts for a second at most, but Harry is still getting his breathing back under control when he joins Seamus on the stairs and Draco has disappeared into the gloom below.
and Draco’s head snaps to the side. He slowly turns it back and touches his bruised cheek with trembling fingers, while glaring furiously at the redhead.
”We’ll be patrolling the edges of the maze”, Professor McGonagall says. ”If you get into trouble and wish to be rescued, shoot up red sparks into the air and one of us will come and get you, do you understand?”
As they reach the shore, Remus wraps big fluffy blankets around both of them, then sits with Harry and rubs his arms furiously until they start to fill up with blood again. Weirdly enough, the stronger the sensation of pins and needles in his arms get, the more violently Harry shakes…
”I’m surprised it hasn’t happened earlier”, Blaise says. ”After everything the Prophet has been writing. Not to mention last year with the Tournament.”
Professor Dumbledore appears behind Professor Snape, but hangs back and watches silently as Snape swoops down on them. His lips are pressed thin and his entire body visibly shaking with anger.
Or is it even longer back than that, maybe when he first discovered the Mirror of Erised and saw his parents for the first time?
”Excellent! Take ten points for Gryffindor! And so, to business…” he bends down and picks up a large cage covered with a baby blue silk scarf. ”Now — be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind… You may very well find yourself facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here — all I ask is that you remain calm…”
It’s all he can think about when morning comes, and he feels like death warmed over when the first light starts streaming through his curtains. Saturday means brunch with Pansy, which means he needs to get up, unlock his Floo and try to look presentable so she doesn’t worry about his already fragile mental health.
But how was he supposed to share thirteen years of longing when neither he nor Sirius were the same people they had been before?
“Henry’s nothing but a little thief,” Pansy said. She glared at the niffler, but her fond tone betrayed her. Henry held his paws together, almost looking sorry. Pansy wasn’t fooled.
What’s sad is he can’t even refute it. He has been lonely, and sad, but that’s not really the point right now.
“Ron and Hermione told me they had a plan to get us together, after Hermione first found you outside the Fat Lady.”
Potter nuzzled into Draco’s neck, “Hermione said you’ve liked me for ages. Said it was why you were always so mean to me.”
Not wanting to waste any more time, Draco moves lower on Harry’s body, giving himself access to the button on Harry’s jeans. He opens it and lowers the zip, revealing Harry’s cock straining against his pants.
Harry turned red, the blush staining his dark cheeks. “Er, no.” He looked at Draco. “You’ve never seen a condom before?”
Eventually, Malfoy started to yawn, his head tilting forward as he struggled to stay awake, and so he finally stood. As he passed behind Harry, and put his hand on Harry’s shoulder, a fleeting, momentary touch before he disappeared up the dormitory stairs.
After what feels like forever, Draco slowly pulls back and regards Harry’s kiss-swollen lips for a minute before speaking. “That was the plan, you daft git. I was being nice to you, so you’d notice me. It was Pansy’s barmy idea.”
The man laughed, clearly surprised, before holding the paper up triumphantly and yelling at his friends.
It was a Friday night party with the other eighth years in their shared common room. Seamus brought the Firewhisky, Pansy brought the Veritaserum.
His eyes were rimmed with red and his clothes rumpled. That wouldn’t have been unusual on someone else, but Malfoy was such a swot — he went to parties in pressed button-downs, never a hair out of place.
They have a cup of tea and she leaves. Draco shakes his head at the smirk on her face as she does — no doubt she’s planning something with the letters, but at least he’s safe for now.
He puts both hands on Harry’s chest, feeling his way across all the skin that was just unveiled, his hands brushing across scars he knows they’ll eventually need to talk about, if this is meant to happen more than once.
Their flat was filled with blankets. Many of them were red and gold, some covered in lions or little snitches.
But after they first kissed, Pansy looked up at the girl sitting in her lap and whispered “fierce, Granger.”
It was before dinner, so he reasoned that if he went to bed now, he would be up before anyone else turned in. And so, if he started to sleepwalk, someone would be in the common room to stop him.
She fixed him with a hard stare. “Don’t pry. Let him come to you when he’s ready. If he’s ready.” Her gaze softened for a moment. “It’s not my story to tell — I am sorry about that.”
Draco did. Looking into those earnest green eyes, it was impossible not to. He knew, in that moment. He trusted Harry, and more than that, he loved him.
“You slept in a cupboard. They barely fed you, barely clothed you. Harry,” Draco forced him to look up, “That’s abuse.”
It’s not rare for him to join them on the weekends, but having him show up this particular weekend is too much of a coincidence to not involve some of Pansy’s meddling.
Hermione sighs and keeps writing her essay; she refuses to be drawn into what she refers to as “Harry’s crazy hypothesis, part two.”
Harry throws back his drink. It still hurts to think about her, walking out of his life. Harry knows something about walking out though. He eyes a shock of blonde hair on the dance floor – hadn’t expected to see him here tonight.
But considering the last couple of years at Hogwarts, he wasn’t sure if he would even get the chance to graduate, or live long enough to have a chance at adult life, so he’ll take what he can get. If he needs to deal with a shitty boss who wants him to fail, he will, and he’ll work to prove them wrong.
“He loved me; I know that. But he was an alcoholic, and he would become violent when he drank,” Draco said. “He never really hit me, but I still get panic attacks whenever someone starts to yell at me, and I can’t drink the fancy whisky he used to love without breaking down.”
Growing up as a Malfoy, he never imagined this would be his life. He expected to be on his way to heading up a Ministry department, if that’s what he wanted; more likely, he’d be working a few hours a day and “investing” the rest of whatever money his parents were giving him to live off.
. There were muffins and fruit, eggs and pastries, and holding it all was a smiling, blushing Harry.
“Malfoy. For the love of all that is good and pure, can you please get out of the goddamn bathtub?” Harry was exhausted, annoyed and so done with uni.
Blaise isn’t sure when his attraction to Theo started. Theo has always just been there; he’s a quiet constant in Blaise’s life, a reliable force of good.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh at the letter. He enjoyed the mystery writer’s sense of humor, their snark and ability to make light of — albeit in an unusual way — serious situations.
Draco hums in response, shifting so he has a view of Harry’s profile. “I’m glad we waited. It wouldn’t have been . . . I don’t think I was ready yet.”
Blaise leaned forward, running his fingers lightly down the pale freckles on Neville’s cheeks. “I grew up. I’ve been able to better myself since the war.
Blaise preferred nights at the club, morning blowjobs and dinners with friends. Black leather jackets, skinny jeans – Blaise wouldn’t be caught dead in something less than stylish.
“Okay, then go back to sleep.” Draco burrowed his nose further into Harry’s neck and Harry could feel Draco’s breath against his skin.
Draco thought it was a result of living with the Durlseys – who never spoke to Harry about anything of importance – then going to Hogwarts, where one friend didn’t need to speak about emotions and the other knew everything Harry was feeling before he did. When they spoke of anything real, Harry preferred to fidget and not look at Draco. It was okay; they were making it work.
“Mate, that could be a whole lot of people. Just about any of the Slytherins, or someone you beat at Quidditch over the years, someone who’s jealous that you’re famous — and that’s assuming it’s a student.”
The three of them might be a strange little family, but with Harry and Teddy, Draco’s happier than he’s ever been.
Two years also means there are new changes to catalogue: there’s a fresh scar through Potter’s eyebrow and the motorcycle he appears to have ridden over on definitely doesn’t look familiar, but Draco would like very much to acquaint himself with it. With everything about Potter.
“I know, but that’s the best way I can describe it. Like whoever wrote it doesn’t want to like me, but they also think I’m a good person.”
It was true, but Draco meant what he said. He was there for the nightmares – the ones where Harry screamed in his sleep, the ones where Ron and Hermione were killed, the ones where Harry woke up clutching his scar, when he wasn’t sure if the war had actually ended. Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s mess of black hair and rubbed circles on his back. He hugged Harry, rocked him, wiped away his tears.
The only word coming to mind as he looks down at Harry, is debauched. There’s sweat forming on Harry’s brow, his black hair is an absolute riot against the pillows, and Draco can feel Harry’s arse clenching around his fingers with every movement.
“I . . . wasn’t, not really.” Draco tries to find the words before he continues. “Blaise is a better friend when benefits aren’t involved —” Pansy nods, she had her own ill-fated relationship with Blaise the following year, “but we were hooking up before things got bad, both at home and at school, and I thought if I could just get him back, maybe everything else would be better.”
“I know you take tea with three sugars and coffee black. I know you’re top of the class only because you work your arse off for it, but I also know that you really care about learning. I know you keep a notebook of sketches hidden in the bottom of your desk, and I know you love curry from the place down the street when you’re feeling homesick, because your mother used to make it for you.”
He shifted, uncomfortable by the inquisition. “That’s not true; I want to know. But I don’t want to ruin it — I like them, ‘Mione, and I don’t want the letters to stop.”
With one hand on the back of Harry’s neck, running fingers though Harry’s hair, Draco pulled his mouth down and kissed him.
Her hair was loud and recognizable, a representation of her and Ron loved it. Ron loved her. She had helped him to find himself, and for that, he would be forever grateful.
And that seemed to break the spell: Harry grabbed him, turned him around and kissed him. It was brilliant, the best kiss of Draco’s life. Harry’s hand came to rest on Draco’s neck as he opened his mouth, allowing Draco in.
Draco couldn’t take it anymore, and finally did what all of his roommates were telling him to do. He went to sleep at a regular time, safe and comfortable in his own bed with his wards set to register movement.
Across the room, swearing while digging through his desk, Draco was coming to a similar conclusion. It seemed Potter had always been a part of his life, in one way or another. Even before they met, he’d grown up hearing stories about The Boy Who Lived.
Harry would go up and sit there at night, hidden under his invisibility cloak. He thought about Dumbledore, trying to reconcile the image he had of the kind old man from his first few years at Hogwarts with the one who was willing to let him die to win a war.
She laughs and gently hits him on the arm, but Draco’s worried — she hasn’t actually said no, and he does not need Blaise and Theo laughing at the overflow of teenage hormones contained on that single sheet of parchment.
So lost in his own thoughts, he failed to notice Parkinson approach — only seeing her as she sat at his table.
“This came today,” he smiles at the girl. “For Lily. I’m okay with it – I am, but I just wanted his help. Please, for her.”
Harry pauses momentarily outside the door, realizing he doesn’t actually have a plan. But in typical-Gryffindor fashion, he barges in anyway.
Harry squeezes Draco’s hand. He knows how lucky he is that they were able to overcome their petty animosity – and even more, that they were then able to start dating.
Someone was in his bed. Someone was breathing on his neck and it wasn’t his bed after all because his bed had a window to the Great Lake on the left, and the person was now moving.
What was surprising was when they opened the door to their room and there was only one bed. One bed. For the two of them.
But maybe it did start, maybe love found the two of them and gave them a beginning, a middle – maybe their end is open and the tree is still growing, branches stretching towards the sky with possibilities.
Draco moaned into his mouth and pulled Harry closer. If this is what happened when he was brave, Draco thought he might be doing it a lot more often.
Draco frowned down at Harry, who was messing with the blanket and studiously not looking at him. He still had trouble dealing with emotional conversations.
That doesn’t mean he can’t glare at Pansy at the same time. An arm curled around Harry’s waist, unconcerned about impeding his ability to cook breakfast, Draco turns to his unwelcome guest.
“I did, for a long time. But he gave me you, so my feelings about him have become much more complicated.” Ron sighed. “It’s not about me though. He’s your father, and you need to go in there and convince the Wizengamot that the Dementor’s Kiss is undeserved. I’ll be here waiting.”
At forty-five, Harry brought out Sirius’ old motorbike and fixed the charms so it could fly again. Oh, what he would give to be young again. He loved his husband, and his children – four, now – but there was something unfulfilled in him. Draco bought him a new leather jacket and watched the kids as the headlight blended in with the stars.
But they’re interrupted before they get the chance. Apparently another letter has found its recipient.
It would be a lie to say Harry didn’t find a bit of joy in waking Draco up — watching him stretch out on the bed, muscles and toned chest on display as the blanket slipped. He scrunched his nose up as he yawned, altogether reminding Harry a bit of a kitten, with a much fouler mouth.
Harry runs and gets the softest blanket from their bedroom, along with Draco’s favorite silk pyjamas and a box of tissues. He stops in the kitchen and quickly makes tea – with lots of honey – and returns to the living room.
Out of all five letters, this is the least surprising, and definitely the least embarrassing. Everyone in Slytherin, and likely in the school, had a crush on Blaise Zabini at one point or another — even Pansy is included within that, so there’s no way she can make fun of him for the recipient.
“Fuck. Off. McLaggen,” Potter growls, grabbing Draco by the wrist and pulling him inside. He slams the door behind them and crowds Draco up against it before mouthing at his neck. “You’re telling me, seven years of fighting at Hogwarts and we could have been doing this instead?”
Ginny was an international Quidditch star, Hermione a lawyer specializing in magical and muggle relations, Harry the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, and Luna a magizoologist.
Draco smirked. “Apparently you aren’t as subtle about our relationship as you thought. Mrs. Weasley sent it over.”
to describe how they felt about the other. Instead, Ron squeezed Blaise’s hand a little tighter whenever he wanted to tell Blaise how much he cared. And when Blaise needed to tell Ron he was glad that Ron was safe, thankful he survived the war, he would wrap his arms around Ron for a little longer.
Harry pulls him toward the queue, and after a few minutes of waiting, one of the employees helps them into a capsule. Harry had pulled some strings to make sure they’d be the only two in their capsule.
Draco wakes to the sound of little feet padding down the hallway. The door to his and Harry’s bedroom creaks open and before he has time to move, there’s a five-year-old wiggling to get under the covers between him and Harry.
Harry’s feeling a bit jittery – he knows he isn’t the most romantic person, but he put in a lot of effort to make today special for their own personal Valentine’s Day.
Draco moaned, leaning into the warmth of Harry’s mouth, and Gordon slithered out of the room to give the couple some privacy.
He slept with three blankets, sometimes four and would rarely leave the flat without a jacket – even in the middle of summer. The one wandless charm Draco had mastered was a warming charm.
It gets caught on Harry’s nose and his glasses and it’s not sexy in the slightest, but it leaves them both smiling at each other, and Draco leans down for a slower kiss, savoring the feeling of Harry’s mouth moving against his.
Hermione straightened, stubbornness flashing in her eyes. “We thought you knew, you idiot! Who else could it be? We thought you had to know, and that you just didn’t want it to be true.”
“I’m sorry!” Draco whisper-yelled, trying not to make any more noise. “I didn’t mean to come into your common room — I swear!”
Draco grabbed the box from the drawer, fascinated by the rubbers. A look of understanding passed over his face as he looked at Harry and then back at the illustration on the box.
Maybe it would become a tumultuous storm, consuming Harry and Draco and leaving them more destroyed than they already were. But maybe it would be what they needed, maybe it would help them to heal.
Lily was beautiful, she was perfect, and she was his. Dudley was going to do his best to raise her right.
They sat like that for hours, their best dress robes on the floor next to them and a new container of ashes on the table downstairs.
Ron looked at him, swallowing a bite of eggs before speaking. “Are you going to open it? Or do you think another love potion got through McGonagall’s defences?” He eyed the letter cautiously, still traumatised by having professed his love for Romilda Vane in sixth year.
“Oh, no. Draco,” she says, pleading. “You wrote a love letter to Cormac McLaggen? Not only is he a Gryffindor, but . . .” She trails off, wrinkling her pug-shaped nose in disgust.
Hermione told her to stop using it – to save the word for when she truly meant it. Pansy huffed and walked away, but she listened. She started saying “lit” instead, telling Hermione it’s “what the cool kids say.”
“Who is – oh,” Harry enters the doorway, placing a hand on Draco’s lower back. He faltered for just a moment before recovering. “Dudley, well, come on in then.”
Then, as the sun rose on a new day, Remus pulled himself together. He was the last Marauder left. And there was a war to win.
“I wouldn’t care. I swear to Merlin, Neville, I love your sense of humour, the way you hum when you work. I love how compassionate you are, how much you care about your friends.
Harry was eager to comply, opening the package quickly and rolling it on. Tonight was turning out better than he had hoped.
Ron shrugged. “Dare, I suppose.” He could feel the whisky weighing down his tongue, through the Veritaserum made him speak.
Remus didn’t bother to knock; Sirius knew he was there, had invited him in by allowing the house to reveal itself.
They’re both sitting on the edges of their respective beds, neither wanting to take the final step of actually reaching out.
Harry nodded. “I know.” He took a sip of the tea – now cold – sitting in front of him and threw back the pill.
“I only pulled away because,” Draco took a deep breath. “I pulled away because I knew it meant something to me, and I wasn’t sure it would to you.”
Ginny was actually the one who told Harry that Malfoy was upstairs; while she and Malfoy had never gotten along, she seemed worried when she came to find Harry.
He knew Harry; he knew how Harry took his drinks in the evening and his coffee in the morning, knew how to calm Harry down and how to rile him up.
, Harry couldn’t stop his tears from flowing, spilling down his face. He was thinking of Remus, of Sirius, of all that could-have-been with the Marauders in his life.
“Granger’s found me, twice!” They were sitting in a corner of the common room, and Draco had put up a privacy spell for good measure. “I don’t know how to stop, you have to help me.”
Pansy calls it hiding; Draco calls it staying safe. On days he’s honest with himself, he knows it’s a little bit of both.
Potter had to audacity to laugh. “Merlin, Draco, I don’t hate you. And there’s no good reason you should want to be in my bed, yet here you are. Stay, please?”
He then pauses, mere centimeters away. Harry can feel Malfoy’s heart beat against his own. “I’m going to kiss you.”
Merlin, his smile could light up the room. Towards the end though, he had stopped smiling at Draco; he was sullen, withdrawn. They fought all the time.
Harry went to bed first, leaving his guests downstairs to finish the movie. Ginny and Luna left next (Ron didn’t want to think about what his baby sister was doing), then Hermione and Pansy, Theo, Neville, Blaise, and eventually, it was just him and Draco on the couch.
He examined the material more closely, and his laughter ceased. “This looks – Draco, did you sew this?”
Harry nodded, pulling Draco down on the bed next to him, both sitting with their backs against the wall.
Grey eyes stared into green, and it took Harry a moment to regain his senses. It seemed to take Malfoy a moment too, and when Harry tried to move, Malfoy was still on top of him, looking down.
But now Harry is back at Hogwarts, and while the others are as well, the eighth year dorms aren’t separated by house. So instead of sharing with Ron, Harry has Draco as a roommate.
Almost every night, the two of them would meet at the astronomy tower by unspoken agreement. More often than not, they would sit in silence, Harry’s invisibility cloak spread as a blanket over their tangled legs.
Draco was a bundle of nerves for the rest of the week, getting as little sleep as he could get away with and jumping at the slightest sound. The nightmares were worse than ever, each one depicting a different way the Dark Lord could have won the war, and therefore a different way Potter would have died.
Harry carefully extricated himself from the sheets and from his guest, in order to make a pot of coffee, some medicine for the hangover Draco would surely be suffering from and a glass of water — just as he had prepared after Hannah’s party.
When they pull apart– minutes or hours later, Blaise can’t tell – the tears have dried on Theo’s face and he’s smiling.
He’s been in this dingy Muggle flat for almost two years now, ever since the war, when Lucius ended up in Azkaban and Narcissa fucked off to France. He could have gone with her — after all, the Ministry seized the Manor for reparations and Draco can’t walk down any wizarding neighborhood in England without half a dozen death threats being hurled his way.
Hermione and Ron were coming, of course, as well as Blaise, Ginny, and Draco. Entirely due to Luna and Pansy’s influence, Harry and Draco were finally on a first-name basis. And once Blaise and Ginny had gotten together, he and Draco were the only single ones left, leading them to spend quite a bit of time together – and allowing for some feelings to develop, though Harry was sure they were unrequited.
He had started sleepwalking when the Dark Lord had come to the Manor. Night after night, Draco would wake up outside, curled up in a blanket by the big oak tress overlooking the pond on the property. He assumed it was his fear of the Dark Lord, and his fear of the others — he still saw Bellatrix’s face when he closed his eyes — that drove him to do it. The fear penetrated his sleep and he assumed that was why he kept leaving in the night.
When the chicks were all but ready to fledge, their small wings lined with brown fuzz, the inevitable happened. His cousin Dudley followed him, and seeing the nest, gleefully thrust his hand inside the foliage. The fledgelings spilled out, half hopping, half flying. Mrs Red-Breast looked on in dismay from a nearby perch, a grub dangling from her beak. They scattered about their feet, and Dudley instantly set about trying to capture one. Harry shouted at him to stop, but Dudley had never listened to him before and didn’t see fit to start just then.
are scratched into his memory like initials on a tree trunk. Harry hopes they’ll never get tired of saying yes to each other.
“I was effectively a muggle for three years, Potter. Muggles don’t have house elves.” His voice is impatient, but still mild. Clearly their truce is still in effect.
And it’s true. He might not have thought it in so many words, but he’s envied him in one way or another since he met him. Envied him for his comfort in a world which was once so unfamiliar to Harry. For a mother who sent him chocolates every Friday morning. For knowing his impossible and intricate family tree all the way back to its roots, and all the history and tradition that comes with it. For his freedom. The freedom that comes with knowing who he is, and who he wants to be.
“Hermione, I love you. You’re my beautiful, genius, phemom- phenonimal-” Ron mouths the word to himself for a moment, but still can’t figure it out. He shrugs. “But you don’t understand; Harry
Not to be outdone, Harry tugs Draco’s shirt the rest of the way off, and pulls him back on top of him. They let their bodies take the lead from there, pushing and pulling in time, until they can only gasp into each other’s mouths. Noise keeps escaping on his every outward breath, and suddenly his fingernails are digging into Draco’s shoulders as Harry comes. Draco’s eyes are half-lidded as he mumbles sweet nonsense into Harry’s neck. He runs his fingers through Draco’s hair until he finally stills as well.
He spreads his hands expansively, determined not to show his distress. “Well then Weasel, ask away.”
“Look at you,” he coos, as if Harry was a milk-drunk kitten. “I could do anything to you and you’d probably thank me. You’d probably beg for it.”
. His large hands move up from his thighs to pin Harry’s hips to the bed, and he sucks him in again. Harry doesn’t know why, maybe it’s just too much too fast or maybe he’s just broken, but it starts to happen again. He starts to slip away. His eyes don’t move from where they’re fastened to the ceiling, the fleur de lis patten shifting in and out of focus. A sharp sensation brings him forcefully back. How long has it been? Terran already has three fingers inside of him, lying over him on the bed with Harry’s right nipple in his mouth. Harry jumps.
Harry gestures for him to lead the way, and Malfoy complies. Rain starts drumming down on their backs just as they reach the front doors. They’re made of dark wood, intricately carved with magical creatures, but there’s a deep gouge running from the left handle up to the top of the door.
Harry doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to Draco apologising. A unicorn is probably born each time it happens.
Harry groans. “If you keep asking who it is I’ll give you the gory details, and then you’ll be sorry.”
“Yes, really, but I do have two conditions,” he says. “One: you can’t ask about the actual sex. That stays between Potter and me. Two: you can’t tell him what I say under compulsion. That stays between you and me.”
“Don’t worry about it,” he says. He has no idea how he’d tell Ron he’s dreaming about his former nemesis every night, or even that they’re sort of friends now.
Draco pinches the bridge of his nose. “This isn’t the time for that argument, so I’m going to leave that for now. “He scrubs a hand over his face. “Can you tell me what happened?”
He doesn’t say anything else, doesn’t make any verbal jabs or jokes like he might have if they were alone. What he does do is run his foot from the inside of Harry’s ankle and up his leg, in clear retaliation. Harry thinks he would have preferred a stinging hex; pain would be easier to hide than his squeak of panicked arousal.
He doesn’t ask how Harry knows that. Probably, he doesn’t want to give Harry the opportunity to show off. And Harry finds he wants to show off a little bit. Well, maybe that’s the wrong choice of words. Part of Harry wants to impress him. He’s going to be repairing his childhood home, and he wants to prove he knows what he’s doing. Just imagining Malfoy refusing to work with him sets his teeth on edge, and an imperceptible thrill ringing in his blood.
“You should have someone other than me to talk to about this stuff, another sub perhaps. Not everyone who’s coming is into kink, but quite a few are. I can introduce you to some people.”
He climbs into her living room and plonks himself down on her squashy sofa. He grabs a red cushion that reminds him of the Gryffindor common room and holds it tightly to his chest. “Either I’m losing my mind, or I want to kiss- Someone I never thought I would want to kiss.”
Harry grabs onto the hand resting over his own and pulls Terran from his chair and up the stairs. The room he once shared with Ron is almost as transformed as the kitchen. The two twin beds have been replaced with a fourposter, reminiscent of his Hogwarts bed but doubled in size. Instead of the riot of red and gold that reigned in their old dorm room, there’s a dark and soothing palette of midnight blue and pearlescent grey. Terran backs him into the bedpost, nose brushing down his cheek and neck until he reaches Harry’s collarbone, where he places a careful kiss.
There’s no greeting or signature. He knows Harry knows who sent it. Biting his lip, Harry rereads it.
He’s sat on their sofa, his head resting on Hermione’s shoulder, while Ron pontificates on the virtues of the Chudley Cannon’s new seeker. He’s had two glasses of wine and is working on his third, and the others aren’t far behind. They’re loose, laughing, and Harry’s never felt more miserable.
. Of course, he wasn’t expecting to see Malfoy, so he hadn’t considered it. He wanted to take his mind off it, and it had clearly been effective, because he hadn’t remotely seen this coming. And why did he choose to wait until now to bring it up, if he had this arrow in his quiver? Clearly, he was right in thinking that Arthur’s presence shielded him from most of his animosity.
When Draco comes, he kisses Potter like this is the first time they’ve ever touched. Like Draco hasn’t been inside of him for almost two hours. Then Potter opens his mouth and turns the kiss into something else. He finally slips out, but he hardly notices.
Draco keeps licking, sucking, wriggling his tongue inside. Harry writhes, anchored in place by the rope that’s keeping him stretched out, on display. Fingers join his tongue, and Draco tortures him with them until he’s wet and loose, tears welling in the corners of his eyes. Every now and then he removes his mouth to talk to Harry, to tell him how good he’s being, how sweet he tastes. Harry’s making noise almost constantly now, though nothing that could be considered words.
Weasley punches him in the mouth, knocking his head backwards. Pain ricochets through his teeth, his jaw, his skull.
“Good boy,” he says, taking his hands away and reaching for his abandoned book, still balancing on the wide arm of the chair. “Now, this is why I told you to be quiet. I’m going to read my book, and you’re going to stay still, and silent, so I can concentrate.”
Abruptly, Draco sits up, and taps his wand against the ropes binding Harry’s wrists. They unravel, and Draco massages along Harry’s arms and shoulders before he brings them down, stopping them from cramping. Rubbing a thumb over the red marks, he inspects Harry’s wrists. Satisfied, he flicks his wand and summons two glasses that come zooming in from the kitchen. He fills them with a careless
Draco furrows his brow, and Harry finishes making the tea. He sits down and watches as Draco’s hand hovers over the milk jug and sugar bowl, before adding copious amounts of both. Finally, Draco speaks. “I’ve thought about it, you know. Doing it for a living. But if we’re being realistic, no one’s going to want to hire me.”
“And sometimes… I just go somewhere else. I leave my body for a bit and I don’t know what’s happening around me. It’s hard to let my guard down, after everything, but I don’t want to be making all the decisions either,” he adds.
He takes one hand from where it’s holding him up to grab hold of Draco’s hair from behind. It’s damp with sweat, but still so soft between his fingers. He turns his head, and pulls Draco into a messy kiss. They’re both breathing hard, so they mostly just pant against each other’s mouths, letting their lips brush with every thrust that brings them closer together.
As Harry walks Earl up Diagon Alley, he thinks about Malfoy. No one could say they’re the best of friends, but he certainly doesn’t hate him anymore. He’d testified on their behalf at Malfoy and Narcissa’s trial, but it’s possible there’s still some resentment there. After all, he hadn’t vouched for Lucius. Perhaps Malfoy blamed Harry for his father’s imprisonment? Either way, a direct approach to helping him would probably not go over well. How do you help someone without seeing them? Maybe he could write a letter.
. Only Harry is speechless. The racket doesn’t stop even as they descend on the table, Arthur looking a little alarmed.
Sorry for the wait, but at least this is a chapter I know some of you have been wanting for a while. I'm not entirely happy with it, but if I waited for it to be perfect it would never get published.
Draco starts absentmindedly snapping off a squares of chocolate, but doesn’t eat them. “I can’t switch it off.”
He gives the dog a pat on the head in goodbye, and makes his way to the door. Draco trails after him, picking up the bell from where it’s rolled across the room and placing it back on the hook. It’s a little dented now. They shuffle into the cool air of the street, and Harry turns the key in the lock. His hand shakes.
Harry rushes home. He runs for five minutes before he remembers he’s a wizard and apparates. He arrives on his doorstep still out of breath, and tries to comb his dishevelled hair with his fingers. Yesterday he’d given Draco a key, so he could let himself in if he arrived while Harry was still at Granny’s shop. Harry unlocks his door, remembering the shocked look on Draco’s face as he’d handed him the key, trying not to give away what he was thinking. What Harry had wished it meant.
Harry kisses him artlessly, soft and open. Draco makes a noise of surprise, before twisting his fingers into his hair and tugging. He can feel the last traces of Draco’s lip gloss, sticky, as if it wants to hold their mouths together. Harry kisses down his jaw, his neck. He’s unpracticed, guileless, and completely blind to the rest of the room. But not deaf. Samuel’s voice cuts through the haze.
On Thursday, Terran breaks up with him. It’s date night again, and Terran is talking, but Harry can’t really hear him. He just catches snatches of platitudes and excuses. They’re going on a break, or at least that’s what he says. Reading between the lines, Terran doesn’t want to be with him if sex is off the table. Harry knows that its over.
Draco leans forward. “They released two different versions of the film, and in one of them he does actually bite it off.”
They begin to unravel, but far too slowly. To his surprise, Draco joins his spell to hers, releasing the woman. Harry remembers what Granny had told him upstairs in her room, about struggling with spells. He wonders what she and Draco had talked about. Two green-robed Healers enter. A plump, stately looking older woman, and an anxious faced girl- probably a trainee given the white bands on the cuffs.
All three of them had been offered a place in Auror training and all three had declined. It was someone else’s turn to hunt dark wizards. Harry was going to walk a dog.
, Harry is just about to say by ways of explanation, but the bell ringing interrupts him and he just shakes his head instead.
Lockhart’s head pops up from behind the stage again, his wavy blonde hair now standing on end, his hat nowhere to be seen. Another laugh bubbles up in Harry and he has to press his fist against his mouth to keep it in.
Harry’s head shoots up to stare at the other boy, even as his hand goes through with the movement of slapping the note away from his essay. It goes skidding across the grass and Seamus nods after it.
He can’t help but notice that she’s very careful not to get any blood on her many rings when she grips his hand, but as soon as their hands touch, Harry’s thoughts are immediately distracted by a searing pain — not in his hand, but the scar on his forehead — and he gasps and snatches his hand back again, stumbling to his feet.
”Why didn’t you get the first carriage?” Blaise complains next to them and Harry laughs, finally letting go of Draco to give the other slytherin boy a quick hug as well. ”No, seriously, why are we standing next to the
”Your dad and I decided not to tell you before, because we didn’t want you to worry. So instead we told you that I had to travel for work…”
Both men clap their hands and Sirius slings an arm around Harry to hug him close to his side. Harry beams up at him happily, although without his glasses on Sirius is only a blurry blob, but there’s still no mistaking the brilliant glint of his teeth as he grins back.
Harry takes a quick, deep breath to steel himself and pushes the door open. The office looks just like it’s always looked, with weird contraptions placed on various surfaces and the walls lined with sleeping portraits of former headmasters and headmistresses.
”Come on, let’s go make some breakfast”, Remus says, his voice still perfectly neutral, but Harry flinches anyway.
”A mandrake leaf”, Harry says and leans into Draco again. ”It’s the first step towards becoming an animagus!”
He kicks the the duvet away and sits up, rubbing his eyes and reaching for his glasses on the bedside table. The room slowly comes into focus around him. The sky outside the window is a pale blue with streaks of gold announcing the sunrise. Harry peels his pyjamas off and stands up, arching his back and stretching a little from side to side, his muscles sore from another long night of tossing and turning.
”Well, you can stay here”, Harry says, instinctively inching closer to the other boy and grabbing a hold of his hand as expecting him to just disappear any minute. ”Right, dads? Draco can stay here?”
Harry hangs back and makes sure to take a seat at the back of the classroom. His friends look between him and the front, clearly torn. He slams his book bag down on the desk and stares back at them all stubbornly. They exchange subtle looks, but join him without a word.
But first, he has to venture out into the rain for Care of Magical Creatures… the only silver-lining being that at least the oaf Hagrid isn’t taking the lesson and putting them all in danger, rather when they reach the paddock next to Hagrid’s old hut, Professor Grubbly-Plank is waiting for them next to a trestle table with what at first glance looks like a small pile of sticks, but at a closer look turns out to be —
”No…” she says, still pacing in front of him. ”Not unless you can answer my riddle… Answer correctly on your first guess and I will let you pass. Answer wrongly, I will attack. Remain silent, and you may walk away unscathed.”
”They’re also very playful and social animals”, Remus says lightly, as if commenting on the weather. ”They tend to be territorial and cunning, as well… again, very Slytherin…”
Harry means to fight against the hug, but his body acts of its own accord and eagerly burrows into the embrace. Remus sighs and his voice shakes a little when he says, ”I’m sorry I stopped you from facing the Boggart. I didn’t think it would be very wise to introduce Lord Voldemort to those who have been fortunate enough not to have made his acquaintance yet…”
Harry thinks and stifles a sigh, but he doesn’t say anything because the truth is he’s missed Draco so much all summer that he doesn’t even care anymore.
It’s even worse than Harry remembers. The sickly sweet perfume rising from the fire is potent enough to give him a dull headache, but not strong enough to completely mask the earthy scent of mildew and dust.
Feeling slightly reassures by this reaction — after all, if what’s inside seemed at all dangerous, surely the girl’s reaction would have been a terrified scream rather than the noise you make when you step in something nasty — Harry starts approaching the crates as well and leaning forward, he peers inside the nearest one.
When the blonde finally sits back, once again revealing both boys’ bulging crotches, and leers down at the smaller boy and reaching for his belt, Harry gives the drawing another hurried tap with his wand and fumbles with the picture frame in his hurry to hide it in his bedside drawer along with all the other Christmas gifts non-suitable for dads.
unfriendly spells… Let’s have a volunteer pair”, he adds quickly after a hopeful glance in Snape’s direction was met with a venomous sneer. ”Longbottom and Weasley, how about you?”
”Oh yes”, Draco says haughtily as they’re walking back towards the castle. ”That’s exactly what I need right now, never mind revising for our final exams and make sure I actually pass and get to come back for Second Year, what I
” he says, narrowing his eyes at the teenager for a second, but then a thought occurs to him and he sags a little, turning away. ”
Grabbing Harry with one hand and Draco with the other, Remus quickly ushers them into the safety behind another bookshelf, before he jumps in and positions himself between the two fighting men, holding each at an arm’s length and yelling at them both to pull themselves together.
Harry wheels around to see what’s startled his dad and then instantly jumps back himself. With his heart thumping in fright, he stares at the beast harnessed to the nearest carriage. If hard-pressed, Harry guesses he’d have to call it a horse, or at least a horse-like creature, but something about the head reminds him of a dragon as well… it’s sleek black coat is stretched across the skeletal body, showing every single bone of the creature’s skeleton and from its back a couple of gigantic, leathery wings protrude.
Harry nods, ”But we’ve looked through almost every book in the library and we can’t find anything on him…”
Draco looks away and resumes dusting the mantlepiece, his fingers handling the photo frames gently and carefully, but he nods.
It’s still raining quite heavily when they get outside and they start to jog side by side. When they get to the end of the High Street, and the thatched roof of Creirwy’s Hollow can be seen at the end of the smaller road up ahead, they sprint the rest of the way, lauging slightly.
… Then one of them grows a pair of blurry arms and seems to be holding them up in a placating manner. Harry can barely hear the murmured voice over his own pounding heart, but he would recognise that gentle barritone anywhere…
As soon as the door of the classroom opens, the Gryffindors hurry inside and fight over the seats at the front of the class, while Harry and the rest of the Slytherins hang back, more than happy to claims the tables at the back of the classroom.
Colin fumbles with his camera for a moment and Harry can feel pearls of sweat breaking out on his face. Finally the boy manages to take a picture, the flash going off and nearly blinding Harry who flinches. Lockhart finally releases him, but instead of walking away as Harry would have hoped, he takes a seat next to him.
After they’ve listened to the Christmas Concert on the wireless and Harry has begun to doze off in-between his dads on the sofa, Remus gently shakes him awake. Sirius hugs him good night and wishes him happy christmas for a final time, then Remus guides him to his bedroom and tucks him in.
”It’s the only way”, Draco says. ”If the Queen takes Ron, they you can take the King and it’s check mate.”
”… and with that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around as well — no, poor man’s having a well-earned, quiet Christmas. I’m just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place!”
”Okay, look over there…” Ron says, jerking his chin in Umbridge’s direction with a malicious half-grin.
Even though Harry tells himself sternly that nothing happened between Draco and the other Harry and that it's clearly paranoid of him to think it did, as he lies staring out into the darkness, unable to fall asleep, his heart keeps pounding:
the two empty halves fall apart. The hair-raising wail immediately rings out in the silence of the dorm and Harry’s very skull seems to vibrate from the onslaught. Gritting his teeth, he stares in determination at the hollow centre of the egg and tries to think…
”Hey yourself”, Draco whispers back and Harry can almost hear the smirk in his voice. ”Did I wake you? I just wanted to say good night properly…”
about duelling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin”, Lockhart continues. ”Now, I don’t want you youngsters to worry! You’ll still have your Potions Master when I’m through with him, never fear!”
Harry’s dads are waiting to greet them just inside the door, Sirius shaking hands with Draco while Harry hugs Remus. But when they switch, Remus darts forward and envelops Draco in a hug instead of shaking his hand. The blonde stands rigidly in the embrace, but if Remus thinks the reaction is odd he doesn’t show it, he just pulls back again and claps the blonde on the back, smiling at him kindly.
”You’ll need to see Madam Pomfrey before the judges give out your score”, he says in a flat voice and nodding towards Harry’s bleeding shoulder.
Draco looks like he rather finish his porridge than call a grown-up he barely knows by their first name, but dutifully mumbles an
”I thought his affections were directed elsewhere”, Remus continues, his smile twitching a little in amusement and his eyes getting a wistful, almost sad sheen. ”In fact, I was convinced of it… All throughout first and second year and well into our third—”
Heart pounding furiously in his chest and blood rushing to his head, Harry hears a thumping noise in his ears and tears his eyes away from the wound on the back of his hand, that’s already started to heal over again, and looks up to meet the woman’s eyes that blink at him in feigned innocence.
The hunger that’s been steadily making itself known since his shower, is finally reaching undeniable proportions around lunch time and he’s debating with himself whether he should go and check out the kitchens, maybe see if Dobby works there in this world as well and get himself some pie or something, when the bed hangings are suddenly pulled aside to reveal one stony-faced Draco Malfoy staring down at him.
Suddenly Draco’s hand slips out of his and he’s clutching empty night air; he stumbles as he turns and falls over…
and lets go of his spoon. It clatters into his porridge bowl and a few drops of milk hits Harry in the face. He grimaces and wipes them away, but doesn’t say anything about it.
It’s during their last lesson if the day, Herbology, while pruning a Abyssinian Shrivelfig, that Harry notices several very large spiders scuttling across the lawn outside, heading in a line towards the Forbidden Forest. He pokes Draco in the arm and points them out, but the blonde just frowns and shrugs.
”Lily sacrificed herself to save me, that’s all I know”, he says and a gleam in Riddle’s eyes tells him that makes more sense to him than it ever did to Harry. ”You know what, I don’t really feel like talking anymore.”
They all touch down on the ground and Harry shakes hands with Mr Nott and Mrs Finnigan just as Remus reappears leading Mrs Blaise out into the garden and Harry walks over to shake her hand as well before she Side-Along Disapparates with Blaise.
He’s walking along the cool, dark corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries with long, quick strides… The door swings open at his touch, letting him into the circular room lined with doors and blue-flamed candles and his heart leaps…
He pulls the pillow out from under his head and puts it on top of it instead, muffling some of the churning of the waves outside the window and whatever expletive his friend fires back at him.
He swallows thickly and puts his wand back on the bedside table, trying to think… But his head feels oddly empty and light, like someone has taken out his brain for maintenance without alerting him.
A blurry outline of a person is sitting at his bedside. For a second Harry thinks it might be Dumbledore, but no… The colours are all wrong, he realises. This person has got shorter, slightly darker hair and no beard and in fact his whole frame seems to be lither, not to mention less colourful.
The next two nights are the best of Harry’s entire summer. The Dreamless Sleep works just as effectively and immediately as he remembers from the first time he took it, and it’s such a relief to feel sleep tugging on him and knowing it’s okay to give in, because the graveyard isn’t waiting for him, that he could almost cry.
”Come on then, Mr Creevy”, Lockhart says and beams at Colin. ”A double portrait, can’t say fairer than that, and then we’ll
”And then Hagrid let slip that whatever Fluffy is guarding is between Dumbledore and someone called Nicholas Flamel…”
”Pansy mentioned some spell, but don’t worry”, Harry says quickly. ”It was just like a pepper up potion, the rest was just… firewhiskey and atmosphere… we just got a bit carried away, that’s all. It’s not a crime to have fun once in a while, Granger.”
”Sir, I swear, I’ve never seen that before”, Harry mumbles, stumbling slightly on the spot. ”I’ve told you, I’ve dreamt about that door, but it’s never opened before, ever…”
In the corner opposite the fireplace stands a gramophone on a rickety table, emitting strings of mandolin melodies over a cheerful man’s voice singing about snow and palm trees.
The blonde’s head snaps up and his widened eyes flicker between Harry’s own. Harry swallows thickly, then forces a small smile onto his face. The frown on Draco’s face deepens, but some of the tension drains out of his shoulders again, so at least Harry knows he won’t bolt any time soon.
Oliver Wood almost crash lands in his hurry to get to her and protest, but the old witch ignores him and continues addressing the crowd, telling all the students to head to their Common Rooms where their respective Heads of Houses will give them further information.
”You can put those books away”, Moody growls and takes his seat behind the teacher’s desk, his good eye staring down at the register while the magical one flits all over the classroom, seemingly taking note of every single detail and committing every student’s face to memory as he moves down the list of names.
Harry opens his eyes again and squints at the doorway where his dad is lounging against the frame with a teasing grin on his face.
It’s only natural. But…” he leans in to murmur conspiratorially, ”A word to the wise, Harry… You need to calm down a bit, all right? Yes, yes, I know what you’re thinking, ’It’s alright for him, he’s an internationally famous wizard already!’ but
”My mother…” he murmurs, a small frown appearing between his brows as though he can quite understand why he’s speaking. ”She saved me. She knew she was dying, so she persuaded my father to save me as a last favour to her. He loved her. So he agreed. They came to visit me and gave me a draught of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my mother’s hairs. She took a draught of Polyjuice containing one of mine. Thus we took on each other’s appearance and I walked out, while she stayed.”
”It’s okay, it’s okay, I’m fine”, Sirius says quickly, but lets the man inspect the hand for himself and turning his steady gaze on Harry. ”What happened?”
”Damn it…” he mutters, glaring at the wall clock as he places both their coffee cups in the sink to wash up later. ”Remus never would have forgotten lunch… aren’t you hungry?” he adds almost accusatory to Harry, who shrugs.
Draco gives him a sheepish look. Swallowing hard, Harry inches closer to the other boy gingerly, giving him plenty of time to recoil should he want to…
”Oh what…” Blaise huffs. ”Like you’ve never blackmailed anyone! Anyway, lucky for you I did, because now you know what the first task is so you can prepare—”
”Come now, why the long faces?” Lockhart exclaims, beaming at them all from the front of the class. ”Don’t you people realise the danger has passed! The culprit has been taken away!”
Lockhart stops his long rant immediately, and Filch’s breath hitches as he wrenches his face out of his hands and stares up at the Headmaster.
He cries himself to sleep and wakes up with a dense, heavy feeling in his head… Groaning, he stretches out onto his back and rubs his eyes and squints out into room.
Draco’s cheeks flush a dark pink and he glares at his feet, but stands perfectly still as the medi-witch casts another spell on him.
”At the start of the year, I got into a bit of a… thing… with To- ehm — with — with Professor Umbridge, the new Defence teacher…”
Harry feels himself hyperventilating and forces his breathing to slow down. Focus. Focus. Find out what’s happened.
”Mr Potter”, Umbridge says, all traces of sweetness gone from her voice. ”As High Inquisitor I have the right to supervise any and all official meetings between the teachers and the students of this school—”
charm, then a muffled clatter as he puts his wand down on Harry’s bedside table before pulling the hangings closed again with a soft whoosh.
”I think whoever killed Mr Crouch is the same person who put my name in the Goblet of Fire… it’s just too much of a coincidence, think about it… plus Crouch mentioned me when he was rambling, he said something about the Dark Lord getting stronger and then he said my name…”
or something to that affect. This is the first time his dad is writing to him directly. It makes Harry stomach clench with worry and he quickly scans the letter, expecting some kind of bad news about his daddy being ill, or —
He feels his eyelids grow heavier and heavier, and struggles to stubbornly keep them open. But Remus fingers dragging through his hair is oddly hypnotic.
Sliding the oak door open just a crack, Harry slithers inside as quietly and carefully as he can manage and is just about to unfold the Marauder’s map when the muffled but unmistakable sound of approaching footsteps reaches him.
”Harry”, Sirius says and squeezes his shoulder. ”You be good and listen to your daddy today, okay? If he says you can’t go somewhere, even if Draco and his parents are going, then you don’t go, understood?”
Draco and Blaise exchange a quick look, then turn their heads towards him and blink innocently. Harry scowls and jabs Draco in the side. He immediately squirms away, smirking.
When they were standing side by side in the boys bathroom and brushing their teeth earlier, he’d tried to convince the blonde to talk about the meeting with Dumbledore, but just like the night before Draco had avoided both the question and Harry’s eyes.
Sighing, Harry reaches for the fork and stabs at the scrambled eggs sourly, but only ends up rearranging them on the plate. The action reminds him of Draco and he feels a tightness in his chest again.
”You’re dead, Potter…” Draco hisses and he’s standing so close to Harry that he can feel the warm gust of his breath as it hits him in the face.
He doesn’t really remember much about what happened in the dream, because it wasn’t as detailed or vivid as his nightmares usually are, but he’d been walking along a darkened corridor that finished in a dead end and then he’d been left staring at a locked door… and that’s all he could remember when he woke up.
”You did very well in all your O.W.L.s, very well indeed…” the Head of House mumbles, looking down the list of results and then hands Draco his timetable without any corrections. ”Well done.”
Suddenly, something happens that has never happened before… A student puts up their hand. Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289 stutters to a stop and blinks in amazement, as if he’s just now noticed that there are actual students in the room in front of him.
”Now aren’t you glad you have such a thoughtful boyfriend that woke you up early…?” the blurry blob says and although Harry can’t
as an impartial bystander — and I am aware that my expressing any thoughts on this very personal matter is veering into the realms of improprierty…
like her…” Riddle’s eyes glint and he raises an eyebrow. ”Well, she wasn’t wrong, was she…” he drawls and his gaze flickers back to where Draco is hiding for a split second.
Harry feels like someone has just doused him in ice water. It’s obvious to him that his daddy is only regurgitating what Dumbledore has told him to say — which means that he really
”Oh give it a rest, I’m fine”, Draco huffs and leans back in his seat again. ”Haven’t you seen how scared they look now? They’re not going to try anything again, at least not for a while… I think they lost their nerve when they nearly got caught.”
”Are you insane?” he hisses, trying to wrestle the bottles from the shorter boy, who stubbornly hugs them to hus chest and dodges his flailing arms. ”The adults are right in the next room — Harry’s dads will kill us —
”Harry… Can you tell me, what is the last thing you remember, before waking up in the Hospital Wing?”
Remus hearty strides stutter momentarily and Harry follows his wary gaze to the shop front of Ollivander’s and feels his stomach churn unpleasantly at the
They make their way outside and amble down towards the lake shore and Harry tells the older man everything that he and Granger talked about. Lupin looks anything but surprised and nods in agreement.
”Guess who got offered the head as a birthday gift?” Draco says drily, then adding quickly. ”I said I didn’t want it.”
”Lovely…” she simpers, then turns to the quill now poised above the parchment. ”Testing… my name is Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter.”
”I knew he’d pick you over me”, Draco says when he and Harry are walking back to the castle. ”You’re an amazing flier…”
to take someone Draco would perceive as a threat”, Blaise adds in a conspiratorial undertone. ”If you should want to, you know,
As he suspected, not a lot of explaining is required in the end. Sirius surprises them both by welcoming them home to a finished dinner and takes one look at Harry carrying the kitten in one hand and the owl cage in the other and immediately turns to look at his husband with an exasperated look.
Harry feels around for his glasses and finds them under his pillow. When he’s got them on, the serious face of Remus Lupin comes into focus and Harry’s heart stutters.
Somewhat true to his word, the blonde reappears within five minutes. Having been stood sharing an uncomfortably comfortable silence with Pansy Parkinson in a dimly lit passageway for the duration, Harry is too eager to get going to really pay any attention to the blonde’s new outfit, but simply leads the way back out into the dungeon corridors and across the castle.
Everyone turns to stare at the large lake where the smooth, black surface suddenly begins move as though boiling; large bubbles rise to the surface and great big waves lap at the shore as a massive whirlpool is formed in the middle of the lake… What appears to be a black pole emerges from the eye of the whirlpool and continues to rise steadily, but then Harry sees the rigging and realises it’s a ship’s mast and sure enough… Within moments, a whole ship has risen out of the heart of the lake and lies bobbing for a few seconds in the still turbulent water, before it starts to move towards the shore.
”Yours, Professor Dumbledore?” Umbridge says coldly, then lets out a small, icy tinkle of laughter. ”I’m afraid you do not understand the situation. I have here —” she pulls a parchment scroll from within her robes and holds it up with an air of triumph, her buldging eyes gleaming. ”— an Order of Dismissal signed by myself and the Minister for Magic. Under the terms of Educational Decree Number Twenty-Three, the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts has the power to inspect, place upon probation and sack any teacher she — that is to say, I — feel is not performing to the standards required by the Ministry of Magic. I have that Sybil Trelawney is not up to scratch. I have dismissed her.”
Storming back into the dorm, Harry walks right past an anxious-looking Draco and throws the Nimbus on top of his bed.
From the middle of a dome-shaped web, yet another spider appears, twice as big as the biggest ones in the group and Harry gapes in horror.
”No not really. He just lets me in. Then I close the door behind me when I leave and it locks automatically… I’m sure there are rules against entertaining students in your private teacher’s quarters after hours. He’s probably bending them just by letting me use the lab… I know the Slug Club is basically that, but at least that’s organised and approved beforehand. It’s not like being alone with one student in the middle of the night.”
Harry waits for Draco to choose a pouffe for himself next to Pansy and then deliberately chooses an armchair on the other end of the room. He imagines he can feel the blonde’s eyes on him but forces himself to keep staring ahead.
Harry huffs and stands still, his fists shoved into his pockets. He refuses to meet his daddy’s eyes, horrified to feel his own eyes fill with tears.
Harry hurries forward and opens the gate to the paddock so that Hagrid can carry Draco out and then run up to the castle with him. Everyone exchange panicked looks and then quickly hurry out of the paddock as well.
Even though he genuinely doesn’t think he did anything to deserve the detentions, just being in this office and sitting in this chair, with his Head of House literally towering over him, Harry can’t help but feel the weight of guilt from all the other times he’s been in here, in trouble…
Leading the blonde by the hand through the small crowd, Harry’s insides are a flurry of happy movement. Letting Draco do most of the talking, Harry is barely even aware of Fleur or the Weasleys’ until Mrs Weasley envelops him in a massive bear hug that smells of lavender and cake icing.
to the Gryffindor — even if that would be a lie, Harry would never expect the blonde to outright admit that Ron gets under his skin — yet here he is now, admitting it.
He could go flying by himself, of course. But he rather not risk his and Draco’s tiff turn into a proper argument.
”I heard you”, Harry counters glumly. ”So Umbitch’s plan to catch Granger’s DADA group got thwarted. Big deal—”
”Yes, Sir”, Harry says gruffly, annoyed that this keeps coming up, as if it’s any of his Headmaster’s business who he’s in a relationship with.
The family make their way through the station quickly, Harry glancing around curiously and noticing the attention they’re receiving from the muggles around them, but not really caring. Like with Diagon Alley, Harry has only heard stories about King’s Cross but has never actually been until just now. It’s a little smaller than he’d imagined, and a lot dirtier. But he likes it anyway.
”Oh, he won’t mind, look at her, she’s adorable! He’ll love her, you’ll see! Look, she loves me already — look —”
”Poor boy, doesn’t know what he’s saying!” Lockhart says loudly to the other Slytherins as they begin to crowd around them. ”Not to worry, Harry! I’m about to fix your arm!”
”Murder”, Malfoy says flatly, still wiping errant tears from his cheeks and sniffling miserably. ”Harry or Dumbledore, I don’t know. Maybe both.”
Harry felt his mouth drop open like they were in a horrible comedy. He couldn’t help but mentally run through every letter he’d received, the phrases and the conversations, trying to find some clue that he had missed. How could he not have seen it?
The Fat Lady huffed at this, while Draco, realizing he was still sitting on the ground, hastily stood up.
Draco’s solution was to stop sleeping entirely. He realized quickly that this was not a smart decision, but he didn’t feel like he had any other options, and therefore stuck with it.
Harry always knows when Draco’s getting sick. It starts with him snoring lightly at night as his nose becomes stuffy – a fact Draco vehemently denies. Then he adds copious amounts of honey to his tea, though he refuses to admit it’s to help with a sore throat.
Steam fills the kitchen. Wooden cabinets line the walls and copper pots and pans hang from hooks, gleaming in the shifting light. Over the years it’s gotten to look more and more like the kitchen in The Burrow, full of noise and activity, something always moving. But then, it’s Molly who showed him how comforting a kitchen can be, so it’s not surprising he’s modelled it after hers. One of the cabinets gives him a warning creak, alerting Harry the second before strong arms wrap around him from behind. He still jumps.
“Oh, the kinky bit?” says Zabini innocently. “Well, with all that pent-up tension between them I can’t really imagine them making sweet, tender love, can you?”
He fetches a pen and paper, and sits down at his kitchen table, studying Malfoy’s letter. “What do I even say? He has a point.”
The owl knocked with his beak again, and it was then that Harry saw the letter tied to its leg. Overcome with curiosity, Harry undid the latch and let him in, putting fear of his aunt aside and resolving to cross that bridge when he came to it. The bird hopped onto the seat next to him and stuck out his leg, clearly meaning for Harry to take the letter. He did as he was bid, and nearly dropped the envelope in shock when he saw his own name written there in green ink.
“That’s it,” he says, stroking Harry’s skin with his cock, and scraping his teeth behind Harry’s ear. “Are you sure you’re alright? We can leave it there if you want to.”
Dudley brandished his prize. “He had a letter, Mama. He says it’s his, but no one would ever write to a poor and dirty orphan like Harry.”
Harry sighs, half annoyed and half amused. “You might want to read this,” he says, holding the letter out so Narcissa could see.
Draco rumbles a laugh that he can feel against his back. “That’s not exactly hard, Potter. You only have to draw terrible hair, a speccy face, and a scar on your forehead, and it’s the spitting image.”
Why not? Did he still feel indebted to Harry? There was the business of him saving him in the room of requirement, and stepping in at his trial. But Harry had almost killed Draco before, and he’d refused to identify him to Bellatrix at the Manor. As far as he’s concerned, they’re even.
The room explodes into laughter. Ron wipes a tear from his eye as he says “Good one, dad. Who is it really?”
. There was a favourite hiding spot of his, a window seat shielded by a red curtain, where he liked to sit and read. He would sit there with the book spread across his tucked-up legs, staring alternately at the illustrations and out of the window. There was very little wildlife to be seen in gravel paths bracketed with regimented hedging. Occasionally a sparrow or a blackbird would come exploring, looking for food, but all left disappointed.
Luna smiles, and stands. “I’ll leave you to catch up. I have a feeling this seat will be needed soon, given that swarm of nargles at the bar.”
Yes, and Potter’s a night owl, but he already knew that. He watched Granger badger him over breakfast from across the great hall for six years, and he never once looked fully awake.
As if by magic, the fledgelings seemed to grow in size. One moment they were small enough to hold in a child’s pudgy fist, and the next they were the size of a crow, and then an eagle. Dudley screamed. Realising they were now big enough to defend themselves, they turned their beaks on the boy. Harry’s cousin ran squealing back to the house, and the young birds rose into the air, threatening to give chase. Instead, they lowered back to the ground, and shrunk back to their original size.
He shakes his head, not even looking back at Harry. “I’m not going to wait forever, and neither is anyone else.” He doesn’t even bother buttoning up his shirt before he strides over to the door, glancing back only to say: “Get your shit together, Harry.”
“I drank the tea so the fortune is mine, but whoever empties the cup is the person who should read them, as the symbols depend on them to be understood.” Granny takes the cup from where he’s gripping the delicate handle and tilts her head to study it. “That is certainly the Grim, but just as Death in Tarot is often misinterpreted, these things are rarely as bad as they seem. What’s important is what the symbol means to you.”
He washes up on a beach. The sand is so yellow it hurts. Two identical children with glowing eyes play together in the sand. Harry begins to sink, the sand swallowing him, and a one of the children screams. It is impossibly hot, and dark, and a deafening sound surrounds him. The vibration of it echoes through his bones. Purring. Harry clamps his hands over his ears, and screws his eyes shut. Lights begin to fill the room, reflecting again from Draco’s hair. Harry reaches out to touch it, but Draco grabs his hand, and uses it to pull him closer. Their foreheads rest together, and Draco’s skin feels cool on Harry’s temple.
“Why?” he breathes. “I still don’t even get why you offered to help me in the first place. Why do you want to do this with me when you could go back to that leather bar and find someone who knows what they’re doing? Someone you never hated and never hated you?”
Harry climbs through the attic, hearing the low murmur of conversation between Draco and the portrait. The circular door is only open a crack, pale light spilling through. Opening the door, he sees Draco bent over a piece of machinery he’s opened, a magnifying glass giving him one enormous eye. Isla’s portrait says something Harry doesn’t catch through the roaring in his ears, and Draco’s face cracks into a smile.
Draco Malfoy is opening a centre to educate wizardkind about muggle life with Arthur Weasley. Life could not be stranger. Or so he thinks, until Arthur addresses him again.
Harry hums noncommittally. “Are you going to leave while I change, or are you just going to sit there and watch?”
Draco swings his legs out of bed and places his feet on the cold floor. He pulls on a shirt but doesn’t bother buttoning it, letting it hang off his shoulders. He pads back over to the desk and picks up the paper. He means to just skim through until he finds Pansy’s piece, something about a new boutique opening in Diagon, but something catches his eye.
Harry leans back in the chair and closes his eyes. He can’t find it in himself to be surprised that she knows about them. “Draco’s on the ground, and he can’t move. I’m holding his hand, and in my other hand is the pocket watch from the waiting room, except I think its broken.”
The baby threatens to cry, and Malfoy joins him in looking over the crib. The soft hitching breath turns into a happy babble at the sight of his face.
“Why?” asks Draco, his eye catching on where the dressing gown is falling open slightly, revealing Harry’s nipple.
Harry hits his chest with the back of his hand. “You know that’s not true, you’re just trying to wind me up.”
Draco shrugs. Pansy’s the only one of his old gang he really reconnected with. But then, they’d always been joined at the hip. He tried to push her away, along with everyone else, but she refused to let him. She’s a stubborn bint, and Draco adores her for it. Pansy’s been slogging her way up the
He must be feeling so empty. Getting fucked again will probably just make it worse later, but then again, if he falls asleep right after he won’t notice the discomfort. Besides, the salve will stop it from becoming painful. If it’s what he needs, and what Draco wants, then what’s the harm? Still, Draco’s not sure.
Draco chuckles under his breath. “We’ll explore that kink later.” The warm water slicks the space between his thighs, runs over his sensitive dick. Draco moves faster, holds him tighter. “Lord, you feel so good. You’re being so good, staying so still and so tight, so patient.”
“You told me about your happy memory, of your mum singing to you. I don’t know why I thought of it, maybe because using this record player makes me feel connected to my own parents, but I asked your mum to sing the lullaby to me. Then I put the memory into the record.”
He furrows his brows, and casts his mind back to his years at Hogwarts. “I thought only poltergeists could move things.”
“It’s fascinating,” says Draco, already walking inside. “My family has always been so rigid, so obsessed with appearances, and yet our wards are completely mad. The Blacks have always been unhinged, and yet these are some of the most cohesive and well-structured wards I’ve ever seen.” He looks back at Harry, eyes alight in a way he hasn’t seen in years. “Don’t touch anything unless I say it’s safe. Better yet, just don’t touch anything.”
He’s met with a long silence, and he turns round worriedly to face Draco. Draco must have been staring at the back of his head, because now their eyes meet. His features are frozen, but a small smile creeps over his face, seemingly against his will.
Draco groans into his collarbone. “You’re going to be the death of me, Potter. I thought you would be, years ago, but now I’m certain.”
They nod. “Then I’ve got just the girl for you.” They swoop away into the maze of shelves and cages, and return with an owl riding on their shoulder. She’s large, with feathers in as many shades of brown as a tree in autumn, and deep orange eyes. She would be a very elegant looking bird, if it weren’t for the ridiculous looking tufts on her head. They stick up like a rabbit’s ears, giving her a permanent air of surprise.
“No,” says Draco, calmly but firmly. “Don’t touch unless I tell you to. Put your hands behind your back, that will make it easier to remember.”
and hands one to Harry. Harry shuffles upright so he can drink, rucking up the very top of the sheets with his heels. They’d been kicked off almost entirely during their vigorous…activities. Draco cleans them up while Harry drinks deeply, slowly coming back down to earth.
Potter nods in agreement, and Draco summons into his hand the bottle of water he’s left on the coffee table for this exact purpose. Draco gives him the bottle, but his hands are shaking too much to open it, so he takes the bottle back. Twisting off the lid, Draco cradles the back of his head and holds it to his lips. He doesn’t tilt it too far, keeping control of the flow of water, making sure Potter doesn’t drink too fast and make himself sick.
Harry sets it to one side, and continues shuffling. He’s not sure when it’s supposed to be finished, the book said he was supposed to just feel it, but he doesn’t. Now is as a good a time as any, so he lays the deck face down on the table. It’s a specific question, and he’s not ready to try a full spread, so he uses a trick Granny has shown him. He draws every card, pausing just long enough to glance over them, until he finds The Lovers. Once he does, the illustrated couple moving to kiss each other, he takes the card before it and the card after. He lays them out in front of him. The Star, and The Ace of Cups. The card he dropped was Death.
His hand is resting on his leg, and centimetre by centimetre, Harry moves his little finger to brush against Draco’s own. Letting the chatter wash over him, Draco forces himself to stay calm, furiously trying not to pin all his hopes to one little touch.
They’re sat together cross-legged on the patterned rug in front of the living room fire. Warmth always helped Harry when he was learning to cast a Patronus. Draco gathers himself, sits up straighter, and casts. A soft bluish-silver cloud begins to pour from his wand, before it stutters, and quickly dies.
“You’re the one trying to argue, I just wanted to know why I’d been summoned to a pub at two in the afternoon. And when I came out of the goodness of my heart, to make sure you weren’t having
He hears Harry’s breath hitch, and wonders if he’s remembering the same thing Draco is. If he’s thinking of the way Draco fingered him open, torturously slow, in a kitchen much like this one.
“My own blend,” says Granny, holding the jar up to the light. “Lavender to induce sleep, catmint to stimulate dreams, mugwort to enhance their prophetic qualities, and rosemary flowers to help you remember it. I’ve been perfecting the recipe for years.”
His eyes drift down to the curve of Potter’s mouth, just as the pink of tip of his tongue pokes out to wet them. Draco rushes forwards and kisses Potter with a lack of finesse that would embarrass him if he wasn’t so lost in the softness of those lips. The bottom one, in particular, vexes him like nothing else. He nips and sucks and nibbles on it, wanting to turn it red, wanting to make it
Instead of relaxing, as initially hoped, Draco passes a restless evening. He locks his Floo and turns out the lights; if Charlie’s rejection has already come from Romania, the rest must be on their way.
Draco groans again, letting his head fall back on the table. “Out, out! Both of you meddlesome, good-for-nothing friends, I want you out of my flat by the time I open my eyes.”
And from then, Draco stopped sleepwalking. (He also stopped sleeping in his own bed, but that’s beside the point.) The nightmares didn’t stop, but Draco was there to comfort Harry, and Harry was always there to wake Draco up and reassure him that the war was done, and Harry was alive.
In the morning, the bed is empty and Draco hears laughter ringing out from the kitchen. When he gets there, he stops in the doorway for a moment, admiring the sight that greets him.
The day he came home to his wife saying “I’m pregnant” was simultaneously the most exciting and terrifying day of Dudley’s life. But there was one thing he knew for certain: He would be a better parent than his own.
It almost felt like a test — like if Harry couldn’t find Draco, he didn’t deserve to see him. Harry paused for a moment. His next thought was the owlery; Harry knew he personally had grown fond of the owl they typically sent back and forth, and figured Draco had too, but then it hit.
. She planned to show Luna and they could bond over how cute it was, but now she actually needed help. Pansy liked sparkly jewelry and shiny accessories, and the damn animal was stealing everything.
“And that’s also not true — I cared before that and I’ve continued to care. You just make it so damn hard.”
“Why do you like me? I mean,” Neville took a deep breath. “Why do you like me now? We went to school together for seven years before this and you wouldn’t even look at me.”
They started work in a small classroom. Harry felt it strange to be back, for the final battle to be over and for them to return to where they stood, all those years ago. Still, it was routine work; they cast spells to repair damage and checked for dark objects.
In the common room that afternoon, Draco couldn’t keep his eyes open, even thinking about the mystery of who sent the parchment note.
Harry clutched the letter and he felt a smile break out on his face. He wanted to see Draco, more than just about anything.
“He, wait, he does live here?” The man gives Draco a once over. Draco stands tall and glares back at him. “I, uh,” He glances at the child. “Well, he’s my cousin.”
“No, Draco, that doesn’t. You’re allowed to have complicated feelings about your father — he abused you, but he still raised you.” Harry tried to control his own emotions, tried not to focus on the abuse he had suffered growing up.
Everything they had worked so hard to accomplish was done, but the wizarding community was left with so much sadness. There was so much grieving to be done, so much rebuilding.
On the third day with no sleep, he had bags under his eyes and could barely stay awake to focus during class.
That’s part of it, Harry knows. When he was hit by the killing curse for the second time and given the opportunity to choose death, he considered it.
“As I was saying,” Harry started again, speaking over Hermione. “We were writing each other last night and it reminded me of something that Sirius said. We’ve all made mistakes; many of us have done unspeakable things. But sometimes we need to be reminded that we’re still
Blaise thought he had lost it completely, and Pansy kept shooting him worried looks. She was still the only one who knew about his previous sleepwalking around the Manor, and the only one who knew it was happening again.
Luna sighed. “Oh, they must have. But the front desk is closed, and I know they’re booked solid, so can you two make it work?”
He couldn’t believe it: Sleepwalking to the Gryffindor common room. It was lucky Filch hadn’t caught him, as Draco knew he would have been given detention for sure. It wouldn’t have mattered that he was an eighth year, or unconscious, as Filch was even stricter since the war.
“Sorry! Sorry,” Malfoy said, finally realising their positions and slowing standing. “Why am I not surprised it’s you, running through the halls with disregard?”
“Bloody hell,” Harry muttered, under his breath. It’s not that he hadn’t seen Malfoy in his pants before — they did share a room, after all — but it was usually more compulsory than, well, seductive.
Needing to be kept busy, Ron got started. He worked with George in the shop, volunteered to help put Hogwarts back together from the rubble it had become, signed on with the Aurors to stop corruption in the Ministry and worked to catch the remaining Death Eaters.
Harry grabbed his own copy and glanced down, only to be met with a family photo of the Malfoys. It was a few years old, before the war and before the dark circles were permanently etched beneath Draco’s eyes.
“Love, honestly, it’s okay.” He grabbed Draco’s hand and pulled him back onto the blankets. “I promise, I’m not going to be the next Dark Lord, now please come back to bed.”
Instead of ignoring him, pretending their eyes hadn’t met across the room, Harry made his way over and said hello. He didn’t sit, didn’t stay, but he acknowledged the other man’s presence.
Things start to get interesting when he overhears Malfoy talking to Parkinson as they walk to Herbology. Harry has a free period, so he isn’t worried about being late to any of his own classes.
The years were going by so quickly, Hermione thought as she brushed her black hair, which now had strands of grey intermixed.
As Draco made it back to his bed, he wondered how much more humiliating this whole experience would become.
“Oh, Merlin, I’m dating the next Dark Lord, my mother’s going to kill me, that snake is going to eat me; Potter, where the hell are my pants?”
“There’s this muggle thing I’ve wanted to do since it opened – it’s supposed to be quite romantic – and then I have dinner reservations for us.”
, before turning and entering the courtroom. He had a fight to win, and this time he wasn’t taking the coward’s way out.
Harry usually has nightmares about losing Remus or Fred. He sees them fall, over and over, again and again, when he closes his eyes at night. At their worst, the nightmares take those from him that Harry knows are safe – he loses Hermione, isn’t fast enough to save Ron.
And the next time Harry was at the Weasleys, he greeted Molly with an extra tight hug. His family accepted him, and that meant more to him than he could express in words.
Draco understood. The anniversary of the battle was coming up, and media requests for Harry were increasing. People wanted him to give speeches, talk about those who had been killed and how the Ministry and the wizarding world had rebuilt since.
Which, honestly, fair enough. Harry trusts muggle technology and machinery, but Draco grew up surrounded by wizards and all things magical. The London Eye must look terrifying: a big metal circle meant to suspend people in smaller metal cages.
“Can I ask though, why you did it – why you put in that much effort? I mean – nevermind, I know you hated me.”
She smiled, though it didn’t fully reach her eyes. “Okay, Harry. Just don’t be afraid if you find that’s not enough.”
But that’s where the similarities between them would end; Harry would make sure of that. As Teddy cooed up at him, Harry promised himself that Teddy would grow up surrounded by family and friends who loved him, who supported him. He would grow up knowing who his parents were and what they had given their lives for.
His old school chest is open on the ground beside her, and she has a small stack of colored envelopes grasped in her hands, the top one opened with the letter unfolded, her eyes moving back and forth across the page as she reads something Draco never intended to have see the light of day.
“I’m fine, honestly. And I’m not a child, I’m perfectly capable of getting back to my dorm.” Draco thought he’d actually prefer to bash his head against a wall and
It all came to a head though when Malfoy got back to the dorm at three in the morning, sloshed and sobbing, and climbed into Harry’s bed.
One butterbeer turned into countless beers and drinks over the course of weeks and months and maybe even years.
Harry turned to look back at his friends, incredulous. “You knew?” he asked, disbelief showing through in his voice. “You knew they were from
Remus didn’t cry during his monthly transformations, no, the pain was a reminder that he was still alive, that he could still feel something. He didn’t cry the first time he met Harry – an almost perfect copy of the thirteen-year-old James that Remus remembered.
When he pulled back, Neville couldn’t help but laugh. “I took you to look at plants on our second date.”
And Granger was one of the few people he was on decent terms with this year, as she’d accepted his apology after the trials last summer. Things had been less than horrible — almost, dare he say, friendly — between the two of them since.
As it it heard them talking, there was a sharp peck at the window as an owl announced itself. With a glance at Harry and Ron, Hermione opened the window and let it inside.
He was worried about him; he missed him. And he felt like they had so much to talk about — he needed to know what Draco was thinking.
He thought for a moment, then continued. “You also embarrassed Dean and Seamus in the Great Hall last week — how did you not know they were dating? — and spilled pumpkin juice all over Pansy Parkinson.”
Harry shook his head. “Giving it a name – calling what happened to me something so serious – makes it feel too real.”
Harry nods, his green eyes locked on Draco’s, and Draco reaches down and grabs Harry’s cock, only giving it a few tugs before Harry comes.
She takes Harry by the hand and leads him to Draco, who’s moaning pitifully with his forehead resting on the desk.
When Harry wakes tonight though, he’s grateful knowing the blonde is merely a few feet away. Because tonight, Harry dreamed of the Room of Hidden Things and the Fiendfyre. Dreamed of Draco, reaching out to grab onto Harry, but everything was hot and they were sweating and their hands missed. Harry missed.
Harry suddenly felt wise at fifty, felt like he could give advice and people would actually listen to it. He found himself talking about how fast life was going; his beard was more grey than black. His love gained weight around the middle and always wore jumpers around the house.
Losing her was like losing spring. Draco had taken her for granted, always, and being without her was incomprehensible. The rain was here, but it wasn’t bringing any flowers.
After climbing into bed, he couldn’t fall asleep. He was hyper-aware of every movement Draco made next to him. It was no better once Draco had fallen asleep, because he quickly rolled over and grabbed what was closest to him: in this case, Harry.
Ron liked homemade sweaters and loud family gatherings, playing Quidditch and warm cups of tea in the evening.
They parted, slowly, space created from nothing and Number Twelve was revealed in the middle, slightly dilapidated and yet as intimidating as ever. Remus stared at the house, taking in the sight of it before moving forward, forcing one foot in front of the other as he made his way.
Somehow, he managed to get Malfoy — who was still clutching his now-empty cup, through the neighbourhoods and back onto campus. Malfoy was being no help; his hands kept slipping under Harry’s jumper, and his breath was hot against Harry’s neck.
Draco slid slowly out of the bed, missing the warmth of the covers as soon as he was standing. He looked down at Potter for a second, noting how young and soft he looked when he was sleeping, then bolted for the door.
Theo moves his hand to Blaise’s face and brings him down for another kiss, and this time, their lips meet and part, and it’s more beautiful than Blaise ever imagined.
Draco shrugged. “I don’t let people in because I’m scared they’ll leave. I don’t like people knowing things about me.”
Potter slid over Draco, straddling him on the bed. He started talking, each word punctuated with a kiss to Draco’s face.
Thank you all so much for the lovely comments; I had so much fun writing this story and reading what people thought of each chapter.
So far there’s no ill effects – beyond the fact that he and Potter can’t be more than five feet apart without intense pain.
Harry loses them as they enter the greenhouses, but he has a lot to think about. What could Malfoy possibly be up to?
That evening, Draco was trying to stay awake best he could. He was studying for Herbology, alone in the common room. But he was so incredibly tired, and his textbook was really quite boring.
Harry finally brought their mouths together, slowly, as if they had all the time in the world. He kissed Draco lightly, slowly deepening the kiss until Draco felt Harry’s tongue nudge against his lips. He opened his mouth as an answer, and from there it was like spells colliding, shooting light into the darkness.
Maybe it started with a touch, the brush of Malfoy’s fingertips against Harry’s wrist when he finally did stay at the bar, in the corner, both nursing a butterbeer as Harry’s friends waited on the other side of the room.
Harry nodded, and took the advice, making it to breakfast with just enough time to eat before the food was cleared.
The invisibility cloak and Harry’s suspicions are forgotten as they move towards Draco’s bed, losing layers of clothes as they go.
“This is good! It’s a rejection only because he has no interest in dating anyone — but he says you should grab coffee together when he’s next in London.”
“Draco, he didn’t know what that spell did. I’m not saying he should have used it, but saying that he was
Pansy went into the Forbidden Forest and brought Luna a rare plant, and all Luna did was tell her it was poisonous to hold. Pansy’s hands were red for a week.
Even if he had to be at this stupid party, he would much rather be downstairs, hanging out with his friends, than dealing with an extremely drunk Malfoy sitting in Hannah Abbott’s bathtub. It’s not like they were even friends; no, the fates had conspired and stuck them together in the dorms for the second year in a row. He had tried to talk with the resident director, but she just gave him a slow smile and shook her head. “The pairings are final, Mr Potter. I’m afraid you and Mr Malfoy will have to learn to get along.”
Draco wakes to the sound of whistling coming from the kitchen. As he stretches, he finds he’s sore in all the best ways, and he quickly pulls on boxers and a t-shirt before going to find Harry, hoping he can entice him into a repeat performance from yesterday.
Draco woke to the sound of voices and knew immediately that he wasn’t in his bed. For one, the ground was too hard, and two, Granger was standing over him. And she actually looked worried.
She nods, conceding his point. “You’re right, I know. I forget Draco is even more stubborn than you. Just take him home, please.”
Hermione looked around the flat, remembering when she first moved in. It was just after Hogwarts, when she was hired at the Ministry and trying to break out on her own.
“Yes, I like how you look now; I’d be lying if I said I didn’t. But that doesn’t mean I won’t love you if you gain the weight back.”
He wasn’t worried, not really — Malfoy was an adult who could take care of himself, but Harry couldn’t help but think of the last time he drank this much. It was last year, around the same time; he came back to their dorm every night for a week drunk and stumbling, words slurring as he cursed the world.
His mood sours slightly as he exits his room and finds Harry to not be alone in the kitchen, as he also spies Pansy sitting at the table. It’s hard to stay upset though when he can see faint bruises peeking out from the loose collar of Harry’s shirt, and even harder when Harry shoots him a quiet smile, eyes crinkling at the corners.
Everyone was over at Grimmauld Place to watch a movie, as they did every Saturday evening. Ron was exhausted from Auror training – they didn’t get a break, even though it was the weekend.
Draco flicks his wand and catches a bottle of wine. It’s Friday evening, and he wants to sit on the couch and listen to the wireless until it’s late enough that it’s socially acceptable to go to bed.
Maybe it started when Malfoy’s owl swept in through Harry’s open window, landing on his bed and pecking him awake.
Hermione and Ron shared a look and a quick kiss before getting off the couch and heading to their respective rooms.
They began to travel together, Luna showing him wrackspurts and the best places to find nifflers. They would return to the places they were staying covered in mud and grime, and Ron was happier than he had ever been.
There was a dent in the wall from when she moved the table in, a hole in her favourite couch from when she took care of Harry’s crup that she had never gotten around to repairing.
“Yes, you have. Hermione knew after seeing the handwriting — if she can recognise that, then I guarantee you could have too. I’m not sure when Ron put it together, only that he did it ages ago.” Blaise took a breath. “You’re scared to care about him, and that’s okay. But he’s going to need a friend, and for some reason, he’s chosen you to reach out to.”
But Draco realized that last night, lying on the cold floor outside the Gryffindor common room, he hadn’t had a nightmare. It was the first time since returning to school.
And in the winter, it was all the little things they hadn’t yet had time for. Today, Harry, Ron and Hermione were tasked with cleaning the right-hand side of the third-floor corridor.
Resigning himself to his fate, Draco opened his eyes, glaring at Granger above him. She stood with her hands on her hips, bushy hair untamed.
And then, to distract him further, an origami bird landed on his desk. Draco opened it to reveal the note, “The Fat Lady is using the password ‘purple pixies.’ Up the stairs, first room on the right.” He didn’t recognize the handwriting and when he glanced around, no one was looking his way.
“Hmm.” It takes a second before recognition lights up in Blaise’s eyes. “McLaggen! Can’t say I see it; I actually thought you were better than that. Did you fall for him before or after he puked on Snape’s shoes?”
Harry woke, a warm weight against his back. He rolled over to see Draco sprawled across his bed, legs intertwined with Harry’s own.
Because it was beautiful. Harry had never been happier, and though he didn’t say it often, Harry knew Draco felt the same.
And so he nodded. Barely perceptible. He was turned away from Harry, but he felt the boy rise and come to stand behind him. He felt Harry raise his hand, almost touching Draco’s back.
“Fingers,” Draco says, the answer instantaneous. He wants to prep Harry, to feel his body in all the intimate ways he can.
Later, thinking over Hermione’s words, Harry feared there was some truth to it. He hadn’t asked himself why he wasn’t trying to figure out who the person was; hadn’t forced himself to think it though. Maybe he was worried he wouldn’t like what he found.
Harry’s new haircut? Fierce. (Though that may have been a bit sarcastic – his hair was as untamable as ever.)
The male redhead groaned and the girl started laughing. Well, at least Draco could provide them with some entertainment.
“Nope,” Malfoy said, taking extra care to pop the “p” before hiccupping and clutching his half-full Solo cup closer to his chest.
He looked up in shock at her prim tone. “Yes?” His voice was wary, not that Hermione could blame him. She wasn’t here for a fight though.
“You can’t promise that.” Theo wipes his tears away with his sleeve. “Blaise, my father wants me to take the Mark.”
Throughout the following week, Malfoy’s side of the room remained empty more often than it was occupied. Starting the night of the party, Harry barely saw his roommate. Malfoy would return at odd hours — often stumbling in at two or three in the morning and gone before Harry woke. They shared one class, and Malfoy missed two of the three that week.
Harry makes his way to the kitchen, where Draco’s stirring spoonful after spoonful of honey into his tea. He glares at Harry. “Don’t say a word.”
“There shouldn’t even be a rejection in the first place,” Draco says, exasperated. He avoids emotional situations, yet here Pansy is, stressing him out two Saturdays in a row. “The letters were never supposed to be sent!”
”I just mean that if Draco’s father has told him he can’t spend time with you and he actually really wants to, it might be easier for him to keep his resolve and stay away from you if you’re angry with him, so he pushes you away…”
Phineas Nigellus Black continues to peer out at Harry however, his dark beady eyes glittering with interest.
”I’ve alerted Poppy”, he says in his silkiest voice. ”And Professor Dumbledore is waiting with the High Inquisitor in the Headmaster’s Office, but he assures you that there is no hurry…”
At the sound of their approaching footsteps, Mr Roberts turns around and squints at them. Lucius stops abruptly, and Harry can see his black gloved hand tighten on the silver top of his walking stick before he suddenly turns around and hisses to his wife, ”Will you deal with the muggle?”
He’s not even sure what he’s asking. Is he asking him to stay for the day, the night, forever? He’d know what he’d like, but it’s not his place to ask for that.
Malfoy’s face sobers. He looks down at his fidgeting hands, long fingers twisting through each other like the muggle children’s game.
Harry whines, and lets his bottom teeth graze ever so slightly under the head in a way he knows drives Draco mad. He looks up at his boyfriend shaking apart above him but still sounding so coaxing, so loving, and grips himself tighter.
“Do you want another drink?” he asks, already rising from the table. “This is too strange to get through sober.”
For someone who doesn’t want to talk to him, he’s doing rather a lot of it. Then again, if his friends aren’t talking to him, he might just be lonely. Until sixth year, Harry had very rarely saw him alone. If he wasn’t surrounded by a crowd of simpering Slytherins he was flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. Harry grimaces, thinking of Crabbe and his fiery end. It feels odd to think of Goyle without Crabbe, like George without Fred. They’re both alone now, and Draco is too.
Draco shakes his head in despair. “It’s a good job I don’t have anything else to do before tonight, as I’ll need all that time to make myself presentable again. Look at me, I’m a mess!”
Malfoy takes him at his word. Harry’s nails scratch lines into the table as he pushes in, so slow Harry thinks he might have gone again after all and time has become distorted. But no, he can’t have done, because Malfoy’s breathing faster than ever into his ear. He bottoms out, and pauses for a second, before laying his hands over Harry’s on the table. Somehow, Harry understands what he’s asking. He laces their fingers together, proving he’s still there. Malfoy sighs, and pulls out, before thrusting back in with a smooth stroke that drags a moan from Harry.
A crease appears between Malfoy’s fine eyebrows, and he nods slowly. “May I see?” Andromeda hands him the duck, and he turns it over in his hands, before bringing it up to his eye. “What does this do?” he asks, pointing to the switch.
Granny Lynn had given him the day off to study the books she’d lent him, and he had them spread over the kitchen table, swapping between them as he felt like it. He’d never been a methodical studier, not like Hermione, he simply follows his train of thought as it leads across the pages and diagrams. Yesterday, Draco had said he would come today to do more work on the wards. That didn’t look likely now.
Those are Harry’s two favourite words. In fact they might be the only words he knows. He nods, and Draco leans back to pull at the hem of Harry’s t-shirt. The afternoon light shows Draco’s chest in excruciating detail, highlighting the thin white lines that scratch into his torso like claw marks. Harry grab’s his wrists to stop him.
“Did you know that during the war, Lupin came to visit me at Grimmauld Place?” Draco looked surprised, but just shook his head, so Harry carried on. “Yeah, Tonks was pregnant with Teddy and he ran off to tell me that he was going to join us and help kill Voldemort. There was a fight, a bad fight, and he admitted that he was scared. He was scared that Teddy’s life would be worse because of him.”
Harry bristled. He may have been penniless and an orphan, but he knew he kept clean better than Dudley did.
He collects Earl for his walk, trying to make enough noise to let Granny know he’s taking him, but not so much as to disturb what sounds like an intense appointment. The bell is loud as ever when he swings he door open to step outside, and while it muffles the sound of the shutter, nothing can hide the camera flash. Herbert lowers his camera, grins maniacally, and disapparates before Harry can make good on his earlier threats.
Draco shuffles down the bed, pulling the other man with him. He tugs the covers over them both, tangling their legs together.
Harry laughs, understanding Draco’s inebriated logic more than his muggle friends can. Then he wonders why Draco might’ve been walking home with someone he just met, and sobers a little.
When Harry was nineteen, he went on a date with a witch who’d gone to school at Durmstrang. Hermione had set them up, after they’d met at work. He’d hoped his notoriety wouldn’t have reached her there, but he’d been wrong. She barely said a word all through dinner, and when he asked her if something was wrong, she asked him to go back to her flat. Not feeling much interest in her beyond her dark hair and grey eyes, and not wanting to lead her on, he declined.
, and as much as that thrills him, he knows it isn’t right. Harry didn’t mean to make a statement like that, he didn’t know any better. But fuck, it was about as obvious as wearing Draco’s collar.
He raises his own hand, tries to lay it over hers in a familiar gesture, but it passes through to his own skin. He begins to cry. “Why?”
In the kitchen, he slathers the bagels with cream cheese and smoked salmon, the way Simi’s mother showed him. Draco puts the plates down on the same table that he fucked Potter on, and wonders if Weasley would punch him again if he told him that. He won’t tell him, but it’s still fun to think about. They start eating, the tart flavours balancing perfectly with the mellow chewiness of the bread. Draco observes the man in front of him, happily chewing away, except for the slight crease still between his brows.
He settles Potter on the bed, and undresses. Having sex in his clothes is all fun and games until he has to deal with being hot and uncomfortable afterwards. Too tired to fetch a flannel, he casts basic cleaning charms over their bodies. Potter stretches on the bed, rubbing his legs against the soft sheets like a cricket. It’s painfully charming, and Draco can’t resist lying down next to him.
Harry lets that sink in for a moment, before something occurs to him. “Does that mean Moaning Myrtle can finally leave the girl’s bathroom?”
Harry finally gives in and slumps down next to Draco, pushing up his hair from where it’s plastered to his neck. Draco pounces, and he can taste salt on his tongue as he kisses him. He’s practically growling into Harry’s mouth, and pulls them both upright.
“Lord, what a spoilsport.” they drawl, rolling their eyes. “Let’s have a drink and put some music on- create an atmosphere, and all that jazz.”
When he first heard that Arthur Weasley wanted to start some kind of learning centre to teach wizards more about muggles, he laughed. Wasn’t that the same man who hadn’t known how to dress like one at the Quidditch Cup? But, the more he thought about it, the more he thought it was a good idea.  Hogwarts had really not done much to teach their students about the muggle world, and Muggle Studies was elective, not mandatory. Yes, the idea had legs. Although from what he’d heard, funding was an issue.
The Manor is imposing, but inconspicuously grand. The grounds are verdant, white peacocks parade across the lawn in the distance, and the stonework shines a cool grey. It looks nothing like the scene of countless murders he knows it to be. Seeing no bell or knocker on the intricate iron gates, he sends his Patronus cantering inside to find Draco.
Malfoy ends the kiss just long enough to look in Harry’s eyes, seeming to confirm something to himself. Harry doesn’t wait for him to come back, cupping his hand round the back of Malfoy’s neck and pulling him back in. He can feel the slide of his woollen jumper being pushed up his stomach, and he moves his hands from where they’re braced on the table behind him to raise them above his head. They break apart, gasping for the breath they’d forgotten they needed, and Malfoy tugs the jumper over his head. His t-shirt follows swiftly after, and then there are hands all over him. His skin feels hot and sensitive, like the fingertips trailing lightly over his ribs will leave bruises in their wake. Surely, Malfoy can’t touch him like this and not leave any evidence behind?
Harry rolls his eyes and buries his fingers in his boyfriend’s dark blonde hair, but something snags on the back of his neck. Gently, Harry pulls it out. “A leaf?”
“You have such a sweet mouth, darling.” He keeps rocking his hips, voice low enough not to break the hush that’s fallen over the room. “Does it want to be filled, too?”
“Alright, darling,” says Draco, wrapping around him, as if trying to replace those metaphorical koala trousers.
“I don’t mean stop entirely,” he says, rolling his eyes. “But if you don’t want this to end up like every other misbegotten fumble you’ve had we need to do this right.”
Afterwards, Harry falls asleep. He’s not sure if Draco does too, but he’s lying beside him when he wakes, playing with his hair. It’s this moment of easy peace that gives Harry the courage he needs.
“I mean, that’s a little more in line with what I was thinking when I dragged you in here,” he admits.
Potter whines, and presses the heel of his palm against his crotch. It seems he likes that idea. Draco wonders about some of the things he’s said before. They seemed to get a good reaction, but he wants to test it again.
Hopefully confronting Draco while naked will help persuade him out of breaking off their arrangement. He’s still getting used to the idea that Draco likes his body, that he’s attracted to him, but he doesn’t have any qualms about using it. This thing, whatever it is, is too good for him to give up just yet.
“We’ve already covered the first rule: don’t touch without permission. That includes yourself. Secondly, you’re not to lie. If I ask you a question, I need you to answer it honestly. This is important. Don’t pretend to like something just because you think I want you to.”
Simi opens the door to what must be their bedroom, leaning out to yell at Draco where he’s putting bottles in the fridge.
When Draco reaches his throat, he takes a deep breath through his nose, and swallows, letting him in.
Harry lies still, stunned by the fall and the herbal scent that the tea leaves had reminded him so much of. A bead of sweat drips from Draco’s nose onto Harry’s neck. “Eugh, get off.” He shoves Draco away and sits up. “And you didn’t win, you cheated.”
They are upstairs, in what used to be a private area of the house, but was no longer used by the family by the time Malfoy was born. Or so he says, giving a dispassionate monologue about the history of the rooms. Malfoy opens a door, and gestures for Harry to go in before him. He frowns, suspicious of the polite behaviour, but goes in anyway. Inside is a nursery covered in dust. The ceiling is faded, but a painted canopy can still be made out. Suddenly, a whimpering sound comes from the old crib. Harry rushes over, and sees a baby. Translucent, wearing layers of frills and a lacy bonnet. A ghost.
Harry goes practically boneless, still nursing the fingers in his mouth. Draco takes them out, ignoring Harry’s small noise of protest, and taps them against his hole. He jolts at the sudden sensation, dick rubbing against Draco’s clothed stomach. A wet index finger rubs at his rim, before dipping ever so slightly inside. Draco scrapes Harry’s neck with his teeth as he pushes in to the first knuckle.
“One minute, I’m not ready.” They turn to see Harry hovering in the doorway, and winking cheekily. “Oh, hello there. Come on in, I’ll be out in a sec.”
Draco laughs, grateful and affectionate. “Even Snakeface Supreme couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Pansy.”
The Harry-shaped lump doesn’t move, so Hermione shrugs and flops back onto the bed beside him. He sticks his head out just far enough to see her stare up at the ceiling, dark circles under her eyes.
Harry rolls his eyes, and looks around the room. Where are his clothes? His wand must be in his trouser pocket still. With a spike of heat in his gut he remembers what happened in the kitchen last night, and where his clothes and wand must be. He goes into the adjoining bathroom to relieve himself. Wandlessly, he casts a cleaning charm over his teeth, wincing at the aggressive minty taste. Harry’s always struggles with subtlety when it comes to wandless casting. He spots a dressing gown hanging on the back of the bathroom door and snags it. It’s thin white cotton, but better than nothing.
By this time Harry was shaking. The Dursley’s rarely attended church, and so such gory tales were largely unfamiliar to him.
He takes Harry back to his, not even considering otherwise. They stumble through the front door, giggling like teenagers afraid of waking their parents up. Draco nips into the en suite, grabbing the two of the cups he keeps there and filling them from the tap. He always forgets he can use magic for a bit, after spending time with his muggle friends. He takes them through to the bedroom and presses one into Harry’s hand.
Draco’s kisses are slow and languid, as if he has all the time in the world. They stay in that same position, Harry nestled in his lap, just kissing, for a long time. Harry starts to move a little, grinding against the hardness underneath him, but his position gives him little leverage.
Draco gets to his feet and holds a hand out to Harry. His palm is damp with cooling sweat, but instead of making him want to pull away, he just wants to press kisses to it. See if he can taste salt. He doesn’t. That might be a bit much. Now, he’s going to be second-guessing every little gesture, wondering if it will show too much of what he’s feeling and drive Draco off. God, being in love is exhausting.
When Draco comes back to the present he is trembling with rage. He grips the edge of the desk, trying not to show Potter just how affected he is. He mutters under his breath, holding back the tidal wave of abuse he wants to fling at Potter’s ex by the skin of his teeth. That’s not what Potter needs right now. He needs Draco to stay calm.
“I’m sorry, Potter.” Draco scoops up the letters, hopefully they contain words of comfort from people better equipped to deal with this than he, and drops them with the paper onto Potter’s lap. “I know you were hoping to work things out.”
Draco’s hand tightens on his hip as he brings the phone back to his ear. “Hi Simi, I’m in a bit of a situation right now. You see, I’ve got this pretty boy sitting on my cock, waiting for me to do whatever I want with him.”
“Maybe before the war, but think about now. You said dark magic and objects infect the wards? There’s been a lot of that going about, hasn’t there? And all those old Death Eater houses that have been left to relatives or confiscated by the ministry, won’t they need repairing?”
“But you know what I really want? I want your mouth, your arse, on my cock for hours. Not moving, just waiting, keeping me warm until I decide to use you.”
Once, a pair of robins made their nest high up in one of the hedges. Harry would go and visit them every day, peering in at them like a lady cooing at a baby in a crib. He waited impatiently as the nest took shape, as the fragile eggs were laid, as the first yellow beaks appeared. Mr and Mrs Red-Breast were run ragged feeding their brood, the chicks awake and hungry with the sunrise. Harry would dash about the vegetable patches hidden away in the kitchen garden, finding worms to place under the hedge, much like Mrs Figg’s cats bringing mice to her door.
The ladder in question rattles at the brash sound of his voice, then zooms off along the shelves to the other end of the room.
“Not this time, duckie. We’re using the leaves- that box over there.” She points to a scratched green tin that appeared to house Garibaldi biscuits in a past life.
Draco lets them in with his own key, striding off to the adjoining kitchen and calling out for Simi. Harry pauses in the doorway, taking it all in. Draco’s old flat is small, but well loved. The building itself should probably be condemned, and the furniture had ‘seen better days’ about ten years past, but there’s no mistaking the warmth. Not literal warmth, as it was actually freezing, but personal touches that made it seem like a home. The overgrown cheese plant in the corner, the static muggle photographs spilling over every surface, the herbs growing on the kitchen windowsill. In a way, it reminds Harry of a cross between a Neville’s plant-filled house and the Burrow.
After she leaves, he chucks two thirds of the mug’s contents into a plant. It shakes its spiny leaves as if shuddering. Luna is followed down the stairs by Ginny, dressed comfortably and wearing…slippers? The moment she sees him she stops, pausing on the bottom step.
It won’t take much. The energy that’s been coiling inside him ever since Malfoy asked if he trusted him is so tightly wound that anything could set it off. He wraps his hand around him and strokes him fast. He buries his head into Malfoy’s shoulder, eyes squeezed shut. There’s no lube, and it’s dry, but the head of his dick is rubbing against the silk of that stupid fancy waistcoat, and then he’s coming all over it.
He takes another deep breath, and pushes back inside with a contented sigh. Finally, he lengthens his thrusts. He keeps them slow, and avoids abusing Potter’s prostrate. He lifts Potter’s hips a little more, for a better angle, and stares down at his cock. It’s not completely soft anymore, twitching as Draco glides in and out, but nowhere near hard. It amazes him that Potter could be so obviously enjoying himself, and yet not have an erection.
"Well, we used to get a lot of different birds at the lake, in the manor grounds. When I was little I used to try and stand on one leg for as long as I could, like the herons did. I’d always fall over.”
He’s been struggling not to call him Harry as it is. It’s probably time to accept defeat. Harry places the mug on the bedside table and lets his head loll back on Draco’s arm.
Maybe, despite his world turning upside down, it did have one constant. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy would never get along.
Malfoy doesn’t look wrong-footed now. He looks confident, smirk pinned in place, the sharp silhouette of his body outlined in the orange lamplight. “What is it about sex? Do you not want it, or are you scared of it?”
“Yes,” he says. “What a stupid question, Weasley. I’ve hurt him many times, and you know it. Now, are you satisfied? Or are we going to keep going in circles forever?”
He wondered if Potter still thought about him. Probably not. He was probably too busy living his life, being in love with someone he’d actually seen in the last four years. Someone who’d been kind to him, even once. He hoped Potter had someone who was kind to him- he doubts he ever could be.
Afterwards, Malfoy approaches him. His face looks paler than usual, purple bags dragging under his eyes, and mouth drawn tight. Now he has no flowers to grip onto like a lifeline his hands are shaking, and he rubs him thumb up and down the handle of his wand. He looks like his father. Not the man Harry met in his second year, who looked down his nose at him and wore his hair in a ponytail held in place with a black ribbon. He reminds him of the broken old man he’d seen after the battle, who’s hair hung in a greasy sheet, and slouched defeated. Malfoy is immaculately groomed, and standing tall, but Harry sees the resemblance all the same.
