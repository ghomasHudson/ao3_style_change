Outside in the sunlight and fresh air, surrounded by people on the pavement, Vernon tries to rationalize the experience. It must be Draco, because Vernon had been feeling perfectly all right until they had locked eyes. Now that he thinks about it, the man is not handsome, but rather
“It’s more than
He drops his wand on the nightstand and falls back onto his pillows, trying to breathe deeply to slow his racing heart. Draco had forgotten that he had written to Pansy asking her to meet him for breakfast on the first day back from Christmas hols. He regrets that now, especially when he hears the wind rattle the windows and he can see his breath every time he exhales.
“Oh, sorry. It’s a quill, actually,” Draco says. “But look on the bright side; I found ‘x’.”
They had saved the tree for last. Harry had carefully strung lights and tinsel with such precision that Draco suspected he had used magic despite claiming otherwise. Candy canes, colourful popcorn strings, and large bows hung from each branch. Each handmade ornament was gently placed on the branches. Harry had even charmed miniature Snitches to fly around the tree.
“You’re actually buying them?” Pansy asks.
“You’re either very brave or very foolish, Potter, for letting me be near you.”
Draco hands the driver more than enough money to cover the ride, pushing open the door to step out. The driver’s eyes widen at seeing the note. “I don’t have change,” he says.
That’s when a brilliant idea pops into his mind. He waves his wand to open Harry’s school trunk. “
“Not that you need it, but it’s a lucky charm. Grandpa Weasley told me that it’s Muggle, so you can have it with you in the exam room,” Teddy answers. He goes behind the desk and gives Draco a hug, whispering, “You’re going to do great tomorrow. Soon you’ll take care of all the sick animals.”
After all, as far as Draco knew, Harry had never told his friends or the Weasleys about what he did every Saturday.
“What did you do to me?” Vernon whispers.
Taking a deep breath, Draco straightens his back and quietly opens the front door.
“What?” Harry asks, his eyes wide.
“Then it’s a good thing I decided to buy ingredients to cook beef stew tonight. Now don’t expect a fancy, delicious meal. You’re still teaching me, but I think I can manage this. Just dump all the ingredients in a pot, stir occasionally, and hope for the best. Exactly like you did in Professor Snape’s class.”
“Draco, I’ve missed you,” Harry says, kissing him. Draco melts into the kiss, feeling all the tension and frustration leave his body. When Harry pulls back, his green eyes are full of concern as he gazes at Draco. “What’s wrong, Draco?”
Normally, Draco loves to sleep in when he’s not working, but late last night, he had an idea on how to make his own Weasley jumper. His plan is simple. He’ll buy a new jumper, one that’s as close to the blue colour that Harry tried to knit him, and add a simple
It’s a rare occasion that Harry manages to surprise Draco. The last time it happened, Harry had asked him out on a date. Draco’s response now is the same question he had asked Harry many months ago.
“What did she say?”
“I thought I would ask. I want to know whom I’m working with,” Ron says, unclasping the briefcase.
“If this doesn’t work out, you can always open a bakery.”
Ron nodded. “Well, the only reason that Harry was allowed to discharge and return to Grimmauld Place was if someone was here to take care of him in case he needed anything,” Ron said, scratching the back of his head. There was a long stretch of pink skin on the side of his neck that had been recently healed. “But I wanted to go home to Hermione and tell her that Harry is okay. She’s rather worried about him, but couldn’t go to St Mungo’s that far along unless it’s time to deliver the baby.”
“Harry, the blame is on both of us. We should have talked more instead of falling into bed whenever we had the chance to see each other. But a relationship is not going to be easy. You have to work at it. Perhaps you’ll have better luck with Malfoy.”
“Perfectly normal,” Harry says, smiling. “You were on assignment dressed like that? I didn’t know the Hit-Wizard uniform had changed.”
! Draco frowns. The dreary weather and the long hours at St Mungo’s must be affecting his mental state if he’s hearing voices and no one is there. Shaking his head, he only manages to walk a few steps before he hears the opening words to the song again.
Instead, he stared at Harry, trying to decipher if Harry was telling the truth. He wouldn’t risk revealing his feelings until he knew for certain. Without the glasses on his face, Harry looked a bit shy and vulnerable as he waited for Draco’s reaction.
“I’m sorry, what was that?” Draco sat down across from Harry and leaned forward in his chair in case Harry decided to speak softly again.
Harry smiles. “You’re right, Draco, but I’ve picked up a few tricks by marrying a Slytherin.” He pulls out a chair and sits in front of Draco’s desk. “Besides, I’ll make it worth your time. What do you say?”
Instead of joining them when they had asked, Harry had decided to stay in England. He thought it was his duty to join the Auror programme and help bring in all the remaining Death Eaters that had gone into hiding after the war. It had only taken a few months to know that he had made the wrong choice. He hated going out onto the field and having everyone expect him to save the world.
Dudley shakes his head. “No, nothing she ever did harmed us. I even took her to the zoo to see if she would talk to the snakes, but I don’t think she can.”
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “How eloquent. I don’t believe you, Potter.”
in flashing lights.
“That’s not true,” Harry said.
Draco watches as a smile slowly spreads across Teddy’s face and he practically yells, “I will? How?”
“I love you, Draco Malfoy. I always will.”
Draco gently lifts the peacock out of the tree, but his hands hits the edge of the glass sphere and something falls back inside. “I’m so sorry, Harry! I think I broke it,” Draco says, his heart beginning to beat faster.
That morning, Draco had had enough and had gone to St Mungo’s for a check-up when he couldn’t stand the constant irritation. He had tried new shampoos and different potions to stop the pain, but with no success. Harry truly believes that Draco is afraid that his hair is going to fall out.
He really didn’t need to stay. In fact, the only reason he did was because he had enjoyed his time with Harry. Harry, who had become someone Draco could trust and whom he still had a bit of a crush on. Not that it mattered. Harry had never shown any interest in him other than friendship.
“No! Harry’s my best mate.”
“It’s a basic healing spell the Aurors are taught in case they get injured and can’t seek medical help right away. Did it work?” Harry asks, holding out his hand.
“Why not?” Draco said.
Draco smiles. “I Vanished the question. You can’t get a wrong answer if the question is never there to begin with.”
There’s too much information and yet at the same time there is not enough.
“Uncle Harry, are you sad? Don’t cry,” Teddy’s says, voice muffled by Harry’s shirt.
Draco didn’t want to wait around for Ron to come back. He started wrapping the ornaments with care and placing them into the original container as fast as he could. The boxes were stacked neatly on the table and he was picking up his messenger bag when the sound of the Wireless shutting off finally got him to notice that Ron had returned. He looked a little worse for wear and his voice a little raspy when he spoke. “Listen, Malfoy, I need a favour.”
reveals their family clock, another gift from the Weasleys, cradled protectively against Draco’s chest.
Now, however, that the war is over and they are in the last term of their Eighth Year, Harry has asked Draco if it’s okay to reveal their relationship to their friends. Draco eagerly agrees, pleased that Harry wants no secrets kept from the people he loves.
Harry sighed and crossed his arms against his chest. “Will you ever go back?”
“What? A cranky, self-centered person who is stubborn and acerbic and complains too much?”
“How? I still see that you have two eyes, messy hair, and your skin is darker from the sun, but that will fade. The most important thing about you hasn’t changed, right? I meant your personality, not your cock, so take your mind off of that for a moment. I don’t see what’s different.”
Draco stares at him in shock. “You made this?” he asks.
However, now there’s an envelope in his hands that has only his name and no return address that has miraculously made its way to Harry’s home. This wouldn’t be the first time he receives a life-changing letter.
Hermione’s eyes are wide as she exclaims, “Harry, you were together for more than a year and you don’t honestly believe that’s the way you want to end your relationship with Charlie? A quick ‘we should break up’ with no explanation and then ignore him at the wedding where he’s supposed to be your date. At least with Ginny you ended things amicably, but how did Charlie react?”
Draco shakes his head. “Today was the best day I ever had in a long time. I got to help Rose find all the Easter eggs.”
There are not many things that terrify Harry, but seeing Draco act like he’s being attacked and helpless to defend himself is one of them. “Draco! It’s me, Harry! You’re safe now,” he repeats over and over.
As Draco rushes out, the door to his personal Head Boy room slams shut with a little more force than necessary. Sir Cadogan, the knight in the painting that guards his room, almost falls off his fat grey pony. He raises his wand and shouts after Draco, “Now you’ve done it! Stay and fight, you coward!”
on the tip of his tongue, then thought better of it. Harry had insisted on teaching him surveillance spells if Draco ever thought something was wrong.
Memories overwhelm Harry at the mere mention of the name. Harry remembers a large blond boy laughing as he dropped Harry’s food to the floor; remembers Dudley ordering his friends to hold Harry down as he punches him; remembers dragging a shocked Dudley to Number 4, Privet Drive after a dementor almost Kissed them.
“You’re not upset that it’s him?”
Harry nods. Those seemed like perfect examples of accidental magic. “Well, what made you change your mind?”
s the
“Right now?”
“Oh this is rich. You’re single, Malfoy? Of course you are. Who would ever want you?” Ron says, almost laughing until Hermione hisses, “Ron!” and not so subtly pushes his shoulder.
“That’s it, Noel,” Draco says, waving the cat treat, “Step away from the jumper and I’ll give you this delicious treat.”
Except that Draco strides past him and holds open the door.
Harry breaks their kiss. “As lovely as this is, I actually did bring you over here to give you a gift.”
He startles when Draco sets down a cup of tea in front of him.
“Harry, what are you doing? Stop that! You’ve ruined it.”
“What I found did not impress me,” Draco says. “Pity you’re not a Muggle who’s more like Granger.”
Draco looks at him, unimpressed. “Don’t push your luck, Harry.”
‘He doesn’t play with me like you do. He just stares at me most of the time, or lets me watch the telly.”
Draco doesn’t know his way around children. He and Harry had agreed not to have children early on in their relationship. The only person he’s helped raise is his cousin Teddy, who has graduated from Hogwarts and is in Romania with Charlie Weasley. And whenever he visits the Burrow for Sunday brunch, all the children abandon the adults in favour of playing with each other so he never really interacts with them.
Harry’s wardrobe contains his collection of t-shirts, denims, and Auror uniforms along with a few outfits from Gladrags that Harry wears when they go out to dinner. By contrast, all of Draco’s clothes are made in Paris, Milan, and New York unless he’s wearing his Healer robes.
Draco didn’t even hesitate before saying yes. “I’d like that. I know Mother always wanted to reconnect with her sister and this would be a perfect way to start. Only if it’s alright with you.”
“I’m pregnant,” Draco says, “and I will be needing your help to take care of your baby brother or sister. Can you do that for me?”
“What did you do?” she asks, lifting the page for a closer inspection.
“Let’s hope that’s true,” Harry says. “I’m not getting rid of any of you anytime soon.” He grabs the tin of treats off the table and offers one to Noel. A few seconds later, Holly joins her sister, standing on her hind legs to rest her head on Harry’s knees.
“Ron!” Harry exclaims, but Draco doesn’t even look fazed.
Harry nods. “I’ve saved up enough holiday time. And Kingsley happens to agree with me. Said it would do me some good to have a social life and to gain some new experiences.”
“Please don’t come any closer. You need to get rid of the bouquet.”
“Charlie, wait! You forgot your suitcase!” The suitcase begins to shake violently on the kitchen table. Harry dreads that it might be a Wheezes product, one meant to explode all over him now that he’s officially broken up with Charlie. It would be something that George would most certainly do.
“Go,” Hermione said, waving him off. “Don’t come back until we can give Draco the proper ‘If you break Harry’s heart, we will kill you’ speech.”
The silence on the other end stretches for far too long and Draco wishes could take back the question. What was he thinking, asking something like that?
a Death Eater, Draco. How many times do I have to tell you? You were cleared by the Wizengamot.” Harry reaches over and grasps his hand.
“Why?” Harry asked.
“Yes!”
“Of course I’m sure. I didn’t ask you on a whim, Draco. I’ve been planning to ask you for quite a while, but I didn’t know how to bring it up,” Harry says. “I understand if you don’t want to, or it’s too soon—”
“Do I know him?” Neville asks.
Those words perk Teddy up and he nods. Draco gathers Teddy against his chest and whispers, “Do you remember how poorly I’ve felt these past few days?”
“You have nothing to be sorry about. Why would Draco be angry?”
“Harry, thank you. I would love to wear this tomorrow.” Draco holds up the jumper to examine it further. There are holes and part of the right sleeve is unravelling, not to mention how dirty it’s become. “Is there a way to fix it with magic?”
“We can try,” Harry says, smiling. “After all, I have power the Dark Lord knows not.”
Harry leans back, wiping away the tears that have started to fall down his face, and pulls Teddy onto his lap, his hand never letting go of Draco. “I’m not sad, Teddy. How can I be? I have everything I need in the world right here in my arms.”
Hermione reached over and squeezed his hand. “Well, tell me about him. Where did you meet? Where does he work?”
“Shh, I’m here now, you’re okay,” Harry says, tightening his hold on Draco and walking faster to their bedroom. “Why aren’t you in bed?”
Draco could hear them go slowly up the creaking stairs, which didn’t do much to drown out the rush of thoughts that came out in his head. The most important one was:
Draco hopes that Harry’s luck holds and that tomorrow night doesn’t end in complete disaster.
“I am, too,” Harry says.  “Now, if you remember, I have a present for you.” Harry pulls out a tiny silver egg, the size of a Bertie Bott’s bean, from his pocket, before using his wand to return it to its original size.
newly single. It seems that all the single guests in attendance are invited to somehow catch the bouquet of sunflowers to see who the next one to marry is. Personally, my money is on Blaise. That is, if he ever decides to settle down.”
Harry immediately shook his head. “I don’t think I can,” he started to say. First and foremost there was Teddy to think about. It was already hard enough to be apart from his godson for this amount of time. And to bring Teddy with him to Australia was not something he could do to Andromeda. Besides—
Draco turns to look at Harry with one eyebrow raised. He’s full of rich food and a savory wine and he’s happy just watching the sunset next to Harry.
Harry pauses, trying to figure out how much he wants to reveal. “Yes and no. He went to Hogwarts, but he’s entirely different than when he was a kid. So I’m trying to make a good first impression because I think he thinks that he doesn’t deserve me. In fact, it took me seven tries to ask him out on a date before he agreed. But I want to date him because he treats me like I’m a normal person and not some hero in the history books. He’s someone I could imagine being married to one day.”
Harry thinks about Draco’s words all the way to their bedroom. Like Draco had said, their bed looks like it hasn’t been slept in a while. Harry wandlessly pulls the duvet down and gently lays Draco down on the silk sheets. He protests when Harry lets go, an anguished look on his face.
Ginny smiles at him before giving him a hug. As one of Luna’s bridesmaids, her dress is sky blue and she looks absolutely wonderful. Still, her face softens when she replies, “You were never the problem for why we didn’t work out, Harry. It was the circumstances. We just weren’t ready. We rushed into it because we thought it was how it was supposed to be. And then we broke up to find ourselves. That’s a good thing, too, or else you’d probably be an Auror instead of a wand maker and I would write for the
Draco finished the rest of his coffee and sighed. He had fallen into that disgusting habit that Harry had introduced him to and now he was too keyed up to attempt to sleep. He closed the book and glanced at his watch, surprised when he saw that it was a little past five in the morning.
“They are not,” Harry says, lowering his voice when he continues, “You know perfectly well that we cast a weight lightening charm before we left Tesco. These bags are light as a feather.”
Since the beginning of December, Harry has been on an undercover mission in Madrid and has had no communication with anyone. It’s hard to be apart, but the one thing that keeps Draco going is that Harry had promised he would return in time to celebrate their first Christmas together. In all the time they have been dating, Harry has never broken a promise, and although Draco knows that things can change, he just misses Harry terribly.
Chrisaliss’s toothless grin covered her face. She squirmed, feeling his love pour into her.
The linen was much lower than Harry thought he had a right to see, but his eyes kept coming back to it.  That demarcation, from the white shore of Draco’s creamy skin, to the beginnings of glistening private hairs that were as pale as those on his head, made him tighten his grip on maturity and how serious the matter was.
Draco had a point, but Harry’s desire caught fire. He’d have to keep his mouth shut about it. He looked down at the talisman he’d been rubbing. He felt better, now that he had a lead. The thing looked like a big Cheerio, and he thought of Iece sitting up in bed with Draco, eating from a baggy full of dry cereal. She liked fun things. It was supposed to be tailor made from his magic and his love, complete with his mother and father’s protection. He decided that she was better off with it than him. Focus on love, Thella had said. Well, there was no greater example of that than her.
It was when the roads disappeared, that he had to insist his instincts were right. Look for anything resembling a tree, he told himself. Deforestation should've cinched that, but the more he drove, the more he realized it also made things feel hopeless. It occurred to him that he was never going to find anything driving on paved roads. He had to dare to keep along the train's path, even when that meant turning around and backtracking because he couldn't cross a trestle or a grassy bog just waiting to suck his tires into immobility. He was alone out here, and maybe a little reckless for being so. He knew, if he got the jeep stuck, his magic could get him out of a bind. But he really didn't have time for foolish results like that. How hard was it to find a tree in a place where those were few? They'll stand out, he insisted. You'll never see them, another part of him argued.
She paused. It was her turn to look perplexed, but she looked more like she was trying to figure out how to handle answering him. She put her finger to her chin. “I’m a witch, Harry. We know what we need to know.”
“Sirius.”
Sirius held his sides and collapsed against James, who wasn’t laughing anymore.
Definition:  Heifer; a female cow that has never given birth. (Heh, after all the shit females go through, that don’t sit right with Eileen.)
What the hell was The Brady Bunch?
He had no memory of agreeing to that text. Obviously, his image had been magically manipulated the way nonmagics digitally enhanced their photos and films. For some reason, it took the wind out of him and he suddenly felt that if he didn’t put food into his stomach, whether he wanted to or not, he would die on the spot.
Snape considered this, not bothering to deny the truth in it.
“Ritual. A ceremony. We must ask your parents to stand in and recreate their connection with the beings who awarded them with a child to begin with. They used your independence as a sacrifice, as payment. You’ve cooperated as best you can, but you’ve outgrown the agreement. It’s only fitting that you re-negotiate the terms, especially now that you know you can’t live up to your family’s expectations.”
“Exactly.”
This time, Harry didn’t comment on her implications. Draco stared into his drink.
“I can’t tell the difference,” she said haughtily. “Come, Tuny. Help me clear everyone out and straighten things in there”
“Nothing could be more right,” Harry insisted.
A/N:  I'm still working on this story. It's a lot of fun and a LOT of work, so I took a break to complete smaller projects. Will get back to it asap.
Her solution was more of a truce, and met with practical nods. No one knew what else to do.
He knew that this was Eileen’s mother, Ladoria Prince, and Jipsy.
Hayatt saw it too and let it pull him hypnotically to the bed.
Harry felt sick. How bad did a kid’s childhood have to be before he preferred ghosts? At least Dudley was decent to him sometimes, when no one else was looking. But Draco had been alone in that cold ass  estate. What had he done when he gave Jipsy the freedom to create? It can all be changed back, right?
Must’ve slacked off his workouts to transform into his latest appalling role. He found Dan’s presence, one floor above him, to be distracting. It was bad enough that he had to come outside in his underwear to smoke, but he did it in the same damn pair for three days in a row.
As he wrapped Draco’s hands in bandages, wondering if the elf couldn’t get a doctor through, another idea occurred to him. What if…
He’d been told to meet at the pavilion. It was the historical site of the World Wizard Trading Fair thirty years prior, and remained a treasured landmark that, to unsuspecting muggles, looked like a well preserved train depot from the fifty’s era. A dog park had been built around it.
Harry’s grin twisted, satisfied. He knew Draco must’ve liked it more than he let on. Iece clapped her hands and strung a whole sentence of words together, as if she really had something exciting to share. But the only thing they could agree she’d said, is, “Is kweem belly...” something, “… belly,  … gooooooood!”
He couldn’t explain it. This wasn’t like the last time, at the hospital. There were no electrical surges, that were signs of magic conflicting with muggle technology. No explosions. The apartment seemed fine, except for the animation dancing around. He wanted to stand and interact with it, to see if the illusion would burst like a bubble, but he suspected he’d only distract Iece out of her reverie. If this really was her doing, he felt obligated to get to know what she could do. Was this her, or as it arising out of unwanted side effects?
"I have practice in two hours. I can't miss it a second time."
Whether Greg had ever learned this trick or not, he caught up with Harry as soon as Harry latched onto the hint of a blur that glistened one second and was gone the next. Greg had only to follow him. He caught up with Harry and their speeds tied. Reckless zeal had them shoulder to shoulder. Their brooms collided. Greg’s foot levers entangled with Harry’s, causing the brooms to lock together. Quickly, Greg tore loose, taking a chunk of Harry’s lever with him. Harry’s broom lurched as he twisted it away. A loud crack slapped in the wind and the rear of his broom disappeared, leaving him with only half a stick and gliding without power. He caught hold of Greg’s tail twigs, which hung by thin slivers that wouldn’t last in the wind. With nothing else to lose, Harry threw himself onto Greg’s broom. Greg punched at his hands, but Harry held on. Deceleration took them down. Greg kept Harry’s arms from wrapping around his broom, but not his legs. All Harry had to do, was throw one leg around the handle, to compromise the broom’s ability to receive instruction. It now had two wizards telling it how to fly. Instead of plummeting, it began to jerk as each wizard fought for dominance.
Nobody asked questions. Sirius and Remus knew that it would be too easy to trigger another argument between James and Lily. They kept their heads down and followed orders.
He was reaching for the door, then stopped. He kept his back to Malfoy, who came up behind him.
“Of course.”
He pretended not to be interested as she twisted the thing around her short body, tied it into a loose knot, held by magic at her hips, or what passed for hips, and proceeded to set dishes and plates on the table at the foot of Iece’s bed.
“Because it wasn’t bloody planned, that’s how.” Ron looked insulted. “What the hell’s gotten into you?”
"I haven't seen Harry today. What picture? When they told me he'd checked himself out, I was too disgusted. If he's well enough to walk out, he doesn't need me fussing over him. When I heard there was even more drama, my primary concern became to take care of my sister. That meant choosing to see you over tracking his arse down."
“Let me guess,” he ventured. “The husband had that made for her, didn’t he?” He pointed. Jipsy nodded.
He turned to the glowing woman who resembled Narcissa. “You, you’re like a mother archetype. Tell them that Draco didn’t mean any harm. You must know that he didn’t mean to hurt his baby. Where’s the good in his beliefs?”
“No you don’t. Not if it’s not really what you want to do. We can hire our own security. Before you protest, what’s the difference between us signing their check or this CIUM signing their checks? Your number one complaint would be the intrusion on our lives, but I’m telling you, there’s a class of security where we’d never see our employees unless we wanted to. They’re not going to be flanking your daughter on her first day of school, but they will have enough access to put themselves between her and any danger. She’ll never know they’re there.”
She drove that statement into him. It hit its mark. He got it. He had to see the curse for what it was. A war wound, not being denounced by the human race. Not having made such a terrible move, that life was never going to forgive him, or let up on him for being something so horrible that the average person could not fail to that extent. The average person could not get themselves cursed that badly.
Femininity was in the air. Perfume. It was light and reminded him of honeysuckle, it was that distinct. That could only be a witch or wizard’s meticulous brew. Muggle perfumes smelled like synthetic chemicals compared to the finer layers of wizarding ones. The precision it must’ve taken, the skill and patience, reminded him of Snape and he would’ve bet that the perfume was made by someone related to Snape. This brewing ability had definitely passed to his genetic stores and it was uncanny that such a thing could run so specifically in a bloodline. For a moment, he was pleased that the only way he could know this was from having watched Snape brew for seven years. That suddenly felt like an immense archive of knowledge and experience under his belt.
“She’s part of the family. The sisters all stay together. That’s how we circulate the magic of our coven and keep it available for those who come back into the living world. We see what needs to be done on that side, and we make the proper arrangements on this one. We watch over the movements of the ages, the way old ones read waves on the sea, to detect the coming changes. We oversea nations from our inconspicuous, domestic little roles, and insert ourselves at key moments. Thella is part of our sisterhood, and always has been. So have you. Lily. Severus. And so many more. How do you think people survive being herded like cattle and raised just to provide labor to the machinations of civilizations and wars? We try to help them, till they can stand on their own. Till they know how valuable and powerful they are. We raise agents to fight the good fight.
The Minister's smile slid down his face. He shot back, "It took two days to find bodies. Lives could've been saved if wizards were allowed to work magic unimpeded by the CIUM."
Judging by the sound of his voice, and the unbroken string of intellect he was piecing together, Harry found him to have too much strength. He was still talking, wasn’t he? That pissed Harry off. Why couldn’t he kill this wizard? Did Lucius think this was a game? He decided to test how weak he really was, and leapt for his throat. Instead of standing his ground, Lucius ran. Limping, but it qualified as a full speed dash until Harry slung him into a holly bush. He screamed from their thorny spines and rolled his body into the next neighboring yard. Muggles observing from their porches, ran back inside. Two dobermans barked alongside Harry, but never interfered as Harry kicked Lucius, tripping and stumbling, onto the next lawn.
Glances shifted around the table. The last battle of wills seemed to have taken something out of all of them.
He looked around in those memories and experiences like a man searching an old house, going from room to room, doing his best to ignore all the things he couldn’t change. Harry’s screams shook every scene, every room, even areas that appeared to have nothing to do with that night. This surgically removed particle of memory, chemistry, and magic, was an epicenter, affecting all levels of Harry’s holographic mind. Snape saw that even as a child in his crib, Harry as a baby, flinched from the young man’s screams, which were far away in some probable future. In the endless nebulae of the soul, it was all happening outside of time, still unfolding.
“How is that possible?” He stepped on his father’s feet to get in front of her. His brow furrowed, alarmed and excited at the same time. “What’s it mean?”
Another ache.
Even in the dim of the garage, he saw the light in her eyes flare. She was not going to forgive him for taking that tone with her. No matter what she’d done, her status was supposed to be sacrosanct. Anyone who used her body as a life support system, then her investment of love and focus, was owed that. It might be years from now. There might be a miracle and they could both be in a better place. But one day, she would mold a set of circumstances out of his disrespect in this moment, and it would snap back to him like a rubber band stretched through time. She could hold onto a slight for decades, letting go of her end of it, to see the recoil inflict all the pent up damage that had kept it taut. He’d lose skin over that burn, and she’d be right there to feign concern.
Illogical laughter tumbled out of Morell. “Breaking me out of here? What, just to torture me? Your hands are just as stained as mine are. As all of us. Collin murdered his own wife, so that Voldemort wouldn’t torture her because of her muggle blood. Voldemort convinced all of us to do unspeakable things. Even you. Do not take your strange ideas of justice out on me now. I’ve lost everything, my wife, my children, even my magic. They cut it out of my head. I can only make dead mice dance with a bit of aluminum. That’s my only entertainment. I’m no threat to anyone anymore. Surely you can see that.”
“No, honey. No kisses. It wasn’t a real ceremony.”
The change came, but not as he expected. It was subtle at first, but the effects grew stronger. Draco’s face thinned a bit, like he’d lost ten pounds. His hair got lighter, as if each follicle held a tiny fiber optic that shined through the entire strand. His cheeks got sharper, and his pajamas looser. Shadows appeared under his eyes. His lips were brightly chapped, as if dehydrated, and Harry thought he saw broken blood vessels marring his neck. He didn’t dare pull the covers down to see anything more.
Ron’s face went pink and Blaise chuckled. As he sat on the lowest step, Harry looked up at her.

Harry wasn’t breaking any rules. The game required magical command over one’s broom and he was just demonstrating it. That’s what he’d tell anyone if he had to answer for himself later. The snitch hovered in its new location for a second, before speeding past them, forcing them both to backtrack after it. Flipping at top speed, Greg tried to make his turn tighter than normal, causing the rear of his broom to hit Harry’s. Stiff, almost solidly bound spikes of straw, broke off into pieces as both brooms made impact. Harry thought he saw sparks, but didn’t wait to find out. He spun himself out of the stalemate and followed the snitch higher into the air. He got to it first, but Greg’s broom scraped his just hard enough to throw off his reach.
Draco watched darkly, as tufts fell on Hermione’s kitchen floor. Harry caught his eye and he replaced his glare with something more patient.
"Needless to say," Draco added, "Your watch and your wand were never found. If you don't like the wand, it'll do till you can get your own."
“It will. But first you must enter the portrait.”
“From what I can see here, I don’t think he’s sick from the claim that your vows have over him.”
The child, Iece, is proof of hereditary contracts of magic that unify all conflict and heal all loss. To Narcissa, her new blood not only redeems them but rewards them by uniting with Harry’s magic, which has proven to be superior in the face of Voldemort’s defeat. Who knew? Narcissa is suddenly proud to be related to Harry and can’t wait to rub it in the faces of all who denounced her family.
They were off and running. Harry shouted for someone to look after Draco. Lucius pursued, leaving Narcissa to weigh the urge to follow or stay behind. She had to know what was going on, and insisted Draco would be fine in the chair. She went after them. Lily and Sirius looked at one another, at Petunia, then followed.
Almost a week of immobility had made him stiff and he wanted to work out as much as possible before going before his team. That left him only one day to find his way back to the spot where they'd found his body. He had to see the area for himself. It might hold some clue about Snape.
Ash cleared his throat, glancing around the room. So that was a hallucination? A bit stronger than the acid he'd tried in his twenties. Back then, he'd only sat in a bar watching his skin melt painlessly off of his arms while his friends passed hooch. At no point did his dead granddad make an appearance. And while he couldn't quite remember their conversation, he got the feeling Sammual-Payu Hastings approved of this wizard.
“Of course. Jipsy will clear it with Gringotts. Mr. Potter is to come and go from Jipsy’s vault whenever he likes.” She stated firmly.
She picked up the photo that Harry had slid to her. She found the young woman intriguing and her baby adorable. She looked back up at him, then down again. She frowned and held the photo out, next to his face. “You… you look like her. You have a very similar light around you.”
Once Harry spoke his full name to the group and invoked his magic to come to the foreground of their intentions by moving his napkin, Lucius looked to James Potter, who delivered a formal speech of welcome and a recital of what they were all there for. The ritual had begun. Lucius led the others in sipping his tea, as was the customary response of acceptance to the Potter’s request to allow the courtship of their sons. When all six drank, the act completed a circuit that identified the roles and wishes of all present at the table. The air thickened as unseen specters and ancestors entered to bear witness. In adjoining rooms, James’s mother, her two sisters, and Lily’s mother and uncle entertained themselves as they waited for the outcome.
Sirius merged back with the group.
He left Thella, using the CIUM ring to portal back to the travel hub so that his return was registered. Then he apparated back to Jipsy’s vault. He arrived to see her dressed in Ladoria’s pink lace slip, which bundled into a puddle of folds at her feet. She seemed embarrassed and startled, immediately replacing it with her track suit by snapping her fingers.
It could’ve been a steep hillside on one of Ireland’s most remote landscapes. There, the sky framed Draco and his dragon, who perched on a distant ledge some feet behind him. The dragon wasn’t nearly as big in this dreamscape, but it was still impressive, and Harry saw that the color shifting in its plated armor, gave it the ability to conceal itself, blend with the background, or become invisible altogether. The dragon was regal and sat surveying the hills below, its silver eyes as sharp as an eagle’s. It watched with mild interest as Harry moved closer the Draco, who smiled.
Ash saw words moving below Foster's expression, words that could not break the restraint of his flexing jaw muscles. Foster kept his real answers submerged. Whatever he wanted to say, his lips clamped tight against a throat that still shaped what it wanted to really say. Recuperative breathing betrayed his stillness. His face cracked into division, split by a fissure of worry that started between his brows and dominated all other characteristics. Without opening his mouth, he showed that his thoughts tasted ruinous and sour, like vomit. He would not let them out.
He heard something like a whine, and looked up. The child’s blue eyes and delicate beauty stood ahead of him. He gave Harry a leap of insight.
He clutched, his palms reading the swells and plains of those sinews like brail. Strength in Harry’s spine, strain in every ligament, became a concert of twisting determination, and told him what he needed to know. Harry wanted this. Wanted him. It was terrifying to be wanted that much, and that’s why he couldn’t face it.
He found his room and rinsed his face in the sink. He was really doing this. With a man. That first encounter decades ago didn’t count. That had been out of desperation, not choice, and it wasn’t the same thing to him at all. In the room, he couldn’t sit still, he couldn’t watch TV. It was an okay room, all things considered, but the point was sex and while he wasn’t doing it, that left too much time to doubt himself. If this Kevan guy didn’t show up soon, he wasn’t sure he had the patience to see it through. Something very edgy and unsure was starting to knot in his stomach.
“Then why can’t I see her? Why can’t I be with you both right now?”
And they had to find out because the legal system claims you're hurting others if you don't drag your own shit out into the open for everyone to discuss. Like they'd know better than you. Just thank god, or whoever the fuck was running things, that that's all you had to admit. Your best mates were behind you, including Draco. You told the court that you were drugged and assaulted, along with all the other victims who got done to, under the general label "war crimes." But you didn't tell them the details because you couldn't quite bring those into focus. You didn't tell them that all you knew was that your body was different and there was this thing growing inside you. That you did your best not to think about it so that you could concentrate on destroying fucking horcruxes. You didn't tell them any of that.
"Then why would you pay for extra services? The contents were verified at the time of registration. Do you suspect a breech?"
“Sorry.”
Draco tries not to be seen.
“Get it safely to the side. Mind the muggles behind us,” he quickly amended. Her child-sized head bobbed with trinkets and painted things as she focused. When it took longer than five seconds, and the car was still moving, he knew she was struggling. Elf magic rarely struggled, that’s why they were so indispensable.
He blinked away the memory of James Potter and his cruel friends. He grabbed Collin’s jacket, removed the mobility shield, and apparated the two of them in the next second.
Her thin shoulders met with difficulty and he could see her body tremble like a woman lifting too much weight. He grew concerned, but she yelled at the wheels, “I have his consent!”
“Harry!”
It wasn’t the answer that he was looking for, but it was an answer. As honest as it rang, it didn’t feel satisfying. Most people would just leave it and be happy that Draco had volunteered a little more insight. But something bothered Harry.
“Oh, you’re quite the nurturer. I wanted you to have this, because that’s the most obvious fact in the world. Did you even try to hold it? It’s of the Rosaceae family, the Banksianae variety, and very helpful to the average household, if one knows how to use it. The leaves can cure many things, and I’m looking forward to showing you all the ways it can be applied in your home. It’s an heirloom plant, and very special. I grew it from clippings that came from my own grandmother’s.”
All he saw, was his beautiful, extraordinary green fire, consumed by an average, four-legged beast. The best magic available to him, better even than his music, had been extinguished like an offensive household fire, and not the work of art that it was. And now the thing was looking down at him as if it expected him to kneel to it. And the absolute worst thing was, Draco couldn’t even feel his anger anymore. That had been his fuel. He needed that. All that was left now, was humiliation and a ton of confusion. How could this happen? All his life, his patronus was the one place he could pour his magic without restraining himself, and this fucker eats it in one gulp? Fucking vampire! That’s what he was, and Draco was damned if he was going to marry a goddamn vampire.
The last thing the thirty-two people, scattered on the quidditch field, expected to see was a bespectacled, slight young man with an excellent athletic stride and form walking towards them. Never mind the spiky, erratic look in his eyes, or the fact that he'd obviously escaped from a hospital, bed hair and all. His famous smile was no where to be seen. It was his eyebrows that framed his humorless determination as he crossed the field towards them. In photos, the glasses provided a buffer. But in real life, his eyebrows were seriously out of control and hinted of just a little instability from unsuspected levels of testosterone. He walked, not in public persona mode, but in armor mode. He expected to have to defend himself. With trains, goblins, and dismembered parts jabbing at his concentration, screaming that Snape was still alive, those watching didn't realize they were seeing a fight to concentrate on doing what he was there to do. If he came across as a little grim and too serious, that would keep them out of his face until he got himself sorted. And it was better to be taken too seriously than not seriously at all.
Present Day. Gelderland Holland, The Grey Estate.
The mobility impairment spell that kept Collin from apparating, is what protected him from rupturing under the impact of his own attack. He recovered faster than Snape and got as far as the end of the tunnel.
The other grabbed his wand from under his pillow and zapped the lenses. “There. Can you see?”
Severus appeared to let his wand take a snap-shot of the objects specifications. He then handed it to Harry with instructions to keep it somewhere near Draco, but out of his reach. “Hide it close. We don’t know what the side-effects will be, and might need to refer to it later.”
"For god's sake will you just let me help you?" It took pinning Foster to the floor, no easy feat even in his weakened state, before Ash could reason with him.
“You didn’t mean to, I’ll give you that. You didn’t consciously weigh the pros and cons. But you’d done all of that through your magic and your spirit, which reads energy faster than the intellect can decide to blink an eye. You crossed a line with this wizard. Magic interprets your child’s genetics as a blood contract. Through that contract, her father is able to touch your spirit as if he were touching your body. It’s no different than any other bond. Your magic makes it so. In his eyes, you were persistent in meddling with one of his greatest treasures. You would not be driven away. Now he has used your love to lock you in his grip. Again, he has not consciously weighed this decision, but like you, through what he wants the most, his magic has. He now sees you as a valuable acquisition.”
Words meant nothing, when panic blossomed in Harry’s chest the way that it did. Everything was happening too fast to trust anything. “What is this, what just happened?”
“I want them to tell me.”
“She tried to get me to talk about you. I didn’t tell her anything. Probably pushed by Arthur, on behalf of the Ministry. All homey goodness and frumpy housedresses. The nerve of her, thinking I owe her any explanation on your behalf. I told her as much.”
He drew his hand down his face, starting to feel a little weary. “I admit, you’re confusing the hell out of me. Just pretend I’m a child, I don’t get all this frequency stuff.”
“You said your magic doesn’t work.”
Harry’s eyes grew huge and he struggled not to laugh, as Draco demanded, “What!”
Harry was testing Draco. He felt, with the extension of his own body emanation, for Draco’s sphere of influence. Everyone has one, extending at least six feet from their body, depending on emotional factors. A lot further if they practiced deliberate use of it. His bracelets worked with that kind of energy. With Draco, he felt it in the others body heat. He tried to get a hint of the warmth itself, instead of Draco’s light aftershave. Blushing, but defensive, flushing but responsive, Draco stubbornly waited for Harry to explain himself. Those three seconds were enough for Harry to inhale his scent and to memorize what the perspiration evaporating off of Draco’s body told him. It was a test of sexual response. He backed away.
Lucius glanced at Draco and met with poised resolve. Just as he’d been taught, Draco kept his expression polite enough to deter criticism, but cool enough to discourage conversation. Lucius had noticed subtle changes when Harry arrived, but Draco hid them before he could be called upon it.
“Very well.”
“Um, Harry that’s not a good idea.”
Harry ignored everyone, leaning over the table. “Now that we can speak along with the elders, we can have our say. Throw tradition out the window on this. It’s a sore spot for both of us. I accept you just as you are. Let me court you, and get us the hell out of here.”
He had to be careful. Just because they knew Snape was alive, didn’t mean they knew about his involvement in the wreckage. “That’s what I want to find out.”
He settled for leaning down as close as he could get. Close enough to hear her breathing and smell the faintly sour saltiness of her distress. How she’d screamed and cried, unable to understand what was happening back at Hermione’s. That was the last image he had of her, before he’d been attacked. Ranker said her vitals were normal, but he could still sense her struggle on her. He wanted to bathe her. He wanted to cleanse the whole event off of her and put her in sheets that smelled of her nursery, her bubble bath, and her stuffed toys. Bracing himself, he held a finger tip to her thin eyelid and pushed it open. Satisfaction curled on itself inside of him when he saw that her irises where their normal dark color. He hadn’t damaged her beyond repair.
Yes, a toast to your lovely bride, Harry.
James considered the rivery film blowing across the pane. “You could apparate to the car.”
Shrill screams cut her off.
Quentin was sweating, but he stood his ground. "And The Prophet? Will they not have to answer for an act that only they could control? While you're so busy dealing out retribution, they should be first on your list, not us. We are not your enemy, Mr. Malfoy."
“Hell of a weapon. I can’t describe how it happened. Like a puffer fish. The core of him. Entrails, organs, brain, all burst through his skin in an instance. He swole up, but it was all grey matter instead of face, shredded heart and intestines sprung and unstrung like dripping slinkies. Lonas didn’t deserve that. Those bastards kept him alive with magic. Dark magic. The very methods they were convicting us by. His raw, exposed muscle kept splitting, spitting parts out of him. Even bones. I can’t describe those sounds. Not screams. His mouth was long gone, churned to nothing beneath all that meat. They reduced him to hamburger. That’s what the apparation did once the hex was upon us. It was such a vile, nasty affair, even the aurors were startled by the violence of it. He lay on the ground becoming ground beef, the way those old firecracker snakes, black snakes we called them as children, sizzle and spark and twist grotesquely until they’re nothing but a mangle of winding char. He turned into something like that.
Such pushy girls could barely tolerate people who were not as mentally rapid as them, and that’s where he began to really see her resemblance to Snape. Then he reminded himself that she was a Slytherin. He didn’t know that for sure, but look at her. She seemed too assertive to be a Ravenclaw, and her stare assured him she wouldn’t have any problem taking over this situation if given the chance. Right now, she didn’t look like she was above bullying him.
“I have not come to kill you, I’ve come to retrieve you. You’re leaving with me.”
He didn’t know what hit him harder, the fact that she knew he was the birth father of his daughter, that he was lying to the world, or that his child, on some level, could have an awareness of that awful night. To believe her, was to trap himself with the unthinkable. Yet he’d entered hoping he could believe her.
Pressing Draco to the gate, he told him, “I’ll be right back.” He was more worried about Draco trying to go through, than anything. He started towards Emerald, and saw her suddenly stand. She threw out her arms, her hands clamping the dark around them. Something hit her from behind. Pushed her, when she’d unfolded her body. She stumbled forward, but braced her footing. Her hands moved involuntarily with something that wanted to be free of them. She looked at what she held. Screamed, and let them go.
“Most certainly. I read people. Your sensual energy dominates this room.”
Draco let his chin rub Harry’s shoulder, hoping it would soften the blow. “It’s not what you tell her. It’s what you don’t tell her. No other little girls have their fathers dyeing their hair. She’ll pick up an unspoken vibe that you think there’s something wrong with her. That you’re ashamed of her. You’re her father, she’ll believe it.”
He looked at the door as all of them tripped over a gibberish of excuses. “How long has he been in there?”
“But you know in your heart, it’s being accepted by those you love, that make life worth living. You can’t bear to repulse anyone. You need their love. Your friends. Your family. You can’t bear for them to know the weakness and filth you were reduced to, all in your mind. So you hide your secret exactly the same way that a fourteen year old child hides hers. Voldemort used a mere puppet to convince you of an illusion. The rape and the curse were only blows meant to stun you, so that the real weapon could be used to infect you forever. The real weapon was shame. Let me take it from you.”
After two weeks of trying not to be the wrecking ball in these stranger’s lives, he understood why he was stalking this woman and her child. Because the child wasn’t hers. She was his. He finally had a face to match to the loss he’d felt for years. Call it instinct, call it scent. The wolf knew its own. Maybe the lady had carried her to term, but that was his genetic information smiling back at him, burgeoning with more life than he’d thought possible. His and Sirius’s. He was sure of it. That was the only thing that could drive him to needing to see her face and making sure that she was okay everyday. He couldn’t eat or sleep without being haunted by what he’d given up, and inside of another month, his only thought was, how could he get her back?
With downcast eyes, Draco took his arm. His hold was committed, even if he wasn’t. His manner said, ‘Don’t embarrass me and I won’t embarrass you.’ His head lifted as Harry opened the door for them. They took their first dutiful steps forward, and exited together.
He silenced Draco into reflection. Glassy blue eyes stared at the covers and played with his fingers. If Draco realized he was holding the implant and rolling it from one hand to the other, he made no sign of it. His pajama top hung open, and Harry saw the mark he made when he’d thrown it. That pebble-sized bruise was the only blemish in a sea of cream on Draco’s chest. Shame engulfed Harry and he looked away.
“Mother, you hijacked my car to tell me about curses?”
There were promises made before their lives began. No one deals with that very well when they’re only eleven.
Arthur Weasley's plump grin echoed his wife's sentiment, and Draco stood facing a battery of emotional blinking and random sniffs. In the confusion of not knowing whose ass needed kicking, he endured the woman's wooly curls and the scent of her perfumed ointment. She squeezed him until his lack of movement made it utterly clear that he was not going to squeeze back.
Fuck it, this marriage was happening. Happiness was the goal, but that wasn’t a deal breaker. He has seen the person he would risk it with, and the person he was going to have children with. And Harry was ready to do anything for him. He was willing to melt whatever challenge met him in Draco’s stare. And if he couldn’t, he’d always have the right share Draco’s bed. That alone, was worth agreeing to the marriage.
He remembered praying, please let it be safe to trust her, before falling backwards and landing on the floor of Malfoy Manor. He hit the back of his head. The smell of dust and perfume filled his nostrils. He knew where he was because of that smell. It came from the carpet. It came from hard-soled boots, filthy from the pavement, and crushed into expensive lamb wool fibers. The carpet smelled of many scrubbings with lavender preservatives that kept it fragrant and soft. It made for a unique scent and he hadn’t realized how much of it he remembered until that moment. In the seconds that it took for his eyes to adjust, he already heard the rush of cruel laughter around him. Guests in Death Eater masks hovered in the background, while Lucius prepared to put on a show and bent low.
“Harry,” James admonished, “Draco is going to need you. Get yourself cleaned up. If Gamy’s right, you can’t go flying off like that. Trust your magic.”
As sad as that sounded, it reminded him to stay alert and focused at the same time. He sniffed at the perfume. There really could’ve been a lady getting dressed on the other side of that privacy screen, which he saw as he approached the next room.
Please review! :-)
She blurted, “He will find you. Children know to whom they belong. You belong to him just as much as he belongs to you.”
Now, facing Collin, with the frightened wizard’s preposterous suggestion that he could transfer the powers of the most capable wand in existence, to a lesser one, came the urge to see Collin choking on his own blood. He swallowed his annoyance and reminded himself to be patient. He leaned forward to give Collin a better look at his contempt, and said, “I trust that you know how to conduct yourself the minute I turn my back on you.”
His low-key business was his way of making sure people found their magic, even if they were muggles or squibs. And because the transactions were automated, that left him the freedom to enjoy a position with the professional quidditch team, the Sky Razors, as one of their reserve players. He didn’t have to maintain any high profile to protect his place on the team, simply keep his skills sharp and show up when they needed him. Between his bracelets and quidditch, his magic cycled through each in a way that kept his energy in balance. It was a good life, and the idea of opening it up to another, had never been tempting until now.
Relieved, Harry closed his eyes. That kind of trauma would’ve introduced worlds of difficulty into his marriage.
Hermione couldn’t tolerate another second of the chaos unfolding. She looked from Iece, who’s tiny nose pressed against the car window as she cried for either one of her dads. She looked at her neighbors standing on their porches and gathering in groups along the street. She took in the cops leaping out of their vehicles and storming across her lawn to subdue Harry. The need to act rose like a tidal force within her. But fear of reckless exposure stayed her hand. It was a mess, and would get worse if nothing was done.
"You didn't keep her for me. I need to hear that you didn't just keep her for me. If that's true, then sign her over to me. You don't need to hold her if the only reason she's here, is because I begged you to go through with it. She's better off without you."
Jipsy answered before he could. "She's two. Pardon, Sir, but the only thing in his mind that holds any meaning or comprehension for her, is ice cream. The rest is out of her scope and her reach. As she grows, she will see more. But only in so far as it is of interest and relevance to her. I have many disciplines to help you both in this matter."
“Well, I have to make up for what I did to you at Hogwarts, somehow.”
“It’s too late for that.” Her voice trembled through the threat of hyperventilation as adrenaline climbed in her blood. Her body was getting ready to fight. Language was leaving her. Her voice shook, being unable to breathe and talk at the same time. “They’ll try to contain the situation before they listen to anything. He’s going to attack if they attack him.”
The guy's mouth, in texture and taste, was like the sweetest white Tilapia he had ever tasted and it melted on Ash’s tongue. He couldn’t believe a human being tasted like something that could actually be ingested. He should’ve been ashamed to make the comparison, but that was a really delicious, naturally sweet fish, and he wasn’t. His scientist’s mind told him that it was a pheromone phenomenon, not a reality. Evidently, chemically, he and this young man were sexually matched. He could tell the guy was young by his build and his eagerness, and the way he lost control when Ash sank the hilt of his hand deep behind the boy’s balls and wedged it as far into the seem between his ass cheeks as he could go. Even through his pants, the young man seized against him, fighting to maintain contact with Ash’s mouth as his body jerked and emptied itself against Ash.
"It'll be like an artifact, triggered to respond to magic." Draco had used every word but 'Like Tom Riddle's Diary,' to say that Harry could control what went into it. The book would preserve history and show it in a way that the written word could only supplement. "We're talking magical artifacts. Not horcruxes."
Harry gasped, “She’s ambidextrous?”
“I’m not afraid of you. This just isn’t normal.”
“No, sir. Sadly, I could only get a few of Mistress’s favorite rooms inside, but I used her library and bedroom for the colors and decorations. Every item you see, is either real or recalled from my time with her. Gringott’s wards automatically limit the amount of magic that I can use to create space.”
When everyone cleared out, Harry noticed that Severus put several charms on the door and around the room. He did it very quickly, with sharp, short strokes of his wand. The one-word incantation was barely visible on his lips. He could’ve done it between casual conversation.
“His wife and his son have never been missing for two days! If he saw one, he’d stop and take notice.”
“I think you can help me. You knew about the curse before Nagini attacked you. Before you became a painting, therefore, your portrait knows what you knew. I’m asking you, please talk to me. Please help me figure out how to save my daughter. She seems fine now, but I know she’s sick. The same curse that affected me and Draco, is damaging her. It’s turning her into something and ruining her childhood. If you think I’m gonna turn back just because you won’t talk or want to pretend to be dead, you’re in for a rude surprise. I didn’t come to be nice. I came for information. And as much as I love you, I know you’re going to be an asshole because you always were. I’m prepared to go right through that, to get what I want.”
Narcissa’s long legs split the opening of her coat, to step over James and insert herself closest to her son.
“I know you won’t.” Foster’s fist pushed at Ash’s chest, separating their bodies. “You hid me. You let me recover in your home because you had never held magic in your hands before. The healer in you, wanted more. Now that you know what to look for, you would’ve sniffed Harry out of a thousand mediocre wizards, to own some of that strength. Let it not be said that I never gave you the magic you so desperately wanted from me. Whether or not you can withstand it, is up to you.”
She rushed to keep him from interrupting her. “The spin itself is what breathes life into your body. It’s a generator. A power supply. It’s like a loom, where instructions weave the foundation of your body and life. These can’t be corrupted. Even if someone were powerful enough to tamper with the written language of life-casting, this original record is never undone. But it can be written over with added casting, and those new changes are reversible. A man who loses his arm can get it back if he knows how to go directly to his written blueprint, where his body remains whole and perfect as the day he was born.”
I highly recommend Ester Hick's
“Really? Are you sure you’re not projecting your personal experience onto Draco’s… shortcomings?”
Harry accepted his share, but his sip was tentative and polite. He had to keep his critical thinking in top form for Draco.
“Wow, these photos really are treasures,” he said to Jipsy. What he meant was, he could see the way this woman transformed over the years and grew into more of herself. “She seems happy in this one. I’m glad she didn’t die. Can you tell me why she was disinherited?”
He looked confused. “What did you do?”
She made an agreeable noise. "Thought so. You have fresh clothing packed in your back seat. Foster won't mind taking your dinner with me then."
If Foster had said to let him sleep, then what choice did she have? Speaking of, he grabbed his keys and headed for the basement. "Don't expect I'll be back till morning."
Harry, who is a mental mess. He’s still recovering from the war. Taking care of his first child demands so much that Draco is willing to do everything he can to assist. He moved in to help him, not to fall in love with him. Everyone thinks they’re a couple, but Draco knows differently. What happened between them, only happened once, and was never supposed to happen a gain. So how can he tell him there’s another child on the way?
“But I want so much better for her. I don’t want her to suffer because I can’t get my crap under control.”
“Then he’ll be cured? He’ll wake up?”
“He is a pureblooded wizard. We do not get muggle allergies.”
Sexual abandon between them dried up after Lucius' attack. That part of their relationship was over before it started. They couldn't look at each other the same after that, and the baby required all of Draco's attention just to survive. They constantly moved from apartment to apartment, running from the public, running from Lucius. Harry had to keep up appearances to avoid prosecution in the on-going trials. Both of them were constantly forced to testify and to brave the angry mobs before their names were cleared. Draco watched his father go to Azkaban, and Harry attended seventy-two funerals before he refused to attend anymore. Nobody was feeling sexy after that.
Turns out, Kevan was booked for the next hour. “Have another drink while you wait, on me,” Natasha said. “You taking Kevan out, or you want a room here?”
This appeared to put her at ease. She stood a little straighter next to Dudley.
Now James wasn’t smiling. He let some of the annoyance he felt into his voice. “Like it or not, Draco is not a piece of land, to be signed over like a deed. My son can’t spoil him, nor can he be polluted and ruined for anyone else. Those are outdated views. Any experience the boys share with one another, can only cause them both to grow. If the marriage is nullified for any reason, anyone Draco gives himself to after that, can only benefit from what he’s learned. That’s how relationships work.”
Attacked? That made him study her with something close to patience. It rang true. But he couldn’t take the word of a stranger. “If all of that’s true, tell me about my father. What does he have to say to me?”
Harry stood in front of his bathroom mirror and used his hand to wipe the condensate away. Having taken the hottest shower he could stand, he took comfort in losing sight of his image behind clouds of steam. Just white everything out. Make it like another death and start over again at Kings Cross.
It was usually then that he did something no one else had thought of. He allowed the faces of all he honored, all he remembered, to show through his thoughts, to a gaping, mesmerized audience, as he called out their names one by one. Every person, from Severus Snape to Remus Lupin, projected from a real-life experience of Harry's, to the onlookers who had no reason to come into contact with those key players behind the scenes of the war. For five seconds, projected against a backdrop of black vapor behind Harry's head as he spoke, Voldemort stared all of them down, as he'd stared Harry down. The sight of that gaze confirmed that many of them would not have survived such an encounter. For five seconds, everyone witnessed Severus Snape turn to Umbridge and cover for Harry, saying in his most stilted voice, "I have no idea." By then, those words would've come full circle and the audience will have understood that Snape had lied to protect the truth.
He didn't mean to lie. He didn't mean to give the impression that he'd been with a man before. It was just that, if he ever had the courage to do it, why let anything ruin his chance to have it be with Harry? If there had to be a first time, who better, than the wizard he'd been obsessed with his whole life? Now was not the time to get all nervous and honest and blow it.
Remus and Sirius had been waiting inside Draco’s room with Harry. They saw her fly past the door and  looked at each other. Sirius stuck his head out just as James trudged into view. He stopped, looked in at them, and folded his arms. “Ask me if I’m happy.”
Both men looked out of place. The younger one may have dressed more modernly, but he was smaller than average and moved like a man with twice his physical strength. His grimace had captivated the crowd, whether anyone approved of such a violent display or not. He looked like a murderer in action. His determination was horrifying, yet muggles all over the suburbs could not look away from their televisions. The fact that his efforts should’ve killed his victim, but didn’t, made his appearance all the more noteworthy.
At the mention of dittany, Draco’s chest aches and he winces. Although it’s been a very long time since he has felt pain, he still dreams about that night in the bathroom. After all, that was one of worst consequences of all the bad choices he had made during his sixth year at Hogwarts.
Harry frowned. “Well, I couldn’t levitate the tree in front of the Muggles. I had to drag the tree so that I could Apparate without them knowing. Even then, I couldn’t Apparate right into the house. I could have done some serious damage. The Muggles would have noticed if I had destroyed my house,” Harry said.
As if she understood Draco’s words and is determined to prove them wrong, Noel jumps from the table and onto Harry’s lap, sending the bags of takeaway to the floor. Draco rescues them before they crash, and sends them to the kitchen with a flick of his wand.
“Solve for ‘x’,” she replies, tapping her pencil on the page.
, Vernon thinks, with a scowl on his face.
“All right. It was worth a try,” Harry says, laughing softly before kissing him.
Daisy stares at him in shock. “But Harry says you’ve published several important articles in academic journals and even have your own lab at your Ministry. How could you do that if you don’t know advanced maths?”
Draco is in for quite the surprise.
“I’m just wondering if it’s time to go back to England,” Harry said, taking a long sip of his tea. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry gauged Hermione’s reaction to going home, partly to see if he was making the right choice.
-- happy and only suggested that I add the ivy to wrap it around the other plants. He said that the ivy describes how I feel for you and that you would know what it means.”
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Draco says. He doesn’t say anything else, but Harry doesn’t need to hear any more words.
“Molly adores you!” Harry agrees. “She’s always asking about when you are going to come over and bake with her again. She says you’re a genius in the kitchen.”
When Draco takes too long to answer, Harry pulls away for a second only to press the bouquet into Draco’s hands. “As Neville was putting together the bouquet, he asked about you-- well about my date. I know I talked his ear off, but I trust him not to tell anyone until we are ready, but he was glad that I was--
“Dad, Harry’s here to see you. Is he your friend?” Daisy asks.
Tucked in the corner behind a Gryffindor Quidditch uniform that probably doesn’t fit Harry anymore, Draco finds an unfinished robin blue jumper with a white
Draco rolled his eyes. Forget civility. He would need a whole lot of alcohol if he wanted to get through this conversation, but it was far too early to start drinking. “So that I can inform Ron that when I finally left, you said that there was nothing wrong with your arm.”
Thankfully, the next box contained ornaments that were wrapped carefully in tissue paper and stored in individual compartments. Unwrapping a few, Draco could see why they were treated with such care. Each ornament was handmade, one for each year beginning with the end of the war. The one he held in his hand had a photo of Harry, Ron and Hermione smiling and waving at the photographer, while another had a yellow handprint on it with ‘Teddy’ written in turquoise.
“If you are here to judge me, then you can just leave.”
Pansy rolls her eyes. “And he’s under house arrest for the rest of his life. That’s his problem, but you should definitely buy it. It’s brilliant.”
The cold air hits his face as he steps outside and Draco looks up at the grey clouds where the snow is already coming down, painting everything white. Harry’s wish of a white Christmas came true. Draco casts the strongest Heating Charm he can, sticking his gloved hands deep in his pockets.
The flames went out in the fireplace and Draco looked up, alarmed. It was soon replaced with green flames and then two forms rushed out, tripping over the carpet, and coughing uncontrollably.
“I know we wrote sporadically, and it didn’t help that I would not always respond to your letters, but in the letters that you did send, you seemed more and more distracted. At first I put it off that you were busy with your career, or perhaps the long distance was a factor—”
Vernon avoids the blond man’s gaze as a prickle of unease settles in his stomach. Is Draco following him? Is he some sort of deranged stalker? The last time Vernon had felt this way was about ten years ago when the
“I take it back,” Harry said when they broke apart to breathe. “That might be the best Christmas present I’ve ever received.”
, the letter begins.
Once Harry makes it outside, he has to hold back his laughter. The Niffler has run down the side of the house and into the peacock pen, causing them to squawk and fan out their feathers as they are chased by the Niffler. Feathers fly everywhere and Malfoy is doing his best to stun the Niffler, but with no success. His hair is ruffled and his shirt is pulled out from his trousers. He has taken off his jacket and his shirt sleeves are rolled up past his elbow.
“Yes, I saw them. It’s no one’s fault. Get up.”
In one hand, she held her wand. With the other, she extended her arm and raised a palm. It came across as a plea to be patient with her rushed explanations.
“It’s just a toy. It’s one of the few things from my side of the family that she can have. I was just as thorough about checking it as I was the bracelet.”
“You can’t save them, my friend.” Collin spoke to no one but himself.
“Friday dinners?”
Predawn hours. A muggle condominium. A new start.
Harry didn’t know what he expected when he stepped into Thella’s tent. He knew Americans had their own classifications of magic, though the origins of voodoo lay far from North American shores. Natives of Haiti and other precolonial people influenced Christian cults as well as Pagan, but he was less familiar with them. He suspected that what popular muggle cinema had taught him, either could not be trusted or warned that one had better respect the misunderstood practice. He vaguely remembered that it was touched upon briefly during Quirrill’s term, and Lockhart had told a fascinating story about fighting off zombies, but none of that helped him now. Just because this woman had expressed gifts of clairaudience, did not mean she understood spellcraft the way he knew it. Still, he had to respect other forms of magic that apparently worked for other cultures, especially when his ignorance blinded him on the matter.
She laughed. “The spirits said you’d be too polite for your own good. I’m Thella Majorie. Mama Midnight is my professional name. I used every trick I had to get you to notice me. The spirits have led you to my tent because they have a message for you.”
Lucius answered. “It means, Mr. Potter, that you have left the world of man-made laws and a system of magic so bland that everyone is on the same skill level. This is a private world, made of private preferences. We bow to no law, except those we make up ourselves, as we go along. And little girls should not be running around in a place like this, if they value their safety.”
Her eyes fell away from him. “Snake? They’re saying Snake, but I don’t think that’s right. People are surrounded by traces of all of their identities in the spirit world. We shed the names and costumes and are known by pure identity that needs no name. If you and I had no names, we would still be who we are. So names don’t translate well, and he’s interfering.”
Instead of pouting quietly, the child let out a scream that had every head on the bus turning. He jerked to face the woman. “That is quite uncalled for! She’s done nothing wrong.”
“What happened.”
James took off his glasses and wiped his eyes. “I’m laughing at the dress and ponytail, what’re you guys laughing at?”
He’s not strong enough. Harry’s brain objected to what it saw as he strained to pick himself up. Against all reason and logic, Draco’s angular shoulders punctured a place for itself, taking the rest of the glass with it. His entire body dashed, transformed by his speed and determination, to be free of that room. He  flowed like liquid, through an opening that should’ve cut him to pieces and stopped his flight.
“I’m trying, I swear I am. Listen, everyone on the planet is like this, not just people in pictures. You want inside this picture, I’m explaining what separates dimensions. Everything that you could possibly want, represents a dimension that is waiting for you. If someone dies in your reality, only your belief bars you from interacting with them. They’re fine in their own awareness. Now, you want something. It’s out there in front of you, maybe only in your imagination. A desire. The very fact that it’s something you want and don’t have, puts it in a very specific dimension in relation to yours. Your feelings control that. Before I could talk to the deceased, I had to believe in my ability.”
"Hello?"
That was before he'd found Snape dying in the boathouse. His heart still swelled to leaden weight and sunk to the bottom of that finality. Familiar anger flared. How could someone who scared him so much, who inspired so much hatred, so much command of Harry's focus, lay helpless like that? Snape had no right to be helpless, when he'd intimidated the shit out of Harry since childhood. Nothing could be more wrong than seeing a strong, fierce man, melting in his own tears and blood, as he turned pleading eyes to Harry. Why did Harry have to see that? Why had Snape's final moments become so valuable over time? Why was his aging, stoic and severe features revealed to be so beautiful by the loss of tension in the pristine lines of his mouth? How had that horrible good-bye become precious among all the good-byes Harry had suffered through? He had to see that, he knew, so that he could take the memories when Snape finally offered them. But they were tainted memories, scrambled. There were garbled bits that made no sense. He'd only seen what Snape had wanted him to see, and those were pieced together like some kind of hasty editing job. He'd made do with it, but questions that would never have answers boiled inside of him.
“No, wait! Please, I’m trying to help, Severus I really am. He begged us for the counter curse. We were forbidden to create one. But we pitied him and left a flaw, a lock you might say, in the design.”
If beauty was a bird, Harry had just ridden on its wings. He let the wall take all of his weight, and kept himself hidden. Draco pulled out his sheet notes and showed them to Chrisaliss. “All finished. You think anybody’s going to want to hear this?”
Somewhere in the middle of that thought, anxiety lunged, real and undiluted. He grasped at the sound of hearing Draco tell Molly that he loved Harry. He’s never even spoken those words to Harry, let alone declared them so openly in front of anyone else. He may not have said them before, but his actions speak them everyday, Harry reminded himself. The bad feeling that came over him, that right now, he knew he didn’t have the faculties to give the statement the appreciation it deserved, made him realize that the spell must’ve peeked. Its effect must be lessening. He owed Draco a decent response to those words, but knew it wasn’t going to happen tonight.
“How may I assist you, Agent Potter?”
"It's a disposal, recycling system, and a rather smart one. But until you forgive yourself for what you think of as allowing your victimization, you will cross wires of natural arousal with natural aggression. The minute sex comes into play, is the minute your defenses escalate to survival mode. You just start fighting. You're still punching the person who did this to you, magically and physically. It has been very responsible, and very pragmatic of you, to lock yourself in a closet to spare your family.
“Me? My family? Who was the woman in my family?”
“Neither was I.”
Harry tuned the rest of it out in favor of going to the bed and pulling the flat object out of Draco’s mouth. He couldn’t tell if the fit was over on its own, or because of the bind. Draco looked tense, as if he were still fighting something, whether his body could express it or not.
Draco went on, “The watches still work. I’ll have to charm some more, but take what we have and use them if you need to. Don’t underestimate the trouble you could still get into in that castle. If you need me, I’ll come.”
“Son, nobody wants to do this to you. It’s degrading. You could tell us the truth, you could volunteer a medical sample. You’d be given privacy, to a degree. Listen, ignore me all you want, but do you understand that you are going to be forcibly held down while this doctor does what he has to do to get a sample from you?”
“Yeah, you know him,” Harry began, “but not really. I know I’m not making sense, but I don’t know where to begin.”
“Sorry about that, Harry!” Neville says, removing a pair of yellow earmuffs before holding out a hand to help Harry up. Dirt is caked underneath Neville’s fingernails and Harry almost slips again when he grabs the sweaty palm.
Inside the brightly lit living room, Draco takes a proper look at Harry. He’s dressed sharply, dark slacks and a white button down shirt. There are no scruffy trainers in sight, but rather polished black shoes that complement his belt. Harry’s hair is still wild and the curls that fall down in his face make Draco want to run his hands through them.
Draco felt a drop of unease start to grow in the pit of his stomach. “Harry, whatever I have done in the past, I would never use dark spells against you. I wouldn’t risk Azkaban for something as stupid as this.”
Harry feels a pang in his chest watching his best friends. While he might not have many regrets with any of his previous relationships, the major one he had was not having any children. Harry thinks he would have been a decent dad. Teddy Lupin more than fulfills that role in his life, but his godson spends the majority of his time with Andromeda and soon he would be starting his first year at Hogwarts.
Harry starts to shake his head, but then stops when he realises something. “Draco visited his father in Azkaban last weekend. He didn’t tell me about it, but I take it that it didn’t go well. He couldn’t sleep for some nights.” Harry clenches his hands into fists so hard the skin breaks. “I knew something upset him, but I didn’t want to pry. I should have been more supportive.”
It’s perfect.
, Harry thinks, as he grabs the doorknob to step inside the room, but Pansy shakes her head to stop him.
“I promise you that you’ll like it.”
Vernon struggles to speak. “What do you want?”
“Oh, I’m so sorry,” the blond man says mockingly, “I am unaware that three people behind me constitutes as a long queue. By all means, as I am still undecided, I will allow the two women behind you to place their order because they are not rude. Perhaps by the time they are done, I will have decided what I want, and you can order after me. If you don’t want that to happen, then you can wait.” He turns around before Vernon can say anything, but the two women behind Vernon start laughing.
Oh fuck. In the past, Draco and Harry had been lucky in replacing the purple betta fish before Teddy had noticed anything. It seems their luck has finally run out. It wasn’t their fault that the current fish, Mr Finny III, if Draco is counting correctly, had died while they were sleeping.
Well, for Draco at least. He hadn’t been telling the truth when he had cast the spell on Vernon Dursley, but the fool didn’t need to know that. Vernon would have severe heartburn for the rest of his life, enough to question if he was having a heart attack, if he ever thought about Harry.
“No, please listen before you say anything,” Harry says. He continues when Draco doesn’t interrupt again. “This last Auror mission made me realise how much of the world I still haven’t seen. I haven’t traveled properly and I can’t do it if I’m stuck behind a desk whenever I’m not on a mission.”
Harry smiles faintly. “Of course not. I doubt anyone could. But you see, I only had an hour to pretend to be a tourist in Florence and I saw the statue at an open market and thought of you.”
“Well, Harry’s my
“I’m sure that it was such a shock to find that out about Draco, especially for your friends and family.”
from her purse. Draco recoils, but his eyes stay on the photograph of him.
Teddy’s eyes are bright and he can’t contain his excitement. “Of course! I already help Aunt Hermione take care of Rose and Hugo.”
“I can’t. Robards ordered me to take a few days off to recuperate. He probably thought that I would stay in bed, but I’d rather decorate instead. Much better for my state of mind.”
Neville nods. “I have an idea. How about a nice cactus?”
Draco sits up straight and reaches for a book. “I have some ideas of making Wheezes toys, potions, and products. If you will allow me to explain?”
Draco shakes his head. “I’m afraid not. Harry’s the chef in the family. Anything I cook would probably be inedible.”
Draco closes the connection, already feeling better now that Pansy’s words have calmed him down. He dresses for warmth, choosing thick wool socks, a heavy jacket, and a scarf. After shrinking it, he tucks the blue jumper inside his coat pocket.
“You’re alive, as am I, because of him. You owe him so much more, but lucky for you, he doesn’t feel necessary to collect any debts. I, on the other hand,” Draco pauses, “am not that noble.”
“Sorry, yes, I was just distracted,” Draco replies, focusing on Harry’s voice “It’s just so good to hear you. Are you home yet? Give me a few minutes, I’ll be there soon.”
Draco was thankful for the change in subject. “What about your arm?” he asked, despite following Harry into the living room.
“I can’t either. Not anymore,” Harry says to a confused Dudley. “It turns out I was never supposed to be able to talk to snakes. That was a piece of magic transferred to me by the wizard who killed my parents.”
“It’s to bring you luck tomorrow,” Teddy says. “It’s a lucky rabbit’s foot.”
Draco almost chokes on his pastry. “You told them about me? When?”
“Draco, look at this!” Pansy says excitedly, “you can wear this one with Harry.” She holds up an oversized red jumper made for two people. It’s supposed to be Santa Claus and one of his elves. “Although, Harry would have to be Santa because he’s the Gryffindor with a heart of gold.”
“That’s not legal! I’ll tell your Ministry!”
“Please don’t go,” Harry said.
Draco looks even more frightened, so Harry stops in his tracks with his hands held out in front of him. “Don’t leave. Please. At least let me say something first and then if you decide to leave, I won’t stop you.”
“Draco!” Harry says and it’s so good to hear Harry’s voice. It’s not the same as waking up next to him or eating dinner in Harry’s flat whilst listening to a Quidditch match, but he’ll take it. The last few weeks of stress starts to fade away now that he knows Harry is safe.
?” Draco laughs. “For what crime? There are two main reasons you get an Improper Use of Magic letter. One is for underage magic. I’m clearly not underage, thank Merlin, and I haven’t done any improper magic.”
“We don’t have much time, Pansy, and I know how easily distracted you are when you find something interesting.”
Draco thought about sending an owl to Hermione, but decided against it. If she was not already up waiting for her husband to return, then he didn’t want to disturb her. She was heavily pregnant with her second child and already had a young daughter at home. She needed all the sleep she could get.
“Well, he’s blond and he went to Hogwarts,” Harry said, but Hermione interrupted him, saying, “Draco Malfoy. It’s him, right?”
He’s surprised to see so much Christmas merchandise. It almost feels like he’s inside Weasley Wizard Wheezes and he doesn’t know where to look. There are the traditional advent calendars marked below price, as well as lumps of coal, Santa hats, red reindeer noses and antler headbands, biros with ink that smells like peppermints, Christmas crackers with promising prizes inside, miniature nutcrackers, and, finally, Draco holds up a reindeer baby onesie outfit complete with tiny antlers.
to know that it was not going to be good news.
“We won’t,” Harry promises, just as his cousin approaches.
Harry beams at him. “I’ve had one or two of those in my lifetime.” He Summons the crystal ball again and holds it out for Draco to take. “This is actually your birthday present.”
Harry’s bright green eyes blink nervously at him. “I know you’re allergic to roses and I didn’t know your favourite chocolates, but I hope you like these,” Harry says, holding out a bouquet.
Before Granger could reply, Harry had coughed wetly, his lips trying to form words. At last he had managed a soft
“See,” she says, showing Draco her answer, “this is where I get stuck.”
Draco frowns. “What for? This isn’t his fault.”
Harry smooths out a wrinkle on Draco’s forehead (not that he would mention anything like that to Draco’s face) and kisses him. He feels Draco relax underneath him before eagerly kissing him back. When they break apart, both are gasping for breath and it fogs Harry’s glasses a bit.
Harry cleared his throat to loosen the lump stuck in there. “Actually, I don’t even know if that last part is true. We never had a chance to talk about our relationship.” Harry looked away before he could see a pitying look on Hermione’s face.
His stomach growled, reminding him that he had not eaten since arriving at the international departure point in Montreal. He had been looking forward to a homemade meal from Harry, but had to settle for a sandwich, something simple that he could make.
“Have you stayed on this couch all day?” Harry asks before he can stop himself.
The boxes threatened to fall as soon as the door opened and it took a quick spell to keep them balanced. Draco flicked his wand and had the boxes trail him back into the living room. He rekindled the fire and turned on the wireless, before sitting on the sofa and trying to see where he could start. At least the boxes were already labeled with Harry’s messy handwriting.
“Or it won’t be a proper surprise, silly!” Teddy laughs and he steps into the room holding his hands behind his back. Draco opens his mouth to decline when Harry joins Teddy and says, “Don’t worry, Draco, you’ll
“Draco! Draco!” Teddy’s excited voice carries through the flat, but he stops just before he enters Draco’s home office. A few months ago, Teddy had learned his lesson the hard way about entering Draco’s office unannounced, barging in on an experiment Draco had set up. Neither Draco nor Harry had been able to get rid of the cat whiskers on Teddy’s face for a few hours and had to finally ask Hermione for help.
“I don’t think it works like that, Harry. Doves are highly intelligent creatures and even Muggles use them in their weddings. It knew what it was doing and chose to give you the bouquet. Which reminds me, I never got to thank you properly for this wedding. You and Draco did a lovely job even if you only had a few weeks to help me plan it.”
As Ginny, Ron and Pansy have an animated conversation about Ron’s birthday party, Harry turns to look at Draco properly. “Are you enjoying yourself?” Harry asks reaching over to wipe a smear of icing off the corner of Draco’s mouth. His eyes darken as he watches Draco licking his lips.
“What are you asking, Harry?” Draco whispers.
“How’s your arm?” Draco said, his last chance to be civil.
Draco doesn’t have a chance to respond before Harry Potter enters the Great Hall and the students begin to whisper and point at him.
Harry takes a chance and goes to sit down next to Draco. “So I took a year off and wanted you to travel with me.”
“What are you doing? You don’t use a feather to solve calculus problems.”
His secretary has his second cup ready as soon as he walks through the office door. As usual, he doesn’t greet her, but rather grabs the cup and sits down at his desk, turning the computer on to start another dull day at Grunnings.
“I’ll do no such thing unless you stay and fight!” the knight responds. Draco sends a Stinging hex, smiling when the knight hisses in pain.
Draco buries his head against Harry’s neck, the short hairs tickling Harry. “Well, let’s try not to have an argument for a year, then. I want us to enjoy this holiday.”
Draco returned to the living room with his sandwich and cup of coffee and sat down on the lumpy sofa that Harry insisted on keeping. A quick wave of his wand had a fire burning so that he wasn’t in shadows. He was dead tired, but wanted to stay awake until Harry arrived. Sighing, he reached down and plucked a random book out of the messenger bag he had brought from Montreal.
When Harry peeks inside the room, his heart breaks yet again.
At those words, Harry can’t help but laugh. “I know exactly how you feel. Is your dad home?”
“At least that’s a start,” Harry says, laughing. “Goodbye! I love you,” he says.
“Draco,” Harry calls out again, pausing when he hears a mumble coming from the living room. That’s unusual. Usually during this time of day, Draco would still be in his lab brewing potions for a research project, singing along to the Wireless, although he would never admit to it.
“That’s my fault,” Dudley says, his face turning slightly red, “but I hope it’s not too late to fix that.”
“Andromeda left us a box that the primary school used on the Muggle children. I’m sure that it should work for you.” Harry Summons the box he left on the kitchen counter and hands it to Draco, who scans it quickly before scowling.
“Harry, anytime I visited, we were too busy having sex to talk at all.”
“Hermione, there was no chance to explain,” Ron says. “As soon as Charlie arrived, he saw Harry, kissed him, and the next thing we knew, they were broken up.” He shrugs his shoulders when Harry shoots him a glare. “I didn’t know why Malfoy was there, though.”
Harry takes a chance and stands right next to Malfoy, bumping shoulders with him. “Tell me if I’m wrong, but I think the only reason you objected to me kissing you was because I was still with Charlie, right?”
just for blinking. I care about you and don’t want you to get backlash from the public. They’ll spread lies and stories all the time just to ruin your life.”
The smaller pile that remains is just clothes. A splash of red stands out from the pile, looking very familiar and upon closer inspection, Harry sees that it’s his threadbare t-shirts, his jeans with holes in the knees, and a pair of trainers with the sole starting to rip apart.
“Teddy, dear, Draco is an only child and he hasn’t been around children that much. Give him a little more time and you’ll see that he likes you just as much as Harry does.”
“I saw it in one of Hermione’s history books and asked Dean Thomas to make a replica. Unlike the original, it’s not made of gold, but I hope you like it.”
Harry thinks.
“Sounds perfect!”
“It’s a letter from my cousin Dudley.”
did not reveal a note from Harry. Still, Draco walked through the house, opening and closing each door until he returned to the kitchen.
Draco presses his lips in a thin line, just so that nothing negative escapes his mouth. He doesn’t like the way Harry has said
“Are you going to open it?” Draco asks.
the paper. “That’s rubbish. Make them print out a retraction. Or an apology though I doubt you’ll get that. I’m surprised Ron didn’t say anything yesterday when dropping you off. What about the other Weasleys? Or Nick? What does he think about this?”
Harry beams at him. “See, that wasn’t so bad. I think we should do this more often. I think you would look great in my Muggle clothes. Perhaps I should buy you some dark denims, trainers, joggers, or even a hoodie since it’s still cold.”
Draco specialised in self-sabotage. “No. If you are talking about me, then that is ridiculous. You hardly even know me.”
Draco frowns. “No, I don’t think so. What if one of us needed to use the loo? We’d have to go in there together.”
“It isn’t your fault,” Harry protested.
“We won’t need that,” Pansy says. “I would bet my entire fortune that he’s at my flat in Paris. It’s his place to go when he needs space from everything happening in London.”
When she throws down her pencil in frustration, Draco can’t ignore it anymore and he sets down the potions journal. “Is there something wrong?”
, Draco thinks, grinning. He loves surprises and gifts, particularly if it’s one of Mrs Weasley’s desserts. He quickly unlocks the door, saying “Come in, Teddy.”
Instead, the living room was dark and cold, silent except for the sound of his own footsteps as he tried not to bump into things. Draco slowly dropped his messenger bag and held his wand out,
Draco takes off his coat and pokes his wand in the fireplace to light it. It doesn’t even come close to warming him. He desperately needs a hot shower. With a wave of his wand, he sends his shopping bags to the kitchen and makes his way to Harry’s bathroom.
written underneath in white letters. Next to it, there’s a green jumper with a red stocking on the front that has a wine bottle tucked inside. The last mannequin wears a simple purple jumper with sequin letters that asks
But tonight is different. It’s just the two of them with a troubled past, but still, Harry is standing outside Draco’s front door and that has to count for something.
There was silence in the room and Draco had a feeling that Harry was trying to figure out a way to get out of this conversation. He just continued to eat, ignoring Draco, who finally had enough of Harry’s evasiveness.
sign on the door would have sufficed if you can’t ward the greenhouse,” Harry says as he Vanishes the dirt. He puts pressure on his left foot and thankfully feels no pain.
“I can’t believe you thought the jumper was for a baby,” Pansy says once Amy has left.
.” The white smoke vanishes and Harry uses his Seeker’s reflexes to catch it before it hits the ground. He turns to Draco, smiling and lacing their fingers together, squeezing gently. “Actually, it’s us.”
“I do,” Draco says, kissing him. “After all, you gave me a second chance and forgave me. I just hope Dudley doesn’t waste his chance.”
Harry hesitated. “What about Ron?”
Amy nods. “That’s a popular choice. I think that’s the last one. Let me go grab that jumper for you.”
A loud knock on the door distracts Harry from his thoughts. Harry looks up to see Charlie Weasley step inside the kitchen and set a leather suitcase down on the table.
at the Niffler, who manages to dodge it at the last second and follow Charlie out the door.
Harry took a deep breath and let it out slowly. This was going to be one of the most interesting and hardest conversations he ever had with Hermione. Harry decided he was going to tell her about Draco in the vaguest terms possible.
Harry raises an eyebrow. “I don’t read the
He stares out the window, wondering if he should call Harry to ask for help. All the shops they pass are either closed, or food shops, which are no help to him at all.
As usual, Harry falls out of the fireplace, but Pansy does not offer to help him up, already running to the door that must be Draco’s bedroom. Her heels clack against the wood floors almost as fast as Harry’s heart is beating.
Harry scratches the back of his head. “Well, no, but Hermione helped me. You’ll have to ask her about the research she did in the Department of Mysteries.” He leans closer, tucking his head on Draco’s shoulder. “You actually gave me idea.”
Harry shakes his head even though he knows Draco can’t see. “You know I can’t do that. Please look at me, Draco.”
“Why don’t you go and take a shower, Teddy. You can help me with dinner and then eat those delicious biscuits Grandma Molly made,” Harry says, to which Teddy eagerly nods and runs out of the room.
“Harry, go find a nice box for Mr Finny,” Draco says, ushering a still sniffling Teddy out of the kitchen. They settle down in the soft sofa in the living room and Draco lays Teddy’s head on his lap.
Draco nods. Even the greasy pizza will be better than whatever he attempts to cook. “Order one with pineapple on top.”
“What are you doing? You’re not supposed to be using your arm for anything,” Draco said. He flicked his wand to make the tree lightweight and then dragged the rest inside, slamming the door behind him. Harry took off his hat and gloves and started unraveling the scarf from around his neck. His eyes sparkled and his face was red from the cold wind.
“This is not helping you at all, Potter,” Draco says through clenched teeth. “If you go any further, those might be the last words you say,” Draco warns.
“No, I’ve read your mind” Draco says, his voice cold. “The way you treated him, like he was no better than a servant, was unnatural. You never even tried to love him and instead made him feel like he was no one. All he wanted was the love and approval of his family. I thought my father was awful, but you are much worse.”
“I don’t know if it’s the right time for this, Harry, but I wanted to speak to you about this morning.”
Harry lets out a startled laugh. “What? I thought you would be trying to convince me not to go.”
Dudley rubs the back of his neck. “Honestly, it started out with small things. She would be eating her food and anything she didn’t like would disappear. Or one time she climbed a tree and then jumped off the highest branches without even a scratch on her. But all those could be explained away.”
before giving Draco his wand.
“Show-off,” Draco whispers, but the way his eyes are glued to the crystal ball reveal he’s intrigued. “What do you see?”
startles Draco and he looks over at the closet entrance. Harry’s older cat, Holly, stares unblinkingly at him, her orange fur standing on end. She leaps up at him, sinking her claws into the jumper.
“You cannot convince me otherwise,” Draco replied.
After the quickest shower Draco has ever taken in his life, he is finally dressed in his Hogwarts uniform. He’s standing in front of the mirror for one last look when he realises that he’s forgotten to put on a tie.
Draco used his wand to
“Of course. Everyone has spoiled me with gifts. And as much as you’d like me to think that you did this on your own, I’ll have to give Pansy and Ginny a huge thank you gift for providing the entertainment and Molly for the delicious food.” Draco lowers his voice, forcing Harry to lean closer if he wants to hear. “However, there is one thing that’s missing.”
“Do you mind if I use magic?” Draco asks her.
Draco shakes his head. “That’s not how it works, Potter.”
When Harry steps out of the fireplace, brushing Floo powder off his Auror uniform, he freezes in his tracks. Draco is sleeping on the sofa, his blond head visible beneath one of Molly’s quilts that she had gifted them when they had first moved in together. On the table in front of him is an empty bottle of wine and a book is splayed upside-down on the floor - one that Draco must have been reading before he had fallen asleep. A whispered
Draco gets up from the table and walks over, picking up Daisy’s homework. On the paper there are numbers, letters, infinity symbols, brackets, and numbers under check marks. None of it makes any sense.
“I have a surprise for you,” Harry says as they sit on a bench in the gardens at the Burrow. They had just finished a wonderful Easter meal prepared by Mrs Weasley and were now enjoying a glass of wine before saying their goodbyes.
“There’s no one quite like Draco,” Harry says when they finally pull apart. “Did you know he eats pizza with a knife and fork?”
“No, just be the person you are when you’re with me. Play with him and ask him a lot of questions, but most of all, love him for who he is and not for the person you expect him to be. Maybe then he won’t curse you with lice.”
Although Harry was expecting to hear that, it was still a punch to the gut. He had been friends with Ron and Hermione for so long that he couldn’t imagine them being apart for the rest of his life.
“And Luna,” Pansy adds as Draco drops the two small reindeer jumpers in the shopping basket Amy has provided.
Malfoy sneers. “Why should I care?”
“I heard you broke my brother’s heart,” Harry hears a voice say behind him. Before he can turn around to see who it is, there’s a wand jabbed between his shoulder blades. “If you give me one good reason why, then maybe I won’t cast a Bat Bogey Hex on you.”
, Draco thinks as he searches for the source of the song. The words, once joyful, now grate on his nerves as he searches all his pockets. He quickly fishes out the cell phone that Harry had bought him right before he left. Draco’s hardly used it as he has no one to ring except for Harry.
also won’t work and he doesn’t dare use magic on the cats. The only option left is to bribe them.
After the third giggle that escapes from her mouth, Vernon's had enough. “For Christ’s sake, stop flirting! Can’t you see there's a long queue?” he shouts at the barista. “Open another register!”
. As Draco makes his way over to her, he sees Granger and Weasley at the Gryffindor table, deep in conversation. Granger is frowning, whilst Weasley tries to take a bite of everything on his plate at once.
“No, he’s still dead,” Draco says. He flicks his stick to move the chair in front of Vernon’s desk back a few feet. “Have a seat, I’m not here to harm you. In fact, I’m here to ask you a simple question.”
Vernon stands there fuming. How dare he imply that he, Vernon, is rude? The nerve of the man to suggest that he would purposely make him wait! By the time he is working himself up to a proper response, the blond man is ready to place his order.
“What?” Harry says, confused. But then he gets a proper look at Draco and his face softens. He takes the tie from Pansy and loosens the knot. After a moment’s hesitation, Harry puts up a Silencing Charm, much to Pansy’s displeasure.
“Draco, I’m sorry, you know I can’t. I always spend Christmas at the Burrow. I especially need to be there this year. Everyone is visiting Molly now that she has fully recovered from dragon pox. I can’t change my plans.”
Draco reaches into his pocket and pulls out a vial filled with a pale orange liquid. “The cure is to drink three doses for the next twenty-four hours. It kills everything.”
Draco takes it from her. Immediately, he can tell that the jumper is poorly made, as there are several threads pulled loose. He’ll have to use tailoring spells so that the rough fabric won’t scratch his skin too terribly. He hides his frown from Amy, who has been nothing but helpful. It’s not her fault that the jumper is subpar.
“What?” Draco whispers.
“What are you trying to do?”
“The first time I saw that, I was shocked and picked her up and took her to the kitchen to get away. At the time, I thought it was a trick of the mind, but then Daisy kept levitating different things: her teddy bear, chocolate sweets Julia had hidden from her, and even Sunny’s lead to go for a walk. I didn’t know how to mention it to my wife, because things only ever happened when it was just Daisy and me. Until one day Julia saw Daisy have a tantrum and make a dinner plate shatter without even touching it. That’s when I had to tell her that magic is real.”
Ron gives Draco a genuine smile. “Look, your NEWTs were excellent, better than any of the other applicants. Only one less than Hermione, mind you,” he says with a proud look on his face.
“Yes, thank Merlin. I can’t imagine you as anything other than blond.”
“Old habits die hard, I think,” he admits. “But if I call him that, it would certainly surprise him. He surprised me every week when we helped you with the wedding planning. He’s no longer the bully he was at Hogwarts.”
and I understood why you felt that way. I seemed to have ruined your privacy with another one of my careless actions. I had half a mind to go and pack my things to leave.”
“That should be interesting,” Harry says. “At least your mother likes me.”
Draco scoffs and opens his eyes. “No one’s going to buy food from a Death Eater, Harry,” he begins, but Harry shakes his head.
“Hey, Draco, for what it’s worth, I’m sorry too. We both didn’t communicate properly, but we can learn from this, okay? This is not the worst argument we’ve had, and I doubt it will be the last.”
“Me, surprise you? What do you mean?”
Harry chokes on his bite of cake, coughing loudly as he tries to clear his oesophagus. After a few frightening seconds, Harry feels Hermione’s magic wash over him as his airway clears and he can finally breathe properly again. Taking several deep breaths, Harry repeats her question. “Apologise for what?”
“My name is Harry and his name is Draco--“
In Harry’s opinion, Malfoy has never looked as gorgeous as he does now.
“Oh, pardon me,” Draco replies. “Let me make up for my horrible behaviour.” In a matter of seconds, Draco casts several spells that clear Harry’s airways and Vanishes any trace of shampoo from his eyes. Harry doesn’t admit it out loud, but he loves when Draco uses wandless magic.
He stared hard at that question and at Arthur. “Probably more. He deserves her. I’m just complicating things.” He risked a lingering look into the other man’s eyes. “I’m too messed up to raise her.”
“I don’t need anyone’s help.”
It wasn’t just the physical pain. Difficulty breathing had woken him up. He appeared to be under frayed, hand-made blankets, not department store synthetics. From what he could tell, he lay upon hardwood, cushioned by a crude mattress of potato sacks. Another sort of makeshift bed sat adjacent to his. Someone lay there, covered up to their head, not making any noise. It took waking up to the sight three times before he realized that a corpse lay there. Panic had him struggling to sit up, to bolt, but he couldn’t seem to work his muscles right. His movement was limited and he had to lie there and wait out his hysteria. He lay there for so long next to the body, he had no choice but to return to his senses and observe his surroundings.
Again, he turned to Lucius and spoke as if they were the only two there. “Judging by the strain on his magic, I doubt he has rested properly in years. Rest alone, would see his body emptied of its burdens. But he has not been convinced to let that happen until today. No matter how it looks, he is resting for the first time in a long time. This is what your shelter and your marriage affords him. Be patient. He’s not accustomed to receiving comfort. He’s not accustomed to being valued without proving himself. That’s what all the promises and contracts assailing him, are about.”
“I wasn’t going to escape, how could I? I just barely pulled on the strands of your magic. I’m helpless. Now I can hardly see. I’ve never been so disgusted in my life.”
The words startled him as much as they startled Jasper. He had never relied on such an excuse before, but there was something about being expected to drop his pants so easily, especially if his whole team thought so, that made him dig in his heals. So he was basically a famous slut to them? “And even if I weren’t, being invited to play with you all is a privilege I’d rather not fuck up by getting involved with my teammates. The people who published that photo, are just waiting on me to screw up. My mistakes are their livelihoods. I signed a contract to conduct myself professionally and I’m going to, so please don’t make anymore advances towards me. I’ll have drinks with you, but that’s all. And by drinks, I mean water.”
Snape made a point of leaning down, ignoring his own pain. His hair fell forward.
“And let Harry and Draco suffer indefinitely?” She shook her head. “This isn’t about you and your fears. Our son-in-law needs help. You know as well as I do, that he’s our best hope.”
Draco’s arm hurt from keeping it outstretched for so long. Narcissa stepped close enough to lay her hand on it.
Draco looked nervously from Severus, to everyone watching him.
“Or water.”
Snape’s portrait was no longer grimacing, but looking with suspicion and appall at the photo. His mouth had gone slack, offended, and unable to recover. Harry thanked Eileen for this effect. He couldn’t have done it without her.
Okay, maybe this was all in his mind. Just nerves. Stress. It takes a lot of energy to constantly maintain this level of professionalism. He had a lot to make up for. His mind was playing tricks, just because Harry was good looking. But that’s all. He could admit that without going crazy. Just go on greet him. Get it over with. You’re not a child, you don’t have to fear what excites you. Face it and let it go.
It took another second before he made up his mind. Eileen put down the hoop and nestled her baby against her. She kept her eyes on Harry.
The temptation to come back as soon as he could, and hike on foot for a few days, itched at him. When would he have that much time? The fuel gauge on the dash, told him it didn't matter. He needed to get gas. It wasn't mandatory, before dropping the jeep off, but it was the decent thing to do. He was slightly nauseated from driving for hours on an empty stomach, and grabbed some crisps and a candy bar while he was at it. He took time to eat them on the side of the road once he'd driven from the pump. What he was really doing, he admitted, was stalling.
“Okay, okay.”
Foster turned stiffly, and measured out toying words. "To have questions, is one’s right. To demand answers, is one’s folly. What did you see?"
Eileen wore braids in all but two, and had a healthy tone to her complexion, but that was all he could say of her attractiveness. She looked too defensive to be concerned with her looks. Even the ones with her long hair down, and wearing more grown up dresses, she looked like it was all a waste of her time and she wanted to be doing something else. Unlike the mother, who used the opportunity to brighten her dark eyes with make-up, and sweep her hair into curls that piled and spilled from graceful hats and scarfs. Ladoria decorated her ears and throat with flashy jewelry that took pride in her wealth. Her smile was generous and made her truly pretty, in a motherly sort of way. She was even a bit plump and tended to smile mid-laugh in all of her photos, as if she were a fairly jolly personality. Harry liked her.
Avi continued uneasily. “Believe me, Harry, I didn’t want to have to tell you this. I’m trying to prepare you for seeing the proof yourself. I’ve only seen it for myself this morning. Given that this is a private nature, the ability could be more common than is known. Her magic was, perhaps, always going to show itself in this way. Or something very specific is causing it to react this way. Regardless, we will watch her and find out what we can do to give her a stable life as she grows into the ability. Who knows, it might be something she can grow out of. Adults leave behind childhood conditions all the time. They outgrow the need for glasses, allergies, stutters, who knows if this will even be a permanent part of her life. It may just last for the duration of her reaction. I don’t know, but I will do everything in my power to investigate and tell you as much as I can.”
She paused, turning red, swollen eyes to him. “He’s leaving this house with me.”
“Iskween! Esha cannhave iskweem wit me.” A big jump left her picking herself up again. When she looked up, Elsa held a huge lime-green ice cream cone in her hand and licked it.
“Me, and my baby.”
Harry’s friends remained in position. Their eyes darted left to right, to see which of them would break formation and follow her. Hermione took the lead. She wanted to see this ceremony. “We can help her clear the room.”
He tried to be brave. But he closed his eyes and refused to face it head on. The act. Penetration. He wanted it, but it was too overwhelming a thing to stare at. Like looking down the barrel of a gun. When Harry took off his jeans, he couldn't believe what he was seeing. In tufts of ferociously black hair, all tender silk and bullet emergence, asking to be touched, straining to reach him from roots of thick darkness that grew up Harry's belly.
Israel.
“I’ve heard, Mr. Potter, that the truth of that child’s parentage, would’ve changed the entire outcome of the trials. I’ve heard that Draco Malfoy is no more the birth-father of that little girl than I am. I’ve heard that evidence is mounting against your character, that you suffer severe depression for all the lies you’ve told, that sent innocent people to prison, and kept murderers from going. That two days ago, the incident at O’Hair was a suicide attempt, one of many, and that the little girl you’re both raising, is your birth-daughter, not Draco’s.”
Draco cringed, still smiling. He thought he’d gotten out of it.
“The ghosts of children were your playmates?” It sounded too sad to laugh at, even as Harry said it. No wonder Draco had taken up with Crabbe and Goyle at school. After sad ghost kids, those two must’ve been a blast.
He sounded incredulous, and it occurred to Harry that, while it was around midnight in the UK, it must’ve been early evening here. He couldn’t tell. He wasn’t prepared.
“The circle is not complete. There’s someone missing.” He paused. “If you come forward, you will be able to help Draco in ways that no one else here could.”
“Can I come?” Petunia asked. Lily looked inquisitive at Severus.
He said softly, “I’ll tell you when I’m ready.” The words are hardly out before he’s averting his eyes.
His words had been like ointment massaged into Draco’s soul. “I need you now, and not just to help with Iece. You’ve done everything for me, and I couldn’t get you out of my heart if I wanted to. So you might as well get a proper welcome, sorry it took so long. Wherever I go, I want you there too. Ride with me.”
While turning the possibilities over in his mind, he leapt to the conclusion that he would need assistance in guiding Harry to the appropriate actions for causing his cure. Someone would have to act in his stead. Someone would have to get Harry’s attention for him. It would be best if this were a magical person, but there might be an advantage to having magic go undetected in a non-magical person. The only non-magical person he knew to have proven himself that helpful, who would want that job, was imprisoned dimensions away, right in front of him.
He stopped himself from thinking about those times, and Lily’s death, and trying to keep their son alive. There was only forward. He had a dead and dying wizard on his hands, a grown son being hunted and hunting him – he could not let himself be found – and a granddaughter expressing her magic too erratically, too early. He felt it was a sign of her generational magic, and his own mother having the last say in the power she stored for him. Lucius had fucked everything up, starting with his own son.
“So it’s not the photograph?”
“Neither can he.”
Ash remembered the day he got up his nerve to ask. Foster had been moving about without assistance for a month. Outwardly, his wounds were mere scars, but the venom had damaged his nervous system. His speech, and motor coordination needed more time. He walked with a cane. Ash had had reservations about leaving his granddad’s old stick by the bed, but once it proved to be useful as an impersonal tool, Foster took to it. Anything that spared him physical dependency upon Ash, was welcomed.
They stood and shuffled out of the eating area. Harry commented, “The lights have stopped.”
Draco’s glare said prove it.
“And I’m his real mother. Promise me, no more cracks about Severus and his partner. I mean it.”
Update: I actually have written stuff for this pic, but the story that wants to come is so much more complicated than what I can express right now. I think I'm wanting to see the movie before I decide on some things. Do I want to use Tom's character, or the actor himself in an RPF? There's a bigger story here and it's not time to write it yet.
He sat up, colorless, and winding his sheets through fretful grips that drew them into fisted knots. The way distrust emanated from him, he reminded Harry of a caged animal. Terrified to find itself alive and at the mercy of another.
He wanted to look at her, to see what she knew, but the dragon held him captivated. He was tempted to forget about his own patronus, but the stag glowed fiercely beside his chair, as if serving as a reminder that he must keep it active. He must keep it bright and focused in the moment.
James looked disconcerted. “What feelings about Harry?”
Before it became important to kill Harry, Voldemort offered to hand him over to the Organization in exchange for global resources that would allow him to impress upon the non-magic world how much they needed to cooperate with him. Money is of no value to people behind the curtain of world puppetry. But magic gets their attention. They are not wizards, but neither are they the same as humans. They hide behind official administrations the world over, and are not limited to this planet. Individually, the only strength they have, is the ability to absorb human sentience as a bio-energetic sustenance. People generate emoliates. Emotional life force. The Organization is headed by entities who live for eons off of the calamities of human hysteria. Earth is a farm to them. Masses are sacrificed for their nutrition. Magical people are little more than a delicacy. And the very powerful, are kept alive to be used as expenditures when needed.
The touch on his shoulder was light and delicate. “Harry, I’d like for you to meet a friend of mine. He can help Draco. I’m sure of it.”
“That’s what you’re doing. That’s what everyone who believes in struggle and hardship is doing. They’re misunderstanding the mechanics of their minds and using physical effort to compensate. That’s fine for a baby learning to take steps, but when people spend all their energy fighting battles, they wear out their bodies, and they don’t know what else to do. Like that baby, you have no idea that if you would just always put your right foot in a certain position, followed by your left, you will go towards the object of your desire every single time, with minimal effort and the most fun. Are you still with me?”
"Of course. I'd rather you leave her with me for the night and go calm yourself, than do whatever ungodly thing you're about to do."
“The old home. The one that sits in Jipsy’s room. There many children spirits who play there and remember Draco. They say he was very fond of playing with them when he was a child. He spent hours pretending to live in those rooms with them. They miss him, and are very glad that he has brought the model estate with him to his new home. They hope that one day they can meet you, Sir, and thank you for taking him out of that dreary state of affairs that made him so lonely.”
“Bathroom?” Wanda was guessing.
He pulled back from the picture, withdrawing his attention. This wasn’t right. It was like she was pulling information from his mind…
The records noted how 'Mr. Potter's testimony differs from the evidence found at the crime scene' and went on to conclude that, 'Resulting discrepancies are due to the window of time in which the fallen body of Severus Snape lay unguarded while the battle on the grounds of Hogwarts came to its tragic close. Aurors determined the body to have been vandalized by enemies of Snape and allowed a magical testing of the wand to stand as confirmation of the deceased. Both wand and body were 'honored by fire' in a cremation ceremony attended to by four hundred colleagues and former students wishing to pay tribute.
“Is there something else going on? This isn’t just about your dad, is it?”
"You believe? You stood right there and applied stringent faith instead of listening to the conversation?"
“Under different conditions. The magic that wanted to be your human son, is still willing and available. It’s always with you.”
Narcissa’s heart broke as Draco’s face reflected the breaking of his body upon Harry’s entrance. She stayed strong. She told herself, if she could withstand it, he could too. He was just confused and afraid, but soon he was going to understand that there’d been no way around this. He was a strong boy. A good boy.
“That only proves that I rely on myself, not the one giving orders.”
Harry got it all set up. Draco came home for lunch, to the sight of Iece still in the undershirt and Harry in rolled up pant legs, in the pool together. They were having a splash fight. He walked in at exactly the moment that Iece squeezed her eyes shut and thrashed her arms as hard as she could to get the water to cover Harry the way he got it to drench her. The undershirt clung to her, and she rather looked like a giant, unfortunate and hilarious sperm, with her hair done up, making her head seem bigger than it was. She was nothing but belly and head, swaddled in wet cotton. Sunlight brought out the sparkle in the whitest parts of her hair, and lit the moment in a way that arrested Draco.
(To be continued…  in another pic fic that I have in mind) :-)
“You didn’t make it worse, you put an end to it. Or your magic is trying to. Draco is fighting it.”
This confused him. He couldn’t see her giving up one of her babies. Not even if she had a hundred, with no way of caring for them. She was one of those bleeding heart people who thought love could fix everything.  He stared at her through his fingers.
He stared from his glass to her. “Are we even talking about the same thing?”
The impact knocked him back. The surprise of it, knocked him on his ass. When that thing looked right at you, so that you could see razor slit pupils in its wet, murky eyes, you knew it wasn’t make-up. You knew those raised scales were real, like thick armored sleeves of puckered skin around the sockets. It blinked, a membrane wiped diagonally across the gelatinous lens, faster than Harry could process. In that split second, an odor wafted between them and Harry understood that it wasn’t angry with him, just confused. Then came greater comprehension. It suddenly knew that Harry had never seen anything like it before, and forgave him on the spot. It couldn’t help its appearance, which would naturally be interpreted by humans as aggressive, without modification and it was not convenient to modify itself at that moment. It was going on vacation to be away from humans and to appear natural, not fake. Its posture allowed Harry to take his fill in curiosity.
There’s a phenomenon in quidditch known as
She nodded, seemingly unsurprised. “I’ll see what I can do. Storms like this produce tunnel clouds, like an upside down funnel. Huge at the bottom, small at the top. They spiral to and from other places. We have a window before the top closes. When it does, I don’t think anyone will be able to apparate inside anymore. We’re being given time to prepare.”
Draco answered immediately. “It’s the name of a confidential ward. For security. The more impacting a secret, the stronger the security will be around maintaining it. She’s telling you that if you know the name of the ward used, there’s a possibility you can undo it. She wants you to know.”
“He’s hungry,” he told Harry. “And I’m not feeding him.”
Draco grinned at the sound of alertness and focus in Harry’s question. “Home,” he shouted over the wind, and angled his broom for the rooftop of their flat.
“Let her feed us. She obviously wants to do something helpful.”
The highlighted tips of Jasper’s hair, whirled past Harry and into the showers.
The pavilion was packed with magical people from all over the world, and the nonmagics who could be trusted to mingle among them without freaking out. The atmosphere was that of a carnival, with food stands, children’s rides, and open stages roped off around the main square. The smell of spun sugar and peppered sausages reminded him that he could not have eaten if he wanted to. And he couldn’t remember the last time he ate. Some twenty school children in matching neon orange T-shirts, crossed in front of him. Their shirts read ‘Saunders Sharks’ and glowed like frisbees sailing in front of the sun. The sight hurt his eyes and reminded him of Dudley tossing the muggle toy with his friends ages ago.
“Okay.” Lily clasped her hands, making it sound like a fun new game they could all play. Since Draco appeared to sway on his feet and every second had Harry glancing to make sure he was still attached to him, she just wanted to put everyone out of their misery.
He wants to grab Harry and take him from this place. Spare him this public trial by fire, for a more private one. Fear makes Harry look far younger than nineteen, and Black finds that exciting. Harry’s muscles flex to take flight, but remain pinned under the efforts of those larger men. He’s gurgling and spewing saliva and nonsense now. His name calling has gotten more obscene, and hysterics have taken over his voice. It was one thing to hold up in one’s room with one of these toys, but to have a gangbang thrust upon you from a lineup of uniformed men, who pulled you out of your pants like they owned you, and have it all filmed, was always more than sane individuals could take. Harry’s face crumples on emotion he can’t hide.
“Don’t you love them?” He meant to use the word ‘honor’ but what he really felt crept in.
Lily’s shush, was the shush to end all shushes. “Dammit! I will not have you hurt his feelings.”
By the time Banks waved to passing officials, paused to shake hands with two campaign managers, have his photo taken with a mother and her baby, Harry was bracing himself to move forward and not give up on the whole day. It was as if he’d left his soul in bed and his body was just walking around faking it, without the resources to see it through. Whatever Banks wanted, he wasn’t in a very cooperative mood. He kept his head down and pretended to be invisible all the way to the set of offices the Minister was currently holding as his own.
James backed down, but followed. Lily trailed behind him. Once everyone saw that not even she was protesting, beacon of all things righteous that she was, they joined in. The Malfoys, who could not be coaxed any closer into the fray, waited in the next room, eyeing their tea service, and each other, with weary anticipation. This had gone on long enough, yet neither wanted to be the first to suggest they actually leave their son to work out his problems with this family. When they saw a long line of Potters  marching past the room, they refused to be left out of whatever new development they were not being told about.
The two could hardly believe it when their parents got up from the table and left them with the room to themselves. Draco was the first to stand, and Harry understood why. His long legs must’ve needed stretching. He turned his back to Harry, pulled at the base of his spine and walked to the far end of the room where floor-to-ceiling windows flattered his vertical shape among them. The windows overlooked the Potter’s modest garden, but since everything was in bloom, thanks to his mother’s magic, Draco’s slender build was cast in the most favorable botanical background imaginable. Harry smiled at the thought of having Draco live here, coming and going and sharing this house with him.
“Tell me,” Harry whispered. “Why do you still want it?”
“I know, and I admit it’s terribly unfair to you. But here you are, and no one does it alone, dear. You shouldn’t have to. No matter what sort of trouble Harry gets himself into, you’re not alone. Arthur and I will help you. You can trust us.”
Draco’s head snapped up. “Look, I know what you want. You want me to talk. To tell you all about that curse. Now that Harry isn’t here, you think I’m just going to open up to you. It’s not going to happen.”
“If you scare them, they shouldn’t be in your life to begin with.” Draco sounded certain. “Life is too short to go tiptoeing around other people. You have to be yourself. I never want to keep another secret ever again. That’s what I’ve learned.”
Baby Sev kept playing. The marks shocked and repulsed Harry, but he forced himself to look at her. Just because he wasn’t comfortable right now, didn’t mean that he didn’t value every confusing sentence out of her mouth. He noticed how she caused the bruises to appear and disappear at will.
Draco managed to get the undershirt back up on her, and Harry abandoned Elsa for a moment, in favor of dashing a transformative wave over her and turning the shirt into something that resembled a simple dress. He was worried about the use of magic directly upon her, but couldn’t say no to this tiny indiscretion, especially when she was so thrilled by it all. He could’ve done a better job, had he not been trying to hold Elsa together. Iece was just happy to be in the air. She started waving her arms and legs and trying to do everything Elsa was doing. They got her high enough that they both had to look up at her as they let her dance. Harry slowed Elsa’s form and Draco carried Iece closer to her. As the boys found their rhythm, they joined the two floating bodies in a sporadic waltz, the clumsiest either had ever seen, as Elsa and Iece swirled on a spiral of soft magic together.
“Okay,” Harry replies. He picks up the letter and begins to read.
When Louis had seen no progress with his gestures, he had taken to accidentally touching Draco, whether it be leaning against him whilst they read documents, or clasping their hands together to pull through the crowded hallways.
Despite his better judgement, he turns around to find Draco walking behind him.
If Draco wanted to pursue a relationship, he needed to get a few things off his chest. He decided to start with the newspaper debacle as it was the easiest and most recent.
For the first time since seeing Draco, Vernon smiles. If Draco is here for an interview, then there's no way in hell that he will get hired. Vernon will absolutely make sure to let Human Resources know what an absolute creep the man is. He exhales and takes a sip of tea.
“Are you running away from this?” Pansy asks as she pulls out the
“I don’t,” Harry says. He reaches up to comb through Draco’s silky hair. “Do you know you still have confetti in your hair?”
Julia’s home office is the Muggle version of Hermione’s office at the Ministry. An entire wall is covered with bookcases crammed with books. Multiple diplomas are displayed behind a desk that is neat and organised, but stacked with several inches worth of paperwork. Painted on one wall are different structural formulas of chemical compounds.
“Well, you see, there’s this bloke that I’ve known for over half of my life that I can’t stop thinking about. He was a prat at school, but he’s changed. And I want to get to know him better to see if anything could come of it.”
He reaches out and slowly takes the envelope, startling when the ferret squeaks and jumps off the table. Draco opens and scans the letter, his eyes widening when he sees what’s written. The contract states that he is to work with the Weasleys at their joke shop, but he has his own lab and can work on other projects in his spare time, if he so chooses.
“Hmph,” Draco says, but he’s not as irritated as he was before. He leans against Harry’s shoulder, squinting down at the crystal ball. “I don’t see anything. Give me a clue.”
Harry doesn’t dare mention that he’s already felt the beginnings of an itchy scalp. “Right, that’s not a good idea. Well, we could always try to freeze them and see if they fall off. And then immediately
“What did you bring me, Harry?” Draco whispers in his ear.
“Draco, you’re late! Where are you? I have some news for you! Don’t tell me that I woke up early for nothing!” Pansy’s voice gets louder with each sentence until Draco jolts awake, heart pounding. He quickly looks around the room, straining his eyes in the semi-darkness. Finally, his hand locates his wand underneath his pillow and he quickly casts a Silencing Charm on her dolphin Patronus.
, Harry thinks. Out loud he says, “Sorry, Teddy. I was surprised at what your grandmother just told me.” He combs his fingers through his godson’s turquoise hair to see signs of what Andromeda just told him, but Teddy’s scalp is healthy and there are no signs of irritation.
Dudley’s face turns white. “Er, right. Well, come on in, both of you.”
Draco reaches out for it, eager to switch ties, but Harry pulls it out of reach. “You look good in red and gold, Draco. It suits you.”
After making a cup of tea, Draco writes a note for Harry to let him know that he has stepped out to run errands. His next letter is longer, asking his mother to please forgive him as he’s cancelling his Christmas plans, but for a good reason. He also promises to make it up to her. He bribes his owl, Ptolemy, with owl treats to deliver the letter as fast as he can before sending him out in the cold.
They follow Amy to a table tucked away in the corner of the shop filled with different coloured jumpers. “This is our ugly Christmas jumper collection,” Amy says, “They’re popular with uni students.”
Harry had decided to hand in his resignation to Head Auror Robards, but instead of accepting it, Robards had told him to take a break. Harry could re-evaluate his decision about quitting when he returned.
Harry nods. “When you mentioned how lonely you were at night while I’m away on Auror missions,” Harry says. “I know it’s not the same, but I hope this can help you.”
Malfoy squeezes Harry’s hand before saying, “Be warned, Potter, don’t you dare break up with me like that.”
Ron clears his throat, holding up a scroll. “You even received a personal letter of recommendation from the Minister for magic.”
? Who’s your boyfriend?” she asks, frowning. “The last thing I’ve heard is that you were doomed to either an arranged marriage or a confirmed bachelor.” Without waiting for a response, she grasps his tie and flips it around.
Daisy laughs, shaking her head. “No. You have to solve for ‘x’, not find it. Here, look.” She picks up her Muggle gadget and punches the buttons, using her pencil to write down numbers and symbols.
Draco unlocks the door and steps inside, making sure he doesn’t trip over Harry’s two adopted cats, Holly and Noel.
“I didn’t buy the statue for you; it’s for me,” Harry begins, but Draco cuts him off.
“I am not stressing,” Draco replies, but even he knows he’s not fooling Harry.
Ron, despite his rather impressive imitation of his mother, nervously looks around as soon as he finishes speaking. Despite being a decorated war hero, he’s never lost the fear of angering his mother. He breathes a sigh of relief and asks Harry, “Did Charlie ever tell you if he received the Howler?”
He found himself with this job after the war as he was going through the books in the Manor. The Ministry had confiscated as many dark items that they could find and they had specifically targeted the library. Whatever remained was left in tatters and while many of books had been preserved and protected with spells, those had lapsed and were now in serious need of repair.
“Very funny, Potter. You’re more than likely to burn the flat down.”
Draco gives her a small smile. “Magic and technology don’t mix. But I have a solution to your homework. Put your calculator away, please.”
“What?” Daisy says, frowning. “What’s Arithmancy? No, this is my calculus homework.”
The Floo roars to life in the room next to Draco’s office, distracting him long enough to splatter ink over his notes. He quickly Vanishes the extra ink on the parchment, before standing up to see if Harry and Teddy have returned from visiting the Weasleys. His bones crack and ache, and a quick
Draco couldn’t help but agree. Harry kissed him again before they settled down on the sofa to read the musings of Harry’s family and friends, their hands clasped tightly together.
Harry doesn’t have to come closer to know that both clock hands are now at
Draco has forgotten that pupils’ names are stitched on the back of clothing to help the house-elves return them to the correct owner. Horror fills his stomach and he slowly looks up to find Weasley at the Gryffindor table. Granger is rubbing circles on his back as Weasley tries to breathe between coughs, tears streaming down his face that’s as red as his hair.
Harry taps the envelope to check for curses, but nothing happens.
“Really?” Draco asks, grinning. “What a coincidence. I have a surprise for you too.” He pulls out a small black box and hands it to Harry. “Go on. Open it. It won’t bite.”
Draco hits him lightly on the shoulder. “You’re not funny, Harry. I look fabulous in Muggle clothing. Besides, it turned out to be quite boring. The good thing is that it’s over now.”
“Not for much longer,” Draco interrupts.
“Shit,” Harry says, turning off the water and running out the door. He forgets to put on his glasses as he hurries to catch up, almost stumbling several times.
“Draco,” he says and spells it out for her before moving away from the counter.
Malfoy laughs and the icy exterior he displays finally cracks. “Apparently, they are the ‘something borrowed’ Luna needed for her wedding, whatever that means. I don’t understand it, but they seemed to make her happy, so how could I say no?”
Draco let out a sigh of relief. If Harry was coherent enough to insist that he was fine, then the raid must not have been too horrible and he could stop imagining all the ways Harry had been hurt. “Do you need anything? If you give me the list, I can brew some potions.”
Teddy shrugs. “Is Cousin Draco angry? I’m sorry.”
“You don’t like it?” Harry says at last.
“Oh, cheer up, Weasley. You’re at a party,” Pansy says. “I don’t remember you being this glum at your birthday party a few months ago.”
Draco snorted. Unexpected. That was a good word for it. “Actually, this photograph is about me. Why would I need to
Harry doesn’t stop at the Gryffindor table like Draco expects him to. Instead, he walks over to where Draco is, sitting down and looking as comfortable as if he were sitting with his friends.
“Did you spend all night baking?” Harry asks.
“I’m not leaving, Harry,” Draco said. “But I do have something for you, as an apology of sorts. I was going to wait and give this to you for Christmas, but I think you should have it right now.” Draco
“Of course I would be here with you, Harry. You’re my friend.”
At least that got a reaction out of Harry, although it wasn’t one that Draco was expecting. He glared at Draco, something that Draco had not experienced from Harry since before the war. It shocked Draco and made him question what this raid was all about. Was there some sort of Dark artefacts that had been connected to the Malfoys? It surely affected Harry more than Ron and that couldn’t be anything good.
“You’re telling me that I have supported the wrong team my entire life?” Draco says, taking a sip of wine. “How could I wasted forty years supporting the Magpies, a team who has won over fifty League Cups, when it’s obvious I should have been a Cannons fan?”
Pansy’s mouth drops open in shock. “He what? Draco, I don’t think he has ever done that with anyone before. At least Ginny’s never mentioned it.”
To get away from the public and press, Harry and Draco had decided to live in Muggle London. No one besides their closest friends and family knows where they live. All their bills are automatically paid and any notices are held in a post office box. Anyone else who needs to contact them sends post to their workplace or, thanks to Hermione who has taught them the wonders of Muggle technology, sends them a text message. Harry doesn’t think that in the three years he has lived at the flat they have ever received a letter on their doormat.
Draco leans down and presses a kiss against Teddy’s forehead. “Yes, your grandmother will be honoured to give Mr Finny flowers. Now please don’t cry anymore. Everything’s going to be all right, Teddy. Are you feeling better?”
Ginny and Pansy both laugh at the look on Ron’s face. Even Harry tries to hide his grin as he passes out more glasses of wine before sitting down.
While Ginny and Harry were talking, the dove took flight and circled the group of single guests several times. The next thing Harry knows, the dove drops the bouquet. Out of habit from years of playing Quidditch, Harry reaches out and snatches the bouquet out of the air. He hadn’t expected to actually catch the flowers since he’s not the tallest person in the group.
“That person is our strongest known link to the catastrophe. Why was he there? Why did he mislead us with the replacement of your body?”
“Don’t you ever think I’m too busy to help you. You did the right thing by calling me.”
He noticed the bar had gone much quieter. Or it seemed that way to him. People were staring, but mostly went on with their conversations. Looking up, he saw his team at the next level, their eyes gaping. They all turned away from his gaze when he caught them staring. All except Jasper, who raised his beer with a grin, and toasted from afar.
He felt he might as well say the rest of it. “You were in pain. I don’t think you meant to show me that, but I saw it. I wasn’t trying to extinguish your fire, just take away some of the heat. That’s a lot of rage, and I was sure that it’s not who you are.”
“Draco, there’s no point in courting a man who can’t give you a child and who has in no other way proven his magic.”
“A marriage and rebellious magic. From what you’ve told me, traditional practices will waste another week of testing and scanning before any wizard determines they cannot cut the source of the problem from his mind. If he doesn’t wish to be married, his magic will fight that contract, unto his health. And your son’s magic, which is, shall we say distinctive, will fight that. All I can do is look at the stalemate symbolized by his illness. If I understand it, I can show it to him and let him cure himself. If he doesn’t want to be married, I can’t change that. As for bringing people here or shuttling them out, I’m afraid my abilities will only encompass one other person.”
He stifled a curse and took a deep breath. He wanted a shower, but reminded himself that the Potters were fully expecting to take their child home today. He thought of Harry and Draco as ‘The Potters.’ He couldn’t release her until he could confirm that her charts were within normal range of contained magic, and he so much wanted to give them that.
‘Give it up, Harry. Let him have it. I promise we’ll leave you alone. Hell, I’m tempted to sneak you out of here myself. As soon as these assholes are gone, I’ll do what I can. I’ll hold you. For god’s sake, come. Just come. Let go!’
Draco continued, “It’s so hard with you. But it’s even harder without you. What if we never get the hang of this?”
“Ladoria was Snape’s Grandmother. She gave you gifts.”
Their son was different. Harry didn’t seem to trust anything put in front of him, not without a thorough examination and assessment of how useful it was to him. He enjoyed people, but saw no need to tie himself to them. His ‘been there, done that’ attitude was reminiscent of someone determined not to get trapped in obligations built on the values of others. If it didn’t please him, he wasn’t going to keep it in his life, no matter how much it meant to the ones he loved. At three, when most children obeyed in response to doting affection, he had an uncanny ability to look his parents in the eye and say ‘no.’ His erratic magic slammed doors and shattered things, but never injured anyone, so his family wasn’t worried about the benevolence of his nature, just the vehemence behind it.
Exhibit A, this photo is presented as evidence by Detective Ryan Kramer. It is presented as proof that Harry Potter did in fact know his stalker two years prior to the home invasion. Many more like this show Mr. Potter turning towards Mr. Cormac McLaggen's camera and deliberately initiating eye contact, which the defendant calls, 'baiting and teasing'.
Harry narrowed his focus on the woman. Above her tweed collar and tight dark curls, her mouth cracked with age lines all around it, exactly like a dry riverbed. She looked at him with steel in her eyes and her smile challenged him to call her a liar. He couldn’t read the name on her badge, but noted that she stood with a barrage of supporters who cheered her every accusation.
Harry rushed forward. “Sorry, I should’ve warned you. That’s a tricky word around her. We don’t say it.”
That beautiful Malfoy complexion became an equally enchanting oxygen-deprived shade of blue. And though blood vessels stood on the whites of his eyes, Lucius never lost consciousness.
“Ouch! What?”
Patrificus Totalus, is a harsh spell. Rankar explained that it was like clubbing someone over the head to temporarily stun their functions. He preferred the gentler,
“Draco.” Man, to be such a pureblood, his husband was violent. Now that bit about, ‘I stabbed my teacher with his wand,’ was coming into greater focus. He fought down the urge to put his head in his hands, and said, “I’m coming in there. I will restrain you.”
“You’ll love it. It’ll make you admit that muggles have their own magic.”
He nearly jumped when a bottle of Beamish Stout splashed down in front of him. It was not his drink of choice and the laughter in the bartender’s eyes assured him that he’d meant to startle Harry out of his inner monologue.
"But it makes no sense to rescue the dying, remove them from the wreckage and then leave them to be found with Harry. That simply arouses suspicion. Why sabotage the train in the first place?"
“You’re not my father. You don’t get to say what I’m allowed to do. I know where I got it from. I’ll jump on my dragon’s back and leave you feeling like an idiot for trying to control me.”
He felt a tug of exhaustion. He’d stayed too long. He knew he wasn’t his old self, but he’d felt strong enough to take his baby outside. To pick up a few things from the store, maybe swing by to see his parents. Let them see how well he was doing. Of course he’d have to listen to them bitch about living like a muggle, but they were being really nice to Harry. They were making an effort. He found it amusing how his father practically sucked up to Harry these days, knowing there would be no seeing his granddaughter if he made one wrong remark. Harry had made that clear early on.
He wasn’t looking at Draco. One of the Malfoys had just cleared their throat, like they were being fucking inconvenienced. When he looked back at them, they were standing like statues, removed from the scene at hand. But their eyes recorded Harry’s every wince, his nudity, and every second of his humiliation.
Harry decided that he was far too sober for this, and committed to not thinking about anything else but the burn of alcohol he was steadily making his way towards.
“You promised you were done with him. I forbid you to call that wizard into our home. He’s dark. He’ll contaminate our lives and the peace we’ve worked so hard for.”
“Safe? He’s gotten sicker!”
“Draco, they have to do what you tell them. They’re you. Don’t believe what their saying.”
Jipsy’s eyes opened and she looked up at him. He couldn’t read her expression. She simply looked like she was awaiting his next instructions. The car was off the main road now and turning into a gravel lot. He noted how it slowed, maneuvering past rows of other cars, even stopping to let another pull out. Whomever had control of the car, was being awfully careful. They intended to bring the child to them as unharmed as possibly. Maybe they’d kill him, but they weren’t risking any harm to her.
Lily glared at Remus, who took Sirius’s arm. “Come on. Enough small talk.”
The look on Thella’s face was growing less serene and more desperate. “She says to tell you that her granddaughter is beautiful. When your child was laughing at her mobile, waking you up at 3:00 AM every morning for two weeks, your mother was playing with her. The veil is very thin at that hour, and you heard one side of the interaction. She says not to worry about Draco. He’s committed to you.”
Her confidence faltered. Her eyes dropped to his chest. “What I see confuses me. You summon your father’s wisdom, yet two men step forward. They don’t share the same worlds.”
“Severus says it’s poisoning you.”
He shook his head. “Thank you, but no. I’m sorry, I have to get my daughter and go. I can’t thank you enough for your help. Are you okay? Did you get out of there all right?”
“I have to know. If there’s a child out there somewhere…”
Lucius lifted his eyes to Severus. “Don’t let him suffer.”
When he'd first approached her after the funeral, he didn't know how she would react to his request. It was a strange request. But if anyone understood why he wanted a sample of the remains, it was she.
Black, himself had been the one to try to explain to Harry that he wasn’t a criminal, but he’d likely be deported.
Jipsy shook her head. “That name is hidden behind secrecy wards. I cannot speak it.”
With Elan draped on his arm, he spun the two of them around. Elan waved good-bye as he walked out with Severus.
Sighing, Harry came out of the stall. “It just seems really unprofessional for you to approach me like this. And I’m not gay.”
Draco’s face went grimacing. It was clear to Harry that he did not appreciate Jame’s liberties with his words, but didn’t want to risk any penalty by saying so. Not yet anyway. “Yes,” he said tightly.
“I haven’t done anything to help Draco yet.”
Laughter, even the thought of it, helped. “What do I owe you, I forgot to pay.”
Harry appealed to Sirius. “Dad made my husband cry.”
She understood, his travels were encapsulated within his magic. He carried his favorite places with him, rather than traveled to them externally. For all she knew, her entire reality could’ve been a snow globe on his shelf. But as long as she was living it, she’d claim it fully.
When they absolutely had to leave the baby in someone else's care, it was Harry who'd approached Hermione Grainger for the first time after months. Draco wanted to kill him.
He dug into the trunk, finding a very solid bottom and no photos. He took everything out. “If you saw a picture of her, you’d tell me, right?”
So that’s how a Backaal might become pregnant after eons of being unable to do so. That’s how Harry did it. He was, in effect, the Elder Wand. That queen that Collin spoke of, collected magic, unable to produce it herself. Harry emitted the essence of the Elder Wand as well as Snape’s mother’s store of power. Eileen’s contribution can’t be forgotten. How much the two were intertwined, was unknown. Could Harry be persuaded to tap into his hidden powers? Could he fix all of his problems if he had the right guidance? How to teach him safely, were he willing? How to let him know that his instability goes deeper than anyone thought. His troubles, his challenges, they weren’t his fault.
“You will not always be physically surrounded by those who are amplifying your magic now. They must return to their lives. If you make the choice now, you will receive the maximum help they can give you and ensure a healthy birth. If you wait, you will allow natural conflicts to take place. Things can still turn out well, but you will add struggle to the equation. It’s the nature of humans to do so. Even magical ones.”
Damn.
A/N:  Please review! :-)
Hermione was the only one thinking rationally. “Harry! We have to get her to a mediwizard. We’ve done something. Her magic is having a reaction.”
They were both breathing hard and seething at one another. Harry knew that his comments were punishing Draco just as much as they punished his father. But he couldn’t say he was sorry, when he wasn’t. He couldn’t. He was angry and a little sick on his stomach, but he’d just spent thirty minutes in the spotlight of Draco’s calm and memories. He’d been able to see Iece’s magic through his eyes for the first time, and it wasn’t weird or evil, or some dark touch that Lucius left on her. It was beautiful that she was unique, and he had the greatest proof of all that she was a perfectly healthy, good little girl. He had two years of loving her, of knowing her, of being greeted by her footed pajamas and bottle nipple clenched between her tiny teeth every morning. Not that she took a bottle anymore, but he remembered when she had. She was so fucking beautiful, inside and out. Draco’s memories showed him a different way of looking at her eyes. He didn’t have to be scared of them. And now Draco takes that little bit of precious comfort away by showing him this.
“Draco!” He and Emerald followed.
“I see. I’m searching the global network for a Thella fortune teller. Can you provide any more information about her?”
Harry pulled into the gate of his home, admiring the asphalt repairs done since the night of the dragon. He was coming from shuttling a group of muggle business people back to their hotel. It had been a very successful meeting, and he couldn’t wait to tell Draco and his father the good news. An American company wanted to buy his patent for his physical therapy bracelets. Draco was right, he could sell them on a larger scale. He had no interest in running a factory, but Draco said he didn’t have to.
"You think that baby's his?"
“Mr. Potter, this is a surprise.” She didn’t have to turn around to feel his wand pointed at her.
While they speculated, they missed the warning in Draco’s sway. His body leaned into Harry’s and Lily went warm with relieved affection, until she saw his legs buckle and he continued tumbling to the floor.
To his father’s left, Kevin lit a cigarette. He exhaled, regarding Draco with a tense stare and slouching body. He leaned, shifting his weight to the side of his chair’s high back.
“What a cool idea!” Harry let her go.
He let them rush around the banister to hug him.
He did as he was told and saw that he was indeed inside the picture, in the room. It was a studio with bare wood floors and small rugs. Furniture sat like props. Behind Eileen, was only a backdrop of a painted parlor. The rest of the room looked more like a storage warehouse, with crates and photography equipment off to one side. There were people, but they seemed to move in a slow and blurred way. He took a moment to try to figure out what they were doing and it dawned on him that they were interacting with each other normally, but couldn’t see him. There were at least four other people in the room and one of them was not human. It was an elf. An elf with bobs and hair berets fastened to her ears. And she stood next to an elegant woman wearing an indigo blue stole, who waved out towards Eileen. He tried to make out what the woman was saying, but her speech, like her movements seemed largely out of sync with him. Slower, lower, and indecipherable.
The sheer concentration of her information, pushed his head back. More than words went into his mind and he felt his brain attempt to swallow the chunk he’d been given. It went down with resistance. When he fought to reply, she held up her hand. “No more.”
Draco told him, “It’s okay if I’ve put you through so much, you don’t feel the same way. And maybe when we get out of here, I’ll lose my confidence. But I can still feel him against me, and let me tell you, that’s all I want. To live to be good enough to get to have that back. He must be incredible with love and magic, if he can do that to me. Sour me. So maybe, if something that wonderful came from this body, then it can’t be that bad. I can’t be that bad.”
“Yes. But first you have to give me permission to alter your Wheels of Life. I can’t touch them if you don’t. Your magic will not allow it.”
Harry went through the motions of washing his hands. It was his way of showing that he wasn’t running away, he was walking away. Draco made a point to watch, folding his arms and leaning against the wall. It was obvious that he admired the view.
When everyone had gone, one of the sliding wall panels opened up, and Harry stepped out. Behind him, Lucius and Narcissa followed.
He said, with too much tightness in his voice, “You’re dismissed.” He’d kick himself later, he was done talking. He deliberately steeled himself against the gentle acceptance in her expression. He was pissed and he wanted her to know that. Even if it wasn’t her fault.
Draco had asked, "Do you miss my body the way it was?"
Luna announced. “I don’t want to be the guinea pig anymore. It’s not as fun as it looks.” She rubbed her arm. Harry took her by the shoulders and gently stirred himself in front of his daughter.
When he got no response, he continued, “We’re family, Harry. Whatever has happened, please trust me like a father and tell me what on earth made you do that to Lucius?”
By three, they were home and Harry quickly put everything away and set about transforming one of her plastic balls into a kiddie pool. He used one of the generic wands that Jipsy kept for him, he still hadn’t recovered his from the Malfoy’s. It had probably been confiscated by the Ministry by now, and he wasn’t in any Hurry to get it back. He’d lost so many wands by now, he was learning the trick of making just about any replacement work for him just fine.
“She needs me!”
He didn’t want to get into it, but he knew he had to tell him something. He pointed to his pin.
“The least he can do is say something. Draco, come out at once.”
“You wouldn’t know that you’re doing it.”
This was so frustrating a realization, that Harry began kicking. His legs were ten times stronger than his arms. He aimed for the soft places. He stopped taking note of where the blood was coming from or the effect he was having. In the back of his mind, he knew this was a repeat of yesterday’s catastrophe. Of muggles standing around, bearing witness and taking out their camera phones. He knew that this would very likely land him in another cell, and no one was going to save him from it. He’d avoided his punishment for far too long, been way too lucky. The best case scenario, Lucius dies from his injuries and the police have no way to subdue him, but by putting a bullet into him.
Lucius sat in a corner, nursing his drink. There were so many people fawning over his son, Narcissa had to tactfully turn them away. When Harry Potter walked up to Draco and asked him to dance, a hush fell over the room. Something shifted in the air, and everyone's heart stopped when Draco took a second too long to answer. Every one saw it. Up until that moment, the evening had been a well-mastered joke, a frivolous bid to shut people up, or give them something worth gossiping about. No one said Harry was going to take an interest. No one warned him that Harry, of all people, would like what he saw, and want more. Draco quickly regained his composure, but not before letting every onlooker, and every camera, see how truly unprepared he was for Harry's invitation. They took the dance floor together. Guests moved out of the way, letting them have the center. The resulting photo would make headlines in both the Wizarding world as well as the Muggle one.
“Yes, but the Muggles don’t know that. All they see is a handsome young man carrying five overflowing bags of groceries in the sweltering heat. It’s a wonder I haven’t fainted already.”
Harry snorts. “My fans? Or just one fan in particular? Let’s face it, Draco, you’re a Harry Potter fanboy.”
“Deal. You choose the dinner and I’ll try my best to pair it off with a nice bottle of wine.”
“I understand,” Draco says at last. “Perhaps next Christmas, then.” He shouldn’t feel so disappointed. Of course Harry will want to spend time with the Weasleys. Molly Weasley almost didn’t survive, but luckily recovered at the last minute. If the situation were reversed, he’d be by his mother’s side if she fell ill.
The living room is minimalistic except for the giant Christmas tree in the corner. Harry had gone on assignment before he could finish decorating and Draco worked long hours at St Mungo’s that rarely left him enough energy to do anything other than to eat and sleep.
“Of course I’ll help you. You’re my best friend,” she says. “But please don’t stress about the Weasleys. You get along well with Ginny and Ron now. Besides, Harry
“I broke up with Charlie.”
“Ron and Hermione know it’s not true. All of my friends know that I can throw off the Imperious Curse.”
The huge Douglas fir tree in the corner doesn’t have a specific theme, but rather the branches are haphazardly decorated with tinsel, ribbons, twinkling fairy lights, or homemade ornaments according to Harry’s amusement. It’s only due to Draco’s meticulous charm work that the tree hasn’t fallen over.
Harry’s mouth fell open. “You’re admitting it. He’s alive. Isn’t that classified information?”
- You just want to give something back, so you make sure you leave a comment. You don’t put a lot of thought into it, but hey, you left something in return for something. You’re that moment behind the scenes when you realize that, not only is Tom Felton not a bad guy, he’s the most forthcoming about his emotions and has been the most vocal about Draco’s feelings for Harry.
He replied in his steadiest voice. “I screwed up. So what. It’s not like I did it on purpose. If your magic mirror showed you that I was with this boy, did it also show you that I didn’t have a clue this was the same guy you brought here? He was unconscious the last time I saw him. Prior to that, I’d only just seen his charred body a few days before. You can’t accuse me of doing anything wrong, when I hardly knew what I was doing.”
It helped. Harry was good at it. Thank god he knew what he was doing. He moved over Draco’s body and carefully distributed his weight. Draco’s breath lifted him and deposited him deeper in the slope of his chest. His heart pounded against Harry’s. His midriff cushioned him, and movements above him pushed so much up through the striations of his core, extracting years of hidden emotions, and grinding them out of him. Harry felt good in all the right places.
“I think the dinner’s a lost cause. Let’s order takeaway,” Harry suggests,
There was that word again. Muggle. “Who’s Granger? Is he joining you here too?”
Harry winks. “If you’re lucky.”
Harry’s eyes are wide and he scrambles to get his wand out of its holster. “Oh, Merlin! I’m so sorry, Draco. Are you hurt?” He moves forward, but stops when Draco shakes his head.
He rose from the couch and stretched, groaning at each crack that signified he was getting old. He looked around the empty room and decided that he would surprise Harry and start decorating. Harry had already dragged all the Christmas decorations down from the attic and stuck them in the closet near the living room.
“You have a conflict of interest that will prevent you from voting. That means I’ll have to impress
“That doesn’t make it any less true. I do like you. Fancy you even. Ron says I’m mental.”
At those words, Draco finally turns his head to look at Harry with wide eyes. “You’re telling me that you took a year off from the Aurors, a job you love, just to travel?”
Now that he can’t put it off any longer, Draco kneels in front of the fireplace and Floo calls Pansy, hoping it’s not too early as she doesn’t like to be woken up without good reason. However, this is an emergency.
Draco thinks, glaring up at the drizzling sky that’s ruining his wool coat. He hates the cold and the light rain is making his mood worse. In his haste to leave St Mungo’s early to buy groceries, he had forgotten his umbrella. He can’t even cast
Draco stumbles backwards in his haste to get away, plowing into the small coffee table. He cries out as a corner of the table sharply jabs the back of his knees, causing him to lose his balance.
Dudley takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. “For being horrible to you when we were kids. I was imitating my father, but that’s no excuse. It wasn’t until after you left for the final time, that I noticed how terrible he was as a person. He was bitter, angry, and didn’t even change when Mum divorced him. He died alone because he pushed everyone away. I don’t want to end up that way, so I tried finding you. But you are very difficult to find.”
To make matters worse, Draco Malfoy chooses that moment to walk over to Harry’s table. Malfoy stands in front of the three friends with an eyebrow arched. He’s dressed in a Muggle three-piece suit with his hair not slicked back for once. The sight of him makes Harry’s heart beat faster.
“Purge? Surely this is a bit too much? It sounds to me like you just found an excuse to get rid of my clothes.”
“You were beautiful pregnant, Draco,” Harry says, but when Draco narrows his eyes, Harry hastily adds, “But that’s not what I see.”
Vernon reluctantly sits down. “What do you want? I’ve told your kind to leave us alone!”
They fall to the floor, Holly hissing as she lands on her feet. She still has her claws in the jumper, sniffing at it before she begins to purr loudly.
And so Harry did. He told her every little thing about Draco even if it seemed inconsequential. How Draco had been trying to change his views on things his father had instilled in him as a child. How he was apologising to the people that he hurt when he was younger. The way Draco had learned to cook without magic even if the meals never came out perfect. The way he treated Teddy despite who his parents were. How most of their conversations seemed to be just saying things that were on their minds and that it never got boring even if they stayed up all night. How happy it made him to see Draco’s smile and be there to comfort one another whenever they had nightmares.
