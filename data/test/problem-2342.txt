"Oh, no. You've tried to make nice, is that it?"
Draco’s head whips around. He stares into the darkness of the Forbidden Forest, his blood running cold.
Before Potter could say anything else, Draco strutted away, his chin held high. He’d rather be dead than let Potter know what he was doing to him. He told one of the waiters to get Harry freaking Potter a drink, who, in turn, looked mortified at having neglected the unofficial guest of honour.
“Ah, they’re here. I cleaned them.”
“Nothing?” Draco echoes, his stomach lurching.
“Still, it’s a little weird,” Draco says, making a face.
“Spread them a bit.”
“Harry—”
“This isn’t a prank?”
Draco gasps. For a moment, he thinks Potter is losing consciousness. No. He finally stopped fighting back.
“Yours was the most convenient.”
“Potter,” Malfoy splutters. “What the fuck are you doing?”
?” Draco shouts incredulously.
Draco is ready to smash his quill on the desk when Potter suddenly jumps up. He catches something in mid-air; a letter, Draco realises. He watches Potter out of the corner of his eye as he tears it open. After a moment, Potter plops down on his chair again, looking deflated.
Harry gulps. Fighting with Malfoy is easy, he knows how to handle that. Flirting with Malfoy on the other hand…
Trying to ignore Malfoy’s comments on his table manners, Harry jumps up as soon as he’s swallowed the last bit of his toast.
“Do you think we should talk about it?” Harry whispers to Penny while Malfoy is in the shower behind him. “It’s weird isn’t it?” Penny squeaks. “I just want to know what’s going on. This is driving me insane.”
“I assume that will keep the, err, nighttime disturbance at bay,” he says. He wraps himself in the sleeping bag, even zipping it up, and lies down with his back turned to Draco.
“Whatever, Potter. Come with me.” Harry didn’t resist when Malfoy dragged him across the bar, but he felt a bit irritated. Malfoy stopped in the hall in front of the bathrooms and before Harry knew what was going on, he felt himself being pressed against the wall.
for Merlin’s fucking sake, does his mouth always decide to take the helm at the worst time possible?
“What do you—”
wants to bite Potter’s lip. “Okay, hold still,” Potter says quietly and reaches out to cup Draco’s cheeks.
Sometimes, Draco can still hear her screams at night. He had wanted to look away, but found himself unable to, as the green light flashed through the room and the witch had gone limp, her eyes torn open, the look of terror engraved on her face and forever seared into Draco’s memory. Her father had been next. Voldemort had yelled with derisive laughter that had the same effect on Draco as if ten Dementors had just wafted into the parlour. His parlour.
“Let’s just keep it sweet and simple, that’s all I’m saying.”
“I bet you taste
“You—WHAT?” Draco’s cup lands on the floor, spilling coffee all over the carpet.
Draco presses his lips into a tight line. Oh. Right. They haven’t talked about that yet. Right now, they’re basically just two blokes shagging on occasion. Many occasions. Pretty regularly. They haven’t even talked about being exclusive. Although Draco assumes they are. Potter made it clear on more than one occasion that he’s a one-person-at-a-time type of bloke and Draco… Well, if Potter doesn’t know he’s absolutely crazy about him, he really is as dense as Draco likes to tease him about. He wouldn’t be opposed to the idea of making Potter his boyfriend. Not at all, actually. But is it what
“There’s nothing more you can take from me,” Draco says, raising his chin in defiance. “You’ve taken everything. My pride, my dignity,” he pauses, his heart hammering violently against his chest, “even my bloody virginity.”
“Of course
Draco huffed as the other boy’s mouth clamped shut and he averted his eyes.
“Hold on,” Potter wheezes. Draco releases his cock and watches him curiously as Potter fumbles around the bed table for his wand.
“You’re Harry Potter. The world is your oyster.”
Draco doesn’t know why it bothers him so much. He just knows that it does.
Panting, he wiped the sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand. He could still feel Potter’s touch on his skin. Only, unlike in his dream, it didn’t feel arousing anymore. It felt like some invisible force was crashing down on him, stifling him.
“He wants to be with me,” Teddy insisted.
Harry ignores that comment and quickly steps out of his jeans. Usually he’d take off his shirt as well, preferring to sleep only in his underpants, but that seems very wrong under these circumstances.
“What?”
“It was the Basilisk. I was hearing the Basilisk in the pipes and—”
He lowers his head and squeezes Malfoy’s hand.
“You didn’t just poke me,” Draco snaps and rubs the burning spot on his arm. “Ouch!” He flinches. It feels like a thousand needles are pricking his skin. “What the hell?” He hesitates, staring at his arm. Experimentally, he lightly pokes himself, only to flinch again. “Ouch!”
“Is that so?”
“Maybe. I don’t know.”
touching me, you oaf.”
“You’re obviously running a fever. Maybe I should call Hermione. I’m sure she could cure you of-”
He still can’t believe it. He stares at Potter’s head, at his shoulders rising and falling evenly as his words echo in his mind. Maybe reading to Potter wasn’t so embarrassing after all. And if Potter really was talking about needing ‘Beedle the Bard’ to keep the nightmares away, it seems to have worked. He looks peaceful at least. Huh. Draco realises he didn’t have any dreams either. Not the worst outcome, he thinks with a mental shrug. He lets his head fall back against the headboard and closes his eyes. Still, it’s a little weird to have Harry Potter sleeping in his lap. But… it’s not horrible. It’s actually… quite okay. Not that he’d ever admit that, he thinks, before he drifts off to sleep again, not even realising that his fingers are twisted around soft, black hair.
“Can you stand on your own now?”
“Hmmmm. Are you a boy or a girl?”
Granger gives him a speculative glance. “But you like him?”
Draco leaned closer. “Do you trust me?”
“He needs some Flobberworm mucus.”
“Maybe… someday,” he said, evasively.
For a tiny fraction of a second, Malfoy looks shocked. But then he snorts, tightening his grip on Harry’s scarf.
Not wanting Madam Pince to know what he’s planning, he grabs another few books that look fairly harmless.
“Well, she said that this flower thing might be tied to your emotions and that they represent love or something.” Ron squares his shoulders and sits up a little straighter. “I told her she was wrong,” he says triumphantly. “I mean, when you and Ginny didn’t get back together after… you know, I figured it was you who didn’t want to be with her anymore.”
“No,” Ron says enthusiastically. “Merlin, it’s so good to hear your voice!”
Still sceptical, but intrigued, Draco does turn around. He yelps when Potter grabs one of his legs and guides it to the other side of his body. Now, Draco is straddling Potter’s chest. Backwards. His heart gives a violent jump when Potter places his hands on his thighs and pulls him closer to his face. Draco tumbles forward and tries to keep his balance by putting his palms on the mattress.
Draco stays perfectly still. “What do we do, then?”
Harry cringes. He can’t deny the truth in Draco’s words. He has been feeling so conflicted over the last few days, fury, despair, and loneliness battling in his chest. More than once he asked himself how he could possibly be
“I should have brought a camera,” Malfoy chuckles.
“Headmistress, wasn’t there a girl named Brown in our year?”
“Please?”
“How can you eat that?” he chokes as Potter shoves something into his mouth that looks like it had once been a fish.
“What the actual fuck,” he splutters. He can already feel his cheeks heating up and it’s only going to be a matter of time until he—Great. He’s already done it. He’s invisible. Fuck. Then again, maybe it’s for the best. Even if he’s wearing a glamour, he wouldn’t want Malfoy catching ogling him.
Judging from the look on Potter’s face, he hadn’t expected Draco to say something like that. Honestly, Draco hadn’t expected himself to say something like that. But it was true, wasn’t it? Potter had saved bloody everyone. And now he still felt like he had to do what people expected of him?
“What are you reading?” Draco asks softly.
“This is my flat, too,” Malfoy growls, turning around. “But, believe me, I wouldn’t have if I’d known you’d cockblock me.”
Was this a trap? Was he waiting for Draco to lower his guard? Well, he didn’t exactly look like he was about to attack. He was… just standing there, completely limp, while the water drizzled down on him. He couldn’t have been much taller than Draco. In fact… he almost looked a little smaller. And he was skinny. Maybe a little too skinny. His black hair reached down to his shoulders; it looked knotted and unruly. Something about it seemed familiar but Draco couldn’t put his finger on it. Nobody in his circle of friends would neglect their hair like this. Still, he couldn’t shake the feeling he had seen it before. He let his eyes wander lower, down the man’s back… His body looked… almost fragile. With a few pounds more, he would have had the perfect physique of a seeker.
“Nothing.” Draco peeks at him from under his lashes and catches him licking a drop of pumpkin juice off his lips. The very same lips that grazed Draco’s ear last night while he—he—
He gulps. Potter’s right. This is worse. Shit.
Harry can barely keep himself from making any noises now.
Draco tries to suppress the next tremor that seems to be taking control of his body. He fails.
Harry doesn’t remember ever seeing it before, but had he ever been close enough to Draco to notice it? Is this Voldemort’s doing, or…
“No.”
“Believe me,” Harry laughs, “I’ll keep going for the rest of our lives, whether you like it or not.”
“Malfoy—”
Draco pinches the bridge of his nose. “He’s in plain sight, actually. He has been all this time.”
“Of course, Potter,” he snaps. “It’s not like—” But it’s exactly like that.
He doesn’t. He just stares at Draco.
He had panicked, however, when he realised Potter heard every word he said. That nosy prat. Draco had been very vague on purpose, but still, it was more than he had wanted Potter to know. Breaking his nose had been a snap decision, though, driven by the visceral anger that always seizes him whenever he lays eyes on the tosser.
A part of Draco was dying to see the reaction on Potter’s face. But he couldn’t bring himself to open his eyes. He jumped when he heard Potter make a choking sound and felt him squeeze his hand.
“Good luck,” she smiles before skipping away, leaving Harry to wonder how she manages to always be so bright and chipper.
“Fine, be like that,” Potter retorts. “But I don’t want to hear any complaints tomorrow. We’re here to work.”
Harry groans, feeling his heartbeat in his throat, and wraps his arms around Malfoy. His skin is smooth and so incredibly soft it seems unreal.
“Don’t tell me your chickening out, Potter,” Malfoy sneered. That git! Even though they had become somewhat friendly since the start of term, Malfoy apparently still got off on making Harry’s life a living hell.
“I really am sorry, Malfoy,” Potter says quietly. “About the training. About the other Aurors.” He looks like he wants to say more. He doesn’t.
“Don’t overthink it. Just—For the sake of breaking the bond.”
“To gain my trust.”
Is that why Dumbledore hadn’t wanted Harry to know that Draco apparently changed sides? That he’s had feelings for Harry for much longer than he assumed? Had Dumbledore really denied him all this information, consequently preventing Harry from being happy, even for just a fraction of time, so it would be easier for him to accept his death sentence? And now what? Should he feel grateful for that? Did Dumbledore really think so little of him? Did Dumbledore think he was that weak? That Harry would choose his own happiness over the happiness of all the people he’d be saving?
“And he said destiny still has a claim on me,” Potter adds.
“They already know,” Harry hisses. “Snape told them. He’s the one who invented the spell. He’s—”
“Really? Because you look like you’re already halfway there.” Blaise nodded at his face, making Draco frown. “You’re flushed. It’s quite dinky.”
Potter didn’t answer, his expression turning more painful. Draco let out a sigh before he pressed their foreheads together.
He takes a deep breath.
“No,” Harry says immediately. “I’m going to defeat him and I’m going to save you.”
He moves lower, peppering Potter’s chest with kisses while he keeps his hands firmly planted on the mattress. When he reaches Potter’s belly button, he quickly dips his tongue into it and—even though he has no idea why he’s doing it—lets his teeth sink into the soft flesh above Potter’s left pelvic bone. Potter howls. And then he laughs. Draco lifts his head, marvelling at the sound. It’s astonishing, how different it makes him look. So carefree and—
“Draco!”
Draco followed him silently, not sure whether to be excited or mortified. Bumping into Potter was one thing, spending more time with him than necessary, on the other hand, was very dangerous. Draco almost felt like a teenager again; insecure, angry, foolish. It wasn’t a good combination.
Aside from the fact that he won’t be able to defend himself properly, if someone were to attack him in his current state, he really is exercising constant vigilance. Because it’s not only the door Harry keeps an eye on, or rather an ear, it’s also every single sound coming from the right side of the room. The side where Malfoy is lying in his bed, probably concocting a scheme that will make Harry’s gruesome death look like an accident. Surely, he’s just waiting for the right moment. But there’s only so much Harry can do about that.
It really wasn’t Draco’s fault he stayed up night after night to watch Harry sleep like a total creep. The first time it had happened, Draco had been wakened by a soft whimper. Investigating it further, he had seen Harry all sweaty and thrashing in his bed. Draco had intended to wake him, but as soon as he had leaned down, Harry had grabbed him and had pulled him down.
“I want you guys to get along while I’m gone.”
“Do what? What is ‘it’?”
Draco is tempted to snort again. That’s not even a challenge.
“What are you on about, Potter?”
Thanks for reading :)
Before Draco could react, Pansy snatched the letter from him and ran to the other side of the room, tearing it open.
“A disease?” Harry echoes and almost drops his bag.
“Merlin, Draco, what did Potter do to you?”
A part of Draco wasn’t even surprised to find himself once again entangled in the yet unknown mess Potter had undoubtedly made for himself. More than once he had caught himself thinking that things had become quite dull without Potter around. Still, weariness crept up inside him while he stared at Potter’s lifeless body.
“Releasing some tension.”
Harry’s eyes darted back to Malfoy, who was still smiling contentedly with his eyes closed. Harry wondered what would have happened if his friends had given
“It’s just who I am,” Potter says, sounding a bit sheepish.
“Wait, what does that spell do?” Harry asks.
Yes, ridiculous, that’s exactly how Draco feels.
Draco lets out a sigh, feeling all his bottled-up bitterness flare up inside him. “No,” he whispers, his tone deflated.
“Why not?”
“Robards wasn’t happy about it when I told him. He yelled at me for almost ten minutes.”
“FINE,” Draco bellowed, fuming. “But you have to pick me up at the Manor.”
In his heart, he knows it’s pointless. Harry can’t be alive. Dumbledore said he needed to die so the Dark Lord could be killed. If all these people, and their celebratory state, are any indication, it seems like the deed is done.
“I won’t talk to Ron for you, though.”
“Don’t be a party pooper,” Blaise said, raising his champagne flute.
Unnerved, he crawls to the other side of the bed and pulls the duvet over him. He wishes his chest didn’t feel this tight. He wishes he had told Potter no. If only it were that easy. Draco’s mind seems to shut down every time Potter just looks at him with that hunger in his eyes. Ugh. It’s not like Draco’s not getting his Galleon’s worth, it’s bloody fantastic while they’re… doing what they’re doing; it’s the moment after that makes Draco’s blood run cold. Potter doesn’t even deign to look at him.
Harry snorted and pulled Draco into a hug. “Oh no, no, what you said last night tops the bill,” he said, kissing the corner of Draco’s mouth.
Draco waits for Potter to continue.
“Teddy,” Draco said. Teddy’s eyes found his, and Draco tried to ignore the trembling of his lower lip. “You do like… him, don’t you?” Teddy nodded. “Then you’ll have to do what’s best for him.”
“Oh, you’re on, Potter!”
“You are,” Draco said, brushing a strand of hair behind Potter’s ear. “Even more so as a human.”
Draco sighs and slowly pulls away from him. He lets one of his hands slide down Harry’s arm and then Harry feels him tap his hand once. No. No second thoughts.
“Well, it certainly looks like we had fun,” Draco remarked.
“Wait, not yet,” Draco moaned. Mere seconds later, his eyes rolled to the back of his head while his insides turned into molten lava. “Nngh!” His entire body trembled violently as he spilled all over Potter’s hand.
“Harry, my boy, we have to—Merlin’s beard!”
“Malfoy, are you okay?” Obviously, he’s not. He’s still panting and every now and then, his body gives a violent shiver. Unsure of what to do, and acting on impulse again, Harry reaches out until his fingers find Malfoy’s cheek. He gently puts his hand on the side of his face, his pulse picking up at the far too intimate gesture.
Draco grunts, clutching at the sleeping bag and pulling it up to his chin. He realises too late that in doing so, he also pressed Potter’s arm harder against himself. And now their arms are touching. Fabulous.
“Merlin, Malfoy, quit being such a drama queen, will you?”
Harry and Draco both jumped when Celia let out an ear piercing scream.
“That’s the understatement of the century,” Draco snorts. “But honestly, if you’re feeling nostalgic…” He opens one of the desk drawers, where he and Harry keep their memories. “You should… you should look at this one.” With the tip of his wand, he puts Harry’s memory back in its little vial and pours his own into the Pensieve. “Come on,” he says with a smirk, and they both dive in.
friends.”
Potter said nothing, turning his head towards one of the windows instead.
“This isn’t just dinner,” Harry said in awe, gazing around the candlelit room. When his eyes landed on Draco again, he noticed how tense his boyfriend was.
“Oi, Malfoy!”
“No, no,” Harry said hastily. “It’s just…” He paused, searching for the right words. “Well, romance isn’t exactly your strong suit.”
His eyes scan the room, taking in every detail. There are several doors with hearts painted on them; Harry assumes they’re reserved for private dances. Rumour has it the dancers are selling illegal potions in there. Harry has to get into one of them. His mind races, trying to come up with a plan, while he pretends to sip at his firewhisky.
“Potter and Weasley don’t seem to have the same wounds as Malfoy.”
“I want to look at you,” Harry whispers, unthinkingly. Draco freezes and Harry mentally slaps himself.
Draco leaned forward, and closed his eyes. Potter’s lips were extremely soft, and they moved deliciously against Draco’s. Potter snaked his other arm around his hip, making Draco gasp. Potter didn’t lose any time to take advantage of that. As he deepened the kiss, Draco grabbed his upper arms, and sucked Potter’s bottom lip into his mouth.
“Look at us,” Draco shouts. “You’re… you and I’m—” He pauses, struggling for words. “You can’t be— I assure you, you’re not! You can’t be!”
“Oh,” Potter said after a few moments. He withdrew his hand from Draco’s cheek and stepped back. “I—I guess you don’t—”
Damn it, the Galleons are gone. How did he miss the Niffler? Was he really that lost in thought?
“At least lie down and rest for a bit?”
“One of those Muggle devices?”
“It’s not as bad as it was yesterday. And you,” Draco raises his chin, “always look like shit.”
Overwhelmingly distracted by the sensation of Potter’s tongue pushing against his and his hand tightening around his cock, Draco slowly pushed Potter’s suit jacket down his shoulders and fumbled around until he found the buttons of his shirt. As soon as he had unbuttoned one of them, Potter froze. Confused, Draco pulled back.
She nods and lets herself be pulled into a hug.
“Oh shit!” He screws up his eyes, savouring the massive wave of pleasure that hits him. He slows down his strokes, throwing his left arm over his forehead as his entire body pulses in the erratic rhythm of his heartbeat.
“She’s not kidding. She practiced on me, earlier,” Blaise winked.
“Potter. Potter!”
“I can’t open my eyes,” he says quietly, for what feels like the hundredth time.
“Oh, he’s away on important business,” Slughorn replies.
The voice inside his head almost sounds like Malfoy now.
Goodnight?
“I do, actually.”
Draco frowns when Potter’s lips stretch into a sad smile.
Damn Potter. Damn him and his sleep moaning. How is Draco supposed to stay sane? Surely, that‘s something that should be mentioned in Potter’s file. He‘s practically jeopardising the case. Draco can‘t think straight, he can‘t breathe, he‘ll explode if he doesn’t— Shit, but he can‘t. He can‘t! Not with Potter right next to him. But if he doesn‘t— Merlin!
Slughorn chuckles —
“Mind your own business,” Draco grumbles, kicking off his shoes and tucking his feet in under him.
He caught something flicker across Potter’s face, something that made his stomach twist uncomfortably.
“I didn’t want to push it. You’re obviously uncomfortable with it.”
“But then—” Potter looks thunderstruck. “Even if what you’re saying is true and a part of my soul did detach itself, it couldn’t have survived outside of my body, right? It would have needed another body.”
Potter looks down at his shoes and Draco can’t tell if he’s as flustered as Draco or if he’s too caught up in his thoughts. “Thank you,” he murmurs, taking a step forward. “At least, if things go wrong, I’ll see you again. Right?”
“I want to know what it’s like.” He pushed in deep, biting back a groan. “I want to know how it feels to have you inside me.”
“Hmmm.” Potter grips his cock and starts pumping.
“I know you don’t want to talk about it. But how am I supposed to understand if you don’t tell me?” Potter’s features twisted into something tortured. When it was clear he wasn’t going to say anything, Draco added, “I need to know, Potter. Otherwise, we really are done.”
“Ugh, I knew something like this would happen,” Potter mutters.
“Teddy! Dinner’s ready!”
In his astonishment, Harry accidentally made a strange gurgling sound. Malfoy reacted at once.
“Oh my god, we did it!” He punches the air and smiles. “We broke the bond!”
“Yeah,” Harry chuckled. “Maybe we should have started with something else. But you love making soup and I thought-”
“What? Hold on. You didn’t—” He lets out a little snort, not feeling sure about this. At all. “You didn’t actually sleep in a cupboard, did you?”
“What did you do?”
Malfoy blushes furiously as Harry’s booming laughter echoes off the walls.
“Is it?” Potter looked like he was trying very hard to keep his cool.
“So… what? You’re going to marry a witch?”
Potter cocks his head. “I open at the close,” he says slowly, as though he’s tasting the words on his tongue.
“Feeling sorry for you?” Harry echoes, incredulously.
“Bugger,” Harry mutters as they walk back out again. “What now?”
Potter laughed, the skin around his eyes crinkling. “Well, I’ve been told I do quite alright on a broom.”
“You don’t want me,” he breathed, flinching at the sharp stab he felt to his chest.
“So Malfoy is mute… Ron is deaf and you’re… you’re blind.” Something seems to have clicked in Hermione’s mind. Harry can hear it in her voice.
Oh. That’s… not what Harry was expecting.
“I’m sorry I said that,” Potter murmurs. “At the time, I wasn’t—” He bites his lip. “I didn’t know how I felt and I certainly didn’t know what was going on with you. Now, everything is so much clearer and in hindsight—” He shakes his head. “I wasn’t using you. And you weren’t filling a void, Draco,” he says, his fingers caressing Draco’s jaw. He leans forward, his eyes gleaming. “You set my broken soul alight.”
“I think that’s a great idea,” Blaise smirked. He walked over to the sofa where Goyle had fallen asleep and plucked several hairs from his head. Everyone started laughing when Goyle merely grunted and turned over in his sleep.
Shit. Draco had told McGonagall their arrangement should be kept a secret under all circumstances. She was the last person he had expected to blab his secret.
weird he keeps staring at it.
“You’ve been through a lot,” she said.
But the worst part is, his body is already starting to relax against Potter’s, soaking up the warmth he so desperately craves. He can feel Potter’s warm breath on his neck and it feels like a pleasant summer breeze.
The only thing they learned, after talking to several Ravenclaws, is that Clara Higgins, the girl who vanished first, is a model pupil. There’s just one thing that piqued Draco’s interest; her parents are getting divorced.
Draco clamps his mouth shut, not wanting to admit he can’t hold his wand like this.
“I swear to Merlin, if she brings another pile, I’m going to scream. I don’t care if Pince kicks me out.”
Ginny makes a face but slowly nods, her expression turning a bit sheepish. “It’s been bugging me for a while now.”
“I’ll come back.”
“I can’t believe this. How many times have I told you—”
“Potter! Yes! Yes! Almost! Yes!”
“The voice,” he breathes. “I hear it.”
“What?”
Draco flicked his wand to get the coffee machine going and narrowed his eyes at Potter.
“Who are you calling a coward, Weasley?” Malfoy spits.
“I still have a bit of work to do, but I’ll try to be home early, okay?”
“I won’t tell anyone about you. I promise,” she said.
“Did you seriously just apologise via Niffler?” Ginny asks.
“Potter, stop mumbling,” McGonagall interrupted him, though her tone wasn’t as snappish as her words. “Unless you’re here to tell me you murdered somebody, it can’t be as bad as you obviously think it is.”
“You don’t even know how to spell ‘implied’.”
Draco scoffs and shakes his head. “Why did you agree to be partnered up with me, then?”
“Do you even know what this spell does?”
“Even what was under the secret false bottom in the second drawer, nobody but me knows about?”
“Draco!”
“No! Take me! Take me to him instead,” he pleads. The Death Eater arches an eyebrow, eyeing Draco from head to toe, and shrugs.
“In a moment, Mr Potter,” Madam Pomfrey replies in a strained tone. It sounds like she’s struggling with something. “Mr Malfoy, please! Your wounds will open up again.”
Draco hopes the panic doesn’t show on his face. Slughorn’s potion might have dampened the effect of the Goblin wine, but he has no idea how long that’s going to last. And if ten minutes in the cold made his body ache and scream in pain, he doesn’t want to think about what a whole night would do.
Draco grits his teeth as Potter makes a face.
“You were accepted into that program because of what you did to save the entirety of the Wizarding World. And also,” she raised her voice when Potter’s expression darkened, “because you are an exceptional wizard. All I did was encourage you to work harder while you were here at Hogwarts.”
Oh dear. What now? Why did the package have to be delivered when he was in the middle of ignoring Potter?
. Wait. He hadn’t said that out loud.
Potter lifts his legs and wraps them around Draco. It feels like he crossed them at the ankles on Draco’s back. Fuck. Draco has no idea why that would turn him on, but it does.
Honestly, the more Draco thought about it, the more he was convinced Luna would make a great addition to the teaching staff. Who would have thought?
“And?”
Draco blinks several times and reaches out, his hand hovering inches away from Harry’s cheek. His finger twitches and he quickly pulls back when Harry asks, “Are you okay?”
“Whatever,” Draco grumbled and moved to grab the koala around its midriff. His mouth fell open when the koala kicked one of his hands with its foot. “Seriously?”
“You idiot,” Draco growls under his breath as soon as his hands are free.
“Malfoy?”
“Can you hold off?”
“Oh. Yeah. I just—I—”
“What— What about your little boy toy?”
The Gryffindor eyed him suspiciously.
“Shit!” Potter moves his hips and presses his crotch against Draco’s. Ah, just as Draco suspected. Potter is hard as well. It’s thrilling, actually, that so little has to be done to get Potter this riled up, that the proximity of their bodies is seemingly enough to get Potter to make all those delicious, enticing sounds.
“One more thing, then everything will be locked away and gone for good,” Malfoy mutters and tells Zabini to go to the Great Hall without him.
“Harry!”
Draco rolled his eyes, ready to tell the wizard off. Before he got the chance, however, Potter patted the old man’s arm.
He reaches up and lets his fingertips wander over Potter’s beard. The last time he did this, he was disappointed to the level of devastation; Potter’s face had been impassive. Now, there’s so much heat in his eyes, Draco thinks he’s going to burst into flames. Is he finally feeling what Draco is feeling? Does he—
His thoughts are interrupted by the familiar squeaking noise of the hospital wing door and footsteps. They’re slow and determined, unlike Madam Pomfrey’s. But she seems to be there, too. Harry can hear her whispering agitatedly.
Draco felt a prickle on the back of his neck which he tried very hard to ignore. Slowly, he took a deep breath, hoping Potter wouldn’t notice. “What exactly are you saying, then?”
make me… very hungry.” His voice drops on the last two words and he sounds so husky, all Draco wants to do is climb onto his lap. “And you’re right, this is my lunch and my dinner. But also breakfast.”
Potter grins at him. “Hmmm. Maybe another time.”
“What?”
“I’m fine,” Draco says through gritted teeth.
“Is it something I did?” Potter asked, sounding genuinely unsure. Draco snorted. “What is it? Talk to me?” Potter lowered his head to catch Draco’s eyes and Draco suddenly felt fingers brushing the hair out of his face.
“Trusting my abilities isn’t the same as trusting me as a person,” Potter calls after him.
“Do tell.”
“Malfoy, we can’t go to bed if you keep sitting there.”
The weird thing was, their friends didn’t even bat an eyelash at their joined hands. They were just talking and laughing as if nothing unusual was going on. Did that mean they were fine with it? Draco had no idea what to make of this…
“I… don’t know,” he said instead. He felt Potter move beside him and kept his face stoic while Potter undoubtedly studied him.
“That was fun! I haven’t been flying in ages.”
When Harry opened his eyes, he saw Malfoy was staring at him. He looked flushed and ruffled. He had never seen him more handsome. Harry pressed himself closer to Malfoy, even though there wasn’t any room left between them.
Potter drops his head and rubs his hand against his forehead. “Fuck!” He suddenly yanks at his cloak and shrugs it off. “I can’t believe I’m doing this.”
“What was that?” he asks, his voice much higher than usual.
Taking a deep breath, he tucks his teeth under his lips and tries again. Malfoy hisses as Harry starts bobbing his head. He feels a hand on his cheek and starts humming in approval at the tender touch. Malfoy’s hips buck, causing Harry to choke. He fights through it, too determined to stop. He slows down, licks the tip, savouring the now more familiar taste, before diving back in. Malfoy’s hand twitches against his cheek and he grabs Harry’s hair. He gently pulls his head back and Harry feels the muscles in the his thigh working furiously against his palm.
Draco didn’t answer but kept staring at his mug.
desperate for human contact. Besides, Harry has a feeling he’s isolating himself, rather than being avoided. But Harry will have none of that. Malfoy can’t fuck with him like that. He’ll get to the bottom of this. He’ll go insane if he doesn’t. It might be part of Malfoy’s devious plan to— Whatever it is.
“Don’t tell me what to do!”
“You should stay here for another day, get some rest,” Madam Pomfrey says. She scurries away and Draco finds himself unable to look Potter in the eye. He tries not to feel disappointed when Potter withdraws his hand and clears his throat.
“Oh, of course I’m the one with the fucked up family.”
“And here I thought you could make yourself useful for a change.”
“Then I’ll try to defend myself,” he answers with a shrug. “I’ll probably grope him somewhere inappropriate, though. You know, given the circumstances.” He gestures to his eyes. “He’ll be so shocked, he’ll forget all about attacking me.”
Potter stepped aside and gestured for Draco to come in. Draco wasted no time and quickly found the chest of drawers in the corner of Potter’s bedroom. He opened the second drawer and took out the little book he had been so desperate to get back.
“Okay, fair enough,” she shrugs.
“Well,” Malfoy smirks. “Go on.”
“Off to brush some unicorn hair?”
“Hey, Hermione.”
“Are you even eating anything?”
Harry straightens himself, embarrassment rushing through him. “That’s bollocks,” he mutters. “I’m not going in there.”
Harry frantically scrambles for his jumper, which he carelessly threw on the floor and accidentally knocks Malfoy’s book out of his hands in the process.
“I can’t believe you,” Draco muttered darkly. “You said it was safe. You even said it would be fun!”
“No,” Harry immediately grumbles. Not after everything the git has done to him.
“For the last time, Potter, stop saying my name.”
“I think you’re a bloody wanker,” he choked.
Annoyed, Draco clicked his tongue.
“Hey Malfoy,” Potter said with a weird expression on his face.
Draco slowly pulls back, keeping his head bowed and avoiding Harry’s eyes. Just as Harry is about to put a finger under his chin, to force him to look up, he turns around and walks over to the door. By now, Harry is more used to seeing his back than his face, and still, the sight shatters his heart into a million pieces. He wants to look away, spare himself the agony of having to watch Draco walk away from him, but he can’t. He can’t keep his eyes off him.
“So,” he sighs, “would you have treated me differently, if you had realised who I was?”
“Mr Malfoy, would you let me do the same to you?”
“What does it look like, Malfoy?” Harry sighed.
He’s thinking the same, right now. How could Potter risk exposure like this? Besides, as if Draco needs any confirmation. Of course he knows it’s him. He’d always know.
Draco closes his eyes and lets his head fall back against the wall as Potter resumes grinding against him. “Hmmm, yes,” he breathes, reaching out to grab Potter’s arse.
“Don’t get too excited. Trees are a pretty extensive topic to research. But it was actually quite fascinating. Did you know that wizards used to believe trees are sacred?”
“As if I like being in the spotlight.”
“Merlin, what were you thinking, making such a mess?”
“Wait, what?” Harry can feel the colour draining from his face.
Huh. Maybe that was his answer after all.
It makes him wonder… Would Ron have become a Death Eater if his parents weren’t as open-minded? What if they had followed all of those moronic Pure-blood values and traditions?
That catches
who’s standing opposite Voldemort.
Even if his own sappiness made him cringe a little bit, it was true. Everything he had ever wanted was right here, holding him in his arms.
Hesitantly, Draco cups Potter’s cheek and lets his lips stretch into a smile. “Fair enough.”
“Again?” she groans. “I read my entire Arithmancy homework out loud last night, even though you didn’t understand a word of it. Aren’t you getting sick of this?”
“Why?” Harry says in a challenging tone. “Is that so hard to believe?”
Draco knows what he wants to ask. He lets him struggle.
“Wait, but Harry said—”
“How are you feeling?” Dumbledore asks. Harry isn’t sure how to answer that. Usually, he would have just said ‘fine’, even if it wasn’t true. In his experience, people don’t really care. But he knows Dumbledore is asking because he genuinely wants to know, and even if Harry lied, Dumbledore would probably see right through him. So Harry decides to ignore the question.
Potter forgive him?
“I really want to kiss you, too,” he whispers, shuddering when their lips brush as he speaks.
“Of course not!”
“Ron and Hermione will be here any second.”
Malfoy grins at him and pats one of his cheeks. “Only with homophobic pricks.”
“You’re out of your mind, Potter.”
“You really need me to explain?” Malfoy deadpans.
“Before we go…”
“I’m not grateful for that,” Harry retorts.
Acting on impulse, Harry takes her hand, relishing the familiar sensation of her skin against his. “You’re not really—I mean, um—”
Harry frowns, fumbling with the hem of his shirt. “Do you think we’ll ever see each other again?”
“So basically, we have no idea where to go from here,” Draco says, putting down his tea. “This should be fun.”
“Yes,” Malfoy whispered.
Ginny considers him for a moment before she lets out a sigh. “Damn it, I wanted to yell at you for moving on so quickly, but—”
has changed!”
“It’s nothing illegal.”
Something is placed on his forehead. It’s cool. It feels good.
“You just said you couldn’t risk—”
“He’s a really good friend. My best friend. He always has my back. Except in fourth year. I still can’t believe he was jealous of me becoming a Triwizard Champion. We didn’t speak for weeks. That wanker really thought I was enjoying myself.”
Draco’s eyes widened. “No,” he breathed without missing a beat. “You can’t control it. Even if you manage to do it, you don’t know how to turn back into… you.”
Hoping he wasn’t overstepping any boundaries, he placed several kisses on his belly before he wrapped his arms around Potter’s midriff and nestled his cheek against his skin. Potter stood perfectly still; Draco wasn’t even sure if he was still breathing.
Potter hummed in response and pushed Draco’s shirt out of the way to suck on the spot where his neck connected with his shoulder.
“You know what I want,” he said softly. “It’s right here in front of me.”
Silence, Harry learns, has become his greatest enemy. Closely followed by patience. He’s made his peace with disappointment; and yet, he’s surprised, and his heart sinks, when he hears the curtain being moved again, followed by footsteps. He should have seen it coming, really. He’s being naive, and he knows it.
“Hmmm, that depends,” Malfoy grins, pushing Harry down on the sofa and climbing onto him.
Malfoy’s features twist into a wicked grin. “Honestly? As soon and as hard as possible.”
“What?”
“You couldn’t get out of the Manor fast enough!”
They don’t go far, just a few doors down, before Kreacher grabs one of the door handles and gestures for them to go inside. He bows again before he slams the door shut behind them.
“You sure about that?”
“So are you free later?”
Harry’s eyes widen when he moves closer and puts his arm on the backrest.
“I was kidding,” Draco said, feeling extremely awkward. Bickering with Potter was easy. This, however, whatever it was, was uncomfortable. Potter seemed to think so as well and visibly tried to compose himself as he fumbled with his scarf.
“Okay, my turn,” Theo grinned. “Are the rumours really true?”
“What?”
Before he knows what he’s doing, he murmurs, “Your hand isn’t clammy.” He freezes, mentally slapping himself for sounding so fucking disappointed.
“Draco,” the low voice says again, and Draco looks up. There, in the ornate frame that had been empty when he entered the headmaster’s office, is Dumbledore, gazing at him with a saddened expression.
“Here, have a cupcake. I have a feeling it might be your favourite flavour.” Honestly, Harry was a little surprised not all the cupcakes were raspberry flavoured.
“Okay,” Potter shrugged.
“We both knew what we were doing.”
“Come on,” Harry laughs and takes both of Malfoy’s hands. “When was the last time you went out into the rain?” He starts spinning them around, surprised Malfoy is letting him. The rain on his face is cool and tingles. It’s amazing.
“Here, are you hungry?”
His excitement turns into something more serious as he scrambles off the floor.
“I know, I know.” Harry leans back and stares at the ceiling. “Let’s just hope it isn’t permanent. Maybe it will just go away.”
“January 1999?” His pale eyebrows disappear into his fringe. “That’s not a happy memory.”
“And I’ll promise you again, I’ll do everything in my power to help you do it.”
“We—We should—” Draco gulped, too mesmerised by the flush on Potter’s cheeks.
“When Malfoy ran off, it almost seemed like—”
“Is that Harry Potter?”
“That doesn’t change—”
“Dear Merlin, what are you, Potter, five?” Malfoy sneers. But it hasn’t escaped Harry that his cheeks have turned pink and his voice is a bit shaky.
“Merlin, Potter, can’t you tell when I’m teasing? Clearly, you’re out of practice.”
Convincing the owner of the restaurant to cancel all the reservations for the evening is such a piece of cake, Draco wonders why he even bothered doing it this early. Some things are so easy when you’re rich. Even the string quartet couldn’t say no to his offer. They can play at the Royal Albert Hall, or whatever it’s called, anytime, can’t they?
“But why didn’t you—”
“We know what you meant,” Pansoyle said, his… her smirk widening.
“There was, um— Harry collected a memory from him and—”
“My mother was a Muggleborn,” Harry says quietly. “I’m a Half-Blood. Does that make me filthy? Do I disgust you? Did you have to force yourself to touch or kiss me? Why did you even do it?”
Draco let himself be lead into the house, into the hallway, where Potter stopped and pulled him close.
“So, Potter, my question is… Is the person you fancy in this room?” Blaise looked so smug, Harry wanted to punch him in the face. Before he knew it, his eyes darted over to Malfoy who was watching him intently. He quickly looked away again, his eyes burning a hole into the carpet. He knew fighting the Veritaserum was pointless. His tongue was curling unpleasantly, forcing him to open his mouth.
It’s been days since Hermione ran out of the hospital wing, intent on going to the library. She hasn’t shown up again, which Harry tries to interpret as a good sign. She’s researching. Dumbledore hasn’t come back either. After he left, Harry realised they should have talked about the horcruxes. Then again, they had too big of an audience for that.
“The thought of hurting you—” Potter shakes his head. “It’s more than that though.”
“Coffee?”
As Draco sat there, feeling dizzy all over again, he came to the conclusion he couldn’t really be blamed for any of this. It wasn’t his fault he couldn’t get the insufferable prat out of his head. No, it was entirely Potter’s fault. And he was going to pay for it.
“Really?” Potter still sounded like he couldn’t believe a word Draco was saying.
Imagine Harry dragging the Marauder’s Map everywhere with him, just so he can keep an eye on Malfoy at all times. (Yeah okay, you don’t really have to imagine this part, because it happened.) Ron and Hermione are so fed up with him, because Harry is so absorbed in his map, they can’t even have a normal conversation with him.
Before Potter knows what’s happening, Draco lunges at him. His fist connects with his jaw and Potter stumbles backward. He blinks a few times, obviously flabbergasted and blinks at Draco stupidly. After a moment, he frowns.
“Give me your hand.”
“For what exactly?” Harry frowns.
Ron huffs and crosses his arms. “Well, if I’m a teaspoon, you’re… you’re… a pastry fork! Ha!”
“Stop that, whatever you’re doing,” Potter grumbles. Draco’s jaw clenches and he rips out the pages even more forcefully. It helps with the anger coursing through him, but he still feels the urge to take the book and toss it at Potter and his stupid scar.
After clearing the table, Potter announced he’d take a walk through the garden, and before Draco could respond, he had already vanished. Honestly, Draco felt relieved. He didn’t want to talk about it and he couldn’t have dealt with Potter peeking over his shoulder while he was working on his potions.
“Yeah, I, err—” Harry licked his lips again.
should stick around and see if she wants to talk again.”
“Something troubling you?” Draco asks in a tone that very much suggests he’s merely making polite conversation.
“But I swear to god, Draco, if you ever do something like that again, I—”
Before he could stop himself, he crossed the room and opened the door. He inwardly chuckled when he saw Potter’s face. Yes, definitely worth it.
Potter pulled back, an odd expression on his face.
“You know, I told you to owl me if you wanted to grab drinks.” He didn’t sound offended, which made Draco wonder why he was bringing it up at all.
“Alright then, I’ll go back to the penguins,” the second keeper said. Before he turned to go, he gave Teddy a thumbs up. “Cool hair, kid.”
“Maybe I should have let it scar,” he murmured. “I wish it would fade completely.”
“You don’t know how,” he echoes. “Are you—No. Are you saying you’ve never done this before?”
“Of course not,” Draco grumbles. He crosses his arms in front of his chest defensively. “What does it mean?”
What he wanted to say the most was that even if they had been awful to each other in school, even if they had been on opposing ends in the war, even if it had taken Harry years to realise it, if there was a chance Malfoy felt the same as Harry, everything would have been worth it.
They made it past the cafeteria before either of them said anything.
Bravery was a strange thing.
“How about we get a ladder?” he suggested.
Oceania slung an arm around his shoulders. “What are you guys talking about?” She wrinkled her nose as Hayden tapped her nose with the chopsticks.
“He did have a habit of being surprisingly brave when you least expected him to be,” she decided once the spoon had been removed.
how he had imagined it, so much so that it was surprising.
Harry swore voraciously.
Ron finally re-emerged from behind the tankard. He looked at Harry, and his eyes were kind.
Ron glanced at him out of the corner of his eye, looking a little anxious. “And…you’re not going back, are you?”
“I like boys too.” says Harry. “I didn’t think you cared.”
They made their way to the sofas, and slumped down on the one nearest to one of the glittery columns. There were framed pictures on the walls, but Harry didn’t really recognise any of the bands or people. He took a sip of his water and watched as Oceania took a sip of hers, tabasco sauce and all.
“Yeah,” said Harry, “Thanks.”
And then the restlessness got so bad sometimes that he would find his heart beating quickly for no reason at all, and he couldn’t stop shaking and or worrying, and he wouldn’t be able to do any of the things he was supposed to. And then when that happened he found himself feeling empty – and that feeling was rather like the blue.
Harry closed his eyes. His body ached, all over, from the crying. The humiliation of was still stretched tight within him.
Oceania did not seem particularly perturbed by the crying. She just held him comfortingly, as if she had known from the moment she had seen him at her door at god knows what time in the morning that he was here for a good crying session. She probably had. Everyone could probably see it on him.
"You don't deserve Draco. He had a life before you! He's a great Curse Breaker and he doesn't need you."
"I'm a married man sir," Draco said with a hand to his chest dramatically, "how dare you insinuate such a thing."
"You know," Draco started when they were both sitting in the astronomy tower, "if you keep staring at me like that when we're in public, someone is bound to find out."
"Potter, don't act like an idiot. You're Head Auror for a reason. You're smart and handsome and people trust you-"
"Do you know if he's seeing anyone?"
' or '
"Yeah," Harry says with a grin, staring into his eyes, "you're not getting rid of me that easily."
"Ackers," Harry says through clenched teeth, slamming his mug on the table. "Move it or lose it."
"I've already talked to him," Harry said confused.
"He was- I- It was just a bloody joke! I wanted to see him get jealous. I wanted him to- I don't know- get angry enough to shag me on the stairs or something, not just-" He groaned before turning an angry gaze towards Travis. "You just had to challenege him didn't you?"
"We're going to a muggle place?" Draco asked surprised. They owned a car, sure, but only for muggle excursions. For places that it would seem odd to just appear to. Otherwise they just apparated and walked.
without knowing all the facts. He bares his teeth when he realizes he probably did. Though even he'd known better than to think the man who thwarted the Dark Lord multiple times throughout his childhood wasn't at least a little smart and survival savvy.
with the man he loves.
"I know it's a mess," Draco said tossing it back over his shoulder before looking pointedly at Harry's mop of messy dark curls, "but you hardly have room to criticize. Now stop staring into space. The first task is dragons and as you know-"
The first rule of being a sex slave was obedience.
--:--
"Yeah, of course," he said offhandedly before stopping her loudly as she started writing out a list of things to do. "Wait! I should-uh...probably talk to Draco about this first."
"Ah," said Draco, "flattery will get you everywhere, Potter."
"Absolutely."
He brushes past both of them and into his office but before he could get the door shut, Draco's foot was holding it open.
"Not as much as I would if you said my name," The man behind him leaned forward and licked the sweat from the poor ravenette's neck while still running the end of the riding crop against the warm, sensitive skin.
"I don't know what rumors you've started, Ackers, but Draco and I have been married for longer than either of us have had a job in the Ministry and I love him with everything I've got." Harry takes a step closer, not breaking eye contact but the air is starting to crackle around them. It smells like a storm brewing on the quidditch pitch when he lifts a finger and pokes at Travis' chest. "I am smart enough to let my husband make his own friends and decisions because he is a grown man, but if you ever approach me like this again it will be the end of you. I'm an Auror and the bloody saviour of the Wizarding world and you think I'd be scared of you? Please. I won't hesitate to turn you into a beetle and crush you under my heel. Do I make myself clear?"
"Just- forget I said anything." Harry turned away annoyed and lifted his hand to knock on the door, but no one answered. He tried again to no avail. He rolled his eyes before just opening his husband's office door to find the blond face down on a stack of papers, snoozing softly. "Wanker," the ravenette said fondly before shaking Draco's shoulder gently. The blond blinked open his eyes slowly then grinned up at Harry.
"No. I just thought- I mean, since we're telling people now..."
"Er- hey, Travis," he tried politely. They could try being friends now, right? Draco didn't have many work friends. Everyone thought he was a bit scary. "Is Malfoy busy or something?"
Harry narrowed his eyes, but let him go anyway. Once the pale man was gone Ron turned to face him.
"I'm not going to make announcements," the blonde said immediately, but he was purposefully not making eye contact. "I'm going to schedule a portkey before the offices close for the day."
Harry places a hand over his.
It tells him that Harry is going to be here. Has always been there.
"Merlin's sake," Draco says softly, practically in awe. They've been married for years, but that soft uncomfortable look in Harry's eyes when he thinks he's unwanted is still there. A part of Draco knows it will always be there, but he grips both of his husband's hands in his. "Harry, I love you, never doubt that; I'd scream it from the rooftops if I didn't think I'd look like a wild veela."
"You can think in the car," Harry insists, placing a chaste kiss on his husband's lips as if he just couldn't help it.
The man in question moaned around the cock in his mouth as his actual dick began spurting all over the floor in front of him. Malfoy grunted behind him as he tightened around him from the pleasure of release, causing the blonde to cum inside of him.
"Auror Amin, right?" Harry asks and laughs when the man sends him an awed nod. "See they've got you playing ministry elf today, yeah?"
"You'll like it, I promise!" he called back with an easy grin as his black hair blew in the wind making it an even bigger mess than it usually was.
"This is the most attention I've gotten since..." He shakes his head.  "It's different when they want an interview for a case or something, but I haven't had this much attention on me since the trials. What if they bring them up again?"
felt pity after saving Harry. He'd only felt glad that he was okay.
He closes the box and watches as the blue glow seeps out of Travis and back into the box. Then it's as if a fog is lifted from the entirety of the ministry. The people around them in the office start to wake up and he grabs the box as evidence before rushing upstairs to meet Harry.
"Mhm," hums Harry. "Was that all?"
"I'll look at you in my office then. I got a few papers I need to fill out." He tugs at Draco's hand to pull him along. And he would have, if his vision doesn't start to wane, everything around him looking blurry and distorted even through his glasses. He passes out  in  Draco's arms and when the blond looks up, the room seems to have been put in the same predicament.
"What's wrong?"
"Are you enjoying yourself, Ma-Master?"
," he said emphatically, "he always wants to make a scene.
His head is in his hands and he is taking deep breaths. The hand on his shoulder is shaking but firm and he looks up into grey eyes that he knows are molten silvery in the sunlight and looks away again.
--:--
"What did you really bring me up here for, Potter?" The blonde asked not looking anywhere but the darker man's eyes, as always, blown wider, but slightly less green by his rounded frames.
"She hasn't asked."
The glint in Harry's eyes made him shut his mouth on whatever else he could have thought to say. They had kissed, of course they had. Harry had given Draco a blowjob more times than he could count by this point, but he never let him reciprocate. He had asked, because
"I told you we should have hired someone from the DMLE to watch the perimeters," says Draco crossing his arms and looking over their property "Mother's going to be absolutely livid. She still haven't forgiven the bastards for destroying the rose bushes she planted in the front garden."
"Yeah," Harry agreed, back to staring at Malfoy in a way that was starting to make the blond blush to the tips of his ears. "Me too."
"But you," he continues as if Draco hadn't said anything and the blonde wonders if the other man has seriously lost his mind, "You're brilliant. You have opinions about the world and you're great at your job and you take care of all the juniors."
talk to my
"It's terrific," Draco started with a shrug, running a hand through Harry's hair, "but I haven't been too worried about it, if I'm honest. Not anymore. I'm good at my job, and she knows it. They all do."
“Well,” he said, after a long pause. “This is rather ridiculous, isn’t it?”
“It’s against my religion,” he blurted, in a horrific last ditch attempt, and then prepared for death.
“We meet for drinks quite often,” said Luna. “If that’s what you’re asking, Harry. Once he cooked me dinner, as well. Languini. It was quite nice.”
Then next act came on, and then it was the interlude. A few people seemed to recognise Malfoy, stopping to chat to him and eyeing Harry up rather obviously. Then Benjamin came by.
Harry glanced at Malfoy and then wished he hadn’t when he realised Oceania was still watching him.
“Really?” he muttered.
Draco pushed back his long white fringe and peered at Harry from underneath it. He smiled devilishly.
“In. And out.”
“I can’t believe you still call me Malfoy,” She says, rolling her hips deplorably. “Even though you’ve eaten maple syrup and whipped cream out of me.”
“I’m not any good.”
There was a sharp squawking sound to his left and he looked over. There was Jane, in the training pen he had first been assigned to. She stared at him with her glossy, navy eyes, as if taking him. She had been chained down now, just like the rest of the dragons, once the connection had gotten strong enough to keep her tame. It was nothing inhumane – just a functional metal band around one of her legs. It was logical, if you wanted to tame a dragon, that you would keep them confined.
Malfoy looked at him. He stopped scrambling.
“Draco?” he called out, just before Malfoy got to the door. Malfoy paused, then looked over his shoulder.
Harry avoids Malfoy for a week after that. When she finally caves in again, she finds herself leaning against the wall, with Malfoy glaring at her from across the hall.
But it felt a lot like dying.
“Oceania kicked me out because the bowling girl turned up to confess her undying love,” Harry said in one breath. “How has your evening been?”
Malfoy waved a pink bottle in front of Harry that said “THE THIRST IS REAL” and in smaller writing underneath, “PINK”.
“I can apologise,” Harry offered.
Fieldwork –
He enjoyed the walk. He enjoyed the view. And even though he enjoyed his new friends, he still often enjoyed his own company in a way that was irreplaceable. He knew how to be lonely. He didn’t know how to be in constant company.
Harry looked over again, to where Malfoy was hitting Oceania’s shoulder with the tea cosy as she held him down like a wrestler. He felt an abrupt wave of – not fondness. But rather, an acknowledgement. An acknowledgement of the fact that there was something just a little wonderful about Gay Dragon Village and all that it encompassed.
“What the fuck,” said Harry, and raised his hands to the heavens, “Gay Dragon Village? What does that even mean?”
“Who even needs that much lube? What are you doing with it?”
Harry wanted to want for the rest of his life.
“Actually,” he said very carefully after a moment. “I…I, urm, think I’m bisexual.”
isn’t a vow of unwavering union,” said Malfoy.
The real challenge, it turns out, is the purchasing. Draco sends Harry to the till first as he remembers they need dental floss, and when he comes back Harry is gesticulating wildly with a panicked look in his eyes.
Harry turns his gaze skyward and quirks his nose, as if in deep thought.
He made a cup of coffee. It wasn’t very sensible, considering that it was the evening, but there was a slightly fancy coffee machine that someone had probably bought for him once and that he’d never really used. Abruptly, he found that he wanted to be in the kitchen. He wanted to use it.
“And - about making her feel safe.”
Malfoy bat his lashes prettily. “Not both hands.”
They finished early and headed back down to the cafeteria. Hayden was there reading a book. When they saw them walking towards them, they got up.
“Well,” said Luna, after a minute. “Aren’t you going to continue?”
“I just don’t get what I’m doing wrong,” said Harry for the third time that afternoon. He sounded like a child. Draco tried very, very hard to fight against the instinct to feel
There was still so much he didn’t know. He wondered if it was possible to ever really know anyone.
– there was the position that had hurt so much the first time Harry had done yoga. He still couldn’t fully straighten his leg yet, but it didn’t hurt like it used to; whether that was a product of already experiencing it once or a sign of progress he didn’t know. Regardless, it didn’t hurt like it used to. Harry breathed in and out. It hurt, but it seemed to be a good hurt. Harry hadn’t known such a thing existed.
Harry blinked. “Yes,” he told her. In his mind, the rush of mountains and trees and clear blue skies rushed past him. “It was very pretty.”
“And it’s not because I’m – because I don’t like it here.”
The girl nodded. “You don’t look very healthy,” she declared after a long moment.
The use of his first name caught Harry off guard. He tried to think of any other occasion Malfoy had used it and couldn’t. Did Malfoy think of him as
“I wasn’t being funny,” he said quickly. “I meant it.”
But he needed this. It wasn’t as though he’d never flown before. It wasn’t even as though he’d never ridden a dragon before. But this wasn’t about that.
“You’d let him get close enough to do that?” Delia was smug.
“I didn’t do any fucking,” said Harry. “Why would I?”
“Legs?” Malfoy was staring at Harry with wide eyes in something akin to wonder. “You’re telling me you’re straight because of girls’ legs?”
going.” Then he wrinkled his nose. “Do you actually own a pair of matching socks?”
Harry rolled his eyes and put the butter back in the fridge just to have something to do.
When he opened them, Jane was swallowing the meat, her wings flapping a little as it disappeared down her scaled throat. He looked over his shoulder, and Malfoy was smiling, just a little, in the corner of his mouth. His eyes met Harry’s.
Harry took some. Malfoy did not.
“Thanks, Osh.” He was a bit choked up. Behind them, he was aware that the others had started up their own conversation. He was glad for the chance to bury his face against someone’s shoulder and catch himself.
God, girls get her crazy.
“Better,” said Harry, and Malfoy’s pink little mouth fell open. His breath was coming quick now, his tongue darting out to lick anxiously at his thin lower lip. Harry wanted to stretch it thinner.
“Who said I was straight?”
“Because I wanted to touch you,” he said, at long last.
They went. They were fucking late.
“A visual poem,” Harry bullshitted on the spot. “Look, it’s hard to explain. Have you eaten?”
Malfoy tapped his foot impatiently. “Tell me you’ve brought the correct files.”
“Thanks, Osh,” Harry said tiredly. He was looking at where Malfoy was still making muffled noises. When he managed to lift his head, he took one look at the lettering on the tank, and bit down on his lip. Hard.
“Ah.” Harry leaned forward, settling his clasped hands on the table. “I love that bit.”
It was – simpler, that was for sure. No four-poster bed. Just an ordinary single in the middle of the room, complete with a polka dot duvet and pillowcase set. Draco Malfoy liking polka dots was never something Harry thought he would have to know, but now he did and there was no un-knowing it. Draco Malfoy liked polka dots. He felt like he would have to tell somebody about this. Surely, everybody should know.
Harry didn’t want to feel what Jane felt. Even thinking about it made the blue rise up through him. It would fill him up, and it would drown him, it would drown him, it would drown –
It was strange, but Harry had never been to a temple. It was different from a church, or a cathedral. Not so polished and proper. Not so civil. It roused something primal inside him, some deep-rooted instinct of worship, of silence. A desire to go to his knees. To offer himself.
The photos Harry had taken were splayed out on the desk between them. Harry had been trying to not look directly at them.
Malfoy twirled his fork thoughtfully as he located his next fruity victim. “Thing is,” he murmured. “I’m not sure I want to be somewhere I won’t be fully appreciated.”
“I’m sorry if…about the comments. Like, if the way I talk makes you think like that.”
Draco smiled wider. His mouth opened.
Harry’s body was reacting the way most bodies reacted in result to being in close proximity to other bodies. Which was to say, readily. It was not his fault. He could not control his body.
“Is this supposed to be helping me?”
“Draco?” he said, again, feeling like a child.
“Is that Victoria’s Secret?”
Draco hums under his breath and examines his French manicure. He’d gotten it earlier, and Harry had groaned and rolled his eyes for the whole two hours.
“Draco,” Harry says again. “I still want to go. Somewhere. With you.”
Oceania caught him while he was eating a banana on his way back from the canteen.
“I have a question,” said Harry, as they made their way into the bathroom and Draco began rummaging through the cabinet behind the mirror. “It’s very important.”
“I think you’d better,” Charlie said, still very serious, and led the way.
“I’m not.” Harry looked down at his fingers. A few seconds of silence passed, and then he said, quite truthfully, “I think I needed to come back.”
“Shall we?”
“It’s not stereotyping if it’s true,” Malfoy said easily. Harry couldn’t believe he was having this conversation.
“You’re mad.” says Draco. “Completely deluded.”
“Is this okay?” asked Harry.
“I’m sorry for being a cheap bitch at Hogwarts,” said Pansy. She said it very drily, and her cat-like eyes didn’t stray from Harry’s for even a moment. She really was wearing a lot of eyeliner. “I’m still a bitch, but I’m not cheap.”
It was Malfoy’s turn to shoot Tom a dirty look, whilst Harry shot Malfoy an amused one. He decided he quite liked Tom.
Draco met his gaze steadily. He stood.
“No,” Harry was forced to say, “Jane.”
“How about you sit on Draco’s shoulders while I’m still sitting on yours?” said Oceania.
It’s a nice cottage, to be fair. There isn’t anything wrong with it. The wood linings on the outside are painted blue, and the cement between the beams is painted white. There is moss growing on one side. It has a chimney, and two bedrooms, and a bathroom, and a kitchen which is open to the smallish lounge. It’s fine. It’s nice. The kettle is broken, has been for the past year, but Draco doesn’t mind. Draco has simply been boiling her tea water in a pot instead.
She smiled at him. “Buzzing isn’t the right word. I got it wrong.”
Harry walked into the cafeteria and spotted Oceania and Hayden talking at one of the tables. They’d been together that morning. He headed over.
“You know what?” he said, and hated the way his voice came out. Making it obvious as fucking daylight how hard he had to try. How hard he always tried. “You could just have some sensitivity. If you really didn’t want to fight.”
“Nope, not at all.” As he said it, however, the coffee was already disappearing from the fabric. Harry leaned back. Draco made a point of being very busy with his putting down of things.
“I can show you the lounge,” said Draco, after another moment. Harry followed him.
Malfoy’s eyes met his sharply, and then he slowly raised a brow.
Jane had her eyes closed when they arrived. The sunlight was gleaming off her scales, sticking itself to her long blue eyelashes. Harry hadn’t even noticed that she had eyelashes before.
Harry closed his mouth.
Maybe sex is about pleasure, and maybe it’s about pain, and maybe it’s about the delicate pulling and pushing between disgust and desire – maybe it’s about all of that, and maybe it’s also a very little bit about love. A very little bit about home. A very little bit about feeling safe, even when you’re raw. Maybe it’s about how safety is in the rawness, or rawness is in the safety.
Malfoy pulled the brush away from his eye and gestured with it. “Potter, this is Benjamin Poppers. Potter, meet Poppers.”
Ginny nodded, not looking at him. “He doesn’t answer Mum’s letters.”
Jane was chewing on her talon. Malfoy frowned at her but stood up, stretching. His spine popped audibly as he sighed. Harry watched his shoulder bones slide under his shirt. Once he was done, he looked back over his shoulder.
Harry blinked, and then looked away, running a hand through his hair. “No,” he said. “No, I – it doesn’t matter. I – that was kind of you. Thanks.”
It always took a few minutes for the shower water to heat up, but by now Harry was used to it. He stood under the onslaught of the cold sleeting down his back and stared out at the very small window in the corner of the bathroom. The glass had fogged up in front of it, unfocusing the lines and shapes around him. When he stepped back under the water and let it submerge his face, it got even simpler, everything melting except the small patch of light directly ahead.
Malfoy glanced over. His skin was shiny, catching the sunlight, and his hair had plastered down to his forehead in places. Ruddiness flourished across his flesh like flowerets, saturated especially in the parted set of his mouth.
He sat down in front of her. His heart was beating furiously in his chest, the way it always did when he was this close up to her, but that was alright. That was alright.
“Fancy a drink?”
“Yes,” he said, “I suppose you will.”
“It’s alright,” Harry repeated, grinning and leaning back against the sofa. “But it’s no butterbeer.”
“Just Osh.” Harry smiled, a little unsure. “It’s early. And we already did last night.”
Draco goes into town to buy sugar. And then she comes home – and the walk down the stone path is really much prettier this way, it really is – and then she makes the tea, and every step of it feels like making love.
Something inside him relaxed. He sat back in his chair. “Yes,” he said. “From – me.”
Draco bursts into tears.
Harry treated Draco like he was always honest. It made him want to be so.
“Something evil and full of dark magic, I’m sure.” Malfoy came back out. “Oh, those. My Gene Bilbrew prints.
Once tea was made, Hayden led them to the bedroom. They sat in the middle of the bed and produced a bag full of purple fluff, and then reached over into one of the bedside drawers and returned with several sheets of white paper and filters. Oceania came in carrying the tea, handing one to Harry. She’d calmed down, but her face was still slightly pink.
“What? No.” Harry frowned. “It’s nice to see you.”
“So.” Charlie flung open the cage door with more casualness than Harry deemed appropriate and stepped back. “The first step is to think of a name.”
Malfoy’s eyes grew gentle. “Doesn’t it?”
“I thought you’d like it better. You like to feel respected.”
“You’re right love,” he replied, distracted now by the process of applying cream to his scone via the fork. Harry stared.
“Let’s go over the basics of training,” said Charlie, and turned back to the waiting dragon, “It’s pretty easy stuff.”
“Oh,” she said, like it was commonplace to have a stranger swearing at you midst downward dog, “You’re the new one, aren’t you?”
“Here, here,” said Ron, his voice muffled by the butterbeer.
Harry suddenly felt childish, and abruptly ashamed.
And then it was gone.
“He’s in Singapore,” whispers Draco, and closes her eyes. “He’s in hiding. Harry, please.”
“I need you,” he said quietly, concentrating hard. It was essential he get this right. “I need you…to get me a mountain.”
He felt his shoulders jump. “No, thanks,” he said, quite quickly. “It’s just – I feel likes there’s been an, uh, population increase. Lately.”
“I’m not sure yet,” said Harry, “How long do people normally stay?”
Right now he was reading some contemporary stuff. It was slow-paced, but he didn’t mind. He read fast anyway. The sun went down.
Harry nodded earnestly.
Draco didn’t smile, exactly. He just held Harry’s hand, and pushed back against the water. Harry swam forward.
“Do they taste off to you Harry? I think they’re out of date.”
Harry’s gaze snapped back to his face. “What? I wasn’t stalking you. I was getting coffee with my friend. I just saw you and thought I would say hello.”
“You’re the one who wanted to
He had said it very quietly. Harry found himself wishing he wasn’t drunk anymore. Conversations like this were supposed to be carefully navigated. But Harry already hated being careful, anyway.
Draco laughed again, this time with surprise. “What’s wrong with my leggings?”
Charlie lifted his head from the straw. There was froth on his nose. “Draco,” he said, sounding quite beside himself. “This is miraculous.”
“Right,” Harry managed finally, once he’d got his voice under control. “Of course.”
She smiled pleasantly at him. He smiled back.
“Okay.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened in something like alarm. Enough seconds passed that Harry began to feel embarrassed, but then Malfoy lifted his fingers. They were long, like his arm, like his face. They were long, and they quivered as they curled, ever so gently, around Harry’s jaw. Harry wrapped his hand around Malfoy’s wrist to still them, around the bouquet of blue veins.
Harry didn’t look at Malfoy to see his reaction. He thought about the question.
“Why do you say that?”
“You don’t know anything,” she says, quietly, brushing her finger back and forth.
Ironically, Harry did have tame dreams that night. When he woke up, he woke up feeling uncomfortable.
Harry felt his entire body flush. It was a terrifying, intensely sensorial experience. He wanted to ask, “What about me?” but couldn’t. He was overwhelmed – cocooned in the sudden, startling fear of the feeling.
Charlie led Harry around to front of the pens, and showed him the cafeteria.
“Draco.” Charlie wrinkled his nose. “Do you have to?”
“I’m very open about my perversions. It’s you who lives a life of deceit.”
Someone had been shouting nearby for a while. As Harry began to listen in, he realised it sounded quite familiar.
Malfoy’s eyes were wide, his arms tight across his chest.
Draco blinked down at him. They watched as he walked away and went back behind the bar. He started blasting “Just Dance”. Slowly, but surely, the rest of the pub went back to talking amongst themselves.
Hayden raised their eyebrows at him, very, very slowly. “Did you think we didn’t know who you are?”
“Oh.” Oceania blinked. Then she smiled very kindly, and brushed two fingers over his shoulder. “Well, that’s perfectly okay.”
“That’s not going to work,” said Draco, but immediately fell back into kissing Harry, rocking against him and letting him continue squeezing him. It was too much – it wasn’t enough. Harry was so turned on he might just die.
“It’s relationship-forming,” said Malfoy, without looking up, “You need to establish affection.”
Harry pressed the grainy paper of the first page between his fingers. “Agnes Grey. The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. A set of poems with her sisters, but it’s published under their male pseudonyms.”
“Malfoy. What is it?”
Harry closed his eyes. “Yes,” he said simply. He felt along for the connection in his mind and found it – there – sensitive like a nerve. He followed it, leaned into it – and then Jane was right there, right here, in his mind, in his soul – they were together, at one in their most vulnerable places. Harry found where he was hurting, and found her. He used the hurt – he was using it to make himself stronger. No, not stronger. Bigger. Not bigger.
“Oh,” said Harry. He moved out the way as Oceania reached to open the fridge. His heart was thundering. He swallowed. “Yes. Please.”
Harry was still smiling. “I just want to know you,” he admitted, softly.
Oceania’s fingers were slender and delicate. Harry felt them fit in the spaces between his.
“He’s Harry,” he said, and then cleared his throat again, at once exasperated. “Harry Potter. You know Harry Potter, Tom.”
said Draco, just to rub it in that he could say it.
Draco closes her eyes, and then opens them.
“Well,” sighed Draco, once he was safely in the basket of Harry’s arms. His eyes were glittering. “Before you carry me over the threshold, I should warn you that I’m not actually a virgin.”
Draco laughed. His face was open and happy. “You come here often?” he asked playfully, quirking a brow.
“No,” said Malfoy. “I’m not angry.”
“I’m not sure I quite got there,” said Malfoy, and Harry looked up to see him wrinkling his nose, which, for some reason, was abruptly relieving. “But…”
"Sometimes I don't really believe all this has happened, you know?" said Draco as Harry braided his, now, long-ish silver hair.
And just like that Draco Malfoy kissed him, he tasted like chocolate and strawberries, his lips so soft and unsure. Harry tried to deepen the kiss but he felt the other boy pull away.
"Where are we going?" Draco asked as he took it
“Really? Harper is going to be over the moon with this, that kid had been trying to take your spot since forever,” Blaise said before leaving, and it was true, maybe in another life Draco would never let this happen, but lately flying only made him feel sick and nauseous, and besides he had more important things to do.
"Well, either you start talking or I don't know what I'm going to do because Nott's father is not going to be happy once he finds out his son was beaten half to death by you and Mr. Zabini"
He felt a pair of lips against his, and at that moment Draco doesn’t care about how the kiss tasted like salt, or how he dropped the cup of cocoa, or how the sweater he’s wearing is stupidly thin for this weather. What he does think is about Harry’s hand feels on his waist, and how right the kiss feels, how his stomach feels like a million fluttering butterflies and how loved he feels.
"How was Christmas?" he dared to ask as they continued to walk to the living room.
"Oh, but that's where you're wrong Draco, I'm left with a bitch who helps me relieve my needs while looking pretty beside me, and I get to make your life miserable for being a failure, just like your father, at following the Dark Lords wishes," the boy got dangerously close to Malfoy but he didn't coward
"I don't think I'm going to last longer Harry," moaned Draco and Harry took it as a sign to fast his pace fucking his boyfriend harder and deeper, which only caused for Draco to scratch Harry's back as he came hard, Harry following him seconds after. And for the first time in a while Draco felt so full and happy, he wanted to feel like this forever.
Professor Slughorn still wondered how Harry managed to be first of his class to the worst potion student he has seen in a while, of course, and all Harry could think about was if the professor knew Seamus he wouldn’t think so low of him but there was no need to put down his friend in order to feel better, after all, he has always sucked at potions and if it wasn’t for the book that shall remain unnamed he would've still sucked at potions on 6th year… among other things, like, I don’t know, NOT being close to killing Draco Malfoy! He sighed, he was pretty sure his potion was about to explode any minute now, so why bother to try and end up making it worse?
"Smooth Potter, but if you don't mind I would love to leave out your sex life from my memories," said Pansy half-disgusted and half-amused.
"Hermione said that it was common in the muggle world to give one's parter a promise ring, so that way the relationship felt way more real but not so much as marriage, and of course I want to marry you and have 20 kids but we're too young for that and this seemed apropied, I like the thought of people knowing you're mine
2.- Pro – His eyes were the most beautiful thing he has ever seen, it reminded him of stardust.
3.- Pro – He was smart, and not just book-smart but also other kinds of smart
"Yeah, I think we do," answered Draco, he tried to embody the persona he once was, all the Malfoy aura returned for just a second which seem to surprise Theo.
"Why are you like this? Why are you gaining from this Theo?" Draco dared to ask, he wasn't ready for the answers but this stupid confidence won't last forever, not for a long time at least.
"Sorry, but I bought the ice cream that you wanted and it was melting, also, did you know the Davies' got a dog? It's so big, it scared the shit out of me," Harry explained to his boyfriend while taking his coat off, and giving Draco a kiss of the cheek.
About an hour later Harry decided that he had given his boyfriend enough time to calm down, so he smiled to Hermione and before heading to his room he went to the kitchen to fetch some macarons that Pansy bought. Once outside the door he knocked, it's not like Draco would lock him out of his room but at times like this it felt better to ask rather than suffer the consequences.
“Well yeah mate, but let’s be honest, why would Voldemort want the ferret? I mean, aside from being a Malfoy there’s nothing special about him,”
Whatever, it’s not like a book is going to make him better at potions, if Snape with his fear-induced type of teaching or Hermione’s detailed lessons couldn’t then nothing could at this point.
And so they began to walk to the main street so Harry could pull a cab to take them to the movies. They both agreed to watch a romantic comedy because neither of them was ready to see any kind of violence due to obvious reasons. Draco got terrified of the car, he didn't manage to understand what was going on and he was holding onto Harry's hand with more force than needed.
“Who would’ve thought that Harry Potter was better at potions than the mud-blood,” said Pansy once they were out of the classroom, “if I remember correctly he used to be absolutely rubbish at potions,”
The blond sighed, there was a lot of things he needs to do, he had managed to steal a bit of Polyjuice potion a week ago, as he needed Crabbe and Goyle to stay outside the Room of Requirement for him to be able to get out safely, but it was quickly running out and if he started to borrow too much then Slughorn would definitely notice. He needed to brew some, and sadly the best place to do so was in the second-floor girl’s bathroom, no one liked that place because of Moaning Myrtle, and don’t get Draco wrong, he didn’t want to be there more than necessary but in order for her to not rat him out he needed to be polite, which bring us back to the beginning, Draco Malfoy never learned how to make friends.
And yeah, it was no secret that Pansy had a huge crush on Draco for at least 3 years of her life, but then again after the whole ‘losing my virginity with a Durmstrang boy’ thing that happened on their 4
"No, it's part of the Trick-or-treating thing, children dress up as something like ghosts, vampires or their favourite cartoon and they go house to house saying 'trick or treat' and the owner of the house gives them candy or if you're super lucky money"
“Well, apart from that it’s perfect, I’ve never had such a good student, and I hope you have the same lovely experience with this idiot right here. A thing I’ve discovered over the years is that if Ron and he aren’t together they work better, so good luck!” and with that, she left the library leaving just the two boys.
“I think,” she said, and she looked as serious as Oceania possibly could. “You have to understand that it wasn’t easy for Draco. It wasn’t easy at all. And I think…there was lot of fighting on his part. Whether or not anyone saw it. And so…he resents what he perceives to be…cowardice.”
“Great.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah, fantastic.”
“Astoria. Astoria Rabbit.” When Harry continued to stare blankly, Benjamin stopped prodding his eyelash and hummed exasperatedly. “The blond fag whose house we’re in.”
Malfoy looked blankly at him. “Why would I be?”
Harry blinked.
After a while, Draco said, “Let’s get off.” If Harry hadn’t been feeling so blissed out he might have poked fun at him. They got off, and let Jane wander off.
straight.”
“What am I supposed to do?” asked Harry, amused despite himself. “Whip out a bottle of cleaning solution and some rubber gloves?”
“Stay there,” said the girl, and then untangled her limbs and jumped up with surprising vivacity for someone with so much hair bundled up on her head. She then turned and sprinted off past the archway.
“What about Fleur?” says Harry.
Malfoy widened further. He looked like he wanted to look away but couldn’t.
“Oh, my days,” Malfoy gasped.
“How’s the visual poem going?” He asked, after a moment.
“That,” said Draco, “is so fucking weird.”
Harry blinked. “Oh, urm, Harry is fine.” He took her hand. She was a fair bit shorter than him, but her hair made her seem bigger. “It’s nice to meet you.”
Tom carried on. “Okay, Harry,” he said. “It’s a bit like praying. Most people think meditating is just sitting in silence and not thinking, but that’s not quite right. Meditation is form of access. A way into one’s deepest self.”
“You are human, you know,” said Malfoy, a little more softly, “You’re allowed to be human.”
But then…it was like he got looser. He glanced at Oceania and Hayden, who had lied down on the bed and were murmuring to each other. The world got deeper. He felt his body begin to sink further into the film of reality.
“Mm,” they hummed. “What of them?”
“Alright,” he said. Malfoy was getting up and rolling up his mat. “Some of the positions were. Quite.”
“Isn’t it comforting?”
“How did you do it?” Malfoy had stopped gnawing. There was something at once desperate and restrained about him. His shoulders were square but bony, the shape of him frail in the dazzling morning. The air tugged at his hair, the folds in his clothes.
“Blaise, I’m a lesbian,” said Luna, but she didn’t look put out. In fact, she was as close to rolling her eyes as Harry had ever seen her.
“Well,” they said. “Why don’t you come be productive with the rest of us?”
Something had already happened.
Luna looked at him now. “And are you in love with him?”
“Hey,” he said, “Erm…”
Ever since he had his little
Malfoy seemed to have got the message though, because suddenly his body was flailing next to Harry’s, the water louder than ever. They struggled until Harry’s feet scraped up against the loch floor, and then they were dripping and carrying each other to dry land.
It was nothing like Scotland. It was everything like Scotland.
Harry rolled his eyes, but felt a bit pink about the whole ordeal. “Thanks,” he said, taking the book and thinking about Draco putting in the effort to do extra research about something that was essentially Harry’s problem.
Even then, it was an expression that Harry wasn’t entirely familiar with. Familiar wasn’t the word. Harry felt as if he should know it, but could not name it. All at once he was struck with a sense of déjà vu, the wavy memories from being high brought forth. He remembered more the feelings than the events, the colours more than the shapes. But he had been close to Malfoy before.
, that’s why.”
It was with that thought in mind that Harry watched the sun finally finish its descent over the clouds. There were worse things, he decided, than ugly tea cosies and mild cross-dressing kinks in the world.
“It’s,” said Harry, and stopped. He swallowed. “I guess it’s that I feel like…like I’m not really living. I’m just passing time. And I’m so lucky to be alive. I know I am. I really, really am. I know that. But I feel like I’m wasting it.”
“Yes,” breathed Draco. Harry asked Jane the same thing.
Heads up: there is a brief use of the f** slur in this chapter, although it's used between friends, not in a derogatory way.
“Stops being funny?” Ginny flipped her hair over her padded shoulder good-naturedly. “Time to quit my job, probably.”
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Okay?” This felt too easy.
“The lovely Oshanoter needs a milkshake!” Malfoy announced to the mostly empty room, and allowed him and Harry to be herded back to the counter. Both he and Oceania ordered milkshakes.  Once they were all seated around a bigger table, Malfoy pushed his milkshake towards Harry.
“Well. It’s the closest we have to a gay bar. What were we going to do, fucking apparate back to London just to drop in at the Village Soho? I don’t think so. You were the one almost puking on the way here.”
But looking at him – just
“Why? Are you still angry?”
“You heard the woman,” said Draco. He looked delighted to have been chosen, or maybe paperchains was more exciting than Harry had anticipated.
“What about?”
“I…” said Harry. “I…”
“I know,” said Oceania, but managed to swallow her grin before turning to Harry. “Harry,” she said. “Are you doing anything this afternoon?”
Malfoy went silent. He straightened up only to stir his straw through the coffee. The ice cubes clanked against the glass.
how much, just how big. It was so deep that sometimes it felt like hurting, so deep that it felt like something inside him that was moving and rolling over in its sleep.
“Well.” says Ron. “She’s a girl, isn’t she?”
Hayden quirked their head. “Okay,” they said. Then after a pause –
The result was that Harry felt both bigger and smaller next to him.
“What did you think?”
In the courtyard, Malfoy was stacking them again. Harry paused at the doorway.
“Okay,” said Harry. “I understand.”
Harry blinked, and then looked around. They were in the men’s changing room, which really just meant that they were in yet another storage room adjacent to the courtyard. Musty sunlight filtered in through what Harry wanted to call windows, but felt that that was a bit generous. It looked like maybe somebody at some point had said, “hey, why don’t we have any damn light in here?” and then proceeded to punch their fist through the wall a couple times.
Harry looked at him now. He was a man – not a spectacle.
The taxi driver made a coughing sound. They both remained oblivious to it.
“You don’t change that much without…sacrifice. And Draco, he’s – well, I think he’s sacrificed quite a lot Harry. To be who he is right now.”
Or perhaps she’d been a perfectly good mother. Perhaps she had held Draco when he cried and made tea for him herself and watched over him with the anxious gaze of maternity. Harry thought about the warmth of her breath on his ear as he’d lied there, still half-dead, on the cold forest floor, and had tried to remember the last time he’d seen Draco alive for her.
Harry leant back and dropped his hand. Dropping the hand made holding it in the first place seem more incriminating. He brushed his fingers over the dusty carpet and looked away.
“Are you mad? She practically took my arm off.”
There was the sound of more unfolding. Harry thought he felt a hand hover over his shoulder, but then it was gone, and maybe he’d just thought it because he wanted it so bad.
“What did you think of Draco dating a monk then?” asked Harry, before he could help himself.
“Didn’t you wonder why there was so much coloured sand?”
Harry racked his brains. “Urm,” he said. “I’ll get cold.”
“Pikachu is kind of cute,” Harry offered.
Harry took a few steps forward. He was an untethered object in space, floating and boundless. Fate-less. Then he sat down on the bed, and he was almost safe again.
Jane was not a particularly big dragon – she only seemed it so often to Harry because she was moody and because he was often deeply and embarrassingly intimidated by her. But she was young, and even for her age, she edged closer towards the petite size. Even so, the distance between the top of a dragon’s back and the ground was not small.
Keep moving.
“Well. I’m sure Tom has other ways of teaching it. You…could ask him about it. And –”
Now Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Your self-obsession remains a wonder to behold. Don’t be late.”
The force of it curved the both of them over, wind in a sail. Malfoy didn’t try to say anything, just held on.
In the end, they didn’t end up going to get coffee. Instead, they went to a pub.
“Like, do you even think before you say stuff like that? Or is it like, let’s just pull out the most random Namaste chakra ass bullshit crap off the top of my head to make Harry feel unenlightened? Like, is that actually it?”
There. That was what Malfoy did. Harry watched his fingers rub that bone on his wrist, like they were polishing a pearl, and closed his eyes. It was cresting in him again.
Last night the world had stopped.
“Ah,” said Hermione faintly.
“I know that Gryffindors think they have a monopoly on love,” said Malfoy precisely, “But the rest of us do occasionally experience a faint echo of it, if we’re lucky.”
“That was a good one,” Harry agreed. “If you ever visit Japan, you could work in one of those little cafés.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Asshole.”
“Harry,” he says, his voice aghast. “They’ll have seen it at security.”
but rather the walls and dust and ground and he felt aware that it had been built by people and that Tom came here every day and that Malfoy had met Tom before. He was awake.
“Osh,” he said. She blinked and looked over at him.
Yoga class was at the top of the mountain. Yoga class was also, to Harry’s horror, less of a class and more of just Draco Malfoy and the girl with black hair he’d been sitting next to earlier contorting on mats in ways that Harry didn’t necessarily think their bodies should be contorting.
Oceania straightened up then and leaned over far enough to smack Malfoy on the arm and snag the bottle in one. “I said to leave him
It was still dark inside his mind. He focused on his breathes, on the feeling of life hidden within the cavity of him, and quietly pulsating through his flesh and tissue. He felt so human sometimes when he did this. It grounded him, more than anything else.
He looked up, slowing his hand to get Draco to stop and look down at him. His mouth was open, gasping, beautiful.
“What do you mean, I like to perform? How do you know what I like? You don’t. How would you?”
“Thanks,” said Harry. He rubbed at his upper lip and got himself a glass of water.
“Oceania,” he said, while they were sitting in the cafeteria. “Has he always worked there?”
“Isn’t this a party?” said Draco.
Harry kept frowning. Then it dawned. “
He sat down. The world was waking up, the sun rolling over the mountains like a newly-woken lover. From up here, the world looked so big. Was he really going to leave again? Where would he go? What would he do?
Harry stood as well. “Malfoy.”
“I tried too, but I couldn’t.”
“I won’t tell Torris,” she said. “But only if I get to meet him.”
“Do you want to dance?”
“Well,” said Tom. “He was when I met him. But that was two years ago. Perhaps he’s changed.”
The memory of Malfoy whispering “sweet nothings” into her ear whilst driving into her repeatedly on the kitchen table flashes across her mind.
“No but seriously.” Harry found himself laughing along with him. “You’re – you’re so much. I’ve never met anyone like you. You’ve remade it all for me.”
Malfoy opened his eyes. They were red at the corners, silver stark against the wide white. He looked so – god help him – vulnerable.
“Sure.” Harry was always down for a coffee break. “How is your heart still beating?”
And then something began to change. He became aware of it all of a sudden. Something rich and tender and deep and impossibly
.” Draco flopped onto his back and made a big show of sighing. Harry smiled again.
“I do like dragons,” agreed Harry, reaching up to nip once at Draco’s jaw. Draco rolled his eyes again, probably to distract from his rapidly pinking cheeks.
“Then how is it?”
“Every Thursday night,” drawled Malfoy, “We go and get completely pissed in the scraggly undergrowth.”
"I'm the alarm," said his husband with a fond look. "And this is me, waking you up."
"I love you too, but you don't have to say that just because I'm a little upset." He looks away again.
to be excited
"Yeah, I apologized and everything."
Draco already told some people at work about he and Potter's marriage. Of course he has, but they either don't believe him or aren't bothered either way by his relationship status and now that Travis knows, its stressful to say the least. The junior curse breakers who've heard it from Travis in the last hour or so, seem less relaxed around Draco now, as if he's going to run to Harry with everything and he let's out a groan.
He slipped out of Harry and cast a cleansing charm on himself before tucking his softening prick back into his trousers and zipping them up.
"Nothing's wrong, you insufferable- look, I'm just tired, but I have some papers to get through and this way we can head home early."
"I don't get it!" Draco finally snapped, staring daggers into the side of Harry's messy head of long salt-and-pepper hair. "You could have anyone you wanted, but you're still shacking up with me."
"Hare, look at me."
"You slept through lunch, you bloody wanker. But I guess we can grab a sandwich from the canteen."
"Draco!" gasped the ravenette stunned and the blonde merely raised his eyes to meet his before opening his mouth and wrapping his lips around the tip. Harry's breath was more of a wheeze that time.
Draco doesn't find out how the news breaks until Harry comes in for their usual lunch session with a paper in his hand and self-deprecating smile on his face. He slides the newspaper over with a shake of his head and a hand through his hair.
"I'm sure she'll survive just fine," Draco responds, pointing a finger to where she's dancing very intimately on Justin Finch-Fletchly.
look in his master's eye. The one that screamed
"Actually, Travis," he said as if he had gotten a brilliant idea, "Join Potter and I for lunch, will you. There's a few things we should discuss."
"Don't misunderstand me, you are not quiet about how much you love me by any means. You're extremely vocal and when we're out in public you respect my boundaries, it's just- well the honeymoon phase is over, you know? And we're so comfortable with each other now that sometimes I think you forget that I like being-" he looks away then, too nervous to continue.
"So, we're telling people now?" he asked with a tired sort of look that told them he already expected disagreement.
Coming down the corridor are staggering footsteps but he already has his wand in his hand and aimed at the sound. They didn't survive Voldemort and fiendfyre and an entire fucking
"H-her name?" Harry's head snapped back to Ron.
"We've told people before..." he responded pouting.
"Really?"
to." As he spoke he turned away from the blonde and divested himself of everything but his briefs. "Oh, gods, I want to. Do you know how beautiful you are, of course I want to. I just don't think you'd want to...no one else I've been with-"
Harry just smiles before leaning forward and pulling the floating chair Draco is sitting in closer. He kisses him soundly, his beard rubbing at the soft skin on Draco's face. When he pulls away his face is indeed red in patches, he can't be sure how much of it is blush and how much comes from him, but he thinks it's gorgeous. He cards a hand through the blond hair as they both try to catch their breath.
"We're not having this conversation again, Potter." Draco stood and kissed Harry on the cheek before starting to walk away. "I'm glad you aren't dead."
"When we're together, you won't have to work a day in your life if you don't want to."
He wonders if Harry will cry like he did the first time. He wonders if Mother will, though he doubts it. His father was the more vocal of the two.
"One must not tell lies, Ackers," he barks at him out of instinct, his voice quieting to a threatening whisper. "I said,
He pulls his hand from Draco's grip and continues his walk into the restaurant with a false smile tacked onto his face when he recalls the reservation name. The hostess nods and leads them to a table in the corner where the chandelier lights don't quite hit and instead they're replaced with soft candlelight. They sit down and Harry is staring at the table and he shocks Draco when he realizes that he and Harry have been married for years and he hadn't noticed that he was going through the same type of mental torment he was going through himself.
As Draco's tongue lolled around sloppily to account for the sheer size of the prick in his mouth, he used his hand to stroke the exposed part of his boyfriend's shaft that couldn't be reached just by bobbing his head.
"She knew something was up with us. You visit the CB floor too often, I'm afraid."
Harry felt the bonds release and the dildo slipped from his hole easily. He flopped onto the seat and groaned as the fabric rubbed against his sensitive prick.
"I'm always thinking," he deflected."Some of our brains don't just shut down from lack of use."
"Auror Potter," Travis Ackers says with a professional smile.
aging with the same grace as you."
"You're not even half as sweet, Malfoy, and you know it."

He sucks in a breath when Harry places a hand on his in comfort.
"No, it's
"I want you to tell the
"Just move your hand, Travis. Before he actually removes it from your body," says Draco but his eyes are still on Harry. "Merlin, must you be so dramatic, Potter?"
"She was uh visiting family in the neighborhood. Met her when Dudley was messing 'round with a couple of his friends at the park."
"You're so handsome when you're focused like that. You'd make such a gorgeous—"
"Oh?" asked Malfoy, both unsurprised and unimpressed. "And how is that working for Weasley?"
"But Draco-" says Travis still trying to save face.
"Well he has eyes, hasn't he?" Harry says still angry and drags the tired and bobbing blond out of the bar towards an apparation point so that they can go home.
"Poor little Potter, cursed with a beautifully huge cock. How wretched." Draco slowly reached his hand up and gripped Harry's thick length and at the man's hiss he wasted no time before he leaned forward and placed a kiss to the tip of his boyfriend's dick.
Harry doesn't think he's heard him except he scrunches his nose up and turns to him.
"You have me as long as you want me, love," Harry says, sitting on the corner of his desk and nudging Draco's knee with the tip of his shoe. "Glued to you like a sticking charm. Scout's honor."
"I will say, I hadn't expected to be working on my wedding day."
"Congratulations," Amin says before turning empty handed to run off and do whatever his next errand is. Harry is so excited that he's finally told someone that he doesn't actually get any work done before lunch. He wonders if Draco has.
"Good luck with that one then."
"We could have just gone to the pub for lunch." Draco's voice is soft and uncomfortable as he looks around for signs of anyone watching them. He missed being the center of attention, but it was giving him post-war flashbacks. Thoughts of being chased down and stoned and hexed and cursed and not having Harry there to help.
"Hi, Draco," said the younger curse breaker. "I tried to keep him out."
"I'm not dressing up as a girl. This is your lie, Potter. I like you, but I'm not desperate."
Harry learned that lesson slowly. As a matter of a fact, Harry was still learning this lesson. The whip cracked across the back of his bare thighs. He yelled as the pain shot through him and directly towards his cock. He was lain naked onto a curved seat. His arms were chained to each side of him on the floor and the collar scraped at his neck as he screamed himself hoarse.
"Mostly, sir. They're reports that need to be approved by the head of the Auror team that went on the last few big missions and that was you, sir."
"I've been watching you and Weasley pouting all night. Meanwhile, I was still over there waiting for you to sweep me off my feet," Draco said gracefully dropping into the seat next to Harry, all long limbs and elegant angles.
"What did Curse Breaker Brittwood say when you met with her?"
. For Merlin's sake, Malfoy, stop leaving me in the dark!" Harry snatched away before storming out of his husband's office. From down the hall he yelled back an angry: "Have lunch without me."
"So what have I missed," asked the newcomer, placing a hand on Draco's. It wasn't long before a wandless stinging hex was sent his way. He snatched his hand away and Draco only smiled small and shrugged at him. Luckily that was enough and he chuckled before striking up a conversation about work.
"I honestly doubt that."
"Nice isn't the first word I would use to describe, Draco, but alright," says Harry, placating.
Harry's still laughing when they walk through the doors.
"You told me to leave you alone so I did."
Draco notices it in the way other people in the ministry are looking at him with narrowed eyes as he walks into work the next morning. His ring isn't glamoured today, hasn't been since he and Harry promised to tell everyone, but now he sees the witches and wizards who are openly ogling it. He wants to wave it around in their faces. Shove their love in these bystanders faces. Instead Draco smirks in a way he knows used to drive Harry absolutely barmy when they first got together and he wanted to act like he knew more than he actually did.
"Really!" Draco insisted. "She knew we were married. Or suspected it, at least. She said it's fine, though. I haven't lost my job quite yet."
! Well then...proceed," he said with a flippant hand motion as he conjured a small chaise and leisurely sat on it as if this was his plan all along. Harry smirked at a battle won, but looked a bit more nervous at the prospect of actually being watched. "Harry, you know you don't have to if you don't want to. I'm not going to- I don't want you to feel like-"
He knows Harry will say he looked good either way, but he would rather not have his wedding portrait look like he's utterly sad and unkempt especially when he looks at Harry and feels the complete opposite.
"You're telling people now, aren't you?" she said somewhat excited with a sort of proud gleam in her eyes and he shoved at her shoulder.
"I'm a terrible dancer and you know it. Go back to your date, people are going to notice you talking to me, remember? What happened to not being seen? Keeping a low profile?"
"You know, you could even renew your vows. It'd be so nice to have everyone there this time. Draco could have the full show he wanted last time."
"What, being fawned all over?" asks Harry. Draco blushes and Harry smiles softly at him. "You can just tell me if you want something like that. I have no problem fawning all over you. You're beautiful and funny and smarter than almost anyone I've ever met."
"I know building a name for yourself is something you have to do on your own and I know you love this job. I wouldn't muck that up for you. I just..." He looked up from Draco's into his eyes and kissed his knuckles again, enjoying the feel of the cool metal wedding band touching his lips. "I just want to know what's going on in that gorgeous mind of yours, alright?"
He watches as Harry speaks pleasantly to his mother as the pale white peacocks flock around him as a thanks for saving them from reporters probably, and he can't help but be so happy that he gets to marry him again. In front of everyone.
temple.
"Even the head Curse Breakers have been trying to recruit him."
"Yeah, actually," Harry said, looking down at the table and away from Ginny.
"The show he deserves," Harry said more to himself and finally agreed with his friend. "Hey, 'Mione, could you, maybe..."
"Y-Yes, Master Malfoy."
"Hey, Ron?" Harry asks, looking over at his best friend who is still scowling at Hermione happily dancing with Krum even as he answers.
"Malfoy!" shouts a panicked voice. "Draco where the hell are— "
"I was dating Malfoy. Ya know, before? That's who I was going to bring to the ball."
is, Potter? Is that it?"
"Excuse me?" the brunette stuttered out confused and Blaise heaved a sigh. As the only unspeakable in the group, he was the only one able to fix things if Draco fucked up too badly. badmouthing a coworker could get him fired almost indefinitely.
"Y-Yes, Master Draco."
"Oi, Harry, we have a case toda-" Ron froze when he finally looked up at his best friend with a blond lounging in his lap. "Malfoy."
"When we're— Oh bloody hell," Draco says once he notices the glowing blue sheen of Travis' eyes. Who knows what artifact he'd gotten in touch with down in the Curse Breakers den. Draco tosses all the vital reading spells he knows to try and understand what the fuck is going on. The best he can gather is an infatuation curse from a temple of cupid, but even then he can't break the curse without knowing
. He wore his ring (without a glamour), his hair had been tamed somewhat over the last few years and his uniform was always pressed and sealed properly. It was clear someone at home loved him. He just could never tell them who before, but that didn't mean they stopped asking or trying to set him up. "But only if they ask about it. We're all adults here. I don't care what they think either way, really, but if they ask, then..." he shrugged.
'. So come on then, what do you have to say?"
"Uh...Auror Potter," Travis said, because he still won't just call him Harry though he loved to say Draco's name as though it were so precious. Harry's anger almost inflated again. "You and Draco are close, aren't you?"
As if in a trance, Travis moved out of the seat with glazed eyes and stood before saying goodbye to the group and leaving. When Blaise turned his eyes to the blond he stood and rolled his eyes.
"Just thinking you should get away from the Wizarding world for a while. You seem stressed and I know exactly where I want to take you."
"I want you to dance with me."
He looked past his boyfriend and didn't even notice that the darker boy threw him a nervous yet ecstatic grin as they walked a bit further through the grounds, past trees and bushes until they finally pushed themselves into a clearing on one of the highest hills on the property, overlooking the rest of the forest and the rest of the garden.
"You do?"
"Missed me, did you?" Draco asks a small but happy smirk on his face as he saunters over to his husband. His life may not have been on the line right that second, but Draco can still see Harry lying lifeless in his arms. Lifeless in Hagrid's arms. Can imagine his mother standing over Harry lying lifeless in the forest. He places a hand on his husband's cheek and looks from one eye to the other. "You're okay, aren't you?"
"He isn't going anywhere with you," Travis said placing a hand on Draco's shoulder. "You're probably drunk. I'll take him home when he's ready to leave."
them loudly. He grinned at her apologetically but she simply rolled her eyes as she walked away. "Besides he barely knows you, you're both just too stubborn for your own good."
to say is," he murmurs before he loses the nerve, "I'm ready now. The picture isn't too bad and I don't think anyone will be too surprised with how much time we spend together anyway. I'm not glad we didn't get to share the story ourselves, but I am glad it's finally out. I couldn't keep you to myself forever."
"I panicked and told the whole school I was bringing some girl from the states. So he brought Pansy Parkinson."
"Draco!" he says tragically, stumbling again and falling. It looks too well planned. Too precise. Too dramatic. And Draco would know. He doesn't move away from where he has Harry cradled in his lap and his wand is still pointed dangerously at a now coughing Travis.
"FIVE!" he shouted as his painfully erect penis brushed against the leather fabric he was reclined on.
Draco stepped forward and placed the tip of his wand on Harry's chest before releasing a stinging hex. He tried to twist away without any success as the wand tip was placed lower and lower until it rested on the top of his thigh. He shivered at the closeness of the hex next to his more...important bits.
"I'm not angry with you."
"It's not too bad, Auror Potter, sir," he says before lowering his voice to a conspiratorial whisper, "I get to hear all the ministry gossip."
"Well, you see, I uh- I already have a date," she says nervously and from across the room they hear Ron choke as he's playing chess with Neville before he comes over with crossed arms. Harry wishes he wasn't around for the ensuing argument.
"I should remind myself to resign from being head of the junior department if

Something is different.

The light from the moon had fell on each of them in a way that made the entire situation seem a little less real. As Harry pulled Draco in for a kiss, the blonde looked almost ethereal in the way his alabaster skin glistened under the stars. Harry's scar was bigger this close, and the light had made it look even more faded than normal. It was pale in comparison to the rest of his warm skin.
things was easier too.
"You're such a sap," Draco says, but he's smiling with flaming cheeks and Harry thinks he's done his part. He kisses his husband's knuckles softly, running a thumb over their wedding bands as a server comes to take their orders.
"Are you sure you don't use any product," says a giggling voice that Harry deemed absolutely annoying at this point. "It's so beautiful! And soft!"
"Yeah, of course!" the brunette said with forced enthusiasm. Draco could tell he was disappointed and he wondered if he and Harry had been as obvious about liking each other before their first shag, but he doubted it. Their relationship had started in secret with passionate yelling and rough sex and he was almost positive there were parts of them that still hated each other back then. There was no room for the soft smiles and giggling until they were forced on a mission together and had to talk things through. Things were easier after that.
Harry pushed himself out of the car, slamming the door behind him and walking towards the front door with an angry Malfoy behind him. The blonde grabbed his arm before he was able to tell the hostess about their reservation.
"Why haven't we heard of your girlfriend before," asked Ron that night before bed.
"Is that what you were doing," asked Harry before leaning over and whispering to Draco: "It was a piss poor job then, wa'nnit?"
He and Harry had talked about doing more, sure, but Harry usually averted his eyes and responded with something non-committal. He had told Draco before that he bottomed with most of his other male partners, and his female partners never made it all the way to having sex with him.  Draco nodded and asked if that's what he liked but Harry just stuttered out a neutral response before excusing himself to their shared bathroom. Draco never got the chance to tell him how much he longed to be pounded into. How he wanted to be bent over and forced to just
An hour or so later when Draco was properly sloshed, Harry raised from his seat to take him home.
Harry fell asleep thinking about purposely misaimed curses and other ways to disobey his master.
When he makes it back to the main area of the back garden, Harry is nowhere to be found which means Hermione has finally forced him to get dressed.
"You're angry with me," he says again, but this time it isn't a question.
He doesn't.
"Experience, mostly," says Harry flippantly and Draco snorts.
"No."
was gonna pay for lunch, the bloody prat," mumbled the blonde. He growled low in his throat then turned to Travis with an appraising glare.
"Mostly?"
Harry had relaxed a little after that and was taking a sip of his beer when he noticed Travis reaching a hand over under the table, probably to lay on his husband's thigh and he growled.
--:--
"Reservation for Potter," he says with a smile on his face, grabbing Draco's hand as the hostess walks them to a table.
"Actually," says Travis, "Draco told me he didn't like tea. But isn't it just so nice of him to accept it anyway?"
"I did not sleep through lunch!" Draco said sitting up indignantly. "I have an alarm that wakes me up for lunch."
"Master Malfoy is my father, and you know it." He smacked Harry's ass with the crop once more.
"I assure you, I have nothing to do with this." Though Draco is grinning as he responds, "You will find I'm a very likable person, of my own accord."
"So we

, how he wanted to, but Harry hadn't given in. Not once. They had been together for exactly a year now. Something about the look in the messy-haired man's eyes told Draco tonight would be different.
"I make you feel neglected?" Harry asks softly, his head down-turned and his eyes sad when they look up at Draco.
Draco pushed himself somewhat excitedly from Harry's lap. He turned to run from the room and his husband grabbed his wrist.
"Well obviously," he said as Harry walked towards the door where Travis had knocked again, "they all have a talent for planning things."
"My girl-? Oh.
"I didn't mean break up with me. I thought you were just going to try harder."
Travis doesn't quite give up the charade, but his look becomes more searching as if he's expecting something to happen.
It's Wednesday morning, but Harry and Draco are still on thin ice. They had a fantastic shag over the weekend, but even that couldn't fix the real issue.
"Well, this is just great. Everyone thinks my boyfriend's a girl," says Harry plopping onto one of the armchairs they found in one of the more deserted areas in the library
They stop talking at home and that Thursday at pub night even Ron can feel the tension between them. Neville is between them in the booth acting as a buffer and just when Draco is three drinks in and Harry is about to apologize, in walks Travis wearing a tight green v-neck with a pair of jeans slung low on his hips. He is the youngest out of all of them and as he slides into the end of the booth next to Draco the group seems to collectively freeze.
"I didn't know they'd be there. I know you didn't want everyone to know so quickly and-" Harry thought he might be sick but he choked back the thought. He was s grown man now, he wasn't going to toss his guts just because some nosy wizards couldn't leave well enough alone. He sucked in a breath when Draco looked at him lovingly.
The next morning Harry Potter is walking towards his office as one of the head Aurors at the ministry when he notices the back of Draco Malfoy, leaning beside his door frame. He smiles, because Draco has to come to work hours before him, but still has time to stop by. He sticks a hand into his bag and pulls out a thermos of tea just the way Draco likes it, but as he gets closer he notices the blond isn't alone.
"Will it, now?" Harry said, sitting up with a smirk, and Draco pulled him into a kiss.
"Well of course she hasn't-" Harry pauses. "Does she know you're gay?"
"You blew out the lights down in the archives and set off five Unspeakable power scale alarms. Blaise called," Draco explains amused. "He noticed your magical signature. Oh, you also set a fire down in Brittwood's office. That one, I saw for myself."
The music is soft as it flows from the rafters over the congregation of party goers. The charmed lights and silver snitches flicker and flutter in the air surrounding the tents, ready to glow at a moments notice once the sun begins to set later. Draco's robes are perfectly pressed and gleaming, even though both he and Harry have only opted for a soft cream color as opposed to the typical pearlescent white of weddings and funerals. He plucks a nonexistent piece of lint from his shoulder before continuing through the manor's gardens to find anyone else.
"I'm actually enjoying this. You look hot when you're all angry like that," Draco says.
"I know you love me, darling," says Harry still not looking Draco in the face. The blond grabs his face with a huff of a laugh, turning it so that they're staring into each other's eyes and he blushes before ultimately even he has to look away from the intensity in those green eyes.
"Sounds an awful lot like a date."
"We really do study!" Harry says, feeling his cheeks heat up. "He's trying to beat Hermione for best student, he's like a niffler in a bank vault."
"Are you alright?" Draco asks softly, his face is blushed from dancing, but he isn't out of breath although his braid has come slightly undone, strands of hair now on his shoulder instead of being pinned back.
Harry did as he was told and wrapped his mouth around the cock that began to magically fucking his throat as Draxo continued to fuck his ass raw. Every time he plunged into him he felt his own toes curl at how great the man strung up before him felt as he slid on and off his cock.
"You know that's not what I meant."
They had thought that after confirming their marriage, the scrutiny and spying and watching would be over, but now everyone was waiting for the big event. They were keeping a close eye on both men in case one of them slipped up about their super secret plans to renew their vows with a huge wedding. Truth be told, neither of them were even a part of the planning process and Luna, Hermione and Pansy were still in the color picking phase. That doesn't stop everyone from staring, though, especially after Harry's explosion in the hallway. Once they remember that, they make it to the lifts in record time.
"I said it because I don't say it enough and I've been acting like a right prat. You set up this entire dinner to make me feel better and I didn't even notice you were feeling just as neglected as I was."
When Ron finally went to sleep, Harry let out a breath he felt he had been holding all evening.
"I think I'm ready to fuck you now, Potter." He smirked before angle his wand at Harry again. "
Without another word Harry vanished his briefs, but kept his hands over himself for cover.
"Yes, I
"Oh, I'm sure she'll
"Draco, it's not a big deal. I clearly haven't been making you feel very wanted either."
"Oh bugger off."
"Draco told Brittwood."
When he finally gets him undressed and in the bed he stomps out to plop onto the couch because he knows he can't tell Travis they're married because then Draco's job could be on the line if everyone found out. He had applied as a single wizard, he was able to rise through the ranks easier thay way. Wizards with family ties got more stable desk jobs, that's not what he had wanted. Even more than that, if people found out from anyone else, his pride would be on the line. He liked going to work in a place that he had worked so hard to get into without having everyone know he was married to the saviour. Harry couldn't take that from him. He
"I just condition it well. No secrets there," Draco Malfoy said in his usual drawl, but Harry knew he was relishing the attention and couldn't help grinding his teeth. Of course Draco enjoyed being complimented by younger guys it proved he was still fresh and gorgeous and marketable and he always thought Harry was being too kind. They were both in their thirties and Harry knew they were both too tired nowadays for a proper shag and that was probably why he was so on edge, but he was still gripping his mug so tightly that he was getting a cramp in his hand. His eyes were staring unfocused at the wooden table in the pub that he and his friends met at every week. There was a notch just below his glass where Ginny had almost stabbed Ron over a bet.
It was barely a week left until the Yule Ball now, and Hermione had been tearing her hair out helping with preparations and trying to keep everyone relaxed. Harry had promised to help run interference and keep her relaxed. He is supposed to be checking on her but she's so stressed, her magic is buzzing around the common room and he has no idea how to stop it so he changes the subject. Asks if she has a date to the ball. Says if she doesn't, Ron is free too and they could all go as friends. She freezes and blushes. The magic in the air is calm.
The day after, Potter has a handful of forget-me-nots in her hand. “Potter?” says Draco, frowning when she opens the door.
He still couldn’t get over how pink the set of Draco’s mouth was. He was stuck staring at him, at the flush in his face, at the delicate set of his bones. It was a strange thing, but once again Harry remembered, like a distant memory, that Draco Malfoy was not naturally a handsome man. His cheekbones were too high, his nose too long, his brows too light. Harry was stuck staring at him, and he suddenly felt like he might never find anyone else beautiful after this again.
“Yeah,” said Harry, plucking at a blade of grass. “Thanks for that. I did notice.”
“What do you mean?” he said, very politely.
“Oh,” he said. “Hello.”
Draco reaches up and traces her lip, not quite meeting her eye.
He got up and cleaned his teeth thoroughly. Then he washed his face. It felt good, so he decided to have a shower. It was so much better showering in your own bathroom. He let the water drip over his face, felt it rake down through his black hair. As he scrubbed his skin, it occurred to him that perhaps it was a deeper brown than before.
Coincidentally – or not – it is also around this time that Harry sees Draco Malfoy again for the first time since the trials. She has apparently kept herself busy – developing a line of respected potions, weeding her way back into society despite obvious resistance – rolling naked in money, presumably, with several men eating gold-dusted truffles off her body. Harry hasn’t seen her for a while. And hasn’t thought too much of her, either. Harry’s life doesn’t have room for gold-dusted truffles – or naked bodies.
His eyes were burning a hole into Draco’s skull right now. Draco privately reinforced his legilimency walls, not that there was much point now, he supposed.
Was that hot? Let me know if you thought it was hot.
“Have you owled them yet?” asked Charlie.
Perhaps it had made him more sensitive. All the colours, noises, smells entangled him completely. He was staring at people, he knew he was. It was strange, because he had never thought of himself as a particularly sensitive person. He didn’t know if it was because of the blue, or the silence, but it was like his eyes couldn’t adjust to the brightness of everyone.
Harry straightened his back, and then added, without looking at her or anything really: “At least, I don’t think so.”
“It’s what Oceania calls it, and it’s kind of stuck, honestly,” said the person, shuffling three round bread-like balls into Harry’s bowl. “You’re new, aren’t you?”
At which point, Zambini had said, “Lovely, bring her along.”
“For heaven’s sake. Do
“Yup.” Harry jumped to his feet. “You got water?”
And she remembers suddenly how Blaise had once asked her after he’d walked in on her and Pansy snogging in the library if it was softer with girls, if it was more gentle, and tender, and fragile – and what he didn’t know was that the truth was that it
“God,” says Harry. “Goddammit, you’re so dirty.”
Silly words. Scary. Ill-fitting, and yet somehow undeniably truthful.
Malfoy smiled a little. Harry wished – again – that he was more adept at reading expressions. There was something burning about the feeling in Malfoy’s eyes.
coward.” He definitely looked like the Draco Malfoy from Hogwarts. Harry felt the resentment build in him, poisonous and unkind, uncaring. The resentment wouldn’t care about Draco Malfoy’s flowery leggings, or the clearing they had found together, or how it felt to hear him laugh at Harry’s jokes, or the delicate, never-ending moment where Harry had reached out with his hand in the Fire Techno Dance club, and pressed his palm to Draco Malfoy’s back.
“Hi,” said Harry, and then added awkwardly: “I’m Harry.”
“No, I’m not –” Draco gritted his teeth and looked away. Then he bent down and started rolling again. When he spoke again, he sounded tired. “I’m not angry with you, Harry.”
“Hey,” Malfoy said. Harry looked at him again. “I don’t think you’re incurably bad.”
“And in a way, isn’t everyone mad? At least a little bit? In fact, it’s probably healthy, as long as it’s not too obnoxious.”
He sounded so righteous and confused that it made him sound a little bit like he was twelve. He had been horrible when he was actually twelve, so Harry didn’t know why he was getting the urge to smile in a way that was probably quite similar to the sunflower they had collaborated on on Oceania’s ceiling.
“Be honest with me,” said Harry, “Tell me what you really think.”
“Just…” Harry took a deep breath, made himself meet Malfoy’s gaze. He shrugged. “I…why am I so bad with dragons?”
It rains a lot outside Draco’s window.
“Now,” said Malfoy, “Bend from your hips.”
“Sure,” said Malfoy. He glanced over at Oceania. “Pick me out a number, won’t you Osh?”
“About an hour.” Harry gasped and rinsed out the glass in the sink. “Maybe a bit more.”
But then it hadn’t been enough. Would anyone be? He didn’t know. He had his books, he had his cottage – he had Mayo. It had to be. Van Gogh had said that:
“I’m not gay, Harry.”
“You know full well that I have more feelings than the three of you combined,” Oceania said breezily, pulling a fork out of her hair and handing it to Malfoy, who frowned slightly before wiping it on his shirt.
“Enough said,” said Hayden. They were smirking, just slightly.
The walk down to the cafeteria took so long. He heard every crunch of his boots against the gravel.
“Mm,” she said, “Nothing of substance. Mostly along the lines of “Ungrateful, ridiculous, entitled, self-centered, bad-haired, speccy, stupid,
In the most respectful and spiritually enlightened way possible, Harry thought that the dances were fucking sick.
Harry looked over at her suspiciously. “What is it now?”
you?”
“Not like this,” said Harry. “Not…like this.”
“Sorry,” he said, heart racing, and stepped out of the queue.
Harry snakes a hand down to play with her clit, and Malfoy just about snaps in half. She moans loudly, voice breaking in that perfect way it does whenever she climaxes, and Harry grunts, riding it out.
There were disparate brands of human. He was beginning to understand that he didn’t know them all.
Malfoy nodded. He was still looking down at where Harry was seated. Harry patted the grass beside him.
When he’d finished with that he took two steps forwards and reached over into his forward fold. You were supposed to bend from the hips. He came back up a bit and adjusted slightly, before coming back down. He hadn’t forgotten.
Harry felt golden.
The room hollowed out, like a spoon cleaving out the contents of a fruit in one fellow swoop. Malfoy’s words were that spoon, and the air was that fruit.
“Besides, it’s not like we’re scissoring.” Says Malfoy.
Harry handcuffed him to the table. As he was turning the key, he said, “Aren’t you worried that I’ll just leave you here?”
Draco had read about his childhood in the various biographies that had come out. Everybody knew, by now.
He’d expected to find relief in the unfamiliar. But he only felt numb.
“I’m glad to be here,” she murmured, drooling slightly onto his shirt, “It feels safe.”
Draco looked straight at him. “Because,” he said, “Harry, life is a cruel, cruel mistress.”
“I don’t,” says Harry, automatically.
“Because. This is a sitting up kind of conversation. And I need to drink my soup. So, get up.”
“Urgh.” Oceania dragged a hand down over her face. “God,
He caught Draco's arm and reeled him in to kiss his cheek, because he could and he wanted to. Draco stopped looking at the green and started looking at him. His lips quirked up.
Malfoy stepped forward, unfolding his arms. “It’s…” he said. “You’ve got to bend from the hips. Not the lower back. Otherwise you’ll damage it. ”
“I don’t know if this is gonna fall over.” Oceania took a step back and looked up at the pole. “I think it might.”
Harry leaned back. His face was heating up. He hadn’t planned on the conversation continuing.
Zambini leaned back in his seat. “Mmmmm,” he said.
She laughed, and then there was a sudden movement which nearly killed Harry. “What the fuck are you doing?” he shouted to no one in particular as he stumbled forward.
There was nothing obviously remarkable about the pub. It appeared at first glance to be just like any other stereotypically British pub in Glasgow. But Luna had said that she liked the place, and so here they were.
and hands it to Harry.
Harry looked at Zambini. “You’re a writer?”
Harry lifted his head. “Yes,” he told him. “I’m a very spiritual being.”
And then there was Harry Potter.
“Here we have it!” said Charlie, clapping his hands together, “A real beauty. Eighth mermish, too.”
Harry looked up to Malfoy and straightened back up, the tea cosy clutched in his hand. Oceania said: “It’s rather like Cinderella, isn’t it?”
Malfoy sat straight up. “When?
The next room turned out to be the kitchen. Harry blinked at the long, narrow island, stretched out in front of him like a bar counter. Draco was behind it, busying himself in the cabinets. His arms were reaching up, hands moving along the highest shelf. He was on his tip toes. His socks were green.
“Draco,” said Harry, and his voice was kind. “I’m not dating you because I think you’re a novelty.”
The yoga mat was very successful. Harry was in town looking to buy some props, mostly to give himself something to do, when he glanced up and realised he was opposite Victoria’s Secret. He laughed.
He went through the set of trees. They walked for maybe ten minutes, following no particular path, but not once did Oceania complain or doubt his sense of direction. The tugging only grew stronger. The air began to feel more right.
“Speaking of which!” Malfoy brought his hands and clapped them together. “I think it’s time for our evening adventure!”
“Of course,” said Harry. “It’s where I buy all my clothes.”
Draco unbuttoned his collar button. Harry looked around the table in alarm, and was glad to see that Hermione and Ron (faithful,
“You’re an absolute gem, Harry Potter,” Malfoy was saying, his voice warm and pleasant. He was close, his hands rubbing up and down Harry’s arms, slow. Harry’s gaze caught on the skin where Malfoy’s neck met his jaw, and got stuck.
Harry kept looking at him.
He was close to Malfoy now. Malfoy was open-eyed, and Harry abruptly realised he wasn’t the only one capable of watching anymore. Malfoy inhaled, quiet. He was so rarely quiet. The last time he had been quiet he had – been standing in the loch.
“Ah,” said Harry, nodding. “Dolphin tea cosies are definitely a must-have.”
Oceania tilted her head to the side. Her cheek dimpled.
“Harry.” Malfoy’s sounded more serious now. When he looked over, he saw that he was also looking up. “You know none of that stuff actually matters.”
Malfoy elbowed him sharply in the ribs and he doubled over, snickering. “God,” he gasped, “Your body’s a
“Yeah,” said Draco slowly. “Because the books they’re about are interesting.”
Harry poured Malfoy a glass as well. “I have you.”
Harry looked back at Draco, and then back down to the floor.
“I thought we could do an extra lesson. If you wanted.”
Had he noticed?
“I’m proud of you,” he said at last. “That’s good.”
“That bowl kind of makes me uncomfortable,” said Malfoy, wrinkling his nose. “As a vegetarian, I don’t think I should.”
, read the chapter.
“You garden?” asks Potter as she crouches down, not appearing to notice the way her expensive robes fold into the damp earth. Draco straightens up, sitting back on her heels, cheeks warm.
The world was a whirlwind of colour and movement. Immediately, Harry felt along for the connection, and found it, intact. He fumbled along it and then slipping, easily, into Jane’s mind. She was having fun.
Gao’s eyebrows went up. And then she tilted her head and thought about it.
“Everybody needs somebody,” she told him. “Everybody needs to share.”
“It’s alright,” Malfoy said again – gently, as if it didn’t cost him a thing at all, and moved away from the stove. “Let’s have that firewhiskey now.”
There was a pause.
“I have to,” he said.
“Yes,” said Malfoy. “I do.” His smirk had shucked some of its sharpness. “Please continue.”
“Louis L’amour,” said Zambini.
He was warm, wet, sweet on his mouth. Draco sucked his bottom lip desperately, ran the tip of his tongue just under the top one. Harry’s tongue was in his mouth. He was inside him, inside him. Draco reached one hand up, delicately felt where Harry’s jaw was moving, and Harry pushed his legs open further. Draco almost orgasmed.
Malfoy’s entire face went bright red. Harry watched, fascinated as he tried to pretend it wasn’t happening.
“Hey.” Harry grinned, which seemed to alarm Malfoy even more. “We bumped into each other.”
Harry blinked. “How long have you been here?”
He opened them as he felt Draco exhale in his ear. It was a sweet sound, a shocked inhale of breath, and then they were dipping. Harry was too stunned to make a noise. The wind rushed past them like liquid.
Harry had broken a dragon out of Gringrotts. He had infiltrated the ministry when he was the most wanted man in the wizarding world. He had put a knife through a basilisk.
“You like some crafts,” Malfoy repeated blankly.
“So you think relationships are about paths?”
Pansy waved a dismissive hand. She was digging into her octopus rolls. How her lipstick wasn’t smearing everything Harry would never know.
Malfoy grit his teeth.
“I didn’t really need you for anything,” said Luna dreamily as she poured milk into two cups with tassels on them. “I just thought the gardening would be good for your depression.”
They were at the pub getting lunch. It was only the third time Ron and Hermione had met Oceania, but it was Oceania, so they had warmed up quick.
Harry sat down heavily beside Oceania. She was knitting.
“You’re a bitch ass pussy, Potter,” she said, after another minute.
Five steps.
“Do you paint?”
Which was how he found himself in Gao’s office two weeks later.
They continued. The path curved and dipped down, gradually descending beneath the tree line. The view disappeared, but they were inside it – everything was green. It was almost too beautiful to be real, Harry thought. This whole village; it was too much for him.
Draco looked a little abashed when he turned back to Harry, which was a curious expression on him. He glanced around him, like he was suddenly considering his living space with new eyes. There was room to sit on the sofa now, but neither of them did.
Luna was rising from the table. Blaise stood as well, reaching out for her, and then they were saying their goodbyes and it was just him and Pansy, across the table from him, somehow still frowning.
Draco straightened up, getting to his feet and brushing his hands off. For some reason he was wearing denim coveralls and nothing else. Even the unshelled white of his feet was stained green.
“I’m sorry I don’t have a bloody leg kink!” Malfoy cried out, waving one hand expressively in the air. “God forbid I enjoy other body parts.”
“You think I’m crazy,” Harry said.
When he came, he always thought of this, over and over again: how it was Harry that was touching him, and how intimate it was. All he had ever wanted was to be close.
She sits up and steps out of bed. She puts on muggle clothes. She boils her tea water in a pot, because the kettle has been broken for the past year.
Malfoy nodded. He was looking at the mountains again, but was more subdued.
