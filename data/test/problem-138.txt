Playing chess with Ron over winter holidays, sneaking into the library with the invisibility cloak, seeing the Mirror of Erised.
"Ah ah ah! I said they'd be dating by the end of last year and technically they were. Which means you owe me 20 sickles," Ginny said with a smirk.
If I Stop Reacting Will Harry Stop Making Flustering Sexual Remarks, the third in the biographical series.
There’s an awkward pause where Draco realizes he’s only in his underwear and Harry’s about the same.
Draco opens his mouth to respond, but his coworker fusses at him to keep the line moving, and they have to part ways.
When Harry blushes for the umpteenth time that morning, Draco winks and returns to his measurements.
“I remember her laughing so hard and telling me to stay put so she could get the camera, and she took a picture of me told me she thought I looked wonderful.”
They eat the rest of their meal in silence, and soon the students are guided out of the Great Hall by their prefects, leaving the staff alone.
When Harry pushes open the door to the craft shoppe, he prays that anyone other than Malfoy is working the register.
Casting a quick silencing charm on himself, he carefully sneaks up behind Harry and grabs his towel, clothes, and shoes, leaving behind only his socks.
"Dearest Narcissa, I don't know!  Maybe we should run away and elope!" Potter replied in the same tone.
When I accidentally grabbed his hand to apparate... it was like a habit.  My body just did.  I didn't even think about it until he squeezed my hand slightly and I looked up and saw his surprised expression.  I tried to let go, I really did, but my brain didn't let me.  So we held hands.  And I loved it.
His therapist recommended picking up a repetitive hobby to help with the anxiety and violent shaking, and it worked.
He cried a little bit, though he’d never admit it, and he prided himself on the emerald-colored studs that he wore for three months afterward.
Draco smiles, recounting his mother holding his hands while he squeezed his eyes shut and let the beautician pierce his ears.
It’s not until Draco’s owl flies in with a letter that they realize how much time has really passed.
I immediately responded that of course I would be there. Suddenly, I noticed her name change and made a mental note to ask her about it tomorrow over tea.
He places feather-light kissing upon Draco’s cheek and jaw, slowly moving down to his neck and collarbone.
What did you do to my already impossible hair to make it more impossible?” He says, regaining control of his facial features.
"I feel much better now, too.  Good day to you.  And, for the record, I do believe you're trying to change." Harry said kindly.
It’s a very complicated bit of charm work that needs to be done, and he even reached out to Professor Flitwick for assistance, despite the concerned looks he received because of it.
"Yes, but he's out so I'm afraid that you won't get to see him today. Not that either of you would mind," she said with a chuckle.
“Wonderful!  I’ll let Mr. Longbottom know that you’re ready to see your apartments.”  McGonagall waves her wand gracefully and the foggy white form of three cats – a kitten, an adolescent, and an adult – appear in the air, prancing around Harry for a moment before floating off.
The minutes pass agonizingly slowly, with Harry and Draco eating beside each other, both thinking things but not having the courage to say them out loud.
He convinces himself its because he needs more yarn, but anyone with two eyes can tell he’s looking for Draco.
We got to the top of the stairs and I immediately went to my room, glad to be rid of Harry. Apparently he didn't want to be around me either, as he turned and walked down to the guest room.
As she spoke, he could see Jerard standing down the hall, within earshot. He took a moment to vanish the wetness from his hair and clothes and transformed a towel she gave him, into a jacket to bring his body temperature back to normal. He followed her when she beckoned, arriving in her kitchen. It was Jerard who asked if he preferred tea or coffee. “I can tell from your accent, you may not be a coffee drinker,” he added with a friendlier change in attitude.
Ron was the first to spill it. “That’s him? That’s Severus Snape, the bloke you guys bragged about beating up and teaching lessons to all these years? You made him sound like a squib.”
,” Malfoy says, impatiently. “You didn’t think the Ministry was going to let powerful, wealthy families escape Azkaban and
Harry doesn’t give it a chance to cool before he downs it as if it really were Firewhisky. It’s slightly too hot and he winces as it burns his insides. “How do I look?” he asks, after he recovers from the mild heartburn.
“Only because I was insanely jealous of your special treatment,” Draco said, glaring. “Don’t get any ideas.”
Now Draco sat on his bed, shirtless again and as beautiful as he had ever been, but looking uncertain as he picked at the sheets between his fingers.
Without looking behind him, he flicks the dishes neatly toward the sink behind him. "Watch it, Boss," Levi laughs, ducking beneath the flying side plates. The young cook swiftly moves to the other side of the metallic work bench, grabbing two tubs of ingredients from the fridge behind him.
At some point someone decides to save all of their eardrums and turns it down but not before Mrs Hodgkins who lives upstairs from the Apothecary decides to complain and turns up on their doorstep. Someone pulls her in and shoves a half-warm espresso martini in her hand and forty minutes later Harry sees her chatting animatedly to a pot plant.
He pauses, appraising his former classmate. There really isn't much thats changed about Malfoy at all. Perhaps his hairline has receded a minuscule amount, and his hands appear slightly thinner, but aside from that he's still slim, tall and angular.
Just as he is about to drift off into despondency over the dire state of his social life, fate deals him another blow.
He rolls his eyes but tells Levi he'll cover the front in her absence. Less than ten minutes later she's back with him, smelling strongly of chewing gum and some kind of perfume charm.
Draco’s reply was predictably sardonic. “If I ever need to read the manual on rash decision making and favouritism, I’ll be sure to think of it.”
"Right," Harry agrees, hoping to Merlin that things don't get to the level of desperation where he has to squeeze himself and his reports into Ron's office to engage in an all-nighter of report reviewing. He and Ron have only been out of the Auror academy for three years, but unlike the field work where their war experience helped them outstrip their peers, their attention to administration continues to leave something to be desired.
Potter nodded and stared at his glass for a moment longer. Then he rounded on Draco Malfoy, glassy, green eyes piercing under the mop of perpetually messy hair. Draco’s stomach lurched. He wondered whether he really was allergic to caviar.
“Honestly, I don’t understand how someone so intelligent can’t grasp the simple concept of cousins,” Draco replied in an exasperated tone.
justified in his reactions considering the situation at hand. At the time, he had been in the thick of organising a handful of unruly undercover Aurors to simultaneously build a case against a group of international Felix Felicis smugglers and the Welsh national quidditch team. The case, which had been two years in the making, was coming to a head with the 2006 Quidditch World Cup on the near horizon. Harry had already been managing the relationship with the International Quidditch Federation and its long list of stakeholders. The last thing Harry wanted was to suddenly be responsible for managing a leak to the Daily Prophet.
“What on earth is a lemon, lime and bitters?” Harry asks Hermione when he gets back from the bar, juggling two pints and a strange, cordial-like drink.
Harry quirked an eyebrow, moving backwards to sit on the couch opposite the tapestry. He motioned for Draco to sit beside him. “Try me.”
"Oh," Malfoy says, and Harry thinks he can detect a hint of disappointment in his voice. "Because the milk is lukewarm."
Harry’s chest constricted slightly and he felt the warm rush of desire invigorate his limbs. He still wasn’t completely used to the unsettling mixture of anxiety and a burning hunger to push Draco (or Malfoy, whichever Harry felt like) up against his office bookcase and do things to him that definitely weren’t within the Ministry’s code of ethics for appropriate workplace conduct.
The Department Head was initially stunned at his suggestion. Harry conceded that requesting high level security clearance for a former Death Eater was pushing it, even for him. But then again, the benefit of being the Chosen One was that his judgment was rarely ever seriously questioned. After that, all he had to do was convince Malfoy that working for the Ministry was a more prestigious career than consistently trying to undermine it.
“I don’t know, I haven’t had a chance to speak to him about it,” Harry said crossly, shrugging away from her touch.
“It’s rude to keep me waiting, Potter,” Draco replied in the entitled way that Harry was so used to. Harry didn’t care in the slightest. His skin felt like it had developed its own electric current and quivered under every point of contact between them. His hand, almost of its own accord, reached up to thread itself through the pale blond strands of Draco’s hair.
“Interestingly, The Quibbler is reporting that Lucius died of a particularly vicious Nargle attack.”
Malfoy looked terribly uncomfortable with this suggestion and for a moment, Harry wondered whether he was just going to apparate right off the rooftop into the oblivion. Harry dearly hoped not. He was at least somewhat aware that eating kebabs on a rooftop in the middle of winter was probably certifiably insane.
Enjoying Draco’s newfound silence, Harry inclined his head and trailed a series of kisses up Malfoy’s neck, gently pushing aside the neck of the black long sleeve which covered Draco’s torso with his free hand.
If Harry had to think about where it all began he would have said Madam Malkins. But the practical answer is that it started in late 2005, with a fight (typical, really) in the offices of the Daily Prophet.
“Is it going to accost me again?” Malfoy asked, staring at the abnormally high ceilings with suspicion.
“Even for a terribly antisocial person, this is outrageous, Potter,” Malfoy said as Harry flopped down on the synthetic grass covering his rooftop terrace. Given his slightly intoxicated state and his giddiness from the delicious feeling of the warming charm, his drying attempt had only partially worked. He frowned and tried again, willing the plastic to dry out enough for him to avoid getting his only nice suit wet.
He takes the latte gingerly and holds it in his lap. The warmth of the milk through the glass shoots through him and immediately makes him feel comfortable and tired. The opposite of the desired effect, he thinks, but it also might have to do with the fact that he’s so comfortable sitting here, in his cafe, Katie chattering away as she takes orders and makes coffee for the dribs and drabs of people making it through the December chill.
When Harry woke up the next morning he was pleased to find Draco was still cuddled next to him. He was surprised to see that the blonde was already awake, slowly tracing his fingers along Harry’s chest. “Good morning” Harry said croakily.
Harry abruptly broke the kiss and traveled back down to Draco’s waist, where he swallowed his cock down to the hilt, he could feel that the Slytherin was about to burst, and a few seconds later he did, with a yell of ecstasy. Thank Merlin for silencing charms.
When the broke away from each other, arms wrapped around their wastes, they turned sheepishly to their audience, but grinning non the less.
This man was very gorgeous, he had rich, dark skin and was built similarly to Harry, paired with soft facial features.
“I’ll get straight to the point, Mr Potter. I know about your relationship with my son”. His eyes went wide but before he could speak she silenced him with a raised finger. “Draco didn’t have to tell me, but I noticed whenever I saw him over the summer he seemed ravished, which lead me to believe he was seeing someone. The next clue was how utterly devastated he was towards the end of the summer, just as your relationship with the Weasley girl was announced. Of course, this could’ve been coincidence. But when I was told it was
He’s apologised for the way he behaved, how stupid he’d been. And then Harry was apologising for not saving Draco, taking him with him when they had escaped the Manor. Draco couldn’t remember who had moved first but they were then wrapped up in eachother, and they’d apparated to his room.
“Why are you telling us this now?” Hermione asked. Harry sat down next to her at the table and sighed.
He didn’t sleep that night. Harry’s words kept spinning around in his head, barely a whisper that meant so much and so little all at once.
“I’m so proud of you” Harry smiled, tears in his eyes as he gazed at his daughter. He kissed Draco lovingly, and Narcissa joined them in admiring the addition to their family.
Draco noticed that Harry hadn’t moved and was still staring at him, but walked towards him anyway- he had to get past him to get to his dorm of course. “What the hell was that?” Spat Potter, rage flaring on every syllable. He turned to meet his aggressor with a bored, taunting look. “You have her, I want him. Get
This chapter is where things start to get more serious. The condition Cardiomyopathy is mentioned, this isn’t meant to offend anyone and I only did about 15 minutes research into it, the symptoms don’t always match up but it’s important to the story line so please bare with me. Past suicide is also mentioned and will be mentioned again later on, as I think it is important for the salvation of Draco’s character after JK wrecked him. I’m going to try and put another chapter up this weekend- comments are really encouraging, and if you wanted to have a chat/ask any questions you can email me at: unconditionaldrarry@gmail.com <3
“You fucking slut” he hissed out. Draco heard him cast a spell and their outer clothes were removed. Wandless magic, how fucking hot.
Fuck is such a rough word. But Draco couldn’t call what they did “making love” as it wasn’t love. It was just sex. Just sex.
About 5 minutes later there was a gentle hum of noise in the room as the 8th years read up on some magical battle they were meant to care about. A note came sailing over and landed on the middle of Draco’s page. He paused before pretending to only just noticed the note and made sure he didn’t look interested as he read it.
He pulled his want out as he made his way through his flat to his living room and froze when he saw who was sat on his sofa.
.” Draco tried to control his breathing but it was shaken and came out in gasps. Harry scooped Draco up into his arms and Draco’s legs wrapped around his waist almost instinctively.
The pair rushed to take their clothes off, both of them riled up from waiting. It had been a hectic month, and they finally had some time alone together as Narcissa was looking after their children.
“No, fuck you, Malfoy, why’d you have to go an ruin us?” Harry had pressed himself against Draco now, forcing the blonde to look up at him.
“Do you remember, that day over the summer when, you and I cooked dinner at Grimmauld place? And you asked if I was for pudding? You ate me out on a 200 year old table, Harry Potter. And I know it’s pathetic as all hell but that week, that week made me think you might actually love me back, but I realised today that that was never going to happen.” Silence.
was all Harry could see. It was probably all Jacob could see too, the amount of times he’d crushed his fist into his face. He wouldn’t be so pretty anymore. It had taken Ron, Seamus
“i’m gonna cum, fuck I’m gonna cum!” Draco screamed as his orgasm hit, kissing Harry through it. “Thank you Daddy oh thank you”. Harry felt himself reach the edge, thrusting harder into Draco.
The next morning when Harry woke the bed was still warm, but substantially emptied. He sat upright and looked around for his angel, spotting him by the mirror, fixing his gown. “Where are you going?” He asked calmly. Drakon turned around and smiled at him. “I have to go back, my love. We’ll be reunited when you’re finished with this life.” Harry frowned. “How can you go? Isn’t your wing still broken?” He was rambling, trying in vain to say anything to get the angel to stay. “Your magic healed it for me, my love”. Harry raised his eyebrow. “My magic? Is that what the kids are calling it these days?” Draco chuckled.
Harry chuckled and sat back down in bed, smiling at Draco. “Why not? I’ve needed a new personal assistant for a few weeks now. You’ve got the qualifications and it pays well, so why not?”
“I have loved every day of the past 46 years of having you as my own, Draco, you have made my life incredible and are the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I love you to no end and would spend 5 decades with you over, and over again. I love you”.
Draco had walked right out of the tower after Harry had kissed him and stormed into the great hall, where his fellow Slytherin 8th years greeted him for breakfast with questioning looks.
“I’m so happy you’re here”. Harry said happily as his best friend pulled him into a hug. “So am I, mate. I want you there when we have kids”. Harry couldn’t stop smiling.
The place was the same, par for some pots of paint in the corner and a pile of files on the old oak coffee table. As he walked into the middle of the room to pull on his clothes, he noticed something as he tugged his shirt onto his shoulders.
, Darling?” Was his chosen greeting as he waltzed over to his wardrobe to change into his silky black pyjamas. “I can hardly believe that Grover Washington Jr. was a muggle, and besides, half of your wardrobe is just designer muggle brands you hypocrite.” Draco chortled as he made his way over to Blaise. “How’s your Gryffindor?” He Asked his friend. “How’s yours?” He said instantly. Fear clutched Draco’s entire body, how did he know? A second later Blaise burst into laughter. “Just teasing, Darling. I’m going in the shower before bed- there’s a letter for you, by the way, on your desk”.
He lived in a remote cottage on the coast of Scotland, up in the Highlands. The cottage was spacious and modern enough, but it was also fizzing with magic and character. Harry was mainly worried for the safety of his garden that he worked tirelessly over.
Draco’s moans became low and dirty, breath hitching every few seconds. He knew the man above him would be smirking. He felt Harry press his own chest to Draco’s back, whilst one of his hands moved away from Draco’s waist up to his throat, choking him in pleasure. “You’re filthy, so willing to take my cock, aren’t you? Why’ve you been avoiding me for all of these months if you’re so desperate for me?” The charged words left hot breath on Draco’s ear. He heard the anger, as well as the upset in Harry’s voice.
At first, Draco was worried someone had kidnapped James, but he kept hearing giggles around their living room which meant he must still be there somewhere.
” He closed his eyes and rested against the wall in defeat. “I know you don’t believe that. That’s why you’re not with that git of a Ravenclaw”. Harry replies cockily. Draco shoved him hard. “If you really gave a fuck, you’d leave your lover, and we’d be with one another. But we both know you’ll
“Wahey!” The shouts of laughter ringing out from Harry’s doorway was what finally pulled them apart.

“Gods I missed you more, Darling”. Draco leant down and kissed him, his hands clasping the sides of his lover’s face. He adored the feeling of Harry’s beard on his own smooth skin, and couldn’t wait to feel it between his thighs.
.” Draco’s breath quickened as he was shoved up against the wall. He wouldn’t agree to it. He wouldn’t wouldn’t wouldn’t.
And Draco being dumbfounded at the sheer sight of him, following him with his eyes and his mouth open. And Harry just smirking at him, causing Draco’s jaw to snap shut.
ALSO!! Someone (me) figured out how to fix their italics! So maybe go and read the last chapter again, it’ll be so much better with the right expressions
“Draco”. Harry growled, pulling his boyfriend down onto his groin. “yes, Daddy?” Harry moaned and pushed his lover down onto the bed. “I love you so damn much, I’m gonna fuck you so good”. Draco smiled at the aggressive husk in his boyfriends voice.
The blonde lifted his head up shakily, his grey eyes puffy from crying. “Ha-Harry has a new girlfriend” he stuttered, wiping his nose with his sleeve. Ron frowned, before stepping closer and joining the blonde on his sofa.
“Draco please, stop running away from me!” He howled as the blonde continued to race off towards the east wing of the school. It was late, maybe 5pm so there weren’t many people around but those who were out in the corridors stared at both boys as they went past.
He nodded his head shakily, and harry pulled him in for the most passionate kiss the two had shared since their first, all that time ago. “I love you too, Harry. I have never stopped”.
His fingers trailed over his chest, the line of hickeys from the night before still clearly visible. He reached up to his collar bone where they started, and reached down to the waistband of his joggers where they ended. He smirked, oh yes, Draco would know
Neither of them could hold out much longer, so Draco slid down onto his lover’s cock, causing them both to gasp in the pleasure.
“And of course, there are those who we lost in the war, and along the way. My sons James Sirius, and Cedric Remus, know they were named after the strongest, most resilient men that died to save me, as vain as that sounds. I value them all so much-“
He made his way over to the box and lifted it into his arms, now just standing there looking at him.
“What are you doing in the 8th year dorms, Jacob?” Asked Draco accusingly. He’d realised over the course of the evening that he felt very little for he boy and, was done with using him. “I was looking for you, since we didn’t get to meet yesterday”. Draco ran a fast nervous hand through his hair. “I was in the hospital wing, not that you came to see me.” He said hautily before moving to walk away, but was stopped by a hand on his wrist. “They wouldn’t let me in to see you. Let me make it up to you- if you’ll still go to Hogsmeade with me this weekend I’ll make it worth your while.” Draco turned on his heel in an instant.
Resting his head on his hands he wonders how long Ron is going to take getting ready. He has work tomorrow, and if he doesn't get to bed before eleven, he might just have to call in sick.
“Don’t be a tease, Malfoy,” Harry muttered with frustration, as Draco drew his face slightly out of reach.
“It’s not like that, Hermione!” he insisted, running his free hand through the birds’ nest mop that habituated itself on his head.
“Well, the Ministry’s Ethics Committee might be a bit difficult about it, but Hermione and I worked out that it’s fine because I’m not actually your superior and-”
“Fucking he-” he exclaimed, before realising that this intruder was more intent on accosting his lips than carrying out a violent home invasion.
“If we can’t get to your bedroom right now Potter, this is going to happen on the floor, and then where will your spine be?”
So Harry does what Harry does best, and says something that later, he will attempt to kick himself in the face for.
“Don’t have a crisis, Harry,” she says, with bemused satisfaction. “No one is asking you to snog anyone.”
Katie, with the unwilling indenture of her brothers, has transformed the space from casual coffee shop into a Christmas-themed castle, complete with some really complex spellwork which has made the ceiling look like the black starry-sky of the north pole and plastic reindeer which have been charmed to throw their heads and paw at the ground at random intervals. She’s even managed to hang a humongous banner over the tables which reads “The Annual St. Drogo Christmas Bash,” in sparkly green and red letters.
Harry desperately hopes Malfoy thinks he has just had a momentary lapse in concentration and was not just obsessing over his tongue on a
Harry wondered in that moment whether, after all these years, he finally had developed a death wish. He initially fought fate but there just simply wasn’t another way to make Draco Malfoy
The next thing Harry registers is that his eyes have become involuntarily transfixed. He tries to tear them away, but he fails. He feels like his eyes are being pried open like in that odd muggle movie Hermione made him watch about criminals and clocks. The cafe feels a million miles away. He tries to swallow but his throat feels simultaneously as dry as the Sahara desert and like it has a bezoar stuck in there. He remembers that Malfoy has asked a question but he can’t recall what it is.
Draco, to his credit, looked genuinely taken aback. Maybe he wasn’t being a complete prat, Harry thought. He just said, “Oh. Me either,” and looked a bit sheepish about it.
The blonde eyebrows quirked and Draco’s mouth twitched back into a satisfied smile. “Such a Gryffind-”
Harry wasn’t quite sure at what point he fell asleep. He felt like he was staring at Draco’s profile for an eternity, wondering what was going through his head and whether it would be too much too soon to move closer. It wasn’t until the morning, that he realised at some point their bodies had acted of their own accord, because he found himself waking up tucked up behind Draco’s body with his left hand draped over his waist.
“I didn’t force you to,” she protests, dropping her wand hand mid-spell and scrougifying the menus stacked under the sink instead of the countertop. “You wanted to!”
Harry shuffled over so he was sitting cross legged in front of him. Once again, he tested his luck and grasped the fine, aristocratic hands in his own. “I’m not drunk, you idiot.”
“Was the house your parent’s?” Draco asked, frowning at the contents of one of the pages at the centre of the book. Harry dearly hoped he had happened upon the section detailing the various Gryffindor victories against Slytherin in the Quidditch Cup.
“I might have been Kinglsey Shacklebolt,” Harry says drily, pointing to the large stack of unread reports which now sit innocently on one side of Ron’s desk.
That being said, he was acutely aware that he didn’t know Draco that well. He didn’t see him every day when he went home to the Manor after work, he didn’t know how he spoke with his peers or his parents or even what he truly thought about the War. To be honest, Harry hadn’t stopped to think about it for long because he was on a totally unstoppable, one-way track to being obsessed with Draco Malfoy and nothing the man had done along that journey had dissuaded him in the slightest.
Despite the unfortunate circumstances, Harry couldn’t have ever recalled feeling so good on a Saturday morning. Here, with his arms around someone he never in a million years would have counted on
Draco smirked, his hand turning softly over to lift Harry’s chin with his thumb and forefinger. It was the only time that Harry really noticed the height difference between them. The single inch didn’t strike a huge contrast in day to day activities but when he was pressed up against a solid wall with Draco’s face centimetres from his, he noticed that the latter’s 5”10 frame did give him a slight advantage.
“You’re the one who insisted on inviting Draco Malfoy for Merlins’ sakes,” Harry hisses, looking furtively toward the back table to make sure it isn’t occupied by a blond demon. Thankfully, the table is empty.
Ron’s face is incredulous. “Harry, mate,” he says, exasperation lacing itself into every word, “I know you have that complex and all, but when it comes to the Draco Malfoy’s of the world, can you at least
“Why?” Malfoy snaps back, “I have no interest in getting someone ridiculously drunk, unlike you who clearly can’t manage to impart some desire for
Harry can’t bear Katie looking forlorn and guilty, even if it is her fault that she invited a former blood purist and Harry’s sworn arch nemesis to an event that Harry is funding and is obliged to attend. If Harry has to cope with Draco Malfoy for a night, he can do that, he thinks. He’s even managed to have two vaguely mature conversations with him over two weeks. The very fact that neither Harry nor Malfoy drew a wand on either of those occasions is no mean feat.
Draco was in the bathroom, avoiding any kind of post coital interaction. This wasn’t unusual, on the contrary it was to be expected. However, Harry sort of wished he would have made an exception for once. Although, he supposed, it wasn’t
He looks down at the brown, tea stains on his right lapel, which he thought had been rather conveniently hidden in the dark navy of the Ministry's robes. Now that he looks again, they are rather obvious. He sighs, and rubs absentmindedly on one of them with his left hand.
He leant forward slightly. The smell, the touch, the being so close to Draco Malfoy was as intoxicating as any alcohol Harry had consumed that night. His hands ached to reach across the gap between their faces and
, Harry thought. Was he seriously thinking about Voldemort? When, at that moment, he had a gorgeous, blond
Harry’s stomach flipped uncomfortably. “Andromeda was blasted off by Walburga, I think,” he said. “She married a muggleborn.”
Harry thought of Narcissa, and a wave of guilt crashed over him again. Of course Draco should be with the family he had left. It was just that Harry had this inexplicable need to try and make it better. To try to help heal the wound and make Draco feel whole again.
“I’m not sure, to be honest,” Draco replied after a minute. He still looked ridiculously shocked, an expression Harry was fairly sure Draco had never worn for this long. “I’ve never had it happen before. What do you say?”
“So I saw someone suspicious at the cafe on Saturday,” he begins, trying to coax Ron out of his impending bad mood.
That thought made Harry feel a bit selfish. Draco’s father, however questionable his attitude toward Harry may have been, had just
having children. He teases Hermione a bit and asks how she is going to teach a child to read before they can speak but deep down he knows that really, she could have been his surrogate mother for all of the looking after him she’s done.
“You suggested it,” she winks, all worry vanishing from her face. “To be honest, I was worrying you were going to spontaneously give me the sack.”
“Thanks,” Harry said, frowning. He wasn’t sure if the comment was an observation or an insult, but he never really was quite sure with Draco. He was completely unperplexed that he had chosen to ignore the word
“You promised me a tour of the bedrooms, Harry Potter,” Draco said quietly, hand pushing Harry’s t-shirt upwards to expose his skin to Draco’s touch. Harry shivered with anticipation in response as Draco leant down over him again, “and I intend to collect.”
“So you didn’t fancy a trip across the channel?” he asked Draco, keen to steer the conversation away from the war. He was sure it was only a matter of expression, but it still made him slightly uncomfortable the way Draco referred to Voldemort as “the Dark Lord.” To Harry, it implied some kind of unshakeable reverence.
Draco seemed to accept this answer and turned his attention to a nearby cupboard, reaching down to wrench open the handle.
Not that they wear their work robes to the pub but, as Harry has started to realise recently, their fashion sense is becoming more out of touch with London’s muggle youth.
Harry caught sight of himself in the mirror which hung above the fireplace opposite him. His eyes were wide, harried looking, like a frenzied animal. In short, he looked absolutely nuts.
“Luciana,” he calls into the near empty hallway. His grey-haired secretary whisks in, notepad and quill at the ready. Harry thinks she always looks like there’s an emergency of some kind. She frowns at him.
“I only meant to ask what his take on the media release would be,” Hermione continued, trying to soothe him by placing a hand on his back.
“What, talking?” Draco drawled, raising an eyebrow in the fashion Harry was so used to. “What a crime, someone alert the Ministry.”
Harry laughed. This was surprisingly easy. It had definitely helped that Draco didn’t seem to want to apparate away from him, or recommend he book himself in for a stay at St. Mungos. He had even let Harry
She laughs and shoves him in the side, then turns and sticks a cigarette in her mouth and saunters out to the side of the shop which has been turned into a makeshift smokers area. He wants to say something but doesn’t, as he watches her flop down on a bench next to a mysterious looking character in a hooded cloak who Harry can’t quite get a glimpse of.
he missed flying, he thought as he lead the way towards the empty lot on the edge of the woods. Someone, probably a bunch of teenagers, had set up crude Quidditch hoops that were a fraction of the height of normal ones. Harry grasped the snitch that was in it’s small locked box in his pocket and released it, chucking the empty box at Draco’s head when he had turned back to look at the hoops.
“Oh, the shagging part,” Harry said, smiling. “Don’t worry about that. I just couldn’t handle her liking you more than me.”
“Probably why you’re so much smarter than me,” Harry said, grinning at her. “Less concussions; more brain cells.”
“No need, Auror Potter,” Kingsley replied in his deep voice, swiftly rising from his seat opposite Ron and vanishing the chair. “I was just leaving.”
“Just because I don’t feel the need to drink myself into a stupor doesn’t mean I don’t know how to have fun, Potter,” he says, “although I wouldn’t expect you to have enough common sense to know that.”
He really was a talented flier, Harry thought for the briefest of seconds as he shot after Draco, urging his broom forward. He had skill and finesse and he looked
“It depends,” Harry says. He’s about to mention something about trying to murder a headmaster, poisoning one of his best friends and vanishing cabinets but he stops himself just in time.
Spurred on, Harry’s tongue brushed lightly against Draco’s as he deepened the kiss, touching, taking whatever he could from a moment in time that he had previously thought was downright impossible. It was so ridiculous and yet so fucking
Ten minutes later, Harry pushes open the dark wooden door to Ron's office just in time to see the red-head shoving his stack of reports messily under his identical desk.
Harry sighed, but smiled. He didn’t want to take the risk and he had a feeling that if he could keep the conversation light hearted, it might not be a total failure of a night.
Harry nodded. He had been fortunate enough to co-habit with Voldemort’s mind for the first seventeen years of his life.
Harry laughed. “If you wanted to clean an old house with me so badly, Draco, you could have just asked.”
“Look, how about this,” Malfoy says, and Harry thinks he can’t quite remember them being so close before.
The thought came to him as he smiled, a little forcefully at a waiter as he accepted a full champagne flute from a silver-gilded tray and turned to face the remainder of the room. His eyes, almost immediately (and wholly involuntarily, Harry thought) found the back of a pale blonde and meticulously groomed head. Equal parts aristocratic and impressive, with just the slightest hint of obsessive-compulsive.
“I hope you’re not his superior, Harry,” Hermione said thoughtfully, “inter-office relationships between superiors and subordinates are a breach of the Ministry’s ethics policy.”
He certainly has no hard feelings towards her, but then again, maybe he doesn't have any feelings at all. There is a part of him that worries, inadvertently, that there is nothing left of him to feel. After seeing so many horrors of the war, he hasn't found it easy to slip back in to normal life. Certainly not in the way that his other school friends have. Not even Hermione, who Harry knows still has night terrors and carries a bottle of dittany everywhere with her.
To Harry’s complete shock, Malfoy laughs and says, “Bruce Wayne is a hero, Potter. I hardly think we are alike.”
Somehow, he spent a solid two hours sitting in a bar, talking amicably with Draco Malfoy about things ranging from coffee beans to muggle movies and somehow, he feels like they never ran out of things to say.
“Dark artefacts, Harry?” Malfoy said quizzically, turning to appraise Harry. “Wouldn’t have picked you as the type.”
Harry scoffed. “I’d love to see your interpretation of tasteful, Malfoy.” He could feel Draco’s smirk permeating the back of his neck.
Malfoy half smiles and says “okay,” in a cool and nonchalant way, and Harry feels like he’s drowning in his own awkwardness.
, where he sleeps fitfully and wakes up every hour, terrified, hot and uncomfortable. Those nights where a tent in a snowy forest haunts him and he can viscerally hear Hermione screaming for mercy at the cruel, twisting hands of Bellatrix Lestrange.
Draco wrapped long fingers around his mug for warmth. “Well, these people tell me that I’m boring and
“Well, it is sort of like the Batmobile,” Harry says before he can stop the words coming out of his mouth. He chastises himself for forgetting that Malfoy is an entitled pureblood and didn’t grow up as a muggle, stealing Dudley’s barely-read Batman comics and playing computer games set in Gotham City when the Dursleys were out of the house.
He is permanently perplexed as to why Ron insists on acting as if he had never known about the existence of coffee. It wasn’t as if he hadn’t had it before. They’d even managed to squeeze one in on the run from Death Eaters in London after Bill and Fleur's wedding. A few months ago, Hermione had forced him to try another cappuccino at Harry’s cafe, and even though Ron complained that it tasted of dirt and hippogriff’s piss (how Ron had any idea what hippogriff’s piss tasted like, Harry wasn’t sure), Harry had noticed that he finished the whole cup.
It’s oddly refreshing really. Harry feels like maybe next time Malfoy comes into the cafe he won’t be rude-on-purpose to him, even if he does drink soy.
Harry’s frustration had unfortunately reached a breaking point. He was tired and irritable and completely overwhelmed by his irrational feeling of guilt for firing Perkins, his persistent self doubt about his ability to run the Auror office and his utterly nonsensical and insatiable desire for his former nemesis-turned-colleague. He had an irrational desire to pick up a beater’s bat and bash some bludgers or fight someone or set fire to the stack of unauthorised Harry Potter biographies sitting in the window of Flourish and Blotts.
“If there’s anyone to thank for that, its you,” Harry pointed out. “If you’d never been such a bloody prat and stolen that Remembrall-”
She smirks, handing him the coffee mug balanced on a large saucer. The soy's nutty fragrance wafts up from the expertly poured latte art that stares at Harry as he accepts his fate.
Draco’s eyes flitted to Harry’s hand but he didn’t make an attempt to move away. “Can I retract that comment?” he asked, scowl still firmly in place.
"Let me guess, not hot enough?" Harry says, openly smiling now. He can imagine the scene in his minds eye. Meldrid, coming in at precisely the same time as twenty other customers, demanding her coffee be sent out first and then demanding two more re-makes to her liking.
The stack of paper looks forlorn and limp but Harry resists the urge to pick them up and pushes them roughly to the side of the desk. Future Harry's problem, he decides. He isn't sticking around today to do them. If Luciana is ever right about anything, it is that a tea-related disaster might occur if he tries to push his exhausted mind any farther.
"Look, I have to go home first and help Hermione make dinner," Ron says, roughly levitating and dropping various stacks of paper around his office, "but after that we should get a pint. We did that interview of one of the Kelley brothers' known contacts today, not to mention," Ron's voice drops to a whisper, "Hermione's dead scary at the moment. This baby's getting to her brain I think."
“Er, no,” Harry says, confused as to why Ron would think two of the wizarding world’s most wanted criminals would casually turn up to his muggle-inspired cafe.
“-Xactly,” Ron said, swallowing a mouth full of chow mein. “I’m not sure anyone’s upset about Lucius being in the horizontal telephone box.”
“Talking comes later, Potter,” he heard Draco whisper as his lips trailed kisses further down Harry’s chest as his hands found Harry’s belt buckle and released it easily.
Harry grinned involuntarily. “My rooftop, my rules, Malfoy,” he said, “sit yourself down you snobby prat and eat your kebab.”
Harry sat back on the couch and sipped his mead. Hermione’s self refilling charm automatically applied itself to his cup.
He doesn’t often think about the fact that he’s lonely and never goes on dates and prefers his own company because honestly, he doesn’t really care. He hasn’t even bothered to take stock of why he doesn’t care, either. If he had to rationalise it, he would say it’s because his work schedule is so packed, he simply doesn’t have the time.  A small part of him worries from time to time that he’s simply too broken and riddled with insidious post-traumatic stress to even have feelings like that, anymore.
“Maybe not,” Hermione replied, “but I have Harry as a friend and I learnt to live with his questionable choices long ago.”
At that moment Levi turns on the coffee machine and promises everyone espresso martinis despite not knowing how to use it and Harry goes and saves the day because, despite what Katie might say, he knows how to use the coffee machine competently enough. Levi pours very generous vodka shots and charms the magical blender to shake itself violently with too much liquid in it until there’s literally espresso martinis for everyone who has crammed themselves into the establishment and then some.
In 2008, he was 28 years old. Pre-30. The perfect time to take risks, according to the advice column in the Prophet, at least. Although Draco supposed that the Prophet probably meant things like changing careers or starting a business or taking up quidditch professionally. Not telling your former enemy that you might not hate them anymore - or worse.
He really needs a life. Or a relationship. Or both. Despite being surrounded constantly by people, Harry feels terribly lonely, he admits. Things with Ginny were never going to work out after the war. He wasn't sure what changed, but the young infatuation had dried up so quickly, like old flowers in vase, and the petals had all dropped off one by one until there was nothing but the shrivelled stem left.
“Are you going to be smashing those down next week at our Christmas party too?” he asks, raising an eyebrow.
there was something there that had never been there before. A spark, ignited in the act of pressing himself even closer to Draco that quickly became an out-of-control, burning need. Something that was totally incomparable and incapable of explanation.
“Yet!” He exclaimed. Then, reigning in his exasperation, he muttered under his breath, “by Salazar you’re a twat, Harry Potter.”
to make Draco Malfoy despise him, since he had recently discovered that he was insatiably attracted to the man.
Harry picked up one of Draco’s hands and held it, looking as deeply into the pale grey eyes as he could.
Harry tries to think on his feet. It doesn’t go well. “I don’t have anything better to do,” he says.
"Sure," she says, shrugging her shoulders, "Only because i know the chances of that happening are roughly the same as me winning a billion galleons."
Harry supposed he should have seen the change coming. After all, things never stayed simple in his world for long. Harry hadn’t even managed to have a normal childhood before he’d discovered he was famous for being an indestructible infant and then thrown down the gauntlet to fight in a war he hadn’t started.
“You’re hardly in the way,” she replies, gesturing around them. “Do you like being in Siberia all the time or will you come out to be amongst the people one day?”
An uncomfortable feeling, like a heavy weight, settled itself in Harry’s stomach. Surely Draco would have told him if Lucius had been seriously ill. But then again, they hadn’t divulged much about their family history outside the Black family tree (not that Harry really had much to contribute). Still, it didn’t sit well.
“No,” Malfoy says abruptly. “Honestly, Potter just stay put and I’ll drive you home. It’s painful watching you do that.”
“Looks like you have your own Hand of Glory,” Draco said, ignoring Harry and peering into the cupboard. “I used to have one of those.”
“I was going to make a working hard or hardly working joke,” he said, sounding slightly concerned as he surveyed what Harry imagined was something akin to a troll’s cave, “but it turns out its not as funny if you’re actually working.”
“Touchy, touchy, Potter,” he said softly, voice velvety as he stepped closer to Harry, whose back was against the wall opposite the cupboard, and ran the back of his hand over Harry’s cheek.
Harry felt a rush of affection as the interlacing of their fingers ran shivers of excitement up his arm. He craved this closeness. Affection, even, which Harry reasoned he was unlikely to get most of the time from someone like Draco Malfoy.
Harry snorted. He felt immature bickering with Draco about Hogwarts house rivalries, but he supposed it was a legitimate pursuit since the houses went back however many hundreds of years (he never had gotten around to reading “Hogwarts: A History,” much to Hermione’s disdain).
at that. Harry can’t even remember the last time he went in a car but he suspects it was probably with the Dursleys and their car was so nondescript and bland and Dursleyish that he can’t even remember what make it was.
“How did you open it?” Harry persisted, still astonished that his ongoing battle with the house had been so easily won by Malfoy.
“Yes please,” Draco said, his features rearranging themselves into a haughty expression as he lowered himself gracefully into the chair on the opposite side of the desk.
You might be able to reform a blood purist and a Death Eater, Harry thought, but apparently a Malfoy didn’t change all of it’s spots.
Just then, another interoffice memo flies into his office, colliding with the back of Luciana’s head. She turns indignantly to face the piece of paper now flying towards Harry. He catches it easily.
Harry balks. Of course he isn’t. Even Draco Malfoy’s disappointment would be too much for him. Then again, Harry can’t help but wonder if Draco Malfoy would even be disappointed at being uninvited to an event hosted by Harry Potter. Harry thinks he may actually be relieved. Besides that, he knows Malfoy is a selfish prat and probably feels no urgent sense of obligation. Harry’s heart lightens.
Harry absolutely forgets about his Draco Malfoy-induced anxiety as soon as the Christmas party begins. The buzz of friendly faces, mead, wine and music is making Harry feel unseasonably warm, satiated and comfortable in a way that is unquestionably rare for him.
Harry frowned. “I thought you liked my hair,” he said defensively, “and besides, there’s no point berating me for it, it never does what it’s told, anyway.”
“Hello Harry,” Hermione said as she answered the door, then noticed Draco lurking in the background, looking supremely uncomfortable.
“But where is she?” Draco asked obliviously. “I had heard rumours of a second cousin, of course, but they were rumours of a baby werewolf. I thought they were just made up by the other Death Eaters to further muddy Mother and Father’s reputation.”
Draco nodded mutely, and that’s how they ended up disapparating to the wizarding village where Hermione and Ron’s cottage was and rapping on their door at midday.
, Harry thought. It was a strangely conflicting concept, to be fair. Harry was irrefutably attracted to Malfoy, and definitely not only in the physical sense. But at the same time he was acutely aware that a public relationship between the Boy-Who-Lived and the only former Death Eater employed by the Ministry, was going to raise both a few eyebrows and some awkward questions.
Harry stuck his head around the portrait, interrupting Walburga’s dreary oration. “Actually, he’s come here to shag me.”
. He was also acutely aware that Mr Grange was trying to stall him, and Harry was having none of it.
Why did Malfoy, of all people, have to be a customer at Harry’s shop? Surely he was far too ridiculously snobby to want to hang about in a muggle-inspired cafe. Ron is right, it is suspicious.
"Yes," Katie, all matter-of-fact and tapping the milk jug on the bench to diffuse the bubbles in the foam, "now be a good staff member and deliver this to him won't you?"
Potter said nothing, and simply looked down at his drink with a stoic expression. Draco approximated that without intervention, Potter wouldn’t be doing anything worth watching tonight. Except, perhaps, falling over his own feet, which Draco would much rather have watched from a safe distance.
that all Harry could do was hope to Merlin that it wouldn’t be the last time because he needed this as much as (well, maybe not breathing) but at the very least his broomstick and friendship and meaningful employment.
"Draco, please!  I just need you to take him for one day!  I've got to do some things and I can't divide my attention."
The small step Harry takes brings them even closer, and Draco can feel Harry's breath on his blushing cheeks.
"Oh I'm sorry! I wasn't looking where I was going." Then I saw who I bumped into and smiled. "Narcissa! Good to see you!"
The warm water runs over Harry’s hands and into the kitchen sinks he zones out.  He wonders when Draco will be back from his date and immediately frowns.  His date.  Harry hopes he won’t bring the date back to their flat again.
Crap.  I walked into the wrong door.  And now I was walking the wrong way through Ikea.  Just shoot me already.
“Argh!” Harry rams headfirst into someone, tripping and almost falling over, except for the fact that the person caught him.
Harry is too busy clutching his stomach with laughter to respond, placing one hand on the desk to keep from rolling on the ground.
Excitedly, he pulls it out, discovering that there’s probably enough to make a suit jacket and pants from.
Harry playfully slaps my shoulder and the thrill that runs through my body at his touch as me blushing and stuttering for hours.
He doesn’t say anything after that, and Draco becomes acutely aware of how close they’re actually standing, feeling the dark-haired boy's breath tickle his cheeks.
Harry’s laughing at his comeback and Draco is laughing too, and he realizes that maybe dating Harry isn’t such a bad idea.
Instead, I’m staring at his jet black hair and coffee-colored skin, enraptured by the way he glows even in the shoddy light of the airplane.
He drank the potion and I cast a warming spell on his soup.  Then I leaned over and kissed his forehead.  But I hesitated before pulling away.  I put my fingertips underneath his chin and guided his head slightly upwards so I could kiss him for what would probably be the last time.  He'd never want to kiss me again, I'm sure.  So I made this one last.  It was gentle.  It was sweet.  He kissed back a tiny bit... or maybe that was my imagination.  Whichever it was, I knew I was in trouble.  I was starting to love Draco Malfoy.
We had previously cleansed and removed all the furniture and moved it into a trunk with an Extension Charm on it so that we could see what could be kept and what would need to go.  Downstairs we sat in the living room, sorting it all into other trunks with similar charms that were for furniture that would be kept and gotten rid of.
“I- I know for the last few months we’ve been fake-dating, but every second I spend with you is amazing.
In fact, he almost misses the thermos on the ground, except for the draft that blows the note inside.
He knows Harry’s handwriting and he knows Harry’s go-to spell (expelliarmus, for whatever ungodly reason).
“He’s only hooking up to try to forget you and get over you ‘cuz he thinks you don’t like him.  That’s why they’re only one-night stands, because he’s too in love with you to actually date anyone else.”
As if this friendship wasn't bad enough, Harry saw me having that nightmare last night. He saw me weak, human. He's supposed to think I'm better than him, a strong person.
Apparently his definition of 'taking my arm' is holding my hand.  I don't mean he grabbed my hand in the normal way, either.  He interlocked our fingers and squeezed a tiny bit for a moment.  When I looked up, his expression mirrored mine: surprise.  Apparently he didn't realize what he did either.  Weirdly enough, however, neither one of us let go.
Unfortunately, when I look up, Harry’s gotten off the plane, and people are waiting on me to get off too, so I haul my messenger bag on to my shoulder and revel in the fresh air outside the plane.
The cold ring slides onto his finger and warm lips are pressed against his, then his forehead, then his previously empty ring finger.
As we walked through the store, I questioned him on what time of vibe he was going for in the place.  He said he wanted a modern but warm, woody feeling, so we settled on off-white and dark oak color scheme with blue accents.  As we walked through, I could tell he was trying to be civil, so I at least did the same.  Plus, he didn't look quite so annoying when he was smiling, which we both ending up doing a lot of that day.
“The cats are going to love this stupidly soft sweater,” Draco says, patting the couch beside him for Pickle and Buckbeak to hop up.
It’s not wrapped very well and the twine around it is coming loose without much prodding, and when Draco opens it he only discovers a perfectly cubic cardboard box.
After owling Narcissa back confirming the time, I fixed up dinner and made a list of what I needed to do to fix the house.
Draco snorted.  "Are you saying I'm not smart?"  Then his eyes widened as he realized what he said.  I blushed and he moved on, brushing it off.
Draco sees Harry flush red under the disappointed glare of McGonagall, hastily wrapping himself in the towel and standing.
"Hello Harry, do come in! I'm sorry if there's any mess, the house elves cleaned up quite nicely though," Narcissa welcomed me.
But it was also that faith that got some of them killed.  He taught those kids himself, each and every one of them.  And some of them still died.
"He's here because I've been helping him renovate and clean his home, and he's staying here for the night because of it.  He'll be here tomorrow night too, if you want to go spend time with one of your friends," mum answered.
Apparently, Harry is closer to Draco than he thinks because Harry slams into Draco’s fully-clothed back and they trip over each other, landing in a heap on the floor and waking multiple portraits while they’re at it.
Then, of course, there’s Dumbledore’s Army, from fifth year.  Just ten years ago, he taught a ragtag group of kids from every house everything he knew at the time, looking at them like friends and comrades, not just fellow students.  People he’d never met before joined a cause they’d only learned about moments prior.  It was that faith that made the right side win the war.
Why Is Harry Potter Confusing Me, And When Will He Begin to Make Sense, the fourth book in my personal biographical series.
Harry shakes his head, but Ron and Hermione share a glance that tells him this won’t be the end of it for them.
“I dunno. One minute they were in the ocean together, then I looked up and Draco was gone and Harry was… well, like this.”
“Well, you’re acting like we’re old friends, not like we’ve tried to hurt each other on multiple occasions,” Malfoy bites out.
The nostalgia hits him like the Whomping Willow, and he grins, filled with such joy and happiness.  Filling his plate wing chicken legs and peas mashed potatoes and pudding, he thinks back to memories of his early Hogwarts years.
I myself had a glass of beer.  Sweet and smooth, it was my favorite.  I was surprised the pub carried it.
“Are you going to keep following me to this club, Potter, or will you finally grow out of your obsession with me?” Draco says into Harry’s ear, continuing to dance with him.
He whirls around angrily, coming face-to-face with one Harry Potter who’s standing unnervingly close to him.
He thinks about the fate of Hogwarts often, how maybe it was his fault, maybe he could’ve prevented it.  But he remembers what Dean tells him at their weekly group support sessions,
“I’m… I wanted to…” Words fail him, but he sees Ron nod encouragingly and leave, giving him strength.
Harry leaves the clay smeared on his cheek when they leave, not wanting to ruin the moment when he and Draco first fell in love.
Draco has finally managed to push Harry to the corner of his mind and get back into routine when the shoppe bell rings and that peculiar dark-haired man walks back in.
He really should’ve seen it coming but drowsiness and a false sense of security distract him from the obvious, and Draco Malfoy wakes up the next morning with bright gold and red Gryffindor hair.
“Of course.  Please come in, I would like to brief you and remind you of the rules you so frequently broke in your youth,” she says with a twinkle in her eye.
He tries every counterspell in the book, every hair-changing charm that he knows of, but nothing works.
"Well, after seven years of fighting Voldemort, I was kind of done catching criminals," I said jokingly.
"Let's get out of here," he whispered huskily into my ear.  I nodded, throwing some cash on the bar before pulling him to the men's bathroom so we could apparate away.
Draco has laid out a miniature feast on the kitchen counter, with muffins, chocolate croissants, buttered toast, and cheese danishes. Is he trying to impress Harry?
It’s been a few years since his trial, since Harry Potter stuck his neck out for him against all odds, since Draco decided to leave Wizarding London and get a job in a quaint Muggle craft shoppe.
The sound gets Draco’s heart stuck in his throat, and he finds himself giving a small smile as well.
The only rule is that it can’t cost more than €100 per person.  That's probably what the letter's about.”
"Oh no, I'm in love with you against my son's will!  Whatever shall we do?" She said sarcastically, trying to keep a straight face.
Harry frowns and goes back to eating his food, trying to come up with a way to prove that he isn’t thickheaded.
He shakes his neck and straightens his suit - Gryffindor red for Harry - and stands, promise ring in his pocket.
"Well, I had another idea.  Before you say no, just hear me out," she began.  "Draco has marvelous taste, as I raised him to, and you probably want to get moved in as soon as possible to avoid Draco more.  So I was wondering-"
Draco turns around in time to see Harry hoisting himself out of the baths, water dripping down his toned torso and muscles in full action.
With a (miraculously) straight face, Harry turns to Draco and says, “Well, Mr. Malfoy, how lovely of you to support Gryffindor today!
This sends Draco into yet another laughing fit, only silenced when he receives a stern look from McGonagall.
After making dinner and feeding Mocha and my owl, Ella, I slept nicely knowing that tomorrow would be wonderful.
Maybe it’s a good thing that I took this flight, and maybe it’s a good thing that Harry was on it too.
Harry wakes up the next day and hopes that Draco’s hookup isn’t still at their apartment, because the only thing worse than hearing them is running into them.
I’m leaving,” he jokes, although he’s got two cats fighting over his lap and one slung around his shoulders, so he’s not going anywhere.
“I had a question about something I was planning on teaching this year; could I speak to you in private?”
Harry cracked open the door and looked at me, staying in the hallway. I wanted to make him feel foolish after that awkward encounter on the stairs, so I said "Don't just stand in the hallway. I said 'come in' for a reason, you know."
“Er- yeah, Ron had something to… to do…” Harry gets lost in Draco’s eyes for a moment too long, but doesn’t look away this time.
I walked over to his bedside table and set down his soup and potion.  I made to leave and go back to my room but Draco mumbled my name.
He hesitated.  "Uhm... sure.  I'm heading over in about an hour.  Whenever you wanna apparate over is fine."
"Good enough," he said, rolling his eyes and walking out, not closing the door behind him, so I was forced to watch him leave.  And let me say, that's a very nice arse.
“Whatever you need to tell yourself, Potter,” Draco says, fighting the grin that wants to creep onto his lips.
I woke up the next morning alone.  As usual.  Just my luck that the only boy I feel a connection with while having sex just up and leaves.
I walked around the island to find two hangover potions and two bowls of chicken noodle soup and when I looked up, Narcissa was sitting at the counter across from me.
All of a sudden Draco feels a pair of lips on his cheek, and then Harry pulls away, blushing at the ground.
The rest of the evening continues with them planning food - Draco wants the food to be fancy but Harry convinces him that ‘it’s quidditch, we need sports food’ - decorations, and times.
I finished my soup and looked for my shirt, only to not be able to find it.  I decided just to put on a new one, figuring it got thrown somewhere obscure in last nights fun.
“I’m not gonna lie, I thought you two were already dating when you bought an apartment together,” Neville says, much to Harry’s surprise.
If Draco was in his right mind, he would’ve heard the entertained tone in his voice, but alas, he is not.
Mother would’ve told me to hold my head high and ignore him. Father would’ve told me to request a seat change for Potter.
One day, they’re chatting at lunch like they’re old pals, and the next, they’re hexing each other under their breath.
“Uh, mate, the goal is to not be homophobic,” Ron says and Harry nods sadly and takes another gulp of his beer.
He really tries not to be.  There’s nothing wrong with being gay!  Or identifying in any other way, for that matter.  He himself can agree that men are attractive.  But he can’t figure out any other explanation for why he’d be so upset by Draco bringing men home.  And going on dates.  And being gay.  He just doesn’t get it.
Still frowning, Harry says slowly, “I don’t like Draco dating other people and I don’t known why?”  The four look at him expectantly and he shakes his head.  “Guys what am I missing?”
Twelve rotations have never seemed so long for Harry, and all he can do is wait anxiously as Draco moves the ladle fluidly.
"About 10:00.  I left some coffee in the pot but you'll have to warm it.  Let me know before you leave the house, just so that I know where you are dear."
“This is becoming a weekly occurrence, Potter,” Draco smirks as Harry approaches the register with two orange skeins of yarn in hand.
He’s decided to sit in the empty seat beside me, rather than stay in his seat across the aisle, for whatever ungodly reason.
Because if there was a problem, I can trust that the two of you would come to me, and not take it out on each other.”
Every time he gets close to Harry to take a new measurement, he feels the man tense and hears him inhale softly like he’s slightly startled.
Ron regains control of himself first and finishes Neville’s sentence.  “Mate, you just said you don’t like him dating other people.  Other people.  People who… aren’t you?  Maybe?”
giving the front a welcoming vibe, despite the fact that all the outer walls are blackened with peeling paint.
First he sneezed, and I automatically said bless you - I was raised with manners, you know - and we just stared at each other, surprised. He looked away first.
Draco takes a moment to admire Harry’s white tank top, flannel, and jeans which reveal his abs and wonderful arse.
There’s no signature at the bottom, but Draco would recognize that chicken-scratch handwriting anywhere.
I looked at him incredulously.  "Okay, whatever.  The point is, I like you too and you're cute and..." I trailed off.  I've never been very good with feelings.  So instead I walked closer to Harry, closing the gap between us.  His chest was on mine and I felt him heart race.  I put my hand under the side of his jaw and chin and pulled him into me, kissing him hard.
Who decided that it would be a good idea to put color-changing wallpaper in a place where ninety-nine percent of the people are plastered?
SMUT WARNING:  This chapter is entirely smut.  No non-con or anything, just pure smut.  If you don't wanna read that you can skip straight to the next chapter, you won't have missed anything important here.
I was walking through a Flourish and Blotts, just to see if they had any interesting new books, I ran into someone I didn't think I'd ever see again.
He’s hyper-aware of Draco’s pretense beside him and keeps trying to discreetly glance over at the blonde boy.
Draco lying naked on my bare chest was the most fabulous feeling in the world.  It was even better than when we were... he couldn't even think about it.
They eat in relatively comfortable silence, enjoying the sounds of children laughing and silverware clinking all around them.
“Luna is one of the models for my fashion line,” Draco says proudly, looking at Harry in the mirror.
Draco only mumbles that last part, and Harry pretends not to hear, instantly putting at least a meter between them.
He drops the sponge and lets his finger snake around the back of the blond's neck, pulling him ever so slightly closer.
"Yes, thank you.  Happy Holidays!"  With that, I left the store.  Since it was only 12:30, I figured I could shop around and see what kinds of gifts I could get mum this holiday season.
He interrupts a first year potions class to heckle Draco, and he absolutely does not appreciate it, especially since he still hasn’t recovered from being within mere centimeters of Harry’s mouth.
"Well, we have to unshrink stuff, and move it, and assemble it all, and I'm too tired for that," I replied lazily.
I grabbed one of his legs and threw it over my shoulder.  As a last thought, I summoned ropes and bound his hands together above his head, tied to the headboard.  I looked at him and leaned down and whispered, "you sexy little bastard" before slamming into him.  He shouted and moaned.
The next day Harry saunters into Draco’s class confidently, hoping beyond hope that his prank will work and his moderate charms abilities will come through for him.
Because now, there’s a permanent image of striking green eyes staring curiously at me. I can’t even fathom what would cause Potter to look at me the way he is right now: indescribably confused. I feel him boring a hole in the back of my head, as if laser beams are the result of his staring.
"I- I just- you were whimpering and I heard your cries as I walked past your bedroom.  I knocked to see if you were alright but you didn't answer, so I just came in and woke you up."
"Oh dear. Is it Lavendar Brown? I swear Ronald I can support you being with ANYONE but her," Ginny burst out.
Draco was on his 3rd shot.  I could tell he was trying to look like he was a heavyweight, but it wasn't working very well.
The boys have gotten to know each other very well, and every day they fall deeper and deeper in love.
Harry beams.  “Thank you so much, Professor.  I would never have considered teaching if you hadn’t reached out.  Hogwarts is my home, it really is, and I’m so glad to be back.”
When I look at him, he only holds up one finger, finishes the page, and then takes his hand off mine.
Fall is approaching, after all, and there’s a much larger homeless population in Muggle London than in the Wizarding World.
"Uhhhh... no- I- I think there's another-" but I was shut up my Draco's lips clumsily smashed against mine.  I instantly kissed him back, not hesitating to wrap my arms around his neck.
With a look of sadness in her eyes, she told me, "We broke up about a year after the war.  Turns out, women aren't his type."
"Hey.  I brought you some soup.  And here-" I uncorked the hangover potion, "-drink this.  It'll make you feel better."  I brought it to his lips and he parted them enough to drink.  He was still basically asleep.  He looked like an angel.
"Well then who is it?  I promise I won't tell.  I doubt I'll even remember in the morning," he hiccuped.
I realized my palms were sweaty and my legs were shaking. I couldn't believe how weird Potter made me feel. Not just physically too, like mentally he just makes me freeze. That's how annoying he is.
Most of the time it’s manageable, with a modified Cheering Charm once a day, but sometimes it gets so out of hand he can’t even get out of bed.
He smiles to himself and grabs a towel, clothes, and his book before exiting his apartment in a hurry.
And suddenly Draco remembers he’s being chased by a naked Harry Potter, and that spurs him into action.
Dean and Seamus are hosting a beach picnic with French sandwiches, champagne, and watermelon out the wazoo, and Harry can’t help but lean his head on the shoulder of the blonde boy next to him.
With that, she left my room, closing the door.  I got up and put on some jeans and my hiking boots (they're warm in the winter and have good grip), and a plain black shirt.
“Alright class, once you’ve added the final ingredients, you’ve got to stir the whole potion twelve times in a counterclockwise motion.
“The problem isn’t me, its you!  You just do what and who you want and you don’t think about me!”  When did this become about Harry?
But with this ring, I promise to do my absolute best to make you happy every day that we’re together, and I promise to put effort into a real relationship with you.”
Draco rolls his eyes but it’s only to disguise the way his heart just leaped at Harry calling him ‘love’, even if it was sarcastically.
That’s where he, Fleur, Krum, and Cedric met after their names had all been pulled from the Goblet of Fire!
They all nod in agreement and mount their brooms. Draco, Ginny, and Seamus are on one team, while Harry, Dean and Ron are on the other.
He’s drawn back to reality when he hears keys jiggle in the lock.  Draco’s back.  And from the sounds of it, he’s not alone.  Damn.
Malfoy walks behind all the teachers as they begin to rise from the table too, and disappears through a door in the left corner of the Great Hall.
He pretends not to notice Harry’s blush or the way his hands are like warm stones in his own slender, cold fingers.
This time, when he enters, Potter is nowhere to be found, and he can’t determine if the flutter in his abdomen is relief or disappointment.
"Me too." Draco paused before continuing, "Why don't we get a drink?  Unless of course, you don't drink."
“That’ll be £4.17, are you paying with cash or-” Draco abruptly stops speaking, causing the man across from him to look up.
When Draco pulls away, Harry’s eyes have lit up like the night sky, and he knows he’s way too far gone for this dark-haired boy in front of him.
"Oh," I said quietly, walking into the kitchen with them to pour myself a glass of orange juice, feeling foolish.  "Then what's he doing here this late at night?  And while we're on that topic, why is he here?"
He rolls his eyes again, this time adding a short chuckle. My knees are weak and I’m sitting down. Merlin.
The blue speckles in it suggest that it’s grown moldy, and he doesn’t manicure his hands every week just to ruin it with moldy clay.
“Oh, my aunt and uncle were very anti-magic, and so when I did stuff like that, they just got angry and locked me in my cupboard without explaining anything.”
Unfortunately, balance does not seem to be one of Harry’s fortés because he sways to the side and pitches into Draco, who has to drop his measuring tape and catch him.
There’s also a stupidly sweet card, cat cufflinks that match the actual two cats they have together, and a Weasley sweater in dark green with a large grey ‘D’ on it.
I pulled his briefs down a little harder than I meant but he groaned too.  Then i made him lay down again and i pressed my body on top of his, us making out.  My hand crept down to his cock and i wrapped my whole hand around it before squeezing light and hard.  I summoned some lube and doused my hand and his in it before we both pumped up and down on each others dicks.
He simply pushes past Draco - an easy feat as he hasn’t eaten since the beach - and closes the door behind him.
I walked up the steps of the house, awed by the size comparison. Malfoy Manor was massive, but this house was moedrately sized. Still fairly large, but drastically smaller in comaprison to the Manor.
So instead of talking, he just gets a sponge and returns to kneel in front of Draco, cautiously reaching out to wipe the clay off his face.
“You know, I could tell her what you did,” Harry mutters in his general direction, shoveling chicken into his mouth.
“I don’t know!”  Harry says exasperatedly.  He huffs and takes his eggs back to his bedroom, leaving a very confused and disappointed Draco at the kitchen counter drinking cold coffee.
If someone had told Draco at the beginning of the year that he’d be giggling like a schoolgirl next to a near-naked Harry Potter, he’d have told them exactly where to place a sharp stick.
He doesn't feel the waves hitting his ankles, or the sand between his toes, or the salty ocean breeze.
Harry tosses over the candy and gives him a small nod, heading to the Great Hall to escape this awkwardness.
We are striving for inter-house unity and breaking the standards set by our predecessors to be stronger as a whole.
"Draco, I-" He sighed.  "Yesterday was one of the best days I've had in years.  I didn't think about the war or my scars once, you know that?  I didn't stress and I wasn't anxious.  Being with you at the store and teasing you... It just felt- feels- so natural.  I constantly wanna hold your hand and... last night, after we, ya know-"
See, he needs to potion to turn into a cauldron as soon as the potion is completed to have the greatest effect, but that requires knowing what the final step is and hoping that the potion-maker will correctly brew the potion.
That’s why he isn’t suspecting a thing when he steps under the hot water in the shower that evening.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione are standing on the dance floor, bopping in time to the music, when Ron suggests that Harry go dance with someone.
However, it’s unusual for anyone to come into the store at nine on a Monday morning, so when the bells above the door chimes he’s surprised.
Draco stretches his arm out and wraps his fingers around the snitch an instant before Harry can and pulls up, narrowly avoiding the ground.
At about 10 am, Gwaine screeches for breakfast, and Draco knows he should oblige the bird before he tears out both boys' eyes. He tries to wiggle himself out of Harry’s grip gently but doesn’t do a very good job, because suddenly Harry’s eyes are open and Draco is wishing he hadn’t moved at all.
Of course, after he learns the theory of the charm work, he has to practice, except that would require brewing Amortentia, and he really doesn’t want to do that.
"Ah, well, you've got to come back sometime. If you've got to go that's alright, Draco should be home soon anyways."
Well, until we finished apparating.  But for the four seconds we held hands, I was in heaven.  And I hated it.  Why was Harry- no, Potter- making me feel this way?  As much as I loved the feeling, I couldn't give in.
“Why are you all laughing at me!  This isn’t funny!  I don’t like my roommate dating other people and I need to figure out why!”
Here,” he says, taking Harry’s hands in his own and guiding his arms out to where they’re supposed to be.
Before he can think much more, he leans in and presses his lips clumsily against Draco’s, surprising him.  But not for long, because Draco wraps his arms around Harry and pulls him in closer, making the kiss ever so softly.
"I'm gonna go get us some food and you a hangover potion, okay?  I'll be right back," I spoke softly into his ear.  He gently nodded, still mostly asleep.  "Sleep well, baby."
I rolled my eyes.  "Of course you didn't.  You just wanted one night of good sex and then to blow me off.  I get it.  I've done that before.  Just didn't think you'd do it to me after the day we had, but whatever."
Harry is a bit surprised that Malfoy of all people wants to be courteous, but he’s willing to agree if it’ll make his life easier.
He looked at me and raised one eyebrow.  So maybe I was grateful that he woke me up, but I wasn't about to divulge my life story.  After a few moments of my silence, Harry got up and headed for my door.
For a while, he thought maybe it was because Draco was getting dates and Harry was single.  But Harry also dated people and the feeling was still there, so he ruled that off the list. Now he has a worse suspicious which sets his gut churning.
Glancing around, I noticed some natural light, following it to the source and discovering that the place did, in fact, have windows.  I pulled down the curtain and watched the cloud of dust
Later that night, Harry is pacing in the small living room of the flat he shares with his three cats.
Please remind students that he is not giving out autographs,” she says, with a quick warning glance at Harry.
"What are you doing in my bedroom?" I asked defensively, trying not to let my voice display how vulnerable I felt.
"I would like to thank you too.  For years, you and my son were mortal enemies.  Draco just talked and talked about how much you two hated each other, but he told me how that day, in the Room of Requirement, you saved him.  When you could have left him to burn, you saved him.  What I did for you that day was out of a mother's love, and I'm so grateful for you, too.  So, thank you, Harry Potter."
An entire week of school has gone by with Potter as a teacher, and not a single thing has gone wrong yet.
Draco suspected, just maybe, that it was a date, but he knew for sure when Harry showed up at his work at 5:30 on the dot looking nicer than usual.
“In the ocean, you told me you have feelings for me and I lied, I said I didn’t have feelings for you.
Ron teasingly glared at his girlfriend for announcing it before he could, but she apologized and they kissed.
"No.  I don't wanna hear your dumb excuses.  This whole thing was a mistake anyway.  Don't count on seeing me anymore."
"Harry dear, I'm extremely busy tomorrow with some previous commitments that I entirely forgot about, so I can't take you shopping."
The cream exterior with dark wood accents gave it a very half-timber style, and the green lawn and assortment of flora and fauna, dusted with snow, made the house feel like a very large cottage. It was homey to say the least.
"Stop," I told him, pulling away.  I sat back a little bit.  "I want you to lay down, your head near me, back down.  Start jerking yourself off and mouth fuck me.  Now."
He wanders to the bathroom and looks at himself in the mirror. He looks rather terrible, so he splashes cool water on his face and attempts to make himself look a bit better. It doesn’t work.
Draco is thinking about arguing, but honestly, it’s Harry, and he’s gotten away with some wild shit. So, “Alright, that sounds good.”
Antidepressants work to help your body hang on to that serotonin for longer amounts of time, like neurotypical brains do.
It’s also the most unique, with an inner layout similar to that of The Burrow, only about ten times bigger.
Draco measures Harry’s wingspan, shoulder-to-arm length, height, hip-to-leg length, being careful to write down the measurements exactly as he takes them.
They’ve fallen head over heels for each other but don’t think the other actually likes them, so they only see each other for the weekly group dates.
By now it was around 22:00.  Draco was still asleep.  His breathing was slightly uneven, but in a pattern.  It was so relaxing.  My arms were around him and I could feeling the steady rising and falling of his chest.  I was just breathing in the scent of him, trying not to let my mind wander.  it wasn't working.
"Hey, this is where you stood up for Potter in second year.  I called it, didn't I?  He got himself a girlfriend," I said with a bittersweet chuckle.
I rolled my eyes.  "Seriously, dumbass, just do it.  No need to make this weirder than it already it is."
His arms dropped to his side and I breathed slightly on his neck while turning and walking to pick up my wand and levitate the bookcase back together.  "Guess we didn't assemble this very well huh?  I don't know about you but I'm using magic from here on out."
Fortunately - or unfortunately, depending on your stance - the towel falls into position covering Harry’s waist, making it only slightly less awkward when Draco lands on top of him.
Now either you’ve got to prank me back, or you’ve got to declare an end to this so I can stop checking my pillows for curses every night.”
Draco frowns, confused until he turns it around and sees what’s written on it. The words surrounding a very grumpy cat face read,
He turns hastily pulls the other fabrics off of Harry, throwing them over his shoulder, and sets the bolt in Harry’s outstretched arms.
"I must get on with my day, but I feel such relief in talking to you and thanking  you.  Goodbye Harry."
While she took my measurements and we looked at fabrics, we talked about my mother and current events and my Auror training.
Draco stands on the porch of the shoppe for a while after Harry leaves, just thinking and enjoying the fresh air.
It’s a miracle you’ve survived as long as you have,” Draco says, hoisting the squirming Harry back up onto the podium.
Draco imagines that oven-bake clay from first year Transfiguration doesn’t count, so he shakes his head, trying very hard to calm the quell in his chest.
I er- made you this… for today. Thought maybe you’d like a set for the winter or something,” Harry says, producing a maroon and silver hat and scarf set from inside his coat.
Draco has turned back around, adding ingredients and stirring and casting spells as the class watches on raptly, taking notes.
Unfortunately, Harry has never been particularly concerned for his own well-being, given the five times he’s successfully defeated Voldemort and the innumerable amount of near-death experiences that go along with it, so what happens next isn’t surprising in the slightest.
Harry waits for a few seconds… then a minute… then two minutes… then he knocks again and waits again, still to no avail.
Harry scrambles to follow him so he doesn’t get lost, admiring Malfoy’s confident but relaxed strides.
So, while I might be disappointed by the fact that Harry left without saying goodbye, the feeling is overwhelmed by my excitement at the thought of having his number.
He looked me dead in the eyes, widening his legs and said, "Fuck me harder than you've ever fucked before, daddy."
"Yes mum, I'm in the kitchen!" I called back to her.  We moved out of the Malfoy Manor about six months after the war ended.  Partly because we din't need that much space but mostly because it reminded us too much of the horrors that had gone on there.
Groaning and rolling out of bed, he slides his pajama pants on and runs his fingers through his hair.  He tentatively opens the bedroom door and peaks out to find the kitchen and living room empty, to his great relief.
He’s about to respond, but Draco’s coworker comes out and fixes the machine, and then it’s time to pay.
“Remind me why we’re planning this the night before it’s supposed to happen?” Draco sighs, leaning back and looking up at the ceiling.
He didn't need to tell me twice.  I pulled out and positioned my hard cock that was dripping with precum.  I slowly started to push in.  it took a minute, but I was all the way inside him.  I almost came just at the feeling of his tight walls around me.
However, I distinctly remember leaving you in the guest bedroom but I woke up this morning and you were octopussing me, so there’s that,” he teases lightly.
Draco started to stir and I figured he'd wake up soon.  I had to get out of here.  No way I was sticking around for him to let me down with "this was a one-time thing" or "I don't wanna be with you".
Draco watches the man’s strikingly green eyes sweep the colorfully organized shoppe as he responds, “To buy if that’s alright.”
"You sexy bastard," I whispered into his ear before biting his earlobe and tugging slightly.  I sucked another mark just below his ear before making out with him again.
Draco seems excited to spend more time with him, which is odd, but he’s not gonna complain. “No, yeah, that’s great!
“But I am going to need a suit to go to the wedding, so if you want a date you’re better get cracking.”
“Malfoy, we’ve sat beside each other for a week of dinners with nothing more than a small grunt of acknowledgment.
Harry pauses with his hand on the doorknob.  What if this isn’t the right idea?  What if he’s wrong about Draco, wrong about everything?
Harry didn’t want anything special for his 23rd birthday, only to be with his two best mates in the whole world.
"Good idea," Harry agreed.  I glanced over to see that he had collapsed on the dark blue couch we'd assembled over an hour ago, when I noticed his shirt.  It was mine that I was looking for earlier.  He must've taken it on accident.
“I don’t want meals to be unpleasant for the next nine months, so get over your weird fear of talking to me.”
That's actually a very accurate description of his personality, considering he just woke up and it's one in the afternoon.
A few weeks later, at the Ministry of Magic, I was headed to class where I'd study to become a Hogwarts Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. I'd been studying all night for my end of semester exam, and after this I'd be home for Christmas.
Draco quickly went from stunned to his usual sarcastic self while I stood there, floundering for something to say.
“You know, I was really set on this turquoise, but midnight blue suits you very well too…” Draco says for the umpteenth time that morning.
“Erm- yeah, I am.  I just wanted to say sorry, about this morning.  I didn’t know why I was so upset, and now I do, and I think you do too- wait, no.  You don’t know why I was upset, but you will.  I meant-”
Everything is ready, so Draco goes back out and sits down anxiously while Ron persuades Harry to get out of his bedroom.  It feels like ages until he hears footsteps coming down the hall, his heart racing.
Yes, he’s definitely smelling the Amortentia and its infinite different enticing smells: treacle tart, the locker rooms after a quidditch game, wet wood, books and ink, blueberry pancakes… all of it adding up to one distinct yet indescribably scent.
"You think I could get someone smart to date me?  I'm the most blind idiot on this planet," I chuckled.
"Makes sense. If you make it, do let me know. I'd love to hear about your career as I had once considered becoming a transfiguration professor myself!"
I unzipped a small resuable bag and held it out to him.  "Put everything in here and we'll apparate back to your place."
The shimmering purple is almost holographic, changing color depending on the angle in which it’s viewed, and captivating Draco.
When Harry turns around into the arms of a man slightly shorter than him with striking blonde hair and starts to grind against him, he thinks nothing of it.
He could do this with his eyes closed, but an excuse to be closer to Draco is something he’s not going to give up.
McGonagall sends Draco a questioning look and Draco just shrugs, not ready to be lectured twice in one week.
"You could've gotten us killed!  We almost were!  Don't you think before you apparate?"  I fussed, trying to keep my voice down as people were looking at us funny.
Draco recommends products, makes sarcastic remarks, and and graciously accepts the coffee and/or lunch.
The moment I opened the window, the owl swooped in, did a lap around my apartment, and came back and landed on my outstretched arm.
"Oh come off it Draco, I am not in a relationship with him," Narcissa said, rolling her eyes. But Draco and I exchanged a quick glance, knowing that not what he was talking about. "I mean,
He looks around but the raven-haired boy is nowhere to be found, so his heart is racing for nothing.
I put extra effort into my appearance for god knows what reason.  I combed my hair but didn't slick it back.  I put on tight black ripped jeans that framed my arse and a loose green t-shirt.  After brushing my teeth I checked the time.  Harry would be there by now.  I'd better get over there and help him.
Ron must see the confusion written on Harry’s face because he says, “Repeat what you just said but slower.”
They stand there awkwardly, Harry looking at how much Malfoy has changed until he clears his throat.
I raised an eyebrow.  Willingly spending more time with me?  Why was I so excited?  "Alright then, lets grab a drink.  But only if you agree to call me by my name.  My first name."  Then I threw in, "for your mother's sake, of course."
"Draco!" I shouted, pulling him out of the way and onto the sidewalk with me, then holding him tightly in my arms for a moment.  He tensed, and I realized what kind of position we were in, so I quickly let go and turned to teasing to get over the extremely awkward moment.
Are you offering me breakfast?” Harry looks hopeful and confused, which further messes with Draco’s mind.
“Teachers, I would like to have a short meeting with you in the staff hall before we all prepare for tomorrow.”
I got to Grimmauld Place and carefully opened the door, relieved when no burning gasses erupted in my face.  So I took a deep breath and walked in, carefully walking around the place.  The floors were a light wood color now that the potion had broken it down, and they were ready to be stained.  The wallpaper had come off and so you could just see the bare walls, which would need painting but it could be done.
He leans in and puts his hand around the back of Draco’s neck, kissing his lips so passionately that he thinks he might never feel this way again. Draco kisses him back, surprisingly, and it takes Ginny smacking them upside the head playfully for them to separate.
It seems bigger than it had the last time Harry had been inside, though that could just be his imagination.  Looking around the circle, he finds familiar faces - Flitwick, Malfoy, Neville, McGonagall - and some unfamiliar faces.
"Alright then, Draco," Harry continued, obviously unused to saying my first name. "I can stay somewhere else if you want.  Narcissa just thought it best for me to stay here because she's helping me with the house and it made sense."
Harry shakes all thoughts of Draco Malfoy out of his mind and focuses on sketching his next commission.
Neville speaks up, stifling his own chuckles.  “Well, if he brought home women would you feel the same way?”
He’s been in love with him for years now, although it took him most of those years to even realize it.
Draco looks at the dusty, clay-splattered stool and then at his tailored slacks and cocks an eyebrow.
The captain is telling us that we’re beginning our decent and we all need to buckle up, so I rub my eyes and shake the sleeping man beside me.
Harry laughs so hard he inhales a bit of muffin and falls into a coughing fit, only recovering after Draco pounds his fist on his back a couple of times.
He looked up at me desperately and said "Daddy.  You're my daddy.  Please don't stop fucking me daddy oh god I wanna cum!"
That’s how Harry and Draco end up sitting on the couch in Draco’s apartment on Friday night planning the party.
Harry harrumphs and plops down into the chair across from Draco, running a hand through his wind-swept hair.
When I realize what I did, I stiffen, hoping Harry won’t notice, but the raven-haired boy on my shoulder only smiles wider.
The group glances at each other, hoping that whatever Luna’s doing brings Harry back out of this stupor.
"Hmmmm," he looked very thoughtful before his eyes lit up.  "Oh!  Do you have a-" he leaned in and whispered this part, his minty and alcohol stained breath getting me high, "-crush?"
I walked into my apartment with a bounce in my step, tossing my keys into a bowl. I was greeted by my Shi Tzu, Mocha. Reaching down to pet him, I noticed an owl on the windowsill. I didn't recognize the owl so I grabbed some treats off the bowl on the counter and headed over.
“Since the wedding is butterfly-themed, I figured- Harry?” Draco turned around to find that Harry was not, in fact, following him like he’d hoped.
"Thank you, I may do that later, but I'd agreed to hang out with Ginny, Ron and Hermione this morning. I'm going to go get ready!"
Tonight at the feast I’ll announce your position to the students.  I’m sure they’ll respond quite positively to have you teaching them.”
He gets dressed and heads to the great hall for breakfast, all the while hair falls off his head, leaving a trail behind him.
When he first opens his eyes, he thinks it's a weird-looking black cat, but upon closer inspection, he realizes that it's hair.
Draco is gay. He always brings home men, and although they’ve never actually spoken about it, its generally acknowledged that he is gay.  Harry is straight, though he’s tried to be as casual and supportive as possible.  But ever since Draco started bringing back men to hookup with, Harry’s discomfort has intensified.
"Zabini?  No way man.  No offense but he's not my type.  Also isn't he straight?  The guy I like is gay too."
When. Did you learn how to use the two brain cells bouncing around that thick skull of yours?” Draco teases.
“Let me- let me get you a- oh god, Draco-” Harry says, standing up to get Draco a sponge to wipe off his face.
Draco responds by putting his hand on Harry’s face, smearing the cold, wet clay across his cheek affectionately.
"You must've grabbed it when you left my room last night-"  I started.  Then I stopped and my face fell.  I turned to walk back over to the bookcase but Harry grabbed my hand to stop me.
"-I was wondering if you would be willing to have Draco take you shopping?  I know you really don't want to but I seriously think it'll be good for you two to spend enough time together so that you don't hate each other's guts.  I mean, you're adults now.  Be civil, at least."
A million things are running through Draco’s mind, questions of how he’s going to get through this, what happens when Harry does recognize him, who does he think he is?
When we got back to my place and started unpacking everything, I realized how much assembly we had to do.
?!  Harry Potter, my school enemy, and he's standing in my kitchen with my mother at 21:00.  Oh god.
He checks the hallways, then remembers he’s a Professor and can do what he likes, so he casually opens the door to the baths, feeling important.
“Sorry, my bad!” Harry exclaims, looking up to see who he accosted and locking eyes with none other than Draco Malfoy.
Malfoy is laughing so hard that it takes him a solid thirty seconds to recover enough to get out the words, “I’m flattered that you’d accuse me.”
Drunk Harry is heading down a dimly lit hallway which (hopefully) leads to the bathrooms when he collides with a boney being, bouncing off of them and into the color-changing walls.
In fact, he almost seemed like he was flirting with Harry. Which can’t be right, of course, because last he checked they were only
"I'm really sorry to interrupt your day, but... well... I just wanted to thank you.  For- for saving my life that day in the forest.  You could've revealed that I was still alive, especially since you knew Malf- Draco was alive.  But you didn't.  You risked it all out of honor and who knows why else, but I owe my life to you and am so deeply grateful for you.  So, thank you."  Harry stood there for a moment, wondering where those words had come from, when he realized that she wouldn't respond.  So he nodded his head once and turned to walk away when she grabbed his wrist.
Unfortunately, Draco walks faster than Harry thought because he’s turned around before he’s quite finished and Harry has to lower his wand prematurely.
"Well, he's been extremely flirtatious with me recently, although I'm almost 100% sure he hates me."  I sighed.
Daddy said that it’s impossible for them to be dark because I surround myself with such great people.
Draco starts, knocking the vase off of its shelf and fumbling once, twice, three times before catching it again.
Harry discovers that Draco also suffers from PTSD and depression, and that’s why he was out those few days.
Do I want to be more with him?  I don't know.  It's hard for me to forget all the years of bullying, but he's honestly really cute.  Rude and snarky, sure, but also sweet and protective and strong-willed.
“Yeah I get it, you were caught in the mouth of whatever man you brought home this time.”  It comes out a bit sharper than Harry intended.
When he pushes the door open, Draco looks up and meets Harry’s eyes and instantly he feels himself smiling.
If you give me a minute, I can get you sorted out,” the man says, standing from his workstation and cleaning up.
Draco knows he shouldn’t return to the shop the next morning, but his body defies his wishes and takes him straight back to that peeling doorstep and rickety sign.
Harry shuts off the faucet and hurries back to his bedroom in time to close his door as his roommate opens the front door.  An emotion that he can’t quite pinpoint surges through his body and his heart falls into the pit of his stomach.  Why does this happen?
When Harry walks to the register and is helped by the person he remembers to be Pris, he finds himself mildly disappointed.
Potter jumped a little when I shouted, but moved back out into the hallway, muttering under his breath.  But he didn't close the door and leave, like I was hoping he would. He just stood there.
With party rooms, private rooms, gambling tables, the main dance area, a restaurant, a stage for live bands and karaoke, and way more alcohol than is probably legal, Harrow Heights has made a name for itself.
I took the soup and one potion up to Draco's room after throwing my clothes on my bed.  I gently pushed the door open.  Thank god he was still asleep.
"God no. That bitch couldn't pry Ron from my cold dead arms," Hermione muttered, then looked up and put her hands over her mouth.
“I have hope for this year and for our goal of encouraging inter-house unity to end negative stereotypes within our school.
Apparently, that was an unexpected action, as Draco’s hands slip beneath Harry’s and a chunk of very wet clay comes hurtling off of the wheel and towards both of their faces.
I spend the next two-and-a-half hours pondering my existence, reading, and trying to ignore the raven-haired boy to my right. This sounds easier than it is, because Potter starts bothering me.
He’s just begun scrambling a couple eggs over the stove when he hears the notorious creak of Draco’s bedroom door opening.  Shit.
"Good afternoon dear, what may I help you with?" As it wasn't really back-to-school season, Madam Malkin spent most of her time in this store instead of across the street.  She was an old family friend and didn't really care about my past.
We actually have real things to learn, unlike your students which you obviously afford to leave alone.”
“You all made bets on who my boyfriend was and I didn’t want to lose because I didn’t have one, so I desperately asked Draco to pretend to be my boyfriend for the night.
Harry turned to face Narcissa and felt himself being pulled into an awkward but genuine hug.  He hugged her back and when they pulled apart, he saw a tear slip down her face.
Draco only sees the ravens-nest hair out of the corner of his eye, but he instantly knows who it belongs to.
He watches Draco’s expression fly from confused to suspicious to wary and back to confused again, ending with slightly pink cheeks as he thanks Harry and hurries down the hall.
Once I was in my room again, I decided to tidy up.  I picked up the bedding that had been thrown around and put the lube back in the drawer.
Draco doesn’t pull away, and Harry takes that as a sign to continue gently rubbing off the hardening gray substance.
I figured my mum had had a long day at the Ministry so I offered to make dinner.  I did steak and mashed potatoes with green beans because its filling and relaxing on this winter day.
I woke up that morning and, after being confused for a moment about where I was, headed downstairs. I walked past Draco's rooms to get there and remembered waking him up last night after I heard him whimpering and muttering. I hoped he wouldn't make thing awkward this morning. Or, more awkward than they already would be.
Harry’s head is spinning with all sorts of other memories and hints that he should’ve picked up on.  But the biggest question he has is, “Does he have feelings for me too?”
He curiously runs his fingers through Harry’s hair, feeling how it’s strangely soft despite looking like a bird's nest.
He bids the woman goodbye, thanking her for helping, and makes the executive decision to cast a (mildly illegal) tracking spell.
"As for where I live, I've moved into my Godfather's old place. Only thing is that I have to completely clean out the place, because its very... dark and unhappy feeling."
"Okay. Remember how Harry had something big to tell us? And then he came out as gay? Well, we still love and support him." After a moment of silence, he confirmed, "We do, right?" Everyone nodded their head in agreement, looks of confusion on our faces.
Draco’s hair remains gold and red for the entire rest of the day, causing some increasingly hilarious comments from students, but mainly from Harry.
My lips left his and trailed across his perfectly chiseled jaw and down his neck, alternating between kissing and biting and sucking his neck.  There were hickeys everywhere, of every size.  i could feel him shivering underneath me and his heavy breathing set me on fire.  Or maybe that was the Fireball from earlier.  Who knows.
"I thought so. Draco is the same way and I've noticed some of the little signs. I complete support you though."
Draco Malfoy is covered in clay, including his face, in a quaint little shoppe called Potter’s Place.
Every pair of eyes in the Great Hall for breakfast turns to him as he stops in front of where Harry is standing by the Gryffindor table.
As I passed the stairs I glanced down to the kitchen where I noticed some things on the counter.  So I walked downstairs in my shirt and briefs to see what it was.  The cold wood floor on my bare feet was surprisingly comforting.
“How did you get into the fashion industry?” Harry asks spontaneously while Draco is measuring his (very nice) arse.
Most of the clay has been removed, but Draco is looking at Harry with something in his eyes… something almost like… desire.
“I’ll be right back, I’m going to the loo,” Harry mumbles to Ron, sliding across the black leather seats and making his way across the main dance floor.
a million things Harry wants to - needs to - say to the boy in front of him, but he can’t find the words.
Draco discovers that Harry suffers from a hearty combination of PTSD and anxiety-fueled depression, and that’s why his hands shake so much.
Harry grins and teases Draco, but in the back of his mind, he can’t stop trying to remember where he’d smelled that scent before.
Draco visibly relaxes once Harry has left. So many thoughts are running through his mind, but the steady repetition of scanning items and bagging them for customers keeps him calm enough to get through the rest of the day.
Anyway, after that extremely awkward encounter, I went into my bedroom to start studying again. My internship at St. Mungos came with a catch: I could work there and get paid but I had to study whatver my host that week wanted me to.
The plant which accosted him seems to have grown out of its pot and intentionally blocked the doorway to assault customers.
Draco considers leaving for a moment, but then he remembers he’s on the verge of passing out from exhaustion so he sits on the couch across from Weasley.
“Wait- I mean- you don’t… have to…” I regret the words as soon as they leave my mouth - I’m regretting a lot of things today apparently - but Harry only blushes.
And he realizes he’s dropped the clay onto the floor, not the wheel, and Potter is kneeling next to him, asking if he’s okay, and-
The Malfoys had arrived by car, and sent the chauffeur away sometime in the evening. It had been their idea to observe all formalities before taking familiar liberties with the Potter’s floo. James guessed that argument was dead and buried now that the boys were married. He was smart enough to say nothing as he led the way to their family room. It held one of the larger fireplaces, capable of transporting six people at once. He walked slowly enough to make sure Draco was keeping up. His gut took a hit when he looked behind himself and saw their intertwined arms separate on the journey through the house. Harry reached for Draco’s hand, which swung aimlessly. He caught it. Draco did not pull away.
, which is phase two of taking back your power and training your mind to deliberately select, rather that wait for CNN, or your neighbor, to tell you what's real. Your mind is your Kingdom, don't let anyone else dictate what is and isn't possible for you. I was beaten, ridiculed, and held back in school in order to make me pay attention in class and stop daydreaming. All the adults thought they knew what love was, and what was best for me. Now, daydreaming and putting it in the form of fiction, is the happiest life I can imagine, and it actually pays me back. Can't say the same for math and science. So no, people don't necessarily know what the hell they're talking about when they throw the word 'love' around, or are making snap decisions about your life. Adults who are considered sane and rational, WILL punish children for doing what they came into this world to do. If you write, write the story that you're dying to read, that no one else has the nerve to write. Don't let anything hold you back. Something came up in my life and I had a reminder of how important it is, that my own imagination survived all that trauma. I spent years healing myself, and these playful fics are a testament to that victory. So thank you for reading and enjoying.
Severus put himself between Elan and James. “Let’s not get distracted. We were about to discuss the issue of helping Draco and Harry. I have arrived at a plan.”
“I have never had a reason to. We’re not proud of it. Dorea Black was Fleamont Potter’s cousin. That’s Harry’s grandfather.”
His clothes were dripping, hair plastered, and he gulped air to catch his breath. “No. Good,” he panted. He bent forward, hands on knees, as if recovering from a punch in the gut.
At first they listened politely, but they’d already tasted blood. The mistake of allowing this audience to see a glimpse of his real life, had them hungry for unexpected excitement. They were too riled up now, too anticipatory to settle for a schoolroom lecture. Draco’s appearance, his hurried flourish of action, his unguarded appeal to Harry, had captured their imaginations. His daughter clinging to him, had stolen the show.
The sight of Draco brought all of that to a halt. Whatever music had been playing, whatever waltz Harry had been dancing his way through life to, screeched to a violent stop, wrecking what had only a moment ago been the sound of delicious freedom.
Harry gave a slow and deliberate nod, and watched the booklet appear on the floor in front of him. So that’s how prisoners were fed in here.
“The war is over. It was always about victims, and Harry’s wand did as much to Death Eaters as we did to him. We have friends who did not survive Harry’s punishment, yet he is innocent and we are not? His child cannot be orphaned, yet a thousand Death Eaters, trapped in service to Voldemort, have lost theirs? He can take life, yet acts against him, are sacrilege? No, the only thing that separates Harry Potter from a Death Eater, is pedigree and popular opinion.
“I’m trying, I swear I am. Listen, everyone on the planet is like this, not just people in pictures. You want inside this picture, I’m explaining what separates dimensions. Everything that you could possibly want, represents a dimension that is waiting for you. If someone dies in your reality, only your belief bars you from interacting with them. They’re fine in their own awareness. Now, you want something. It’s out there in front of you, maybe only in your imagination. A desire. The very fact that it’s something you want and don’t have, puts it in a very specific dimension in relation to yours. Your feelings control that. Before I could talk to the deceased, I had to believe in my ability.”
Obediently, Harry picked one up and bit. He wasn’t sure if he was doing it right, judging by the way Draco looked at him.
“My daughter needs help more than I do. And if my magic is so strong, why didn’t it stop the curse? Or protect me?”
Her voice thickened with conviction. No longer thin and apologetic, she spoke with full knowledge of her authority and certainty.
His face struggled with some decision. Harry dared to touch his arm. “You think it’s too soon form me to feel love for you, but it’s not. I wouldn’t demand so much, if I didn’t love you already.”
Collin was a compact little man who’s spectacles shook to the end of his nose within seconds after pushing them up habitually. He had a short-clipped mustache and a distrustful glint in his eye that dared anyone to question how he became a mediwizard in Voldemort’s highest ranks, yet could not manage to cure his near-sightedness. Few people knew that his optical handicap was due to a curse that had blinded him ages ago. The eyes were transplants. Muggle transplants, and magically kept from being rejected by his immune system. Wizard eyes proved to be resistant to his magic and could not be fooled to take to him, especially when he had to kill their owners to get them. Unfortunately, it took a number of victims before he worked this out and found a suitable pair. The glasses also belonged to the dead victim.
“You know what I mean. Don’t be so unfeeling. Our son will never have another wedding night. He’s missing out on a great life because we brought this situation into our home. What have we doomed him to?”
Elan leaned around Severus to talk to James. “You must know that Severus cares very deeply for Harry.  It took years to recover from letting him go.”
Perhaps muggle jail was the last torment. He wanted Harry to come home, to make him feel like he had a home to come to. He hadn’t done a very good job of that. Maybe that’s why Harry’s life was tossing him like a leaf in the wind.
His voice floated like a feather, to the end of the note, and evaporated in the stillness that followed.
“Don’t worry, I won’t stay long. Just until you talk to me. I’ve learned some new tricks. I’m not that kid that you bullied into hating you anymore. And I also know that you’re alive. You’re fooling everyone. Even the Headmaster, who gave you her loyalty and her friendship.” He shook his head, letting the judgments against Snape pile up. “That’s okay, though. I know now that this is just your way of protecting everyone. That’s why I’m determined to talk to you, no matter what you think.”
He loved his wife. He was still unable to make love to her, a condition of his sentence in Azkaban that was taking its time wearing off, even after two years. At least the tremors were gone. And the nightmares. But all she seemed to need of him was his warmth, his weight, and his caresses, to reassure her that they were out of the prison and free in the sun. What he couldn't do with his body, he did with his magic. His hands made sure she knew how much he thought of her, and his mouth inspired her tears for different reason, that had nothing to do with the loss of her son.
“Mother, it isn’t what our vehicle does on the road, it’s what others are doing around us. You took away my ability to steer away from trouble. One does not drive one of those things without one’s instincts. As far as I’m concerned, your ignorance of muggle technology is a danger to everyone.”
"Technically, I will bash you over the head right now and take her, if you don't give her a decent name."
He felt for his wallet and her hand on his arm stopped him. “That was on the house. Few people come to me needing that kind of help. It was an honor.”
His father seemed to know that he wanted an answer to that question. “It’s just a preliminary, Harry. Draco’s paper work already provides proof that he’s been subjected to the same testing. His medical records are notarized for the purpose of this arrangement.”
Even in the dark, Harry’s eyes were bright as he smiled. “I thought we were past that. I feel like I’ve let go of so much weight. So much anger. All I want to do is make you feel good. I can’t wait to lick you down there.”
It got him the traction he needed, but his grip worked overtime to get him to the ledge of the next floor. By the time he pulled himself up, his fingertips were burning and his knuckles cramping. He threw his leg over onto the ledge. Stone bit into his knees and he eased his way into a standing position. He was here to clear the blocked view of the roof’s edge. The terrace was one of the few places where he could peer out farther than the eves extended. It had a roof, which was why he’d had to climb above it.
Harry rubbed his face, regretting such a spontaneous lie. “I was hoping you two could work together, not compete. If we stay there, you’ll be living together.” One of the pages caught his attention. He picked it up.
For Harry’s sake, he didn’t argue, but kept pointing at his watch between pointless commentary offered by Luna, and stale jokes offered by Ron. Thirty minutes later, their departure was then acceptable without causing offense. It was Luna who jumped up before Draco could beat her to it. “I’ll grab the baby for you. I want one more kiss.”
Snape could not catch his breath. When he saw the other wizard getting away, he compromised the desperation of his force and aimed enough impact to cripple without killing him. Unfortunately, he did want to kill him, and his magic factored that in. Instead of pushing Collin’s legs out from under him, the sculpted thrust lashed like a crazed punch and burst into Collin’s back, exiting out of the front of him. It left his organs intact, but crushed his spine and left his rib cage open and protruding through his skin like a human rack of chops. He had to smother Collin’s scream by withering his vocal chords. There were less painful ways of subduing him, but he wasn’t too bothered by the wizard’s discomfort. Not when he thought of what this person had done to Harry and Draco.
Instead of being insulted, Hermione’s thin arm slipped a drink to him through the bathroom door. “That’s the only one you get since you’re driving with her.” She also offered him the TV in her bedroom. “Thank you for trying. We’ll make it as painless as possible. I know this doesn’t come easy to you.”
When she was done, he had another Cherio around his neck. She made one for herself. “What I bring to our friendship, will also attempt to look out for you. My people will do what they can, but they can’t get too involved in your plight.” She’d added purple food coloring to hers and green to his, to playfully distinguish them from one another.
“No one would, unless they’ve been through what we’ve been through. I’m not scared anymore. Yeah, it’s wrong, what was done to us, but perfectly good people walk around with pussies all day everyday and never know the difference. They’re called women, and I refuse to be terrorized by the idea of having similar body parts, any longer. I’ve cried enough. That’s like grieving for a blind person, or any person with different abilities, when they’re able to get around just fine and live happier than you do, just because you think your way of life is the better way. It’s not compassion. It’s not loss. It’s ‘Oh my God, I’ve sunk to this level.’ Well, fuck it. The deck’s been reshuffled, we’re working with new cards. Either play the game or leave it. There is no giving this life back, so I’m playing it. You make me realize, I’d rather be happy with you, than too proud of my dick, to hold my head high. What’s crying gonna do, but waste my life and my time with my daughter? Life is now. Our sex life isn’t diminished. We thought it was, because we were so ashamed. That was the real weapon used against us, and we’ve nullified that. So yes, I want to go down on you.”
Ash wasn’t finished. “I’d bend you over your Bunsen burners and ride you till you begged for my forgiveness.”
Then it hit him. If Ladoria was the woman Jipsy worked for, whose name was Prince, then this woman was Snape’s mother. Eileen was Snape’s mother. He was looking at Snape before the age of one, sitting on her lap and probably teething or something.
Morell started forward. His face couldn’t hide the fact that he simply did not have Snape’s faith. He leaned out, looked both ways down the landing, then out over the railing. A big open square presented a drop-down view of all twelve levels of patient rooms, game rooms, therapy gyms, and visitor lounges. Stacked, right-angle stairs looked more like an apartment complex than a hospital. It was one of the nicer, newer wings, designed for low risk patients and the families who visited them. Morell had no family. As he leaned out the door and looked back at Severus, he gave pause. “It’s unusually quiet tonight. I like it.”
Daylight seared his vision. It sliced through his sight until shapes and patterns confirmed a beige hospital room with a city horizon. Edinburgh. Shit.
Severus could not hide his slip of patience. “This is a business call, Elan. Our personal life is of no concern to anyone here. We need not advertise our status.”
This gave Snape pause. “Fine, we’ll leave through the door.” He made a jabbing motion with his wand, summoning a holographic mist to surround them and reflect the environment around them. It wasn’t complete invisibility, but a very effective camouflage to non-magic eyes.
There was one in the crowd who disagreed. He wore oversized dark sunglasses and lingered on the edge of the mob forming. He had arrived, not by car, but by apparation.  He wore an ensemble of dark, drab layers, but his black leather boots were immaculate and shining. His hair, parted in the middle, swept from his temples in an aerodynamic flow past his shoulders. The little bit of skin showing on him, were the parts of his face above and below the dark glasses. Pale, unsmiling, and judging by the way he kept his arms folded as he watched the scene unfold, unimpressed with the spectacle.
Harry was torn between relief and seeing that his father had clearly upset Draco by calling him out in front of everyone. Maybe it wasn’t easy seeing your son treated as though he wasn’t good enough, no matter how fair you tried to be. With another wave of his wand, Draco’s written answer burned itself into the parchment before it glowed orange again and faded from the surface of the table.
His voice trailed off. Across from him, plastering the wall above the toilet and near the window, were faint red hand prints. They stamped over the beige paint as if Draco had found a way to walk on his hands with bleeding fingers. Some places were darker than others. A look at Draco’s hands revealed nothing, as they were immediately balled into fists. Draco jumped down and backed into the crevice between the shower and window.
Instead of answering, Draco brought his fists together and Harry remembered the superfist that landed him on his back in the room. He blocked it, baring his teeth and pressing down hard on Draco’s arms.
“What, fuck me? Of course. You can do it right now if you want.” He didn’t mean to sound so cavalier about it, but he was perfectly willing to give that up if Draco wanted it. It was less about ass and more about pride, anyway. He remembered times when he was so desperate to feel something, anything, that he let strangers do what they wanted and relied on the shock to make him feel human again. Then came the cycle of being appalled and disgusted with himself until he came home and buried his head in Draco’s arms and found comfort. With Draco’s body being what it was two years ago, with the distress he was already balancing, Harry couldn’t ask him to fuck him senseless, but he could be there when Draco needed to feel the same thing. Take him out of his head, distract him with something that felt good. That’s all either of them had wanted in those days.
“We shrink her clothes and place them in there. She has so many, and she outgrows them so fast. My mother just keeps shopping and sending things. It’s the perfect spot. When we want to dress her, we use an incantation to display what’s available, in front of the mirror in her room. It comes right through.”
“Or better,” a man behind her shouted. “Use your wand to show us what happened on that bloody train. No one’s been arrested and seventy-one people are dead. If you can show us bloody battles at Hogwarts, you can show the authorities some freaking clues.”
“Can we get you anything, Draco?” Lily sounded overwrought, as if she had a responsibility to fix Draco’s breakdown because it was happening in her home.
He took the liberty of kissing Draco’s head, and guiltily smelling the natural oils through his hair. He hated that it cost Draco this much, but this was where he wanted to be. This close. This needed. He couldn’t hope to get another word through to him, so he held him through the crest of his tidal wave. Both of them were swept away by it. All he could do was hang on. His kisses, around Draco’s head, grew more confident, and Draco grew more accepting of them.
His sense of alarm, said do something. But his sense of magic, said be careful, don’t blink or you’ll miss something special. He had no idea what was going on, and prodded Draco to wake up and witness it with him. He kicked a little too hard.
He cut himself on his real feelings. His parents had sold him. He was too old to feel like that, too versed in their traditions, so he dropped that thought like the sharp blade that it was. This was real. This was happening. Business or not, he’d failed to get rid of the secret hope that they loved him too much to make him go through with this. They’d just exchanged him for magic. He let that sink in while Harry begged him to talk.
A minute after Jipsy’s exit, the edge of a torn piece of paper appeared in her spot. It singed around the edges, telling him that it was printed with magic. It hovered a second, before falling onto the bed. He picked it up and saw the words ‘Arcanus-Detolae.’
Harry closed his eyes, regretting Lucius’s words for him. A threat could not be unmade, and something told him this wizard would not take it lightly.
“Draco. The CIUM told me that Snape isn’t dead. They confirmed it. But they can’t find him. If he’s alive, why does he have a Headmaster’s portrait at Hogwarts? The castle’s magic doesn’t lie.”
There was a point during the shower, when Harry waited outside the door. He listened to the spray. He imagined testing his luck, and joining Draco. Would that ruin everything? He didn’t even want sex. He just thought it would be a nice intro to each others bodies and the intimacy they were trying to develop.  Draco was weak and looked like he need the wall to stand up. He only wanted to be his support. And maybe test drive that beautiful head of white hair with a little shampoo. He knew he was channeling his inner sixteen year old girl, but hey, if you find yourself the owner of a brand new Masorati, why not take it for a spin? He was going to teach this guy to have fun again, if nothing else.
Yes, it was the perfect curse because, if touched properly, it rendered women overwhelmed and in tears at the loss of their bodily control. A man can retain control. Woe to the man cursed with such an appendage wired to the whole of his body. For the duration of contact, he would be nothing but a slave.
