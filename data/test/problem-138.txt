He was somewhat surprised that she hadn't already asked to move given everything that had happened to her in the master suite.
Nasty, magic twisting inside of it like a slime eel caught in the base of a bucket, the Dark Mark was aware.
"Cut my hand," Draco said, holding his wand hand out to Ivy. She stared, horrified. "Hurry! I don't have a knife, Ivy. We don't have long before... He'll come looking for me. For Mother!"
"That was your Wolf expressing its opinion." Harry wagged a finger at Remus. "So what's he think of that? Of me and my temper and my relatives? I do actually want to know."
"The only one in my bed was me," Percy huffed.
"Who's Remus Lupin and why's he trying to tear the wards down?" Harry asked.
Harry gulped, nerves nearly sending him right back out of the ritual circle again. It was going to hurt. He just knew it was going to hurt. They all looked way too nervous for it not to hurt like crazy.
"Are there other spells to open doors?" Harry whispered.
This was why the labyrinth existed on the grounds. This land had been sacred, once upon a time. Long before modern magi build the Manor, this ground had been holy ground. Draco started as he realized that no Malfoy had ever touched these rune circles.
To fix it, he had to have control of the Malfoy magics.
"Uh, figure out where you lot are going to sleep?" Harry said. His laugh was more rueful but just as shaky. "We're kind of out of spare bedrooms unless you want to sleep in the dungeons."
He slipped silently down the stairs, leaving Harry to sneak to the side doorway that they'd used to head upstairs earlier. Thankfully, lumos under the cloak still worked to light Harry's steps. Vern did an awesome job on the lawn because Harry didn't step in any mole holes or trip on any lumpy spots as he made his way to the labyrinth.
"I told you," Harry said much to Draco's amusement, "he's been Dumbledore way longer than Grindelwald. Might as well call him by that name."
"Silverclaw needed a little of my blood to fix the wards here," Harry murmured while resting his index finger on the edge. He could feel the sharpness of it. A tiny push and his skin would part, blood would flow. "I need blood for this?"
Harry cocked his head to the side as everyone nodded sadly. Even Dobby nodded though from the expression on his face, Dobby didn't agree with them. He was just nodding because all the humans were nodding.
Harry looked around the dingy little room. The only things he cared about were Hedwig and his trunk. Everything else in the bleak room was just there. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon hadn't allowed him very much stuff. They'd begrudged him the most basic things, honestly. So he didn't have very many things to pack.
The stubbornness that had gotten Harry through Uncle Vernon's beatings and Aunt Petunia screaming at him straightened Harry's back. The sheer determination not to yield that had let Harry deal with Dudley's Harry Hunting and the disapproving looks at school slowed his breathing.
Harry shook his head before putting the goblets back into their place. He shut that door on the credenza and then scooted over so that he could check the next one. Inside there were books. Draco frowned and joined Harry on the floor.
Harry bit his lip, staring at the very, very unimpressive Weasley tent. It was a pathetically small thing, plain white canvas that showed its age with raveling edges and stains along the grass line. At best, optimistically, it could hold two small children. Even Aunt Petunia would've hesitated to shove Harry into it. It was just that small and pathetic and ancient-looking.
"Yes," Draco said.
The sheer idea that you could fly so quickly through a ward that had been attenuated by passing through the earth wasn't something that Draco would have considered. He'd expected that they would fly cautiously until they reached the edge of the wards, test them, and cross if possible. Flying straight through at full speed?
This wasn't "Lady Magic".
And angry.
He flipped to the notes at the beginning of the sapphire blue book he'd been studying. There were notes on this one which looked like the person doing it had abandoned it after he'd been discovered. When Draco checked, none of the other books had similar notes on performing the ritual.
Their class had gotten a trip into London when Harry was eight. They'd been taken to the Guildhall Yard and shown around the looming historic buildings. His teacher had been as impressed as Harry, telling them all about the incredibly powerful people who lived and worked in the area. He'd all but said that there was not a hope in hell of Harry ever being worthy of so much as breathing the air here.
But then her loyalty to Mother had never, ever been in doubt.
"He should worry more about getting hit with another of those warped blessings," Harry commented to Draco who just patted his hands.
Thought he asked. Maybe he asked? He couldn't tell. He didn't even know who he was asking because there wasn't really anyone there. Just him and the warm, wonderful sea of magic stars that held and supported and flowed right through him.
He knew the moment he turned the last corner.
Draco shut his eyes and let himself drift off into sleep, the music of their soulbond humming around him with Harry's contentment.
It felt really wrong for anyone to be in the street right now. Super, incredibly wrong. Utterly and completely wrong. Harry bit his lip as he crept through the perfectly normal crowd sauntering through Hogsmeade's streets between the steeply peaked buildings that all seemed to lean just a little off true. He'd call it a perfectly normal day if the air didn't crackle with something really uncomfortable that no one else seemed to notice.
Draco was the first Malfoy heir to feel this in three generations.
Draco stared at Dobby. So did Harry.
"I've had a bad day," Harry protested as he took one of the roast chicken sandwiches to go with the half dozen biscuits he'd already eaten. "I can have dessert first."
He didn't dare say exactly what he was containing. Honestly, Draco was stunned that he'd been able to hold the Dark Lord's shade in with the journal. Or was part of his soul trapped in the journal? Draco didn't know, couldn't tell, and frankly didn't care as long as someone came to take it away soon.
"This is all the wards," Draco said as he reached out for and then clung to Moody's hands. "It's… it's just too much. Let's go. The sooner those monstrosities are gone, the sooner I can collapse and cope with… everything."
And his own, too.
The couple of hours Harry had gotten had clearly done a lovely job restoring him. He strode out of his bedroom and ran down the stairs as if he'd gotten a solid ten or twelve hours of sleep. Ivy shook her head, the image of Dobby at his most manic forming in their bond. Draco grinned and nodded. When Ivy offered her hand, Draco took it and let her pop him down to the kitchen where everyone else had gathered.
"Can we change the blessing so Dumbledore can't use it?" Harry asked.
Draco barked a laugh, patting Mother's hand when she squeezed his shoulder. "Oh, it's far more wide-spread than that, Potter. Dumbledore's abuse is spread right across the magical world. I suspect it goes back generations."
Weird. Maybe Silverclaw was good looking to goblins? Or maybe that one goblin was being inappropriate. Harry would have to ask Amal later if he knew what was going on with that.
"Sounds quite accurate to me," Draco said. "Hm. There's one here to bring the light of hope in to purify dark places. That… I wonder."
Still nothing.
Not that it mattered.
At least Draco got medical care when he needed it.
"What is it with you and birds, Potter?" Draco huffed. "That owl of yours is just as bad about grooming you."
"Did Remus rip Dumbledore's throat out?" Draco asked, blinking at the torch-blackened arches of the ceiling as he tried to sort out if that'd been real or imagined or some sort of magical allegory that he would have to study for the rest of his life and leave reams of notes for their heirs to figure out.
But Harry took a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and then looked down that dark stairwell with determination.
Getting Lord Black to the bank had taken Dobby and Silverclaw together going and submitting proof that Harry really was the heir to the Black family as well as the Potter family. They'd helped Arcturus Black back through the floo, not to the one in the lobby but one lower in the bank closer to the healers' caverns.
"Then can you get the warding team going on Malfoy Manor when you head back to the bank, Silverclaw?" Harry asked. "That would let Draco and Mrs. Malfoy work on the political side of things while we work on figuring out how to block this misapplied blessing of Dumbledore's."
"Yeah," Draco agreed.
The discussion was so far beyond Harry's understanding that he snitched a piece of paper and a quill so that he could write a letter to Ron. Silverclaw should be able to get it to Ron. Or at least to Ron's oldest brother Bill.
As Draco stalked closer, Father's eyes flew open and he screamed like an animal as the Dark Mark tortured him for daring to attempt to be free. Draco shoved his magic at the Mark, prompting the Dark Lord to do even more. Father convulsed on the bed, eyes blank as his screams took on that horrible animal tone that said he was lost to the pain, unaware of anything else.
The instant Draco set his head on Harry's shoulder, wrapped his arms around Harry's waist while Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, he felt better.
"Okay," Harry said as slowly as Draco had, "if Remus was officially family, could you do more to help him? I mean, like help him with the whole werewolf thing."
"I… right," Draco said while rubbing his blazing-hot cheeks. "Thank you, Ivy. We'll leave that alone. And be very cautious about any other books we find secreted away. Though if we've got any books hidden away about blessings and ancient religion and prayers, do please pull them out."
Draco winced and then started when Grandfather Arcturus gently patted his shoulder. "Ah. Well, they're likely still under the control spells. We can explain how to break free. Harry and I both managed it without the ritual. It's largely a matter of allowing your magic to break the spells while in a deep magical communion."
"Yeah, no kidding," Harry said with a little laugh that tried to go all hysterical on him. He bit his lip to stop himself from dissolving into tears or cursing or hiding under the covers. "I don't even know who or what I'm praying to."
Draco nodded. "Just us, then. We'll run them up to the Green suite, hide them in with the pornography."
Ivy sighed as she put the books away and then charmed the credenza so that neither of them could open it. Without effort. Draco could open it if he really wanted to. And Harry was creative and stubborn enough that he'd probably find a way to open if he were inspired to. But the thought definitely counted with something like that.
"Can carry them but you can set up the floo to allow messages to specific parties," Amal continued as if he hadn't been interrupted.
After all, weren't they supposed to handle mysterious magical things in the Department of Mysteries? It was their title. That just seemed like logic.
"No one outside Mother interacts with Vern," Draco explained. "Professor McGonagall won't recognize him. His magic is all wild and green with only a small thread of the Malfoy magic going through him. It's buried deep enough that he'll be virtually unidentifiable. Dobby radiates your magic now."
The team that Silverclaw summoned in had refused to work on Harry at Black Manor. Malfoy Manor was rejected as well. Justifiably, given that Draco had not had the time or the intelligence to ask to have all the dark magic staining the manor and the wards purged entirely. Yet. He did the instant he realized it needed to be done.
Goblins didn't make angry goose noises. They made sounds like gravel being crunched into smaller bits before being added to a cement mixer. Silverclaw's cursing had Harry hiding behind Amal and Dobby hiding behind Harry. It took quite a while before Silverclaw huffed and smoothed his hands over his very tightly braided hair.
They pulsed in waves, radiating Draco's prayer, his and Harry's prayer, out into the world. He couldn't tell how far it went. There was no way to know.
"Nah, it's not a suicide mission," Harry said, waving off Mrs. Malfoy's abortive reach for a hug. "It's a warning. He knows that I'm not where he wants me to be and he's decided to make it too scary for me to stay here by sending the big bad werewolf to bring me home again. Like that would work. I'm never going back to Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's place ever, ever again."
"What?" Harry frowned at Draco.
"We need a way to stop Dumbledore for good," Harry muttered.
Just the questions he'd asked had told Harry how terrible his life had been. There were wizards and witches whose whole job was to make sure magi kids were safe and well cared for (and how come they hadn't been told at Hogwarts that the term for wizarding folk in general was magi?) There were magi pediatricians (and Harry should have seen at least a Muggle pediatrician every year, preferably a magi pediatrician twice a year). Harry should have gotten vaccinated for dragon pox before going to school (and he shouldn't have been allowed in school without it by law).
"Master is so foolish!" Ivy exclaimed as she popped in next to him. "Mistress is sobbing she is so upset, and Master Arcturus will not stop cursing."
Harry's hands shook as he tried to breathe through the rage. There was so much. So many things that he really hadn't been paying attention to. He'd been outright desperate for anything that would let him stay in the Magical world so he'd kind of refused to even look at everything that made him twitchy about Dumbledore.
They grinned at each other as they held hands. The bond sang between them of excitement, anticipation, hope and fear, and so much determination that Harry couldn't figure out which of them was angrier about how he'd been treated.
Draco wasn't entirely sure.
"Dobby was told," Dobby whispered. He bit his lip. "He was told to keep the Great Harry Potter safe. Master laughed when he ordered Dobby, laughed and laughed, but still. Dobby was told to keep the Great Harry Potter safe."
Then each book had two facing pages that had a labyrinth that was an exact match to the one on the grounds. Then ten pages of prayers, one prayer per page, followed by the remaining blank pages.
"I just keep saying no, I won't stop, until I get somewhere," Harry said in a much meeker tone despite the pleased warmth coming through their bond.
Please. Please let me save Mother. Please let me save the Elves, the Manor. We can't let the Dark Lord control the Malfoy family!
"Would they tell him if a student or teacher was possessed?" Harry continued. "Or if someone let a troll in, for example? I mean, I can tell where everyone here is. Shouldn't he be able to tell exactly where everyone is at Hogwarts?"
Draco snorted. "She'd adore that."
"Take over the world," Harry said, startled. "Really? That's what Moony thinks?"
Sending waves of that meditation exercise down the bond to Harry quickly soothed the bond-rope until it wasn't quivering. Instead, it pulsed in time with Draco's heartbeat which had gone slow and languid as his arms and legs became weighted with sleep.
"I know," Harry said as he stomped over and flung himself onto the bench. "I know. I just. Would wards feel this soul anchor thing? I haven't figured out how to read what Potter Keep's wards are telling me yet."
Again.
He took a big swallow of his tea, shuddered and stared into the cup in horror. The second, wincing sip got a considering look and then he drank comfortably as his tongue was numb to it. That was how Father had always drunk it, but Draco just couldn't stomach that first gods-awful swallow. Sips worked better.
Harry's breath caught as the memories of being too little and Aunt Petunia refusing to give him shoes. His clothes had been as sloppy as Dobby's grubby pillowcase. Cold. He'd always been so cold. His feet had been cold, and he couldn't go anywhere outside without hurting his feet, and Aunt Petunia had hit him whenever he'd tried to ask for something warmer. Something better. Until Harry stopped asking and just suffered.
Tippy bit his lip and then nodded, taking the cloak in shaking hands when Harry and Draco slipped out from under it. He held it to his chest, tears welling up in his eyes. Then Tippy bowed to them very, very formally, the sort of bow that Grandpa Arcturus and Amal said was best used for rulers and meeting foreign dignitaries.
"Dobby didn't answer," Draco whispered.
Yes, Draco said through the bond. Yes, he could do this. He would do it.
He'd always gone to bed as soon as possible when Father had guests.
"Probably," Harry agreed with a grin against Draco's shoulder. "Still true."
Grandpa Arcturus laughed hollowly and nodded. "I agree, Harry. Let's go to the floo room and find out, shall we?"
Later, Harry's face said.
Across the ballroom that'd been turned into an impromptu library, Mrs. Malfoy was deep into three books at once, studying them and taking notes with a quill that wrote without her having to hold it. Amal was next to her, scribbling away on his notes while tugging at his hair as if whatever he'd chosen was completely confusing. Grandpa Arcturus had settled onto a couch that Cooper brought in. He looked utterly content to lounge there and read forever but he wasn't exactly turning pages. Harry thought he was asleep with his eyes open.
"Ivy wants that!" Ivy replied.
The blue phoenix screamed like the peacock she resembled.
"What?" Mother gasped and stared at Draco.
To Draco's surprise, Bill and Charlie exchanged surprised looks of comprehension. The twins, even more stunningly, started and turned to each other with awed grins. Huh. Apparently, most of the Weasley family had freed themselves.
"It's not the same as what you'd see in a squib or Muggle," Draco said. "Father used to rant about it. He claimed that it's a matter of the magic in a person's core being slightly out of alignment with their bodies. Mother always got this pinched look when he said it, so I doubt that's true. One of my distant cousins had the problem, though. There's a spell that they can do at Saint Mungo's that eases the problem for three to four years at a time."
Draco turned to Harry who bit his lip as he carefully unrolled the message and began to read.
Instead, he nodded to Dobby to follow them and then went through the floo with Amal.
"You are correct, Lord Malfoy," Silverclaw said. "Young Lord Potter-Black has already been to the bank for several important items he was lacking. Dobby is now his elf."
"Good," Harry said.
"I would be too if someone locked me in a room and didn't let me out," Harry said. Seemed quite reasonable to him to be angry.
Amal grinned. The grin faded as Fangtooth started chanting in the goblin's language Gobbledygook. A glow surrounded Lord Black, pale rose with hints of silver and green. Then it was shot through with emerald green, lemon yellow and celadon green at the same time that Fangtooth added Harry's blood. There was a deep tug at Harry's magic that he promptly encouraged, though, really, he hadn't realized that his magic had those specific colors.
"Already sent Mistress Kitty through," Professor McGonagall's elf Lilac said as she popped in. "Yous is all to hurry! Bad Dumbles is very mad. Very, very mad. He is using Fawkes even though Fawkes does not wishes to attack this place."
"Is Come and Go room." Tippy nodded firmly, ears up and mouth smiling along with his eyes now.
He hadn't been sure, deep inside, whether this would work. Yes, it should have. But when had Harry's luck ever been that good?
The stairs went down about four floors, jogged to the right about twenty feet through a brick-lined passageway, and then went down another four floors. There was a jog to the left through a secret passageway with stone instead of brick, and then down another two flights of stairs.
"Wait, rings?" Harry asked. "Plural?"
Draco recognized it. As soon as he saw that one, another appeared like a blotch of ink in the glowing night sky surrounding him. Then more, dozens, then hundreds, then thousands more.
Food (he should have had three to five times as much as he was getting), sleep (same), exercise (less, a lot less, and no household chores), stress (wow, just wow).
"No, we need to go to Potter Keep, Mother," Draco said. He hissed when she opened her mouth to protest. "No! We have to go. It's Dumbledore. Grindelwald, I suppose, but he's worn Dumbledore's name longer than his own by now. He'll break through the wards if we stay here. He'll disrupt the spell."
She smiled and pulled Draco into a hug that he melted into. Draco couldn't remember the last time Mother had hugged him. He must have been less than five or six. After that, as his magic started to settle, Father had taken over Draco's "education".
"Not without leaving a chink in the war wards that Dumbledore could go through," Draco said with a huff and narrowed eyes that promised hours upon hours of Draco lecturing him on wards and what they could and could not do.
Or right. Something was clearly going right. Draco had only the barest sense of what Harry was doing through their bond. There was so much wild magic surging through the wards that Draco simply couldn't keep track of what Harry did.
Through the wards, Draco felt Harry flop onto his face in the heart of the labyrinth. Draco collapsed next to the ward stone. It hummed and wrapped him in protective spells.
"It tapered off after he took over Hogwarts," Grandpa Arcturus said. "Though how he could have done that, I don't know. He's never had any power over the Book of Souls."
Glowing white gravel, no, stars, crunched under Harry's feet. He flipped his invisibility cloak around entirely, rendering it a regular cloak made of extraordinary fabric. Harry gasped as his steps began sending up showers of stars that drifted upwards like embers.
He pushed Harry into the dining room and then did the same for Grandpa Arcturus even though Grandpa Arcturus' eyebrows went way, way up and then he glared at Amal with magic sparkling in his eyes.
Harry lay still, squinting, as Draco flinched and hissed his way through loosening one hand. Only after those fingers were free and Harry's poor, misshapen hand flopped to the rubble did he yelp and let go of Draco's other hand.
This time, Professor McGonagall and Remus came up with him. When Aquila flamed in, cooing, Professor McGonagall laughed and gave her a good scritch under the chin and then behind Aquila's head despite the blue-white flames that flickered like a crest there.
Draco nodded. "Good. All right. Grandfather, where would Dumbledore be doing this ritual?"
"Ivy," Draco said to Ivy who popped in to properly bow to Draco even though she was outside the flames and thus not visible to Mr. Parkinson, "please help me choose a proper apology gift for Pansy and her mother. Something that will keep me from getting hexed."
"I know, Blue," Draco said. He breathed a ghost of a laugh, smiling as Blue's ears perked up and she stopped wringing her hands. "Honestly, I shouldn't be awake either. But Father."
In reach if Harry tried for it. If he was fast.
Draco could feel so much more of what the Goblins had done. There were wards and watching spells, monitors and message systems. Each vault door had a specific identity to it, one that Draco could see but not understand. Silverclaw's vault door, once they reached it after going through a maze of tunnels, stairs, and other vault doors, felt like it might just bite Draco.
She trilled again, rubbing her beak against Harry's hair, and then grooming him like he was a chick.
Maybe this would work?
"We should get the grownups," Draco said though he didn't move from the table and the slim little labyrinth prayer book.
Both of them bolted to their feet as the cell door opened. Harry hadn't even heard the cursing stop. It must have tapered off sometime during the hug. Professor McGonagall emerged with Grandpa Arcturus, both of them scowling.
He slapped his hands over his mouth because that came out way louder than it should have. Harry flipped the hood back and grinned.
If anyone had the capacity to think creatively enough to get around a locked, warded door so that they could attack Dumbledore in his lair, Harry and Dobby were the ones to do it. Just look at how they'd gotten into Hogwarts.
Draco frowned at her, biting his lip before visibly bracing himself. "If neither of you want the romance, why… have the affair?"
Draco's eyes went from pale blue to electric sapphire as he straightened up beside Harry. "What else could it be?"
He'd really hate it if he couldn't use the cloak anymore. Or at least if he couldn't use it until they brought Fake Dumbles down. It was one of the few things that Harry had that was a link to his family. To his parents. The thought that Fake Dumbles might've tainted that one thing from his father made Harry sick.
The stubborn blessings dissolved. Further off, far away from Malfoy Manor, more and more blessings unraveled like bonfires flaring up into the night. The sky went brighter and brighter until it was teal with bright gold stars spinning waltzes across the night.
"Father got regular reports from Snape about my behavior," Draco replied, still without opening his eyes. "Any time I showed behavior that wasn't properly Slytherin, by Father's definition of the term, Father would show up the next day to correct me."
Several bodies lying on the grass near the Whomping Willow. One had greying red hair. Another had Grandpa Arcturus' white streaked hair. And a third was shaking his head as he struggled to get to his feet, snarling, even as the magic rained lightning down on him.
"Yes," Draco agreed. He tugged at Harry, pale and shaking. "We have to go. The wards will keep him out but—"
"Uh, we've got less than thirty minutes," Harry said. His voice came out as a squeak and he didn't feel the least bit ashamed for that.
They popped him back to his bedroom on the far end of the family wing. Mother had insisted that Draco's suite be as far from theirs as possible. He understood why, now. The wards knew that she'd been raped repeatedly, that Father had forced himself on her over and over again to try and create another heir.
"It's the same," Draco said. "All the titles are the same."
He glanced at Harry who bit his lip and looked more than a little worried about people's reactions to it. Oddly, the biggest worry that he got from Harry wasn't Dumbledore or the teachers at Hogwarts. It was Ron and Hermione. Their faces were the ones hovering in Harry's mind's eye.
"I'd like it that way," Harry admitted.
Too much was at stake.
"…Master Draco cheats!" Dobby gasped, staring at Draco with his ears straight out and quivering with shock.
"Thank you," Harry said, smiling at Dobby. "If you need me, let me know. I'll… find a way to help somehow."
"What?" Harry asked so warily that Draco flushed. "What made you freak out like that?"
"I do not want Dumbledore or any of his people to have access. Also, I want them to forbid access to anyone who has the Dark Lord's magic staining their core access to the property," Draco said. He took a deep breath and then bit his lip. "This is confidential, Silverclaw. The Ministry has not put this out and probably won't for quite some time. My father died because the Dark Lord's shade was torturing him. In our house. He's created soul anchors. At least one but more than likely many of them. I will not have anyone stained by the Dark Lord's magic on Malfoy property. Nor will I have anything stained by that monster in our vaults."
"You were right," Grandfather Arcturus said straight to Harry. "The man we've all been calling Dumbledore isn't. He's… Grindelwald. I didn't bother with the Ministry. I went straight to Nurmengard myself. Remus came along. The man imprisoned there all these years was Albus Dumbledore. Grindelwald has been running around, using his name all these years."
"He's mine now," Harry said with such ferocity that Draco rolled his eyes.
Just as Harry caught his breath and nodded once to Draco that he was fine, the magic of the ritual surged inwards at Harry.
"Go on now, dear," she said, pointing towards the door that was right behind her desk.
It was like the moment when Draco realized that Father was going to beat him, that Mother couldn't stop it. The moment where he'd begged Dumbledore for sanctuary and realized, during Dumbledore's twinkly-eyed reptilian smile, that he would never ever get it.
"Sure," Harry said. "Can you get Hedwig outside without them seeing?"
Remus shut his mouth again, eyes a little wide as he fidgeted with the book.
It was wonderful.
"I didn't realize phoenix flame separated like that," Harry commented while staring at the rising blue flames.
He was never, ever alone again.
It would cost him the Malfoy patriarch's position. It might kill him. The wards were so very hostile to everything related to the Dark Lord now. Draco didn't care.
Summer's heat had long since turned the grass brown around the Keep but there were wind-twisted pines and a swathe of ivy that clambered up the shortest square tower as if it intended to envelope the entire Keep. Below the cliff, the loch gleamed in every shade of blue as the morning sun turned its rippling surface into diamonds.
"Well, check with ostende mihi," Harry said. "If it's touched by Fake Dumbles' magic, the wards should show it."
Which meant that Ivy was right, yet again.
"Potions and charms were my skills," Mother admitted with a faint blush.
He shook his head, closed his eyes, and then stilled. Even though Remus had so far refused to properly shift all the way into his Wolf, he didn't seem as upset as he had been before the blessing was removed. In fact, his magic, warm gold and brown, shimmered on his skin for a moment.
"Daily," Draco said entirely too calmly.
She ran over and tackled Harry with a hug that almost knocked him flat on his back. Harry staggered, holding Hermione who shook so hard that it felt like she was either freezing to death or going to lose her teeth from them chattering so hard. Draco put a hand in the center of Harry's back, making sure he didn't end up on the floor.
Harry could feel it thrumming through his magic, the strangely augmented magic that had spun a bond between him and Arcturus. When had that happened? During the healing?
"No, he would have," Professor McGonagall agreed. "All right, you children will stay here. We'll attack as soon as we get changed."
Harry nodded. He pushed at the wards and then said "ostende mihi" in as firm of a voice as he could. The shimmering circles that appeared in the air were in English this time. That was a huge improvement over earlier. The runes had been really pretty, like blocky Islamic calligraphy done in complicated interlocking rings, but they hadn't made a lick of sense.
Mother hugged Draco and then Harry, even though Harry flailed in surprise at first. She had tears in her eyes as she took her post next to Amal. Blue popped in and held Mother's hand. Just like Amal, the sheer determination and seriousness of Blue's face was a surprise.
"We're not dead?" Harry asked.
"Tonight," Draco agreed, seeing blue highlights skittering over Harry's warm brown skin from the magic in Draco's eyes. "Let's go out into the garden, duck around to the stairwell at the end of the wing. We should be able to avoid everyone that way."
Harry laughed as he rubbed his free hand over his hip, trying to get rid of the sweat pooling on his palm. "Okay. Right. This is fine. It's all fine. Okay. Well, lead me to him. Do we have an appointment or anything? I mean, you need appointments, right?"
Mother frowned at Draco, straightening up only to flinch minutely as the injuries that covered her body twinged against the wards. She would have said something comforting probably, but the sound and feel of the floo flared, pulling Draco's attention away.
"We need to talk about it," Grandfather Arcturus said with a sigh. "Lock the floo down again, Harry. This is only getting more complicated."
Harry groaned. "Sorry. It's like I've got too much energy. I can't settle down even though I'm tired."
"Yes," Harry agreed.
Her little sniff said that the blatant manipulation was unworthy of a Slytherin, but she nodded her head and gestured for Healer Smethwyck to set to work. Draco gladly retreated to let her have the illusion of privacy. He would know what happened automatically, but he didn't need to be rude about it.
"What?" Harry squawked with as much horror and outrage as Draco felt. "You're too young! We're both too young!"
"Yeah," Amal agreed.
"Back at the Burrow. He ran away after the Event," Percy said, glowering at the map and not noticing at all how everyone had edged away from Remus. Even Hermione was backing off, though Draco wondered whether it was because she understood that gold eyes like that meant werewolf or not.
He seemed hugely honored by getting to call Grandpa Arcturus "grandpa", far more than Harry had been when he got the offer.
"Master is so strong," Ivy murmured. "Master can do this. Master will do this?"
"Hm-mm," Draco murmured. "Bruised. I hope you don't sleep on your stomach."
"What's your wolf say?" Harry asked.
For one crystalline moment, Harry could see it play out. Harry grabbing for Dobby, Dobby dodging and then causing trouble downstairs. Spilling the wine or toppling the dessert or something. They wouldn't see Dobby. It would all come back on Harry and the next four weeks would be even worse than the last had been.
"Oh," Mrs. Malfoy breathed. She blinked several times, stopping her quill and setting it aside. "That depends on what you're attempting to accomplish, darling. A blessing will last longer. Much longer. It will be incorporated into the recipient's core, as we've all seen. A prayer to the Old Gods, however, will have much more raw power. Especially if it's given during a ritual at the proper times with the proper gifts."
Harry sighed and snuggled up next to Draco. "I hope so. I really, really do."
Harry blushed. When he peeked at Grandpa Arcturus, his cheeks above his silver-streaked beard were red, too. That set Harry to giggling. After a moment, Grandpa Arcturus shook his head and laughed as well.
"That's so odd," Mr. Swashlin said from the kitchen doorway.
Harry plopped down on the floor right there by the floo's green flames. Not in front of it. He didn't want Draco and Mrs. Malfoy to trip over him when they came through. That'd be painful. Off to the right where Silverclaw had sat when they'd sent messages back and forth to Gringotts was good enough.
Dim. The curtains were closed.
The entrance to the kitchen was less than a dozen feet from the secret passageway down into the ward room, much to Draco's relief. He tickled the pear and then they slipped into the kitchen together. He'd been to the kitchen a couple of times last year, mostly for nights when Pansy decided that they had to study in their common room. If Pansy was going to study somewhere private, she required treats and she was never, ever the one who went to get them.
"We need to know, Mother," Draco said. His eyes were grim, and his mouth had gone all pinched and narrow like he'd eaten an underripe lemon. "Dumbledore is the greatest threat we all face. Lupin is a chance to take one of his pawns. He's also a way to get more information. I think we need to do it."
The ward stone's magic released Harry entirely, letting his awareness bloom back out into the rest of his body. His stomach rumbled loudly. His knees and feet ached from standing still for too long. And wow, his head abruptly swam with exhaustion so bad that Harry would've fallen down if Dobby hadn't grabbed him and held him up.
"It has to be done here," Draco said.
"What was that?" Harry gasped and wheezed.
Silverclaw had a nose like a pickax, long silver hair pulled back into an old-fashioned queue, and claws that were in fact very long and covered with silver that had been engraved with tiny runes. The goblin that led them to Silverclaw stared at him with furtive desire that Silverclaw glowered at, flicking his fingers to send the goblin away as if his interest were profoundly insulting.
He wasn't alone now. He had an ally. Better than an ally. He had Dobby on his side and that, hopefully, should make all the difference as the summer and the next year went on.
Harry frowned at that before rolling out of bed and grabbing his dressing gown. "I'm one hundred percent never, ever letting Fawkes in here. I mean, if he's serving Dumbledore willingly which seems kinda weird now that we know who Dumbledore originally was."
"It means that we're free," Harry murmured to Draco as his eyes cleared enough to let him see the floating candlesticks overhead and the magically charmed ceiling which showed the thunderclouds slowly parting to let in beams of light that lanced down into the Great Hall like spears.
"Falling asleep on us, Malfoy?" Alastair Moody asked.
Something shattered.
Draco nodded again. He leaned against Harry's side, grinning when Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's waist and put his chin on Draco's shoulder. The simple joy of being held let Draco relax even further.
Draco nodded thoughtfully. "You said it was… struggling?"
Silently.
"Ostende mihi!" Draco snapped with his wand pointed straight at the cloak.
"You're sure?" Draco asked.
"Yeah." Harry groaned. "I did. I do. It's just hard. I mean, this is all hard. But…"
The weird nothing-everything-ness between then stretched and then snapped.
"You do have one," Amal said, grinning at Harry. "I'm with you on the studying side. I just use them. I don't need to know what makes them go. But then, I'm a seneschal, not a warder or curse-breaker. Come on. We'll floo over to the bank and get you all set up: heir rings, keys to your vaults, yes, plural, and your castle. I'll contact Arcturus Black and see if he's interested in meeting his heir before he dies."
"What about the blessing?" Harry asked.
"So," Draco said. "Ron and Hermione? You wanted me to ask, yes?"
"Stars that drift around me," Remus commented from the back corner of the room.
It took no effort at all to get behind the counter and then into the back room where the twins said the entrance to the secret tunnel was. The cellar stairs were steep enough that Harry looked around and pulled his cloak off before hurrying down them. He'd trip and break his neck going down them with it on.
They took the next step, both glowing and gritting their teeth at the anger and pain and misery throbbing through Dumbledore's labyrinth. Harry made himself breath slowly, forcing the air through his teeth. Every breath was a grimace, a punch to the gut. Every step was hauling himself forward after a Harry Hunting.
They would do this.
"Neither do I," Draco admitted. He sighed and dismissed the ward spell. "All right. I suppose you should use it. Do you think both of us could fit under it? It would be much easier to get downstairs to the ward room if you could bring me to the stairs under it. Once there, there's not much chance of anyone seeing me going down."
"Huh," Harry grunted. He shook his head and turned back to Amal. "So? Bad news?"
If anything, his magic seemed to be at war with the curses and his own lycanthropy. Any time he started to shift, his magic revolted, shoving him back into human shape. It looked like agony. Remus shuddered and screamed in his sleep whenever it happened.
"Master needs Dobby?" Dobby asked. He blinked and then wiggled happily. "Wards is nice, Master! Dobby likes them. They is much better than Malfoy wards. Ivy said that the Malfoy wards is better now, but these is better than them by far."
Worryingly, they were accompanied by both Remus and Professor McGonagall who looked terribly shaky.
The master bedroom was still dark, as it always was. Heavy ebony couches and armchairs with black leather in the sitting room competed with silver, slate grey, and black carpets. The curtains were heavy black velvet. All of them were drawn. Draco had never seen them open, not once. When he was tiny and Mother had brought him to see Lord Black, Draco had been too afraid to even touch the curtains. He was halfway convinced that there was solid stone on the other side of them, that the curtains were for fashion's sake, not to keep light from the windows out.
"Well, unless you count the twins," Harry said. "They're kind of… a lot. I mean, even more than what you see in public. In Gryffindor Tower they're, um. Yeah. Not so good. Especially to Ron and Percy."
He was standing at the door to the library, arms crossed over his chest and a weird little smile quirking one corner of his mouth up. The wrinkles between his eyebrows didn't look amused, though. More than anything, Grandpa Arcturus looked like he was half a second from hugging them both to pieces because he'd been terrified a moment before.
"No," Draco said. "He did not. Pansy is a brilliant young woman with a huge well of magic. I'm sure that she'll make a very advantageous match. I would ah, how shall I put this? Well. I'll be blunt. Pansy's already learned the castration hex, sir. I recommend that you ask her about her preferences and pay close attention to her responses. The older girls made sure that every girl in Slytherin learned the hex within three hours of arrival at Hogwarts."
Not a ward. Definitely not. It was narrow and long, like a braided rope. Wards were created in circles, not ropes.
"Which?" Harry asked.
Draco led them down the stairs at a near-run, even though Mrs. Malfoy spluttered and fretted about them both the whole way. He was way too focused to even notice that she was worried, so Harry caught her hand. She stumbled and stared down at Harry.
"Three," Draco agreed. "Best hurry."
Draco blew out a breath and nodded. "We'll do it."
Draco gasped.
Grandpa Arcturus slowly came down the stairs to stare into Harry's eyes. He sat on the stairs, grey eyes utterly serious as he nodded for Harry to continue. Between him and Amal, Harry had two hundred percent more adult support than he'd ever had before.
Magic simmered in the wards.
Harry grinned and tugged Draco back down into his arms. "It's all about not giving up for both of us. So we'll sleep and in the morning, I'll be stubborn, and you'll be brilliant, and we'll ask all sorts of stupid questions because wow, we haven't learned a single useful thing at Hogwarts so we don't even know what we don't know. And the grownups will be flummoxed and argue a lot and then the two of us will try something and set everyone on their ears."
"That's got to be one of the things that he's trying to control," Harry told her and Grandpa Arcturus. "The whole house rivalry thing is stupid."
That was… odd.
"The wards," Draco said. He shook his head slightly, as much as he could without dislodging Mother's hands. "They're warning me of the blessing Dumbledore used. Not violently but they do…"
"I didn't think we had any books anywhere but the library," Draco said as he helped pull the books out.
"Getting everyone else to hurt or pick on you, too?" Harry asked, rage starting to build under his breastbone.
Dobby grumbled at that. Some of the muttered curses were a little too close to accidents that Father had experienced over the years. Which, apparently, might not have been accidents at all. Yes, he was very glad to leave Dobby to Harry. He was far too much of a handful for Draco.
"He's thirty-three," Amal said very sadly indeed. "He was just twenty-two when he was sent to Azkaban for betraying your parents."
Harry blinked at Draco. "You're going to have to tell me those stories later. I've no clue what you're talking about."
"I will never give up that bond," Draco said. "He's mine and I'm his and that's all there is to that!"
"Dobby sees!" Dobby exclaimed. "He will explain to Master Harry. Master Draco should expect Master Harry to be lecturing him for a long, long time about taking care of himself and sleeping. He is very concerned that peoples get enough sleep and eat well and are not hurting."
While Professor McGonagall and Grandfather Arcturus questioned Cooper and Ivy in detail, everyone else listened with bated breath. Hermione and Remus both took notes of the entire discussion which was helpful. Draco was going to want to review those notes in detail once he had the space to breathe again.
"Hopefully," Draco murmured. "I still don't believe that Dumbledore's unaware of this thing. We'll use the cloak, as we planned."
"Ah," Remus said, staring at the letter. "Well. Hm. I see not even Azkaban can change Sirius."
The two of them went in. No one was in the first chamber of the tent. Harry stared around, delighted by the contrast between the inside and the outside. It was a proper home, really, full of squashy furniture and warm curtains that all but shouted that it belonged to the Weasley family. Off to the right there were windows that let in beautiful shafts of golden light. A chandelier hung from the peak of the tent. Better still, there was a wonderful old pot-bellied cast iron stove in the middle of the tent and steps that led up into other rooms in the tent.
"Yes, thank you, that's what I wanted to know," Draco said. He sighed. "Seriously, it's not that hard to just confirm it."
Draco/Harry/Fred/George said around the tears rising, the pain, the desperation,
"Has the advantage of being a literal, absolute truth, too," Amal agreed. "Okay, I'm for it."
Well.
Everything was at stake.
Harry pushed the latest stack of books away, thumping on hand on the oak tabletop as Grandfather Arcturus rested a hand on Harry's shoulder.
"Shut up, shut up, shut up!" Harry shouted before Grandpa Arcturus or Remus or Amal could answer her. "I gotta concentrate so that I can anchor Draco. He's gotta do something special to close his wards and keep Malfoy Manor safe from Dumbledore."
"End the reign of night," Draco agreed.
Thankfully, despite the questions echoing through the bond, Harry didn't protest after that. They ran to the ballroom, told Professor McGonagall, Mother and Amal, and then watched as they all ran from the ballroom together. Professor McGonagall's cursing echoed despite the shut door. Draco sighed, looking at Mother's notes. None of them made sense to him.
At least until he sighed and slowly collapsed back into his armchair with his eyes shut.
Everyone had laughed.
"First year or earlier than that?" Harry asked. "If it's first year, then it's Dumbledore."
The stars began of fade.
Draco blinked and then laughed quietly even though his stomach tied itself into a knot at Aunt Bellatrix's nickname. He was relatively certain he knew how she'd gotten it. She'd been insane most of her life, after all, and vicious all of it. The Black family elves had to have lived in terror of her.
"Ouch." Ivy tugged one of her ears in sympathy.
Draco stared at her. Harry did, too. They looked at each other and then Harry sighed before waving all of them to follow him downstairs. Draco made a point of walking at Harry's side because he was damned if he'd let Ginny steal his place. Thankfully, Neville somehow managed to block Ginny who ended up with Bill's hand on her shoulder, keeping her from pushing Draco away. Or down the stairs, possibly. The glare was quite ferocious when Draco glanced back over his shoulder.
"…You're surprisingly good at this sort of political maneuvering," Grandpa Arcturus commented while nodding his agreement that Silverclaw should take the letter.
"It's been… I can't remember how long its been since I got to just relax and not worry about anything," Draco said. He frowned as he snagged a chocolate covered almond biscuit to nibble on. "Not since I left the nursery, I think. Mother protected me fiercely when I was still in her domain. Once Father took over my education and care, there was… nothing good."
"Dobby is very stealthy commando!" Dobby exclaimed before leaving in a dramatic pop that cracked like a firecracker.
Remus' eyes flashed gold. "Where is Scabbers?"
To his finger that ached like he'd gotten a papercut right on the tip of his index finger.
"Control me?" Remus asked. He cocked his head to the side, blinking rapidly. "He could certainly rifle through my memories but only if he's staring straight in my eyes. I rarely allow him to do that."
George was the one to pull a piece of parchment from his pocket. He opened it up and spread it out on the table, ignoring Remus who sat up very straight with a delighted grin and Professor McGonagall who groaned and rolled her eyes while muttering under her breath.
"I guess we trust it?" Harry asked Draco.
They predated any Malfoy in Britain. He laughed as he pushed more magic into them and rings upon rings of rune circles formed around the ward stone. These circles might go back to Camelot, to Merlin.
Harry grinned. Ivy giggled.
"What is it?" Draco asked with a tired sigh that Harry felt all the way down to his toes. Not just because of the bond, but because Harry was as tired of this whole stupid Dumbledore mess as Draco was.
"I'm a werewolf," Remus said in a sort of strangled voice. "He can't do that."
"We tend to think it might be important."
"I do not believe that he could be one of the Dark Lord's agents," Mrs. Malfoy said equally seriously. She rubbed her hands together, staring at her fingertips as they shifted even, past each other, even again, past again. "The Department of Mysteries was quite clear that they had located the vast majority of his soul anchors. There wasn't enough of his soul left to effectively control a magi of Dumbledore's strength."
Harry nodded slowly before closing is eyes and touching the wards. It wasn't visible but Draco felt the shift in the energies around them. Back on the stairwell just out of line of sight, Remus shifted and growled. Professor McGonagall must have swatted him because Draco heard a quiet yelp and then an even quieter "sorry".
"This is sacred ground, Mother," Draco said as he got out of bed, batting her hands away. "I won't let him desecrate this place. We must go so that he follows us. The spell will fade as soon as we leave, but that's all right. We can always do it again sometime. Or have you and Grandfather do it. We can discuss it."
"I think Dumbledore is sacrificing Remus," Harry explained with such fury and disgust that Draco found himself offended, too. "He threw Remus at the wards with every expectation that Remus would be driven to go straight through the wards. I can't help but think that Dumbledore was testing to see if the wards would kill Remus right out. He's a pawn being sacrificed like in a game of chess. I hate that. I won't let Dumbledore sacrifice him. He was my parents' friend."
Harry grinned and headed for the library door. Doing something was always better than doing nothing. The sooner they had Sirius safe, the better. He'd be one more person on Harry's side, one more person freed from Dumbledore's control.
Obviously, no, it wouldn't because frankly, if you could cure lycanthropy by transfiguring someone into a teacup they would have been taught that in class. Dobby beamed at Draco and clapped his hands, stopping Draco's heart in his chest. All the adults' jaws dropped so at least it wasn't only Draco caught flat-footed.
The ward room at the very base of Hogwarts was sealed. Draco knew he should have expected that. The door was a heavy stone slab that more than likely took special spells and knowledge to open. Or at least the proper bloodlines.
"Dobby will make lots of good food," Dobby promised as Harry helped Arcturus stand. "He goes now and does it, Master Harry. Will start the fires and make Potter Keep ready for you."
"Huh," Harry grunted as he sat cross-legged in his chair. "I wonder why Mr. and Mrs. Weasley didn't have it done for Ron, then."
"Darling, I'm fine, truly," Mother protested.
Awake.
"I don't know," Harry said in the same tone of voice because it was better than admitting how nervous he was. "I'm not sure you're smart enough for my books, Malfoy."
Looking at his face was painful because of how bright his eyes were. That his roiling magic only showed there was stunning. It said a lot for just how much control Grandfather Arcturus had over his magic, despite having been weakened so dramatically.
Draco sat very still as Healer Smethwyck ran diagnostic spells over him. He'd far rather that the spells were pointed at Mother. They'd made it through the night, barely. Mother had spent the evening as the Unspeakables worked to trap the Dark Lord's shade alternately weeping silently and sternly lecturing Moody about getting the job done more quickly so that it would lessen the strain on Draco.
"Neither did I," Draco agreed. They didn't last long, fading away before they got more than ten feet from the phoenix, but it was very different from Fawkes.
"Potter, if you decide to go haring off to save the world again, I'm going to be very annoyed with you," Draco snapped at him. "We've more than done our part. Let someone else, an adult this time, save the world. We're going to go to school, figure out how to make babies together, and do nothing whatsoever dangerous ever again besides Quidditch matches. At which, I will absolutely slaughter you, thank you very much."
Their bond throbbed with pain for that. Harry's remembered pain. Draco's heartache that Harry had gone through it. And then Harry's heartache for everything that Draco had experienced. Draco snorted.
"Darling, we agreed that we were having a quiet day at home to recuperate today," Mother said with a little frown and a gentle smile that was so beautiful to see.
Or, you know, maybe not proud. It would've been perfectly appropriate coming from an exhausted wolf, though. Sort of.
As there wasn't much to share, just the warming and personalizing of the wards, their curiosity and dislike for Dumbledore's blessing and then the vision of Lady Magic, it didn't take long at all. Once Draco was done, Grandfather Arcturus grunted.
"Yeah," Harry said. "That's how I got Dobby. I said no, I won't fight you to get my mail. No, I won't let you or me get hurt. No, I don't want to stay with the Dursleys. And I kept on saying no and asking questions and now we're here."
Right. Okay. It was fine. They'd do what they planned. They'd go through the mini-labyrinth, smash the altar or something, and then channel the magic the twins had raised.
"Huh," Harry grunted. "Ivy was right."
"Um, that looked like it worked," Harry said. He grinned at the way both Grandpa Arcturus and Mrs. Malfoy started. "Seriously, it did."
"You're giving them to us," Moody said. He waved for Draco to follow him and then grabbed Draco's elbow when his knees gave out from under him. "Kid, you need to be resting, not moving around."
"So should Harry," Draco agreed. "I was… I know we can't do anything about the bond, Dobby. Not until he's free of the soul anchor. I just. I wanted him to be as calm as possible. The bond's there, you see. I couldn't see it or feel it, but it's always been there. This. I can't do anything else so maybe I can help him sleep before the ceremony tomorrow."
"So we have a plan I suppose," Draco said. "Someone transfigures Remus into anything inanimate and holds him there for… how long, Dobby?"
There was too much to see.
"This is such a bad idea," Harry murmured to Draco while stuffing his invisibility cloak into his pocket. "Do we even know where it comes out on the other end?"
Nearly twelve hours of constant effort had left Remus comatose, shivering in his cell and as weak as a new-born puppy. Draco wouldn't have been surprised at all if Remus had shifted forms as his magic tried to save him, but it hadn't happened.
"Can we send Pansy after Dumbledore's bollocks?" Harry asked Draco far more seriously than he really should've.
"Good," Harry said. "Mr. Swashlin said that you were my mom's friend and my dad's friend, too. The wards told me that you're a werewolf. That's why you're locked in. Well, that plus all the grown-ups are overprotective, but I kind of like that. It's nice after Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon."
Grandpa Arcturus grinned as he gestured for them to follow him into the ritual room. "I would like it, actually. I lost so much time with all my descendants, Draco. Stupid decisions on my part and then the damned curse trying to kill me. I'd be honored if you would give me the title of Grandpa rather than Lord."
"Right," Draco said, shutting his eyes and clearing his mind so that he could touch his magic and wish for all he was worth.
Because Harry would not accept failure.
Hedwig flew down to land on Harry's shoulder. She cooed and groomed his hair, loving on him as if she was as desperate for their time together as Harry had been.
They headed down into the dungeons, and yes, Malfoy Manor had dungeons, not a basement. Draco snickered all the way, swinging their joined hands while joy sang through their bond.
"You can't use that," Draco said with so much horror that Harry groaned. "He must have put tracking spells on it."
"Um, well, I kind of stole Dobby's bond last night," Harry said and then waved his hands when both Amal and Silverclaw gaped at him. "He wanted me to!"
Draco would need heirs, wouldn't he?
"I dunno," Harry said, shrugging. "I don't know how you do that fit it all together logically and strategically thing.  I guess it just means we work well together."
"I certainly hope it is," Draco said, studying the prayer much more closely. "I have to have an heir for the Malfoy magic, and you need two heirs, Harry. One for Potter and one for Black. If the spell works then we don't need to worry about bringing in a girl as a surrogate for us."
"Maybe Master should asks the goblins?" Ivy suggested. "Blue says Mistress is done with this round of healing. She be looking for Master Draco now."
"The bond," Silverclaw said, his voice barely coming over the roar of the spell and Harry's gasping moans. "It may need to go."
"Should be," Amal said.
"And on top of that he's layered a bunch of charms and potions and stuff that manipulates people into being just what he wants," Harry said with a nod towards Remus. "The strongest and most frequent ones applied to Remus because he shrugs them off as a part-werewolf, the least on Draco and me because we're kids and just had one year of being around him."
Harry frowned at the window.
Harry snapped his mouth shut, the bond going worried and fearful as Harry's eyes locked on his plate where he pushed around his eggs instead of eating them.
The magic grew. And grew. And grew until Harry could barely force air into and out of his lungs.
"Bad news first," Harry said. "Why would anyone want the good news first? Seriously, that's never made any sense."
It took ten minutes, thirteen trips of the Ford Anglia around the wards and three small heart attacks for George Weasley to pilot the car to the battlements on the right path and trajectory to allow them to unload their passengers. Which were Ginny, Neville, Ron, Hermione, Percy, Charlie, Bill and then Fred, all of whom carried bulky bags that they all but flung down the stairs while gabbling about threats, their parents and what in Merlin's name Harry thought he was doing.
So many failures. Draco wondered, honestly and very privately, whether this was a Harry Potter Thing. He'd done what no one else had been able to do. Maybe it was just Harry.
"It's done?" Harry asked when no one moved, not even Draco.
"Oh, no, Master Harry," Dobby said. "Was not that. All the elves knew about it. No one was asking us though. Was the phoenix, Fawkes, plus fake Dumbles had weakened wards, much like did with Malfoy Manor. If had not had Fawkes and had not weakened wards, they would have been safe-safe."
"Absolutely," Harry promised. "There's a ton to go over, trust me. Just, wow, so much stuff."
"Definitely," Grandpa Arcturus said. "I've some familiarity with other traditions and it doesn't match any of them."
Draco violently did not want the master suite. Certainly, it was two suites connected to each other in a way that would be perfect for him and Harry, but the sheer thought of sleeping in the bed where Father died, where he raped Mother night after night after night, made Draco's stomach turn.
Fred said with a sigh.
"We will," Harry promised. "You and the other elves need to get out of Hogwarts if you can. Go help Professor McGonagall and Grandpa Arcturus and Remus and the others. They could use your support. Just don't get hurt. We don't want any of you to be hurt if at all possible."
If they could.
Yes, there was a solution. Yes, he could keep trying. Yes, it was absolutely worth it to go without sleep, to skip meals, to work himself to the bone and beyond if it would help the people he cared about.
"Potter?" Draco rubbed his eyes. "What…? Oh, the wards."
Then Draco just looked wiped out. Exhausted. The bags under his eyes were purple-blue. His skin looked way too pale even for him. Harry could see the faint blue tracks of veins under his cheekbones. And his hands hadn't stopped shaking since Grandpa Arcturus revealed himself that morning.
Exhaustion landed on them.
Harry bit his lip as he eased down the stairs with Draco at his side. The sense of dancing through Hogwarts halls was gone as utterly as mist in a strong wind. His skin prickled with nervous sweat and his mouth was as sour as one of Dumbledore's favorite lemon drops. Worse even.
"Hey," Harry said, opening the cloak just enough that he could be seen peeking through, "we're trying to destroy Dumbledore before he can enslave everyone. Can you guys help? We just need to get into the wardroom somehow and Dobby suggested you might help."
Mrs. Malfoy swallowed a surprised laugh that was really close to a giggle. "Very well, I'll claim my cuddle once we're all out of here."
Then there'd been nothing to do but give the adults the prayer books, explain what they'd done and let Dobby put Harry to bed. Three hours later, Draco had finally just gotten up and announced that he was going to sleep since neither he nor Harry had gotten more than a couple hours of sleep overnight.
"Yes," Draco whispered as he pushed the wild magic shimmering and dancing around him outwards. "It is impossible. It is. You did your best. Harry was so right. You tried so very hard. It's okay. You can stop now. See? We've brought help. We'll make it right. Let go. You can let go."
Draco flipped a hand. "Don't be ridiculous. The Department of Mysteries already has his shade. Once they find the rest of his soul anchors, they'll be destroyed. He'll be sent to meet his fate with Death. He killed Father and then got trapped in my father's office when the wards switched over to me. I locked everything down instinctively, keeping him from leaving. That was not fun."
Dobby popped in, his ridiculous uniform looking less ridiculous in the darkness of Draco's bedroom. It was actually perfect camouflage against the shadows and dim light coming from the window. If Draco hadn't watched Dobby pop in, Draco wouldn't have spotted him at a glance. Maybe not even with a longer, closer, look.
Every jaw, Draco's included, fell open. Even Dobby's. Harry seemed utterly serious though and as Draco traced the thoughts and emotions in the bond that hid behind his blandly curious face, Draco could see his point.
"Now," Amal said, hands on his hips, "the two of you need to eat. You're both underweight and not your best. I expect you both to eat everything Dobby puts on your plate. If he thinks you need it, he's probably right. Elves are very good at that."
He then flung himself across the seat into Fred's arms while Charlie and Bill grabbed the two of them and hauled like their lives all depended on it. An instant later, Draco screamed along with Harry and Neville as the Ford Anglia disappeared entirely, leaving George dangling from his twin's arms. The three brothers got George over the battlements where he sat laughing and shaking as Percy whispered curses and prayers that Draco would never have thought would fall from the prissy prefect's lips.
The goblins, Silverclaw included, waited silently for Harry to work up his nerve.
Harry moaned as dark, bitter, bloody magic clung to his foot. "Oh, it's awful!"
"I can't see it as anything else," Harry said with a sigh. He sipped his tea and added a little more milk, only another couple of teaspoons though. "Dumbledore put me there. He's apparently my magical guardian. You said that there're ways to track how kids are doing. He must have them. Or he deliberately chose not to use them for some reason for me."
The pure relief that Arcturus would come to Potter Keep, that he did seem to want Harry, was enough to make him sag back into Amal's arm. All of a sudden, Harry was so tired that he could barely see straight.
"Darling, you need to rest," Mother said, hands fluttering as she almost touched his shoulder but not quite.
"Where did you hear that?" Remus asked, confused and frightened, and backing away from the door.
It was simple enough to turn down the loudness of the notifications regarding Mother's issues. He didn't adjust anything else on that. If someone, anyone, was hurt on his land, Draco wanted to know.
"A powerful wizard or witch will live on average two hundred and twenty years, Mr. Potter," Silverclaw said. "There are methods to extend one's lifespan much farther than that, but they have consequences."
Just that one word. Inside of it, inside their bond, a huge swell of determination, refusal to accept anything related to the Dark Lord, and a sort of need that brought tears to Draco's eyes.
"Yes," Draco breathed as the final circle formed and lit with a shimmering golden glow. "Yes, please. Lady Magic, bless our purpose. Grant us aid that all might be saved."
World.
"No," Draco said. "The problem with your so-called plan is that you're going in this like you can win a fight against Dumbledore. But you can't. He's Grindelwald, one of the deadliest wizards the world has ever known. He's in his place of power, raising a web of defenses that no one can counter. Not if you go straight at them. You'll be caught and not realize it. If you manage to resist the traps, he'll just use Hogwarts' wards to incinerate you."
He had to ensure that Father was completely distracted. There was no other way that Draco could possibly steal the Malfoy family magic, short of murder.
Grandpa Arcturus' eyebrows went up as the considered it. "That would work. I've no interest in staying there at the moment, but it makes a good base to work from. We'll have to link the floos securely, perhaps set up special portkeys that would take us to and from that no one would be able to stop or steal. But it could work."
"You know, I'm still desperately glad that you stole Dobby," Draco drawled. "He's way too much for me to handle."
"Eight minutes," Draco replied. His hand glowed brighter, so much so that his bones showed through the pale flesh.
"No," Bill said. He shut his eyes. "No, they haven't. Neither has Ginny and Dumble… Grindelwald had a lot of access to her. Mum let him spend whatever time he wanted with Ron and Ginny when he visited, even when they were babies."
"Yes, Master Draco," Blue said. "Vern and Yule is ready, too. We be here, protecting Mistress while you does what you needs to."
"Yeah, well, I think I'm entitled to be worried about Voldemort coming back at me after last year," Harry complained.
"Dobby made them think that Master Harry is not here," Dobby explained with a little shrug. "They is horrible people, Master Harry. All three of them. Dobby has found Master Harry's parent's seneschal. If Master Harry goes to him, he should helps. Is part of oaths he took to Master Harry's parents"
"It's dangerous," Amal said. He rubbed the back of his neck. "I know he's your friend, Harry, but you can't really trust him."
Silverclaw sat up very straight, staring at Draco as if he was seeing straight through to his soul. Perhaps he was. Draco had no idea what gifts Goblins had. Father had considered them annoying vermin and Dumbledore was nearly as bad. It was the only explanation for why Dumbledore let a racist old ghost teach History of Magic.
Someone, Harry had no idea who, had hidden an entire library's worth of books in Malfoy Manor. Stacks upon stacks upon stacks of them, all about prayers and blessings and the Old Ways that magi used to follow back before Dumbledore's day. Way before his day, actually, because from the dates on these books they'd fallen out of favor about fifty years or so before Dumbledore became Headmaster.
The nausea eased a bit as Draco breathed slowly and deliberately. Harry breathed with him, slightly surprised by how much the little meditative trick helped calm him down. After a few rounds of slow breathing, Harry reached out of the cloak and touched the doorknob.
The truly amazing thing about Harry bloody Potter was that he flatly would not stop trying. He would not give up. He would not, under any circumstances, consider that something might be impossible.
"I'll check with him on my seedlings later, darling," Mother called as she pulled book after book after scroll after folio off the shelves, passing them to Blue who levitated them over to the central worktable. "Don't spend too long."
"That's not going to help," Harry finally said because seriously, not working.
"You only call me Potter when you're mad at me," Harry complained. "I think I removed the blessing. Probably. Maybe? Not sure. We should have the adults check."
That didn't make it any easier to listen to the Goblins drone their chants in Gobbledygook. He wished he'd never begged Mother to let him learn Gobbledygook. Then he wouldn't have to know that the chants were full of prayers to their gods to keep Harry from having a heart attack and dying. Or the bit about spleens exploding. Or the bit where they held their hands up while staring at the ceiling with magic swirling all around Harry and screamed for help from the Goblin gods because they were just small creatures who couldn't possibly do this by themselves.
He was completely unprepared for the way everyone froze. They all turned to stared at Harry with a mixture of horror, thunderous frowns, and concern. Harry rolled his eyes at them.
Why did his hands ache? Had Father…? No. No, Father was dead. Draco had killed him to free himself and Mother.
"We won't let him win," Harry said, voice grim. Their bond carried his absolute determination to see this through.
He leaned forward and put his empty glass of whiskey on the tray Dobby had left behind. It disappeared instantly. Remus did the same with his empty bottle of orange soda, nodding thoughtfully.
"Harry," Draco huffed, fond and dismayed at the same time, "really, don't say things like that. It makes us look bad that you're ignorant of everything important. Comment later, in private, and I'll explain whatever you want."
"Just… you don't know what you don't know so you do these things, these amazing things, that no one could be prepared for," Amal said. He stretched and yawned, shaking his head and grinning as Harry giggled into Draco's shoulder. "I think they're dead right, guys. No one else can break the blessing for you. It's not even breaking. I mean, I tried making it let go. I tried order it. I tried praying to Lady Magic. It wasn't until I did just what Draco said, accepting it and gently thanking it for helping me so well, that it let go. That's what we gotta do."
Grandpa Arcturus and Professor McGonagall exchanged the sort of dark looks that grownups always used when they were weighing just how much to tell a kid about bad stuff going on. Harry frowned at them, hands on his hips. There was no point to keeping secrets. Not now. How could they solve the problems if they weren't sharing all the information?
"We need more information," Harry said as they reached the small dining room near the kitchens that Dobby had decreed as the family dining room. The formal dining room was a good eight times bigger and way more formal. This was more like Aunt Petunia's kitchen table, just without the kitchen around it.
Harry snickered. "Yeah, I guess we will. Good thing all your plotting and planning got us here. We're just the lightning rod. Once we get to the right place, it'll be everyone else doing the hard work."
"Yep," Harry agreed. "Everybody take a seat. Do I need Dobby to bring you a different chair, Silverclaw? I'm sure he can find something if you need it."
"Can you pop us into the ward room?" Harry asked. "Or pop us past the door. Through the wall? Is there a secret passageway? We just need a way to get in there, fast, because we've got to be in position to destroy Dumbledore before noon. There's not much time."
Despite his disgust that the blatant manipulation, Draco still dropped asleep the instant he put his head down. Harry rubbed the back of his neck and nodded to Ivy to keep an eye on Draco.
Draco snorted a laugh, smiling all sly at Harry. "Fine. You're not going into the room, but you can hover outside of it the way I did back at Potter Keep."
"We is taking care of our masters ourselves," Dobby snapped, glaring at Draco so fiercely that Draco instinctively held his hands up to ward the glare off.
"Still only call me Potter when you're angry," Harry said. He grinned and leaned into Draco's side. "And of course I know nothing. Why would Dumbledore give me the chance to learn anything that I might be able to use to get free from his control? He wants me weak and helpless against his plots and compliant with whatever he wants from me. Which is probably for me to be a good little soldier and die for whatever cause he was going to manufacture."
It hit him full in the face, lighting up Harry's eyes and mouth and nose and ears as it flowed into his body. Draco staggered and went to one knee, clutching his chest where the heart of their lovely, fragile new bond lay.
The wards pooled around Draco. They truly felt aware. The link to them was so much like his link to Ivy, to the other Malfoy elves. It wasn't as deep as the one to Harry. That went right down to Draco's core. He was fairly certain that their bond had started before they were born and would extend long after they were dead.
"Malfoy," Moody said so gently that Draco stared and the aurors froze. "You're holding in an active soul shard. Plus a shade. I recognize the soul. There's no wonder that you're exhausted. Or that your daddy died. This is You-Know-Who's shade, trapped right here in your wards."
Draco's hands clenched despite the spike of pain from his hands. And…
"Hm," Draco hummed, leaning past Harry to frown at him. "Problem? Bill did say that Hermione and Ron had figured out the blessing. And that Ginny was close. They more than likely won't be quite so… abrasive now."
"I… Okay," Amal said, shaking his head. "I should've asked about the elf earlier. And um, the uniform."
"It is not!" Grandpa Arcturus huffed. "Give that back! It's fine the way it is."
"I'd trust Dobby to hide them," Harry said. "But the fewer who know, the more powerful the prayer is. We have to get the entire world, Draco. Not just Britain but everywhere. There're so many people all over the world who've been affected. You know how long he's been doing this. We gotta get everyone, everywhere, if we can."
"Is he all right?" Draco asked more out of habit than any real concern. "I know Harry wouldn't hurt him, but Father didn't inflict any lasting damage, did he?"
"I wouldn't dare!" Draco squawked, face going so red it looked like he was about to burst into tears.
"I do," Draco said, glaring at her as she bristled even more. "And yes, we absolutely do know what happened, why and how. As we were the center of it."
Draco shuddered as the wards' magic lanced straight through him. Electric blue lightning bolts arced away from him, striking the walls, and lighting up rune circles that lay dormant in the stone walls. They bloomed, the electric blue light flaring brighter and brighter as more and more of the circles activated.
They might be older.
"When Dobby yells at you for not eating well," Draco said as he took one of the very hearty beef sandwiches, "I'm not defending you."
Fangtooth's voice faltered for a second and then his chanting picked up strength and speed. Arcturus shuddered, his lips curling back in a snarl as the pain-filled frown turned into a furious snarl that made Harry laugh as he shook and clung to Amal's hand. Dobby seized his other hand and the three of them stared at Arcturus and the healing.
Draco.
What the adults had to say was lots of cursing, Mr. Swashlin counting hours and then running for the Floo to send a message for Draco, and Mother hissing in outrage that Father had dared to sign such a contract on Draco's behalf without consulting her first. Not that she would have been capable of saying no, but the principle of it had Mother honestly enraged.
The blessing.
The wrinkles around Arcturus' eyes deepened but they were bright and smiling wrinkles instead of pain or anger or anything. The silver-streaked beard hid his smile. The wrinkles gave it away entirely.
Dobby's fingers glowed. He waved at the door. Instead of flinging the door open to say something cruel about Harry's birthday and the pure lack of anything good happening for him, Dudley stomped onwards to his room.
He had to hold on just a little longer and then he could sleep for a week and eat twice his weight in food, and call their favorite Healer from Saint Mungo's to take care of Mother's curse damage. It scratched away at Draco's awareness like a sliver under your fingernail that you couldn't quite pull out.
Draco.
"I believe it will," Draco said. "Professor McGonagall is a good woman. As long as Dumbledore hasn't already gotten to her, it should be fine."
Draco snort-laughed. "You're ridiculous."
Draco caught Harry's hands, pulling them away from his face and hair so that Harry wouldn't try to tear chunks of hair out of his head.  When Draco sucked in a breath, it was with the clear expectation that Harry would do it too. They held the breath, let it out slowly, pulled in a second breath and then let that out slow too.
"Okay, so," Amal said as he came in and flopped on the bench next to Harry, "you want the good news or the infuriatingly bad news?"
He didn't struggle. Moody was right. This trip up to Father's office took a quarter the time it had before. Croaker strode at their side like a living shadow. He didn't say a single word until they reached the doors. Father had spelled them to close automatically. The protections on them were ferocious, lethal.
This was horrible. He was so tired! Draco stumbled back through his bedroom, through the Green sitting room, the Blue sitting room and into Harry's bedroom where Harry was pacing and swinging his arms and generally looking so manic that Draco wanted to whine about how much energy Harry had. Or the Gryffindor red and gold pajamas. Those were hideous, so very bright and far too large for Harry since they puddled around his body.
"Masters can ask Come and Go room for a way down into ward room. Bad Master Dumbles cannot stop that. Cannot block it. Hid the Come and Go room long and long ago but we elves remember. We tells those who needs Come and Go Room. Good Masters goes and kills him. Wish for what Masters need, wish very, very hard. Come and Go room will make it be."
To both Grandpa Arcturus and Professor McGonagall's amusement, Draco rolled his eyes and hauled Harry off up the stairs by his hand. Given that he was taller than Harry and stronger, Harry didn't have a chance to protest it.
Ivy nodded, firmly. Hopefully, her ears coming up and a tiny smile curling the corners of her mouth.
No click.
"Thanks," Ginny said so quietly that Harry barely heard it.
Draco put his bleeding hand on the ward stone. Dropped to his knees. Pressed his forehead against the stone.
The handwriting was firmer than Draco expected. Mother had been working for most of a year to save Lord Black's life. She'd been clear in all her letters to Draco over the school year that she didn't expect to succeed. In fact, she'd expected to get a call from Gringotts anytime that Lord Black had died.
Harry groaned and curled up in Draco's arms. Great. They were gonna get another round of yelling at and this time Harry absolutely didn't think he deserved it. He'd just saved Draco. That was worth praise, not scolding.
"One of?" Lord Black demanded. He grabbed for the back of the sofa as his legs went out from under him. "He made multiple?"
"I, ah, never got one," Harry said, blinking at him. He turned to Dobby who slowly shook his head. "You didn't steal any bank correspondence, did you?"
They hadn't gotten everyone. They couldn't. But so many were free already. The longer they held this, the more magi were freed. It was beautiful. So much love and joy and pure euphoria that it had worked.
"Nope," Harry agreed. "I know pretty much nothing about magic. Dumbledore did his best to make sure I didn't learn anything last year and my relatives would beat me if anything "freakish" happened before that. We couldn't even read fairy tales when we were kids."
Generations. Six or seven, maybe eight generations. So many Malfoys who had left this magic alone.
Harry nodded. Then nodded again as he rubbed his hands over his thighs to get rid of the sweat. He turned to Grandpa Arcturus who was pale as the white in his beard and clutching the doorjamb like he could barely stay on his feet.
The entrance was on the far side of the labyrinth. Harry bit his lip and then walked clockwise around it. The prayer book hadn't said which way was correct to approach the labyrinth, just that you had to do it secretly and that you had to set up wards to amplify the magic of the prayer.
Draco opened one eye, frowning. "What does "really bad" mean?"
"No, not that!" Hermione exclaimed. She pushed back out of his arms, hands gripping his biceps hard enough that it hurt. "I mean, yes, absolutely, I'm sorry for that, but no, that's not what I'm sorry for."
"The bond is there, Potter," Draco drawled. "I can't help that I feel things now. If you were paying attention, you'd feel things from me, too."
Draco wheezed and silently blessed the house elf ability to instinctively know what not to do. If she'd flung herself at his chest and hit his hands, Draco might have vomited all over everyone. He made soothing noises as Ivy wailed, but all his comforting noises did no good whatsoever. When he tried to sit up, Ivy shoved him right back down again and wailed harder.
Draco started eating the hash very, very gingerly.
Because of course the library was bigger on the inside than the outside.
"Right," Harry said. "Let's go."
"Because you did too much magic too hard," Harry called from his suite, the blue suite.
"Well, sure there is," Harry said, confused that this was even a problem. "It's called money. I've got lots. They don't. I'll either pay them off or sue until they're ground into the dirt. Come on, now, don't be silly."
Ah, there went Draco's temper. He'd never been good at keeping control when he was tired, hungry, or embarrassed. Or afraid. All of them at once? Draco was going to get himself arrested if he didn't rein it in.
"Money," Draco replied. "It's not cheap. The Weasleys are an old family but they're poor. Painfully poor. I'll have to do something about that. Father was systematically ruining them. Every chance he got to destroy Arthur's prospects, wages or increase his taxes, he took. I probably owe them a life debt now."
"Teach me later," Harry said.
"Yes!" George said. "See here? This one goes from Hogsmeade back to Hogwarts. This one might work, too, but it's not underground most of the way. It goes from the Shrieking Shack to the Whomping Willow. You have to be careful, press just the right knot on the Willow or it'll brain you."
Breathe in.
The crystal stayed perfectly still.
She smiled at him, nodded once, and then faded away.
Not just the wards.
He definitely wasn't dead.
"Your godfather Sirius Black never got a trial and probably wasn't guilty," Amal said. "At all. Near as Silverclaw and I can tell, it was a plot to get control of you. If Sirius was out of the way, if Lord Black was dead or too sick to do anything, then controlling you would be easy."
"Let's go!" Harry said to Dobby.
Going about with Ron and Hermione under the cloak had been horribly awkward. They never moved as one and were constantly jabbing each other with elbows or treading on heels. Half the time they'd been under the cloak had been spent squabbling and struggling to even move an inch.
Harry wasn't alone.
"Neither do we," Harry said. "But we have to get into the center of his labyrinth, Tippy. Where is he?"
"Agreed," Harry said.
Healer Hippocrates Smethwyck was sternly grandfatherly, with white hair he kept above the collar line, faded blue eyes and a wit that could flay you alive even as he healed every hurt you'd ever had. Draco had been terrified of him as a baby, afraid of him as a young boy, and now as Lord Malfoy, found that he still found the old man horribly intimidating.
"…You're on," Ron said after considering for a long moment. "I mean, you're an evil Malfoy git, but you're Harry's evil Malfoy git so I'll take it."
Seriously, Harry needed to figure out a way to get all of Dumbledore's power taken away from him. He'd done so many terrible things to so much of Magical society. Once the letter was done and dry, Harry put it in an envelope and then slipped off the couch to go over to Silverclaw who'd retreated back to the fireplace with his notes.
They pressed their hands against the wards, reaching with the strange, shifting magic of the house elf out to Ivy who nodded and nodded and nodded.
Dumbledore's dark labyrinth had lines just wide enough for one grown man to stride through it. Two twelve-year-old boys couldn't quite walk side by side, not as they were. But when Harry looped one arm around Draco's waist, that gave them just enough room to step down onto the stained black line together.
Yeah, no.
Harry gasped. His eyes flew open, the brilliant green barely visible because his irises had dilated so dramatically that his eyes look black. He peered at Draco, squinting, and then groaned as he slumped back against the rubble.
"Yes," Draco agreed.
Professor McGonagall rubbed her forehead. "What did he say?"
No pop.
Draco nodded and didn't add "we'll just have to survive it all".
"The good news is that Silverclaw has locked down your vaults, recalled everything that was ever taken from them, ensured that Potter Keep is completely intact and ready to move in with newly updated wards that would keep a full army out," Amal said while bouncing on the bench with as much excitement as Dobby who was clapping his hands, "and he managed to keep it all secret as we went. We're pretty sure no one knows that you're not at Privet Drive."
Both Remus and Amal blinked at Harry like they couldn't quite parse out the words he'd said because they were so far outside of the argument they'd been having. It took a moment before Remus to frown and cock his head to the side like a confused puppy.
Draco shuddered, blue eyes like neon lights now. "We certainly can't use it. It would disrupt the prayer we're doing. Tippy, you can't fight Dumbledore, can you?"
"Oh, please don't say things like that," Harry moaned.
Remus shuddered and looked away. "I don't want to say it where Harry could hear."
Ivy nodded and snapped her fingers. The little blue book appeared in her hands. When Draco set her on the table, Ivy swung her feet and cocked her head to the side as Draco flipped through the rituals.
It flowed out, warm, and moist like the blood slowly dripping down knuckles, falling onto a moss-green / blood-black altar.
If Harry went right, Draco moved smoothly with him. They ghosted through the hallways to the stairs like they were dancing in an old Fred Astaire movie, perfectly synched to each other and always properly covered by the cloak. Harry's heart sang at how easy it was to move through Hogwarts with Draco.
The snarl faded into the most puzzled frown that Harry had ever seen on anyone's face before. Harry grinned, then laughed as Draco glowered at him. When Harry shrugged, Draco rolled his eyes.
"But he's not going to go feral or kill me or kidnap me, is he?" Harry asked. "I mean, the immediate problem is dealt with, right?"
"Okay, so, thinking out loud here," Harry said while not watching Mrs. Malfoy bury her face in her hands and Grandpa Arcturus put a hand on her shoulder with a devastated expression on his face. "Magic is way more alive than anyone admits. The blessing is supposed to keep you safe. It can't. It's created so that it can't, but it still tries. You're not quite a werewolf."
Both of Harry's eyebrows flew up. "Oh. Oh! Huh, yeah, I hadn't consciously noticed that yet, but you're right. Not good. We really gotta get in there and stop whatever he'd doing."
Harry hugged him. Of course.
"Oh, well, that's helpful," Harry said, delighted. He did as Draco instructed, specifically targeting all the confusing messages that the wards were pushing at him. "Ostende mihi!"
From the way Silverclaw wiggled and then settled back against the mass of cut field stone that made the fireplace, it was more than acceptable. Draco stared at him for a moment and then shrugged infinitesimally. If he was happy, so be it. Harry could be more forceful about it if he chose. Mother settled in the burgundy velvet armchair closest to Draco. Amal flung himself onto the brown couch and waved for Remus to sit next to him. Grandfather Arcturus and Professor McGonagall took the remaining armchairs, though amusingly, Professor McGonagall glowered until Grandfather Arcturus gave up the black leather covered one, switching to the aged gold velvet armchair.
"Got it," Moody said.
"Do I need to give more blood?" Harry anxiously asked Fangtooth, the head Healer assigned to Lord Black. "He's so pale. Shouldn't he be looking better with a transfusion?"
"What?" Draco asked, glaring at him.
Only to gasp and nearly pass out from the pain.
"Ivy's bond to me is very robust," Draco said. He laughed softly as Ivy popped in and bounced at his side. "She'll be fine. Honestly, I could take all of them, but I'd hate to take Vern away from the gardens."
Harry nodded but didn't say anything. They ate their breakfast. Drank more tea. Wandered out of the kitchen and then through Potter Keep. Mr. Swashlin left them to their own resources, marching off to help Grandfather Arcturus and Mother sort through what needed to happen to purge the control curses from both Remus and Professor McGonagall.
They went through the floo together, hand in hand. Draco clung to Mother, not so much for his own sense of balance but for Mother whose breath caught and whose knees went weak for a moment as they emerged from the floo. The spells on the fireplace whisked away the soot that automatically covered one, leaving both Draco and Mother clean.
"How are they doing?" Harry asked with a nod towards Remus and Professor McGonagall. The bond made it utterly clear that he wasn't ever going to bring the subject of Draco's almost-betrothal to Pansy up again.
There was no way to tell how much distance each step covered. Harry couldn't tell if it was miles or inches. He couldn't feel the gravel under his feet. Breathing seemed to have stopped. Honestly, he wasn't sure his heart was still beating. Or maybe he was suspended between one second and the next.
"We got the immediate curses off," Grandpa Arcturus said as he tugged Harry into a hug that was almost as good as the one with Draco.
"Oh, no," Draco said. "Turn the vehemence down a touch, yes. It's rather like having Dobby yell in my ear constantly."
"Damn your stubborn hide, wake up!" Draco bellowed. "That hurts!"
Dobby nodded again. "If is family, is easier for elf-magic to stick."
"That's a blessing I'd like to have," Harry commented. His eyes had slid half-shut from the comfort of the wards wrapped around him. "Not like the stupid one Dumbledore put on me. That's just trouble waiting to happen. Is there a way to take control of the blessing back from him? I wonder."
"…When would I have had the time?" Draco asked, more than a little annoyed. "Father died yesterday just after noon. The wards landed on me as he died because I was the only Malfoy nearby who didn't have the Dark Mark. There hasn't been a Malfoy with the ability to interact with the wards in two full generations. Perhaps three. On top of that, the aurors and the Unspeakables didn't leave until after midnight."
"How long to magi live, anyway?" Harry burst out because he just couldn't stand not knowing that.
Harry sighed and rolled over to wrap his arms right around Draco once he was fully on the bed. Draco smiled. Maybe it wasn't the decorating. Maybe it was just Harry. Merlin knew, Harry didn't seem to have the slightest concept of distance, formality, or proper manners.
Dobby was first. He would always be first. That's just how it was.
It took a second but both Amal and Silverclaw laughed at that. It seemed to help, thankfully, because Silverclaw stopped setting sparks off as he tapped his desk. And Amal relaxed in his chair, ruffling Harry's hair fondly.
When Harry touched the display, it shivered and then became English. Not one of the warnings was for Harry and his scar which made him stare. Draco nodded before pointing at the warnings near the main doors, the castle gates and at the floo.
Harry blinked.
"So," Harry said, staring at the wards while being deeply grateful that they'd upgraded the wards already, "is there a way to let him through and then seal the floo again? And, you know, to keep him from leaving the floo room?"
A man.
"Dobby will be very careful," Dobby promised. "First food for Master Harry. Then rest. In the morning, Dobby will have news."
Who, not surprisingly, had ducked down so that only her eyes and ears peeked above the edge of the bed.
The contrast between the weight of the cloak and the near nothingness of seeing through it, made Harry's stomach lurch a little.
"Darling, what's wrong?" Mother asked. She knelt in front of him, gently cupping his cheeks. "You've not heard a word we said."
"No, I like reading," Harry said. "I used to get beaten up for it so I'm always careful who I let see me reading. And, well, Ron's really bad at reading so I feel bad reading around him."
"I'd promise but we both know me," Harry replied way too calmly for his contrition, his relief, his exhausted joy that they'd survived.
"It was your idea," Harry huffed right back at him. "So that you had a clear feeling for what the twins magic felt like and strong link to them while I got us in position to start."
"Getting in there is precisely the problem," Professor McGonagall complained. "Not even the elves can get in through the Hogwarts wards, Mr. Potter. They're not bonded to the castle."
"Time to go get the wards set up to allow incoming messages," Harry declared, much to Professor McGonagall's amusement and Remus' dismay.
"Go up?" Draco asked.
Moody scooped Draco up in his arms like a baby again, grinning at the way Draco squawked. "Takes less time this way, kid."
Draco gripped the cloak in two places while Harry wrapped an arm around his back and closed the gap again. Tippy nodded and then put his hands on their chests. His eyes gleamed with magic that zapped through Draco like he'd been hit with lightning.
Harry blinked. Okay. Right. Well.
"Dumbledore shared a prophecy with them," Amal said. "James was… He was upset when he came to set up all the account protocols for them to go into hiding. Your mother just about scorched the paint off the walls with her cursing. She had a bit of a tongue on her when she was really angry."
Only one fireplace downstairs on the main floor off in one corner of the Keep, away from the living quarters and kitchen, was connected to the floo.
"Is right," Dobby agreed with Harry. "Master Wolfy accepts his wolf and all will be good. Dobby goes and makes plenty of food. Master Wolfy will need it if he ever accepts himself and stops being so mean to himself. Even Dobby did not punish himself as bad when he was still a Malfoy elf as Master Wolfy."
Or maybe yelling at the blessing deep inside of his core.
They stumbled around the corner to the straight shot towards the altar, both of them gasping for air as the weight and exhaustion dropped into ice-cold determination that felt nothing at all like Harry or like Draco.
Please.
"Certainly," Amal said. He blinked when Harry made the angry goose noises of dismay, turning to Dobby who stared back at him. "He doesn't know about his godfather? No, what am I saying? Of course, he doesn't know about his godfather. Right. Well, you're the Potter heir, obviously. But you're also the heir for the Black title. Sirius Black adopted you, with your parent's permission, when you were just a couple of days old. He'd taken a curse and couldn't father kids, so that was their way to make sure that the Black family magic wouldn't go to a cadet line when old Arcturus Black finally kicks off. I got invited to that. It was a really sweet little ceremony."
"The key is gentleness," Draco said. He opened one eye and found every adult staring at the two of them. "It is. Gentle encouragement, gently telling the blessing that it's done well, that it can let go. That you're safe and free and happy, just as it was supposed to make you. That's what made mine let go."
"Mm-hm," Harry murmured. He headed back up the stairs towards the dungeon proper. "To the kitchens. We don't have much time. Dobby says that the Hogwarts elves don't like Dumbledore and they're not tied to him. They're tied to Hogwarts' magic. They might help us get in to get back at Dumbledore."
"Right," Harry said as he nodded slowly. "Okay, I'm going to go deeper into the magic, see what I can figure out, Dobby. You watch. Pull me free if I go too deep. And if you can't, go get Draco and Ivy and Grandpa Arcturus and Amal. Not Professor McGonagall and Remus. They're too messed up."
"That's a Ford Anglia," Harry replied as if that would make sense of the car whipping around outside of the wards.
"What?" Remus gasped.
"Wow…"
Harry swallowed down the euphoria and paced onwards. The problem now was not running instead of walking. No wonder the notes in Draco's blue prayer book warned about going too fast. Despite being so careful, Harry could barely keep himself from running through the last bit of the labyrinth to the heart.
"Oh, well, Dumbledore told me that Harry was missing from his home," Remus explained. His eyes were even more distant than before. "He said that he was afraid that Harry had been kidnapped. I was the only one who could survive going through Potter Keep's wards."
"Ivy will, Master Draco," Ivy declared. "Something with emeralds."
do it.
Claim what he was due. That's what he was doing. It wasn't theft. The Dark Lord was trying to steal their magic and their money and their lives. Draco was taking back what he and Mother were both due.
"Yes," Draco whispered far too quietly for anyone to hear it over the chanting and the rising scream of the Dark Lord's soul anchor.
They passed a window that looked out towards the Shrieking Shack just before the entered the second secret passageway.
But there was no sign of Dumbledore so they didn't have much of a choice but to sneak down into the library that must have been put in place by the Founders. Harry didn't look at the books. No time, no interest, too afraid of what would happen when Dumbledore realized that they were there.
"That's amazing," Harry said. "Why didn't anyone teach us this?"
"This is true," Draco said. "Mostly because I have to blow my nose ever few seconds."
"Okay," Remus said. "I guess I can ask."
"I think I probably do," Harry said. "I wish I knew why he'd want me to suffer."
"Dobby did," Dobby agreed, grinning at Harry. "Master Harry said to make a uniform. Dobby chose best sheets possible for his uniforms. They have all sorts of pockets!"
Draco nodded immediately. "I'm honored to be allowed to help, sir."
Harry blinked. "We're really influencing each other, aren't we?"
"Dobby was about to, Master Harry," Dobby said as he grabbed Harry's arm, draped it over his shoulder and then proceeded to drag Harry right out of the ward room. "Master Draco is waiting. He is very worried about you, but it had not been an hour yet. Master Harry should not have gone so deep, though. First time should be much less deep communion."
"Fix Black Manor and Malfoy Manor," Draco said immediately. "Purge all the dark magic and everything that Dumbledore left behind to give himself access. Contact other kids, other houses that Dumbledore undermined. Blaise. Pansy."
"Oh." Harry sighed and reached out to pat Dobby's bowed head. "Right. Well, one way or the other, it doesn't matter. Do whatever you're going to do, Dobby. I can't leave without Dumbledore's approval and Uncle Vernon can't keep me here indefinitely. When Dumbledore wants me back, he'll come get me even if Uncle Vernon locks me in the cupboard and throws away the key."
Mother brushed a hand over the combs and smiled as if it might break her face. "They were a wedding gift from Lord Black. Lucius… never liked them."
Amal's frown went surprised, then awed and then downright determined in a grimly serious way that Draco wouldn't have expected out of the genial, smiling man. Mother nodded thoughtfully as if that made total sense. It did.
He tossed a book back onto the closest stack. It teetered dramatically. Both Harry and Draco grabbed for it, keeping it from toppling over and setting off a book pile domino effect that would get them in trouble.
The blessing wasn't really aware. Or alive. It was more like the newly-hatched baby snake he'd encountered early one spring while weeding Aunt Petunia's garden. Instinct and impulses with not much behind it.
Draco nodded. "I… don't know if our bonds to the elves might function well enough. I suspect not. We've had to be very specific asking the elves things. Dobby might have the independence and force of will to be able to tell Harry if there was something influencing the bond, but I don't know that Ivy and the other Malfoy elves would even think to mention it to me. It's not part of their training."
"What spell?" Harry asked at the same time as Draco even though neither of them expected Neville to be able to answer them.
Harry laughed at last, opening his hands and lifting up his chin as he walked out of the labyrinth and into the heart of magic that lay at its core.
Remus and Amal exchanged a wary look and then went through the floo together. Nearly at a run. Grandpa Arcturus waved for Narcissa to go next.
"Potter, the Dark Lord's shade has already been captured," Draco said once he managed to stop laughing. His voice shook but Draco couldn't stop it.
"Okay, so, see here?" Harry said, pointing out the right spot to Professor McGonagall. "This says who you are. And it says what spells you've got going. Right now, there's a whole slew of them, like, close to a dozen? No, eleven of them. There are eleven control spells on you affecting who knows what. My eyes are tired. It's late."
Ivy rolled her eyes. "Ivy is just hoping he is getting some sleep. He is as bad as Master Harry, looks in every corner and asking questions non-stop. He is over-tired. Too excited to sleep. Will fall on his face, just see if he doesn't. Ivy will point and laugh and then she will put him to bed. He won't even notice."
Dobby's grin was brilliant. Harry's felt nearly as wide.
Some instantly. Some slowly. Some with a jerk and surge. Some so softly that it was as gentle as a baby's sleeping breath flowing out.
"Wish…" Harry whispered. "Wish magic? Like accidental magic?"
He gathered up the six little books and then looked around for a place to hide them. Draco snorted, reaching for them to give them to one of the elves to hide. Then he froze when Harry frowned.
For those curious, no, my Harry Potter fics do not build on each other. They're stand-alone stories that cover what I have to say on each year. I plan (don't know if I'll actually do it) to do at least a couple more of these and those will be stand-alone fics, too.
"The Ministry will know if I do magic," Harry whispered even more quietly.
Who nodded when Harry turned his way, calm and sure and only a little bit pale. Like last night, the calm flowing through their bond washed through Harry, soothing his fears just as well as Draco's snippiness had.
Draco floated, hands aching.
Which didn't stop Harry's hands from shaking as he pulled the secret entrance open. It didn't stop his heart from pounding like a jackhammer in his chest. And it certainly didn't stop the worry and fear from echoing between Draco and Harry.
"The curses are more encompassing than expected," Grandfather Arcturus said, sighing. He looked as though he'd not gotten a single bit of sleep overnight or all day. "They can't stay there, or their hearts start skipping beats."
The spell spun, deep green and celadon and lime yellow, in front of Harry for a moment. Then it spiraled out into a set of five interlocking rune circles. Harry blinked and then beamed as he realized that each of them represented one of the towers, plus a bigger one that covered the yard and the cliff that the Keep sat on.
Which was quite valid. Draco considered it for a moment, shrugged and turned to Harry who perked up.
All sense of individuality disappeared.
"Yes," Mother said as she sat opposite Silverclaw. She gestured so Draco came to sit next to her even though Silverclaw's chairs were made of stone and completely without padding spells. "According to my son, my husband and his father were both unable to interact with the wards due to the Dark Mark. We need to have them renewed and updated, please."
The real question was how strong Mother's marriage bond to Father was after everything she'd been through. If it was too strong, this was going to hurt her along with Father. There was little that Draco could do about that.
Draco snorted a laugh, finally looking at Harry again. His eyebrows went up as he sat up properly. Harry didn't even realize that something was wrong until Draco held up a hand as if to shield his eyes.
All he could hope was that the goblins would have ideas of how to save Remus. Harry hated the idea of anyone being sacrificed against their will, no matter who they were. Dumbledore had a lot to pay for.
"We goes in now, Master Harry," Dobby said, pushing Harry towards the door. "Is much to do."
Across the room, next to Hedwig's now-open cage, Harry's trunk sat waiting. The second thing Dobby had done was to pop all Harry's belongings out of the cupboard. Harry had nearly cried in relief just  from getting his wand back. Having pants that weren't hand-me-downs from Dudley had brought real tears to his eyes.
The Dark Lord had marked Father's wand arm because of course he had.
Appropriately enough, really.
"Yes," Harry said and then laughed breathlessly. "Wow, it feels kind of good to actually say it. I mean, I couldn't say it to Ron or Hermione. They don't understand. Dumbledore sent me back here. I asked, I really did, whether I could go anywhere else. And he sent me back here. I guess he doesn't know."
Besides, he didn't want to displace Mother, at least not until Mother said that she wanted something different.
There was a bond. He and Harry were already bound together, soul to soul. Draco licked his lips as he rolled onto his back.
"Curse damage," Moody said as if he didn't believe it.
Draco shrank their brooms, pocketing them. He looked and felt as nervous as Harry, peering around the statue as if he expected them to be attacked at any second.
Ivy popped in. She patted Draco's hand and then gently nudged him towards Father. Draco swallowed down the acid curdling up the back of his throat. Father smelled of vomit and alcohol mixed with stale sweat. His wand arm twitched as Draco approached.
"Is the bond," Ivy said while patting Draco's knee and Harry's hand. "You is needing more time together. Ivy thinks you needs to cuddle up and talk and sleep. In morning, should have all the hidden holy books back. Grandfather Arcturus will have news. Professor Kitty should be awake again and Master Wolfy will not be biting anyone anymore."
Screams echoed around him. Mother's screams had come first, high and piercing. Then her sobs. He'd abandoned the library at that point, all but running down the great staircase to escape the sound of her pain and sorrow.
"Yes, we are," Draco agreed. "A prayer for mourning. One to celebrate a new marriage. One to… call down the moon?"
"Which means…" Draco paused, heart lurching as he decided to test it. "Tippy!"
Lord Black grunted, eyes narrowing even further. "Where's that idiot you married?"
"I utterly loathe you," Draco complained, arms crossed over his chest as he pouted.
Inside, it was warm and welcoming. The walls were whitewashed, yes, but everything tended towards lovely deep sapphire blue, ruby red, emerald green. Most of the furniture was covered with old leather that had worn as soft as silk with time. The rug in Draco's bedroom was so plush that he'd stopped and just stood there, letting his feet sink into it.
He studied what the wards were telling him and then cast ostende mihi so that Mother and Grandfather Arcturus could see it, too. Draco blew up the little notation that showed what spells were on each of them. Normally it was a minor matter that a patriarch would only pay attention to if the wards found something harmful.
"Last turn," Harry gasped to Draco who nodded and wheezed.
He stepped forward and put his hands on the ward stone before bowing his head. Draco pushed his magic into the ward stone, feeling for the wards. There was a key to them. Father had said many times that a proper ward complex had a key to them. He'd never allowed Draco to learn what that key might be.
"Dumbledore's done something already," Draco complained. "I'm more comfortable not touching you than I am pressed against your side. He's already reactivated the warped blessing in some way. The spell he's working right now must be to extend his control spells over everyone once more."
"Master should not be reading those!" Ivy popped in, snatching the book right out of Draco's hands. "Is not for young wizards! You is waiting until you is grown up for these."
Tippy popped into the circle of the cloak, immediately wrapping his arms around Harry and Draco's legs. "Tippy does not like it here!"
"Dobby did," Dobby declared. He crossed his arms across his chest and glowered at Silverclaw. "Dobby is very proud to be the Great Harry Potter's elf. Very proud!"
Dobby popped back in and nodded vigorously.  "Dobby will do so. He will get Blue and Cooper and Lilac to help. We will all makes sure that they eat."
Draco barely even paused when Ivy popped in and swapped Draco's emerald green silk pajamas for a dreadfully stylish set of greenish-grey trousers, a silver-grey shirt and an open robe in a faintly yellowish green that was the exact same style as Harry's.
"We found it in Filch's office," Fred explained. "It was created by Prongs, Padfoot, Mooney and Wormtail, not that we've any idea who they were. They're… right snarky when you try and ask too many questions about their secret identities. But it's never been wrong that we've seen. Granted, we can't exactly whip it out and look at it all that often. Don't want to get it confiscated so we only use it when we absolutely have to."
It was Harry and Harry was it.
Blood welled up in his palm. It seemed shot through with stars. Wild magic. So much magic.
"As you wish," Grandpa Arcturus said. "Cooper! Prepare a cell for Professor McGonagall. She'll be staying the night."
"I'm ready," Harry declared, locking his eyes on Draco. "Get this thing out of me right now."
"He doesn't want to be free," Draco whispered as he shoved the grand parlor door open and then shut it quietly, carefully.  He'd never said it out loud before.
"No, I was describing my Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon," Harry said.
"Oh, no," Draco said as Moody set him down and then gripped the back of his jumper. "I can stand!"
Harry shook it off, putting a hand on Dobby's shoulder. "I need you there with the twins so that I can link to you and you can link to them. Our bonds are important too, you know. Draco's to Ivy and mine to you. It's part of it. Probably."
"Right, so, Mum's been mad on the idea of you joining the family," Charlie said as he pushed Percy down next to Ron and shoved tea into his hands. He had to help Percy drink because Percy was as shaky as Hermione had been. "She already thinks of you as family and we've, Bill and I, been trying to figure out where that came from."
It took another two attempts before the wards saw the cloak. And then another three attempts before they could see any magical influences on it. Harry frowned at how weak and flickering the ward results were.
"What's happening with Remus and Professor McGonagall?" Harry asked Mr. Swashlin.
"Neville," Harry agreed. "Susan Bones. So, see if we can get allies? See if we can gather support before Dumbledore finds out?"
The magic swept through him. Out and out and out, touching all the magi, all the warped blessings.
The moment where Harry stared at his hand on the train and looked back into Draco's face with nothing but scorn.
Dobby's special tea was so dark it lurked like a puddle of ink in the cup and tasted like the sludge from under the rocks in the Malfoy pond. It was heaven. Pure, unadulterated heaven. Draco hadn't tasted anything better in his whole life.
Not always though. Like with stealing Dobby, sometimes his temper flared up in weird ways. The longer he was away from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, the more obvious it was that his "inexplicable temper tantrums" were actually responses to the abuse he'd gotten.
Harry grinned. "Well, let's do it again. That's what Dobby suggested, anyway."
Besides, elves saw things so differently that he might see or hear or know something that Harry didn't.
"Dobby."
"That was the two of you nearly forming a soul bond," Grandpa Arcturus said.
"You'd pray," Harry said. He pointed at Mrs. Malfoy whose cheeks had started going redder and redder. "Is that a thing? I mean, I don't know much about religion. Aunt Petunia used to say that I'd burst into flame if I went into a church, but it didn't stop her from dragging me and Dudley to services at Christmas. But only then. They didn't do church most of the time."
It was as if the air had been sucked out of the sitting room. Lord Black went absolutely still. Even his hands, too thin for a man in his prime, went still on the folio he'd been holding. Then his eyes opened all the way and Draco jerked Mother back a step as he realized that no, those weren't Lord Black's eyes.
"I think we should go up to the battlements," Draco said. "There was a pocket in the war wards up there, like it was a spot for taking messages or something? I saw it when Grandfather was setting the floo to allow a single message to the DOM and Gringotts."
Harry hugged him so tight that Draco wheezed. And got hugged back so hard that his back popped. Letting go was so very not easy but eventually they did. Draco slipped out from under the cloak, pale hair bright against the darkness of the stairwell.
She grinned. "Late morning sounds perfect, Mr. Malfoy. Off to bed with both of you before I'm tempted to take preemptive points from the both of you."
Harry's voice drifted through from his suite, tempting Draco to get up from the couch and go see what Harry found so fascinating. They'd napped after saving Remus, eaten a small mountain of food while Dobby watched them all with an eagle's eye, then napped some more before coming to the Manor. Draco shouldn't be tired.
Mother hadn't managed to remove the Dark Mark. Again. If she'd succeeded, if Father was free, Mother wouldn't have been tortured. And Father wouldn't be tortured by the Dark Lord right this instant for daring to dream of a life free from that monstrosity's control.
Remus. Professor McGonagall. Grandpa Arcturus.
Wait, what?
Mrs. Malfoy's hands flew to her mouth. She shuddered, shaking her head like she absolutely forbid them to even consider letting Remus in. Harry thought about it for a second and then nodded to Dobby before tapping the ward spell to let Remus in.
That was a huge relief. Harry blew out a breath, turning back to Fangtooth and the healing. Still lots of chanting and lots of magic that looked like Harry's swirling around but no progress that he could see. Or feel. Yet.
Of everyone in Harry's life now that he was free, he trusted Dobby most of all. They'd saved each other. They'd made a choice and stolen each other from the respective hells that they'd been trapped in. Draco was second, especially as their magic and soulbond slowly drew them together.
