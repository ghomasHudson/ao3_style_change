“But I want to know who sends Malfoy cards like this!”
Harry grimaced. “As I said. Complicated.”
“No,” Harry said without looking up.
Um... yay, I'm not dead?
, a violently purple triple-decker bus appeared in front of him and came to a screeching halt.
“And you were never fired, so,
They bolted for the safe.
Then Draco finally noticed that he wasn't the only one whose skin had a flush, or the only one who was breathing a little faster than normal. He was still the worse for wear, but it was undeniable that what had happened had an effect on Potter as well.
“But if she died that long ago –”
“It’s nice to meet you both,” said Harry. “I’m Har-Henry.”
Draco had no idea what to say to that, so instead he took Potter by the elbow and apparated them both to the first spot he could think of that had no lampposts. It happened to be the park where Granger had brought him that first day when he hadn’t been able to wrap his mind around the idea of Potter being alive. Snow was falling here, too.
“What about Rose?” Weasley proposed.
What a strange sort of freedom this was.
fine,” Pansy said. “
“Doing alright though, yeah?” Harry asks.
“And?”
“Merlin, I hate you, Potter,” Draco murmurs. It sounds fond instead of vicious.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Of course not!” Weasley sounded positively scandalized.
“That’s different,” Potter said, although he failed to clarify just
“You’re not doing well,” Victoria observed.
He fled but had barely reached the living room before Potter caught up to him.
“What are you three doing?” asked a dreamy voice.
“Mrow,” Evadne confirmed. Her slightly moist nose tickled Harry as she touched it gently to the skin below his jaw. She sneezed.
“Calm down, he says! Ha!”
“How long would that last?” Granger asked, sounding suddenly eager.
“Oh, Pansy just thought you’d never stop arguing if she told you.” Blaise waves it off as no big deal. “Or try to talk her out of it. She figured if it worked, you’d come around eventually.”
“I…I…I d-didn’t…didn’t mean…Draco!” Harry stammered.
“You,” Draco whispered, and prayed Harry hadn't heard him over the rolling thunder.
is better than bubble wrap.
“She didn’t really make any mistakes in the first place,” Draco pointed out. “I can’t fault her for anything I saw in that memory.”
“Yes, but this doesn’t exactly…I…I have some debts, you see. Not a lot, but more than my allowance can cover, and I decided to ask her to cover them, just this once, and she said she wouldn’t. We argued, June came to my aid. My mother insulted June, and then we were all shouting at each other. At some point, she collapsed. It must have been the stress that got to her.”
of you. You don’t mean it, he doesn’t mean it…stop me if you see where I’m going with this.”
Holly, phoenix feather, eleven inches.
“Zach, shut up,” Granger said.
“Malfoy, tell me,” Harry says, and his voice is uncharacteristically gentle.
A month ago, however, some complete fuckwit in administration had decided to change the display, and now the glass case held a much more depressing memento – a single wand on a cushion of gold-trimmed red velvet.
“It's not the same,” Thomas muttered. “Not even a little bit.”
She tucked the strip of parchment back into the book. “You still haven’t told me why you’re here, you know.”
a chance someone could put us in stasis before we die.”
“If she delivers the message and works with Victoria, do you think they could do it in time?”
“Yes, you’re a regular saint.”
“Hi,” Draco breathed. He mentally rolled his eyes at himself for sounding like a fainting maiden.
Draco cleared his throat as loudly as he could, which earned him a disapproving look from Babs. “Are you
“Mione, no offence, but could you just…get to the point, please, yeah?” Harry interrupted her.
“What is it doing on my coffee table?”
“I’m more concerned about her digesting a gold nugget,” Harry said with a grin.
“I told you it was a bad idea! Who was it that demanded you take it down, Fernsby?”
“Oh, dear,” says Parkinson. “It looks like the stress is getting the better of this reformed bad boy, dear audience.”
“He certainly won’t wake before the morning,” sighed the matron. “In the meantime, we can do nothing but hope he will make a full recovery.” She turned to the professor. “Thank you for coming so quickly. I really don’t know how I would have stopped the bleeding.”
“Yes, Potter, only. It’s utterly awful, of course it is, but she can still have a proper life, even if she has to re-learn everything and it’s bound to be difficult. If the poison had also stopped her forming new memories – imagine it, not having any memories at all, not able to form new ones…”
“Yes, Blaise, Potter found it.”
He fumbled his way through making tea, but was cheered up by the fact that Granger had bothered to bring the
He’d spent days trying to figure out which set of robes brought out his eyes the best, done copious amounts of research barely related to the topic they were supposed to be discussing, just in case it came up in conversation. He’d imagined all the ways the meeting might go, had
could have known, not even me. I only found out when I went home and checked, last night. It’s…I don’t know if they’re some form of divination, or…”
Harry blinked at her. “Sorry, what spell is that?”
“No.”
“Of course you would go for something so offensively Gryffindorish,” Draco muttered and regarded the shimmering ornament Harry seemed inexplicably fond of.
“Absolutely not. My chart showed a high likelihood that she’s involved in some way.”
Everyone looked at Harry very intently.
The panicked yelp he received in answer felt very satisfying indeed.
Draco hadn't expected it. Maybe that was why his knees went so weak, and he leaned against Potter with an embarrassing gurgling whimper, the sound bouncing through the room. His hair was still being pulled, and now Potter's teeth were sending his nerve endings a different sort of pain, and both of these together sent him spiraling away from anything resembling coherency. Heat rose up in him, all the way from his toes to the top of his head, and he could feel his skin flushing. He was hard, suddenly, achingly hard, and he couldn't bring himself to be embarrassed about it. He was too busy savoring the sensations and reaching the high of pain and pleasure that seemed to be what he lived for these days.
Potter turned his way very abruptly. “You can’t be serious. You never went back, not once?”
Harry tries to make sense of them. Apparently, he’ll need to make two batters, then divide them both in half again and add varying amounts of cocoa to each. There’s caramel involved as well, of course, and chocolate icing. He can’t imagine the result, whatever it is, will be worth the effort.
“It can’t be taken down by anything at all?”
At twenty-two minutes, Granger started crying with sheer relief and smiled through her tears.
It was covered in writing. Most of it, Draco couldn’t make out – his eyes seemed to slide away whenever he tried to focus on a specific spot. The Unspeakables had probably obscured it with a spell, deciding it was none of Draco’s business. But on the back of Potter’s hand, the black letters were large and clear.
“Is there a chance they’ll mix together while they’re in the blood?”
“If you get to have help from Granger, then I get to use ‘Expelliarmus, Santa Claus’,” Draco decreed.
The boy looked up, startled. “W-w-what?” was all he could stutter.
“What do you need, Malfoy? Forgiveness? Because you have mine.”
Draco shrugged. He couldn’t deny that it had been quite an interesting challenge, but when Granger had asked for a list of the potions Potter still needed and whether there was anything else she needed to know about the rest of the recovery process, he had realized that his time in the Department of Mysteries was at an end. There was no reason for him to stick around. Neither a healer nor a potioneer was needed any longer, and he couldn’t expect them to let him stay here for the fun of it. Besides, he had patients to get back to.
you the message, or at least leaving it well enough alone, she’s been trying to decipher it. And she’s refusing to acknowledge that it’s not her place. They’re on
“And yet they trust you to conduct interviews without Auror guidance or supervision,” she said, and then her eyes slid to Harry standing unobtrusively off to the side and she smiled in that knowing way again.
Draco held his breath, and for a moment, he thought he might have been wrong about the encryption method, but then the inked numbers slowly began to transform.
“Harry,” she said, looking upset, “you can’t possibly believe I don’t know you’re trying to keep me talking until the barrier comes down. I’m not a fool. I’m sorry, you’re a good person and I really am crushed I have to do this to you.
“Makes sense, I suppose,” Potter says. “McGonagall did keep going on about unity and friendship and looking beyond our school houses during the welcoming feast. I’m impressed she took the initiative. That’s probably what caused everyone else to make an effort, too.”
After several minutes that felt like ages to Harry, he reached his destination. Twisting, he rammed his shoulder into the door to open it, resting Malfoy’s head in the crook of his neck to prevent it from bumping into something. Madam Pomfrey, having heard the door, was already hurrying toward them, horror on her face as she recognized the students - one, unconscious, pale, and covered in blood, being carried by the other.
Draco lifted his hands, spread his fingers apart and whispered dramatically, “Magic!”
The two of them look at each other and their eyes widen.
“Neither do I,” said Draco, but they’re not going to come when I’m this tired, either.”
“I am absolute pants at Wizard’s chess, and I hate playing. Ron would know in five seconds that I’m just pretending.”
“The first one wasn’t our fault, you know, Lyman Selwyn is just a colossal arsehole,” Harry interjected.
Parvati said her goodbyes and allowed Granger to walk her to the door. Draco found the ensuing silence moderately awkward, but it might have just been his imagination, since he couldn’t get the memory of the noises Harry had made just before his orgasm out of his head.
year table in the Great Hall, but they managed surprisingly well, and since the two of them feuding was nothing out of the ordinary, no one paid them the slightest bit of attention, which suited Draco just fine.
“Because… because…” Draco tried to wrestle the words in his head into some form that would make sense when he spoke them aloud. “Because you won’t always want me,” he said eventually. “And I can’t deal with that. I can’t.”
“Rowan berries.” She stretched out her hand and cupped the delicate cluster of red berries to show them.
“My point is,” she continued, oblivious to his shock, “that you two were helping each other heal. I want Harry to be happy. He’s earned it. He was well on his way, but now he’s backslid into brooding and his temper is just horrid. I need to know how I can help fix this.”
Harry isn’t sure for what. He wonders if Draco knows it, himself.
Later in the day though, he couldn’t help himself. He stuffed a few bites of food into his mouth during dinner and then hurried out of the Great Hall, knowing without turning around that he was being followed.
“Draco,” Hermione said and came hurrying up to him. “I…you’re pale. Are you feeling dizzy?”
“Can you find out?” she asked.
“It’s alright, I can…I can wait for some rain to loosen the earth a bit, or until Hermione finds a spell, or something,” Harry said. "Just…try to get me out of here before Draco comes home, that’s all I ask.”
“Oh,” everyone said at once, disappointedly. Then, “Bless you!” when Evadne sneezed once more as she came wandering back to them.
“I don’t know, Blaise,” Draco said tiredly. “And it’s really none of my business. It’s not like I’ll be around for much longer in any case.”
“I'll do whatever I like,” Draco said slowly, savoring the words. His temple throbbed. He was still shaking.
“Right,” Selwyn said weakly.
They hurried to get to the closest side street so they could apparate, then from the St Mungo’s lobby up to the ward where Draco worked. He knew that things hadn’t gone as well as he’d hoped as soon as they entered Bones’ room and saw the faces of everyone in it – the two Aurors, Victoria, a glamoured Harry and Susan Bones herself, who was sitting up in her bed and regarding them with a dazed, lost look on her face
“Not what I saw under the microscope,” said Draco. “This one is fast.”
Instead of telling him, Granger rounded the body and reached out, before hesitating and glancing at Zacharias Smith, who sat on a stool by the far wall with his wand raised.
to explain."

“They’re for reading, Weasley, you should try it some time.”
“He’s an ex-Auror,” Draco said.
“So it's punishment.”
“Mostly. The Room of Requirement isn’t on there.” Potter frowned. “I don’t even know if that still exists. I never bothered to find out.”
Draco thinks about it. “That sounds nice, actually.”
“What did you tell Molly, anyway?” Harry asked. “I can’t imagine it went over particularly well when you said you wouldn’t be coming to dinner.”
“Eloquent, as always,” Parkinson chirps. “Anyway, Granger at the bottom, followed by a three-way tie between Ernie Macmillan, Draco Malfoy, and the Chosen One himself, Harry Potter…who’s giving me a murderous look right now because he doesn’t like when people call him that, and I definitely was not supposed to.” She winces.
Potter was close to a grin now. Draco gave himself a mental pat on the back. Then he wondered why he cared so much.
“I will, yes,” she said and stopped abruptly. Draco turned toward her and watched as she dug in her purse and eventually pulled out a glossy red envelope.
Weasley’s eyes went wide. “Your
The cut wasn’t terribly deep, thank Merlin. But it wouldn’t stop bleeding, which worried the school nurse a lot. She tried several different charms to close the wound, without success, which told her that the curse that had hit the student had been dark. When Holly came rushing back with the proper potion – Draco had blood type 1 4 like most purebloods – the matron took it from her and sent her to fetch Severus.
Potter’s eyes widened. “I’m telling the truth! I found it in a book along with the words ‘for enemies’, nothing more, and I thought…”
“No.” Draco reached for his water, hand brushing the book Granger had been reading. He glanced at it and frowned at the title. “Cryptography?”
“They…did?”
The defeated tone made Draco sigh deeply. Harry glanced at him, then away. Abruptly, he stopped. “Bollocks.”
“Help me figure out how to do the actual time travel, then!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hank Partridge,” Potter said. “I’m actually related to Rita, she’s my second cousin. And let me tell you, she has only gotten more vicious with age. You wouldn't
“The small bit of good news is that the poison doesn’t seem to start affecting the memory immediately,” Draco pointed out. “Longbottom said she was fine until she lost consciousness – scared, obviously, but there were no noticeable cognitive issues at all. And it’s only retrograde amnesia.”
“Right, ‘course not, you only saved my life, after all,” Harry said amicably.
“Hermione says Muggle marker," said Potter. He slid a bit closer. His elbow was probably starting to hurt from the way Draco was holding his arm. “She cast a preservation charm so I could take showers without washing it off by accident.”
Because nobody blushed when they talked about kittens.
“Great.” Draco unwrapped his scarf from around his neck and tossed it over the back of the closest armchair. Then he froze. “What, by Merlin’s hairy bollocks, is that?”
“I know,” Draco said, and slumped even more. “I’m completely fucked. And…oh, Merlin, it just occurred to me that I’m even more fucked than I thought, because there was a
Harry looks at her, baffled. “Did you forget your own?”
, Ron?”
Harry’s patchy ganache is deservedly criticized by them, but he isn’t the only one whose cake has issues. Unsurprisingly, Hermione’s dry stack of sponges performs the worst, but they don’t like Ernie’s cake either, which has soupy caramel sauce all over the place. Harry doesn’t blame them, it’s a pretty disgusting sight, the watery sauce dripping from his serving stand onto the table and from there onto the floor. Draco’s “semi-naked” creation with the ganache on the inside confuses them, and they wonder out loud if perhaps the baker misread the instructions. They are not happy that Neville mixed up the order of his sponges, either, but they compliment the wavy pattern that Luna has somehow managed to make into the frosting. Padma’s cake is near-perfect, neat as a pin, but the one of which the judges are the fondest is Goyle’s.
“Cristina said they had just gotten back from their holiday the day before,” Hermione added. “Spain.”
Unfortunately, the fact that he was aware of it only made things worse. Draco was not used to second-guessing himself constantly, but here he was, agonizing about how much space he should leave between them as he walked down the snowy lane next to Potter. Was it indecent to hope their hands might brush? Would Potter worry that Draco disliked him if he shifted to the left? Would it alarm him if Draco dropped to his knees right here and screamed his frustration into the pale blue sky?
“Potter, bring the book here!” he growled into the silence,
Selwyn frowned and actually seemed to think about the question for a while. He stared into the distance and eventually moistened his lips.
It’s Draco’s, which Harry would have known even without the sharp intake of breath he hears to his immediate right. Ron, amusingly, describes the cake in enthusiastic and complimentary fashion. Harry assumes he’ll wish to get his hands on a time turner as soon as he figures out who made it.
“Show me,” she said, and pushed her chair back. “I haven’t done complex antidotes since sixth year, but I’m sure it’ll come back to me soon enough.”
“No,” Draco said simply, and that wasn’t so much bragging as it was true. There was a reason St Mungo’s had agreed to employ him despite his less-than-stellar past.
Draco banged his head against the wall. It seemed to be the best answer to that inane statement, and it helped a little in letting him come back to himself.
“You know, if you hadn’t warned me that your husband was working on a tree illusion, I’d have sworn that was real,” Draco said. The medium-sized spruce was standing in the spot where the fireplace had been the day before. It was covered in snow and decorated with bronze and white star-patterned ornaments, classy and lovely. Draco was surprised by Weasley’s restraint. He would have thought, if anything, his idea of a decorated Christmas tree would have looked like a group of five-year-olds had gone crazy with parchment, scissors, and an assortment of Witch Winnifred’s Glitterific Practice Wands.
“Is it really alright?” he asked.
Potter blurts, “Flying!”
And then Malfoy had gone and decided it was a kitten.
“Anything?” Harry was still staring at his candy cane. “’Wreath’. There. What did I win?”
It’s lucky that the two of you were so wrapped up in each other that you never noticed much else.”
“What was that?” Potter asked.
A dull pain bloomed in his chest every time he laid eyes on it, a harsh reminder of the stunned shock that had crashed through him and the entire wizarding population when Harry Potter had died. Draco had never even spoken to the Saviour after the war trials, but seven years of shared history meant that Potter’s death had hit him hard just the same.
“What the bloody buggering fuck?” he hears Draco mutter, and can’t resist a snort of amusement.
“That it’s
Potter’s throat moved, and a soft, broken keening sound made its way through his slightly parted lips.
“How exactly does Granger claim to know this?” Draco asked once they were seated, both clutching mugs that contained more Firewhisky than tea.
More quill scratching. Draco tried to tune it out as he thought.
have covered his tracks if he had decided to go around poisoning people. One of the drawers had a lock that wouldn’t yield until he’d cast three different unlocking spells on it, which seemed promising, but the contents of the drawer weren’t what Draco would have called suspicious – several carefully folded performance evaluations, a coin purse, a muggle novel with a swooning heroine on the cover whose dress was rather revealing. Draco thumbed through it just for the sake of being thorough, but the only thing he found was an old photograph that Clearwater had apparently been using as a bookmark. It showed her – a younger her, she couldn’t have been long out of Hogwarts – next to an older man who might have been a relative. Both of them were smiling unenthusiastically.
sane person would blame me,” Blaise reiterated, finished untying his cashmere scarf and handed it to Draco with the air of someone who expected to be waited on. He’d earned the right, if talking to Narcissa had been anywhere near as awkward as Draco imagined.
“That’s actually what I wanted to speak to you about. I’ll need a type of stirring rod I don’t have, and ordinarily I would owl-order it, but those always take a while to be processed, and I’d like to avoid delays.”
“Wonder if that refers to the victims,” Draco thought out loud.
Clara gave them a watery smile. “Thanks. But you didn’t come just to hear me complaining, did you? What can I do for you?”
Potter bolted for the nearest lamppost.
Clearwater turned and bolted for the lift as Harry grabbed Draco’s wrist and pulled, and then they were running into one of the corridors.
"Yes, I know what an ultrasound is. Well...I have a very general idea, let's put it that way. I've heard of them, but no more than that.
“And that is what happened, isn’t it?” Theo says with a pointed look at Draco’s hand, which is still entwined with Potter’s.
“Oh, no, not at all. But I am worried that the unicorn hair core is going to react badly with the flavorings. The basil, especially. Unicorns aren’t very fond of it, after all, and if my spellwork is off, I won’t get the balance just right.”
“Well,” Potter said, muffled, “maybe you say that every time.”
“Do that,” Harry said with a grin.
. You lot need to order those in bulk for the department.”
Draco took one step into Granger’s office and then stopped abruptly. “Has that always been there?”
“Malfoy,” someone called out. He tried to make himself smaller, but then there was a warm hand on his shoulder.
“Fine,” she said. “But that doesn’t include Hermione and Ron.”
“Oh!” said Sky. “And you’re secretly in love with him, so you’re hurt and upset.”
Potter, who was sitting by himself on the sofa, looked up at that. He was very pale and his eyes had a haunted look to them.
Draco moved to lay it aside, then frowned and took another look because he’d realized that the man looked very, very vaguely familiar. It was the frizzy grey hair that rang a bell, because Draco could remember thinking once upon a time that it took ‘bird’s nest’ to a whole new level – one that looked almost literal, like upon closer inspection, one was likely to find a number of speckled grey eggs, neatly cushioned. It had prompted Draco to, for his own amusement, take a seat higher up in the auditorium where the…oh, right, the man had been a special guest lecturer, talking about –
“Ah, well.” Harry adjusted his glasses in endearing fashion. “I’ve been writing down what we’ve found out about the poisoner and the victims – and about possible motives Marielle, Zach or Penny might have had. This entire thing is getting too bloody complicated for me to follow along.”
Draco tried to recall what else Granger had said about writing new messages. “Remember that we also can’t risk changing the timeline more than a slight bit.”
Potter jerks against Draco, just once, and Draco turns his head to whisper at him to calm down, but they’re too close and Potter’s cheek is right there, and Draco’s lips brush against it entirely by accident. Potter jerks again.
"Granger, my lab -"
There was a very good reason Draco hadn’t been sorted Gryffindor, but maybe, just this once, he could act like one.
“There were more notes that helped me figure out the poison,” Draco added. “And other things that nobody could have known.”
“Ah, right. Fuck.”
fine glittering particles, suspended and unmoving.
she was about the entire thing, that she didn’t see –
The True Stasis spell cost more power to cast, needed an extremely skillful caster, and the mind needed to be sharply focused to keep it going. Draco didn’t even know the incantation for it. He was, however, willing to bet Smith had been switching off with another Unspeakable; there was no way he could have held the charm for more than an hour at a time, and that was a generous estimate on Draco’s part.
“Susan doing alright?” Granger asked.
“It’s the reason I ran away, that first day I saw the other one,” Potter said. Draco heard him as though they were standing in a large, echoing cave. “I had painted, well, it was something I imagined, about you and me, and then you said it that you thought it was a kitten, and that was a bit upsetting, to be honest. I…Malfoy? Are you…are you really mad at me? I’m sorry I didn’t just tell you, I really am, I didn’t know how.”
“No,” Kingsley said.
Blaise, who had just stepped through the Floo and then promptly handed Draco a potted plant and a satchel, said nothing, but he smiled at him in a way Draco found rather suspicious.
“Accio card!” Pansy called, poking her wand in a direction that seemed altogether random. Nothing happened, and she shrugged at the incredulous look Draco gave her. “Well, it was worth a try.”
“No shit, Potter,” Draco snaps, because once again Potter is being such an idiot that Draco just wants to push him back against the wall and…do something to him. He’s not sure what, but it’ll be painful. Probably. For some reason, the idea of biting Potter’s full lower lip pops into his head, even though that’s a bit of a strange way to punish someone’s stupidity.
Draco sighed. “Not since the battle,” he said quietly.
He was despairing. What should he do? He didn’t know any healing spells; he couldn’t even
Pansy stared at him for a long moment before she said, “I can’t wait for you to tell Minister Shacklebolt that he has a depraved mind,”
“I want you to take proper care of yourself. I can't hurt you if you're already hurting yourself, if you're not strong enough.”
“You seem preoccupied.”
“Roll,” Goyle grunts, who seems to have forgotten he has a wand available, because he is busy whisking his egg whites into submission by hand. It’s quite the intimidating sight.
“That wasn’t my guess!”
“Oi!” Harry protested.
“I’ve got an invisibility cloak.”
Draco had never seen it, of course, but he knew the rumors, and he’d heard retellings of the battle that had happened here at the end of his fifth year. Those made it seem impossible enough.
Harry banged his forehead on the grass, which was not as dramatic as he’d hoped because it didn’t even make a good
“Well, yes,” said Harry.
“Hm?” she asked and stopped staring into space. “Oh, sorry, I’m still thinking about how the time travel might have been possible. It’s just…
Clara shook her head and reached for a tissue. This seemed to take a lot out of her, and Draco thought he had almost everything on the poison that she could give him. He would have to check whether any of the men Secretary Fletcher had been meeting with had shown signs of illness; if the poison had been aerosolized, they might have inhaled a small dose of it, not enough to truly harm.
“That can’t be right,” he mutters.
“Sorry, I, er…” Harry was far more rattled than he should have been by that revelation. “Can we…can we finish this some other time?”
She smirked at him. “Of course it will,
“Granger?” be forced out after a moment of stunned silence.
“Oh, well, that makes it all better. Forgive me for being the slightest bit concerned that an item I’m responsible for has somehow found its way into your house without me even being aware that it was missing, because that
bad news for you.”
“What?”
She adjusted the grip on her wand and nodded.
“Good wand wood too,” Draco contributed. “Known for –”
“Has worked wonders when a direct confrontation never did!” she interrupted him. “Turns out that in some ways, the Slytherins had it right all along. All I’m doing is using their methods to stop those who deserve to be stopped.”
Granger looked down at her plate. “That…that was all there was. Truly.”
This was going to be interesting.
“Potter, I don’t know how to put this delicately,” Pansy said as she picked her way carefully, putting weight onto her sparkly heels only after she’d tested and made sure there was solid ground beneath every step and not another gnomehole hidden in the grass, “but I think you have a problem.”
“Full of hot air, that one – can’t picture him actually going through with something like this.”
Draco nodded sharply.
“Parkinson asked me to go to Hogsmeade with her. Hogsmeade! Parkinson!”
“Found it,” Blaise said flatly. “Potter found it.”
Harry frowned. “Isn’t that basically the sa –”
“Okay,” he said now, carefully brushing off the bit of soot that clung to his robes.
“Who might sell one of those?”
Draco walked past Blaise and dropped back onto the sofa. “What do you want me to say here, exactly? I don’t know how it happened. I don’t know who did it – not me or Potter, I can tell you that much.”
Hermione buried her face in her hands.
On the way to the office, a harassed-looking Granger passed him by. She didn’t look at him, clutching a thick folder like a lifeline. Draco tried for a neutral face and a nod, but it was lost on her.
Granger was indeed in the Space Room, which Draco had never actually seen the inside of. She seemed to be observing Saturn, standing in a corner and directing the spin of the rings with her wand. Draco was not at all surprised by the floating planets in the vast, dark room – it was sort of in the name, really – but he certainly hadn’t expected to be lifted off the floor after he’d taken three steps.
Draco opens his mouth, but the clever idea he’s expecting does not do him the favour of popping into existence.
“Well this is exciting,” Molly Weasley says when the judges enter the tent once again. “Ombre cakes. Very modern.” Then she reaches the table, and her smile dims a little. “Oh. Oh dear.”
Draco had rarely been so relieved for a shift to be over. The golden fairy lights twinkled warmly overhead as he changed out of his lime green robe, but they couldn’t chase away the icy feeling in him that was burrowing bone deep. He didn’t bother to hold in a sigh.
Harry sags, bangs his forehead on the counter, and thanks Merlin it’s over.
“This looks lovely,” Molly says fondly of the first roll. “A bit clumsy, maybe, but certainly made with love.”
Draco swallowed hard. “And they’re sure Potter didn’t manage to escape from that basement somehow?”
“Oh,” Granger said. “But –”
An hour after the battle is finished, Harry is still wondering what he’s supposed to be feeling right now.
“What
As I mentioned in a recent comment reply for the previous chapter, I have mixed feelings about participating in the fandom these days. My enjoyment has been severely dampened by certain insensitive and damaging comments that I cannot overlook, no matter how much I'd love to separate the art from the artist. I needed a sense of comfort throughout the past year that Harry Potter can unfortunately no longer give me. But it would be blatantly unfair to abandon a work such as Timecode, so I'm working on getting the remaining chapters finished and posted. I'm sorry for the long wait, I really am. I hope you understand.
They were quietly and lovingly bickering with each other, and it seemed an appropriate time for Draco to leave. He withdrew from the room without another word and returned to his temporary quarters to rest. He would have tried to actually sleep, but he was certain that racing thoughts of cairns and Voldemort and Harry dying would prevent him from it for hours to come.
Severus snorted in disbelief. “There are plenty of other spells which will accomplish that – or even your fists.”
"So could you please tell me then what in Merlin's name you're doing here, Blaise? Did Potter invite you to come?"
“Clearly. I haven’t got the time for a chat anyway, I’m due at Robards’ office – probably to get shouted at for not having invented a mind-reading device that the aurors can use, or whatever. In case you’re gone by the time I get back…” He shrugged, and the corner of his mouth quirked up. “Still on for pub night day after tomorrow?”
Draco wished so very much that they might come up with a plan that had a few less massive holes in it. “Maybe, but how the bloody fuck are we going to get
Draco, meanwhile, rescued the owl from the weather, took the letter, and dug out owl treats from a drawer of his nightstand.
“There, see.” The girl elbowed him gently. “He’s made your day a little better, hasn’t he?”
him.”
“Let’s go to the post office,” Potter said, and that was when Draco realized Potter had been looking at him while Draco’s zoned-out gaze had been fixed on Potter’s lips. His face heated immediately.
“Alright,” Hermione said eventually, produced a little Muggle notebook from her purse and tapped it thrice with her wand. "This will record for us - now talk me through what's in your head. I'm assuming it has something to do with the antidote?"
Harry sighed and sat comfortably on the floor, close to Draco. “Tell me what they said,” he requested – no, Draco realized suddenly, he was
“That’s what I thought.”
“No, I…well, yes. Sorry, I don’t mean to dismiss what you’re telling me, but there’s just so much on my mind right now. I talked to Hermione.”
“What?”
Pansy cleared her throat. “Harry, I have some bad news for you,” she said.
“You’re telling me!”
“My roommate,” he admitted.
“Her morning coffee and a scone, I think. That’s what she usually brought in.”
“Maybe it’s advertising something,” the man suggested, rounding the box and looking it up and down. “Not sure what it would be though.”
“Watch closely,” he said.
“Oh,” Granger breathed, and clutched his arm. “Draco, I, I…thank you for doing this.”
Holly, phoenix feather, eleven inches.
“It’s temporary. He’ll find his own place soon, but for now he’s in my guest room. And I don’t mind, really I don’t, but things are complicated between us, and it’s only getting worse.” He grimaced. “Yesterday…was interesting. I felt things I wasn’t expecting.”
“Simply point your wand at the floor,” said Granger, who had come over to them. “Now, please, Draco. You’re sending salad and…is that tahini sauce? – floating toward Mercury.”
It had never felt so significant before.
“Possibly, but there’s no way to be sure.”
Harry pointed at a stack of books on the desk that hadn’t been there the day before. “She’s literally searched every available book on arithmancy and magical secret messages. She’s ready to tear her hair out.”
“Yes. He just…he just fell out.”
“Maybe,” Weasley said tentatively, “maybe it somehow looks at it…like there’s two Harrys?”
“What kind of way?” Smith asked, still sounding sceptical.
For this round, Harry has found a recipe for something called Spanish apple cake. It features almonds, apples – obviously – and plenty of rum along with the usual cake ingredients, all underneath a crust of simple icing sugar and lemon juice. He races to get the apples diced and soaking in the rum, trying to ignore the hectic rush all around him. Making the cake is less than half the battle for this round, and he needs to focus on it. Otherwise, he won’t have enough time to finish the biscuits and the spellwork that is supposed to help him stand out.
Snape seemed to be able to read his thoughts. In a threatening tone, he said, “No arguments, Potter! You will bring it here within the next five minutes, otherwise you will not enjoy the consequences.”
“No, not that.”
The poison has a thrice-damned trigger.”
Then came the day when Slughorn paired them together in Potions. Draco was the one to get the ingredients for their Allergy Alleviator, and by the time he returned, Potter had set up their cauldron. Draco dropped herbs onto the cutting board and was completely unprepared for a hand to snatch his own.
“Well, yes. She has gotten rather paranoid in her old age, she assumes…she
“Nothing to worry about, I have it under control,” Harry assured her and brought the broom down from the ceiling. He waited until Babs had turned back to Draco to give him a cheerful grin, because of course he was the one who’d sent Egbert up there to begin with.
crackled between them causing him to breathe a little faster.
“Why?” Sky asked with a frown.
“Was there yelling?” Philomena asked. “Broken dishes? Did anyone bleed?”
Potter huffed a tense-sounding laugh. “Yes. Hermione suggested it, because I’m rubbish at talking about the things that bother me, and she thought a different kind of outlet might help. It did, at that. And as it turns out, I’m not half-bad at it.” He flushed, as though embarrassed to acknowledge a strength of his.
“Of course,” said Draco, who felt terrible for the girl. It had only been three weeks since she’d lost her mother, and from what Parvati had told them, it seemed Charlotte barely knew her father at all.  “We’ll try to keep this as short as we can, I’m sure talking about it is incredibly difficult.”
The healer collected the used cloths, Draco’s shirt, and the cloak, and ducked into an adjacent room, returning with another phial of blood type 1 4 blood replenisher. Severus had covered the patient up in the meantime. After Madam Pomfrey had given him the potion, the color slowly started to return to Draco’s skin – of course he was quite pale by nature, but she had never seen him anywhere near as white as he’d been when Harry had brought him in.
“Draco!” he whined.
He snarled viciously at the frightened-looking Harry. “By Merlin’s balls, what were you thinking, you foolish, insufferable brat! Did you lose your-”
He washed his hands and afterwards reached for his wand and cast a Scourgify on them for good measure. Then. he began the task of closing Orval back up, carefully stitching together the cuts he had made. He was thankful he could use magic for it. He didn’t think he’d have the stomach to do it the muggle way.
“Something must have been overlooked.”
“At the top,” Ron picks up the thread, “resides the one and only Luna Lovegood, whose whimsical approach seems to be paying off. She is followed by the slayer of giant murder-snakes, Neville Longbottom.”
“The Realm of the Dead is, you mean?” Harry was frowning.
“The only other ways I know of to deliver a poison is to inhale it or to ingest it, so either the lungs or the gastrointestinal tract. And I’ve
“I am
A few days later, there was another short note. Draco had barricaded himself in a corner of the 8
“What’s wrong?” Granger asked when he took his third wrong turn on the way back to the Floo.
That did nothing to make Draco feel more comfortable.
“Lovely old lady,” Blaise added. “Cute as a button. Fun to flirt with, though a bit naïve and hard of hearing.”
go to your lab and work through the night, presumably. Breathe."
But then Draco was banging his head against the wall again, cracking the tile. He felt fingers scrabbling for a better grip.
I can’t believe someone in the department would be stupid enough to take that sort of risk.”
Draco decided to make the decision easy for her. “If I eat anything more right now, I may actually explode.”
He was still in a bit of shock over the entire revelation when they were walking back to the lifts, so he didn’t notice Marielle coming toward them until it was too late.
Nothing happens. Conversation picks back up, people recommence their hurried walks to classes, and Draco stands there with his mouth open, wondering if the insanity is going to catch him next.
“No, but if you do it the Muggle way, you’ll need one of those machines they use to calculate things. My friend Millicent – you remember her, right, from our year? She liaises with a Muggle bank for Gringotts, and she told me her contact was overjoyed when they figured out magic wouldn’t be able to crack the codes. She liked the idea, so she learned how it worked and then fashioned some spells that work the same way.”
He wanted to sink into the ground about half a second later. Why,
,” said the man, and walked away with a shake of his head.
“We still haven’t gotten one.”
“Yes. Always.”
. And despite me having a pulse and all, being dead must have changed something in me that it recognized.”
Marielle just plain ignored him and shoved things at him, and Draco tried to refuse – politely, because being rude to a well-meaning Marielle would have been akin to kicking a crup – while Potter unhelpfully thanked her again and again. It took quite a while until she let them go.
“The poison that was used in Parvati’s case is the same one that nearly killed you,” he reported as soon as he’d stepped out of the Floo.
"Isn't it a bit late to send Christmas cards? It's only got two days to arrive, and with Muggle mail not always being the fastest -
“Fair,” he said. “But let’s enter through the staff Floo anyway, it’s far less conspicuous than walking in the front door.”
“Right, so,” she said, once the fire was bright and crackling. “I…I lied, yesterday, and I wanted to apologize for that. It’s not something that I think could be relevant, and I’ve kept this to myself for so long that frankly, I didn’t even think about mentioning it until I had time to think.”
Selwyn sighed. “I…yes. It was a big point of contention between us.”
“Also true.” Harry made another sound of abject frustration. “I wish we could…oh, we
"Why is that thing -" Draco began, then changed track halfway through the question. "Did you bring...how many bottles of booze did you bring over, exactly? And why?"
Draco had never felt such peace. He couldn't bring himself to move, to fear, to be embarrassed. The fingers running through his hair were perfection, the chest he was pressed against rose and sunk in a hypnotic rhythm that kept him calm. Not even when Harry spoke was that peace disrupted.
He had directed the mint leaves onto a prepared cutting board and was now bewitching a knife to chop them haphazardly. Draco winced without meaning to.
“Groundhog Day. But I don’t think this is the same sort of situation. If any injuries were undone once you start the loop over, logic dictates that it happens to every other sort of change you made to your body, meaning that the writing on your arm would be erased as well.”
“Afternoon,” he said briskly, in his most professional healer voice. Potter looked up from where he was sitting comfortably, propped up by blankets against the little safe in the corner, in which, Draco guessed, Granger kept all of the books she thought too valuable to put on the bookshelves that ran along the far wall.
an absolute bloody genius with poisons. Her name isn’t well-known because you’re not exactly going to find any reputable teachers who think it’s a great idea to spend more time on how to invent new kinds of deathly poisons than on developing antidotes, if they cover them at all.”
“I’d really like to talk to her,” said an obviously sad Potter once Parvati had left and Draco had gone to the bedroom to let him know. “And Susan too. And, well, a lot more people, after the rest of the Weasleys, of course.” He sighed and ran his fingers through his hair.
“Save it, Blaise, I already heard all that from Granger.”
naked, kissing, entwined, and had seen it for what it was.
Potter?” Draco asked. “Do you think I’m addicted to chocolates or something?”
Draco couldn’t suppress a wince.
Granger gnawed on her lip. She looked like she was internally debating something, so he waited while he cleaned up and Vanished the used needle.
“Does he know? Your husband? About…”
"No, there's a big long list," Draco said. "The more experienced healers can usually do them all from the top of their head, but they still use notes to make sure they haven’t skipped one. Ultrasound gives you an actual picture, yes?"
and Eden pulled her head back and closed the door. “She’ll be out in a moment.”
. She should have told us as soon as it became clear time travel was involved.”
“Yeah, but can you picture Penelope or Marielle?”
“You will,” Draco said and sat down next to him on the bed. “Once we’ve figured this out.”
Draco made a face. “I can give you a list of who
He is wrapped in his cloak, perversely more thankful for it than he has ever been, and his feet carry him past those who would look at him in ways he does not want, that he will never want. Hidden, he leaves the noise and expectations behind and walks at random, past the destruction, past the rubble, through those parts of the castle that are broken, but also those who are whole. His cloak is back in his robe as soon as he feels it’s safe to take off, and he lets his eyes wander, still searching for something he can’t define.
“Oh?” asked Graglor. “Is he planning to take advantage of this Draco? Steal his most precious jewelry? Collapse the ceiling of his ore mine, possibly?”
“Bollocks, I thought that was a really good possibility,” Potter grumbled.
“Did they know that would happen?” Draco asked.
Potter opened his mouth and closed it. And then, he jumped out of his chair and bolted from Draco’s office as though chased by a herd of vicious centaurs.
changes! I only tried to fix this blasted place – everyone should be thanking me.”
All because Harry had poured his heart and soul into a cathartic painting which showcased his feelings of love and desperation and longing.
he asked himself, trying to hear something, anything except silence. There was only the sound of water spraying from the walls. But Malfoy was still here, somewhere.
"Yes," said Hermione. "It will look lovely there."
Despite how upset he felt, Draco smiled and said, “You’re utterly daft, Potter.”
“What’s wrong?” he asks. “You love flying.”
“Sure,” he said. “The first one should be simple enough, I’ll let you know about the second.”
She’d been approached by Blaise Zabini, of all people. He’d been looking for a spectacular idea for a Muggle Studies project, something that would help reintegrate Slytherin with the rest of them, and that could show the world they weren’t bad people at their core. Harry didn’t know the details of what they had planned at first, but the entire thing had evolved into a spectacle of epic proportions. If Harry had to guess, it was because after the traumatic war they’d been through, the entire wizarding world was dying for some light, harmless entertainment. He isn’t about to complain. The contest marks the first time in a long time he’s been able to make himself care about something.

Prompt #18 – Iced biscuits in the shape of Christmas trees
Oh, Merlin. Granger knew.
“Thanks,” she said. “That’s the sort of thing every girl likes to hear.” She held open the door to her office and shut it tightly once they were all inside, then went to her desk and lobbed an Instant Fireplace at the wall with too much force.
what family reunions are like.”
“You most certainly did. I’d ask why you didn’t visit your parents the last couple of weeks like you usually do, but I strongly suspect I already know the answer.”
“Would you be alright if Harry and I went to Madam Malkin’s sometime tomorrow?” Draco asked her.
"Grinch," Harry corrected in passing. He was busy placing parcels in random spots, it appeared.
“Well, yes, but there are lots of other possible explanations for that.”
“Fine, whatever.” Draco carefully picked a path through the flowers.
“I’m pretty sure, yes.”
“Whatever. What sort of street food do you like best?”
“Has it killed anyone?”
“Well, sorry, but Hermione said.”
“Well, yes, because blind panic doesn’t make for a very good baker, does it. You created a charcoal banana brick that way.”
“I never have much of an appetite,” he said.
“Er, yes,” said Harry.
“Cheers,” Draco said drily.
“Are you sure?” asked Philomena. “Personally, I think that would be very exciting.”
“Ow!” he yelled.
Prompt #23 – A red letterbox
He allowed himself to remember things that felt far away, untainted by the war that had followed. There were the excessive shopping sprees he’d gone on with Pansy, and there was his pretending to check out girls along with Blaise, and that time Vince had pitched himself headfirst into a snowdrift on a dare.
Draco stood there for far too long, wide-eyed. Slowly, the realization trickled in that Potter was looking confused.
“What do you need to create an antidote, Malfoy?” asked Clearwater.
Severus, who looked outwardly angry, actually felt disturbed more than anything. That didn’t mean he wasn’t still fuming, and he would have loved to interrogate the brat here and now, but he had to be smart about it. If he lost his temper, Poppy would throw him out, so he waited until Potter had calmed a little and let the boy start the conversation.
“Yes, really. Well, I haven’t figured out how to eliminate the poison still in the bloodstream –”
But Potter was in true stasis, utterly frozen. He could be moved to a certain extent, but he wasn’t aging, his brain not sending a single signal, the blood in his veins completely still. He was, for all intents and purposes, suspended in time. The Unspeakables weren’t fucking around.
“We were eating dinner.”
“When was the last time you were back?”
Harry used the opportunity to steal some kisses and then touched their foreheads together in a way that quickened Draco’s pulse and said, “We need a tree still.”
“Why’ve I gone back to Malfoy?” Draco asked indignantly.
that’s not normal!
“Fine. What did Weasley have to say, then? And should I get the winter apple ones or the mulled wine flavour?”
“My ears are cold,” Draco said – again.
“Wait,” Harry said. His head was positively spinning with this new truth. “How long have you known?”
Draco unwrapped his gift with trepidation. It was soft and squishy, like fabric – it
Prompt #15 – A tangled string of Christmas lights
one! And letting me figure it out early would change the timeline more than a bit because I’d be stuck in a lab the entire time.”
“And how exactly do you –”
“I know what we are, Potter.” Draco stared at the goblet he was still holding. He wasn’t even sure of the meaning of the words he’d just said. His mind was getting irritatingly foggy – which, to be fair, was what he’d been going for before Harry had showed up, but suddenly, he wished he hadn’t. This was all so bloody complicated.
Clearwater hadn’t shown up by the time he was well and truly finished, so he figured he could think just as well in the empty room as he could at home. So he sat cross-legged on the floor and started the task of regulating his breathing. He hadn’t managed to meditate all week, and it did him good to go through the familiar steps. But after he had emptied his mind as thoroughly as he could, instead of remaining in that state, he allowed his magic to gently draw thoughts of wands from his mind.
“Don’t be silly, of course it isn’t. It’s a good, strong goblin name.”
“-and I’m just glad that something around here is still normal.”
“Hm?” Granger asked and raised her head from the file she’d been glaring at as though it had personally offended her. “Oh. No, no, that one actually is real.”
of course I do!
The thought had him reeling because it couldn’t be the person he wanted it to be, and-
“Yes. But this case is different, because the antidote doesn’t need to have a shelf life, therefore we can avoid having to combine anything in a single vial. We can also avoid having them mixing together in his stomach as they wait to be absorbed. I plan to inject them directly into the blood.”
“Is what?” Draco asked distractedly. He made a mental note to procure a throat soothing potion.
“No, it’s great,” Potter interrupted her. “It’s great. I’m glad you kept it. It’s weird, really – I mourned not having known them, before. Now…now I’m starting to mourn all over again, but this time for the people they were, which is weird, because they’ve been dead for so long –”
“Back to thinking that part of me is still the same little arsehole I was in school, that I can never truly be a decent enough person.”
about any of it,
“So I heard. Thought you’d entertain yourself in my Pensieve?”
“Well, yes, but keeping you in good spirits is too,” she said. “I do want you to do your best work.”
“There’s got to be something-” Draco starts.

“No, you don't.”
“Why the

The crackers didn’t make fart noises, in the end, although several of them bleated like sheep. They wished each other “Happy Christmas!” repeatedly and pulled crackers, were enveloped in rainbow-coloured smoke and tried to figure out which hat would look the most ridiculous on them. Draco ended up with a dainty tiara perched atop his new bobble hat, Harry had a feathery turquoise fascinator decorating his hair, and Weasley wore a white and purple boater. When Hermione joined them and handed everyone a glass of winter berry trifle, Harry forced a glittering green deerstalker on her while her hands were still full. She rolled her eyes but kept it on.
All of the contestants obediently stow their wands in the drawers beneath their counters. There is quite a bit of cursing and slamming going on. Neville tells his wand an amusingly weepy goodbye.
Longbottom peers at her, apparently trying to discern whether she’s just fucking with him. Draco fervently hopes she is, but that hope is dashed when Millicent asks several questions about plants, seeming honestly interested when Longbottom starts talking. Draco tries to catch her eye and give her a
“That..that’s a thing?” Potter asks, startled. “Or are you taking the piss?”
Potter studied his face for a moment. Draco's vision was hazy, but he could still see the look in Potter's eyes changing to one of determination, just before he ripped aside the collar of Draco's shirt, popping the first few buttons, and bit down on Draco's shoulder.
managed to find a temporary solution.”
He was unprepared for Potter to take two long steps, grab his wrist with one hand, immobilizing it, while the fingers of his other hand sank into Draco's hair. He pulled with such brutality that a cry of surprise and delight escaped Draco as his head was forced back and his throat was bared.
“But,” Draco said, “that isn’t –”
“That sounds like the Ministry I know,” said Potter. He frowned and pointed to a different wall. “There was that shelf with the time-turners too, the one that got caught up in an endless loop of breaking and unbreaking.”
“Now this one is stunning,” says Kingsley. “Rustling leaves, pumpkins…can’t get any more autumn than that.”
The broom seemed to deflate, then obediently came back to the ground and continued its work there.
“What exactly is happening, then?” he demanded to know once Blaise had taken his satchel back and drawn his wand.
“Because there’s been a lot going on.”
“I can’t believe you’re touching this stuff,” said Draco.
Harry snorted. “Got through it, didn’t you?”
Too late.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Really? To what do I owe the honor?” Draco drawled. His fingers twitched – a tick he'd acquired during the war, which wouldn't leave him. He was nervous, and not entirely sure why.
“And how do we do that, exactly?”
so badly.
“Hello, Malfoy.” She looked anxious, fidgety, and at the same time even more tired than Draco felt. “May I come in?” Draco’s words about how this was a really bad time for a chat stuck in his throat when she added a quiet, “Please?”
“Those only work on the more common poisons,” Draco pointed out.
“It sounds utterly ludicrous, Hermione. You have proof? You know for sure he isn’t just pretending?”
“Rose.”
“Why don’t you ask him?” he muttered, eyes still low.
“I’m almost certain I will spend the entire time with the irrational thought that I need to watch my step or fall through a floor-window into a snowy landscape,” Draco announced.
“Never that. That’s the last thing I want.”
“Hermione said she did as much as she could without giving away the why of it. Sue didn’t want to stay home from work, but Neville walks her there and back home. He sleeps over when he can, too. I don’t think she minds.” Potter smirked. “Hermione told her to be careful with food and drink, just in case. And she’s still got Auror instincts, you know, so I hope she’ll be fine.”
“Maybe,” Potter said and grinned. “Hermione, what do you think?”
“Kitten?” Potter asked, sounding strangled.
happen to you?”
“Me too,” Potter said, snapping Draco out of his burgeoning anxiety attack. “I mean…cairn, obviously. But even before, it was, you know…” He trailed off, then cleared his throat. “This is a really weird conversation.”
“Yes, true,” Draco sighed. “Can’t argue with that, can we, Bartholomew?”
“Has one bitten you yet, Harry?” she asked. Her head of lovely blond hair appeared in front of him as she knelt to be able to see his face.
“Draco asked me to check on his plants while he’s gone,” Neville said. “But I think helping you takes precedence.”
“How’s the lab set-up coming along?” Blaise asked.
“Well.” Draco cleared his throat. He felt wrong-footed. None of his patients had ever had him quite as tempted to blurt out a hundred questions at once and at the same time made him wonder to what degree their opinions of him might have changed over the past eight-ish years.
“I can’t believe you just said that.”
He left them there for the rest of the day. Every time he looked up from his work, he couldn’t help but smile.
"And anyway, you are in no way putting decorations on my walls with
He had cursed Katie, had joined the Death Eaters, and now he was hatching yet another perfidious plan. Harry knew all that with certainty, even if he couldn’t prove it. He was planning to stop him before he managed to hurt – or even kill – anyone else. His heart was beating wildly. He
“I’ll get it,” Harry announced and jumped to his feet before reaching for one of the patches of Atmospheric Illusions on the sideboard. Weasley’s squeaky humming noise of warning came a bit too late. A moment later, they were all staring at the window that had appeared on the floor.
“Harry, you pillock,” Draco said eventually. “First of all, I paid George to de-gnome my garden days ago. He said he would place some traps he invented to prevent them from moving back in. I think your arm must have gotten caught in one.”
Granger shook her head. “The Ministry finally made the decision to discontinue mucking around with time, after the war,” she said. “The room is technically my responsibility, but as you can see, it’s all been dismantled. It’s why I spend most of my time with Blaise and Anton, in the Thought Room.”
“I can tell you what I think was first,” said Draco. “The word ‘poisoned’. Maybe my name along with it.”
“Parvati handed me a list of names she received,” Granger told them over salmon and green beans. “Suspects, I think.”
“Don’t tell the boy you’d like it if he was hurt and upset,” Ermintrude chided.
“Parchment’s probably safest,” said Draco. “I’m not sure how your skin would take to it, if it actually works.” He went and searched Granger’s desk until he found a small piece that would do and copied the numbers to it with a few taps of his wand.
"I got that, Blaise, but what does Bartholomew have to do with it, exactly?"
“I did forget. I’m sorry. In my defence, I learned some rather earth-shattering news that night.”
Draco frowned. “Why did she think she might be getting the flu? Were there any symptoms? Did she mention how she was feeling?”
Granger smiled at him and went to fluff his pillows. “He’s turned into a really decent person,” she said to him, just barely loud enough for Draco to hear. “Give him a chance, will you?”
Potter ignores him. “This is just the precursor to something worse, then,” he says, biting his lip. “They’re trying to lull us in, and when we’ve let our guard down…”
“Harry,” she said, regarding him closely. “I can’t believe Ron isn’t here to witness this. You’re
“Because it’s not like we know anyone named after a flower or anything,” Potter pointed out drily. Draco smirked at that, and Potter, catching it, smirked back while the parents-to-be murmured endearments at Granger’s belly.
“Right,” said Draco. “Harry, why is your arm in a gnomehole?”
Thanks for checking out this slightly goofy thing, and I hope you enjoyed! I appreciate all the comments I've received so far a LOT - it's lovely to hear that someone aside from myself thinks I'm funny. It's also a great boost, mood-wise, which I can always use. :)
“Do you realize that this is where we met for the first time?” Harry asked.
Things went a bit blurry as the Fiendfyre began to rage. Bones finished off one opponent, then the other, but they kept her preoccupied for too long. She spotted Harry’s wand and picked up with haste, and then turned in the direction of the stairs with horror on her face.
It felt like giving back just the tiniest bit of what Harry was giving him. Draco watched with wide-open eyes, taking in everything he possibly could; Harry’s face, the flush of his skin, the noises he didn’t seem embarrassed to be making. He took all of it and treasured it, vowing to remember for the rest of his life how it felt to be like this, with the one who understood him better than anyone else. He bent down and used his tongue to make it all even better, swirling in circles and spirals and tracing joyful shapes on spicy-tasting skin, and it was all just so fucking perfect he wanted to cry.
“Go ahead,” Smith said. “You can’t honestly believe that I’d let the spell slip just because you’re touching him.”
“I…I appear to be stuck in a time loop.”
They constructed implausible theories almost the entire way to the market, but once they had reached it, Harry changed topics.
“We wouldn’t be messing around,” Granger said, as though that was completely ludicrous. “We would simply be…consultants. Liaisons. You can have those.”
"For one, yes. And Harry is excellent at thinking in a crisis, it's what made him such a good Auror, but he's not...well, as far as logic is concerned, that was always my department."
They emerged in the Three Broomsticks and from there stepped out into the picturesquely snow-covered village. The air was crisp and clear, with a uniformly blue sky overhead, and it was easy to see an equally snow-covered Hogwarts from here. The sight caused a pang of longing in Draco’s chest. He hadn’t been back in far too long. Apart from his work at the St Mungo’s he didn’t have much of a life at all, and there had never been a good reason for him to visit. The closest he got was the occasional Floo conversation with Poppy Pomfrey, on the exceedingly rare occasion when there was a student on his floor she wanted to check in on, or if she needed a consultation on anything potions-related.
“I’m leaving,” Selwyn hissed and turned away from them. Draco opened his mouth to call him back, but he was beaten to it.
“Conscious?” Draco asked.
Prompt #7 – A fully decorated, upside-down Christmas tree hanging from the ceiling.
“When was pub night?” Potter wanted to know.
“I know,” Harry said. “I was trying to change that.”
Blaise tutted. "Honestly."
“Ah,” Draco said awkwardly, because he was an utter idiot. He should have anticipated Parvati might catch wind of it not being Ron or Hermione with him, but he hadn’t even considered it, and now he couldn’t think quickly enough to come up with something plausible.
“Oh dear,” she sighed. “Here’s a plan. We hurry up and get you healed, and then you can rest for a bit. Stay the night, if you like. Is that acceptable?”
Draco nodded at Hermione’s words, feeling numb. He didn’t even know Susan Bones all that well, and if
“Well, obviously – we haven’t got a bloody antidote, and since
There were steps, heralding the utter destruction of the last shreds of Harry’s dignity.
The dichotomy that surrounds him has him teetering, the mourning and the celebrations, the loss and the relief. His emotions can’t decide on their place within the spectrum, can’t even manage to find their way out of the fog that clouds his instincts, his feelings, his focus.

what’s urgent? How could that possibly be urgent? I just came off a thirty hour shift, Granger. Unless Potter has miraculously managed to resurrect himself, this is going to need to wait until the morning.”
“Yes. I’ll inject them in as many places as possible, it’s faster than doing only a single injection and waiting for everything to be distributed. But I’ll alternate. So you’ll have a vein…” Draco raised his forearm and drew a line from the inside of his wrist to his elbow, “…and the first injection here will be a small bit of antidote A.” He tapped his index finger on his wrist. “Next one, a bit of antidote B.” He tapped a spot an inch higher up. “Then A again, then B, and so on. When we take him out of stasis and his blood flows again, they’ll be washed everywhere very quickly.”
“Well, if you put it that way…”
Theo tilts his head and narrows his eyes. “I’ll agree to that,” he says, “but only because I’ll lose the betting pool if it gets out at this point.”
“Maybe the poison isn’t making the decision,” she suggested. “Maybe something – some
“We’ll have to have her arrested by someone that’s not me, you, or anyone in the Department of Mysteries, then.”
“Well,” she said, “that’s unfortunate.”
“She seemed agitated. Does that help?”
His office had been…redecorated, so to speak. With flowers.
Draco tied the scroll to a large, haughty-looking eagle owl and held out his arm invitingly. “We need you to fly slowly, and as low as possible, please,” he said.
“More potatoes?” Hermione asked, and before Draco could answer, he had another large dollop on his plate. He wasn’t about to complain. The roast beef, mashed potatoes and bacon-fried Brussels sprouts Molly Weasley had sent over were utterly delicious.
that?” Smith, yet again.
“She cleared her throat. “You’re a healer.”
“Draco,” said Harry.
“He's still a person, Dean.” Potter sounded annoyed. “I saw you flirting with Parkinson at the Halloween Party, you know. If you can forget all about her trying to hand me over to Voldemort, you can stop calling Malfoy a Death Eater.”
Draco was shaking. “It looked... like...”
“Oh yes?” Potter asks. “Which ones?”
“Not a bad idea.”
“Oh, no, not at all! She thought she was coming down with the flu, so she wanted to go home and take a healthy swig of Pepper-Up and get some rest.”
After the judging is finished, all the bakers stand ready to receive their total score for the weekend. As it turns out, the Charms Round has allowed both Harry and Draco to make a decent jump towards the top of the leaderboard, and so it’s Ernie who has to say goodbye to the competition, along with – unsurprisingly – Hermione. The two of them bow and wave, and the audience showers them with generous applause.
sense.”
"Too late," Harry said cheerfully, once again in passing.
“That’s the least convincing lie I’ve ever heard in my life.”
when we agreed to meet, isn’t it?”
“You’re saying he might have helped Penelope develop the poison?”
“Oh, fine,” Potter said eventually and threw his hands up, coming to a stop. “Don’t let me have any fun.”
Draco didn’t think that was particularly promising. “What’s our plan?”
There was a deep sigh from Blaise. “You’ll get frown-lines one of these days, my friend. Come on through to the kitchen, I’ll explain. Bring Bartholomew.”
“Nothing, really. I’m just processing. It’s…” He shook his head and then shrugged, a bit helplessly.
Draco chopped herbs and crushed roots with fury. Potter just stood there, looking earnest and slightly puzzled, and Draco itched to slap the expression off the git's face.
“What in Merlin’s name are you doing, Potter, making all this noise?” Draco had appeared in the doorway to the kitchen. His face was splotchy, his eyes red-rimmed. The sight made Harry’s heart hurt and he wondered how he could ever have been this blind. “Have you come back to yell at me more? Patronize me? Micromanage my life?” He crossed his arms and gave Harry a cold stare.
“Alright then,
“Well,” said Potter, looking incredibly awkward and reluctant, “it only just occurred to me that there must have been a good reason the message on my arm was phrased the way it was.”
“Considering the things I’ve heard - isn’t a Weasley dinner utter madness by definition?” Draco wanted to know.
“Only,” Harry said and gave him a very unimpressed glance.
Victoria closed her eyes. “Take me through it,” she said. “Maybe going over it again out loud will help.”
Draco nodded in acknowledgment. They lapsed into silence once more.
“What about Oriana?” Granger proposed.
“You –”
“The Bakewell tart, Potter, that’s how it all started! They got to Pansy when she was in the kitchens for whatever reason, and everything developed from there. This is a house-elf incursion!”
Draco thought that perhaps he understood. It had to be difficult for her, waiting for the antidote. There was little she could do for Harry right now, and after two years spent mourning him, that
For eight days, Draco avoided Harry’s eyes and stayed away from their bathroom. He went through classes in a haze, always present but never quite there. He started skipping meals again, because it was easy to do when no one cared. Such a simple matter to pretend that nothing had ever happened between Harry and him, as long as he kept himself lost in the haze of his own mind and didn’t so much as glance in the direction of the Gryffindors.
“Who in Merlin’s name is she?” Draco wanted to know as he wrangled the second bedraggled-looking owl.
“Draco, Harry!” she said cheerfully. Her face was barely visible over the mountain of decorations she was carrying, but they could clearly see the reindeer antlers on her head. “I’m so glad I caught you. I have more things for your home!”
“Potter, that’s the opposite of a plan! How in Merlin’s name is that going to break the Founders-cursed bubble?”
“Promising,” Draco said drily and went to sit on the couch. Harry did the same, and Weasley and Hermione entered the room a moment later and got comfortable as well.
“He reacted…badly.” Draco sighed. “And then, I reacted badly and insulted him, and he just…stormed out, he was that upset. And that meeting was supposed to be my chance to impress him, Pans, and I fucked it up so badly.”
“Don’t worry, ma’am,” said Potter. Even though his face was not his own at the moment, there was no mistaking the earnest look. “We’re going to take care of it.”
“It’s a bit more complicated than that.”
The encoding & decoding technique Draco refers to in very simple terms in this chapter is public-key cryptography. I originally figured out a lot more detail about how it would work using spells, but since Draco is not Hermione, and since he wouldn't find them necessary in order to get his point across, those details sadly did not make their way into the chapter. So if it all sounds a bit wishy-washy and hand-wavy, sorry! I blame Draco.
“What the bloody fuck?” Draco asked faintly.
“I’m sorry,” Potter said contritely. “It really must have been hard, if Malfoy’s even defending you.”
“Everything alright, ‘Mione?” Potter wanted to know.
“And anyway, thinking about him doesn’t make me smile, it makes me irritated and grumpy because he’s a git.”
, really, since it says it’s for you only, but I’m interested in how it works.”
Draco tensed. “Why?”
“Yeah,” Weasley agreed. He sounded baffled. “Mine too.”
“No,” said Potter, “if she’d decided to, she would have confronted us first. She’s not – forgive me for saying this, it’s not a value judgment, but she’s not generally very Slytherin. If she recognized us but didn’t say something like ‘Gentlemen, what is this nonsense’, then I think she just planned to see what happens next. Or it could be she has no clue and just wanted to disconcert us for the fun of it.”
"Yes, devious plan." Blaise placed the twelfth and final bottle on the counter and dusted off his hands and robes, although as far as Draco could tell, no substantial amount of dust was present either in his kitchen nor on the bottles. "You might be displeased, but there are four of us and only one of you, so unless you go around eliminating the sticking charms on literally every single decoration we put up today –"
“No, wrong,” said Draco.
“I was hoping to ask you some more questions, actually, Miss…?”
“Why do you ask that?”
General consensus seemed to be that he deserved it, and mostly, Malfoy was ignored and left to his own devices, to roam the halls like just another ghost. But Harry had watched him, first out of habit, then out of concern, and Harry, slowly, had begun to understand.
Draco’s hands clenched around the arm far more tightly than he’d meant for them to.
Draco looks up sharply.
Harry twirled his wand and then dropped his glamour.
“Yeah,” Potter sighed. “I didn’t mean to stress her out even more when she’s already fighting with Ron, but sometimes – rarely – she really does infuriate me.”
“Exactly. There are ways of getting around it though.”
“In a cairn,” Potter said.
“Glad to know that,” he said.
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry said breathlessly. He wasn’t slowing down, but his hand caressed the small of Draco’s back like it was a work of art, like he was admiring the skin there. “You’re so good. You’re so good for me, always so good…”
Suddenly, Draco found it hard to breathe.
The elf’s expression clears. “Oh!
“You’re wrong, Malfoy. The one that belonged to my mother works on everything. It would have eliminated any substance meant to harm her.”
, and
There was subdued laughter, coming closer, and Draco could hear Finnigans voice complaining about his malfunctioning wand. Draco and the entire rest of the class had witnessed it acting up in Charms, where it had stubbornly insisted on creating soap bubbles every time Finnigan tried a simple cheering charm. A moment later, Finnigan himself came into view, followed by Thomas and the Weaselette. As they smiled at Potter, Draco shrank in on himself, fingernails digging into his own wrist.
“Let’s write it out and leave it off if we haven’t got the space. Actually, let’s think about it while we’re on our way to her office, it’ll save time.”
The driver of the Knight Bus was different too, he saw, an older woman with wild, curly hair that surrounded her face like a cloud. She wore a fuzzy orange coat and kept staring straight ahead but acknowledged him with a nod.
“So did you two find a way around triggering them?”
“Shouldn’t be too much of a problem,” Granger assured him. “I’ll let them know that the Ministry has…I don’t know, commandeered you for some issue that sounds terribly important and halfway plausible. Maybe I can send someone else to help out in your ward for a time.”
“Is that…
“I do, and I know she’s just trying to protect me, but sometimes…well, she goes a bit too far. It comes from a good place, but I got upset because she refuses to admit that she should have told me, and she continues to keep some of these from me. I got her to show me most of them, but not all.” He lowered his arm onto his lap and stared at it. “There is something on here that really disturbs her. I can tell.”
“Thought you’d finally decided to call me by my first name,” Harry pointed out, poking his head out of the door leading to the opposite corridor before Draco could get there. “You found something?”
“We weren’t…I mean…” Selwyn sounded strangled. “It was, well, we
“Change of plans,” he said, and flashed them all a smile. “Penelope was forced to go and process a prophecy that just came in, so I’m here in her stead. Lovely tree, Granger.”
Draco recited and traced a careful squiggly spiral in the air, Harry’s way. He squinted as pinpricks of light appeared scattered across Harry’s body and then coalesced into a single, bright golden cluster in mid-air, hovering for a long moment as the spell translated the readings it had taken into numbers.
“I don’t think there is a spell that can tell,” Draco spoke up. “Not accurately enough to answer that question. The one St Mungo’s uses has a two-year margin of error for adults, although for children it’s only about four months.”
Harry’s next sigh was one of relief. “I was worried you were taking it back for good.”
“Lovely spellwork, first of all.” Molly smiles at the colorful beachball tumbling to and fro atop the sand, which Harry very much hopes is not actually sand.
“I don't care.” Draco scratched furiously. “I don't care I don't care I don't care.”
“Second year at Hogwarts.”
“June Sweetleaf?” Potter asked.
“Leave it,” he said, jumping to his feet, nearly slipping on the smooth tile. “Leave me.”
Draco took two steps into the room and touched one of the flowers, a calla lily surrounded by snapdragons. Whoever had done this had picked an excellent florist. The composition, the colors…it was all stunning. It was also heart-stoppingly expensive, Draco could tell that much, and Potter didn’t have that sort of money. Did he?
“I’m not going to let him or anyone else die just because I’m narked off,” he bristled.
“You might not want to shout my name quite so loudly.”
“Babette Buckling,” the woman said with a regal nod. “Call me Babs, please. And you certainly may, although I would prefer to get your alterations underway as we chat, if you don’t mind.”
Granger ceased writing and lifted her head, following Draco’s gaze to the fire dancing merrily in a fireplace that looked wholly unfamiliar to Draco, who had been in this office quite a bit during the past two days.
“Good for you,” Draco said tiredly.
“Fuck me, Harry.”
Potter choked on air while Weasley made a face like he’d just bitten into a moldy pear. He was still doing it when Granger returned to the room. She sent a confused glance his way.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Both of them are on the road to recovery, no fresh brews necessary.”
“Yes,” he said carefully. “Why?”
of people. We tested it once. All six of us together couldn’t do it. Draco, tell me where you found it.”
Once Potter had left the room, Draco ignored the temptation to bang his head against the wall and instead reached for the Floo powder.
“Right, so we just wait, then?” Neville asked, sounding skeptical.
He stared.
“Well, he, he…he sort of…”
Soon, he was careful not to be seen with Harry outside the eighth year common room, and that was it for their attempt at open friendship.
Draco knelt next to Harry’s body and then looked up at the woman with the shaved head. “That’s…Muriel, right? The one I haven’t met yet?”
“Yes, but how does that actually help us?”
to him, lied about what he thought the painting was about, which meant…which meant…
Draco had rarely heard anything more idiotic, and he said as much.
“Oh yes.” She grinned at him. “I’d been working alongside Victoria for several days already by that point – I didn’t want you to burst in and realize immediately that something wasn’t as it seemed. You two are wonderfully predictable sometimes.”
“Potter? Are you even listening to me?”
“You lunatic!” Draco shouted back, rushing over as to keep Potter from trying again, just in case he was planning to. “Do you know how dirty that thing is?”
“I do owe them,” Draco muttered into his neck. “They made you see sense. Hmm, you’re nice and warm.”
“I’m fine with that,” said Harry. “I really –”
“The writing on my arm.”
“One of them says something else that’s true, but there was no way he could have known. There was no way
The crowd shouts agreement.
But he had. His hand came up to cup Draco's cheek, and he pulled him close for a kiss. Their lips met clumsily. The intimacy of the moment was painful. Draco's pulse pounded as Harry deepened the kiss, tongues meeting and tangling, and he clung to Harry desperately. There was something between them that was new, intense and frightening. He couldn't breathe.
Potter rolled his eyes. “Fine, you big baby, we can walk part of the way and pick something up.”
She had seen a lot during her years at the school. Students who quarreled and cursed each other were common occurrences, but this year, it had been worse than she’d ever seen before. First it had been Katie Bell, who hadn’t died thanks to Severus, but had to endure a lengthy stay in St. Mungo’s, and now there was suddenly a severely injured Draco Malfoy to save.
Draco let his present for Harry float over while Hermione did the same with a slender package. “Mine first,” he said. “Mostly because it’s as silly as the one you gave me, and not the thing to end this gift exchange on.”
And then Harry frowned. Even after a good thirty seconds, there was no sign of Malfoy. Only his moans and pained gasps echoed from the walls of the bathroom.
Draco cleared his throat. The witch, who had her back to them, kept on cleaning.
Atop his simple icing that doubles as a blanket of fresh snow, a gingerbread fawn and several bunnies frolic playfully while more snow, made from coconut flakes, dances in the gentle wind. Harry is very proud of it. Even before he hears the comments from the judges, he knows this round went better for him than he could have hoped for. His aim was to recreate the look of a snow globe, and in his opinion, he succeeded.
Draco sighed.
He went slack in Potter's grip. There was a wall, and he was leaning against it, he realized slowly, as he came back to himself. The hand in his hair was no longer pulling, but instead Potter's fingers were rubbing soothing circles on his scalp.
“I could have fetched her for you.”
“We’re having a girl,” Weasley announced, beating Granger to the punch. “We’re having a
Potter smiles. “It seemed best to indulge you,” he says easily. “Besides, we still need to figure out why nobody told us about this. I feel a bit left out.”
She straightened up, but before she could take a single step, a slow, deep voice called out, “What are you five doing here?”
used to that, but Potter was apparently an exception, just like he seemed to be in every other capacity. The silence seemed to buzz and crackle between them.
“No,” the two of them chorused.
“I put a bit of a warming charm on it, though it won’t last forever. Like I said, I’ll make it up to you properly, once I can, but for now this is the best I can do to keep your head warm in this weather.”
“And now it’s over,” Harry whispers.
“She knows something,” he said when they were making their way back through Hogsmeade to the little-used apparition point on the far side of the village.
“Why the everloving fuck did you
“Figure it out.”
“I look every night before bed,” Harry said, “but I haven’t found anything yet. I’ll let you know the moment I do. I still wonder why I felt the need to make it all so vague, it’s bloody annoying.”
“It’s Potter,” Pansy said with confidence.
Draco cleared his throat and glanced over to Weasley, who was still busy being lectured by his wife. “Speaking of – do you think we might get some fresh air to pass the time until these two are done?”
trying it, with how thorough she is.”
Weasley came back from the kitchen with the entire bottle of Firewhisky and a card. “So,” he said, “I couldn’t help but go through your mail…er, I mean, I knocked the stack over, I wasn’t actually looking as such…anyway…”
“Hah. Was Pansy trying to talk him out of that, at least?”
“There’s more wine in the bottom cabinet by the fridge,” he said. “Cheers.”
– but it's the expression of complete peace on Draco's face as he sucks, occasionally looking up at Harry through golden lashes. On the days the weight of his guilt becomes unbearable, this is his punishment – knees on the hard, cold tiles, lips stretched around Harry's girth, throat raw from choking and swallowing. It's so simple, and yet so effective, and Draco practically glows as Harry lavishes praise on him, strokes his hair and his face and calls him a good boy, a good cocksucker, such an obedient little slut.
“I’ll try,” Draco says sullenly, turns, and shoves his cauldron to the floor in frustration.
“We did it at the Ministry.”
Blaise shot him a look of death. “Would you like to wager a guess as to who demanded that I come over here and ask you whether you were planning to grace your parents with your presence at all this season?”
“Not quite, no, but similar. It never stopped. Nobody knew how to fix it or really do anything at all, so they simply left it alone, and…considering what happened later, with the bell jar, that was probably smart.”
“You don’t think…” Theo says.
Parvati leaned back and crossed her arms. “And it has to do with the case as well, apparently. Why exactly didn’t you think I deserved to know? I’m the one assigned to the bloody thing!”
“Oh,” she said. “That’s good.”
“Right,” Draco said, suddenly feeling much more sombre.
Oh, this was so very bad. How could he stop Potter from looking around his office or at least turning his head to the left? He’d simply have to be so charming, so fascinating-
“Everything to do with the case, or with what happened? Poison, veil, time, loop, that sort of thing?”
“Very much no.”
“Er, no.”
“I’m…” Granger trailed off, swallowing hard. She looked at the tree, bronze decorations gleaming in the light of the most recent illusion-fireplace she had decided to deploy. Draco thought he might just have to purchase a set of his own. The way they warmed the room literally and figuratively was wonderful – not that he’d ever tell Weasley that. Even Draco’s adult sensibilities had their limits.
There was a long moment of silence, softened only by the sound the bitterly cold wind made as it rushed past Draco’s ears.
In his head, finally, a bit of peace.
“That’s a yes?” Draco asked.
“Thanks,” he said and was about to turn away when he realized she’d left his fringe plastered to his forehead. A moment later, he received a wink.
The car horn honked again – or perhaps it was a different one.
“Should we stop at Honeydukes?” Potter asked.
“I did.” Granger sighed, her grip briefly tightening. “Look, Malfoy. I don’t presume to know what Harry and you are doing whenever you go off together. I think I have a fairly good idea, but… well.”
“The, er, the night Granger and Weasley came over.”
“Oh, good, Zabini is already here.”
The owl didn’t appear to think much of that nonsense. Once they were outside, she took off immediately.
there and found nothing.”
“Ernie Macmillan, who is set to start a Ministry internship once he has taken his NEWTs, is disposing of his failure in a most un-Hufflepuff fashion,” Parkinson narrates promptly.
She reached over and touched his hand in a calming gesture. “No, I don’t think it will have any adverse effects, although we should look into it and get you properly checked over, just to be sure. Any extra bits – for lack of a better term – were added to the combined Harry. The writing, for example, that’s why it always carried over. That’s what happened with your memory, too – I think the older Harry already had his memories eaten away by the poison, the same thing it did to Susan, and the younger Harry had the memories of the cairn and the rest of his life, so those were added to the combined Harry.”
Harry flushed. “I didn't mean that. Though it wasn't... unwelcome.”
Draco’s eyebrows rose to what felt like the ceiling. “What does it say? Did she let you see?”
“Oh hell,” said Harry. “I cannot believe she did that.”
Draco nodded and led her to the kitchen. “I know her,” he confirmed. “She’s decent. How the fuck are you so awake? When in Merlin’s name did you sleep if you’ve been doing all these other things?”
Blaise went to a chest next to his desk and came back with two bottles of butterbeer. Draco accepted one gratefully. His throat felt dry and scratchy.
someone yelled.
“They're not wrong,” he said eventually into the silence. There were a few tears running down his face; he wiped at them ineffectually with his sleeve, embarrassed.
The Weaselette seems to realize after a moment that she’s holding up traffic, so she takes a step forward, but all her healthy instincts seem to scream at her to stop.
“Did you mean that?”
“If you say so,” Harry says, feeling dubious.
"You just don't
now.”
Draco smiled slowly. “I don't know,” he said. “But I needed it, so thanks.”
The sight that awaited him shook him to the core. Malfoy lay on the floor, his skin deathly pale, and his white shirt soaked by a mix of water and blood. Harry was so shocked he could barely move. His limbs began to shake, his heart raced so fast he was worried he might faint. He hadn’t intended for this to happen! He’d just wanted to teach Malfoy a lesson, and now Malfoy was lying here, covered in blood. It had to be a dream, it couldn’t possibly be true. Harry started to hyperventilate.
“It’s about Malfoy.”
“Oh, we do technically have a department head,” said Granger. “Ursula Rothschild.”
The assistant didn’t waste any time and was out the door in the next second. Madam Pomfrey reached for the phial of blood replenisher and poured it down the throat of the still unconscious Draco. With a special massage technique, she coaxed his esophagus into swallowing – a trick she had, thankfully, learned many years ago from her mentor. Once that was done, she pressed the cloth to the wound to try and prevent Draco losing too much blood. She had given up on trying to heal the cut with magic – there was no way she would be able to do it without knowing the proper incantation. She hoped fervently that Severus, who had much more experience with dark curses, would be able to help.
“It’s not messy enough, that’s the thing. It’s poison that attacks your cells, why would it eat away your entire memory of the time loop and then stop short of destroying anything before then? There’s a good chance that more recent memories will be the first ones to go, that much I’ll admit, but it shouldn’t be able to do it so neatly. You should have at least a few scraps of memory remaining from the loop, or there should be things missing from before the loop, obvious enough that we’d have noticed them by now. But that it cuts off exactly as you came out of the Veil…that’s strange, Harry, that’s beyond strange.”
“What are you doing here, Minister?” Harry made an attempt at diversion.
“Why now?” he asked. “What changed?” His body was crowding Harry’s, wonderful and solid and warm, and he felt so very, very perfect.
They reached Versatile Vials on a side street, and before they entered, Blaise took care to make sure his Ministry badge was on full display. Granger had promised to get Draco a consultant badge as soon as she had the time, in case his being at the ministry was ever questioned. For now, he still wore the visitor’s badge he had been issued the day before – which, to Draco’s endless amusement, proclaimed him to be
The Fiendfyre still haunts him in his dreams, Vince’s screams, the heat, the overwhelming power. He dreams of the absolute terror he felt when the certainty of his death had hit him, and he wakes up with that same terror still in his heart, tangled in sweated-through sheets and feeling moisture on his cheeks.
“Because,” Draco panted, meeting Harry thrust for thrust, “because I… oh
“Merlin, this is so complex.”
This one's a bit late. I know it happened right after a cliffhanger, and I apologize for torturing everyone, but I wanted to make sure that the plot of these next few chapters was well and truly polished and any small inconsistencies ironed out. A huge thank you once again to
“Okay,” said Charlotte, with so little power behind the word that it was barely audible. She was led to a chair by the headmistress who then stood by her side in silent support.
Draco looked at Potter, and Potter looked back, and he could tell they were both thinking the same thing – how the hell else could it have happened?
I truly appreciate all the positive feedback so far. Color me pleasantly surprised that this idea has been so well received!
“Do you know why Golpalott is necessary? The theory behind it, I mean?”
“Pansy Parkinson?” he prompts.
Draco considered this. “I mean…if you’re marrying someone like Lyman, I can sort of see the appeal.”
“See that it doesn’t happen again, peasant,” Blaise said with his nose in the air, and sniffed in a disdainful way. “Wait until my father hears about this.”
“Do you have any ideas get him unstuck, Minister?” asked Luna. “I thought we might wait for one to bite him and use its saliva for inspiration, but Harry seems really quite bothered by it.”
“It wasn't what they did,” said Draco, because it was true. He could handle a few curses and hexes. “It's what they said.”
“The stuff on my arm.” Potter raised the arm in question. “She still won’t let me see all of it, but from what I’ve gathered by now, it’s stuff that I really
They moved into the living room, which had the proper non-illusion Christmas tree in it, sparkling and colourful, the only movement coming from twinkling lights and snow that was falling on a variety of miniature landscapes inside glass ornaments. The gifts underneath it had been wrapped with varying degrees of care, from ‘I lovingly pre-creased every edge’ to ‘I rolled this up haphazardly and stuck spellotape in random places’. Draco was certain he knew who’d committed the sin of haphazard gift-rolling, and it was confirmed when Harry held out a shapeless blob of shiny blue paper. “Mine first,” he said. “Mostly because I didn’t have a lot of money or time available, so it’s terrible, but I plan on getting you a real one once I have both of those things.”
“You said you trusted her judgement,” Draco reminded him.
“We’re down to two patients in the ward. All-time low, apparently.”
That did sting. Draco was not about to let it slide; his professional pride wouldn’t let him. “I didn’t even know the two were related until I looked at the blood sample you gave me. Granger brought me in to develop an antidote for the exact same poison, and I became more and more disturbed by it the more I analysed it, and when I realized it was a serial poisoning, I was quite shaken, truth be told. I really am the most qualified person to figure it out, I wasn’t just pretending.”
“You’re not a very good owl,” Draco said ungraciously to the excitable bird, which hooted and hopped. It was too small to be a school owl, he thought, and he had an unfortunate suspicion as to who might have sent the feathered menace. Hadn’t he seen it over at the Gryffindor table before?
Harry.” Draco rolled his eyes. His heart wasn’t in it, however – it was too busy screaming at him about what in Merlin’s name he’d been thinking, getting involved in this. If they were caught, he’d be in Azkaban before he could say ‘It’s all Potter’s fault.’
“I have Pansy and Blaise,” Draco countered automatically.
Prompt #21 – A large Christmas tree in front of a fancy building
“Malfoy?” he asked.
“I,” she said and looked at him helplessly.
Blaise mixed drinks. He was the one Draco took to watching, because the prospect of alcohol cheered him a whole lot more than watching everyone turn his clean little flat into an abomination dripping with seasonal, vomit-inducing cheer. He’d lost track of Harry and decided he didn’t want to know what
And that was the reason why he was now standing in the middle of Draco’s garden, ready to get de-gnoming.
Draco regarded him for a moment. He’d known Blaise since childhood, and nothing in his friend’s demeanour was ringing any alarm bells. No, Blaise was not the poisoner. Draco was absolutely certain.
“In other news,” Granger said with false cheer, “did you hear we’ll have a storm tomorrow? The Floo network might be down for a while if it gets as bad as they’re fearing.”
“That’s kind.”
Harry looked sceptical. Draco didn’t blame him – the Love Room was such an abstract-sounding thing, it was difficult to imagine what entering it would actually be like.
"Exactly,
She slumped. “We need your expertise on antidotes,” she said. “Urgently.”
open mind.
“Er, great,” said Harry. “What am I looking at, exactly? Apart from Penelope and her…grandfather?”
“Prove it,” Draco said with a very small smile, and Harry shot forward and kissed him breathless. They moved together, although Harry couldn’t figure out how and where, but eventually, his back hit the wall. Draco was plastered against him in the same moment, making a lovely little sighing noise.
“Oh, Merlin,” Draco breathed. “It’s a
“Suppose not,” said Draco. “Alright, back to work. I’m trying to find some way to get the poison particles to reveal how many and which magical triggers were placed on it. I’ve been thinking some kind of magi-chemical indicator might work, but I’m having trouble coming up with a substance that is reactive enough. Any ideas?”
“It is,” Draco confirmed. “Although I do have to owl their gifts by tomorrow, which I haven’t bought yet, so there’s that to stress about.”
“Like in the tale, yeah?” Ron piped up. “He didn’t like the three brothers showing him up, either.”
“Yes, because I’m an uncaring bastard any other time,” said Draco. “Cheers.”
“So you
“Round trip,” Harry protested as he made his way up front. “I said round trip!”
“I’ve scanned all the layers of the skin and the muscles beneath with three different spells. None of them show an unusually high concentration of poison damage in one area, so it can’t have been a contact poison, and the few scratches Orval has are nowhere near big enough to deliver a large enough amount of the poison even if he’d bathed in it, so it’s not subcutaneous either. He doesn’t have any injuries that go deeper than that, so it can’t have been intravenous. That would be unlikely anyway, unless we’re talking about a muggleborn with medical training.”
“Brilliant,” Potter said, just like Granger had. “Now we just need to figure out what this password is, on top of the other one.” Still, he gave Draco a happy grin, green eyes lit up.
Pouring wine seemed like the best course of action, so that was what Draco did. “When was the last time you checked to make sure they were all accounted for?”
“That looks quite fun,” said Potter, but he made no motion to follow, so Draco doubted the veracity of the statement.
“What time was that?” Draco asked.
“What…what happens if you put them both in the shaker?” he croaked. “Force them to mix?”
“So what?”
“That’s quite alright.” Draco tried to sound as kind as he could. “Let’s move on. Do you remember your mother corresponding with anyone via owl or having any Floo conversations?”
“He probably won’t wake up,” he reminded her, and paused to cast a
“That sounds right.”
Ministry business, then. There was no way Granger was authorized to cast that charm if it didn’t relate to her work in the Department of Mysteries somehow. But that still didn’t tell Draco much of anything, and she’d need to give him more than that before he’d allow her to point a wand at him.
“You don’t have to make yourself watch this,” Blaise said in a strangely gentle tone.
She beamed at him, which was not remotely close to the reaction Draco usually got when he introduced himself. “I knew a Draco once,” she said. “Wonderful man.”
, so –”
She fought valiantly. Draco could have told her there was no point, and maybe she knew, maybe she only fought because she couldn’t bear the thought of running without trying all she could to save her partner. Again and again, she battled back the fiery creatures coming at her, tried to make headway, screaming Harry’s name as sweat and tears ran down her face and she started to cough.
Potter snorted a laugh.
“But that’s why I’m asking!” she cried out, jumping up and wringing her hands. “Tell me how to fix this!”
“There isn’t even really any snow on the ground,” Draco said helplessly. He didn’t
“Please,” he panted, “please!”
Draco stopped. He turned. He blinked, thrice.
“Ah, well, he could do with some hexing. I don’t see the problem.”
“Maybe,” said Draco, and stared out of the window, contemplating it. The idea really was weird, but so was the thought that it had already happened seventeen times.
She rolled her eyes. “I’ll get you a consultant badge.”
“Are you being sore because he threw you out?” he asked.
Philomena huffed. Her needles clacked faster.
“See,
“Well, maybe my tongue is too,” Potter suggested with a saucy grin.
So they made their way to the post office, where Draco wrote a note saying
“They must be clinging to the last shreds of their sanity still,” he points out. “They’re trying to protect us, give us time to-”
"I will hex you," she said sweetly.
“No. No, it doesn’t. I haven’t eaten since lunch, either, and now it’s nearly ten.”
feeling.”
“Is it?” Draco asked plaintively. “So, er, how much time did you spend with Sylvana Brown the day before yesterday? Did she only get one set of new robes?”
“Alright?” he asks. Draco briefly closes his eyes as he nods, and Harry allows himself a moment of running his fingers through Draco's hair, stroking tenderly. The strands feel like silk against his broomstick-callused palm.
The corner of Granger’s mouth twitched as Smith scowled.
He had no idea how long he had been at his work when he heard the echo of footsteps coming closer. Even though he tried hard to ignore the sound, truth was that few people had good reason to come this way unless they were looking for him. Whether it was another gaggle of students looking to torment him, or perhaps Slughorn wanting to chase him out of the room, he didn’t know, but either way he had no desire to be interrupted.
“I will await you tomorrow evening in my office, at eight o’clock sharp, Potter. I will not tolerate tardiness then, whatever the reason.”
“Oh shut it, they haven’t even said if it tastes any good yet,” Harry whispers back.
Harry swallowed hard. He knew that the head of Slytherin house was not to be taken lightly. When he heard a sharp “Get going!”, he jumped up and went.
Draco waited until they were all gone before deliberately dragging his nails further down his wrist and welcoming the stinging pain that seemed to do so much to help him breathe.
“Um,” he says intelligently, and Potter snickers.
A positively ludicrous number of flowers, in fact.
Clearwater made a polite face and stepped past him to look down at Potter. “Anything new since I left?”
“Granger-Weasley residence,” he demanded tersely. When the call connected, he was faced with Granger, curled up on the sofa and reading a book in the soft glow of what seemed to be a messy bundle of muggle fairy lights lying next to her.
get a room. Maybe it’s fitting that their first kiss happens because Draco is being petty and vindictive – Potter doesn’t seem to mind, at any rate. In fact, he could swear that Potter is enjoying the petty vindictiveness of the situation quite a lot, if his chuckling into the kiss is anything to go by.
“New?” Draco guessed.
“Oh, Draco,” Harry said, very quietly. “They're dead wrong.”
“I think I can handle it. Hermione’s already gotten some of it out of me, too. You need to know, though, that there are apparently a few gaps in my memory, so I might not be able to answer.”
Draco smirked and tilted his head to give Harry better access. “Is that what this is called?”
“What?”
“Weasley, no one is disputing that your girlfriend is a heroine in her own right, but this is precisely what the anonymous judging is supposed to prevent – preferential treatment. According to Miss Granger herself, this competition was conceived to exemplify the blank slate all of us deserve, which will allow us to look ahead towards a better future instead of clinging to the horrors of the past. We should learn from what happened, but at the same time try to practice forgiveness and understanding instead of dispensing judgment.”
“I wouldn’t say that, Harry. The alternative might just be being stuck in a time loop for all eternity. Since you wouldn’t know you’re in a time loop, you’d never do anything differently.” She shrugged at their looks of horror. “It’s just a theory.”
Ermintrude interrupted her knitting just long enough to make a very rude gesture that Harry had never seen an older woman make. “I’m being supportive. Can’t you see he needs us to be supportive?”
sell one, which is pretty much everyone around the area. Versatile Vials in Hogsmeade is the only one that may possibly carry them, they’ve got some of the more obscure equipment. But they wouldn’t tell me even if they did; the owner hates me.
. He screamed for help, but nobody seemed to hear him. It was hopeless, nobody wandered near Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, so what should he do? His thoughts raced wildly. Leave Malfoy here and fetch someone? No, he was far too afraid of returning only to find him dead.
Harry told her the same thing he had told Blaise and Clearwater, and probably Bones as well. He omitted anything to do with the Hallows or the Veil, glossing over how he’d left the cairn, which Parvati didn’t even seem to notice, and made a bit of a hash of explaining the time travel, which wasn’t too noticeable because nothing about that part made any sort of sense anyway. Halfway through the explanation, tears appeared in her eyes, and by the end of it, she was hugging Harry tightly and expressing how glad she was to see him again, all of it in sentence fragments and broken sobs. Draco couldn’t blame her. If he was perfectly honest, he might have gotten emotional too if Harry had been awake the first time Draco had seen him again. Hell, Granger had apparated them to a bloody park so he could have a panic attack in peace because the knowledge that Harry was alive had overwhelmed him.
“Did she say you were mental?”
Draco was not about to let a weak and shaky Potter walk around the Department of Mysteries by himself, so he tagged along and allowed Potter to use him for balance. He found that he really didn’t mind.
“We won’t,” Granger said gently and finally went to sit down on the couch Parvati wasn’t occupying. Draco approved. It was probably a good idea to give her space.
Granger’s warming charms were downright ridiculous, Draco decided. She’d only cast a single one, and it had him feeling cozy even after crouching on the frozen ground amidst wind and heavy snowfall for over ten minutes.
Eden, meanwhile, was pleading with her roommate. “June, darling, you do need to come out! The Aurors are here, they have more questions.”
“A Notice-Me-Not isn’t anywhere near enough to keep you from being recognized, all that anyone needs to –”
“I thought the people who were poisoned were already dead?”
“Draco.” Pansy sighed. “I don’t believe that.
She looked up and smiled. “Draco. Is everything alright?”
With his
“Sorry.” Draco cleared his throat. “I was thinking.”
Harry read the letter in his hands and had no idea what to think.
“It makes
“Just a few follow-up questions, if you don’t mind.”
“I don’t know. I frankly can’t be bothered to worry about it, either. The Aurors might be able to figure that part out.”
Draco shook his head and glanced at Hermione, who was thoughtfully staring down at a red and white striped ring and chewing her lip.
“Clarence is a perfectly respectable name!” Weasley protested.
Twenty minutes later, Harry is staring in awe at the cooling golden-brown mass inside his cauldron. He’s done it, finally, he’s made caramel. As he starts putting together his cake, using the caramel sauce as mortar, he feels the envious stares of both Hermione and Draco.
A noise made him look up. It was the door, opening with a creak, and then Potter appeared as though out of thin air. Draco blinked and stared, stupidly wondering for a moment whether this bathroom was in actuality some sort of offshoot of the Room of Requirement, and whether it had simply read his mind. His dismissed the idea as soon as he saw that Potter was in his pyjamas, a cloak in one hand and a piece of parchment in the other.
“Crunchy sugar things Muggles put in their cakes,” Goyle says, and holds out the plastic container someone must have procured for him. “I think they’re pretty.”
Blinking fast, Draco dove down until his throat constricted. The tears he spilled might have been from choking. No one was in a position to claim otherwise, and the lack of breath felt, in its own way, like absolution.
He uses his thumb to wipe away a bit of spittle that has collected in the corner of Draco's mouth. Draco blinks and mewls his thanks through the gag. He looks so fragile, sometimes, that Harry worries about breaking him before he reminds himself that what they're doing is fixing, healing, and that Draco needs this like he needs to breathe.
. The poison actually changes as it transfers, and I have no idea how it does that.”

It took a while until Harry had calmed down and ceased casting spells at random out of sheer joy, but once he did, he instead looked around and asked, “Crackers?” with child-like hopefulness.
“But what?”
He was afraid of the pain, the ugly, emotional one, that would tear him apart. He was afraid of that unspecified time in the future when he would no longer have Harry to help him cope. He was afraid of being found out, of everyone knowing how much of a wreck he had become, of how needy he was, how dependent.
“How, Potter? There
“Christmas Eve,” Harry told him simply. “Nobody works late on Christmas Eve unless they absolutely have to.”
Holly stroked a calming hand down his back. “Let’s get you up, Harry. Draco will be alright. Would you like to sit with him?”
“The…what are you planning to do
"Oh blasted Salazar.”
Reflexively, Draco clutched a fistful of his expensive velvet-lined cloak. School uniform fitting might have been be well enough, but Madam Malkin’s wasn’t precisely known for its spot-on tailoring services. “But…it might, er, mess with the warming charms.”
Harry pushed his glasses up again, making Draco feel an inescapable urge to kiss him, so he stopped and did. Faintly, he wondered whether he should feel embarrassed about acting like a giddy teenager, then decided not to bother.
Draco laughed. He couldn't have held it back for the world. The understatement was just that priceless. Harry looked taken aback for a moment, but then a self-deprecating little smile appeared on his face.
Draco started pounding the wormwood with his pestle. Harry didn’t let that deter him.
They came to an arrangement.
“It was just a cut, I’ve had far worse. And I think I’m not too far behind right now.”
“Was there something unusual about…did she flinch of hiss or shiver at any point?”
“I’ve never seen anything like it. I’ll need to neutralize it in several stages, and for the first one, I need the crystalline structure that quartz inherently has. I have to find a way to encapsulate –”
“I don't hate you either,” Potter said evenly, finally stopping his pacing and turning to Draco. “I used to think I did, but... the war put that into perspective for me. I already told you I don't want anyone suffering any more, and that includes you. I know you went through a lot in the war as well. I'm sure you have nightmares too. Has Madam Pomfrey forbidden you Dreamless Sleep yet? I can't take it any more.”
With that, she stomped off.
“Erm.” Potter looked down. “I’d prefer to tell you later, if that’s alright.”
Holly soon brought her the essence of dittany and several healing cloths. The young assistant had only been with her for four months. She’d been at the top of her class of trainee healers and had been insistent on doing her apprenticeship at Hogwarts – a thing which Madam Pomfrey was incredibly thankful for at this very moment.
a grand plan, I would know it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Smith snorted derisively. “Yes, I’m sure aesthetics will be his first priority at that point. Have you seen Penny? She was supposed to take over ages ago.” He switched his wand to his other hand and rotated his wrist.
“Why should I? I told you he couldn’t do it right from the start, and yet you –”
"Well, yes."
“Fuck off,” Draco grumbled, one eye on Potter, who let out a shout of rage and charged at the bearded man who’d been standing out of Draco’s line of sight. A spell, cast by Bones, flew wide. “I was waiting for you.”
That only seemed to upset her more. She stood abruptly, crossed her arms and looked at them all in turn. “I
She opened the door wide and beckoned them in. They stepped into a living room that was chaos incarnate, with half-empty or tipped over drink glasses everywhere, decorations that had been mostly torn down, stains and broken glass on the carpet, and so many more things that Draco could barely process it all. He assumed quite a few of them were muggle, as he had never seen them before. The room reeked of sweat and alcohol.
“Well, same. Hermione still hasn’t heard back from the French Ministry about her, you know. She’s sent three missives.”
“Should have worn short sleeves,” Harry says without thinking, and then winces when Draco freezes, realizing he’s an idiot. “Shit, sorry. I didn’t mean-”
though?”
hasn’t revealed himself yet,” Draco sniffed, then paused for a second. “Or herself. But hopefully not that. Women mystify me.”
to hear you did not contract Mumblemumps,” Draco informed the woman and prayed his poker face was holding.
“If you’re on the side where it was put up, a blasting curse might do it, but it would have to be a rather powerful one. If you’re on the other side, you might be able to overload the barrier if you have enough people, but it would have to be a
“What was the friend’s name?” Draco asked.
“Because if it’s that simple, why do you still have all of the memories before the loop starts?” Draco answered in her stead. “It should all be gone, or at least it shouldn’t be so…”
Potter sighed and rolled his shoulders, probably stiff from all the sitting. “That answer’s not so easy. Has to do with something that happened at the battle of Hogwarts.”
“Congratulations,” Draco said reflexively.
“Potter. Story. Swiss cheese.”
“Oh no,” Harry moaned into the grass, and tried to wandlessly cast a spontaneous combustion spell on himself.
Harry is pretty sure the next cake belongs to Hermione, because he’d heard her ambitiously mentioning mirror glaze, and this cake…has an attempt at one. It’s white, and certainly shiny, but a bit blobby, and the cake is uneven enough that most of it has run off on one side. The poor ice skater probably should have been a snowboarder, Harry thinks as he watches the skillfully animated little figure struggle not to slip off the cake.
Draco broke back through the surface of his thoughts with a desperate gasp for air. He was on all fours, lungs burning and arms shaking and shock reverberating through him as though it had happened yesterday, that night –
Potter nodded.
“I mean the part about him being secretly in love, you old bat!”
“Yes,” Harry said eagerly. “Brilliant idea.” He seemed to realize a moment later what that sounded like, and his expression changed to alarm. “I mean…just so that we…I don’t know what I mean.”
hid all the pregnancy books I bought.”
“It’s not an advertisement, you daft buggers,” said a girl of maybe sixteen with a glittering black knit cap on her head. “It’s to make you smile.”
“Crap!” Potter groaned. “Please don’t, you’ll get me in trouble.”
“See?” Ron said smugly. “Insulting each other is just a thing you do,
“I’m really sorry, I-”
“Absolutely not,” said Parvati, but she was facing Weasley when she said it, so Draco dared hope that Granger’s suggestion wasn’t included in her emphatic refusal.
“Because you’re blushing, Draco, and you’ve got that ridiculous expression on your face that you only get when you think about him. And also because there’s a blond and a dark-haired man in that painting, no matter how much you try to deny it.”
That was when Draco remembered that Potter was a rash, hot-tempered Gryffindor who would probably actually do what he was threatening. With a sigh and a wave of his wand, he unlocked the door, but otherwise did not move.
“We didn’t even know who it was at first,” said Smith. “Obviously it wouldn’t have occurred to us that it could possibly be him.”
“That’s a fair point,” he admitted.
“Basically forever.”
“Right. Well. I’ll need to be back tomorrow, but so far –”
“Did you change your mind?” Blaise asks politely when she just keeps standing there.
“Humans,” Bug agreed and rolled his eyes as well.
“And then,” Harry said, pausing to look at Draco, “there is one more thing I have to know, and I need you to be honest.”
Harry gave him a dark look. “You don’t understand anything at all,” he said, and stormed out of the room, eyes blazing with so much determination that Draco knew this wasn't the end of it.
“You think he cares.” She sighed. “Oh, Harry.”
Weasley and Hermione looked strangely nervous as Harry unwrapped their gift, a slender wooden box that reminded Draco of –
With those words, Severus Snape left. On his way back to the dungeons he came across the caretaker, Filch, wiping away the blood in the corridor while muttering angrily. He ignored his students’ questioning gazes – the faster these gossiping brats forgot the incident, the better. It would be bad enough having to tell Albus about the matter once he had finally returned – whenever that might be.
“You deserve all of it.”
Selwyn’s eyes darted from Draco to Potter and back. “Do I have your word that Skeeter won’t get a hold of this?”
“Yes.” More grass fell victim to Draco's numb fingers. “But part of me craves the pain for its own sake and I... I don't really understand it.”
Draco shrugs helplessly. “I have no idea.
“How does it work?” she asked. “Does the magic look at the…the DNA? Or maybe cell division?”
When Draco was in the process of picking out flavours of gummy bears, Harry said, “Ron had quite a clever thought on Orval Amado and the barrier cube, by the way – and don’t go expressing shock that he’s capable of rational thought, please, Draco.”
“I cast a
The lift doors opened. Draco stormed into the atrium with perhaps a little too much of a stomp.
“Thanks, mate,” Weasley said, and he was smiling too, alternately at the lanterns and at his wife.
“Hm,” said Harry, and then, “Er, speaking of notes, there appears to be an owl at the window.”
“Wizards don’t really have an equivalent, or even much of a concept that it’s possible,” Draco said ruefully. “We don’t even
A hand covered his own.
She grinned at him. “You have other strengths.”
Graglor rolled her eyes. “Humans,” she said. “No sense of priorities.”
Potter chuckled. “Not now. I meant years ago, at the battle. Voldemort, he…” He sighed wearily. “It’s complicated. There were a lot of factors at play, but essentially, he used my blood to resurrect himself, and by doing that, he accidentally tethered me to him. When he killed me but remained alive himself, that tether brought me back. It didn’t take very long – I came back a few seconds later, if that, but I
“Of what?”
“It said not to put me in danger,” said Granger, “so I suppose in one iteration I must have been, and…oh.” She paled.
“Sprinkles,” Ron says, sounding mystified.
Harry’s expression changed to a very large frown. “So…hang on, you’re saying there were
The weeks went on, and Harry kept up his end of the bargain. Together, they met Draco's needs in their little bathroom, and outside of it, they tried to be friends.
“How much did you tell her?” Harry asked.
"The thing is," she continued, "I've spent quite some time thinking about the best way to approach this, and I've come to the conclusion that whatever we try to change for the next iteration needs to be as subtle as possible. One wrong message can set everything back so far."
“I usually walk. But it’s fine. I know time is of the essence.”
“Suppose you might even understand, to some degree.” She looked at Harry, then Draco, making a sound of bleak amusement.
“We need to search the department,” Harry said.
Draco
Harry shook his head. “Feels like with everything we figure out, things only get more complex, not less. I haven’t a clue.”
“Er.” Potter followed his gaze. “A Christmas decoration?”
Harry couldn’t help but agree. The rain had mostly stopped by now, but it was still wet and cold and thoroughly unfriendly outside. He reached for his wand and cast several drying, cleaning and warming charms on himself and Draco, and on the bed as well because he was hopeful that there would be a good long bout of snuggling.
“The cake was penis-shaped, too,” said Eden. “I even used magic to fill it with cream, and then –”
“Don’t be ridiculous, I wouldn’t make it out of the room alive if I had,” Pansy scoffs. That doesn’t seem to reassure Granger one bit. Draco doesn’t blame her. Pansy Parkinson with a polite smile on her face and a tray of baked goods in her hands is a sight that would set off anyone’s alarm bells.
From the corner of his eye, Draco could see as Potter stood abruptly, apparently offended on Draco’s behalf. It warmed him to see it, even though it wasn’t necessary.
“Of course not.” Draco sniffed and crossed his arms. “Do I look like someone who eats street food?”
“Apparently, those need renewing anyway, because you shiver every time we walk around outside for longer than ten minutes,” Harry pointed out.
He wore a different glamour today, a stronger one that he and Draco and Granger had all added layers to, and as always, Draco was bothered by it. Potter’s mannerisms made it clear enough to anyone who looked closely that it was him behind the unfamiliar features, but even so, there was a sense of disconnect that made Draco wish fervently that Potter could just be his own bloody self.
“Oh, this is nice,” said Potter, looking around. He didn’t question why Draco hadn’t wanted them to go indoors. Instead, he stretched out his hands and allowed Draco to cast a warming charm.
“I’m just glad we finally have something resembling an answer,” said Hermione.  “It was driving me
Potter frowned, and Draco decided self-defenestration sounded like an excellent idea. Could he have sounded any more cold-hearted?
“You keep telling yourself that. Actually, please
“Oh,” said Potter, and then, “why?”
know,” Potter said slowly.
“Brilliant,” Harry says. “I meant to do that. Ran out of space up here.”
“It’s, er,” Ron said. Draco and Parvati both looked at him, but that seemed to be as far as he’d thought out his answer, and when he sent a helpless gaze Draco’s way, he may as well have waved a giant flag stating
Harry stared dumbly at his wand, which he’d forgotten to lower, and then back at the bus. He gave a mental shrug.
Granger approached, handing her a steaming cup of tea, and Parvati took it with a nod of thanks. The rest of them remained silent, solemn. Draco stared blankly at the decorative green glass bowl filled with mint humbugs and candy canes, which was probably supposed to spread festive cheer but fell well short.
Draco froze. At first, he thought he had misheard. After nearly eight years of hurt and regret and  revenge, after so much wishful thinking over the scene on the train at the beginning of their first year, he could not actually be getting this. They weren't children any more, and those juvenile grudges had long since paled against the horrors of the war, but still, he had always assumed that... well.
It doesn’t. It catches Millicent. Draco has no other way to explain the lacerations she collects while helping Longbottom to wrestle a rogue Bitter Aciper back into the crate it had broken out of. She watches him secure it while clutching a bloody handkerchief to her face, and then she lets him fret over her plant-inflicted injuries, which is the very last thing Draco expected out of Millicent, ever. This is the same girl who once threatened to punch Goyle in the face because he suggested she have her broken toe looked at by Madam Pomfrey.
Blaise rolled his eyes at that. "It works better if it's done carefully - lasts a bit longer - but I assume you lot actually want to drink them at some point."
“I wanted to walk,” said Potter. “Hermione, I’m going crazy in here.”
Potter looked less upset than she had when he waved Draco into the room from where he was sitting in his blanket nest, but his face was not a happy one either. He didn’t seem inclined to chat, so Draco figured he might as well cut straight to the chase after he’d closed the door.
“You…you paint,” he said, then winced because that was an incredibly stupid thing to say.
“Talk to him.”
“Hallow?” he suggested.
“Well, I already told the last Auror who asked, I don’t think you can be a politician without having somebody get upset at you. Got a threatening owl or two, but nothing recent.”
“Definitely not,” Harry said. He just wanted her to leave so he could feel humiliated in peace.
“Don’t lie to me.”
Granger shook her head. “I’m not far along,” she said. “I had no idea. It wasn’t planned.”
“When did she flinch?” Potter asked.
“I’ve found it works better for me than using my wand. If I draw the blood out and into a vial with magic, it passes through the air, which can include contaminants. On top of that, I don’t know enough about the poison to be sure my magic won’t affect it in some way. It’s better to be safe than sorry.”
Draco didn't like it. The sooner Potter left him to his own devices, the better. He could already feel the stares that had resulted from Potter simply sitting next to him on the bench, the other eighth years wondering what in the world they could possibly have to say to each other, after everything.
Draco, who had been in the process of reaching for his wand to cast yet another diagnostic spell, faltered. “A
idea,” Harry said with emphasis, and next thing Draco knew, he’d been dragged out of the room by his overenthusiastic lunatic of a boyfriend.
“I…I was…” Harry took a deep breath, feeling the prickle of oncoming tears. Fuck it, he had screwed it all up anyway. “I was trying to de-gnome your garden, because I needed to do something to show you I was sorry because I forgot our anniversary, except obviously it’s not actually our anniversary, because we’re not properly together, but I really wanted to be and so I was trying to be romantic, except something happened to my arm and now it’s stuck, and I’ve just announced that there’s something going on between us, which nobody was supposed to know, so now I’m a horrible idiot and everything is terrible and I want to die.”
His nails dug deep enough to draw blood. A pearl of it welled up, dark against his pale skin. Draco focused on it and tried to blend out his surroundings.
“A time loop,” Draco said.
Draco didn’t want to think about that.
“He’ll love seeing it when he wakes up,” Draco said pointedly.
“Malfoy?” he asked. “This
“Potter, I am not having my flat dressed up in Gryffindor red.”
“Yes,” he said. “Unfortunately. And I was looking for a gnome, but then I got stuck.”
Draco had barely put his healer’s robes on when Victoria told him that there was someone waiting for him by the lab.
Harry's favorite part of the day used to be the time he spent in the common room with his friends, but now it's the time spent in their bathroom with his cock pushing into Draco's throat. It's not just that it feels good – which it does, holy fuck, it
But when he ripped away the last of the wrapping, his breath caught, and he realised that he’d misunderstood, because this was by the same artist who had done Draco’s other painting. The style was unmistakable. This one showed what Draco thought might be the same blond man who’d been in the other one, but in a much different pose, something that seemed…coy. It was difficult to tell because the style didn’t lend itself to figuring out details, but Draco just got that sort of feeling from it, as though the artist had communicated through more than just the subject’s pose itself. It was the same thing that had drawn Draco to the first painting, the way that the painting spoke so much louder than just a regular picture might. He loved it immediately.
“As well as can be expected,” said Draco. “There’s still some tissue, vein, and artery damage, and his lungs aren’t quite working at full capacity, but it’s nothing the right potions and spells and a bit of rest won’t be able to fix.”
“Yes,” Granger said quietly. “You know him. It’s Harry.”
– maybe kissed Potter, or even just told him how they felt. Draco half-wished he had his own set of notes that carried over from one iteration to the next to guide him along. ‘Punch Smith on Day 19’. ‘Antidote formula is:’. ‘Don’t try kissing Potter.’
“What? No! I was on the Knight Bus.”
Lastly, I'd like to extend my sincere apologies to anyone who has any actual Chemistry knowledge. Reading the magical theory in this one will probably be like fingernails on a chalkboard.
“Well, you made a very good point yesterday about it being silly to still use last names.”
She had a hint of an accent, French, Draco was almost certain. Her voice was melodious and pleasant.
“You should have a good talk with Granger about it,” Blaise advised.
Everyone was silent and looked at each other. Evadne headbutted Harry’s forearm and he started scratching her behind the ears absent-mindedly. “What?”
“I haven’t had any for ages, that’s what. Potter isn’t exactly a connoisseur, and I’m not going to share my favourite wine with someone who doesn’t know to appreciate it.”
“Probably best not to,” Harry agreed.
It wasn’t Draco’s fault that Potter looked stupid with hazel eyes, and that his forehead without the lightning bolt scar was just
“What?” Granger asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
see.”
They read the third letter together.
“I don’t even know what
“Which one? There’s at least three,” said Draco. “Does anyone know one with an ‘E’?”
“Releasing it anywhere isn’t an option either,” said Granger. “I just don’t know enough about it to be sure of the consequences.”
“Well, yes,” she said. “But it’s as safe as I could make it. There is no way for it to get out. The bubble it’s in is unbreakable, and it will last for over a hundred years. Not even
“Draco, I’m not sure you understand just how serious this is. These are under lock and key in the Department of Mysteries –”
The whole bloody thing unraveled and fell away, and the next breath he took was far deeper and easier than it should have been. Draco looked down, slumped, and pulled his knees to his chest to protect himself from the cool air, feeling a shudder running through him.
, who has just been invaluable to me, as a beta reader, plot-helper, and cheerleader.
“I think it depends on how the loop starts,” said Granger. “And that’s the thing I can’t figure out. Even if we still had access to something like a time turner, there’s no way to do it so that you lose your memory but not things like clues on your body – even by accident.”
“Yes, yes, of course, it’s nothing bad.”
“After the Fiendfyre, you mean.” Draco was proud that after all this time, he could actually talk about the incident without shivering or staring into space as he remembered Crabbe. That didn’t mean he
“No, but I thought you might attempt to obliviate me,” she said coolly.
“Don’t be ridiculous, I went through all the work of getting used to the idea.”
“No reason it can’t be both,” Granger said reasonably.
Potter sighed repeatedly. Draco couldn’t help but wonder if an upside-down Instant Illusion Christmas tree might lighten the atmosphere or at least give Potter something less upsetting to think about.
There was a moment of heavy silence.
And then,
Draco kept looking at the cheerful fellow. It
He couldn't help but think they were right.
Draco was relieved he wasn’t the only one thinking that.
“So you’ve mentioned.”
“What?”
“Happening? Not much.” Blaise tapped the satchel thrice with the tip of his wand, then opened it and retrieved a bottle of what looked like a high-quality whisky, setting it on the counter.
Harry shook his head. “That's not it. I... it's hard to explain, but I like... that you let me see you like this. I like that you trust me with this. And I like that I can help you. It's not just altruistic, it makes me feel better too.
“Fun has nothing to do with it,” Draco sniffed. “It’s dangerous.”
Harry turns back to his sponge and is relieved to see it’s turned out acceptable. He applies cooling charms after dry-rolling it so that he can fill it immediately. Soon, curses and groans of despair aplenty are heard beneath the canopy as everyone gets started on rolling up their sponges.
He breathed a little easier once he was outside in the cold air. Potter was gone, and so was Draco’s young patient, and yet life went on,
anyway?
and then something that started with a V.
“The student’s name is Draco Malfoy, Slytherin house. Check his file for his blood type and bring me the proper blood replenishing potion,” she demanded of the young woman, meanwhile soaking the cloths in essence of dittany and trying to wipe away the blood with her left hand while her right cast a diagnostic charm
Draco complained again, but neither of them paid him any mind.
“Ah,” he said, and then seemed to run out of words entirely.
He had to admit that a small part of him had expected her to focus on helping Potter to the detriment of everything and everyone else, and he was glad to see that wasn’t the case. Instead she had been polite, as forthcoming as she could be, and had agreed to accommodate him in every way he could reasonably expect her to. Maybe he should have been surprised that they were able to interact so civilly and smoothly, but he also knew that they had long since grown up and changed from who they’d been before and during the war.
“Honestly.” Ermintrude shook her head. “Maybe you’re the one who is getting to be hard of hearing, my dear.”
Draco blinked.
Harry studies the pale figure kneeling before him. Draco is nude, all gloriously smooth skin and silver-blond hair hanging into his eyes. His hands are tied behind his back, and
“Does it not know how old I am?” Harry asked, looking mildly alarmed.
“Well…that’s the thing. He has.”
“We’re with the Auror department,” Draco sort-of-kind-of confirmed. “Our apologies for waking you. This shouldn’t take long.”
Her eyes widened. “I…”
And it’s even more maddening that I probably could have figured out some of it if the Time Room hadn’t been decommissioned.”
“Say you’re mine,” Harry whispered, and Draco, finally, let go of the darkness his mind had been clinging to so desperately.
"I'll do Marielle's office first," Harry said even before they'd come out from beneath the invisibility cloak. "Shall I find you in Penelope and Smith’s office once I'm all finished?"
to know how that poison enters the body.”
The Death Eaters whom he’d been around so much after Voldemort’s return, the many Unforgivables they’d cast. Bellatrix, Crucio. Yaxley, Imperio. The Dark Lord, Avada Kedavra, again and again.
“Things from our history? Or from just yours and Harry’s? Any secrets you two share?”
I can't believe I didn't realize it immediately."
“Do you adore him?” Sky asked gently.
“Really, it’s only a few questions,” Potter said placidly. “Won’t take much of your time at all.”
“Bake!” they chorus, and everyone under the white canopy springs into action – that is, everyone but Luna, who calmly floats over to Padma, just to touch her shoulder and wish her good luck. Harry makes a wild grab for his ingredients and gets started separating eggs, knowing he needs to get his ginger spice sponge into the oven as fast as possible, so he can focus on perfecting his maple cream filling. He likes to think his flavor combination is a good compromise between simple and complex, and the ideal way to start the competition when he doesn’t yet know what the judges are looking for.
“That
a fully trained healer.”
“Because,” she said sharply, “I don’t know what else to do with it. Vanishing it could be catastrophic. The bell jar caused a lot of unforeseen consequences, and that was just a minuscule bit of time current that, from all I understand, snapped back into its original position right away. An amount of Time Sand as large as this is far more unpredictable and powerful. It isn’t even a magical substance as such, otherwise I could at least measure and calculate, but this…it’s just…it’s this strange, foreign element.”
“Marvelous, simply marvelous,” Molly says happily as the cake disappears. The crowd cheers.
“So, show me what you’re working on and let me help, you fopdoodle,” she said. “It’s your fault that I’m here, therefore it’s your fault that I’m sitting around being bored. I know whatever you’re doing is important and at least a little bit time-sensitive, and two heads are better than one.”
remains the best beta a writer can wish for.
“How?” she whispered.
“We can’t share details about the investigation, sorry,” Potter said absent-mindedly as he wrote. Draco couldn’t help but smile. Both of them should have known it wouldn’t be possible to have Potter quietly in the background as they questioned people. His Auror training and instincts were far too prevalent. And they worked well together, or at least Draco thought so.
figured it out, you’re just hoping we won’t notice,” Smith scoffed.
Why was Harry so convinced of that?
“Yes,” Sky said. “But don’t ask me how to go about doing that, I just work on a bus. If you don’t mind, I have a question for you now though. How come you’re wanting a round trip? Not very many people like to ride the Knight Bus for the fun of it, oddly enough.”
“It’s alright.” There’s a hand squeezing his, and he blindly squeezes back, feeling thankful and confused. “Maybe we can just…practice some spells together. Defence? I’m good at defence.”
“You just had to one-up me, didn’t you. Tosspot.” Draco sounds miffed.
Theo whistles lewdly, causing Draco to give him a dirty look. “To plot revenge on all of these idiots?”
“Hm. I know a spell that can untangle a rope, I can try it if you like?”
“Harry told me you healed him,” said Bones. “I…thank you for that. It’s a shock, seeing him again, but I’m glad I could.”
Harry waited until he was finished and then said, “Thanks, I think.”
“No, I can’t.”
Theo’s face finally clears. “Oh, that! Well, we figured you two had finally gotten around to sneaking out and doing the dirty somewhere, just like they predicted.”
Draco had been given a space in one of the empty offices between the Time Room and the Hall of Prophecy. One of the first things he had done after completing the basic setup was to look at a drop of Potter’s blood both with magic and a Muggle microscope, and subsequently curse up a storm.
Things were different, after that time during the thunderstorm. It wasn’t a glaring difference, it was a subtle one, so subtle that Draco didn’t even notice at first. They continued to meet, and Harry hurt Draco, and Draco was on his knees and begged for more until the rush of it made him dizzy. But the way Harry treated him, during and after…
“Had a nightmare,” Draco muttered.
“Did she finally let you see it?”
“Is that good?” Harry asked.
Parvati said, “I’m going to regret this, I just know it.”
Draco blots at a red stain on his otherwise white shirtsleeve with his handkerchief. “Blast. That’ll never come out.”
“Keep your head down until I figure it out,” he instructs. “And maybe try to distract Granger.”
“Could have picked better friends than you,” Draco grumbled as he followed with the plant.
On top of that, she had absolutely no poker face, so he could be sure her offer wasn’t some kind of underhanded way to sabotage him, which was good to know, just in case.
want to buy chocolate?”
“It wouldn’t have helped you solve it,” Draco said. “What happened is a bit insane, and we haven’t even figured out the extent of it yet, but it’s the reason why we are so interested in who’s behind this.”
“Kenneth Spindlewheel.”
“Well then you’ll need to tell me what it bloody
“Harry!” she screamed, and the fear in her voice was so tangible it hurt to hear. “Harry,
Eden grinned at him and vanished through a doorway.
Once again, Potter’s body shuddered, and kept shuddering.
“Spreading seasonal cheer.”
Neville winced. “Not without destroying the entire garden’s root strengthening charms,” he said. “But then again, I’d say getting Harry out is more important than the charm, so-”
agree to the charm once I know more, but I won’t allow you to cast anything on me if I have no idea at all why you’re even casting it.
“You can’t prove it’s a nude painting,” Draco said haughtily. “In fact, I don’t even know what you’re talking about. It’s abstract, Pansy, you’re not supposed to be able to tell what it is. The curator told me her personal perception of it is a calico kitten playing with a ball of yarn. See, this here’s the tail, and the yarn is the thing over there.”
“It’s for a good cause.”
“Are you alright?” Harry asked, and that was when Draco realized his hands were shaking.
Potter moistened his lips. “The title and artist are on the back.”
“You don’t sound terribly excited about it.”
“I can’t even remember the last time I was in here,” Draco said and tried his best not to fidget as they walked past stacks of plain Hogwarts uniforms in all sizes and racks filled with various styles of dress robes, most of them horribly out of fashion. He wished he could have claimed this trip down memory lane was a pleasant one. They rarely were though, for him.
Harry sat obediently. “Right, so, I think…I think he cares.”
“Fair.” Draco laid the letter aside and slid back down under the blankets. “Come warm me up.”
“It’s very good,” Pansy tries to assure her. “Fresh jam, flaky pastry, still warm; I picked it up from the kitchens myself. I know you’re a bit partial to them, so I thought you might enjoy a slice while you study.”
She stared at him. "I knew there was magic to do it, of course, but I always thought, well..."
“Yeah, apparently. And, as you may have guessed, we have no idea why.”
Harry’s stack of sponges is a bit wonky, but he’s pretty sure he’s got the order right, darkest to lightest. It’s a good thing, because time is almost up, and he has yet to make his ganache, which is supposed to cover the outside of the cake. As he starts heating up his cream, he notices from the corner of his eye that Draco is doing the same.
“What?” Draco asked and stared at Harry, whose expression had undergone a remarkable change. “You’ve…Merlin, Potter, you’ve figured it out, haven’t you?”
“I can do that,” Draco said after some consideration. He would have agreed to a whole lot more to ensure that Harry kept doing what he was doing.
There was a hissing sound. Harry jumped a bit when he saw a grumpy-looking Kneazle suddenly sitting on the armrest of his chair.
After several long seconds of contemplative silence, Hermione looked over to Draco. “I wanted to talk to you about that. The antidote, I mean.”
Draco stood in the doorway to his office and wondered if he was actually going to faint. He’d been standing there for at least three minutes, his mind racing faster and faster as he tried to figure out what was going on.
“Because I’m the one here who’s most qualified to speak for Harry right now, since he can’t do it himself,” Granger informed him without missing a beat. Smith looked like he wanted to argue, but then he seemed to decide that it was pointless while most of his focus had to be elsewhere.
“I did already point out to her that he isn’t even awake to see it,” Smith said from the corner with an exaggerated sigh, apparently assuming Draco would agree with him.
“You have Muggle money on you?”
Draco groaned. “Magic have mercy.” Then, he frowned. “Did you say Blaise is upset with me?”
didn’t know it?” he asked.
Weasley reached across the table to take her hand. “It’s going to be fine though. Right? If we’re careful, it has to be fine.”
Potter crossed his arms and, by the looks of it, would have kept arguing, but Granger talked before he could. “I wonder whether you knew you’d be travelling in time before it actually happened, or to which point you’d travel. Or if you knew you would lose your memory before the first time you travelled.”
“…you think?” It sounds obnoxiously like Weasley.
“Well it can’t have, if you’re sitting here all hurt and upset and heartbroken,” said Philomena.
“Over my dead body,” said Potter. “That poor child.”
“Tomorrow.”
“Because we found one where Orval Amado was killed. So, either our culprit is ridiculously good at sneaking into the Department of Mysteries and getting back out, or…”
“Has she been able to read this?” he asked.
The next cake has the crowd gasping in amazement and makes Kingsley’s jaw drop. It’s a tiered cake, stacked off-center, sculpted to look like a rocky hill, with a little creek made from sugar syrup flowing from the very top to the bottom through a series of waterfalls. Harry is shocked how much it looks like actual water, and he can’t even begin to imagine which spells it might take to create a moving river that won’t soak into the sponge. Butterflies, made from a delicate sort of edible paper, perch on the cake and flutter their wings.
“Absolutely not,” Granger said emphatically in a way that made Draco think she had already considered and dismissed the possibility. “Not even by accident. No one goes near the Veil these days apart from the readings we take, and those are only for observation, to make sure it isn’t doing anything bloody weird. Not that it didn’t do something bloody weird anyway, but.” She flailed out a hand as though insinuating that the Veil’s apparent recalcitrant qualities didn’t concern her overmuch at the moment.
“Ugh, you’re impossible!”
“’Oh, good
He glares. “If you didn’t believe me, why did you even come to the kitchens with me?”
“Mind if I sit with you?” Potter asked.
“Would also have stopped Orval from running to get help,” Draco thought out loud. “Or even…would it have prevented a Patronus leaving, do you think?”
“Clearly,” the person said, stepping into his field of vision. Harry blinked.
Hands unbuttoned his shirt with haste, greedily slipped beneath to touch his chest. Draco moaned and leaned into the warm touch. He felt dizzy, shaky. No longer thinking, he crashed to his knees. His hands were shaking with eagerness as he popped buttons, sought skin. Finally, he managed to free Harry's cock, and even though they had rubbed off against each other countless times, he had never gotten to look or touch before. This was new. This was... wonderful.
“Your name’s Bug?” Harry asked to make sure he’d heard it right. The goblin child promptly hid his face in his mother’s flowery tunic.
“What?” everyone else in the room asked at once.
Draco thought.
Harry looked sheepish for a moment, which amplified the gnawing feeling of self-loathing that had become Draco's constant companion. What in Merlin's name was he even going on about? He knew as well as everyone else that his family deserved every punishment they'd gotten; the seizing of their accounts, the Azkaban sentence for his father, the house arrest for his mother. Draco himself had gotten off so lightly it was almost ridiculous. It made him feel like scum. He still carried himself well these days, posture and expression maintained with what little pride he had left as to hide the mess beneath.
“Yeah, I haven’t figured out that part yet,” Potter sighed. “But I wanted to let you know before I start asking around for ideas.”
“It is not.”
“I’m going to keep calling you Granger,” Draco announced, just in case anyone had been wondering.
The lights scattered and reformed into
Hermione exclaimed her surprise at that point, interrupting what had probably been an insult in the making. “I had no idea this existed! That’s brilliant, Draco, thank you.”
“Oh,” Potter said and stuffed his hands in his pockets. “Alright. Will you tell her thanks? She’s the one who went to talk to Susan and told her about what happened to me.” He was still frowning, and Draco wanted to explain that he hadn’t meant to sound like an arsehole, but the words wouldn’t come.
Draco felt Blaise’s grip on his elbow, puling him out of the Pensieve. He couldn’t stop a breath of utter relief from leaving him when he found himself back in the Thought Room, no Fiendfyre to be seen.
“Not much, she was very upset,” Parvati said. “I did send one of the department’s mind healers her way, so with any luck, I can get a bit more out of her tomorrow. Sylvana had only been back home for a few minutes before she died though, so Cristina doesn’t know much about how she might have gotten poisoned.”
Severus nodded grimly and, after sparing a single glance for Harry, who was still huddled on the floor, stepped up to the patient. Wordlessly, he pushed Madam Pomfrey’s hands aside and removed the cloths, drew his wand in one fluid movement and traced the cut across Draco’s torso. His murmuring, which sounded much like a chant, was echoed by the walls of the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey watched anxiously and sighed with profound relief when the wound actually began to close.
“Yes, let’s try and avoid that.” Harry frowned. “Isn’t there a muggle film about a man who is stuck in a time loop, but it doesn’t break even when he kills himself?”
It was…another painting.
Oh, Merlin’s hairy
“You idiot, Potter,” Draco said then. His hands left Harry’s hair and started working on opening his trousers. “You’re such an idiot, how could you not notice how much I want you?”
“Let’s call it a time-honed tradition,” said Draco. “She can join the elite family of plant-children.”
“Do you know if Draco has a spade?” Pansy asked. “You could dig him out.”
Harry took several slow steps toward the barrier. “Maybe you can tell us, Penelope? I know you’re standing right there, your glamour isn’t good enough to fool me, now that I know where to look.”
“Yes it was. You were wrong, so now you’ll never know.”
“I do, yes. You should talk about it with him as well though – I might not have time to talk him through the logic of it whenever it ends up being relevant.”
“I don’t understand,” Pansy said.
Somewhere toward the back of the bus, Evadne sneezed. “Bless you!” everyone called out.
you owe me. I lulled you into a false sense of security and used it against you, like the Slytherin I am.”
Anyway, a very-similar-to-a-romantic-gesture non-romantic gesture seemed like something that might fix Harry’s huge screw-up.
too?” Harry asked, sounding stunned.
“No. I won't.”
"Is it explosive?" he asked warily.
“Figures,” Draco muttered. He didn’t often use them, as it was easily possible to build up a tolerance. He had a feeling he might need a fair few of them during the next few days, though.
“About?”
Granger frowned. “Odd. So apparently it only starts working after it is well-distributed?”
"Merlin help us." Draco put his head in his hands just as he hear the Floo whooshing once more, and then again.
"Not quite, no," said Blaise. "It doesn't take any casting at all, just the combination of the magi-grown peppermint, the alcohol and the liqueur – has to be some kind of berry variety, else it’ll collapse immediately. Depending on the quality of the ingredients and the care with which you prepare it, the separation can last for quite some time.”
“How bad is it?” he asked.
Sliding out of bed, Draco failed to find his shoes in the dark and left the dorm barefoot, trying to keep Harry Potter firmly off his mind. And still, his wandering brought him to the bathroom that had become theirs weeks ago. He sat there, huddled in a corner, and tried to remember the emotions that flooded him every time he was here with Potter, the content peacefulness. He thought about how Potter had held him just hours before, how his teeth had sunk into the flesh of Draco's shoulder, and he wished Potter was here right now to do it all again.
a strange sight, but it was also difficult to stay sad and gloomy when there was an optimistically grinning snowman peering out through the panes of glass, by the looks of it having a grand old time confusing as many people as possible.
At least eight house-elves turn his way. “Bakewell tart, Sir?” the tiniest one of them, who has the highest voice Draco has ever heard from anyone, asks.
“Have you tried catnip?” she asked, and Draco immediately started wondering if Victoria had spent too much time with Luna Lovegood lately. He would have to keep a very,
Draco looked down at the corpse of Orval Amado and tried his damndest to remain calm.
“Blaise,” Draco responded, off-handedly.
His hair was even messier than usual, the top buttons of his shirt had been ripped open, his cloak hung, askew, over one shoulder. His glasses had also seen better times. On top of that, he had a black eye, his cheek was red and swollen, and his upper lip had been split.  He handed over the shabby potions book with the frayed cover with hands that were reddened at the knuckles.
“You were with your mother when she died, weren’t you?”
“I can’t help but wonder if I would have been one of those bullies if she'd gone to school with me.”
“I think doing it as late as possible would minimize the risk of that.”
“I need your help,” she said without preamble.
He should have realized it long before now. “Sorry, but I have some
Selwyn sighed deeply, opened his mouth, closed it again, and let his shoulders slump. “Yes,” he said.
“I will,” he said.
“Moving on,” Ron says hastily.
Draco stiffened his back and tried to look as proud as one could while huddled up on a bathroom floor.
It was a sobering thought, that some of the messages must have been written to fix some tragedy that had happened during the previous iteration. Draco put his fork down. The salmon suddenly felt like a lump of lead in his stomach.
“I’ll buy you a new cloak once I’ve got access to the Potter vault back, how’s that?” Harry offered, then looked around. “Right, I’m going to cast a Notice-Me-Not.”
“’Rose’,” Draco burst out. “Make it ‘Rose’, there isn’t a single reason she’d have tried that before they decided on it for a baby name, and afterwards, I can’t imagine her
“So how do you actually deactivate the poison?” she asked eagerly.
“That cow,” Draco said affectionately.
“Can I see how you decode it?” Potter asked. “You don’t have to show me the message…I mean, you
Draco really should have seen it coming, he could admit that much to himself. The feelings weren’t even
“Yes, he, er…was quite the…specimen.” Potter was looking down at his feet as he said it, and Draco had to steer him out of the way of a family of five.
“Isn’t that also a form of misconduct?” Draco pointed out. “Right, that’s it. Four days and two hundred and twelve ingredients, just for the record, but I’ve done as much as I can. Once the stasis is gone, everything should happen quite quickly.”
“If I can accept it’s not Granger, then you can accept it isn’t Blaise, Harry. We’ve had this conversation already, remember? I’ve known him since we were eight or nine. He’s an excellent liar when he needs to be, but I do know his tells. It’s not him.”
Harry will never know what comes over him when they walk to the back of the tent after time has been called. As Draco bumps shoulders with him, Harry snatches his previously injured hand almost on reflex, turning it over and studying the pale red line across the palm.
“Maybe,” she said.
"We drink it, obviously."
“Yes, they certainly did. Oh, for Merlin’s sake.” The witch raised her wand once more and took control of the broom, which had started sweeping the wall. “None of this nonsense, now, you hear me?”
“Is it something bad?” asked Potter.
“You should come to my room,” Potter tells him as soon as they separate.
He was just seven lines into his essay on alternative uses of Dittany when a throat cleared, the sound familiar. Draco looked up and into green eyes.
kind of breakfast pastries, the ones from the patisserie a few blocks from Draco’s flat.
He couldn’t help the snort that escaped him at that nonsensical statement, and tiredness mixed with irritation was finally getting the best of him. “
“You think you can swoop in and make things okay again?” he rasped, looking at her for the first time in the conversation. “You… you have no idea, Granger.”
“A terrifying one,” said Weasley around the candy cane he was sucking on, which seemed to have formed an ‘s’ shape.
Victoria rolled her eyes again. “Oh, yes, why would you want to know what he’s feeling, that couldn’t possibly help.”
There was more silence as Parvati looked to be processing. “And why did this Hank person need to come along to question witnesses, then?” she asked. “It was a risky thing to do, and there’s no reason. He’s just a victim, and if he asked leading questions or anything, he might have messed up–”
“Uh,” Potter says intelligently, and then, before Draco can think about what he’s doing, he is grabbing onto Potter’s arm in a panic and dragging him away in an attempt to save them both from the insanity bug.
“Yes, of course I do, but it’ll go faster if she has help.”
“We aren’t Aurors though,” Potter pointed out.
to feel maddening.
“Are you asking me or telling me?”
“Potter!” Draco hissed. “What in Merlin’s name are you doing?”
there.”
That makes Draco pause. Sane Granger is scary enough and packs a mean punch – literally – and he does not want to find out how much more vindictive a not-sane Granger might be. “Fine, we’ll interrogate very politely.”
“That
“Right,” Victoria said. “Didn’t touch or pierce the skin, got it. What does that leave?”
Potter shrugged. “Just to teach him a lesson, really. Disarm him, shock him, beat him up…something like that.”
“I didn't know what else to do.” Potter remained infuriatingly calm. When Draco turned his attention to the herbs and started chopping, Potter sidled up right next to him so he could keep talking into Draco's ear. “You have to admit, what happened was worrying. I don't want you to hurt, Malfoy, no matter what you may think. I want to help you fix whatever is wrong.”
“Well that’s good to hear,” said Graglor. “But then what’s the problem with this Leroy?”
“It’s okay,” Harry repeated. “You’re allowed to need.”
“Yeah,” Draco muttered.
Granger opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, Draco blurted out, “You could stay with me.”
There was a long pause. Just as Draco realized he should probably offer Potter a seat, and he opened his mouth to do so, Potter spoke.
had he just brought up his lack of a sex life in front of Potter?
“I don’t know!” he exclaimed. “I don’t…how can we make ourselves figure out sooner that Clearwater did it?”
In response, she glared at him in rather admonishing fashion.
, don’t you see?”
Draco cleared his throat. He could feel his face heating as he tried and failed to keep the images from his mind’s eye, and he realized with alarm that Granger was giving him a puzzled frown. Averting his eyes seemed like an excellent idea, and not only because of the unlikely possibility that she was a Legilimens. He plucked a candy cane from the bowl purely to have something in his hands that he could stare at, then frowned in confusion when it wiggled in his fingers and changed shape into the letter ‘E’. A Wheezes product, presumably, although he couldn’t manage to see the point of it.
“That…actually makes sense,” said Weasley, looking as though agreeing with Draco was physically uncomfortable.
Granger looked uncomfortable. Draco was opening his mouth to try and clarify he hadn’t meant to sound suicidal, but she shook her head and cleared her throat. “Anyway…out of the lot of us, Marielle is best equipped to handle the room. She’s been through a lot in life, love and loss and everything in between. She understands it as well as anyone can hope to, I think.”
He wondered if any of the other Dracos in previous iterations of the time loop had just, well,
“But that’s the genius of it!” Draco tried to explain. “I will tell people it’s a picture of a kitten, and if they see anything else, I claim that their depraved mind is simply playing a trick on them. That should shut them up nicely.”
For a long while, he simply sat there, looking on as his student kept recovering, and thinking. Then, suddenly, he straightened. Where was Potter? Hadn’t he said something about five minutes? How long had the impertinent brat been gone, twenty-five? Just as Severus was about to leave his chair and fetch the smug, arrogant wretch who was more than likely dawdling on purpose, a disheveled-looking Potter stepped through the door.
Ordinary stasis charms had limitations. They held once cast, and they froze most of the body’s processes, but others they only slowed, and that hindered some poisons more than others. Even with stasis charms, Draco’s work was often a race against time.
“A man in a…in a very strange costume.”
“That’s why they were so eager to recommend you.” Parvati blew out a dismissive breath. “I should have known.”
were invasive, the sorts of questions we’re about to ask might not be received well. Best way to make her feel at ease and get something out of her.”
“Killing a high-ranking ministry employee who has never once in her life accepted anyone but a pureblood for a prestigious internship. Killing a man who preyed on women when his higher-ups ignored
There was the sound of footsteps. Draco closed his eyes.
“If she’s not in her office, try the Space Room or the Hall of Prophecy.”
“Right, here’s a progress report on the poison: I’ve made no progress.”
“But –” Draco started, and promptly gave up because she had already thrown in the Floo powder. Potter was in the room a second later – or at least that was what it felt like – and Draco had had no chance to prepare.
"Devious plan," Draco said faintly.
“Bloody bird,” Draco swore, a little too loudly. From the corner of his eye, he could see several heads turn, but he ignored them and focused on untying a small piece of parchment. Draco scowled, but his curiosity won out over the little voice that warned him to incinerate the damn thing without even reading it. He was never going to get over Harry this way.
sked yet another note. Draco brushed his fingers over it, and Potter shivered.
Even a simple “What do you want, Potter?” was too much for Draco to manage. He opened his mouth and closed it again, then turned away, reaching for the wormwood on his workstation instead. He tossed it into his mortar and grabbed his pestle.
"Don't hex me for asking," he started.
He trailed off when he glanced up and saw Potter standing there, looking even more awkward than before.
Clara looked thoughtful. “She didn’t say. Shivered once or twice though.”
Potter shrugged and looked a bit sheepish. “Keep my head down, basically.”
“Why don’t you have any other Christmas decorations in your flat, anyway?”

The blood began to rush in Draco’s ears as he read the words, read them again, then a third time, but he still couldn’t make sense of them. Why was Potter pretending he had painted this? And how had he gotten…how had he…why…?
“I may actually murder you,” Blaise announced as he stepped out of the floo. “No sane person would blame me. No court would convict me. You
“Afternoon,” said Potter and lifted a hand to indicate his surroundings. “It’s difficult to tell in here.”
“What is that, anyway, the notebook?” Draco asked when they were on their way quite a bit later.
“Yes?” Sky asked, leaning toward him with wide, concerned eyes.
Potter snorted. “Because it says so.” He reached for his wand and revealed the very small bit of writing in the crook of his elbow.
“Yes,” said Potter. He lifted his head to look at Draco, who felt warm breath brush his jaw and realized suddenly just how close Potter was.
“Oh my,” Molly says, taking in the mess the contestants have made at and around their stations. Dirty baking sheets, whisks, and icing sugar have been flung anywhere and everywhere. Along with Kingsley, she starts perusing the rolls lined up on the table in front of them. The judging is anonymous, as to avoid accusations of favoritism, since the contestants have been picked from all four houses and all over the popularity spectrum. Harry sees his creation sitting there, all the way to the judges’ left, and hates how long he’s going to have to wait until he knows whether they like it.
“Sorry,” Harry winced when she’d stood and was giving him a glare.
“Know what?” he croaked.
A glance told him that Potter was looking as concerned as Draco felt.
“So, um. Goyle.” It’s Ron’s turn to interview a contestant. “What are you making?”
Potter barked a laugh. Then he gestured toward Honeydukes as they were passing it. “Did you want to stop by now?”
“Lovely as it is to listen to your
“Alright,” she said and took a few shaky steps into the living room. Draco didn’t think she was entirely sober. She also wasn't wearing shoes and he feared for the soles of her feet.
“Not…as such, no.” Who the fuck had written this? And what in Merlin’s name were they talking about? “Just very confusing.”
“How’d you end up getting rid of it?” Potter asked.

inappropriate,” Pansy sighed. “Draco, seriously, you can’t just hang a nude painting in your office.”
Severus sighed when the boy was finally out of the doors, and rubbed the ridge of his nose. Then he glanced at Draco, who was looking better by the minute. Some color had returned to his skin, and his breath was even and steady, a sure sign that his body was healing and the potions were doing their work. If Potter had actually managed the unthinkable, to kill Draco, it would have meant Severus’ own death as well. Once again, he asked himself just when the stakes had been raised so high.
