Draco must have unconsciously made a face, because Karl soothed, “I’ll talk you through it. Lie down for me?”
“Of course I can, Harry,” she said. “You know, I really can’t tell you how much better I feel after having this talk.”
There was no way Draco could stomach food after that incident. It only reminded him of the hatred he’d endured in the Wizarding World and all of the reasons why he left. “You go on,” Draco mumbled. “I need to check on a wild Potter.” He shrugged off his teammates’ calls of encouragement as he strode off the field too, heading for Potter.
Unable to resist from tucking in any longer, Harry retrieves a clean plate and spoons out some of the delicious dessert. The reflection he tried to do earlier seems more elusive than ever, and all he can process is Draco made him his own personal treacle tart. He’s savoring every bite, unable to help the nagging feeling Draco cooked for him out of love. Only a moment later, Harry’s convinced he must be going insane, because he and Draco are only just becoming friends. But
“Perhaps it’s perfect for your brazen stubbornness,” said Draco. “But not all of us prefer to emulate creatures that act now and think later.”
Otarres’s eyes lit up. “Actually, I did hear something earlier this week. One of the professors in Rhetoric is on the Board of Directors for a non-profit organization, and they were looking to hire grant writing interns.”
“Well…” and to her surprise, Harry hesitated a little. “I’ve had to start watching my weight. Happy hour on Friday, pizza on Saturday, brunch on Sunday; it all adds up.”
Draco lobbed one of the balls at Potter’s head. “Maybe, but the result is definitely worth the effort.”
When Jake finally released him, Draco managed to turn and retreat gracefully back to his spot in the circle, but his face was burning. Naturally, this fact was noticed and he was passed one of several bottles of whiskey and a shot glass. “Two shots!” they crowed gleefully.
“Here, Abby,” Draco cooed, offering a treat before requesting that she take the envelope. Unfooled by his flattery, Abalona, chirped unhappily.
“– That you’d be their Saviour for real.” Draco nodded appreciatively. “Good one, Potter. You can probably imagine my costume taking on similar significance.”
“Actually,” he corrected, “We never had the courage to oppose her. Or at least I never did. So I want to thank you. You did all of us a great service.”
Her response was faint and his immediate thought was that someone died. “Is Harry okay?” He raced into the kitchen and cast a Lumos only to find Hermione sitting at the kitchen table with two neat piles of letters in front of her.
Ron and Hermione check on Harry one more time before they go to sleep, observing that he’s sleeping dreamlessly as promised. They head to their bedroom, knowing there’s nothing more they can do for him tonight.
True to his word, as he started to move, Harry found himself in a deeply pleasurable state where he never knew what was coming next because Draco was varying the depth and speed of his motions. Draco felt exquisite as always, clenched around his cock, but it was very different, not being in control. He decided he liked it, perhaps not every time, but for now it was fantastic.”
they’d been allowed out on the playing field again, and Harry had been in heaven pushing his muscles to the limits with running. Though Quidditch usually fulfilled a need deep within him, Harry couldn’t help but feel a true sense of freedom when he was sprinting around the bases. He still couldn’t believe how fast some of his teammates could get the ball to the bases; Nels, for example, possessed a brutally wicked arm. Harry almost wondered if she would make a decent pitcher while he was diving back to second base. Mike laughed at his panicked breathing before slapping his mitt against Harry’s side anyway after catching the ball.
The moment just wouldn’t seem to end, so she asked, “Are you hungry? Harry and I made some sandwiches earlier if you want some.” That seemed to be the magic word. Ron released Hermione and followed her inside the house, relief evident in his face. While she couldn’t say that she was
“Right,” he says, forcing all thoughts of sex out of his mind. Harry meets Seamus’s gaze again and confirms their plans for tomorrow. Out of the corner of his eye as he opens the door, Harry sees the brunet back up and let Seamus mount him. Aroused beyond belief and nearly kicking himself for not participating, he gets the hell out of there.
“You might have to give him a week,” Draco smirked, apparently already over it. “Admittedly, I wasn’t expecting you to expand on our prompts in quite that manner, but I’m glad you did. It made for a better interview.” Harry snorted.  “It did,” Draco insisted, chuffing Harry’s head.
Harry’s attention is reclaimed; however, as a blonde dancer pulls out an empty chair, stands on it, and pulls open his trench coat before gyrating his pelvis against Seamus’s face. For his part, Seamus is grinning as he laps at the man’s thonged crotch with his tongue. Though Harry has seen Seamus involved in sexual acts countless times, and had even been drawing into participating in one unknowingly just an hour or so before, he can’t help but continue to be turned on. His mate is fucking hot, even though he’s a pill.
“Yeah, I know exactly what you mean,” nods Harry. “But we didn’t know what he was like now. I’ll just go out with him this one time and see how it goes. I mean, it’s not like I can take you out to the gay bars.”
“Thank you, sir,” Draco finally managed. His throat had constricted painfully upon hearing Otarres say such nice things about him, and also realizing that his professor might indeed know him more intimately than he originally thought.
He found himself near a V of birds and headed pell-mell towards them, scattering the flock. It almost brought a smile to his face, but not quite. At lightning speed, Harry switched direction and executed two barrow rolls before diving into a perfect Wronski Feint. It wasn’t right. Normally he would be laughing with excitement and aching with a sense of overwhelming content by now, but Harry still felt nothing.
Draco obliged, but he was still tense. Harry gently massaged his back in an effort to calm him, trying desperately to convey love through his touch. When he reached Draco’s lower back, he knelt, kissing Draco’s skin until he trembled. “Laevoa” Harry murmured, conjuring silky lube and warming it between his fingers before gently teasing Draco’s furl, slipping the top part of his finger inside in an effort to make him want more.
It was getting easier and easier to slip back into performing as the Malfoy he’d been before the War. Draco wasn’t worried about anyone hexing him, not after how things had gone down last time, and he was steadily reclaiming some of his old behaviors, however petulantly. There were many he retired for good, but some would probably always be part of him. Like his tendency to try and outshine Granger in everything academic and take the title of class valedictorian. The victory was so sweet, he could almost taste it.
Malfoy takes a deep breath, looking away for a moment. “During that year when he wasn’t out recruiting giants, Macnair would visit my quarters at the Manor. He’d bring Yaxley with him, though Yaxley never sought me out himself. Father was no longer in the Dark Lord’s good favor, so he couldn’t do anything to protect me.”
He wished that he could glamour his appearance as to avoid Ginny. She had become practically inseparable from his side, especially after he revealed that he was almost ready for the Auror entry exam. Harry was forced to instruct Kreacher to tell Ginny he was out during the day or sleeping if she ever came by during the evening. It was only so long that he’d be able to brush her off. He still cared for her, of course, but not with the same level of passion that he’d had in abundance during his sixth year.
“Shh, Potter,” says Malfoy softly. He rinses the rag again, taking a second to ghost his fingers over Harry’s back. “I’ve got you.”
“No, not really,” admitted Potter reluctantly. “All the traveling I did was related to hunting Voldemort.”
that Harry's leaving would bother him. He’d seen apprehension and misery written all over Draco’s face in the last few days before he left and had chosen to ignore it, telling himself that it would quickly pass.
Harry let him have the last word and instead focused his attention on lavishing affection on Draco, kissing all the little places he’d longed to have access to for the better part of three years. They lay there comfortably together in the darkness of their office, in no rush to leave, and Harry briefly reflected back on the Orange and Black Ball. Perhaps there would be a reason to celebrate Halloween in the future after all.
Malfoy turned on his heel, stomping back down the corridor towards the outer grounds of Hogwarts so he could Apparate out.
He’d told Ron and Hermione that it would have been way too awkward for Ginny if he’d come over after breaking up with her the previous night, but he knew she really was strong enough to see him. The truth was that he didn’t want to be there. Along with his now ex-girlfriend and the Ministry, the Weasleys’ put a whole other set of expectations upon him. They were his family and he loved them, but it was too much to think of going over there and laughing at jokes, eating cake, and acting normally.
One of Malfoy’s curses lands right on Asten’s clothed genital region, but Harry is unable to note the effects because the man wraps himself in a shield of Dark magic and Disapparates. Without a trace of weariness, Malfoy sheaths his wand and glances at Harry. It is intimate, raw, and incredibly embarrassing, and all Harry wants was to sink into the floor and preferably be tranquilized. There is no way of knowing how Malfoy is going to react and no defense against him…Harry tries accessing his magic again and fails.
Cecelia smiled, but looked distracted. “Bring your Harry back soon. It was wonderful to see you again, Draco.” She and Draco embraced, and Harry gave a quick thank you, feeling rather awkward. But as if they were old friends, Cecelia gave him a parting hug as well. She was on the verge of saying something, but the customer impatiently called out to her. In an undertone, Cecelia said, “If you both could just put the skeins and hooks back in the teaching crate, I’d really appreciate it. Goodbye now,” she called, walking away.
“I’ll take care of the dishes,” Draco amended, spooning extra eggs onto Harry’s plate. “What?” he said in response to Harry’s odd look. “You need nourishment, obviously.”
Funny that Potter should approach him on the last day of his life. If it was any other day, Draco would have told him to fuck off and never bother him again, but desperate times called for desperate measures. And Potter wasn’t wholly unattractive, either.
They didn’t last long after that. He kissed Draco, holding him close in the way he knew Draco liked, paid special attention to how Draco wanted his cock, and gave him a couple of soft slaps on the bum to send him over. Within seconds, Draco was coming, cock untouched. Strangely, Harry was extremely proud of them both for such a successful first attempt.
He wrote back immediately, thanking Otarres profusely, and then sent a polite email to Merram asking when would be a good time for them to meet. Draco was almost afraid to get too excited, because he still couldn’t be sure if it was for real or not.
Potter looked like he was trying not to be defensive. “My former arch-rival. Malfoy, we hated each other for seven years. I know we’ve gotten closer, but it’s really only been a couple of months.”
Draco winced. “Speak for yourself, Potter. My muscles haven’t been properly relaxed since we started this miserable task.”
get any better. Maybe if he’d gotten up on the right side of the bed, the media wouldn’t have ambushed him and pushed Draco farther away when they’d been doing so well together. Or maybe, a little voice inside of his head chided, if you’d kept your big mouth shut your relationship with him would have developed naturally over time instead of when you decided to rush everything along as usual.
“I’d like to officially apologize for everything I did or said to you at school,” Draco said, trying not to cringe from the awkwardness of the situation. “I’m hoping we can have a fresh start.”
Draco fixed him with a deathly look. “Now, now,” Jake smiled, “You weren’t wearing that cold face last night when I-”
They stand, and Harry says, “I actually wouldn’t mind finishing the walk.” He gives Draco a serious but meaningful look.
Kingsley chuckled. “Take the night off. There will be plenty of time for you and Draco to get your hands dirty later.”
Vanessa gave a tight-lipped smile and said, “Well, then, I’ll just set these down and get out of your hair.” She wasted no time in heading for the door.
“Bye,” said Draco, reflecting on how different some muggles were from each other. The man and his family were skittish and brutish, while the girl was much more open and relaxed. He supposed his approach may have had something to do with it, and then remembered that the man had said his family was on vacation. So where were they from exactly? Wherever it was, he hoped it wasn’t California.
He Disapparated from the Manor, aiming for the school’s outer gates. Unfortunately, several of the other volunteers had the same idea. Draco slammed into a couple Hufflepuffs he used to love to torment, Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott.
“I feel the same way,” Harry said. “There’s so much I’ve wanted to tell you and ask you, you have no idea.” He laughed mirthlessly.
Harry didn’t look ready to leave, though, and Draco was loathe to tear him away from the Weasleys, especially after how rocky their relations had been up until this point.
“Where are we?” he asked wonderingly, looking around at his surroundings. There was a magnificent little gray castle with spires and circular towers that Harry couldn’t stop staring at, lying at the base of a beautiful forest and surrounded by rows of stubby little bushes.
“I suppose,” said Harry. “You did get all the good action today.” He reached into his bag and pulled out his silencer. “Unless you want to have at it, Hermione?”
They roared out of the field behind the Burrow, bumping across the uneven ground, and headed out onto the main road, tires skidding over the gravel when Hermione didn't slow for the turn, much to Ron’s dismay.
“How do you figure that, Potter?” Draco managed, sinking down on a curb to allow Potter better access to his back.
Nate was standing by the dugout, accosting each one of his players as they went to put down their ball bag and start arranging their helmets, batting gloves, and water. Only Becky Lou and José had arrived so far, and looked as if they’d been cleared for the trip.
As they came out of their own little world, Draco remembered he was standing naked in his shower with a a bathmat covering his bits. Not totally oblivious himself, Potter seemed to realize that h'ed brashly climbed into someone's shower.
Well, that certainly brought up questions even as it answered others. Harry’s stomach dropped as he thought of how life might change in the next six months. Apparently he wasn’t the only one who was feeling restless… But what intrigued him the most was Hermione’s insight about Draco. He’d clearly be graduating soon as well—what were his intentions? Just the thought that Draco’s trajectory could once again collide with his was enough to occupy Harry’s thoughts for the rest of the evening. And if he happened to place those pressed lavender flowers in a soft cloth bag and sleep with it under his pillow, well, that was a secret no one else needed to know about.
Harry watches his friend thoughtfully, weighing his options. He must take too long, because Seamus finally says, “It’s alright, Harry, next time,” before he turns to gaze after a dark haired man sidling back to a table with two blonde girls.
Harry, Cale, and Chris walked up, and Nate pounced on them immediately. “Okay, Harry and Cale are a yes, so Chris? Yes or no?” He pointed the pen at Chris in a rather threatening way.
Under his breath, Malfoy mutters a vague insult. “Weasley. I would tell you, but I’m not about to violate Potter’s trust again tonight. Go in there and give him what he wants and what you think he needs.” With that, he meets Ron’s eyes and gives a significant nod before Disapparating with a sharp
“So,” Harry said, trying to break the tension. “Would it be too soon to ask for a list of things you like about me?”
Eventually, the waiter comes back and Harry can see Draco’s still not done deciding. “I’ll have the chicken fried rice and the vegetarian spring rolls,” he says, already practically drooling, as the waiter takes down the order.
“You’re family,” said Mr. Weasley simply. He held his arms open for Harry, who rushed into them without another word. As Harry hugged Arthur, he couldn't stop himself from tearing up, comforted immensely from the love he’d been shown by the individuals surrounding him. Draco was still uneasy by the demonstrations of care and support, but he appreciated them all the same.
Draco sighed in pleasure, but not to Harry’s satisfaction. It was time. Gently pulling Draco’s bum even higher, he leaned down and softly flicked his tongue over Draco’s rim.
He was bent over, trying to find the best way to slide the rake/scoop underneath the clumps without dislodging the entire pile when a cool wind suddenly blew. It harshly rustled Draco’s hair and chilled him through his thick fleece clothes, and because Warming Charms and other creature comforts cast through a wand were not permitted, he simply had to bear the elements. At Camp Cedarwood, magic was eschewed entirely in favor of the so-called “character building” Muggle methods.
Seamus catches Harry’s eyes, giving him a thumbs up. This is clearly the performance he’d been excited for them to see.
Potter whipped out his wand and was about to hex the Weasel into next week, but Draco stepped in front of him and placed his hands on Potter’s shoulders. Hoping he wasn’t the one about to be hexed instead, Draco said, “Leave it. Either they’ll come around or they won’t."
“It’s almost done with,” he said reassuringly. “I bet we can get Luna to give you an extra piece of tart to go.”
Draco lay back and looked up at the sky. “Are you familiar with the constellations, Potter?” he asked.
Instead of being hurt, Malfoy smiled, a look at odds with his appearance. “I’m glad my father is alive, but I’ll be making my own decisions from now on. That’s why I’m here, Potter.”
“Oh, don’t make that face at me, you,” Potter teased. “As impossible as it sounds, you had a little snag in your pants and I mended it for you.”
He stepped back into the rectangular box for the third time and prepared to swing. By some magical power, or through sheer force of will, Draco didn’t really know, the batter swung again and with a loud
“Work for it then,” he proposes, an idea taking shape in his mind. “We’ve already talked about your questionable teaching ethics. It’s probably best for you to get a bit of practice in before the fall semester, so what if you take over for me at the Club and teach dueling?
He untied the parcel after refreshing Abby’s water dish, ripping through the stiff paper protecting the contents. Something green and crocheted fell into Draco’s hands, and his first thought was that, somehow, he’d gotten one of his own products back. But this dishcloth was green, not red, and it wasn’t anywhere near Draco’s quality of artisanship. Had Harry made this?
This time, Potter laughed in response to his question; pulling away to meet Draco’s gaze once more. “I meant what I told you before. I really don’t care where we go.”
“What do you mean, ‘why didn’t I?’ Would you have sex with one of your mates and two other random dudes in a sleazy bar bathroom?”
When he was finally flung out in an entirely new grate, Draco coughed and tried to get a hold of himself. He was filled with an otherworldly sense of panic at losing Potter, even though their relationship had only existed within a dream.
“You in me,” Draco says, blushing furiously. He’s never done this before, but there’s no way possible he can pass up the opportunity to have Potter inside him.
Ten minutes later, he crunched blandly on a chocolate chip biscuit while Hermione poured hot water into his favorite teacup. Gratefully, Draco tossed in his teabag, waiting for it to properly steep.
“Really?” Draco whispered. In his wildest dreams, he wouldn’t have expected Potter to return his affections. He’d tried to bury them after the trial, convinced Potter would want nothing to do with someone like him.
George followed his mother into the house, but as Harry went to step through the doorway, Mrs. Weasley turned back around and said, “Food is for family only, dear. I’m sure you both understand.”
When they finally sat down with platters of meat, eggs, pancakes, fruit, and fresh orange juice, Hermione met Draco’s eyes with nervous anticipation. “Neither of us is religious,” she stated, rather obviously, “But I feel as though we should say some kind of grace. It feels appropriate.”
“I think I can see why,” said Draco dryly, flinging himself upon the floor with abandon, facing his back to the wall. “She’s got me rooming with fucking Finnigan. As if I didn’t need
Malfoy tapped his foot. “Hate to break up this cozy get-together, but we’re burning daylight. Potter and I need to get going.”
“Aggressiveness,” amended Harry. “Come on, let’s get back to it. Maybe when the flying memos attack today, they’ll put me out of my misery once and for all.”
“Over here, Harry,” Draco answered, resolving on the spot to not let Harry know about his rejection just yet.
“You’re beautiful, you know,” Harry said, leaning in to give Draco a butterfly kiss. He eagerly returned it. It was theirs, after all; once, it had only been a promise of tomorrow, but now it was a promise as well as a memory.
ever been known for being reasonable?” He continued, “Wait, don’t answer that,” as Ron opens his mouth.
“Scratching the itch, Weaselbee?” Draco said witheringly from his spot just outside the corner fireplace, from where he had yet to move.
Without another word, Draco wet his finger again and pushed it into Harry. He gasped in response. It felt weird, but strangely good at the same time. When Draco thrust in again, this time it hit something inside of Harry that made him cry out in pleasure.
“Malfoy, there’s reports of more dung on the trail by the Lodge. Take one of the rakes down there, break up the clumps, and then shovel it off into the wilderness.”
“I want you,” Draco breathed, not sure that his body was ready but firmly convinced his heart was. Harry pulled back from the hug, which Draco reluctantly allowed, and looked Draco firmly in the eyes.
Draco said nothing but gave himself permission to embrace Nate. He recognized the victory here; could see it, smell it, and especially taste it. Zee was still pressed up against the fence, a sour look on his face. Spiting him, and in turn, recognizing his own talent, gave Draco greater satisfaction than any of the times he’d bested Potter back at Hogwarts.
“I know,” Neville said. “I told them that. I told them everything I knew you would have said, but I tried to make it sound more logical. They dismissed everything."
When Potter finally took his cock into his mouth, drawing him deep so that his nose touched Draco’s blonde curls, Draco moaned in pleasure. He was so far gone now that Potter may never be able to draw him back out of the rabbit hole. But then Potter was sucking and licking, and the way his cheeks hollowed around his cock made Draco warm with heat but also something else; something, that if he’d been with anyone other than Potter, he would have described as love and appreciation.
“Malfoy,” said Granger suddenly, as their frantic pace finally slowed, “While this brews, we should make a comprehensive list of all the ways in which we altered the recipe.”
“Thank Merlin that’s over with,” Harry breathed as they finally shut the door behind Blaise and Pansy.
“Hmm,” Harry pretends to think, trying not to let on how good it feels when Draco touches him. “Well, treacle tart is only my absolute favorite food in the whole world.”
“Rictusempra!” yelled the female Hufflepuff as the crowd jeered. Though Draco was still frozen, he could feel a thousand tickles happening simultaneously all over his body. It was torturous, not being able to scratch. He wasn’t muted, and noises of helplessness escaped him.
“How long are you expected to wait?” Ron said. “I’ll never understand how much leniency you’re giving him.”
He didn’t have time to ponder it, though; as Draco came, he clenched around Harry’s cock, and that set him off. Everything went dark as the climax flooded his body; he was only conscious of Draco squeezing him tighter, both with his arms and his arse, as he went over the edge. His vision took a few seconds to clear afterward, but when Harry opened his eyes, Draco was there, smiling.
He washed with Potter’s soap, dried off with Potter’s towel, and put on Potter’s clothes. Draco never would have expected him to have such high-quality boxers, which fit him nearly as well as his own did. Potter’s smell, which was embedded in the clothes even though they were clean, somehow comforted Draco as he combed his wet hair and went to dump his dirty laundry in his own cubby.
in that unit for the two day training he’d been forced to attend over a holiday weekend earlier that spring.
A man came out from the back room to stand behind the counter and said, “Welcome to Engima. What can we do for you today?”
“Jake,” Draco began; hand still on the door opener. “Didn’t you say you wanted to make pizza? We better get started in the kitchen before those irritating third floor girls come down and hog it all night again baking cookies.”
“Nate, I think you really have lost your mind,” Mike said. “What about our jobs? It’s not like we can all just pick up and take a road trip across the country for the
“You can count on it,” says Seamus mischievously. Harry doesn’t take the time to wonder about why he has that look on his face.
“Shut up,” laughed Draco, shoving Harry. They reached the door to their office – the largest and by far the nicest one in the department, aside from the Head Auror’s – and went in, slamming the door behind them.
Neither team scored in the first three innings, and in the bottom of the fourth Harry was up to bat again, Nate having placed him second in the batting order. The rational for that was because he could bunt well, place good base hits, and watch anything that wasn’t in his strike zone. He’d hit the ball in his first at bat, but was thrown out at first by a particularly determined third baseman. This time, there was a runner on second with no outs, and Nate gave him the signal from down the third base line to bunt.
On the way, he passed a small flower shop. On a whim, Draco turned around, deciding to go in. The shop is beautiful, but he doesn’t take any of it in. The beautiful bouquets of sunflowers and roses don’t catch his eye. Neither do the carnations, the peonies, or the hydrangeas.
Potter’s still completely dressed, so Draco worms Potter’s shirt over his head and rubs at his nipples, paying attention to how his lover sharply inhales and mewls at his ministrations.
Unsurprisingly, Draco wasn’t anywhere to be found when they pulled up to his apartment, so naturally Harry had to go fetch him. He rang the doorbell for the third time, annoyed.
in his hand, Draco read the headline, fluttering anxiety already forming in his gut: “From Saviour to Sinner: Harry Potter’s Scandalous Rendezvous with Death Eater Draco Malfoy”. Accompanying the damning words was the picture the photojournalist had snapped just before they retreated into the castle, the one with a dumbfounded Harry and Draco. Draco skimmed the article quickly and wasn't disappointed to find the expected slanderous lies against the Malfoy name and the probing questions into Harry’s mental state.
– eyes softened then and Draco knew he’d made the right call. “It’s important to me too. Come on, Harry.”
Once he’d moved back down to Harry’s nipples, Harry ran his fingers through Draco’s soft hair and twirled the ends around his finger. “You’re beautiful, you know that?” he whispered softly.
Draco caught the ringleader’s voice again as he declared, “It is now time to join Malfoy to Moaning Myrtle forever! Please follow us into the Great Hall—”
All too soon, Nate called out to Malfoy to ask if he was ready. Harry saw a lump form in Malfoy’s throat as he nodded yes.
“Not yet,” he said, rubbing his eyes. It was late, as it usually was, and they both had lab early the next morning. “Why, am I missing something that’s going to help me on Professor Baudin’s exam next week? Or...oh no,” Draco shot up, grappling around for the issue, “Don’t tell me—someone came up with our research idea, and now we’re not going to get published because they did it first, those bastards—”
“How do you have a mentor lined up already?” Draco demanded. “We didn’t even go through the interview process yet!”
“What happened?” Hermione asked, looking quite alarmed. “Oh, bloody hell—stand back, I’m coming through.”
“Er—” grunted the largest Hufflepuff. “Wilkins, are you sure about this? Malfoy never did anything that bad to us—”
Nate was jogging over now, after having retrieved his clipboard from where it leaned against the fence. “I knew Chris would get you, but I wanted you to get some extra practice in with sliding. Looks like all that time on the Slip n’ Slide paid off last week,” he said with a straight face.
“Draco,” said Harry, making eye contact for the first time since Draco had entered the kitchen, “We need to talk.”
Hermione’s eyes glinted in the firelight. “I thought we made up, Malfoy. Now you’re telling me that my husband and I aren’t competent enough to care for our best friend?”
Snapping her fingers, Hermione exclaimed, “That’s what we forgot! To research not only the work being done in
“Oh,” he moans, “Yes, Potter. Right there.” Draco can’t stop himself from wantonly twisting under Potter, trying to get him to hit that spot again.
This seemed to do the trick. Jake wrapped his right arm around Draco’s shoulders and started moving more erratically, his left hand still caressing Draco’s face. He breathed “I love you” in Draco’s ear and Draco’s entire body immediately froze. Jake rode out the rest of his orgasm, crying “Draco, Draco” and Draco couldn’t breathe, both out of disgust and because of how poorly he had judged the depth of Jake’s feelings.
“Draco,” he says, overcome with emotion and desire, “You’re beautiful.” Draco’s fully filled by Harry’s cock now, but he’s still unable to move.
“Grab a drink?” Eric asks, gesturing in the direction of the bar. Harry is about to nod yes, but then Seamus appears from the woodwork and claps a hand down on Harry’s shoulder.
“Now I recall,” said Malfoy gleefully. “And you owe me five Galleons as well!” he boasted, taking another swig of tea.
Ginny walked in to the smell of smoke, shouted “Harry!” and immediately doused the fire with a quick Aguamenti from her wand. “What the hell did you do at work today?”
There was also a twist. After the kiss had occurred, everyone else would judge whether or not the participants had enjoyed themselves, and if they had, each would do a shot. If they were blushing afterwards, two shots. Draco had not consented to the additions to the rules; as far as he was concerned, “Suck and Blow” had been close contact enough. Not that he cared about what others thought, but it would have been very difficult to leave the game and walk out of the room. After all, he’d have to see these people every club meeting for the rest of the year. Not to mention the fact he didn’t think he could walk home thanks to the whiskey.
you want to talk to Harry, eh?” Weasley said wearily. “You couldn’t have written him a letter, oh, I don’t know, maybe like two weeks ago?”
Note: This content was previously part of 14; however, in the interest of readability, it has become its own separate chapter.
For good measure, Narcissa opened the windows as well, letting in the sound of birds chirping and the smell of sweet summer air. “You see, Draco? Life goes on outside of this deathly Manor. Every day, little insignificant creatures are adapting to their new world – unlike you.”
He didn’t care about how Draco actually felt; he was only concerned with the end result: Draco’s subsequent marriage to a Pureblooded woman from a reputable family, which would theoretically restore the Malfoys’ former status and prestige.
SMACK. This time, he felt himself coming out of what must have been the best dream of his life and resolutely tried to get it back. But Draco couldn’t mistake the blow; it was one Tipsy his house elf always gave him when he couldn’t get out of bed in the morning. As a child, he'd been impossible to rouse in the morning Narcissa allowed the elf to wake Draco by any means necessary. Years later, Tipsy still abused this privilege. As he grudgingly opened his eyes, they were met by two enormous house elf eyes frantic with worry.
Draco continued his combination of sucking and licking, wetting another finger and pushing them both into Harry. The stretch was not pleasant, but because he was so aroused, the pain wasn’t an issue.
Draco took a moment before responding, scanning the outfield for Potter. The girls were already fielding pop flies, and even at such a distance, he could tell that Potter was having them work on taking their first step back. Of course any sort of teaching came naturally to Potter. The girls loved him already, what with his messy hair, shining eyes, full arse…Draco pulled himself out of that hole before he sank any further in.
His friends are shocked into silence, so Harry continues. “I kick a vase into the wall, and Draco comes bursting into the room. He duels Asten and wins. Then he cleans me with a rag, heals me, and makes sure I make it to your place safely. The next day, I stupidly go to the Club and am accidentally bound by some kid, and he rescues me again. We talked a lot, then. Oh, and Draco made me an antidote.”
They sat there in the corridor until Parkinson and Zabini finally left and Harry could return to Draco’s side.
“You’re not going to get another compliment if you starve me to death, Malfoy,” he said. “Let’s go.”
Every time they tried to quiet themselves, Harry would make a crude gesture or Hermione would attempt to look at Ron sympathetically, and then they’d be off again.
After an uncomfortably long set of pauses, they finally got out and started heading down the corridor, back to the windowless drudgery of an office that should be banned because of how depressing the atmosphere was.
“I’ll say! It would have gone much worse had I tried it on this rocky-ass field first,” Harry grinned, kicking some of the loose pebbles towards the green. Talking shit about the city’s sub-par baseball fields was collectively the team’s favorite pastime.
As soon as it lit, however, he was disarmed by an angry Harry. "You broke up with me by letter? Why would you do that, Draco?"
“Come on, handsome, I know you wanted me earlier. I could see it in your eyes and feel it in your body,” the man endears, running his hands back up Harry’s arms and locking him in place. “You wanted me then, why don’t you want me now?”
“Mate,” Ron ventures, “You know what you’re volunteering for, right? Dancing, drinking, flirting with men…”
He takes a swig of whiskey before continuing. “So the first act was really boring – just some hula dancing – but the second performance had five guys dressed in trench coats and red thongs working the audience. Each of them chose a person to incorporate into the act, and this one bloke picked me. We tangoed, and then he kissed me on the lips.”
“Haven’t you two learned how to share the tart by now?” Hermione asked innocently, an act that Harry saw right through.
"I forgive you," Harry laughed, letting go of his jealousy. "I'm glad that you're finally warming up to her. But there’s something I have to tell you,” he mumbled.
Replaying José’s movement in his head, Draco mentally determined what each of his body parts would have to do to get the ball over the plate. Finding a comfortable grip on the laces of the ball was easier than expected, and, after one last deep breath, he was pivoting on his right foot, pulling up his left, and
“Hello, Draco,” she said, still a little cautious around her nephew. “Don’t tell me you’ve grown tired of the showering at the Manor?”
happened.” He gestured towards the staggering pile on his desk, which was covered all sorts of odds and ends. It was no wonder, thought Draco, that it took so long for assignments to be graded. Otarres was busy.
“Well,” he says carefully, “I needed an excuse to get away from Seamus. He gave me the bloody dampener potion before I left, and I didn’t realize what happened until it was too late. I went into the bathroom so I wasn't
“– so sorry, Draco, but you don’t fulfill all the requirements our tenth player has to meet. I’d be fully comfortable letting you sub for any position, but you’re not a pitcher.”
Harry smiles. “I can be.” They make eye contact and burst out laughing just as the waiter arrives with the spring rolls.
“You’re weird as shit, you know that right?” asked the guy, leaning over to push open the front passenger door. “Get in, I’ll take you to where you need to go.”
“You’ve kept this a secret from me for nearly three years?” Hermione demanded, her disbelief shining through her tears.
But on that same night when they fielded grounders, Malfoy seemed much more at home, taking particularly well to middle infield. Harry recruited Cale and Chris to help out as Malfoy practiced taking the throws from the outfield, moving seamlessly between taking the throw from the cutoff as short stop and acting as cutoff as second baseman when Harry asked him to switch. Malfoy caught almost all of the balls, exerting himself to make the hard catches, and possessed a fire in his throws Harry only wished he could emulate. In fact, he thought Malfoy would make an excellent pitcher. At the first opportunity, he was planning to mention it to Nate and ask for his opinion.
“Harry’s been wonderful to me over the years,” Draco said, keeping the defensive tone firmly out of his voice. “I simply must confess,” he said, with a teasing tone of confidentiality as he leaned closer to his old friends, “That I think we’re quite ready for the next step in our relationship.”
“Merlin, that’s way too much information for me,” mumbles Harry, trying to clear his mind of the unfortunate imagery.
Harry smiled as Malfoy yelled “Duck!” and Taryn got down just in time to avoid getting her head taken off by Kelly’s throw. Naturally, Malfoy executed the catch and tag perfectly, and, from Harry’s vantage point, did so in a way that looked effortless. If he hadn’t seen Malfoy’s hard work over the past week with his own eyes, Harry would have said he’d been playing since he was a small child at least.
Hermione’s pile was a lot larger than his was, but, then again, she’d applied for more programs. Draco really only wanted to get into the school in France.
The ringleader walked towards Draco until he stood directly underneath him. He spoke quietly, so no one else could hear, and said, “You thought you were such a big man, with Daddy’s protection and the threat of the ‘Dark Lord’ behind every word you said.” He uttered a spell under his breath before waving his wand, causing Draco to feel a strange pressure in his lower stomach. “Power always got to your head. When I was just a second year, you got me a detention and lost Hufflepuff twenty points just because I had my tie done up the wrong way. Now it’s your turn to suffer.”
Without speaking, Harry walked over to George and pulled him into another long hug. “Thank you,” he managed. Thankfully, George just ruffled Harry’s hair and continued pulling on his boots. In the meantime, Draco took Harry’s hand and ran a gentle touch down his forearm.
They throw us a party at our sister camp in the middle of summer. We’ve just come off of a ten day session – of course, I had the youngest, whiniest campers – and I want nothing more than to sleep and scrub the sweat of exhaustion from my body. Instead, we’re required to attend the gathering at Camp Buckeye, and scarpering would definitely leave me with a mark on my record.
“You managed to save my life,” Harry pointed out. “If you’d identified me, things could have gone a hell of a lot differently.”
Abby chirruped, and Draco smiled. If there was something unsavory in the package, she’d have acted differently; Draco explicitly told her to watch Harry like a hawk.
“I’m sorry,” he said. “For springing my relationship with Draco on you and Ron without any sort of warning. I’m sorry that I didn’t listen to your concerns, even if I didn’t agree with them.”
“Draco,” Potter said suddenly, taking his head off of his knees. He seemed like he was gearing up for a long explanation. Draco didn’t have the patience for it.
“I’ll do one better,” Potter promises. “I’ll make it good for you.” He slides off his own pants, rubbing his cock lightly over Draco’s pucker. “Have you ever touched yourself there before?”
Sleep did not come naturally. It never did, anymore. Between vivid nightmares of Potter daringly rescuing him from the fire in the Room of Requirement or being forced to torture others while in the employ of Lord Voldemort, Draco could not feel completely at ease.
“Do you want to continue the walk, or go back for treacle tart?” Draco asks huskily, tentatively running his fingers through Harry’s chestnut curls.
There’s only one thing they haven’t done together yet, though both have professed their love multiple times. One Friday before they’re about to go to bed, Harry leans over to whisper in Draco’s ear, “Are you ready?”
The parchment slipped out of his hand, and as it fell to the floor, Draco could make out letterhead from the Magical Congress of the United States of America, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Auror Division.
“Brah, his foot slid right under your mitt,” chimed in the man who threw the ball to the batter from the dirt mound, raising his
“A bit,” Harry said. Ron left it at that and they took a spin around the block, opting to get in a bit of a walk before going back. Surprisingly, Harry relaxed while they took in the ambiance of eccentric performers, the pungent spices coming from the market on the next street over, and a horde of excitable tourists who stood out from the locals with their shorts and their cameras like thestrals in a herd of horses. California beach cities weren’t for the faint of heart, in Harry’s view.
Afterwards, Nate gathered up his team with a proud face and a tear in his eye, and proclaimed, “I think we’re even stronger than we were last year. Not counting chickens or anything, but we might have a chance at first place…” he seemed overcome with emotion, heavily reminding Harry of Oliver Wood.
“No exit wound. Dolohov would have a fun time with this one, you know, if he wasn’t pushing up daisies,” Ron said happily. He yanked the pillow off of Dolohov and checked for a pulse. “Nothing. You want to take care of Rowle, mate?”
“It’s much better to be alone than to be in an unhappy relationship,” Draco said quietly. “I should know. I watched my parents suffer that fate for years.”
After he finished pointing out Sirius, Potter pulled him on his side and kissed him deeply, softly caressing Draco’s face. Draco let himself kiss back, because as unsure as he was about Potter’s motivations, he was convinced that they were heartfelt.
“Good question,” Harry said encouragingly. “Whoever’s playing center automatically has priority. If she calls you off, back off, but if she shouts your name, catch the ball.”
He made it into the kitchen and scarfed down half a bowl of soup before he noticed the owl waiting patiently on the counter for him. Curious, Harry approached it. Surely it wasn’t some kind of assassination attempt, considering that the owl was unharmed after passing through his wards? Only the owls of his closest friends knew how to do so safely.
For good measure, Draco shoved Potter back before looking up and catching all ten of their players watching the exchange from the dugout, where they were currently on water break.
Nate looked up towards the sky, as if praying for some sentient being to suddenly eliminate the problem that was Zee’s attitude. A change came over his face as the easy-going, all-around good guy disappeared so that Nate was unrecognizable, his face twisting in anger as he seemed to grow inches taller and infinitely scarier.
“Ready for NEWTs?” Ginny asked suddenly. They’d been eating in near silence, and Harry’d appreciated the chance to think.
Harry had to force himself not to jump down Malfoy’s throat. “What did I say before that made you the most upset?”
They made it to the lab right on time, and Draco temporarily forgot his tiredness as he and Hermione were forced to put forth their full concentration to brew the difficult Potion being asked of them. Draco liked brewing, and he liked a challenge, so he was no longer grumpy by the end of the class. He went home anyway, though, because he still needed some rest before tackling the rest of the day’s demands.
“Look, I’m tired, hungry, and not in the mood to be putting up with a stupid prat,” snapped Harry. “Either give me some advice I can actually use or bugger off.”
Draco sighed. Little unnecessary details were not getting his potion done faster. “It’s no problem, I assure you.”
Neither can fall back to sleep, so they rise from the bed and step out onto Harry’s balcony, hand in hand watching the red sun rise.
Draco’s body was stiff and straight, though he didn’t seem to be suffering from any anxiety now. Instead, he was in full Slytherin mode, as cold and calculating as Harry had ever remembered him being back at Hogwarts. “I accept your apologies as well, Weasley, though I’ll have you know that I will never like you. For Harry’s and Hermione’s sakes, I will be civil to you, but that’s as far as my tolerance goes.”
, so he said nothing at all. Closing his eyes, he shook his head, hoping that would clear the vision. After a quick count to three, he opened them, and, just like magic, there was no Potter. But that didn't prevent Draco from wondering if Harry had received his letter yet, and if so, was he okay?
“Glad you approve,” Draco responds stiffly. “I had no idea what you were expecting, so I planned for what I thought most appropriate –”
Draco’s lips met his in a sudden burst of passion, and Harry could feel the way Draco’s love burned behind the kiss, stronger and longer-lasting than the lust. He only hoped Draco could feel his love in return, and did all he could to convey it as their tongues caressed as intimately as their entwined hands.
“Surely I don't have to explain the logistics, do I?” sniped Draco, trying to cover up his own nervousness.
Curious, Harry tried to make eye contact with Nate, but he sped away like Cale had lit a fire underneath his ass. After he’d gotten his bag together, Nate looked back and called “Don’t forget your uniforms!” and continued rocketing out of there.
“You’re on, Malfoy.” Potter nestled back into the crook of Draco’s neck, much to his content, “If you take me to three places in England and show me what I’ve missed, then we can have a vacation and see other parts of the world.”
“Of course,” Draco said with fake enthusiasm. “Do you want to lead it with me?” Nearly all of his social interactions at camp had to be carefully modulated; he could only be honest with Pansy and sometimes Blaise, who were also counselors at Camp Cedarwood. Bad luck had placed them in different groups this week.
“Definitely not,” Harry said firmly. “I think he still struggles with them; has to do with something Hermione calls ‘internalized oppression,’ but no, I think he’s trying to be more open-minded. Honestly, we wouldn’t be together if he was still a hateful git.” Draco unexpectedly snorted, and Harry had the odd feeling he was trying not to laugh.
Draco thoroughly enjoyed reducing Harry to an incoherent mess to the point of where he was begging Draco to go faster and harder. He could only oblige his lover, nipping wildly at Harry’s neck and squeezing his cock in synch to try to send him over the edge. After only a couple minutes, it worked, and Harry clenched madly around his cock as he came in spurts across his and Draco’s stomachs. Overcome by the sight of Harry finally losing control and the immense pressure on this cock, Draco followed suit. His vision blurred even as he buried himself in Harry, leaning down to nuzzle into his lover’s neck as he thrust deep.
Thankfully Mother’s training paid off and he came out of the fireplace looking as unruffled as if he’d stayed on the couch. No one was there to see his landing, graceful as it was. Potter and Weasley’s living room was dark, and he couldn’t tell if anyone was in the house at all. Draco wasn’t about to go wandering around; there was likely clutter underfoot, as neither Potter nor Weasley was very tidy.
“Harry is our family,” said Mrs. Weasley firmly. “And anyone that’s important to him is important to us. I shouldn't have disregarded Draco solely because of his past mistakes.” She turned back to Draco. "I’m sorry about my son’s poor manners. Do eat up, dear.”
“Have you written back to Harry?” She phrased the question casually, but the sound of his name still resonated deep within Draco. He hoped that she would say something else, but there was silence from both of them.
It was excitedly echoed back, and even made the group walk a little faster. Maggie shot him a proud smile, and Draco at least felt happy that
José glanced at the ground as if wishing it would offer him an escape. “We’ve never done things on this team that way,” he muttered. “For reals, bro, Harry only joined the team a few months ago. He wasn’t familiar with baseball either.”
They worked together to scrub the floor again—Hermione made sure to monitor the amount of Lysol that went into the bucket; she had no interest in drying out her hands with chemical cleaning supplies—and Draco consented to leaving the walls and the cabinets alone so long as they scoured the countertops. After another grueling hour of labor, the house was sparkling; the cleaning supplies neatly returned to their homes under the kitchen sink. To Hermione, the house had been sparkling yesterday, but in this situation, it was Draco’s opinion that carried the most weight. After all, he’d be the one to pitch a Mr. Clean sponge at the wall and loudly declare everything needed done over again. And, finally, he seemed to be content. Not enthusiastic, per se, but content.
Harry appreciated that this was the first time Malfoy was ever willingly vulnerable around him. He’d witnessed Malfoy crying once before, and that had not ended well for either of them. But this time, he wanted to put Malfoy at ease, and that made all the difference.
Malfoy audibly groaned, causing Harry to crane his neck in order to get a better look at his charge. He ran his hands backward through his soft blonde hair, mussing it, and Harry had the strange urge to smooth his locks back into place.
was much more familiar to Harry. Malfoy decorated in various shades of green and silver to represent a small piece of home, he supposed. There were also aristocratic accents such as small porcelain figurines and glassy lamps scattered all over the bedroom in addition to a very comfortable looking silver futon and matching armchair. Malfoy’s bed was off to the side, underneath the window, and Harry tried to distract himself with the view to avoid thinking about rolling around with his former arch-enemy on his very own bed.
Draco restrained from rolling his eyes as Potter started stuffing his face. “I will be taking you out for a civilized supper tonight, Potter.” He laid a hand on Potter’s shoulders and Disapparated them to Diagon Alley. They spotted the Weasel and Granger right away, hastily making their way over to them.
Instead, the ball whooshed over the rectangle-triangle and was caught by the woman wearing a lot of gear in a giant leathery hand.
Harry took another swig of coffee before responding, somehow feeling more tired than he had before. “Hey, Luna. Not to be rude, but I’m going to be late meeting Draco-–”
, Potter. I know how hard that must be for you to understand, as you can’t even properly hold a quill.”
“Blimey, Potter,” Weasley continued. “Mum was right to try and talk some sense into you. All of this shirt-lifting has obviously ruined your sense of—”
style, he’d made him consent to wearing a special band that, when activated, would call Harry directly back to Dawlish. Harry had crossed his arms and glared when he was first notified of the requirement. Dawlish was unwilling to compromise, though, and only the promise of a house potentially filled with dark artifacts was enough to get Harry back on track. It had been promised that Dawlish would only activate the band in the direst of situations.
“So how are you then?” proffers Ron, heaving his feet up onto the couch and sliding them in next to Harry’s torso.
Thinking that would be the end of her, Draco slammed back down onto his mattress and pushed his palms against his eyes. His head would not stop pounding. Sure, it may have been a while since he last had some food, but there was no reason for a damn ache that wouldn’t go away. Actually, Draco couldn’t remember what he’d eaten or the last time he’d eaten.
“Tipsy was always the best cook in the house,” Draco said mildly, perching on the arm of Potter’s chair. “She always made me my favorite dinner whenever Father was, er, working late.”
“If we can get this article published, we can get into any school we want,” said Hermione eagerly. “What’s Harry planning to do, then?”
As he left the clearing, Draco’s heart hurt at the thought of Potter waking up all alone to his absence. It was enough to make him turn around and approach the bed again. He wasn’t about to leave a note or anything else equally incriminating, but something inside of him wanted to leave a gift for Potter to remember him by after he was gone.
“There’s just nothing available whatsoever,” groaned Chris as they drove down yet another side street.
Harry watched as Cale and Chris exchanged an amused look and internally sighed. Thank Merlin there was already some alcohol in their systems. He felt grateful, too, for Steve’s rum and coke; since he’d gotten in a nice wank, it wasn’t even making him horny.
Half of him expected the light to never come closer, as if he was a hallucinating about a lemonade stand in the middle of the desert. But as his imagined body confidently strode down the chamber, walking towards the blinding light as if it was the North Star, Draco saw it becoming larger and larger until he was eventually consumed by it.
Not knowing what to say, Draco tried to establish some rapport. He made his voice less crisp, losing his usual enunciation and slurring his words, “Last night was so fucked up, you wouldn’t believe how some of those college girls party.”
Harry just shook his head as Draco settled himself in with the Weasel around their deluxe chess board and started setting up the black pieces, reveling in how his friend’s eyes were glinting with challenge. They played long into the night, stopping only after Granger came over and insisted on having a word with Draco about the effect a particular potion might have on healing certain skin conditions of her patients. He was rather delighted to give his opinion and rambled on enthusiastically, not noticing Harry staring at him fondly from the sofa.
Malfoy assumed a face of perfect innocence. “Really, Potter? Just because I happened to be a few minutes late this morning?”
Draco walked open to the already open window and pushed it open further, enjoying the sound of birds chirping outside. He undressed, retrieved his towel, and started towards the luxurious shower he’d surely been missing for the better part of a week. Before he could quite make it out of his room, however, Ceeley the house elf was opening his door.
Harry did both, kissing Draco with more passion than he’d even had earlier that night. With the hand not wrapped around Draco, he stroked Draco’s cock, rubbing the glistening bead of pre-come into his head in the way he knew Draco liked.
At midnight, he finally climbed into bed and turned out the light. It had been a long day, and they were due for another equally long one tomorrow. But it felt wrong to go to sleep without Draco. He tossed and turned for the better part of an hour, having convinced himself that ghosts or Inferi haunted their apartment. Harry’d grown so accustomed to Draco’s presence, especially in bed, that he couldn’t sleep without him. There was definitely a reason why he’d had next to no nightmares since he and Draco moved in together.
A shiver went up Harry’s spine as Draco mouthed at him, darting out a wet, pink tongue to lap up the slight bead of pre-come already forming at the tip. He groaned as Draco pulled away, wetting his lips in an attempt to draw Harry’s attention. It worked.
For a minute, Draco was afraid she’d explode at him, but then Hermione let out a big breath and gave him a grimace of agreement. “I see what you mean,” she said. “We’re an unlikely match, to be sure. And he has been a rather bigoted
“I’m just going to keep doing that,” Harry said. “Our entire relationship is going to be built on me proving you wrong.”
“Like what you see, Potter?” Draco queried, trying not to grip Potter’s hand more tightly in anticipation.
“Sod off, Pugslea,” Draco snapped. Pansy had been dubbed “Pug” the first day of training, and Draco liked to take the mickey out of her even more by turning it into a mild insult (which she hated).
Malfoy reaches over, but his sleeve accidentally snags the cheese grater, causing his hand to bump the vinaigrette and knock it over. Before he can quite register what he’s doing, the salad dressing is zooming back into the jar, his magic neatly eviscerating any spills or stains. He’s broken his pledge not to use magic, and wandlessly at that.
Draco had worried about the inevitable trial ever since he’d first realized the certainty of Voldemort’s downfall. Fortunately, he knew the Golden Boy would keep his word. Harry Potter was nothing if not noble and honest. With Harry’s testimony, he and his mother were sentenced to community service and a fine and the Malfoy vaults retained most of their fortune. His father wasn’t so lucky. Lucius received a fifteen year sentence in Azkaban, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to feel pity. His actions enabled the Dark Lord to return to full force in the first place, and he’d pressured Draco into taking the Dark Mark. For that, Draco would never forgive him.
There was a long, awkward silence where no one except Nate met Zee’s eyes. Draco was suddenly wracked with guilt; he’d never meant for the git to actually leave the team. When Potter slipped his hand around Draco’s elbow, he was grateful for the contact as it was strangely comforting.
They ran out of milk, and so Draco’s forced to go buy some more. His tea, which already only provides the smallest modicum of comfort, is simply unbearable without it.
“Wait!” Harry ran to the window and shut it before the bird could leave. “Please--you’ll take something back to him for me, right?”
He regretfully stops eyeballing the tart and finds Malfoy’s silverware drawer on the first try. “Right. Why exactly do we need silverware for pizza?”
“Of course,” she retorted, “It’s called sticking me with it.” She fixed him with a look saturated with self-pity, but Draco refused to give in. Finally, she sighed and snuck her arm around his. “Draco, love, you do know that we have to earn ‘Acceptable’s on our performance reviews this summer, right?”
Silently grateful, Draco watched as Potter took up a spot by the dugout. “I’m going to stand here just in case you miss me, Malfoy,” he said, suddenly bright again. Draco took the hint and walked out in the middle of the field, close to where José had pitched the ball from earlier that day.
Malfoy cast him a quick glance, no doubt wondering if Harry was judging him for pursuing a hobby so suited to “Muggle grannies.” Harry was pleased that his opinion was being considered even though he didn’t mind the quick lesson. He gave a quick shoulder shrug as if to say ‘I don’t see why not.’
to consider the possibility. What had he been drinking last night? Oh yeah, the rum. Draco vowed to have a nice bonfire that night as he burned every last bottle.
“Cheers,” Hermione said again, proffering her raised bottle. This time Draco clinked it, and they drank deeply.
Stung, as he always was when someone called him a Death Eater, Draco could only give them his most superior, condescending Malfoy glare as they strode away. It was going to be a long day.
“Yeah, yeah,” he muttered. Shouldering the bat in a way that would probably make Nate have an aneurysm should he ever see, Draco tossed the uncomfortably large softball in the air and hit it with a sharp
Harry bristled, and then let it go. Things between he and Malfoy were never going to be easy. “You write. Okay, perfect. Nate said I was supposed to help you in fundraising, though I imagine you and your
?” Malfoy still wore his leather riding crops, and though Harry was partial to them, Ron was unlikely to agree.
“Tea, ‘Mione?” Ron asked, passing two shots of espresso over to Harry, who started assembling their drinks.
Just as Harry thought he was about to come, Draco pulled off, sliding back up Harry’s body and giving him an openmouthed kiss. It was incredibly hot, tasting himself in Draco’s mouth, and Harry was sorely disappointed when Draco gave him one final peck and asked him if he was ready.
Without another word Potter saw himself out. Draco stood up as soon as the door closed, grabbing his robe from the hook on the wall. Now he felt extra pressure to change Potter's memories of the Manor; it would be unfortunate, to say the least, if Potter always dreaded coming over to visit him.
He sprang out of bed the next morning at eight, wanting to use the next hour wisely in preparation for his guest. Potter didn’t know it, but destination number two was Malfoy Manor itself. Draco knew he could convince Potter to give his home a second chance after seeing what Draco had in store for him later that morning. After brushing his teeth and sinking into the bathtub, Draco told himself that he would only take fifteen minutes for a relaxing soak.
“Harry’s judgment is questionable at the best of times,” the Weasel said. “But he always comes to his senses. And when he does, probably after Malfoy stabs him in the back somehow, the right lot of us will look foolish for having trusted Malfoy.”
“Hermione, no offense, but I have exactly four hours to submit these applications before I have to wait until next year!”
“Honestly,” said Draco, slightly muffled as he carefully inserted his favorite quill into the very bottom pocket of his bag, “I could just murder my past self for not befriending Granger. At the risk of sounding really cheesy, she's actually a genius.”
Yarn over, push underneath the V. Breath in. Yarn over, pull through the V. Draw up the loop, yarn over. Breathe out. Pull through the first loop, yarn over, pull through all three loops. Breathe in. Unwind more yarn, untwist the excess curled around the chair leg. Breathe out.
She smiled. “Luckily, having a Dual Mastery scored me some points with the department. They pulled some strings and found me a mentor who specializes in Potions and Care of Magical Creatures. I won’t be working with a top-tier Master Potioneer, obviously, but this is tailored to my own specializations and what I actually want to do.”
“We’re doing it,” Draco decided, snatching the contract--which he’d already read, word for word--out of the stack, signing it with a loopy flourish. He shoved it over towards Harry, who sighed heavily before scratching his own name onto the parchment.
Narcissa looked, though. In a rare gesture of intimacy, she ran her fingers over Draco’s Mark before meeting his eyes. “I know that your path is difficult, son. But I also know that choosing the easy way out only leads to death and destruction. Look at my life, Draco.”
job. He needed education, and after considering how much time he spent on the NEWTs, it seemed unfair to simply whip up the proper documentation. Draco wasn’t sure he could fake 4 years of muggle higher education. After further thought, he decided that with his fantastic NEWT scores, it was appropriate for him to enter University with 2 years of coursework done. He’d manifest the paperwork from, what was it she said, a
Halfway through spring break, Draco decided that it was time for a reward. He’d been admiring muggle body piercings since his arrival in August, and finally mustered up the courage to have one done. Now an expert at surfing the net, Draco went on Yelp and looked up the best piercing places in San Diego. He wanted the one at the very top of the list: Enigma Professional Piercing Studio. There were hundreds of reviews, but Draco read them all because it simply wouldn’t do to let an untrustworthy person near his body with a needle. For good measure, he went and read reviews of the other highly rated piercing studios.
Before Draco could grab the lube again, Harry snatched it, slathering a generous amount on Draco’s cock. He mouthed at the tip just to get Draco a little bit harder, giving him a sultry smile as he did so.
She sighed and left the kitchen, heading down to their shared bedroom to tidy up before Draco finished the floor. His anxiety was such that it wouldn’t let him rest unless everything in the house
As the song ended, Harry felt his breathing return to normal, a new sense of calm rushing over him. They exited the floor; Cale and Chris ushering them up onstage for their turn at karaoke.
“Of course,” Draco said. He went to his and Hermione’s shared room and retrieved his own coat, a British-style double breasted button down in wool, and then the coat Harry always borrowed (stole) from him, brown, rugged, and woodsy. Harry’d missed it, and he said as much when Draco handed it over.
“Harry!” shouted Nate happily. “Meet Draco Malfoy. You wanted some extra practice with your teaching, so you’re going to be helping him learn the game.”
They started walking towards the exit of the apartment building, Jake stumbling down the last few stairs and flailing wildly. Draco ran his hand through his hair: the ground was spinning. “I can’t believe I let you talk me into this. You and my friggin’ roommate, you’re both morons. I have a midterm tomorrow. A
“Cause you really are going to be fantastic at this,” Potter whispered. “I wasn’t nearly as good as you after my first week of hardcore practice. You were made for this sport, Malfoy.”
, if you must know, because I thought I was already too far gone. In addition, my father wouldn’t have accepted it. He would have disowned me.”
Draco paid a visit to the Manor. He and Mother somberly drank tea together in the green room, gazing out at the melancholy grasses which were powerless against the strong January gusts of wind. Draco let his vision fade, the blades blurring together in his mind, picturing that sweet day in the summer where he brought Harry back to the Manor to show him the butterfly garden.
Both journals were published quarterly, so they each had four issues to browse from the current year. Draco didn’t particularly like the idea of reading back any further, especially considering that each issue was over 200 pages.
“Malfoy,” he said seriously. “I owe you – and your mother – a life-debt from the War, so if there’s anything I can do to help out, just let me know.”
Ron snorted, disgusted. “Smoking weed on a job? It’s like they aren’t even taking it seriously,” he said. “Should we even bother? They’re probably too high to fight.”
"Well, keep on like that, and I'll have no trouble doing it again," Draco said scathingly, getting his bearings back.
Hermione and Ron are working their way through their own drinks. Harry can see how Hermione’s hand trembles as she downs her Cosmo and how Ron’s lips are pulled into a grimace across his face. He hates causing his friends such strife, but knows what happened isn’t his fault.
“Oh?” said Draco, tastefully raising an eyebrow like the posh boy he’d once been. There was sweat running down his back, and his hair was plastered to his face, but the Slytherin Ice Prince would always be in his back pocket. He had to rely on it now, especially as his traitorous heart longed to hear Potter confess his love for Draco.
Harry detached himself from Ron in silent fury. He dusted himself off before making for the bathroom and slamming the door behind him. Without hesitation, he stepped into the shower and turned on the water full-blast. It calmed him, cooled him, and after a good five minutes of freezing under the spray, he’d recovered enough of his sensibilities to wash properly. He wore only his towel out to their shared room, where Ron gave him nasty looks as he changed. Harry side-checked him on the way out the door.
“To each their own,” Ron said. “See you at home later. Or not.” He smiled, and the glint in his eyes reappeared. “Have a good one, Harry.”
“You’re absolutely right on the first count, and, honestly, I’m not sure about the second one,” Harry said, ruffling his hair into a right state. “But that’s not happening anyway.” There were a few moments of silence. Then Harry said, “I’m just not ready to give them up.”
“Shut up!” Harry angrily whispered. If only there was a window around to open… Lightheadedness passed over him, and his efforts to stay conscious were rendered useless as he fell to the ground, treacle tart crumbs scattered around him.
He threw jeans, t-shirts, and various pairs of boxers and socks into one of Hermione’s spare magically enlarged bags, making sure to at least grab a few sweatshirts and jackets. It didn’t seem right to only bring clothes, so Harry set about making sure he had some essential Healing potions as well as some snacks for later. It was almost, he thought with a grimace, as though he was simply going to be gone a few nights for a sleepover party.
It takes second to realize his eyes are closed, probably from the brilliance of the treacle tart, but Harry opens his eyes and almost drops his fork to the floor. Draco’s standing in the entrance to the kitchen, dressed only in a soft white towel, hair tousled and still wet from the shower.
“Not a wink,” Draco reluctantly admits, shoving another marshmallow into his mouth. There is literally no such thing as too much sugar.
For a fraction of a second, Harry feared for his life, well-aware Draco’s weight was still pinning him to the ground. “Um,” he gasped, trying to formulate a coherent sentence, “Er –”
"Much obliged," returned Draco, drying himself off behind the closed shower door. "I can offer both chocolate biscuits and cinnamon ones for your acquiescence, though we'll have to work on your manners. Inviting yourself to afternoon tea? Quite the faux pas."
It was enough to drive Draco wild. He refrained from begging for more, barely, but couldn’t help from driving his bottom down so that Potter’s tongue would slide further in. So much for Potter not being a tease. After some more time exploring the outer parts of Draco’s hole, Potter finally broached him, slipping his tongue in along with his finger. Draco nearly shouted from the double stimulation of Potter brushing his prostate with his finger and stimulating the sensitive outer rim.
Draco kissed him, tears streaming down both of their faces. There was no other response, no expression of words that could properly describe the incredible love and gratitude he felt for this man. After all these years, Harry was still reminded of what Draco had almost done, had kept it with him as they went through their lives together. Draco wondered how many fights he’d intentionally conceded in an attempt to keep him feeling secure.
“I can’t say that I do,” Draco answered, a bit dazed at the thought. “And I hope that I never find out.”
Draco chose a soft gray cashmere sweater for Potter, to match the red one he’d daringly chosen for himself earlier that morning, and a pair of black fitted trousers that had always been just a little bit short on him. They seemed to wear the same shoe size, so Draco reluctantly pulled out one of his favorite pairs of black boots to let Harry borrow. He’d give him hell, though, if Potter scuffed them up or stomped through mud puddles in them. After leaving everything in the room adjoined to the bathroom Potter was currently occupying, Draco made his way back down to the living room.
He nodded to the Weasley before exiting the shop, wondering why nothing in his life could possibly be easy.
The next day, Harry wakes up hungover with a headache. He wrestles himself into the bathroom for a Pepper Up Potion, and after downing it, coaxes his body into the hot shower. It feels like heaven on his sore muscles, and Harry entertains the notion of asking Kreacher for a backrub. All former dislike aside, he still has the feeling it wouldn’t go over so well.
“Whatever you say, I still think your experience was worse,” says Harry firmly. “I don’t want Asten to control my life. Voldemort did that for long enough.”
He sat in one of the remaining chairs without complaint, tried his cake, and complimented Mrs. Weasley. But he could only look between Draco and Mrs. Weasley with varying expressions of shock, love, and relief. They sat quietly together, soaking in the moment.
Draco smiled. He gently ghosted his fingers over Potter’s back, listening as the other man’s breathing slowed. “You’re in for the ride of your life, Potter.”
After his letter was gone, Harry couldn’t think of any other reasons to delay leaving. He closed his eyes, and the Statue of Liberty flashed through his mind. America was a good a place as any to start off. Where was that damn thing; New Yuck or something? Harry sincerely doubted that even muggles could give something a name with “Yuck” in the title. Instead, he decided to trust his magic and end up right in front of the damn thing. If he Splinched himself, he thought ironically, well, at least he’d bloody well feel something.
Without hesitation, Harry softly massaged his head, trying to take some of the pain away. Naturally, Madam Pomfrey picked that exact time to come back into the room. “Mr. Potter!” she said disapprovingly. “Mr. Malfoy needs to rest and wait for the potions to work. I will permit you to sit here with him, but you must
“It’s already half-six,” Hermione said, finally interrupting his endless train of thought. “You have five minutes and then you get to proofread it yourself.”
There was a silent moment when Harry and George seemed to have a silent conversation through eye contact. If Draco didn’t know about Harry’s abysmal Legilimency skills, he’d have suspected that they were communicating by mind. After some time, George nodded and clapped Harry on the shoulder again, as if he’d understood something meaningful.
memories. He’d created several versions of a Potion designed to remove false memories, but there was still something off. There was something he hadn’t accounted for, and didn’t quite know how to remedy. Draco felt as though a breakthrough was near, though he didn’t make any progress on it that night, distracted as he was by the thoughts he was unwilling to think.
As Potter went to walk down the path decorated by fairy-lights, Draco quickly reached out and snagged his arm. “Potter,” he said in his most reasonable tone of voice. “Are you sure you’re up for this? We can postpone for another day, if you’d like.”
of yours, and Cissy partly to blame too…” She seemed to check herself and said, “But you have a choice now. And to answer your earlier question, yeah, I think you should go.”
As it was, they weren’t doing so well. It was a trek to get there, and, even with stopping every five minutes for a water break, the campers were complaining about being hot and tired. Sweat poured down Draco’s back and neck, soaking his shirt. He’d taken a morning shower, but he’d never have known because of the way his skin already stuck together at the creases. Everything was sticky. Malfoys didn’t sweat, and they
“We have to know for sure that’s Potter before we can torture the boy,” Narcissa said, arranging herself on one of the burgundy armchairs tastefully situated just-so. They seemed to be in a drawing room of some sort; the ceilings were high, arched with a crisp particularity that made the space seem cold and unforgiving. Paintings of grizzled ancestors were the only decorations adorning the walls. For all the surrounding splendor, it seemed to be a very impersonal room indeed.
Her words left him with an overlaying sense of guilt and regret. Harry made up his mind to talk to his friends before trying to win Draco back. After all, those visualizations he’d had earlier where they gave him advice could become reality if he played his cards right. Out of the two, Hermione was definitely the better person to approach first. Even despite her distaste for Draco, she had the ability to be mature and decent about difficult situations.
“Let’s go,” Ron said. “You know that Schrader’s going to pull some shit where he tries to ‘check in’ one last time after hours. Unless we leave in the next two minutes, we’re gonna have to use the cloak.”
“For reals,” said Ange, shaking her head. The rest the team was bent over in half, gasping in air, though some had recovered enough to gulp down some water.
“It’s done,” said Draco, leaning back against the kitchen counter. “Don’t wish for your life to be different. We may have never become friends if you’d stayed with him then. You shouldn’t romanticize the situation, either. You weren’t happy, and something had to change.”
Harry snapped back as if he’d been burned. “What time is it!” he gasped, searching frantically for his want to cast a Tempus Charm. Malfoy beat him to it, simply looking at his wristwatch.
Taking cues from Harry, Draco showered and dressed himself in respectful black dress clothing. He allowed Harry to coax him into eating breakfast before they left, content to be Side-Alonged to wherever the gravesite surely was.
“It does,” Hermione said softly. “I’ve spent some of the best years of my life living with you, Draco. France really was the best decision we could have made for ourselves after graduation. I’ve never regretted a second of our lives here.”
There’s an explosion of activity of the field and Draco honestly can’t tell who reacted first. He’s most aware of Potter’s feet hitting the dirt as he races out of center field and up to Zee, getting right in his face.
“I completely agreed with you on the quality of the questions,” Draco said, handing the list to Harry. He quickly read through them, noting how neat and precise Draco’s cursive was, and was interested to note that none of their questions overlapped.
“That doesn’t matter,” Draco said. He poured milk into the tea and sat at the table, facing Hermione. “We’re still in the same position we were before. He made a mess and I have to deal with it.”
“Also,” continued Otarres, “I’m the undergraduate adviser. I was on the committee that admitted you to the University, and I read all of your application essays. I know you’re a skilled writer–you really benefitted from community college.”
Harry could definitely feel his face turning red. “Inside me,” he said with not a little bit of hesitation.
“Damnit, Potter, harder,” Draco begs, slapping Potter’s ass. To his complete and utter surprise, Potter looks undone for the first time, groaning loudly as he furiously shoves back inside Draco. His cock wracks over Draco’s spot, and he matches Potter’s groan as his pleasure intensifies and runs through his lower extremities.
He obliged, self-consciously crossing his arms over his stomach, and Karl showed him the toothpick and hollow tube. “Move your head a little to the left, and tilt your chin back a bit more?” Draco did, feeling a small prick in his nose.
Draco’s feelings for Narcissa were a lot clearer: he had always loved her, and would continue to do so. She fought long and hard with her sister Andromeda to apologize for the choices she made in the past, and finally ‘Dromeda accepted, resulting in a shaky reconciliation. Narcissa had vacated the Manor right after the war ended, having decided to accept ‘Dromeda’s offer for her to move in and help raise little Teddy Lupin.
“I’m bouncing,” I whisper to Pansy and Blaise. “If I have to hear another fucking camp song today, I’m going to go bloody mental.”
After a moment, her eyes returned to normal and the horrible tightness Harry was feeling in his chest passed. “Mr. Potter,” she asked, perhaps a tad less testily than usual, “Do you require my assistance?”
Potter sighed, sitting down to try one out. He swirled the back of the chair, which more of resembled a semi-circle instead of a hardback traditional desk, off to the side and hoisted his knees up. “You know, you made them too comfortable. I swear, McGonagall’s going to have your head for making all of her students fall asleep during lecture.”
Malfoy studied Harry for a moment then leaned in and kissed him. Harry was conscious of the fact that he’d just rolled out of bed, and wasn’t eager to deepen the kiss. Malfoy demanded, “Are we going back to butterfly kisses now?”
“WILKINS!” boomed an angry voice. Draco couldn’t make out who it was, but he instantly eliminated Potter. “I’ll have you chucked out of here for good this time. Wait until McGonagall hears that you’ve been torturing students who have been cleared of all charges!”
Nels threw Harry a devious look before breaking out into a chorus of “Ooooh, that Zee is hot! Girl, wouldn’t you just fuck him silly?”
As Malfoy thought it over, Harry watched with an increasing feeling of dread. He was almost sure that Malfoy would decline out of desire to save face.
“Impressive!” Slughorn shouted from across the room. “You really work as a remarkable team, Mr. Malfoy and Ms. Granger!”
Second attempt more fruitful, Harry paid closer attention as Cecelia went on to demonstrate the starting chain, grasping the yarn with the hook and pulling it through the loop already on the shaft. Malfoy remembered the motion and whipped up a quick set of fifteen chain stitches while Harry tried to keep his hands from shaking, unable to find a comfortable way to hold both hook and yarn.
was not the place for him. If Draco didn’t at least have some intelligent, sentient beings to interact with, he might just lose his mind completely. Not to mention the disgusting smell coming from the lake and the downtrodden appearance of what seemed to be the main hub of the city.
There was a rustle of movement, and suddenly Potter was next to him on the ground, legs crisscrossed as he comfortably invaded Draco’s space.
He was sure that it was only the gravity of the situation kept Hermione from commenting about his love of filing and copies. He couldn’t watch as she read them; instead, Draco concentrated on trying to get his hand to stop shaking long enough to pick up his teacup.
“If you wake up really early tomorrow,” Harry whispered, “You can come shower with me and make sure I get clean.”
“I got it, I got it!” shouted Iz, the girl Harry was currently scouting as his center fielder. Unfortunately, Ange, another of Harry’s outfielders, wasn’t properly listening and also moved back to catch the ball. With a sickening
Mr. Granger returned with Mrs. Granger in tow. “We would love to sample your wares,” Mrs. Granger said. “I do enjoy a good red.”
Draco was still in the shower. After leaving Harry and the Gryffindorks, Draco Apparated straight back to the Manor. Damn the community service, at least for today. He was done with Hogwarts for good, though. Tomorrow would be the perfect opportunity to join Mother at the London Garden, and as for school, maybe the Ministry would let him finish out his education at Durmstrang or at Ilvermorny. Mother was still connected with the Senior Undersecretary’s wife; perhaps she would be able to pull some strings…
There wasn’t time to take a shower, but Draco made time; there was no way he was leaving the house looking this debauched. He made the executive decision after catching sight of himself in the mirror. It was horrifying to think of what Tipsy heard him saying while dreaming.
Draco sighed. He didn’t need an omnipresent being to fuck up his life; he could do that fine himself, thank you very much. There wasn’t anything for it. He pulled off the plain black T shirt that had somehow found its way onto his body and reconciled himself to the jumper.
Malfoy simply took his hook out of the yarn and gave a light tug on the yarn, causing all of his stitches to unravel. Harry followed suit before winding his long yarn tail back around the skein. They slipped them back into the basket, setting the hooks on the side, and Harry looked back around the shop as if he was remembering again how quaint it was.
“Out with it, Potter,” Draco said, trying not to sound impatient. “You can’t properly enjoy destination number three if there’s something on your mind.”
“Ah, yes,” ‘Dromeda smiled, “It’s coming back to me now. Cissy said you would probably mention it sooner or later. She knows how skeptical you are of everything.”
He shot into the bathroom and turned on the faucet, excited when clear, cool water poured out. Draco then tried to remove his bathrobe, but found that it wasn’t budging. What the absolute
Before he could even knock, the door swung open. Merram positively beamed at him. “Draco! Come on in.”
car, and they weren’t done driving it. The mess was lamentable. He quickly put Rowle out of his misery, placing the gun against his chest and pulling the trigger. Blood streamed out of the bullet hole, running down the man’s suit and coalescing all around him in the car seat. Harry watched the patterns it made, transfixed.
“Hello, Harry,” Luna said, a serene smile tugging up the corners of her mouth. “It's no surprise you didn't notice me until now, not with all the Wrackspurts circling around your head.”
He ran back over to the fence and tossed Draco the ball. It was low, so he opened the mitt and cupped it like Potter had shown him, delighted when the ball landed right in it. Unfortunately, it popped out a second later.
“Come on mate,” urged Cale. They had a spare room in their apartment, and Harry had moved in after the very first team practice.
“A little bit of both,” Cale sighed. “I kind of wanted to hint at it and see how he reacted. I think he’s straight.”
“No need to drive,” said Draco nonchalantly. “There’s a practice field right on campus.” He led the way down the road, away from the large stadium overlooked by his bedroom window, and up a set of stairs to the field. The dirt infield was regular sized, but the grassy outfield stretched out a long way, bordering the Music building and serving as a cut-through to the students coming from the main campus.
“Sure?” responded Draco, knowing that, whatever was coming next, it wasn’t going to be entirely pleasant for him.
Draco locked eyes with Harry, panting from the desire that was so clear upon his face. As they looked at each other, Harry saw his lust slowly fade away as Draco started to look fearful and worried. “What’s wrong?” he asked quietly. “Is this not what you wanted?”
“It’s just so perfect with tofu,” Harry sighs, grabbing for a second roll. “I love the little noodles too. It’s an amazing combination.”
There was no answer from Malfoy immediately, but Harry stood up and went to sit next to him on the settee, putting his right arm around Malfoy’s shoulders. "I wish you would have told me.”
He swallowed a tinge of guilt, and waved his wand to Summon an owl from the Ministry’s Courtesy Owl Service to deliver his letter to the Burrow. He’d deliberately left off from telling them where he was going to go, being unsure about that himself.
It was Harry’s turn to let Hermione talk. She took another minute before finishing her thought, grasping around in her pocket for a tissue to wipe her eyes. He put his hand on her back.
Had he really been dreaming about Potter? Draco had never had such an intense dream before, even when he was in Voldemort’s employ and nightmares were just his norm. In fact, Draco could almost still feel Potter’s touch on his body…
“Well, Weasley, circumstances change. You can suddenly find yourself on common ground with someone you once hated.”
“Can you pass me another sample?” said Mr. Granger. “We’re wine aficionados, so please keep them coming.”
, Draco finally remembered – came careening down the road straight over the patch of grass in-between the street and the lane and directly at him. Panicking, Draco dove off the strip towards the nearest tree, attempting to put it between himself and the driver.
They dug in, much to the distast of the barista behind the counter. She called out to them with a loud “Excuse me!”, which they both pretended to not hear. They were only saved by a customer coming up to the counter and expecting to be served.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes and loudly snorted, before concluding, “Like I said, you know nothing, Potter.”
“Well, for one, I won’t know when to show up and spy on him,” Ron says, as if it’s obvious. “Besides, I want to steal some of his teaching techniques. The little buggers are getting feisty on me again.”
He smiled as he made his way across the land, breathing deeply to savor the fresh air. When Draco reached the back door and went to pull open the handle, Harry chastised, “Don’t go getting mud all over the floor again! You know I can’t do a proper Cleaning Charm.”
After one particularly rousing debate at UCSD over the rights of the LGBTQ community, where Jake and Draco argued fervently in favor of single stall gender-neutral restrooms, they drove back to campus together.  Jake was singing loudly along with the his favorite CD–“And there's nothing wrong with me, this is how I'm supposed to be, in a land of make believe, that don't believe in me”–drumming on the steering wheel in time to the beat. Draco found it strangely endearing. He wasn’t familiar with the song, of course, but the strong punk rock beat was catchy, and the lyrics actually did something to fill the ever-present void of loneliness and regret in Draco’s chest.
Potter took a moment’s respite to lube up his fingers (Draco had no idea when Potter had had time to Conjure lube) and gently press into a finger his hole as he continued to work Draco’s cock with his tongue. Draco’s eyes rolled back into his head as he was overcome with pleasure; in some strange miracle, on his first try Potter managed to find his prostate. When he added another finger, Draco fell into that lovely region where the pain managed to enhance the pleasure.
Draco strode out of the bathroom and headed back into his bedroom only to find Potter staring at him like he just Transfigured into a moose. “Avert your eyes, Potter. I know I’m attractive and all, but you simply must control yourself.” To his complete and utter surprise, Potter flushed just the slightest bit. Well, that was interesting. Maybe Potter actually
He knew something was off when Draco only managed a half-hearted chuckle. They sat in silence for a moment, digesting the content of the article. “What do you think?” Harry asked finally, unable to bear it any longer. He stood up from off of the couch and walked into the kitchen, where Draco was using his elbows to lean on the kitchen counter, still staring at the issue. Wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist, Harry gently nuzzled into the back of Draco’s neck.
“OUT!” shouted Nate from behind the woman in the gear. Draco hadn’t even seen him come down from his bag. “Nice, Nels, that’s exactly the kind of tag I want to see.”
“Sorry, mate,” Ron had said apologetically over the Floo earlier that day. “But it’s already a stretch to say both me and ‘Mione have to stay home and take care of her.”
“If it really feels wrong to you,” says Harry resignedly, “You can work without pay. But if you remember, I asked you to teach while we were eating dinner before I even knew about your interview. It’s not charity, Draco. I know how good with magic you are. And how many NEWTS you got.”
“I did heal it,” hissed Draco once Slughorn continued on his merry way, unfortunately confirming her suspicions. He threw three cups of lacewings into their cauldron, one more than Slughorn’s instructions called for, and added in two drops of lavender essential oil on nothing but a whim.
Draco petted her wild hair, smoothing it back away from her face. “You’re not alone,” he said firmly. “You’ll always have me and Harry.”
McGonagall sighed. “Mr. Potter, it’s always been known to me that you consider Hogwarts your home. Under my term as Headmistress, I certainly do not want that to change. In fact,” she said, with a slight crinkling of her eyes, “I admit that I quite wish for you to feel safer here than you ever have before, seeing as You-Know-Who is no longer a threat.”
“Sure was,” Neville agreed, heaving his bag over his shoulder. “We can get a crack on it before Harry gets back if we go now.”
Before McGonagall finished speaking, several younger students saw fit to start speculating about professors and classes, their giggles echoing across the lake. Draco was never a fan of the Gryffindor Head of House, but he deeply (albeit grudgingly) respected her. He knew exactly what that lot would be in for come the start of term.
“You’re not busy tomorrow, right Harry?” asked Ron. “We’re heading over to Diagon Alley tomorrow; George’s revealing a new product and promised us free samples.”
Draco didn’t have time to respond before a enormous piece of mouthwatering chocolate cake deposited itself on a plate and soared across the room towards him. Mrs. Weasley handed him a fork, smiling once more. “I wonder at the state of those Hogwarts house elves,” she frowned. “You and Harry both are entirely too thin.”
“I expect premium tea for life in exchange for my love,” Hermione said weakly, pulling away to wipe her eyes as Draco continued preparing their drinks, filling tea strainers with the loose-leaf Queen Victoria.
Potter smiles deviously and kneels down before teasingly drawing out Draco’s cock and licking a firm stripe up the shaft. He laps at the frenulum, stroking Draco’s balls in time with his tongue’s movements. Trying not to cry out has become the focus of Draco’s experience. He whimpers, but Potter just gently laughs before swallowing him down whole. The wind wafts over Draco’s exposed cock, but every time the cold air hits, Potter’s hot tongue swirls and flicks over spots that make hot tears come to Draco’s eyes. As Potter combines sucking with a head twist that exerts pressure on Draco’s frenulum, he cries out, “No, Potter, stop – stop.” Potter looks up questioningly, and Draco blurts “I’m close.”
“Analysis is analysis,” answered Marram. “You’ll use the same skills. But rhetorical analysis has a different focus than literary analysis. I think you’d adjust well, based on the samples I saw.”
“Sorry, brahs,” shrugged Steve, stepping back and gesturing with his hand for them to come inside. It was neat and clean, if not a little mismatched. Harry supposed the décor had been selected by Steve. “They’ve been relentlessly targeting us all week.”
“Wake up out there!” Nate shouts, waving the bat around impatiently. “Second base, get into position and stop gabbing like schoolchildren!
“I hate to break it to you,” said Hermione, quivering with anger. “But Malfoy hasn’t changed at all, Harry, he’s just using you. A group of Hufflepuffs bullied him yesterday, so he’s relying on you for protection.”
Neville snorted. “I’m telling you, he doesn’t care. Harry’s only concerned about the people who matter to him, which includes you.”
Draco only allowed himself one vice a day, so he skipped dessert after paying the bill and skulked out to the park just across the corner from the restaurant, pulling a beat-up container of cigarettes out of his inner jacket pocket. He didn’t smoke often, but when he did, the day was sure to have been a doozy.
“Please tell me that we’re not going to be in a fancy restaurant every other night, Malfoy,” shuddered Potter. Draco could only imagine Potter’s horror if he made that nightmare a reality.
Nodding, Potter caught his eye and smiled. “You’ve done really well here, Malfoy. I’ve never been in a garden as beautiful as this one.”
There was nothing to do but get it over with. Grimacing, he purposefully ignored Macmillan’s instructions to break the clumps up, instead scooping up large bunches and hurling them off behind a nearby woodpile. Squirrels came flying out of the brush after the first shovelful landed, which made Draco smile. At least he wasn’t the only one miserable this morning.
When he finally exited the room, Draco breathed a sigh of relief. He closed his eyes and got his temper under control, and then reached out wandlessly to Summon all of the glass shards into a pile in the middle of the floor. He sat down on his bed and rubbed his hands over his face.
“You’re welcome, Potter,” Draco said, trying and failing to clear his mind. “It only makes sense that I would ask you to do something you’d enjoy; you’re the Golden Boy, after all.”
He was in the middle of forming his second of three potential action plans when Draco suddenly threw down the folder, and growled, “Fuck it, I can’t do this anymore.” Without further warning he turned around and crashed his lips onto Harry’s, pulling him into what could only be described as a battle fought with teeth and tongue. Harry clutched at Draco’s sinewy back, pulling him down on top of him in willing submission as they continued to kiss.
“Hey, look!” shouted one Ravenclaw boy with a particularly lowbrow accent. “Malfoy’s pissed himself!”
“Break it up!” Nate shouted furiously, unclenching Potter’s fingers from Zee. Potter made another desperate swoop for Zee, but Nate blocked his path and shouted for him to back off.
They simply stood in silence for a moment, each lost in thought. Finally, Draco said, “Potter, I hope your schedule is clear for today.”
Harry shook his head. “I can’t believe it,” he raged. “You said that Finnigan had his wand pointed at Draco and they just did nothing?”
“Now now,” interrupted Betty Lou, laying a hand on Zee’s shoulder. “We talked about this, hon. You’ll be coaching some of the softball girls with me, remember?”
“Ceeley is sorry, Master Draco,” said the elf, guiltily sticking out her right foot and crossing it over the left. “But there’s been changes, sir, you see. They’s from the Ministry!”
“Harry,” says Ron, laying a hand on his best friend’s shoulder. “Of course I want you to date. But really, I don’t think this is the best way to go about it. I know you but Seamus doesn’t, not as well as I do, and he’s going to push you past your limits.”
He turned to greet Pansy next, pleased despite himself when she flung herself off of the couch and into his arms. “Hello, darling,” she cooed. “You’re looking simply splendid, you know. Seems like Potter’s been good for you after all.”
was always studying when Draco came into her room), so maybe he had been acting a little more obsessively than normal. Draco decided to take the suggestion into consideration and continued reading.
“Dragon,” Draco decided, arranging his pale face into a sneer that conveyed his full intention of giving Macmillan hell should he comment on Draco’s choice.
“Not again,” groaned Harry. During the past two months it had become something of a tradition for Cale and Chris to drag him out drinking on Fridays after practice – they pre-gamed on Chris’s never-ending supply of Stoli vodka and ginger ale and then spent the night out at the bar. Unwittingly, Harry drank a little too much last week and was dragged into karaoke at Cale’s insistence.
Potter crossed his arms and glared at Draco, tapping his foot. “Get to the point, Malfoy. Or haven’t you seen exactly how much tower we still have to rebuild?”
Draco forced himself to act nonchalant. “As if you have any effect on me. Don’t make me laugh, Finnigan, unless it’s at your clown-like face.”
Shaking his head, Harry nudged Draco onto his back, kissing his nose as Draco made a noise of complaint. “How do you want to do this?”
“Of course I remember the War,” says Hermione, biting back. “But I honestly believe that a good grasp of a situation and background knowledge about the condition one suffers from is the foundation to solving the problem.”
“Poor baby,” Potter cooed, flipping back the covers to pull his wand out of his jeans’ pocket. He cleaned them both off before pulling on his shirt and throwing Draco’s at his face. Startled awake, Draco slipped into his button down as Potter sorted out the rest of the clothes. They yanked on pants with no problem, but Draco could have sworn that Potter did something to his trouser pocket when he went to Summon them.
Sensing a pause, Draco opened his mouth to speak, but Weasley held up a hand to quiet him once again. “So you need to make up your mind. Are you in or out? You know what it’s like dating Harry Potter. You, more than anyone else, know that he’s famous. You’ve seen how it affects everyone around him. It’s not news anymore. Do you want to deal with it, or don’t you? Decide, because he can’t deal with you yanking his heart around for much longer.”
Term was beginning next Monday. There was a large public gathering taking place on the Sunday before, where there would of course be speakers, interviews, and panels present, broadcasted to those unlucky enough to miss the event. On the Friday before the event, which was the last official volunteer workday, McGonagall announced the arrangements for all returning eighth-year students.
“Absolutely,” replied Hermione. Before turning to leave, she pulled Harry into a quick hug and told him that it was good to see him.
“I have a suggestion for the good Captain,” Harry said. “But I think it’s best if I file it through the official office grievance form.”
“I literally don’t give a fuck who’s driving, but if we don’t get our asses over there, we’re all going to get a demerit,” I hiss.
“And now you have one less person to knock out of the competition,” Hermione laughed. “Oh come on, Draco. I know you’re not sorry we won’t have to compete against each other.”
Trying not to be jealous about his tango dancer practically fucking another man’s face, Harry looks over and catches the curly haired man’s eye from across the room. He winks, and looks down knowingly. Feeling blushful, Harry smiles back at his dancer. He even manages to put an extra something into his smile – his first flirt of the night.
“Oh, I wonder why you feel related,” says Ron, rolling his eyes. “You’ve only known both of them since you were eleven years old. No shit you feel like family.”
Harry couldn’t imagine living in California forever. It was just too different from what he imagined as his ideal life; Draco wasn’t in it, for one. But he knew that in his heart, even if Draco chose not to be with him anymore, he belonged back in Britain. The thought took him back to the merciless onslaught of anxiety he had over the reality that he didn’t know what Draco’s decision was. Unable to quell the thoughts or stand them any longer, Harry pulled himself off of the floor and got himself a beer too. Cracking it open, he walked outside and sat down on the porch next to Ron, who was looking out at the ocean.
Grumbling, he ran his comb uselessly through his hair and went to brush his teeth. What was he even going to wear? Malfoy would never let Harry live it down if he wasn’t dressed properly for the occasion, but then again he'd also conveniently forgotten to tell him where they were going. It was chilly out today, so Harry pulled on a pair of brown slacks and an emerald green sweater. If Malfoy had any problems, well then he could provide some damn guidance next time.
Through clenched teeth –how was it possible that this excuse for a human being was winding him up?– he growled “I’m studying abroad, you half-wit. You want me to speak English? I’ll speak goddamn English.”
After neatly wrapping the present up, Harry attached it to Draco’s owl, which gave him an approving sort of hoot before it took flight. He watched it soar through the cool night, comforted by there being time and space between them so that he wouldn’t have to worry about a potential reply anytime soon.
Draco carefully continues. “I mean, is this just a one and done for you?” He works hard to keep his anxiety and fear over Potter’s answer out of his voice.
He’d been worried that the headline would play somehow on his reputation as “The Saviour” or “The Chosen One” and not only elevate him above anyone else, but then also denigrate Draco with some sort of “Former Death Eater” declaration. Somehow, though, whoever came up with the title--Luna, Hermione, or a mix of the two--managed to get it exactly right. This way, it conformed to the usual sort of play on words while still recognizing that not only Harry, but Draco as well,
The library had been devoid of Hermione when he’d been down there only a half-hour ago, so Harry decided to try some of her other favorite on-campus spots. Hopefully, he could catch her without Ron nearby. It took another a couple of trips around the grounds, but Harry finally found her out by the lake, walking barefoot down by the shoreline. He watched her for a few minutes before approaching. She looked normal, but Hermione had a special talent for guarding her expression. After all, she’d always managed to look engaged during five years of History of Magic lessons.
Surviving this summer was Draco’s top priority. He hadn’t been this keen on making it through a certain span of time since the Dark Lord had resided at Malfoy Manor, and that was because Camp Cedarwood was his ticket back to respectability in the Wizarding World. Just nine weeks at camp – one of them consisting of orientation – and he would be free. Training was exhausting enough, but Draco only imagined how much more horrible the situation would become after campers actually arrived. The work assignment had been voluntold to him: never in Merlin’s name would he have signed himself up for this torture. Draco would take it, though. The alternative was a year of probation and he’d rather jump off a cliff before permitting those fools at the Ministry to snoop on him any longer. Camp was definitely the better option, and Potter’s good looks were only an added bonus…
“Malfoy, I wouldn’t care if you make me get out by five next Saturday if you just buy me some bloody
“I’ll work on anything you want,” he promised, gripping Draco’s hips. “So long as you promise to wear your plug for me like the whore I know you are.”
“Those pastries do look really tasty!” exclaimed Hermione. There were day-old croissants, danishes, cannolis, and treacle tarts wrapped in saran wrap on the counter, clearly labeled to be put out first thing tomorrow morning. “A croissant would do nicely with my tea…”
Instead of replying, Draco nudged Neville and retorted, “That’s because he couldn’t land a curse on me if he tried.”
“I said that because I’m afraid we’ll slip back into old habits,” said Harry. “They die hard, or so I’m told.”
“Next time,” I say, as we walk back down the mountain, hand in hand, “I want to be close enough to see
They checked in on Cale and Chris, who were still hard at work looking at pictures of houses and the crime rates of San Diego neighborhoods, and changed into running shoes before leaving again.
Tailors regularly visited the house, fitting Draco for his wedding suit. He still hadn’t seen the bride, but if he didn’t love her, what did her identity really matter anyway? As far as he was concerned, he was marrying a nameless, faceless being that could easily be substituted for anyone else.
Harry smiled good-naturedly while Mike broke out in fresh chuckles. The team had had a field day (pun intended) last Friday teaching him sliding techniques on an adult version of the popular child’s toy. They swore by it, though there was one memorable moment when he careened out of control and smashed into a particularly ugly lawn gnome. Harry hadn’t questioned their methods as it had been useful in helping him refine his base running skills.
Walking forward, he grasped the handle and pulled, ready to step into the unknown. Or maybe there was another surprise in store for him.
“No,” breathes Draco, and then suddenly their lips are meeting and it’s everything Harry dreamed it would be. Draco’s mouth is soft and plump, and he’s got his hands buried now in Harry’s hair so the nerve endings in his scalp shoot straight down his core. Though Draco is slightly taller, Harry pulls him close and nips a little harder at him to deepen their otherwise chaste kiss. Responding positively, Draco opens his mouth and gently laves at Harry’s lips with his tongue. When they finally make it to the French kiss, Harry thinks his heart might burst with love for this man. As each becomes more passionate, their teeth lightly click and Harry desperately needs to breathe. He pulls slightly back and looks into Draco’s eyes, pleased to see depths of emotion reflecting out of his normally steel gray eyes. Suddenly, the eyes cloud over and Draco closes off.
They’d lie together afterwards, of course, curled up against each other with the promise of a full day ahead of them. Not just a full day, thought Draco regretfully, but a full life. Because with Potter, he strayed out of thought and time as both stretched into unfathomable lengths of nothingness and everything all at the same time. Their life together would be interesting, to say the least.
After a while, he finally stopped pacing and sat down on the settee. It was tempting to close his eyes and slid into oblivion for a few moments (he’d hardly gotten any sleep after their fight the night before) but Draco couldn’t keep himself from reflecting over the conversation they’d just had. Humiliating as it was to admit to Harry Potter that he craved
“British blend,” Draco clarified. Harry figured there had to be a whole stash of black tea in the cupboard, knowing Draco. “And don’t you dare put it in the other Gryffindor mug!” He turned around and swept out of the room, graceful as ever in his retreat.
Unruffled, he formed an upside-down V on his thigh and Hermione shot out the back windshield. At this point, Ron had already disarmed the second man—a hefty blonde, Harry spared a half-second to note—and knocked him out with his own weapon.
Dressing in a burgundy sweater and a clean pair of black trousers, Draco grabbed his designer rucksack and made for the door. He reluctantly made detours along the way to place Stasis Charms on the rooms the house elves wouldn’t enter.
He extinguished his wand and considered his options while standing there in the dark. If he sought out Potter, there was a decent chance things would end up explosive, and not in a good way. He could turn tail and leave, but then nothing he sought to accomplish would happen. Leaving a note might be the best course of action; it would let Harry know that he cared enough to make the trip, but left out of concern for his sleep.
to exist again, maybe then things would get back to normal. He would be hearing from Dawlish this week for the date of his written exam. Doodling, Harry went back to his textbook. Only three hours later, when he finally looked up and rubbed his eyes, would he notice that he’d been drawing palm trees all over his paper.
“Of course it does,” says Draco as though this fact should be obvious. “Mechanics are everything, no matter what you’re doing. Try the Sloth Grip Roll without proper posture.”
Wankers, Harry thought spitefully. Because of godfather privileges alone they could have come up with an excuse that got
Chris and Cale sat down and powered up the computer while Malfoy rattled off instructions. “Make sure not to load too many pages at once, otherwise the processer will throw a tantrum. If Steve comes in to bother you, just call him ‘Mr. C’s-Get-Degrees’ and he’ll go away. He might throw a tantrum too, actually. And don’t be dismayed by the high rent in San Diego. If the price is too low, then you’re in the wrong neighborhood.”
“It turned into a triangle,” said Cecelia, already hobbling back towards a squashy armchair and an adjacent basket of yarn, “Because you weren’t patient enough to count stitches—it would have become a square, instead.”
“Then what is it about?” Weasley asked. He opened the box and drew out the contents, studying them closely.
She took pity on him then and got up from the rocking chair to sit next to him on the couch. “He got his act together,” she said, resting her chin on her hand. “We started simple, just out to dinner and the like. But our times together were amazing. And he made it clear to me that his heart was in this, that he wanted to be with me. One thing just led to another.”
Draco cocked his head back to look Harry in the eye. “I’m your partner now in every sense of the word,” he corrected, “and don’t get too used to it. I’m equally good on the bottom.”
People were slapping each other on the butts and backs, but what was even more horrifying was that they were including Draco in this treatment.
“You’ll be stronger now because you have to be,” Hermione said. “What other option do you have?” They were silent for a while, until she sighed, “That’s how I’ve been coping, anyway.”
Harry waited impatiently for Malfoy in the Great Hall, unconsciously tapping his foot. He was anxious to get on with the renovations and
Inwardly nodding with approval, Harry gazed up the man’s well-defined torso until he finally reached the man’s face, which was slightly pointed and framed by gossamer white-blonde hair – dear God, this could not be happening to him. Draco Malfoy could simply not be standing in front of him a year after the War, in fucking
When Abalona returned, three days later, Draco was surprised to see a small package attached to her leg.
Since we’re friends now, I wipe it away. His expression changes and I wonder if I’ve done something wrong.
“Er, forget I said anything,” he says, kicking himself. The tart looks perfectly crumbly and delectable, and he’s still staring at it from outside the lit oven door.
Upon landing, he is greeted with a resounding, “Harry, ready to get going?” Apparently, Seamus wastes no time when it came to a night of drinking and partying.
“Potter!” Draco shouted, jumping into the kitchen and startling Harry as he noisily slurped up a spoonful of stew from the pot merrily bubbling away on the stove, “I know for a fact you haven’t touched those questions, so don’t think you’re getting anything to eat until you’ve prepared something!”
All at once, the dancers choose a member of the audience to incorporate into the act. Surprised beyond belief, Harry manages to rise when one of the performers offer him a hand. His dancer has short, curly hair and an intoxicating smile, and though Harry thought it impossible, he manages to feel at ease during his short contribution to the act. The man circles him worshipfully, raising Harry’s hand and kissing it. Harry can feel tingles shooting down his spine – it is definitely erotic how everyone stares at him jealously from the other tables. Seamus watches appreciatively. The dancer pulls Harry into a quick box step before leading him into a basic but fiery tango. Unsure of the timing, Harry is afraid of stumbling, but the man bends intimately close and whispers in Harry’s ear, “T A N G O” as he walks him backwards. To close, he dips Harry romantically before pulling him up into a short but chaste kiss. “Au revoir, monsieur,” he whispers, leading Harry to his seat.
Harry shook his head. “I’d trade it all in a minute for my family, and you know that. Stop romanticizing my situation because it’s just pathetic.”
“Draco,” Potter said softly. “When we were at school, back in sixth year, did you feel something for me?”
“Please do,” Potter invited, his eyes smiling, but somehow, Draco restrained. “Right, then. I’m going to make it even cheesier by saying that I too just want to spend time with you, and that’s why I don’t really care where we go.” Draco
The covers were warm against Harry’s back when Draco toppled them down onto the bed, letting out a slight
“Speaking of leaving,” said Chris, checking his watch. “Weren’t you supposed to be meeting up with our new pal Draco?”
his magic, at least not right away. He is managing just fine the muggle way, and hell if it’s not refreshing to take a little break from being a wizard. A small part of his heart begs to differ, argues that he’s afraid to use magic again because the ability was lost when it could have saved him from a traumatic situation. He shoves that opinion down, suffocating it. It’s irrelevant.
Harry could have definitely wore better pants for this, not just better shoes. His dress slacks were going to quickly get holes in them from rubbing against the coarse cement. Ron was faring no better on the other side, but at least he’d had the foresight to change into some dark jeans. The potency of the smell increased as they neared the car doors; the windows were down, the men inside laughing.
“Malfoy,” Harry complained, “My head’s bloody killing me. Now you’ve got to buy me a new pack of cigarettes, cause that was my last one.”
“Let’s give it another ten minutes,” Harry suggests. I rest my head on his shoulder, because my back’s hurting again and somehow it feels natural.
Harry barely restrained a snort. Those “methods and procedures” hadn’t been necessary to fight Voldemort. This was just some cock and bull nonsense; more sludgy bureaucracy.
As the warm sunlight hit his face, Draco covered his eyes and moaned darkly to himself. The blinds were opaque enough to keep out unwanted light for the past three days.
, Draco mused, Ron’s words echoing in his ears. He hadn’t been able to sleep again that night, and, even though he was on solid ground in the middle of the countryside, somehow he could hear fierce ocean waves roaring, breaking on the shore. Maybe the sounds were the result of hallucination, or perhaps sleep deprivation. Maybe the magic that coursed through his body made it possible for his soul to be in two locations at the same time.
Draco slid gracefully off of his bed, drawing himself up to full height to look as intimidating as possible. Calling every American insult he’d heard thus far to mind, he bore down on Steve. “You’re a cock-sucking, knuckleheaded, fuck boy doucher that has nothing better to do than antagonize me every goddamn day. Go out and make some friends, you stupid motherfucker.”
“Can I come through?” He couldn’t identify her tone of voice, but knew she wouldn’t ask to come over at 1:13 am unless there was a very good reason.
They left the table and were halfway out of the Great Hall when Draco felt the rush of magic. He had thought Finnigan’s Gryffindor morals would prevent him from resorting to trickery, but the man apparently had no honor. Launching himself into a quick roll, Draco tumbled out of the way and watched wide-eyed as Finnigan’s spell careened into where he was standing only a second before. He would have to respond in kind.
“Malfoy,” said Potter. He sounded muffled from outside the shower. “I know you’re not, and we need to talk."
“We might even get to see each other if Finnigan doesn’t murder me first,” Draco said. He was only half-joking, too. Draco hadn’t forgotten how Finnigan looked at him with cruelty in his eyes the first day Draco participated in renovations.
didn’t tromp around in the wilderness, with children no less, in some sort of torturous Muggle-induced hellhole called
“Finally,” breathed Cale with relief. “Oh Gods – I have to park on the street?” Parallel parking was not his strongest suit.
“I swear to Merlin, if you say ‘instead of your dick’ I just might have to wake you up at the crack of dawn tomorrow morning too.”
Though his chain stitches were a variety of sizes, Harry was anxious to get to the next step. The sooner this could be over, the better, he decided. Crocheting was admittedly not one of his strengths—the whole thing just felt awkward and rather badly designed. Malfoy, on the other hand, was taking (or retaking, he supposed) quite well to the craft. His chain stitches were neat and even, and Harry had to smile as Malfoy eagerly awaited the next step.
“No!” Hermione cried, lowering Harry’s hand. “We don’t do magic here.” It was a curious thing, the way the flat interacted with their magical cores. Hermione and Draco had quickly learned that, if they didn’t want their house interfering with their physical, mental, and magical wellbeing, it was in their best interest to do things by hand and save the magic for when they were out. Between the two of them, Hermione and Draco hadn’t yet unpuzzled the mystery of why the house could tap into their cores, but since it wasn’t a malicious touch and because they were occupied with other things, they decided to drop the matter for the time being. Besides, it wasn’t exactly unheard of, houses tapping into magical cores, at least not from what Hermione had read in her Magical Theory class.
“Only if you make them with blueberries,” Draco said, crawling back under the cover. Harry and Hermione assumed he would sleep until the food was ready, but Draco was already half-awake. Feeling slightly like a snoop but too comfortable to move off of the floor, he faded in and out of consciousness and listened to them talk.
day. Draco hated to admit that the interview and the photoshoot had taken quite so much out of him, but, truthfully, he was exhausted. After eating their weight in treacle tart and leaving the
Steve mixed the drinks, handing one to Harry. As he was about to take a swig, Harry clicked their glasses together. “Cheers, mate.”
Malfoy stares back just as intently. “I have. I've definitely become more inclusive because it would be pretty hypocritical of me to challenge the status quo in one regard while upholding it in another.”
“I should be getting home, Potter, but thanks for dinner,” Draco says crisply, wrapping his outer robe more tightly around himself. There’s a muggle around, so he can’t immediately Disapparate. Harry seizes his chance right before the man rounds the corner, clutching at Draco’s arm furiously.
“It was disgustingly sexy,” Harry reveals. “Seamus, though, later on in the act he actually was tonguing another guy’s red thong. You can imagine they were very well received by the crowd.”
He could almost feel Potter’s touch now against his skin. There had been a moment the other night when their fingers brushed as Potter handed Draco a ballpoint pen, and all he could think about for the ten minutes afterward (when he was supposed to be reflecting about the highly intensive day of training) was how Potter’s hand felt soft and rough at the same time. Those hands would surely give wonderful massages to help work all the tension out of Draco’s neck and back.
“Thanks, Granger,” Draco said. He’d thought about obliterating the Howler as soon as it arrived in front of the eighth-year table, but thought others might not respond favorably.
Draco walked over to Hermione and wrapped his arms around her, laying his head comfortingly on her shoulder. “Anyone who opposed Voldemort was wiped out,” he said soothingly, only stumbling briefly on the name. “Medical Potionry was hit particularly hard, because he wanted Potioneers to brew a solution to be distributed amongst Muggles, that prevented any magical capability from being passed down to their children. Most wouldn’t condone it, so he disposed of them. There hasn’t been enough time yet to replace those scholars.”
if you have any further questions.” And Draco was expelled out of the fireplace, coughing in soot, as the attendant unceremoniously ended the call.
He’s touched. What Malfoy said not only comforts him, but makes sense. He’s not any less of a person because Asten (and Seamus, for that matter) chose to use him as an object. Tears well in his eyes, but he blinks and lets them openly spill down his face. Malfoy reaches out and wipes them away, seemingly unable to help himself.
His savior uttered a quick “Finite!” and Draco found himself being slowly returned back to the earth. With flushed cheeks and a lingering sense of dizziness, he had to get his bearings back before standing and turning to face his rescuer, who had also cast a discrete Cleaning Charm on him.
Once he was reinstated as a proper citizen, Draco could see himself purchasing several hundred acres of land far away from any neighboring communities. The outdoors was peaceful, and Merlin knew Draco needed more peace in his life. Everything would feel even more perfect, he grudgingly admitted to himself, if he had someone like Potter to come home to each night. Actually, it would be ideal to come home to Potter. The stubborn Gryffindor would keep his house from ever feeling
“We practice again on Tuesday,” he said to very relieved team. “Bring a lot of water because it’s supposed to get hot. Rest.”
“I’m not,” Harry said. “Last night I ran into Ron and Hermione after you left and they asked me to go out this morning. I totally forgot that we had plans.”
, after he had a nice, refreshing shower. He firmly put all thoughts of bread and rectangular shapes out of his mind and split out of his room for his private bathroom.
“I trust you, mate,” discloses Ron, “but sometimes it’s best to quit while you’re ahead. Who knows what’s going to happen tomorrow night?”
Harry ran his hands down his face exasperatedly. “I’d pay to work in London, you know that?” he said rhetorically. “Bloody hell, what were we thinking?” He snatched an ugly chimera ornament off of Ron’s desk and hurtled it at the door too.
“It takes one to know one, you know,” he wise-cracked with perhaps more gusto than he felt, following her into the dining room suit and taking a seat. “Shall we finish our article tonight?” They hadn’t worked on it for the past few weeks, even though there was just one small discovery published in the most current issue that they needed to put into conversation with their own ideas.
“I didn’t really expect it to be that high up,” Draco said, having miraculously recovered his voice. “Is that normal?”
Instead of resting against the tree, Draco found himself striding right up to the actual tomb and pressing his right hand against it. “‘My mercy?’ ‘Your mercy?’ Ha!” he scoffed. “None of it matters now.” He sank to the ground, pulling his knees up to his chest and pressing his head back against Dumbledore’s memorial. Sighing, Draco reached up to wipe away a stray tear.
“You’re getting caramel in your drink if you even think about touching my tart,” threatened Harry, weapon in hand.
Draco obliged, giving Harry’s cock one last little lick in a place he’d previously learned was one of Harry’s most sensitive spots. He pulled off his own pants and climbed into bed, wrapping his arms around Harry, who was already curled up on his side.
Draco blocked Lucius’s, Narcissa’s, and Bellatrix’s view with his body, meeting Harry’s eyes without any trace of bitterness they’d ended on present there. Something passed between them, then, and Harry made the spur of the moment decision not to resist Draco’s advances. He slowly reached out with his hand and touched Harry’s face gently, more gently than Harry had expected, and looked him over with an unreadable, but suspiciously soft expression. As soon as Harry started to enjoy the caress, it was gone; Draco turning back around to face his family.
“Did you have something in mind, or did you want to just take a peek around, maybe look at some our piercers’ portfolios?”
Amidst the chaos, Potter was having a bit of a heart attack. “Wait, Nate! You didn’t say who I was partnered with.”
Carefully putting the pen back in its case, Weasley placed it in what was clearly his work bag before collapsing on the couch. “Nah. Americans hate quills. They think they’re impractical. Harry doesn’t mind it, really, but I miss a good eagle feather, personally.”
The first mile went quickly; even though Draco wanted to wait until he was properly warmed up to start jogging, he needed an outlet for all the compressed energy brimming within. The truth was, Draco treasured their exchange. He loved telling Harry about his week and hearing about Harry’s in return. Sometimes they veered away from events and talked about everything from movies to the meaning of life. It was refreshing, because Harry had such a different perspective than Draco did. He was also fun to debate, as—gasp—he
They left their conversation at that, but what Hermione said stayed with Draco for the rest of the night. He went home once a month to see Mother; they would spend time together gardening when it was warm, and tea-tasting and crocheting when it was not. It was unfathomable, not being able to see or talk to her, or worse yet, her think that he was someone else entirely. Draco vowed to work harder on his own research. While he had, in part, chosen this path with the intention of making final reparations to Hermione for all of the unforgivable things he’d said and done to her over their time at Hogwarts, he’d kept almost everything private, not wanting to get her hopes up. He also really
“You’re in,” Draco said. He looked up, and the look of sympathy on Hermione’s face was telling enough. “Fucking Scotland.”
“Damn straight I have,” says Seamus, clapping a hand down on Harry’s shoulder. “So when’s it going to be? Tomorrow night? I did have plans to drop by this one place, but I can easily incorporate you.”
He’d considered the best possible moment to surrender his magic – even the thought made him grimace –and had decided it would be after he figured out which part of the country he wanted to settle in. After all, North America was a lot bigger than he’d initially expected. It would take days to travel across it with one of those little moving vehicles and take it all in.
“I thought you might have a conversation about it with her,” Harry said, smiling. “Hermione loves knitting, so it makes sense she would like crocheting too.”
An intense sense of relief flowed through him. London had been Draco’s safety school, sure, but neither of them knew whether or not he would actually get in because of his past.
the ball sailed off the bat and flew to the right of Nate. He was prepared, and ran at it with all his might. Even with the enormous effort expended, the ball still missed Nate’s leather hand by a sliver and continued on its path to the grassy part of the field.
Potter kissed him again, a little more passionately this time. Desire like he’d never felt before took control of Draco, causing him to pull Potter on top of him.
Narcissa smiled in a way that made Draco wish he hadn’t asked. “Funny you should ask that question.”
“Alright, fine, I did! I forgot to eat because Draco and I had been cleaning all morning. But it was only because Ron’s coming. And you very well know how I feel where
“I love you too, you giant menace,” she said, throwing her arms around him. They sat together for a minute, enjoying the moment, but then Hermione stood up and held out her hand. “Well, come on,” she said. “I can’t last another second knowing that I could potentially hold the cure to my parents’ memory loss in my very hands.”
Draco’s eyes blurred with tears. He crumpled the letter and pitched it into the grand fireplace, snatching his wand out of his sleeve and incinerating the parchment without verbal incantation. All his hard work, down the drain. He’d consider applying again, but this was his last year. There would never be another opportunity.
Though they’d both received a warm welcome to the Burrow for Christmas, Harry was uncomfortable with spending the holiday in such close proximity to Ron, especially after their most recent blow-ups at Hogwarts. Harry and Draco had collaborated with Hermione on whether or not to attend the Weasley festivities and had learned that, though she also had a standing invitation, she was also leaning towards not going. Other members of the Weasley family disagreed with their decisions but respected them all the same; admitting Ron could ruin the festive cheer at best and start an all-out shouting match at worst.
“Are you going to whack him, or am I?” Ron asked, plucking the joint out of the blonde’s lap and taking a hit. “Ah, you’ll want some of this too, Harry. It’s decent.”
Of course, basking in Draco’s discomfort, they voted him the lucky first to spin. Grimacing, he did, and it landed on a dude. Amidst squeals and laughter, he shrugged his shoulders, and reached out to spin again. Hands came out of nowhere to stop him as some of the drunker girls shouted, “What’re you doing? Kiss him already!”
“Helping rebuild the school,” Draco stated, trying to replicate his usual confidence by adopting proper Malfoy posture. “What does it look like I’m doing? Wait, don’t answer that. Hufflepuffs aren’t the sharpest tools in the broom shed.”
He did his best to put off looking over the questions, but Draco cornered him on Friday after he’d returned home from Hogwarts, having apparently left early just for this purpose.
“The nature of my and Draco’s relationship is none of your business,” Harry snapped. “And as for the rest of you? No comment.” He made to slam the door in the reporters’ faces, but before it had the chance to shut completely, the initial reporter yelled out, in a voice that carried, “Mr. Potter, is it true that Draco Malfoy lets you take him from behind?” Thankfully, the door latched shut before he had time to curse out that insensitive git.
Draco was pulled out of his reverie. “Yes, yes, Potter,” he grumbled. “Always in a rush. Has anyone ever told you that patience is a virtue?”
She raised an eyebrow. “You have a decent sense of style, Draco, but we can’t trust Harry,” Luna said, almost apologetically. Harry took a moment to reflect how rich that was, especially coming from someone who had formerly been known as ‘Looney’ Lovegood. “We’ll have something for you there.”
“No, it’s exactly the point,” snapped Dawlish. “You could have gotten us both killed. How exactly would that look? If Voldemort couldn’t kill you, but then you got yourself trapped in a hostage situation with a second-rate Death Eater!”
; the year they’d been given to complete the revisions had just absolutely flown by. Completing a Potions mastery took a significant amount of energy and time, even more so than what was required at Hogwarts at the NEWT level. His time, when not in class or at home, was spent in the Potions lab, because the level of precision necessary for high-level brewing required Draco to constantly hone and refine his skills; and the library, where he regularly read research about Memory Potionry and other topics that piqued his interest. Draco was quite mindful of the grueling requirements of the capstone project mandatory for all graduates of the program, especially after hearing rumors about how others had been forced to extend their study in order to finish everything. One of the toughest components, in Draco’s opinion, was the Latin language requirement. While there a specific Potions specializations focused on translating antiquated Potions recipes from Latin into English, the department’s rational was that every Potions Master might run across a situation where they needed to brew a specific Potion in a timely matter and only had access to a recipe written in Latin. Therefore, Latin study was a mandatory part of the curriculum.
“Of course I want this,” said Malfoy, looking offended for the first time. “Why else would I bother, Potter?”
He couldn’t breathe. He’d always expected making love to Malfoy to be an experience in of itself, but never had Harry expected their sex to be just so
“Alright,” she said, setting down her cup on the table. Grateful for the opportunity, Harry also abandoned his; wishing Draco would have had the foresight to Transfigure his tea as well. “Let’s get right into it, then. Harry, do you want to go first?”
Draco led the way across campus, taking Potter past all his favorite spots. They slipped into a rhythm, each challenging the other but not to the point of exhaustion. He’d always been well-matched with Potter, Draco remembered.
“No can do, Potter,” Schrader gruffed. “Now stop asking. No matter how many times you ask and how many different ways you phrase it, the answer’s still going to be no. You’ve been told, you’re a valuable asset to the Division.”
“We have to take care of it,” Hermione answered. “They’re waiting; someone must have tipped them off! If they follow us, we’ll never get away.”
“It’s neutral,” answered Hermione, hiding the car behind a long-since abandoned barbershop. “We can’t go into their territory, obviously, especially now that it’s fifteen-percent larger, but we have to stay out of ours too. That’s the first place they'll look for us.”
The door to the greenhouse suddenly rattled, opening noisily as the hinges squeaked. Seconds later, Neville Longbottom came into view. He nodded at Draco and sank down beside him, pulling a rolled-up newspaper out of his back pocket.
Smiling, Harry gave Draco a playful shove. “I’m sure as long as you’re around, Malfoy; nothing’s every going to be
Their last night of training was Friday, as the teams were due for their first practices Saturday afternoon. As per their normal schedule, Harry attended Joe Buck Yourself’s insanely early morning practice, a grumpy Malfoy and his usual mug of coffee in tow.
His admission essays, on the other hand, were 100% real, though Draco had to be vague on some of the finer details. For example, for “What was the greatest challenge you’ve faced thus far, and how did you overcome it?” Draco wrote about joining the Death Eaters and following Voldemort, receiving the Dark Mark, and being ordered to kill innocent people. He assumed that the admissions committee would just assume that he’d been in some sort of gang, and left it at that. On Monday, Draco had felt Otarres’s eyes scrutinize his Dark Mark. He’d supposed that Otarres would just think of it as an interesting tattoo, but knowing that Otarres had read his admissions essay (which was quite personal, he might add) caused Draco to think that perhaps his professor had ulterior motives in helping him. Draco didn’t feel insulted–he knew that he had each of the skills the professor had named– and wasn’t complaining because it was rare that someone could see past the morally questionable things he’d done and help him with a second chance.
Ron vaulted over the roof of the car, handing the joint to Harry before he pulled back his fist. “Lights out, fuckface.” He punched Dolohov harder than he would normally, ignoring the other man’s weak protest.
“Just give it a go, Draco, what’s the worst thing that can happen? They say no? Then you’re just right back where you started. There’s nothing to lose.”
Reluctantly, Harry made as little room for Draco as he could, leaving the whole left side of his body flush against Draco’s, who was also pressed up against the arm of the couch.
“Count to fifteen,” Draco briskly told himself. He couldn’t calm down. He couldn’t count. His thoughts were going around and around in circles as he tried to absorb the events of the morning: Reporters outing Potter’s sexuality, teasing out details of their relationship to distribute to the public by afternoon, and, most unforgettably, Potter declaring he loved Draco.
They were singing Rihanna. Malfoy’s sweet, high voice seemed entirely wrong for her style of music but somehow seemed to repurpose the music into something that suited him and Harry. The crowd raged beneath them, but he only had eyes for Malfoy. As they moved with the music, catching each other’s eye after nailing a particularly powerful part of the song, Harry understood that he was falling in love with the blonde pointy git.
As he was about to imitate a windup and chuck the ball into oblivion, José was standing in front of him, blocking his movements. Draco could see Zee pressed right up against the fence, waiting for him to fail. He bit back the bile that rose in his throat and focused on the team pitcher, hoping against hope that he had something useful to contribute.
Draco thoroughly enjoyed his turn destroying Harry’s composure, enjoying every little sound he could entice out of him. When he finally took a deep breath and went to mouth Harry’s cock, Harry pulled Draco up to join their lips.
He was dragged out of a fitful sleep later that night by the feeling of the wards chiming. Sluggishly, Draco grappled for his wand to cast a
“I expect mine’s in the mail,” Hermione says darkly, folding the last of the whipped cream into the blended lime juice and condensed milk.
There was nothing else to do, so Harry spends the early afternoon cleaning his flat. He’d gotten his own place after finally becoming fed up with Mrs. Black’s racist haranguing, leaving Kreacher behind at Grimmauld Place. Harry tries to check in on him biweekly, but sometimes he trips up and only comes monthly. Still, Kreacher doesn’t seem to mind.
“I mean,” said Finnigan loudly, “Everything Weasley said is true, of course. Seems like Malfoy could be taken off his pedestal even more, the right bastard.” Many of the former Gryffindors were glaring at him, along with some Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. Though Draco hoped for Slytherin support, he didn’t think that Pansy and Blaise had yet forgiven him.
Nate sighed, reverting back to his old self and running his fingers back through his curly hair. “Two hours. We’re taking a two hour break, and then everyone is going to be back here and ready to play some goddamn baseball.” He left Zee and the other players standing there, gawking, as he walked off of the field. Draco caught the tail end of what sounded like “I swear to fucking Christ this team is going to be the death of me.”
Potter picked up his right foot, grabbing his ankle to reveal the underside of his shoe to Draco. “Cleats. This way you don’t slip and fall all over the field.”
reason why he never took risks anymore. Merlin, he could just throttle Potter for talking him into taking the leap.
Another option was to go into the Muggle world, especially because it wasn’t as revolting a choice as it would have been for Draco back when he was in school. However, one of the things Draco relished about his existence was the ability to do magic. To pass as Muggle would be to obliterate part of his core identity. Of course, marrying a woman was also obliterating his sexual identity, but Draco preferred not to think too deeply about that.
“That’s only because I dressed you for once,” said Draco, rolling his eyes. “Believe me, I’m also hoping to make it an everyday thing.”
He tried to write. He really did. But the words wouldn’t come, no matter how hard Draco willed them to flow onto the parchment.
It was paining him to think about it. He could still feel Seamus’s rough pants grinding against him and then his fervor when he came, holding Harry in place. “He came and then he went,” answers Harry truthfully. Stress is building now, because after that moment with Seamus, only a short while later he found himself trapped in the bathroom with Asten.
Draco couldn’t imagine the disgrace he’d bring down on the family name by not only entering the muggle world, but by working in a
“Why are you being so negative?” demands Harry, hand in the Floo powder. “It’s like you don’t want me to ever date anyone.”
By this time, José, the team’s pitcher, had wandered over to take his own turn ragging on Harry. “Brah, you’re really going to wow the ladies with those moves. But they’re not going to want to take you home if you steal all the dirt off the field.” It was true; after a slid, the whole right side of Harry turned muddy reddish-brown.
Jake solved that dilemma for him by climbing over the center console and settling himself on Draco’s lap, knees spread on either side of Draco’s legs. Draco reached up and grabbed Jake’s shoulders, pulling him closer. On the way down, Jake’s clothed but firmly erect cock brushed up against Draco’s, and he groaned into Jake’s mouth as they continued to kiss. Jake reached down to Draco’s shorts with the clear intention of undoing the button and freeing his cock, which scared Draco. Still trembling from the touch of Jake’s lips and hands, he shook his head no until he could finally whisper it, grabbing Jake’s hands with his own to stop them from touching his cock.
“It’s nothing like that,” he said hastily, ghosting his hand over Draco’s cheek. “But it’s not great, either.”
Another figure entered the room, but from his vantage point, Harry couldn’t tell who it was. He didn’t have to wait in suspense for long.
When Draco came down, he felt the urge to slip into oblivion while cuddling with Potter, but for some reason the Saviour was still inside him, quivering with the need to release.
Drawn back into thought, Draco answers, “I’m two years in with one more to go. But next semester will actually be pretty exciting because I get to start teaching.”
“Old wounds can sometimes form a connection, a bond,” Malfoy says quietly, giving Ron a serious look.
Potter kicked the dirt in frustration, and Draco could see that he was ready to take Nate on as well. He wanted to stop Potter, but was somehow unable to uproot himself from the dirt.  Fortunately, Nels was already handling it, making motions to lead Potter off of the field. He actually went to backhand her, but she effortlessly blocked his blow, frogmarching him away from the rest of the team.
Father smiled in an mocking expression of victory. “Enjoy your perversions while you can, Draco. I’m sure your new wife won’t have any tolerance for them.” He walked out of the room, leaving the door open behind him.
was one of the counselors letting them climb all over each other,” Potter said angrily. “If she had concerns, they should have been directed at us first. Not you. For fuck’s sake, you were talking to one of the little girls!”
As Harry reached into the cupboard for a vase, he accidentally knocked Ron’s favorite Chudley Cannons mug to the floor. Cursing, he knelt down and gathered the larger pieces into a pile. “
Truth be told, Harry was actually starting to enjoy Malfoy’s company. When he wasn’t being snarky, his witticisms and dry sense of humor could be rather entertaining. At times, Malfoy even seemed relaxed when they were spending time together on the baseball field and Harry could tell he was being more open about his thoughts and feelings instead of hiding everything behind a sneering mask like he did back at Hogwarts. He supposed the Muggle world must have had some part to play in Malfoy’s transformation. Never did he pump Harry for information about when he was going to join the Aurors, ask prying questions about Ginny (though Harry imagined Malfoy would call her “she-Weasel” or something of the sort should the topic ever come up), or remind him to keep in touch with Hagrid and the rest of the Weasleys. Oddly enough, Malfoy accepted Harry for who he was here in this strange Muggle world, and partly out of gratitude and partly out of respect, Harry left Malfoy’s situation alone. He refrained from prying into Malfoy’s struggles with Ministry legislations and completely avoided mentioning either one of Malfoy’s parents. Pretending that their past never happened seemed to work best for them both.
He didn’t mind chauffeuring Malfoy around, but driving around College Area got to be pretty annoying after a while. Thankfully, the school wasn’t busy during the summer, and so he made it back to his house in record time.
There was a park bench not too far away, and though Draco hated grimy wooden benches, he sat down. The mountains in the distance were illuminated by the mostly-risen sun, and Draco stopped to reflect on just how beautiful it really was up in the wilderness. The Manor was set aside in the country of Wiltshire, but even then he had never really been that far from civilization.
simply to practice with a partner of an equal or better skill level, tutor beginners, or simply watch, offering comments or having conversations about technique. Ron and Hermione taught lessons every Tuesday and Thursday, but he’d also roped several of the DA into also helping out. His own appearances at
Ron reached out and softly touched Hermione’s cold hand. “I’m sorry,” he said, “For not listening to you. For being a wanker every time you wanted to go out and do something instead of staying in. For giving you shit when you wanted to take Harry’s relationship with Malfoy seriously, when you wanted to support him because he was our best friend. For for putting so much emphasis on sex when you—when
For some reason, a sick feeling was starting to bloom in Draco’s stomach. The butterflies that sealed together his and Harry’s promise were betraying him, pollinating anxiety instead of love.
out there, so we situate ourselves in the stuffy bracelet making room. I’m actually quite good at this, and Pansy and Blaise roll their eyes as I instruct another staff member on the proper way to make the chevron bracelet. Hey, I couldn’t sit back and just let them do it
Halfway through, Potter’s phone rang. Draco frowned. They usually didn’t have any interruptions, and Draco treasured every moment of his Potter-time. He willed Potter not to answer the phone.
Draco laughed at this, and as his body relaxed ever-so-slightly, Harry slid in another quarter of an inch until Draco’s face squinched up again and he made a noise of discomfort.
Potter immediately looked to the lions Draco was gesturing towards. “They’re not better quality, but they’re definitely superior to the snakes,” Potter said smugly. “I’m so getting me and Teddy one of these. Just look at their little fiery manes—”
That was the desired result of the play, but then Bucks got even luckier. The catcher made the bad choice to try and throw Harry out at first even though he was practically already there, and the second baseman covering the bag missed the ball! The right fielder went to chase after it, and Becky Lou charged for home while Harry sprinted towards second. She made it safely, and Nate held Harry at second even though he might have been able to make it to third on their error. Nate chose the time and place to take risks.
Settling down next to one of the more fairly innocent species in the greenhouse, Draco allowed himself to put his head in his hands.
Harry kept pictures of them as a couple on his bedside table and in his wallet, referencing them daily, but even the motion of Wizarding photos didn’t do his ex any justice. Draco was more beautiful than Harry had both remembered and imagined. Of all Draco’s features, Harry’s favorite was Draco’s pointed nose, and that was the first place he looked. It gave him shivers down his spine, the way Draco appeared to have been carefully carved by the gods. The rest of Draco’s face equally captivated him, though Harry thought he could detect soft worry lines and longed to smooth them away.  Though Draco was as lean as ever, he still looked huggable. Harry knew firsthand just how soft he could be; the happiest he’d ever been was when he was with a clingy Draco who demanded cuddles and kisses (and always got them).
, but to trace the Obfuscation Elixir and see what other scholars have said about it to make sure we have an original idea.”
There was a sound from across the other room and Ron Weasley’s voice was calling out, “Have those Slytherin wankers finally left yet?”
There were some funny metal benches running down the right and left sides of the field, but Draco eschewed them in favor of the stadium seating directly behind the woman wearing a lot of gear. The man from the grassy field, who was now wearing some sort of head equipment and carrying a bat, was walking towards the strange white, flat object that looked like a rectangle with a triangle stacked on top of it. He stood in a white rectangular box and raised the bat above his right shoulder. Draco couldn’t possibly see where this was going.
Ron caught up to him a minute later, shoving Harry in the shoulder to stop him from walking any further. “What is it about Malfoy, anyway? You’ve always been obsessed with him, right from the beginning.”
Before he could keep up the soothing efforts, Harry spun around and launched himself at Draco, crushing their lips together in a passion Draco hadn’t thought he’d ever be exposed to again. “God, I want you,” said Harry softly. “But we have to leave. You’re right; I never want to be exposed to Molly’s wrath again.”
Grateful for Malfoy’s attentions, Harry feels himself becoming more tired by the second. Malfoy is already in near proximity, so he leans over, still completely nude, and lies his head down in Malfoy’s lap.
The tension in the room was palpable. Eyes narrowed, Draco’s pursed lips suggested he’d quite like to say a few choice words about the direction of the interview. Harry knew Luna’s follow-up questions hadn’t been listed on Draco’s sheet.
Weasley pulled out a pocket knife and started slicing open one of the candies, which Draco hazily recalled to be a Puking Pastille. “Do you see your relationship with Harry as another act of self-preservation?”
The first night after Malfoy learned to catch and throw was spent teaching him to field grounders and catch fly balls. Like Harry, he quickly adapted to tracking the ball on the ground instead of in the air. After the ball was hit, his first step was naturally back, which pleased Harry. Taking the first step back instead of forward had been one of the hardest habits for him to break when he’d started playing. Though he noticed Malfoy had a lot of potential as they shagged balls for over an hour straight, Harry suspected that he’d always be a little better as an outfielder.
They repeated the look-and-sprint process one more time, preparing to move in on the vehicle. Ron drew up the pair of binoculars hanging around his neck and counted the number of passengers. “Two goons, unless there’s more hiding in the back. But I don’t think so.”
“Phew, because maybe we can be friends now,” Harry jokes. “I always wanted to know someone who could dance a mean polka.”
Hermione huffed. “He’ll think it is though,” she said, turning around in her chair to meet his eyes. “You know you broke his heart, right?”
“Even so,” Hermione said. “Ever since he visited, I’ve wanted him back. Ever since I saw that he was a changed man.”
“It’s quarter to nine now,” said Ron, checking his watch. “What could you and the Ferret have to chat about, anyway?”
“Ready?” Draco asked. Maggie nodded. With a real sigh this time, he shouted, “This is a repeat song!”
“I'm a person, with my own wants and desires," Draco said. "I can't give those up for a relationship, I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about this anymore tonight, but I have hope for the future." He activated the wards and wondered what he'd just done as Harry was removed from the residence.
“Oh dear, Potter,” sighs Malfoy dramatically, “You must lack confidence in my cooking skills, because now I’m going to have to eat all the treacle tart myself.”
His wife took a step back while the two children grasped hands and winced. It was unclear whether they were frightened by Draco or expecting some sort of explosion from the man.
They kissed slowly, sweetly, until Draco deepened the kiss by running his fingers through Harry’s hair to draw him nearer. As Draco gently massaged his scalp, Harry broke away long enough to groan, “Mm, that feels good, but you’re going to put me to sleep if you keep it up.”
The jeers, hoots, and snarls coming from surrounding company increased. Draco could make out assorted responses like “Someone grab a camera!” and “I told you Malfoy would get what was coming to him!"
They watched in silence as Zee packed up his gear and screeched out of the parking lot, leaving them behind in the dust.
“Do you have any strategies for keeping the Chosen One from getting bored?” Luna asked, rather tastelessly in his opinion. At Harry’s harsh look, she quipped, “I’m just giving the people what they want.”
The door clicked open at one in the morning, and, though Harry leapt up in bed, instantly alert, Draco didn’t call for him. Instead, he listened intently to what he thought was Draco dropping his bag on the floor by their shoes instead of neatly hanging it up as he always did and tripping over the book he’d unwittingly set out as a death trap instead of slipping it back on the bookshelf.
Instead, Harry grabbed his newest broom, Rocket Dust, and made for the front door. As expected, Ginny had packed her things and left, so Harry had the whole house to himself again. He reluctantly Disillusioned himself and the broom before mounting it and kicking off. As he zoomed up into the unusually-bright sky and felt the breeze flow through his hair, Harry caught the glimpse of something he’d been longing for since the war ended: feeling. If flying couldn’t bring him back to himself, nothing could.
Harry immediately crashed on the couch, throwing his feet up on the arm. “Oh, bollocks, we forgot the files.”
Harry volunteers to unlock the door because it’s a pristine shade of white and he can see Draco having an anxiety attack if mud is allowed to mark the perfect paint job. It looks done by hand, an observation further evidence of how Draco made dinner the muggle way.
He loved Pansy, but he tolerated attitude from no one, her included. The only thing to be done was to give her a superior glare. “Pans, love, you know my strategy for avoiding extra work. We’ve been over it at least a hundred times.”
Draco stepped back to lean casually against the desk, though Harry could see his fingers trembling. “Out with it, Potter,” he demanded.
“Alright, Potter, alright! If you make it through the interview and the photoshoot tomorrow, with your clothes on and without murdering someone, then yes, I’ll make the stew again.”
Feeling incredibly awkward, Harry starts moving his hips in a circle, trying to remember a dance move other than the robot. He only grows more uncomfortable when Seamus laces his hands around his waist and starts grinding his crotch into Harry’s arse.
Hermione’s Cosmo wobbles slightly in her hand while Ron takes it all in stride. “So he did return those feelings after all – wow.”
“There isn’t a catch,” Draco said. “Unless I’ve made a dreadful miscalculation and the potion doesn’t work at all.”
“Potter, you’re most certainly not fine. I can see through that little act you’re putting on. After six years antagonizing you at Hogwarts, don’t you think I can tell your moods apart with ease?”
“If you want to be with him,” says Ron, surprisingly perceptive for once, “Then do it. I did think for a while at Hogwarts that you and him would be a good match. You’re both bloody stubborn, for one, and determined, and at times rather arrogant –”
hole?” She didn’t know where it came from, that venom. Being out here in France with Draco was healing, and Hermione had worked hard to try and overcome the pain of their breakup. Apparently some hurts could quickly come back up to the surface, especially when the main cause of them was standing right there on her front porch.
Dawlish sighed, having regained full control over his breathing. “Look, Harry, this is why I took you out instead of Finn. If you’d dared pull a stunt like this on him, he would have done everything in his power to toss you out of this program. I’m much more understanding-” For one brief moment, Harry’s hopes rose. Then they came crashing back down as Dawlish continued, “You’ll be on desk duty for the next three or so months before we try this again. Reading about the successful missions of other Aurors should help show you the proper way to do things.” Upon seeing Harry’s glowering face, “Or at least the way we do things.”
Potter cuffed his shoulder, drawing Draco in for a bro hug. “Come off it, you wanker,” he said, almost fondly. “I’m happy to help whenever you want.”
The bat felt heavier in his hands than it should have. Maybe it was from sore muscles, but it could have equally been from nerves. He’d only been doing this sport for a week, honestly. What qualified him to coach it?
“Right, then,” said Harry, recovering quickly. “Well then I match your biscuit, and raise you one more.” Nearly kidding, he took two long biscuits and dipped them not-ungracefully into Malfoy’s tea, trying to provoke the other man.
That was bold. But Draco supposed he expected nothing less from such a Gryffindor. “I did,” he said, feeling his cheeks turn red.
Draco blinked in confusion, taking in the scene before him. There was no residual feeling from the light, so he supposed it hadn’t done any damage. He waited a couple of minutes before concluding that the only option was to pass through the door.
“Do exactly what you’re doing now,” responds Harry. “Be there for me. Make me leave my house. Don’t let me fall into despair.”
There was a sniffle, and suddenly Draco's eyes were moist. “But you’d be giving up everything, Potter. And for what?”
“Don’t be so nervous,” said Karl. “A lot of people say that this one is really painless, though your eyes might water a bit.”
Draco sighed. Now she was pulling on his heartstrings. And, supposedly, Slytherins were the manipulative ones. “Of all people, I wouldn’t have thought you needed an overview of how gay sex worked,” he said dryly. “Isn’t there a book that covers the basics?”
He didn’t know what possessed him in that moment, but Draco heard himself say, “I’d like to get my septum done.” Immediately, he lost the ability to speak again.
He unfurled it, examining the workmanship. The cloth was triangle-shaped; he guessed Harry had been going for a square, like he usually did, but had consistently forgotten to work into the last stitch of each row so that the number of stitches slowly decreased until it formed a rounded point. It had been done in single crochet, which was a very attractive stitch even if it was simple, and the tension was uneven, as the stitches at the base of the triangle were looser than the ones at the top. If his own experience was anything to go by, Harry had become more confident the farther along he got in his project. Draco laid the cloth on the table, but it didn’t lay flat. Certain parts were bunched up and others curled underneath themselves. Overall, it was a very unattractive final product, even though he did quite like the green.
“We’re only a few minutes late,” Harry protested, switching to the banana bread. It had chocolate woven throughout, and was Draco’s favorite. He reached out and snapped a piece off of the end of Potter’s loaf.
Nate gave them a look, expecting, as usual, no goofing off while he was doing a motivational talk. “Okay, team,” he said, Nels dropping her catcher’s mask on the ground. “Our first game is on Monday. Us versus the Paleo Pandas.”
Snatching the clothes from under his nose, Malfoy made for the bathroom as Harry shook his head wearily. Really, sometimes he thinks Malfoy just finds it amusing to give him a hard time. In fact, the blonde wouldn’t be nearly so bad if he’d just lighten up a little and take out whatever stick that’d crawled up his arse. Speaking of Malfoy’s arse, Harry found himself again wishing that he could examine it much more thoroughly in peace. It’s pert, round, and utterly delectable – and Merlin’s saggy balls if it doesn’t look a hundred times sexier when he’s wearing baseball pants…
“I’m never checking the bathroom again,” breathes Harry, a good thirty seconds later. He shakes his head. “You’ll never believe what I just walked in on.”
Harry watched José run towards the mound with a growing sense of trepidation in his stomach. Had he made a mistake by putting Malfoy in this position? He had every confidence in Malfoy’s abilities, but he just wasn’t sure if Malfoy had the same amount of faith in himself. Harry ached while realizing he actually wanted to help Malfoy boost his self-esteem.
Maybe seeing Ron and possibly rekindling a friendship—not a sexual relationship, but a solid friendship—would give her the closure she needed to move on. Draco had offered to go out to the clubs and help Hermione pull, but she’d refused each time he’d asked. It hadn’t felt right yet, the idea of being with someone else intimately.
“Wait, wait,” Harry urged, tugging gently on Draco’s shoulders. “This is going to be over really soon if you don’t stop doing that.”
“I’m sure glad that’s over with,” Nate said grimly, turning back to the team. “We’re not going to let that asshole get us down.”
