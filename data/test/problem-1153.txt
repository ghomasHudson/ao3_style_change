“Deviant boy…” seethed Walburga.
Harry caught sight of Malfoy’s bright blond head as he swept down towards the quidditch shed. Harry felt that now familiar pull to go to him, even just to say hello, but Hiram’s landing was a bit of a disaster, so Harry sped over to check on the tiny boy, who looked up at him startled.
“Dad barely uses his magic, except to maybe stir a pot if he’s busy with Remy. Sometimes it feels like he forgets he has it at all. Except that morning when he—you know.” James mimed wrapping his hands around his throat, his tongue poking out for dramatic effect. “Everyone says he was so great in the war, but I don’t know, Professor. Sometimes I think it must have been a fluke. My dad, do all that? When most of the time he’s blustering about like some absent-minded puffin? Just doesn’t seem likely, does it? I’m not even sure he’s all that powerful, maybe he just had a bit of luck is all.”
When he did, he grinned “Cheeky,” he scolded. “As a matter of fact, it wasn’t, but I can adapt. I thought after all that, you’d want to call it, is all.”
And Harry and Draco have been through wars and Fiendfyre and devastating loss, so of course they can handle any crisis brought to their door by Crystal Tiering.
“Well, perhaps you could have stood to be a little more attentive, then. Although I imagine you are rather distracted right now," Malfoy remarked.
“Malfoy said we might go to Diagon Alley,” Clark all but burst out, as soon as Harry sat down.
With a final squeeze to his best friend’s arm, Al scampered back to his own bed.
“I don’t want to go back,” Jamie whispered, once he’d managed to rein himself in a bit. “Dad, please don’t make me go back.”
“Well, I can hardly tell you now after you swore up and down that I wouldn’t.”
“That’s enough,” Hermione cut her off, voice clipped and seething. “Your actions have violated Harry and Draco’s privacy. They have created real and present danger for them. They have broken trust in our dormitories and common rooms. You have behaved reprehensibly in every way, all in the pursuit of groundless gossip and sowing malice. McGonagall will be hearing about this, Jones. I would prepare for suspension, if not expulsion, if I were you.”
The words were woefully inadequate, but Potter didn’t seem to mind.
“I don’t need a mobile for two bloody weeks!” Clark retorted, “Besides, then you would have had to get a mobile as well. And they would be utterly useless once we got back to school. I’m going to be fine, Harry, I promise. Will you calm down, now, please?”
“I don’t care; I was happy to do it! I just wanted Jared to be alright. Why doesn’t she just tell me she feels badly so I can tell her not to bother with all that?”
“No!” Draco insisted, grabbing Harry by the hand, “Stay. Please, Harry. I want you here.”
“Yeah,” James replied, then stepped forward as if to lead the way. Draco followed, unwilling to be intimidated by a bit of odd Muggle technology. They turned the corner and were face to face with two large metal monstrosities. One had an odd sort of round portal in the front and the other a square door with hinges. Both had a strip over the top covered with dials and buttons and writing.
"Are you
“She just said, ‘Let’s take a walk,’ it spooked me rather badly, so I ejected her straight away.”
“Feel like a bit of a crap son,” Harry muttered.
“At LMU?” Malfoy repeated, dubiously.
, Clark was begging him.
“It’s a weekend!” Al pointed out.
“Right, because I’m supposed to believe
“Quite right,” Harry more amicably than he was actually feeling after the late night, “I fancy myself far better than any other wizard who has ever or will ever live and demand special treatment at every opportunity. You’ve found me out, Malfoy, well done you. Now please, eat your banana.”
“Leave it,” Malfoy warned, his voice taut.
“You are exceedingly committed to spoiling every pleasant moment, aren’t you, James?” Malfoy mused nonchalantly. His back was to them as he enchanted a knife to dice some onions, potatoes, and sweet peppers on a cutting board. The crisp white sleeves of his shirt were rolled up and neatly creased above the elbow. Harry caught sight of the faded Dark Mark as Malfoy reached to open a cupboard overhead. It had been a long time since Harry had seen the Mark on anything, and it made his stomach lurch. It was the only part of all this that felt truly out of place in his home.
Draco shifted to look at Scorpius, who was resting his pointed chin on his knuckles, his elbow propped up by Albus’ shoulder.
“I can’t get rid of it,” he whispered, “I’ve tried.”
“Don’t,” Harry said, “Please don’t.”
"Alright, Potter, calm down," Draco conceded. "It was just a suggestion.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well?" She demanded. "What did they say?"
“Again, I’m sorry. I don’t know what came over me, I regret that you saw me so untethered from restraint.”
“And what if I am?”
“You don’t know that,” Al whispered, his voice quavering.
“I painted a train,” Jared told him. “Going through a mountain.”
"Oi!" Harry shouted, shifting his tray to the side. Ron and Hermione startled at the sight of the large bird.
“No one would be displeased with you for living your life, I don’t think,” Draco reflected, “Except for the bit about me, I suppose.”
“Muggles don’t use owls,” Harry said.
“Oh, Harry,” Clark said, as though Harry had just arrived for tea. “How perfectly pleasant of you to join us.” He snapped his fingers, and Harry looked down to see his own wardrobe change to evening wear.
“Okay. Alright. Together then. Ah, thanks.” Harry squirmed again, blushing brightly and feeling ridiculous. He didn’t know why cementing all this mattered so much, but now that it was happening, he’d realised leaving everything up in the air had only been adding to his anxiety.
“You know those three, Mum,” Ginny rolled her eyes, “always keep the action to themselves, even when their very talented friend and sister could have helped. Can’t believe I don’t get even a year outside of Ron’s obnoxious shadow.” She eyed Hermione, Harry and Draco, “Hope you three know how lucky you are not to have scads of older siblings. They always insist they know better.”
at me, I’ll...I’ll tell you in the dark.” His words slurred a little, speech slowed.
“What’s that then?” asked Malfoy from beside Harry on the couch.
?” replied Malfoy.
“When Mum left, I was sad,” Al began. “I was sad all the time, and I was thinking about her all the time, and I didn’t want to be. So I decided that every time I thought about her, I’d just stop.”
“Going to tell me what it was?”
Pushing aside his exhaustion, Harry followed him out and down the corridor. Clark was there, hands shoved in his pockets, eyes red-rimmed and doleful.
Harry blushed. Of course, he was a damn adult now, wasn’t he? It was just being in this room that so unsettled him. He forced a chuckle. “Takes me back, this place,” he offered by way of excuse. Penelope gave him a brief hug, then stepped back still holding his arms.
“Well,” Harry deferred, not wanting to complain, “soon I’ll also have students, so it’s a good thing you’ve taught me that handy repelling charm. Merlin, I haven’t had a moment to even think about teaching, and it really has been ages since I’ve done anything like it. I’m worried I’ll be a bit crap. Shouldn’t I be preparing lessons or something?”
“Can I—” Harry dug into his pocket for some coins, but Narcissa waved him off.
“What else?” Hermione asked, gently.
they stand in their own way?
“Once more,” Harry had bargained, “I’ll ask him once more, make sure he understands both options, and if he says no again, I’ll leave it, alright? But Draco, you have to come with me, you’re, you know, cooler than I am, I think he’ll respect you.”
“Are you going to tell us war stories, then?” he asked, a glass of orange juice in hand and a determined expression on his face. Beside him, Scorpius was peering expectantly at Harry, and even Jamie looked up from where he was hunched over his toast.
, it read in Al’s untidy scrawl.
“I rather thought personal was the point,” Malfoy commented. “I went to Pansy to get some clarification.”
Harry wanted to say yes, but he sighed and shook his head. “Not with Molly here. There will be questions and she’s protective. She’s been stressed as it is, what with Ginny taking off, and I don’t want to put more on her just now.”
“I’m so sorry,” Harry repeated. He leant forward, pressing the heels of his hands to his forehead. Merlin, he was tired. He couldn’t do this.
Harry gasped and slid a hand under the hem of Draco’s shirt, his palm navigating the curve of Draco’s spine. He brought his lips close to Draco’s ear and tugged at his ear lobe.  “Believe me,” he admonished, “he wouldn’t have shown up if he’d known, and he might not show up again, since you acted like such a bloody possessive prat. Even after promising you wouldn’t.”
wicked. It was challenging, but, well, I think I did alright, and I just desperately want to do it all over again so I can fix the mistakes I made, fuck, it was all such a rush, so bloody brilliant. I don’t even care if they don’t pick me—well, I care a little—but I am just so glad I did it. And Brocklehurst and I went for lunch after and sounds like her portion sounds like it just as thrilling. Merlin, I wish I could tell you simply everything! I had no idea it would be like that, but I loved it, Draco, truly.”
Inching Forward; Little Ebbs, Little Flows; (epilogue); One Step Back
Draco shrugged, “He seemed pretty serious.”
By the end of the meeting, Harry felt reasonably confident about their next moves.
Scorpius wanted very badly to roll his eyes, but that was rude and really rather common, so he didn’t. No one would ever say that Al was a ‘good kid,’ when really Al was much closer to chaos incarnate.
“About right, yeah,” Harry said.
Harry laughed. “You’re a true friend, Ron, really. Anyway. What have I missed around here?”
“So you did, then? Have slumber parties? Merlin, I can’t imagine it. Was fun even allowable in Malfoy Manor?” Harry teased.
“Too much?” Harry asked.
He shrugged as if to change the subject but Pansy stopped him. “But you left Scorpius with him anyway?”
Draco ground against his lap, “Oh, I know you do.”
“How long was that?”
Harry worked hard not to choke as air flooded his lungs again: His body had remembered to breathe, even if Harry’s brain had forgotten it was a necessity. “What would you have done instead?” he croaked.
Ron tried to clarify his meaning, but by then was having a bit of a giggle and wasn’t at all comprehensive.
“Hn,” Harry skirted, “oh, I, ah, skimmed it." That was a lie, "I don’t generally, you know, prepare, exactly. What’s a Coozit, anyway?”
“They did,” Harry conceded. “But the man who was responsible for all that is dead and gone, and he has been for longer than you’ve been alive. There’s nothing at all for you to be frightened of. I wouldn’t let your brothers attend if I thought there was any danger. Ask Professor Malfoy, he’s been working there for years! He’d be the first to tell you if he had any concerns.”
“You do?” Harry asked, truly surprised. He mostly just hoped he’d been sneakily getting away with it, his bleeding heart spewing affection all over.
“You’re not ungrateful,” Harry assured him. "It's not ungrateful to dislike something."
“I’m sure he likes you just fine, too, although I’m not sure why it matters so much what he thinks?” Harry probed, curiously.
Harry sat up properly out of curiosity, reaching out reflexively to catch a small black box about the size of a fist that Draco tossed his way.
Constance turned her fluffy head a full 180 degrees. That was a no, then. Harry climbed off his bed and went to go track down Pigwidgeon.
“Oh,” Harry said, as they examined a display case of sleek, striped falcon feathers, “did I tell you I have a lead on the bed sheet situation?”
Draco curled a dispassionate lip. “I didn’t realise aurors were taken to indulging in gossip pages. How very pedestrian.”
Harry’s other hand came up to cup Draco’s jaw, raising his chin so he was forced to look him in the eye. Harry’s thumb came to rest on  Draco’s lower lip. He waited.
Merlin. Scorpius felt his cheeks flame in a strange embarrassment. Did Father
Harry couldn't place himself exactly, as though he were falling through darkness. All he knew was he desperate for the contact. He pressed himself against the reassuring warmth.
“I know, Molly,” Harry murmured gratefully. “Thank you for coming tonight.”
“Albus!” Scoripus protested.
“Me next!” Terry Boot announced. The Ravenclaw, obviously smashed, tottered to his feet. “A Poem for a Hero!”
“What’s got you scared?”
“Draco…” Harry started.
Scorpius stopped breathing entirely.
“If Mum doesn’t need my help then I’d love to,” Clark said, blushing beneath his freckles, obviously pleased. “Thanks.”
The words were on his tongue now, words that had been leveled against him, words that had fallen so many friends and allies. So easy, so pleasing, it would feel good, getting justice, didn’t he like justice? "Do it, Harry," Lavender pressed.
“Sure,” Scorpius nodded and Al headed off down the hallway. Draco waited patiently for his son to find the words to articulate whatever it was that was troubling him.
“Merlin, what would I even say?” Harry blanched.
“Hi,” Harry replied, nearly springing up from the sofa in his discomfort. “Merlin. Sorry. I shouldn’t have asked you to come in on your day off.”
,” Harry grunted and his wand lit up, casting a pale orange glow from its place on the bedside table. He blinked and reached for his glasses, looking rumpled.
“Alright, sweetheart?”
“Hey,” Draco said, voice half-stern, “Harry, I’m
“A whole quidditch pitch," Ron whistled lowly, "Hope you two made a good batch then,”
“Yes, alright. No more lies of omission. I’m sorry.”
he pleaded to the voice resonating round his head
“Still game to try the
Malfoy shook his head, “No, no, it’s perfect. It’s just, I’m, fuck, Potter, I’m too close.”
“Fine,” Harry replied tartly.
Draco perched on the mushy wool pouffe while Lily read aloud from her book. Godiva Greatstrides was mostly drivel, and a bit hard to follow, what with Lily pausing every few minutes to explain convoluted plot points for Draco’s benefit. There were, however, a few moments of cheek in the story that Draco could appreciate.
Harry swallowed, flushing and feeling silly about being so transparent.
“It’s potions!” Harry protested, “It’s all written down for you.”
“It's nothing, Clark, truly. Sleep well. We’ll see you in the morning.”
“Yeah,” Harry admitted. “I don’t tell many people that, so I hope you’re not getting any ideas.”
“Stop,” Harry chided, letting Draco close in for more heartrending kisses, “argh, let’s just get cleaned up and gather our things and go to bed. I want to hold you.”
Pansy lifted a dark, shapely brow. “You got on.”
“Decent of you,” Harry said, still in disbelief that they were doing all this for him. “Really. Thank you.”
“Malfoy?” Harry queried.
. Except now that seemed absurd, of course. He felt a little naive.
The professor nodded, “The second year boys were across the hall, and it was the same story. They will be seen to. Let’s get them up to the great hall.”
Malfoy gave Harry’s hand one more squeeze, then pulled away to swallow the last of his pumpkin juice in one long swig, “Now come along, Potter, it’s time for class.”
"These are quite serious allegations you bring against a very well-respected family," Headmistress McGonagall said, considering the four of them solemnly.
Narcissa’s eyes were wet with unshed tears. She only nodded, “That is your decision, my love, and I will respect your wishes on the matter.”
“A few blocks away,” Harry admitted.
“Better than being a bootlicker,” Clark fired back with a glare. Harry found himself resting his palms on Clark's shoulders.
“Give it here,” Harry directed. For a moment, he thought Draco might argue, or make some remark about not trusting Harry with a straight razor or him being too reliant on muggle technology. He didn’t, though. He simply slid the shaving bowl and brush across the bathroom counter. He’d watched Draco use his kit enough times, and imitated those gestures, painting the lather on in brisk circles. He held out his hand expectantly, and Draco passed him the razor, then propped himself against the counter, hands curling around the stone lip.
Clark helped himself to an apple from a fruit bowl Kreacher had apparently placed in the centre of the table.
Natalia bloody Pushbottom’s name jumped out at him from under a hideous headline:
CW: mild alcohol use
Draco didn’t like the warmth the praise stoked just behind his ribs. “It’s fine.”
“Look out the window,” Harry instructed Draco, “it’ll help.”
“Oi, get your own!” Charlie laughed, spotting Harry, who tossed his card up on the table.
“Easy there, mate,” Ron said, “we’ll get you some help.”
“It’s still weird, thinking about you at Hogwarts. But that might be alright.”
Sorry for my tardiness! One more week and then I will be blessedly alone again, and posting much more regularly (I know I have promised this before, but then my plans changed. I mean it this time!)
“Alright, Wyverns,” Harry said. “I know it is a bit disappointing that we didn’t make it into the quarterfinals; I would have loved to see you take the first ever rec cup. But that is never what this was about, and I hope you know that. You’ve all grown so much as players and as teammates this year. You’ve improved tremendously and I can’t wait to hear who among you secures a spot on a house team next year. For the rest of you, I’m hoping you’ll keep this league alive. In an effort to keep it going, I’m recommending Awling as the next coach of the Wyverns.”
Ron wouldn’t look Harry in the eye.
“Excellent!” Penelope announced, clasping her hands together. “Well, then let’s make this whole thing official, shall we?”
“I’m a halfway decent parent when I’m not drowning in my own self-pity,” Harry muttered.
“Monday,” Harry repeated.
“I know, dearest, but it doesn’t feel like ages ago to those who lost someone. One of the Weasley boys was killed in action and I’m not certain that is something people ever fully heal from.”
“Not much else to do while she was in there,” Clark shrugged, “Besides protect the rest of my thoughts and keep Atwal here from running to find a professor and destroying all my efforts.”
“But I’ve got the, what is it, social capital, to do it, so what choice do I have?”
Scorpius allowed his thoughts to spiral out towards what all this might
Draco had to reluctantly concede. There was little his mother minded when it came to the boys. It was as though she was living a second motherhood, free from Lucius’ iron rule, and she did tend to overdo it a touch. While she wasn’t as warm and maternal as Molly Weasley, Mother indulged them all, Harry and Draco included, with expensive gifts and excesses to the point where Draco had to tell her the boys ought not to expect to receive something
Harry spooled Draco up into his arms, kissing his hairline, “You’re so incredible, babe. Fucking hell, you holding yourself off like that nearly killed me it was so bloody gorgeous.”
As Kreacher wheeled the cart out, Constance swooped in with a series of low, urgent hoots. She careened directly towards Harry's breakfast tray.
“Can I help?” Draco asked simply.
“Lily!” Harry scolded.
“‘Course, professor,” Ron hurried to assure her,
“What about the sprites, though?” Al asked. “Didn't you say they were part of the thing?”
“Maybe I will,” Claire said, with a toss of her head, “Maybe I won’t.”
“Good morning, students,” She greeted them, her strong, clear voice as no-nonsense as ever, “I hope you have been settling into your new routine and are enjoying your term here at Hogwarts as much as we are enjoying instructing you. We have two orders of business. Firstly, despite a delay, we are pleased to introduce the new Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor who arrived last night from her work in Madagascar, Professor Lucille Haberdash-Pewter.”
“Daddy said his boggart would be Jamie when he’s stayed up too late reading his comics and gotten up too early and not yet had breakfast.”
“No?” Harry confirmed. “You think you deserve a bit of a hiding?” He felt his own cock thickening in his trousers.
“Stealing sticks,” Harry explained, “It’s a muggle game. Haven’t played it since primary school, but with the potion, it will be a laugh, I promise. There’s two teams, each team has a stick, and you try to steal the other team’s stick without getting tagged by another player. You get tagged and you get sent to prison for sixty seconds. Though I think Seamus said Luna’s agreed to referee, and she’s going to just put the offending parties in a temporary body bind.”
“Yes. So?”
Dean beamed, “Fantastic idea, let’s sort it out, soon, yeah?”
Draco chuckled at the anecdote and Potter rewarded him with a little grin, which faded suddenly as a thought seemed to cross his mind. He swallowed and Draco watched the stubbled curve of his Adam’s apple bob in his throat. Merlin, but he liked looking at the man.
“It’s getting late,” Draco said, “It will be dark soon.”
Clark didn’t know what to do. He looked around the room absently. He shouldn’t stay, but he didn’t want to go.
“No,” Draco said sharply, that’s not your line. “Your line is, ‘thank you,’ understood?”
Harry met Clark in the usual classroom for Occlumency lessons that evening. Harry was a few minutes late and was surprised to not find an impatient Draco waiting for him.
“I know, sweetheart,” Harry crooned, squeezing his neck again before leaning in to kiss his face, “and the truth is, I like keeping you here, keeping you safe from everyone but me.”
The question took Harry off guard. He went to answer and then stopped himself, suddenly unsure. “Everything is twisted up,” he said, finally. “I want to say he likes...being taken care of. Not financially, I don’t mean, he’s got loads more money than I do. More like, looked out for. But now all the sudden taking care of him feels all wrapped up in the status and power thing. Like maybe he knew I would protect him. Maybe it’s all part of the fucking ruse.”
Harry didn’t have much to offer, it had been so long since he’d watched television, but Clark didn’t wait for his response. He seemed excited to be introducing Draco to it, and for his part Malfoy demonstrated genuine, if dubious, interest. Clark showed the older boy the remote control and laughed when Draco almost jumped out of his seat when the thing turned on with a static ping.
“Need you to ruin for me,” Harry breathed, as he quickened his movements. “Just as I fill you, and push you over the edge, I’m going to pull off and deny you. It might hurt a little, make you ache. You’ll hate me for it. Can you do that for me or will it be too much?”
Scorpius sniffed and nodded.
“I don’t want to have to keep apologising,” Al blurted out, voice still hushed. “Hell, that’s wrong; that’s not what I mean. You deserve apologies because I keep bollocksing everything up, but I don’t want to keep doing that. I want to stop doing that so there is nothing for me to apologise for! But I am sorry, you know, for earlier.”
Draco’s usually proud shoulders slumped and Harry rushed forward again to gather him tight, but Draco stiffened in his arms.
“He’s nice,” Scorpius informed him. “You might like him if you gave him a chance. He’s nice even when Jamie is being an absolute shit disturber and—” Scorpius clapped a hand over his mouth.
There was an exuberant chorus of ‘
“Very well,” she decided, “What can I do for you gentlemen?”
“You do only ignore some people,” Fort quibbled. “You pay attention to Jamie and me.”
“Stop isolating yourself? Reach out to people who care for you?”
“Oh, if you think your punishment ends with you getting off, you’re sadly deluded.”
Scorpius was growing Cloistered Flash Agaric, a type of fungus which remained under the soil for much of its lifecycle, bursting forth only to scatter its spores, shrivel up, and die. Scorpius had read about a potion called Cracker Flash, which gave the imbiber a temporary burst of energy. Given how exhausted he was all the time, Scorpius thought such a potion sounded heavenly, so he diligently cared for the mushrooms, although he had nothing to show for it, hidden as they were.
“So glad you’re here,” the Barbara person said, with a faint smile. “I’m, ah, not magic, either. We’ll have to stick together.”
“I said,” rasped Clark, “On this week’s episode of My Two Sad Dads…”
The more Harry considered the question, the more agitated he felt himself becoming. “And I don’t know why else he sticks around,” he continued “I’m not particularly funny or clever, not like him. He works bloody hard, he thinks about things, he’s organised and neat and has an eye for things I know nothing about.”
“Where is everyone?” he mumbled, grateful that Draco hadn’t put him down. He didn’t usually get carried about so much. It made today feel a bit special.
Everyone laughed, ripe with pre-game jitters, and Harry grinned, “Well, I’m not going to stop you from going out there and trying for a win, either. Remember, signal me if you want a break, we have a back-up chaser and beater.”
“Bubble heads on and up the great hall!” Harry ordered, and the students were quick to obey. “Awling,” he stopped her, with a hand on her shoulder, “Which one is Clark’s dormitory?”
“Us two!” Erupted Atwal, his dark brown eyes flashing with anger, “I’m the one who's been bloody kidnapped by a first year, kept in and out of body binds all day for the sake of his demented plan.”
“Alright,” Potter acknowledged. “Glad he’s having a good visit.”
“Merlin,” Harry yawned. “I’m all but ready to pass out on the couch. Do you mind terribly if we make an early night of it? Now that Remy’s finally got some sleep, I might be able to get some myself.”
memorised trivia,” Ri pointed out. “And to answer your question, no, I barely survived Charms. Clifford Dunsdale is the thickest git to ever wield a wand. He turned his quill into a parakeet and we spent the rest of the lesson trying to switch it back. Transfiguration magic! In
“The first bit was just dress rehearsal,” Lily determined. “Sit, Daddy, here!” She built him a throne of pillows to the right of Draco’s giant squid, which Harry gladly took. Draco reached out for the sleeping baby, and was quietly pleased when Potter relinquished him. Draco fitted Remy into his lap with one hand, still pressing the compress to his head with the other. Both Draco and Harry leant back against the side of the bed, and Harry stretched out his long legs, shifting to let his upper arm press ever so slightly into Draco’s.
It was late by the time Harry pulled back. He loosened the hand that had found its way to Malfoy’s neck, remembering the hitch in Draco’s breath when he’d placed it there, the way he’d strained upwards into Harry’s palm, encouraging the pressure. Their breathing was coming faster, shallower and Harry’s pulse was in his ears.
Thanks, everyone!!!!
Their knees knocked companionably once more beneath the table, and Harry watched Draco duck his head and smile into his tea.
“It’s a simple amalgam of various drinking games, but with higher stakes," George explain, "These cards have been dipped in Intuition Unction. You have two choices, complete the instruction on the card, or take a drink and let the card reveal something about you. No specifics, of course, just a little read on your energy that the rest of the room will be subject to. Now some cards you read aloud, some you won’t, some you’ll do right away, some you have a round to complete. You can outwit the cards, or take your own interpretation, but you cannot outright lie or cheat.”
“He did!” Teddy insisted. “I’ve been here a week and he’s not missed an evening, Professor, I swear.”
"Of course you do," Draco replied. "You're right fit and I know my product." He edged closer to Harry, looking up at him. Harry kept his eyes on the mirror. He'd not seen a lot of pictures of them together, and they certainly didn't share a mirror over the tiny sinks at school, so the experience felt new: intimate and unique. Draco's neck was exposed, as was the pointed hinge of his jaw until he turned to see what Harry was fixating on. When he figured it out, his lips curled in pleasure. The contrast of their hair and the size of their frames,  the secret warmth of Draco's expression: it all did something brilliant and uncomfortable to Harry's heart. He pulled Draco close and kissed his head. Grey eyes met green in the reflection before them.
Clark squirmed.
Draco pitched forward until he was on his hands and knees, breathing hard.
“Really!” Rose was the first to react. She was a near replica of her mother, brains and all, except the bushy hair that framed her face was the colour of carrots. “Uncle Harry, that’s wonderful! Oh, but I hope Professor Stump is alright?”
“It’s fine,” he heard himself say. Potter’s smile brightened.
“I’m not sure that’s it,” Harry mused, “I never had any emotional control around Snape, and he never got mired in my thoughts like that.”
“And you think I am?” Clark protested, “That’s hardly fair!”
“Even if I don’t want it?”
“Oh fine, fine, you’ve made your point,” Jamie relented, popping a potato in his mouth and chewing thoughtfully.
"Malfoy didn't," Clark argued, his voice thick with suppressed tears.
“Oh yeah?” Harry asked, poking through the supply cupboard for sweet grass seeds, “Think Ron’s taking that this term, too. Trying to learn to relate to his future in-laws, I suppose.”
Potter clasped his hands. Draco watched as the sturdy muscles of Potter’s fingers flexed with tension. “Until Al,” Potter said bitterly.
“Oh?” Draco prompted. He stood, unmoving: a solid counterbalance to Harry’s jangling nerves.
“Alright, see you at quidditch practice, then.”
“I don’t want you to worry, love, truly. Eiderdown End is still our home, and whenever the boys have holidays, we’ll all be here together. It will be good practice for when you leave for Hogwarts next year, hm? I know how much you’ve been looking forward to that!”
“That’s good of you, love,” Harry tells him, and leads Clark to the ostentatious green velvet loveseat, sitting him down, one arm still around Clark's shoulders, like he’d keep it there just as long as it was needed.
Thanks so much to everyone who read and commented on the last chapter! I appreciate you so very very much ♥♥♥.
“Disgust from the boy who reads zines!” Draco chided as he and Harry easily caught up.
“Thank you,” Draco amended.
“Not well,” Draco admitted. “But Arthur Weasley...He was a good man.”
Between Harry’s lips, Malfoy seemed to grow impossibly harder and the sounds he made as he tossed his head left Harry feeling reckless and mighty. He increased the pressure and pace until he sensed the muscles in Draco’s abdomen tightening in anticipation.
“We think…” Harry started carefully, “that some DA members are getting aggressive—physically so—with some Slytherins. You two are closer to most of them now anyway, do you know anything about it?”
“You...did?” Scorpius asked.
Thanks so much for your really thoughtful comments on the last chapter, I'm so glad it read authentically!!!
“Thank you. I want you here, you know,” Harry said simply. “However I can get you.”
“Any place you particularly like?”
When it was his turn, Harry stepped up to the grate, giving the old goblin behind it a congenial nod. “Hi, could I have a quick look at my recent deposits and withdrawals?” He gave his vault number and the goblin shuffled off to find the correct ledger. It seemed to take an age, and Harry kept throwing glances back at Malfoy while he waited. He couldn’t sort out what the other man was playing at. Why had he agreed to this ridiculous idea in the first place? It wasn’t as though he’d suddenly decided he enjoyed Harry’s company, and if he did, he had a funny way of showing it. He’d looked round Harry’s house in pronounced distaste—Merlin, that incident with the jam, Harry had nearly sunk into the floor. Just another stark reminder of his incompetence.
“Just please don’t make me do small talk before I eat something,” Malfoy muttered back, “I’ll positively perish.”
“Where is he?” Malfoy repeated.
Jamie blushed, but his teacher didn’t sound angry, so he reckoned it was alright to keep going. “My mum did, that’s for certain. She always said she grew up poorer than a church mouse and nothing made her feel more crumby than when people would draw attention to it. But we weren’t ever rich, so I don’t know what it’s like, and how will I know if I don’t ask?”
“You’re in the girls’ hall,” she explained, “Boys are in the left corridor, first years will be the first door on your right.”
“I doubt you were the only nervous student,” Harry said comfortingly. “Lots of kids doubt their abilities, or are hesitant around anything that feels like competition, or having their skills assessed.”
So many sincere thank yous to those of you who've stuck this out, who've cheered me on, and who've corrected my North American English (shout outs to cottonwoolspots & Freya_The_Ravenclaw, especially!). Also, to folks who reached out on Discord, I've never really had folks to geek out about fanfic with, so THANK YOU!!! Oh and also, major thanks to That_Guy_Kurt and GalaxySnake005 for their incredible art, which is like the most flattering thing and I love it so so much. I literally can't tell you what you all have meant to me.
“No, like everyone else in this damn school, you refuse to acknowledge his existence,” Jamie muttered.
“Sometimes I wonder if the reason I can resist the
Draco gave himself a once-over in the mirror, but refused to allow himself more than that. There would be, he decided, no changing of outfits or fussing with his hair, like a nervy teenager.
As if on cue, Kreacher pushed in a rickety old trolley taller than he was. Harry was not even aware that particular piece of furniture existed. It was steeped high with tea and breakfast goods.
“So what then?” Pansy demanded.
“I wasn’t there,” Harry tried to explain. “You brought me back.”
“You’d be stroppy too, if you’d wasted the better part of ninety minutes reading the gossipy drivel that is Ms. Grumbles’ literary arena,” Boone griped, but, to Scorpius’ surprise, he grinned back at James. Scorpius winced, inwardly. He never could understand these friendships that seemed entirely based on ribbing one another. He was glad Al never bothered with nonsense like that.
“Hey,” Harry said, “I mean it, you need to talk, find me, or Draco if you’d rather. We’ll talk. About school or home, or anything. You’re not on your own here. It might feel like it sometimes, but you’re not.”
“You were held prisoner?” Jamie asked, looking suddenly rattled.
After a kip and shower, and with Teddy occupying Lily and keeping an eye on the baby, Harry felt up to cooking dinner. He was chopping potatoes, watching Scorpius tear back and forth across the grass while Al observed from the walkway, notebook and quill in hand. It hadn’t been a hard decision to leave Number 12 after Jamie was born. Harry had been taken at once with this sprawling cottage in Somerset. The original building had rooms added in every direction like scattered bits of patchwork and Ginny had christened the place Eiderdown End. In the summer, Harry turned the garden into a makeshift Quidditch pitch, where Jamie and Lily liked to race about on their brooms. Albus had never taken to flying. He instead liked to read a great deal, or poke about for insects under rocks, or crayfish in the stream, endlessly curious and forever popping into conversations when Harry thought he was elsewhere.
“I had my time with Scorpius, and she had her time. Publicly, we took pains to appear as a cohesive family.”
“Well, they took you somewhere safer, allowed to to concentrate on the countermeasures. It’s not easy, Tiering, you did really well, trust me.”
Draco exhaled and the pressure eased off enough for Harry to push forward.
“I had a bad dream?" he admitted, and he didn't know why it sounded like a question but it did. He ducked his head and waited for them to react. To get exasperated or maybe to pat his shoulder and send him back off to bed.
The Hufflepuff sniffed and turned up her already rather upturned nose, and marched off. Ron stifled a giggle.
Lavender looked less than thrilled with the prospect, but the footsteps were rapidly coming closer and so, with one last shudder of disgust, she dove into the toilet and disappeared.
Ron snorted, “We are talking about the same Malfoy, right? Barely appreciated Harry saving his life the first time round, I doubt he’s even noticed this time.”
Harry shook his head, “Er, no thanks. Just here to, ah, take the job, I guess. Sign the paperwork or what have you.”
Harry wasn’t so easily baited, he was more distracted by the way Malfoy was guarding his midsection, clenching his teeth, and wincing whenever they fell out of step. His injuries were apparently more severe than Harry had realised. He felt the wave of rage building again and clamped it back down.
“Why’s your house bad, Nan?” Jared asked, prodding curiously at the partridge before him.
“I’m not a snitch.”
“Please.”
“We learned about you at school,” Scorpius said, shaking her hand politely. “Everyone says you’re terribly clever.”
He was met with matching scowls from the boys, neither of whom had ever taken to Quidditch. Nevertheless, Draco didn’t budge. He needed some time to mull this all over. He ushered the children toward the garden door. “Or, if that doesn’t appeal, Scorpius, perhaps you can show Al the pond, the woods, or the greenhouses. If you choose the latter, don’t pick anything, please. Most of the ingredients are for this coming term, and Al, I’ll not return you to your father with a swollen tongue or a rash from eating something you shouldn’t.”
“I think what Hermione is saying is that the absence of action is not exactly action,” Neville said thoughtfully, arms crossed. Harry was still unused to Neville’s quiet confidence. He barely recognised the boy any longer.
“Okay. And that’s...it?” Harry realised he was a bit annoyed. This whatever-it-was with Malfoy. It felt bigger than dinner and a chat.
“Is there anything you don’t think of, Granger?” Draco asked admiringly.
“I’m so sorry, mate,” Ron grumbled, “We didn’t hear much, I swear.”
They looked at each other for another long moment. Scorpius felt like he was intruding on something horribly personal, but he couldn’t think why.
The pressure increased: warmth and solid muscle alongside his. Harry swallowed, and ever so slightly, he pressed back. Wondrously, Malfoy didn’t pull away either, but instead maintained the steady contact between their bodies. Harry felt his heart do that uncomfortable flip-flop inside his chest. He didn’t know how a simple, possibly accidental touch could feel so significant, he only knew that it did. Before he could analyze the moment further, Headmistress McGonagall rose to her feet and the great hall grew respectfully silent.
Fort crumpled up her crisps package and shoved it into her bag, the beads in her hair clacking musically as she did. “Well then, mystery solving’s on hold until we’ve got the necessary materials. Excellent. We can finally stop spending our free evenings in the bloody library. There’s a bit of time until dinner. Fancy some Quidditch practice, Jamie?”
“Hm?” Harry shifted closer, pressing into Draco’s touch.
Draco harumphed lightly, leaning into Harry’s touch. “I must love you an obscene amount to be going along with this outrageous scheme of yours.”
A hand went up from a man near the front. He had a long nose and a suspicious, bookish look to him. “I’m curious as to how so much of the wizarding war was kept from us non-magic users, in the first place.” He said, “Would you be able to shed some light on that?”
Harry sat with the words for a while, mulling them over. He didn't really think Draco, Hermione, or Ron's feelings towards him had changed. He certainly wouldn't have thought less of any of them for the same. He didn't think that was what was ultimately bothering him. It was their concern, their needing to run out and fetch an adult to see to him that niggled at him. The idea that anything could have happened and he couldn't have stopped it because he was too busy falling to pieces.
“Next time,” Harry said and felt a glow of anticipation when Malfoy simply nodded his agreement. “So, ah, how have you been?” Harry tried, supposing they should do at least some small talk. “Anything new?”
“Where’re you going?” Whined the supine boy.
“Hm,” Draco considered, then gave Harry a little smirk that said he was mostly joking. “Doubtful.”
Harry fumbled his wine glass as he went to run it under the tap. It shattered on the floor. “Shit!” Harry cursed, jumping out of the way as Hermione uttered a repair spell. The glass rematerialised atop the counter.
Things like that shouldn’t switch on a person. Things should either be worth being scared about, or not, and until Clark went away to school, Jared had sorted magic into the ‘do not worry’ pile. But he felt safe under here.
Ron fidgeted with his glass, tapping it idly against the table.
Thanks for your understanding and apologies to non-users who were expressing a lot of kindness, I'm really sorry to have shut you out. Thanks to those who read, left kudos and kind comments on previous chapters. I appreciate you very much.
for one second more than I need to.”
The goblin scowled and nodded and soon they were zooming along again.
“Out!” Harry bellowed. “Now!”
“Just more blather about my being bent on your destruction,
"In that case," Draco drawled, "care to tell us what you two have been up to?”
“You’re awfully generous,” Hermione said, shaking her head, “you’ll recall you weren’t raised by a loving family either, so I’m not sure that’s an excuse.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Mum was also having fun. She was talking loudly and laughing, and her cheeks were bright red. She looked so pretty. Jared didn’t think he could remember ever seeing her this happy.
The Prophet
“It’s just trolls,” Clark had yelled from the doorway, over the screech of the latest howler which was ordering Draco to “leave poor Harry alone.” Ron set it ablaze—his aim for the flapping, yapping scrolls was getting quite excellent.
“By all means.”
“Really, Harry, go back to sleep. You need it,” Draco tried to burrow even deeper, but Harry wasn’t having it, tossing his head with frustration and keeping enough distance between their bodies to enable him to look Draco in the eye.
“So you’re keeping it a secret? But nobody seems to hassle Dean any,” Clark pointed out, crossing his arms, “And you could have told me! Not really fair that you know all my secrets and I don’t know yours.”
“I parent,” Draco reminded her.
“Or you could consider there’s more than just those two options,” Zerk offered gently, “you could all just take care of each other.”
“Congrats, Harry,” Ginny said, Hermione echoing the sentiment. “That’s wonderful news. We’ll all come see you play and I’ll even bring tissues so Mum doesn’t cry all over your smart club uniform.”
“Honestly,” Clark considered, chewing on his lip, “I was just feeling kind of, like naked as I do after lessons? Sort of blown wide open? But having some dirt on you two has done absolute wonders.”
Neville was looking at the wall, “These are the dormitories?”
Harry begged to differ, thinking about all the attacks on Draco’s life so far this term, but that wasn’t what caught his attention, “Are people giving you shit?’ he asked gently.
“I said no,” Jamie whinged, his voice muffled by the duvet.
"No," enjoying the unexpected anonymity, "just a student."
“Thoughts and beliefs are contagious,” Professor Haberdash-Pewter suggested.
But one glance at Harry’s serious, earnest face told him everything he needed to know.
Potter finally leant forward, rubbing at the back of his neck. He was going to give himself a rash if he didn’t cut it out. “I have a confession to make about my terrible son,” he admitted.
Scorpius wondered if he ought to be upset. He was surprised, certainly, but he wasn’t angry or hurt or jealous, or experiencing any other unpleasant feelings he supposed he might. In fact, the emotion taking shape within him was much closer to something nicer, something, he thought, that might be happiness. Because despite the gravity of the conversation, Father had looked comforted in Harry’s presence. Scorpius had never thought of his father as a person who required comforting. Then again, he thought, everyone needed to be comforted from time to time, so maybe Dad was just better at hiding it than most.
“Yes, James?”
Minutes passed in silence, Harry’s hand drifting tenderly over Draco’s back.
Harry wasn’t at all sure he knew what colour dusty rose was.
Draco nodded and bit his lip, “That was...ah, just really intense.”
The blond head nodded carefully, he always looked so beautiful in torchlight. He could have been an angel, Harry thought, maybe he was.
Potter didn’t say anything, his green eyes clear and attentive in their compassion.
Draco's lips were a solid, reassuring press against his, and Harry believed him.
“What?” Teddy said, the forearm curved around the baby tensing.
“Just wait ‘til he’s playing pro,” Dean volleyed back, “every game in Britain will be like a home game, where Harry’s concerned.”
“I’ve been living what it is to be without her,” Harry murmured, his voice rough and catching in his throat.
“Oh no!” Albus remarked, his eyes growing round. He clutched a farcical hand to his throat. “I feel it coming on!
squid pouffe, actually,” Lily informed him.
“You need me to do it for you, hmm?” Harry pushed.
“Bloody hell, the look of you,” Harry grumbled. “It’s hardly fair.”
Draco shook his head, “I’ve tried in the past, it just didn’t take.”
CW: alcohol use.
“No,” Zerk replied firmly, “I don’t. You’re not showing any symptoms relating to love potions: obsession, endless praise, or distraction. And an Imperius spanning this distance would be quite the feat for a teenager.”
This maybe wasn't what the Mirror of Erised had shown Harry all those years ago, but Harry couldn't help but feel it was pretty close.
Harry clasped his hands around Draco’s waist, tugging him close.
It was the dinner hour now, and Harry had snuck away from his guard of Neville and Terry Boot to escape to the common room so he could, well, mope, he supposed.
Clark seemed to bite back a grin. “I guess I ought not to lose so much sleep over it just yet,” he relented.
“Good, and I’ve still got two ears?”
He kicked down the covers low enough that he could maneuver his feet under them, then pulled them up to his shoulders and flopped over onto his side,  back to Harry.
“And constant soothsaying would prevent him from having a childhood at all. I know you want better for him. I want better for him, too. The current situation's not perfect, but it’s what we have,” Harry reminded him gently. “Come on, let’s have some tea and get to bed. Things won’t look so dire in the morning.”
“I’ll make some tea, shall I?” Draco says, rising.
“Of course, you know Ron and Hermione,” Harry proclaimed with a handwave.
“I’m sorry, Hermione,” Harry mumbled. “I knew this was a rotten idea, but I’d hoped...well.”
Harry felt his heart both sink and pound. Stupid, it seemed to say with every beat, stupid, stupid.
“Yes,” Harry muttered. “I’m aware.” But it was too late, because Teddy was gone.
Thanks so much to everyone who commented, and thanks for reading!
“It’s alright,” he said instead.
Clark’s lips parted in surprise and his eyebrows shot up towards his orange spikes, “Yeah?”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed mournfully. “But like I said, daft. I’d hoped I’d not have to get into things fully if you just popped into the drawing room. That perhaps social pleasantries or something would propel us forward and we’d all tacitly pretend the circumstances were perfectly normal. But Ron’s never been one for subtlety. And besides, I should've known better than to have thought I could withstand Hermione’s scrutiny. Nothing’s changed in that regard, by the way. I don’t know if she mentioned anything to you, but she figured us out in all of half an hour. She’ll not say anything, I’m sure of it.”  In his lap, Harry’s fingers clenched and unclenched. He was still frustrated with himself, and embarrassed. “I should have been upfront with them. I know it. I just lost my damn nerve. Not sure when I became such a coward.”
’d the watch and cast an alarm spell.
Harry was just trying to staunch the acute onslaught of humiliation at the whole exchange when Lily came running into the drawing room. “Daddy!” She said, her little nose wrinkling, “Something’s burning.”
“Well, what with you two deciding to go public, something had to be done. Narcissa’s hired an experienced hexbreaker from Latvia. She’s putting him up in the Hog’s Head and he’ll be dealing with the post. I’ve changed the wards so your mail ends up in the same spot at Harry’s for now, Draco. I’ll just need to have you both sign waivers so Raulo can collect it for you.”
“For your date. I assume you’re taking him out somewhere?”
“What do you feel like you owe them?” Zerk inquired.
“Yes, alright,” Scorpius agreed. “Better than randomly falling asleep at seven p.m., after all.”
Harry turned his face, pressing it against Malfoy’s outstretched palm. Harry heard Malfoy’s breath hitch at the contact and he found he liked catching the other man off guard. With the pad of his thumb, Malfoy traced a path along the ridge of Harry’s cheekbone, before easing downwards and doing the same to Harry’s bottom lip. Harry felt his chin being lifted slightly, until he had no choice but to meet Malfoy’s solemn, grey eyes once more.
“Right,” Potter helplessly blew out a lungful of air, which made his fringe flutter over his forehead, exposing his scar. “I’m not sure I’m a terribly interesting bloke to be honest.”
McGonagall co-opted Hermione’s S.P.E.W. buttons and the Aversion Amulet idea. Her and several faculty spent all of Sunday night making enough amulets for the whole Slytherin house, with plans to make more for the rest of the student body as soon as possible. When the buttons ran out, they would switch off to pins or hair clips, whatever they could sort out.
“Don’t be absurd,” he hissed, desperate to get back to the familiar, the numbing assault of Harry’s hand on his arse.
Maybe it wasn’t so bad having a Gran.
Malfoy gave Harry an approving glance and Harry felt himself flush. He was a good father. He knew he was a good father, even if his life was in shambles right now. He didn’t need anyone’s approval, least of all Malfoy’s. And yet he liked it, nonetheless.
“I can’t,” Malfoy whispered, eyes wide, pupils blown. He was panicking, Harry realised.
“What sets you off about Jamie?”
“Surely, I should get a say in that particular agreement.” Harry looked behind him to see Draco appearing, as if out of nowhere. Harry grinned drunkenly, exceedingly chuffed to see his boyfriend.
There was a quiet, higher pitched response that Harry couldn’t quite make out.
“Don’t be ludicrous, Potter,” Fife exclaimed snootily. “Sprites are sentient beings, not beasts! They’re independent contractors, to be sure.”
“I think I just wanted you,” Harry admitted, his words coming quickly while his courage held. “Quite badly, I guess, wanted you close. It must have responded to that. But I don't know. Nothing like that's ever happened before. I mean, a few episodes of accidental magic when I was a kid, but that’s pretty normal, isn’t it?”
“Hm," Draco considered, "This time, try diversion. Might be easier than a pure block. Think of something else entirely,” Draco instructed, “Ready?”
“Fuck,” Harry echoed, then reached out, grabbing Malfoy’s arm, “Wait, Malfoy, stop, I’m sorry. This is, fuck, this is the exact opposite of what I came here to do.”
“More secrets? Are you this blocked-headed on purpose?”
“Hold it a bit longer,” Harry determined.
Harry could scarcely believe Malfoy had managed to get Jamie excited about something the boy would have disdained had Harry suggested it. Harry shot Malfoy a curious look.
“What is it?” asked Draco, returning his gaze to Potter’s with only a slight twinge of reluctance. He found he rather wished to observe the other man at his leisure, social niceties be damned.
“Besides,” Draco observed, “I apparently enjoy surrounding myself with reckless blokes devoid of self-preservation. Although, as a Slytherin, I expected better of you in that regard.”
Jamie laughed. “You’re so insufferable, Ri.”
Okay, so instead of studying I wrote this 5000 word chapter (and the next chapter too, which will be posted hopefully within the week), largely due to who I am as a person.
Harry relaxed again. “Right. Sorry.”
Harry breathed a sigh of relief, “Good,” he remarked, “excellent. I was worried they would spin it.” He skimmed the article which described the event and borrowed quotes from his speech.
“Hello, love,” he smiled tenderly over his shoulder.
“What do you need? A home visit? A character witness? Go call in the Minister of Magic, he’ll vouch for me.”
Begrudgingly, Harry took his seat. He leaned in. “Well?” he hissed.
Harry laughed, and began undressing, “I hope you’ve set some wards.”
Harry didn’t restrain his power this time. He leaped into the boy’s mind quickly and at full force.
“The spell is a little odd in Hogwarts. The castle wards will prevent you from leaving the grounds, and so you will be rerouted to a place of safety within the confines of the wards. It is not a comfortable feeling, bouncing around in an apparition like that, and it is important that you don’t panic, or you’ll end up splinched. First we will discuss feelings of safety, make sure we can all pull up concrete memories of it. Connecting with that emotion is absolutely vital for the spell.”
Most people thought that Scorpius Malfoy was an obedient child. He was always a model student, and yet he seemed exhilarated on nights when he and Al would have their run of the castle, scurrying like mice into all the endless chambers and giggling silently over near-misses. No, Scor was just as much a rule breaker as Al was, only Scor minded when he got caught.
“But you didn’t kill Dumbledore,” Al pointed out. “Snape did, but only because Dumbledore told him he could, because he was, like, a double agent. We read about that.”
“Thank you, Tiering,” Draco acknowledged benevolently. “Very kind of you, I’m sure. Are you alright?”
"Wha—what?" Draco gasped.
“Well, I am a bit,” Harry offered. “I did want to talk to you. Have you seen her then? Lavender?”
“Oh, you and your overreliance on
, it said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes,” Draco agreed, “but it turns out I far prefer to be known for my teaching than for my Dark Mark, so I’ll take it. It’s different for me, though, I know my students. I see them several times a week. The people who approach
“Harry,” Zerk cut into his thoughts, “my intention with the question was not to sow seeds of doubt.”
“Crabapple Cottage,” Draco informed the woman briskly. “Number Six, Greengrocer Lane, Hogsmeade.” The shopkeeper’s eyebrows furrowed. She was obviously trying to sort out why Draco was spouting off Harry’s address like it was his own.  Harry had to bite down on his own lip to keep from smiling like a loon because wasn’t that just Draco’s brand of management?
“Evening, Longbottom,” Malfoy said. Neville looked both shocked and wary.
“That’s my arsehole!” Draco hissed.
“Mm,” Harry agreed, pressing his lips to the hinge of Draco’s jaw. “Is that what the, ah, what was it. Person. In Faering. Who was bothering you.”
Malfoy muttered something into Harry’s shoulder.
A special thanks to the world's greatest beta, Mimbelwimbel, for all her help with this chapter.
Now they were both blushing.
Malfoy licked his lips. “Impact,” he whispered. “I like to be hit, anywhere but my cock and bollocks.” Harry winced inwardly. That was not something he’d ever considered and he was secretly relieved Malfoy wasn’t asking for it.
“Yeah,” Harry gave her a soft smile, “you know how maudlin I get when it comes to Teddy.”
“I don’t know what you are talking about,” Harry ground out between gritted teeth.
“But if you were!”
“You’re endlessly forbearing,” his father commented, returning the watch to Scorpius’ cloak pocket. His hand came to Scorpius’ cheek. “I wasn’t half so stalwart at your age. Nevertheless, I wish you didn’t have to be.”
“Why shouldn’t I?” Harry said earnestly. “You don’t get to choose how the people in your life hurt you. It’s inevitable. You only get to choose how you react. Hell, you taught me that, with how you are with your mum.”
“I’ll speak to Awling this weekend after practice,” Harry determined. “If she can convince the seventh year girls, that’s a decent start.”
“I’m—” Merlin, he didn’t know, “okay,” he offered. He forced himself to look up into the dim of the empty lecture hall. Then he remembered Pansy and Draco and that concerned look, and shifted to face Draco properly, blurting out, “But you, are you okay? What’s happened?”
“Of course, Harry,” Hermione assured him, before Ron had a chance to reply. Harry could hear the concern in her voice, and Merlin, hadn’t he left all that mess behind him? Weren’t the Dursleys ancient history by now? So much had happened that should have clouded over the long years of wondering what was wrong with him, what made him so worthy of their revulsion and spite.
“Yeah, I think I know who you are, Mr. Potter,” she interrupted, giving him a friendly smile, “you’re all anyone around here's been talking about for the last month, since you accepted the invitation. And you’re in
“I just think it’s a bit amusing. All I ever wanted was to be extraordinary. I worked myself to the bone just to earn a professorship and a scant slice of academic renown. And then here
Harry was both shocked and touched. “You all?”
“How’s it on your knee?” He asked Malfoy, as he paused to catch his breath.
“Alright, Potter?” he called out, keeping his voice only pleasant and concerned.
Harry squinted down the hall, to see a dark-skinned, dark-haired figure stumble blearily over to the toilets, probably Dean.
“The way you fuss,” Malfoy said, shaking his head, “honestly. I’m fine. See? Had my wand,” he waved it to demonstrate his point, “would have easily taken a few of those little bastards down.”
Scorpius’ pinched little expression made it clear he intended to argue.
Harry turned to him. He remembered the sickening feeling of Snape shuffling through his memories. It made him queasy. He promised himself to stay superficial, let the boy build up to it.
“You’ve—?”
“So, er, how’s things? What are you up to this year? Still at school or have you finished up?” Dudley asked, after they’d ordered pints.
Draco gave them both a deeply smug smile, and turned on his heels, Harry beside him with a protective palm pressed to the small of his back.
“It’s a relief, actually,” Malfoy admitted, “Almost like being in water.”
“That’s not what I meant!” Harry burst out, barely managing to keep his voice low, “there’s too much bad blood between us, you know that. Why can’t Ron take Malfoy, or Neville?”
“No, no, I know he has,” Harry said tiredly.
“We’re alright,” Harry assured him, though Teddy (and, Harry reminded himself, Draco bloody Malfoy) had more than witnessed that ‘alright’ was almost certainly an overstatement. “We’ll muddle through.”
“No.”
“Well, that was a very straightforward approach,” Hermione said, late that evening as she accepted a mug of tea from Ron. The little kitchenette was one of the perks to the eighth year common room.
“Oh fuck off,” Harry retorted with no heat to his words. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s low back to show that he didn’t fancy the other boy going anywhere at all. He closed his eyes, imagining Draco splayed out before him, imagined fucking into him, their bodies pressed close. His cock gave a flicker of interest.
“Suck it properly,” Harry instructed. “Merlin knows you need pacifying.”
Harry explained the bargain they’d struck.
Neville let out a low whistle, "Merlin, Harry, I'm sorry. What a blow. A good stomp might be just what we need, then, let's.”
Draco gave a shake of his head.
Malfoy only nodded.
“What do you suppose we’re supposed to do?” He wondered. “I’d feel odd just hopping aboard.”
“May I make one request?” Draco asked.
Thanks, everyone, for sticking with me. You continue to be the best.
“Just gotta let passions die down, Harry, is all I’m saying,” he’d insisted.
Draco vomited in an alley beside Clark’s tenement.
“Of course,” Molly said, rising. “Poor dear, can I help? I’ve a pot of tea going. Shall I put on some soup, as well?”
“Might have to reschedule, I’m afraid,” Harry said. “I’d like to find Draco, make sure he’s alright.”
“Not all of us just get to leave school grounds whenever we fancy,” Draco spat, “we’re not all
“No, I wouldn’t think you’d be able to,” Harry agreed. He slid his right hand down, away from Draco’s hand, grazing the blemish with his fingertips. Malfoy didn’t flinch, just watched him. “Can you feel it still?” Harry asked quietly.
“Yes, alright,” Harry agreed, as they reached the common room and he set some water on to boil. “I guess that makes sense. Still makes me feel badly.”
“Holy shit,” he said, letting Draco take it from him. Draco glanced at the page, skimming it quickly, before given Harry a small, knowing smile and raising one eyebrow.
“Nineteen years of commemorative speeches in the Great Hall...all those bright young faces and the place still feels like a graveyard. I’m fine to put on a public front for the kids, for the memorials, and for Teddy’s graduation, but Merlin, I half expect to trip over bodies as I walk the halls. I don’t know how you don’t.”
“Hi, ah, hullo. Oh!” Harry flushed guiltily, reaching out to take one of the bags. “Dinner. Right. Thank you, er, sorry.”
“Hardly think stunning Mrs. Brown and rescuing a whole group of first years is nothing, Potter,” Draco contradicted, “but if you’re feeling obliging, mend my clothes so I don’t have to walk out of here half naked, would you?”
Draco snorted, “A few weeks of mind healing and you’re suddenly cured? I don’t think that’s how this works, Potter.”
“And not a second later,” Draco instructed him, “won’t work, otherwise.”
“We would just...hang out,” Harry explained, and it sounded pathetic, even to him, “Once in a while. Between classes. Be friendly. If you and I can bury the hatchet, or at least just make people think we have...it could do a bit of good.”
Harry stood, shakily, pressing close to Draco. “Fuck,” he said slowly, “I know it was bad, but, you're right, it did feel normal, didn't it? It was what I knew: my spider-infested cupboard, the endless chores and criticism, Vernon’s ready fist. I knew it was shit, but Merlin, I dreaded going back there, I was only a fucking kid. It really was as terrible as all that, wasn’t it?”
“Babe...” Harry murmured, knowing the suggestion of intimacy was a risk. His heart plummeted at Draco’s flinch.
“Shit,” the lanky boy said, “Shit, sorry, I shouldn’t have said anything, you just said I should could back if I wanted to talk and thought maybe I’d better because I get a bit worked up and, well, I was just surprised and it popped out and I’m sorry.”
“No, no,” James shook his head, opening his door. The room behind him was a mess of comic books and old editions of
“So?” Jamie retorted. “Maybe I want to.”
“Excellent,” the woman nodded, taking Lily’s hand and giving it a squeeze. “Nice to see you all!”
Harry grimaced. “Don’t joke about that.”
. And I know providing for us all makes her proud, and it's was what she wanted. But I can’t help but wonder if it’s what she wanted because it was what she was raised to want. Pureblooded witches manage the home. Sure, there are plenty of exceptions, but it’s still
for all her hard work and suggestions! These chapters wouldn't be what they are without her.
,” he repeated, a note of wonder in his voice. “You’ve done a lot to surprise me, Harry, but Merlin, this new friendship of yours really takes the cake.”
“Not…” Harry choked out, “Not
“I know she will,” Ron growled, “you two have a remarkable way of forgiving and forgetting, but then again, you don’t have a brother in the ground.”
The responding chorus of voices didn’t sound particularly confident, but Harry said the password and burst the door open with a spell, keeping his distance from the entrance. They were met with a wall of flames.
“Atwal and Tiering, those are two of your chasers, aren’t they?” Brocklehurst asked him, as they traipsed past the courtyard towards the east wing exit. Harry had admittedly been avoiding her, as rumour had come out a couple weeks ago that she had been offered a spot as a reserve beater for the Appleby Arrows. He’d been jealous, likely still was, and he wasn’t convinced he could successfully mask it. He was too distracted to really feel his jealousy currently, however.
“Right, because it wouldn’t,” Ron elaborated, “I’m maybe not used to it exactly, but I’m adjusting—I’ve adjusted, I think. With Dean and Seamus, I—I actually think it’s kind of nice, sweet, innit? Because we’ve known them so long and they’ve always been attached at the hip and they seem to really care for each other.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at the diminutive, feigning peevishness. “Enough kissing,” he groused sourly. “I want to fuck.”
“Even after the war, after the trials, and Harry here being gracious enough to spare me from Azkaban, I still clung to the hope that things could just go back to normal. That your father would come home and we would continue our lives as before. The path of least resistance has always appealed to me. But since you’ve been away...I’ve had a lot of lonely hours to think and what I’ve realised is that I don’t want to go back. I
. I saw a mind healer for a bit. She said it was just survivor’s guilt, perfectly natural. I know those who died went into battle with their eyes wide open, that they believed in a cause, that it was that they were dying for, not just to protect me. I need reminding of that from time to time. Being at Hogwarts...makes it harder.”
“Oh, sweetheart, I’m so sorry,” Harry said, very earnestly, feeling guilty. He crouched down so they were eye level, reaching out to pet Draco’s hair, “I'm really sorry, babe, I should have asked. What do you want to do? Should we stop?”
Draco didn’t suppose he should focus on the idea of Potter’s insatiability when it came to Draco, but he lingered there for a moment anyway, flashing the other man a smug smile.
Harry considered that. “When I was a kid, Draco was always accusing me of receiving special treatment. It chafed at Ron a bit, too. I used to get so mad, because it didn’t feel like I was getting special treatment, but in retrospect, I suppose it was. It just was rarely as welcome as they seemed to think.”
That, apparently, was not on. He’d not heard the footsteps, but he looked up from where he was slouched on a sofa to see Draco standing over him, hands on his hips and glowering. Behind him were the flushed and uncomfortable faces of Ernie MacMillan and Michael Corner. They’d obviously had to rush to keep up with the furious Draco and weren’t keen to now be witnessing a domestic.
He set up Hops with the two first years, and the gracious Hufflepuff led them on a little tour of the grounds. Harry was impressed to see how graceful Fitz was on the broom, his hulking form perfectly at ease, perched on his Comet 300. Harry could make out the words, but the boy’s booming voice seemed encouraging as he eased the younger students into a couple of loops and slow turns.
“For me?” Draco considered, “no. I just thought you might not wish to be seen as a concerned yet possessive terrier in the eyes of every individual attending this fine institution.”
“Daddy! Is Remy alright?” Lily exclaimed, as Hermione issued a similar greeting.
“Yeah,” Harry said. “And he knows I’m with Draco and all that.”
“Hardly,” Harry said, “not even a team name, but I was thinking it would be good to know how to complete the charm for when we do. Give them a little sense of unity. ”
“I know you don’t like platitudes, but it’s going to be alright, sweetheart,” Harry promises. “We’ll do every last thing we can think of to make it as alright as possible. I don’t want you to have to carry all this any more, and certainly not by yourself.”
“I wish they did,” Zerk said, sounding very much like he meant it. “And for the record, there is nothing, nor was there anything, wrong with you. Your aunt and uncle were fully to blame in this situation. You were dependent on them, and they abused that dynamic in every way imaginable. They hurt you, Harry. You did nothing to deserve it. And nothing you could have done would have lessened it. I say this only because it’s common for survivors of abuse to fall into those ways of thinking: 'If only I’d behaved better' or 'if only I’d been quicker or more clever.' Do you find that happens to you?”
Harry stroked Draco’s hair quietly for a long time, trying to figure out how to say what he needed to say. “I love you,” he started. “But I can’t abide deception and manipulations like that again, Draco. Whatever your motivations, however buttoned up you think you can keep them, I’ll walk.” He swallowed, hating the prospect of it. He needed to make the other boy understand. “I...Well, I know I don't have to tell you how miserable it is to have Voldemort in your head. I know you withstood that enough times yourself. With me it was a bit different, though. Because of our bond, he could project things from anywhere. I got memories at first and then fabrications when he realised the extent of it. It was a fabrication that brought me to the Department of Mysteries the night Sirius died. He was murdered because of my thoughtlessness, because I foolishly trusted my own eyes. I do run into things, just like you say. It doesn’t work out as well as I always hope it might and I need to do better, I know that. But if I can’t believe what I see in my own damn brain, and I also can’t trust the people I love, then what do I fucking have?”
Floriandra nodded her approval, the great powdered wig wobbling precariously. She turned and pushed the caddy out into the hall. Draco listened for the snick of the closing door.
“Gryffindors,” Draco lamented, but Harry thought he looked just a little pleased.
“You broke a rule,” Harry explained. “No mean names. Not from me, not from you. Is that understood?”
Draco passed him his teacup and Harry set it down on a loose tile, Draco sliding deeper in the tub with a sigh. He let his head dip under for a moment, and when he emerged, Harry poured some shampoo to his palms and ran his hands through Draco's hair. He took his time, fingers coursing over the now-familiar curves of Draco’s skull.
Jamie pulled back, swiping at his eyes and nose with the back of his arm. “No,” he muttered, “to school.”
“Thank you, Luna,” Ginny said assertively, as the ghosts hovered politely along the walls of the classroom under the observant eyes of the DA. “Now, as Hermione said, we are expecting to be on alert from sunrise tomorrow until sunrise the following day. You all have your Slytherin buddies? They have, to date, been the typical targets. You will not leave their side during this time, is that understood? If you see something, or hear something, or your Slytherin compatriot says a voice has popped into their heads, send your Patronus for one of us, the headmistress, or another teacher immediately. If you don’t have a Patronus, send a runner, and head for the great hall, where one of us will be situated the whole time. Do
Pansy’s expression softened. “Are you alright?”
“Merlin’s teeth,” Zerk chuckled, shaking his head, “Alright then. What is the crux of it?”
“I know, baby,” Draco said. “But I won’t fuck this up.”
“Mm,” Draco confirmed, “My boyfriend: saviour, philanthropist, athlete. Desired by all, in my bed every night. I can live with that quite comfortably.”
“How’s it feel to sell your soul for a fuck?” Cried another.
The silence grew.
Harry looked saddened for a moment, as though the thought of his children growing up was physically painful to him. Then he just smiled. “Sorry, love. Have I missed the show?”
taking care of him.”
“I don’t just want to,” Al insisted. “I think it was working.”
“Okay, well, it gets worse and worse until the prophecy begins. And right when it does, I could do the
Harry suddenly very much regretted his actions. He was now faced with the very pleasant prospect of Malfoy’s arse and an inability to know what to do with
Draco didn’t think he particularly would, but he doubted that was the response the girl wanted to hear. Luckily, he wasn’t required to reply, because Lily approached of her own accord and flipped it open. A man who looked a lot like Potter peered out from one side with a friendly wave. A woman Draco assumed to be Potter’s mother smiled warmly from the other.
Scorpius gave him a doleful look that said he didn’t wish to discuss it further. “I’ll ask Father. It doesn’t matter, though. I ought to stop whinging.”
"No," Harry replied. "I believe that you already are."
Draco nodded curtly, then glanced quickly at Scorpius. “Is there somewhere else we could discuss this?”
“What was working?” Harry asked. He was surprised the words, but then children were often skilled at convincing themselves of all sorts of nonsense.
“She feels somehow unstable, desperate,” Harry observed, “she doesn’t have a concrete plan. She’s like a hurt animal, just lashing out in whatever way she can.”
Harry shook his head as if coming out of a daze. His spell broke and Ron crashed to the ground where he remained: slumped groaning against the wall. Harry didn't register the response, his focus fixed solely on Draco and the small, screaming bundle to which he clung.
“Sorry,” Potter said. “He’s persistent.”
Draco had to admit he was surprised. Surely Scorpius could see the situation for what it was. “I said perhaps that would be an option, but darling, you must know that it is hardly appropriate after this morning. Potter would never allow it, and what’s more, I’m not all that pleased with the boy myself, nor particularly with you for allowing him to influence you so. But you’ve had enough excitement for one day, so we can discuss this more tomorrow. Would you like a rest, or do you want to help me with some work in the garden?”
Harry grabbed Hermione’s satchel and started rifling through it.
Ron’s expression changed from horror to anger, “A little club that took on the Death Eaters you brought into our school, you ungrateful git!”
“I don’t know, ‘Mione,” he sighed, “Couldn’t we just go to the Leaky Cauldron or something?”
“What were you even doing there?” Malfoy demanded, once the two were out of earshot of the infirmary, “you better not be back to your old stalking habits, Potter, so help me.”
“Maybe. What does it matter, though? Learning to take a compliment isn't going to change The Arrows' minds.”
“But you didn’t even like Voldemort any more!” Jamie objected. “You said you’d realised he was in the wrong!”
“I’ll take your word for it,” Malfoy groaned from behind his hands. “Fucking hell you have bony fingers. Hurts.”
not be pleased with this ridiculous quarrel, but he couldn’t help himself. The Weasel was being just an irritating, petty fool, determined to misjudge Draco’s intentions. Well, Draco wouldn’t stand for being defamed like this, not when he’d not done a bloody thing to deserve it in two long decades.
“What about you two?” Draco asked in return.
. What the fuck were you thinking being so careless?”
“More of an aubergine, I’d say,” Fitz corrected.
Harry gave him a rueful smile. “You’re terribly good at it, is it the thing. If I wasn’t so damn stressed about it all, I might have taken a moment to appreciate it. The whole bloody pantomime with Remy? You got under Ron’s skin like you did it for a living.”
“Oh?”
so they wouldn’t be overheard should anyone else appear in the dormitory.
Draco huffed, “Fine.”
“Thank you,” he said, “this looks lovely.”
“How dare she stick up for him!” Draco burst out once Harry reached his side, “After everything he did, I’m just supposed to ingratiate myself, and what? Forgive him? I won’t. I can’t. I despise him and everything he represents.” They reached the train tracks and crossed them, Draco’s long legs striding towards the pond beyond the station. The autumn wind was disturbing the usually placid surface, little white crests were rising and falling. It was not a pleasant day; there was no one around. Draco stood facing the water, jaw clenched tight.
“Dad, can we be excused so we can get back to skittles?” Jamie inquired. “No offense, but this is seriously dull, and I’m afraid the charm on the pins is going to wear off and you'll be too busy
“Not this! You can’t just leave her trapped in a tie clip for all eternity! Isn’t that just creating some sort of genie situation? And then two hundred years from now, some poor blighter finds it and she’s released and brings down fire and brimstone on all of civilization?”
Headmistress Clearwater ushered the two seventh-years off the platform, and suddenly, all the Quidditch lights, the bright baubles on around the stalls, the torches lighting the footpaths, the faerie lights twinkling in the fields, everything went absolutely black.
“Sorry, Dad,” he murmured.
Narcissa’s upper lip twitched in distaste at the mention of Gladrags and Harry almost laughed with nervous relief. Some things didn't change, at least.
Hey folks, thanks for reading and for the wonderful comments left on the previous chapter. I'm really stoked that you're all enjoying this fic alongside me!
Harry thought, and it sounded more like Draco’s voice than his own,
“How do you think up all this?” Harry asked.
Harry chuckled. “Nothing would surprise me less. You can be the public face of all this. I’ll be brooding in the background.”
“Thought we’d actually get Tuesday nights to ourselves again,” Draco grumbled as he and Harry arrived in the dungeon classroom that evening.
Classes were canceled for the day and Harry scrubbed the ash and soot off in the shower before collapsing into Draco’s bed. Draco joined him shortly after, smelling like fresh grapefruit and his wet hair tickling Harry’s nose. Harry smoothed it down with a lazy hand.
Harry coughed out a dry chuckle, “No brain damage, then, that’s a relief. How are you feeling, love, are you alright?”
“Of course it bloody does,” Harry muttered. “Fucking hell, we should have left you in that damn tie clip.”
“Of course not,” Al retorted. “You know my dad, he’d literally die rather than say he loved one of his kids more than the other. I just...well, I get in trouble a lot, don’t I? Not on purpose or anything, it just seems to happen and then all this attention that Jamie wants and I don’t really want nevertheless gets heaped on me, and Jamie thinks it’s because I’m special, when actually it’s because I’m odd.”
“You just look more well-rested than usual.”
“So what? Would I get loads of visitors and attention if I misbehaved, instead of minding my own business?” Harry doubted that Myrtle had even once minded her own business.
Draco shook his head. “I inferred I would be gathering herbs at certain hours and that I would return in the morning. Scorpius’ Aunt Daphne was happy enough to spend the night.”
To Jamie’s relief, the professor didn’t dismiss him. “That’s an excellent question,” he began, instead. “And gets into some of the finer points of Dark Magic.”
“Yeah,” Clark agreed, “To see my mum and brother. Mum hasn’t exactly been in touch; she can’t adjust to the owl post thing, I don’t think.”
“Okay,” Harry agreed, solemnly, "you're right. Tomorrow. I promise, Hermione, tomorrow.”
Harry woke up alone the next with a sick, sinking feeling in his gut. Draco had been clingy all evening and throughout the night, refusing to let Harry out of his sight for more than a few minutes, but also refusing to tell him anything more, either. Harry had let the tangible press of the other boy’s back into his chest soothe him. There was nothing to soothe him, now. He sat up and caught sight of a scrap of parchment on the pillow in front of him. Draco’s typically precise script looked uneven and smeared.
“Well, out with it,” Harry said. “What’s got you so stern?”
It took him ages to get back to the table he and Malfoy had been seated at. He’d could have sworn he’d remembered where it was, but when he reached the spot, there was only darkness. And then a shadow moved, and Harry realised that he was in the right place, only a figure was blocking the candlelight, and that figure was
Harry mounted his
“It was chaos,” Draco agreed.
“Er, hi?” The kid looked mortified—Harry felt vindicated, he was embarrassing!
“Why not?” Harry demanded.
Everyone turned to Harry.
Harry was surprised to realise he was quite touched by the little note. He hadn’t a clue what he and Dudley would say over drinks, but he thought it was pretty decent of his cousin to reach out at all. He tucked the card into his back pocket then pulled up a chair beside Ron.
Draco held up his empty hands, “Never. My mother said it rots muggles’ brains.”
Draco groaned. “Whatever possessed me to be so frank with you, I’ll never know. Certainly some of my weaker moments.”
“I took Draco by the hand,” Harry sighed, “on the stairs. She saw.”
“It's that Weasley girl, isn't it? I hear the gossip sometimes, you know. It was all anyone was on about at the end of last year. When I heard the news, I curled up in my cistern and I've barely shown my face since, because it's simply not fair. Boys always prefer living girls, or pretty girls like Olive Hornby or Ginerva Weasley.” A fresh wave of tears swam in her silvery eyes, magnified by her glasses.
“Mm,” Harry agreed, “I was your age and we were both getting fitted for school robes.”
With a shaky laugh, Harry looked at Draco, who leaped at him, legs wrapped tight around Harry’s waist, fingers twisted in his hair, mouth fastening over Harry’s bottom lip. Harry slammed Draco against a wall, cradling his arse.
“I get by,” Harry bristled.
she grumbled.
. They’d spent some time fooling around and Harry was feeling that warm, sleepy satisfaction that seemed to come with winding Draco up and letting him release. Getting off himself didn't hurt, either. He was naked and sprawled out on his belly, propped up on his elbows. Draco in a similar posture beside him. They were scouring the Marauders’ Map for any sign of the Browns. Professor McGonagall had offered to sort out a way for Draco to finish his education via post, if he was feeling too unsafe at school.
“Oh, you must have loved that,” Pansy grinned, clasping her hands in front of her chest like some sort of villain in a fairy story.
just as Ron’s
"Like dealing with a pompous ass?"
“Harry!” Ron, drunk and giddy, beamed at him, smacking him on the back, “I’m just destroying this great thundering dolt at snap.”
“It’s a library,” Scorpius pointed out. “I thought I’d find a book. Why, what are
Draco couldn’t follow the boy’s story at all. He didn’t know why Scorpius thought whatever ghastly abomination George Weasley had cooked up would incite an episode. Unfortunately, the boy slid back into sleep without further clarification.
Draco sighed and placed his mug on the coffee table, before rising and taking Clark’s from him to do the same.
“Again,” demanded Malfoy.
“I’ve a couple of hangover potions in my trunk, I can grab you one.”
“It’s fine,” Jamie muttered quietly, not looking at her. He looked around to make sure no one was paying attention to them, and shifted his gaze to Ri. “My folks split up, is all.”
Rose sniffed but allowed herself to be led towards the kitchen. “It was nobody’s fault, Mummy. I was just climbing the fence, but only because Hugo threw a ball over it on purpose, and then I slipped over the top and I…”
“Knowing I’ve got, you know, a future.”
Harry shook his head. “I kept things to myself on purpose. You were my friends, I didn’t want you to look at me differently; I was terrified of your pity. None of this is your fault, Ron—”
Ron and Ginny’s candidness seemed to relax everyone and the rest of the lunch was not just bearable, but actually pleasant. When it came time for Draco to leave, he hugged Mrs. Weasley fully, thanking her graciously, and he kissed Harry squarely on the mouth as if it were the most normal thing in the world. He threw a handful of Floo, stepped into the fire, and said “Malfoy Manor.” With that, he was gone.
“Came to find you, didn’t I?” Retorted Malfoy, “Sneaking off alone like you’re on some classified mission.”
“It’s a very thoughtful gift,” Hermione reflected, “shows he knows how much you worry. Do try to be a bit more subtle, about it, though, Harry. Checking it like that only draws attention.”
“How do you know?” he redirected.
“I can’t believe I didn’t notice some reporter just following us around. And the post, it is going to be out of control.”
Harry grinned ruefully, “Don’t I know it.”
Harry licked his lips, not understanding. It was clear, however, that Malfoy was not going to elucidate the issue. “I saw them playing at something like that in the garden,” he admitted, “but Scorpius seemed fine. Truly, Malfoy, I had no idea they were up to anything so thoughtless. My kids always have some odd game or another on the go. No one seemed fussed, or I would have intervened at once.”
“I think I know the one,” Ron remarked with forced casualness, him and Harry giving Hermione a knowing look, then grinning as the blush rose high on her cheeks.
Ginny nodded, “Yeah, I think you did. I mean, I understand, Mum is amazing, everyone wants a Mum like mine.”
Draco was leaning against the desk, sucking on a toffee, considering them. Harry couldn’t quite discern the his expression.
In the dorm, Draco stood despondent, and allowed a not exactly sober and coordinated Harry to undress him down to his underclothes. Then they climbed inside the curtains and Harry cast the silencing spell. Harry insisted on completing Malfoy's knee exercises and then they just lay there for a moment, silent.
“Have I flustered you, Potter?” And curse the man if he didn’t sound amused.
“You’ve done more than enough already,” Clark replied, stiffly. He was pink-faced and on the edge of tears. “I’ll be fine, don’t worry about it.”
“Unsurprisingly, the Hogwarts Defence Against the Dark Arts professorship has become available, as it does every year. I understand they have offered you the position before. This year, I believe they intend to extend a more lucrative offer—one that you might have difficulty refusing.”
Draco gave him a slow, secret smile that made Harry feel a bit bubbly and a lot besotted.
Harry couldn’t help but chuckle as he took another sip. Draco was so incorrigible and self-satisfied, but it was all a bit of fun, and Harry really did find him appealing, very much so.

“You remember what to say?”
“See?” Gibbens continued, “You’re not even denying it!”
"Fuck. That's reprehensible. I'm so sorry, sweetheart."
“Did you never think to leave the country? Start fresh?” Harry didn’t know where this forthrightness was coming from, this sudden impulse to ask these probing questions. But Draco never seemed to mind. Quite the opposite, it was as though he preferred to address difficult things head on, to examine them without flinching.
Harry couldn’t help but keep a vice grip on the boy’s arm, preventing him from leaning too far out of the speeding cart. He wasn't sure if it was the unbreakable vow or just his own conscience motivating the action, but either way, he wasn't letting go.
“You realise every student at Hogwarts knows more about you than your own children do? And with you wandering the halls, your past is going to come up more. How exactly do you think that is going to make Al and James feel?” Draco was frustrated now. He knew Harry’s intentions were sound, but the fallout could be socially devastating.
love in conversation, before now.
“Oi, Harry,” called out Ron, he was sitting with Dean at a table. The two had mugs of tea. Tea sounded good.
“So you have two completely useless birds in your life. Charming.”
“You weren’t the only one he disfigured,” Ron pointed out.
Harry didn’t like the sounds of that one bit.
It hurt. Harry let it.
didn’t, but I wanted to ensure Tiering’s lessons continued until his skills were complete.”
Harry laughed. “Survive this and soon you can only work with the unconscious ones.”
“What more could you possibly hope for on a day off?” Harry asked and Ron snorted amiably.
“The middle of the drawing room carpet is hardly the place for your trainers, Albus!” Harry said, cringing at his harsh tone. He needed to rein in his damn temper. He tried to remember how the hell he was supposed to switch off the wards’ incessant chiming. He haphazardly tried the spell he thought it might be.
nice."
“It’s a disaster, and why on earth do you defer to your house elf like that? It's embarrassing,” Draco informed him, stripping down to his pants. He was neatly folding his clothes and placing them into his trunk. It felt oddly intimate to get to observe Draco’s routine, without a dozen plus other boys around them—a little awkward perhaps, getting used to each other in this new space, but Harry savoured it.
“She can’t help it,” Clark fired back.
Draco cast his eyes skyward in a gesture that said Harry was clearly failing at holding up his end of the performance.
“Suppose so. Pass me the potatoes would you?” Clark asked.
“No one ruined Christmas, love,” Harry protests. “We all had a wonderful morning, didn’t we? And it was a nice visit with the Weasleys. No one is judging your mum for having a sherry or two more than she’d planned. We’ve all done that, believe me. And I know you’re worried about what’s to come, but will help in whatever way we can, I promise. If she needs us to take Jared for a while, we’ll make it work. We always will.”
Harry threaded a hand through Draco’s hair, pulling back on it to slow the rapid kisses, taking over, and the enjoying the approving moan that came as he did so.
“My parental figures have an unfortunate habit of dying young,” Harry told him.
“A lot of talk and not a lot of action, Potter,” Draco pointed out.
“I don’t know, exactly, Headmistress,” Hermione acknowledged, “but Ron, Harry, Malfoy and myself were giving a dueling demonstration. Ron had just disarmed Harry when suddenly she cast the
“That’s absurd,” Al said. “Where would magic go? And besides, I know how to wipe off a table. You only need to do it once to know how to do that.”
? Jamie wondered. It was clear that some discussion had occurred between the two. Scorpius must have advocated for Al and Jamie to arrive at a truce of sorts.
“Are you sick?” Clark asked.
“Merlin, you don’t pull your punches!” Harry accused, shocked but amused.
“No, I’d far rather eat alone,” Draco replied smoothly.
“Lily Potter,” she informed him officiously.
“I should like to offer an apology, Madam Malkin, for my and my mother’s behaviour two years ago. I’ve no intention of repeating such egregious sentiments. I understand, however, if you do not wish for my patronage.”
Despite Harry's best efforts, the issue was still not dropped. On Thursday came a note from his and Draco’s publicist.
“I unfortunately was one of those people. Probably another reason your uncle Ron and I aren’t on the best of terms.”
“No,” Jamie declared, much too quickly.
Harry got the feeling he was the first man to hear these confessions spoken aloud, and he felt strangely privileged.
“I’ve a bit of a confession,” Harry said to the keen faces before him. “This meeting rather crept up on me and I’ve not really prepared a speech, per se. Also, I’d hate to retread ground that's already been covered by your lecture series, so perhaps we could make this more of a question and answer period?”
“It’s host,” Al corrected her. “Boys are hosts, girls are hostesses.”
Harry’s hand flew out almost before he knew he was doing it, gripping Draco by his pale, elegant throat. Not tight enough to hurt, not really, but enough to show he was serious. Draco gasped and his eyes flew wide with desire, lips parting.
“Hit me again, Potter, or I swear I’ll—”
“I—No,” Scorpius gave a jerk of his head. Harry was quite certain it was a lie. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to be a bother.”
“What are you going to do?” Harry asked simply.
“Yes,” Draco replied. “I assumed.” Because he had realised that, really, after that first millisecond. Why was he acting like this, all nervy and erratic? It was hardly dignified behaviour. He quickly performed the spell himself before reclasping his hands—in his lap, this time.
Malfoy glowered, “Oh, I’m
Harry spotted the bag on the other side of the sofa, and slung it over one shoulder. He scooped up Remy, who made an unhappy noise at being taken away from his toy. Harry stepped towards the fireplace, only to remember it was the lack of Floo powder that had caused his current quagmire in the first place. It was then that he noticed his coin pouch on the mantle, beside where the Floo powder was normally housed. He knew he’d not put it there, in fact, he’d not seen the bag at all since he—since he gave it to Malfoy.
!” Claire gasped, affronted, then, she whirled around and stalked off, friends in tow.
Harry was dubious, but he followed the instructions, squeezing his eyes shut and focusing on the slender bone beneath the pad of Draco’s fingerprint. It was as though his magic was scanning along it, millimetre by millimetre, distal to proximal, like Madam Pomfrey said. And all at once, he felt it dip, like an unseen pothole on a freshly paved road.
“I know.” Harry told him. He wanted to let himself drift off, but the room stunk of sex and he couldn't help but miss the ugly little room they usually shared. “Let’s not stay in here, though, love. I'll run us a shower, how about? And I’ll ask Kreacher to make a nice supper and we'll have an early night. And tomorrow, we'll sort out the rest of the damned world. Trust me on that?”
reanimated corpse. I mean, he’s not Harry’s corpse, not like that, eurgh. I just meant that he’ll be obliged to take pity on me.” Ron paused and stretched his neck from side to side, finishing off his last sip of whisky. He extended his neck so that the crown of his head was pressed against the supportive back cushion of the sofa, and looked up at Draco assessingly. “Think I might be a bit sloshed," he noted mildly. Then, jaw dropping and with an accusatory finger leveled at Draco, he exclaimed, "Hey! You do know which Weasley I am!”
Harry smiled to himself.
“Not at all,” Harry replied, “Just am not repeating this story again until I’ve had some sleep.”
“Ira,” Draco repeated, “can only be so many places at once. Nothing happened and I’m sure there will not be a recurrence. Let’s enjoy our meal, what do you say, love?”
“Worth the risk.”
In the end, Harry decided to just leave it. He’d likely see the girl in the summer, should he meet up with Dudley again, and by that time, he expected his anger would have faded. He’d rather just forget the whole thing ever happened.
“I’m sorry, love,” Harry murmured, and Scorpius’s heart leapt to his throat as the shoe finally dropped, with a total, astounding clarity. “Whatever you decide, I’ll support you, you know that, don’t you?”
“Yes, alright,” Scorpius agreed. He should get back to his Charms assignment, but helping Jamie investigate a decades old mystery seemed like it would be a lot more fun.

A witch in the same black uniform awaited them, helping them out of the boat one by one, and then the couples were led to their respective tables.
Ron poured them both a final glass, “Cheers, mate. To family.”
“Get your hand off him,” Harry demanded. Malfoy looked down, confused, at where he held his son’s arm. He pulled his hand away abruptly. He faced Harry fully now, a storm brewing in his grey eyes. “You can take him home when you have calmed down,” Harry informed him.
The utter backhandedness of the compliment only amused Harry further. “Good to know you slightly prefer my company to abject solitude.”
Dean finished up, washed his hands, gave his face a quick scrub and left.
“Oh, of-of course, Ha—um, yes?” for a moment, it sounded like he was trying to say Harry’s name but he chickened out at the last moment.
bed,” Fife pointed out.
Harry sat gingerly on the side of his son's bed. He reached out, placing his palm between Jamie’s shoulder blades, fully expecting to be shrugged off. The gesture didn’t come.
“Ri is acceptable,” Januarius decided. “So long as it’s not Jan. I should have known my full name would be too many letters for Fort’s measly peabrain.”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked.
“As Master wishes.”
Ron, and Hermione appeared at the door, breathless and concerned.
He inspected Scorpius briefly, sweeping the fine silver-gold bangs away from his son’s eyes and spelling them loosely in place. He’d suggest a haircut this weekend, though Scorpius seemed to prefer hiding behind his fringe. Scorpius didn’t talk back while Draco fussed with the boy’s collar until it lay flat, though he could see frustration in the pursing of the child’s chapped lips.
Draco scoffed from behind him.
“If the kid isn’t interested, he isn’t interested, don’t push it,” Malfoy had sighed, over a bowl of stew at lunch, “You know you don’t have to individually save
But she didn’t. With a final anguished cry, she was gone, leaving only the brocade chair sitting benignly in her frame.
Draco didn’t say anything. He wasn’t sure he could. Harry’s words sat heavy on his chest; they were difficult to absorb. It was so like Harry, never leaving things as they were, always pushing. Why couldn’t the man leave well enough alone? Things had been working as they were. But of course Harry wanted more, why wouldn’t he?
They were just about to turn down the corridor when Jamie caught sight of a familiar bright blond head. The scene from the evening prior came unbidden to Jamie’s mind and he winced. It must have been a pretty rotten ordeal for the poor kid.
“Why don’t you tell me what exactly you were hoping for?” Harry offered beneficently. “Ask nicely. I’m sure we can find some common ground.”
“Absolutely not, don’t you dare fucking stop.” Harry returned his teeth to Malfoy’s skin, and listened to words continue to spill from the other boy’s lips, “Please, fuck me up, a bit, I can handle it, I want to handle it, Harry, please.”
“Harry, that’s brilliant,” Hermione beamed.
“I’ve Arithmancy this morning, and you’re carrying my books,” Malfoy replied.
“Alright,” James considered. “So you would know, then. Was it luck that brought him through the war?”
“It...certainly seems effective,” Draco conceded, still flabbergasted by the potency. “And it doesn’t come back? Not even traces of it?”
“What?” Harry said, not following
Teddy waved him off. “Later,” he promised. Even Teddy looked tired, strands of long hair having fallen loose from his bun. Nevertheless, he gave Harry a weak smile. “We’re fine. Everyone’s just a bit stirred up, you know how it is.”
“You seemed upset earlier, with your brother,” Harry pointed out, trying his best not to cast any aspersions.
“Can you tell me what you remember?” She asked.
And Clark thought it might, just sleeping here beside his brother, bookended by Harry and Draco. Besides, it was a big bed.
“Merlin,” Harry startled, “No, I haven’t! Thanks, Neville.” He summoned his, and the stag stamped impatiently while Harry conveyed it’s message: “Clark, we’re looking for you. Please head to the great hall as soon as you get this.”
The words hung in the air between them and Harry wondered if he ought to step in. He didn’t know the content of all that had been exchanged between the other two men, but he’d seen Ron be nothing short of vicious when his temper was unleashed. Draco’s face remained stony and aloof for a tense moment, but then he shifted back towards Harry, as if deciding upon something.
Draco stood, leaning over the girl to take the baby from Potter’s lap. “Why don’t you finish up reading it to me and Remus?”
“School work! On Easter Sunday! You know you’re not actually my dad, right?” Clark challenged.
“Did you not prepare at all?” Malfoy demanded, as Harry scanned the ingredient list.
The twins’ conversation turned at once to a familiar, exuberant repartee about just who would be kicking whose arse.
Harry re-positioned slightly and Draco gave a sharp inhale.
“Yeah,” Potter told her. “He’s not feeling well, so no harm in letting him crash with Al one more night.”
“MY OWN GREAT NEPHEW A CATAMITE BLOOD TRAITOR!”
Thanks to everyone for reading and commenting. I read them all six times over (at least) and still grin like an utter goof when I get AO3 emails!
“Er…” Harry replied. He’d not given a single thought about whether Tanya was good enough for Dudley. He’d certainly not considered the idea of his cousin valuing his opinion on, well, anything.
“Well, glad you’ve got your future well in hand,” Draco permitted.
The flat was neat enough, if run-down, but it was also quiet. Harry examined the peeling linoleum and chipped walls. Dusty drapes failed to completely obscure the streetlights. Draco poked around the kitchen scowling at small appliances while Clark checked the bedrooms. He came out shaking his head.
“Flex your foot!” More insistent this time, “It will relieve the cramp, Malfoy, just do it.”
Thanks everyone for your super kind comments, it feels so wonderful to have folks be earnestly engaged with the story, I feel so lucky!
“People like love stories, and they are amenable to them at this time of year,” Hermione reinforced.
The puppy, as it happened, was in the sitting room, staring out a grubby window.
“It’s a bit stupid, isn’t it,” Harry remarked, “I mean, I should probably be dealing with the shit that causes the nightmares and the, whatever they were, flashbacks. And yet instead I’m all worried over an outrageous article in the world’s worst paper."
Draco, Harry had to concede, had done a good job. Ron looked quite smart in a navy jumper over an understated dress shirt and grey trousers the following evening. Harry was starting to wonder if it was less the clothing and more the fit that made an outfit. He was more than happy to just let Draco keep making decisions on that front, however. He didn’t think he was interested enough to learn all the nuances.
Understanding clicked into place, Malfoy must have forgotten about it until he went to depart this morning. Harry stepped closer to pick it up. It was then that he realised the Floo powder had also been replenished. Tucked beneath the small sack was a folded bit of parchment.
“If I’d pulled something like that, I’d be grounded for the rest of the summer.”
There was no trace of the evening’s manipulation this time. Al was genuinely upset, Harry knew.
“Yes,” Malfoy agreed eagerly. “If you don’t leave marks where others can see them.”
“Well," Shacklebolt offered, "I’m happy to say that no, we were most certainly not involved. I’m hardly keen to lead wizarding Britain into any more wars just now.”
“You’re nothing but Lucius Malfoy’s puppet,” she insisted.
McGonagall blinked.
It was not, Harry noticed, a no.
He spotted the two Slytherin first years huddled together outside the brick shed, looking nervous. They were quite the pair: long, gangly-limbed Clark and puny, big-eyed Hiram. Clark looked uncomfortable in his piecemeal athletic gear, Harry suspected this was not his usual crowd. Not that Clark seemed to have a usual crowd.
“Er…” Harry replied, when it became clear no one else would. “I mean, we didn’t not tell you on purpose. We just didn’t think of it, or at least I didn’t.”
Before she could comment further, Hermione and Pansy arrived with the headmistress, and the DADA professor departed.
“You can’t break up,” Clark insisted, chin up so he could glare into Harry’s eyes.
Scorpius looked to be in some sort of personal agony, catching his lower lip between his teeth, and making a plaintive, helpless sound. Finally, he shook his head as if determinedly  dismissing a thought. “It just does,” he informed Jamie firmly. “You’re both crap to be around when you’re fighting. I don’t like it. I know you’re going through it with your mum but guess what, I went through something with my mum, too, and I manage not to be a complete beast, so maybe you two could find a different way of coping!”
“Get out,” Harry growled. “He was holding my
Despite himself, Harry felt his eyes grow a little teary. Must be the Firewhiskey.
. There was not a thought in my mind of you defeating him, and so I desperately dreamed maybe we could just go some place new and start fresh, somewhere we’d never be found. I’d hoped we’d grow to be friends, maybe, or at least we’d no longer be adversaries.”
“Bastard,” Draco grumbled.
Can I just say that you are all just the absolute best?? I having wanted to write an eighth fic for ages and ages but it felt way too intimidating because the fandom is so so huge and I've read so many wonderful stories. Not to mention I haven't read the books for years so I'm completely dependent on the wiki (bless wiki writers, seriously). I was really nervous about actually putting this out into the world because it will never be as good as I want to be, and all I notice are the shortcomings. You've no idea how much I appreciate y'all showing up and encouraging me and saying kind things and noticing things and I JUST CAN'T, you are so so so nice. Thank you thank you thank you for spoiling me with comments! ❤❤❤
