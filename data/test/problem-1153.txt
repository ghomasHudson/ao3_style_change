there’s only the one,” Shacklebolt grossed, “how could you not remember? Fine, fetch his file then.”
Neville nodded. “Yeah, nothing involving Harry is ever easy. I know George.” He took George’s arm and squeezed it, “I-We got this mate.”
“My roommate had a nightmare last night and she kind-a blew up her bed with accidental magic. It really scared me.”
“How are they treating you,” Hermione paused, looked to Draco and finished, “both?” They looked so healthy and happy, but she wasn’t sure if that was due to finding each other or in some part due to where they were.
Harry didn’t know what he’d expected but with very little fanfare and a couple of signatures. He was a few unwanted and unneeded titles richer, even wealthier, and the owner of a gaudy ring. He turned it over in his hand before Draco nimbly nabbed it from his fingers.
“Mum?” Ron had seen his mum cry entirely too much recently and if she was crying over what Ron suspected, he was going to break Malfoy’s nose. He rubbed her shoulder, “it’s not true mum. Malfoy’s parents gave him everything.”
Draco reached up and touched where they rested, having forgotten they were there. He glanced towards Harry and took them off, looking at them, “sunglasses.”
“Well you see Mr. Weasley,” Kade simpered, across the waiting room table. They were waiting for Hermione to be brought in to confer on their next move. “It’s not as easy as one might think. While, as you know, we the Ministry have of course exonerated Ms. Granger, the Australian government may choose to ignore our judgement.”
He’d spoken up for Narcissa but by the time the solicitors and Narcissa had finished, it had come off as something she and Lucius had planned. Heck, by the end of it, there weren’t many accusations that did stand. Lucius’ memory archive seemed to concentrate on the time just before and near the final battle, when he’d been little more than a hostage in his own house.
Harry and Draco looked at her stonily from where they sat, nearly curled together, at the head of Draco’s bed.
It didn’t take him long to find what had broken Cissa’s heart and his rage was so complete it took him a whole minute for him to figure out what the first step should be. “It’s alright darling, please Cissa. I’ll call the barrister.”
Harry bit his lip after that and let Draco navigate the whole thing. Harry thought he might have learned something too. Draco was polite but firm, exacting without being rude and the Goblins seemed to appreciate Draco’s form of communication more than any he’d tried in the past.
Mandy grinned at Violet’s back. Finding and reconnecting with her half-sister was the smartest thing she’d ever done. No one made her feel as loved and cared for as Violet did and Mandy sincerely hoped she hadn’t brought her any trouble.
“How much pot?” Tawy glanced back at the room. That would certainly explain their inability to hold back, marijuana relaxed the constraints of magic. She knew that’s what caused it to be so very popular with these kids and why she was mostly unsuccessful in keeping it out. Though really it wasn’t a problem, sometimes even a help, allowing the kids an outlet and not letting their magic ‘back up’.
“Draco,” Pansy started unsure, which caught Draco attention, “I saw your parents. Your mother gave me a letter for you.” Pansy slid the letter across the table. She expected Draco to dive onto it, but instead to took it and folded it to stick in a pocket.
Tawy agreed, “through as we continue, you’ll get more time with your wands. We’ll work up to everyday. I imagine the accidental magic would get quite serious with you two if we don’t allow you some way to expend it.”
Draco sighed, giving up on sleep, “I suppose we should.” He pushed up, cursing when his ring caught a strand of his hair.
Harry went to the table and picked up the first vial with a golden H on the top. He looked but there was no indication of what the potion even was. He sighed and drank the first.
Harry blinked. He’d known it had been too easy to get Draco’s wand. “I knew it. You practically threw it at me.”
Shacklebolt’s face turned thunderous, his veins throbbing, tightly he bit off, “may I use the court’s floo Your Honor.”
Harry smiled at his back. He glanced back towards Violet’s wide eyes and remembered muggles weren’t as accepting of same-sex relationships as wizards were. “Ah,”
Draco opened his eyes and looked across his pillow. He knew the markings. His fingers remembered every turn. It was dark beneath the blanket but there was enough light for Draco to make out the green shine of Harry’s eyes, “yes.”
Andromeda concurred and nodded to her head solicitor, who stepped up, “we contend any wrong doing on young Malfoy’s part is a direct result of the Ministry’s negligence.”
“Really? How dreadful. I think we’re a little old for that now.” Lucius and Narcissa rarely questioned what he did with his time unless they had demands on it. They never asked anything about his life and they certainly never wanted to talk about it.
George’s eyes hardened. “Unless he starts something with you, leave that kid be. It’s over. Let’s not start another war or make another Voldemort. Merlin Ronnikins that Malfoy kid is related to Lucius, Bellatrix, the Carrows, and hell probably Greyback and ol’ Volde himself. We should count ourselves lucky he wasn’t outright Avada Kedavraing people over the breakfast table.” He felt like he’d aged a hundred years and just wanted to live and let live. Make the world Fred had died for a little lighter, a little happier, as Fred would’ve wanted. “If Harry does come back mates with him you accept it and back Harry. I will and you’ll look a right arse if you don’t.”
He nodded as he drank more soda. “Okay,” he took another sip before Helen could take the glass, “can I buy this stuff somewhere?”
If he chose correctly half his work would be already done. They would know pure blood ways and if he chooses a child older than Draco. Well that would make things twice as easy. Age would already set him up as the next Lord Malfoy. He would tell Narcissa that this way Draco was free to do whatever he wanted, to follow wherever his fancy took him. He would set aside a generous investment portfolio in Draco’s name so he would never want for a galleon no matter how he spent. He would allow Draco to keep the Black titles and inheritances as Narcissa would certainly insist and the titles gifted to him at birth. He would make sure his new inheritor would sincerely take care of Draco and his wellbeing. That should bring Narcissa around to the idea.
He shrugged with a dip of his head, “Yeah, well,” he glanced back towards the burrow and turned back towards them, “see you later?”
Harry rolled his eyes. It was hard for him to believe other people couldn’t see what he did. Malfoy’s were entirely easy to read, once you got the hang of it.
“I agree,” Draco didn’t want any more unwanted attention on Harry. Nor did he want attention brought onto anything that might make Harry even more attractive to the harpies. He took up Potter’s hand and slid the ring onto his finger, where it adjusted happily.
Harry agreed. If they had to find something else, they would. They weren’t exactly sure what the blood ritual did, it was risky, but in Harry’s mind it was far riskier to return to Hogwarts without it. Something that let him know Draco was in danger was worth anything else that might happen.
Lucius sighed as he stood and took her hand. “Cissy,” he didn’t know how to tell her the many ways she could still (would) lose Draco, but he could spare her the pain today, “Give it a little more time.” And his Cissy had never been dumb, she knew.
Harry couldn’t help but agree. They’d been here since this morning and he was pretty sure the next couple of hours, after the lunch break, would be more of the same. So far, the Wizengamot hadn’t cast judgment on too many people he actually knew. People he knew of, yes, such as Goyle Sr., who had been re-sentenced to Azkaban for life. Most of the people he knew were either dead like Bellatrix or students like Pansy Parkinson and Goyle Jr., who had already been sentenced to very strict probations, community service, and fines by the lower courts. There were only a few students and young adults being charged and sentenced with their parents. Millicent Bulstrode and her parents had gone yesterday. She’d gotten two years of house arrest for her actions during the battle.
He turned, expecting to see Siri and Sev and instead, “holy shite.” Instead of Siri and Sev, his lovable brothers, standing at his door was Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. He’d always known it was them, but woe. The changes were subtle but they changed so much. Harry was wearing the glasses, his hair was black and Teddy could see the scar he always hid. Draco’s hair was platinum blond and Teddy could see for the first time the death eater tattoo on his arm.
Neville’s eyes widened as he looked to the others. Hermione and Pansy were smiling, nearly bursting and Blaise chuckled even as he left to get a round of drinks. So, whatever this was, it couldn’t be bad, still, “Sickening?”
Mandy, as well as everyone else, made noises of surprise and curiosity. Healer Kelly didn’t answer their questions, but sent them out the door, “directly to your rooms please.”
“Let’s see,” Tawy whispered to herself, mentally running over everything she’d spoken with the Headmistress about. “Your bands will be reprogramed, but you’ll continue to wear them, so I can monitor you,” Harry frowned and Draco looked up to her, “I’m sorry but it’s non-negotiable. It’s for your own safety. There are still war criminals loose and other fanatics running about.” She wasn’t budging on that one. “I’ll still be your guardian. I’ve already approved Hogsmeade trips and while you won’t be on any official school teams. I think there’s some opportunity to help out with coaching.”
The Judge withdrew into himself and withered under the dark and angry glares directed at him from multiple sources including Judge Fumeurs, who spoke lowly, “and that’s why we don’t let you talk Markus.” He turned compassionate and revered eyes back to Andromeda, “You have the apologies of the court Madam.
Violet shook her head at the dance floor and went back to the bar. Roughly 10 minutes later, she looked up from the drink she was making to see a tall ginger, looking rather lost and determined. She handed off the drink and went round the bar til she was close enough. “Oi!”
“Of course,” Tawy assisted, moving the other bed away from Draco. Now unimpeded, the Ministry’s Blood Magic specialist, Belinda, kneeled down, “no knife found?” She took Harry’s wrist and carefully turned it over.
They paused outside Malfoy manor. Harry swung their hands as he gave Draco a moment to look the building over. He glanced at Tawy, who appeared in no hurry. “Do you wanna destroy something or spend money?” Harry offered. He was down for either choice.
“I have examined the boy and with the court’s pardon, if someone isn’t punished for state of that child, I’ll have the reason why.”
Harry thought Malfoy was going to yank away from the touch as he had all the previous one’s Harry had seen. Yet he didn’t, he tensed but didn’t move and then the tenseness passed too, and Malfoy still didn’t move, so Harry didn’t. He’d seen the way Draco had reacted to the mention of the cruciatus. Harry didn’t want to bring attention to it, but he didn’t want Malfoy to suffer either. He was done with that and he hoped Draco was too.
Draco smiled a real smile, lacking everything but joy, “I don’t know. I didn’t plan on living through it.”
She sat heavily at the end of the bed, “One the aurors broke his code of conduct. He spoke to a reporter.”
Murphy shook his head with a grin. “Ben you took my thunder. I was going to announce Friday will be our next wand day. Remember, wand day is only for those who have earned it with good behavior and for those who showed good choices last wand day. You must also have parental permission on file or, for those in the Ministry program, the permission of their Care-witch/wizard on file. The meeting will be scheduled in your bands.”
The clothes were light green and Draco wasn’t sure he had ever worn anything quite this color green before. Though he wore a lot of green, it was his favorite color after all. He picked at them for a few seconds. There were two things he could say for them, they were really soft, and the sleeves were long, which was of the utmost importance these days. The pants had a string through them at the waist and it took Draco a few seconds to figure how that was supposed to go, but in all they were warm and soft. So, while he wouldn’t dare wear them in public or even the manor proper. He might get away with wearing them in his private rooms, with the doors locked and charmed. He wished the healer would hurry up. He was running out of ways to distract his thoughts. He straightened off the bed at the sound of the knock and thanked the good timing as he said, “come in.”
“Dumbledore was Headmaster and Snape was at Hogwarts as well, all the children learned from them.” Molly spoke up.
“Boys,” Tawy called out as she approached. She held out a pouch to each of them. “Quite a lot for one day boys.” She also handed Draco a card which he slipped into his pocket, along with the pounds.
Draco however was picking at the food on the table and didn’t notice, so continued, “She constantly talks about carrying too much responsibility, as if we weren’t adults now. Let other people adult, how about you kid for a while. Really who has time for that. And what we’re doing, she’s always wants to talk about that. What we’re reading, and then talking about it, it’s all really fucking odd.” He looked up, “what?” He looked to Harry, who seemed just as confused.
If Draco had learned one thing over the years it was that Potter did not break a promise. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist and squeezed tightly, “That I can do Potter.”
Clara nodded at Rey and then joined him on his beanbag. “We were just curious. None of us have ever been,” she laughed slightly, “you know important. We just wanted to know what it’s like.”
Harry smiled sadly. “I learned the hard way. Sometimes you just gotta ask. Maybe there was a reason they stayed away but you won’t know until you ask. I don’t think she’ll stop loving you if you aren’t like them.”
Harry put the smaller bag into the backpack, as Draco did the same. “The young lady at the counter recommended a lovely restaurant.”
“Want me to re-braid it for you?” Harry slid off his bed, only pausing to wait for a reply once at Draco’s bedside.
They had only attempted to restrain he and Draco once, after a nightmare. He couldn’t imagine how it would’ve gone had Tawy not torn into the room and removed them. The potions however yeah, they took a lot of them daily and neither one of them were sure what most of them were. He didn’t want more of that.
Ron grabbed her hand and looked up at him with a pain-filled expression, “Harry, mate, we all know what you hear around Dementors.”
Harry grabbed the coke, grinned at the red label and popped it open. He handed it Draco. “Here, drink this.”
Draco didn’t glance around. He held his head high and looked indifferent to the whispers around them. He followed Potter to the table and, since neither wanted to sit with their back to the room, silently arranged the chairs somewhat on the same side of table. Far enough apart that they weren’t really sitting next to each other, but both had the comfort of the wall behind them. Draco took up the shake, determined to get it out of the way. Potter must have had the same idea. It didn’t taste all that bad and he finished without thinking about it. It also filled him. He pushed his tray away the same time Potter did.
Harry grinned. “I kinda think they already know how I feel about you and I don’t care if they don’t approve or whatever. Remember I’ve been wanting this, I’m not about to let it go for no one. I meant it, no one is going to take you away from me.”
Draco closed his eyes and sighed. He couldn’t really see his father loving him after all his failures, much less if he let the ol’man have it. Lucius was pretty much done with him. But maybe he had a chance with Mother and he was afraid to lose that chance. He was afraid to test that love in case it failed. Then there would be no chance, but then he’d know for sure. Maybe just maybe he’d be happier if he didn’t have to worry about every word and every step. He lifted his head and looked to Harry, “Hey what about Granger?”
“I can’t rampage through his thoughts no.” Draco replied, distracted as he made a list of everything they had to do before returning to Hogwarts.
“Good, that’s lovely. Do give it back to him.” Tawy looked to Molly. “That’s all they’ll need. We will provide everything else.”
George’s felt the rightness of his choice as Neville and those around him straightened with readiness. Even the Slytherins in their group looked ready to fight again and George was so fucking grateful. There were several things he had to hand over, but he thought he’d start with the most pressing and the reason he’d come at all instead of letting Ronnikins handle it, “Hermione’s been arrested.”
“Tawy wouldn’t have put you here if something hadn’t happened to you.” Mandy called out. “You might as well sit and spill.”
“Hermione,” Ron rolled his eyes, “how do you even? Don’t give information to stuff we really don’t need answered.”
Healer Robertoun, call me Tawy, must have been a very experienced apparator because it was the smoothest side along he’d ever experienced. Once they had stepped from the arrival point, Draco wanted to make something clear, “I’m 17 now. I don’t belong in pediatrics.”
Harry glanced at the deep emerald imbedded into black metal around Draco’s finger and the shimmering golden B floating within and would call that ring a lot of things, but little wouldn’t be one of them. “Ok, why didn’t the goblins say anything?”
Harry nodded as he stood up. Speechless as Draco led him to the fitting room, until the doorway where he grabbed a kiss. “You’re gorgeous.”
Lucius nearly fell twice in his run though the house. “Cissa!” She continued screaming and he followed the sound. He skidded around a corner and pushed away from the doorway he’d clipped with his shoulder. He slid to a stop in front of her, grabbed her arms, and then into a tight hug as she threw herself into his arms. “Cissa, oh Cissa, darling what is it? What?”
Vos (though Harry remembered he preferred Bear) walked closely behind Malfoy until they reached Tawy at the forefront of the Judge’s bench. On one side, Andromeda stood from her seat as she stared at Draco. On the other, Narcissa covered her month with a discrete hand, though her whisper of “Dragon” seemed to carry.
The woman smiled, “Thank you. Now after you finish, just tap the tray three times and it’ll disappear. Then off to bed. You’ve both have group at 10AM. I’m sure you’ll enjoy meeting some of the others.” She left without waiting for them to reply.
never done with Fred at his side. George knew someone had to handle this newest crisis. He also knew it couldn’t be him, not now, maybe never. He hoped they had more to give as he was just tapped out.
Tawy nodded, glancing between her auto-med quill as it wrote out the diagnosis and Draco, who was still blinking at the room. “Bring him some of that muggle organic soda-pop, the teenagers love that stuff.”
Harry sat up, stretching a little. “We weren’t supposed to survive, and they treated us that way. It didn’t matter what they did to us because we had an expiration date. Those ‘famous’ wizards and witches, you were all so eager to hear about. They were powerful and scary and, more often than not, they didn’t give a shit what damage they were doing to us as long as they got their way!” Harry glanced at Draco then away, blinking as he was unable to hold back the dark thoughts. Sirius had been the only one to ever offer him an out, the only one to pull him aside and tell him to forget this shit and run.
Only Mother and Uncle Sev said they were ever proud of him and it had been a long while since either had even thought it, he was sure.
“I couldn’t agree more.” Mandy answered, before turning towards the rest of the kids, “hey we still have some time. Let’s go waste it on the other side of the room. Where they’ll ignore all the fun stuff we can think of.” The other kids took off after her and Draco scowled at their backs as the adults moved closer.
“Add Gringotts,” Harry tapped the parchment, and leaned back, he paused before taking up Draco’s hair again to look at Mandy, “the most we can do is send a message to each other, it’s not really words though.” He scratched his head, “I mean, it’s just, I don’t know how to explain it.”
“I can’t stay,” Draco bit his lip and looked towards the Great Hall, “I just can’t. I’m done with the lot of them.”
Ella frowned, “I’ve just never seen anything like this. I’m not trying to, I don’t know, mean anything.”
She listened to his answer. “Good, get on that. Until then I have to tell those boys what the whole world has recently heard.” She scowled but nodded at the words said to her and replied. “I’m sorry too, fix this.” She pulled her head from the fire and sighed heavily. She didn’t dare let this wait. She feared someone would get to them before she did. She tapped the band at her wrist. “No one enters Potter and Malfoy’s room, no one and call me if they attempt to leave.”
The room’s atmosphere changed as the sound of hundreds of people taking their seats replaced the sounds of talking. Harry looked to the front as the Judges of the Grand Wizengamot entered the room. He noticed Ron’s parents closer to the front and pointed them out to Ron with a nudge and a discrete point.
Judge Fumeurs didn’t look Draco’s way as he continued, “The matter of His Grace’s guardianship will be resolved in closed quarters, where I will precede accordingly.” The Judge closed the court, this time paying no heed to the clamoring and talking that went on.
“It’s ridiculous. I need to be able to write him at least. He’s my child,” Her anger turned to brokenhearted despair, “how can I rebuild my relationship with him while they have him? What are they doing with him? I’m his mother and I demand him back.”
Since the beginning of the trials, Harry had often wondered whose portraits lined the walls of the great room. As this wasn’t a courtroom he was familiar with, but since they’d always been empty Harry figured he was destined never to know. He had figured wrong. Every portrait was now occupied. There were a couple he recognized, such as Phineas Black and Dumbledore, who winked at him.
“You do realize this is a mad house,” Mandy rolled her eyes, “they don’t just leave knives lying about.”
The assistant tapped her wrist and eyed the list of names before announcing. “They’ve left dinner and have just entered their room.”
“Good,” he smiled, “they’re not here anymore to control us. We can do or be anything we actually want, so what’s your wildest dream Draco?”
Hermione and Ron shared a look of ‘here we go again’. Ron scowled and decided to stop the whole thing before it got started. Depending on Harry’s mood he could start defending or cursing Draco Malfoy but either way it took forever to calm him down. Harry didn’t even carry on about the Dark Lord as much, which they very carefully didn’t mention. Hermione thought there was something to that. Ron didn’t want to know. “Listen mate, they’re going to get what they deserve. I know you said you were going to speak up for Mrs. Malfoy but the other two didn’t do squat for us, so let them rot.”
The one in front rushed forward, thrusting the parchment importantly to the Judge, who took it up with a snap of his fingers. He opened the parchment and quickly read the page, before his eyebrows wrinkled and he went back over it. Finally, he huffed and passed it to the judge on his right, before looking down to the awaiting solicitors, “we will hear her and allow her to proceed before the Malfoy case.”
Shacklebolt slid a parchment across the Judge’s desk before standing beside it. The Judge read it and looked to Shacklebolt who nodded, then Healer Tawy, who repeated the gesture. Judge Fumeurs sighed, grabbed a quill and added his own signature, before waving his wand over the parchment. That seemed to be the cue everyone was waiting for as he lifted his wand the room went quiet. He glanced among them, finally stopping on Mrs. Tonks, “It is admirable what you ask to do Madam.” He looked to Molly, “You as well, Mrs. Weasley, taking young Potter in. However unnecessary, it is appreciated.
Slightly dazed, Draco wondered if they even had an Auror who gave out broom tickets. The threat worked though the Auror dropped his arm like it was living death. Draco didn’t dare look down but he could and did look slightly to the Healer’s left, so he didn’t meet her eyes, “no one is going to go into your memories, Draco. No one is going to hurt you. We’re just going to take a look at you.”
They sat on the couch, and she gave them a few moments to arrange themselves. She did note they chose to sit together on the couch rather than apart. “Now that you’ve been here for a week or so, I’m sure you both have some questions. Let’s start there.”
Draco was resigned. He’d known he wouldn’t be allowed to go free. He glanced towards Potter and knew the other boy would not take this well. He hoped Potter threw a fit for the both of them.
By now, they had a routine, Draco didn’t even attempt to sit on the couch any more, but in front of it, next to Harry, as they pulled out the markers and unfinished art from last time. Tawy lowered herself down as they prepared.
Mandy scowled and closed the magazine. Since they’d come, she’d had her sister sneak in any news on the two and there was so much of it and all of it unbelievable. Just like that shield, unbelievable. She slumped back in her seat, “We should get them drunk and get the real info.”
“Kingsley and Healer Tawy.” Harry watched as the Minister pulled some parchment from his robes, the Healer a quill.
Neville smiled, “Then we make the papers work for us. We make them send Harry and Malfoy to Hogwarts or risk looking like they’re holding the darlings of the Wizarding world hostage.”
years are going to have their own housing. Away from the other years and their houses. You won’t actually be members of a house any longer and your badges will reflect Hogwarts’ unity.”
Draco arched his back, before taking Harry’s hand and allowed himself to be pulled up. He stretched, “Potter, I think,”
Draco blinked back his pain enough to look to Harry, who had a tight grip on him. He recognized Harry’s pain, understood the fury in his eyes, but it wasn’t until Harry’s eyes widened, did he realize the trouble they were in.
Harry glared up at the Healer. “What did you do to him?” He didn’t bother hiding his anger. This bitch had upset Draco enough that he was shaking.
Tawy leaned back, “I haven’t thought about that.” She paused thoughtfully, turning it over, “How about a tentative yes, to be later determined by how the year is going.”
Narcissa glanced towards Tawy, who seemed solely interested in the plant life, and then to the Potter boy, who appeared was going nowhere. She sighed and softened visibly, “Draco, we,” she paused, seemingly searching for words. “We’re so very happy you’ve come.” She reached across the table. Draco took her hand with the one that wasn’t holding onto Harry much tighter. “Oh,” she bounced up, “look darling,” she produced his trunk already shrunk into miniature, “I’ve got it all ready for you. I’ve packed it full of new things, all sorts of gifts.” She seemed so proud of her herself that Draco could do nothing but nod and thank her. She placed the trunk in front of him with a pat.
“They wanted to protect you Draco, because they love you, but they wanted to use you too. They thought they were capable of doing both and they were fucking wrong.” Blaise ended with passion tinging his raised voice. He seemed slightly embarrassed but didn’t take back.
Judge Fumeurs stopped him with a raised hand, “the court is aware of the young man’s whereabouts. Have your clients been made aware of the new accusations levied against them?”
That sounded alright to Harry, “Um, that’s great, but he said you signed for us. Molly Weasley, well she had some papers.”
“Do your best,” She smiled. She waited a few moments, commented on what they were drawing, before moving onto the next topic, “I think we should talk about last night.”
Ginny shook her head and looked away when he considered her for help. She seemed angry about something; her words had been biting all morning. Percy shrugged sadly. Bill mouthed, ‘leave him,’ and so Charlie did, but he still didn’t like it. He hadn’t even seen George and, well damn, he hadn’t seen George yet, still at the shop. Mum hadn’t even left the kitchen, preparing for a feast from the sounds of it.
“Not to me,” Molly answered, “had I thought. Well I don’t know why I didn’t question the idea of a child being so entrenched. It’s just, we had Harry. I’m ashamed to admit with him being a Malfoy that I didn’t always think of him as a child like our own.”
There was a momentary pause and the click of china. “Draco has always been a difficult child, tenacious. I’ve always forced myself to remember that he was raised in near isolation, his parents the ruler of his every thought. He’d never attended a school until Hogwarts. He’d only had other children around very rarely and was taught to rule them. I dare say the child never had a real friend. I don’t think he’d know how to make one.”
Harry threw up his hand as he stood, the doors responded by slamming shut. He stood on the bench and then the table and said, “shut the fuck up.” He didn’t yell but he might as well had as the room went dead silent.
George grinned, and it looked as if he were genuine even if the smile stopped short of his eyes, “Hey that’s great you two, we’ve,” he paused, his eyes shuttered briefly, “I’ve always thought you two would be great for each other.”
Harry shook his head, while Draco said, “Oh I can assure you, it’s no more exciting being kicked around by Voldemort than by any other adult. Unless, you mean by excitement, the possibility that he might actually kill you.”
Neville Longbottom scratched his head, “I’m not sure I understand. Hermione was pardoned by the Ministry for,” he glanced around, and to George’s (somewhat, but not very) surprised eyes, it wasn’t the Slytherin’s in the group that caused Neville’s cautious look around. “for her parent’s moving.”
“Interesting,” the sigil had clearly been carved, just below the inside of his elbow. It was no longer bleeding, looked healed even. The lines were very fine, delicate and silver. It was well done, a lovely piece of magic. It was always an academic pleasure to see blood magic applied by such powerful wizards. Belinda stood back and gestured towards Draco, “if you’d roll his sleeve please and turn his arm over. I’d rather not touch His Grace if I don’t have to. I’ve been informed of his distaste for touch.”
Teddy couldn’t believe he was talking to Hermione, the Hermione Granger and she was so nice. She’d even hugged him. All the girls he’d went to school wanted to be just like her, smart and brave. People from all over the world read her blog.
Murphy waved her back and quickly approached, still holding them off with a raised hand, he looked into the room. He leaned back pale and shaken, “Dear Merlin. Where’s Tawy?”
Draco added. “We weren’t important because of us. We were important because of what they wanted from us.”
The Healer, now at the open armoire, turned towards him with surprise. “Never, not even when you were small? That can’t be right, are you sure?”
The only other option was a blood adoption. Take a pure-blooded orphan and through ritual and blood turn that child into a Malfoy, just as binding as birth and without the wait of pregnancy and infancy. That way he would know the child’s tendencies and personally beforehand.
Violet sipped hers. “No, that’s ok, this is awesome. I’ve never been in here and watched the staff work like this. Then again, I’ve never been here with someone spending money like water. But man, you boys clean up nice.”
Harry let his mind wander as the man continued to talk about respect and the privacy of the circle. Privacy enforced with a hex against speaking about anyone else’s business outside of the group to anyone that didn’t already know it. Harry took it in stride. It was nothing he hadn’t already been subjected to and, from the looks of it, Malfoy was familiar with it as well. He didn’t immediately recognize anyone in the circle from Hogwarts, which didn’t mean they didn’t go there. Harry didn’t know everyone, but no one looked familiar.
“I brew potions or at least I did.” Draco raised a handful of hair to show his point. “Once I broke a mirror.”
“Like it just flows now, no need to call it, it’s just there waiting. Me too.” Draco paused thoughtfully, “I wonder how long our magic was siphoned for us to feel like this. It had to be a long time, long before the he arose.”
Tawy readied herself to tread carefully. “I have set up a time for us to meet with the Weasleys and a time to meet up with the Malfoys.”
“It was,” Molly agreed, “Wizards are living longer than ever. It’s not unheard of to reach 150 these days, so what’s a few more years added to the minority? At least they passed that temporary law. The one in which passing the NEWTS marked adulthood. They’ve passed so many new laws recently, haven’t they? In any case, I’ll be able to keep Harry and Ron for at least the year while they take their 8
Hermione had an arm around both Ron and Harry. He could just see her fingertips at Harry and Ron’s sides. Charlie couldn’t see much around, he assumed Malfoy’s back, due to the long platinum hair. What he could see was Ron’s head lowered to Harry’s, practically forehead to forehead as they whispered. Harry’s arm wrapped around Malfoy’s waist and gripped Ron’s wrist tightly, where Charlie could see Ron’s fingers wrapped in white locks. Perhaps Malfoy’s inclusion in their number wasn’t as unwelcomed as he’d thought.
“My parents never used the cruciatus curse on me. They tried to keep me safe.” Draco looked to his parents, his father stoic, his mother’s gathered tears.
Hermione refolded the page, “we put it somewhere. Somewhere neither of them would ever run across it. Or at least not unless we think Malfoy needs to see it.”
Violet glanced to see Mandy had spotted them as well. Violet wave it off to her and went back to the other side of the bar.
Murphy nodded. “Yes, it does, and because these memories and feelings are awful, you may want to avoid the triggers. Avoiding things that give you terrible feelings is normal and it will make you feel better in the short term.  But in the long run, avoiding triggers will make things worse. Instead of avoiding triggers, we learn how to manage our reactions when they happen. It’s not fair, but a lot of surviving, is overcoming experiences that are not our fault.”
Harry pressed his leg against Malfoy’s, taking strength from Malfoy letting him. “She’s right,” the Healer quickly looked towards Harry, so did everyone else. Harry shrugged. “She is. How many of you have cast the unforgivables or had them cast on you?”
The cabbie gave them a few wondering looks. Mandy leaned forward, “he’s been in a coma, forgot a lot.” The cabbie nodded as if that was normal and put his attention onto traffic.
Today he felt kind-a numb, and had Tawy asked, he might have vetoed them seeing anyone other than Ron and Hermione. It was the knowledge that they were here which kept him from just walking away. He glanced towards Tawy, who nodded at him. He looked to Draco, who squeezed his hand and with a small smirk, raised his other hand and knocked.
Draco smiled sadly at him and then looked to her, “They documented my birth, going to school, and every other moment they could use to sell a story. They’ve called me a monster, a murder, and a torturer. Last week, they said my father used illegal potions on me and this week they say my uncle raped me. They take every moment of my life and broadcast it. I knew they’d have this sooner or later.”
Lucius scowled. If the ministry didn’t allow Narcissa’s letters to reach Draco soon, he’d be suing them liable for cruel and unusual punishment. They’d no idea the agony he’d undergo if Narcissa continued to be put off.
Harry looked over to Draco and wondered what he had to write about. Draco had been lying on his stomach across his bed for the last 20 minutes writing away. Harry was attempting to do the same, had even copied Draco’s position, but nothing was coming to him. He tapped his quill against the journal. It didn’t make the same satisfying noise a pen made. Harry sighed and looked to the other boy. He didn’t fully trust Draco, yet, but it was scary how much he already trusted him and how much he wanted to. They still fought a lot but even that was theirs. Blinking he turned back to his journal.
The paper sat ignored on Tawy’s desk, her head in her fireplace. “And how exactly did it get out? Of course, I’ll have to tell them, kids get the news in here and if I don’t, a kid or a member of staff will. This is a monumental fuck up and I know you say you’ll find the culprit, but you also have to deal with the fallout Minister.”
“Yes,” Harry warmed up to the idea, “you and me, yeah. I want to test myself against you. Duel me Draco.” He nudged him again, batting his eyelashes when Draco looked at him.
Tawy smiled, “I appreciate it and will likely take you up on that.” She set her quill aside, “I have goals for them this year.”
“I’m afraid not,” she paused, thought it over and then went with her gut, “they haven’t awoken yet.”
Tawy shook her head, “no, thank you. I can’t stay long, but thank you for making time for me.” Hogwarts was lovely and while the office wasn’t as she had pictured it, from Draco and Harry’s words, she imagined the changes were only due to the change in occupant. The new Headmistress had a stern manner but Draco and Harry spoke highly of her.
Hermione had always been slightly jealous of Harry’s ease with balancing though not how he’d gained the skill. “Harry,”
Tawy blinked in surprise. Bear rarely showed interest in the children as his pursuits ran towards apprehension, but she nodded, “Of course, Bear.” He had taken an interest in the Potter boy as well. She didn’t know if that was a reason for added concern or not.
The shield crackled loudly and became viewable as a line formed, splitting as they pulled their hands apart.
Teddy nearly chuckled and bit it off with a shake of his head. “Sev you are anything but the bad guy in this story. Bad boy, yeah, but people have made you into the icon of change. People love you. Shit Sev after the movie people got the death mark tattoo with your name through the middle in support of you.”
She smiled and nodded back before turning to take in the whole group. “Before we begin I will drop a privacy bubble over us and remind you that this group is under hex. This group above all others will not tolerate any type of tampering. Everyone here, is here for the same reason and there is no shame. This is a safe zone and I will maintain it as such, everyone understand?” She glanced around the circle, waiting for every person to nod before moving on.
Ginny swallowed thickly, holding back her heartbreak, “We were done after our last talk, weren’t we? It was just me hanging on.”
Minerva nodded but felt compelled to add, “you would of course have unrestricted access to see them, whenever.”
“Draco!” Narcissa gushed as she moved around the table, her arms outstretched. Draco accepted the tight hug but didn’t reciprocate more than leaning into her. His arm stretched back to hold onto Harry. Lucius moved slower but he reached them before Narcissa let go and Draco felt his hand grip his shoulder tightly. He was the first to move back and thankfully his parents allowed it. His mother seemed tearful as they went back to the table. Narcissa gestured them to towards the chairs, “please, sit.”
“We will discuss this issue at a later date,” Judge Fumeurs replied, while gesturing towards Andromeda and the circus of people and media, “let us first finish the matter at hand.” He looked to Andromeda, “Madam, the concern you’ve gratefully brought to the court’s attention will be swiftly dealt with we assure you.” He glanced to the papers in front of him, “but the boy in question, even given the new laws, is nearly a legal adult.”
Draco glanced to Harry and then steeled his features and looked across to the others. “Well what else? Get it out of your systems.”
Hermione quickly leaned in and whispered. “Yes it is and yes I knew. Through Malfoy,” she paused, “the younger,” she amended, “must not know too much about it, because if he had, he would have surely rubbed it in our faces earlier.”
Ron laughed and nudged her, mostly playfully and kind-a for a moment wished they could’ve worked it out.
Harry took Draco’s hand and twisted their fingers together tightly, “They’ve already told the whole world about the muggles that raised me and my cupboard under the stairs. Of my starvation and pain, all there in print for everyone to read. I’ve learned that everything I do or that is done to me is everyone’s business. I’m not allowed privacy.” He shrugged, “I’m just numb to the whole thing honestly. Will they need us to testify? It only happened the once,” he glanced at Draco, “for each of us.”
Mandy rolled her eyes, “Sure whatever.” She looked over to Draco. She still didn’t feel comfortable pressing him as she did Harry, but she could talk to him, which was more than most seemed capable of.
Draco yanked his head up just as Tawy snapped, “Helen! Enough,” she unwrapped a loose shirt and matching pants, “I know these are nowhere near what you’re used to, but they help magnify our diagnostic spells, so I’ll ask you to put them on, alright?”
They read the paper and she’d expected a lot of responses. Anger, the practice room was open and waiting, maybe tears, maybe demands, something. She’d been ready for nearly everything. Except dull acceptance.
Draco shook his head. “Healer Tawy gave me the cure. It cuts the connection and if she gave it me, she surely gave it to you.”
Murphy nodded, “quite right,” and quickly used the key. He grabbed up the wands and nearly forgot the key but grabbed it at the last moment and sprinted from the room.
Mandy looked between them, looking for something. “Oh, like you’ve been through so much worse, huh?”
Molly scowled. They had meant to do this to Harry the whole time. They had planned for this. They were just adding the Malfoy boy due to the new information. She would be having some stern words the next time she saw the Minister. He nodded at her in recognition but was a peace with his decision.
The man dropped his head, “No sir, I allowed myself to believe that there could be nothing wrong. I allow my judgment to be swayed by my superiors and
People scattered, Headmistress McGonagall being one of the last to leave the Great Hall. She thoughtfully watched her students scatter and sadly closed the doors before she made her way to her office, where she was found an hour later by Ron, Hermione, and Ginny. The portraits had already told her what the students were tripping over each other to say. Harry’s things were gone, yes, she knew, the elves had also taken Malfoy’s. The portraits also told her the boys had left the castle. Hermione wanted to go Grimmauld place and since they were 8
“They lost control!” Ben heaved out, bent over and trying to catch his breath after his run to search everywhere for Tawy.
The Judge to the left of Fumeurs scowled and bellowed out “that boy is facing some serious charges. The fact that his parents didn’t tuck in him at night is not going to exonerate him. People died.”
“See something like this before then?” Ben asked, moving into the room that must be only slightly smaller than the one they stayed in.
Molly pulled herself together as more impromptu guests arrived. Harry noticed they were mostly former Order members. Some he was happier to see than others, still he greeted everyone who spoke to him. Poppy inquired about his health for several minutes, though it had 3 months since he’d been released from St. Mungo’s. He figured it might be 3 months more before she didn’t ask every time she saw him.
Draco scowled at the blank faces around them, all seemly feeling the pressure but unsure what to do. “We need to destroy something.” He growled.
Harry had an uneasy feeling about this. He glanced over and could see how still Draco had gotten, tilted slightly in his seat towards his mother.
There was silence for several minutes, until a loud huff had everyone looking to Pansy Parkinson, who glared around her, “Really?” She questioned, she glanced to Blaise Zabini, who nodded towards the rest. She huffed again, “Well it’s obvious isn’t it? The Ministry told them, who else could say something and get this reaction from the Australian government.”
“And they were just like this when you found them?” The woman glanced to her and then to the boys again.
Mandy waved a hand towards the floor, “you’ll have to get someone to clean the dance floor, all that drool is gonna cause an accident.”
His mother’s grip on his arm tightened to unpleasantness, “why?” She demanded as Lucius took the parchment from the solicitor.
Tawy sighed. “I’ll be signing all your permission slips. The Ministry thought it would be best if we gave you both some space away from everyone else’s ideas of what was good for you.”
Ella blinked, and whispered something to the girl beside her, before looking across the circle to them. “I don’t think I could handle the cruciatus hitting me.” She shivered.
“I believe it,” she felt so badly for them, bad enough to take the risk. “Shite, they don’t have their wands, what if,”
Harry bit his lip, wondering when Voldemort had slipped him the potion. He couldn’t imagine anyone else doing it. “Could it still be happening?” The whole thing had a nightmarish quality about it. He could just see Voldemort using this as some way back from the dead.
“I know, but I just can’t,” Draco picked up the sleeve of a jacket that was probably polyester and shuttered. “Potter-Harry please.”
“How you holding up boy?” An overfriendly pat to the back had Harry stumbling before he could turn and give Minister Shacklebolt a negligible smile.
“I heard the observation room is booked solid during wand time, staff even coming in from their day off.” Ella remarked.
Draco folded his legs, sitting forward. “Go ahead Potter. I don’t understand this fascination for my hair, missing Granger?”
Draco was relieved when he heard Potter begin to write. Made him feel like he could write and not worry about what Scar head was doing. He looked down to the last part he’d written. ‘Potter’s touch doesn’t make me want to get away. I don’t know what that means. I want to trust him. I don’t trust anyone. We talk and he doesn’t remind me of all the mistakes I’ve made. There is no reason for Potter to want my friendship now. My name is in disgrace. My parents have no power to do anything for him. We have money but so does he. Potter has everything, he won. He’s the all power-full Savior. And yet... he doesn’t brag about winning and sometimes, in group, when things are hard, he’ll press his leg into mine and I feel better. I like it when I say something, and I look over and see him smiling at me. I don’t know. All I’ve had is alliances and relationships based on need. Is this friendship? After all this time, he wants to be my friend, why when I have nothing does he offer?’
They walked down the hallways, not even noticing the looks as they walked by, nor the people that thought to try and talk to them, walking by before most could form the words, and ignoring the ones that did. Their heads bent together, chatting softly.
But Teddy remembered when they hadn’t been okay. He remembered the healers and the charms and the pain.
“This sucks,” Mandy scowled, “I feel like I’m in a fish bowl.” She swished her wand, sending a nicely done stinging hex onto a practice dummy.
Draco blinked, “House elves heads on the walls and that cow screeching at you from a painting, you can keep the England Black house Potter.”
He looked to Ron, who always came back for him. “If you don’t like it, we’ll come save you, yeah? We owe you a couple.” He meant it, even if he had to fight the whole Ministry to do it, he’d try.
Molly looked to Tawy as Hermione shrunk Harry’s trunk for him, “Harry is, of course, welcome to stay here while you go to that place.”
Molly quickly reread, to make sure she hadn’t misread. There was no mention of the Ministries Child Well-Care department anywhere on the document. They were the only department that took custody of children or even had the right to do so, she’d thought. Instead Kingsley and Tawy Robertoun were listed as soul guardians. An additional cavort; which read in part, that due to their health, neither boy could be released into his own care nor anyone else’s until so deemed competent by Robertoun, regardless of age.
Violet bit her lip and looked at Draco, who studied the place. “Very cozy, London chic, you’ve done wonders with the space.”
Neville turned the paper just enough to see it, realizing Pansy and Luna were trying to read it as well.
Tawy nodded. “Alright, that’s a good place to start. You’ve taken the cure and so the connection has been severed. You are old enough now that you would notice if it were ever attempted again.” She could see neither really understood. Draco accepted her words with a nod and Harry seemed only to accept them because Draco did. She raised her wand and conjured a tube, allowing it hover. “Image that magic enters from the world and into you, threw a tube like this.” The tube alit with a golden light, “now imagine every magic user has such a tube, but the size is different for everyone,” the tube grew and shrunk as she spoke, “as you can see, that means everyone has a different amount of magic they can use at one time. Now, when a magic user turns 11 that tube expands to its final size.”
Harry handed it over just as they emerged into the front part of the library and Tawy came through the door just as they slowed.
Yes, your Honor.” The parchment had arrived an hour or so after Draco had been taken, “we have question of how those accounts were received?”
“Good,” George nodded, “that’s good. I, ah, I just wanted you to know. I don’t blame you. You didn’t, it wasn’t you, that held the wand that, well, you know.”
Then Malfoy saw them. He threw up a hand and the table destroyed itself, shredding to nothing before it hit.
“What do you want?” Harry folded his arms and leaned back into his chair. Oddly enough he could show this trust because he believed Malfoy would back him.
Mandy glowered. The one thing she’d learned about these two, they never knew how to explain any of the crazy stuff they did. “Still, more in someone else’s head than I’d want to be.”
Harry appreciated the save and the words, nodding to him thankfully. He hadn’t even heard them mention the topic. He straightened, trying to pay more attention.
Even given all that, in these unsure times, there was no way to be certain an infant would even pan out. What if it was another Narcissa? What if he perished before being able to instruct the child? What if the child perished? There would be no time for a third. There was a good chance, if he died before the child reached majority, Narcissa would cut it from his will regardless of his wishes.
They followed Mandy upstairs, where she pointed out a guest room with queen bed, which was better than what they had been doing, trying to share a twin. If for no other reason than the presence of the other stopped the nightmares. They dropped their bags and followed her to her room, which was clean and nicely decorated.
Clara giggled. “I think you had better give it up Ella. They look entirely into each other. Potter hasn’t even looked at you. No matter how much you tighten your shirt.”
Draco shrugged, his shoulders bumping into Harry’s forearms, “I honestly don’t care, I don’t have anywhere else to go, except the manor and I’d rather not.”
Harry shook his head. “It’s weird, it’s like she cares about every little thing we do and wants to talk about it.”
Harry knew to everyone else they looked the personification of icy perfection. Heck, he heard some oh-ahs from around him and sounds of excitement from the press. However, to Harry’s practiced eye, gained from years of Malfoy watching, he noticed how Lucius’ eyes darted around and how he nearly outpaced his solicitor and had to pace himself. Behind him, Narcissa’s eyes were searching, her head tilted for a sound that she wasn’t finding. Her fingers flicked through her robes, a nervous gesture that Harry recognized from her son. The Malfoy’s were plenty nervous. It just wasn’t anything anyone else would notice. Nervous and Harry thought upset about something then he realized, they were looking for Draco.
Draco’s mind slid from his other thoughts and sighed, “Wand lore is not my forte. Besides it doesn’t matter, the wand is lost.”
“Are still your parents,” Tawy leaned forward, “and Molly Weasley is still your friend Harry. We’re just allowing you both some time to do things differently.”
Even their meetings with her changed, they no longer wanted her to shield them from the other. She hadn’t been sure about that, afraid they would hide or be unwilling, but it was the opposite. They seemed more willing to let her into whatever topic they were tackling that day.
They went to the library. Harry couldn’t think of anywhere else. The media room was always packed and all the muggle stuff in there made Draco nervous at the best of times, same with the game room. Their room was too small, too filled with the reminder that they were far from everyone they knew and not leaving anytime soon. So in lieu of a potion’s lab the library was the best he could do. Harry went to their regular table, regular in the way that it was hidden and slightly dark and they’d never seen anyone else sit there. Draco sat heavily next to him.
There seemed to be no end in sight until Harry sent a spell that while not strictly illegal certainly toed the line of being nearly so. It sent Draco flying back towards a wall, which the boy flew out of, but had he not, he might have been badly hurt. The next spell of Draco’s wasn’t nearly illegal, it was.
Belinda gave Draco’s arm the same study, the placement and sigil were the same, the only difference being these lines were emerald green. These sigils were simply lovely. Had it been anyone else, she would have asked to keep the pictures Tawy took of them. She leaned away and joined Tawy to the side of boys, “You were right to call.”
Harry looked through the box. “Wow, you must have every color ever, one’s that smell, one’s that stamp, mixed colours.” The box seemed never ending. He picked a marker, “here Draco look,” he pulled off the cap and then scribbled on the huge pad, “it’s for drawing and coloring. You make pictures with them.” Harry hadn’t seen one in years. He’d used some partly dry regular ones in primary school, but markers weren’t something he’d ever gotten at home. Dudley had them when they were kids of course but he hadn’t given them to Harry until they’d run out of ink. The pad of paper was far too huge to hold and work with the markers. Harry dropped the pad onto the floor in front of the sofa and followed with one of the marker boxes.
Teddy studied the marble, “It’s to show house unity against all odds. Hogwarts is together, against any foe.”
The Minister nodded, “I imagine you’ll have a lot to say, seems everyone has something to say about the Malfoys. Heck, I’ve heard from everyone including the muggle MP and the French Ministry about the
Well what’s the word my friends? I toiled over this one, not sure how it came across but I hope you liked it.
“My apologies, we didn’t mean to cause any trouble. Dr. Stride,” he offered his hand, but Harry didn’t let go of his wand or Draco, so after an awkward pause, he dropped his hand with a smile. “I work in mental spell damage. I haven’t gotten a chance to introduce myself before now, but I must say that was some bloody impressive magic.”
Draco snorted with a breathless laugh. “Really Potter. I’m a damn fine actor. If I hadn’t, you wouldn’t have owned the Elder wand and been able to kill that utter bastard.”
“We’ve noticed,” Zabini added, “but besides send Killsmen after them. There’s not much to be done now. The whole world knows about it, likely Draco and Potter, where ever they are, do as well.”
Draco swallowed thickly, mentally screaming at the idea of being forced to spend time with only his night terrors for company. He was powerless. The court commanded he do this and if he didn’t, they might put him in Azkaban. They might take the manor or their vaults or they might lock his parents up. He had no choice. He
“Yes, of course. You’ll be welcome to set up sessions with Harry and Draco as well, as often as you need.”
Ben looked away. “Course not, hey we’re here.” Ben sped up catching Rey in front of a door that Harry figured was someone’s room. Just much further down the same hall as their room.
Murphy smiled at them, although they were late due to Draco’s hair, now in a long braid, because Harry had learned how to do one for Hermione. Well he could’ve moved faster but he really liked Draco’s hair and had taken his time. Harry gave the man a small apologetic smile. Draco didn’t bother, but quietly slipped into his seat next to Harry.
Harry avoided Hermione’s hands and jumped off the table. Hermione and Ron started to get up but Harry waved them off. He looked around the room, noting how people wouldn’t meet his eyes and how pale and horrified they looked. At the door he shook his head, “I can’t believe I fucking died for you people.” He slipped through the door.
Harry took a gulp of Draco’s soda. Draco figured they had to be something like friends because he only thought of smacking Potter for a moment.
“I took several deep breaths and talked myself though what happened. I realized it had nothing to do with me and was able to calm myself down.”
Neither of them said a word. Harry imagined they resembled statues. Harry didn’t want to talk about earlier than a week ago and he didn’t want to wait alone while Draco did the same. Cause he would wait, in the hallway if need be.
Sure enough, she turned down the hallway, and there was Tawy, and probably every member of staff in the building, standing outside Malfoy and Potter’s door. Tawy had her back to the door, dismissing her staff with a stern frown, calling them out for their curiosity. Even as Mandy approached people were leaving or moving to the nurse’s station.
“It’s worse casting,” Malfoy whispered, and everyone stopped talking, “when you have to hold it too long. Held long enough and the cruciatus stops being a screaming punishment and becomes a clawing death keel. Held that long and they stop screaming. They claw their own skin down to the bone trying to stop it. They piss and sometimes shit on themselves. Their bones begin to snap as they slam onto the floor and all they can do is jerk and hitch.” Malfoy tilted his head. “Like a fish,” he starred at the floor and everyone starred at him. “Then, when you finally let it go. They can’t stand, can’t function as their mind is gone, choking on their own teeth and blood. You can heal the body, but the mind will never mend. Then Avada Kedavra is a blessing.” Malfoy’s soft words tapered off. He hadn’t looked up once, his eyes on some distant spot on the ground.
“I must agree,” the Malfoy solicitor added as he lifted his head, “these papers do not give the Child Well-fare department short term custody to be terminated at majority. It directly gives Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt and Healer Tawy Robertoun sole guardianship. Full custody until they decide to relinquish it. It says those boys are legally incompetent. The relinquishment of guardianship is based on opinion. It shows a complete disregard for his parent’s rights and young Malfoy’s crossover into the majority. You could claim the boy was incompetent for half his life with no legal recourse.”
Draco nodded, “Perfect. Thanks Harry,” He ducked down and kissed Harry’s cheek, turning away as he stood. “One of the dark and one of the light. Also the matching toiletry bags and wallets.”
Dr. Stride quickly interrupted. “Of course, we agree with Tawy completely, raised as you both were, in those environments certain things we can overlook.”
“Draco, trying to be what they want will make you miserable and it won’t last.” He flew back from her and she knew she’d pushed too soon.  In for a gallon, she continued. “If they can’t love you as you are, does it matter if they love who they think you are? It’s not real.” He yelled in rage and pain and shoved back against the shield. The shield screamed and then went completely down. She thought it was Draco, but as Harry quickly crawled towards Draco, she wasn’t sure which had done it.
Harry rolled his eyes, “Tawy, I’m not going to leave Draco Malfoy alone in the middle of muggle London.”
Blaise shrugged. “But she doesn’t kill me or put me in harm's way. When she heard about ‘his’ return, she took me to France.”
Teddy hated that he’d upset them so badly. It hadn’t been his intention but he thought they should know what they were walking in to. “Here and in the states it’s not as bad as it is over there.”
Blaise looked around and Ron knew he’d been hanging out with the snakes too long because, while his handsome face showed nothing, Ron knew he was really upset. Ron could see the same on Pansy’s face. He couldn’t even pinpoint how he knew, as her face was serene, but Ron knew. Perhaps it was in the way her hand turned and clutched Hermione’s.
“No one’s ever worn them before. We have new for each new patient, magic residue you know. You can take them with you.” Helen added helpfully.
Harry didn’t wait for further invitation and headed towards the door. He could feel the spell release as he crossed over the threshold. He could also see the tell-tale signs of bored reporters turning his way.
She frowned. “Harry?” Tawy tried to see Draco, maybe get a clue, but they were the same height and Draco was doing a pretty good job of hiding into Harry.
“It’s alright. Tawy’s good, she let us out. It’s weird. She’s weird. She wants to talk about everything. She’s always telling us she’s proud of us for stupid things. She says stuff that doesn’t even make sense, like it’s okay to be angry, who says that?” Harry trailed off, noticing the looks among the others.
Harry snorted with a chuckle, “Pens, markers, a couple of pencils, if it writes and it’s muggle, Draco’s got one.”
Ron nearly whistled, the woman was obviously made of money and iron. Her glare alone had Kade backing into his seat.
Draco opened his eyes to see Helen had moved closer, looking at him in concern. He jerked back from her nearness and stumbled into the bed. He yelped and threw himself away from both, breathing harshly when his back hit the wall.
“You have to ask Potter. It’s a lot of work and the goblins love to babysit unclaimed money. They just hoard it until an inheritor comes along to claim it. There’s probably a manor house somewhere that should be yours.”
Harry quickly shook his head, “no, but we do need it. If you’ve got one Romilda, could we please borrow it?”
Hogwarts (in conjunction with the Ministry) made the effort to ‘help the public heal’, by offering several groups, circles, and opportunities to make private appointments.
Tawy patted her back softly. “They’re very strong and very trained. I imagine there isn’t much they can’t do when they put their minds to it. Especially when they work together, you say Draco studied it first?”
Ginny scowled and glared Harry’s way as she walked back and forth. She’d been waiting for this moment for a while, “don’t you have something to say?” She questioned, hoping to hear some justification.
Harry approached and looked down with Draco, both watching as Draco’s long pale fingers turned and twisted the dagger. Draco glanced up at him, “should we wait or do it now?”
“You’re asking someone, who is a parseltongue, whether it’s evil trait.” Draco announced dryly, “How’s he supposed to answer that?”
Healer Tawy paused, she glanced to Shacklebolt, who nodded. She turned back to the court with a tilt of her head but said nothing further.
“Then who the fuck,” the boy flipped over aggressively on his bed. Ben waved a hand towards them. Harry smiled and waved. Draco raised an eyebrow. The boy swallowed. “No fucking way, I mean,” he jumped up, “yeah, yeah, hold on then.” He ran to his wardrobe, opened it and climbed in, closing the door behind himself.
Even the Slytherins had thrown Draco out as a sacrifice. They didn’t taunt him, but they did ignore him. They didn’t speak to him or help him out. They distanced themselves, as if they’d had nothing to do with the Death Eaters or their beliefs. As if, by distance, they could remove the stains upon their own names even the ones with parents in Azkaban.
Harry really appreciated her, only Ben and Clara followed them. Harry felt like he was pulling apart at the seams. The more he tried to pull it back the worse it became. Draco’s gritted teeth said the same.
“We were the means to an end.” Draco added, his voice even and unaffected. Inside though his stomach turned with the truth. The only people he’d ever been taught to love had handed him over to madness. Only one person had offered him an out, offered even knowing Draco couldn’t take it. Uncle Sev had continued to protect him, understanding better than Draco himself why he couldn’t go.
“You’re welcome,” Minerva replied. This woman controlled their access to Harry and Draco, of course she made time for her. She hoped it was good news. Tawy started by asking about their plans for the 8
“Good,” thankfully the pat was lighter this time around and Harry could keep his feet. The Minister leaned towards them with a twinkle in his eye and sensing something was being divulged they moved in. “Make sure to be back early from lunch. You’ll want to be here before the place fills up and they start turning people away.”
They worked over Draco for little over two hours and he was groggily pulling himself out of sleep when they finally finished.
Harry nodded grimly and wished he had Ron and Hermione. They made slow progress. Malfoy walked as if they were going towards their execution and Harry refused to leave him. Harry wasn’t going in alone. Still the place wasn’t that big, and the arrows stopped at a doorway. He took a deep breath and glanced at Malfoy, who sighed deeply but then nodded.
Hermione gasped.  Harry glanced at her sharply, but she wasn’t looking his way and he didn’t want to draw attention to himself by asking outright. He could tell by the paling faces around him that the news wasn’t good.
Still laughing, Violet set their drinks on a tray, “here you go luv. Let me know if you want more food, on the house.”
Tawy noticed a difference between the boys after their return. As long as she’d known them, they’d been rather attached to each other, together but separate. Now however there was nothing separate about them. Whenever she looked for them, she found them with their heads bent together, whispering any number of things, fingers near always intertwined.
George nodded, “She was, was even approached by the Ministry to write a paper of exactly what she’d done. That doesn’t seem to matter to the Australian government. The Ministry claims it’s all a mistake, they’re fixing it, and Hermione will not be prosecuted or anything. However, sorting it all will take time.”
Ella gasped in mock anger. “Don’t be angry cause I’m going to marry rich and no one would have you.”
Draco shared his first concerned look with Harry as he walked in. The room immediately put him at ease. Unlike the rest of the place, this room would fit right into the manor. It was a luxurious room with dark wood walls and thick rugs over the fine floor. Shelving covered each wall, holding wondrous feats of magical enterprises, more of the same floated around the room. There was a large dark desk that even his father would have treasured, the chair behind it was dragon leather covered. To the left of the door, a sofa and two chairs, covered with looked like the softest navy leather, the lush rug underneath matched.
“When are we going to get another wand day? It’s been like two weeks.” Ben cut Murphy short, slumping further in his seat when Murphy looked his way.
Affronted, Molly huffed, “What, we’d do no harm to the child. Just show him some kindness. That woman! Merlin’s beard, she burns me up. Not allowed to visit the only decent home he’s known. It’s an outrage!”
“He’s a particular fan of markers,” Harry added, “we had to pay a friend of ours to pick him up every type she could find.”
Harry leaned down, until their noses nearly touched, “It’s okay to be scared, I’m scared. I’m afraid they won’t accept us. I’m afraid they’ll blame me for their family’s pain. For not being faster to stop him. But most of all, I’m scared you’ll leave me.”
“He destroyed it and punished me when I got upset. I never saw the nanny again. Mity, the house elf watched after me.”
Draco frowned thoughtfully. He hadn’t really considered it before. It was just something that happened. Yet he never let anyone else touch his wand, would have never left it on the potion desk next to anyone else’s, for them to pick up. He couldn’t share a civil word with the bloke but had never had a problem just grabbing Potter’s wand and using it. Criminy they were messed in the head.
“Andromeda told me about it, can you imagine?” Molly’s face twisted with a scowl, “that woman was to be looking after them and this happens. Ridiculous.” She looked down to her tea cup, turning it left and right for a few moments, before she said quietly to it. “I know Harry and Ginny had broken up but I had thought, you know, perhaps, maybe they would reconnect this year.” She sighed sadly and shook her head, “But now he’s gone and tied himself to the Malfoy boy. I had no idea, just none. All Harry did was rant about that boy. He was ob,” Molly stopped abruptly, her eyes wide, “oh,” the word puffed from her lips.
“Guys-Guys!” Neville called out, finally hushing the crowd milling around the room. He pointed out the window he stood in front of, “look.” He held his ground, not allowing himself to be shoved aside, though he made room for his wife under his arm. He wasn’t surprised to see Hermione and Pansy at the forefront.
Harry felt the stares of the whole group. Thankfully they had to take breaks from staring at him to stare at Malfoy. The kids of either side of them not so discretely moved their chairs further from them, which suited Harry just fine. He sighed as he dropped into his seat.
Tawy nodded, “I think I have the fix for that,” she pulled a purple potion from the table, “in fact let’s start with that one, open up dear.”
Her smile was playful and genuine but there was steel and a protectiveness underneath that wasn’t and Charlie found his own laughter strained in reaction.
He took the drink and, not as trusting, took a small sip then a larger one. He tried to take another, but Helen traded it for another potion. “You can have more after this next set of potions.” Draco took the potion. She looked to Tawy. “We’re not really going to put him back into those stuffy clothes, are we?” She made a face at Draco’s expensive shoes, which had to be the most uncomfortable things she’d ever seen.
He went back to the barrister’s missive and the folders they’d sent of likely candidates.  There was a chance even after Draco was released to Hogwarts, if they were released, though it sounded most likely, that he would not be able to communicate with him. It sounded as if there were hopes they wouldn’t be able to communicate Draco full stop.
Teddy thought carefully about what to show them. He steered clear of the gossip and fan pages, then immediately thought of the first thing and clicked the favorite tab.
Harry leaned over and pulled Draco back until their eyes met. “Lucius walked around a battlefield unarmed to find you and Narcissa lied to Voldemort’s face to protect you. They love you even if they are shit at showing it and have the parenting sense of a, Hermione what’s an animal that has really bad parenting skills,”
Another Healer stuck her graying head around the doorway, seeing them and Tawy’s come-in gesture, she moved swiftly into the room. “We don’t have a file of any kind for young Malfoy here, just what Madam Pomfrey has sent over.”
“Really?” Ella replied. “I didn’t know if that was true. That’s so cool!” She smiled at him daintily, flipping back her long black hair.
Shacklebolt stood, “With your permission Your Honor,” and given a judicial nod, he turned to Andromeda, “are you saying the Ministry knowingly left a child in an abusive environment?”
Draco wanted to try sooner rather than later, “better to know now if we have to try something else,” he whispered to Harry as they followed the group towards the library.
Behind her something crashed. She thought quickly, hoping to put off any real physical damage. “Let me ask a question, if someone loves you for what they want you to be, do they really love you?”
Harry chuckled with a shrug, cause that might have even been true. He didn’t offer to tell them how that had happened and was happy they didn’t ask. It wasn’t something he liked to think about, well it sorta wasn’t. “We also had to be partners in nearly every class we shared, every-damn-year. I don’t know how often one of us grabbed the wrong wand from the table and used it to adjust something.”
Mandy shrugged with a scowl. “Oh come on. We didn’t even say anything that bad. Everyone feared them, that’s a fact. It’s my turn, I wanna know how you broke that privacy shield?”
The new comers bustled by and took chairs at the circle. Ben scowled but turned towards the chairs as well. “Yes, Healer Murphy.”
She waved a hand at the port key. “The Ministry.” A part of her wanted to lower her tone even if she knew the whole Burrow was furious with the Ministry and wouldn’t reprimand her.
“Of course,” Kingsley replied calmly in response to Molly’s raising ire. He tapped the paper and made three copies, offering the first copy to Malfoy, who handled it to his solicitor. The second copy to Mrs. Tonks and then the last to Molly, who immediately keyed onto the document.
Tawy gestured for Andromeda to sit and sat down at the table across from her, “before you go, I’d like to discuss how this will be handled with you.”
“That’s a very kind offer. Thank you.” She wasn’t sure what exactly was making them so nervous so started with. “I’m not angry. That’s what the room is for. We are fully funded, repairs have already been made.” She sat on Harry’s bed. “I’m so proud of you both.”
Pansy closed her eyes and took several calming breaths, “I can’t, wait,” she dug into her pocket and handed Hermione a beaten and folded parchment, “Here, I just, this was delivered to my house, what’s this going to do to Draco?”
Ben nodded. “He’s right,” Rey grinned at the unexpected back-up until Ben smirked, “we should get them a mellow high.”
They looked confused. Teddy took pity and pulled the cards from his back pocket. “You look better than you did on these. He handed Harry the Harry card and Draco his. They looked for a moment then switched cards.
She left and Tawy reached into her robes. “I know I told you to stay away from wizarding places, but just in case.” She pulled out their wands. “It’s against the rules but take them and only use them if you absolutely have to. The minute you use them the ministry will know exactly where you’re at. Things might get sketchy from there. Understand?”
“It has to do with un-nesting the strands of a spell. It took Dumbledore a year to drill it into me. I doubt I could teach anyone else.” Draco answered. They had promised to answer the questions, not that they would like the answers.
Rey shut the door on the girls’ questions and another room appeared at the back of the wardrobe.  It was pretty much as Harry expected. Though Ben seemed awfully disappointed neither of them was that impressed.
“Is that?” One of the girls started but was hushed by the boy as Rey held the door and Ben hurried them along.
Harry made to stand, but Draco was already on his feet, and Hermione grabbed his arm, “he’s fine Harry, don’t bring any more attention to it.”
Draco had always thought he’d be overjoyed to be known as ‘powerful’. Someone different, someone to be ‘feared’ but he found reality left a bitter taste in his mouth. ‘Different’ was something he no longer wished to be. It certainly didn’t make him better. He’d had his fill of it, alone, hiding in his closet while madness reined around him. He didn’t want to be feared or hated or anything really, but perhaps forgotten. Change had been hard for him, some lessons so excruciating he couldn’t even function half the time. Going back to who he’d been was impossible even if he’d wanted to. He heard Harry pronounce the article nothing and maybe the other’s believed him, but Draco heard the tremor in his voice and felt him lean closer. This wasn’t nothing. He missed Uncle Sev more than ever. Draco was certain he’d know what to do.
“Merlin, we aren’t symbols,” Harry pulled Draco from his seat, hugging him all the tighter, “We aren’t heroes. We were so scared all the time.”
Draco leaned down to grab the last bit of his papers when someone sent an incendio, burning the papers to ash before he could grab them. Draco growled and stood, “Fuck it, I’m done.” He threw down his bag and the room watched with bated breath as he stormed the doors and left the Great Hall.
Even after their time there, Mandy was the only one the group who really spoke to them. The rest stood around awkwardly, sometimes adding something to what Mandy said, but never really talking directly to them.
Fumeurs waved off the solicitor and raised a privacy shield, behind which they spoke furiously between themselves for a few moments before lowing it. “It is so agreed. The accused are found guilty and their custody of said child restricted. They are fined 5 Million gallons to be awarded to His Grace, Duke of Black.”
me get his wand, as he hardly put up a fight and I’ve fought him enough times to know.” He looked between Ron and Hermione, “Dumbledore wanted to give Malfoy another chance with his last breath. He tried to stop Crabbe and Goyle. He’s had some pretty impossible choices.” He dropped the chips back onto his plate, “I just don’t know.”
“Harry, Draco, glad I caught you.” Tawy swiftly cut around a nurse and towards them. She stopped in front of them with a wide grin on her face, “Just some last-minute stuff.” They’d already thanked her, but Harry did again, just in case she was thinking of changing her mind, but she waved it off. “You’ll probably need some money. Muggle clothes you know, the t-shirt and pants you wear in here will get you to a store. Draco have you ever been to a muggle shop?”
The Malfoy’s solicitor quickly overlooked the new document and drew up a privacy shield around himself and his clients. “If you fight this, they will find new charges to levee against you. They’ll tie you up in the courts for years. They will find a way to take every dime you have and put you both in Azkaban. Regardless to any of that, they will take custody of Draco and if they manage to place either of you in Azkaban. Neither of you will ever be able to gain rights to him again. If you sign him over now, your parental rights will not be terminated.” Narcissa shook, tears in her eyes as her husband, with a shaky hand, signed.
“Done?” Harry asked, Malfoy nodded, and Harry tapped the tray 3 times. Malfoy stood and Harry followed, saying to his back. “I, ah, have nightmares, um, so if I wake you, yeah, sorry. Just uh, ignore me, if you can.”
Violet measured them. “Alright.” She looked them over with a smile. “I’m guessing the shops first.” She looked around them. “You didn’t bring anything?”
Harry looked away from her and then back to the room at large, “no one then, all right that’s just us.” Harry looked around and tried to catch the eyes of students who’d lost parents in the war and softly, kindly asked, “is there anyone here who wouldn’t do anything to save their parents?” He looked to Hermione last, the girl who had erased herself from her parent’s minds to save them.
She didn’t play stupid. “I am very practiced in the nature of applied healing. There is absolutely nothing wrong with either of you and no damage. Whoever made the specific healing potion was very talented.” Harry looked particularly saddened at the mention of the potion’s creator and Draco downright distraught. She guessed it was Master Snape and refrained from asking. She sighed softly. “You have to remember none of this is your fault.” She stood and tucked her chair away. “Perhaps we could stay out of that particular group, if I knew you were talking it out somewhere. Maybe you could try speaking to each other or even the notebooks.” She waited but neither boy said anything. They didn’t look particularly overwhelmed or upset but Harry was looking at Draco. She bid them goodnight and took their half-hearted replies.
They nodded, and she moved onto Draco’s wrist continuing, “You’ll eat in the cafeteria today. Please go, don’t make me escort you. The staff will give you a shake with some nutritional potions. If nothing else, drink those. There we go,” she patted his wrist and didn’t seem offended when Draco yanked away. “Sorry about that.” She apologized as she backed away. She’d seen their breakfast tray and, though she was happy they’d taken their potions, she wished they’d eaten more. She hoped lunch went a little better. “Alright, ready to go?”
“They were heroes.” Harry had worked long and hard to clear their names and to put them in the statuses they deserved. He hadn’t known they’d given Duke of Black to Draco. So he’d chosen the highest title he was told was available Marquess of Black. Not that it mattered, Sirius wouldn’t have wanted any of them. Just as Snape would’ve been plenty pissed about the Marquess of Prince awarded to him. Harry imaged both men would have plenty to say about the accolades poured onto them posthumous. It amused him greatly to imagine it actually. One of his favorite daydreams.
“No, I’m giving you a safe place to heal. Somewhere we can help you,” She moved closer, hands still open, “help, not control. Let you breathe.”
Sentez pulled Vos towards the door, he was eager to get started. There was nothing he liked better than kicking deserving arse. Vos shrugged his hand off at the door, “Tawy.”
Stunned, Minerva leaned back into her chair. She blinked and took a deep breath, “we didn’t have a choice Healer Robertoun.”
Harry leaned into him, wrapping an arm around him, “It was a nightmare, it’s not your fault.” His eyes rose to Tawy, “thank you for not letting those people,” he stopped, biting his lip and looking away, “I didn’t mean to get so upset, but,”
“Sirius Black,” Harry offered, he glanced at Draco, “and Severus Snape.” Harry saw the names sparked recognition and uneasiness.
Mandy looked up and sure enough the warning light was flashing. She glanced down and saw her bracelet blinked red with the destination of room. She knew her band would notify a member of staff if she didn’t head that way. Fortunately, she had to pass Potter and Malfoy’s room, where, she was betting, the alarm had started. She wasn’t sure what they had planned to do with the knife but they’d obviously done it.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Well knock yourself out until I can find someone resembling a licensed hairdresser to cut it off.”
Tawy leaned against the desk and maintained a front of listening to Kingsley and the Judge, while watching her wards/patient’s say their goodbyes. The Malfoy’s were regal and icy, but she noticed how they clutched Draco closely under the pretense of advice. Potter’s crew was much more obvious in their affections teary hugs and promises. Draco joined her first, quietly standing to her side, not drawing any attention to himself. She could see the slight tremor in his hands, though he faced straight ahead and looked unbothered. Soon after, Harry pulled himself over to them. Tawy excused herself from the Minister and Judge, before Mrs. Weasley could approach again. She pulled an old quill from her pocket, “grab on boys”, and activated the Ministry sanctioned portkey.
She waved it off. “Not a problem boys. Mandy said you had nowhere to go and wanted out. Glad to be of help. Now we have to get going if we’re going to make the tube.”
There were no real serious charges leveled against Narcissa, and since she was never marked as a death eater there were no memory archives taken. So, she, as a
Ginny jumped up from her seat, shocked and worried. Hell she’d be as friendly with Malfoy as Harry wanted as long as he never looked like that again. She moved towards the door as Hermione and Ron joined her, half their house and then the school followed.
Harry nodded, feeling about the same, everything was far away, almost ignorable. He slouched further into the beanbag.
Tawy entered with a smile and a tray, from which she took-up a vial, before handing the whole off to Helen. “Alright Draco, this is a short sleep draught, some the diagnostic spells require a sleep state to get more accurate results.” She looked down, shaking the potion for readiness.
Then there was parlay that had been reached with the French government, a reprise of all punishments whenever they visited. Harry thought they’d probably move to France.
Tawy folded the parchment while speaking, “it was his magic trying to heal him which stopped things from getting dire. As you know he has been documented by Hogwarts’ testing,”
Tawy waited until after their evening snack and just before lights out. She found them in their room, sitting on their beds, looking miserable. “I hear you two have had a productive day.”
He nodded with as much dignity as he could pull together and gently perched on the edge of the bed. He took the potion and decided waiting was only delaying the inevitable, he tipped the potion quickly back. It was strong, stronger than he was used too. His arm dropped as his upper body followed, unable to control his decent as he dropped into a peaceful and deep sleep.
Harry recognized the voice and turned to see George bustling from around the building, the redhead waved as he ran up, “came in at the backyard, thought I’d missed you,” he huffed, “sorry.” He hugged Harry tightly.
Draco’s eyes widened, blood magic. He’d never seen blood magic performed and watched every stroke, memorized every word. He knew blood magic was more about feelings and desires than actual words, but he committed the whole thing to memory all the same.
“Not happening.” Harry stood at the same time as Malfoy, who turned to look at the shield as Harry faced the Healer.
Harry congratulated himself at not chuckling and then did anyway. Their fear of Draco really amused him. He couldn’t help it. “What?” Harry noticed what was left of the joint cold between his fingers.
Judge Fumeurs nodded tiredly. “It is so noted Madam Healer. Please continue with a brief summary of the young man’s health.”
Harry sighed and dropped his head, though he didn’t let Draco go. “My mom sacrificed her life for me in one big save. But after her no one loved me again until Hermione and Ron. No one stood between the monsters and me. Maybe your mum worked on little saves because she was afraid if she gave you a big save, she’d never be able to save you again.”
The door opened and then bounced as H.A. Deana’s hip bumped against it. “Hey boys, snack time. I told Tawy about what you said Harry, about getting some muggle stuff for Draco to try, and she was all about it. So, I’ve got some interesting stuff.”
Siri brushed back his mess of light brown hair and smiled kindly. “About a school maybe?” Siri looked to Sev, sitting next to him, and still picking at his cake.
She held out the chain, Harry looked at it doubtfully, but Draco took it from her hand. He looked it over. “It’s too long to be a bracelet and too short to be a necklace, an anklet? Why would he?” He looked to Harry.
Harry rolled his as well. It looked like they weren’t going to outright say anything. He leaned in and whispered to Draco.
“What? Really?” She didn’t know what to say. Normally she’d try to talk someone out of marrying so young, but she’d never seen Harry so happy, and after everything he deserved some happiness.
Harry would recognize that prick Smith’s voice anywhere. He clasped his hands behind his back, “I have been told that not even most adults can cast a strong cruciatus or imperius. I’ve also been told that the cruciatus was taught and used here while I was gone, largely to lackluster results. Most students were unable to create the curse and those who did were very weak, of which you should all be proud.” He looked around the room, “Bellatrix once told me you have to mean to cause pain, but she wasn’t quite right.” Harry eyes took a faraway glazed look, “sometimes all you have to do is fear the outcome more if you don’t. Sometimes you have to do horrible things because the alternative is even worse.” Harry shook his head, and offered a smile that was worse than the previous. “I’m told that both Malfoy and I are very talented with both pieces of dark magic. The first time I used the cruciatus, Mad-Eye Moody said I was a good boy and gave me chocolate frog,” he looked up, trying to pull back from the memory, “he was so impressed because the man had broken over a hundred of his own bones while trying to get away from me.” Harry smirked, “they said I had to teach them to fear me, isn’t that right Headmistress?”
Mandy waited for them at the bottom of the stairs. Her eyes wide as Violet whistled. “Mates when I said you cleaned up well, I didn’t know the half of it.” She turned to Mandy, “Are they famous for modeling?”
She greeted Harry with a warm hug, thankful he didn’t refuse her. He’d been so angry the last she’d seen him. He didn’t seem angry with her now. As soon as she released him, he returned to the Malfoy boy as if he’d been drawn there. She finally acknowledged the last boy by dipping her head deeply, “your Grace,” let it not be said that they didn’t have knowledge of decorum.
“Thank Merlin,” the door slammed into the wall so hard that Tawy had to put up an arm to stop it from swinging back at her.
Draco glanced Harry’s way again, the other boy gave him a small nod of encouragement and a mental push of reassurance. Draco put the sunglasses on with as much daring as he could gather.
“He’ll touch you, if he trusts you. He has to be sure about it and then he’ll touch you. He doesn’t like anyone touching him first or in his space.” Hermione explained.
She knew they were right but thought about trying anyway. She left them with the promise to deliver their dinner herself and that they wouldn’t be disturbed.
Draco was exceedingly happy his family could afford a private potion’s brewery, ingredients, and storage.
Harry blinked and looked up and up, Malfoy Manor. The place looked the same and yet, not. Still he wasn’t quite ready to charge the gates. Harry glanced towards Draco and tightened his grip on the other boy. Draco’s eyes were wide and frightened, his skin bloodless. “Draco.”
Charlie wasn’t sure how but Hermione and Ron had been halfway to the door before the knock had sounded.
Tawy asked some more questions or made comments but mostly just listened. She tapped his hand, when he realized he’d been quiet a little while and looked up from his forest. She smiled at him, “Thank you Harry. I’m going to talk to Draco now, you just keep working ok?”
Andromeda nodded her acceptance as she smoothly answered, “Which is why I am asking you not to force me into another. Draco should have been under my care years ago and by fulfilling my injunction you are righting a great miscarriage of justice.” Andromeda looked around the Wizengamot, who by now had all had a chance to read her parchment. It seemed she was not talking to an unreceptive audience. There were many who seemed very amenable to her words, nodding along as she spoke.
They paused, and Draco quickly called out. “We forgot our journals. We were going to go get them first.” Draco was not looking forward to hashing out whatever it was Tawy wanted to dig out of him and could only imagine Harry felt the same way as he nodded along to Draco’s words.
“Nope.” He glanced frequently at Draco, who got the second soda and tried the crisps. “We’re not that all-powerful you know.”
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand and flooded him with love just to watch the pleased blush spread across Draco’s face.
Harry glanced round and figured the 60’s by the faded yellow posters. “I have a friend with a talent for making small things much bigger than they appear.”
“I’m sure. You two are blinking and I’m not. I’m not going to get stopped, you are and if you’re caught with that when we’re with you, I’m sure, give.”
Ben didn’t seem to know how to react, looking between them. “Oh, come on, I just want to know. Mandy says no one can hold the crucio that long.”
Teddy did notice that every few seconds both Hermione and Neville would glance over as if to make sure Draco and Harry were still there.
Harry jumped from his bed eager for something, but the door opened before his feet were on the floor. A woman stuck her head in the room, “Oh good, you’re still awake. You both looked so knackered I wasn’t sure.” She leaned back, “They’re still up,” she turned from the door, leaving her foot in the room, “yeah give me theirs. They get, yeah that one.” She turned back, pushing the door with her foot and carrying a tray. “Okay boys, we got a little bit of everything here.” She carried the tray to the table. “Take the potions first. Please eat as much as you can huh, supposed to put some weight on you two.”
“Suffer cause she sneaks in the good stuff too Rey. Keep it up and I won’t share.” Mandy didn’t even look up from one of the newest magazines hidden on her lap. “Listen here, the last bloke on trial said Draco Malfoy was the Dark Lord’s torturer. The mag says the judge wouldn’t even hear it and rightfully so, according to them. The judge sentenced the bloke to Azkaban.”
Harry didn’t answer. He stared at her for a moment before he slumped and tightened his hold on Draco. “Oh, fuck Draco. My aunt, cousin, and uncle hate me. Like really hate me, no matter what I do. She once kicked me because I called her mum by mistake. I can’t even pretend they liked me even a little bit. I know family hate and I promise, you could turn into a glow worm and Narcissa Malfoy would still love you.”
After sentencing there was a pause as the court official returned and spoke in soft tones to the Judge’s. Within the courtroom, people whispered furiously to each other and the reporters worked furiously to keep their public satisfied. The Malfoy’s conferred with their solicitors.
She believed him, whatever he was sorry about, he really was. She ached to comfort him, he looked so wounded, but she left it to Harry as he seemed to have the job well in hand.
Hermione rolled her eyes even as she grinned, proud of her other best friend. They might not be dating anymore but that didn’t change the fact that she loved him dearly and always would.
“There are two more. There was just a slight confusion about what was acceptable to a muggle club.” Hermione looked pained.
Helen and Tawy both laughed, while Helen handed him the soda, “Everyone says that. Chase it down with a bit of this.”
Thank you so much for the encouragement. I am several chapters ahead and the feedback really helps me not to get discouraged. You are fantastic for helping out.
After the war it became ‘fashionable’ to have been involved in the war effort. Most pretended their involvement had been more than hiding in their home and hoping Harry Potter took care of it.
Draco frowned, most powerful wizards in generations, where had that nonsense come from? It might be true of Potter. Likely Draco’s own addition was the creation of an overzealous reporter. He glanced at Potter, who looked confused. Draco sighed. He wasn’t charging that hill.
The muggle seat did not lend itself to getting up quickly, but Draco managed and brought Harry along with. He staggered under the strain of holding himself in check. Harry stood but wavered and groaned softly, trying to hold tightly.
She stopped moving and stared at him in disbelief, “what do you mean? About what? About taking up with Malfoy of all people? I thought we were only on a break. I thought we,” her words dwindled off as she took in Harry’s face, “and you didn’t?”
. Apparate to the manor. Run with his parents to Paris, where the Ministry would have no choice but to leave them be.
Draco brought his heel up onto his chair and put the anklet on, it flashed slightly then, nothing. After a few moments, he put his foot back onto the floor. “I guess we’ll see what good ol’ da’s up to sooner or later.”
Harry looked to Seamus, “I imagine you would have too, had you had his family or been given as many potions as Malfoy had, and then held down by your own father, while Greyback held your mother in his arms.”
Tawy threw up her hands and walked from the group and towards them, some of the group following. Harry didn’t recognize any of them. He quickly swapped wands with Draco, not even looking at the other boy as he did, for watching the incoming people. He turned so Draco was behind him, wand clenched in his hand. “He didn’t mean to. It was an accident.” Harry called to Tawy as soon as she was close enough.
Draco shrugged. “I don’t really remember. I think it was worthless. I only played with it when father asked.” Draco picked a black marker, “I don’t think it was a real game.”
George loosened his hold and stepped back. “Sorry, I’m in the middle of developing some new things for the shop.” It was partly true. He looked past Harry to Draco and Tawy, he nodded towards Tawy, but stepped closer to the other boy. “Hey Draco, you doing alright?” His hand hoovered about shoulder level but didn’t touch.
“They know all the unforgivables but didn’t know until last week how to cast a snowball. I want them to play. I want them to laugh and not juggle literal life and death. It’s of the utmost importance that the other children do not overwhelm them. Bully Draco or hero Harry too much. Harry will react if Draco’s attacked and I’m not sure what that reaction would be exactly, but it would be swift and likely petrifying for the recipients. Harry does not know how to react normally to that type of stress. His reaction, would set Draco off, and Draco’s stopping point is way beyond what a child bully or even most adults could tolerant.”
Belinda closed her eyes for a moment, casing her memory, trying to grab…she’d seen this before, she paused and slowly opened her eyes, “If you’d asked me a year ago, I could have told you nothing of this sigil. Except that it was featured in some history books and that no one living had this mark, however this summer I categorized this very sigil.”
Mandy left Violet and wandered their way, she saw Draco shutter and smiled. “Not the stuff His Grace is used to is it?”
Harry didn’t think he looked nearly as good as Draco, but the clothes fit, and they felt nice, which was good enough for him. He decided to wear out the dark blue jeans and a navy t-shirt. The shoes were soft and felt so good, Harry vowed to never buy cheap shoes again. Draco had also picked out some clothes for the club and some for tomorrow, it all looked good, so he brought it out. “Perfect Draco.”
“Well it sucks.” Harry told her. “They all thought they had more rights to us than we did to ourselves.”
He didn’t even shift from where he leaned against the headboard. Instead Draco ran his fingers through the dark strands of Harry’s hair. He marveled at how very pale his fingers were, like white sticks in black ink. He’d never been tan, but once he’d at least been healthy looking, another thing taken from him.
Harry frowned. He’d forgotten about the whole new year of students. “Damn.” At Hogwarts the other kids wouldn’t have any real fear to keep them in check. They’d feel free to attack Draco. Harry frowned, well that wasn’t on, he’d have to put that to rights as soon as he got back.
“Yeah.” Harry smiled back, but then Draco moved his leg away and he frowned until Draco moved it back. He pressed back and felt better as Draco moved closer and not away. Ella frowned as she looked between them, but Harry couldn’t give a damn less.
They ended up at a wizard fish and chip, a short walk from the Ministry, though it seemed everyone else had the same idea and the place was filled to the rafters. Ron looked the crowd over with despair and whaled, “we’re never going to eat and get back in time.”
Draco glanced at a clock, he hadn’t even noticed and Harry looked just as clueless, “Our apologizes,” he managed to sound if he hadn’t just sprinted up.
Once they got closer, Ron’s bluster lost its sail. Hermione, without thought, rested her hand on Pansy’s arm. “What’s happened?”
Still Harry wasn’t able to hide his relief when it was time to leave. Though he felt bad. Draco needed more than platitudes and afternoon small-talk from his parents but Draco didn’t know how to ask and Harry didn’t know how to direct him.
Harry stiffened and looked around. He recognized that voice from their group. They were at a table on the other side of one the nearer bookshelves. At first, he couldn’t see where they were, but then he caught a glimpse of black hair. He found if he leaned back and then moved over a little, because Draco shoved him, they could see the table through a narrow space between two book shelves.
“Release him,” barked a razor-sharp command from the Healer, which froze everyone. She walked towards the Auror still gripping Draco, “I said
“Out of all the students, the two of them always had the oddest reactions to things. One could never tell what might set them off.”
She listened for a few minutes before saying. “Minister, do you have any idea the amount of damage this could do, to them, to anyone else who is mentioned further down the line? Do you think this only happened the once during this war?”
Harry frowned. “So soon?” He wouldn’t be allowed time to say goodbye to the other Weasleys, his friends, or even get anything?
Harry nonchalantly watched as Malfoy looked his vials over as well and seemed just about as happy as he’d been that they weren’t labeled. They picked at their food in silence. Harry just wasn’t hungry. Just idea of being forced to meet other people. He pushed the food further away.
Draco doubted girl Weasley felt the same, but as Harry’s arms tightened around him, Draco didn’t care about her or her wants. Harry was his.
Judge Fumeurs nodded and waved for him to sit back down, “alright then, first things first.” He picked up a parchment. “Let us proceed with the new charges leveled against the defendants.”
“Good choice Draco.” Tawy smiled, as she slowly transfigured her chair into a pillow on the floor. “It does work much better down here.”
Harry shook his head amused. Where had Draco learned about soda, but then he remembered Tawy offering it to him between potions. He chuckled quietly to himself, if Draco was excited about caffeine-free organic soda. Harry couldn’t wait to introduce him to the real stuff one day. He paused as he realized he wanted to be the one to do that, show Draco real soda. It was strange.
“Pot? What were they doing in the kitchen? And what? The Dark Lord had a pot? What’s the trauma here?”
Ron, having vast experience with the levels of Hermione fury, sat back and let her at it. Though even he was impressed by her imagination.
They didn’t even need to walk around the house, as the house elf offered a hand and within moments, they were taking deep breaths of lily’s and narcissus.
“All the other children did not receive special instruction from the Headmaster or Master Snape.” The Judge replied.
“Madam Healer,” Judge Fumeurs started but didn’t get to finish as he was interrupted by Andromeda’s head solicitor, who had started gesturing frantically. Judge Fumeurs acknowledged him with a backhanded wave.
It had to be the most legalized, lengthy, and well covered document Molly had ever run across. It was insanity. It practically gave those boys to Robertoun with no by your leave or recourse and it allowed no room for wiggle or for Harry to be released until the Healer allowed it. She glared above the parchment. “This is preposterous. The Ministry cannot just give children to this woman! This isn’t custody –it’s ownership papers!”
Harry shrugged, while Draco’s eyes narrow. “Yes, now.” Draco crossed his arms. Potter had said this muggle weed was like a potion for wizards. Something that would help numb the pain. Draco wanted that right now.
Bill leaned back in his chair with a casual wave towards Draco’s shirt, “So Draco, a fan of Queen?” He thought the shirt was likely Harry’s. Bill was just trying to find a peaceful topic to keep Ron from feeling like he had to protect the kid from them. He wanted him to feel welcome, victim kicking was not something he did. Bill didn’t expect for Draco to not only know the band, but know enough to have a favorite song and discuss it. He found himself leaning forward and talking about other muggle bands, some Hermione hadn’t even heard of. As they were talking, Bill found himself looking for a quill to write down some of the bands Draco recommended, “Velvet Underground and the Ramones?” Bill questioned as he searched around the coffee table for a quill.
“Oh my god, that poor kid. And Harry?” She couldn’t believe the amount of trauma and pain that kid must be suffering, unbelievable.
Next to Harry, Ron hissed in aggravation with a muttered, ‘unbelievable’. Harry sighed. He had never really thought of Malfoy inheriting the Black title. It didn’t really bother him, as Sirius had been disinherited he’d never held it anyway. Harry turned as did everyone else towards the door. He noticed the reporters nearly salivating with want.
“That will not be a problem. Also don’t worry about feeding us, we’ll take care of that as well.” Draco smoothly added.
Harry felt the heartfelt smile bloom over his face, “You’re Susan’s great-grandfather,” he moved swiftly to shake the man’s hand even as he announced; “Susan is a brave woman, your honor.”
Ron leaned across Harry to Hermione. “Did you know he was a Marquis? That’s the same as a British Marquess right?” Ron mangled the French words so badly that even Harry flinched.
Ella nodded, “Right. Everyone knows you didn’t win it off him, but what no one understands is, how did you use it?”
Harry didn’t know where Draco had gone to, he had a 20 minute start, but McGonagall was in the Great Hall so he couldn’t have used her floo. He patted his pockets for the map, he had it somewhere.
“Is it true that you’re a master Occlumens?” Rey asked softly, he ducked a little when Draco looked his way. “I had heard, I wondered…” he trailed with a shrug.
Draco nodded, “Yes, Nirvana too,” he leaned forward and reached into his back pocket, “Here,” he offered a pen, “this will work.”
“I’m in a t-shirt,” Harry offered. He glanced to Draco, “if they don’t let us in. We’ll just find somewhere else.”
Harry recognized the giant of a wizard who followed Malfoy with a spread hand so large it made Malfoy look even more delicate. Vos seemed ready to catch the scion at the first sign of faltering. The huge wizard didn’t have to wait long, mid-way towards the front of the courtroom Malfoy miss-stepped, it was a tiny movement, but the courtroom went wild with whispers. Vos eased His Grace’s footing with a soft hand.
Rey rolled his eyes. “Yeah, the power and birthrights that almost destroyed them. I don’t think you’re really seeing the whole picture.”
Mandy moved over step and put her attention on Harry, “I don’t know, if you had your wands, could you transfigure one?”
Andromeda had been willing to approach Narcissa, but was willing to agree with the Healer as well, only because she didn’t believe Narcissa knew more. “If that’s all,” She made to leave though paused when Tawy shook her head.
Harry reached over and tapped Draco’s hand, coming back to himself, Draco ceased. “He’s no more a death eater than I am.” Harry didn’t care about what anyone else said if it made Draco stop looking like that.
Harry shook his head and looked to Teddy with a wiry smile. “So is it too late to ask how you feel about local schools?”
The only things Teddy had ever purchased were a couple of trading cards, one for Harry Potter and one for Draco Malfoy (they were easy to hide). He had studied the cards but could see very little of his brothers in the images. Maybe it was the changed hair colors or the missing sunglasses, which his brothers always wore out. Though Teddy thought it was mostly because Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy looked sad and larger than life, while Sev and Siri were his happy and goofy brothers. From what Teddy figured, they had finished their last year of school before the idea of them had spread. Teddy was glad. Neither liked to read anything about themselves and now there were whole classes dedicated to figuring them out. After they'd graduated, they had taken to traveling and while Teddy missed them, he loved the weird stuff they sent him. They also showed up for every holiday and his birthday, which meant they’d be here by dinner.
Draco nodded, and she pulled out the chain. “Your father gave me this, said to only deliver this into your hands only. If anyone else touched it before your hands, it would go back to him. I don’t know why, or what it’s been done to it. It’s got a ton of charms on it, doesn’t seem harmful.”
What annoyed Harry the most was that Draco caught on faster than he did. Harry forgave him though. As the first joint disappeared, it was hard to maintain even mock anger. He dropped his head back and looked up to where Draco leaned against the wall. Harry snapped his fingers up at him. “Hey give. And sit already.”
“Looks good on you though,” Pansy much preferred the ethereal healthy look to the previous look of desperation and agony she’d last seen on him. She’d nearly forgotten how beautiful Draco was.
And the who’s who of wizarding youth was all here. Mandy rolled her eyes, determined not to show any fleck of being any sort of star struck, she pointed.
Mandy jumped up. “We give them somewhere to blow you idiots.” She went for the door, “come on, follow me.” She swiftly brought them into the main room.
“Yeah, I know.” Harry interrupted, not making Draco say the name, which just the thought of had sent a tremor though Draco. “Why?”
“Moving on,” Murphy quickly curbed the topic of evil traits. “Who wants to talk about a trigger they’re working though?” He turned to Harry and Draco, “We’re talking about when bad memories are ‘triggered’ by sights, sounds, smells or even feelings. Triggers throw you into a bad memory and cause intense reactions, like a raised heart rate, sweating and panic.”
Draco listened carefully at the library doors but heard no one. He opened the door slightly and slipped in, slid against the wall and closed the door softly behind him. He didn’t see anyone but had the sense he wasn’t alone. He’d learned to trust that feeling and didn’t turn on any lights. He used the dim light from the early dawn that streamed through the shear part of the blue curtains to look around. He moved around one of the long shelves and spotted the dance of a candle’s light against a far wall. Draco would have never seen it, had he been taller or hadn’t come just this way. He nearly left.
She shrugged, “Perhaps, perhaps not, but we could have at least discussed it. Draco, are you alright?”
Draco folded the letter and looked around. It was a muggle room in a muggle house. He could leave, there were no wards to stop him. He had his wand. He could
“I can’t believe you’re here. What are you doing here?” He took Draco’s hand, squeezing softly, hoping to cut off Draco soft mutterings about Vane’s personage.
The next day fell right into their new routine. The kids didn’t sit any closer to them during the meeting, but that didn’t bother Harry. He could tell whoever got there last were stuck in the seats closest to him and Draco and would move their seats as far away as the circle allowed. He knew it amused Draco.
Harry blinked, shocked and hurt. He couldn’t believe Hermione would push him away, not the only person that never faltered when standing at his side. When she blinked, and he saw the tears in her eyes, he realized she must truly believe this would help. She wasn’t pushing him away this hurt her too. She leaned forward and hugged him quickly, “we love you.”
Draco scoffed. He doubted he’d enjoy meeting anyone. He glanced up and saw Potter looking rather non-pulsed by the idea as well.
Mandy glared at the redhead, “don’t tell me you wouldn’t want that kind of magic? Everyone would want it. Think of how much that magic would’ve helped us before we ever got here. Hell if we had that kind of power we wouldn’t be here!”
Ella’s eyes locked onto the blonde in question, “really a Duke?” She tilted her head. He was so pretty but, “Na, still too scary. Does it mention Potter’s title? I know he’s to claim one or two, is one of them Duke?”
“Maybe they’ll duel. So badass,” Ben announced, “think about it. We’ll have front row seats to watch the most powerful wizards in generations.”
Tawy leaned against a corner of the practice room. There was no way she was packing herself in with the ‘audience’. She hoped the masses would get bored and leave but she doubted it. There was just too much interest in Harry and Draco right now, the media couldn’t seem to get enough of them. The population’s interest had been fanned into flames and her staff was not immune. If she banned viewing, there’d only be speculation and rumors. More rumors and mystery were not something Harry and Draco needed. The only thing she could do was dim the observation room’s glass and make it harder for those in the room to see all those gawking.
“Time that I’ve got,” he sighed, “and it’s theirs. I guess, if anything, the other kids will get a sense of being happy it wasn’t them. Maybe it’ll help them overcome their own fears.”
The woman entered and one look was all Jeannie needed to know that the old-old Euro-money was no false rumor. They didn’t prescribe to the old fashioned robes here in Canada, everyone having long ago adapted to muggle clothes. So it stood to reason that, though genteel and graceful, the woman seemed a touch awkward in her designer suit. She was beautiful and her red hair was styled into a lovely French twist. Jeannie would have called it a cold beauty if not for her warm smile.
Charlie looked for something to break up the strong emotion and latched onto, “Ron you need a haircut,” he chuckled, as he tossed his own hair, “only one Weasley brother can pull off long hair.”
“Credit card, dear,” she corrected as she took the papers and tapped it against her hand. “Mandy’s sister is name Violet, if I recall correctly. She doesn’t know who you are and only the bare minimum has been explained to her. She does know you are not to go anywhere wizard.”
She watched them, between checking the door, people on the dance floor gave them room and watched them with interest. At first Harry had been pretty dismal but once he started moving with Draco he was pretty damn good.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I don’t know how to explain it. Dumbledore taught me.” He glanced to Draco, figuring Dumbledore had taught him as well, but unsure till Draco nodded to him.
“Principal McKay-Miller, your 2 o’clock is here.” Jeannie stood and quickly ran an eye over herself. She wanted to make a good first impression. From what she’d already heard this woman was old-old Euro-money and willing to make large donations to the school she chose. She wasn’t going to let Sharpe beat her out. She quickly tapped her phone, “send them in.” She waved her wand towards the door, which opened at her command, even as she moved to the front of her desk to greet them.
Tawy had said it would take time and Harry tried to convey that to the blond and while Draco nodded Harry knew he was hurt and disappointed.
Harry nodded slightly confused, “Yeah.” Several of the group whispered between themselves and Harry thought they sounded too shocked. What did they think happened in a war?
“You’re ridiculous,” But Draco bit back the smile as he said it, “Fine Potter, we’ll give them a show.” He pushed away from the wall.
Harry didn’t yank away, as long Draco held him, he had no fear of being pulled over the step. He patted her hand, “Maybe Romilda, but I think I was made for him,” he tilted his head towards Draco.
Mandy turned like everyone else. They didn’t look to sure and Mandy thought they looked a little ready for battle. She turned away.
Harry nodded. He understood, “If you think they would treat you badly. I wouldn’t let them.” If anyone was going to give Malfoy hell it was him and maybe Hermione and Ron, maybe. Mostly he didn’t want Malfoy to go to France.
Harry shook his head. “Draco we can’t shop all day. We’ve got to send the owl.” Since Mandy only had one owl, they decided to send it to Hermione and hope she could gather the others.
Everyone looked their way and Harry crossed his arms and looked down. Next to him, Draco scoffed. “Don’t look at me. I only died the once and it wasn’t because of an unforgettable.”
“Worthy, love you,” Harry mumbled back, mostly asleep, but he turned to look up at him, blinking the sleep away, “Draco, what is it?”
Lucius watched Narcissa write and went to the floor and swiped the chain from where it had fallen to the ground. “Send him my regards dearest.” He called out as he approached the girl and carefully did not smirk at her unease. He leaned down. “Ms. Parkinson, I would ask that you deliver this to my son and only into his hands. Tell him never to take it off. Do you understand?”
Harry scoffed, “how kind of you.” He got up and stretched, his body stiff for some reason, “here,” he offered a hand down to Draco.
“He’ll hurt himself trying to break free.” She added softly. She swallowed, “He doesn’t like to be touched. He won’t do anything vulgar, but he will flinch or move away from it, even mine.”
They followed behind Tawy, but as they walked, she slowed her pace until she was nearly between them, “anything I need to know about?”
Harry hugged him gratefully. Draco hugged him as well but whispered, “Movies? As in more than one, who played us?”
Tawy recognized the need to tread lightly here. However, she still needed to gather some information. She went to the Malfoy’s little group and cast a privacy bubble, while she didn’t care for either, acting as they had, they were her patient’s parents. She also enjoyed the way their solicitor had a fit at not being involved, quite amusing even if she couldn’t hear it. She looked to the mother, giving the father a glance, “I need to know what sets him off?”
“Yes, met them, charming boys,” she answered, ripping the top off her muffin. She didn’t have to look up to know Murphy rolled his eyes.
“Normally,” Healer Murphy began, “we'd start new members off with an introduction. However, in this case, I think we’ll skip that.”
If possible, the Healer’s glare darkened further at the sight of his father, but she didn’t say anything while the Auror let down the wards and passed over a parchment. Isaacs quickly read it over, “the court has ordered the younger Malfoy to be examined by a healer.”
He looked at her and whatever expression he saw was enough for him to continue. “My last nanny, she gave it to me. I didn’t know it was muggle. I really liked it. I would solve it and she would remix it up.” He grabbed up a yellow and coloured in some blocks, “Father found it.”
“What’s happened? Drinking? Drugs?” Tawy spoke to the viewing glass. She couldn’t see either of these boy’s as capable of losing control to this degree without help. They were just too tightly controlled to let this loose. As controlled as two unstable and powerful beings could be.
“Does that always happen when you get upset?” Ella looked between the corner and Harry. She wasn’t sure this sort of thing was worth the Potter name.
“Look Malfoy,” the brute male Auror barked, “it’s court ordered, so we’re taking the kid whether you agree or not.”
Harry boggled at the total, but Draco put it on his card without blinking. Harry vowed not to say a word, it was worth it for Draco’s happiness. He also vowed to pay Draco back half of the ridiculous amount. He dropped his new sunglasses over his eyes and followed Draco to Channel. Where he took another seat with Violet and Mandy. “It shouldn’t be long here.” Harry offered, as he took the drink offered to him.
Hermione sighed, it troubled her to keep something like this from him, but she couldn’t see what it would help. She folded the parchment, “I agree. We don’t give it to him.”
Ben looked up. Potter and Malfoy were nearly at their table. Maybe it was the idea of them or something but Ben would swear they moved more fluidly or powerfully. They just felt different somehow.
And when Harry felt raw and open, scooped out, every pain laid bare he added, “I was jealous when you hugged Pansy. She’s so confident and not fucked up and I,”
Tawy met her look with one of her own, serious and pointed, “Of course they’re dangerous. They’re wounded children, who were used as pawns and weapons for years. All that pain with a vast amount of power at their fingertips.” She shook her head, “Headmistress, until you suggested it, I had no intention of sending them back here. But you made some excellent points and I concede to them.”
Harry wanted to argue but decided with flash of thought that maybe Draco was right. Maybe he had been trying to give Draco the out he couldn’t have for himself. Damn they were fucked up, he shook his head.
Harry wanted to ask, looking around he could see the question on everyone’s face, but he didn’t, “Yes, that will work.”
Tawy stood, “You’ve both worked very hard during our time here so far and I appreciate it. I think we’re making real progress.  Don’t worry about wand time, you’ll both still be able to take part.”
She waved him off and when he stepped closer, she pulled away from his comfort. “No, it’s alright Harry,” she turned away tears welling up in her eyes, “just go back down. I need a minute.”
Harry leaned into the hug, tightly hugging George back, he could smell cigarettes and a hint of alcohol, but he wasn’t drunk as far as Harry could tell.
Harry followed him, until he broke away and bounced across from him. Harry struck a dramatic pose that was close but not his own dueling pose.
Molly had nothing to add and not to increase the woman’s anger, Tawy relented. She thanked them and released the bubble, crossing the room to collect her wards. She found them quietly sitting, Draco examining his wand. They both quickly reacted to her summons. Draco tucked his wand away, perhaps thinking the Judge might take it again if reminded he held it.
Harry couldn’t help but see his disappointment. “It wasn’t a movie. It was everyone you loved hurting. It was being so filled with pain and fear, every moment that they could die in front of you.”
Tawy thrust the potion to Helen and approached him with her hands raised. “Draco it’s alright. You don’t have to take the draught, we have other options,” her voice was musical with calm soft influxes, “Can you tell me why you don’t want to take it?”
At this moment, he wasn’t angry with Molly. That might change though. Tawy said he was getting better, but he’d never felt so out of control. Sometimes he was numb and other times overwhelmed with rage, about nothing and everything. He tried to put certain emotions where he thought they should go…but it didn’t always work or even stay as he thought it should. Somethings he knew he should angry about and he just wasn’t, even when he told himself to be and other things, little things, just set him off. Some days he craved the numbness.
It also became fashionable to need therapy to deal with it all. Open therapy groups, one of the newest ideas taken from the muggle world. Hand in hand with the new vogue to embrace anything muggle. Especially if you happen to be a pureblood.
It eyed both he and then Draco, and gave Draco a small smile, bowing quickly, “Masters, ma’am, sirs, I am to direct you to the back garden.”
Harry looked around the circle. Every face was filled with shock and horror. Ella was crying softly. The others looked so far out of their depth. He tapped Malfoy’s hand, pleased when Draco blinked and look at him.
Hermione nodded, somewhat deflated, as that knowledge is what upset her most of all. “And you’ve tried more owls?”
They all turned to see more reporters trying to mash in with the ones who’d been there since the beginning. The reporters ate their lunch where they worked, unwilling to leave and they were making it hard for the new comers to find places. Some of them even sounded foreign, French and American accents fighting with a London paper for a ‘prime’ place.
Draco wasn’t too sure about the cab, but Violet spoke to them about where she worked and invited them along. Which stopped Draco from focusing on the thought of the cab crashing into something. Then Harry began pointing things out and explaining them. Draco got into the spirit of it and started pointing out things that he wasn’t sure about.
Tawy moved away from the desk and towards a door to the side. “Here we go boys, hash it out in here. No magic please and I’ll be right with you.” Harry paused even as Draco stood and she turned back to him. “You’ll be able to say goodbye before we leave.”
“I am Barrister Heidi Killsmen at your service. By the time we’re done, not only will Ms. Granger be freed and able to leave, but so will her family, and a kola for your troubles, should you like.”
Mandy moved her tray and used it to hide the magazine she put onto the table. “Malfoy, Duke of Black.”
Hermione nodded and returned her attention to the mess before them. They’d all volunteered to help the Headmistress. Mostly able to do very well, but setting up their own housing arrangements was proving to be harder than most things. It was one of the last things to complete as well. The school was repaired, cleaned, and nearing the final preparations. She glanced around their new common room. It was lovely, even if she did say so herself, as she’d done much of the work once given the room. It held a bold, but classy mix, of house colors and comfortable furniture. The excitement swelled within her. She couldn’t wait to immerse into school life again.
“We’ll discuss that at a later date. I will send owls when any type of contact is sanctioned.” Tawy replied.
Rey looked mortified they’d heard. Clara blushed and dropped her head. Mandy didn’t bother hiding the article she was reading about them. “Do what?”
Harry looked the chain over as well. “Up to you Draco. I’m not going to tell you not to trust Lucius, you know him better than I do.”
situation. They’re infamous,” The man shook his head as he looked towards the door, “looks like the press has found out.”
Draco grabbed his wrist before Harry could even finish standing. Harry scowled at Draco as the blonde shook his head. “Wait Potter. You can get righteous in a moment.”
Harry shrugged, darted forward and kissed him. “Yes, because every time I see people get frightened, I remember you’re as hard to hurt as I am. You’re my equal. I pretend to be your hero, but I know if I don’t catch you, you’ll find a way to save yourself.”
Mandy stomped her foot. “They can’t just rip shields apart with their bare hands. They had to have something.”
Judge Fumeurs nodded to woman, “The court thanks you Healer, if you would please announce yourself for the record.”
Draco wished he could think of something to stall but there was nothing for it. He followed Potter and the woman out. When they reached the hall, light blue arrows appeared over the floor. The Healer smiled, “They you go boys, your schedules are the same, so you’re set.”
She nodded, understanding coming to her. She paused thoughtfully for a moment. “Small spaces. He doesn’t like them. Lemon, the smell, the taste, upsets him greatly.”
She nodded. “Maybe not. If you would be amendable, I would like to speak with you both every day, starting next week?”
He looked to Ron and Hermione. Ron didn’t seem very hopeful and they both looked to Hermione, who bit her lip, not a very comforting gesture.  She frowned sadly. “Siphoning is serious business Harry. It means someone’s been taking your magic. It’s important you fix this,” and thinking of Harry’s nightmares added, “and maybe the other stuff too.” Though she didn’t say it, Hermione recognized the position they were in, trapped within the Ministry. They couldn’t afford for Harry to lose control if they ever wanted him back.
“No, he couldn’t have known,” someone exclaimed and several variances of the same rose around the room.
Harry turned. Draco was wearing the identical thing but all in black. He’d only buttoned three of the middle buttons and the sleeves were rolled to his elbow. He looked, “You look bloody fantastic.”
Draco’s eyes widened with shock but, unable to ignore his manners, he mumbled, “thank you”. It had been awhile since anyone had said he was attractive in any manner, without following it up with some lewd behavior.
Mandy quickly climbed the stairs. She was careful not to cross over, she grabbed his arm, held it over the first step, and leaned in, “take a breath Jamison. They aren’t going to kill you,” she leaned in closer and whispered. Still looking terrified, the boy nodded and took off as soon as he was released. Mandy turned back to them, “now we give him five and hope he doesn’t have a panic attack between here and there and forget what he was doing.”
Mandy took her hand, swinging it, leaning forward and whispering to her. “Violet they’re loaded and really famous in our world. So we gotta get going before more wizards show up around here.”
“So he was just telling me.” Healer Tawy turned back to the armoire as the other woman moved closer.
Harry had frozen once he’d wrapped his arms around the other boy. He didn’t hug people, but as Draco relaxed so did Harry. “I know it will help.” Harry said with conviction as he leaned back and finished the new braid just as there was a knock on the door. Harry had barely called out before Tawy looked around the door.
“We could start by trying to hang out with them. Then later invite them to a game of 20 questions, pass it around and get to the real questions.” Ella flipped her hair. “Take our time and that way we can work up to the real stuff.”
Harry snorted, “must be.” He was sitting in the dark, shoulder to shoulder with the guy and they were going to need each other, “Call me Harry.”
“She did.” Teddy clicked to the next site. “Here’s one of the memorials, this one is on Hogwarts’ grounds.”
Harry shook his head, “Ginny, I told you we weren’t meant to be together. You asked and I said no, I thought I was very clear.”
Harry leaned back, nasty smelling, mistaken for tea? He tilted forward in his chair. “Weed?” Seemed the most likely.  Draco tugged on his sleeve and Harry could see his confusion and could almost hear his complaints about having anything to do with a weed. Harry shook his head. “I’ll explain in a second.”
Harry was nearly vibrating next to him and Draco took a hit of the joint and handed it to him. He watched Harry inhale, before looking back to her. “Is there something you want us to say?” His voice was soft but without hesitation and it made the others shift in their seats.
Harry could relate. “My mistakes just kill others.” He brushed his fingers against the scars on his neck. He didn’t think anyone would understand. Didn’t dare share it with anyone, didn’t want to. He wanted to push it so deep he could forget, but he couldn’t forget. It was in his nightmares, every touch he had to endure. “I wanna forget.”
Draco glanced at who was coming towards him and nearly sobbed (but certainly didn’t) at the pain and righteous anger on Potter’s face as he moved closer. He knew that look and knew for once that anger wasn’t aimed at him. Potter took his hand and Draco couldn’t help himself, he launched himself onto him and wrapped his arms around Potter’s neck. Harry’s arms wrapped around him tightly and he could hear Harry whispering, “it’s okay Draco, it’s alright.”
Draco’s eyes went distance for a moment and he sighed. “I have a lot of practice with Imperius now.” Though saying that seemed to weigh on him. “I throw it off, immediately if I don’t want it and sooner rather than later if I do.”
Ben took a drag. “That’s why I’m here by the way. My ol’man was the one with the problems and I’m the one they locked away.”
It was like Harry’s love lit up exactly how much ugliness there was inside him. How much of himself he’d shoved down and wrapped in rejection and pain, so he could give his parents the child they wanted. Draco hated himself for giving them so much and he hated them for taking it. He glanced down to the symbol of his devotion to his parents. The dark mark on his arm that would forever remind him of how much of himself he let them have.
He quickly stood and went to the door. Narcissa was not one to scream the place down without a damn good reason. She’d had to many reasons recently and none good, so he wondered what had befallen them now, as the doors opened before he’d even reached them and Narcissa rushed in.
Tawy smiled. “Thank you. I’ll have the appointments placed on your bracelets. We can have some time together and separate.” Neither boy objected so she lifted the journals. “I’ve got one for both of you. I want you to write/draw in it at least once a day. You can write your thoughts, nightmares, your dreams, write some letters. No one will see it but you and me, and me only when I have your permission. I will not hold anything said against you nor allow you to be prosecuted for it. Just whatever comes into your head, it doesn’t have to be complete or pretty. Bring it with you to our appointments. Please.” She left the journals on the table.
She looked down to the jagged heart Draco was creating. He’d certainly figured how to use the markers to the best effects.
Tawy (giving Draco all of her attention) waved him off. “It’s alright. He’s just not awake yet.” Softer tone, “Come on Draco, you’re okay, let’s see those lovely eyes.”
“No. I didn’t have any.” He explained about Dudley and then why Dudley didn’t have to share. Tawy causally commented and Harry answered without thought, his mind on picking his next color. She inquired about the house he’d grown up in and he drew his Uncle and Aunt’s house as he explained his cupboard under the stairs. He wondered why she bothered. His cupboard under the stairs was practically old news, hell everyone knew. Still it was a damn sight easier to talk about that than what she could’ve been asking about so Harry just went along. He drew a school bus as he vented about how horrible primary had been with Dudley making sure people stayed away.
Pansy shook her head, “It’s just none of us can imagine you ever calling that man da, he’s more of a ‘father’ type.”
Their emergence into each other was codependent and perhaps not the best coping mechanism. However, the relationship was healing, a codependence of building each up and shoring the other rather than amassing depression. She thought to let them love freely and without boundaries because they had never known love like it and love truly did heal. She planned to give them time to help heal the other before helping them to see they could stand alone when they needed to and not just with the balance of the other.
When Teddy had been little, there had been healers, spells, and secrets all around Severus and Sirius. He remembered the healers, ones for the mind and for the body, arriving and speaking with his brothers behind closed doors. He remembered watching his grandmother perform nightly silencing charms on the door of their room. And he remembered the one time she’d forgotten and the screams that had shaken the house.
“What?” Harry scowled. Tawy’s words had come directly from a session. One where Draco had been the one to say, ‘I was raised by death eaters, what would I know about sharing?’ Ever since then it had been a phase used to forgive a multitude of Draco’s sins. Tawy called them teaching experiences and it had helped Harry to show Draco how slighted some of his views were. It was theirs and it was how Harry knew, really knew Draco wasn’t in trouble. Yet to hear it from someone else, someone who didn’t know the story or them.
Draco swallow thickly and took a deep breath, trusting Harry’s strength. He raised his eyes to meet Harry’s and started.
Harry didn’t stop frowning. Draco resisted smiling, having a hero was a little embarrassing but it was also sort-of nice.
“No,” Ron coughed, “too young to get married.” He’d been working on accepting the idea of Harry and Draco together, so he was kind-a ready for that, but marriage.
Andromeda sighed, “that makes sense. They would’ve needed such a way to hide under that vile thing’s sight.” She looked over the pictures again, “these are so very pretty. May I speak to the boys?”
Next to him, Draco huffed still unsure, but Harry leaned forward. “You want answers to whatever questions you have fine. Get us stoned and we’ll answer them.”
She laughed as she accepted the joint back, “Oi that answer at least makes sense. How long before you’re off then?”
Draco scowled, “My parents gave me to madman. Every other adult was insane and just as worthless, with one exception.”
The room wasn’t big and there were no windows, but it was a lot larger than a cupboard, which was really all he asked of from a room. There was a table with four chairs. The fore mentioned wardrobe with a door to the bathroom between it and another wardrobe. The twin bed he sat on had a nice puffy pillow and soft, warm blankets. He looked across the small night stand to the second twin bed, where Malfoy was still upset about having to turn their wands over, for a little while Tawy had promised, but still.
Harry glanced at Draco and then back to what he’d written. The journal was charmed for his eyes only unless he let Tawy read it. Still he didn’t remove his arm as he leaned down again. ‘I like his sarcasm, when it’s not pointed at me. I like him. I think in a way I always wanted to, like him that is. I guess I have been obsessed with him, but I had good reasons to be. Except maybe those reasons weren’t the only reasons I was, you know, obsessed.” Harry paused, trying to come up with the right words. “I don’t know, it’s like, he’s the only one that understands, enemy, friend whatever. He’s mine. I’ve been opposite him so long I can read him better than anyone. In some ways, we’re so far apart and in others, I’ve never been closer to anyone.’
Thank you for the encouragement. I was a little hesitate to put this out there, so for everyone who took a moment to give me some courage, you are awesome.  Thank you.
Just then Draco walked by, holding up two backpacks, “which do you prefer Harry? We’ll need something to put our stuff in.”
Harry was confused. He had been led to believe Draco was to be judged at the same time as his parents. So why wasn’t he and where was he that even his parents didn’t know?
Draco found he liked muggle stuff. Maybe not all of it, some of it was plain weird, but for the most part, he liked it. It was nothing like his parents had taught him. It was different, yes, but it wasn’t worse than wizarding. Some of it was even better.
“That doesn’t make you a bad son, it makes you human. They hurt you, allowed you to be hurt, and didn’t protect you as they should have. It’s okay to be angry.”
Ella giggled. “I’ve thought on how to go about it, being friendly. But it’s like having the royal bloody family in here, it is. All the celebrities you ever heard all about in the news, they’re entangled with. It’s so fantastic.”
“Huh, would you go with me…to see the goblins?” Harry bit his lip, putting all his attention to the hair he was braiding as he waited. He was a little wary of asking the goblins for anything after the dragon incident. Even if they’d theoretically forgiven him. Harry feel better bringing his own dragon.
Mandy nodded, “Yeah.” She looked around, but it looked like while everyone had stuck around they were waiting for her to explain. “Not forever but for a night.”
She swallowed thickly and straightened, but her voice was full when she could finally say, “No, you will not need to testify.” She blinked back her tears, “I’m sorry and not just for this, all of it. You should have the basic expectancy of privacy.”
“I agree, it’s not. I’m not trying diminish your question, I just don’t have an answer yet.” Tawy was calm, she waited, not adding anything else, while they processed.
“She has assured me you’ll be in the same room. However, they have yet to determine how they’re breaking down room assignments. Some of your classmates have needs as well that must be met within reason.” Both boys seemed relieved to hear that, which Tawy had figured, it was nice to know you weren’t alone. “There’s to be accommodations for everyone’s therapy groups and sessions. Our meetings are going to reduce once you start Hogwarts. Feel free to join your friends in one of their groups if you’d like.”
“Hogwarts Teddy, we know you got the letter and we want to know, do you want to go?” Sev smiled to soften the hard question.
“To what do we owe the pleasure Madam,” Senior Judge Fumeurs treated her with all the respect a woman of her station and sacrifices deserved.
She nodded. “Yes, he told Harry where to push and then bam! They just popped out. Tawy they broke the trust. The rest of the kids can’t have them there until they can abide by the rules. You know how important trust is for my group.”
Ron looked across to Harry and the poor mate looked all upset about it. “Harry it just wasn’t meant to be. We’re still best mates, always will be, but as far as dating goes, we’re done.”
“I said,” Neville stood and leaned over the table, his voice forceful, the muscles in his arms bunched, “that Harry and Malfoy
Tawy wanted to say she was shocked but a blood rite with something to do with marriage wasn’t a far-off thought. It was the
Violet was stunned, she couldn’t imagine such a sweet boy would want to kill anyone. “Draco was a part of that?”
“Nice tattoo,” On such a pretty boy the tattoo of nasty looking skull and snake really stood out. Put a little bad-boy on an otherwise too pretty for words canvas. She reached out to take a closer look.
Moments later the burrow door flew open, “George?” Molly called out as she looked around, she pinned her eyes on them, “have you seen,”
Judge Fumeurs didn’t have to speculate, he’d seen more than enough. “I understand. However we still don’t approve of how they handled the situation. You spent nearly every waking moment living in fear or locked your room.”
Maybe it was the tone of her voice or the fact that he knew her so well, but he didn’t stop as he said. “We know Hermione. We’ve read it all.” They reached the table and Harry put down the tray and turned to her. “And it doesn’t matter, because for the first time in my life. I’m happy.” He laughed, “Really happy. I’ve never even felt this way before. I didn’t know people could feel this way, and they’re not going to take this away from me.” Harry dropped into his seat and nudged Draco, who turned from where Pansy was regaling them with Killsmen’s latest adventure in lifechanging destruction.
Harry blinked with the hurt. She didn’t want him. She wasn’t going to stand up for him. Molly was going to let the Ministry take him away. He turned away from her, dismissing her hurt look, what did she have to be hurt about? He was the one being turned away.
Draco scoffed, “One of many mistakes. At least this one hasn’t nearly killed me. You watch this hair will cause me problems yet.”
Ella smiled coyly, while Clara slyly slid her arm over to hide the picture of them in the magazine she’d been looking at.
The others looked skeptical but that was as far as Harry was going to talk about the wand. The Ministry had wanted the wand, badly. He’d told them it had been broken and had disappeared after the battle. He also knew those who knew him well enough would see the lie. He thought Draco might be one of those. Hell, the Ministry had wanted his own wand and Malfoy’s too, but Harry had refused. He thought quickly and then something from earlier poked his thoughts. “My god-father was not some kind of deranged monster.”
“Yeah, see I worked it all out with Tawy. Those of us with guardians get out once a month to spend the weekend with them. I asked my sister and she said it was ok. She, my sister, she’s a muggle right and she doesn’t even know who you guys are really. Once I got her permission, I worked on Tawy, she was against it, but she finally agreed to one night.”
“No but don’t worry, we’ll buy everything we need, really, we’re fine.” Harry tried to reassure her. He didn’t understand why she looked concerned.
Draco rolled his eyes. He’d just opened his book when his bracelet began flashing red. He looked across the table to see Potter’s doing the same. He glanced at the band and sighed, “Lunch.”
George darted forward and gave Harry a quick hug. He waved his fingers towards Draco, turned and apparated away.
Harry was glad he wasn’t the only one to jump. He looked down to the house elf, twisting the dish towel it held.
The privacy shield was broken, and it wasn’t actually apart of the group privacy so Mandy could demand answers. There were so many times she had wanted to leave group, stomp out and she couldn’t. She wanted to know how they’d done it. “I want to know. I want them to tell me.”
Harry glanced back to where Tawy was, obviously headed their way but had been delayed by the door opening and the group that now surrounded her, speaking in a crescendo of half sentences. Harry couldn’t hear what they were saying, but they did seem excited.
“Here.” Clara stood up, from where she’d sat silently in the back, she skated around Ben and Mandy, who tried to stop her. “Here.” Clare offered him the lit joint.
Molly glanced to him and Harry shrugged, he didn’t think it was a big deal he’d always gotten ‘special’, not fun lessons.
Harry looked up at the ceiling of their room, hands under his head, already missing his wand. Though now he was mostly tired and worn out in a relaxed way, “I think we broke their room.” He glanced to the next bed, where Draco appeared lax and nearly dozing.
George raised his hand and waved a few fingers. “Actually, I might be able to add a few tidbits to that. Tidbits my mum kept from Ron, but,” he smirked, “she couldn’t keep from me. Maybe we should,” he gestured towards the empty classrooms around them, “this could take a while.” He took Ron’s deluminator from his pocket and rolled it in his hand, “We’ve got a lot to discuss.”
Harry shrugged, unraveling the braid he’d just finished. “Draco’s the first person who I actually want in my head.”
Mandy scowled. “Seriously?” That was their time. No one ever came to watch them, just Murphy and maybe Tawy hanging out in a corner, while they got to practice every spell they knew. She scowled and gritted her teeth, furious at having her time ruined.
As if he had a choice, he nodded, and she didn’t say anything else until they reached the apparition point. “St. Mungo’s, 9
Violet jerked back at the unexpected reaction. She watched as Draco rolled his sleeves down, scratching at his arm as he did, violent hard scratches. His face a mask of disgust and pain. Mandy’s face pale and sick. Harry’s pale and determined.
“Because,” he missed his friends and that’s where they would be. He had to go back and finish what he’d started. He needed the education. He wanted to be thought of as an adult, which graduating would give him. He needed to face everything that had happened there, “Because,” he shrugged, “I need to, I guess.”
The atmosphere of the room stalled, everyone waiting, paused as the magic seemed to hold on the brink of a wave.
“Mrs. Goyle, her sister, Greg, and his older sister, all dead,” Blaise announced, “And he left that. I told her we should destroy it.”
Harry took in the beanbag chairs and the blankets spread on the floor. There was a make-shift low table with an ashtray and magazines. There was also a stack of snacks and soft drinks, Ben waved towards them. “People donate to get time. No one knows when this was built or even who did it.”
The Judge took no notice and continued. “Child endangerment, unlawful imprisonment of the same, use of unforgivables on a child,” Fumeurs didn’t pause as the court burst into whispers, “neglect,”
Harry sat back down but didn’t pull his wrist from Draco’s grasp and Draco didn’t release him. Harry thought maybe Draco was preemptively staying ready to stop him from charging over, but Harry didn’t mind.
Violet leaned back after desert. “That was fantastic.” She glanced at her watch. “If you want time to send the word and get changed before I go to work, we need to get going. Are we still taking a cab?”
Ron smiled even as Kade stood from his chair. “Now see here, we called for no barrister. The Ministry can handle this matter.”
Murphy took the necklace and looked at the key with confusion, “why aren’t their wands in the vault?”
She nodded and pulled a long parchment from her robe. “In brief, he’s 2 stone (28 lbs) underweight and suffers from advanced trauma.” She stared at the paper for several minutes then huffed, her tongue unable to hold. She stiffened, “No one is meant to carry high amounts of stress for long periods of time, but it is particularly hard on children.”
“Surely you know what you’re looking for?” Narcissa stood from the bench and pinned the Healer with a stare.
The whole place seemed to wait for Harry’s reply, the dull roar of a moment ago now a murmur. Harry felt his face redden, but the elderly man gripped his cane and Harry did not want to be blamed if the ol’man took a header, so he stepped up, “Yes, sir.”
“Restraint.” Lucius Malfoy added. “He can’t be restrained, he,” the man broke off and looked to his wife.
“Tawy’s letting us leave for a night?” Harry wasn’t sure he was hearing right. Draco looked as surprised as he was sure he did.
Teddy nodded. “It’s for kids who are orphaned or abused. There’s at least one on every populated continent.”
Lucius leaned into his solicitor, the man’s eyes widened, and he exchanged furious whispers with his client. Lucius remained unmoved no matter how many times his defender shook his head. When Lucius leaned back the man sighed and called out, “Your Honor, Lord and Madam Malfoy plead no contest to any charge relating to their son, on the contingency their son is put through no more upset or questioning.”
Mandy scowled. Her plan would never come around if they never left their room. She had worked hard, had worked Tawy hard to even get her to agree.
Further down the same table, Hermione, who had never thought of Neville that way, paused and took note of Neville’s tall and toned profile.
Ron nodded, he and Hermione had experienced the same. The number of owls they’d sent in the week they’d been back, well Ron had never sent so many in his life.
Draco looked up at her as if she was nuts, “of course not, he didn’t play. He just watched. I did it, with my play wand.”
Harry clapped his hands, “So, by a show of hands, how many of you have heard and watched your mother beg and plead for your life? Actually had to listen to her begging for you, crying, come on, anyone?” His voice was at once without feeling and yet so broken it hurt to hear it.
“He had it in his mind to stay in the Black place, by himself.” Molly huffed. Harry stopped himself from rolling his eyes.
Harry knew Malfoy was going to go off. It wasn’t a matter of if, but when. Someone like Draco Malfoy couldn’t suffer under the whispers, taunts, and the bullying in silence. Harry could see the strain Malfoy went through trying to ignore them, to avoid them, and to not give them cause.
Bear looked down at the whimper and watched the small form flinch from him. Bear bit his lip and cursed himself remorseful, pained at causing the boy distress. “Sorry little one, not going to hurt you.” He stepped away from the bed and tucked his wand away. “Sorry Tawy, I didn’t mean to frighten him.”
Lucius got 15 years house arrest, which in the manor wouldn’t seem like much of an arrest, due to its sheer size, not to mention their lands, which he could roam. Lucius’ magic would also be censored for 20 years. Harry though it was a fine compromise instead of returning to Azkaban.
Draco turned away from him and Harry wrapped his arms around him in a tight hug. He released him and did a loose braid.
“Everyone knows they’re heroes. We didn’t know they were your godfathers,” Rey offered, “we didn’t mean any offence.”
Tawy folded her hands on her lap. “Right now, you’re both still minors and we’ve spoken about the guardianship remaining in place.”
Harry felt it too, but it was a fleeting thought to the one that screamed gleefully. He sat back next to Draco and rested his head on his shoulder. Draco rested his against Harry’s. “I’ve never had someone that belonged to me before. I’m new to affection. You’ll have to tell me if it’s too much, or annoying or whatever, because I don’t know Draco, but I want to figure it out, with you.”
“You’ll go?” Mandy hadn’t been sure if it was the right thing to do but seeing how excited they were she felt pretty good about it.
When it finally happened Harry had been looking at his pie and wondering why he’d come back to Hogwarts at all. He jerked his head up at the loud laughter to see the reason he’d returned picking himself off the floor, next to him Ron bit off a chuckle.
“I have an owl and we can go with my sister to work. I usually go with her. She works as a bartender at a muggle night club.
The walk started off awkward and silent until Ben hung back, letting Rey lead. Ben fidgeted for a few minutes before laughing nervously. “So ah yeah, Mary J 101.”
“And that isn’t going to change, shocking things are a part of their lives. They’ve accepted those shocking things as part of who they are. Even better they know those things don’t define them. I don’t see any reason to keep them here. Besides, as it was pointed out last staff meeting, their presence upsets the order here. Everyone is distracted, including staff. I’ve had to take away an unprecedented amount of contraband. Stuff smuggled in here for the sole reason of getting pictures or information about them and some of that from staff. The boys can continue their work in Hogwarts. At least there the staff and most of the students are used to them. Where there are more people actively attempting to protect them and not sell any part of them.”
Rey leaned forward and took the joint from Ella’s hand. “Aren’t we all? My parents like to use Legilimency and the Imperius curse. And no matter how many times I tried to resist.” He shrugged. “I couldn’t.”
Mandy nodded smugly. “I got my muggle tea, course pure blooded H.A Keller has no idea why I’d ever want to drink that nasty smelling stuff. Thankfully Tawy is still all let them try and have muggle stuff.”
Draco huffed and leaned in. “I’m a villain in disgrace and you’re the hero. Of course, they want pictures Potter. Thankfully they’ll have to live in want.”
Harry couldn’t help but watch as the two spoke quickly, even as he stood with Ron and Hermione.  “What do you think that’s about?”
“With their hands! Tawy bare hands! They tore it open, like a door. I don’t even understand how they did it.” Healer Kelly was obviously distressed.
“What are those?” Lucius, aware of Narcissa’s difficulty and his part in it, attempted to give her a moment to compose herself by drawing attention from her. He gestured towards the sunglasses on his son’s head.
Harry hated handing his wand over at the end of their time. He couldn’t wait until he was at Hogwarts where he’d have it all the time, he paused, “we’ll get our wands back when we go to Hogwarts, right?”
Mandy seemed thoughtful, “there’s this girl on the floor above us. Serious cutter, she always gets a hold of a knife. They have no idea how she does it, but as soon as they take one, she has another.”
Draco must have felt the same because he shifted over without a smart word. They sat next to each other for several minutes of silence.
Harry waited for Draco to say something, but he didn’t. Harry bit his lip, unsure what to say. Draco sighed and needed both hands to bring his hair to either side of his neck. Harry closed his eyes for a second, pained at the sight of half-moon lines marking either side of Draco’s neck. He touched carefully, under his fingertips was the same feeling as when he touched his own neck. He’d never seen his before, but he imagined they looked exactly the same. He traced the half-circle on either side of Draco’s neck, curving around the bones of his spine. Harry pulled his fingers back. They sat quietly, staring into the room.
Harry calmed under their support. Finally, he nodded, taking comfort in their relief. He looked up, “Alright, I’ll go.”
Draco shrugged. The words easier to say when Potter wasn’t staring him with those huge green eyes. “I also reinstated Andromeda.”
Draco raised an eyebrow while Harry starred with wide eyes, “as I was saying Potter, I think that took a little longer than we’d thought.”
Draco felt his mother at his side and leaned her way as he glanced at the Healer’s face. She was giving him that look again, and it was uncomfortable. He would have understood distain. He didn’t know what to do with whatever this was. He looked to his side and saw his father’s slight nod. His mother brushed the hair from his face. “And you will return him here when you have completed your exam?”
“Shut up,” she called back, still waving her empty hands at Harry. “Mistake? What are you talking about Harry, of course he’s allowed mistakes. Neither I nor anyone else is going to take him away from you. Harry, look at me, not them.” She caught his eyes and held them. “No one is going to take him anywhere. Draco’s fine and you’re fine and no one here is going to hurt either one of you, alright?”
