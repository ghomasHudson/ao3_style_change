Harry didn’t like Malfoy’s tone. It sounded strained with a forced calm. Something was wrong, Harry could feel it in his marrow. He all but ran back to his side.
Before Harry could answer, the rest of the players had gathered. He looked at his ever-serious little team: broad-chested, enthusiastic Fitz, wan and stringy-haired Marcia Awling, Mathieu from Bristol, quiet, dedicated Magnolia, and Clark and Hiram who stood with Karanjeet and David, talking tactics.
“Yes, I see what you mean,” Mother agreed, the corner of her mouth twitching. “Will you go after him?”
Understanding clicked into place, Malfoy must have forgotten about it until he went to depart this morning. Harry stepped closer to pick it up. It was then that he realised the Floo powder had also been replenished. Tucked beneath the small sack was a folded bit of parchment.
“Please may I come?” Draco forced the words out through gritted teeth, naked and kneeling at Harry’s feet.
Malfoy seemed to take a moment to scrutinise his face, then smiled and obediently began to peel the fruit, “See, Potter, I knew you had a sense of humour hidden in there, somewhere.”
“Must be someone at this table to make Harry turn that particular shade of eggplant,” Charlie remarked, as the chime sounded and the voice rose up.
Ron looked panicked but Draco fixed him with a sharp glance. “Find Granger and a calming draught. Now, Weasley.”
Draco gave Harry his very best horrified expression. “I’m not showing up in public in your old grey sack of a shirt, Potter, honestly.”
“I’m sorry,” he said again. “I’m sorry you’ve had to watch us live on, to get to do all the things you never will. I hate it. Every day, I hate it. I hate it and I don’t understand it and I don’t think I’ll ever come to terms with it. I think it always hurts. And if you carry on in this way, if you pursue your anger and revenge, you’ll just spread that hurt, amplify it, and for what? I’ve gotten my revenge: Voldemort’s dead and I’m still living, but that’s not what spurs me forward. We needed him gone, yes, but the simple fact of his death adds nothing to the richness of my life, just as I doubt hurting dozens of kids will give meaning to your death.”
“I’m being weird?” Malfoy replied, unconvinced, tucking his book into a pocket attached to the headboard for such purposes.
“We know, Harry,” Hermione said, her face full of tenderness, “it was just a nightmare. I suspect some damage control will be required; I’m not sure how we’ll keep twenty mouths shut. Might have to get ahead of it in the press, Merlin, I’m not sure.”
"Promise me you won't tell Weasley we're shagging," Draco said then, and new light in Harry's heart clouded over.
“I…” Draco swallowed. Harry was on alert now, no protests on Draco’s part would put him off. Draco didn’t respond right away, scanning his brain for something that would require very little effort on Harry’s part, but would still make him feel like he was helping, but his distracted mind couldn’t provide him with anything convincing. “I think it would help,” he began carefully, “if I could drown them out a little—my thoughts I mean.”
Draco snorted. "Oh, I'm terribly jealous about almost everyone and everything. I just also know you're loyal to your very marrow, and I find that awfully sustaining."
“Pretty sure most mums say that,” Clark laughed, “Well, maybe not the bit about muggles. Come on, I’ll show you. Probably plenty of Christmas movies on these days, or, I dunno, what do you like Harry?”
“Er, Harry,” it was Edward Lupin speaking this time, he sat back a bit from the table which gave him room to easily feed the baby. “I’d thought I might go visit Victoire and her family today. Should I reschedule?”
The Slytherin emitted a quiet sigh. The pink in his cheeks had faded and his anger seemed to have burnt itself out. “Look, Jamie, I never thanked you for last night, for, er, silencing me. I owe you.”
Harry sent off his Patronus immediately to McGonagall, while Neville and Ron took off to check on the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff dorms. Despite Hermione’s insistence that everyone stay calm, the great hall was a stew of worry and chatter, with breakfast things left neglected on tables.
to fuck me?” The accusation burst out without Draco’s permission. It sounded petulant and insecure and made Harry rub the back of his neck in that bashful gesture of his that Draco couldn’t interpret.
“Sometimes Rosie and I pretend we’re sisters, since we both have flower names,” Lily had announced as she selected the storybook off her shelf with great solemnity. “And because we’re cursed with nothing but brothers, like Mum. ” A shadow crossed her face then, as if she’d momentarily forgotten of her mother’s betrayal. “But anyway, a cousin’s the next best thing, isn’t it?”
“I will definitely try to do my best,” Harry said. “I will probably mess up, but I will work very hard not to.”
“I’m not daft,” Harry countered. “I know a prophecy when I see one, even if they’re not usually quite like that. How long?”
think they have a right to you, that you somehow owe the public a detailed account of your romantic entanglements or personal connections.” He planted another kiss and Harry leaned into it this time. Draco pulled back, and gave Harry a condescending pat to his cheek. “You don’t. You owe them nothing, except perhaps a vicious libel suit.”
Harry carried Draco over to the broad table and set him down, pressing his shoulders, so he lay back. Harry was over him then, lovingly attending to every portion of the expansive scar, feeling the other boy shaking beneath him. When he reached the inferior edge, along the incline of Draco’s ilium, he kissed that ridge, too. He nuzzled into the plane of Draco’s belly, gripping his thighs, breathing him in. Then, feeling suddenly sure and strong, he held Draco’s cock in his hand and took it in his mouth.
Potter rubbed at the back of his neck again. “And what do you propose I do, love? Lock myself in my room and leave you all to your reckless devices?”
Harry turned his face, pressing it against Malfoy’s outstretched palm. Harry heard Malfoy’s breath hitch at the contact and he found he liked catching the other man off guard. With the pad of his thumb, Malfoy traced a path along the ridge of Harry’s cheekbone, before easing downwards and doing the same to Harry’s bottom lip. Harry felt his chin being lifted slightly, until he had no choice but to meet Malfoy’s solemn, grey eyes once more.
He nodded to the Slytherin girl who gaped at him, looking ready to tell him all the reasons she shouldn’t be selected, not least of which was that time she’d been mind-controlled into cursing him with
The student body seemed to take the lead of the eighth years, who had rallied round them in a way that left Harry feeling truly touched. Megan Jones was being iced out by all but a few Hufflepuff girls, and Harry couldn’t bring himself to feel badly for her. Of course there were continued whispers and stares, but no one dared say anything outright, at least not to him. The eighth year blokes still insisted on accompanying him and Draco everywhere, and honestly Harry was just relieved to know their protective eyes were on Draco when his couldn’t be.
The girl’s voice trailed off as the two disappeared into the kitchen and Harry and Draco found themselves alone. The moment the two were out of sight, Harry came to him, his hand flying to Draco’s forehead. Harry delicately traced the painful bump. “Fuck, I’m so sorry,” he murmured. Draco fought down the urge to bat his hand away. Potter needed to fuss, that was his way. “I knew he wouldn’t be thrilled, but I never dreamed he’d—”
He felt Draco’s hand on his leg, giving him warm reassurance just as Dudley reached a mammoth gorilla arm across the table, and squeezed Harry’s shoulder. “I’m sorry for it,” he said, seriously, “I’ve learned a bit more about why we had to go into hiding last year. You didn’t have to keep an eye out for us, you had no reason to want to protect us, but you made sure it was taken care of, anyway.”
Only once they were aloft did Ginny fix him with a steady gaze and say, “Harry, you’re in love with Draco Malfoy, aren’t you?”
“Interesting,” Main remarked, his grin remaining, but his eyes narrowing coldly. “Because word has it from Mulligan’s little sister, that you got some sort of special treatment in Defence class today. Didn’t have to practice like everyone else.”
Harry couldn’t think of anything he’d like to do less than sit in a snooty restaurant letting others make their judgments about his relationship and putting Draco at risk like that.
“Probably smart,” Hermione sighed. “The atmosphere around the Castle is a bit charged. Everyone was looking for you both at breakfast. They're angry on your behalf, furious at the supposed treachery. They've taken this blasted article as gospel. He wouldn’t have lasted the day without being leveled by at least a few hexes. Even a constant escort would not have put them off, not this time. It was one offense for him to love you; it is quite another for him to betray you.”
“I don’t like, absolutely not. I mean I’ll help you with your knee but I’m not going to just do whatever you want.”
“Mr. Potter!” He said, shaking Harry’s hand, “Good to see you again, sans soot. And Mr. Malfoy. Your headmistress said you would both be here. Clark’s done famously, reacting as hoped to the regenerative potion. No neurological or pulmonary deficits that we can determine, thanks largely to your quick efforts, I understand, Mr. Potter. I’ll ask that you be on lookout for cough and any muzzy-headedness, but Clark should be ready to return to life as usual. The circumstances were, of course, unusual and quite dramatic. It is possible that Clark here will have an emotional response to them, as well. Him and I have talked about what to do should that be the case.”
Narcissa dabbed at her eyes, “Oh, I have plenty of spite for him, too,” she assured him, “Perhaps I just saw...glimpses of the man he could have been. But they became fewer fewer with every passing year until they flickered out entirely. Merlin, but he loved you, Draco. I can still picture his face, holding you for the first time. A son. His son.”
“It’s alright. You’ll make up, you always do. Now, do you want to come back and at least get to taste the meal you worked so hard on, or do you want to escape to your room for a bit?”
Harry removed himself quickly. He clapped Clark on the shoulder, congratulating him, while Malfoy handed over a box of toffees—he’d insisted Harry get a separate supply for younger student.
It felt somehow momentous, that promise, made just then. Something grave and important swelled inside of him and Al became suddenly resolute. He’d get on with Jamie even if it killed him.
“Like my arsehole, Harry,” he clipped, “Merlin, if you can’t say it, I suppose I don’t have much hope of you wanting to do it.”
“I’m…” Harry cleared his throat because his voice felt cramped and ugly trying to escape him, “I’m not sure I got to have a childhood.”
Harry’s anger was reflexive, primitive, taut. One more step towards Al and he might have killed the man. Harry didn’t like the clarity of that knowledge. Jamie was staring at him, lips parted in an awed sort of terror. The boy had never seen Harry like this, Harry had never let him. He’d reserved this treatment for stray Death Eaters earlier in his career; he’d not much use for violent wandless magic since.
“Well,” he said, as they made their way down the pier in the glow of early evening sun, “Back to ours and then I guess I’ll head back and do what needs doing?”
“My map’s gone,” Harry admitted. “I think whoever took Draco’s letters also took mine, and my map was mixed up in them. I’ve only just realised. But whoever has it likely won’t be able to access it.”
And I feel like an arsehole for forgetting it, but even worse when I remember it. I want to put it away, but then feel as though I owe it to them to remember, so I shouldn't do that even if I could.”
“Sorry, Harry,” Hermione said. “I’ve got to go and check in with everyone, make sure nothing else has happened. McGonagall will make an announcement, I’m sure.”
The sentiment spurred a flash of anger behind Draco's breast bone. “I need no such thing,” he declared. He forced his anger aside. He should have known a hearty dollop of psychoanalysis was coming his way the moment he set foot in Pansy’s bedroom, but he could listen to her dictates without having to believe them. He had done so for years.
,” he exclaimed, wishing he had something he could break, “he wasn’t supposed to find out like that.”
“Ah,” Harry acknowledged. He personally preferred the coddling approach, if he was being honest with himself. “And what did he tell you?”
Lily seemed satisfied enough with that and went back to her painting. Harry started thinking about what on earth to make for dinner. How angry would Jamie be if he opted for beans on toast again?
“Harry,” Harry offered in kind. “Sorry for the surprise. Is Clark ready to go, or should I come back in a bit?”
“What’s to think about? A professional quidditch team has asked you to try out. You love quidditch. I know it makes you happy, and I know you’re brilliant. I am not even all that interested in quidditch and I know that!”
“As do I.” It did feel terribly surreal. At this time three years ago, Draco had been under the Dark Lord’s thumb, terrified and hopeless and yearning for a boy he thought he'd be certain wouldn't survive the conflict. Now he was a qualified healer, openly dating Harry Potter, and somehow along the way they’d acquired two children. It was not a path Draco could possibly have foreseen, and yet it was better than anything his loathsome wartime dreams ever concocted.
’d even, maybe. Or at least it was different, slower and more precise, more dread about what would happen next instead of simply all consuming pain. But I knew you were coming, I knew I only had to bear it for a minute. And it was good to know I was actually bearing it for a reason, for once. A reason beyond the humiliation of me or my parents. That if I was taking it, it meant she would leave those kids alone.”
“Certainly not,” Malfoy assured him, “It is the biggest regret of my life. Unfortunately, I left a lot of hurt people in my wake. I participated in terrorizing innocents. And most people are not so quick to forgive. Nor should they be, they don’t owe me anything. ”
“A thing’s only humiliating if you think someone will think less of you for it,” Harry commented thoughtfully, his hand trailing down Draco’s back to curl around his hips. He pulled him closer, but Draco refused to give in or to relax. So Harry continued: “Do you think I’d think less of you for sitting on my knee?”
Within moments of him leaving, Lily sneaked into the bedroom, a scrap of parchment and quill in hand, and her magnifying glass tucked under one arm.
Draco only scoffed. “I've got you in my bed every night. You’d do anything I ask, and we’ve all but adopted an eleven-year-old. I’m hardly insecure in our relationship.”
Harry at that DA meeting so long ago—surrounded by flaming mongrels. The pups morphed into dogs, then wolves, growing larger and spreading flames to the nearby draperies and furniture as they tore through the open space.
Clark jumped at the voice, looking towards the doorway where Jared stood in relief against the candlelight flickering behind him. His little hands were on his hips and he looked quite cross.
“Ginny Weasley?” Pansy gasped, grabbing at the side of their table for dramatic effect. “But she was smitten!”
He didn’t particularly, but he wasn’t about to let Weasley know that, not with the ginger looking so outraged at the exclusion. A childish man, Draco determined disdainfully, with childish jealousies. He carefully ignored thinking about the ways in which he was currently securing Harry’s company for himself.
“Oh?” Harry inquired, before Draco could lay into her further. “Hermione, do us a favour, would you? Some documents of mine, including a particular artifact of my dad’s, seem to have gone missing.” He gave her a meaningful look, then continued. “They are letters from Draco, mostly. Thing is, they’re caring and sweet and not at all salacious, so I bet Jones couldn’t get glean anything to interest Pushbottom from them. I'd hate to disturb the girls' dormitory myself, but maybe you could take a quick peek in Jones’ trunk for us? See what you can find?”
The red-faced, red-bearded healer who they’d met at Hogwarts arrived before Clark had a chance to reply.
“Bird Hiram’s actually an incredibly clever owl, Hi, you’re just jealous,” Clark corrected. The nickname was new, Harry thought, and Merlin, he really was glad the kid had made a friend.
“No,” Hermione replied, “but there have been lulls in incidents before. I mean, there is a chance that whoever is doing this doesn’t know about the amulets yet and is still trying to sort out why her little trick isn’t working any more. Once she does figure it out, though,  it’s only a matter of time before she gets someone in the shower, or who forgot to transfer their button over from their pajamas to their day clothes.”
He felt a jolt of abhorrence when he realised what it was he needed. Usually when things felt this out of hand, Draco would find himself a stranger to make it better, to shrink his concerns down to nothing but the brutal smack of leather against flesh, and his own desperate battle to maintain composure—and Draco never lost composure.
Harry regarded him and stepped in, wrapping a hand around Draco’s waist and pulling him in. “Oh, I don’t know. I’m awfully determined.”
Harry cast another Bubble Head charm immediately and rolled the boy over. His lips were tinged blue and Harry was reminded of the memory of Clark's little brother, suffocating in the kitchen, the sirens and Crystal sobbing.
“Harry,” Draco protested again, but the magic tightened warningly. “Yes, very well.” He swallowed down a lump, refusing to let his mind return to the endless What-Ifs. “It wasn’t my fault. This isn’t a punishment.” The words rang hollow.
Malfoy held Harry’s elbows and helped maneuver him the rest of the way to the floor, crouching beside him. Harry dropped his head between his knees. Draco’s hand was rubbing tentative circles on Harry’s back and all Harry could hear was his heartbeat, Merlin, was it always this loud? It felt like an earthquake ricocheting through him with every smart snap of his valves. He forced his focus away from it, clocking instead the movement of Malfoy’s palm along his spine, slow and reassuring and very much alive.  He reached out blindly, for Draco’s other hand, wrapping it up in both his, desperate to feel the other boy’s warmth bleed into his own buzzing, freezing fingers.
“Alright?” Harry asked, rolling onto his side so they were face to face. It seemed he’d not been sleeping, after all.
“Liar. I’ll see you the day after tomorrow, then, provided you haven’t moved into the Potter residence already.”
There was something in the tone Harry was using, a note of condescension that made Draco’s hips sputter upwards into nothingness, eager for Harry’s touch.
Someone gently cleared their throat, from the doorway. Draco didn’t have to turn to know it was Potter.
“Just my toe,” Lily gulped, sticking out her foot for Harry to examine. He fired off another healing spell for good measure, although he suspected it was not seriously injured.
“Enough,” Draco stepped in. “Tiering, as much as we’re not want to disown you, we are both extremely cross and won’t make any effort to stop disciplinary measures headed your way. Atwal, you’ll be given plenty of opportunity to air your grievances. It is clear that you have been wronged and neither Potter nor myself will make any attempts to deny or minimise that. But can we all please agree to get out of this frankly appalling room and get some sleep?”
“Spirits are the usual culprit,” Pansy pointed out. “You always transform into a bit of a gossip after enough shots. But you’re sober as anything today, so actually, it must be my uncanny insight and enduring friendship.”
“I think so too,” Zerk said. “I can’t help but notice that the idea that Draco may have manipulated you somehow seems to especially bother you.”
and he wasn't even at Hogwarts right now anyway. But he could swear he could still taste ash in his mouth and singed air in his lungs and being alone in his bed was the last thing he could stand just now.
Ginny snorted, “Rich blond git at the back of the class? The one whose bed you sleep in? This ringing any bells? Honestly, Harry, who did you think?”
“And you’re...” Draco paused, nonplussed. The child was only twelve and so far as Draco knew, there were no new threats circling Hogwarts. He couldn't think what might be troubling him. “Currently stressed? About...something?”
“Does your family know about this hateful side of yours?” he asked, forcing himself to sound casual and unaffected, despite his raging heart. “Does Harry?”
"A couple of pumpkin pastries, Potter," was Draco's impervious response, "with a pat of butter, if you would."
Draco forced himself to a standing position, relying overmuch on the side table to support him. His stomach lurched threateningly.
Draco shook his head and forced a smile. “Certainly not. I’m fine. I’m sure you’re right. It could have been a disaster, but it wasn’t. James saw to that. I’m very grateful to him.”
He returned his gaze to Potter’s. The ridiculous round spectacles of their youth had been replaced with something more reasonable: black, framed clubmasters that Draco somehow doubted Potter had picked out himself. Those damn eyes were as bright green as ever, though, almost magnified behind the lenses, daunting in their sincerity. Potter was absently rubbing the back of his own neck, and Draco wondered idly if the man had a tension headache.
“I never liked him,” Draco corrected. “He was not a man a person could like. He was simply someone they could fear.”
McGonagall leveled him with a glance, “While I appreciate all you’ve done for us, Mr. Potter, I am still running a school. I have various pressing concerns, as you can imagine. Informing you four of your successful sleuthing was certainly on my list and I had intended on getting to it this weekend. This was not some devious plot to keep you in the dark, I can assure you.”
after all, and both Draco and his mother’s names were cleared. Anyway, I think we’ve got pretty decent teams sorted, so let’s call it a day, shall we?”
“Oh, you know,” Draco made a vague gesture in the air. “You fall into most things, don’t you? Just bursting with talent. It used to make me mad with jealousy. The youngest Seeker in a century? I nearly bruised my arse, I spent so many hours flying the summer after first year, and where did it land me? Decent on a broom, at best. It was always that way with you. Duelling, Defence, sheer heroism. Everything came shockingly easy to you, it was infuriating.”
“Yes! Except no; I don’t know,” Clark admitted. He sounded defeated. “It makes me feel safe, but I hate that it does.”
“Not beans on toast?” Jamie interrupted, swiping an apple from the dwindling fruit bowl. Merlin, Harry really needed to get out to the shops again. James wasn’t supposed to snack this close to dinner and he knew it, but he had that steel in his eyes, just daring Harry to call him on it.
“Well, Malfoy,” she addressed him, sliding into a chair across from him. “Quite the bump you’ve got there. You know where you are? No memory loss?”
“Filthy mudblood spawn!” she’d shrieked, “Leave this house, you don’t belong!” Her tirade had left Clark in tears and he'd retreated to his bedroom. Harry suspected he was more tired than anything. It had been a long day.
Harry fixed his and Clark’s tea and passed the younger boy a cup before taking a seat at the other end of the sofa.
“Harry,” she greeted him, squeezing his hand, “thank you for your lovely words. We all need voices like yours to learn and to heal.”
She looped an arm through his and squeezed tight, “Oh, Harry, that’s brilliant, you must be chuffed. Have you told Ron? He’s going to lose it. What did Draco say?”
Jamie was more astonished than affronted. This was not a side of Scorpius he had seen before. “You’re rather feisty when you’re angry,” he observed.
at protective magic, and hurricanes are a spot of poor weather. Any other trivialising you’d care to engage in?”
“I’m sorry,” he said again. “Merlin, we'd only needed to have held out a few more weeks, then they would have offered you a spot and once it was signed...well. Nevermind.”
Seamus took the opportunity to hop up on the bench and call out “A mighty fine lad indeed,” laughing and clapping like an insane person.
Harry  gave Draco an amused look and Draco's eyes rolled skyward in exasperation. Together the rounded the corner to find Clark gazing up at a tawny barn owl with a black ringed face.
“I know,” Draco  replied. “First term, he attempted his Potent Posy Potion twelve times. He came after class for a fortnight, despite already having an acceptable grade.”
Harry paused. He was certain it was odd to be divulging this intimate slice of married life to someone...new. But if Draco was bothered, he didn’t show it. Instead, his flinty eyes were fixed on Harry, his expression assessing and interested. Draco was like that though, always analysing, always strategizing. It used to drive Harry spare when they were kids: He’d been certain the Slytherin was cooking up some cruel taunt or vicious plot, and to Harry’s credit, the other boy usually was. It wasn’t like that now, though. Now, Draco’s intelligence, his meticulousness and careful attention made Harry feel so moderate and steady, like any problem they encountered would have a reasonable solution, if only they took a moment to identify it.
“Oh you’ll have dirtied a lot more than that when I’m done with you,” Harry promised, taking Draco’s jaw in his hand, “Open.”
“Oh, come off it, you two,” Ron challenged, “it’s a far more outrageous and salacious story than that! If Draco’s going to be coming around here in future and we’re only going to discuss quidditch, teeth, and the weather, I might have to drown myself in the punchbowl.”
“Oh!” said the second Ravenclaw, obviously catching his less than favourable reaction, “We know that! It’s just, you're Harry Potter,” her voice lowered, “and he's a Death Eater.”
Harry ignored the question, detailing the capture and escape from Malfoy Manor, the transfer of the Elder Wand’s allegiance, and Voldemort’s death. He just needed to get through this. He spoke of what he could remember from the Battle of Hogwarts, the carnage and the names of the fallen. He avoided telling them about the killing curse that should have ended him, saying only that he feigned his own death to get close to Voldemort, springing back into action when given an opportunity. “And so his killing curse backfired when met with my spell, and killed him,” Harry said at last. It felt a little anticlimactic. “The war was over.”
“Do you want to hurt? Like do you want me to go at you, hitting you, beating you and marking you until you can’t think about anything else? To distract you from the last few days and overwhelm you?” As he expected, the glint of fear returned, evidenced by the twitch of a muscle in Draco's cheek. “Or do you want to suffer for me in perhaps a more subtle way, while I remind you of your mistake and deter you from making another, as a sort of penance? Or something unrelated to today altogether?” He removed his thumb from Draco’s mouth, indicating he could speak.
“Merlin!” He cried out, lurching forward to correct his own balance, “I’m so sorry, Professor, are you alright?”
“Up to you,” Harry said, “I’m happy to switch players around so everyone can have a go, it’s about learning the game, after all.”
“Who taught you Occlumency?” Harry asked, thoughtfully. He’d always assumed it was Bellatrix, but Draco’s approach tonight had been less forceful than Harry anticipated, more considerate. The meditation, in particular, didn’t feel like an approach Bellatrix would value.
“I’d talk to her,” he insisted, “if she’d just tell me where she is or agree to meet me, I want to fix this, she must know that.”
Slowly, still shaking, Malfoy obeyed. His eyes were red-rimmed, face tear-streaked, pink blotches blooming over pale skin. Harry cupped a hand over his face. This might be a bad idea, he didn’t know. His inhibitions were down and he just...he just wanted Draco to know.
“Twelve seconds.” Harry repeated, breathing hard. Draco gave a curt nod, eyes clenched shut. Harry watched in fascinated satisfaction as Draco steeled himself, suspended in the agonizing position, counting down in his head. When Draco reached zero, he collapsed, falling to his side and curling up there.
still fit, he’d been irritated to notice. Filled out, and a bit softer with the exhausted haze of parenthood, but tall and striking, even with the few days' growth of beard and a truly revolting t-shirt. As for his damn eyes—Draco knew exactly what Pansy meant, but he refused to acknowledge it, not to her and certainly not to himself. “Both eyes seemed present and accounted for,” he said. “But he was not well, really. His wife’s left him.”
“I doubt there’s anything Harry wouldn’t do for that ridiculous bird,” Draco murmured fondly. “Or for you.”
The grip Father had on the baby bottle relaxed some and the unexpected tension in the air seemed to give. “Yes,” he agreed, “me too.”
? Harry wrinkled his brow. The more Draco insisted there was nothing to discuss, the less Harry believed him.
The woman stiffly adjusted herself, “Quite alright, Mr. Potter,” she said slowly in that smooth accent of hers, “Or at least, it would seem, faring better than you."
Harry began to spend evenings training. Mandy Brocklehurst and Olivier Rivers had also received invitations to trial days—Brocklehurst, too, for the Appleby Arrows and Rivers for the Caerphilly Catapults and the Montrose Magpies (chasers had more options, Harry told himself). So most nights, the three of them would walk down to the pitch together, crunching over the frosty grass, breath visible in the golden light of their wands. Some nights, some of the other seventh or eighth years would come out to lend a hand. It reminded Harry a bit of competing in the Triwizard competition in fourth year, the whole school seemed to be buzzing with excitement for the three of them, as though their success belonged, in part, to everyone.
The Grey Lady was hovering over a stool in a well lit study just below the Ravenclaw dormitories. A crumbling, oversized bit of parchment lay open on a desk in front of her. Harry supposed it was in English, but not a version of English still recognizable.
“Er,” he said, but apparently that was all he needed to say, because Myrtle continued whinging at him.
But his dad wasn’t...was he? Gay? Scorpius had never thought to ask. Father had married Mother, but they'd hardly been affectionate towards each other, so it certainly wasn't impossible thar his father’s inclinations had something to do with that.
Al’s reaction was less easy to predict. It would depend largely on his mood and whatever he was invested in that hour or day or week. Scorpius could well picture his friend being anything from indifferent to furious to elated, especially when he realised what Scorpius was only just realising: If things went
“Sweetheart,” Harry replied, “I can’t make people do things, and I wouldn’t, even if I could. Your mother is her own person and she gets to make decisions for herself.”
“I know you don’t like platitudes, but it’s going to be alright, sweetheart,” Harry promises. “We’ll do every last thing we can think of to make it as alright as possible. I don’t want you to have to carry all this any more, and certainly not by yourself.”
“Nice save, Awling! Good play, Rundle!” Harry called out, “Swap out with Clayburne for a bit, would you?”
“Evening, Malfoy,” a voice sounded over his shoulder, making Scorpius jump. He turned from his scroll of parchment to see Sterling Main, Head Boy, smiling pleasantly at him. Main always made Scorpius’ skin crawl, even though he’d never been anything but friendly. His pretentious wood-framed glasses irritated Scorpius. To Main’s right was Dermot Mulligan, a narrower, bum-chinned version of Main. Privately, Al and Scorpius referred to Mulligan as ‘The Lackey’. The two even had the same hair, for mercy’s sake: dark brown and parted to the side with a faux-tousled appearance. Only Main was able to sprout some respectable stubble, whereas Mulligan’s was patchy at best.
Harry made them both tea while Malfoy showered. Ten minutes later, they reconvened in the dormitory. Harry made quick work of putting Malfoy’s sock and shoe onto the foot of his injured leg—it still felt odd kneeling before the prat like this—and then went to stand.

“Yes, alright,” Professor Potter agreed. “Just promise you’ll rein yourself in if necessary, or you’ll come to me immediately if you start feeling
Harry jumped at the words. “What?” he demanded. The word came out much more harshly than he had intended.
He watched Draco’s face for signs of distress, but didn’t see any. He slid his thumb back further, the soft villi of Malfoy’s tongue creating a pleasing, unusual sensation. Draco gagged, just a little. Harry did it again, just because he could, harder this time. Malfoy’s response was proportional, and Harry pulled back, releasing the other boy’s face.
As if summoned by his voice, Clark and Karanjeet burst into the bathroom wearing matching expressions of fierce determination.
It was not the old Defense office that she led him to, but one on a lower level, tucked away in a hallway Harry was not sure he’d ever noticed before. The office was spartan, as though she had no intentions of putting down roots here. The only books on the shelves were those required for classes, and Harry suspected they were property of Hogwarts. The room was dim, only half the candles lit, and once inside the sparse room, Professor Haberdash-Pewter pulled down her hood. The candle light flickered off her papery skin.
“Earthworms actually act communally,” Ri corrected her. “So, such a curse would hardly be disruptive to their social structure.”
“As I said,” he began, “Astoria and I keeping separate lives suited us, but perhaps adhering to that tack was an error in judgment. Scorpius’ birth changed Astoria. It was a difficult labour and went on far too long. He was born hypoxic, and he couldn’t breathe unassisted for his first weeks of life. This was, of course, very frightening, and things didn’t get easier for quite some time. He was not a robust child, and it was made worse by the healers never seeming to be able to offer a satisfactory explanation of what exactly was the matter.”
The young woman laughed, “Oh that’s just what we call her on account of her being so timid, but always enthusiastic about tea time. Loves her nibbles, this one.”
He skimmed the field of play, eyes scanning the horizon. He could see the rapids of Trent Falls from here but he couldn’t linger on the sight. He thought he saw a flicker of gold to his left, but it was just the mirage of one of his ‘teammates’ broom bristles.
Hiiii thanks for stopping by!! And thanks for the comments, I really really like hearing from you ❤❤❤
“I died for you, Harry,” she said and while Harry still couldn’t see her materialising in the room, he could picture the pretty pout she’d thrown at Ron endless times during their brief relationship. “And not a quick death, either. A slow, drawn-out painful one. I was disemboweled.” She elongated the word meaningfully. “Do you have any idea what that feels like?”
Albus screwed up his mouth and uttered an apology: “Sorry, Professor. And sorry, Rosie. I know you can be clever enough. I didn’t mean it.”
“But you always know anything worth knowing before anyone else. Merlin, I didn’t even know if it was official or not, I’d never thought to ask.”
“If you’re going to tell me what to do, try to keep it less in the vein of personal health,” Malfoy instructed.
“I hope we don’t have to have a conversation about manners, dearest,” Draco warned, his voice light. He didn’t like to scold his son, but this bit of cheek was unusual (and reeked of the Potter boys) and Draco wanted to establish a tone of civility for the evening. He forced the tension in his jaw to ease. He understood at once that his response to Scorpius’ irritation was more tied to his own damn nerves than anything. He echoed Scorpius’ sigh. It was ridiculous, this anxiety over meeting up with some old schoolmates, this concern that he ought to make the right impression. Then again, these were Harry’s oldest friends. If Draco bollocksed this up, who was to say Harry wouldn’t be turned against him, leaving this tentative bond they’d built the last couple of weeks crumbling all to ash?
sorry,” Scorpius said saccharinely. “How clumsy of me. I’m sure it’s fine, but Fife, I would keep an eye on your tongue for the next few days, if I were you.”
Pansy looked dubious. “Can he be rough enough for your tastes, do you think? I imagine he’d just be apologising for hurting you the whole time.”
Harry remained alone at the table with the pitiless tomes. They offered him no guidance. He sat with his forehead resting on his palm for a few minutes, rather at a loss. Was he supposed to leave Draco alone and give him more time? Were they supposed to have this out here and now? He’d felt so sure in the safety of Zerk’s office, but now he felt just as muddled as before. Fuck it, he needed to know. Draco owed him the truth, at the very least.
Harry felt a light touch on his fringe. He looked up. Malfoy swept his bangs to one side, holding them there while he ran the pad of his thumb ever so faintly along the scar on Harry’s forehead. Harry had barely thought about his scar in months. He didn’t know what to make of Malfoy’s focused gaze.
“If I may, Harry, it doesn’t sound like you ‘did’ anything to your friends. It sounds more like something happened to you, something frightening and stressful and quite profound, and you’re worried about how that came across to others, instead of what it was like for you.”
For the first time, a flicker of emotion crossed Draco’s composed features: a momentary pursing of his lips, the bob of his Adam’s apple. Harry felt a sudden, aching reflex to step in and wrap a protective arm around him, but he knew he couldn’t. They’d agreed to keep this thing of theirs unspoken and unacknowledged and Harry wouldn’t betray Draco’s confidence like that, no matter how much he wanted to.
“I’m not apparating you to a busy muggle street in broad daylight,” Harry signed, “And I don’t want to apparate straight into your sitting room and give your poor mother a heart attack.”
Draco scoffed. “Darling, you proclaimed me redeemed and worthy of your love in front of the entire student body and all of the faculty. I’m yours, and you’re mine, and they all fucking know it, incontrovertibly. Of course I adored every sodding, saccharine moment of it.”
“I love how compliant you are," Harry kept on, "how you listen and obey, just for me, Merlin, it’s such a turn on.”
“If you pursue potions,” Draco repeated, “you will learn that many components carry with them a sort of magical signature, or a mark of their natural potency. Work with them enough, and you will hone and extend this sense, until you can also apply it to witches and wizards.”
Draco’s arm tightened around Harry’s middle in response. “Sometimes, a hurt child needs a bit of smothering, I suspect. Preferable to the alternative."
“We’ve been split into groups,” Hiram said. “Half of us go to the first year class first and the second half goes to the fourth year class. Raoul and I,” he indicated the Ravenclaw boy with his head, “are set for fourth year charms, but I think Clark and Karan were going to first year Potions.”
Harry flipped forward a few pages Historia Medieval Magica, trying to find the actual history part of the thing, and turned towards the other boy.
“I think we can chalk that one up as a necessary evil, Harry,” Hermione said. “The exact truth doesn’t help anything, and it certainly doesn’t protect Draco. And I think the essence of the message was honest, and that’s the important thing.”
“Alright, alright,” Harry said, unable to resist a final kiss before dragging himself out of the stall, “I’m using your towel.”
Malfoy licked his lips. “Impact,” he whispered. “I like to be hit, anywhere but my cock and bollocks.” Harry winced inwardly. That was not something he’d ever considered and he was secretly relieved Malfoy wasn’t asking for it.
Harry lay in his own bed, wide awake and staring into the darkness of the canopy above him, willing himself not to think about Malfoy. It seemed to be having the reverse effect. He tried not to think about Malfoy's lean, taut arse. He tried not to think about the way his hamstring moved under his hands. What Malfoy sounded like when he gasped or hummed a low sound of pleasure.
Harry swallowed before bending the limb upwards as Madam Pomfrey had demonstrated, trying not to move too quickly. Malfoy closed his eyes and exhaled.
Winky, who was rocking a fussing Tibs, scolded the old elf gently, “The name, Breety, tell Harry Potter the name.”
Draco blinked, “It’s a cat,” he told her, like maybe she didn’t know. He went to shove the aforementioned cat off the map but Hermione let out a pitiful little yelp.
changed. But they don’t all get to have occlumency lessons or lunches or days watching quidditch with him. So we have to find other ways to convince them he’s trying.
“You don’t have to prove anything. You don’t have to endure anything you can’t endure. I’m not going to think you’re weak or a disappointment if we have to ease off. Your efforts won’t be worth less if we have to stop. I’m going to be checking in more than usual. I don’t want any lip about it and I want honest answers to my questions. Is that clear?”
at his son, and Scorpius fell like dead weight, Jamie scrambling to catch him from his awkward position behind the smaller boy.
Malfoy gave her a nasty look, but nevertheless gestured for his team to disband. Hands in his pockets, he trudged across the field towards Harry.
? Because I won’t get to when the kids are underfoot. But I’ll stop if you really don’t like being touched or what have you.”
Harry nodded, unconvinced that Malfoy would let him anywhere near his injured knee once they left the matron’s sight.
Malfoy looked drained of colour, his hands curled over the edge of the volume, clenched and trembling.
“Or how about nobody handles me at all?” Clark groused, appearing from the hallway that led to the dormitories. His brilliant turquoise hair was flopped messily to one side and he was scrubbing sleep from his eyes. “And I handle myself, which I am uniquely qualified to do. Waste of resources to have all three of you surveilling me when I know Occlumency and virtually none of the other students do.”
“Keep your bubble heads on until we’re clear of the smoke,” Harry instructed. “But they come off with a
Draco felt everything grind to a halt as an immense realisation swept over him. He very nearly couldn’t bring himself to say it out loud.
Harry shrugged, “Him and my dad were mates. Him, and Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew. All dead now. Almost everyone who really knew my parents is, it feels like.”
Harry simply snorted and poured the water into the teapot. “Just give the receipts to Hermione and she’ll reimburse you from the M.C.E.F.”
They stood a few feet apart, Draco’s pained expression meeting Harry’s determined one. For a difficult moment, Harry thought Draco was going to reject his offer, was going to walk away, to try to face his misery on his own, but then, thankfully, he caved.
Harry cringed. Apparently he was not as far removed from that angry kid as he would have liked. His behaviour in the drawing room had been abominable: violent, and reckless, and in front of his own children and Scorpius, no less. It was a terrible blunder. Malfoy was a professor at Hogwarts, for mercy’s sake, he wasn’t about to harm a student. Neither Jamie nor Albus had ever given Harry any reason to believe Malfoy was anything more sinister than a strict and exacting teacher. Harry’s response had been completely illogical, and that knowledge sat heavy in his chest. Merlin, how Malfoy must despise him.
“Hm,” Harry said. He took his time standing, stretching his neck lazily before stalking forward. His approach was slow and deliberate. He cupped Draco’s jaw in his hand and dipped in, grazing his nose along that mesmerizing pulse point. He inhaled the fresh scent of the seaside, and pressed a kiss to the hollow below Draco’s mandible. He felt Draco tense, as though Harry were something dangerous he had to steel himself against. He straightened and next kissed Draco’s mouth sweetly, trying to dispel that notion. He didn’t want fear in this. “I don’t think that’s what you want, love,” he determined, with all the soothing authority he could muster. “I expect you’ve had quite enough dressing downs for one lifetime. I think you would rather atone.” He left the word suspended in the air, his lips returning to Draco’s neck, planting kisses like seeds in every nook and hollow.
“Myrtle, please!” Urged Harry, gritting his teeth to keep from shouting. “Has anything else happened today? Anything out of the ordinary? Have you seen anyone,
Lily giggled and pointed to Draco, who was still standing beside the bed. Remy had fallen asleep again, and was drooling contentedly on Draco’s sleeve.
“You’ve still got mates,” Harry assured him, sitting down at the bench across the aisle. “Though I’m just as guilty. New relationships have a way of...sucking you in. I'm sorry if I've not been much of a friend to you this year.”
“I don’t expect it is so much The Burrow that brought him here as it is Harry. Sorry, mate, I think the jig is up,” Ron said.
He studied the array of faces before him. There were knit brows and open consideration, hesitant trust, and wide-eyed pity. It was a start.
“Yeah,” Al agreed. “Yeah, alright. Okay, so please don’t tell Professor Malfoy, because Scor never wants to be a bother, but: He doesn’t like his medicine. He says it makes him feel tired and sort of fuzzy in the head. But until he can control his prophecies, he has to be on it all the time. So I thought maybe I could find a way for him to control them, the visions, I mean. I had an idea, right? But to try it, I had to come up with a way to bring them on. So that is what we set about doing when he was visiting, and we actually found two sort of triggers: getting his heart to beat really really fast, and eating a lot of sugar. I mean, a
“You haven’t read any?!” Lily said, leaping up from her chair. “She’s the greatest Squib who ever lived. Well, I mean, she’s not real, but if she was, she would definitely be the greatest. I’ll go—”
with an address in Surrey. Smirking a bit, Harry pulled out a letter. It was handwritten, aside from the letterhead, which looked office-official.
“If I can keep my marks up,” Jamie repeated. “He said volunteer service looks good when the faculty is selecting who’s to be Head Boy.”
“Liked what, exactly?” Potter pushed. His voice was still uncertain, like he was asking even though he thought he shouldn’t.
“She told me to!” Harry insisted, “I swear, Draco, all above board here. I didn't even know I could do it, and I can't say I enjoyed it, okay? I’m definitely not in your brain, and I would
Draco was seated at his desk staring blankly at the wall, Scorpius still fast asleep before him. He didn’t react.
“Ministry employees who investigate the greatest of magical mysteries. Their research is considered dangerous in the wrong hands. Think big: gravity, time, immortality.”
Harry felt his jaw clench, maybe Hermione was right, maybe he was too angry for this. He sat down, Hermione reaching over and giving his forearm a warning squeeze.
“Hi, ah, hullo. Oh!” Harry flushed guiltily, reaching out to take one of the bags. “Dinner. Right. Thank you, er, sorry.”
“You’re only leaving for a day or two, love, not being deployed overseas," Draco chided, but the tease lacked its usual edge.
“Buggered my knee,” Draco replied, “Some arsehole got a good kick in, locked it backwards. Tried to stand and, well, I couldn’t.”
Harry was sure he’d not even known you could buy that in regular shops. Then again, Malfoy probably avoided regular shops in favour of specialty butchers’ and cheesemongers’ or something equally pretentious.
Harry shook his head as if coming out of a daze. His spell broke and Ron crashed to the ground where he remained: slumped groaning against the wall. Harry didn't register the response, his focus fixed solely on Draco and the small, screaming bundle to which he clung.
Harry checked on Remy, who was thankfully still napping, and then went down the hall to talk to Al. It wouldn’t be the most pleasant of chats, but Harry wanted this sorted before the start of term.
He’d felt badly about all the expense and all the trouble, but Harry had caught him fretting. “Oh, let Draco spoil you, at least when it comes to things you need,” he’d said. “It’s his way.”
“The first thing you need to understand is that Potter here is the most honourable wizard you’ll ever have the good fortune of learning from, understood?” Draco’s voice was crisp but not cruel.
Hermione pressed the tips of two fingers to her temple as if to suppress her own irritation. “Ron, dear,” she began, not sounding as though she was finding his current behaviour very dear at all, “sit down, please. Harry’s got something to tell us.”
Neville grinned ruefully, “Not much reason to use that spell these days. Have to admit, made me feel alive.”
“You’re preaching to the choir, Draco, honestly. So. You and Potter got on. You snogged. And then you, what, cuddled?”
Harry felt Draco slipping away and he couldn’t stand it. He sprung to his feet with frustrated, nervous energy and stepped around the table. Draco looked up at him, a series of tumultuous emotions playing over his face.
“I have an idea,” the other boy replied, his breath hot and frantic as it skated over his abdominals. He looked up at Harry and met his eyes for the first time that evening. They were shrouded with something dark, despairing and half frenzied. It unnerved Harry. He didn’t know what to say, so for a moment, he didn’t speak. Draco filled in the silence. “I want you to hurt me, Potter. You’ll like it, I know you will. I’ll be good for you, I’ll take whatever you give me. Just make it hurt, okay? Go as hard as you want. Hurt me, wreck me, ruin me for good.” His busy mouth and hands returned to Harry’s crotch and Harry froze, conflicted. For a guilty moment, he thought about Draco bared before him, tied down and marked with stripes Harry gave him. Draco writhing and crying out and taking every swift blow. His cock jerked and Draco uncovered it, swallowing it hungrily in a single, fevered gesture. Harry dug his fingers into Draco's hair with a groan, then forced the image from his head.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. “They’re shit. And I would hate to be alone afterwards. I'd probably lose it entirely if Draco didn't look out for me. So I am glad you are letting us do the same for you."
The words stung. How could all Malfoy’s efforts be tossed aside so easily? His commitment to his quidditch team and his studies, his restraint in minding his tongue and getting along, his willingness to forge new beliefs and relearn and forego all he'd known. To have that all brushed away for the sake of his name was such a cruel blow.
Without saying a word, he rose from the chair, dropped the book to a small side table, and closed the distance between them. He wrapped his arms around the other man, burying his face in his neck, and inhaling the smell of Harry’s boring, utilitarian soap.
“We cannot undo what has been done,” Harry concluded, watching Hermione mouth along the words from the front row, subconsciously—Merlin, but he loved her, the absolute, irrepressible keener—“but as we look towards our futures with hope, may we also extend kindness.”
“Yes, of course,” Scorpius hurried to inform him, shaking off the touch. He felt the adrenaline rise as his father assessed him. He wondered if his dad was trying to figure out a way to let him down gently. “I’m sorry about last night. I should have remembered my potion. It was an accident and it absolutely won’t happen again, Dad, I promise. Please may I go back to school?”
“Hn,” Harry skirted, “oh, I, ah, skimmed it." That was a lie, "I don’t generally, you know, prepare, exactly. What’s a Coozit, anyway?”
Malfoy’s misery and self-loathing sobering him, Harry rolled over, unseating Draco, so they were lying face to face. Harry reached for his wand.
After the younger students filed out, Harry approached the group of witches at the front of the room.
Thank you SO much for your patience. Everything is an exhausting mess right now, but so it goes. Thanks for reading and commenting and being so generous with your time and enthusiasm.
Together, Harry and Draco went to the new Slytherin common room to collect Clark. To Harry’s surprise, Atwal was already there, looking altogether much more alert and put together than Harry felt.
“Merlin, didn’t know my clothing was such a source of consternation for you,” Harry remarked, torn between amused and a little self conscious. Memories of drowning in Dudley’s clothes and the ensuing torment began to resurface.
With a bit more force, Harry maneuvered the other boy into a seated position, crouching in front of him. Malfoy looked desolate, gripping the edges of the sofa cushion, head hung so low Harry couldn’t make eye contact.
“Like what? Struggling? We all struggle. I know Ron’s spent a night or two on your couch over the years, when we’ve had a row.”
Seamus clapped Malfoy on the back, jovially and the four made their way back towards the common room. "Oh, definitely. Just one of the perks of shagging a Gryffindor!"
Draco extended a graceful hand for a cup, which Harry dutifully passed him. Draco sipped the tea suspiciously.
“I’ve a bit of a confession,” Harry said to the keen faces before him. “This meeting rather crept up on me and I’ve not really prepared a speech, per se. Also, I’d hate to retread ground that's already been covered by your lecture series, so perhaps we could make this more of a question and answer period?”
Harry couldn't place himself exactly, as though he were falling through darkness. All he knew was he desperate for the contact. He pressed himself against the reassuring warmth.
Harry chuckled. “They’re not like portraits,” he assured him, “She is a real person, but she’s not doing this right now. It’s a recording.”
"It's remarkable," Malfoy breathed, and Harry felt a swell of pride. Draco’s finger found the four of them lumped together in the eighth year common room.
“Like I said,” Neville explained, “not super useful. He’s been here so often and so long, so his imprints are all over the place." Harry could see what he meant. In many places, the paths were so well tread that they were more smears of gold than individual prints. "But we could send groups to follow where they lead? Mark off the ones we have checked? The more recent ones are a slightly brighter hue, so that might help, too."
Professor Malfoy laughed: a quiet rumble that Jamie hadn’t heard often. “Didn’t your father teach you it’s rude to ask such questions?”
“Mr. Potter?” Scorpius said, and Harry knew at once the kid was lucid now, sounding groggy and confused. “What’s happened? Where’s Al?”
Potter dropped his hold and stepped away, eliciting an involuntary, pitiful sound from Draco’s throat.
“Not teaching you hardly robs him of his credentials, love. And if he wants to be left alone to read the paper, you ought to leave him be,” Potter scolded gently.
“I plan on it—” insisted James, as though potion mastery was his lifelong ambition, and not a suggestion made to him that morning. Draco raised a warning eyebrow. “Sorry,” James muttered. “I shouldn’t have interrupted.”
The moment Draco’s muscles eased, Harry landed another harsh blow. Draco gasped at the shock of it, twisting uselessly in position.
“How can you?" Draco muttered, "I didn’t even do anything today. How many times do you save the bloody day while I stand idly by. Hell, it might have been easier for you if I hadn’t been there. Brown wouldn’t have had leverage against you, then.”
Hey all, wasn't sure I should post this week because I know the news has been an absolute dystopian nightmare and I don't want to pretend I'm not bothered and upset by it. But then I thought maybe fic is acting as a bit of a reprieve from the real world for some folks? So I posted anyway. So. Sorry everything sucks. I wish it didn't.
"It is an interesting development," she continued, "My guess is that with Malfoy, it’s just a power thing. The war stripped him of a lot of his pride, I suppose he sees this as a way to get it back.”
“And that led to Mr. Tiering placing himself in an incredibly dangerous situation and, I understand, abducting Mr. Atwal?”
“Sorry, Dad,” James corrected himself, less earnest this time, but Draco deemed it adequate. He could tell the boy was blinded with his own misery, but wounding Potter surely wouldn’t help the issue. Draco had no intention of permitting such behaviour in his presence.
“That’s the spirit!” Harry grinned, “‘Mione, will you make sure to run it by Neville and  Ginny, make sure they don’t think we’re making a colossal mistake?”
Harry left him there for a long, suspended moment. He watched in aroused interest as Draco attempted to shift his weight from knee to knee, tried to seek relief without disobeying. Draco was shaking now, his muscles fatigued and protesting, and all for Harry. It was gorgeous.
Pansy always commended Draco for sticking to one child. “One child means only one teenager,” she’d say, sagely, as though she’d survived the latter herself. Draco wasn't fazed at the thought, however. He doubted Scorpius even at his most rebellious would measure up to what Draco had survived during his decade teaching at Hogwarts.
“I’ve got to—” he cut himself off, unable to come up with a convincing lie. He just clamoured off the bench and strode away, alone.
Draco forced his heels back to the ground, woodenly turning and doing as he was told. Soon, he was standing before Harry, naked and helpless.
Malfoy shifted his leg away from Harry’s to illustrate his displeasure, and Harry, to his own astonishment, reached beneath the table and rested a hand just above the Slytherin's knee, giving a gentle squeeze. He promised himself he would pull his hand back after a moment. He just wanted to communicate some sense of solidarity, or a plea to at least try.
Dinner was chaos. Jamie looked generally irritated—Teddy had left to do a bit of travelling before his term resumed and Jamie was clearly feeling the loss—and the rest of the kids were hyped-up with each other’s company. Hugo, a fidgety child a year or so younger than Lily was desperately trying to get a word in edgewise, but was being chronically sidelined by his sister and Harry’s lot who were laughing about something Harry couldn’t follow at all. Ron was sullen and withdrawn, but thankfully Hermione and Draco were managing to make pleasant conversation.
“Yeah,” Al agreed. “See? Come on, Dad. How about I go put on the kettle? Jamie and I can make breakfast, how’s that? I won’t even tell him he’s doing things wrong, even when he does, so we’ll stay civil. And you two can talk, and Professor Malfoy can tell you he wouldn’t hurt Scor, because if he had I would know about it, right, Scor?”
“You have now completed the second section. Our next section measures raw speed. At the green light, you may proceed in a forward direction. Stop when you see the light change to red.” Shanna’s voice instructed.
“Oh,” another voice sounded from the doorway. Draco leaped back, Harry scrambled for his glasses, smashing them onto his face.
He felt his prick stir with interest as he thought of a firm hand circling his throat and a vicious assault on his body. Suddenly, urgently, he wanted to be taken, but he and Harry hadn’t even discussed that yet, and what was more, Harry was asleep after a long day and a long week, and he didn’t fucking need Draco waking him up and demanding a full-on scene, for fuck’s sake.
“Where did it get to,” Ron was was saying “neither Sitthi nor Pedura seem to have eyes on it, that sneaky little snitch!”
“Oh shove off,” Harry said, tiredly, but he found himself repressing a smile. It was admittedly, a bit ludicrous.
At that moment, Nearly-Headless Nick floated through the doorway, followed by the other house ghosts, Moaning Myrtle, and a few other spectres Harry vaguely recognised.
“We just,” whatever Draco was hoping to say died on his tongue. He sighed, exasperated with the rush of helplessness that threatened to overwhelm him. “We got on.”
“I’ve been thinking,” Lily said, her blue eyes serious. Merlin, she looked so much like Ginny that Harry almost wanted to look away. “I’m ten now, and I'll be headed to Hogwarts next year.”
Draco found himself genuinely surprised. He’d thought this might be a solution to the tension that accumulated in Potter’s shoulders that morning at Gringotts. “May I inquire as to your reasons for refusal? Only Heads of Houses are required to remain on the grounds overnight, and they’ve added a day nursery for the children of faculty.”
“Hey, Dean?” He said suddenly, “Maybe we should make a couple of quidditch teams anyway? Not for the cup or anything, but would be good to play, you know?”
Harry shoved down his pants, taking his cock in his hand in earnest, “Touch yourself. Keep yourself desperate,” he ordered.
Harry ruffled Draco’s hair, which earned him a smacked hand and a disdainful look (both worth it), and wandered off among the stacks. He’d just located a second volume—
“We just went for a fly over the, er, grounds. I always forget how much space you have out here,” Clark told her. “Then we sat by the stream and read for a bit.” He didn’t mention the topic of his reading material, which Draco had noticed was an amateurly printed pamphlet with mimeographed block letters spelling out ‘EAT THE RICH’ on the cover.
How Draco managed to look down his nose at Harry when Harry was a good few inches taller, Harry would never know, but that was just what the other boy did. “I didn’t think so, Potter, until you put all this stock in the baseless ramblings of a witch with the surname
“Obviously you think so,” Harry sighed, “but it’s dress robes or school clothes, those are your options and I’m not too fussed either way.”
“Mm, conditioned just for me. Getting off to thoughts of not getting off. My own little paradox. I’m close, sweetheart. Soon I’m going to come in your lovely arse, and then we’re going to get dressed and head back to the dormitory, and I won’t be touching your prick tonight, and neither will you. So if you want to get off, you’d better make it quick, and you better make it just like this, with just my cock inside of you. Otherwise, you’ll be tucked into bed aching and wanting, until I decide to—”
“You’re a good kid,” Harry said, stepping up behind Clark and putting his hands on his shoulders. He gave a comforting little squeeze. “You know that?”
“Because some time ago, bad things were done here,” Mother explained delicately. “But that’s all over now, precious.”
For Harry, there was a standard DL white envelope. In the top left corner was the ink left by a rubber stamp:
“Be honest now,” Seamus said, as he poured out six glasses of firewhisky in the common room. The rest of the eighth years were having a Valentine’s party. Neville was sitting glumly by the fire, while others drank and danced, the furniture shoved up against walls. “Did you orchestrate that ridiculous saviour routine, Malfoy?”
Al was only half listening. He scanned the crowd instead. His cousin Rose was sitting at attention with her hands clasped, doing her very best to show everyone just how attentive she was being. The girl nerd squad which was ever flanking her was doing just the same. Jamie and his friends were surrounded, as ever, by nine-tenths of the Gryffindor house. It was like the whole lot of them moved as one mindless pack, with the one token Ravenclaw shoved in between Jamie and Fortitude Jordan.
“Nor did he think about anyone but himself. I’ve been there, Harry, and it took me a long time to climb out of that particular hole. I don’t want him to go through the same. A bit of understanding now, even if it was painful, will help him avoid the same in future.”
“But you won’t be here next year,” Clark muttered, yanking tight the drawstrings on the bag of stones and slinging it over his shoulder.
Olivier Rivers was beautiful as he was distant. Even after weeks of practice, Harry didn’t feel like he knew the Ravenclaw any better. What he did know was that he took quidditch very, very seriously. Tonight he whipped bludgers at Brocklehurst, who batted them forcefully in Harry’s direction. Harry weaved and darted around them, feinting in all directions. Nevertheless, Mandy was a powerful and exacting beater, and she still landed several decent hits. They would leave rounded welts on his chest and arms that Draco would scowl at when he got Harry shirtless at night.
“Fuck,” Harry echoed, then reached out, grabbing Malfoy’s arm, “Wait, Malfoy, stop, I’m sorry. This is, fuck, this is the exact opposite of what I came here to do.”
Hermione was unconvinced. “Until someone lets it slip, or you want work done on the place, which I can only assume you do, and you have workers coming and going. An ounce of prevention, et cetera.”
? Jamie wondered. It was clear that some discussion had occurred between the two. Scorpius must have advocated for Al and Jamie to arrive at a truce of sorts.
Harry chuckled, and together, they leaned back against the pillows stacked up in front of the headboard, Harry’s arm still steady and comforting around him. Clark felt better, just being here.
Draco wondered if he should make some civil remark, but it wasn’t his fault he was here. He was not the one who had suggested they share a meal, for goodness’ sake. It was Potter’s mess, and he could sort it.
Pushing aside his exhaustion, Harry followed him out and down the corridor. Clark was there, hands shoved in his pockets, eyes red-rimmed and doleful.
“That’s quite enough,” Harry said. His tone was deathly indifference as he wrapped his wandless magic around Malfoy’s throat and mercilessly cinched it in. The invisible garrot left just enough space for the other man to breathe, but the moment he tried to speak, it tightened in warning. Malfoy’s hands flew to his neck, the blue veins visible through his pale skin as he clawed at the suffocating force. “If you take issue with my son, you take issue with me. When you’ve calmed down, I’m happy to discuss it with you, in private, and not as part of a dramatic display in front of our children. Am I quite understood?”
Harry couldn’t speak, he only clung to the dark fabric of Draco’s undershirt, weeping breathlessly against Malfoy’s prominent collarbone. Draco clucked and fussed over him, petting his hair and kissing his head, but Harry couldn’t seem to calm down. He couldn’t get the image out of his head.
“Better,” Harry assessed, “I know where I am and how I got here. Things feel like they are making sense again.”
Frustrated, Draco spun in Harry’s arms and burrowed into Harry’s chest. This contact, this warmth, it would be enough, Draco would make it be enough, because now that he had it—the intimacy, the companionship, and Harry’s sprawling affection—Draco couldn’t bear the idea of living without it. Draco grimaced against Harry’s skin, crawling with self disgust. When had he become this dependent, insecure, desperate thing? Whatever happened, he wouldn’t let Harry see him like this.
“Good,” Harry smiled patronizingly, kissing Draco’s neck, “I’m so glad you agree. You’ll tell me if you can’t handle it, understand?”
Harry left to use the lav after the soup, navigating his way through a dark passage dotted with candlelight. Again, he thought about casting a light spell, but knew that it would be looked down upon by the staff. He also supposed he couldn’t be too grumpy about the darkness, as it did provide a level of privacy he wasn’t anticipating.
“No,” Harry growled, wishing like hell he could stop that smart mouth with his own. “Now stop being difficult so I can take you on a damned date.”
. Of course he did, Draco chided himself. This was Harry Potter after all. Helping was the supposed cornerstone of the man’ s entire personality, if the gossip columns were to be believed. While Potter’s presence in the public eye had lessened over the years, he continued to pop up from time to time, lending support to various foundations and charities. Draco had seen Potter’s wooden smile and congenial handshakes with ministers splashed across a hundred
Breety’s head continued to nod and Harry wasn’t sure if she was confirming or if it was just an ongoing tremor until she spoke again, “Oh, aye, Harry Potter, Breety sees, Breety knows!”
, thankful at least that he would be getting that back. Shanna muttered a few spells under her breath. A puff of chartreuse smoke darted along the length of the broom, spinning in intricate little patterns as it ran its course. “All clear,” Shanna said again.
The attack, McGonagall had explained over breakfast to a very distrustful great hall on Monday morning, had been orchestrated to turn the other houses against Slytherins, and to undermine the efforts towards interhouse unity. The precise motive behind all that was yet to be determined, but students were advised to be stalwart in their friendships.
When Jared next looked up, there was another dark-haired lady there. She looked a little like Jared felt: like all this noise and bother was a bit much, really.
with you all in the spring. This spell, you’ll remember, allows apparition to a site of safety with only a feeling and not a specific focus point. I had hoped it would not come in useful any time soon, but hopes are often dashed.
“He didn’t have much choice,” Harry informed his son. “He’d have been tortured or worse if he’d said a word against Voldemort.”
“You’re not serious,” Malfoy interrupted. The four of them were in a corner table of the library that evening, discussing what Harry had learned about the Browns at the memorial, “we’re going with the cat conspiracy? Truly? Have you all lost it completely?”
“Or you could consider there’s more than just those two options,” Zerk offered gently, “you could all just take care of each other.”
“Oh,” she said, finally, looking up from where she had the back half of the magazine folded over the front, hiding the cover for Ron and Harry’s sakes. Her face was pink and her eyes a little dewy, “Oh, Harry, it’s really lovely.”
Malfoy looked up at him, and Harry eyed that long expanse of neck, wanting to get his teeth into it again.
Clark scoffed, “Bit rich coming from you. All you do is order Harry around and I don’t think I’ve ever heard you once say please. Get the tea, Potter. Get the door, Potter. Carry my bag, Potter.”
“Of course you do,” Draco shook his head, somewhat dazed, but he righted his chair and seated himself behind the desk.
“McGonagall said she’ll have the aurors question Mrs. Brown about it, see what they can get out of her,” Ron explained to Harry. “We didn’t want to wake you.”
Draco gave another bark of laughter, “I’m a right miserable blighter and we both know it," he sighed heavily, "Well, I’ll have to settle for letting you distract me and I'll deal with tomorrow tomorrow. Let’s get to Gladrags. Dressing you up however I please can only help.”
“No,” Harry agreed, pulling her in for a brief, fierce hug. “It’s not right, but we’ll deal with it. You’re dealing with it.” He stepped back, letting his hands squeeze her shoulders.
“Why don’t you go get showered and dressed, Potter? I’m sure I can entertain myself well enough in the meantime.”
“Oh no!” Albus remarked, his eyes growing round. He clutched a farcical hand to his throat. “I feel it coming on!
Instead of opening them, Draco screwed his eyes closed harder, features twisting as if afflicted. Then, giving into some emotion Harry couldn’t understand, they relaxed. His eyelids fluttered open and his gaze met Harry’s, nervous but steady.
"I agree," Harry responded and Malfoy's features smoothed with relief, "You are. And I can do anything I want with you, but I'd rather only do things to our mutual enjoyment."
Footsteps echoed and Harry grabbed Draco’s arm and they turned to run. Hermione and Ron must have come to the same conclusion because they hurried down the stairs also. They tore through the hallways, Ron and Hermione earning confused looks from startled students.
An extra special thanks to my superlative beta, Mimbelwimbel for her wise observations and willingness to discuss fic with me endlessly!
For a mad moment, Draco thought about leaving. Maybe he could just sneak away and find someone for the night. It wasn’t late, the clubs would still be open. That way he wouldn’t have to bother Harry, and besides, he’d be settled tomorrow if he could just take care of this compulsion.
Harry shook his head, “I think he still half-worships you. He won’t want you to see him like this. I’ll go.”
“Shut up, Al. I’m allowed to talk to people. There’s no law against that.” Lily flipped her long ponytail over her shoulder, and began to braid it. She sniffed, her little button nose raising superciliously into the air. “Professor Malfoy,” she began, as if to prove her point about talking to people, “did Dad tell you about
Draco gave a nod, he’d tried to ignore the salacious headlines, but he’d gotten the gist over the years.
Clark picked up the cage and carried it to the front counter. Harry wandered the aisles while the boy peppered the employee with questions. Draco followed along behind to pay.
“You’re misconstruing my words. I’m not saying that, you know I’m not. He can grow and change all he wants. I just don't know why
Harry grinned ruefully, “Motivational naming. I think she’ll come round. How about you, Clark, have you settled on a name?”
Draco swallowed and eased himself back. Sweat collected at his hairline and his thighs began to tremble.
“Your attention, please!” Hermione announced in a calm, officious voice to the stunned and frantic student body. “DA members: If you are not assigned to a Slytherin full moon buddy, and you feel confident with your
“I won't have you resenting me for the entirety of your adult life, Potter. Think, for once, would you?” Draco was scowling, his cheeks an angry pink, and his eyebrows furrowed. A little omega symbol formed with the crease there. Harry wanted to kiss it, smooth it over.
Harry shook his head, “Er, no thanks. Just here to, ah, take the job, I guess. Sign the paperwork or what have you.”
And an extra big thank you to my glorious beta, Mimbelwimbel for her edits and attention. All remaining mistakes are my own! (Probably because I can't resist making last minute additions!).
and the howler burst into flames. Harry was blushing fuchsia and the whole lot of them were a frazzled mess.
“And you didn’t think that was something of which I should have been made aware? You’re even more inept than I first believed.”
“Well, surely they know about this one,” Draco remarked, coursing gentle fingers over the lightning bolt tucked away beneath Harry’s fringe.
“Uh, hi?” He said. The kid was gangly, with a safety pin shoved through his ear and shimmering eyeliner lining his lower lid. He looked like a child in the costume of a teenager and it was an uncanny disparity. He also had that defiant chin tilt that reminded Harry so much of Malfoy.
Harry’s legs fell apart and he reached a hand out, encircling Draco’s wrist and giving a gentle tug.
Malfoy gave a lofty shrug, “A lot of very dull dinners as a child where my father and his friends would expound ad nauseum on various pairings.”
“And you don’t think if you got to know other Slytherins, you might not feel the same? Lavender, this is insane!”
“Good,” Draco sighed, “I’m going to take my hands off now so I can kiss you properly, but for fuck’s sake please just keep your feelings off me for a few minutes so I can...re-calibrate.”
Draco left first, waiting long moments for Potter to appear in the drawing room. Finally, he did, stepping out of the fire and shooting Draco a puzzled look. “What on earth is going on with y—”
“Why not?” Harry asked innocently. “Surely you’ve nothing to hide. Besides, if you weren't known for rifling through my business, we wouldn't feel the need to rifle through yours.”
“Well, ours is less harbinger and more just death,” Ron said, “so I think we’re in the clear to off her.”
Draco sank into the sofa beside Harry, then stretched out, his head in Harry’s lap and his ankles crossed up on the armrest.
Harry was torn between pushing the Draco off him, and pulling him close. Draco’s touch always made him feel better, even now, when everything else about him frustrated Harry to no end.
Four miniature (which Harry had hardly thought possible) Hirams bounded into the room. They paused when they saw him, retreating back behind their father’s legs. If Harry had to guess, he’d lump them all in between the ages of four and eight, each of them tiny, scrawny things with dark hair and big, moonish eyes.
It took Harry and Ron quite some time to reach the great hall. Harry had to stop every dozen steps to catch breath that wouldn’t be caught. When they did arrive, Madam Pomfrey had things well in hand. The whole hall was transformed into a field hospital: ordered cots occupied by first and second year boys still cocooned in their bubbles took the place of tables and benches. There a queue of older Slytherins and other students who had helped with combating the fiendfyre forming to be checked over.
“Now, Scorpius,” Draco repeated sternly. The boy scampered off with a final huff.  Draco turned his gaze back upon Harry. “I suppose you’re not here simply to reminisce?”
Clark slumps forward and buries his face in his hands. Harry’s palm shifts until it is a warm presence between his shoulder blades and Clark hates that he needs to be comforted. He thought he was more self-sufficient than this.
“Right,” Harry noted, the to-do list in his head growing precariously long. “I’ll pick some up today.”
The baby started crying then, heralding the end of his nap, so Harry made for his own room, where Remy’s cot was kept. Remy was flailing about in his little sleep sack, face red and displeased.
From the closet, Lily dragged the aforementioned squid, which was really more just like a grey heap of wool with a few fraying tendrils, and presented it to Draco.
They went upstairs and Jared changed into his pyjamas. Then Draco made him brush his teeth and wash his face, proving that Christmas wasn’t, in fact, all that special in the end. Jared was too tired to whinge, though, and soon he was tucked under the covers of the room that was robin’s egg blue and completely his. Clark had chosen nothing but black for the walls of his room. Jared wouldn’t say it, but he didn’t like going in there. He thought something might be lurking out of sight.
Harry didn’t know what to say. Penelope was so frank, so open, that he was left a bit stunned. Oh, he’d been through it after the war, but it hadn’t felt quite normal back then, like something he’d had to get through to move on with his life. Penelope made it sound really quite ordinary.
Draco was a careful wizard. He was precise and effective. His magic was tidy, but potent. He knew he was skilled. Potter’s was another beast entirely. It was reactive and coarse and raw. Hence his miserable attempts at potions, Draco supposed, remembering all of Severus Snape’s biting remarks. Potions were finicky; they required specificity in a way that defense magic rarely did. Potter never had the makings of a potions master, but that hardly mattered. Between them, he was by far the more powerful.
There was no response. Another long minute passed, and then Harry felt the hem of his shirt pulled out from his trousers and shucked up to his navel. Draco pressed his lips to Harry’s hipbone and then again alongside his bellybutton. A firm hand gripped his thigh and Draco nuzzled into his groin. Harry felt dizzy with the change of mood and while his cock was certainly paying attention, he wasn’t sure it should.
Scorpius only managed to get down one slice of toast before dozing off again at the table, his cheek in his hand. He really must be exhausted, Draco mused, as usually the boy would never prop an elbow up on the dinner table.
“How come you never told me that?” Al asked Harry. “You only told me about his being a double agent and a hero and all that.”
Draco swallowed, closed his eyes for a moment, when he opened them again he looked hesitant and ashamed, “I mean...I went for you. I stunned Awling—honestly, I’m surprised I didn’t try to kill her—and then I went for you. Even though the
“How convenient then, that there are five of us," Hermione quipped. "Pansy and I are already friendly—we’ve been studying arithmancy together,” she continued, ignoring everyone’s surprised expressions, “Ginny, you take Daphne, Neville, you’re with Millicent, Ron, Goyle and Harry, Malfoy, obviously.”
But she didn’t. With a final anguished cry, she was gone, leaving only the brocade chair sitting benignly in her frame.
“I could tell,” Harry replied. “You’re so stubborn sometimes—not giving in when you need to, even when it will do you some good.”
“I should have been paying attention to the time,” Draco muttered, his voice hushed and bitter. He pulled away from Harry’s touch, as though he didn’t deserve it. “It is a nightly occurrence, Scorpius coming round for his potion, how could I just forget?”
“I’ll get a cellular,” Harry decides, and Clark can tell no argument over the cost will dissuade him this time. “I’ll call as often as I need to. If things aren’t going well, we’ll step in. We have our contacts with the Ministry for Child Welfare. They are aware of the situation.”
Draco snorted. “Just don’t come crying to me when you have the school board on your case. Never mind, you’re
“Perfectly safe,” Draco promised with a smile. “Not an unrepentant Death Eater to be found. But, if it will make you feel better, I promise to keep an eye on your father for you. After all, I owe him a life debt.”
Harry’s features smoothed and he smiled. “Hey,” he murmured sweetly. He backed up a few feet and sank into the upholstered chair beside the window. “Come here.”
Ron looked thrilled, “I won’t let you down, Headmistress, thank you for this.” He tucked the key in a pocket, giving it a happy pat.
She handed him the neat pile and Harry felt both like he was receiving something precious, but that feeling was quickly usurped by his anxious disappointment over the map.
“Yeah, of course,” Potter agreed. “Can it wait a bit, though? I know it seems like he’s been reckless but he’s also upset. His heart was in the right place and such. It’s just that he’s hurting, we’re all hurting, and he didn’t want to—” Potter’s voice broke, his frustration devolving into sorrow. “He didn’t want to fucking inconvenience me. Hell, I’ve bollocksed this all up. So busy moping, my own kids feel like they can’t talk to me. And here am I, moping some more. Well.” He took a long sip of his Firewhisky. “I’ve got to get it together, is all. I’ve no choice.”
“Good. Alright, so. This is Mission: Vampire, because I’ve actually decided that you’re a vampire.” Her tone changed to one of pitying placation: “That’s okay, you know. It just means you’re different and not really sick at all, actually. Godiva Goodstrives’ Uncle Lester is a vampire, so I know an awful lot about them, and they are really pale because they don’t have any blood of their own.”
“Wasn’t doing anything else,” Draco offered by way of explanation. Harry shook his head but stepped in closer, a hand coming to Draco’s hip.
“It’s not unusual for people denied physical comfort for a long period to feel that way,” Zerk told him.
“No,” Harry answered. “I know she’s safe, Ron’s told me so. I don’t know where she is, I don’t need to know, but there's no foul play." He didn't admit that he almost wished there was, because that would mean she hadn't meant it, hadn't just up and gone and left them all devastated. "She just...couldn’t do all this, I suppose.”
The shop was dim and quiet, a fluttery sound like hundreds of pages being turned sounding as the trio entered. A brown-skinned one-eyed man greeted them with a grunt when they entered, but Clark was bursting with so much excitement he didn’t even acknowledge the attendant.
“Absolutely,” Main assured him, as though he’d had simply the best summer one could imagine. “Hope yours was splendid, too. So great to have your dad join us at Hogwarts; we’re all terribly humbled by his being here.”
A response caught in Draco’s throat, unexpectedly. He’d decided ages ago to not waste time being ashamed of his proclivities, and he’d not looked back. But picking up nameless men in clubs that catered specifically to his tastes was one thing; admitting his masochism to Harry bloody Potter was another.
“That’s on him,” Draco growled, “He’s a murderer, a torturer, a snivelling acolyte, and that was my path, my inheritance. If it weren’t for Harry, I’d be dead or in Azkaban. That’s the legacy Father raised me to. Well, I don’t want it.”
“Sorry,” he told her from the sofa where he’d collapsed, but she didn’t respond other than to ruffle her feathers and sink her head part way into her body.
Harry straightened, finding Malfoy's mouth with his own, tongue invading that insolent mouth, silencing it.
Clark was looking at his shoes, the back of his skinny neck all red with discomfort as they walked down the corridor together. “It’s not that I don’t like them, exactly,” he said. "they are obviously very...nice. Like really, really nice. And I don’t want you to think I’m not grateful. I needed new ones because of the fire and because I won’t stop growing and outgrowing every damn thing I own.”
Harry shook his head, “I was a scared, miserable orphan in a new, alienating world. Believe me, I didn’t need any more humbling.”
CWs: references to canon-typical violence, Hegwig's death, animals in cages, canon-typical ableist-language.
Draco felt disappointment curl low in his belly but he nodded, returning his head to rest against his forearms. He resolved to himself that he’d not stop Harry, no matter what. He wanted to take whatever was on offer tonight, no matter how difficult.
Harry wasn’t so easily baited, he was more distracted by the way Malfoy was guarding his midsection, clenching his teeth, and wincing whenever they fell out of step. His injuries were apparently more severe than Harry had realised. He felt the wave of rage building again and clamped it back down.
that sort of thing so much but if it was too much or you’d like something else I would rather you tell me.”
“I—No,” Scorpius gave a jerk of his head. Harry was quite certain it was a lie. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to be a bother.”
“Sorry to disrupt you, Professor,” he said, when they were alone. “And sorry for not being in class on time.”
By the morning of Christmas Eve, the entire household was aware of Harry’s mystery boyfriend. It was a mixed blessing. On the one hand, Harry felt so loved and supported: everyone seemed so pleased; they kept telling him how glad they were that he'd have found someone. On the other hand, it just made Harry feel like he had that much more to lose when they learned just who he’d found.
“And I’ll make sure every penny of profit goes to the foundation, or we can give it to a more worthy cause; we’re open to your suggestions.”
“No,” Ron admitted, “but, after checking out the pitch and stands and the equipment shed and finding nothing, I had the brilliant idea of checking the kitchens.”
Clark just nodded, “I had to see a school counselor a few times after the thing with Jared almost dying. They’re alright.”
Ron’s jaw dropped as he stared at Harry, gobsmacked. Hermione gave him a knowing look, because of course nothing came as news to her, but she hid it quickly with a sincere smile. Hugo looked like he might say something but just blew out his lips, still cowed from his admonition over the raspberry.
“Not like anyone is going to go half speed at trial day,” Harry would remind him, “besides, it’s good practice for me to stay on my broom and regroup in a hurry.”
“It’s just a lot, isn’t it?” Harry muttered, “Knowing that everyone we love is going to die and we don’t know if it is soon or a long ways off, or if it will be painful or peaceful. And we all know that but we still just go through our days like it isn’t true, like we aren’t all just waiting for death.”
“Well, I wasn’t thinking we would exactly divulge the plan at all,” Hermione explained, “I thought we would just make some friendly gestures, build some relationships, that’s all.”
“Yes, I’m quite alright, thank you, Potter,” Draco assured the other man, when he realised he’d left the question hanging unanswered for a moment too long. “Scorpius has been well, he enjoyed his school year. His friendship with Albus, while frustrating in its own right, has brought him a lot of happiness.”
“Yeah,” Harry said quietly, studying Draco’s face as though he were looking for something. “Well, thanks, then. Sorry Lily stole your broom.”
“Sirius left it to me,” Harry said, “Was used for Order business but now I suppose it is just mine, again. I should stop in and see if Kreacher—he’s a house elf—is, well, still alive. We could just, I don’t know, be there, together, for a bit. We can’t watch telly or anything because the service people can never find the door, but—”
“Why don’t you go ask Kreacher to cook you some up,” Harry chuckled. “And ask him to please bring some tea, as well, if you would.”
“Yeah,” Weasley huffed. “Nothing but a bloody predator. He’s not got any money so I assume you must be going for fame or public adoration or something equally self-serving.”
Harry was surprised by this. “I was never an academic, not like you or Hermione. Transfiguration is still a chore, and Potions I’ve quite given up on.”
“Costs a fortune to feed, and frankly, I’m not convinced she’ll ever deliver post. Afraid of her own shadow, some days.”
Pansy sat up, her eyes narrowed as she leant forward. Her expression was keen and curious. “Something’s happened,” she accused.
“Look,” Hermione suggested, “why don’t we make it an eighth year project. You’ve still got all that Firewhiskey George secreted away in your trunk. Anyone who helps out can have a drink.”
“No, out you go. Muck about in the garden or take some broomsticks from the shed and fly about the grounds.”
“I’m not saying he’s not made great strides,” Ginny remarked, “but this sort of thing would devolve him right to primordial ooze. Few are as irritatingly charming as Malfoy, when he sets his mind to it, Harry, I’ll give you that.”
Malfoy gave him an affronted look, “Well, maybe my team of  miscreants won’t fare too badly against yours, then, although I really don’t think lackadaisical leadership is something you should be bragging about.”
Malfoy raised a defensive hand, “Sorry, sorry, interhouse unity, I know, Potter, but she’s untenable, you must see that.”
McGonagall smiled indulgently at him, “This is unfortunately not an anomaly; every year many students from each house struggle to make the transition. It is only October; I’m sure by the holiday break we will have far fewer lonely souls. And your Quidditch idea is a strong one, I think. I will allow first years to fly outside of lessons if accompanied by a sixth year or higher, and,” she said, passing a large brass key across her desk to Ron, “Here’s a key to the broom storage and Quidditch equipment shed, for your use only, Mr. Weasley—you will be held responsible for the dispersing and collecting of supplies to those without their own.”
“No,” Draco cut in. There was a trembling to his words that he couldn’t suppress, despite his obvious effort. “It doesn’t. The things I did were inexcusable. I know, because I live with them daily. I’m sorry for those I hurt and for those you lost. I was misguided and misled and steeped in harmful beliefs since the day I was born.” Draco paused to swallow. There was tightness to the sinews in his neck that Harry wanted to ease, but his eyes were clear. He took a steadying breath and continued. “I cannot undo the past, Weasley, but I have since tried to live decently. If there is some other atonement you demand of me, by all means, tell me and I’ll gladly consider it.”
“Go ahead, Potter,” Malfoy goaded, pressing impossibly closer. His lips brushed the hollow before Harry’s ear, but Harry couldn’t move, fixated on the torturous truths. Harry couldn't track from where this sudden, strange intensity had arisen. It left him discomfited: trapped and confused. “You think I don’t know how close you came to snapping my neck in front of my own son? I do. I fucking know you. I know you like no one else, isn't that right? So if you’re going to maim me again, you might as well get it over with.” Malfoy’s teeth flashed white, scraping against Harry’s jaw. Harry gasped painfully. He couldn’t make sense of the gesture, not until Malfoy shifted forward, the hard line of his cock stark evidence against Harry’s hipbone.
Harry chuckled at Ron’s assessment, understanding why Ron would have come up with the interpretation he did. “I don’t know,” he answered honestly. “I thought the same thing when he first showed up. But with time, I’ve found that he’s actually sort of, like, secretly generous although he’d never admit it, and he gives a fuck about his job and the kids, and we can just...talk. Neither of us had a good time of things growing up, so I think we understand each other on that level, and there’s shared history, in a way, with school and the war, and all. Probably helps that he’s divorced, too, so, you know, it’s nice to have someone who’s been through it and come out the other side.”
“Why would you though?” Jones pressed. “Hanging round lots of young boys, are we Malfoy? Hoping to corrupt and sway them to your cause?”
“I know what you're thinking, and don’t you dare send your bloody stag racing off to find Tiering. You embarrass him enough as it is.”
“No one ruined Christmas, love,” Harry protests. “We all had a wonderful morning, didn’t we? And it was a nice visit with the Weasleys. No one is judging your mum for having a sherry or two more than she’d planned. We’ve all done that, believe me. And I know you’re worried about what’s to come, but will help in whatever way we can, I promise. If she needs us to take Jared for a while, we’ll make it work. We always will.”
“Don’t worry, Hermione,” Harry told her, not liking to see his friend bothered and wishing he could share the lovely bloom of serenity in his chest, “Everything will work out.”
“I rather think I did,” Draco said. “I’ll not have you fall back into the silent martyr routine, it doesn’t do anyone any good.”
“I know,” Harry acknowledged. He ran his hand down the boy's back, soothingly. “I’m sorry. I do like to give you your privacy, but you’ve got us all worried, love.”
So Harry very gingerly put an arm around the gangly boy’s shoulders. He felt Clark stiffen momentarily before settling into his side, wriggling closer. Harry relaxed, too, then, allowing Clark's shoulders to bear the weight of his arm. He pressed his cheek to the bared scalp beside the freshly cut—and freshly turquoise—mohawk, just for a moment. The shorn hair was baby soft and tickled.
“You’re not just my best mate,” Harry mumbled, Firewhisky definitely not helping contain the grateful bloom of emotion, “you and Hermione, you’ve given me all the family I’ve got.”
Well, the Potter boys were two reasonably intelligent children, so they ought to know these things for themselves. Albus announced he was in need of shoes that didn’t pinch, and so marched off towards the rear of the store, Scorpius at his heels.
Draco cleared the table and finished up the last of the dishes, banishing the toast crumbs from the dining room with a satisfying little spell he’d picked up when Scorpius had been tiny and getting his meals everywhere except into his mouth. He smiled at the memory. Draco hadn’t minded the baby stage, when Scorpius was a warm little lump in his arms for much of the time, but fatherhood had been even more fun when things had started to change. He could still remember watching Scorpius’ small, serious face contemplate new foods and flavours, his tentative exploration of the nursery at the manor, the charming, nonsensical baby babble. It wouldn’t be long now before Remy would be doing the same, a few more months now and he’d be tearing about on all fours, as fearless as his siblings.
“What are you talking about?” Potter demanded, looking taken off guard. Good, served the man right for interrupting what could have been a much more satisfying use of their collective time.
“That’s not what I meant and you know it,” Harry snapped back, “Your mum did right by me in the war. So did you even, that night you pretended not to recognise us at the manor.  I told the Wizengamot as much. I asked them to give you both a second chance. Which you must know, beause it’s why you're here and she's not in Azkaban.”
Harry bit back a laugh at Clark's complete inability to play it cool, despite his best attempts. “Always have a moment for you, love,” he promised. Clark blushed, looking caught somewhere between pleased and mortified. Harry turned back to Ron and Hermione. “Thanks, you two. Talk later?”
CWs: references to canonical child abuse/neglect, violence, whorephobic language, some possessive language and unhealthy attachment, probably.
Harry sent Hiram and his paired Ravenclaw off to the dormitory to find something of Clark’s. They returned with his potions cauldron.
Across the table from him, Neville and Millicent were chatting on about catnip—Neville supposed he could grow some in the Herbology greenhouses and Millicent seemed quite elated with this news: “Oh, Tartarus is adorable on catnip,” the witch was saying, “something about her expression, Longbottom, it’s classic, you simply must see it.”
“It went over okay at the memorial, with me and Draco's mum,” Harry considered, a tiny bit of hope trickling in.
“I can’t look,” he told them, “If I open my eyes they’ll all be there. The dead. And I thought you were one of them. I thought they’d killed you, too.”
“This isn’t a punishment,” Harry stated simply. “Just so we’re clear. You didn’t do anything wrong.”
Through the wall, Draco heard the clamorous questioning begin as soon as Harry came within view of the children:
“Yes. Down here, that’s certainly odd.” Harry quickened his pace, noticing a curl of smoke appearing from one of the corridors ahead.
Hiram shook his head, “Sorry, Harry. I just assumed he had to use the toilet or something. Is everything alright?” Hiram’s eyes grew impossibly larger.
“Remy, then,” Jamie muttered and Harry felt his guts lurch because he wasn’t sure the boy was wrong.
The mortification of it all brought him out of his reverie. It was an unforgivable misstep. The thrum of adrenaline had made him bold and arrogant. What had he expected would happen? That Potter, clearly exhausted and freshly heart-broken—and so far as Draco knew, not at all interested in men—would reciprocate the attraction? That he would pin him against the study door and finish what he had started moments earlier? It was pure delusion, and now Draco was to face James, who looked more and more like his father with every passing breath, in the autumn? Merlin, would Draco be suffering daily for his brash mistake until all the Potter spawn had graduated?
Harry stood, shakily, pressing close to Draco. “Fuck,” he said slowly, “I know it was bad, but, you're right, it did feel normal, didn't it? It was what I knew: my spider-infested cupboard, the endless chores and criticism, Vernon’s ready fist. I knew it was shit, but Merlin, I dreaded going back there, I was only a fucking kid. It really was as terrible as all that, wasn’t it?”
“I didn’t like who I was just now, with you, when we did all that," he mumbled. The words were wrong. Draco knew they were wrong as soon as they left his mouth. Merlin, why couldn’t he explain things properly?
“Because I like them,” Teddy insisted with a grin. “They’re interesting, and besides, after one more year of studies, I get to set to work on a spell of my own creation.”
Harry sighed, and stooped to dig out some comics from under the sofa. He curled his lip at the molding crusts of toast that came out along with them. “I can’t do anything right. Anything I say or do is met with barbs and malice. Only Malfoy has any effect on his manners. I feel utterly unequipped to deal with him—he’s never been like this, he used to be such a bright, good-natured kid.”
Harry had only just gotten Remy down when Lily snuck out of bed, padding into the drawing room with a pout.
Draco curled a dispassionate lip. “I didn’t realise aurors were taken to indulging in gossip pages. How very pedestrian.”
“Nature of the sport, mate, no one’s going to hold grudges. Teams can’t be worried about hurting people’s feelings or the league would be made up of seniors! Look,” Ron shuffled back through
“The cwalus, or Lavender or whatever you want to call her. I mean, it was just temporary, so don’t get your hopes up.”
“But I wasn’t going to burn to death,” Clark pointed out. “I knew I wasn’t, I just…” he shuddered. Harry pulled him close and kissed his head, like he always did.
Thanks so much to everyone who read and commented on the last chapter! I appreciate you so very very much ♥♥♥.
Draco dealt with enough children to have splinting spells at the ready, and without thinking, he hurried to his feet and slid his wand from his sleeve, stepping towards the redheaded child whose face was blanched and streaked with tears. He pointed his wand at the girl, his other arm securing Remy to his shoulder. Before the spell left Draco’s lips, Weasley rushed forward toward his daughter, shouting at Draco to get the hell away. Harry and Hermione appeared in the doorway just as one of Ron’s broad, solid shoulders accidentally clipped Draco’s as he bolted towards Rose.
That, apparently, was not on. He’d not heard the footsteps, but he looked up from where he was slouched on a sofa to see Draco standing over him, hands on his hips and glowering. Behind him were the flushed and uncomfortable faces of Ernie MacMillan and Michael Corner. They’d obviously had to rush to keep up with the furious Draco and weren’t keen to now be witnessing a domestic.
Potter had taken off his glasses and was slumped against the headboard, his cheek pressed to his daughter’s hair and his eyes closed. Lily was prattling on about the mysterious cairngorm brooch Godiva had unearthed back in book three. Draco was nodding and making appreciative noises, but his gaze kept drifting back to Potter. The stern talk that must have elapsed between James and Potter during dinner had clearly exhausted the man. James had, however, been somewhat less surly for the remainder of the meal, even apologising to Albus, so something beneficial must have transpired between Potter and his eldest. Then again, teenagers were predictable only in the lability of their moods, so who could say, really.
“Let’s not talk here,” Harry said, “Let’s go somewhere with less places to hide.” He rose and started putting Malfoy’s books into his bookbag, while Draco sat despondent, watching him, “She’s gone,” Harry promised, wishing to say something that could ease those bunched muscles in Draco's neck, “You did exactly the right thing, you’re safe. You protected yourself, okay?”
“Sitthi!” He hollered as he approached the excited gaggle, “Where’d that even come from! I’ve never seen a capture with so little fanfare, scratch that, I didn’t see it at all, talk about subtle, that will serve you well, truly incredible!”
“That’s about the size of it,” Januarius declared. “Hit Bludgers and meddle: the Fortitude Jordan way.”
“Not likely," he confessed, then, feeling brave, "Might go to mine, for a bit, though, if you want to come along.”
Harry slapped him, smart and sure across his face and much harder than usual. “No,” he said, voice flinty. Draco gasped, raising himself back to vertical, his hand flying to his face, eyes wide.
For a moment, Harry felt as though the floor had been yanked out from under him, and he was in free fall. With a stifled gasp, his heart sputtered back into rhythm. He knew Draco was attracted to him, knew Draco fancied him, in that supercilious way of his, but he was rarely affectionate, not with words and certainly not with endearments, and Merlin’s teeth, but Harry
The next thing he knew, Draco was passing him his coat and scarf to hang up on the nearby coat tree. Pompous little prat, Harry thought, exasperated, but he nevertheless slung Draco’s outerwear over a hook, along with his own. Now Malfoy was looking at the chair across from his mother’s. Merlin, he could not be serious. Draco only gave him an impatient, expectant blink because apparently, he was. Suppressing an irritated huff, Harry yanked Malfoy’s chair back a foot or so.
“Probably different for beaters than it is for seekers,” she surmised, “I almost wish Rivers was here. I could use some of his unflappable energy.”
Draco scrambled to his feet, wiping his face hastily. The protection spell morphed with his movement, wrapping him in a green cocoon. He was shaking with adrenaline and he didn’t have his wand. He scanned the furious faces in the candlelight, crossing his arms defensively over his scarred abdomen.
They came to a stop, readying themselves to apparate, when Draco took a hold of Harry's collar. He smoothed it, not meeting Harry's eyes. "I don't know exactly why you've chosen to stick by me," he muttered. "But I hope you know I appreciate it and I'm...glad you did."
“Yeah, but we could have busted you out of there earlier, or more often. It’s shit. The protection your aunt’s blood offered can’t have been worth all that. Hermione thinks so, too. She has an Arithmancy test this morning, so she’s in the library cramming, but she was pretty upset about it.”
“You know what I mean. Having a good cry and getting everything out, or whatever your equivalent is. A release and all that.”
“It was too tight,” he said finally. “Like I was being compressed by some sort of heavy machinery. I was trapped.”
Okay, who am I kidding, this story will contain smut because of who I am as a person.  I will do my best to keep any smut clearly demarcated and easy to avoid for anyone who prefers to skip those bits!
Harry’s chest tightened reflexively, as if his blood had thickened with dread, his heart straining weakly to pump against sludge. He checked his watch and gasped painfully when he didn’t see Drao’s hand on ‘School’. The panic calmed slightly when he didn’t find it on ‘Mortal Peril’, either. Instead, it was settled on ‘Home.' But whether that home was Malfoy Manor or Grimmauld Place, Harry wasn’t sure. He checked the time and swore. He’d almost missed breakfast. He threw on some clothes and was deciding whether he should get to class or go and persuade McGonagall to let him use the Floo, when Ron and Hermione burst in.
“Oh, you have a million, only I’ll start tearing up again if I start thinking about how clever and talented and brilliant and darling you are—”
Ron didn’t seem to hear the dangerous note in his voice, “Can you summon a cwalus like you can an object? Just stand at the foot of the stairs and see what happens, maybe? Or do you need, like, a seance? A ritual? Either way, if you could just implant some happy thoughts then presto, problem solved. What do you think, Harry?”
The preposterous, infuriatingly useless bird made no movement towards her cage. If anything, she bunched herself up and waddled backwards.
“I think you should come,” Harry considered, “I’m hitting forgiveness pretty hard in my speech...Hermione’s speech, really, but I have to give it. That’s the flavour of the thing, though. Forgiveness, forging forward, burying old grudges and celebrating new friendships.”
“You’re not bad!” Harry responded reflexively, “If you really wanted it, who knows? We could train together!”
“Yeah,” Harry shrugged. “Won’t last. But got the bills paid and sorted through at least half my correspondence.”
“Not easy for us to be close to people as kids only for them to be taken off to school at eleven,” Tanya continued, “my step-sisters are twins and I was right jealous, and also lonely. Suddenly my two best mates were gone and I had to tell everyone at school that my parents had decided to send them to boarding school and not me!”
Malfoy stared at him, long and discerning. Then, giving Harry a hard look, he questioned, “What’s in it for me?”
“I’m sorry!” Ron sighed, scrubbing a palm over his reddening face. “I’d had a beer too many and what I said was fucking inexcusable. You must know I didn’t mean it, it was hot air, Wizard’s honour. All I wanted was to piss you off, make you back down. I’d never harm a kid, Malfoy, not ever. I’m all talk, ask Harry.”
“I mean I'll make unbreakable vow,” Harry clarified, “to take care of him until his mother is able. That no harm will come to him under my care.”
Seamus was there with a very reluctant, red-raced Ron. Seamus had an innocent fist pushed up under his chin and was giving Harry a grin as wide as the sea.
Harry tugged at his magic, jerking Malfoy’s arms behind his head and his body upwards, until he was balanced precariously on the balls of his feet, not quite able to find easy purchase.
Harry tried not to notice that Malfoy was in just the thermal and trunks again, tried not to notice how the stretch of the material clung to the lean muscles beneath. He reached for Malfoy’s leg, feeling the coarse blond hairs beneath his hands, the warmth of Malfoy’s skin.
He approached a clerk, a wizard who clocked his scar almost immediately. His eyes went wide and Harry repressed a sigh.
Harry sighed, "I'd lose him, because it would mean everything between us is a lie. I'd be fucking devastated and he'd be laughing."
The sandy-haired boy only laughed, “Sorry, Potter,” he said, not sounding sorry at all, “couldn’t help myself.”
“She’s in my bloody head, Lavender, she’s in here!" Draco said through clenched teeth, yanking at his hair with one hand, as if trying to physically remove her. He squeezed his eyes shut and then sighed through pursed lips. "Alright. She's gone."
“Yes, but we didn’t know that, especially with it being the blue moon and all that. But you know that, we've all lectured you to death on it, today. We'd just rather you not take unnecessary risks.” Harry explained. "And yes, I know I am not exactly a role model when it comes to that, so I can hardly blame you."
Beside them, Harry saw Ron and Malfoy shake hands. Hermione, to Harry’s surprise—and from his expression, to Draco’s also—wrapped Malfoy in a warm hug.
and neither of those seem like they would work on crumbs,” he admitted. “I took on the dishes and the laundry and the yard, and Gin dealt with the rest.” It felt like an admission of guilt. He’d taken her for granted. He slumped, dropping the cloth back in the sink—he’d deal with the perpetual mess that was the kitchen later. “How is she?” he asked, voice low.
Harry obliged, a gentle back-handed pat to Malfoy’s other cheek. Then, without warning, he shoved two fingers into Malfoy’s mouth.
“Potter, what have I said about locking your damn door?” Draco demanded loudly, trying to force normalcy even though his heart was beating obnoxiously at the sight. He couldn’t get used to this notion of
Harry stared at her, uncertain as to how on earth he was to respond to that. “What do you mean?” He blurted out before he could stop himself.
“Potter,” Draco admonished, “I’m all for self-reflection and self-improvement, but all this contrition is getting preposterous. You’ve been left alone, completely out of the blue from what I gather, with a young infant and three children who are confused and miserable, and nevertheless, you're trying to make a go of it. Albus and Lily are in good spirits, James is fourteen so I don’t know what else you could possibly expect—fourteen year olds are virtually incapable of
CWs: some sexual content (foreplay) prior to the first ***; violence (in a dream/memory), gore, nightmares, PTSD-like response, drug (potion) use and altered mental state, ableist language.
“Hm?” the mind healer said, perhaps surprised by Harry’s lack of a hello, or by the giant red bird that settled on the arm of the sofa.
“Don’t come any closer!” Scorpius demanded, his voice shrill and high in a way that set the hairs on Harry’s arm on end. Harry held up his palms and lowered himself onto Al’s bed, a good distance away from Scorpius. Merlin, he thought, had he forgotten to give the child his medicine? But no, he'd administered it, he was sure of it. This wasn’t illness, it was just a nightmare. Harry’s own kids had always been rather solid sleepers, but he knew Rosie had given Ron and Hermione hell with night terrors for a while.
“Arrows, they’re alright, Harry,” he kept saying, nodding emphatically “robust line of chasers, and their seeker, Winslow, well, been said he and the coach have been on the outs for years, and he’s a step away from quitting. Getting old, too, I think. You’ve a decent shot, mate, more than a decent shot. But play hard to get! Don’t accept their first offer, once other teams know they’re interested, hoo, boy-o, then things get interesting.” He started rattling off teams and stats and seekers and league gossip until Harry’s head was spinning.
“It’s one of these tracks, it has to be,” Harry said aloud, dropping his head to the side to nudge against his boyfriend’s. He surveyed the room, absurdly hoping that this new tilted perspective would give him a flash of insight.
He gripped Scor’s upper arm just as Scor held his, tipped their foreheads together and whispered: “I want that, too.”
Harry felt very dubious about poking around inside Professor McGonagall’s brain, but he felt even worse about leaving Clark to worry he was losing his mind when he could do something about it.
“Say, you’re rather chummy with one of the Potter boys, aren’t you?” Main asked, even though he most certainly knew that Scorpius was.
, he simply felt nothing but unease at the thought of his mother being nearby again. This was one thing he had never revealed to anyone, not to Father, not even to Al, who loved his own mother so much he couldn’t stand to think of her: Scorpius felt nothing but a crawling
“I told her you were teaching DADA and she said that she’d hope you didn’t get caught in the curse. She said that even though you killed Voldemort, still no teacher has held onto that spot for longer than a year. She said you could die.”
“You two tried to ditch your security detail! Luckily, Ron found you on that delightful map of yours, so we were able to track you down.”
She teared up a little. Hermione tended to do that more these days. Things still seemed to close to the surface, for all of them. She blinked them away, and squeezed his hands again. They continued walking.
“Are you going to stay?” Scorpius interrupted, his little face pinched with worry. “If your head hurts maybe you should, just in case.”
Harry nodded, “Killing Voldemort scattered the Death Eaters, but I have no way of knowing if it changed their minds. More likely, those who escaped, or hell, even those rotting in Azkaban, are simply resentful and plotting, waiting for an opportunity to rise again. And the only way to prevent it is by hoping enough people believe me, choose my beliefs over theirs. For me to reach the undecided before someone else can."
George nodded, “Agreed, I would avoid fucking things up, if I were you, Ronnie. Especially for someone with a mug like Harry’s.”
“It’s not terribly useful at Hogwarts, besides from telling the regular time, but it seemed a pity to get one only good for so many more months. This way, it should last you post-graduation.”
Afterwards, they settled, Harry on his back, Draco draped over him. His chin rested on his folded hands which in turn were stacked on Harry’s chest.
“It’s there,” Lavender shrugged, “but I can contain it sometimes. I can’t enjoy my life, but I can take a little comfort in the boy’s imagination. It’s a sort of distraction.”
“Right then, Hiram,” Madam Pomfrey said to a scrawny boy perched on a chair just inside the main infirmary room, “get back to your dorm and get some rest, that's the best thing for this.”
“I don’t suppose she’d be amenable to a conversation,” Ron supposed, shoving another obscure text across the library table in defeat.
“Mm,” Draco agreed, sleepily, “It was...unexpected. I don’t know if it was from you fucking me or the shit you said, and I wasn't actually sure it would happen. And then it just did.  Didn’t feel very differently, I don’t think. Really rather excellent, if I'm being honest.”
“Of course, sweetpea. I’ll just see Auntie Hermione and the kids off, how about, and then I’ll pop back to say goodnight properly.”
, so I should think I would get some say here. Firstly, Draco was not a participant in my torture, so please don’t cast aspersions. In fact, if I remember that night correctly, he lied to protect Harry’s identity. Secondly, he is a well-respected member of Hogwarts faculty, and, may I remind you, your daughter’s professor, so I would think you would extend something akin to decency.”
“It siphoned your blood as ink?” Draco pressed. “Carved the words into your skin? Is that what this is?” He pressed his thumb into the words etched into Harry’s hand.
“They kids are fine,” Harry consoled his mother-in-law. “They really are. Sad, of course, but they’re resilient and just as lively as ever.”
“Well, good luck, Harry,” Hermione yawned, finishing her tea and standing up to head up to bed, “Please do try not to lose your temper.”
“Where’s Pansy?” Harry asked, loving the way Malfoy’s hand sought out his almost immediately beneath the surface of the table.
” between bouts of coughing. Harry followed suit, using the counterspell to snuff out the fiendish creatures in his path.
The post today had left Draco more in need of tethering than usual. Even though he’d known it was coming...Draco didn’t like feeling unsettled.
There was a break in the conversation, and Jamie thought he ought to say goodnight, but he found he didn’t want to. Not only did he feel like rubbish for bickering with Al, but he also found he enjoyed Scorpius’ company. The boy was insightful and earnest, and Jamie had a responsibility to cheer him up, really.
“Let's get you under the covers, hm?” Harry instructed, doing so himself, and Malfoy obeyed. Harry cast an alarm spell for the early morning before tucking his wand and glasses away. He lay down on his back.
“Great idea,” Ron said, “let’s bring it to the other coaches, maybe pick team colours so we’re not always arguing over who’s charming their cloaks what colour right before the game. Could be a bit of fun.”
“Yeah,” Harry admitted. “I try not to mind it too much, usually. I know I ought to be flattered, and everyone is always so nice, they only have kind things to say, but more often than not, Remy needs changing or James is hungry and therefore even nastier than usual, or Al's itching to run after something that’s caught his eye, or Lily is tired and whinging, and I just don’t have time for niceties!”
Nearly every student in the school was at least a little afraid of Scorpius’ father. Professor Malfoy had a reputation for being strict and uncompromising. If he’d overheard Fife’s words, it would land the boy with a weeks’ worth of detention.
This is all smut, y'all. Note the increased rating and please skip if you think it is not for you! You won't miss any plot, promise.
Scorpius, it seemed, was the exception, because the half-stubborn, half-frustrated look on Albus’ face suggested that he cared very much.
They dressed and Harry unlocked the door and stepped out into the hallway. He nearly jumped out of his skin.
Draco sighed. Damn the woman and all her intuition too often hidden by her outrageous persona. “But it, Merlin, with Potter it is just
“You can’t tell Ron,” Harry cut in, his words still hushed. “I hate asking you to keep secrets, but please. I just need more time. It might be nothing.”
“There now,” Harry said gently. “See? You’re doing beautifully.” He trailed fingertips across Draco’s thigh, dangerously close to his cock, which perked up with the attention.
“Yeah,” James replied, then stepped forward as if to lead the way. Draco followed, unwilling to be intimidated by a bit of odd Muggle technology. They turned the corner and were face to face with two large metal monstrosities. One had an odd sort of round portal in the front and the other a square door with hinges. Both had a strip over the top covered with dials and buttons and writing.
“Oh, sweetheart, I’m so sorry,” Harry said, very earnestly, feeling guilty. He crouched down so they were eye level, reaching out to pet Draco’s hair, “I'm really sorry, babe, I should have asked. What do you want to do? Should we stop?”
“Excellent, thank you. Alright, the rest of you, listen up! At the sound of the whistle, the Slytherins have one minute to find themselves defensive positions. At the second whistle, we begin! The third whistle means we’re stopping, and I want you all to return to here on the pitch immediately, is that understood?”
“Just because she’s a rubbish person doesn’t mean she’s rubbish at quidditch, unfortunately,” Dean pointed out from Seamus’ other side. “The Puffs beat both our teams, if you’ll remember.”
“Yes,” Draco conceded. “And brilliant as he is, and curious as he is, well, perhaps giving him ideas on how to sever his soul and live forever might not be the most responsible tidbit to put before him at this stage, hm?”
Draco, Harry had to concede, had done a good job. Ron looked quite smart in a navy jumper over an understated dress shirt and grey trousers the following evening. Harry was starting to wonder if it was less the clothing and more the fit that made an outfit. He was more than happy to just let Draco keep making decisions on that front, however. He didn’t think he was interested enough to learn all the nuances.
are you studying languages? All that Latin, seems awfully dull,” Jamie said over dinner that evening. He was eying Teddy with good-natured disdain, having already ribbed him about what he called Teddy's man bun. Harry was thankful that at least the boy’s ire didn’t seem to extend beyond Harry himself.
“I try not to limit myself,” Lily informed him, her chin held proudly aloft. “Granny says I can be anything I want to be.”
“Sit down, Potter,” that was Draco, but Draco hadn’t been there that night. Was it that night? Harry’s memories overlapped sickeningly. “Now.” It was definitely Draco’s voice. Clipped and insistent with none of his usual drawl. Instead there was a certainty and a confidence to which Harry clung. Nothing to worry about, he tried to tell himself. Draco wasn't worried. He would take this in hand, he always did. Harry braved a shallow breath; it came easier now. A hand on his shoulder directed him backwards until he felt something solid behind the back of his knees. It was a bed, his brain supplied, and Harry let himself drop, leaning forward, head in hands, waiting for things to slow down, to consolidate into reality. Draco was before him, perched on one knee, a cool hand on Harry’s cheek.
Since the three of them couldn’t meet in either the Gryffindor nor the Ravenclaw common rooms, they had fashioned themselves a little nook off the corridor at the base of the Ravenclaw Tower. The Alcove, as they’d unofficially dubbed it, was not really a room so much as the dead-end of a corridor with a view of the lake and a window seat that Ri had frequented during his first lonely year at Hogwarts. Jamie had figured he and Fort had really earnt Ri’s trust when he had shown it to them last winter.
pells in two neat lines, facing off against each other. Now though, they were ready to attack and defend while on the move.
Scorpius looked down at his watch. Five more minutes remained before the switch. He couldn’t just not say anything, could he?
“You’re awfully generous,” Hermione said, shaking her head, “you’ll recall you weren’t raised by a loving family either, so I’m not sure that’s an excuse.”
Draco hummed happily into Harry’s skin, soaking the afterglow, knowing the mess in his pants would prevent him from enjoying it for long.
Draco shook his head at the bizarre exchange. He was well aware that things had changed since the Emancipation Agreement that Granger-Weasley had pushed through during her time sitting on the post-war Emergency Council, but Pansy and Floriandra's dichotomy still felt a bit surreal.
Harry and Draco were about to do the same when Harry caught sight of Clark Tiering leaning against the platform wall. He had the sole of one trainer pressed against the bricks, his trunk by his side. He was wearing a black zip-up jumper and no coat. He was trying for casual, but his face looked strained and anxious. Harry nudged Draco, whose expression grew serious.
“I'm sure I can think of something,” Harry said sweetly, trailing his fingers over Draco’s reddening cheek. “But first, I want you properly fed and scoured." Harry dropped a kiss on the other boy’s bristly chin. “Go put on some tea. I'm certain Kreacher will love nothing more than to heat you something up—you’ve usurped me twice over in his affections, I expect. I’ll run you a bath.”
Malfoy gasped and it gave Harry pause, grounding him after that strange wave of irrationality. He retreated, his hands suddenly gentle on the other man’s waist. He kissed Malfoy’s mouth again. “If something hurts too much, you’ll say so, yeah? I haven’t done this before, the last thing I want is to bollocks it up. You’ll tell me if I overdo it?”
Harry just nodded in return and then proceeded to almost bite his tongue in two, because at that moment, Malfoy had decided to wrap his hand, and lips, around Harry’s cock.
Malfoy popped the cock out of his mouth, and looked like he was about to say something when Harry cut him off with a, “You will finish what you started or so help me—”
“Oi, you lot!” Harry called, not wanting his children to suddenly remember an urgent errand like five or six witches and wizards had done since Harry had arrived in the little courtyard.
PPS. I would really like to rework the description for this story since it currenly only covers like the first few chapters. If anyone has suggestions for what should be included, I am very keen to hear ideas!
for good measure, watching the thin restraints weave themselves around the pale witch, before dissolving his disillusionment spell and pitching himself towards Draco and the Slytherins. As if on cue, Professor McGonagall, flanked by Professor Haberdash-Pewter and Professor Flitwick burst into the hall.
you have to write down what you’re hoping to forget first. Then you can prove it worked. And it helps if you also include any preceding or proceeding events that are linked to it, so you don’t have any clues.” Albus shoved one of the notebooks at him and dug out a quill and a vial of ink from his satchel. “Here.”
The posture was obviously not as simple this time, a little tremor running through Draco’s quads almost immediately.
Harry thought about it. Yes, he could see Draco. Draco was on the floor before him. Clark was burning. No, Clark was sitting on the bed, across the aisle, freckled face twisted with worry, chest rising and falling with natural breath.
“I know, sweetheart,” Harry crooned, squeezing his neck again before leaning in to kiss his face, “and the truth is, I like keeping you here, keeping you safe from everyone but me.”
He spotted the two Slytherin first years huddled together outside the brick shed, looking nervous. They were quite the pair: long, gangly-limbed Clark and puny, big-eyed Hiram. Clark looked uncomfortable in his piecemeal athletic gear, Harry suspected this was not his usual crowd. Not that Clark seemed to have a usual crowd.
wanted a cuddle, Harry knew this to be true. It was a game they played, maybe one they always would. Harry thought he quite liked that idea.
“Hm, would we call Potter an acquaintance?” Pansy challenged. “Feels more like a former acquaintance, I’d say.”
Curiously, Harry looked from side to side of the vast nothingness. Then he spotted Draco, leaning casually against a black wall, a smirk on his lips, wearing nothing but his black pants and thermal. Even though Harry was used to seeing him in this outfit, even used to seeing Draco in no outfit at all, these days, he still felt that thorough twang of want reverberate through him. Harry was about to step towards the projection of Draco when all at once the figure whirled around, and peel down those tight black pants, revealing his bony, pale arse wriggling about, mooning him. He heard a delighted cackle and then was promptly shoved out.
“So, ah, what are you researching?” Scorpius inquired, not sure how to progress without social niceties. It seemed an acceptable question, though, because an answer was forthcoming.
“Not as long as yours,” Harry responded. Draco’s now fell almost to his chin, with a neat side part and a voluminous, sleek sweep of hair which framed his face. Harry thought it looked quite smart, even though he was pretty sure Draco used something so it didn’t lie too flat. Draco had a lot of grooming tinctures and ointments that Harry didn't recognise, actually. He'd noticed them lining the sink in their shared bathroom. “And no, it’s fine, I...I don’t like feeling like I am advertising who I am.”
“Quite,” Draco agreed, imperiously, kissing him one final time, “Off you go, now. Remember, decimate the competition so you can keep me in the jewels and furs I deserve.”
Potter curled one hand around Draco’s face. Draco could tell the man was holding back a grin. Poorly. “Bit manipulative, babe,” Potter pointed out, his nose scrunching adorably. And then he fucking kissed Draco full on the mouth. “Seems rather karmic to me, though,” Potter reflected, pulling back with a mischievous quirking of his brows, “that now you just can’t get enough.”
“For running,” Draco whispered. Harry slapped the back of his thigh this time, and Draco yelped miserably.
“Yes, but that is only because you have the social skills of a solitary swamp dweller.” Draco had informed him, “You need to
Apparently Malfoy agreed because he simply huffed, and said “It’s fine, Potter. I’ll tell you if it isn’t.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at the diminutive, feigning peevishness. “Enough kissing,” he groused sourly. “I want to fuck.”
Draco was still on his knees, his hands extended. Harry felt deep revulsion as he discerned the damage done. It was as though every bone from Draco's fingers to his shoulders had been snapped. Each digit was crimped like a crinkle-cut chips, his arms were bent in awful, disturbing angles. They looked more like gnarled branches of a tree than anything human. He was shaking.
. He couldn’t tell Al or Jamie, clearly. It was very obvious that the relationship was clandestine and he simply couldn’t imagine Jamie taking it well. Scorpius liked Jamie, he really did, but Jamie tended to think an awful lot of things were undertaken solely to aggravate him. To the eldest Potter boy, many things wholly unrelated to him were personal injustices. No, he wouldn’t like this development at all. Anything Harry did seemed to anger him, and Scorpius flinched at the imagined vitriol Jamie would spew if he found out his father was keeping such a large secret.
“Thank you,” he said. “I probably didn’t deserve that.” Draco was already showered and dressed, looking just as neat and crisp as ever.
Potter reached for Draco’s now empty plate and stacked it atop his own. Their cutlery collected in one hand, Potter walked to the kitchen. Another missed opportunity for magic. Draco tossed his head and raised his glass to his lips. Maybe that was why Potter’s magic was always spilling over, he thought dryly, it wasn’t getting proper use. Draco finished the last of his wine and followed Potter into the other room.
. The first one’s for me, when I want to forget things, or Scor, if someone was trying to get him to recall past prophecies, and the second one is if you want to rush over what’s coming.”
“I’ve not heard from Ginny in three full months, mate, you know that,” Harry said softly. “She cut me out and, what’s worse, she left the kids, without giving them any explanation. I have had to promise them time and time again that nothing they did caused her to leave, even though I’ve no idea if that’s the truth. No matter what it is she is going through, I’ll not forgive her for making them think that. I can’t. Do you know what it’s like to have to reassure your children that they are worth loving?”
“That I am,” Harry agreed. “You think it’s all about being strong. You want to show me just how tough you can be, how much you can withstand. And it gets you off, usually, and that’s great, and Merlin knows I’m happy to engage in all that with you. But for hell’s sake, love, you think I don’t already know you’re strong? That you can take a great deal more than anyone should ever have to? Of course I know all that. I don’t need your strength, babe, but I’d like to see your weakness. To let me know you trust me to take care of you every bit as well as you took care of me these last couple of months, when I know you’d not let another soul on earth lift a finger in your name. Hell, Draco, that would be a bloody gift.”
“Why don’t you tell me what exactly you were hoping for?” Harry offered beneficently. “Ask nicely. I’m sure we can find some common ground.”
“I’m sure you would,” Ms. Provincel said kindly, smoothing some frizzy hair down distractedly, “but promises are just promises.”
Without speaking, Malfoy strode forward, letting several bags of goods fall to the floor, and scooped up the sleeping child. He made for the mantle, his hand scrambling awkwardly into the empty bag of powder.
hit his chest. Harry laughed good-naturedly as his wand flew out of his hand. Despite giggling madly from the tickling hex, Ron leaped forward, keeper’s reflexes well intact, to nab Harry’s wand before it clattered to the floor.
“Ha!” Ilka gave a wink, “Nice try, Mr. Malfoy. That is all strictly confidential, as you read in the contract.”
Without anything that could be described as grace, they shuffled upwards until they found the pillows at the head of the bed. Harry slung an arm around Draco’s waist and curled into him. Draco wriggled closer, seeking Harry’s heat. Harry wondered if he ought to say something more, but instead with his lips pressed to Draco’s shoulder, he drifted off.
“Enormously,” Ri responded, a prim smile forming on his delicate features. Instead of getting to it, however, Ri took a long moment to position himself on the non-shredded end of the chesterfield, tucking his legs beneath him. Fort followed suit, kicking off her trainers and sprawling out with her back against the tattered end. She wriggled her toes under Ri’s thigh, which earnt her another glare that she easily ignored. Jamie only rolled his eyes. The kneazle in the sculpture flicked its tail impatiently.
Jamie leant back, arching into a stretch, and scratching casually at his stomach. The oldest Potter boy always seemed so comfortable in his body. He’d clearly never been betrayed by it the way Scorpius had been by his, what with it suddenly spouting all those damned prophecies.
“One absurdly over-difficult spell at a time,” Draco insisted, stepping towards the lanky child and apprising him. “Master Occlumency, and we will consider teaching you disillusionment. Now, how are you Tiering, and be honest.”
Harry bit the inside of his cheek, trying not to grin. It was a relief knowing that Hermione would just be happy for him, no jealousy or envy or muddled emotions. “Er, they’ve invited me to their trial day in December.”
Draco shrugged and leaned in, kissing Harry’s neck, “It’s almost a relief knowing you regret something,” he said quietly, “because I regret nearly everything and it...it feels like a lot sometimes.”
George left the evening of Boxing Day. Everyone told Harry that he needed to get back to the shop to give his assistants some relief. Harry knew they were just being kind. He offered to be the one to leave several times. He was almost willing to spend the remainder of the holiday alone at Grimmauld Place if it meant a reprieve from the endless tension, but Mrs. Weasley wouldn’t hear of it. He hid in the living room with Constance while everyone said their goodbyes. He held out some fancy owl treats that Draco’s eagle owl had delivered that morning with a note:
He filled the stopper and slid it beneath Scorpius’ tongue. The boy didn’t even stir. Draco wondered anxiously if he should end the sleep spell, but he didn’t want to risk it, not yet.
“Precocious brat,” Harry laughed, “you’re right, of course. I am sorry your classmates are still so insecure they feel the need to shine their own egos at every turn, there is that better?”
“Poor kid,” Harry sighed, leaning back against the desk at the front of the semicircular classroom, “He’s doing so well though, he kept me distracted for a good few minutes.”
“So what? Would I get loads of visitors and attention if I misbehaved, instead of minding my own business?” Harry doubted that Myrtle had even once minded her own business.
prone to getting ahead of yourself. Planning our retirement already? I prefer to stay on this side of forty as long as possible, thank you very much. I can’t bear to think of all that my beauty regimen will entail at
The eighth years were in DADA, Malfoy having just stepped out to use the loo, when a mighty rumble reverberated throughout the narrow classroom.
The corner of Malfoy’s mouth twitched upward, to Harry’s immense relief. “Potter, calm down before you wee on the rug like some sort of neurotic terrier.”
Draco huffed to show he was not interested in hearing more of Potter’s opinion on his particular flaws, but Harry ignored him, instead lazily thrusting his thumb in and out of Draco’s compliant mouth.
Ginny, who was acting as referee, whistled for the captains to shake. Harry watched as Fitz Hops, that massive boulder of a boy on a twig of a broom, darted to the centre to meet with a stout short-haired witch.
“I know you will. And you two will be more careful, I hope. Neither Jamie nor Ron will take kindly to secrets being kept from them. So if things between you are progressing, you ought to make a plan for breaking the news, before someone cottons on and ends up with hurt feelings.”
“S’fine,” Harry was too distracted by the girl’s words to care much about Malfoy’s understandable reaction to her. Of course, he should have seen at once that the destruction had been targeting Malfoy. That part of the tower had only recently been rebuilt—in part by the Browns, his subconscious supplied—it had no reason to collapse unless someone wanted it to.
“It’s not like I want you to go, but I wouldn’t hate knowing you’re somewhere safer,” he said, quietly.
Merlin, even when he was a sleep-deprived mess, Potter looked delectable all surprised and pleased like that, like every act of affection on Draco’s part was something to be savoured.
For a moment that felt like eternity but was really just seconds, Harry felt an unnerving terror. It would be so easy for Malfoy to tear down this fledgling dynamic with a sneer or a laugh, by making Harry and his play-acting ridiculous. Because that was what this was, Harry knew, simply a pretense, borrowing some of Malfoy’s self-assuredness for a time, and trying it on. Harry urged himself not to feel foolish; if Draco hadn’t wanted it, he wouldn’t have asked.
She handed Harry a small lancet. He pricked his finger and let a drop of blood fall to the page. A bright chime sounded after a moment.
Al closed his lips and swallowed. “Sorry, Professor,” Al said automatically, wiping his mouth with his forearm.
“So, the worst that will happen is she’ll pop in for a visit and he’ll kick her out and come find us.”
Draco let their foreheads fall together. “I suppose it’s better this way. You’re an irritatingly hard man to ignore. I rather doubt I could pull it off, even if I tried.”
Draco laughed heartily, it was a low, warm sound that Harry didn’t get to hear often. “Merlin, I really was my own greatest stumbling block. All that effort to impress you, wasted.”
“Doesn’t seem to matter how many times you and Granger explain it, the muggle conception of ghosts makes no bloody sense.”
“I’m not sure that’s it,” Harry mused, “I never had any emotional control around Snape, and he never got mired in my thoughts like that.”
“Yeah, alright,” Harry agreed uncertainly. “But if it gets to be like, information overload, promise you’ll stop me?”
“I can’t believe you won’t tell us about the trial,” Ginny whinged for the third time in as many evenings. She and Harry were seated with Charlie, George, and Ron at the dining room table.
“We’ll take this somewhere else,” Draco decided. He turned smartly on his heels, leading Harry out of the dark-walled drawing room down a wide corridor and into a space much more bright and cavernous. He shut the large doors firmly behind them. It was a library, Harry saw at once, with vast walls of books, and summer sunlight casting grids of shadows on the floor as it cascaded through large arched windows onto honey-coloured hardwood floors.
“Why not?” Lily asked. Harry could tell it was going to be a longer conversation than he’d been hoping for. “Because you’re pure of heart?”
“Does anyone know her?” Hermione asked, and everyone shook their heads, “she doesn’t look very old.” Ron positioned the girl on her side, one arm cradling her head.
“You’re busy,” Al pointed out. “I know babies are a lot of work. And you’re tired and I think you’re sad, too, I can tell. Oh, but hey! Maybe I can teach you the spell and—”
“Neville’s sticking around here to apprentice with Professor Sprout. No idea what Daphne’s doing because she’s not exactly speaking to me. Luna’s off to the Amazon to document the mating cycle of whigglewhiffs, which I’m not convinced exist, but she's chuffed to bits about it. I think the rest of us are just trying to sort ourselves out. How about you lot?”
“I shouldn’t have let her drink. She’d only just got into a pattern with Jared at nursery and her back at work; this could ruin everything.”
“Right, if you lot want new inventions, don’t go nicking things from shop!” He bellowed blindly to the supposed offenders, but his face split into a grin when he stopped long enough to take in the Potter boys. “Great Scott!” Weasley declared in mock surprise, clutching his chest. “My long lost nephews! I was beginning to forget what you looked like. I suppose you’re preferable to filthy little filchers, though only just.” He snatched the glasses off his face and yanked the boys in for a bear hug. “I was beginning to think you were adrift in the fabric of time and space.”
Malfoy groaned into the kiss, and Harry re-positioned himself so that both of Malfoy’s wrists were caught in one steely-gripped hand. He indulged himself with a handful of Malfoy’s hair, clasping tight against the scalp, securing him in place so he could take the kiss deeper.
Harry felt rejuvenated after a Sunday morning working in the pumpkin patch with Ron and Hermione. It had been nice to spend some time with Hagrid and even to see big, drooling Fang again. After a shower to get the garden soil off him, he was heading to the quidditch supply shed to meet with his new team for their first practice. He was feeling a bit nervous but mostly excited. It had been too long since he had been flying and he found he missed it.
Harry wasn’t listening, not really. He felt naked without his map, helpless in a way he hadn’t in a long time, as though someone had snapped his wand or sucked dry his magic. It made him itch and shudder. “What the fuck are we going to do?” He muttered.
“Yeah, alright—oh wait, no, I can’t! I’m assisting Professor Malfoy with Potions prep tonight, as his new assistant and all.”
“Alright,” Harry reflected, still at a loss. “And was there, I don’t know, something specific you were curious about? A, er, particular event or what have you?”
“There,” Harry cooed. “That’s lovely. Such a dutiful, pretty little thing when you get out of your own head.”
“Hm?” Draco responded, as if forgetting Harry was even present for these preparations, “Oh. Not really, no. I’m not about to let you embarrass yourself in front of the myriad grieving.”
“Merlin, Ron,” Harry huffed with exasperation. He could understand Ron being hurt, but this behaviour was verging on childish. “When were we last Aurors together, truly? Not since Jamie was born and I switched departments. And now I’m down Ginny’s income,” then, under his breath he added, “as well as the Galleons she helped herself to from our joint account.”
Draco transfigured one of the empty grocery bags to look like his collection kit so Daphne wouldn’t ask questions.
Draco gave a stiff nod and Harry cast a Disillusionment Charm on the three of them, just to escape any questions from wandering prefects or Heads of Houses. Draco went to scoop up his son, but Harry stopped him with a light touch to his shoulder. “You’re exhausted. Let me.”
Harry and Father remained just like that as the teasing air fell away, and both their expressions became once again solemn—a temporary distraction replaced by the remembrance of reality.
Harry found himself feeling strangely self-conscious. He didn’t have warm feelings towards Number 12, Grimmauld Place. It had never really felt like a home. As such, he’d never invested much time or money into its appearance. Much of the furniture, while once rather fine, was now just old. Malfoy would undoubtedly have
“I’ll come back,” Jamie agreed, rising and heading towards the kitchen. “Don’t want everyone thinking I’m a coward.”
“Oi, fuck off,” Ron replied, but there was only relief in his voice, and no heat. “Now, I bet you have more things to do than standing around bullshitting with me all day. What’ve we got?”
“I thought about it,” Draco allowed. “For Scorpius’ sake, I almost convinced myself  to go, but in the end it was for his sake I stayed. I wanted him to know you can make a life from ashes, that past mistakes didn’t dictate one’s future, and that redemption is achievable—or at least I thought it was. Weasley tried his best to impress on me that that was not the case.”
Draco didn’t answer. He didn’t want Harry to do anything simply because he felt obliged to. “Nevermind. I’ll be fine. You needn’t smother me so.”
are very different things, as you’re well aware, but we’re not having this conversation right now. Albus, say your goodbyes to Scorpius, I’m sure he and Professor Malfoy have plenty to do at the Manor and have got to be going. James, sharing was something you’ve long known how to do, so I suspect this is a longer conversation, and one that you and I can have later, when you’ve settled down. To your room, please, and finish your packing. I’m disappointed in the both of you, putting Scoripus in an uncomfortable position like this, and when your aunt and uncle were here to look after you, no less.”
“I don’t need any bloody tea!” Clark snarls, so viciously that both Harry and Draco are taken aback, momentarily frozen in place in the beautiful drawing room that feels far, far too posh for the likes of him.
The twins’ conversation turned at once to a familiar, exuberant repartee about just who would be kicking whose arse.
“Fuck, Potter,” Draco gasped, lips parted, breaths coming quick. Harry took that rounded lower lip between his, and gave it an experimental nip. Malfoy whined and fuck if it wasn’t an aphrodisiac, that pained, helpless, needy little noise.
“That’s not what she thinks, Harry,” Teddy said firmly. “That’s not what any of us think. That’s your damned pride talking and you know it. You’re her family; what Ginny’s done hasn’t changed that. And she’s worried about you, and the kids. You know since Arthur passed all she wants to do is spoil her grandchildren. Hell, she’s knitted me more socks than I know what to do with. I kept all my flatmates in socks this past year!  And I’m not even her family, not really.”
“Bubble heads on and up the great hall!” Harry ordered, and the students were quick to obey. “Awling,” he stopped her, with a hand on her shoulder, “Which one is Clark’s dormitory?”
Draco felt a pang of sympathy for the serious boy and his endless capacity for caring and for worrying. “And there are rumours of a new pox coming out of Madagascar and illegal unicorn poaching in America," Draco told him gently, "and I’m not doing anything about those, either. It’s not plausible for one person to take on every cause.”
“You mean you’ve let Hermione arrange all this on your behalf and you never took the time to know the mechanism?” Ginny demanded, horrified. Harry sort of shrugged.
Harry waited until the noises in the dorm that night had settled before creeping across the creaking boards and sliding open the canopy curtains of Malfoy’s bed just wide enough to crawl in. Another eighth year perk, a bit of privacy at last. As an unintended (although likely expected) consequence, there was definitely not as much separation of the sexes—he could have sworn he saw Ginny scampering out the door some mornings. Harry was also dubious that Ron ever actually spent the night in his own bed, despite the big show of waking up there that he routinely displayed.
“Also dead is the Black name," Draco interrupted, tone one of bored irritation, "and the Black bloodline has narrowed to a mere trickle. Only myself and your disowned great grandson remain to propagate it. Remind me again of your great legacy, Aunt? The poisonous ideals of the House of Black have left you all dead and buried.”
Potter rubbed the back of his neck in that hapless way of his. “Er, we were all out just doing the back-to-school run, you know how it is. Albus and Scorpius are mates now, as I’ve no doubt Rose has told you. I was just taking Remy and Lily home for a rest, actually.”
Clark dared another glance at them before returning to examining his tea. “Are you terribly cross with me?” he blurted out. “I promised myself after last time I’d be more careful, I really did, but I couldn’t just leave her in that fucking tie clip, it felt too cruel.”
Their knees knocked companionably once more beneath the table, and Harry watched Draco duck his head and smile into his tea.
it, Harry? Spit it out, I'm far too comfortable to go running off presently, you can count on that."
Seamus slid into the chair vacated by Ron, “I guess we only truly got together after the war. I think we both sort of realised how stupid we’d been. I mean, we’d been fooling around for ages but both pretending it was just 'boys being boys' bullshite. Then being without him last year, knowing he could end up dead any fecking day and I’d never said a word? Felt bad, mate.”
“I was raised by muggles, too,” he said, kindly, “it was definitely an adjustment coming to Hogwarts, feeling like you’ve missed the first few series of a TV show that everyone else has been watching from the start.”
There was a hollow certainty in the words that made Harry pause. He half wanted to reach out, squeeze Malfoy’s shoulder, offer some camaraderie or something, but he doubted that would be well received. So instead he just chewed the inside of his cheek as they shuffled along.
“Oh!” She gasped, her gaze flicking up to his scar and surprise evident on her round, pleasant face. “Mr. Potter!”
He wrapped his cloak around him so as to disguise his highly inappropriate library hard-on, and yanked Malfoy to his feet, “Now, Draco.”
It had only taken a bashful expression and Harry muttering he’d realised he “hadn’t anything to wear tomorrow,” for McGonagall to sign off on Harry’s weekend pass—not that there was much left of the weekend.
“Grandad had a toaster in his collection of Muggle inventions,” Lily continued. “And Godiva Greatstrides has one, too. Only her brothers enchanted the toaster to deconstruct the toast into just like flour and eggs and yeast instead.” Lily emitted a long-suffering sigh as she finished off her braids. “I really relate to Godiva,” she announced. “Brothers are a major pain. Well, Jamie’s alright because he plays Quidditch with me sometimes. And Remy’s just a baby.” She seemed under the illusion that her complete lack of subtlety was both clever and cutting.
“Not at all, I was simply immersed in my writing. They have had breakfast and I did mention packing up, but if that actually happened, who's to say. Boys!” He called out.
“Going public would...complicate things,” Harry explained, gently, “and we’d rather avoid that for now.”
Harry grinned, trying not to laugh, “You too, mate.” Draco narrowed his eyes. Jones’ team was gathering nearby, their cloaks a blinding chartreuse with patches reading “Pygmy Puffs” on each of their uniforms.
“You just have to focus on the memory or the current moment really hard, but at the same time, you have to imagine it being pruned away like a bit of dead tree, yeah?” Scorpius illustrated. Albus’ enthusiasm was obviously catching, because Scorpius was equally eager, as though he were telling Draco about his favourite novel or a classmate’s misbehaviour which would be detailed over tea in a scandalised whisper.
Harry only nodded, mimicking the action twice more. “Straight forward enough,” he said, gently releasing Malfoy’s legs, “staying here tonight, Malfoy, or—”
He still had the audacity to look annoyed, “Of course it would be you,” he sighed, “Sniffing out the opportunity for another rescue, Potter? Eager to scrape away the last of my dignity?”
“Hey,” Harry whispered as he climbed onto Malfoy's bed that evening. He felt exponentially more awkward than he had the night before, now that he was in the after kissing Draco Malfoy times. He cast a quick
Harry kissed her cheek, incredibly relieved at the warm reception. Perhaps he'd been expecting the opposite more than he'd realised.
“Fine,” he hissed, swallowing the last of his pumpkin juice and standing. He began to walk across the large room to the Slytherin table. Clark was easy enough to spot—weekends were mohawk days. The pink-haired boy was seated at the end of his row, no one was paying him any mind. Harry had to admit as he went, he did notice a few students start to track his movements. There were nudges and whispers and the farther he got from the eighth year table, the more prominent they became. By the time he stood before Clark, there was what could only be described as a hush descending around him.
he demanded. He was about one half-convincing sentence away from Apparating home, his exhaustion and early morning practice be damned.
Draco batted Harry’s hand away, took himself in hand, “I’m fucking close, Harry, please. Want to come with you, fuck—”
Harry got Remy changed and dressed and hunted through the house for the baby change bag, Merlin, where had he put it? Harry could barely remember the last time he’d been out of doors to do more than shout at Jamie not to fly so far off.
“Now,” the professor spoke, lowering herself gingerly into a chair opposite to him and viewing him from across the expanse of an empty desk, “the first thing you need to know about changing people, Mr. Potter, is that you cannot. A person must make the decision to change for themselves.”
“Right,” Harry said, shuffling awkwardly. It was such an obvious response; and realising that made Harry feel like even more of a daft git. Remy fussed some more. "Well, thanks."
“Lean forward,” Harry explained, “then reach both hands behind you.” Draco did as he was told, dropping his head toward the mattress and stretching out his hands. Harry grasped both Draco’s wrists, bringing them together, then yanking them upwards. He used his other hand to fetch the rope, and curled Draco’s fingers around it, forcing him to hold himself in place. Draco groaned miserably, realising it wouldn’t be long before he tired of this position.
“Bye chaps,” Clark said to the younger boys. “Bye Hiram. Thanks for having me, and for dinner, Mr. Fantyl. And thanks to Mrs. Fantyl, too, when she gets home. I—I had a really lovely time.”
“I don’t know,” he admitted. “I’m afraid I’m...in a bit over my head. Like you said: I spent my teenage years beholden to a terrorist, and much of my adult life attempting to regain my reputation. My relationship with Astoria was imperative to that; I had no intention of doing that image any damage. My...other needs were met via different channels, as you’re well aware. I thought it was enough for me. I never wanted anything more.”
“It’s very noble of you to want to help your friend,” Harry started, a warmth filling his chest. He'd been starting to wonder if he'd inadvertently been raising a psychopath, and was relieved to find that was not the case.
Charlie, Percy, Bill and Fleur left a few days after that. Percy shook Harry’s hand, but Bill and Charlie hugged him. Fleur for her part embraced him about six times, and peppered his face with affectionate kisses, “I’m ‘appy zat sad boy ‘as you, ‘Arry,” she said.
Main looked like he’d far rather prefer to stay and get to the heart of the matter, but knew better than to argue with Professor Malfoy in this dictatorial mood, so he only nodded and dragged a rubbernecking Mulligan out of the office, yanking the door shut behind them.
Draco stared at his tea. The delicate china was plain white, save the for the gilded edge. It felt breakable in his hands.
“Hullo, Harry,” Dean said, “We’ve all just organised a little escort for you and Malfoy, just for the next few days, until things settle down.”
“I don’t know!” Harry insisted. “It wasn’t something I was hiding, I was as surprised as you are. He just...came onto me and, well, okay, maybe I was shocked and a little horrified at the very beginning but then, well, Merlin, it was like something switched on and then I simply wanted him, didn’t I? Besides, it’s not like he’s ever been hard to look at.”
“It would be my pleasure,” Draco muttered bitterly. “He’s more than willing to sacrifice my arse for his own ends, I might as well do the same.”
“I know she will,” Ron growled, “you two have a remarkable way of forgiving and forgetting, but then again, you don’t have a brother in the ground.”
Jamie harrumphed but didn’t reply. He was glowering with exasperation and Harry felt guilty for dismissing his concerns so easily.
“Hm,” Draco affirmed. “An effective spell for former Death Eaters needing to get out to the shops without being assassinated on sight.”
Zerk raised a dismissive hand, “You never have to worry about hurting my feelings in here, Harry. I understand that trust-building is a process, and we’ve not known each other for long. So, the value of praise depends on the person delivering it. From what little you’ve told me, I gather your childhood was lacking in kindness.”
“Thanks,” Scorpius repeated, then as if noticing he was still holding Jamie’s hands, he blushed and let go. “Sorry.”
“Of course,” was all Draco said, then turned to Harry, “Have you seen anything of my Aunt Andromeda and Teddy over the break?”
Draco shifted to look at Scorpius, who was resting his pointed chin on his knuckles, his elbow propped up by Albus’ shoulder.
Had anyone else said that, it would have sounded boastful, Al reckoned, but Scorpius was never like that. He might not realise that most kids didn’t get to have expensive vacations, but he also never seemed to take them for granted.
“You’ve done more than enough already,” Clark replied, stiffly. He was pink-faced and on the edge of tears. “I’ll be fine, don’t worry about it.”
But Potter seemed pleased to see him and they somehow even traversed their mutual confessions of interest with only mild discomfort, at least on Draco's part, and that was certainly new territory for him. And then there was the question of Potter’s runaway magic. Draco had never felt anything like it and had been loath to let it end. It had been overwhelming in the best way, shuttering Draco’s thoughts until there was nothing but the sensation of Potter’s incursion. Draco wondered how he could get the man to do it again.
Harry shoved some notes into Clark’s pocket. “Cab fare,” he insisted, “for getting back to school. And so you can buy your brother a Christmas gift. And your mum—she’ll have lost work, might need help with groceries.”
were somewhat different things, and maybe she’d think Harry was betraying Ginny after all, or she’d be somehow repelled or annoyed, but instead the witch looked only thoughtful. Harry squeezed Draco’s shoulder once before reluctantly dropping his hand.
Harry ignored the critique, tugging on Malfoy’s vest until it came free of his trousers. When at last it did, Harry thrust both hands up the newly revealed opening, running eager fingers along the warm skin, and settling on Malfoy’s ribs. It wasn’t enough, though, and Harry yanked at the offending vest.
“I’m not your professor any longer,” Draco reminded him, but then didn’t quite know how to continue. He was not about to suggest Edward refer to him by his given name. He’d not minded the boy in school: he’d been well-liked, but a hard-worker, genuine, and interested in his studies.
“Really!” Rose was the first to react. She was a near replica of her mother, brains and all, except the bushy hair that framed her face was the colour of carrots. “Uncle Harry, that’s wonderful! Oh, but I hope Professor Stump is alright?”
She gave them a nervous smile. She was younger than Harry realised, maybe just thirty, but with deep circles under her eyes. She wore her light brown hair in a high ponytail, strands of it falling out of place around her neck and ears. A little boy appeared in the hallway and, when he saw Clark, he ran towards him.
“I can only imagine,” Draco said, kindly. “Did you want to see if she’s up for a visit? I know she wasn't ready for you to come stay this weekend, but we could meet for a meal, if you think she’d want to."
“Feed the baby, I expect,” Malfoy told him. “James and I have it well managed, Potter. Stay here and you’ll only be underfoot.”
It should, perhaps. Instead of answering, Draco went in for another kiss. Potter caved, leaning in, desire evident in the press of cock alongside Draco’s own. The hand in his hair tightened, and Draco relished the warning tingling across his scalp, promising pain.
She led them to a small set of stairs, mid-deck, and they followed her down. It was another Perkin’s tent situation, Harry realised at once. The floors were the same sleek ash as the deck above. The curved walls were a clean grey, an abstract mural covering one of them: unflinching black and white blocks arranged in crisp angles and astute lines. Instead of a desk, there was a high granite table with black leather half-backed bar stools, affixed to the wooden floors. A glass carafe filled with water, mint, and raspberries was perched there, with a little spout and lever at its bottom, to allow the water to drain out without bringing the leaves and berries with it. Ilka Veldt filled a glass for each of them, indicating for them to sit.
Memories of his childhood felt so far away. He didn’t like to think about that lonely boy who didn’t know things would get so much better, and also so much worse. That boy knew misery, but he didn't know grief. Not like Harry knew it now.
Thank you all SO much for your patience! I know this is a bit short but not sure when I can finish the next chunk so wanted to get it posted. Thanks for the comments and the delightful vest discussion, I adore you all ♥♥♥♥
A wave of well deserved chagrin washed over Jamie. He found he didn’t at all like upsetting Scorpius, who was usually so mild and sweet. “It’s not about you, Scor,” he explained ruefully. “That’s just how Al and I get. We don’t mean anything by it.” He gave Scorpius a gentle, companionable nudge. “Why’s it matter so much?”
Harry bit back a grin—it was an odd bit of fun, in a way. “Of course,” he replied, and filled Malfoy’s cup.
Harry half-lurched off the sofa where he’d sat just to take a moment, realising too late that Remy was in his arms. He fumbled the baby helplessly only to hear a levitation spell uttered, suspending the infant in mid air. Remy squealed and Harry scooped an arm under his back and head before collapsing back onto the sofa, running his free hand through his over-long, greasy hair. Only then he looked up to see a stranger in his drawing room.
“You lot really take things to an eleven,” he was saying as they walked towards the central tower where the new DADA class was taking place. Harry was thankful to see Ron and Hermione modulate their pace to Malfoy’s without comment. “First it was just ‘show up at our meeting’ and now it is ‘protect the saviour of the wizarding world in a duel.’ You don’t see how this could end disastrously? What if I do poorly, not that I will, but supposing I do? Weasley here lands too many good shots and I look like I’m not making a proper effort.”
” pointing his wand at the shimmering, bleeding mirage of Lavender. The spell took hold, sucking her feet first towards the clip like she was caught in a whirlpool.
“Sorry, I’ll keep a tighter hold on it next time, it won’t happen again–,” Harry hastened to promise, flushing as images of a kneeling Malfoy, bound and helpless, sprung to mind. Harry didn’t know what was wrong with him. He’d never gone in for all that business before,  but Malfoy made the possibilities feel so terrifyingly tangible.
The main course was served: garlic roasted chicken with veg and potatoes. It was delicious as ever, but Harry was having a difficult time eating anything. The tentative small talk had given way to uncomfortable silence, despite everyone’s best efforts.
Dad caught Al’s eye then, and smiled before cocking his head towards the stage, indicating Al ought to be polite and listen. Sighing, Al did so.

“It’s not,” Father retorted sharply, then sighed. “I’m sorry, dearest. It really isn’t your fault; I should have been more cognisant of the hour.”
“That’s not true!” Jamie argued fiercely. “He’s a nice kid. I like him, okay? For once in my life, I’m not trying to piss you off, alright? I’m not going to do anything to mess with him. Honestly, Al, you really think I’m that much of an arsehole?”
It was evening by the time they’d finished debriefing McGongall and the rest of the faculty. Lavender had been summoned and examined and questioned, corroborating the story. She explained how she’d found her mother working on the castle in the autumn, and how Mrs. Brown had executed many of the attacks until her banishment from school grounds. She talked about how lonely she’d been, how endlessly angry. She talked about Clark reeling her in and trapping her in his thoughts that first time, how’d she’d raged and he’d listened. Finally, Lavender spoke about how Harry’d helped her move on from that. She might not be at peace, exactly, as ghosts never truly were, but the violence within her had burned itself out.
