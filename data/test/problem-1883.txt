He pulled himself up, ignoring the heaviness of his head. As soon as he was off the bed, he felt instantly calmer. He could still remember the nightmares but they were no longer pining him down with their weight. No longer crawling under his skin. It was no wonder Malfoy wanted to swap beds.
Harry doesn’t have time for this. The potion currently dressing his arch-enemy was weeks in the making, and something he had worked fucking hard on. Something he had been brewing without anyone else’s help or guidance. If he’d known it was only going to be wasted on Malfoy, he wouldn’t have bothered.
He turns back to the train, watching the last trickles of students hurry in. “Well, I had to move on.”
“I’m with you on this okay, just keep a clear head, and let me do the talking if you can’t keep from raising your voice.”
Only once Malfoy lowers his arms and nods his permission does Hermione cast a transfiguration spell, reversing the direction of the buttons.
Harry leaned in closer, keeping his voice low. “Look, Malfoy, you don’t have to be cruel. But you can’t let them get away with things either. If you show weakness, even for a second, they all see it. The trick is to sound like you have control even as it’s slipping through your fingers. I know you’re good at what you do, and I bet you can be a great teacher. You just need to be strong.”
Harry lets the hand in Malfoy’s hair slip to cup his face, and Malfoy leans into it, tilting his head, drawing Harry deeper into the kiss.  And then everything changes.
“Alright,” Pansy said to Draco, recognising the dismissal. “No need to get tetchy.” She returned her attention to Potter. “Lovely to meet you, Harry. Be good to my Draco, won’t you?”
Draco wanted to scream Yes! Nothing had been more okay in his life than this moment. But, he settled for a snarky comment, although even then he couldn’t hide his eagerness to see Harry Potter naked. “Shut up, you gorgeous bastard and take your pants off.”
Harry’s jaw dropped open. This was ridiculous. Could Malfoy not hear how silly he sounded? This was Draco Malfoy. And he was Harry Potter. And it was the middle of a Quidditch match.
Before Harry can react, Ron takes hold of Draco’s cloak and yanks him close. “Oi, not so fast,” he says. “Harry just told you he loved you. Aren’t you going to say it back?”
“What do you mean, obviously?” Malfoy asked, straightening up. “It’s not obvious at all, Potter. If–“
Harry’s not about to refuse that. He’s always waited until after what he thought were dreams to get himself off, but here with Malfoy sounds like a much better option. He slides down his pajama pants and underwear under Malfoy’s gaze. And yeah, he’s already super fucking hard. I mean, it’s only natural in the circumstances. And it’s only naturally that he has to mentally calm himself the fuck down, lest he blow his load way too early and force severe humiliation upon himself.
His words are cut off when a hand curls around his shirt collar and slams him against the wall. Draco’s face is close, and screwed up in rage. And Harry has no idea where it’s coming from.  “Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Potter.”’
,” Harry interrupted, louder than he intended, feeling a blush rise to his face. Malfoy was sitting so close, Harry knew he had heard every word. Could there be anything more humiliating?
Harry knocks on the door gently. The humming stops and a short while later, Slughorn appears in the crack of the door. As soon as he sees Harry, the door is flung open wide.
“Thirty-four and counting.” Malfoy winked. “You know, Potter, if you were to take me out to dinner, I’m sure the outing might be scandalous enough to make the front page. We could add to both our collections.”
Surprise flashed in Draco’s eyes before he turned his head away from Harry, back to the memory playing out in front of them. Snape’s counter curses were starting to work, the wounds across Malfoy’s chest slowly closing up.
Malfoy is squirming in his seat, restlessly fidgeting, and Harry isn’t sure how, but he can tell Malfoy is aroused as well. Can tell the bead of sweat dripping down the back of Malfoy’s red neck is a sign of it. Can tell that Malfoy would certainly be open to a mid-class fucking. Except how can he know that? It must all be wishful thinking, a product of his own arousal.
Draco caught Harry’s eye – he was currently enveloped in Molly Weasley’s arms – and smiled. For the first time, Draco felt like perhaps he belonged.
Draco’s stomach clenched at the suggestion. It was humiliating what Harry was asking him to do, but at the same time he couldn’t deny that it was also incredibly arousing. He hesitated, hoping Harry might grow impatient and just close the distance between them. But of course, Draco was the impatient one. Harry not so much.
“I didn’t– it’s not spec– ” Harry tried to say, but it was too late. Malfoy had already levitated the cupcake into his hand.
Now, when he gets to the light, things become a little clearer. He’s not just in darkness anymore. He’s in a Hogwarts dorm. A Slytherin dorm he’s willing to bet from the dampness of the room, although that could just be what all dreams are like. He can’t remember any others right now. The beds are all empty in the dorm bar one, which is where the light is coming from – the source is a wand tip on a bedside counter, shining light onto the sleeping occupant of the bed.
And as much as he was looking forward to and simultaneously dreading that, he wasn’t quite ready to face it. So he ducked into the kitchens on the way down to the dungeons to delay the inevitable, not even considering - although he really should have - that he’d be running right into Potter.
Potter tossed the phone back to Draco and stood up with his coffee. “Call me when you work it out,” he said.
Draco gaped back at Potter for a moment. He was in two minds - one was impressed by Potter’s bravado, the other furious that Potter could be so smug - like he was really
Pansy relaxes her face and looks at Draco seriously. “I’ll keep it up for as long as I need to. As long as you need me.”
Before Draco could think of a witty response, Potter stepped in once more. “I rather thought I was the lucky one in this instance,” he replied but he didn’t look at Blaise at all when he said it. Only Draco.
Draco shook off his annoyance at the easy win. Even an easy win had to be better than losing. And of course, now he had bragging rights. “Remember the date, Potter. November third. The day I beat you.”
“Then arrest me, Granger. But first, perhaps Harry should explain to Andromeda why I will no longer be able to provide her a potion for Teddy, his godson.”
“Er. No reason. Just something that came to my head,” Hermione lies, very obviously. Even if Harry didn’t know Hermione was lying, he would have picked it. There’s no way Slughorn is going to believe it.
“Evening, Malfoy,” he says pleasantly, taking a seat without even glancing at Draco across the table.
He caught movement in the glass and quickly dropped his hair, turning his face down to his table, but straining his eyes up to watch - it was Potter, coffee in hand, heading towards the entrance, eyes fixed ahead, not even acknowledging Draco in the slightest.
And Draco put everything that he could into the kiss. Passion, of course, but tenderness too in the slow gentleness of his movements as he held onto Harry’s lips between his. It was his way of saying “I love you” without actually having to say the words. And as oblivious as Harry he could be, Draco was quite certain he would be able to hear it quite plainly in the caress of Draco’s lips.
Malfoy stood up and strode to the centre of the circle. He whispered something in Parkinson’s ear. She laughed and brushed him away.
Potter laughed into Draco’s ear - it was uncomfortably loud but Draco didn’t mind. Potter hooked his hands into Draco’s underwear but he didn’t pull them down straight away, just held his hands there, his intention obvious, until Draco couldn’t take it anymore.
,” Malfoy says, with so much venom, Harry takes an unconscious step backwards, “once you’re on the werewolf register, you’re forever treated as a secondary citizen. It’s hard enough to get into a school without Dumbledore’s sway anymore, let alone ever have a job in the wizarding world. What parent would want that for their child?”
Harry suddenly realises how obvious he’s being. Ron’s his only male friend – of course Malfoy would make the connection. “A friend of a friend,” he revises hastily. “Some guy from Beauxbaxtons.”
The student – Potter – laughed again. “It’s a bit much, isn’t it? Sorry– I’ve just never been allowed to put anything on the walls back in fost– back at home, so I may have gotten a little…er…enthusiastic.”
With a lot of begging, Hermione and Ron had dressed and apparated over, coming to Harry’s rescue. And now Harry found himself wedged between the two, opposite Draco, also wedged between his own friends. Draco hadn’t spoken to Harry directly at all. There was polite group chatter in which they both participated, but it wasn’t like their long nights alone in the office together, nothing like their lunches. For the most part, Draco spoke with his own friends, whispering into Pansy’s ear, laughing into Blaise’s shoulder.
“Actually,” Harry said, laying back and staring up at the ceiling - it’s not like Draco was looking at him anyway. “I thought you might finally stop playing since you’ve been at it for 14 hours straight.”
It takes a number of rings for Potter to answer and when he does with a simple “Hello?” his voice is a little breathless like he’s been exercising. Auror Training. Of course.
He was just debating internally whether it was morally appropriate to postpone the essay in favour of making a much different use of Potter’s jersey when the door swung open. Draco snapped his laptop shut.
“Malfoy, don’t drink that, it’s got cinnamon in it.”  Harry hadn’t meant to say it. He didn’t even know he was going to say anything at all until the words had already left his lips. By then, it was too late to censor himself.
Draco is listening to Harry, he really is, but he’s also staring, staring transfixed at this beautiful, compassionate man. With everything that he’s been through, no one could blame Harry if he were to become unkind, cynical, selfish. But he’s none of those things. Not even close. Despite all the darkness that has stolen its way into his life, Harry has remained a shining light, a saviour. Always. And Draco is just finding out what it’s like to have that light focused on you; it’s blinding.
“But if he’s– ” Harry stopped at the panic in Malfoy’s eyes. “If one of us is anxious, then why is the other one affected?”
“Ron will go fetch Slughorn and Pomfrey and explain what has happened,” Hermione says before Harry can answer. “I’ll stay here with…him. You and Malfoy can go somewhere else to talk.”
Harry’s in Kingsley Shacklebolt’s office in seconds. He doesn’t bother to knock. “What have you found out about him? Who have you assigned to investigate?”
Harry stood up quickly, but that didn’t help like he thought it would. Instead he found himself much closer to Draco, looking directly back at the softness. He extracted himself as fast as he could, stepping back around the chair so that it stood between them.
“We haven’t played in a long time,” Harry replies, seeing an opening and eagerly jumping in to grab it. “Maybe a rematch is in order.”
Draco lifted his head to fix Pansy with the dirtiest glare he could manage. She was a loyal friend, but merlin, she could be cruel.
But you haven’t heard yet. Hold up. So, Harry brushes his teeth and puts on his pajamas…and okay, boring, boring. You don’t want to hear about that. You want to hear about when Harry walks towards that light. As in the light from Malfoy’s wand in his dream. Not like walking into the light after death. That’s a completely different story.
But it was too late for that. Now Harry had to know what, or who, could possibly make Malfoy blush that hard. “I’ll find out soon enough so you might as well tell me,” he teased.
Malfoy’s eyes widened. He leant against the post of Harry’s bed with an attempt at casualness that was anything but. “Yes, well…” He paused, taking a sudden interest in Harry’s bed-hangings and then the floorboards of their shared room, before returning his eyes to Harry. “I have a thing for my pottery teacher.”
That unbearable hopelessness takes hold of him completely, temporarily drowning out its running mate; jealousy. He lets it turn him around and walk away. He’s had enough of being a puppet.
As his climax ended, Potter brought his lips down on Draco’s, kissing him with a lazy energy. He broke off and winked at Draco, his lips trailing down Draco’s chest and telling the rest of the story. Potter was going to lick his own come off Draco’s cock. Oh fuck.
Draco stood up, and fixed his eyes on a spot above Harry’s head. “I appreciate this might make you feel uncomfortable so I am more than happy to offer my resignation. I’ve already completed the paperwork for my finished cases, and if you’ll let me have one more day to compile my active - “
Malfoy pulled away too soon, a small smirk on his face. “Good luck then, Potter,” he said, carefully returning Harry’s glasses.
Potter must have picked up on Draco’s nerves - no not nerves, just unfamiliarly with the situation - because he rolled his eyes and held out his arm. Once Draco finished the glass, he had no more excuses, so he passed it to a nearby waiter and took Potter’s arm.
“Ah,” Draco draws out the word. “I just wasn’t good enough, was I?” He asks, his cold humour cutting as always. “Thought you could pick again?”
“Why not?” Hermione says. “It would explain why Harry can’t find him on the map. And the teachers could easily take the wards off a single fireplace.” She turns to Harry. “You’ll have to follow him in your cloak so you can hear where he floos to.”
Yes! Draco shouts internally. “I suppose so,” is what he says aloud to Potter. “Only because you begged so desperately.”
Draco’s poor virgin heart hadn’t known anything like this. He’d been disappointed that he couldn’t bring himself to live out his fantasy with Harry, but, Merlin, watching was something else. Watching was brilliant. Watching was 100% Draco Malfoy approved.
,” he tried desperately, even though he had dropped his wand behind him at the first sight of blood. “
And Draco, always the follower, found it catching. His mouth fell open of it’s own accord and let out the smallest huff of breath - a static laugh - before Draco shut it down.
flying and yet he’d only just picked up a broom at the start of the school year. How could Draco compete with that natural talent?
There was no denying the energy between them - the way Harry could feel every cell in his body come to life at Draco’s touch, the way Draco melted into Harry’s. But there was something else too, something that Harry had been trying to work out since that first time Draco had pulled him in for a kiss. Something in Draco’s eyes - when he stared unflinching into Harry’s, his whispers - when he seduced Harry with his words alone, and his laugh - when he made Harry feel as if there could only ever be light in this world.
“I understand, so if I need to find the information I need to look in the correct section. Is there a specific order to the files in each section,” Harry wondered.
Giving him an annoyed look, Ryan was probably the reason for his early wake-up call, “Sure, if that means that afterward you will eat your breakfast in an orderly fashion.”
“No I did that by myself, and I have been doing it for as long as I remember. I can’t really remember not doing it.”
“She is already waiting for you, down the hallway, second door to the left,” she replied before going back to her work not giving them another glance.
“I see, living with uncle Sev has taught you something,” stated Draco with a smirk on his face, before surprising Harry and offering his hand, “Hello, Heir Potter.”
“Yes!” Ethan exclaimed, “We can play Quidditch when we have free in the afternoon and then you can show me those great moves you have. You are after all the youngest seeker in a century”
“Harry was perfectly safe, Sirius. He was with his family and I never had any doubts about his wellbeing.”
The whole interview lasted several hours. Harry was asked lots of different questions regarding his home life. While they were talking Harry could see that both Severus and Mdm. Hawks were angry with some of the things he was telling them. He honestly did not see what was so bad, it could have been a lot worse. It wasn’t like he was hit all the time or that he was touched in places he shouldn’t be.
Seeing the completely devastated look on both of his sons’ faces, Severus added: “I am not saying he will have no free time, but it will be very scarce.” Looking at Harry who probably wanted to go into a million different questions he said. “We will be going over what you will be doing in detail tomorrow.” His tone saying the conversation was over.
“My name is Serena Moonlight-Snape you will address me with professor Moonlight, nothing else.” she said glancing to everyone.
“What about your cousin? Was it only your aunt and uncle who hit you or did your cousin participate?”
Not even fifteen minutes later found Harry seated in front of the desk in Snape his office. On the other side, Serena and Severus were seated.
You will find a section on vault statements. This is everything that can be found in each vault, this goes from the actual gold to items. These items can be almost anything, heirlooms, furniture, portraits, clothes, and so on.
“Severus, Serena, so good to see you both. How have you been?” asked Mr. Malfoy happily, greeting both Severus and Serena.
“Serena Moonlight will be replacing him as your Care of Magical Creatures professor. For the rest, the same rules will apply as last year. The forbidden forest stays forbidden and please look at the list put up by Mr. Filch with all forbidden items.” said professor Dumbledore before sitting back down.
“Yes, in most cases the sections are either ordered according to date, newest first. Otherwise, they are ordered value. This means the main vaults or properties first,” replied Severus.
“Feel free to call us Lucius or uncle Lucius and Narcissa or aunt Narcissa. You are considered family to Severus and you are family to Narcissa before through Lord Black,” Lucius stated with a small smile before sitting back down.
“Are you telling me that you don’t have your Gringotts key with you?” Neville exclaimed, outraged. This was insane. How could someone not have their own Gringotts key with them? The fact that Harry was acting like nothing was wrong only made it worse. Did no one tell him that everyone with your key and a written statement can access your vault? Did he know that people could have robbed him? Thinking about it more that was what probably was happing, someone was stealing his money.
Opening the folder named “Potter-Peverell”, Severus started, “As you can see each bank statement will start with changes that have been made since the previous statement. The following documents will then be the unchanged parts. The unchanged parts are always divided in the same way, but for each account, the order might be different. This means that the same information will be found in both the Potter accounts and the Black accounts, but not necessarily in the same order.
“Uhm, no Sir. I was never given my key. The last time I saw it was when me and Hagrid visited the bank before my first year.” Harry replied looking quite nervous.
“They are fine. And I am sure that you will have an easier time. Most of the time I am learning things both of you probably already know about. Plus I need to catch up an entire year in just a few weeks,” said Harry.
“No, it was my bedroom until I was eleven. After I got my Hogwarts letter they moved me into my cousin's second bedroom.”
Not only was he worried about making good impressions, but he was also nervous about the presents he had gotten everyone. To be honest, he barely knew them, and due to safety reasons, he was only allowed to owl order them. This would be the first time he would get presents on Christmas Eve, as usually the presents are delivered on Christmas Day at Hogwarts. Harry had already sent off his presents for his friends, or what was left of them, by an owl.
Being alone Harry thought about everything that had happened. While he was still quite confused about everything that had happened in the past hours, being here wasn’t as bad till now. He had a very nice and big room, which was probably twice the size of his room in Privet Drive.
“Maybe you should watch it” Harry bit back. Of course, he had to have a run-in with Malfoy. He had managed to avoid Malfoy and his goons till now, or had they avoided him? Not that it mattered. Harry was glad that he could focus on school for once instead of on this pity rivalry.
“I have no clue, Ryan, after getting tickets for the Quidditch World Cup last year and season tickets for your favorite team I have no idea how he is going to top that.” Said Ethan.
“How come I was placed with the Dursleys and Dumbledore was my guardian when my parents clearly did not want that.” Harry asked desperately for an answer.
Walking down the hallway Harry remembered the dinners with the Snapes. There had been two more after the first one. In the beginning it was pretty awkward, but seeing as Professor Snape had not made any degrading comments it was not that bad. He also got to meet the youngest Snape boy, Ryan, who was shy. It took him and Luna talking to the Ravenclaws, for them to finally give him a chance. As a result, he now had some friends.
“Well, with or without the adoption you are already our brother,” exclaimed Ryan, while Ethan nodded along. Hearing this Harry had never felt so included before, not even at the Weasleys.
“I still want to break this contract immediately if this is about me,” stated Harry stubbornly, looking back down to read through the contract.
Another section will be on contracts. This includes personal and house contracts. This can go from alliances, both personal and the entire house, to marriage contracts. This is also the section were the wills will end up, in case one is written.
PS: Let me know if you have some ideas for wizarding presents as my inspiration is currently lacking and I still have some birthdays and Christmases coming up. Also presents for the Snapes, Malfoys, or Harry’s friends welcome.
"No problem, as long as the students are informed of our relationship beforehand. We would want to prevent students drawing wrong conclusions and rumors going around."
Before Harry could try to run away or hide, Severus quickly grasped him. Holding him like you would hold a small child; he started rocking Harry back and forth saying comforting things at the same time. After the shock wore off being awoken, Harry started crying.
Harry was brought out of his thoughts when the floo activated. First stepping out was Draco Malfoy closely followed by his parents.
Another problem was that Dumbledore had not allowed Harry to stay at Grimmauld Place. Sirius had been asking Dumbledore since the start of the summer holidays to get Harry to Grimmauld Place but was constantly told it was not possible. According to Dumbledore Harry had to stay the majority of the summer at the Dursleys for his own protection. When Harry was then finally allowed to leave the Dursleys it was decided that Grimmauld Place was too dangerous with people constantly coming and going. As a result, Harry stayed the Weasleys, but Sirius was not allowed to visit due to safety precautions.
“You mentioned that you had to make breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Can you tell me at what age this started? Was someone helping you?”
Just like every year, during the summer, Severus Snape was walking towards the staff meeting. ‘The big oaf is late again’ he thought while sitting down next to Minerva McGonagall. ‘I hope this meeting does not take forever’
"She is my wife." said Severus, inwardly smirking at the shocked looks he got from the other staff members.
Ron was about to say something when the doors of their compartment slid open. It was Malfoy standing at the door. Surprisingly, Crabbe and Goyle were not behind him for a change.
The next morning during breakfast, Professor McGonagall was handing out everyone’s timetables. When she came at where fourth and fifth years where sitting she stopped.
“Well, congratulations mister Potter. You have 3 houses that you can claim. You are the lord of both the House of Potter and the House of Peverell. You are also the heir to the House of Black through your godfather. You might also like to know that you will not be receiving a creature inheritance upon your 16th birthday.” Ripclaw stated after reading the results. While reading out the form, 3 boxes appeared on his desk. “To claim all Houses you need to put on the rings found in the boxes.” Quickly glancing around Harry picked up the boxes and put on the rings inside.
After having read it over Serena said, “Everything seems in order. Now go send it off and then head straight to dinner.”
“You have to understand it was a dangerous and confusing time. I am sure it was just a small oversight.” Said Dumbledore, completely dismissing what happened.
“Thank you for the advice,” replied Harry. The offer that Severus had made before they left for the Ministry was still playing in his head.
Seeing Harry’s inner debate Severus stated “I understand that you and Draco have your issues, but I will be expecting the utmost behavior from both of you. Draco will have also been made aware that your childish rivalry will not be tolerated.”
“Luckily Draco does not have to worry about that.” causing Harry to turn to Ethan who had spoken. Turning his head Harry looked at Draco, waiting for an explanation.
“After you put the memories in they will disappear and be automatically classified in your file. No one but you and your guardian will have access to them. Three judges will view your memories, today’s questioning, and your file this afternoon. As you are a minor this will be anonymous, which means that any recognizable characteristics will be redacted. As such they will have no idea who’s file they are judging. The latest tomorrow morning you will receive an owl with the final judgment,” Mdm. Hawks explained.
Sirius knew from looking it up as a child, a lot needed to happen before guardians were deemed unfit. While he hated living at home, his parents never did anything that would have enabled the Ministry to call them unfit.
“I will definitely do that,” stated Harry, before standing up and gathering all the files that were spread across Severus’ desk. “Thank you for helping me, I will see you at dinner?”
“I think it will also be appropriate for you to call me Severus, you to Luna” said Severus seeing the look his wife gave him.
“Now onto the lesson. Golden unicorns are slightly different than there cousins the white unicorn or the winged unicorn, not thought in this class. The white unicorn is the most commonly known unicorn as they can be found in lots of places around the world. As all of you should know the white unicorns are born gold in color. After 2 years they turn silver, which then turns into pure white. They stay like this for the rest of their lives. The golden unicorn is also born gold in color, but their color never changes. This is the reason why poachers, stupid enough to capture unicorns, wait until they are at least 2 years old, you can see the different in species then. While the freely given blood of a white unicorn can only be used in potions, the freely given blood of a golden unicorn, when drunk, can protect the drinker for 32h from all magic with bad intent.”
“It is not that I do not believe you Mr. Potter it is just that if we have your memories we are not obliged to further investigate what happened. If you are not willing to provide them we will also need to talk to your current guardians before we make a final decision on your living situation. Both options are the same to me, so it is really up to you what you are comfortable with.”
This was the first time someone had ever held him after a nightmare. In Hogwarts he usually had silence spells up so the others barely noticed that he was having nightmares. And at the Dursleys, he would have been locked up without food and extra chores if he dared to wake them up during the night. This was the safest and loved he had felt in a very long time.
“Yes, sir” replied Harry. While he didn’t like that his life was being controlled this was also the first time that someone seemed to care about what he was doing.
"You will be known as professor Moonlight, so people do not confuse you with professor Snape." Albus said with his twinkle.
Seeing they were done Severus Snape said. “I would also like a card to be made for Mister Potter” turning to Harry he explained, “This card is tied to your specific magical signature. It allows you to pay in both the muggle and wizarding world without always having to come here to withdraw money”. “Here is your card mister Potter,” Ripclaw said handing Harry a black and gold card. “It was a pleasure doing business with you, May your gold increase” greeted Ripclaw before another goblin escorted them to the entrance hall.
“It will be done as soon as possible. Gringotts apologies for any part we might have played in this. We will do a full inquiry into the Potter accounts and punish anyone found guilty.” Said Ripclaw, with a bloodthirsty grin. “We will now continue with your heir test. This should have been done a year ago, but better late than never”.
“Now, what I called you in here for is to decide what to do when your guardians are deemed unfit. Selena and I spoke lengthily about this and we also talked to the boys and if you would like it we would like to offer to adopt you if you like. The choice is completely up to you,” said Severus, now directly looking into Harry’s eyes.
“Harry, I would like you to meet my brother Ryan. Ryan, this is a friend of mine Harry.” introduced Ethan.
Looking down at his own list, Severus stated, “It would seem so. Hmm, this would mean that you have some control over what is printed. If you can find someone who has at least 15% of the shares, you can control what they write.”
“Tell me Dumbledore, where did you leave Harry?” demanded Sirius, looking like he would kill on the spot.
“NO!” exclaimed Ethan. “I really have no idea why everyone thinks that. I mean when we were younger and had nightmares we even crawled into dad’s bed at night.”
Quickly glancing at Harry Severus Snape said “I want all transfers of money stopped as soon as possible. I also want a copy of all previous transfers, send to me so we can get every galleon back. Don’t worry Harry, it might take some time but we will get everything back”.
“This day is getting longer and longer” muttered Ripclaw, before speaking up “Seeing the circumstances we are able to immediately remove Dumbledore as mister Potters guardian. We will need to file everything we found today with the ministry to make it official. This does leave open the question as of who would be mister Potter's new magical guardian. As you know Mdm. Longbottom, you are not able to become his magical guardian since you only operate as proxy. This only allows you to be the guardian over an heir/lord apparent who is your immediate relation.” Ripclaw stated, pointing out their next problem.
“It was fun, I learned a lot. I was even able to turn my teapot into a tortoise by the end of class.” said Ethan very exited.
The rest of the day was spent learning many different skills that he would need to be presentable at the societal parties. Just before dinner, he went in search for Serena, wanting to get the apology letter done and over with.
“Boys, you know that this morning you should be working on your holiday homework. Like always after lunch, you will have time to enjoy yourself. Your mother and I will be talking with Harry this morning, so please don’t disturb us except if there is an emergency.” stated Severus before turning to look at Harry,
“Ryan, come here” said Snape, taking Ryan into his arms and putting him on his lap hugging him closely.
“Yes, that would be no problem,” confirmed Severus after reading the marriage contract again to make sure he did not miss anything. “If you want, we can send a request off to the goblins immediately to break the marriage contract. After they have approved our request, they will inform the Ministry department to finalize everything and to make sure any other possible marriage contracts between you and Ginny are broken.”
Realizing that he would not get the answer, Albus continued "Can you bring her here next week Thursday at 6pm? Then I will see if she can have the job." He was hoping that he could get the answer from her.
Looking up Harry saw that indeed Hagrid was not sitting at the staff table. More surprising Snape was talking to the new person sitting next to him.
At the end of the questioning, Harry was also asked if he was willing to give them some memories since it would build a stronger case.
“My guardians are muggles and I have never received any owls” Harry stated depressed. Well, this was excluding the owls he got from the Weasleys, Hermione, and Dumbledore. Oh, and he did receive a notification about underage magic once. Now thinking about it, Harry did wonder why he had never received any fan mail while growing up. He was after all the boy-who-lived and even though he hated it many people kissed the ground he walked on.
Harry was feeling overwhelmed. His relatives had received money for him? Uncle Vernon always said Harry had to work for his keep and now he hears they have actually received money? It would not surprise them if the money they received had been spent on Dudley. Did he say that money had been taken for the past 8 years? But he only discovered the wizarding world 5 years ago, so how could he have taken money out?
“Ryan, I wouldn’t be mad at you, not for this. Them that’s something else, they shouldn’t treat you like that because of who I am. And Ryan it’s true that I would have preferred that you were in my house, but I wouldn’t have cared if you were sorted in any of the other 3 houses. The hat decided that you belong in Ravenclaw and that just means you’re my smart little boy and it’s the same house as your mum.” said Snape.
“Well, you are a lord. And this summer there were the heir classes. I honestly was surprised not to see you there.” Neville told him sounding a bit unsure. Why would Harry ask him about this now? They had been in school for almost have the year and Harry never mentioned anything about it. But then the way he asked it almost sounded like he heard it for the first time. No, that is impossible. Every minor with a lord of heir title awaiting them was contacted by the Ministry concerning the summer meetings. Furthermore, his legal guardian should have informed him since he was 12 years old about his future. And just to be sure Gringotts has to inform every 13-year old, as they need to claim their heir rings.
“Harry,” explained Severus in a calm tone “Marriage contracts are just there to protect the child. Normally each party can easily leave the contract when they do not longer find it beneficial. There is of course also always a clause in it that allows a party to leave in case his or her creature’s mate is found. Having a marriage contract protects children from being entered into other unbeneficial marriage contracts. As you know it is impossible to have two marriage contracts. This means that if a child, more specifically the heir to a House, already has a marriage contract he or she can in no way be tricked into another one. This method is used by most old Houses to prevent children from being accidentally being entered into marriage contracts that are there to gain access to their fortune.”
“Who do you think is that woman sitting next to Professor Snape? Have any of you seen Hagrid?” Hermoine asked after looking at the staff table.
“Like you don’t know” Malfoy stated before walking away, leaving a very confused Harry behind. Did Potter really think his innocent act would work? Everyone had gotten a personal invite by the Ministry so it was impossible that he did not know anything.
The day of the interview Albus was trying to figure out how to best get the answers he wanted. He was not used to people keeping him in the dark and definitely did not like it. But he did not have a lot of time to think about it because soon there was a knock on the door.
“You are right, I cannot imagine that Lily and James would have not had several guardians listed in their will in case something happened.” Mdm. Longbottom said looking over at Ripclaw to look in the will.
“To allow the will to be read, you need to place a drop of your blood on it mister Potter” stated Ripclaw handing Harry a thick piece of paper. Placing a drop of his blood on the will, it opened up and an image of James and Lily Potter was projected.
“Well, that does not surprise me knowing Lord Black is your godfather. According to my mother, he was almost more excited when you were born than the late Lord Potter.” Draco agreed, easily. To outsiders, it would seem like both were having quite a nice conversation.
“Harry this is currently one of the most important sections,” says Severus drawing Harry’s attention away from the properties, “this lists all your investments. It will be important that we look into this and where necessary sell the shares. Depending on the percentage of shares you have, you can also have a say in what the company does.”
“Look, mister Potter, Mdm. Longbottom is not qualified to have the guardianship over you. She is not a lord herself and has no direct relation to you. Mister Black is still a wanted criminal and even if cleared will need to undergo possible years of mental treatment before he even comes close to being cleared to gain guardianship over anyone. Mister Lupin is not allowed because of his status as werewolf and Mrs. and Mr. Longbottom are currently in St. Mungo's. Since Lord Prince-Snape is the next person in line in your parent's will, he receives preference. He is the current Lord Prince and as such has the ability and qualifications to guide you in your future duties as a lord yourself.” Ripclaw interfered trying to explain to mister Potter that this was the best solution.
“She is not allowed to deny you. As long as you are staying with an adult during the holidays the school has no say over you. No worries, if she for some reason does deny your request I am sure my grandmother will take it up with the school board.” Neville stated assured. There was no way that they could legally deny Harry to go spend the holidays at his place. One thing they knew for sure is that these holidays were going to get very interesting.
Knowing his present was not as impressive as his own, Harry hoped Draco would still love it. Harry had gotten him a rare DADA book and a silver cauldron, knowing Draco wanted to get his Potion mastery besides his (later) Lord duties.
But the best present was surprisingly from Draco. Harry did not really expect a huge present from him, so was not surprised to receive a small box. Opening it, Harry saw how amazing it was. It was the snitch used at the World Cup last year, signed by both seekers. Harry honestly could not believe Draco would give it to him as a present and not keep it himself. But not looking a gift horse in the face, Harry just thanked him.
“Won’t Harry’s parents have stated possible guardians in their will?” Neville suddenly said, thinking he might have found a solution.
After hearing the will Harry was in shock. He was never supposed to go to the Dursleys? He could have had a good home where he would have been loved? He really wanted to know who had placed him with the Dursleys.
I am not so sure what to do with Sirius and Remus. Anyone any ideas? Like how big of a role do you want them to play?
Before heading to bed Harry was stopped by Severus, handing him a small potion bottle. “Harry, this is a dreamless sleep potion. Take it for tonight, but you cannot take this to much or you will get addicted to it.”
“Since it has been a busy and probably overwhelming day for you I will leave everything that will happen during the holidays for tomorrow. The only thing you need to be aware of now is that dinner will be served at 7 and breakfast at 8. In case you need any help you can call for Twinkle and she will assist you with anything you need.
After these three dinners, he got to see a completely different side of professor Snape. He was actually really nice and you could see how much he loved his wife and kids. Harry once asked why professor Snape was so mean in class. As an answer, he got that potions were one of the most dangerous arts. One little mistake could heavily injure someone and even lead to death. Even though that explanation made sense, Harry got the feeling he was omitting something, definitely after what he said at the end of the first dinner.
“Now for the next part. As we discovered before there have been some payments that for some reason mister Potter is not aware of. We did some research and have figured out where the money is going. There is a total of 1.000 pounds placed in the account of the Dursleys each month. There is also a yearly withdrawal of 10.000 galleons by one Minster Dumbledore. Of these 1.500 galleons are deposited each in the vaults of Ginerva Weasley and Ronald Weasley. 4.000 galleons are deposited in the account of Molly Weasley and 3.000 galleons are going to the personal account of Albus Dumbledore. There has also been an irregular number of around 500 galleons withdrawn at the beginning of each school year.” states Ripclaw. After he finished the whole room erupted.
“Miss Greengrass, it is not because people have not seen a certain creature for a long time, they are extinct. There are quite a lot of them, luckily for all of you one of them is a good friend of mine and has agreed to come today,” said Professor Moonlight.
Serena and Severus had also been a huge help in helping him get through the social minefield that is politics and etiquette. In just a few days’ time, they had already pointed out so many things that he was doing wrong. He honestly did not realize that you could insult or offend people in so many different ways. It was truly a miracle that he had survived this far. But even with all the lessons and rules that were being drilled into his head, he was still quite worried about attending the balls. This was already his second chance, which meant he would not get another. Meeting the Malfoys for Christmas would be some kind of pre-test. While Harry still had to abide by most of the rules, it would be in an informal setting, which would provide him with a bit more leeway. He had been so relieved when Severus told him that no matter what he decided concerning the adoption, they would still continue to help him with any etiquette and rules he needed. At least that gave Harry one less thing to worry about.
“I would wake up, and make breakfast. After breakfast, I was given a list of chores to do for the day. I would also make lunch and dinner and then go back to sleep,” said Harry.
“Welcome to a new year! Before I make any announcements the sorting ceremony will begin. This year we also have a transfer student who will be joining the third years.” Professor Dumbledore said before sitting back down.
“There you two are, we were getting worried you two would have started arguing again,” joked Severus.
In walked a beautiful woman. She had long brown hair that fell to just beneath her shoulders, hazel brown eyes that could see into your soul, and a blood red robe draped around her. But what drew all the attention were the green wings that hung folded on her back.
“Ok, then you can call me Luna.” She said standing to leave together with Ryan. Ethan was already gone, after saying goodbye to his parents.
Looking further at all the investments and shares Severus concluded, “everything seems to be in order an there are currently no shares that I would advice you to sell. If you want to look into it more, you can always do so of course.”
“There will be a separate investigation in your home life at a later date. We at Gringotts have no authority concerning where children are placed. We only have some control over the magical guardian when this is a separate person.” stated Ripclaw showing that the matter was closed. He really wanted to continue this as they still had quite some work to get through.
“We shall see, it also depends on where you will be living by then,” stated Severus, before going to taking out the next section.
Looking back at her file Mdm. Hawks started her questioning, “Am I correct that you currently reside with a Mrs. and Mr. Dursley?”
The next morning saw Harry walking alone towards his Care of Magical Creatures class, which as usual was held at the border of the forbidden forest.
Do you prefer male pregnancy (only for creatures) or do you prefer a surrogate. This means that the ‘genetics and magic’ of both males are combined. The first 4 months baby develops in a ‘lab’, after it is transferred in a surrogate for the final ‘5 months’. This is from both sides unanimous and thus is as no link between the two (not even paper trail). PS: the surrogate is a voluntary job and only allowed for 2 pregnancies.
Today was the day. After spending Christmas Eve with the Snapes and Malfoys this evening would be the Christmas ball at the Greengrasses. As Christmas Eve and even the daytime of Christmas day was reserved for family, the ball is done on the eve of Christmas day. If Harry was completely honest he had to admit that he was quite nervous for tonight. While yesterday evening went quite well with the Malfoys, that did not mean tonight would good as well. He got the feeling that due to the connection the Malfoy family has with the Snapes, they kind off had to treat him well.
After watching it burn to crisp, he turned around to the shocked faces of Ryan, Ethan and even Serena and Severus who had both decided to join the present opening.
After finishing Exploding-Snap they spend the rest of the afternoon playing Quidditch in the garden. Tomorrow they would go to the Ministry who would decide who would gain guardianship over him. After spending almost a week with the Snapes Harry couldn’t deny that he wished that maybe he could stay with them. The only thing he knows is that under no circumstances is he ever returning to the Dursleys.
Professor McGonagall went to stand in the front and before she opened her scroll she said: “Please make him feel welcome.”
Right at that moment, there was a group of six golden unicorns coming out of the forest. Four of them were clearly adults, while the last 2 were smaller. Following Professor Moonlight the class walked towards the golden unicorns. Motioning to the class to stop, a few meters away from the group of unicorns, Professor Moonlight stepped forwards, stopping right next to the unicorns.
While Harry was glad that he was finally starting to learn everything he needed to, he could not deny that he was not looking forward to the work. He had hoped that he would still have plenty of time to play Quidditch and so but that did not seem realistic. It was of course only logical seeing that he was behind almost 2 years on his peers, who started at the age of 14 and lived their whole lives in the wizarding world.
The first file was a contract between the House of Potter and the House of Longbottom. Looking at the contact itself there was little to worry about. It mainly talked about supporting each other in the Wizengamot, to protect each other’s House members when necessary, and to never have an unfriendly attack towards the other. Furthermore, the contract promotes that the children of each House are raised together to further the alliance. Reading the details, it became clear to Harry that these alliances were both a protection measure and a friendship.
One hour later found Harry anxiously entering the dining room. While he did have several meals with the Snape family at Hogwarts this was a completely different situation. First of all, he didn’t have other students or Luna by his side and secondly, he was now also living with the Snape’s for the next three weeks.
Severus had also been helping him with his nightmares. After the first time, he had been having them almost every night. While taking dreamless sleep potions helped, they were sadly enough addicting. The solution was a combination of occlumency and dreamless sleep potions. Meditating and clearing his mind before going to bed, really helped in keeping the nightmares away. Severus had also spelled Harry’s room to notify him if Harry had one of his nightmares. Being woken up almost immediately and having someone there allowed Harry to fall back asleep.
“Harry, this is not ok. No one but you should have your key. Look, I will owl my grandmother and ask her what to do. For now, don’t talk about this to anyone until we figure out who is behind all of this and what is going on.” Neville said. His grandmother would for sure know how to best handle this. This was a complete outrage, a pureblood not knowing anything. This also explained how Harry had acted in these last few years. While we were all thinking he was being disrespectful and did not care, the truth was he had no idea about anything.
Seeing that the house-elves had already sorted the presents according to person, Harry took a seat next to his pile. Looking a bit closer he was really surprised by the amount of presents but most definitely by the amount of letters that made up his pile. Going through his friends in his head he actually wondered from whom some letters and presents were.
“When I came home from Hogwarts they were afraid I was going to use magic on them so they left me alone. But halfway through they found out that I cannot use magic outside Hogwarts. After that my uncle put up bars in front of my window and locks on my door. My aunt would give me a soup can a day through the flap door and let me out to use the bathroom once a day.”
“I am really glad Draco mentioned me not being at the heir meetings this summer.” This surprised Draco as he had not expected Harry to give him some of the credit.
The funny thing was that both Ethan and Ryan loved the Malfoys. They had known them their entire life. To make things worse Mr. Malfoy was Ethan’s godfather. The stories they had told him over the past week drew an entirely different picture of the Malfoy family. Harry hoped he would make a good impression since, according to Ethan, Malfoy had a lot of influence over his other peers. In other words, if he could gain the acceptance of Malfoy, there was a big chance the other heirs, and through them, their parents might accept them.
Making sure she had everyone’s attention Serena announced, “I expect all of you to be ready and in the receiving room by five-thirty, tonight.” Seeing that all three boys had understood, both she and Severus stood up, leaving the boys behind at the breakfast table.
Overhearing the conversation that what going on between Harry and Ethan, Severus decided to interrupt, “Ethan I am sorry, but Harry will probably not have time to teach you much Quidditch these holidays.”
That morning before going to the Ministry Harry was called into Severus’ office. Harry had been nervous that entire morning and was not entirely sure what was going to happen. He knew that they would look into his home situation. He was mostly afraid that his life was going to be the big evening news in every witch and wizard’s home.
Opening the file Harry only saw a total of six different contracts. The first three were general house alliance contracts. Recalling his readings Harry recalled that this meant that the alliance was valid for every member of the Potter house. Looking at the three files Harry could see that a similar structure was used.
Giving the cookies the same treatment as the cake, Harry opened the last letter. This one had no presents attached and it seemed as though the manor wards had attacked it.
Snape’s face changed first to anger then sadness and eventually something that could be described as love.
“Heir classes? What’s that?” Harry exclaimed, feeling more and more left out the loop. Harry did not know what was better Malfoy having lied about everything or him finding out that again he was kept in the dark.
Seeing how nervous Harry was at the breakfast table, Serena decided to take his mind off things. “Harry, your dress robes for the next few days have been delivered this morning,” Serena declared, making Harry jump out of his thoughts.
The word rings in Harry’s ears, and the force of the spell hits him from behind so hard he falls to his knees. He opens his eyes, first searching for Draco making sure that’s he’s okay. He’s back to his earlier position, leaning against the bedpost, but instead of a smirk, his face is split open wide laughing, and he’s twirling a wand between his fingers,
Parkinson’s face dropped but only for a second. She tilted her head and smiled at Harry in that way Professors do right before they tell you you’ve earned a T for Troll on your essay. “Why aren’t you choosing dare?”
A question mark? Is the map not sure? The map has never not been sure before. Even when someone is under the effects of polyjuice potion, the map still knows their real name. How can it not know whether this is Draco Malfoy or not?
could you have to be here?” He asked the question like he already knew the answer. If only Harry did too.
?” Draco interrupted, at the same time Harry realised what he’d said. The alcohol was loosening his tongue.
Potter wasn’t the worst dormmate in the world. He wasn’t around much, so the dorm was quiet, and when he was, he usually left Draco alone, which Draco would have appreciated. Except, of course, he’d gone and developed a pathetic little crush on Potter so he relished any attention he could get.
“Are you sure you - “ Draco started but faltered when Harry pulled his trousers and pants down and took his dick into his mouth without hesitation. “
Draco nods. “But I do.” He wipes his face, removing the remains of his tears and sighs. “I’m sorry as well…for…you know.”
“Why – “ Harry starts to ask, stuffing his wand back into his back pocket as he trails behind Draco into the corridor, but Draco turns and slaps a hand over his mouth, muffling him.
“Do you come here often?” He asked, without thinking, to fill the silence. Too late, he realised exactly what that sounded like.
“You sound surprised,” Harry replies, not bothering to whisper back. Albus and Scorpius are too far away to hear them, already making their way onto the Hogwarts Express, holding hands as they had been all Summer.
Draco took a step closer so he could actually look down at Potter, Auror training or not, and regain at least some control over the situation. “Don’t play coy with me, Potter. Here you are, at my place of work,
Draco stands up a little straighter and surveys the crowd before turning to Harry. Tears brim at his eyes and there’s the barest hint of a smile on his lips, as if he’s allowing himself to believe in the possibility of a future with Harry for the first time.
“I’d suggest being in contact when you drink the antidote,” Slughorn says from behind Narcissa, holding out a small vial. “Less space between you to cause complications.”
He doesn’t look back until he’s outside the wards. Malfoy stands at the gates, wand still raised. “If you still want to talk, go through my contact. I won’t have strangers turning up at my house unannounced,” he says to the air, before turning and beginning the long walk back across the Manor’s lawn.
Hands curled around Harry’s where they hung limply at his sides. Harry opened his eyes to find Draco staring right back at him.
Potter sat down without hesitation, not even attempting to play it cool. It was actually a little intimidating how little Potter seemed to have to control his actions. Draco could only aspire to reach that level of comfort in himself.
Harry cleared his throat. “I dare you– ” his eyes flickered to Malfoy’s tight sleeves– “to show us your Dark Mark.”
“Yes, you are.” Harry finally understands, the knots in his stomach begin to unravel. Why didn’t he see it before? “
The change was instant. One second, Harry was staring up at Draco Malfoy with black hair, the next, it was back to his trademark slicked-back platinum. Harry brought a hand up to his own hair to check.
So when Harry called Draco into his office - the start to many a fantasy - last thing on a Friday before he could leave with the other aurors, Draco knew Harry wouldn’t understand the thoughts that were running through his head. Empty Department. Friday night. Boss’s office. Harry Potter’s thighs.
Malfoy just looks at him sadly as he jumps back on his broom and flies away from the castle. He disappears into the darkness quickly, leaving Harry with no option to follow him.
Draco swallowed and pulled at his collar. “Look– you’ve misunderstood. I just mean that I hardly know you.”
Potter straightened his glasses, peering at Draco with new concentration. “That’s my jersey,” he repeated.
“I don’t know either,” Harry admitted. “Why don’t we forget it for now and just do what feels good?” he suggested.
Draco was furious. First, that wild animal of Hagrid’s had attacked him - and he still had the sling to prove it even if it wasn’t completely necessary - and second, one of the horrid nifflers that same oaf had brought onto school grounds had ambushed Draco and stolen the shiny Malfoy crest pin right off his robes.
Draco stifled a cough as he swallowed the champagne he’d been sipping a little too fast. “Excuse me,” he choked out. “You can’t talk to me like that.”
Malfoy stares back at Harry defiantly. “If I was a registered werewolf, you’d already know about. If I was an unregistered werewolf, I’d hardly admit by illegal status to an Auror. Kindly don’t waste my time with brainless questions. So, will that be all?”
Harry shook his head. He couldn’t keep letting those thoughts in. He pulled his hand from his mouth and cast a quick tempus charm. 11.59am. Close. Harry had been here far too long, humiliatingly early, but he hadn’t been able to concentrate on anything else all morning so he figured sitting and waiting was as good as pacing in his dorm. The staff kept shooting him sympathetic looks though, like he’d been stood up. Maybe he would be.
Malfoy stood up abruptly, the spiced firewhisky discarded on the floor. Everyone turned to him and Harry was grateful for the reprieve from probing eyes. “I’m not staying sober while the rest of you get plastered. I’ll grab some regular firewhisky from my dorm.”
Harry walked around his table and stood across from Malfoy’s, looking down at his soulmate who seemed very interested in studying the plush pink carpet at their feet. Harry cleared his throat and Malfoy looked up sharply.
His target, a too-thin and too-angular boy with white-blond hair and pale grey eyes like the clouds on a sunny day, stands by the grand doors, as if readying an escape.
He was always tired. Always on edge. But he couldn’t lose his concentration, not even for a second. If his glamour dropped, everyone would see what he really looked like. Ugly. Scarred. Disgusting.
The following morning, Malfoy doesn’t turn up to Potions. Harry’s gut clenches every time he glances over at the empty seat in the back corner. It’s not that he has any well wishes for Malfoy but he doesn’t want anything bad to happen to him either, especially not at his hand. He’s shouldered the silent responsibility for the pain of his friends and family his entire life, he is not eager to add his arch-enemy to the list too. He tries to concentrate on his classwork, but his traitorous eyes keep returning to Malfoy’s seat.
“Get on with it, then,” Draco tried to snap, but his voice came out much more breathy than he intended and ending up just sounding desperate. Which he was, of course.
And then Potter was pushing Draco back, guiding him towards the bed as they kissed. Draco gave into it willingly, eager for all the additional things they could do horizontally. Potter’s last push was rough and made Draco fall back onto the bed. Draco thought he might have liked that a little too much.
“He’s precisely the person we’d like to speak with,” interrupts Hermione smoothly with a warning side glance at Harry. “We’d like to know where the Dunberg baby is being kept.”
Draco looks over to Potter. He’s already well into his meal, mashing his meatballs into mince as he goes, which seems rather against the point. Why not just order spaghetti bolognaise? Draco watches Potter’s fork as it drops back to his plate, tightly twisting tendrils of spaghetti…until it drops. Draco lifts his gaze and catches Potter watching him.
“I hadn’t thought of that,” Hermione says aloud, but clearly directed at herself, when Harry points this out. She looks up at Harry. “No matter. Perhaps I’m preparing a thesis for an apprenticeship position I’m vying for.”
was Potter showing no respect for fine clothing and attacking the buttons of Draco’s robes. He started off frenzied, impatient, but around Draco’s chest, Potter started to slow down. There were a lot of buttons and they were hard work. Draco knew this well - he was the one who had to button them all up after all.
The next disappointment (following the reveal that Malfoy wears underpants to bed instead of going commando as Harry had always
“I’m sure you are aware, Malfoy, that brewing Wolfsbane Potion is illegal. Only the Ministry can authorise the–”
“Yes,” Draco said, giving up on lifting the bag and dragging it across the floor into his dormroom. “I’m particular.”
“Oh.” Hermione looks awfully uncomfortable. “Well, the sexual attraction only occurs if you’re already romantically attracted to the person. So, if you’re both – um. Right, I might just leave you to it.” She’s back inside the classroom before Harry can stop her again. Although, he’s not sure he wants to anymore.
In a little bit of a daze, Draco turned back to the stage, but Potter had disappeared. Again. Draco couldn’t deal with this much longer. He tugged at his collar. His mind was spinning.
“No, I meant - do you want to go together?” Potter said, swaying on the spot ever so slightly. “I’ll pick you up in a car - or we can apparate together. Maybe we can have dinner beforehand? I can’t stand the fancy stuff they serve at these things. I end up drinking firewhisky on an empty stomach all night and getting a lot drunker than I should and saying things I don’t mean.”
So this was their November third interaction this year; passing each other by in a coffee shop. What would happen next year? Would they just happen to be in the Ministry on the same day, on different floors, and never once see each other? And the year after that, would they simply be in the same country as each other and that was that? Would November third cease to be anything at all? Would Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy cease to be anything to each other at all?
He made his exit before Potter could convince him to have sex right then and there - which Draco wasn’t so certain he’d be able to refuse with the state of his head what it was and Potter…being Potter. But he couldn’t help but glance back as he walked away, just for a quick, innocent look.
But Draco held out hope that Potter was merciful, that he’d go easy on Draco. And he was right. Well, at least, Potter
I actually do have a heart. Which you would know if you knew me at all. Which you don’t. So don’t presume to.
Draco felt some of the adrenaline he was missing building in his bloodstream. This was more like it. “Don’t tell me you’re a sore loser, Potter,” he teased, enjoying the way Potter’s face flushed in reaction.
is it?” Potter asked, his words clearly articulated with a wide smile leftover from his laughter. "I don’t know how I feel about
Potter nods and reaches out his hand to hold Draco’s, gently, always gently. Draco tries to hold back a shiver. “You need to be ready very soon.”
…” Harry stops when he realises he’s rambling and starts again. “I’ll meet you at your dorm tomorrow morning before breakfast.”
“Right,” Draco said, after an uncomfortable silence, “I’ll see you on Monday, then.” He stood up to make his undignified exit.
Draco knew Potter would come. In some ways, he was relieved about his lack of choice in the matter. If it wasn’t his choice, then he wasn’t doing anything wrong. But on the other hand, any time spent with Potter, would only make all the time away from him harder. And there was so much more time away from him.
“Yes, obviously Ronald,” Hermione says impatiently, looking rather hyped up. “Regardless, he’s told us what we need to know.”
vulgar. Far too vulgar for your sophisticated tastes. But if you happen to accidentally leave the phone line open and hear every second, then that’s none of my business.”
“I told you I fly better in the dark,” Malfoy says, back on the ground, his voice deliberately smug, his lips turned upwards into a smirk.
Harry is glad Ron doesn’t seem too miffed when Harry dashes off – he’s much too concerned in his heaped plate of various meat to care. Knowing he hasn’t much time until the start of class, and not wanting to waste the opportunity now that he’s finally thought of it, Harry races upstairs to the Gryffindor tower. By the time he reaches The Fat Lady, he’s puffing a little bit more than he’d like. Taking a year off Quidditch is obviously affecting him.
to show up. Draco had been waiting for it ever since Potter skipped the Hogwarts Express at the start of term. Draco knew he’d only have to wait a couple of months. That’s what had kept him going all this time.
Draco would have much preferred to stay in bed all day. Anything to avoid Potter, and regain some sleep. But he was supposed to be good this year. And he really needed perfect grades if he was going to land a job after school. He didn’t have the same extracurricular activities as Potter to include on his resume. What was he going to say?
Harry thinks back over the potion. “I reduced the portion of doxy eggs, increased the nightshade, added asphodel root and–”
potion?” Malfoy’s eyes dart across his own body, from his exposed ankles to the open button at his collar where the potion has leaked beneath his shirt. He jerks his head back up. “Are you trying to
Harry smiled. Malfoy would earn their respect by his own merit soon enough. In the meantime, Harry was happy to help, especially if it meant he got to date
Potter’s confidence was rather disconcerting. It clearly had the power to turn him into a squirming mess as well as a pathetic follower eager to please all at once.
The past year had been different of course. Finally, he and Draco had been able to make new memories day after day. To have something special outside of that one wretched day. So perhaps this was the start of another new year of memories. Perhaps November third could mean something else. It could be less about a moment, and more about what it was to stay.
Harry woke up to a half-naked Draco Malfoy standing over his bed. At first he thought he was still dreaming until Malfoy called out to him:
“Fine.” He hesitated a moment longer as if waiting for Harry to say something else and then turned on the spot, beginning to stomp away.
Even with Malfoy’s atypical behaviour recently, it’s completely unexpected and Harry can’t help but feel disappointed.
“A lot of things. Many that I definitely won’t be saying without Veritaserum.” Draco dropped his hands and let his eyes fall to the table. There was a slight blush on the edges of his cheekbones that made Harry curious. “There is one thing, though, that I’ve been meaning to…” He trailed off and looked back up at Harry seriously. “I’m sorry,” he said. “For the big things. For the little things. For everything I’ve done that’s made your life harder. For every hex and for every line of ink in this stupid mark on my arm. I’m sorry.”
It worked. Harry could see it in Malfoy’s face. The shock, the confusion, the realisation and most importantly the loss of focus. But unfortunately Harry had been so wrapped up in Malfoy’s expressions, he had lost his too. They’d both lost sight of the snitch and were hurtling towards each other at the fastest speeds their brooms would allow.
Harry shrugs. What was he supposed to do? Illegally force feed Malfoy veritaserum? “He’s not going to tell me.”
“Please stay,” Draco interrupts before Potter can get away. He can’t let him get away. He’s not going to hospital. “I can’t explain, but I need you to stay.” His vague words don’t seem to have that much effect. He tries pleading instead: “
It’s not long before he arrives at Draco’s adhoc dorm and spells it open. He has a quick look around but it’s as he expected – empty. Without much further thought he heads over to the fireplace, and searches for the floo powder he knows must be here. The mantelpiece is empty, or at least it appears so, but Harry’s not convinced. He feels arounds with his hand and
Harry twists back to the front of the classroom. Madam Pomfrey stands beside Professor Slughorn, hands clasped tightly at her chest. Her expression is blank, controlled, but thick wisps of hair hang from her usually pristine bun, and her mascara is noticeably smudged below one eye.
Harry circled the pitch again and again, purposefully avoiding Malfoy as much as possible. He could see that smirk in his peripheral vision every time they passed but he didn’t give Malfoy the satisfaction of a reaction. Slytherin scored again. Harry had to catch the snitch now.
a little faster than normal,” Draco said quietly, dropping his hand. "Do you often feel out of breath?” He asked, eyes flickering back up to Harry’s face.
“I can give you a tour?” suggests Harry, trying to get ahead of Malfoy, to assess the upcoming damage of other rooms.
A burning pain danced throughout Draco’s body - a nasty stinging jinx - before settling in his left forearm. It wasn’t unusual - for Draco to be hexed, or for the pain to concentrate around his dark mark. The magic within the mark was still very much alive, and it was always reacting to other magic passing through it, the harsh lines pushing to the surface of Draco’s skin with a draining energy. Draco had learned to manage it when he cast his own spells, but getting hit with them was another story.
“You have a thing for your pottery teacher,” Harry repeated blankly, trying to process the absurd excuse. “When have you ever taken a pottery class?”
Shit. Malfoy hadn’t meant to say anything. How had that even come out of his mouth? And he certainly hadn’t expected Potter to stop. Shit. Potter was looking at him expectantly. Draco found himself trapped between the way he wanted to act and how he was supposed to act around Harry Potter. He hadn’t felt like that since the day he - wait. “What day is it?”
Draco realised what he had said. “Oh no, it doesn’t,” he quickly backtracked. “I didn’t mean it like that.”
So he wasn’t resigning, and he had just told his boss about his fantasy very much involving said boss. Draco really was a master of screwing things up.
At close, Draco was still playing around with the machine, his face an image of furious concentration. Harry smiled as he untied his apron. Draco wasn’t as bad as Tonks had implied. He was a little prickly at the edges, yes, and his pride needed to be knocked down a couple of pegs, yes, but there was something about him that Harry liked. Perhaps it was the intensity in his eyes or his silent determination, but whatever it was, Harry was looking forward to his next shift.
“Yes, my place,” Potter continues, all the while smiling across the table. “Draco won’t be able to resist my homemade risotto.”
“You heard him,” Ron said. He stood up, blocking Harry (and his embarrassingly red face) from the rest of the room.  “Don’t be a prick and make him repeat it.” Ron turned to Parkinson. “Let’s call it a night– ”
Harry discreetly assesses his visible body parts for any remaining wolf fur before sitting down. “What?”
And with Potter’s cock in his mouth now, he decided it would not have been unreasonable. Potter was doing
“I’m not fretting”, Narcissa insists, tightening her hold. “I’m hugging my son whom I haven’t seen in over a week.”
“I wasn’t saying anything,” comes Pansy’s lying voice over the line. In this moment he has no idea why he is friends with such a bastard.
And he’s all too happy to move on when Malfoy moves his hand up a little to fiddle with his waistband. Yeah, Harry is most certainly on board for that. Malfoy snaps it back a couple of times, teasing. Really teasing. And Harry’s tempted to reach out and pull them down himself. But he’s not sure if he can. He’s never touched Malfoy in the dreams before. He supposes he’s never spoken before until this time either.
Draco knew he was very junior still, but he felt a strong sense of pride and importance in his position. After just a year and a half of training, he was already in placement as a Healer at St Mungo’s. Yes, he had Healer Gibbons supervising him constantly but she usually didn’t interfere and allowed Draco to work with minimal guidance.
Draco had been frustrated about not understanding his History of Magic homework and too embarrassed to ask anyone else for help. He found himself up late the night before it was due, pacing the common room, trying to work himself out of the mess his own pride had created. Eventually he’d grown tired with the Slytherin dorm and ventured out into the castle, despite it being after hours. He figured he could always drop his name if a teacher found him. He knew his father could be very influential when he wanted to be.
Harry doesn’t say anything, letting Ron get comfortable in his bed. He resigns himself not to ask where Ron has been because he already has a very clear suspicion that he certainly feels better about
But those words didn’t just come naturally out of his mouth like they obviously did Potter’s. “Come on, do I have to talk like this?”
“I also cast a targeted Homenum Revelio charm so any additional human presence will be noted regardless,” Hermione reminds Harry in a clipped voice. He knows that voice – she’s getting impatient with him. “And I
Draco considered it. Potter came naturally to him. Harry seemed too intimate. Too forward. Too friendly. It made him think. "Why?”
“It got you thinking though, didn’t it?” Pansy said unashamedly with a suggestive wiggle of her eyebrows.
“I see, then why didn’t you put a stop to this like I asked you?” Malfoy holds up a battered newspaper with a hole burnt through the middle, but Harry can still make out the headline.
“I’ve been testing some vision-enhancing spells to help with training,” Potter explains as he places the glasses on. “Most of them don’t last very long so I’m usually walking around with – Malfoy!” Potter shouts having finally looked up over at Draco. “You’re…I mean you look…are you…”
“If you just went to the hospital they’d probably–” Harry’s voice falters as Malfoy takes hold of Harry’s hand, removing it from his shoulder and sliding it down to his waist.
Now we get to the good bit. Or the bad bit. Or the part were Harry realises he is well and truly fucked. Or that he’d liked to be well and truly fucked by a particular unnamed person. Well, we all know who it is, so he can drop the pretense. Draco Fucking Malfoy. Or Fucking Draco Malfoy. Or Draco Malfoy, fuck. Any way that combines fucking with Draco Malfoy will do for Harry. Yes, fucked is the right word for it.
And now Harry was certain he wasn’t imagining it – Malfoy’s eyes lit up at the order. “But what if – “
“Teddy? Ted? Are you hurt?” Draco’s voice was high pitched and panicked, like it always became at the smallest injury. Harry couldn’t give himself a papercut without getting the full healer treatment from Draco. Not that he minded.
Draco cuts him off with a sad laugh. He closes his eyes and presses his face further into Harry’s hand. “Please, Harry. You’re forgetting how I really am. I’m cruel and arrogant. I treat you terribly to hide my real feelings.” He opens his eyes. “It won’t mean anything coming from me now. But when I’m whole, please make sure I’ve apologised before you let me do this.”
When Malfoy finally returned to the ground and headed to the locker rooms, his team had already long showered, leaving the Slytherin locker room to him alone. Harry followed him in.
“No dear, he’s leaving with Percy today. They’re waiting on someone, a new Minister I believe– is this a new look then? Please tell me you didn’t use a potion. The charm never truly fades, you know.”
“I’m not anxious,” Malfoy said quickly. When Harry looked over he was wiping his hands on his trousers.
He grabs some more floo and enters the fireplace, following Draco – no, it’s probably Malfoy again now – to Hogwarts. He hardly feels the pain as his body hurtles through the floo system, his untucked elbows hitting an assortment of chimney interiors on the way.
“This is a serious investigation, Harry. You’re not back in sixth year stalking Draco Malfoy again.”
And that word is “Potter.” Although when it comes out of Malfoy’s mouth, it seems to have more than just the usual two syllables.
“I think you’re safe there,” Potter finally says, and when Draco removes his gaze from Potter’s ridiculous apron it’s too find Potter looking directly at him, not Pepper. Draco feels rather dizzy all at once. Must be something to with Potter’s eyes on him. His hand finds purchase on the counter behind but he keeps his face expressionless to save Potter from reading into it too much, as he knows Pansy would.
Now, three years later, Draco was his husband, and another father to Teddy. And Harry was absolutely and completely in love with him.
Draco looked around the class, only just now taking in how close everyone was. There were students directly in front of them. If Draco leaned forward, he could touch the back of Susan Bone’s head. And Potter was just going to suck him off. Right here and now.
Like that time when Draco dropped Teddy off at Harry’s office in the middle of a work day because he had an appointment, and Harry said, “Of course, no problem Draco. Please take your time,” but what he’d really wanted to say was, “You couldn’t have given me some warning so I could plan my day around this, you inconsiderate prat?”
Fuck it. Draco was horny as hell, and he wanted to touch himself, Harry’s eyes be damned. He let his hormones overpower his nerves just this once and quickly unzipped his trousers.
Draco hadn’t realised he’d said those words aloud until Harry laughed. And wasn’t that just awful? Because Draco had to be assaulted by the utter perfection that was Harry Potter in all his senses. And he knew he was a goner.
He dropped his arm and turned to face Malfoy, the realisation of what had happened dawning. “You just made that up to distract me!”
Draco panicked okay? It’s not as if he has an endless number of friends he can call upon. The stupid doctor had made him agree to a compulsion charm. If he misses a dinner, he will be forced to walk right into hospital and check himself in. And he is in no mood to see his mother. So, he scrambled his brains to think of someone who would agree to meet him, at very short notice, and the only person he could think of noble and stupid enough was Potter. Harry fucking Potter. And he was right. The boy who lived had said yes.
He shouldn’t be confronting anyone during a full moon, even in the day, but he can hardly wait any longer. He promised to protect Malfoy and if he can’t be present at night to do that, he can certainly make quick work of the problem now.
“The worst person ever,” Draco said instead, realising immediately afterwards that he sounded like a petulant child. Great. Thanks November third.
Malfoy walks around and finally comes into view, his face screwed up something nasty. It’s so unfamiliar to Harry after spending weeks adjusting to seeing a smile on that same face. And so fucking confusing.
Harry watches his wand where it hangs loosely from Malfoy’s fingers at eye level. Maybe if he’s fast enough, he can lunge forward and snatch it back before – but Malfoy clearly sees where his attention is and raises the wand above his head, teasingly. “Oh yes, thanks for the wand too. That’s really all I needed you for, actually. The reckless no-questions-asked rescue, and the easily obtained wand. I promise when I use it, I’ll think of you.” He lowers the wand to target Harry, his smirk unwavering.
choose, Draco, you’re just too scared too.” Hermione stood up and the bed felt too light, empty. “I can’t do all the work for you. Think it over and if you want, I can bring Harry back here in the morning.”
Malfoy recoils at the suggestion but doesn’t meet Harry’s eye. “It’s nothing like that. I’ll just need you to sit with me at mealtimes, and walk me to classes, and escort me to my dorm each night.”
Harry starts to follow her, scrunching up his invisibility cloak to fit in his school bag as he does. He has an idea. A rather clever idea. And he should really have thought of it earlier. He pauses. “You guys go ahead, I want to check something.”
“Have you not seen my arm, Potter?” Interrupted Draco before he could be guilt-tripped - that was Potter’s speciality. “I was
“Oh. I’m Draco,” he said, his voice taking on an endearing squeaky quality. He finally took Harry’s hand in a firm shake. “Your soulmate.”
He doesn’t have to wait long. “Wait.” Harry smiles, as Malfoy hurries to catch up. “Potter, wait.” Harry stops in his tracks and turns to Malfoy whose eyes are focused on Harry’s feet. “I
going for me, I can assure you, Potter.” Draco can’t help but be cheeky in his reply. Seeing Potter seems to pull out an embarrassingly flirty side of him. “Don’t you worry your precious little head about what that means.” He looks over to Potter and is pleased to see a hint of colour in his face.
Please, Potter. A house-elf is harder to fool.”  Malfoy laughs again, the sound wrapping itself around Harry just like dark smoke, inescapable.
“My wand, Potter,” Draco says through gritted teeth, not looking directly into Harry’s eyes, instead somewhere near the centre of his nose.
“If I -? What the hell?” Zabini scowls at Harry, looking like he might grab him again – Harry shuffles a further half a step backwards – before turning back to Malfoy. “You know what? I don’t care what’s wrong with you. If you’d rather hang out with Harry Potter and the whole Gryffindor gang, fine. But don’t expect me to join you. It’s
“That’s one of my aims, sure.” Malfoy licked his lips – Harry tried not to look like he’d noticed. “But I’m also trying to work out how to get the famous Harry Potter into my bed. The two tasks aren’t mutually exclusive, you see.”
Potter walked past Draco without so much as a glance, heading straight for the counter near the back of the cafe. It gave Draco time to think. Potter would surely see him when he left if he was getting takeaway - or worse, if he were to dine in, he might end up at a table close to Draco, and then Draco would be forced to acknowledge him out of sheer politeness.
Draco dropped to his seat immediately. It was the first time since Draco had been working for him that Harry had actually given him such a direct order. A shiver ran up Draco’s spine.
Mr Weasley dusted the ash from his shoulders. ‘Well– ah– you see– I’ve just been speaking with the new Minister via floo call and– how do I put this?– he’s in a similar predicament.”
Harry looked away – he was starting to feel dizzy with that gaze directed at him. “You’ve been getting chummy with Pansy and Blaise all night.”
“What the fuck, Malfoy?” Harry had been having a delightful dream in which Malfoy – although he was known to Harry as Draco in the dream – had confessed his affections to Harry and asked him to ride on a unicorn with him into space.
Potter’s of course. After that, he figured there was no harm in staying around for just a little longer. Besides, the more he sucked Potter’s cock, the
If Potter notices that Draco’s fish only swims back and forth around his plate and never reaches his mouth, and he must notice, he keeps his mouth shut. Which is a relief. Because Draco can’t imagine forcing something so slimy down his throat. It’s repulsive.
Pansy’s voice has started to rise, and Draco is worried some of the greasy pub patrons might overhear. He leans into Pansy. His body sways on his stool slightly which Pansy’s hawk eyes don’t fail to notice. He grips onto the bar with white knuckles and continues regardless.
Harry watches Hermione’s notetaking with a strange distance. He had almost forgotten Malfoy was a case and not…not…He stops himself from thinking anything further. "Malfoy says it’s under control,” he says.
“Oh right,” Potter says, his tone changing completely. ”Sorry. I didn’t mean it like that, I was just…er…I meant it…um…playfully?”
Harry considers Zabini. Although Harry doesn’t fancy facing him in a physical battle, he’s sure he can best him in a duel…if only he can get to his wand first. Zabini hasn’t yet pulled out his wand, which is a relief, but he is standing very close. It will be very easy for him to throw a punch as soon as Harry makes any sudden movements. Harry remains still.
Draco returned his gaze to Potter - he was attacking his champagne glass with very little sophistication, downing it as if it might have been a shot glass. A strand of Potter’s hair broke loose from his charms, sticking up from his head in an endearing fashion. Draco waited patiently for Potter to finish, taking a small sip of his own glass.
Harry wants to ask but the warning expression on Draco’s face causes his voice to falter. He remains silent as he follows Draco into the next room. Harry continues to watch silently as Draco searches the room for floo powder, his demeanor becoming more and more frantic as he does.
“Let me try,” Harry said. “I know there’s something you’re hiding. You don’t have to deal with it alone.”
At the doors to the Great Hall, Malfoy pauses and takes an audible breath. Harry waits patiently. No matter his personal beef with Malfoy, he doesn’t envy him this.
Malfoy’s face went bright red. “You – you  - urgh.” He threw his arms up in the air in frustration and continued his stomping.
. How dare Potter kiss Draco like that? How dare Potter kiss him so tenderly, and sweetly, as if he really was in love. Did he think he could trick the magic by pretending, by playing domestic with the horrible Death Eater he hated? All it did was piss Draco off.
So, this is how Harry finds himself. Jerking himself off, underneath Draco Malfoy…who is also jerking himself off. It’s strange. Harry feels like maybe he should perhaps reach a hand up and swap hands with Malfoy, but then there’s also something hot about just getting off in front of each other as well. Also, Harry’s too nervous to make any more moves, so there’s that too. But while he’s thinking about this, he’s losing the opportunity to just enjoy the moment. And fucking praise Merlin, Harry is very much enjoying being underneath Malfoy. It is just great. Well that sounds sarcastic, but it’s truly not. Being underneath Malfoy is great. The greatest even. And yeah, Harry is appreciating it all right now.
Harry knew Malfoy had a particularly charming face – he had spent the better part of an hour worshipping it with kisses – but it didn’t make sense for the whole room to suddenly find the same appreciation. Harry turned to Malfoy in confusion and all became clear.
“Once we have confirmation werewolves are visiting him, then we’ll investigate further. But not before he’s given us reason to.”
“Now we’re both embarrassed,” Draco says leaning his head on his hands, his elbows resting on the table. He’d forgotten how things with Potter were like: utterly exhausting. He could run a marathon and still have more energy left than this.
He slumped against the wall beside Potter, giving his legs some support, letting his breathing fall back into place. Potter, red lips, wild hair, tilted his head to look at Draco and, okay, perhaps that sent a very specific feeling to Draco’s cock, but it was also warmth, and, Draco felt sappy writing it, love.
“Wow,” Pansy deadpanned. “That’s so strange. It’s almost like you go to school and talk to the same people every day.”
sick,” Draco attempted half-heartedly, inspecting the apple. It had a bruise. He placed it on his nightstand. He wasn’t
It might have been the firewhisky talking – who was Harry kidding? – but Malfoy’s gaze was hypnotic. Harry chuckled weakly.
Draco didn’t hesitate. There was one question that sprung to his mind immediately. One that had been ricocheting around in his head since the start of the school year. "Why’d you turn my friendship down?”
Harry had stopped breathing. His heart felt like it was beating somewhere in the vicinity of his stomach and there was a numbness spreading across his skin. He couldn’t feel it anymore but he suspected his face was a deep red.
Harry turns back to Malfoy. His confusion must show on his face because Malfoy sighs as if dealing with a child and explains. “You’ve just nominated yourself as my dueling partner, Potter,
“Or a partner,” Ron finally amends. “Hermione and I have been dating for almost six months now. If we don’t
drive, to dinner. You can pick the restaurant but please make sure it is an establishment with real silverware and tablecloths. We will enter the party together, arms linked, to make our courtship known, and we will leave separately to avoid a scandal.”
Malfoy looks suspicious but turns back around all the same. Harry takes a deep breath. Maybe this is a stupid idea. He keeps the dittany bottle in his right hand (ignoring how it shakes) and brings his other hand up to Malfoy’s left shoulder. He tries not to notice how smooth Malfoy’s skin is as he gently brushes his hand over it, holding his breath as he waits for Malfoy’s reaction.
Blaise looked as polished as ever, from his tailored paisley suit to his immaculately applied eyebrow liner. He returned Draco’s smile, flashing his surgically whitened teeth. “I could hardly miss the event of the season now, could I, Draco?”
“I – you – I – “ Harry could only splutter pathetically. This was Draco Malfoy. His professed arch-enemy. True, they had been rather civil this year, but that didn’t negate seven years of fighting. Malfoy’s words didn’t make any sense. The distraction was logical enough, but why continue flirting?
“You really were amazing today,” Draco said, pulling away from the kiss. “I could hardly focus on the snitch.”
It tastes of metal and rust, so distinct from their previous tender kisses stolen behind tapestries, in the Quidditch locker room or beneath Harry’s Invisibility Cloak. Yet, it has been a long time since a kiss with Draco Malfoy felt quite like this – as if all the energy he expends into it is given back to him twofold.
Now that he had Potter’s blessing, more or less, he had to make everything perfect. After all, Potter would want to see the finished product. And Draco already knew that once he did, Potter would know exactly how Draco felt about him. How could he not when Draco channelled all of his emotions into his paintings? When every stroke of his brush that coloured Potter’s face was a gentle caress? It would be obvious to anyone.
“ARTHUR,” Mrs Weasley bellowed, setting a heaped plate of eggs, bacon, pancake and sausages in front of Harry. “Sit down and eat, dear,” she said in a soft voice before calling out again. “ARTHUR.”
“There’s only one of me now, Granger,” snaps Draco from his cage, his voice cracking as if he hasn’t spoken in some time. “I thought you were supposed to be intelligent.”
“It’s your favourite, isn’t it? And I’m thinking maybe when you’re a bit better, I could make you apple pie. Or something with applesauce? Do you like that? Or, I know it sounds weird, but Hermione makes this really great apple and walnut salad. And maybe this is a little childish, but I’ve always wanted to make candied – “
Somehow Potter had gotten it into his head that he could lead. He took Draco’s hand with one of his and placed the other on the arch of Draco’s back - which seemed far too low for any ballroom dance style. Then Potter starting waltzing.
Fuck. He sucks in a breath and tries to concentrate, reading the textbook carefully now, before adding the Flobberworm mucus to his cauldron. He starts on the spleen, looking over to find Draco watching his actions cautiously. There’s a comfort in having Draco’s eyes monitoring him. He clears his throat.
Potter blinked back at Draco for a moment, his amused expression finally dropping. His eyes circled the room quickly and then returned to Draco. “You don’t think you’re that important?” he asked softly.
Harry understood although he immediately wished he didn’t. He laughed nervously. “I think he wants us to make out.”
Parkinson smiled wickedly and moved onto the next person. Harry felt sick. He should have walked away, but he was curious about Malfoy. Ron rubbed his shoulder.
He moves to check on Malfoy but in his hesitation, he has underestimated his dueling partner. In less than a few seconds, his wand lurches out of his hand, and he is forced to the ground, red ropes of smoke twisting around his body and holding him in place. He has lost.
Harry’s hands went for Draco’s shirt buttons first, lifting the stakes.  Draco hadn’t realised they were heading for his fantasy until that moment. A kiss was one thing but fucking -  as much as Draco fantasised about it, he suddenly felt nervous. He brought his hands up to stop Harry’s.
“I don’t know what you’ve done to me, Potter, but I’m not having a bar of it.” Draco pushed past Potter and made his own dramatic exit before Potter could continue his.
“With what curse?” Draco’s eyes were piercing and analytical, giving Harry the odd sensation that Draco already knew exactly what he was thinking. But he couldn’t. Or they wouldn’t be having this conversation at all.
The address is a muggle warehouse just outside of London. There’s no sign of activity outside but Harry isn’t dissuaded. Wizards are well-versed in covering their tracks. He throws on his invisibility cloak and scouts for an entrance.
Pansy sat on the foot of Draco’s bed - forcing Draco to pull his legs up to his chin or be squashed. “If you were sick, we would all know it. Last time you had a cold, you said you were dying.”
, in my head, so I kept as far away from him in the Manor as I could. I was being selfish again.” Draco shakes his head. “If I had stayed with him, then he wouldn’t have got away, he wouldn’t have tried to hurt you.”
“I don’t know. He trailed off. But it was as if he’d lost something. Maybe he was referencing whatever has separated from him?” Harry suggests. Merlin, they’re grasping now. Harry had been so excited about finally solving this mystery but now he only has more questions.
“No, you can’t,” Draco countered, already hating the snotty tone he was developing but pressing on regardless. “You’re getting paid to serve drinks and treat the affluent guests as if they’re more important than they are.”
“Do I?” Draco asked, observing a trainee healer grinding up against a senior member of the Wizengamot with distaste.
“Of course I love him too. That’s why I have to leave. He deserves someone better.” Draco avoids Harry’s eyes, staring down at Ron’s feet. “Someone good.”
Draco kisses him and the Great Hall cheers. Someone pats Harry on the back, another ruffles his hair, but his only focus is Draco Malfoy. After years of only pretending their relationship was possible, it finally is. There’s nothing and nobody left in their way. And every single person in the Great Hall knows.
Draco paced the castle restlessly. He knew it was silly and completely pointless, but he was searching as he went, as if Potter would just be strolling down the corridor like any other year. It was as he was pacing the seventh floor when he heard someone behind him. Before he could turn around to face the person he hoped was Potter, a jolt hit him square in the back sending him face forward into the floor.
The Malfoy at Harry’s office door – the real one – didn’t move. His eyes flickered down to Harry's desk, watching the spill unfold passively.
“I thought so,” Harry said quietly, even though Draco hadn’t said anything. His silence was clearly answer enough.
Draco’s wand fell to the floor and he ran the small distance across the room to Harry, enveloping him in an impressively warm hug. Harry’s face was still cold from the icy wind outside and he gladly pressed it up against Draco’s chest - he’d been right about the D on the sweater.
Malfoy summons another row of vials, guiding them past Harry with a wide patronising berth. “It doesn’t serve my interests.”
“But it’s dangerous,” Malfoy interrupts with a smirk. “I wouldn’t recommend it to an innocent like you.”
Draco thought donation was rather a strong word. In reality, all the rich guests had paid to attend an important social event. The fact that the proceeds went to charity was an added ego boost. This event wasn’t about doing good for the sake of doing good but maintaining status. It was all a terrible charade and Draco had wanted no part of it, but of course, his mother had insisted. So, he’d paid for his ticket and out of spite, had used his mother’s money to donate another hundred grand to the cause on top of that. She hadn't been pleased when she found out.
“I didn’t get to enjoy this earlier. So we’re going to have one perfect dance before I take you back to my house and we fuck.”
Harry rolls his eyes. There was always a reason! But he’s not going to argue now that he’s been given the opportunity. He hurriedly races to the fourth-floor, pulling on his cloak as he does. Class only just let up, so he should be able to get there at the same time as Malfoy if he moves fast.
by association. He wonders if Potter is doing this just to spite him but when he looks over to Potter, he remembers he isn’t the spiteful type. Poor Potter looks dreadfully uncomfortable, his posture stiff and his eyes resolutely glued to the table.
Malfoy disappeared into the Manor and appeared minutes later, two glasses of firewhiskey in hand. He passed one to Harry and then took a seat on the armchair opposite, crossing his legs demurely – which was a necessity in his getup.
Malfoy must have been particularly eager to meet his soulmate in order to seek out a Soulmate Finder. They were notoriously difficult to find and ridiculously expensive - the practice wasn’t illegal but certainly frowned upon - traditionalists argued soulmates should always be found “naturally”. He didn’t go to all that trouble just for Harry to walk out on him.
He doesn’t bother to dwell on the consequences any further and Apparates directly to Malfoy Manor. The gates are already open. And when he walks up to the door, it opens immediately to reveal a grave looking Malfoy.
Harry shivered. “I should go,” he suggested again. He was starting to feel a little light headed and he hadn’t even been drinking.
It wasn’t until Draco found himself alone on the couch with Potter that he finally had a reason to laugh.
The details were a little fuzzy after that. Luckily Draco remembered that they had politely agreed on a restaurant near the auror offices where Harry was in-training so they could meet straight after, but he wasn’t so clear on the time. And he couldn’t quite remember how they finished the phone call…
Harry knocks again, louder. “You’re going to miss breakfast,” he yells into the door. “You should know at the Gryffindor table we always make the last person there chug a bottle of Veritaserum and spill–”
Great, Potter. Now I have to apologise just to prove you wrong. I am not a prick. And I am sorry for any supposed “bullying”.
“Language, Ginny!” called out Molly Weasley from downstairs. She had a way of sensing curse words even if you were at opposite ends of the house.
This time it was Hermione who interrupted. “It’s Harry’s fault for only bringing spiced firewhisky anyway. He should help,” she said, sharing a smile with Pansy.
Now, after the incident with Malfoy, Harry can’t imagine brewing potions will ever relax him again. Guilt taints all his thoughts, and with no answers from Madam Pomfrey, he has no idea what he is even guilty for.
It had taken some time to convince them. Ron couldn’t stop laughing long enough to have a conversation and Hermione insisted Harry simply tell Draco how he felt. Like it was that easy. Like he hadn’t already revealed enough by asking Draco out for dinner.
Draco didn’t appreciate the implication. “Of course I know what it is.” He paused, taking a sip of his coffee to give himself time to remember the name they had told him in his course and -
“There’s nothing to talk about,” Draco says through gritted teeth. He’s stirring his Potion clockwise with his wand now. Harry quickly goes to follow, picking up his own wand. Draco’s hand stops him.
“Sure,” Malfoy finally said. “A meeting with Harry Potter on my first day in office. That’ll give the pureblood elitists something to sweat over.”
the work – and pulled his hands up onto the table to lift himself up a little. In the process, he accidentally knocked his Potions textbook to the floor with a loud ka-plunk, but he wasn’t particularly concerned; his only thoughts were of Draco and how those lips would feel against his. Would there be sparks? Electricity? Heat? He was feeling all those things in his body just from the anticipation alone so he knew it had to be something more.
“I accept your dare, Malfoy,” Harry said loudly, his voice more confident than he really felt. “Go on.”
“Don’t apologise,” Harry said gently, pulling Draco’s head up by his chin to fix him with that piercing stare Draco always dreamt about. “We can just make out if you want, or -“ there was a faint blush on Harry’s cheeks - “are there any other less physical fantasies you have?”
Slughorn must sense this as he shakes his head at Harry as he takes a seat behind his desk. “I can’t tell you much.”
Explaining everything to Hermione and Ron gives Harry much greater comfort than he could have anticipated. Just from sharing the weight of the knowledge with his friends, Harry already knows he might finally get some sleep tonight.
, and certainly not directed at him. The most frustrating thing is that nobody else seems to notice.
Both Draco Malfoy’s drink at once, their throats swallowing in unison. At first nothing happens. Harry stares into the cage, waiting, eyes switching between each Draco but lingering the longest on
‘Is that – is this why – “ Harry stopped and sat on the bed, his eyes never leaving Draco’s face. And then: “Draco, you’re beautiful.”
Harry couldn’t think. His mind was a jigsaw and he only ever had access to one puzzle piece at a time. Right now, he just wanted to feel the electricity again. He dropped to his knees and pulled at Draco’s trousers.
Harry walks away, feeling Malfoy’s eyes still on him. A number of distracting thoughts run through his head but he focuses himself on one. Malfoy is about to floo away.  And Harry is going to miss where.
“That you need a drink?” Malfoy tried lightly, gesturing with the glass he still held out for Potter.
“Yes please, Dobby,” he said politely dropping into the chair across from Potter’s, although knowing Potter, the golden boy probably wouldn’t be impressed unless he made his own tea. Well, stuff it. Potter was just too bloody hard to please.
“How many people would gladly provide information against Malfoy?” Harry interrupts. It’s not the first time a civilian has made false claims. And it won’t be the last. “An anonymous tip-off is hardly–”
“I’m not trying to prove anything. I’m genuinely worried about you. How can you think I don’t care at all after what happened last–”
Harry drops onto the couch with a polite smile but as soon as Verity leaves, he stands up again and begins pacing the room.
Harry recognised the voice instantly but he still held his breath as Percy stepped back and the new Minister walked into the house. He’d traded in green robes for sleek black ones and his trademark hair was hidden under a tight black beret but those grey eyes and pointy chin were unmistakeable.
A week passed. Harry didn’t want to spoil Draco’s surprise and hint that he had seen the box, but he was desperate to give him a little nudge. He didn’t care about anything romantic. He’d be quite alright with Draco casually popping the question in the bathroom as they brushed their teeth in their twin sinks.
“I know that face,” Malfoy said slowly, his face breaking into a disbelieving smile. “You’re going to kiss me.”
Malfoy’s face leaned in, his lips moving closer and closer to Harry’s, his breath warm on Harry’s mouth. Harry closed his eyes, waiting for the inevitable kiss. He already knew Malfoy’s lips would be soft.
Malfoy laughs, then his mouth twists into an amused smirk. “That’s a new one, at least. What reason? Because of
“But you’re - you. Harry Potter. And I’m me. It doesn’t make sense that you’d want me outside of…whatever this is.”
The Weasleys parted and there was Harry, as frustratingly gorgeous as always, staring at Draco as if, as if he really did like him. Shit. Draco was already blushing.
curious as to the location of the Gryffindor Common Room (for the purpose of pranks of course) and found his feet simply took him in that direction. He didn’t find it of course. Just a number of endless long hallways that all looked the same bar the tall portraits that hung on the walls. One of the portraits - a lady in a hideously pink dress - had even tried to tell him off for roaming after hours. He had only walked faster.
“Do you think that maybe we just had the timing wrong?” Draco finally continues his earlier thought, still not looking at Harry. “That we weren’t supposed to be together until…until now.”
Draco looked away but he could just feel her staring at him with that horrible knowing smile. “I hate you.”
Harry follows his eyes and the sense of off-ness to Malfoy today clicks into place. “The spell faded,” he says, noting the red and gold colours of the tie wrapped around Malfoy’s neck.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows and snatched the bottle back. “I’m clearly wasting my material here. That was a joke. You know what a joke is right?”
Draco turned back to Teddy. “Maybe our Quidditch superstar is finished for the day, hey Ted? Are you hungry? Shall we head in for dinner?"
“You’re not - are you actually - what are you doing?” He couldn’t tell if Potter was having him on or not.
An agitated sound somewhere between a sign and a scream escapes from Malfoy’s mouth, his behaviour bordering on frantic. “It’s disgusting how you
That was all it took for Draco’s own orgasm to start, the residual panting from Potter egging him on, Potter’s eyes challenging him, daring him to - and
“Do you know any other way?” Narcissa asks in a tired drawl that reminds Harry of Draco. Before any of this happened. Back when he was still Malfoy. And Harry was still Potter.
Harry recognises Ron’s voice behind him, quickly followed by Hermione’s. His eyes had been so focused on the two Draco Malfoy’s, he hadn’t even noticed that they had disappeared and clearly found their way around the shelving to surprise Malfoy from behind.
Malfoy snorts. “No, shit, Potter. Why don’t you–” Harry applies the first drop to the lower most part of the cut. “Oh FUCK.” Malfoy’s head whips around to Potter as the cut begins to close. “What are you–”
On Friday, Harry is ready. As soon as Malfoy gets up after their final class of the day, he is on his feet too. When Malfoy hurries from the room, Harry is hot on his heels. Just as Harry suspected, Malfoy does not head down to the Slytherin common room but takes a different route. Harry follows up stairs, around corridors, down stairs again, out into a courtyard, back down another corridor, upstairs again, until finally Malfoy pauses. Although, unfortunately, it isn’t because he has reached his destination. He turns around. Harry watches from behind a pillar as Malfoy looks about, trying to keep his breathing quiet.
“Is Malfoy okay?” Harry interrupts. He can’t bear the not knowing. Especially when it’s because of his fuck-up.
“For now, we’re magically feeding you, making sure you get all the nutrients your body needs. But you need to relearn how to eat on your own as well. Get rid of bad, destructive habits. I’m not going to ask you to do anything until you’re in a stronger state, but I’d like you to start thinking about a food you enjoy, maybe an old favourite food. Something that might get you to start to think positively about eating again. Can you do that?”
rather good at giving hickeys,” Potter announced in a loud voice, drawing some of the attention away from Draco. “And blowjobs too,” he added staring right at Draco. Oh
Potter’s hand closed around the snitch – close enough that Draco could have leaned forward and snatched it up himself – and a low hissing sound escaped his mouth. Draco felt the sound in his entire body.
” Madam Pomfrey’s voice rises uncharacteristically. “And you still let the potion be stirred anti-clockwise overnight?”
useful. But it’s all books and knick-knacks, objects now meaningless after years of being hidden. He’s surprised the fiendfyre didn’t destroy everything last year.
. Doesn’t mean they won’t help a student with her extra credit assignment on the properties of asphodel root.” Hermione’s obviously still mad at him but she smiles regardless, clearly pleased at her own plan.
Hesitating only a second longer, Ron gives Hermione a brief kiss, passes over the Marauder’s Map to Harry – who takes it automatically – and heads off down the corridor, with one last glance at Malfoy. As he disappears around the corner, a heavy silence takes hold.
Potter mimed locking up his lips and throwing away the key - very unoriginal but Draco found it charming all the same. Potter could do anything really and Draco would be charmed. That was the problem. For no one else would he get on his knees after such a shameless request for a blowjob.
“New rule,” Parkinson announced. “All dares, unless specified otherwise, must be completed in this room.”
Malfoy stepped into Harry and brought his lips to Harry’s ear. “And. What. Are. You. Going. To. Do. About. It?”
“You’re going to get one every year now, you know?” Harry said - both teasingly and fondly - it was often that way with Draco. “You’re part of the family.”
One of these days, when his horniness wasn’t clouding his mind, Draco was going to murder Harry Potter. But for now, he could only surrender to Potter’s infuriating desire to embarrass him. “I am."
Harry wants to interrogate the insufferable bastard further. How dare he bring Teddy into this, his own cousin? How dare he sit there smugly, not caring that Harry knows he’s lying? Harry’s ready for a duel, whether it be of words or wands, when a double tap on his shoulder from Hermione changes his course. He steels himself and wraps his questioning up.
Hermione holds out an arm to hold Ron back, who looks like he might deck Draco. After a reassuring nod from Madam Pomfrey and an unhelpful shrug from Slughorn, she takes down the cage with a simple wave of her wand.
Draco cast a tempus charm just before midnight. He didn’t quite know what would happen if he stayed beside Potter all the way into November fourth, but he wasn’t keen to find out. It couldn’t be good. Without the day guiding them, Potter and Draco were only enemies. And enemies didn’t stargaze together.
“I was going to say cheating,” Draco finally managed, hoping Potter wouldn’t notice his slight wince at the word. “It’s cheating,” he repeated, with a little more conviction.
He closed his eyes as their lips grew closer and braced himself for the impending magic. And sure enough, when his lips met Draco’s, it was an instant flash of magical energy. He’d never felt so charged in his life. But it only lasted a second. Because as soon as their lips met, they were ripped apart.
Harry glanced at the ruined cupcake briefly before his eyes returned to Malfoy’s hair. “You look like a Weasley."
Harry takes a step backwards. “It was going to be a vision improving potion but it’s not finished yet. I changed the ingredients a little so I don’t know how it–”
Although, there was far more to worry about than just his dress robes. Potter had been particularly cold lately when Draco had run into him at the Ministry. Draco was sometimes lucky enough to be acknowledged with a clipped “Healer Malfoy” and a curt nod, but other times he was completely ignored. Despite nothing usually happening outside of November third, Potter had never been
Potter wasn’t looking at Draco - he was facing the front of the classroom, pretending to pay attention - although he clearly wasn’t because there was a scandalously cheeky smile on his face. Good grief, Potter.
He’s been on their watch-list for some time but only ever as a precaution. The baby Death Eater, everyone calls him. Except for Harry. He can only ever be Malfoy in Harry’s head.
going to kiss me, weren’t you?” Malfoy dropped his gaze to the floor. “Oh fuck. It’s just you were so close–“
“Just play along,” Harry whispers back. To Snape, he smiles politely in the way that usually gets him what he wants from professors, even if it leaves him feeling icky after. “We asked Professor Slughorn for some Potions assistance,
, he had, it certainly didn’t include Potter sleeping on a bundle of pillows on Draco’s bedroom floor, fully clothed. And Draco tucked up alone in his king bed, also fully clothed.
But he’s getting ahead of himself. The dream. Yes, the dream. How to describe the dream? At first everything is dark and Harry isn’t paying too much attention, his sleeping mind drifting from one unconscious thought to the next, and then a small light catches Harry’s eye – or his mind’s eye he supposes as this is all happening in his head – so he walks towards it – or mind glides or whatever the equivalent is. Okay, you get it.
“Into what?” Harry asks, curious. He didn’t think he would be getting more information out of Blaise Zabini than the actual teachers attending to Malfoy but he isn’t about to complain.
Harry read the article again. He didn't know why he put himself through it. Rita Skeeter’s outlandish claims never failed to make him angry. And he'd already forced The Daily Prophet to run a redaction days ago.
came their way). It was light and high-pitched (the laugh, not the shhh), and nothing like Harry expected Draco’s genuine laugh to sound like. He had never heard it before.
“Of course, sir, of course,” The maître de says with a partial bow. As soon as he turns away, Potter’s fake smile drops.
Draco laughed. That’s what was bothering Harry? Perhaps he finally needed to be told the truth. Enough was enough. “Bones can’t concentrate on what you’re saying because she’s drooling over your physique and wants to
The wolf wants to growl in response but Harry’s in full control now. He frowns at Hermione instead. “I didn’t hurt him. And if I had, he deserved it.”
Kingsley won’t stand for this kind of prejudice in the Ministry. He’ll be able to do far more with words than Harry can with his wand. At least that’s what Harry tells himself as he walks away, slipping a hand into his pocket just to clench a hand over his wand.
“I see, was I too dramatic? Did you prefer someone who wouldn't steal your spotlight? Who would stand behind you like an obedient little house-elf?”
Malfoy doesn’t even seem to notice as the last of the wound closes over. He’s rutting himself up against Harry’s hand while the most inappropriate sounds continue to fall from his lips. Harry isn’t even aware he’s dropped the dittany bottle until his right hand is already on Malfoy’s hip and he hears the tell-tale crash of glass on the floor.
“Your wish is my command,” Draco whispered into Harry’s ear, lips so close they brushed against his skin and he could feel the warmth of Draco’s breath. That alone was enough to make Harry shiver, but followed by frenzied kisses, sucking and grazing against the side of Harry’s neck, it lit Harry on
Potter grins. He’s wearing a full body apron with moving obscene words on it. Draco takes it in as Potter replies. “Jealous?”
Harry looked up at Malfoy and almost dribbled the firewhisky back into his cup. Malfoy had crossed his legs over and perched his head on his arms, staring down at Harry intently across the circle. Harry quickly composed himself and swallowed.
POTTER. Must you be so vulgar? How can you put your splotchy quill to parchment and actually write something like that down?
These days, they saw a lot of each other. Teddy made sure of that. They hadn’t quite reconciled all their differences, but they were civil, even polite to each other. They had to be for Teddy. But there was such a coldness to their interactions sometimes, that Harry wondered if it would be better if they just went at it, like they really wanted to. Said what they were really thinking.
“Yeah,” Draco said with a shrug as if hadn’t been to every match of the year so far. Well, except the one time Potter had been off sick. He really didn’t see the entertainment in watching anyone else kick a ball around.
Harry doesn’t see any point in denying it. He holds his glasses away from his face while he rubs his eyes – anything to avoid eye contact. “Yes.”
Hermione nods, dashing back to her desk to take notes. She starts jotting things down, ignoring Harry, and Harry thinks perhaps he’s off the hook when she looks back up sharply.
, with Harry Potter. Who would’ve thought? Once again, Draco arrives first and sits awaiting Potter. Usually Draco would be rather miffed at having to wait. Usually people are having to wait for him. But Potter is coming straight from work to see him, so he supposes he can make an exception for his irritation. That and he is excited to see Potter. And it’s hard to be irritated at the same time.
Harry looked up from his Potions textbook to find Malfoy standing over him. He’d been trying to get in a bit of quiet study in the common room before retiring for the night but now it looked like that would be impossible.
"I, Amelia Bones, Head of the Department for Magical Law Enforcement, hereby declare the hearing in the Case of Draco Malfoy against Lucius Malfoy on the 20th of August open!" She said in a firm Voice.
"Of course, of course, tea and cookies coming right up!" and she turned around an busied herself with the cookiemaking again. Draco smiled thankfully at Harry and say sat in silence as Mrs. Weasly gave them both two big mugs of tea and, 20 Minutes later, a vat of still steaming cookies.
"Sorry", Harry said contrite. "Never mind. But you seem to be awfully dazed these days, Really." She looked out of the Window and Harry saw that they were nearing King's Cross Station. He hastily put on his normal clothes and just finished stuffing his cloak and everything back into his trunk when they arrived. Inside the heavy crowd, he was swept through the barrier, without the chance of a last glance at Draco.
The addressed smiled. He had sat down on a lavish Four-poster bed, with black silken sheets. The room really knew what was needed... The Chamber was lit dimly by softly flickering Candles on the walls which where a Heavy dark brown, which Harry distinctly felt was real Mahogany. Next to the bed was a small drawer, fully equipped with everything they could wish for...
He edged closer in on Harry who wanted to raise his wand but at that moment he heard Mr. Weasly call "Petrificus Totalus!" Uncle Vernon's Hands and legs snapped together and he fell on the ground with a loud 'thud' , not being able to move more than his eyes, which bulged at Harry, displaying such fury and hate that Harry had a real doubt about returning here next summer.
Then, as if every step was taking him a great deal of strength, Harry heard the heavy footsteps of Uncle Vernon and sure enough, shortly after, his Uncle opened the Door just a slit. He peered through the small gap at them and immediately tried to shut the door again, but Mr. Weasly was faster. With one swift movement he pushed the door open, knocking back Uncle Vernon, who staggered and nearly fell. Mr. Weasly tipped his head an said: "Thank you very much for letting us in.", I such a polite way that, if Harry hadn't seen differently, he would have believed that Uncle Vernon had invited him in.
"She just hasn't been all... there, you know. I mean... she is a bit... I don't really thinks she sees reality the way we do. I mean, sure she can act in public and all but... when were at home...
"Mr. Weasly!" he cried out " I am so glad you are here! Please, we have to help Draco fast, his condition is getting worse by the second..." He beckoned Mr. Weasly to the now unconscious Draco, who was very greyish looking. He lay half on his stomach and Harry, and the gashes were visible, because Harry hadn't been able to put Draco's shirt on again. It had hurt too much for him after Harry had to take of the bandages again because they were soaked with blood and pus. The older man looked taken aback in shock for a second, then, without further Questions, he waved his wand and Draco began floating softly down up, through the room and down the stairs. In the entrance hall, Harry saw that The Head of the Weasly family head used the 'Petrificus totalus' Spell on Uncle Vernon, and a grim smile flickered over his face.
After he assured her that he would come back soon and visit, Draco stood up and, taking harry by the hand left the Room and walked down towards the fireplace.
"But you don't want to do this. Wait until the committee comes back. Wait for the charge. If you do this now, you'll be the one they convict. And I really would have a hard time, duelling all of the ministry to get you out of here."
Harry saw Draco take a deep breath as he stood up and together they stepped forward until they faced the witches and wizards of the high court as Lucius Malfoy had done before.
At the Name of Mr. Malfoy, Mrs. Weasly's cheeks flushed, but this time Harry could see, not in shame. In anger. In an Anger that made him wonder if someone should watch her the next days so she didn't sneak of to Azkaban to murder him in cold blood. Not that he would blame her.
"Well,"" he returned to the original topic, "I am very sure there is something like child-protection or something. You would have to face a trial, together with your father, probably. And I don't know about the wizard law. Maybe you can't see your Parents again. Your father could even go to Azkaban for this. Not that he wouldn't deserve it." He added under his breath. But Draco didn't seem to have heard him. His eyes had become blank as they mostly did now, when Harry mentioned his father. He looked uncertain.
"So... you are sure, are you? I mean, you now, that it is not some kind of trick, to get you over to the dark side, or hand you You-know-who on a silver platter?" , he then asked uncertainly. Harry's laugh sounded bitter.
"I wonder if she's going to be there." He said quietly. Harry looked startled for a second, then comprehension began to rise in him.
"You... don't want to go home?" He repeated slowly. This puzzled him. Draco had a nice home didn't he? Parents, a big Mansion, as far as Harry knew even Servants. But something in Draco's look stopped him from saying this.
Draco seemed completely overwhelmed by the situation. He just sat there stiff as a board, his eyes darting pleadingly to Harry, who himself seemed to be frozen in Place by the abrupt turnaround.
"I wanted to kill him." He said quietly and Harry stared at him, then at Madame Bones. Her face was unreadable.
Trying to keep his wits together, he reached for the lubricant on the bedstead. Slowly he began inserting one coated finger, enjoying the unevenness of Dracos pumps as he began gasping for more. Harry gave him more. Two fingers, three. Draco yelled his name.
Hastily, Harry scribbled a note 'I am downstairs. Don't come down! I'll be back soon. I love you' , so that Draco wouldn't worry when he woke up and lay it on the Pillow. He needed to keep the Dursley away from him at any cost. A meeting would have been awkward at best times, but in the state he was just in... it would be horrible. Harry couldn't let that happen.
During the talk, Draco's eyes had filled up with new tears. But they were different. It were tears that screamed for hope, for love, begged him to confirm that everything he said was true, that he really did love him. Harry leaned forward and kissed Draco, soft and warm. It was their first real Kiss since they had arrived at the Burrow, because there had always been someone around. But know, Draco flung his Arms around his neck and Harry put his own ones around the Slytherin's slim waist. There soft Kiss grew deeper ad Harry tried to put it all in this one Kiss, all his love and trust and faith in Draco. He could feel Draco's Heart flutter in his chest like a bird, and tasted the salty wetness of the tears that had been streaming down his beautiful face. So many tears. So many years of pain and suffering. Harry wanted to wash them all away, to save Draco from his own Darkness that seemed to linger in a corner of his world, always ready to jump at him, the moment he lowered his guard.
"And what are you, Draco? Because I think you have got it wrong somewhere. It is your father, who people would watch with disgust, not you." He raised his hand and put it under Draco's chin to make him look at the Griffyndor.
But Mrs. Weasly pulled back, looking at Draco with tearstrewn eyes. "I-I'm s-so, s-s-sorry!", she hiccuped. "I didn't... didn't mean t-to read i-it... I- I though...it w-would come only t-t-tomorrow..."
"Do you want to know what I see when I look at you? I who knows your secret?" Draco's eyes flickered, Fear and hopelessness spreading through him. This was what Harry had dreaded. Draco didn't believe in him. In them. So Harry took a deep breath
Harry smiled and looked up. Resting himself on his arms he leaned forward to kiss Draco's Lips again. The other gave in, beginning to let his hands wander over Harry's Chest and lower until he had Harry's member in hand, and now it was the Griffindors turn to moan. He didn't think he could wait much long with Draco stroking him like that.
"We will see,", said Madame. Bones flatly. "Mr. Malfoy Please sit down. Mr. Draco Malfoy, Please stand up and come forward to give you testimony."
"Ron, I'm not... we are... well, I'm not into girls, you know? Draco isn't just my friend, he is... he's my boyfriend."
"Wait a second, I'm coming to you.", he whispered and hastily dashed away from the Window and went down the stairs, carefully avoiding the last step because it creaked. He tiptoed to the front door praying once more for the Dursley's to be fast asleep, then took the key from the chain next to the door and opened it.
He wondered what Draco was doing. Was he drinking a cool juice in that great mansion of his? Maybe they even had a pool in which he could swim on hot days. But than he remembered the look on his face when he talked about home and asked himself, not for the first time, what the blonde didn't tell him. What could be so wrong at his home, that he didn't want to go back to his family?
Without thinking, he wrapped his arms around the older boy. He felt Draco shudder, then, as if his world depended on it, he grabbed Harry's arm, held it tight.
The door opened and two Dementors slid in. The room became cold and Gray immediately but the two only had eyes for Mr. Malfoy whom they grabbed under the arms and dragged out of the room, while he screamed and struggled. Harry tightened his grip around Draco, who had his eyes closed, but who could not shut out the fainter growing screams of his father. The Door closed and all became silent again. Amelia Bones sighed deeply. Then she directed her Wand at the two guards, who came out of their revere at once, looking confused at the mess.
But he didn't really believe that help would come. And even though it seemed to take him ages to come to all these conclusions, his wand had been in his hand from the moment he had heard Malfoy senior say the first curse. It really helped to have seeker reflexes. He stood up, his gaze fixed ad Mr. Malfoy. The Man came towards him, his own Wand outstretched and pointing at him.
"Mrs. Weasly, couldn't we get Madame Pomfrey? She can mend cuts in a second, can't she?" Harry asked hopefully. Madame Pomfrey was able to grow back bones in one night and mend them in seconds, surely this wasn't a Problem for her. But Mrs. Weasly looked even sadder, but also angry, Harry saw to his surprise.
Harry opened his eyes which he had closed at the fall. Draco was standing in front of him. He was still white but the fire... The fire in his eyes was back. Not only back, but burning, blazing as Harry had never seen it before. In his han was one of the Guards wands. He hadn't cowered in the corner out of fear, as Harry thought he had gotten one of the spare wands n the room, since his own was still at the manor.
Harry Potter was head over heals in love with Draco Malfoy. The whole thing sounded like a gigantic Joke Rita Skeeter would conjure up, to bring them both into discredit. But Harry couldn't help it. And he also couldn't help to wish that Draco would smile, just once. Whenever he smiled in public, it was cold and calculating. It never reached his eyes. Harry just wished that he saw just for once how his whole face would lighten up when he was really happy.
"I'm going too!" He said firmly. "Harry's my best friend, and I won't let him face those... Muggles alone!" Harry grinned and nodded but Mr. Weasly looked unsure.
He was just about to hoist himself up to go back into the Castle, when he stepped into the room. He looked strangely dishevelled, as if he didn't really know, what he was doing there. He just stood at the entrance, and then, tentetavely, took a few steps until he stood right in front of Harry.
Harry saw Draco flinch on the sound of his fathers Name. Harry thought that the full weight of what he had to deal with had to come to him right now, after hearing it spoken out like this.
Draco stiffened, but then relaxed, letting her hug him tightly for a moment longer. Then she let go.
At that time the door banged open. Amelia Bones came hurried in, together with the rest of the committee, looking livid.
Harry had been last the changing room after a Quidditch match with Slytherin. He didn't want to go celebrate the Victory with the others just yet. Harry wanted to savour the feeling of Draco, flying right next to him, for a bit longer. They were never as close as then, there , high above the ground, with the wind on their faces. In the end, Harry thought, it was a miracle that he could catch the Snitch at all, with all the Distraction that he had.
When Draco had finished, a deep silence fell. Harry hadn't hear him ever talk that much in one go. It was as if all this had had to come out, once he had started. And now, Harry saw, he looked kind of relieved. As if the weight on him had become a bit lighter now, that he finally told someone.
"No, it would have been very complicated to connect their grate to the floonet now, so we are going to do side-along apparition." He looked at them. "Ron has already done it, how about you two?" He asked towards Draco and Harry. Draco nodded, but Harry shook his head. "Okay, Harry, come here. Just hold on to my arm tightly and don't let go. I have to warn you, it is not a very pleasant feeling."
"Of course my dear. But I fear, that Is all I can give you now. We have to acclimate your stomach to food again or you might get ill and you will need all your strength to heal up. But a third bowl really shouldn't be a problem." And then she did something that seemed to shock Draco somewhere deep down. She caressed his head with her hand and gave him a kiss on the forehead. Draco seemed thunderstruck and his eyes followed her until she was out of the door. Then he slowly raised his hand against his forehead as if she couldn't believe it.
He spoke fast and seemed to bet a bit beside himself. Harry could only assume that he had sat here, worrying the whole time. To his surprise, it was Draco, who smiled slightly and said: "To be honest, I wouldn't say no to a hot chocolate." Mr. Weasly stopped talking immediately. For a moment he looked stunned, then he seemed to fall together with relaxation. He nodded and conjured to cups of hot cocoa with a flick of his Wand and a muttered spell. Then he got out to boxes for them to sit on.
"Mrs. Weasly, please don't feel bad for reading this. Sooner or later you would have heard about it anyway. My... Lucius Malfoy is just too well known for this not to be covered everywhere."
"My... my...father came into my room... it was late. He said... I should... lay still and... and don't make a sound... never make a sound. He did things... he... he... he touched me and... and..."
There, he said it. He looked up carefully to see Ron, utterly shocked and perplexed. Then the other one started to laugh.
The blonde told Mr. Weasly everything, even though his voice trembled a bit when he spoke about what he nearly did to his father, but Mr. Weasly just put a hand don his shoulder and squeezed it once as if to say 'It's okay, I understand you' and Draco took a deep breath and went on.
Wouldn't it be better if the Weasly's heard it from him and not from the 'Prophet' But then, it had taken Draco everything he had, to confide in Mr. Weasly and the day after tomorrow, he would have to do it again before a whole court. He guessed all he could do was tell the other that they please didn't think any different of him if they found out the truth.
A scream came from the kitchen. Aunt Petunia had stood in the door, eyeing the scene and now she looked as if she was going to faint, yet she dared not move towards her fallen husband, staring at the band of wizards still staying between them.
"Draco, that is wonderful news. I will contact Molly that I'll be sending you two home in about five minutes and then this evening, I think, We'll have feast. How does that sound?"
"Now look what you've done, you great ape! You are as stupid as you are fat!" He had hissed and stomped out of the room.
It was as being pressed through a very tight tunnel. Harry felt as if he couldn't breath, couldn't see... Then it was over. With a slight thud, they landed on grass and Harry stumbled. Draco grabbed his arm and held him steady, though looking quiet shaken himself. Harry definitely thought that this was not his favourite way of transportation.
But he didn't say it. His love would have to go through enough to deal with his father without having to face his mother being torn away from him too.
Draco regained his Strength very slowly. Harry kept him company almost the whole time. The day after he had woken up, Ron came in. Draco looked at him and for a second Harry thought Draco would sneer a mean comment. To be honest Harry would have been glad, because it would have meant that he was getting his confidence back. But he just looked at Ron and then bowed his head muttering "Hello"
When he awoke, it was dark. He wasn't quiet sure at first, what had woken him. Maybe it had been the pain on his back. Or did he have had another Voldemort-Nightmare? But he didn't remember anything of that sort. His back felt sore still but not so painful that it would have woken him, and his scar didn't hurt as well, which it normally would do when he had dreamed of Voldemort. So what had woken him?
"Don't worry, he will soften up in a few hours." Mr. Weasly said apologetically, but harry shrugged. "If it were up to me, he could stay like this forever, honestly." he murmured as the red-haired man lay Draco onto the back seat and ushered Harry to the front. Harry shot one last glance back to see Petunia and Dudley peer through the kitchen door into the Entrance Hall frightened, then his gaze fell upon Draco.
But the start of term drew nearer and with every day, Harry grew more aware of the fact that they had to do something. Both Harry and Draco needed to get their stuff. Draco hadn't even managed to take his wand with him when he had ran, a clear sign of the terror and distress he had been in at that moment. It really bothered him, Harry saw him put his hand over or inside his pocket every so often, only to watch him draw back again, a sad expression on his face.
They sat down on the Sofa and Harry tugged his arm around Draco, who had curled up into a tight ball once more. Then they sat there. There was one question, burning on Harry's tongue, but he didn't know, how to ask, if he should ask at all. But he was lucky, in a way. Because Draco brought it up first.
Draco's Voice ripped him from his thoughts. The other boy was looking away again. But now, he just seemed tired. His shoulder were hunched, as if he was carrying the weight of the world. Harry wanted to answer, but stopped. Something about this sentence wasn't right. It sounded as if...
"Meanwhile, the other Weasly's came out of their rooms, awoken by Ron's shouts and there was a bit of confusion and a lot of laughter as He had to explain the situation over and over again because they were all talking at the same time.
The door appeared. Harry went through it and found himself in a beautiful room, atmosphericly lit by at least a dozen candles burning on low wooden tables. But he had no eyes for that. Only for the boy, lying on top of the bed with the silken sheets – already naked, but covered in rose petals. Harry's mouth grew very dry.
She seemed positively giddy and ushered them into the Kitchen at once, where two mugs of steaming hot tea stood waiting for them. She made them sit down and started bustling about, talking of making a vat of cookies to celebrate the occasion.
"Mr. Lucius Malfoy, do you have anything else to say to the Court?" She rounded on Draco's father who looked as if he wanted to say a great deal of things, non of which would have been very appropriate for under-age ears
The blonde continued mumbling a bit, but after a while, Harry felt his breathing become deeper and steadier and his weight become more heavy. He positioned himself so that Draco sled down and came to rest with his head in Harry's lap. He stirred a bit and tucked himself to a small ball again but he didn't wake. Harry started to stroke his hair. He hoped that Draco would be able to get at least a bit of sleep now. He needed it so desperately. And then Harry had an Idea. Ron had explained to him that the ministry couldn't actually detect who had done magic so no one would notice if he did it in a house full of Wizards who were allowed. He tugged out his Wand and mumbled " Expecto Patronum". The silver white stag erupted from his wand. It turned and looked at Harry.
"Aren't you going to ask me what the trial was about?" He said it in a strained voice, as if to force himself to keep calm. Mrs Weasly's shoulders sagged. And them she turned around in one fluid motion and hugged Draco so tight that Harry could see the air getting knocked out of him. And to his great dismay, she began sobbing.
I debated endlessly whether to send Narcissa to St. Mungos or not. On the one hand, sending her there is not the happy ending I really do like in stories. But on the other hand I couldn't justify not doing it. The way I have written and designed her means she is way to far gone to care for either Draco or herself. I was toying with the idea of Draco taking care of her, but the poor guy has been through enough and really doesn't need the responsibility to look after his half mad mother.
Harry looked at him. Part of him wanted to say that no, that wasn't what he meant at all. But he could not, would not lie to Draco.
Draco yawned next to him and rubbed his eyes. Then he looked around sleepily. "Whas for breakfas?" he mumbled, still half asleep. Harry looked at him. The fire was still there. Yes, there was hope. They would manage.
"Could you tell him... that I'm sorry?" she blushed. Harry shook his head and she seemed taken aback.
"See, These are just clothes. Don't you want to put them on? I could make you some tea if you want..."
Harry stared at him. Draco's Hair was a bit ruffled sure, but Harry knew perfectly well he could flatten it in seconds. But the he understood. It was his way of saying sorry. Mrs. Weasly looked at him with an odd expression and Harry saw to his surprise, tears glittering in her eyes. When she spoke her Voice was a bit throaty.
"Well, to be honest, I think I can get away with it just fine." he said, taking out his wand and pointing it at his Uncle. "Unless you want the same pigtail as your son, get out of the way." His Voice had become low and there was a hint of danger in it. Uncle Vernon huffed and puffed – but he didn't move.
Uncle Vernon tried to get out of Harry where he had put the food, but Harry said he'd thrown it somewhere into the hedge between their lawn and the next. He new his Uncle wouldn't look. Too great the danger that one of the Neighbours could spot him doing something funny.
She is a little like a ghost, floating around and a bit indifferent to what is happening around her. When I said She probably didn't know what was going on, I meant it. She probably really doesn't. It wouldn't fit her view of the world, so even if she somehow got a hint of it, she will have buried it, somewhere in her subconsciousness. She can't cope with the real world. Or with problems.
"Wait here.", he said abruptly, standing up and leaving the room. What he was going to do now was probably foolish, but he wouldn't let Draco starve just because he could get in trouble. And he would protect Draco. He walked in the Kitchen, casually as if it was normal for him to return for second helpings, and put three more toasts, five slices of bacon and two eggs on a second plate. Then he walked up into the room again. As he hoped, the Dursley's were so aghast in this second, that they didn't know how to react. But he didn't have much time. On the stairs, he broke into a run, dashed into the room and put the plate in front of Draco.
They sat there for quiet a while. Harry didn't know how long. The Patronus stayed, watching over the, making Harry feel calm too. He thought about the day after tomorrow. About Lucius Malfoy, About Draco, about everything.
"Well, maybe not every time, but often enough.", he joked light-heartedly. "And as I said Mr. Weasly will be there right? Believe me, my Aunt and Uncle won't move one muscle if they face the prospect of a fully-fledged Wizard turning them into rats or something like that.", he added, which smoothed the frown lines on Draco's forehead a bit. Harry kissed him and and went up to the bedroom with him.
"Come on, love, we should make ourselves a bit more suitable for breakfast, don't you think?" He smiled and they stumbled towards the bathroom, hurrying to get there before the twins, who tended to need very much time in there every morning, what Harry blamed on the fact that they were doing nonsense half the time. When they had dressed, showered and brushed their teeth, they went back down, where Mrs. Weasly had piled an enormous amount of Pancakes on a Platter and was now making scrambled eggs, bacon and toast. When everyone had arrived, Harry saw with relief that Draco was not forcing himself to eat something as he usually did, so that no one got to worried, but rather ate three helpings, with so much joy as if he hadn't eaten in days. And if Harry thought back, that probably was the case. In the end he hadn't been able to keep anything in long.
Harry is thankful for the opportunity to look around and finally see where Malfoy has been disappearing to. He’s disappointed. The room is nothing other than a small private dormitory with a tiny bed taking up most of the floor space. Malfoy sits on the side of the bed, staring at the floor. Harry stands awkwardly in front of him, as there is very little wiggle space to work with.
Today was the second day of the holidays and Neville’s grandmother decided that today they would be going to Gringotts. Just as Neville had said, professor McGonagall had not denied his late minute request to leave for the holidays. What did seem weird to Harry was that professor Dumbledore had called him to his office asking about where he would be spending his holidays. He even tried to convince Harry that he was not safe outside the walls of Hogwarts. While he had not been able to stop Harry from going, it made Harry wonder about what was going on.
“My magical guardian? I don’t even know who my magical guardian is!” shouted Harry getting upset; he had never felt so powerless before. He calmed down when he felt a hand on his shoulder from Mdm. Longbottom telling him “calm down Harry, we will sort all of this out.”
But, while you are a minor you are 15 years old, which means that your opinion will also be taken into account. I would advise you to take your time to choose a new guardian. Your current guardians were muggles, so they had little to say in the wizarding world, but if your new guardian is a wizard or witch they will have a lot more power over your daily life.”
Laughing at the letter from the twins, Harry decided to quickly hide the products they had sent them before Severus or Serena decided to take them. A sudden thought popped in his head that it would be quite fun to use some tonight but luckily his etiquette lessons payed off and Harry decided against it.
Having not expected that answer, Harry mumbled out, “Oh, ok,” a bit embarrassed and with a slight blush forming on his cheeks.
“I don’t want to hear it,” Serena said forcefully, “Harry, the Patils are a high up pureblood family. It is only your luck, that for some reason your treatment of her has not gotten around. You will write an apology letter by tonight and before you send it off you will show it to me.”
“So, how have lessons been going with mom and dad? I will need to start learning politics as well next year and am so not looking forward to it,” said Ethan.
“Does that mean I can take a holiday in one of these places this summer?” asked Harry excited. He had never been on holiday, let alone been outside the country.
“Can we open the presents now?” Ryan said trying to use some puppy eyes on Severus but due to his excitement that did not work.
After everyone took their seats and the refreshments were brought in, Lucius turned to Harry, “So, how are you adjusting to your new life, Harry?”
Reading the letter a few times, Harry was glad that Sirius was still on his side. Opening his present he was happy to see that it was a communication mirror. He assumed that Sirius mus have the other one. Deciding to call tomorrow after the ball, he put away the present and letter. He was a little worried about why he had not received any letters while at Hogwarts but decided to ask Severus later.
" I understand, Draco. If you want, I will lead everything into it's way. As I said, there will be an inquiry. I cannot spare you this, you will have to say this words again before a Judge and Jury. I am sorry. I wish there was a way around it..."
He felt the knot tighten as he considered that possibility. His wand, his broomstick... what if the Dursley's had destroyed it all? But Mr. Weasly shook his head.
"Well it's going to be a bit cramped but if we stick together we should squeeze all in.", he said smiling. Harry looked at him, but decided not to ask. So they cramped into the box, and Mr. Weasly dialed the number "62442" on the dial plate
The next two weeks seemed to pass in a kind of haze. The other Weasly's found out out the trial eventually, but nobody talked about it. A few Reporter came by and tried to ask Draco for an Interview until Mrs. Weasly hung a Note on the Door:
The Holidays promised to be as boring and dreadful as Harry had thought. The Dursley still hated him, no surprise there, and they had given him loads of hard work as if they thought that if he had to work with his hands, the magic would somehow be pushed out of him.
Harry suddenly realized. The whole world would soon know. There was no way the ministry could keep that covered up, not with Lucius Malfoy being such a highly influential figure in it. He wondered if Draco had come to this conclusion yet and whether or not he should bring it up.
Getting the go ahead both Ryan and Ethan jumped up and headed towards the family room at a fast paste, lords and heirs do not run of course. Deciding that presents looked more interesting Harry decided to follow and grab some breakfast afterwards.
“As is customary, the main Potter vault has been closed since your parents died. The only vault that is accessible until you become lord is your trust vault,” explained Severus further.
Entering the family room Harry was surprised by what he saw. He was sure that the house-elves had been up all morning to change the décor from last night into a warmer pallet. The Christmas tree was largely the same, but now in addition to the classic Christmas ornaments, the elves had added ornaments that were actually made of candy or chocolate. Another addition to yesterday evening were the tons of presents under the tree wrapped in colors of green, silver, blue and red, and Harry could even spot some gold. Severus probably found red ok nut in combination with gold it almost felt like entering in Gryffindor territory.
“I am a bit nervous about it. As you know veelas only have one mate to choose from. Even if it is someone that lies often closest to our tastes, you still never know.”
“How dare you! Please explain this to me!” shouted Sirius while throwing the Daily Prophet at Dumbledore. “Have you read this?”
It was on the third day at breakfast that Neville finally received a reply. Shooting a quick glance to Harry, who was squeezed between Ron and Hermione, he told him with his eyes to meet him in the dorm room later that day.
When Harry, Neville, and Mdm. Longbottom arrived back at the meeting room Severus Snape was already there. He was in a deep conversation with Ripclaw. Harry was hoping Ripclaw was explaining everything, as he really did not want to go through it all again.
“Your welcome and outside of class you can call me Serena, Miss Lovegood. The same for you Mr. Potter.”
“Without him mentioning it I would have never noticed something was wrong. I still cannot believe that they would do something like that. I trusted them and they stole from me, kept my inheritance away, and placed so many different spells and potions on me,” glowered Harry, getting worked up, being reminded of what had happened.
"I will have news for you this evening. Whatever it costs, I will make sure, that he never touches you again."
When the big man had left and locked the door behind him Harry whispered "You can come out now" into the room. His wardrobe slowly opened. Draco looked at him with big eyes, the plate still in his hands.
He and Draco went in last and Harry mumbled, "I'm just getting' my stuff, y'know?" , passing him quickly.
"Don't worry,", said Mr. Weasly, obviously surprised at his own daring. "The curse will lift when the children and I are a bit away so your husband cannot attempt to hold him up again. I did not mean to harm him, Madam, but we really have to get going again."
Lucius Malfoy couldn't do anything like this, could he? There were Guards. They would stop him if he attempted anything...
"Oops" , he said, starting to apologize but Harry waved it away. "Leave it. If were lucky, it'll start to stink through the house during my time in Hogwarts." , he shrugged and Ron grinned.
"May I have a look at it?" He asked quietly. Mrs Weasly trembled. "Oh Deary, I don't know... it is not... I mean you shouldn't have to see... not so important..." She seemed to mumble to herself, clutching the newspaper tightly.
"I will take full responsibility for that of course." He ended, bowing his head towards Madame Bones.
"Harry... something really terrible has happened to him, hasn't it?", she asked, her voice still a bit shaky. She looked ashamed. Harry nodded and Ginny looked at her feet.
"I can't.", He said with a kind of finality. A bad feeling started to creep up in Harry. A feeling that he couldn't yet name.
They reached another deserted side street and Mr. Weasly stopped, wrenching Harry out of his thoughts. They stood in Front of a Telephone box, old shabby and rather broken looking. Mr. Weasly turned around.
The words had come from Draco. Mrs. Weasly and Harry both turned and looked at him. He sat with his face to the desk. "That is really nice of you Mrs. Weasly and... could you... I mean... I don't think... I don't think my hair wants to lay quiet flat." He ended weakly.
This time, Harry toppled over. The Chair had been pushed into his knee pit and he stumbled, falling. He would not be able to deflect the next one.
But He hadn't heard wrong. The words ringing in his ear, he turned to see Draco stare at him. He didn't know what to say. How could he console him? How tell him, that it would be all right? There were no words for what the blonde had experienced.
At the last day of term Harry, Ron and Hermione stood at the Train station and waited for the Hogwarts-Express to arrive and take them home too their respective families. Harry caught a glimpse of Draco, flanked as usual by Crab and Goyle. His heart gave a jolt and he had to hold back really hard not to run to him. He felt someone tugging on his sleeve. It was Hermione and she said" Come on, Harry, or we won't get any seats!"
"It's fine." Draco interrupted him. It was as if saying it had opened a Vessel in him, through which the darkness could pour out.
Harry didn't know how long they stood there. But when they finally broke apart, Draco had stopped crying. He looked at Harry and the boys heart made a jolt. There it was. The fire. It was small, but the spark had finally grown into a small blue flame. He would nurture this fire, never again would he let it go out. He kissed Draco again, now on the verge of joyful tears himself.
It was unlike anything Harry had ever seen. The Atrium was grand and gold. People were popping out of fireplaces all around them looking ruffled and businesslike.
"No." She said in a low voice. "I don't want you to pretend anything. I wanted... I just wanted...", she began to cry. Harry sighed heavily and made a step towards her. He slowly put his arms around her, half suspecting she might push him away. But she snuggled close to him and cried into his shirt while he stroked her hair. After a while she seemed to calm down and he broke away. "Ginny,", he said, "I will always be there for you. You are like a little Sister to me. I'm sorry I can't offer you what you might have imagined, but I can offer you my friendship. But only if you promise not to make Draco miserable again." He added seriously. She nodded. Harry felt relieved. He rustled her Hair again and turned to go back into the living room, when Ginny called him back.
"Mr... Mr. Weasly-hihihih... I you knew... if you knew how often I-hahahaha... I wanted to do tha-hahaha-t..." Harry gasped as he struggled to breathe through his laughter. Draco now bend down and held out his hands, which bot Harry and Ron took and they heaved themselves up the ground again. Harry was still panting,but he regained a bit of composure again.
"So, Mr. Malfoy, you deny all the charges laid against you?" , said Madame. Bones and Harry saw to his relief that she was not smiling, but staring at Mr. Malfoy very intently as if she wanted to x-ray the truth out of him.
"It pretty much says what happened. They didn't even skim away from the... nastier details. " He laughed bitterly. Harry took his hands. Draco looked up at him. "I knew they were going to print it you know... but still, how can seeing it written down like that make it seem so much more... real?"
When Harry woke the next morning, he found Draco already up. The blonde sat on the edge of the four-poster, his knees on his chin and his hands around his legs. He looked sad.
But it came again, and again. Flashes of light shot towards him from Malfoy's wand and he was pushed backwards. The backs of his knees hit the chair. He was pretty much already standing with his back to the wall. Meanwhile, he saw Draco crouching into one of the cornes. He must be out of his mind with panic
After a while she stopped crying. Draco looked at her and sorrow filled his eyes. "Mother, I don't know what will happen now. But I will protect you. I will care for you. Don't worry. Just hold on and I will take care of you. Trust me." His voice broke a little but his eyes were dry. His mother smiled.
The Big Man mouthed silently, obviously searching for words, but didn't seem to find some that would fit the crudity of this situation. After Mr. Weasly, Ron went in, grinning broadly at Uncle Vernon, saying: "How's Dudley, doing, eh? As porky as always?" , and strode past him, leaving him now in a state that frightened Harry into thinking it might lead to a Heart attack.
Mr. Weasly smiled and patted them both on the shoulder. Then he stepped back. Draco was the first to take some of the green powder from a desk next to the fireplace and throw it into the flames. They shot up emerald green and he stepped right into them. Clearly audible he said "Malfoy Manor", and vanished.
"Who touched you Draco?" Harry's stomach contorted as the answer, only a whisper, seemed to ring loud in his ears and through the room.
"She won't think any less of you, Draco. She really likes you." He sat down next to his lover and put one arm around his shoulder. Draco leaned in on him and for the first time since they got back from his Aunt and Uncles Harry had the feeling, that Draco could even see ahead of him.
He packed all his Schoolbooks, Quills, Parchment, Ink bottles, Potion Ingredients and clothes, slammed the trunk shut and put the empty Owl Cage in front of him.
He now reached for the drawer and pulled exactly that lubricant out. He put something on his finger and Draco shuddered as he pushed the cold finger in. He started panting and gasping a Harry moved his finger back and forth, soon adding another and another. He wanted to stretch Draco thoroughly so that there would be no pain at all for him.
"I will see what I can find in the law, that could help you here, I promise.", Mr. Weasly added. Draco blinked, then smiled again.
"You have to. You have to get your strength back, okay? Do it for me.", he added, hoping that it would help. Draco looked at him uncertainly, but he picked up the Toast and started nibbling on it. Harry watched as he first only took bits, then took a great bite and clearly had to hold himself back not to stuff it down his throat. He also finished the bacon I a second, but Harry could see he was still hungry. He didn't know what to do. Should he go down again? But how was he going to explain why he needed more food? But Draco looked as if he was almost on the verge of tears again, this time of hunger, and Harry decided.
"Stupify!" Malfoy Senior flew backwards and Draco walked slowly towards him, his face stony, but his eyes still on fire.
It was an odd Question that Harry didn't exactly where to place. "I... guess so." He said slowly. Draco shook his Head again.
Lucius Malfoy jerked his head towards Draco. Harry's eyes flickered only for a second to the boy he loved. Chalk white, he stared into his father's face, transfixed by horror and shock, seemingly unable to look away.
