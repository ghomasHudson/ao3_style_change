Harry hadn't even had time to stand up from the sofa when Draco had come in the front door after work, before he was right in front of Harry, demanding, "Thoughts on angry sex?"
"Er, thanks Dennis."
Zylphia laughed. "Oh please, you know I'm not lying — if anything you're the one lying to yourself. You need some more confidence, you do."
"Fine then, if you can't keep your mouth shut, then you'd better scream like you mean it. You'd better be as loud as you can — let everybody know what exactly I do to you. If you want to be loud, you'd better be
he was going to need a drink for this conversation. Despite Hermione and Harry protesting that it was
"Good, you two are already ready. Shall we go?"
Finally satisfied with his organisation, he shrunk the trunk down again, just enough so he could comfortably carry it in his arms, and headed out the door. Harry had just turned onto the fourth floor corridor from the stairs when someone knocked into him from behind. He managed to stop himself from actually falling, but he heard all of his books and dark detectors jumbling together. He closed his eyes and breathed deeply to compose himself.
Neville pulled him aside after lunch one day.
"Aww, aren't you two just the sweetest?"
As Draco laid in bed later that night, staring at the ceiling and listening to Harry's even breathing, he tried to get a bit of a handle on his thoughts. They, of course, had different ideas, and the main thing they kept bringing to his attention was just how difficult it was to pretend not to be affected by Harry when he was just so incredibly
"What're you thinkin' about?" Harry whispered.
"That! See! That!" the Gryffindor interjected exasperatedly, pointing at Harry.

"For what?"
he'd gotten free chocolate — he definitely couldn't wait to shove this in Draco's face.
"Are you done now?"
"Yeah? You mean Dean and Seamus' screaming match?"
of the magic is..."
," Harry said, but, nevertheless, curled up behind him on the bed.
She smiled. "That's the sweetest thing you've ever said to me. Including the Valentine's Days we spent together."
Draco groaned, locking his legs around Harry's waist. "Yes.
Draco looked over at Harry with glazed eyes and let out a small exhilarated laugh. His eyes quickly began to droop closed and Harry's followed of their own accord. He let his exhaustion take over, and the last thing he remembered was curling into warm arms before he drifted off.
"Goodnight," Harry said.
"Go fix your classroom so you can come back and get some sleep before breakfast."
"Can I rim you?"
Harry scoffed into his potatoes.
He looked out over all of the students from his seat at the staff table. It was amazing how he thought he'd miss a lot of them — and some of them would be gone from Hogwarts for good. Harry sighed and turned to Draco.
Harry snorted. “They
, he had persisted, and so here they were.
"Look, Malfoy, do you want to call a truce?"
"Okay."
"No, it's...it's fine. I just......don't know."
Harry nodded and set down his quill, slumping a bit in his chair. Draco made a sympathetic noise and draped his arms over Harry's shoulders, hugging him from behind and burying his face in his neck. Harry sighed contentedly and rested a hand on the back of Draco's head, absently toying with his hair.

"Oh. You never got married or anything?"
Let's eat Simon.
Either way, he thought wryly that his original Sixth Years would have all had heart attacks.

"Pretty much," he laughed. "I only learned how to make it because Sirius used to talk about how much he missed my grandmother's cooking. This was his favourite, so I thought I'd at least look it up and give it a go."
"Sorry, but what am I missing? What is the goal here?" Rodya asked.
Draco locked his legs around Harry's waist. "Yeah? Guess you'd better fuck it out of me then," he murmured into Harry's ear, tracing his tongue up behind the shell. Harry shivered and moaned, carrying Draco quickly to his bedroom and laying back on the bed so Draco was on top of him.
Hermione sighed.
Harry rolled his eyes, but started to pull back from the fire. "Come on and step through, then."
"Hmm," Hermione looked him over, "I thought for sure something more would happen with that. He was never really the type to let things go...especially when it comes to you."
"Oh, did it not end well?"
Harry stumbled slightly on an uneven stone in the floor, and caught himself in surprise. He had forgotten that he was, well,
Apparently he wouldn't be doing any brewing today then, if this was to be taken as any sort of sign. He quickly swept the salamander tongue back into its jar with his uninjured hand, and left the rest of it to clean up later. Draco was still angry at the knife and the idea of potions in general — sure, it wasn't the most rational, but it had pissed him off, and he'd be damned if he did anything to encourage it.
He pushed against Harry's chest and Harry pulled away slightly.
Lavinia slowly stood and made a few complex motions with her wand, muttering an incantation under her breath, and a clear blue orb appeared in front of his chest.
Draco pressed cork stoppers into the twelve tiny glass jars, and sighed, checking the time. Harry was awfully late coming home from St. Mungo's today, but he supposed that might be a good thing. He really needed to drop these potions off for Zylphia, and Harry had a way of...distracting him.
"Harry. I didn't see you at all yesterday after classes! Where did you go off to?"
the one who can't go shopping alone without getting five," his voice dropped briefly to a whisper again, "
Harry looked around and noticed all of the other boys were already gone. It must have already been somewhat late.
Harry grabbed his hands and brought them up to his chest. "That's not true, and you know it. Nobody I listed before sees you that way—"

"Just as verbose as always then?" Ginny grinned.
Harry beamed.
appearance — this dude was hardly dressed like a puritan himself. Those jeans were so ripped up they might as well not exist, and yet they managed to be tighter than Draco would've thought possible.
"Both. Think about it. You said he said that Harry had 'grown up 'round them,' so that's us, humans. What if there were like...testers. Ones sent to see if it was safe? And then he was talking about the 'war' or whatever, what if that's why they had to leave their home world and the survivors came here because they knew it was safe from the testers like Harry? And then they've created their own little cult society here now."
"Hey Professor Malfoy! What are you doing up here?"
“Right. Still think you’re a little barmy for all this, but…”
"What, you read the utter crap they put in the papers and expect nobody to actually be upset and act on it in person? The only reason they don't do more than glare and say nasty things in front of
Draco adopted his most impossibly confused expression.

I was supposed to, and I'd already quit the Aurors—" Harry cut off his rambling mid-sentence. "And. Yeah. So that's basically it."
Hermione shushed him. "Don't wake them! Could you zip me up?" There was the sound of a zipper.
Draco picked up the paper again, and quickly scanned over it. "Yeah, Cartwright's is
He could practically hear Draco's 'I told you so' already. Ugh, he really hated when Draco turned out to be right.
"Fuck. Right, I'm supposed to be being optimistic now. Horrible. Why did I say that?"
Yeah, Harry didn't think they sold books like that.
"Yeah, the two worlds are very different; it can take a lot of adjusting. Would you like something? I was going to go order, I haven't eaten since lunch."
Draco seemed unfazed by all of this — arching up against Harry's hands, clenching his fist tightly in his hair again as he kissed him, apparently lost in the feel of his mouth, his hands.
Were he in Draco's position, he'd probably be livid. It wasn't right for them to've
"Just give it a chance, okay? If it's really horrible, we'll bow out early and not stay the night. I'll be right there with you; I'm not just throwing you to the wolves, okay?"
"Hmm, actually, yeah. I could get on board with that."
"My brain just goes through it and then the wax comes and I just sit there in it, letting myself pay."
He had visited Hagrid a few times for tea in his hut, but after the initial greeting and catching up the second day, there hadn't been much to talk about. As much as he liked Hagrid, there were only so many rock cakes he could pretend to eat.
He and Draco hadn't ever talked about it, but Harry could only assume that a fake

For a moment, Harry looked alarmed, briefly entertaining the idea that these children really knew
Harry grinned when he pulled back, and Draco huffed. "Okay, I've seriously got to go, I can't be late."
Several students dropped by Harry’s office to wish him happy holidays, and he even got a few chocolate bars (Honeydukes, at that)! He was elated. His students actually liked him,

Harry blew out an aggravated breath. "I fucked him 'Mione, am I supposed to call him by his last name forever?"
"What?"
Harry rocked against his hand, cutting him off. "It's definitely okay."

He shuddered to think of just
He walked to the Great Hall in good spirits, and started to take his seat next to Harry, when he felt something falling on him. He looked up to see a small shower of rose petals coming down gracefully.

"We're fine."
"Yes, William?"

to tell me they don't. Bartholomew is devoted to you. Your coworkers are all fond of you, even if they think we're aliens." He leaned back against the counter, stirring the mixture in the glass with a spoon. "Why is it so difficult to believe that I might have fallen in love with you?"
"Oh, erm, yeah." Harry laughed awkwardly.
"Well, you're clear of anything I can find." She waved her wand again, dissipating the green ring, and tucked it into her robe pocket.
Harry nudged Draco's foot with his, and looked at him out of the corner of his eye, head still resting on Ginevra's shoulder.
"I just wanted to know if we will be learning the same things as the Seventh Years, or if our curriculum will differ slightly."
"What's up?"
"Don't ask me," Harry said, taking off his glasses and waving them away onto the nightstand. "Give me your wand, you're going to break it sleeping with it."
do?" someone else muttered.
His Snitch tattoo fluttered down to the back of his hand where Harry's lips had been, and Draco pointedly looked away from it. He'd noticed the Snitch had increasingly taken to following wherever Harry touched him, particularly when he kissed him, and Draco found the level of affection that it betrayed endlessly embarrassing. At least Harry hadn't yet commented on it.
At dinner that night, the Great Hall was decorated sickeningly. Pink and red covered nearly every surface, and random showers of pink confetti hearts would spontaneously rain down on couples. As soon as Draco sat down, he voiced his disdain.
"We were never friends, and I doubt we ever will be, but I think an...arrangement could be made that would be mutually beneficial."
"Oh fuck, I didn't even know you were here today," Matt said, turning his head to blink at him.
"I'm getting the distinct impression that there's something I'm missing. And that none of you are going to tell me. You're all adults, come on, give me a break! Just, fill me in on something."
"Er, hi," he said awkwardly. "I'll just..." he scurried to his bed and shut the curtains, quickly casting a silencing charm around his bed. It didn't matter that he was trapped under his bed hangings, it wasn't like he was going to bed and needed to change or anything. He hadn't seen Ron or Neville, he realised, and wondered where they'd gone. Maybe he'd walked by them in the common room? If he had, he wished they would have gotten his attention and warned him.
"What? What's wrong with me? Did I do something?" Harry sounded a little hurt.
He fished out his schedule and found that his next class was Herbology (he also noted with excitement that he had an extra free period the next morning — more opportunity for hermiting himself away). Picking up his pace, he finally cleared the dungeons to see that there were still students leaving the Great Hall from lunch. Good, Harry had been lucky that he'd been wandering for a shorter time than he'd thought. He quickly headed to the greenhouses for class, deciding that he could probably get away with skulking around the library for a time after the lesson and again after dinner to avoid a repeat of the evening before.
In which Draco being a freak in bed (or, *cough*
Draco dropped the letters he was sorting, and turned his eyes on Harry. "
Harry shrugged. "I just winged it, honestly."
"No."
"Oh good, there will be at least one other person with me at the Christmas feast," Harry said distractedly as he tried to finish reading the paragraph he was on.
Ron, on the other hand, had found it absolutely hilarious, saying that there was no way Potions could ever be better than Defence, even disregarding the fact that 'Malfoy's a complete git'. That had made Harry laugh, but he had decided it wouldn't be wise to tell Draco that, as he certainly wouldn't agree.
"We'll just be gone for two days — maybe less — and I left you a fresh bowl of water right here, see?" He pointed to the bowl of water in Bartholomew's cage. "The window is open just enough for you; you just got in fine, so there shouldn't be any problems."
Ron and Hermione walked off and Harry followed. He didn't mean to push away his friends — it wasn't fun — it's just that it was
Ugh. Now he had his thoughts to himself and a busy work day ahead of him, and he'd probably be distracted thinking about Draco fucking Malfoy...and probably also fucking Draco Malfoy. But he didn't have to admit that — even to himself.
Draco nodded as he looked at the torn pieces of pastry on his napkin and half drunk cup of tea. None of it looked particularly appetising now, anyway.
Harry held up his hand, stopping his speech as it all finally clicked. Of course it was once again about Draco and whatever shady thing he
"I'm not? How would

Draco closed his eyes in contentment. "So, what are we doing then? Are we going to be an item?"
"We can judge that ourselves, thanks." Hermione rolled her eyes.
It was June and the weather was getting warmer. Too hot to argue, Draco had said.
Apparently, the Fifth Year Hufflepuff who had paid a visit to Harry's office yesterday was quite the gossip, and she had found the experience most intriguing.
"What, precious Potter doesn't like his titles? He wants to be just like everyone else?" Draco asked mockingly.
Harry couldn't quite make out the words.
"Alright then, lead the way," she swept her hand dramatically toward the staircase.
"Are you quite finished?" He had said.
. I'm sure if you just talk to him and tell him you don't want to fight, then you two can be perfectly civil."
"Sorry," he laughed, and uncurled himself the rest of the way, settling himself so he straddled Draco's lap.
"Conniving," Harry mumbled, kissing him again and starting to move back toward the bedroom. "I like that in a man."
He did not.
under the pretence that it was only as friends, only because they couldn't see anyone else. And sure, it hurt
"Ron, you've only ever been with 'Mione, and if you hadn't been you'd know that's definitely not true. But that wasn't the problem, that part was fine —
He covered his face with both hands. "Yeah, what about it?"
"Okay."
Harry thought he sounded like he was quoting straight from an advert, but he didn't want to be rude, so he hesitantly stepped forward to look at one of the cases.
It came out more of a near-unintelligible mumble around the toast, but Harry was well-practised in understanding Ron's speech whilst eating.
Harry checked to see if the potion was cool enough to pour, and distributed it into the waiting vials, reveling in the routine of it all. He heard the door chime faintly as he magicked the cauldron clean, and quickly quashed the bolt of hope that went through him. Every time the door had chimed all week, some part of his mind hoped it would be Draco, which made very little sense, seeing as he had just come in last Friday, and he was unlikely to have run out of anything in a week—
"I try." Draco panted. He wasn't entirely sure he remembered
Finally, Harry pulled back. "Do you think you can go for two rounds?"
"Harry," he corrected, grumbling.
He could feel Harry smiling against his lips as he slid his hands up the back of Draco's shirt, over his back, and then back down. His hands briefly trailed over Draco's arse, running down the backs of his thighs and hitching his legs up further.
Ron came into view a few moments later, and kneeled down. "Hey Harry, 'Mione's already gone to work. What d'ya need?"
," Draco growled. "
"Okay, sure," Harry shrugged.
Draco cocked his head slightly. "Odd. I suddenly don't understand humour at all."
The other students all immediately focused their attention on his left hand and began to chatter excitedly.
"I guess that would be fine. D'you want to go to the Witch's Veil?" Malfoy asked, still looking a bit confused as to why Harry would want to 'catch up' with him.
"Ugh," the pillar was pushed open, and the students came face to face with an angry, shirtless Draco Malfoy. He promptly turned back around and slammed the pillar shut.
"It's not exactly my idea of a fun time," Draco answered, haltingly, still facing away from him, sorting through the letters on the desk.
He continued on with his lesson.
"Whatever happened to manners? You know, 'Please make yourself at home', and 'What's mine is yours—'" he cut off as he saw a student in the doorway.
Draco flopped down on the bed with a groan. "Remind me never to play drinking games with Rodya ever again."
"What wax? Do you get a candle or something?"
He'd sent a package of sweets for Hagrid by owl, along with some dog treats for the puppy he'd gotten after Fang died. All in all, Harry was exhausted by Christmas, and he really hoped he hadn't forgotten anyone important. He'd already sent presents to the Weasleys, Teddy, and Andromeda, but the Holidays always gave him the feeling that he was forgetting something.
A girl in the front hesitantly raised her hand and everyone turned to look at her, many shooting warning or concerned looks. She put her hands out and glanced around, as if to say '
. He's grown a lot as a person, he really has, and I care about him a lot, Molly."
Hermione snorted. "Go on then, have a romantic dance and make up." She flicked her wand and Celestina Warbeck's
He'd liked what he'd seen of the job so far, and he felt that was a promising sign for the future. Plus, Zylphia had seemed pleased with his work, so he didn't foresee any problems there.
"Er, I saw an advert in the paper that you needed someone to help out, and I was wondering what exactly you needed."
"But what am I supposed to do about it then?"
"Oh." Draco took it hesitantly. "That's very sweet of her." And he meant it. When they'd arrived yesterday it had been incredibly clear she didn't approve of him, but she'd still gone out of her way to get him a gift, and he appreciated the effort.
know how to make a scolding effective.
Hermione gave him a slightly disappointed look.
"I'm sorry. You're really beautiful, you know that?"
"Seven!"
"Yeah," Harry echoed, letting out a slow breath and running a hand through his hair.
Molly, who usually complained that Harry was too skinny and too glum, was startled by how much Harry no longer seemed to need it. She felt odd, not fussing over Harry to smile. He was still much too skinny, of course, but instead of looking pale and underfed, he just looked...healthy. Really, he was practically glowing (although Molly swore she could still see his ribs).
Draco had sighed and stared up at the ceiling with his arms crossed until Harry had quit laughing.

He knew he was in deep, and he knew it was hopeless, but he couldn't help wanting to do anything he could to ease Draco's worry. And surely there was nothing wrong with that? Friends with benefits — or whatever it was that they were to Draco — were allowed to care for each other.
Harry awkwardly shifted his weight for a moment in the doorway, and they both stopped yelling when they noticed him.
He crawled back into bed behind Harry and snaked his arms around his waist. Harry stirred.
"You don't get to make it sound like a question. I want you to

heard that before, yes."
"Mm, don't know exactly what I expected, but that was probably better."
By the sixth of July, Draco was beginning to reassess. He missed Harry. He was so used to seeing him every day, and Harry was pretty much the only person he talked to. Perhaps it was less Harry's obliviousness being catching that distracted him, and maybe it was more Harry himself. The students had been right on one count, at least: he often really didn't notice anything else when he was talking with Harry. When they talked, they kind of formed their own little bubble — he hadn't thought anyone would notice it though,
Harry decided he might as well confront his Seventh Years today too. '
At the feast, Harry and Draco pulled wizard crackers together, and when a particularly ridiculous hat popped out, Draco picked it up and placed it on Harry's head, leaning over to speak quietly.
Rodya's brow creased again, and they quietly asked Zylphia a question in rapid-fire Russian.
"Yeah, I guess, thanks."
Oh hell. Fucking hell and god
Harry's Sixth Year class came in very excited. He had been incredibly pleased with the lecture on Sirens he had gone through with his Second Years, and he was eager to get in depth with the infatuation spell.
Hermione raised her hand, and Professor Ludgor indicated that she should speak.
The student sitting beside them pushed the mumbler and answered for them.
And at least Lavinia and Milton had done something somewhat
Harry woke him up gently by stroking his hair, and kissing his nose lightly so it tickled. Draco wrinkled it, and sniffed.
"Yeah, I'm really not sure if I'm going to be able to do that, mate."
Draco sighed, and brought his hand up to rest in Harry's hair. "Okay."
"No, we'll say we're going to the library if anyone asks."
He fixed the owl with a stern look. "And I'll know if you don't come home to sleep, young man. No staying up 'til all hours, alright? I trust you to feed yourself; you're a very smart hunter, I know, but you deserve some treats too." He fed him a few more treats, and kissed the top of his head.
Four and a half years later, Draco and Harry were practically a legend at Hogwarts. Every year, the new First Years were informed that, although they refused to admit it, the Potions Master and the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor (you know, the saviour of the wizarding world?) were definitely together.
The handwriting changed.
"Very. Can you imagine what Minerva would think of this?" He turned his head and let his nose skim over Draco's cheek.
Surprisingly, it took a couple of days for the change to be noticed, which the pair found utterly hilarious. Apparently their, Teddy, and Neville's absences between lunch and dinner had slipped by unnoticed. It was in Draco's class that it finally happened.
they are!
Hermione raised an eyebrow and gave him a stern look.
"Probably not," Draco agreed, sighing. Well at least he couldn't beat himself up for overreacting to the weather when Harry was practically the same. Small comforts.
After working all morning, and then brewing for nearly two hours, plus the overall stress of the past two days, Draco was honestly beat, but hopefully a little chat at Zylphia's would boost his spirits enough to come back and make dinner. Ugh.
Draco shifted himself closer to the door, hoping Harry would get the hint that it probably wasn't a good idea to continue talking in front of Muggles.
Harry scoffed and waved his finished coffee over. Draco was surely less than happy with that.
Draco scooted closer until they were flush against each other and gave Harry an emphatic kiss. "Where did you learn to do that?"
She snorted again. "
"Draco!" Rodya sounded scandalised. "What have you been doing to get in the papers? You never told me about this, Zylphia!"
He was standing imposingly by the blackboard when his Third Years filed in. He gave a short summary of their tasks and waved his wand to make the instructions appear on the board. He began to walk to his desk, when a student called out, sounding concerned.
Draco sighed happily, circling his arms around Harry's back. "You're my favourite person, you know?"
"Is it?"
heard all of that?!"

She gave a small grin and flipped him two fingers.

," a Seventh Year Gryffindor butted in with a smirk. "Beth! I've been looking for you. Are you lot all talking about Potter and Malfoy?"
"You're still not allowed to seduce me in my office," Harry sighed, but he found himself kissing back. Draco was a conniving bastard, but...that was, unfortunately, part of the allure.
They both drank more deeply.
"You've backed us into a corner, where if I

Harry nodded. "Yeah," he breathed.
"I just..." Harry trailed off.
..." he muttered, as he summoned the morning's Prophet from where he'd tossed it on his desk before running out the door for work.
Harry and Draco both startled awake in the same instant as light flashed through the room, briefly lighting it in a sickly green-ish glow, before returning to pitch darkness.
"Good." Ginny replied, rolling her arm, and trying to shake the feeling of pins and needles from it. "Don't know how you do it," she said to him.
"I think I have two that would be useful for an overview. Any certain kind, or just dark creatures in general?"
"Do we really
"Neville said something like that. He said if he hadn't seen me himself this year, he wouldn't have believed I could be 'like this.' But the thing is, I don't really notice much difference. I'm less tired of everything all the time maybe, but other than that I'm the same."

"I've got to take a piss, love."
"Yes, yes," Draco said distractedly, looking around for the next conversational victim. "That's exactly what she wanted you to think. Herr Sauer looks available."
"It's none of their business," Draco sniffed.
Draco forced himself to sit, and flinched at the pain, quickly grabbing onto his knee as if
"I'm sorry, I wish they'd stop all that 'Death Eater' shite — everyone knows full well that you were acquitted." Harry's brow furrowed as he read through the article.

his glamour, thank you very much.
He gave him a soft, slow kiss, trying to force as much calm Draco's way as possible. "Good?"
The three of them made their way down to the Great Hall, and Harry found himself beginning to notice that although he was clearly walking with them, he didn't actually feel as if he was in his body. He could sort of feel his limbs moving, but it felt fuzzy, and he felt like he was floating out of his own skin. It was an altogether odd sensation, and he may have ordinarily said something about it, but he found that his mouth was not working correctly.
"Okay?" Draco asked.
Harry's heart fluttered, and he looked up with a radiant smile.
"See you at five!" Harry called as Draco closed the door.
And when Harry woke up the next morning to the bed being jostled by Draco pulling on his boots, it only resulted in Draco turning and giving him a nod before letting himself out.
Harry went over to him, and spoke quietly: "You could have looked them up."
, he thought sarcastically. Why in Merlin's name were they here?
"You may call me Minerva now Harry, you are, after all, a part of the staff." Her eyes twinkled as she spoke. "Shall I show you to your living quarters?"
“Mum guilted her into helping out in the kitchen. She’s really been in a snit all morning about…” he glanced over at Draco. “She’ll get over it soon enough, though.”
"Fucking hell, mate. You might actually be onto something! Oh, and what if that's why Harry can't control his powers? Because he was raised amongst us humans?" Derek asked excitedly.
"I don't want to," Draco gritted out stubbornly. "I'll be fine in a second."
She released Harry and walked over to hug Draco tightly. He awkwardly patted her back.

She left and Harry turned to Draco.
Harry's classes were going more smoothly, and most of his students really liked him. They were only about two weeks into the term, but he felt like he was really getting to know them already. There were a lot of students, but he had the general feel of each class and how to handle them. He and Draco would still brag to each other every time a student gave them a compliment or a class went particularly well.
He set his dishes in the sink, and frowned when they merely sat there.
"Yeah, but I've heard they can pack a real punch sometimes. They can cause some
— how often do you think this happens?"
"Harry. You 'didn't need a silencing charm' my arse. Draco's shirt doesn't quite hide the massive love bite on him."
She turned and gave him a hard look.

He glanced up at the faculty table and froze. How had he forgotten? Professor McGonagall wouldn't be teaching transfiguration any longer because she was the headmistress, so there was a
Malfoy sat behind him, head on hand, eyes drooping, absentmindedly moving his quill against the desk. Harry quickly turned back around. Really, the noise was infuriating, but he didn't want to antagonise Malfoy — it would have been hard enough for the boy to come back to school at all.
"Of course. My mistake." Draco could feel Harry smiling against his cheek. "Marry me? You know, in a few years, so we have time to make it even better, of course."
. He knew it didn't make sense, but he continued to glare at the books, wanting them to know what they'd done.
He was so glad that Draco had had a good time, and that he had liked the Weasleys. He could tell that Molly absolutely loved him. She would want Harry to bring Draco around again, he was sure, and he couldn't possibly be more pleased to do so.
room either," he muttered, then he sighed.
, I never thought it would be so hard to have a fake relationship."
"What? I don't think that's a thing."
"Just general, I need to refresh myself on as many as possible for my O.W.L.s."
Altogether, only a split-second had passed before Harry let Draco continue leading him in their dance, and spoke up as calmly and clearly as possible, trying to channel as much Draco as he could whilst his voice still reverberated through the room.
"You didn't even need to use a proper movement. Oh Hell, come here and sit on the desk."
He knew for a
"Oh, you've opened your present. I hope you don't mind, I didn't have time to make the gloves too. Maybe next year," Molly said to him, as she directed several steaming mugs of hot chocolate to various people around the room with her wand as she was ladling them out of the cauldron over the fire.
“Harry,” Draco repeated, seemingly torn between amusement and grave seriousness. “You just dropped someone else’s spell on yourself with no wand, no hand movements, and no incantation in a split second between words, easy as breathing. They’re pissing themselves. You’re not exactly known for being calm either, and you just...I wouldn’t doubt they’re terrified that you know exactly who it was.”
"My love for you has nothing to do with this gaudy, tacky day. At least the decorations were toned down a bit this year," Draco sighed.
"Whilst not the most enthusiastic response, I'll take it," he paused again, and tutted. "Potter, just trying to get me into your bed."
Draco but his lip. "I... I don't know Harry. It isn't just about them not liking me," which was a bit of an understatement as far as Draco was concerned. He was pretty sure most of them
"Hrmph."
"Yeah, and what about Valentine's Day?" The Slytherin boy added.
The guy's brows furrowed as he stared at Draco's face.
Ron and Hermione strode out of the pub's Floo, one after the other, and Harry waved them over.
Draco gave him a soft smile, and kissed him. It was chaste and slow; a physical
Her eyes kept darting over to Draco and back as Harry spoke.
It sounded like Molly was practically smothering her with hugs.
He stood up and cast another cleaning spell over his robes, briefly entertaining the idea of skiving off his first class. Unfortunately, it was only the second day of the school year and he found it hard to believe that he wouldn't be missing many classes over the course of the term, so it was probably not the best idea to begin so early.
Draco wandered back into the living room and stared at Harry, who was still on the floor with his eyes shut. "You gonna get back up ever?"
days? These things are so ridiculously extravagant. Who needs a ball to last three nights in a row?"
The Gryffindor girl's eyebrows drew together. "Don't you two live together?"
Harry shrugged. "I mean we're already pretend-dating, it can't really hurt."
"Today, I want to start with a few off-topic questions. Do any of you know about something going on with the Fourth Year Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs?"
"Who said it was for
like. Draco thought there was no way Harry's lessons could actually engage all of the students — there were always a couple who were just determined to do nothing.
His healing spells were complete shite, and he couldn't very well go to Madam Pomfrey. When he'd skipped breakfast to ask Neville for help, he'd only laughed. Some brilliant friend
"Mmm, yes. It is generally thought of that way, but I'm working on a new potion and I believe...this may be the key. It's actually pretty satisfying once you get the hang of it," Draco responded somewhat distractedly as he skimmed the page.
"I know." Harry grinned, "When I saw they'd been taken off the Registry, it seemed obvious what I'd be getting you — I've heard you talk about wanting one often enough."
Harry's second class was buzzing with chatter as they took their seats. The Third Years always gossiped, but today was much worse than usual.
"Harry," Draco desisted biting and sucking on Harry's jaw to pant in his ear. "I want you to fuck me."
"Oh I'm well aware of that.
Then the whole top half of his cock was encased in warm, tight, velvety wetness. He looked down at Draco and Draco made steady eye contact as he sunk his mouth further down onto Harry's dick.

Zylphia rolled her eyes at him. "They didn't mean anything by it, you know they're too busy with their writing to bother with the papers."

burdened other people with no regard for how it affected them.
"Ben?" He appealed.
"I didn't need one, George, we're at the Burrow, I'm not going to do anything when Molly's—"
"I don't want to ruin their family holiday, though! I don't want them to just be nice because you're threatening to not visit."
"Well, we know they were probably both in there. Unless Professor Potter was talking to himself," Sophie tried to bring up the mood.
"I— what? Aren't you pissed at me?"
"Nope. I'm done as well. Proper motivation works wonders."
"Rodya's gonna steal him. Adopt him. My son."
"Hello 'Mione, nice to see you."
Harry nodded and turned his head for a kiss, which Draco gladly gave.
And then there was the fact that their relationship had already become so blurry since that first night they'd slept together. Harry didn't know what would be considered crossing a line at this point. Sure, they weren't
The officiator smiled. “Everyone, please welcome the new Mr. and Mrs. Granger-Weasley.”
Draco nodded and he slid them off, carefully pulling the waistband over his likely desperately sensitive cock without touching. He wrapped his hand firmly around the base, and Draco expected him to move up how Draco had been to kiss his face or chest, but Harry stayed where he was.
Harry didn't think he was acting too out of the ordinary. For all Zylphia knew, he could be quite the 'cheerful chap', and had only been trying to be serious whilst starting a new job. He knew that wouldn't be giving her nearly enough credit, though. She wasn't stupid — rather on the contrary, she seemed very perceptive — but still, Harry thought she acted like she knew a bit more than she actually did.
Harry rolled his eyes, and then, when that garnered no response, raised a judgemental eyebrow until Draco sighed and finally removed the hand.
He threw himself back into teaching, and his students enjoyed the creative lessons he came up with. He and Draco fell back into the pattern of visiting each other after classes to brag, although, strangely, they were noticing that more and more often students would hang behind, or come in soon after final lessons had ended whilst they were talking.
"What do you mean? It was so obvious. I'd been expecting it for ages."
it would go with their lesson plans! Plus, he could talk about so many different aspects, especially with the upper years.
Draco felt his mobile vibrate in his pocket, and pulled it out to look, grateful for the distraction from the discomfort of sitting at the Weasley's breakfast table. Harry was beside him, chattering away with Ron and Hermione, but Draco still felt horribly out of place.
Draco shrugged. "Like I said, I'll play along."
Zylphia leaned back in her chair. "I see. And so why are you so afraid of this then?"
Draco introduced himself as Professor Potter the next year. Having two

"Okay, I'll try, but you know how he gets under my skin. And if he starts being a prick I can't make any promises."
"The kitchens, sweetheart. The house elves are more than happy to help."
“Good luck on that one, mate.” Ron clapped him on the shoulder, and disappeared again out the back.
I'd kill for Pansy Parkinson's encyclopædic knowledge on all things personal politics right now."
He reluctantly slid out of bed. "When will you be home today?"
"Hey, what's that supposed to mean?"
Harry awoke to his own growling stomach, and groggily tried to find the time. Huh, he'd slept peacefully right through dinner. He thought it was probably just happenstance, but it was still a nice surprise that he'd been able to have a proper sleep.
Draco had heaved an extraordinarily put-upon sigh. "It was a dare. All the Sixth Year Slytherins were playing, first week back — we'd gather in the boys dormitory, it was a bit of a tradition. Basically, everyone ganged up on me, and since it was right after the...you know, I couldn't rightly say I was against marking my skin. I bargained them down in size though, because they hadn't
"Gladly. My toes were starting to get too complacent about not getting pulverised."
They all excitedly trooped outside, after getting bundled up, and Harry picked up a random book off the end table to flip through it.
Draco sat beside him at dinner the next night too.
"Why did you come to
He hadn't realised quite how much it had
He closed his eyes again, and took several deep, slow breaths, which made the murmuration of starlings undulate in a truly fascinating way — not that that was where Harry's attention was focused, of course. "Okay. Okay. Uhm...okay." He opened his eyes again and stared at the ring. "Right. Okay. So, I'll wear it. You're right:

"'Mione's not trying to, it's just concerning how withdrawn you've become. We've given you space for over three months now, and you seem worse off, if anything! We just want to help you, mate; you're not in a good place."
"I'll be sure to remember that," he returned sarcastically, and opened the door. "Hey guys!"
"Are you sure? You always look exhausted and annoyed," a Gryffindor cut him off.
Rodya could be rather imposing when they had a mind to be — they were very tall and had a strong nose and solemn face that easily lent itself to scowling. Not that they actually
"Come here." Draco turned and grabbed Harry about the waist, dragging him so they were spooned closely.
"So I've gathered."
"Sorry Rodya," Draco was blushing as he sat down at the table next to Zylphia and gave her a small wave hello. He hadn't come over too many times in the few years since he'd become friendly with Zylphia, but Rodya had been unfailingly warm since their first meeting, and it was very sweet the way they tended to fuss over him. "I've been very busy, work and...stuff you know."
The corner of Draco's mouth pulled up. "Still, it doesn't hurt to hear."

"You're joking. Please tell me you woke me up in the middle of the night to play a joke so I can castrate
There was a short, awkward silence — a rarity in the Burrow — as everyone just watched, before Molly finally said "Well...happy Christmas, then," to Draco with a plastic smile.
"I resent the implications of that wording," Harry responded whilst he was pulling the robes over his head.
"Don't fancy thinking about Malfoy naked either," Ron said, sipping his beer.
"It's nice to see you. I'm sorry things are so difficult for you, what with the gawking looks and things. I'll do my best to keep the younger Gryffindors in check."
One of the stall doors opened and there was the sound of someone washing their hands. Harry waited a few moments, but there were no footsteps leaving the room.
Harry attempted a grin and shook his head, hoping that Draco would drop it. Fuck. Draco pulled him closer by the hips and starting grinding on him, and
"You're so dramatic."
Harry lay back and, having gone through everything else in his head, he began sorting through the effects of the war that he was responsible for, and how much he still needed to pay. None of it really made sense — how could he quantify what exactly the payment should be for the loss of one life and how those payments may differ? And yet he did.
The spring holidays had just ended, and Harry was in good spirits after being able to spend so much extra time with Draco. They'd even visited the Burrow again for Easter Sunday, and Molly had been elated.
Harry hadn't the faintest idea
"It's alright," he answered hesitantly. "Sucks having to do schoolwork again, but it's also kind of nice to be back, you know? Besides all of the reminders of dead people, that is," he scoffed.
"Thanks. The library's oddly busy."
Hermione sighed, but stayed silent.
"Okay, well, are you okay? Nev— I mean Professor Longbottom hasn't said anything, but Professor Malfoy said you were all acting similarly in his class."

Afterward, when Harry's brain was finally catching back up on how to
"Yes, shield me from the horrible sides of the real world. I certainly can't handle it," Harry replied drily.
Harry tossed his glasses and wand onto the bedside table, and kicked his shoes off. Draco waved his wand lazily and the room went dark as Harry settled under the covers, almost immediately slipping into unconsciousness.

The woman's eyes widened. "Who—"
"Gentlemen!"
Draco's eyes lit up. "Merlin, is that even a question? It's been years, and I honestly doubt I've been seeing the best selection at that old place on Baule Row."
"Pity, Malfoy. It was the least I could do, considering the students vastly prefer my teaching to yours."
Speaking of which, he'd had a somewhat eventful day so far, and it was only just now becoming evening. He was now officially an apothecary assistant. How odd. He would've never guessed this was what he'd be doing instead of being an Auror.
He looked up hesitantly, and was surprised to see Hermione covering her mouth and Ron trying to smother a grin.
Harry went to bed drunk that night, but more happy and comfortable than he'd felt in a long, long time.
"'S it a book?" He asked around the candy cane in his mouth, looking at the flat, rectangular package.
Perhaps an hour passed before Harry heard the unmistakable sound of a massive crowd of students plodding up the stairs to the seventh floor. He stood reluctantly, and the first prefect came into view.
And how could he say no? Even the most ridiculously aggravating parts of Draco, Harry still found endearing.
Fuck. If they were supposed to be going to this New Years thing and it was a tradition of Draco's, then he couldn't just

" Draco doused his reading light and put his wand aside, pulling Harry close. "See? Would you really rather me already have been asleep? Now we get to cuddle."

"What, do you think I just enjoy making this shite up?" It was still a bit snappish, but he was beginning to feel more level-headed as Harry calmed and as he focused on his breathing.
"Yes. I'm right, aren't I?"
Harry shrugged confusedly. "I mean...yeah?"
Zylphia snorted and shook her head. "A couple of thick-headed idiots, the both of you."
Harry shrugged. "Yeah, they're pretty thick."
Harry heard the rummaging pause.
And then Luna had decided to hire a sports reporter (after a horrible attempt at trying sports reporting herself that Ginny couldn't stop laughing about trying to retell).

"You're ridiculous," Draco smiled, allowing Harry to kiss him on the mouth.
"Ship?" Draco questioned.
Harry cast a few cleaning charms over the kids, and they both collapsed into giggles, saying that it tickled. Of course then one of the Exploding Snap cards decided to live up to its name, exploding and sending the whole house of cards tumbling down, and singeing the ends of some of Dominique's hair.
Draco glared at him, and then paused when he turned back to grab his wand. He brought his hand closer to his face...huh. It was clean already, and he could feel his boxers were too.
"My...boyfriend?" It ended up coming out more like a question. Mostly he was just confused about how taken-aback this shopkeeper was. He can't have been
The tiny room that was meant to be a cupboard looked even more sad when Draco didn't really have his heart set on brewing. It was one of the few things that sometimes made him miss that god-awful manor — there was just no bloody space in this flat to have a proper potions setup.

"Oh well excuse
"Happy Christmas," Harry said quietly, grabbing his hand to press a kiss to the back of it.

Draco did, indeed, look annoyed at that moment.

"I know. I know, and he knows, and he's not seeking forgiveness for any of that. But he's not his father. You know I hated his guts when we were younger, I get it. But he's a different person.
Draco thought for a moment. "Might as well, I suppose."
He'd managed to pretend for the kids for nearly an hour, but now that he wasn't in front of them, his anger and exhaustion was hitting him all at once, and he was just
"What's your name?"
They stood, chest to chest, swaying in place to the strains of music from inside.
They stumbled through the Floo one after the other, and went straight to the bedroom.
"I mean, you don't have to. We can stay here if you really want, I'm not going to leave you alone on Christmas. I just don't want you to say no just because you're afraid they won't like you. That's why I talked to Molly first, and nobody's going to give you a hard time, I promise. Teddy and Andromeda were already planning to go away on holiday for Christmas this year, so you won't even have to worry about them. I really think if you give them a chance they'll love you, and...I just want you to be able to be with family on Christmas." Harry shyly looked up from staring at the fork he had aimlessly been twirling during his speech. "So? Will you consider it?"
After that, history was turned on its head, and Harry had saved Draco's life, then Narcissa had saved Harry's. It hadn't even seemed like an option
Draco smiled at how apprehensive he sounded, and entered the classroom as the students began to leave.
Harry's eyes sparkled with amusement as he, never one to back down from a dare, leant forward, holding Draco's gaze, and licked the frosting from his finger.

It wasn't too terribly long before there was stirring from the bed across the room.

to find a way to murder him."
"What do you mean?"
"Did you— did you, er, want to go?" he finally asked.
It seemed quite nice though, and he was looking forward to starting the next day: he'd have a job where he was physically working, but where that work was also somewhat relaxing. A mechanical sorting, cleaning, dicing, siphoning — that was all he had to do. Plus, it would be calm, and he needn't worry that reporters were going to spontaneously bombard him.
"What do you mean
"My cousin? How is he? He must be about...eight now, right?"
Draco looked unwillingly mollified, which was quite an interesting expression to witness.
Harry shoved a hand roughly through his hair and caught his breath. "Yeah, sure."
"Right." Harry looked back down at the invitation. "The first night's on Sunday, shall we go then? I've work on Monday, and we're meant to be doing that get-together with Zylphia and Rodya Tuesday night."

, that is not normal Malfoy-Potter behaviour. Do you know how long we hated each other for? The only way we can communicate is through antagonising each other." He looked at Draco for affirmation.
Well then. He couldn't say he'd ever imagined that Draco could cook. This could be interesting. Not that he actually believed for a second that Draco had 'accidentally' made too much food.
"Hello my sweet boy," he cooed at the owl, and Harry rolled his eyes at the ridiculous coddling. He had loved Hedwig quite a lot, but...Draco really took it to a whole other level.

wouldn't want people to think a Malfoy needs someone else to pay for his things," he returned as he set the books on the counter. At the name Malfoy, the counter attendant had widened their eyes and looked more closely at Draco. Draco saw the moment the worker realised who he was, and quickly dropped his left arm to his side, turning the inside against his hip so it couldn't be seen. He watched the cashier's eyes dart quickly between him and Harry. They looked as if they wanted to refuse Draco service, but he was clearly with
Malfoy's eyes darted back up from the counter to Harry's face, and his brow crinkled. "Now?"
"Okay, okay sorry. So what happened?"
"Oh please,

Draco's eyes blinked back open. "Hmm? Does what?"
"I wouldn't doubt it," the Seventh Year said gleefully.

Harry covered his face with his hands. "You are

"I...I didn't realise it was so bad." Harry still looked shocked.
"Oh Harry!" Draco called, in a falsely cheerful, sing-songy voice.

"Oh Harry," Hermione said. "First of all, that was unbelievably stupid."
"Yeah. But that's somehow not even the worst part."
"I'm going to. I am, really. Just...I'm scared and I can't help putting it off."
"Well how am I supposed to— ! Mincing Merlin,

"Well, I'd be interested in the job, if you'd consider me."
He shrugged Draco off of his shoulder, and made a shooing motion with his hand, ignoring Draco's comment. "Anyway, I don't care what you say, you're falling asleep on me, and I

Draco slid fluidly off the desk, ignoring the pieces of parchment that fell to the floor, and sauntered around to Harry's chair. He placed his hands on the armrests, caging Harry in, and leaned forward. "Well you
"Just tired," he responded automatically, before biting his tongue. Shite, he hadn't meant it to sound like that.
Draco's breath hitched and he nodded, letting out a breathy "Yeah."
"I don't know if I want it sometimes. It's all so...it's hard to describe. I don't know."
"How was your holiday?" Zylphia asked, when he slouched through the front door of the shop —
"Excellent."
It had been nearly a month since That Night, and things had definitely died down. Neither him nor Harry were doing anything particularly Valentine's Day themed in their classes, so there should be nothing to bring any attention to them. At least, he hoped not.
He helped Harry to standing and promptly turned him around, pressing his front flush against Harry's back. Draco reached around and slowly started to stroke him. "Isn't that better?" He grazed his teeth over Harry's shoulder, producing a moan.
"You realise you're going to need to explain a bit more in order for me to understand what in Merlin's name you're talking about?" Ginny asked wryly, when he sat back as if done.
"Potter?"
"Don't be ridiculous," Draco said, failing entirely to explain just how

Hermione laughed. "You call him mate?"

"I told them to go back to their dorms, it's not my fault they're nosey little bastards. It's too bloody early for this." Honestly, Harry had barely been awake this whole time — how was he supposed to somehow know everything?
Rodya pursed their lips. "Hm. Well tell me, what have we gotten into now? Not war things being brought up again, I hope?"
about sarcasm."
Maybe someday he'd fix it up, but as of now, he hadn't the motivation, and even though he knew it was what Sirius would've wanted (if burning it completely to the ground were not an option), he had the feeling that trying to do so would feel like he was stripping away the last essence of his godfather that remained there. It was much better to keep Grimmauld Place in the abstract and not think too hard about any specific things to do with it. Much better to think about concrete things instead. Presently relevant things.
"Honestly, I didn't mean it that way, but you've got to move on. It's been almost a year now, I mean she's moved on—"

Draco sighed exasperatedly. "Do yours?" He brought his hand up to trace the jagged, pale, branching lightning pattern on Harry's forhead and then dropped his hand to run his fingers over the similar one in the middle of his chest.

of my tattoos."
"Yes, actually. A group of Third Years told me I make my class so interesting and fun that it doesn't even feel like work — not like other classes, they said. And you know, Potions is another class."
The lift opened and he got out, wiping the exhaustion from his face. He could pretend for an hour. For the children.
On the other side of the wall the students were all very confused at first when their teacher just suddenly
"Oh? I'd love to talk to you about creature's rights, if that's something you're into — you know, animal welfare and all?" Hermione chimed in again. And truly bless her, she was really trying so hard to get along with Draco, and Harry couldn't be more relieved.
"The ghoul?"
They went to a sit-in wizarding bakery in Reading.
“Thank you Harry,” Hermione said, as he hugged them. “That was horribly sweet.”
That's a bit different, isn't it? Like what if they can tell it's not real, or what are we supposed to do when this is all over? What if it gets out that this is all fake?"
Draco moved to the waistband of his boxers.
Bird properly placated, he turned away to put the treat bag back, and caught sight of a very ornate-looking letter on top of one of the neat stacks on the desk.
"Tut tut Harry, is that any way to treat a guest?"
"Why did you kiss me that first time?" Harry asked. "I never figured out why. I was just talking about a long day, and right in the middle of a sentence, you just...went for it out of nowhere."

"Draco! You can't swear in front of students!"
"Technically
The shopkeeper's face twisted, and he (seemingly unconsciously) pulled the ring back toward himself. "Surely you can't be
"Okay?"
He awoke at some point in the early afternoon and stretched carefully. It really wouldn't do to keep sleeping on the sofa in the condition his body was in — constantly plagued with aches and pains, that is.
"Oh, is Harry here?" Molly bustled out of the kitchen.
"Bit dramatic. Hey, you wouldn't happen to have made breakfast, would you? Because I can smell toast and eggs, and
how can you care about someone who bullied you and Hermione and Ron? His
Weasley jumpers were handed around on Christmas morning, and Draco got one too. It was faintly hideous, but at the same time that was somehow what made it charming. His was dark blue with a bright orange D on it, and Draco kind of loved it.
hoped getting eaten out was not a one-time thing.
On a rather related note, he was incredibly surprised he hadn't gone completely grey. He had yet to find a single grey hair, which was perhaps normal for an ordinary 22-year-old, but he didn't think it so for one who had been working on saving the entire world for half of his life.
"Apparently some of the prefects were patrolling and they heard crashing sounds from your classroom and...Peeves sort of...wrecked it."
apparently, because
Oh Merlin, he'd gone and started falling for the guy he was in a fake relationship with. Probably the one person he had no chance in hell with. And how had he not noticed until now?
"What? You too?" Harry sighed. "Apparently everyone thought that last year too."
Harry carded his fingers through Draco's hair as they slowly explored each other's mouths, and Draco's hand slipped up his shirt again, settling in the dip of his waist, his thumb tracing light circles on the side of Harry's ribs.
"Papa."
"Alright, that's enough for today! We'll work on response times and improving counter jinxes after the break. You're all dismissed." Harry quickly restored the few students who were still under jinxes to their normal state.
Unfortunately, his mind seemed to want to gravitate toward his stupid feelings for Harry.
"So they already told you about the rose petals and the hand, but the
"Smells nice. You actually cooked this?"
"I love you too," he said.
After Harry Apparated back to his house, he went through his firecall with Ron and Hermione in a daze.
"Is something wrong?" he asked, concernedly.
Which was, of course, confirmed when Ron grinned and said, "Don't tell me you didn't think it too."
"Your shift's up. I'm closing up after this customer. Don't think I'm gonna pay you more for staying late."
"Yes, thank you. I'll go get Teddy, he'll be thrilled you're finally here."
"Yes. I think I did quite like it. And I...I have feelings for you as well."
Draco resolutely ignored the part of his brain telling him that distancing himself was quite the opposite of his actual ideal scenario.
"You just think you can't make me move."
The upside of these interactions was that at least there was always new music around to play whilst they made dinner.
"Actually, the Sorting Hat told me it was an option. It told me I could be great there."
would've died that horrid, painful death right there with him.
"Excellent point, Bianca. Excellent point. But how to get this out the fastest?"
"That's slightly better."
Harry thought that sounded fantastic. If he cared at all, that was. It wasn't that he didn't
As much as Hermione insisted that the brain was flexible and resilient, and that healing was a process, it was hard for Harry to believe he could ever just be
"Just let me finish Harry," she sighed. "I'm not a fool. I knew things wouldn't just magically be wonderful after the war was over. It's a
"Okay."
Draco sighed, and leaned back with a scowl. "You're deliberately twisting my words."
Harry glared at her, and stuck his chin out defiantly. "Yes.
"Oh, but it makes for at least one interesting class. Didn't you do love potions today?"
"I think Teddy would like you. Do you want to go to the Leaky and catch up?"
They'd called a temporary truce on their ongoing disagreement, saying they would settle it next year when it wasn't so hot. For now, they were labelling it a draw (although both said they were being generous to the other, as
hasn't stopped. So since ignoring it hasn't worked, you want to show them all that you're not their idyllic little golden boy. You're not a life-saving, bad-guy-chasing Auror. You're not getting married to your school sweetheart and rearing another little horde of Weasleys. And now, just to really make the point, you want to date a washed-up Death Eater who's practically been thrown out of wizarding society — and a man at that, because you just know they'll have plenty to say, even if it's not outright condemnation."
It did not stop.
They had been taking things pretty slow, all things considered, but the idea that they might finally be doing more than making out and maybe some heavy petting was...far from disagreeable, to put it lightly.

sure it was spinach) mixture on the bread and ate it once he saw Harry doing the same. He didn't know what the hell was in it, but it was quite nice.
"Don't make me," he said solicitously, grinding against Harry and giving him his best fuck me eyes.
"Hey now, I can be sweet! I gave you chocolates!"
"Harry!" Draco called, even louder, with more forced cheer. "Harry, my love, my dearest darling, light of my life!"
None of them looked like they believed him.
"Mhm, since you ask so nicely," Draco practically
Draco brought their hands up to his mouth to kiss the tops of Harry's knuckles. "Yeah? Was that a possibility before?"
much when he thought he would quite literally let himself be subjected to the cruciatus curse if it made Harry smile like that again.
Instead of moving his hand, however, Harry just let it sit, unable to find the will to move it. He could feel the cold piercingly, which was interesting. The cold enveloped his hand and he focused on the sensation, and felt himself slowly returning to his body. His head still felt quite fuzzy, but he felt
"Draco, I swear on Merlin's name I have never been more sure of anything in my life. I will be fine, please."
"Thank you for warning me that there were still students outside our room," Draco snapped.
Harry turned to see the class watching him through the doorway. He stuffed the note in his pocket, grabbing the essays and shutting the door.
"Anything good?" He asked, looking down at the paper.
They were currently kissing lazily on their sofa, happy to have time to take things slow and relax. The book, which had lain open on Draco's lap, slipped off and tumbled to the floor, but he seemed to pay it no mind.

Harry pulled back to kiss him on the lips.
"I will make my announcements brief: Welcome First Years, and to all the rest of you, welcome back. The forest on the grounds is forbidden, and students are not allowed inside unless specifically instructed by a professor. Mr. Filch has asked me to remind you that a list of items forbidden in the hallways can be found on his door, and that
And then Harry was being dragged to yet another conversation way above his head. Although it was almost a relief when it was conducted entirely in German, as at least Harry had a
Harry laughed. "True." He pulled their hands, which were already intertwined on top of the table, up toward him and pressed a kiss to the back of Draco's.
"I'm sorry, I don't have anything to give you."
"Well, we smuggled her in — don't tell Minnie — and we usually just lock her in a broom closet. Or leave her in the forest sometimes. What do you
"Aren't you just the sweetest little man? You are, aren't you?"
"Thank you." He squeezed her tighter.
"Mmm I can smell bacon, I bet hardly anybody else will have gotten into it yet."
would be if I were him.”
The last day before winter holidays had arrived, and Draco didn't have a final class. As a result, once he'd finished adding the boomslang skin to his newest experimental healing draught and set it to simmer, he had nothing to do.
It appeared he had partnered up the Third Years to duel, and the results were varied. Several students were on the floor with wobbling legs, or doubled over with unstoppable laughter. Harry was calmly circulating, casting counter jinxes and telling the students to try again.
He was glad, at least, that May was over. The month that the final battle had taken place had been a hard one for him, even after so long, especially because he was living where it had taken place. And where he and so many others had lost so much. The anniversary of the battle on the second had passed quietly and solemnly.
the constant reminders of the gravity of his past actions, the respite was also a relief.
If it had been up to Ron, they would've been married within a year of the final battle, but of course Hermione didn't agree. She wanted to further her career, and only once she became head of the Muggle Liaison office at the Ministry did she accept his proposal.
"I don't suppose you've much experience working with potion ingredients?"
"One!"
"Yeah, well you're saying that
After a few moments she let go and patted him on the cheek.
When Harry emerged from the back a few minutes later, having finished his duties and tidied up for the day, Zylphia fixed him with a stern look, eyebrows slightly lifted.
"Okay."
"Oh. Erm, sure, just let me..." Draco grabbed his wand and waved it quickly at his hand to clean it, and then at Harry's to slick it with oil.
must have led you in here! Cartwright's Chains and Charms has all the finest jewellery around. Craftsmanship you just can't find other places these days, you know!"
Harry squeezed his hand. "Even at the very worst, you'll still get to have plenty of Molly's wonderful cooking," he assured him.
"Well she made it pretty clear that we have to be civil to each other regardless," Draco replied snarkily.
that he was 'The Saviour' or whatever; he'd still cost so many people so much. So many lives, so many people's sanity and health. The people closest to him he'd hurt the most. The family he considered his own was missing a son. His godson was missing both of his parents. Teddy would never even remember them, and it was all due to Harry. The wax understood. It didn't treat him differently because of who he was — it gave him his proper dues.
? You're sure, Harry? Do you feel sick?"
life out of nowhere.
Harry actually had
help him. He didn't know if anything could help him. Harry had been very prone toward feeling lately that maybe he was just past help.
Draco pulled back, still chuckling. "We're in a bakery, let's not traumatise the workers."
Harry seemed unbothered. "We slept in the same bed last night. You don't have to agree if you don't want to, it was just a suggestion."
"But it's
"It's not exactly
Besides, whilst he was excited about the next day's plans, he wasn't
"Yeah, okay. Well, I'll see you in Defence Against the Dark Arts, then?"
The rough tree bark scraped against Draco's back through his robes. It was utterly indecent what they were doing — they were certainly too old for this sort of thing — but here he and Harry were, snogging frantically in the Forbidden Forest. They weren't even far enough in to guarantee they couldn't be seen.
fucking friends,
"Lovely to catch up! Ta!" Hermione waved over her shoulder, and the pair made their way over toward the Floo. Harry could've
Harry paused. Oh. Right. "Well, it was
Draco scoffed. "Well they're not meant to be
Harry coughed. "...No?"
Draco, for his part, didn't think he could ever tire of being allowed to tease Harry all of the time now. Their competition about who was the better teacher had not at all diminished. In fact, it may very well have gotten worse.
As he walked along the dark corridors, he began to trail his hand along the wall. It was comforting and grounding to feel the cool, rough stone keeping pace with him as he made his way farther and farther into the dungeons. The slaps of his footsteps echoing in the face of the complete silence that covered everything else was nice as well. He felt so alone, but in a peaceful way, which was completely foreign to him. He pondered this new feeling of calm aloneness and then let it go. His mind was staying surprisingly quiet, and behaving for once. Whilst he felt he deserved — and even to a degree
"I told you not to call me those things!"
been laced with something after all...well, it might have been worth it for the taste.
Harry nodded and tilted his face up for another kiss, which Draco obliged with a chaste peck. Harry pulled him back down for a deeper kiss, threading his fingers through his hair, and sliding their tongues together in a way that made Draco moan quietly.
"So, if everyone except Harry, like, actually wants you dead...why do you want to go back?" Missy finally asked. "What did you even do?"
"Is the journal professionally bound?" Draco asked sarcastically.
Ron just sighed, refusing to rise to the bait.
Draco bit his lip, and placed the vase down firmly. It would be fine. He had been meticulous — no roses, nothing 'love colours', and nobody else was even likely to see it.
"Is there a reason you're interrupting my class?"
that hinted at a love life was covered extensively.
"I'm going to be a bit late, can you cover for me if anybody asks?"
Draco hesitantly picked up the ring from Harry's hand and stared at it closely. "It's very...pretty," he forced out, like the sentence pained him, before taking a deep breath and slipping it quickly onto his right index finger and shoving his hand under the covers so he couldn't see it. He felt the damned Snitch tattoo flutter down to the ring, and he clenched his fist.
"Did you get takeaway?" Draco sniffed. Whatever it was it smelled good, and he was starving.
Harry smiled and kissed his cheek again, before letting him go and turning back to Ron and Hermione.
Harry made a frustrated noise. "Then we won't let them. We've been trying way too long at this, this is ridiculous."
Ron beamed. "If you're offering!"
"I'd just like you to give him a chance. I understand you're wary, and you just want what's best for me, but I think if you just give him a chance you won't be disappointed. He makes me so happy, and I just want you to be able to see that."
"So he is nice, yes? He treats you well?" Rodya asked.
Excited whispers erupted around the room. He truly hoped this class could handle it; they were a small one, even with all of the houses combined. Draco only accepted the highest O.W.L. marks for Advanced Potionmaking.
"I bought a cookbook!" Harry grabbed a book from the counter and held it up for a moment so Draco could see.
"Ah, sure. You're in such a good mood without a thing causing it because you're such a cheerful chap."
Harry breathed a sigh of relief as he managed to successfully retrieve the letter without injury.
"Sure, sure," George said, waving a dismissive hand. "Go rescue Ange from Mum's clutches. I know she'll want to join the game."
He skimmed his teeth up Harry's neck, before pulling back to admire the love bite. He wasn't able to admire for long, though, before Harry was seeking out his mouth again and flipping them over.
"This is the tackiest holiday of the year, and it's time it should be put out of its misery."
with the Malfoys, and — oh Merlin, this was a truly awful idea, wasn't it.
He dropped the mangled toast fragments, deciding he was done, and poured himself a cup of tea. Whilst he waited for it to cool, he pulled out his schedule. He hadn't looked at it when he'd gotten it, and had merely tossed it aside. Now, he supposed, would be a good time to look. The first thing he saw when it was unfolded was that all of the Eighth Years would be sharing classes. Harry groaned internally. The last thing he wanted was more people around all day — and people who
Harry rolled his eyes again. "Of course I
Harry let out a surprised laugh. He wasn't quite sure what it was that made Draco's insults funny to him now instead of making him angry, but it probably had a lot to do with the truce. And being tired.
"Fine. We can talk about this again later. Back to the actual thoughts."
Taking a deep breath, and tossing a large pinch of Floo powder into the flames, he stuck his head in and announced, "Granger-Weasley residence!"
They quickly readjusted so that Harry was on his back and Draco was sat astride him. Draco lined himself up, and slowly sank down on Harry's cock, and— ah, he could definitely see why people did this. This was completely different than how it normally felt, and not at
They went down to breakfast together, just as they always used to — but now if they'd just been snogging fifteen minutes before, no one had to know. They often hung out with Neville in the small front room of Harry's quarters, and life was amazing.
When Harry had finished looking at the plans for some of the new products and talking about the shop, he had gone back downstairs, only to discover that Ron and Draco were
"Thanks mum." He kissed her on the cheek and took his exit.
besides Quidditch for the last…I dunno, six months since we talked? Merlin, did we really let it go that long?"
"Well great, thank you for your insightful input."
"Not that I should've expected anything else, but why aren't you asleep?"
"Happy Christmas." He said back. "Now start unwrapping your presents. You've got a veritable mountain of them."
"Shut up and get back up here."
"Sorry," he muttered, and Draco simply nodded.
"Oh, it's good. Do you usually cook like this?"
"Oh for fuck's sake," he muttered.
"It's Peeves, sir; he's wrecked the Potions classroom. We were on patrol, when we heard all this crashing and when we went to go investigate, well...it's a complete mess."
"Er, no. George was just trying to convince me to set off more fireworks, and I was telling him that would be terribly insensitive to you, considering how much effort you put into the holiday."
"Septima, really? You couldn't think of anyone better?" Draco snickered.
"What happened, why did it end?"
"Mm fine, but see if I—"
"And I was thinking...it's not like either of us can date whilst this is going on, and I mean you don't have to, just if you wanted, it might be nice to sometimes…"
After fielding what felt like hundreds of questions about mobile phones and texting and long-distance communication, Draco finally managed to excuse himself from the conversation.
small paragraph tucked away near the end speculating as to why he was with a new friend that some eyewitnesses had insisted was none other than Draco Malfoy.
There was much fuss and speculation, but ultimately everyone besides themselves and Neville were unsure because they weren't wearing the ring on their ring fingers.
He blushed. “We weren’t
"Of course, of course. You'll be the first to know my dear." Madam Zelinsky patted Draco on the arm, and then excused herself gracefully.
A student raised their hand, and the rest of the room quieted down.
"But it's
. They like you too. They probably like everyone."
He hadn't been wrong, though — they seemed to have employed some serious mental gymnastics to blatantly ignore the most obvious answer. Even their picture-selves were holding hands. He briefly watched them as photo-Harry wrapped an arm around Draco, whilst photo-Draco sneered scathingly at the encroaching reporters.
Ignoring his trunk (it was a mess anyway — he wouldn't bother dealing with it until he had to), he stripped off his robes, closed the curtains on his bed tightly, and cast a silencing charm so he wouldn't need to hear when the other boys came in. Curling up tightly against his pillow, he commenced the staring and thinking for the night, trying to avoid some of the more vicious thoughts in his head. Of course, this did not work. It hadn't yet though, so Harry wasn't surprised.
He came hard onto the floor, still babbling disjointedly. Harry kissed up his back and massaged his sides, waiting for him to be coherent.

Harry didn't go to dinner that night, instead having the house elves bring food to his quarters. He was strangely bothered by his and Draco's conversation.
"I suppose they've gotten the point already," Harry agreed.
Harry had liked the place well enough when he and Ginny had bought it, but now it was just a place to stay. Every time he Apparated back, the house just seemed so tired, like it was in need of something full and vibrant that he couldn't give it.
Harry scoffed, pulling him along toward the house. "Oh come on, they don't hate you
"What the fuck was that?"
"Yes, but
"You know I cannot bear to be parted from you, milaya — and even less so when I know you are in pain," they said, bending down to drop a kiss on her lips.
"I just smacked the injured part of my leg on the desk. It's fine."
"'S not my fault I'm so gorgeous. Or have you been thinking about how you want to fuck me on your desk?"
had he known the truth.
"You don't think they're...you know?" Jamie asked.
In the end, she agreed that it would be nice to get to know him and for him to meet Teddy, but she would prefer if Harry were there as well. Draco had excitedly sent an owl to Harry asking when they could go visit Teddy, and Harry's response had been an enthusiastic 'as soon as possible'.
Draco briefly closed his eyes. "Darling, that makes absolutely no sense. Come to the bedroom."
"That kind of tickles."
"Yes, I would've thought that apparent," Draco stated acerbically.
"Which thing? The alien thing or the cult thing?" Derek asked.
"I'd like to, but things aren't 'like always' anymore."
He cupped Draco's cheek with his hand. "Thank you."
"No. I mean, I do, I just wanted to be sure...things are going to be fine between us, right? It's not going to be awkward tomorrow?"
"And just what is it that's not real, if you don't mind filling me in," she asked, leaning back in her chair behind the counter.
"I just think it'll help. I mean, how can they deny things after that?"
one of my best friends though, Harry, besides having been a couple — which I do hope to again — but being your friend is more important now. You don't need to be afraid of my company because you think I'm going to try to force our relationship. I'm going to give you space, but I will still find and talk to you occasionally, and I want you to feel like you can be comfortable hanging out with me if you need someone."
"You know, you might have thought
"Spoilt," Draco muttered.
"And you should as well. Since when have you needed someone in your life? In school you didn't date hardly at all. You weren't even interested in anyone until Cho Chang, and you only sort of dated for like two weeks! Come on Harry, you know things weren't working out — that's why she wanted the divorce. You guys wanted completely different things from life. You want a lot of kids and that's great, but Ginny doesn't. She doesn't want to be like her mother (not that Molly's not a lovely woman), and she doesn't want to possibly have to give up her spot on the Holyhead Harpies or miss a season for a baby. This job is what she's dreamed of her entire life! She's not going to give that up to have a child she's not ready for. Plus, with her playing professional Quidditch and you being an Auror, how was the baby going to be looked after? You guys would be gone all of the time!"
. We agreed to...you know," he made a vague gesture with his hands, "hook up sometimes, because we can't see anybody else or whatever."
Draco sat on the bottom of the stairs, frantically flipping pages to find his place. When he finally found it, he got up and continued reading on his way to the hospital wing.
"Got to leave room for possibilities. I don't know what it was I expected."
," he corrected (for probably the third time that week), rolling his eyes. "It's not a dirty word."
"Well what do you want me to do, make out with you?" Draco said sarcastically.
"Awesome. You could've just done that from the beginning. It's not like you actually thought any of this would help." Harry walked to the washroom and shut the door firmly.
"Hey, you're the guy who winked at me in the street earlier."
if Harry's big mouth ended up breaking the bloody Statute of Secrecy. At least none of them seemed to have brought up magic — although Derek was adamant that the 'freaky shaking thing' (as Missy had so eloquently described it) was serious proof toward his alien theory. Rob seemed to actually be buying it.
It was stretched nicely over Harry's chest and the tops of his arms. Draco tried to keep his tone neutral. "It's supposed to fit like that. It looks good."
hard. But still, the sentiment was there.
It was almost like a contest for them to see who could get the other completely wrecked first. As it turned out, they both won.
live under a rock.
"Bed?"
"Draco doesn't eat meat," Harry offered, to fill the silence, as Draco searched for a corkscrew in one of the drawers.
Apparently Harry's mind had decided that he'd given enough payment for the moment, and he sighed in exhaustion. He was surprised that he'd actually fallen asleep and dreamt, although he supposed it had to happen every so often. He reached a hand around the bed curtains to grab his wand and lazily ended the silencing spell.
They got to the alley outside and Draco pushed him against the brick wall, apparently unable to keep his hands — or mouth — off of Harry.
"What do you mean
Of course, this place held it's ghosts for him (both literal and figurative), being the site of so many deaths and so much destruction. It was the place where Remus and Tonks had died, leaving Teddy parentless, and it was the place where he himself had died, and where so many had suffered under the Carrows. Still, it felt more like home to him than Grimmauld place had. Or his home with Ginny, which had always felt strangely empty, or (Merlin forbid) number four, Privet Drive. Perhaps someday he would find a place that felt like home — one that wasn't haunted by death and horror — but for now he was complacent here.
"What? Oh— no, it isn't for me. Uhm," he looked down at his hands consideringly. "His fingers are a bit slimmer than mine. I don't know how much. I don't really know how ring sizes work, but can I just bring it by and get it resized if it doesn't fit?"
"Well, thank you Beth. But could you tell me
"Mate, they've been together since Sixth Year."
She handed him a quill from her robe pocket, informing him that it was self-inking, and proffering the book excitedly. He signed it quickly and tried to bid her a courteous goodbye so he could leave before anyone else could get any ideas, but she interrupted him.
He'd barely closed the pillar when Draco was on him.
He reluctantly turned back to see Harry looking with surprise at Missy, who had been reorganising the records on one of the shelves.
? This was ridiculous. He'd be lucky if he got out of this thing with Harry with his sanity even remotely intact.
They, of course, did not notice.
"Ron?" Harry blinked at the sudden light.
"Uh...yeah, great," Ron answered a bit distractedly. His forehead was creased like he was thinking about a particularly complicated problem. "I'll catch you later then."
It didn't take long for both of them to drift off to sleep.
Draco tried to shift himself up slightly for a better angle, and made a startled noise into Harry's mouth as Harry simply pulled Draco on top of him. Harry chuckled and Draco bit his lip in reproval.
Harry laughed at something Draco had said, and she watched as his face become impossibly brighter when he looked at the blonde.
Just as he was thinking this, a promising advert caught his eye. Yes, he just might check the place out. He wrote down the information and decided he'd stop by that afternoon after visiting St. Mungo's. He'd gotten in the habit of visiting several times a week, because if he couldn't work, why not at least do something somewhat impactful?
Draco's breath caught. "Oh. You...want to?"
"We can
"I'm fine. I live on the edge of Muggle London because I spend most of my public life as a Muggle. Which, if you're wondering, is quite a bit more difficult than you may think. Apparently Muggles need 'papers', which, as vague as they sound, are ostensibly imperative. As a wizard, I don't have them, but the man who hired me didn't ask like the others, just pays me in cash. I was told by the other places when I suggested such an arrangement that it's illegal, but what am I supposed to do? Be reborn as a Muggle?"
It was such a silly, simple thing. Just a normal response; certainly not even the nicest thing Harry had said to him. There was really nothing that should have done it, but right in that moment Draco felt himself fall, just ever so slightly, in love with him.
of my students like me. Most of yours probably just cower in fear."
"Hi Harry, Hello Andromeda. You're doing well I hope?"
"Happy New Year!" They all held their wands up, and showers of multicoloured sparks lit up the room.
"Er, yeah? Why not?"
"Well hello," Harry got out between kisses.

"Yeah, yeah. Let's ditch these bloody robes though."

"What?"
"I didn't. Professor Potter was with me."
After two tense minutes the shaking stopped, and Harry opened his eyes, glaring at him. "You know, you're complete shite in crisis."

Draco thought he should by all accounts be irritated by Harry's behaviour, and he sort of was, but the rest of him just found it endearing, which he was also sickened by. He had no business thinking such...soft things about other people.
Draco shrugged. "None of you Gryffindors ever shacked up in the empty classrooms?"
"Would've rather stayed for pudding," Philip sulked.
"It isn't right, and they shouldn't print blatantly false information. It doesn't matter if people agree or not; you were acquitted, and I'm glad you were. You never deserved
Ginny sighed and let her head drop back onto his shoulder. "Yeah, you're right. I just really, really like them, and I don't wanna mess this up."
Arthur had managed to corner Draco into looking at all of his Muggle objects and listening to his speculations about their uses; and after an hour and a half, Harry finally took pity and told them that Minerva had some sort of meeting scheduled that they really couldn't miss.
"I mean, the compartments have different locks if you don't want to mix stuff," the Slytherin boy said confusedly.
Harry started and looked up to see Zylphia standing in the doorway.
"You," Harry announced, once they were in the kitchen, "have awfully low self-esteem for such a wonderful person." He shook some baking soda into a glass, and then filled it halfway with water from the tap. "You're kind of difficult not to love. You've charmed all the Weasleys,
Percy choked on his orange juice.
Draco couldn't help the smile that crept onto his face, and he placed his hand on Harry's knee under the table. Harry's hand joined his and intertwined their fingers.
Internally, Harry felt a bit sorry for being horrible, but he was irritable this morning, and hopefully they would continue leaving him alone this way. He just wanted to be
Draco brushed the little paper hearts off of his hair and robes.
After two and a half hours, Harry threw the parchment he was reading onto his desk and rubbed his eyes.
"Me? Is
"...Malfoy?"
Harry had a very intense battle in his mind, which began with 'IT'S STILL MALFOY!' and ended with 'Oh, fuck it. He doesn't have to know, and we're both just here to get laid.' And then he was asking Draco to come home with him and they were leaving the club.
Harry quickly backtracked and reread the paragraph.
Draco nodded, and they stepped outside back into the reporters who had been dutifully waiting outside. Apparently they'd taken that time to compose what seemed like hundreds of questions, which were all being asked at once. Harry grabbed Draco's arm and drew him close before turning on the spot and Apparating them onto his front step.
Draco did his best to create some suction whilst nearly choking.

"Anything good?" Harry asked, and Draco started.

Harry once again nodded, and Ron responded enthusiastically, bounding over to hug his girlfriend. They weren't particularly bad about public displays of affection, and Harry was happy for them, but it was still a bit odd sometimes when they did something overtly coupley. Hermione wrinkled her brow in concern as she shot Harry a questioning look over Ron's shoulder. Of course she had noticed that Harry was off this morning — then again, wasn't he always off nowadays? He looked away, pretending not to have seen her.

Harry shook his hand.
"Oh, hey Harry. Yes actually, but I have more important things to talk to you about first."
And it was true, this was
, hm? Well let's hear about the lucky lady! She must be something quite special for you to be buying a ring so quickly!"
Harry spluttered and coughed for a few seconds, until the coughing turned into laughter, drawing several eyes from around the room.
"Don't call me that! And I didn't think you were up to anything, I was just wondering why you were up here in my way, messing up my things, when your classroom and everything is in the dungeons," Harry responded hotly. Hermione's way might have seemed good in theory, but Malfoy was just such a snarky bastard!
Contains explicit sexual content only AFTER  the fourth break (directly after the students in the library)
He groaned, only half awake, and was rewarded with another kick. He groggily reached down to grab at Harry's leg, in hopes of preventing another kick.
He tried not to get his hopes up at the slight note of jealousy he thought he'd heard in Draco's voice.

The man had obviously assumed he was shopping for an

"Come on, seriously. I feel like I'm not doing my job right if I just let you guys not participate. There hasn't been a single raised hand today. None of my other classes are like this, so is there some Gryffindor/Hufflepuff feud going on that I don't know about? What do I need to do?"

"Yes, Neville! Don't be daft. Firstly, we're both male. Secondly, we hated each other for

"Right. Fine." Draco tried to extracted himself from where he had apparently wrapped a leg around Harry's waist. He pushed up on Harry's chest. "Fancy moving?"
"I will say this once and one time only. I will not entertain gossip and/or silly rumours in my class. My personal life is of no relevance to you, as I made clear at the beginning of this year and last year. That does not just apply to questions about the war or my past. There will be no more questions or conversation about anything except for Defence Against the Dark Arts. Specifically Kappas. Now, since these creatures tend to dwell in..."

There was really no need for that.
"Alright, alright. I'm off to have saucy dreams about what your face will look like when I fuck you, then."
“Thank you, Luna,” Draco said, sincerely. “I am too.”
"To the library. We forgot something in Gryffindor tower if he asks," Ben said, heading to the stairs.
Draco heaved the most put-upon sigh, and Harry rolled his eyes.
in the middle of a conversation and closed himself in his office.
Harry slicked the rest of the oil onto himself, and pressed forward. Draco's body resisted a bit at first, and when he was finally partially inside, he stilled. Bloody hell, it felt wonderful, but he tried to push the feeling to the side for the moment.
Every year since they had received the book, Harry and Draco had made a special point to go out of their way to frustrate the Seventh Years. They would drop hints here and there, and always act confused afterwards, refusing to confirm anything.
"So then what's the problem?"

Draco had proposed to Harry on Boxing Day, and the rings were connected magically in such a way that when Draco slid the ring onto Harry's finger, an identical ring had appeared on his own finger. They could not be removed unless the engagement was broken off, or when their wedding vows were spoken. Then they would be able to move their engagement rings onto the same finger as their new wedding bands.

"Are you ready? Can I fuck you?" Harry whispered, thrusting into his hand.
When Draco came back to his classroom half an hour later, it was in uproar. His shoulders sagged in defeat, not feeling up to looking formidable and scolding them. He walked through the students, who quieted as he passed, to the front of the room where he slumped into the chair behind his desk.
Their next kiss was minty and entirely guilt-free.
Ginny made a face at the sound, and headed toward the dining room. "Come on, let's save your boyfriend a seat so he doesn't get stuck at the kids table."
"Because I'm clearly the far superior teacher, Potter."
After nearly a month of Harry and Draco shagging almost every night, Harry came into work to see that Hermione had once again let herself into his office.
"That speaks volumes." Draco mumbled into the pillow.
"Great intervention guys, but I think I'm going to go off to bed now." Harry stood and strode out of the Great Hall. He could feel the hundreds of pairs of eyes on him, and hear the speculative gossip begin. Whatever. He just wanted to wrap himself up inside of his cosy Hogwarts bed and settle in for a long night of staring at the bed hangings. Alone. In silence.

"Good morning, Sir Nicholas." Draco rolled his eyes where he trusted the ghost couldn't see, and kept walking. He dearly hoped the ghost wouldn't follow after him, as they were often wont to do.
"Yeah... Well...no. I don't know." Draco pushed himself forward off the wall. "Can't exactly
As soon as Harry had left the Great Hall, he'd been impatient to get to the room. For likely the thousandth time in his life, he cursed the ridiculous stairs in the castle, and tried to speed up his pace without being obvious, lest someone saw him.
"Are you kidding me?" Draco cut him off furiously. "Pull your head out of your arse, Harry! I'm trying, that's the point of all this," he gestured between them, "but it's still a fucking pipe dream! I'm fully aware it might never happen, you're just my

Well, he didn't actually want to spend hours on a stuffy train with no one he knew and a bunch of gawking children, but he was taken in by the idea of doing things just like old times. In the end, it was silly nostalgia come years too late. He Apparated from Grimmauld Place (which he had managed to clear out a bit more in the past year, although it was still admittedly rather forbidding) straight into Hogsmeade, and walked up the the castle.
!" A Seventh Year Gryffindor boy had leaped up and grabbed them both in a hug when they entered the Hall.
"Oh, hey Harry!" She looked up brightly. "We're just playing Exploding Snap, do you wanna join?"
"Damn. Well colour me impressed."
"Yesterday Draco came into my class for some help with a dark object Minerva found; but when he came in my heart did the flippy over thing, and I don't think that's good. It doesn't normally do that, but it has before and I usually feel all warm and smiley. I don't know Neville, but this is not good."
"Right. So have you got any etiquette books lying around? And would now be a good time to tell you that I don't know how to dance?"
practise jinxing other students under the guise of studying for my class," he added quickly.
About the time Bill and Fleur took their leave to put the kids to bed, Harry started nodding off heavily. After about five minutes of nearly being smushed under the ever-farther-leaning dead weight, Ginny pushed his head off her shoulder.
“When did you do that?”
"Hello, how can I— Oh! You're
then, and not your head of house?" This was exactly why he would never accept the responsibility of that role. Horrid. Only one of them was even a Gryffindor, he noticed, much to his disgruntlement. There was no reason they should've been here.
The students who had been in potions compared Professor Malfoy's reluctance and Professor Potter's exuberance toward the Valentine's Day lesson plans. A few of them exchanged glances and smirks, connecting the dots for themselves (regardless of the fact that there wasn't actually meant to be a picture in them).
"Yes, Hufflepuffs are almost right in front of them, so what happened? I saw confetti or something when Professor Malfoy sat down, and then they left early. Well, they left separately, but it was soon enough, I'm sure they just thought they were being sneaky," another Gryffindor contributed.
Draco looked utterly mystified. "For what?" he asked quietly. Harry said nothing. "What are you thinking about? You look so sad."
Harry pulled his plate back toward him as well. "Too true."
"Because he obviously doesn't, and this whole thing has been under a false pretence because I wasn't actually supposed to feel anything for him and that changes the context of everything, but I still didn't say anything!"
"Do they hurt?" Harry murmured.
Harry stopped reading to glance at the bird.
"You're always here and at my mercy," he sniped, kissing down Harry's neck.
He was properly exhausted after dealing with the reporters and that shopkeeper, but it was a Sunday, so he'd feel guilty not going to see the children like he always did. He would just have to try and make it a short visit.
Harry pulled back, stilling. "You okay?"
"Was there a compliment somewhere in there?"

the monster that was Lucius Malfoy. When it came to his part in the war, he hadn't had much more choice in matters than Harry had — and whilst he'd boasted about his Dark Mark at first, his fear and regret became evident fairly quickly. And then he hadn't turned Harry in to the snatchers, and Harry had taken his wand, without which he couldn't have done much at all.
"You stopped. Keep petting my hair."
Harry laughed and leaned in to kiss him. "Gracious of you," he muttered, in between kisses.
He sighed. "Alright, well I'm done with everything, am I good to go?"
"Good morning!" George called out obnoxiously, "I'm glad Harry finally learned how to use a silencing charm!"
"Oh thank you, you didn't have to." Harry broke into that breathtaking smile, and Draco couldn't help but smile back.
"Yeah, I understand that. How are you doing with all of the people? I know you were all closed away this summer, so that's a big change."

," it came out as an exhale, but Harry was fairly sure he got his point across, as he could feel Draco slicking himself up behind him.
"I already know you're a wizard, Draco. Just leave it."
Mrs. Weasley walked into the room.
Draco shook his head, and grabbed his wand off the bedside table. "I knew I should always make time for the paper, no matter

Harry pushed one of his fingers in uncertainly.

"Hmm, that's depressing." Draco paused. "Then again, so am I; so really this could just be your way of flirting?"
saying it's easy to say we would've done better in his situation, but we just don't know.
Ignoring his sarcasm, Draco continued. "That means gifts...surprises."
Draco came back into the room and offered harry a plate of scrambled eggs and a fork.
Harry watched as Draco sat down next to him and a gentle shower of red and salmon rose petals fell over him.
Harry grinned. "Now would be the perfect time." And he kissed him.
Harry had long lost himself to thought, when something jostled the curtains of his bed. He peeked his head out of the curtains to see Seamus and Dean stumbling across the room. At first he thought they had devolved into a physical brawl, but no they were...kissing. Oh. Harry ducked back inside the safety of his curtains. He didn't know how to feel. Was this a new thing? He supposed it must have been, or otherwise they would have told him, right?
"Suit yourself," George said, and then turned back to the kids. "Do you want to go watch everybody play some Quidditch?"
"I didn't go to the hospital wing because I'm sure I'll be fine tomorrow. And I was...attacked," he fabricated quickly, "by a dark creature in the Forbidden Forest. That's why you should never go in there alone."
The angle was awkward, but it didn’t take too long before Harry was finishing with a shuddering groan.
He scribbled out a quick
"I love you," he said in Harry's ear.
Draco opened his mouth as if to speak, and then shut it again. Seeming to decide on a different course of action, he finally responded. "Nothing in particular. Just...keep that in mind."
Harry rolled his eyes at Draco's response, and went into his office. Draco followed and casually sat himself on Harry's desk, leaning back on his hands on top of all of Harry's papers and crossing his legs. Harry sighed and leaned back in his chair.
"You"ll be learning many of the same things as the Seventh Years, but I think the class will be less structured. I'll be much more willing to let any of you take the lesson in any particular direction you may be interested in. More independent work will be encouraged, and you will have more choice on essay topics. You've still got to be prepared for your N.E.W.T.s though, that's why you're here after all. Does that answer your question?"
"Good enough, I suppose. Okay, Apparate us."
He and Draco exchanged confused glances.
Harry kissed him. "No, I really should have thought before I spoke. But thank you." He kissed him again. "I'll mind my words in front of Muggles, promise."
"I think I left my owl there," Draco mumbled into the pillow.
Harry forcibly pushed one of his hands over off of a stack of essays.
Draco shoved him roughly back against the door and kissed him thoroughly.
A shower of pink confetti exploded over them, and the noise in the hall increased exponentially.
A good number of the students were repeatedly failing at jinxing their opponent first, and yet everybody still seemed to be having fun. Hmph. Draco leaned back against the wall. Maybe Harry's classes were fun, but Draco's were still far superior. Even if the students didn't actually appear to be having fun.
Draco pulled up one of his dining room chairs and unfolded the little card table he kept leaned against the wall. He began pulling down jars of ingredients off of the crowded shelves more on muscle memory than an actual plan for what he was going to be doing.
"Hm," Harry agreed. "So I talked to Molly today."
quickly. But at least he didn't seem to be ending everything?
They slowly and silently rang up the books, and Draco gave them the money, deciding not to speak either. It was best not to push things.
"Thought this through, have you?"
"What is it? I'm going insane, what is it I'm doing?" Harry asked hotly.
"Do you want to try something new?" Harry asked.
"Does it look like we're in bed? And anyway, that's the point, it wouldn't really work if it was something I might say anyway, and I doubt I'll be saying flobberworm for any other reason."
"You two were all..." he made a vague gesture with his hands, "and then you were laughing, and you put your hand on his arm!" He pointed at Draco accusingly. "And you were drinking from the same goblet!"
Draco fed him a few treats and gently stroked the side of his face with a finger.

He always appreciated their time together though, even though it had been increasingly rare since they'd broken up and stopped living together. She was so busy with Quidditch, and he was busy trying to figure out what in the world he was doing with his life, and it felt like they hardly got any time to talk anymore.

feel," Draco managed to joke, as he hitched up Harry's robes to run his hands over his bare back. He dug his nails in desperately, when Harry squeezed his arse and pulled Draco's hips even harder against his own.
Harry liked the kids, but whilst he'd always known he wanted children, he was immensely glad he didn't have them yet. He got on well enough with them, and was good at getting them to do what they were supposed to, but he couldn't imagine having to watch over them all day, every day. It was tiring enough for just a few hours. Still, there were quite a few more in the ward than he wanted in his home, and there was still plenty of time yet to develop some semblance of responsibility.

Harry balked. "Well— I mean, the glamours are for privacy, that hardly counts— !"
Ron and Hermione stayed silent, watching him.

pretty positive. Or, well, more neutral, but
Ginny got a devilish grin on her face, and glanced quickly toward the kitchen, and then toward Percy. Once she'd made sure nobody appeared to be listening, she turned her head to talk softly in Harry's ear.
Draco followed silently behind him.
to stop thinking of them for more than a few minutes.
Harry watched photo-Draco staring at photo-Harry and licking his finger. So they'd included that and hadn't said anything?
The other boy looked surprised, but immediately tried to hide it.
"Are you sure?" Draco asked against the side of his neck, punctuating the question with an open-mouthed kiss on the sensitive skin.
"Really? I'll have to keep that in mind." Harry flipped them so that Draco laid on his back. He tugged on Draco's boxers lightly. "May I?"
Harry pounded up harder into him, and Draco screamed as he finally hit his prostate.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Well I agreed with whatever you were saying! It's hard to hear when you're practically eating the duvet."
"Draco! I think she sick and I don't know what's wrong! Poppy had to go out to St. Mungo's for something, and you know I'm pants at medical spells, and Nev is with her right now, but..." Harry babbled frantically.
Harry bit his lip and replied with effort. "I suppose...this arrangement will do for the time being—" He cut the words slightly short with a moan, as Draco nibbled and sucked his nipple, giving his hand a slight twist as he stroked.
"I—" Harry started.
Of course, they probably wouldn't be awake for a bit, but if Harry was quiet, Draco wouldn't be up for a while either.
"I've got to make you useful somehow, don't I? Stand up and take off your pants." He looked Draco up and down appraisingly. "Bend over and spread your legs," he ordered.
. But then, every time they raised their hands, they would ask something along the lines of 'Why was Professor Malfoy in your room last night?'

all the time. Then again, when he was alone his mind was left to take over with no obstacles, and things could get ugly. Although, at least when he was by himself he wasn't hurting people by pushing them away.
Well that wouldn't do. He fixed them with a stern look, and they hesitantly began to scrub themselves. There. He wasn't going to let a few undisciplined dishes make him look like a poor houseguest.
Harry followed him as he left the front room. "All I said was I didn't mind. That makes sense."
"I'm so happy for you, Harry."
"Please tell me you didn't forget to tell me about any food allergies or something," Draco fretted, still pacing the kitchen and stopping to check the oven every time he passed.
"Green."
That didn't bode particularly well for the next few decades, he thought, but at least he felt more awake now.
Harry shifted uncomfortably, looking like he didn't quite know how to say what he wanted to. "So..." he paused again. "Just hear me out first, before you decide anything, okay?"
She laughed. "I'm just messing with you, I know why you do it. Doesn't mean I think this special 'plot' of yours makes a lick of sense, though. Did it ever occur to the two of you that this sort of thing isn't the first thing most people would think of to solve their problems? He could have just asked you on a date like a normal wizard."

Harry shifted on his feet nervously. He'd been stalling in the corner, nervously rearranging jars, not even wanting to look in their direction lest he draw attention to himself. He could hear Zylphia scooping beetle eyes as she and the customer continued to talk. At least they'd moved on from talking about him.
one to talk. The goddamn prince of Slytherin here."
"But you...why didn't you tell us? I mean I didn't even know you we're into blokes."
"Ooh is that one of those brilliant Muggle inventions?" Draco turned to see Arthur Weasley peering down the table with interest at the shiny silver phone in his hand.
"Pfft, so did I. Yours were probably just obligatory pity gestures."
"Did you stay up again?" he repeated.
. Draco had a lot of beautiful tattoos on his skin, and they were undebatably art, so Harry hadn't expected such a bawdy little obviously-hand-done piece, of a racing broom with the words 'FREE TO RIDE' underneath.
Of course, Harry dismissed this as him putting too much stock in silly coincidences. Besides, he was much more excited with his Valentine's Day lesson plans. He planned to talk about Sirens with the Second and Third Years, and objects cast with a dark infatuation spell with the Sixth and Seventh Years. He was thrilled with the fact that the students would be intrigued by the topics,
"I asked for it, didn't I?"
Around March, the students started to notice random, ever increasing absences of both of the professors, always at the same time. Both of them were becoming increasingly moody and stressed, and some of the students started to worry. A few even asked McGonagall if one of them was seriously sick or something. She refused to tell them anything, and the behaviour continued straight through June.
"Guys? What's up? It's been like two weeks and none of you guys really participate anymore. Is it my classes? Have they gotten boring or something? I can change things to make them more interesting if that would help."
Draco primly set a bookmark in his book and put it on his side table. "I was waiting for you."
"Yeah. I mean, how are you, what's happening, what's up?"
Draco was just trying to tread water, so to speak.
“You aren’t that heavy,” Draco said, sitting up and reaching toward the bedside table for his wand. “I can take it.”
"Ta." Draco gave a small wave and Apparated away.
"Really? That's pretty impressive actually. How is it different than the regular one?"
"Do I look like a bloody princess? I'm not going to be locked up in some tower, thanks. I don't enjoy it, but it's not going to stop me if I want to go somewhere."
"Well, I'm can't say I'm surprised," Harry tried to interrupt her, and she held up a hand. "I didn't expect it, but I'm not surprised." She glanced at him out of the corner of her eye. "But
"Well we won't let them. I mean, it's a one bedroom flat — that doesn't leave much room for interpretation."
"Okay, I'm fond of Ron and Hermione, and they make me smile; does anyone think I want to snog either of them?"
since he'd gotten off, and Merlin it felt good. His fingers flexed as he ran his hands over Draco's shoulders and back, digging in when a particular wave of feelings would wash over him.
"Tacky holiday," he muttered, but he couldn't quite keep the smile from his face.
"Right," Draco said. "Although I don't doubt you could."
Draco blushed even darker, and besides the telltale flutter of the Snitch tattoo under his jaw, he swore he felt a flutter in his stomach as well. Stupidly cliché, but he couldn't help it. It had been so casual and simple, clearly no big deal to Harry, but still. He'd said he loved him.

He once again descended the stairs and tied the parchment to the bird, who gave him a smug look (which was either ruined or enhanced by the curry dripping down its beak and into its feathers — it rather difficult to decide) and flew off.
He was trying to be a better godfather and spend more time with Teddy, but the first action game they'd made up ended with him being turned into a Ferret, and the second one had involved them being admiring dragon watchers.

He wasn't entirely certain what he had done without Draco before. Things just seemed right this way: never waking up alone, always with someone there to take his mind off of work and make sure he ate something other than takeaway curry.
Harry glared at her. "
"No — well, I don't know. I just kept repeating 'not Slytherin' until it sorted me into Gryffindor. Don't look at me like that! That's where I thought all the bad wizards were — I obviously know better now, but I hardly knew anything about the wizarding world yet."
Draco groaned and banged his head back on the pillow. "Am I ever going to get to sleep? You were practically asleep yourself a few minutes ago — what happened?"

Harry forced his eyes open again, narrowing them calculatingly at Draco. "I'm more than willing to distract you again."
"I believe I
"Hmm. Yes, but it's okay, I believe the creature's gone now."
Harry tapped him on the shoulder and asked for the password, realising only once he had begun asking that it was Dennis Creevey. He swallowed a lump in his throat and tried not to think about how it was
"It's just that, as healers," Milton said, "we're obligated to pay attention to sudden changes in those around us that might indicate certain spells or potions that may be being used to influence— "
"If I do something somewhat, erm, sexually suggestive right now, is that going to bother you?"
He took a small note out of his pocket, affixed it to the vase with a light sticking charm, and hurried out of Harry's office. It wouldn't do to be seen anywhere other than the dungeons, as he'd slipped away from breakfast early with the excuse that he'd needed to prepare for class.
"I never thought I'd hear you say that either. Isn't she one of the ones who—"
"Mm, but is it really kindness if I'm benefitting from it?" Harry asked as he snaked a hand down to grab Draco's arse and grind his thigh against Draco's cock.
"I was late today because I really,

"Favourite? Really?"
when some of the students had started acting oddly around him, and he'd made it a point to keep tabs on the other curriculum so he could be prepared.
"I can hear you, you know!" Zylphia's voice came from the other room.
"I wouldn't expect you to. It's me, I promise. I'd just like a nice quiet job where I can work with my hands."
"What, are you

now, like some sort of
Harry made a small noise and pressed even closer, digging his fingers in where they pressed into Draco's back as he deepened their kisses. Draco felt Harry's hand trace over the side of his hip to the top of his thigh, and he moved his other leg forward, making Harry groan quietly as it pressed against his groin.
"If you really wanted it? If it would work? Harry, I think you made the right decision in quitting the Aurors. I know they tried to guilt trip you into staying because you're the 'Saviour of the Wizarding World', but you really didn't need all of that stress. And I know you're tired — I mean you've been chasing dark wizards practically your entire life, you've got to give it a rest at some point."
that they're not returning," her tone softened. "I understand, Ron understands, and I know that different people deal with things differently, but it's been awhile Harry and you're not even beginning to try to get better. It's not healthy to be so closed off all of the time. You've got to start trying to branch out again or you're never going to get back to normal."
" They both complained, in unison.
"Harry, is there something going on with you and Draco?"
Hermione lowered her voice, clutching the bottle of wine they'd brought tightly about the neck. "Okay good, because I'm
"Eh..." Harry thought for a moment. "A few?"
"Yes?"
"Do you, um...I can come in tomorrow and Sunday. To make up for the holiday."
"Oi! I've told you before, just cast a silencing charm if it's so bad!"
Harry flipped her two fingers.
"Maybe. I still think they'll just present it as roommates." He cleared his throat and removed his hand from Harry's head.
Harry took a deep breath and briefly contemplated whether or not to tell Ron. No, this was Ron, of course he'd tell him.
Harry rolled out of the way as Draco stepped through into his living room and looked down at him with a poorly concealed smile.
"I still don't know why you think this is going to change anything. They're surely just going to make it into another 'friends' thing." He shut the front door, knowing that wouldn't help much, considering his was the front, ground floor flat, so the press could see right in through the windows if they wished.
Harry took a step back and blinked in surprise. He had seen a lot of judgmental and pissed off owls, but somehow, never one quite so...freely articulate. He began to laugh.
Draco put his hand over one of Harry's and squeezed reassuringly. He shifted his hips experimentally, and oh! That hadn't been quite it, but he had definitely brushed something
He hated how much it tickled when it snorted smoke out like that — oh, and
"I think I remember that! And
Malfoy looked taken aback for only a split second before he nodded.
Harry looked down to see that he indeed had his entire weight on one of Draco's legs.
"What are you doing here?"
"Yes, I believe so."
"Draco. Stop. You're just psyching yourself out more. I'm not saying they're going to forgive and forget everything, but we all have a capacity to move forward. I'm not saying it's all the same, but a lot of us did some awful things, and we've all been through a lot, and we all know that sometimes you just have to let the past be the past. I think you'd be surprised at how much they're willing to forgive or overlook for the sake of peace.
“There are much more discreet ways of eavesdropping than casting a
Draco leaned over to Harry, as Harry watched Rodya feed Bartholomew yet another hors d'oeuvre whilst cooing at him softly. "Sometimes I think they like Bartholomew more than me," he muttered.
Philip sighed and stood up, taking a slice of cherry tart with him. "Let's go, Potter will be way ahead of us now."
"Well, don't forget you have invaluable sneak peeks into the next Sytnikov crime thriller in those letters. Can't just let anybody see these things, you know." They paused. "Although, my editor was not very fond of either of the scenes, so they may not make it in after all, but still precious!" They tapped the side of their head and winked.
"Thank you," Draco said, shaking his hand. George nodded decisively and turned back to the living room.
Ginny closed her eyes and seemed to collect herself.
"Well,
Draco rolled his eyes. "So I heard. And don't worry, they really only know the basics about the war — it wasn't the biggest of news all the way over in Russia. Really, they're like the last person who would fawn over you."
The students convened again in the library after dinner.

"Well. Don't tell mum, but I've been seeing someone. Two someones, actually, and it's— oh, Harry it's going
"Yeah. Yeah." Harry got out before kissing him again. It took several tries, but he finally managed to stop long enough to strip off his robes, and push off his shorts and shoes, then his hands went right back to stroking over Draco's neck and jaw. He trailed his hands down to his chest as they pulled back for air, panting against each other's mouths. Draco ran his hands up and down over the outside of Harry's bare hips, drawing him closer.

"Zylphia closed up the shop early. Bad day," he tapped his leg, and Draco grimaced in sympathy. "Thought we might be able to eat lunch together."
"Thank you, Harry," he said quietly, and then cleared his throat, straightening up. "Well the war's in the past. This fun little scandal is in the present, so what's the plan from here?"
Draco unfolded the Prophet expectantly.
"So how does everyone here feel about badgers?" she said loudly, seemingly changing the subject.
"You okay?" he asked, once Draco had finished heaving.
Harry sighed dramatically and rolled straight onto the floor with a rather loud thump. Draco immediately sat up and grinned down at him childishly. "I made you move."
"Yeah, I am kinda tired. And I'll try to make a truce with Malfoy and put the whole Ginny thing behind me if it makes you feel better."
"Grumpy
Harry laughed.
Draco sighed, and patted lightly at the scales over the side of his belly. Herbert — no,
"Well, I don't want my healing draught to boil over. I'll see you later."
It was lazy and slow and sweet and contented, and Draco was forced to reconsider that potion once again. What would be the point in going to all the trouble to brew it when he had something a hundred times more effective right here? Forget

pretty entertaining.
Harry nudged his arm. "Are they trying to call you in on Christmas?"
Once in the bedroom, Draco pushed Harry back onto the bed and climbed on top of him, positively snogging the sense out of him.
"I mean, I guess." Ron chewed his lip. "I guess it's just we don't really see it a lot."
Harry was impressed. It was one thing to be good at following potions instructions, but it was another to create your own. Especially one so essentially helpful. Truth be told, he was a bit jealous of Draco's skill.
Although this particular group had had a special knack for pissing both Harry and Draco off from the beginning (as well as being the ones that spread ninety percent of the rumours — and facts — about their relationship), the two teachers felt they had a closer connection with them. Of course, that was probably because many of the Seventh Years were constantly lurking (and had been since the beginning of the previous year), and they
“No pressure, of course,” Molly hastily added, leaning past Harry to direct that last bit at Draco, Cho, and Luna.
"So. Couldn't wait until tomorrow to see me?" Harry joked.
Harry was a bit taken aback by the use of his first name and the lack of malice in such a statement, but he responded in kind.
They began the short walk toward the Witch's Veil in an uncomfortable silence.
"I think we made him angry. Do you think he's going to come back for the rest of the lesson?" someone asked.
Harry sighed. "Yeah, but it's stupid."
the only person who could
Harry just got up and left the Great Hall. He thought he may have heard Ron's voice calling after him, but he headed to the nearest bathroom anyway. He needed to get himself together before classes, and Ron would be okay. There was nothing to really worry about — nothing that Ron could help with anyway. The wet sleeve of his cloak slapped against his arm, and he impatiently cast a

"I'm not sure. I'm afraid to look at it again." Another chuckle had slipped past Harry's lips, and he had asked. "Why?"
Draco nodded. “Go for it.”
Draco finally regained enough use of his body to run his hands over Harry in return, kissing him back sleepily. After a few minutes, Harry pulled back, frowning.

"Did he fight off the creature?"
going as planned.
, but they spent most of their time together, and they'd still been hooking up occasionally, and they kissed sometimes, even when nobody was around to see. To be honest, it kind of hurt Harry's brain to try to think about
"Neither have I, I'll come with."
"You're my favourite person, you know that?"
Harry put the record on, and smiled as they fell into their evening routine. It was so reassuring to have a little niche all of his own carved out in the world. To have a person and place and routine to come home to regularly. Maybe it sounded a bit boring from the outside, but, well, he found he
"Well that was certainly...something," Harry laughed.
Harry bit his jaw, right under the ear and sucked a bright mark on it. "You like that too, don't you? You want to be owned, you want everyone to know that you belong to me. I bet you'd spread your legs for anyone just to feel owned like that. Right desperate, aren't you?"
"Oh, er...sure. Is it about one of the kids?"
He decided that casual robes were best (really, who could fault casual robes? They were always appropriate — well, except when they weren't, but he was reasonably sure that was not the case today). Waving his now empty mug onto his bedside table (where a rather large collection seemed to be growing, despite the fact that they could be so easily moved downstairs to the kitchen), he went to shower, hoping that his hair would behave a bit more if it was wet, but knowing it wouldn't.
"No, wait, Blaise definitely told me some...
Harry picked his head up and squinted at Draco, studying his face. "Are you sure? You seem...off. Are

had come from.
Hermione and Ron had sent him a book on cursed object identification, and one on curse-breaking (clearly Hermione's idea), as well as a bottle of Ogden's Old Firewhiskey (Ron's contribution). Ginny had sent him a leather journal, which he thought was nice, all things considered (he had sent her a pretty scarf, unsure if he should send anything at all).
When he got down to the dungeons, he sighed, there were smashed jars and ingredients all over the halls. Great.
"Oh, it's true! It's true!" She laid a hand briefly on Draco's arm. "

“Maybe sometimes,” Harry allowed, smiling. He really wanted to kiss him, but he severely doubted the PDA would be well accepted, so he just patted Draco’s cheek twice softly and slid his hand back to his shoulder.
Harry pried up the elaborate wax seal, and opened it. "Oh, I should've suspected. It's only the invitation to the Ministry Gala. Usually I just bin it."
Draco nodded, grabbing his hand. And then—
Zylphia raised an eyebrow.
"Heart-stopping." He deadpanned.

He'd get so into it, and start reeling off facts like an encyclopædia, using his hands to describe things. Harry loved the fanatical gleam Draco would get in his eyes when he started listing reasoning for a new hypothesis about a certain preparation for thistleberry, or some other thing completely beyond Harry's realm of understanding. It was still September, so whilst it was chilly, it was still comfortable for the three of them to sit and talk outside most evenings.
"I don't know that we need to do all that," Harry laughed nervously. "Just kiss me. If you're okay with it, that is?"
Harry pulled out and grabbed Draco about the waist, turning him on his back, and thrusting back in hard. "Like this?" he asked.
Draco frowned and reached back out to him. Harry sighed. "As much as I'd like to stand here all night, it's freezing, and there may have been some blood warming activity, but I'm still the naked one."
"Draco.
Ginevra seemed likeable too, though, and that was the other problem. Draco really didn't want to hate her, and he couldn't help hoping that what Harry had said before they'd left (about the two of them getting along once she warmed up to him) would be true. But as he watched Harry put a comfortable arm over her shoulders and lean his head against hers — even as he held Draco's hand on the other side — he resented her just a little bit.
"Good." Harry waved a hand and magicked away the mess he'd made, causing Draco to blink slowly in satisfaction.

"Still." He turned toward the door, hoping Harry would follow his lead.
"We should try to get some more sleep," he continued. He let his hand slide off of Draco's cheek, and Draco's brow creased, but he didn't push the issue.

Harry groaned. "Ron is the worst."

"Just talk to him. I want this job to make you happy, okay? You've been so down ever since Ginny and you...well, you need a change of pace, and you can't be happy if you're always fighting with Malfoy."
"I'll bring you off again if it'll make you go the fuck to sleep."
"Draco, you're important to me, and they'll be fine. If worst comes to worst, they'll be on their best behaviour because I won't be there if they won't accept you."
"What's wrong?" Ron asked.
He turned away from the stacks of papers on the desk, and decided to take a shower and think through what exactly he needed to say.
"Why are you just watching me like that? It's uncomfortable."
"He's a better pillow than you anyway," Harry mumbled, resituating himself to curl against Draco's side.
It just wasn't fair. It wasn't fair to Draco to continue on this way, and it was horribly selfish of Harry to have kept on this long under false pretences, when he knew very much that he had been falling for Draco when it wasn't supposed to be real. He should never have started this whole…casual intimacy, and kissing when nobody was around to see business. Merlin,

He walked toward the kitchen and peered in.

“Incorrigible.” Harry slid his hand up from Draco’s shoulder to cup his cheek, and the Snitch tattoo sped up onto his face and under Harry's hand.
He dropped his face into his hands. Ron was never going to let this go.
"Do you think we ought to dance?" Harry asked, once they had excused themselves from the company of Herr Sauer.
"Curiosity won out over the post-sex sleepiness."
"Okay then, you may borrow these two. Please return them within the next two weeks. The top one has general overviews on the classification and identification of most dark creatures, and the other has the best ways to combat them. Both are set up alphabetically by creature."
Harry ran his hand back over the scars. "The curse scars."
They lazily kissed for a while until Harry's arousal became uncomfortable, and he began stroking himself.
"You know, I was really hoping you two would have just
The library was as usual on a weeknight: several students (mostly Hufflepuffs) crowded around tables in the back to study together quietly, and a few others from various houses scattered around or wandering the stacks.
He flopped onto his sofa and covered his face with his hands, focusing on trying to relax the tensed muscles in his back and shoulders. Shortly after he began to doze off, Harry thought he heard a light knock on the door, and jolted upright. He stilled for a minute, and then there it was again.
Things heated up a bit faster than either of them intended, especially as it was currently only dinnertime. And speaking of—
"You think this is it?" Ben asked, leaning close to try and hear anything else.
"S'okay," Harry murmured, kissing down the side of his face and neck until he reached a small inked tide pool just under his collarbone, teeming with fishes and an eel and sea urchins, and even a miniature seahorse.
— you’re shite at public speaking!” Several people laughed at that, and Harry laughed too, making his way over to the bride and groom to hug them.
were clearly the winner).
Draco looked surprised. "Er, yeah. I suppose it was." That hadn't been quite what he was expecting, but he didn't dare get his hopes up.
Harry had, indeed, come armed with a large mug full of strong English breakfast tea, as per Draco's preference. Draco smiled.
"It was still presumptuous. And— wait,
"Shh."
As a student, he'd hardly run into any of the ghosts, but whilst they'd left him alone for the beginning of his first year of teaching, that quickly came to an end.
"It's Peeves, sir, he's wrecked the Potions classroom. We were on patrol when we heard all this crashing, and when we went to go investigate, well...it's a complete mess."
Draco put a hand over Harry's mouth to stop him from talking. "We can stay up or we can go to sleep; either way you aren't going to annoy what I was thinking about out of me. Can we please go with the sleep option?"
He whistled sharply twice, and Bartholomew zoomed in from wherever he'd been roaming, perching neatly on Draco's outstretched arm.
"Oh yeah, like a month ago. I uh...didn't put my glamour up in time, and I kept expecting them to say something about it."
"Hey, Harry! You left without us." She looked saddened by it, even though it was such a small thing. Harry supposed that, combined with yesterday's events, it was understandable that she'd be upset, but he still just wanted to be left alone.
having to be so conscious with food. It was such a simple thing, and yet it wasn't anymore to his body. Months of irregular eating, and skipping meals without much sleep hadn't done great things to his system — which Harry had understood when he was still in the woods on the run, but now it had been quite a while since then and things were still not going back to normal.
— I regretted it eight years ago — but I don't think they're likely to forgive all of that."
Well, dealing with more people regularly wasn't great, but he could cope with it. He just had to keep his head down and stay quiet. Looking back at the schedule he saw that Transfiguration was first. That shouldn't be so bad, McGonagall was kind but strict, and certainly wouldn't allow gossip or people harping on him.
completely still, doing nothing, just sitting. Apparently others thought this was concerning.
“Fuck, sorry,” he said after a few seconds, rolling himself off of where he’d basically collapsed on top of Draco.
"That would certainly help, but with less valerian root, the pH would raise, making the potion more unbalanced and volatile, and possibly harmful to ingest, especially with the addition of the lacewing flies. Could anyone give a solution to that problem?"
is more important right now." He spoke quietly, but the students knew when to listen, and quickly became quiet.
Probably a month ago Bartholomew would've screeched as soon as he got out of bed, but Harry liked to think they had bonded. Perhaps mostly through copious amounts of treats, but it was bonding nonetheless.
It was the last day of lessons before winter holidays, and Draco was certain he was going to murder Harry somehow before the end of the day.
"Is that so. So why have you two cooked up this elaborate scheme, then?"
"Alright! We're going to talk about some seasonally appropriate stuff today!"
"Ha ha," Harry deadpanned. "Did you want to go here, then? I figured you were probably lurking outside with purpose."
"HARRY!" Several loud voices greeted him, and suddenly he was hugging Bill and Fleur’s children, who had jumped on him, and then George and Percy.
"I do, but I really want to see you bottom for the first time. Sounds hot. The kind of hot that should be illegal."
"Ah yes, but why would I do that when I could come bother you and disrupt your lesson?" Draco responded in hushed tones, smiling wryly.
"Thanks Gin."
on the subject. Once he had amassed about twelve, he hauled them back to his table.
"I guess I knew, but I never really though about...your come is coming back out and it feels weird."
Sometimes when Harry looked at him like that, all soft and loving, it took him a bit to remember how to remind himself that it wasn't real. Sure, Harry was a very loving person, and Draco didn't doubt that he cared for him a lot, but it wasn't that kind of love. They weren't another Ron and Hermione, and they were never going to be. He needed to remember that.
Today had been quite the day for Harry. He hadn't actually had more than a few small bites of his food at the pub, as he'd been rather preoccupied with the conversation, so he thought it best to make a quick dinner and then go to bed. Upon entering the kitchen, he found that all of his dishes were dirty, and he set them to washing themselves whilst he looked in the cupboards. It became rapidly clear that takeaway might be a better option.
Harry made a noncommittal sound, and he felt himself relax as Draco worked on his shoulder.
A few particularly curious Fifth Years, who had been in the interrupted class, left lunch early to investigate the hospital wing in hopes that there may be hints of what Professor Potter had been talking about. As they were climbing the stairs, they heard a soft voice. They quietly continued down the corridor until they saw Draco pacing back and forth in front of the infirmary doors holding— a baby? He was bouncing it gently and cooing to it.
, darling."
"Oh you're
"Actually, yeah, you're pretty spot-on, but that doesn't mean I'm not a good teacher. I started teaching Defence back in Fifth Year. I taught about twenty people how to do a corporeal patronus! Besides, students like me — I'm nice."
George laughed.
"Excuse me? Harry Potter?" Harry inwardly rolled his eyes. He knew that tone. It was someone who wanted a signature or a photograph or maybe just to squeal over how amazing he was. He turned with a fake smile.
They attracted quite a few stares, because of who they were, and
"As I’m sure you all know, Ron, Hermione, and I have been best friends since we were eleven." That got a few titters — he doubted the whole of Britain didn’t know about the ‘three inseparable war heroes’, as the Prophet had put it after the war. “Because of that, I’ve had the wonderful opportunity to see for myself how true the phrase ‘better together’ can be.” He turned to Ron and Hermione. “The two of you have been hopelessly in love since at
"Yeah, yeah, sure."
that fact, before Draco was kissing him.
Draco was glad they had come over. He quite liked the Weasleys, as it turned out, and Ginny was perfectly nice to him. Ron and Hermione were also surprisingly easy for him to get along with, and Draco found himself wishing, once again, that things might have gone a little differently whilst they were in school so they might have become friends.
The bird gave him a rather hard disapproving look and hopped around to face away. It pushed off from the window sill, pooped, and then flew off at top speed.
Which, speaking of: great

to speak at Draco and Narcissa's trials. Harry wasn't about to let excessive punishments go to the undeserving in the fearful aftermath of the war. Merlin, there were plenty of deserving, guilty scum to be punished without Draco and Narcissa being lumped in with them.
Half of him feared his loss of his temper would be blown out of proportion and taken as a sign that he was mentally unwell or some other nonsense, but he had merely said, 'Yeah, sure, whatever', and decided to let the chips fall where they may.
"Aww, I was so right. Harry, I don't know why you keep saying these things aren't good. They're your emotions and they're important, okay? You keep saying all the symptoms, but you're refusing to say what they mean. You need to stop lying to yourself, and I

flutter over his throat, betraying his anxiety.
to show my face— Oh for
Harry felt himself flush a little at the look in his eyes. "Well you're one to talk. You never wear robes anymore, nevermind getting dressed up."
However, when the new school year started, and neither Harry nor Draco had shown up to any mealtimes (save the welcome feast) for the entire first week back, the students really started to ask questions.
"What if they don't like the food? They already kind of hate me. Should I have made a second option? I mean it's aubergine parmigiana, that's fairly inoffensive, right?"
"Fine. Good. Great."
. Half the time most of them hated me for losing so many house points or because they thought I was the heir of Slytherin or because they thought I was lying about Voldemort being back, or, or
"Yeah, but you and the weasel are weird."
I testified in his trial on his behalf — that's all anyone needs to know."
"Oh, sorry! Didn't mean to...I was just wondering where you went," she said, blushing.
"And so it will help you to go into this anyway...how?" Harry asked. The more Draco described the function, the more it sounded like being thrown into a pit of viper masquerading as smiling aristocrats.
"Thank you for the dramatics, Mr. Morrison. You may go back to your table now. I'm sure the professors would like to eat." Minerva McGonagall stated wryly from the staff table.
"I do what I can," Harry shrugged.
"Does it work like a broom?" Ron set it down and held his hand over it. "Up." The carpet didn't move.
Harry smiled widely.
— it’s not like I’m, I dunno,
Well, whatever. Then they'd been friends for awhile. Harry didn't really see their point.
The boy who had held the trunk spoke.
Harry just shrugged, and glanced warily at Bartholemew's open cage hanging in the window, where he sat preening himself. "Where's your parchment?"
That was how Draco ended up standing in front of an unfamiliar house, too nervous to knock.
By the time the meal had finished, Harry was beyond full. He didn't think he'd eaten that much in years; and perhaps he shouldn't have, as he now felt slightly sick. He saw many students leaving and heard cries of, "Gryffindor First Years! Follow me!" "Hufflepuffs! This way!" and so on, so he assumed it would be safe for him to escape. He edged around the hall, trying to avoid contact with as many students as possible. Eventually, he escaped its confines, and made his way to his quarters, immediately collapsing on his bed and falling asleep once he arrived.
Arthur gave them each a wide smile and a firm handshake, wishing them well.
"We need to get going now," Harry said gently.
-out me though, and we still need lunch, so..."
"Sorry I'm late! Happy Christmas everybody!" Ginny burst in the front door with several bags, which she immediately dropped on the floor — likely to deal with later — and headed straight to the kitchen.
"I love you."
At the end of the lesson, one of the students hesitantly tried to approach him, only to discover that he'd actually fallen asleep at some point.
"Are you sure this is a good idea? We can say I got sick, or I got called into work, or—"
"You'd be surprised."
"What?"

"Pfft. O.W.L.s, they'll show that you can do a test — won't show if you can keep up in a shop, though." She continued to eye him for a moment. "Let's see you do a couple of things. Maybe if you don't ruin my ingredients, I'll think about hiring you," she finally said and waved him toward the back room.
excited to be back?" Ron finally asked, nudging Harry gently with his shoulder.
He realised he must have dozed off when he awoke to gentle fingers carding through his hair.
