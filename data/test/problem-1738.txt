“There’s something else, I wanted to… give you,” Harry said, turning more red.
“Yep,” Draco responded.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was the same thing Pansy had asked: “
While Potter hadn’t been looking, Draco had snatched Snape’s book from its spot laying on the table, and held it tightly in his hand. Since it was about the size of his palm, the book was easy to conceal, plus, Potter was luckily too caught up in his spell casting, so stealing the book right from under Potter’s nose had been easy.
you had some evil intention, Draco. I know you better than you know yourself.” Theo was walking closer to him, but Draco stood his ground, bringing his wand up higher. “I don’t know exactly what you were aiming at, especially with bringing Potter along for the ride, but let me tell you something--”
“Someone! Anyone! Hello, I’m stuck in here!” Draco yelled.
“To switch the Mark’s leader to myself,” Drys cut in, “I needed your blood and I needed the blood of Avery snr. Now, you all obey me. You do whatever I tell you to do, and if I die, you all die too.”
Eventually, he spoke. “I'm a murderer too, you know.” His tone wasn’t angry, accusing, pitying, or anything in between. Just a sort of sad, reminiscing one.
“Why hello everyone!” Came a voice from the door. Everyone shifted around in their seats to look at Elizabeth, who was their group therapist. She was tall and slim, and very pretty. “I trust everyone had a good week?” Several students nodded their heads, Draco did not.
Harry pushed open the door to the Garden of Mystics, and they walked in side by side.
Draco put his head in his hands. “Ugh.”
Go figures.
“You two seem pretty close nowadays,” Kaspian observed.
He tried to reassure himself with those kinds of thoughts, along with staring at a spot on his sheets, which helped with trying to focus his mind, and soon he had stopped panicking and started to relax.
Finally, after about five minutes, Harry called out for Draco, and he hopped off the sink, hastily opening the door to see what Harry had been up to.
was a weird thought. Potter and himself working
“You can tell me,” Harry said sincerely, patiently.
In reality, no matter what you thought was right, if it led to the death of people, it was always wrong. Somehow, the world worked that way, and it took Draco way too long to see it.
so many times the past hour, Draco’s ears were starting to hurt by listening to the word on repeat. He hadn’t even made any progress either, so Draco’s head was throbbing for nothing.
After a while, he thought he heard a noise, but his brain blocked it out, and he focused on the task at hand.
Draco could deny it, truthfully. They weren’t able to get the spell to break the ward to work, and some evil wizard offered Draco a horrible deal. Instead all he said was: “Sure, Harry.”
Draco was glad he got the bed closest to the window, though he supposed it wasn’t exactly a window and more of just glass. He loved to look out of it, and into the depths of the lake. It was very calming, looking at the different creatures that swam by, it cleared his head.
“That’s fine with me,” she responded warmly.
Draco really did wonder how Potter had done so well during Sixth Year.
“Draco!” Squealed an annoying female voice. “I’ve been looking for you everywhere!”
He had to blink away the rain hitting his face, but on top of that, he had to blink multiple times to really make himself believe he wasn’t trapped in another vision, because standing before him, maybe about half of a kilometer away, was the Hooded Figure.
2) Himself.
him, like he was a ghost, and the man stood in front of the door, telling the woman in the quietest voice imaginable to go hide and to find their son; Alec.
On the other hand, Theo could be poisoned from the Restorative Potion; his breaths ceasing to exist. He would be blamed for Theo’s murder, and would be sent to Azkaban for the rest of his life. He wasn’t positive if even Harry’s pleas for Draco’s release would be accepted this time round’. The only bright side to that outcome was Theo dying, but at lengthy costs. Though, he wasn’t sure he could live with himself any longer with blood on his hands, even if it was Theo’s blood.
“I just mean, you never talk. You never interact with other people, besides Parkinson. You haven’t given the chance to show literally anyone you’ve changed.”
Harry frowned. “Why do you say that?”
Harry gave a sarcastic sigh. “Yeah, whatever.”
“You can’t say I’m wrong, though,” Draco said. He’d earned a lot more courage as their conversation progressed.
He brushed a finger across Harry’s face. “I could just say it over and over and over again. Thank you for everything, Harry.”
Kaspian was giggling profusely with the girl next to him.
As if remembering some piece of vital information, Harry gave a little gasp, his eyes widening as he stared at Draco. “You do realize you survived the killing curse, right?”
, that Draco was brought back to reality, scowling at the owl for making such a loud noise. He was sure he could hear Harry’s footsteps, and quickly took the letter from the owl, the owl flying off in the direction of the Owlery.
They started making their way back to the path that led from Hogsmeade to Hogwarts, walking right next to each other. There was still a good amount of space between them however. Potter made sure he wasn’t walking that fast, matching Draco’s slow speed. It started to snow more heavily, and both boys pulled their coats tighter around them.
“You said he’s Muggle-born, right?”
Draco kept running.
“What?”
“Well, then, why don’t we?”
“May I?” Harry was indicating his forearm, and more than half of Draco was screaming
Draco’s head fell backward onto the pillow. He would have to talk to
In the past however long they’d been leaning against each other, they both had gone back and forth sharing memories from their childhood. Draco had been surprised to learn about the abuse Harry had gone through as a child, and mentally scolded himself, as he’d made Harry’s life even more miserable at Hogwarts; Harry’s only escape from the Dursleys.
Draco looked down at his feet. “So, that's all I know about the Dark Mark, I swear. If you-”
Sometime deep into the night, Draco was curled up next to Harry, all the lights extinguished and their clothes discarded save for their underwear. He pressed his nose to Harry’s cheek and continuously kissed him there, just because he could. Harry’s arm was protectively around him, tracing designs on the bare skin.
Draco stayed in the bathroom a tiny bit longer to get ready for bed, and once he was finally done, he realized he was nervous to face Harry, if he wasn’t asleep yet.
“Yeah, I like that idea a lot,” Draco said.
“You see, Potter. We just watched a rock evaporate before our eyes when it crossed the ward. I don’t think an owl could break past it.”
“Draco?”
He felt a warm hand wrap around his left wrist, and before he could comprehend what was going on, he heard Harry’s voice, soft and comforting. “Don’t do that, you’ll hurt yourself.” And then Harry was pulling Draco’s fingers away from further injuring himself or upsetting the Mark.
“That’s not the main reason I don’t want to go. You know what I did to Rosmerta. I can’t show my face in her pub. I just can’t. Plus, you know everyone would not enjoy my presence there, so really, why did you ask me?”
He and Harry hadn’t actually
, above all others, was Alec Kaspian.
He was glad to hear that Harry had stuck up for him, but was also mad at him for getting himself into so much trouble that he wasn’t even able to visit Draco anymore. The git.
He felt the bed dip even more next to him, and turned his head to see that Harry was lying on his back, too. He was looking at the ceiling, almost as if it were the starry night sky.
Of course, there was the small problem of distributing the potion out to everyone in the school, along with the small problem of how exactly they were supposed to distribute it; they weren’t sure if it was done by a certain spell, or if they had to walk around to every single person in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, opening people’s mouths and forcing the liquid down their throats.
cold-hearted. I’m sure he wasn’t always like that, but when Olive died during the war… everything changed.”
“Of course I’m here, Mum,” Draco responded, hearing the sadness in his own voice.
Drys sneered. “I don’t trust him enough to not make a mess out of everything. I had one chance to get this done, and if he wasn’t able to become close to Potter, I would have failed. I was not planning on failing.”
“Malfoy?”
His stomach sank and his heart raced. He was most certainly not alone, and the other presence was definitely not Harry Potter, unless he suddenly became a Slytherin in the time they had been separated, and Harry somehow got dressed in a Slytherin uniform.
"The adventure of life is to learn. The purpose of life is to grow. The nature of life is to change." -William A. Ward
Harry traced Draco’s scar that cut across his face with his fingers, lips, and tongue, and Draco eventually had enough teasing and forcefully brought Harry’s lips back to meet his own.
Olive was in my House, Ravenclaw, and she found out what I’d been doing, and instead of telling the professors about what I was up to, she helped me.
“Shall we go in?” Harry asked, excited.
At the end of class, as Draco stayed behind with Blaise, to wait for everyone to leave the room, Harry approached them, and that time they couldn’t get out fast enough, due to idiotic people taking their sweet old time.
“You’re the best part of me,” Draco muttered into Harry’s neck.
Harry stepped right in front of Draco. There was barely any space between them now, and Draco held his breath.
“I can’t believe you waited until the last minute to complete that,” Harry said in disbelief. “You usually finish homework days before it’s due.”
“Yes, Pansy?” he said without trying to keep out the irritation in his voice.
The man and woman ran
Draco looked at Harry, astonished beyond words. He didn’t know what else to do except kiss him; to kiss him, hold him tight, and never let him go.
Draco was basically making the Bloodroot Potion all by himself, while Potter just passed him the ingredients. He only spoke when he asked Potter to hand him something.
“You too.”
He’d known throughout the past couple years, that he was going to die a tragic death, because that was what accompanied someone who’d done countless unspeakable crimes. But facing death, for real, and knowing others would die because of him, was petrifying.
“Here we go,” Potter said as they approached the sparkly ward. He opened the book to the bookmarked page which explained how to cast the counter-charm.
Blaise and Davis ignored him most of the time, while Theo and Robins were always taunting him and calling him names, always trying to get under his skin.
” So Draco did, against his better judgement. Harry went on now that their eyes were locked. “I care about you. So, so much. Which is a sentence I never thought would come out of my mouth, but it’s true.”
something. The Purebloods were always seen as the mighty and powerful ones, while the Muggle-borns were viewed as weak and soft. I wanted to prove them all wrong. So that’s what I set out to do.”
Trying his best to straighten his posture, Draco said, “Look, Headmistress. I’m really fine. Sure, a little shaken up. But fine.” Draco didn’t want to lie to her. But, the alternative of actually relaying his feelings to one of the most respected and powerful witches, who fought on the side of the Order, was petrifying.
to talk to him again. Draco should’ve ignored Potter, but once again the overwhelming urge to instantly snap back at Potter overtook him.
to see if Theo had moved, the whole thing had seemed pointless and he and Harry had lost all hope of the potion actually working.
“How was I supposed to know you were going to show up? You sometimes decide to come to class, and sometimes don’t. I can’t keep up with you anymore.”
Narcissa Malfoy walked up to where Draco was perched on a seat inside some boutique. She bought a flowery dress that looked incredibly expensive, not that money was a problem, and seemed ready to head back home, from the weariness of her stance.
Harry had been right, it had taken him approximately one minute to run to the potions room and back. He was slightly out of breath when he finally reached Draco, holding out the vial that was definitely the correct potion, the liquid inside a lighter shade of green.
“Hey,” Draco croaked out. Harry didn’t turn to face him. “Hey, Harry,” he tried again.
“Are you
and talking ever so loudly in the classroom. Harry’s new found annoyingness could have been a result of Draco’s revelation, but he tried not to ponder it.
Everything and everyone else was later, and Harry was his now and forever.
“Draco, dear,” Draco quickly pulled his blankets over his arm as Madame Pomfrey walked over to his bed, “Before you sleep, I have to change the bandage on your arm.”
Harry’s eyes were blown from shock at the disruption. He was sitting back in his chair that had just threatened to tip over. Draco suppressed a laugh.
As they made their way through the empty halls of Hogwarts, Draco realized his chest felt immensely better. He hadn’t done too much walking ever since his and Potter’s fateful night in Hogsmeade, and he had been eating and sleeping pretty decently the past couple days, so he guessed it made sense that his injuries healed on their own and didn’t need any extra care from Madame Pomfrey. Well, he didn’t know for sure if starting to actually take care of himself helped him heal, but he liked to think it had.
bite his tongue this time.
Draco shook his head. “What- WHAT is going on?”
“You know, Harry, I honestly believe that sounds right up your alley,” Draco confessed.
Draco made a quick glance at Pansy and his mum, and saw that they were already leaving the room. His mum’s personal Auror following right behind. It was something he had asked them to do the first time he had been awake to witness the healing of his Mark that occurred every day before dinner.
It had obviously been lightning, he told himself. And he would have believed it had the sound not started again. The noise was almost like someone dropping a vase and breaking it, pieces shattering, except on a larger scale. Then there was a huge
Without turning to face Alec, Draco stated, “you couldn't have been awake this whole time, Kaspian. I know you know about Harry’s map, and when we looked at that thing, you were always in bed. Plus, I found a Slytherin tie in the dungeon corridors, what the fuck was that for? You aren’t going to tell me that Theodore Nott is in on all of this too, huh?”
Harry nodded his head. He was also looking intently at Draco, and had long since dropped his food back on his plate.
Draco cleared his throat. “Right. Thanks.” He snuck a short glance towards Harry, whose cheeks were aflame. “How’d you know to come down here?”
“Aren’t you mad at me, though?”
can go read somewhere else,” Harry suggested.
Harry. Merlin’s sake.
Draco took a quick glance at Alec, who was furious but also slightly embarrassed. "But-"
He considered falling asleep outside when he heard the door to the balcony open. He expected it to be Pansy, coming to berate him with questions regarding why he wasn’t inside chatting with people. But as he looked up to see who it was, he saw it was Harry.
“Wait, so you’ve met his parents, right?” Harry was silent. “Harry?”
It was now Potter’s turn to huff in annoyance. “Merlin, just let me finish my sentence!” Potter looked like he was waiting for Draco to interrupt again, but Draco was actually curious as to what Potter had to say. He continued on, “Okay, well I tried waking them up, but no one moved. Like I shook them each numerous times, and everyone just continued sleeping. I tried waking them up with a couple jinxes, but they still didn’t bloody move!” Potter was pacing frantically now, and Draco could honestly relate to Potter’s hysteria.
In all honesty, he didn’t want to die. He was terribly afraid of facing death in either one of the ‘
“I can’t believe he actually showed up!” More laughter.
Draco finally found the courage to turn his head to look at Harry. Harry was already looking at him with a smile.
“So, you really thought I was dead?”
Now, looking at Harry, who was miraculously sitting across the table from him and acting like it was no big deal, was simply stunning to him. What was more stunning, was that Harry looked content, and not lost; not like he was in his own little world while blocking out the real one. Draco was shocked to admit to himself that he was doing the same thing.
Then there was Harry. And oh Salazar did he not want to think of Harry through it all. He knew that sometime soon, he needed to talk to him, though. It was the right thing to do, and it was something he needed to do to put his mind and body at peace for good.
Potter’s mouth fell open slightly, and he looked sort of mortified. Maybe he was biphobic. But that wasn’t right, it had sounded like Potter had had no clue what being bisexual even meant.
That was until their lips touched, no space between them.
Draco didn’t really need as much of a ‘reward’ as Harry did, considering how every time Harry practiced, he sat on his arse reading books. But, he did like the idea of spending every night before he had to brew the potion, in the Garden of Mystics, alone with only Harry’s company.
He’d wanted to be a hero so badly, and only yesterday, he would have given everything to do
“I’m trying to tell you this in the least stalker-ish way I can; I watched you these past weeks, while I kept my distance, and I could see you were miserable. Am I wrong to note that I caused that?” Harry said nothing, but he did shift a little in his spot. Draco knew he was being a little more than courageous with what he was saying, but it had to be said. He just hoped it wouldn’t make Harry uncomfortable.
“If you would have taken me up on my offer, I would have let you rule beside me. You would have not had a care in the world about what was going on, and it would be a relief for you to not have to worry about anything ever again.
“During my days at Hogwarts,” Drys said, “I always knew I had a special talent for creating spells, and building off existing ones, making them extremely powerful. I experimented a lot, and would stay up all night just to
Pushing his wand into his robe, Draco reached for the next object; the photograph he had kept with him from the night of their first, and only, kiss. The Muggle photograph of the two of them in the snow, a candid moment forever frozen in time.
Well fuck. Of course, it was the classic conundrum. Draco now felt obligated
“Mad at you? Of course.” Draco gave a small smile. “You disfigured my face. But, what’s done is done, and Merlin knows I deserved it. You should see my chest if you think my cheek is bad.” Harry gasped, eyes moving to Draco’s chest. Draco laughed. “If you think I’m going to show you those scars, you’re wrong. It’s freezing out here.”
was the savior of the Wizarding World. It was laughable. A Death Eater with a schoolboy crush on the Savior. Luckily for Draco, he could compartmentalize and hide his emotions extremely well.
Draco shook his head slightly, clearing away the shock, and stuffed his wand back into his robes. He knew he should have probably done something to help Theo, but he didn’t seem to be near the brink of death, or even have a concussion. Plus, the twat fucking deserved it.
Draco could sort of relate to what Potter had said. Definitely not on the same level as him, but in the same general area.
Draco wanted to know more. He wanted to know how Harry had met Alec, and if Alec’s dad was coming back to England, and how Olive had died during the war. Maybe Draco’s family had imprisoned her. Instead he nodded his head, and returned his attention back to the door.
“I had Pureblood neighbors, you see,” Drys said, snapping Draco out of the past. “Two households who lived in close proximity to my family. It would have been so easy to notice what had been going on, and so easy for them to call for help. But you know what they did? They just sat there and watched. They did nothing. Absolutely nothing. I reckon they might have even found the whole thing funny.”
Out of all spells, he wasn’t positive why he’d pick that specific one. There were much more ‘fun’ and exciting spells encased in the book, and yet he chose a spell that he wasn’t sure would work. You had to cast the spell directly at a place where there was a hidden passageway, it couldn’t locate one for you, you just had to know the location of one and it revealed it for you.
“Why does everyone keep saying that?”
“Malfoy! Oh my God! Oh my
There was a green and black tie with the snake emblem attached, lying near the stone wall. He wouldn’t have been able to see it was not for the light coming out of his wand.
Draco thought impressively.
“Yeah well it’s not always something you can tell by just looking at someone, you know.” Draco rolled his eyes again. “And Theo isn’t gay. He’s bisexual.”
He was hugging his mother, and father, and Pansy. He told them that he loved them. He was happy.
“Hmm. Interesting.”
but he was weak. His anxiety about every last detail of his life clouded his mind, and his breathing came up short. He could tell that Harry was even more concerned for him than before.
Elizabeth pondered his words. “Have you talked to Harry Potter about this? He’s been struck by the Killing Curse and survived. He could possibly have some insight for you.”
The Death Eater let out a humorless laugh. “Search the house and surrounding area. Bring me their wands.”
Pansy knew how to plan a party.
been an interesting one. The title read:
Potter had stopped just up ahead of Draco, at the very edge of Hogsmeade, his wand still casting a light all around him. Draco eventually caught up to him, and was extremely out of breath, though he tried not to show it as he neared Potter, who was very much not out of breath. The prat. Potter
Harry was still leaning against Draco, and had stopped coughing for the moment. He looked like he was exhausted, and wanted to fall asleep terribly bad, but the idea of losing consciousness while in the presence of a dark wizard was not something Harry intended to do. Even at his lowest, Harry still set the bar high.
“Yep.”
He shook his head, and almost laughed at Harry’s words. “That’s just it. It’s not perfect. Not even close.” Draco couldn’t stop himself from running a hand over Harry’s chest, entranced at how different Harry’s body was from his; there were multiple scars, but none that ran the length of his upper body like his own, crisscrossing and marring skin. No tattoo on his forearm that was the embodiment of pure evil.
motivation, I realized. And like I said, the death of the Purebloods currently in Hogwarts will be much easier with them asleep.
“Potter, has- has your scar hurt lately?” Draco asked in the most casual tone he could muster. He knew that Potter’s scar was in some way connected to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord himself had talked briefly of their connection during meetings, and though he never revealed much about the strange connection, Draco did know that Potter’s scar was very important.
“I told Alec to replace it with a book that was an exact replica of the first, just in case someone who knew of Snape’s book found it and realized it had been replaced. I taught him the spells that would make it seem like it was the real deal, but the spells or potions held inside wouldn’t actually work.” Drys turned his head slightly to scowl at Alec. “Well, he partially listened to me, because like you said, Draco, the spell you used to break the barrier that I put up worked. But, ultimately, I had nothing to worry about, because you only sent a letter to your dear father.”
In therapy with Elizabeth he brought these thoughts up, and she did help, truly, but there were some things even she couldn’t work out completely.
“Yeah, this. This moment. The beautiful night sky, the chilly air, and-”
“Stop that. Don’t cry. It’s only
“What happened anyway? What happened that made you end up in the Hospital Wing?”
The whole sleeping curse had made Draco realize he was in love. He didn’t know how or when he had fallen in love with the Savior, but it had obviously been there for a ridiculously long time, and the sleeping curse had allowed Draco to discover that part of him. He’d been begging for Harry’s attention since he was eleven, and now, looking back on all his attention seeking, it seemed quite obvious he’d always had a thing for Harry.
He was just ultimately hoping that they would see he didn’t intentionally plan to kill someone, and un-arrest him.
Madame Pomfrey had to be around somewhere, Draco knew. Maybe she would explain-
I still have the other part of the Wizarding World to guide. Sure, of course I’d rather have all of the Wizarding World, but waking everyone up from the curse isn’t a huge problem of mine.”
Draco tried his hardest not to look at Harry after their time spent in the kitchen, so that was the first time he’d truly seen him. Draco’s breath caught in his throat and his whole body stilled.
That was when Draco took a brief look at Harry’s lips. They were right above Draco’s, and he wished he knew how soft they were. He thought he saw Harry glance at Draco’s lips, but he was still slightly delusional and the world was still foggy, he knew he had made it up.
He had absolutely no clue what to do. He should tell someone. This had to mean the Dark Lord was back. But that was ridiculous, Draco had seen him die, like a mortal man. He could never, ever return.
“But we should still keep looking. There might be someone in trouble or something.”
Wynn then seemed to notice Draco, and his smile fell. He was one of the professors that utterly hated Draco’s guts. His other professors were scared of him and tried to avoid him as much as possible, while Wynn seemed to go the extra mile to make Draco’s life miserable. Apparently his wife had died at the hands of a Death Eater during the Battle of Hogwarts, so naturally he had to take his grief out on Draco.
“I ended up there because Alec and his gang had hurt me pretty badly; they threw jinxes and shit at me. After the group of them left, though, Alec… he, um, slashed my left forearm. I now know it was because he needed my own blood to control all the Death Eaters. It also allowed Drys to check in on us through my eyes...”
“It's okay. Really, I-”
“Truce.” Draco shook Potter’s outstretched hand.
A weird word, most definitely, but an interesting one nonetheless. Even though he really couldn’t recall any details from the session, he remembered that one word, and its meaning.
weird names, even weird for Wizards.”
He hit the floor with a loud
“Makes sense.” Is all Potter had to say.
“We should really get back to Hogwarts then. Can you walk?” Potter shifted uncomfortably on his feet.
“I wish I could save this forever,” Draco said, his eyes mapping out the stars.
“But-”
“Right. Sure.”
He was grasping at nothing now, holding on to strands of hope that just weren’t there and were never coming. His mind told him to just give up, but his heart told him to keep trying.
benefited from Draco’s company.
. No one had really ever held that power. Though, maybe Harry had always been good at reading Draco.
after they’d arrested Draco, since they didn’t even know the full story (Harry didn’t know the full story either, but as Pansy had said, Harry was insistent that Draco hadn’t killed anyone on purpose and was only protecting Harry) and in the end, Harry had punched one of the Aurors in the face.
His attempt, however, was futile, for Harry started to stretch and yawn, and then twisted over to look at Draco.
“Yeah. Yeah that’s a good guess. I think we should assume the worst. Because if we don’t and we don’t save everyone in time and something happens-” Potter took a deep breath- ”I couldn’t live with myself.”
Potter had groaned and obviously hadn’t wanted to comply, but he eventually did.
to move a target away,
“You have ruined my life,” Harry gave Draco a meaningful look. “You’ve ruined my life in the best possible way.” He took Draco’s hand once again. “When I’m back to my
Harry met him at the entrance to Slughorn’s room, taking his wand from Draco’s hand, his fingers lingering a little longer than normal, not that Draco was complaining.
“Alright, young man. Last time,” Pomfrey said to Draco.
“I-- I didn’t want to die,” Draco admitted. “I was so scared. Scared for my own life, scared for your life, scared for everyone else's…”
He had heard muffled noises coming from outside the door, filled with lots of laughter and taunts. Such as:
Draco let out a breath he hadn’t known he’d been holding. He looked over at Potter, who had stumbled over to where Weasley, Granger, Longbottom, Thomas, and Finnigan were sitting in the middle of the room. Everyone else in the room was finally quieting down from their fit of laughter.
Draco was filled with relief at the sight of him. He never wanted to feel that worried again, even if it was for about two minutes.
“And how has your second week of classes been going?”
Harry didn’t have his map. Draco did.
and the two of them lapsed into a newly found comfortable silence while they finished eating their dinner.
Granger tugged on Weasley’s arm, and led him out of the room, without a glance back at Draco. Potter followed right behind them, and he did glance back, however briefly. Then, just like that, the trio was gone.
“I wish you hadn’t,” Draco mumbled very quietly under his breath.
He was utterly bored out of his mind watching Potter cast the same spell over and over again, so to occupy himself, he found a children's book on dragons and started looking through it. Potter did not approve of his book, yelling at Draco to help him learn the
Slughorn’s face lit up at the sight of him.
“But you saved me,” Harry stated loud and clear. “You fucking jumped in front of the fucking Killing Curse, and risked your own life for
“Night, Pans.”
Automatically Draco’s thoughts went to his dream, how he thought it might have been a call for help. Could it have something to do with why everyone was asleep?
Harry’s fingers touched his chin, grabbing softly and motioning for Draco’s head to look down.
I'm sorry if this chapter was boring, but I felt the need to develop Draco's relationships and back story and stuff. More drarry will happen in the next chapter and all the chapters after that! I also wanted to show how normal Hogwarts life was for Draco, compared to how it's going to be in the next couple of days when the plot thickens. I promise it will get more interesting very soon!
6) His professors.
Potions & Therapy Sessions.
“Yes. After everything that had happened with you and Mr. Potter, the Ministry and I have discussed some terms of your probation that need to be readjusted.”
Even with Harry’s imperfections, he was still perfect. Draco didn’t know how that was possible, but Harry made it possible.
He finally decided what he would do, and hoped beyond hope that it truly wouldn’t lead to worse consequences.
“Of course.”
He then wondered why exactly he was here in the first place, but remembered Drys had cast some spell over him, probably taking him to this room for some reason.
Of course, he would prefer dating him, but they hadn’t crossed that line from friendship to partners yet. He didn’t think they ever would, but he was fine with that. He would rather have Harry as a friend, than have him as
Draco was taken aback. Apparently she knew more about himself than he did. “What do you mean?”
“Yes, Professor,” Draco said shakily. He turned on his feet, and hurriedly stalked out of the office, shutting the door and willing himself not to break down.
He wondered how he had transported there, and how that was even possible since you couldn’t Apparate on school grounds, when he saw that the edges of his vision were blurred, and the Figure with the hooded cloak was standing before him. It was another vision, except this time, it felt more real than it ever had before.
They both looked up, startled, as it started to lightly snow.
Draco’s hands clenched into a fist. He did
He finally lifted his eyes, ever so slightly, and instantly saw all the stares. He dropped his gaze again. He only occasionally looked at Pansy while she chatted away about the sleeping curse and how he was a “hero.”
He whispered into Harry’s ear; “Does that mean, the man is…”
“How does that have anything to do with the sleeping curse?”
exactly he now felt like he didn’t want to talk, when all he wanted for the past week in the Hospital Wing was to finally see and talk to Harry.
“Try again. Maybe you didn’t do the right wand movement,” Draco added, hoping to bring back some of the optimism he had earlier.
Harry, Harry, Harry,
He didn’t know how to word that empty void inside of him before, and he noticed Harry had perfectly described what Draco had been feeling all his life that night in the Garden. “I went to Hogwarts looking for something. Anything. Anything that would fill the emptiness inside of me and all around me,” Harry had said.
“Oh! Right. It’s a Muggle radio. Different than a Wireless used by Wizards. I’ll show you how it works when we get to the Garden.” Harry grabbed the basket using his free hand, and Draco grabbed the blanket.
“Okay I guess it’s my turn. Let’s see here.” Draco contemplated what he wanted to say in Potter’s presence. They had both agreed that the whole ‘deepest, darkest secret’ thing was all a ruse. A book could not possibly dictate between what was a little white lie, and what was a monumental, Earth-shattering secret. Especially a book made by a teenager. “Alright I have one. This year, probably in October, I was in the library finishing up a paper for Arithmancy, and this group of Sixth Years came out of nowhere, obliterating my paper to nothingness.
“Theo? Theo are you in here?” Draco said, walking deeper into the room. It was certainly empty.
Instead, they continued to walk in silence, not touching in the slightest. Out of the corner of Draco’s eye, he could tell Harry repeatedly kept looking at him.
He was probably going to get more Aurors, now that Draco was obviously awake. The world was still a bit fuzzy, and it was hard to concentrate on all that had happened, but he did remember the edge of the Forbidden Forest, and the small battle that had ensued there.
She pursed her lips and looked down at Draco like she knew something he didn’t.
“I think I know a place we can go.”
Pansy shared her answer with about as much enthusiasm as a rock, and then soon enough it was Potter’s turn.
And that was that.
He would bet his life on the fact that the Slytherin tie had not been there when he walked through the corridors Saturday.
That caught Draco’s attention. “Alright, go on.”
“Draco. If you think you did something wrong-- whatever that something is-- you’re just filling yourself with unnecessary guilt.” Harry took a deep breath. “You were so… happy. Outside the Great Hall. What changed from then to now?”
Potter smiled at him. “If I find out something new, I’ll make sure to tell you too.”
realize that is the whole point of this.”
Her attention focused on him as he took his spot next to her.
“I’ve made a new friend, haven’t I?” Harry answered, quite genuinely. His eyes sparkling and a small smile forming.
Harry stirred slightly. His head twitched in Draco’s lap, and Draco immediately placed all of his attention back on Harry, smoothing down his hair, and keeping him warm.
Harry blushed. “That’s not what I was going to ask.” He moved his attention away from Draco’s chest, and briefly glanced at Draco’s left arm, making him feel hot even in the freezing air.
His roommates would probably yell at him for hogging the bathroom, but he honestly didn’t care at the moment. He
Harry laid down next to him. Draco was glad he had company while he was freezing his bollocks off. He hadn’t felt like replying to Harry, and he wanted to feel numb, so he felt the best option was to lie down in the snow.
No regrets.
and his words were so soothing. He always said exactly what Draco needed to hear, whether he liked it or not. Forgiving himself first was obviously easier said than done, and he knew Harry knew that, but the advice was still lovely to hear.
Draco was still full of misery, still thinking about everything he had done wrong in the past two weeks, the past two years, and basically every year of his life. He wanted to give the illusion to Harry that he was alright, though, at least for the moment. He wanted Harry to think he’d solved all of Draco’s problems. He wanted Harry to be happy, which was more important than his own happiness.
To Harry’s knowledge, Alec was currently in a holding cell in Azkaban, awaiting trial. He hadn’t allowed anyone to use Veritaserum or a Pensieve on him, and without consent, they would never be able to. The Aurors were purely trusting Draco’s memories to provide them with information on the showdown with Drys, and to what Harry had told him, Draco’s memories were holding a pretty good case against Alec.
He wrote down the basics of what he would say to them. He wasn’t ready to actually speak to them face to face yet, but just writing down his thoughts on parchment took a weight off his shoulders. Eventually, he planned to apologize to as many people as he could. It would be impossible to apologize to everyone, so he told himself he’d do his best.
Pomfrey didn’t have a clue as to why the Mark was acting up, but Draco had a thought. It had been under immense pressure from Drys toying with dark magic he didn’t understand. The Mark being awakened again by any other person other than the Dark Lord must have irritated it, and then, what had made it worse, was when the Mark had tried to pull Draco in to joining Drys’ side, but Draco had refused somehow.
“Draco, Draco I’m right here. I got you,” said someone. That someone sounded pretty upset, like they were choking on tears.
He wasn’t sure what to expect from today, but he would most certainly be prepared. He looked at himself in the mirror, his blond hair almost glowing, noticeably standing out against his mostly dark outfit. He pictured Harry standing by his side. A little bit shorter than Draco, much more muscular, and incredibly handsome. Oh how he missed the git.
Harry perked up. “That’s the spirit!” Draco scowled at him. “Well, someone’s tired. I think it’s time to head back to the Room of Requirement.”
“Harry! Glad you could make it! Come on in, grab a seat!”
Draco yawned. “I dunno. Doesn’t matter. I’m not entirely modest. I still think I’m the best looking person at Hogwarts. Although, that is a fact.”
He had his wand in his hand, (even though he could not cast any spells to harm others- thanks to his probation restrictions), but he could cast a shield protection charm around him if he needed to, at the very least.
They’d already discussed that Draco would always be the one to stir the potion, since they were both sure Potter would somehow mess up something as simple as what they had to do every twelve hours; which was literally stirring a potion. But they wanted to be certain the brew would turn out perfect.
He felt the whirring blackness return again, and then he was back at the edge of the forest with Drys looking down at him.
The Figure slowly took off his hood, and Draco looked on intently as the face of the man became more and more visible every second.
He glanced down at the new wrap around his forearm. No blood stain in the outline of the snake and the skull like there had been the previous days, whenever it got close to the time to change the bandage. And, according to Pomfrey, it wouldn’t happen again. It was done bleeding for good.
Also, since he hadn’t had any visions, and he thought he wouldn’t be getting anymore, he thought he wouldn’t have to worry about using Occlumency to keep out intruders. He’d been wrong about that, obviously, and for a split second he thought he’d go back to using Occlumency at night, but he knew he had to let the figure into his head at least one more time, or until he found out what the figure’s offer was.
“This is the fifth floor, east side,” Harry stated. “I’m guessing.”
“Hello.” Draco fucking hated himself. He was brought up on social etiquette and he couldn’t even stutter out anything more than a simple
“So, I’m guessing you didn’t have any luck either,” Draco said.
“Stop talking. No it wasn’t. He deserves it, and you know it, Mandy.”
“Is there a reason why you’re out here?” Harry asked eventually.
“I just never thought I’d
“Thank you,” Draco said finally; sincerely. “Really, thank you, for returning these to me and keeping them safe. And… you know… thanks for saving my life. Out in the forest.”
“Er, okay. Give me a second.”
“I do, too,” Draco said, filling with warmth. “So, you really don’t mind people knowing we’re friends? I mean, my reputation has gotten a lot better since that article came out, but I’m not so sure people will be happy seeing the Chosen One hanging around with the likes of me.”
However, even though he’d made sure not to use Occlumency, he hadn’t had a vision. He was happy he didn’t have to look at the cloaked man again, who only brought horrible fortunes, but was terrified that he wouldn’t get another chance to speak to the man again. Maybe they could strike some other deal, that could possibly result with no one getting hurt or having to suffer. The thought was incredibly unlikely, but Draco did seem to now have a new found optimistic streak inside of him.
“A monster I am.” Draco squeezed his eyes as tight as they’d go.
strong. I’ll just-” Draco got up from his spot, and laid down in the snow, letting the wind brush over him.
Harry didn’t say anything for a minute, and Draco thought he’d fallen asleep. “Yeah,” he whispered eventually.
Draco’s right hand was still held tightly in Harry’s hand, and he had no intention of pulling it free. He used his left hand to prop his head up. “You see, that’s it. I’m trying, all the time, but it’s just too hard. Too hard to keep it all up when deep inside, I really haven’t changed. I’m still the same sucky person who makes the same sucky mistakes.”
Draco snatched the Map, letting it hit the side of his leg as it hung limply in his hand. He moved towards the sound at the back of the library. “Stay here, I’ll go check it out,” Draco announced.
Draco sighed. “I guess we could wait for a couple hours tomorrow and see if anything changes.”
“Well that was unexpected,” Commented Harry, wide-eyed in fear and disbelief. He turned to face Draco, softening into concern. “Are you okay? I swear I didn’t mean for that to happen.”
Once again, his mind wandered to silly questions, like how were the flowers and other types of organisms alive? Sure, the plants had sunlight coming from… who knows where, possibly a spell, but what about the soil and water needed? From what he could tell, the plants were growing out of the cobblestone, and there were no traces of water to be found. The only conclusion he could come up with was that whoever had created the Garden had spelled it, allowing the plants to grow without their usual necessities.
He was, after all, Draco Malfoy.
“Whatever, you prat.”
“I’ve had trouble, over these past few weeks, dealing with everything that happened. My dad, Drys, the Curse in general. I also can’t help but admit I didn’t want you to be friends with a murderer. Someone who made mistake after mistake; who apparently didn’t learn from the war. I talked to Elizabeth, sure, but I should have confided in you, and I realize that now. You know me better than anyone.
as the leader.
Draco debated what he should do. It was noon, and Pomfrey should have been up by now, but was it his job to wake her? Or should he just let her sleep? He knew he would have wanted to be left alone if he was in her position. But a part of him told him he should wake her. His mind was almost
“Well, yeah, but…” he couldn’t think of anything else to say.
Once Draco turned around, he immediately caught Theo’s glaring eye on the opposite side of the room, and froze. Calder Robins was standing beside him, too.
A part of him was desperately hoping to see him, while another was absolutely dreading it.
was the strangest concept to grasp. They had been friends for some time now, Draco knew, likely for about a week or so. But Harry had flat out said that whatever had been cultivating between them for days and days was utterly, simply, friendship.
Before he even had a chance to speak, Drys started talking. “I would later find out that day, that the leader of the group was your father. I would find out days after the first, that you, Severus Snape, and Augustus Rookwood were the ones to burn my home down. You and your lot took everything from me that day.”
“I said ‘
He’d ingrained it in himself that Harry could never want to be with someone like Draco
it had seemed, and he recalled how the freezing snow seeping through Draco’s clothes had been hugely outweighed by Harry’s body heat. He remembered drunkenly giggles and sloppy kisses, Harry’s hands roaming Draco’s body- but not going too far, their tongues exploring each other’s mouths, and the way how Harry’s mouth felt so good on his neck, nipping and sucking and making him disappear into the abyss.
which only made Draco even more angry.
But, Harry wasn’t the one to burst into the Hospital Wing. McGonagall was.
“Draco-”
Then there was Potter.
Because Potter saved everyone. But if that were true, where had Potter been the other times Draco had been attacked? He didn’t save him then, and he wouldn’t save him now. For some reason, that thought stung. The incident where Draco was stuck in a broom closet did not count. He hadn’t been hurt in any way, unless you counted his hurt pride.
Harry went on once Draco kept on hiding his face in his hands. “So, we made it to Hogwarts after a long walk that probably lasted a good couple hours or so, and when I made it to the front entrance, McGonagall and a million students and professors swarmed around us, immediately taking us both to the Hospital Wing. At that point I wasn’t really even surprised to see that everyone was awake.”
Harry gave Draco one quick, longing look. “Goodbye, Malfoy.” And with those words, he made his way to the front doors of Hogwarts, vanishing as he went inside.
Pansy was sitting by the side of his bed, her expression going from gloomy to amazement when she saw that Draco was awake.
Potter slightly frowned at Draco, and moved aside, notifying for Draco to go ahead into the office first.
“Happy birthday!” She somewhat screamed over all the noise in the room.
Oh. “Oh.”
Pansy gave him a solemn look, but luckily didn’t press. She only said; “Okay. But please come to me if you ever want to talk. About anything. Including
What the cloaked figure had said was utterly crazy and ridiculous, and could not possibly be true. Right? He wanted to believe it not to be true, but he had a nagging feeling spreading throughout him that the figure was right. Draco couldn’t be sure, since the two week timeline wasn’t up yet, and nothing dangerous had come to pass, but his gut told him he should listen to the figure.
She wasn’t wrong.
“How did I end up here? I was in the therapy classroom, right? If I remember correctly…” Draco asked as he looked around the room. There was no one else in the Hospital Wing at the moment other than himself and Madame Pomfrey.
. Well, they never said anything to him about his ill-mannered mouth. Draco really did have a hard time believing they actually enjoyed Kaspian’s company, but they always let him hang around, which annoyed Draco to no end.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just finishing up this Transfiguration paper,” Draco responded.
Of course, there were some people who were still weary; who didn’t believe the article, or the Source, but those people were few and far between. Everyone and their mum believed Aurors to be trustworthy.
It was funny how two weeks could make every difference in the world; how you could feel whole within not even fourteen days, when you spent eighteen years feeling empty.
“In the last days of school for Alec, I requested that he go and find the book, hidden somewhere in the library. I couldn’t remember exactly where it had been, so I told him to search
“I would like to know that myself. But what I do know, is that even though we’re in this horrible situation, we’re having a streak of luck, and you can’t deny it.”
be the death of me,” Harry laughed, sitting down beside Draco, their thighs brushing somewhat.
“You hear that, right?” Harry asked, scared shitless from the sound, from what Draco could tell.
“I’m guessing it’s from your mother?” Blaise said through a mouth full of breakfast.
And, by Pomfrey saying, “Last time,” she meant the last time she would have to put healing salve and wrap up Draco’s forearm.
He still got some nasty glares, and made people huddle closer together and whisper to each other when he was around, but it was much improved from before.
His eyes shot open, and quickly adjusted to the brightness of the room.
However, his relief quickly turned into anger directed towards the man who had
Draco had to admit, he felt a hint of gratitude for Harry, since he had left well enough alone when he suspected Draco had been lying about what had been tapping at the window. On the other hand, if Harry had voiced his suspicions aloud then, Draco probably would have revealed all the secrets he’d been keeping right then and there, and they wouldn’t have ended up kissing each other while Draco had been full of lies.
“It’s a children’s book, Harry. Obviously.” Draco rolled his eyes.
For some reason Draco felt like crying. He felt like crying and crying and crying until there weren’t any tears left. He felt so pathetic sitting next to Harry, who had his life figured out. Who was still thirty nine years old.
“I’m sure your body is perfect, Draco.”
“What?” Draco asked.
Draco had a horrible, sickening feeling that the figure was sending some kind of message, telling Draco to
“Yeah. And everyone in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade is asleep. As in no one is moving, and haven’t moved since Saturday night. But they’re all breathing so I am pretty certain no one is dead.”
. And you survived it. How…”
chose to follow him and you saw how horrifying he really was first hand, so, unlike people who fought on the right side, even after all this time you still can’t bear to hear
“You know about this place?” Harry asked.
Draco did as he was asked, and practically shoved the book in front of Snape’s face.
Pansy put her hand on Draco’s arm, sensing him tensing up at the sight of the Aurors.
“Aren’t you going to explain to me what your plan is and what it has been all along?” Draco asked, another spell hitting his protective shield.
He’d compared Harry to the universe; to the stars and to all the planets, but Harry was much greater than that. He was the person who completed Draco. He was brighter than any star in the universe.
Potter had been trying to master the spell for the last six hours. At first Draco had been more than happy to help Potter learn the spell, but after the first two hours, he had lost interest. He knew he should have been helping, but Potter was
wrong. Not that he hadn’t deducted that from everything that had happened that morning, but Potter voicing what happened on his end made Draco sure something was definitely up.
“I’m positive.”
“That you need to forgive yourself first, before you allow others to forgive you.”
“Hey,” Draco said.
“The year is not over yet, though. You still have plenty of time,” Draco added, tapping into his optimistic side.
“You’re right,” Draco agreed.
A potion that might not even work.
He then looked down at his chest and stared at the rest of what the
He didn’t know when, but at some point Harry’s lips found their way to Draco’s torso, and he kissed every scar there was. He found his way to Draco’s neck, and bit down hard in multiple places, covering them up with kisses. Draco was in pure bliss, his head thrown back and embarrassing noises escaping his mouth.
Draco didn’t get to watch his own memories, only the Aurors and McGonagall did. He sat in his hospital bed as Pansy talked to him about whatever. He wasn’t really listening.
He felt the Mark starting to burn more fiercely, and he wondered if he really had made progress. Of course, it wasn’t himself causing the burning, as much as he wished it was, but the Mark itself flaring, as it was quite literally alive. As it had been for two weeks.
“It’s not that,” Draco said. “It’s just--” he choked on his words. And then his words left him all together. He didn’t know what to say to Harry.
“Are you sure?” Pomfrey asked nervously. “I’d rather you sleep for another night-”
Draco stared at Potter. He honestly didn’t know what to say to him.
“I’m thinking,” Draco started, and Harry lifted his chin while Draco turned his body so that he was completely facing Harry. “I’m thinking about you. I can’t stop thinking about you, Harry Potter.”
Harry coughed, bringing Draco out of his thoughts. “‘I’m surprised you didn’t want to test the potion out on Alec, since you seem to…” Harry made a grandiose gesture with his wand that was held in his hand, and the wand went flying across the room, hitting the side of Slughorn’s desk. “Whoops.”
want to hear about fucking Kaspian. Was he jealous? Maybe a little. But he had every right to be. Kaspian was a downright dick and Harry still became friends with him right off the bat! Draco had been a dick and… he and Harry only just became friends. Sure, he and Kaspian’s situations were different, but the dick part wasn’t.
“Ha. I doubt I’ll be able to find a job at all. Though, hopefully, with my NEWTs, at most one person will offer me some kind of job opportunity. I honestly don’t care what it is, as long as I can get some sort of payment.”
“I’m going to miss this place.”
“You called me Draco,” Draco smirked.
Potter stopped a couple feet ahead of him, and noticed Draco was no longer with him. He turned around and spotted Draco, frowning as he walked closer. “Malfoy, what’s wrong?”
Drys was inside Hogwarts’ protective ward; the one McGonagall had expertly put up.
“I mean, I guess your welcome?”
It’s just Professor Wynn is
“Sorry I’m late, Father,” someone called out.
“Night, Harry.”
. Draco had been mortified.
Once it was certainly clear Draco had lost the duel, and he was lying on his back, at Drys’ mercy, Drys had given him one last option. It was clear that Drys loved to toy with Draco, make him choose between two impossible options, however one option always being the kind that “hero's” would choose.
that there was somehow some way to get out of what was inevitably going to happen. In the back of his mind he thought,
“It’s Drys Kaspian. Alec’s father. The one whose name is engraved on the entrance to the Garden,” Harry said, though he wasn’t whispering. The Figure-
Harry shook his head in exasperation. “It was always slightly suspicious how Alec could do all of these amazing spells, spells I’d never heard a whisper of. I never thought twice about where his father had learned them.”
“Uhm, not really, no. He just… he wants to talk to me but I don’t want to talk to him. Well I do, I do want to talk to him, but I just can’t…” Draco trailed off, rubbing at his eyes. “I don’t really want to talk about Harry today. Maybe another time.”
Harry’s eyebrows nearly flew off his forehead. “Nearly twelve? Wow, I didn’t know it was so late.”
“You needed Harry’s blood to break the wards? That’s all you needed?”
There was an unspoken agreement between them: Draco would be the one to pour the potion into Theo’s mouth, and Harry was the one who always held possession of Snape’s book.
Harry opened one of his eyes to peer at Draco, who was fiddling with his jumper. “Ginny and I just didn’t work out. I was gone for more than half a year last year, and I don’t know if things can ever be repaired between us in a boyfriend and girlfriend way. We’re better off as friends.”
He had been alone for at most ten minutes, and he already began to miss Harry more than his mind could even comprehend. They promised never to separate, but here they both were, breaking that key rule, and not for the first time.
McGonagall continued. “You have shown great strength over the past weeks, Draco. And you handled your situation, as far as I can tell from what I and the Ministry saw, extremely well and maturely--” Draco started to blush-- “and you will be pleased to hear that you do not need an escort to enter into Hogsmeade anymore.” Draco was about to open his mouth when McGonagall cut him off. “Furthermore, you will now be able to cast defensive spells. You can cast any spells in fact. You won’t get in trouble for doing so.”
“You are all coming with me,” the leader spoke.
Still not meeting Harry’s eyes quite yet, and trying to quell the bubbles in his stomach, he set the necklace at the edge of the table, and picked up the last item. An Anemonlea flower was frozen in some type of preservation spell; trapped in a glassy crystal ball. Draco took a wild guess, and theorized that it was the same flower Harry had stuck in his hair the night of their kiss. Draco had left it back at the pavilion after their fight the next morning.
“Okay great, what is it?”
“Okay, we are getting extremely lucky lately,” Potter stated as he pushed the book closer to Draco.
“Draco,” His head snapped up at the use of his given name, however he didn’t quite meet her eyes, “I-”
Draco hated many things. He had even mentally made a list of all those things.
“Correct,” Harry said.
“Anyyywayy,” Harry mused. “I believe it is time for you to have your first listen to songs on a Muggle radio.”
Potter blinked at him, showing no emotion. “And?”
Was Harry mad at him? Harry looked mad. Or was Harry afraid of him? Was Harry afraid that Draco was going to almost kill him again? Was he nervous about being in the presence of a murderer? Did he only bring Draco to the House Elves, away from all of the people in the Great Hall, because he pitied him?
Because of all the research he ended up reading thanks to the books on Sleeping Draught, he was starting to wonder if it might have been possible that the whole school had drunk a heavy dose of Sleeping Draught simultaneously. At that point he was convinced he was starting to go mad, but a small part of him still thought there was a slight possibility of it happening.
“Professor Slughorn, sir, Malfoy doesn’t have a partner.”
. “Help!”
“Oh.” Potter looked surprised that Slughorn didn’t just agree with him and let him work with his two best friends.
“Father of Alec Kaspian and husband of Olive Kaspian née Brightly?”
Draco guessed what happened next was because Harry had accidentally stepped on the book he’d dropped. Harry came tumbling down right on top of Draco again, except this time his head was mere inches from Draco’s, Harry’s body almost fully covering Draco’s.
He instantly ran over to the toilet, and started dry heaving into it. It was all a lot to take in. He had hoped the Mark would have stopped
So, Pansy and Draco sought comfort together in their loneliness. Although Pansy still had people who liked her, like Theo and Blaise.
The remaining Purebloods were all scared of death, and the Halfbloods and Muggle-Borns were enjoying living a free life.
“So,” Draco spoke, “we should
“I can’t just-”
“We know the gist of what is going on, yes. We cannot move out of our portraits, and I sense a magical presence around Hogwarts that I have not felt before,” Snape said.
“Can’t sleep,” Draco spoke honestly.
“Whoa,” Draco said.
“Oh.” Draco was taken aback. He had been one hundred percent sure Harry was dying to become an Auror. Fighting crime, bringing criminals to justice, and saving the world a hundred times over. He also knew, from his father’s experience working in the Ministry, it was a ton of paperwork and desk work and boring jobs to complete under the Head Auror’s instructions.
“I’m sorry,” Potter said across the table from Draco. Draco rolled his eyes and was about to open his mouth when Potter cut him off. “Before you say anything, I’m apologizing for what’s to come. If we’re going to be sleeping in the same room every night together, you should know that I have pretty bad nightmares. Sometimes I wake up Ron and everyone else in my dorm, and I know it annoys them even though they say otherwise. But, yeah. I just thought I should tell you.”
“Did you even hear anything I said?” Pansy questioned with an irritated look on her face.
“I’ll do it,” Draco said confidently.
“So, should we head to the library after this? We should use our second question to ask the book if there’s something that can break a barrier spell,” Potter spoke up, breaking their silence- which was thankfully comfortable silence.
“Sorry, Draco, I didn’t mean to startle you. I just thought we could maybe have a little chat,” She spoke over the loud noises of people talking and chairs skidding across the floor.
“Something is very wrong here,” Potter said urgently as his eyes continued to wander.
Draco raised his head, wiping the grime and tears from his face with the back of his hand. “You!” Draco yelled, his voice raspy. “What have you done to him?”
to console Potter, but he couldn’t think of anything to do that wasn’t awkward or weird.
“I realized then,” Harry continued on, as if Draco hadn’t just stuttered through a sentence. “That you were-
Draco had not been expecting that. “Yes.” His answer came out abrupt, and Draco hoped Harry couldn’t tell how desperate Draco was to sleep in his bed again.
Draco didn’t exactly know what he was expecting to find when he came to this broom closet. People wanting him to suffer, surely. He really was just curious, and he didn’t want to have to spend more time alone with Pansy than was needed. He was grateful for a friend though, for someone who actually chose to spend time with him. But, she got rather annoying and bitchy very fast. Especially when it came to meal times. Pansy was always complaining about how thin Draco was, and how he should eat more. He knew she was right. But Draco never liked to admit he was wrong. So he always just snapped at her when she brought it up, and she snapped back. It was like an endless cycle of snarky and ruthless remarks.
“What?” Draco said uneasily. He grabbed the worn-out book from Potter hesitantly.
Draco glanced down, unable to look into Harry’s eyes anymore since a small smile formed on his face. “Ugh. You’re unbelievable. Stop coming back. Stop doing all of this for me. I don’t deserve it. I don’t deserve you.”
Draco didn’t finish what he was saying. “Can I ask you something?”
The last thing he heard before meeting darkness, like it was an old friend, was screams, and one simple sentence.
“The spells inside the book are easy to learn and wouldn’t frustrate me. Also, I’m pretty sure those spells won’t come close to breaking my probation if I cast them.”
“It’s probably the most obvious one to spot. It’s also called the Little Bear, or the Little Dipper. We learned about it in Astronomy, remember?”
Draco told Harry about his vision that night and explained how it was similar to last night, even though it really hadn’t been, and he made sure not to add any extra details regarding the offer, or really anything the figure said to him. It was sort of pointless telling Harry the same details again, but it was better than lying completely and saying he had had no messages from the figure at all.
“When did you meet Alec?” Draco was genuinely curious. He also didn’t want to stray to the topic of the war at the moment, he was sure his role would somehow be brought up.
Alec continued: “So, yeah, we were dueling and Harry slipped up at one point, which gave me the chance to cast this brilliant curse I learned that can make someone ill, and while Harry was distracted with the overwhelming feeling of sickness, I cast the body-binding curse and levitated him to my father.” Alec was beaming with pride. “Quite exceptional, don’t you think? A Mudblood defeating the savior of the Wizarding World!”
It was done in a couple of seconds, and Draco already felt lighter. His wand didn’t have a lock on it that prevented him from performing certain spells anymore. It felt amazing.
“Uh, no problem.” Draco wanted to tell Snape the only reason he had ventured into the Headmistress’s office was to get information on the book, and not to check on the portraits' well-being, but he decided against it. “So, um, about the book.” He waved the book out in front of him.
As they walked to Slughorn’s classroom together, talking about whatever came to their minds, like Quidditch and their favorite kinds of food, Draco became exceedingly aware of how much of a difference Potter was acting today, compared to the night before.
“I will protect you with my life,” Harry said. He sounded like he meant it. “And-”
“I haven’t done anything,” the Figure said simply.
“Do you even know what you’re doing?” Draco asked skeptically, making his way to the counter.
She hardly seemed to notice him, even as he started taking out his quill.
“We should head back inside before the snow gets really bad,” Potter stated, pulling his coat tighter around himself.
“Draco. Look at me,” Harry said, and Draco forced himself to look up into Harry’s dazzling green eyes. “You did everything you could. You couldn’t have done anything differently. And we don’t know for sure what Sunday is going to bring, but we’ll find out when it happens. Together.”
Then the noises had died down and Draco was left alone, cursing inwardly at himself.
Harry’s words were like a punch to the gut. Harry wanted to live a normal life. In no way humanly possible would Harry ever be allowed to live a normal life with Draco. Not that Draco thought about what his life would be like if he and Harry were… boyfriends? Partners? He still hadn’t conjured up the right word to describe their made up relationship in his fantasies.
“But killing you wouldn’t be as fun. I want you to be alive to witness all of the deaths you caused. I want you to suffer. Isn’t that clear?”
He wasn’t sure if he should just blurt out
Draco shot up from his chair and grabbed his belongings. Harry was looking at Pansy with anger and looking at Draco with longing.
“Hi, Professor.” His hands were starting to become extremely sweaty, but he refused to wipe them on his robes, which would clearly show the two former headmasters how nervous he was, if they couldn’t already tell.
Once Harry had read both letters, Draco took them back and stuffed them away. Harry was keeping silent. Whether that was a good or bad thing, Draco was not sure.
It was around ten o’clock on Friday, and Draco and Harry were crowded around the bubbling cauldron filled with the Restorative Potion; Snape’s book propped open in Harry’s hands.
“But I don’t think it really matters now. The Ministry is probably under the same curse Hogwarts is under. They would never know.”
Draco could tell Potter’s optimism was wearing down, and that made the small ounce of his own optimism wither away completely.
Harry huffed, and Draco heard the rustling of covers coming from Harry’s side of the room. “So… do you want to- sleep? In bed. Next to me.”
Draco still had many questions to ask Harry, and he was positive Harry felt the same way regarding Draco, but it was nice for a change to forget about life’s problems and enjoy a meal together. Which was extremely weird to think about, considering that before the Curse started, he and Harry had rarely ever even acknowledged each other’s existence.
It was funny how days ago, those words had held value. Harry had cared for him. Harry had trusted him. Harry had wanted to have Draco in his life.
But right now Pansy, Blaise, Granger and Weasley were waiting for them, and they were damn well going to enjoy their last couple of days at Hogwarts.
saw her feed it, and yet Mr. Cat was still alive. He came to the conclusion that the animals were fine.
He found an empty table and sat down at a chair that was adorned in black ribbons, resting his elbows on the table and his chin in his hand. What a pathetic sight this must be, he thought. It was his birthday, and he was sitting alone at a table. He wished he’d have kept the drink Hermione had given him, so he’d have something to sip on while he people watched.
Realization was dawning on Draco, and a lump was forming in his throat. He didn’t think he could speak quite yet.
“Okay, Pansy,” he said at last, “if you’d please-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sounds like you had shit friends.”
He murdered his father. However much unintentional it had been, he’d still done it.
“And, well, Draco, you’re going to be under the Mark's power, but fully aware of everything going on around you, and not having any power to stop it. Just like all of the others.
It was like those words, those subdued, soft words, had undone something inside of Draco. They had made their way throughout Draco’s core, breaking every barrier, every hidden emotion, and every feeling he had tucked so far away, far enough where no one would ever, ever break him.
Next chapter... sometime!
“You’re going to be just fine. Just rest. No need to speak,” Draco said.
Pansy squeezed his arm and he could practically feel Blaise smiling.
However, Draco did know how to deal with blood. He wasn’t amazing at healing spells, but he knew some that would more or less get the job done.
and deem him a hero.
They walked out of the library, and Draco looked longingly down the corridor that led to the fifth floor. It was stupid, since they were going to eventually make it to the Garden, but making a stop in the Room would take away their already limited time.
Draco had to guess that the students all presumed Harry had done all the saving, and Draco all the evil plotting.
“Hi,” Harry responded, apparently as dazed as Draco.
“He won’t tell anyone, trust me. He’s weak and embarrassed.”
He had to know. It would ease his mind if he took a look at his arm.
“Okay, then,” Draco breathed. He was quite mortified about what was to come, but he knew Harry wouldn’t break his promise. Give him hateful looks, maybe, but he wouldn’t run.
Draco nodded at both of his old professors. “I will.”
“I mean, only if you’re up for it.” Harry challenged. The little shit.
“If you hadn’t wanted this to happen, you should have confided in me. I trusted you, Draco. You specifically told me you wouldn’t hold back any vital information from your visions.”
It was crazy loud, music blasting from a wireless and the chattering of mostly eighth year students filling the enclosed space. Draco spotted Harry instantly, surrounded by Gryffindors at a table in the center of the room, sipping a drink. His black hair was tousled more than usual and his nose and cheeks were pink. Draco stopped breathing for a moment, until Pansy pushed him farther inside.
“I do.” Draco smiled. All his suspicions about Potter were now confirmed by the man himself. All the times Draco had watched Potter in the Great Hall, with a distant and depressing look on his face, had been because Potter was still in the stage of grieving for what all had happened during the war. He felt a great amount of sympathy for The Boy Who Lived.
“Oh, Draco. Don’t make me cry again.”
They laid out the book on defensive spells on top of the table they had been occupying, and started skimming through pages trying to find spells that seemed useful in a showdown.
“I did, in fact. My wand was on Alec, and the Aurors gave it back to me when they captured him. Why do you ask?”
They worked until it was midnight, and Draco had perfected the potion. All they had to do was check back on it every twelve hours for seven days, and they’d be set. They had nine days left until two weeks were up, so if they kept on schedule, they would be done with the potion with two days to spare. That thought was very relieving; everything would turn out okay in the end.
Potter regarded Draco, and he looked like he was trying to come up with a valid answer, but was struggling with how to word it. After what felt like a whole bloody hour, but in reality was only like ten seconds, Potter finally responded.
“No kidding.”
He wanted his mother. He wanted to be wrapped up in her warm embrace. He wished he would have written back to her the last time she’d sent a letter.
Draco hoped it was the former option. The prospect of pulling apart random lips while hoping the person with said parted lips didn’t choke on the potion in their sleep, was quite frankly anxiety inducing and disgusting.
So far, all the books Draco had looked through held no relevant information whatsoever. They talked all about Dreamless Sleep Potions, Sleeping Draught, and everything in between, but no sleeping curses.
“Okay. Fine,” Draco said as he turned back around to face the fire. “Now, let’s get ready for bed, I’m tired and- ah!” Draco’s hand immediately tightened around his left forearm.
He groaned and yanked his sleeve down forcefully. It wasn’t burning like it had been the night before, but there was still a faint pain.
Draco arrived at his dormitory and opened his door. He walked inside, breathing a deep sigh of relief that there was no one else in the room yet, and set his stuff down on his bed, which was the closest to the window. He then got out his pyjamas.
“No, I’m fine,” He lied.
“Why are you even here, Malfoy? It’s the middle of January and you seriously haven’t picked up on any indication that no one wants you at Hogwarts?” Theo drawled from beside Smith. The two of them were getting even closer to Draco.
Here they were now, Draco grasping the edge of the sink and Harry consistently knocking on the door, not leaving well enough alone.
Draco wanted to say more, whatever more was. But Drys pointed his wand again at Draco saying, “Let’s duel.”
“I just- I’m just so confused! Why- how could you do this to me?” Harry said, his eyes full of flames. “After everything we’ve been through. You lied. You put us both in danger. And now we don’t have any time left to fix things. I actually was starting to believe your visions held no truth, but now that I know the Figure
But there was something about Harry’s reaction, and his warmth and magic and whole persona, that made Draco really, incredibly… whole. He’d figured out that part over the weeks of the sleeping curse, but there had never been a life or death situation before to challenge that thought. But, the thought was officially challenged.
Harry pointed his wand at the wall Draco had run into, and a large portion of stone broke apart from the wall. At first, Draco was sure the block of stone would’ve fallen to the ground, like anything would have done, but the stone piece flew back
“If you’re sure…”
He had his first private therapy session with Elizabeth. Which was a huge step in the right direction for him.
Harry shook his head, grimacing. “I’m sorry, I’m not explaining myself well enough. You’re right, it doesn’t exactly make up for… everything that happened, during the war and before the war, but, I just want you to know that deep down, you are a good person, Draco Malfoy. You’re becoming an even better person every day. You’re changing. You’ve changed. I can see it now, even if it did take a while. Do you think I would have been able to survive two whole weeks with the old Malfoy? Because I am certain I wouldn’t have.”
Draco cursed under his breath. He was most certainly
Snape’s eyebrows raised and Dumbledore glanced to the side to look at Snape. “Draco, what is this about?” Snape asked.
He told Harry how Harry’s blood had allowed Hogwarts’ protective shield to fall, which let Drys’ Death Eaters come to his side. Draco looked away and ran his palms across his thighs as he explained how whatever spell Drys had used to control the Death Eaters had been trying to reign him in, too. How his Mark had burned so horribly; and how somehow Draco had ‘resisted’ the pull.
Draco looked Narcissa in the eye and steadied his feet, hoping he wasn’t coming off extremely anxious. “I’m gay,” he finally blurted out.
“You should really be in class.”
“Dead? I don’t think so. He’s still breathing. But, he’s not waking up.” Draco was trying his hardest not to become angry. It was incredibly difficult, when all he could see and think about was red hot anger; angry at himself for not brewing the potion correctly, angry at the world for not letting him have this one victory, and angry at the Figure for foreseeing his failure, somehow.
“Oh, yeah, I’ve known about it for a while,” Draco responded absently.
“Yep,” Draco said as he handed Snape’s book back to Potter, like it was some known agreement Potter was the rightful owner of the book. He then recited everything Snape had told him about the book to Potter, who nodded his head and looked extremely excited at the amount of luck they had for procuring the book in the first place.
He was about to rest his head back on Harry’s shoulder when Harry lifted his free hand, brushing away the tears on Draco’s face.
he thought.
“Uhh,” Draco said, “thanks.”
The sentence that Draco didn’t have to say, the sentence they were both thinking:
Draco met Elizabeth in the same, almost empty, classroom where group sessions were held. Even with no one else in the room besides the two of them, he was terrified. His hands shook and his feet tapped at the floor. Elizabeth just smiled at him. He reminded himself that it was for his own good. And maybe, just maybe they could work out why Harry was affecting Draco’s life so much.
Draco had hugged his mother so tight after that, he thought he would never let go.
“You got this. Just try again,” Draco shouted from his seat as he thumbed through a book on dragons.
Harry gently took Draco’s hand, and dropped the necklace into his palm. Draco could feel the cold chain resting on his skin, but the gem was rather warm, like it had its own heartbeat, like it was somewhat alive.
Potter shook his head. “I’m pretty sure I did it right. Look,” Potter showed Draco the page and pointed at different parts, “It’s a simple spell. It’s not supposed to be hard at all. The movement required isn’t even difficult.”
He knew Pomfrey would scold him for leaving the Hospital Wing, but he was trying to save her life, so hopefully she would look past his disobedience and just be grateful.
“Make your decision quickly. I have the spell on the tip of my tongue that will make you obey me. However, you can choose to give into the Mark, Draco. Do it already, and everything will be over before you know it,” Drys said.
“When did you learn Latin?” Draco was unbelieving that Harry had just spat out a Latin sentence.
“You’ll what now?” Potter looked concerned.
As Draco watched Potter lazily stare at the pages of the book in front of him, he realized he needed to do something other than research counter-curses that weren’t getting them anywhere.
He’d woken up with absolutely no visions, once again, and had been exceedingly angry and relieved all at once. He’d kept thinking of reasons why the visions could have stopped. It made him nervous that he hadn’t had one in a while, it made him think something awful was coming their way shortly. On the other hand, he thought it could have been a sign things were looking up and nothing that serious was going on in Hogwarts after all. The latter thought however had been debunked in his mind, since his Mark still burnt furiously Wednesday night and Thursday morning.
do something wrong?”
“Draco. How lovely to see you,” Snape said as he watched Draco step closer to his portrait.
“And now we match,” he observed, and then started to touch the scar created by a curse that had meant to kill him twice.
He briefly had to explain Drys and his powers, how he was able to transport Draco to the scene of Olive’s death with the flick of his wand, and how Drys created visions that were supposed to represent Draco’s future, based off of his own decisions.
“I have something I actually need to thank you for.”
“How do you know so much about Pansy?”
He couldn’t answer the question, he just couldn’t.
He sat against the farthest wall of the tower, his mind replaying the scene when he’d held Dumbledore at wandpoint on repeat. After a while, it got tiring, but no less sickening. He watched Snape use the killing curse, and watched himself freeze in absolute fear, and the dawning realization that
I'm expecting the next chapter to be maybe 10k words? So it really will take me a while to write, but I'm excited for the challenge :)
One step forwards, two steps back.
“Yes, you were. But after you passed out, Hermione Granger came to get me, and I levitated you here. You’ve been asleep since last night.”
Harry stopped dancing when he saw Draco sit down, and a frown spread across his face. “Don’t you want to dance? Do you not like the song?”
“Oh, shit. I never knew. I’m-”
Draco continued to sit up in his bed, and pushed all thoughts about the vision-like-dream from his mind. He found he was surprisingly hungry. He looked over at the little bedside table next to him, expecting there to be food or tea set out, because he knew Madame Pomfrey couldn’t resist fussing over him and making sure he ate, especially breakfast which he knew people argued was ‘the most important meal of the day.’ But there was nothing on the table safe for his wand, an empty water glass, and a bandage wrap…
Draco shrugged. He didn’t know how to respond to that question. If he said no, she would assume he didn’t enjoy spending time with her. If he said yes, well, he’d be lying to her. “It was okay, I guess,” He said, looking out the window.
“Great.”
“Why not his mum?” Draco glanced at the signatures. “Olive Brightly? You haven’t met her?”
“Draco, wake up!”
Starts at "Before he even registered" and ends at "Reparifors"
Finally, one worked, and the door flew open. Potter scrambled in, apparently too freezing to stand outside a minute longer. Draco didn’t know why he didn’t just cast a warming charm, but he could have asked himself the same question.
Drys stepped closer towards Draco, his wand pointed at him. “I needed the blood of the Death Eater’s you see, because I needed to control them, I needed them all under
side. Something that tied him and made him a servant to
Draco blinked. “What? A horror what?”
“I’d like to see you try,” Potter retorted, however lightheartedly.
Potter of course had been the one saying they should go see him that very day, since he didn’t want to waste anymore time sitting around doing nothing. Draco had to reason with him that it was getting really late and they- which meant Potter- had been working hard on spell casting and needed rest.
A twisting sensation took over him, and then another thought formed in his head:
Today was a Friday.
“Yeah, sure.” Harry was certainly confused.
“Yeah, yeah, whatever. Hey, I was going to go to the library to pick out a few books, come with?” Draco asked.
Maybe he really was.
Drys saw where Draco was looking, and stepped a little farther away from Draco, turning his full attention to Harry, wand raised and a face full of vexation.
Draco rushed out in front of Harry again, soaking his nice clothes to the brim- not that they hadn’t already been ruined from the night before.
Draco almost laughed. “
“You didn’t let me finish, as usual. I was going to say that, while you were… using the Cruciatus, I saw your face. Your face was full of regret and pain, and to be honest, that was one of the only times I felt sympathy for you in the past couple years, and realized how human you were.” Harry chose his words carefully, Draco could tell, but they still stung.
“Fine,” Draco said as Potter moved past him, starting his journey to McGonagall’s office. Draco moved in the opposite direction, glancing around the halls and wondering how strange it was that no one else was around. It was almost unnerving. Almost. It was actually nice to walk around Hogwarts without having to worry about getting hexed or jinxed at any moment.
And then Harry kissed him.
Once he passed the gargoyle, his mind completely focused on Harry, thinking of all the different places he could be.
Please leave a kudos or comment if you'd like, it really motivates me to keep on writing!
too blatant, not to mention creepy. It was all so strange, the two of them finally being alone after all this time. They’d been confined to each other’s space, attached to the hip for two weeks straight about a month ago.
Please let me know what you think of the story so far, I really appreciate any type of feedback <3
“I didn’t choose to be stuck in a broom closet. Now,
Draco looked up from the letter. Pansy was looking expectedly at him, with wide eyes. He honestly didn’t know what to think. Yes, he hated the Manor now, but it was his childhood home. The thought of giving it up was weird. He supposed he would think it over some other time. He had other things to worry about right now. Like the fact that breakfast was almost over and it was time to go to Potions.
“Fun Spells to Cast,” Draco told Harry.
with his own wand as he got farther away from the lights in Hogsmeade, and he thanked himself for casting the spell because without it he would have tripped about a thousand times already over fallen branches and holes in the ground.
He also mentally cursed Potter. In Draco’s mind’s eye, he was throwing Potter into a pit of venomous snakes, and Draco was standing at the top of the pit, happily watching Potter getting eaten alive.
Draco wondered what Harry meant by saying,
Harry’s face softened even more, but at the same time, he still seemed angry and upset. He didn’t say anything, though. He was obviously waiting for Draco to speak first.
When he had come to the only broom closet he knew of on the seventh floor, and had spotted no one around, that had only reassured him it was a trap. So, annoyed with his own overflowing sense of curiosity, and wanting to leave as soon as possible, he had turned himself around and was about to walk away and start his journey towards Transfigurations when he heard a door slam open.
“So, did you get your wand back? You know, after Alec took it?” Draco implored while stacking food on his fork.
- he truly believed Harry would defend him.
She knew nothing of what he was going through. Not even close.
“See! Luck! We’re lucky!” Harry clearly wanted to bounce up and down, but he was holding himself back from the movement because Draco was with him. Honestly, Draco could care less if Harry wanted to act like a child; Draco wanted to bounce up and down too.
“I had to put Hogwarts and Hogsmeade under a sleeping curse, to try and motivate you, Draco. Hogsmeade is too close to Hogwarts, though, to not notice something was wrong, so they had to be under the sleeping curse too. I knew that you’d want to be the hero so badly, you would certainly take any offer of mine to save hundreds of lives. Sure, I threatened your family, but you needed
over here-” Kaspian emphasized ‘Draco’ very noticeably- “because you knew he wouldn’t have a partner and everyone else would, so you would get to work with him.”
He was also aware of the awkward position he was in. He was sort of straddling Harry. He instantly corrected himself, moving to sit directly beside Harry again, the world stopped even as he changed his position. He was still incredibly close to Harry.
His body was almost pleading him to fucking hide his worst mistake, and oh how he wanted to give into that pull.
Draco had felt like they were having a moment, just then. A special moment. But, in that moment, he realized one of the reasons he couldn’t breathe was because Harry had been pressed against him so hard he’d been suffocating slightly.
“Fine.”
“Did you just call me Draco?” He raised an eyebrow at Potter, who finally let go of Draco’s elbow. Draco found he missed his touch, even if it was freezing cold.
“I’ll try again, though.” Potter did attempt the spell again. And again. And again, until he had probably cast the charm about fifteen times, and each time it never worked.
The problem was, Draco didn’t know which one to take. He wished he could have both, but that would be completely selfish, and Draco was working on fixing that. “I think i’ll take the first one.”
“Is it soppy to say I missed you too?”
“I’m not splitting up from you, Potter. I’m just resting.” Draco informed Potter, who was now walking over to where Draco was seated.
Draco agreed. He got out of bed and headed for the bathroom, where he got dressed and ready for the day. His arm was throbbing a bit, but he wouldn’t look at it. He would not obsess over it. It wasn’t worth the energy at the moment.
He obviously didn’t have any control over the situation, since it had happened while he was passed out, but still.
“You mean save you?”
“Malfoy? What’s wrong?” Potter asked. His voice was full of concern.
“Yes! We are! Stop being such a let down and go have fun for once in your life. All the Eighth Years are going to Hogsmeade tonight. We booked The Three Broomsticks so it will just be us, no strangers.”
“Harry, I can’t believe you.” Draco shook his head in disbelief. “You did all of that… for me.”
“First of all, none of your business. Second, I
“Malfoy, look, I’m sorry. That was a real dick move back there.” Potter said.
Madame Pomfrey? You threw jinxes at her like I did with my friends?”
They both stood a good distance away from each other, and Draco couldn’t help but notice the crowd of Death Eaters as he looked past Drys. He wondered what Drys was doing with them since he obviously hated them all.
Harry looked convinced, and Draco was grateful. “Oh, okay,” Harry said, moving around Draco to close the window.
“I agree.” They both laughed.
“Let me see!” Draco all but shouted as he tried to grab the paper from Pansy, but failed to grasp it because she was a
at him just because.
When it was Draco’s turn to stand in front of the Wizengamot, Potter had spoken on his behalf.
“Harry, I’m sorry. For- for fourth year. When I said and reported those horrible things that ended up in the prophet.” Draco was trembling now, but he knew he needed to keep up the momentum. “I was such a dick back then, and I regret everything I did. I realize now that what I did to you and your friends was wrong in so many ways. I know apologies don’t really do shit, but I really am sorry, for everything, and I don’t expect you to forgive me now or ever.”
Also Friday’s. Friday’s were dreadful.
) really be murdered? He liked to think it was all bluff, but once again he couldn’t assume the offer was full of lies, sent just to mess with him. He wouldn’t be the one responsible for more deaths.
Butterflies filled his stomach and the warmest feeling imaginable encased Draco as he stared at the back of Harry’s head. He was right there.
By the end of their tenth listen to the song, they were both completely out of breath, and couldn’t stop laughing, which didn’t help their out of breath problem. They perched on the water fountain, right next to the radio which was now playing a set of random songs that Harry definitely didn’t ask it to play.
Draco didn’t respond. He followed quickly behind Pansy and left the kitchen.
Apparently, according to Pansy, she knew she had been under a sleeping curse, but couldn’t do anything about it. It had been like she was a tiny little bug living inside her eyes, able to see and hear certain things, but not able to escape. The analogy creeped Draco out.
“Well to answer your question, Albus and I have a protection charm placed on our portraits. No curse or hex or any means of dark magic can harm us. Others encased in frames are not so lucky.” Snape turned his head to look at his neighboring portraits; all sound asleep. “We were curious as to what exactly was going on. When we found out we couldn’t move to other portraits inside the castle or out, we knew something was terribly wrong. When Minerva hadn’t arrived at her office for days, our suspicions were mostly confirmed.” Snape returned his gaze back to Draco. “But thank you for coming in here, Draco. Even though our worst intuitions are now confirmed, I am glad we now know what exactly is going on out in the world.” There was the faintest of smiles on Snape’s face.
him and Harry. Draco was certain he was a goner, the stone was flying so fast directly towards his face, and he was frozen in fear, not moving at all.
. It felt like he was eleven years old again. Not withholding the weight of a Dark Lord or war on his shoulders.
” The door opened.
Harry’s face instantly reddened. Never a good sign. “Well, you’ll be displeased to know that I did, in fact, carry you up to the castle.”
Harry was directly across from him, and talking like a normal person seemed impossible. So much had happened. He wasn’t even sure his brain would be able to comprehend everything that had happened, let alone speak it out loud to Harry.
He went on, “I know I told you last time that everyone in this castle was asleep, and you know what Harry and I have been doing the past two weeks? Trying to save everyone’s arses, that's what. We needed that book to help us with some cure to wake everyone up, and we made the antidote alright, but when we tested it,
The Death Eater stepped through the doorway. Drys let them.
When Draco officially woke up and could actually think straight, he realized he was in the Hospital Wing. He was lying on a hospital bed, with covers up to his chest. He noticed he wasn’t in his school robes anymore, and was in a set of pyjamas that clearly weren’t his.
The magnificent water fountain splashed little drops onto their faces as they laid on their backs on the stone floor. The sky was charmed to hold the night sky, stars clearly mapping out constellations and shooting stars flying through it all from time to time.
They made their way out of the store and called over a cab from the side of the road.
“I don’t think you would, but can you please keep this to yourself? What I’m about to say. I wouldn’t want the press to find out.”
much attention.
He gave her a polite nod and turned his attention back over to Harry. He took the extra couple steps to get as close as possible to him, shoving his drink back into Hermione’s hand, and gave Harry a huge hug, holding onto him like they hadn’t seen each other in years.
you make your decision,” Drys stated, his impatience clearly visible.
+Sorry for my extremely long absence once again, I hope my readers are still here! I'll be posting the epilogue this weekend sometime
But before he could make his decision, a new scenario formed, transporting Draco. A vision that Drys definitely had not created.
“Whatever it is,
“I have a question,” Draco said, “For you.” He added at the last second so they both would know the question was only directed at Snape. And so that Dumbledore might possibly get the hint that Draco didn’t want him to talk. Not because he disliked Dumbledore, but because Draco was still severely ashamed of himself, and wouldn’t be able to have a conversation with him without having an anxiety attack.
Within that week, his mother had sat next to him in a small chair, talking about her plans of whether or not to sell the Manor, talking about different memories of her and Lucius during their Hogwarts days, and reminiscing on different moments from Draco’s childhood.
Draco quickly realized that his Mark no longer stung at all.
Draco was sort of interested in his non-enlightening upbringing, and wished Potter would keep on talking. Not in a bad way, but in an intrigued and I-want-to-get-to-know-you-better way. But that didn’t matter now, they had a potion to brew.
“Look, I’m scared too-”
“Malfoy, I don’t think Snape would lie to you, do you? If we have to share an extremely personal secret, so be it. I think it will be worth sharing if it means we’ll get an answer on how to solve the curse.”
The word ‘friendship’ now felt like a stab in the heart. Draco wanted to be more than friends so bad, but he would have to make do with what he had for a while. Until what, he didn’t know, but he at least hoped there would be an ‘until’.
There. He said it.
Draco had been perfectly content with just working by himself, like he did every time they had to work in partners in potions. Slughorn never seemed to care or notice.
He thought long and hard on his response, and finally, something came to mind. “This will probably sound ridiculous. But, I sort of briefly thought about becoming a writer?” His sentence turned into a question last minute.
Draco was dead.
He then realized that if one owl was awake at the moment, other animals had to be awake. He and Potter had certainly not taken into account all the animals running around Hogwarts. He wondered how well they were holding up without anyone feeding them, and then remembered that Pansy had a cat of her own and he
He looked at the doors that led to the Great Hall, watching as some people stopped to eye him warily, while others walked right into the Hall, not glancing back at the top of the stairs like some of the paranoid creeps.
Draco had thought the stares the students had given him in the hallways were bad. It was nothing compared to what the students in the Slytherin common room were like.
Everything that happened before he went to sleep last night came back to him in flashes. He remembered the Dark Mark
to each other, it was suffocating. Draco could now fully see Harry up close without his glasses, and he had to admit, Harry was stunning; his face the definition of perfect. His eyes so very green and his black hair that fell down over his forehead, brushing his long thick eyelashes, looked so soft. Hell, he knew his hair was soft from the night he had creepily run his fingers through it.
“Is there something bothering you?” She asked.
He didn’t want to tell her that the main reason he didn’t feel like eating today was because his mind kept thinking about how awful the day ahead of him would be. It was like he didn’t have time to eat; his brain didn’t have the mental capability to worry
“Really?”
Draco pulled out the leather bound book, the words “The Hearts’ Deepest Secret Will Uncover More Than What You Seek” engraved on the front. He showed the cover to Snape, walking towards his portrait so he could get a completely clear look at what Draco was yelling about.
He tried to pinpoint the exact moment when he had developed his futile crush, but found he couldn’t choose one specific moment to blame. It was a series of moments and conversations and years of jealousy and hatred rolled up into a messy ball of unrequited feelings.
“Back to the luck thing, Harry?” Draco asked. Always talking about
Dumbledore and Snape were staring at him. He tried to ignore them, but it was incredibly hard. Dumbledore wore that God awful smile that secretly comforted Draco. Snape, well, he looked down at Draco like he was an old friend.
“Why are you bringing this up?” Draco choked out. “And how did you even see me?”
without your presence.”
In all honesty, it was a stupid, reckless plan that would probably end up not working. They weren’t even sure if everyone else in the Wizarding World was subject to the curse too. But Draco had to try. Plus, his plan wasn’t hurting anybody. He wasn’t going to use up the last question from Snape’s book, he wasn’t going behind Potter’s back to plan a murder, he just wanted to know if others were experiencing the same pain as he was.
Elizabeth took a seat in the only empty chair that was left, right in between Potter and Hannah Abbott. She took a glance around at everyone in the room, and when her eyes met Draco’s he immediately looked down. She already knew he despised being there, and that was okay.
Draco nodded. “Yeah, that.”
but I will.”
Once inside the Room of Requirement, Harry specifically told Draco to wait inside the bathroom. Draco gave plenty of protests and Harry gave plenty of eye rolls. He wouldn’t tell Draco
“Well, I think it is the time.” He moved his head so that their noses were brushing slightly, and Draco swore he could almost see himself reflected perfectly in Harry’s green eyes.
Of course, the universe hated him, and it inevitably was the person he wanted to see least of all. Draco looked down at the hand that was still clutching his wrist, and immediately tensed. He tried tugging away, but Potter’s grip was firm. He wasn’t going anywhere.
unless he wanted to go to Azkaban. The Kaspian’s already knew that fact, too. They were using it to their advantage.
He saw Harry step closer out of the corner of his eye. “Lemme see”
“But why us?” Draco was asking a lot of questions, but he needed a lot of answers. His brain was starting to get insanely cluttered with everything he had to think about.
But when Draco realized who the person was, he suddenly wished he was still the only person around. Harry Potter halted at the bottom of the steps, looking perplexed. He stared at Draco like he couldn't believe his own eyes.
Next chapter will be THE chapter guys! Where everything comes together and the story comes closer to the end.
powerful Witch or Wizard to create such spells, and he’d never even heard of Wizards who could create sunlight, or plants that could grow without water or some type of soil. He never really thought about it before; he paid attention in Herbology but not
“Swear to God, I found it this time.”
In the back of his mind, he knew it had been out of line to just take off the way he had, leaving Harry standing shocked and worried at the back of the library. Maybe a little part of him had thought wherever he went, Harry would surely follow. Well, he was wrong. As he kept running, he turned his head constantly, wanting to see if Harry was chasing after him, but Harry wasn’t.
“Wow, no kidding,” Draco responded with what he hoped was a substantial amount of sarcasm, to try and get some sort of reaction out of Potter. Anything other than the sad, emotionless statue of a man that was standing before him.
Harry didn’t know the latter though, and never would have to find out.
Draco realized he was getting cornered by Harry, pressed against a bookshelf. He would
Somewhere, deep inside himself, he expected Harry to jump up and yell, “Surprise!” and tell Draco that he was wrong, that Draco wouldn’t be the death of Harry Potter.
“So you’re using me to get out of trouble.” Potter crossed his arms over his chest, and steadied his hard, unwavering gaze at Draco. Draco felt intimidated by that stare. He always felt like he was nothing, compared to the great Harry Potter, and that stare ensured the thought.
“It’s not like we have to hold hands or anything-” Draco scoffed at the idea- “But, we can just walk in together, side by side.”
“You’re right about that.” Draco took a chance by staring intently at Harry, until Harry turned and stared back, and Draco exhaled. “But now you’re my friend.” Even though Harry had flat out confirmed it a couple nights ago, he wanted to say it himself, and have Harry agree with him. Just so he knew he hadn’t dreamt the whole conversation in the Garden of Mystics.
“Madame Pomfrey?” He said urgently. There was no response. He tried again, “Madame Pomfrey are you in there?” He wasn’t surprised to receive no answer.
He neared the entrance to the Potions room when he
“You know, I was sure at first that what I wanted was for you to accept my offer, and make things easy for me. But now, I’m glad you didn’t, because now I don’t have a bargain on my side I have to maintain. And you will be my cover for everything. My only regret is giving you two weeks to think about the decision you wanted to make.”
His mind was almost forcing himself to think it had all been a dream, but he was positively certain it hadn’t been. People usually said, “It’s too good to be true,” but in this case, it had been too good to be false.
Harry went on, “I was scared to be alone, you know. Waking up that first day was horrifying. I thought I was completely alone, and then I saw you. I thought I was dreaming, that my mind was playing tricks on me, but it really had been you.
to accept the Pull, and have to watch Harry die while feeling every ounce of pain.
Luckily, Harry’s response was a small shrug. He was definitely wary, about what, Draco could not even begin to guess, but Harry went back to practicing defensive spells, and Draco let out a deep breath.
awkward for Draco, since he’d slipped Theo the “Restorative Potion” in his sleep while not really knowing if it would kill him or not.
Unbelievable.
Once he made his way to the back of the library, standing in front of the large windows, his suspicions about what had been making the noise was confirmed. The same eagle owl that Draco had sent to Azkaban to deliver a letter about a week ago was flying in place right in front of Draco’s face, and he carefully opened up the window to let it in.
Draco wasn’t exactly sure why, but he was severely taken aback, and in his small moment of weakness, Drys cast a spell his way, sending Draco backward, resulting in him falling on the ground.
“Hmm, maybe. I’ve had experiences with- people, invading my mind. Describe to me what it felt like and maybe I can tell you if it really was just a dream, or something else.” Potter rubbed at the scar on his forehead, like he didn’t even realize he was doing it.
Harry moved in front of him, and now Harry was spinning. “Draco. Draco? What’s wrong? You look sick.” Harry’s hands were now gripping his shoulders, and Draco was glad. He didn’t think he could stand on his own. “Can you hear me? Draco. Draco! Please, you’re scaring me.”
“Is this- some type of protective ward? Like the one that’s around Hogwarts?” Draco asked. It was more of a rhetorical question, since he was pretty sure that was exactly what it was, but he felt the need to get Potter’s opinion.
pretty clear that there was a dark wizard out there with some horrible plan, but Draco didn’t understand how that interfered with
The way they were looking at each other was all wrong. Harry was straight, for Merlin’s sake. He couldn’t possibly love Draco when he fancied girls. The thought darkened Draco’s mood, and-
Draco clutched tightly at his wand and made his way to his four poster, not daring to look in the direction of Theo.
“But, Drys, what are you-”
In the back of Draco’s mind, he knew the answer. But a part of him hoped… “Alec taught it to me. Last summer. Along with that spell to play songs on the radio. He taught me other spells too.”
It was Draco’s own power this time.
“Nothing, Potter. Nothing,” He said through gritted teeth.
Draco shut his curtains to his four poster. He had already cast a dozen silencing spells on them at the start of the year, so right as the curtains closed, Theo’s voice cut off.
confessing to someone you were attacked because people despise you, and for good reason. “A group of students attacked me last night.” He continued to look down. He guessed she already knew what had happened, Madame Pomfrey probably told McGonagall what he told her, so why did she have to interrogate him when she already knew the gist? Okay, yeah, she was the Headmistress and wanted to make sure her students were safe and healthy, but he wasn’t worth her time.
Draco dropped his arm reluctantly and hurried over towards the door which he really, really hoped led to a bathroom. He ignored Potter’s comments of concern, and threw the door open, which revealed a generous sized bathroom. At least one thing had gone right that day.
The words that came out of his mouth instead of, “I don’t want to dance,” were much more frightening, and once Draco spoke, he couldn’t take the words back or cover them up with something else. “Harry, are we friends?”
“No, no, no! No visitors at this hour-”
They chewed their food in silence while Harry, oh so typical Harry, kept opening his mouth like he was about to say something, but always ended up closing it last second.
Late at night, he often thought to himself that he could live with having killed Drys: he had made the right decision, even if Harry and Company would have found a way for no one to die at all. And he felt guilty for feeling guilty about having rid the world of all the Death Eaters--a fact that everyone now knew thanks to the
The stone chunk flew in between the both of them, continuing its murderous flight across the corridor, until it finally hit a wall and broke into pieces.
He realized that he had just cut Harry.
“Just leave me alone, and don’t talk to me again.”
He was obviously snapping for
Draco hadn’t even given a second thought about the therapy groups. He’d completely forgotten they existed. The offer McGonagall had given him was a great one, honestly. No more withering glares from his classmates anymore. And, possibly, just
hadn’t told Harry that the reason he’d been so intent and keen on making the Restorative Potion perfect was to save himself. Sure, he guessed he did want to save the school, whatever, but he never clarified that he’d thought that if they could wake up McGonagall, she could possibly help out with his own problems in some way.
“What brings you in here on this fine morning?” Snape asked as he crossed his arms in front of him.
The air was even more hot as they stepped outside, undeterred by the setting sun, and Draco was painfully aware of his horrid summer attire; trousers and a long sleeved shirt, while Harry on the other hand was making complete use of the summer weather. Draco could never be like Harry, not with the Mark on his arm; it was a thought that still weighed him down.
“I’m sorry, that was really dumb,” Potter said as he continued to try, and fail, to conceal his tears.
“You were all at the edge of the Forbidden Forest,” McGonagall said, “you had just started dueling with this man… everything was extremely hard to see and hear…”
Then, Draco had asked Harry if they should test out the potion on someone first, to make sure it wasn’t poisonous and wouldn’t kill every person who came in contact with it, and Harry had agreed it was a good idea, save for the one problem of who would be their unwilling test subject. Which brought Draco to offering up the name: “Theodore Nott.”
“Fine. But
But what Harry said, what came out of his mouth, untangled any leftover doubts inside of Draco, and set them free for good.
some hope that they weren’t back at square one.
“Don’t touch me!” Draco finally snapped. “Get your hand off of me!” He was fuming now. He noticed his hands were starting to shake, and his breath was coming up short.
“Gladly,” Harry said, standing up swiftly, holding his forehead and squinting slightly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Through his shame, Draco felt something else surge through him; panic. He didn’t know of any spells to repair clothing. He would have to walk through the halls of Hogwarts, with his Mark out for everyone to see. This was probably what they wanted to happen to Draco. They knew causing Draco pain in the form of curses wasn’t enough, they had to tap into Draco’s self loathing to make him really suffer. Even if he clutched his arm tightly to chest, people would know. They would think things, and they would cast him vicious glares. Everyone, save for a couple First Years, knew what he was.
He truly was a terrible person.
His only thought at the moment had been,
Right before he left the room, Draco glanced back towards McGonagall’s desk and saw Dumbledore and Snape watching him leave. Snape gave one nod towards Draco, to which Draco smiled at. Dumbledore gave a small wave, his eyes gleaming behind his half moon spectacles. Draco waved back.
to tell someone, now that he was alone.
“Lovely,” Draco mumbled.
Draco finished undressing and hopped in the shower, turning the water on to the hottest temperature.
Fuck Potter. Draco didn’t need his help to save Hogwarts. He would do it on his own. He was the one who had the strange dream, the one with the angry Mark, he would save everyone on his own. He would prove to Saint Potter he was more than some ‘prejudiced Death Eater.’
“What do you think happened? Like do you think it’s some kind of curse or maybe just some First Year’s spell gone wrong?” Draco asked Potter innocently.
“So,” Harry started, sitting down in a chair in front of the fire. Draco sat on his once designated bed.
Draco opened his eyes. He was still in the Hospital Wing, in one of the hospital beds, and it was now morning. He pressed the heels of his hands against his eyelids, feeling exhausted. His dream from last night had been extremely odd, and not like any other dream he’d had before. He remembered pretty much every aspect of it in vivid detail. He usually suffered from nightmares about the war, so it was weird to actually have a normal dream for a change. Not that dreams in general were anywhere near normal, but normal to have a strange, made up dream for once like everyone else had.
“Mr. Malfoy, you’re awake,” Madame Pomfrey stated as she rushed over to him from the other side of the room with her wand in one hand and a potion bottle in the other. “Here, drink this.”
“Why did
How was he supposed to find courage, to find faith in himself, when no one else had faith in him?
Draco sighed. He knew he didn’t have to tell Harry anything if he didn’t want to, they sorted that out; allowing the other their personal space and privacy, and not trying to pry. But, Draco found he did want to consult Harry.
“I hope in a good way,” Harry teased, his eyes still glistening.
Draco knew he wouldn’t get out of not speaking to Potter. Well, Draco didn’t have to speak, but he had to listen.
“That’s all great and everything,” Draco said, “but
to him?
Harry moved his body closer to Draco, looking intently at Draco’s careful pouring. “That sounds good.”
Potter tucked Snape’s book into his coat pocket- since it was small enough to fit- and Potter’s coat pockets were oddly ginormous.
curse Potter had cast at him during Sixth Year. The effects of that curse, clearly visible on his face.
“Are you sure we’re even looking in the right subject? Like how are we supposed to know if this
The door to the classroom slammed open. To Draco’s amazement, it wasn’t Potter who was going to save him, but Hermione Granger.
“I know. But you know that’s different. It was… it was the fucking Dark lord!”
All of the details of the battle, though, weren’t bringing themselves to the surface. Clearly, if there were Aurors around, specifically one that had been clearly watching Draco, it meant Draco had done something illegal.
“I’m sorry, Harry. But this potion is far too dangerous to have more than a group of two people working on it.”
“That’s what I was thinking…”
Draco shrugged. “I’ve come to terms with the title, but I think it’s going to take a bit to not feel like a complete fraud.”
“Do you need any help?”
He scooted closer to Harry, and they were laying side by side, Draco’s arm touching Harry’s. Draco was leaning slightly to look at Harry’s face, propped up on one arm. He then moved his hand slightly, letting it linger over Harry’s forehead, and then brushed back a few strands of hair. He could see his famous lightning bolt scar when his hair was pushed back, and he wanted to touch it, oddly enough.
Neither Drys nor Alec spoke; just stood there with their mouths wide open.
He didn’t act on that instinct. Harry continued on, “After that, everything was fuzzy, like more than normal fuzzy. I just remember looking past your shoulder to look at Drys, who was lying on the ground, every part of his body mirroring yours; no movement whatsoever. I couldn’t see the Death Eaters in the woods anymore. And then I looked for Alec, who wasn’t there, either. It was just rain, woods, and your weight resting against my chest.
The thought of the Curse brought him to think about some questions that were still left unanswered. How did he survive the Killing Curse? How did he break out of Drys’ thrall, avoid the Pull and create his own set of visions?
Harry’s footsteps were as close as ever now, so Draco stuffed the response in his pocket too.
“Well then, I’ll talk to her as soon as possible,” the Headmistress said. “I will send my owl with more information regarding sessions at a later time. Hopefully in the next couple days.”
Draco, at the moment, was most certainly not obeying his father’s wishes.
Draco reluctantly dropped his hands so that his face was visible once more, and fiddled with them in his lap. “What?”
His fingers raked over the material covering his left forearm. Before he knew it, he was scratching the damned Dark Mark, even though his sleeve was still covering the actual skin. He scratched until he felt the movement was a part of him, like the scratching movement was a second nature to him. And maybe, maybe if he kept on scratching and never stopped, the clothing material would fade away, and then soon after, the Mark would too.
were technically adults.
So they set off, peering through windows of shops that were locked, which was all of them. Draco guessed the ‘sleeping curse’ struck when everyone was sleeping during the night. It would make the most sense. They had found Hogwarts students in their beds, with the exception of a few Slytherins who had stayed up to study. That meant the owners of all the shops were probably in their own beds.
Harry had an evil grin on his face, and Draco knew he had the same smile plastered on his own face.
“Harry,” Draco breathed, looking around the room so as not to make eye contact. “Not now.”
“Silencing charms, you know, around your bed. So then know one can hear you when you have nightmares and make noise.”
make another sappy speech, but Draco couldn’t take back his words now.
It had been extremely difficult to make, especially with only about three months to do it all. At times they’d wanted to use Snape’s magical book for help, holding every known fact in the Wizarding World, but decided against it. Snape’s real book had been returned to him after the whole ordeal, and Draco and Harry decided no one should be using that kind of book, no one should hold that much power in their hands.
“Malfoy? What’s-”
“It’s really no problem. I didn’t even do any work, really. The Room of Requirement provided me with everything,” Harry said.
been a lot harder than intended.
The chain with the gem attached now felt like a weight hanging around his neck. The Anemonlea flower was lying smashed and forgotten near the area where Draco had slept. The photo of them both in Draco’s pocket was now a dead memory, something that could never be revived.
“Well you were the one coming up behind me. You should have been paying attention.”
Potter blushed, and Draco had to look away from his face to keep himself from blushing too.
the Figure in the hooded cloak.
Harry had gotten bored of staring at the Map, which surprised Draco, since he guessed Harry had loads of practice staring at the piece of parchment during his years at Hogwarts. So, he started practicing defensive spells once again.
“You’ve apologized to me before,” Harry said.
Maybe Harry did like him. Maybe Harry loved him. He didn’t want to get his hopes up, but everything Harry had done for Draco ever since he had ran away from the library, showed that Harry truly cared about him.
The room was incredibly hot, and apparently Harry thought so too, because he reluctantly separated from Draco to pull his robes off. Draco quickly pushed Harry’s hands down so that he had the pleasure of undressing his top half. He tried not to pop a button from his Gryffindor robes, but he thought he accidentally did, and hoped Harry wouldn’t mind later. Once his robes were off, Draco lifted up Harry’s shirt and ran his hands up and down Harry’s muscular torso, relishing on how his skin felt under Draco’s hands, and just how fucking
Draco obviously knew he was in love with Harry, and he hadn’t exactly been sure when he had started to fall in love with him, but maybe they’d been connected somehow, ever since the beginning, to find each other, to befriend each other, and find their true selves in another.
With one last look at Pansy, he made his way to his own dorm. When he stepped inside, he could see that Theo, Blaise, Robins, and Davis were all in their own beds, sleeping. Not that he was really surprised.
Okay. Maybe Draco had been a little too quick to judge Potter’s skills after all. He was still absolute shit at Potions, but he could read, which was all the skill that Draco really required in a partner. They didn’t talk at all after their little conversation regarding Kaspian, and Draco was fine with that. He really didn’t like to talk to people other than Pansy, though Potter seemed to bring out a weird side of him. It was like he wanted to start up a conversation with Potter, but he was almost too scared to.
Harry came down right behind him, his feet hitting Draco’s back painfully. He guessed it had been his fault, since he hadn’t moved out of the way when he’d gotten a chance, but he couldn’t bring himself to care about his now aching spine, since he’d just witnessed an experience so wonderfully fun, it would have brought the Malfoy name to shame- even more shame- had anyone seen him sliding down a slide, laughing like a child, with Harry Potter.
thing would be kept under wraps. But no. He knew that a lot of people already strongly suspected, since he’d been highly favored by the Carrows and other Death Eaters during Seventh Year, but then it had really officially been out there for
“Enough of this!” Drys shouted, sending a stream of curses after Draco, promptly hitting his shield and making him fall over again.
Walking deeper into the common room, Draco held his wand tighter and tried his hardest not to stare directly into anyone’s eyes. He knew, based on what Pansy had told him, that the whole school knew he and Harry had been involved someway with the Sleeping Curse. He had to wonder what exact rumors were spread, though. And how
“Thank you for telling me,” his mother whispered. “I love you.”
Harry! Where did you
1) The Dark Lord, (most obviously).
Harry mumbled, “Of course you do.”
“Hell yeah we should,” Potter exclaimed as he bent down to open the hatch. Reckless Gryffindor.
The statue miraculously moved and revealed a spiral staircase. Draco looked skeptically between Potter and the newly-revealed entranceway. “Crumpets? How did you-”
