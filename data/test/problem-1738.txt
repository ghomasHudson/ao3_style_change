- since fate wasn't on his side, he saw Potter not three days after their last meeting, right when he was about to open his classroom.
"You don't understand." The Prince's hold on the horse shifts. "He uses dark magic. A mark of his and the mob would follow his orders as a religion."
"Consider it as a honey moon for us." Harry smiled down at him.  "After every thing is settled, both in Gryffindor and Slytherin, and we find your father and peers well and satisfied, I will be taking you away from this country for a few weeks."
"Someone special." The green-eyed man just grinned as he rocked back and forth on the balls of his feet. His glanced at the pot of a fly-trap-philodendron and remembered his own experience with it, shuddering at the memory.
"W-na kih!" Draco groaned around the finger. Potter looked at him while saying 'what' and removed his fingers from his mouth. "Wanna kiss!" He repeated, and then turned his head at an impossible angle (which he knew would get him a stiff neck later on- but right now he didn't care a bit), pulled Potter's head down by his hair and smashed his lips onto his, gnawing and biting at the plumpy lips and running his tongue on his teeth, which tasted like a nice combination of tobacco, apple soda and mint. Potter sucked at his lower lip too, when he pulled back his lips were swollen with the amount of teeth Potter used. He laid his head on the broad shoulder.
"That is all, right? Thanks, Potter." He said quickly before slamming the door on his face, again. Harry sighed as he put is head on the door gently.
It wasn't as if Harry didn't like his job. He'd exiled himself from the wizarding world and only went there every six months to meet Ron and Hermione. When he was asked to stay a few days more, he'd smile and say that he had job to do. They didn't know what he did, and he didn't want them to know. It wasn't a reputed work but it was important for other people. And it paid enough along with his frequent bartending at the seven star hotels and fancy bars and clubs. He was able to own a small flat and a bike. He still owned the bike Sirius had left him, but that held too many memories and it would be too fancy to show off to muggles. Memories were one of the reasons he had left the wizarding world. Too much had happened, too fast. Too many had died and he couldn't cope with it. He was left too much money from people he hadn't even met as a form of inheritance and he didn't know what to do with them. He'd spend it on clothes, simple yet high branded clothes. The ministry had become biased towards the people who had supported Voldemort and that was another thing he couldn't handle. He had fought against prejudice, yet now here they were, prejudicing again. Hermione had tried explaining to him, that people needed someone to target always and now it was the purebloods' turn. Ron had paled at that and ran out of the room in anger, but Hermione was with her say. All the deatheaters were sent to Azkban, and those who didn't- their wands were snapped. All of them had ran away to other countries, finding their wizarding roots over there. Lucius Malfoy was sent to Azkban, Narcissa Malfoy was escorted to her French villa in Nice- she was practically a vegetable now, her mind had blown with extreme trauma ; and Draco Malfoy's wand was snapped and he was ordered to live in Muggle world. That was a punishment enough for him, he had cried and wailed in front of the judges and  pleaded them to be with his mother and he'd be happy to live like a squib in the wizarding world. But they didn't want to make him happy. They wanted him punished, they wanted him to suffer. And how better for him to suffer but amongst muggles. Harry had been there during his trial, sitting on the second row, and he had seen him crying and wailing.
"Of course. I shall lead you to our chambers, My Dove." Draco shuddered when the man said 'our chambers', it would definitely mean that he would have to sleep on the same bed where the evil monster had once slept, or in more terrible case - even share the mattress with him.
"One month, one week and three days." He pouted forward for a peck, but Theo just rolled his eyes and leaned back to remove his tie. "It took you so long. How was the deal?"
I sighed before replying. "He's cheating." Her eyes widened. "It's been more than three months now."
of it was Potter. Someone had casted a sonorous around him and told them all to quieten down. The floor below Potter's feet elevated a bit and Draco could now make out his clear visage above everyone's mass of hair and a few balds.
Harry almost chuckled but then controls himself to make a straight face. "and how do plan on wedding me without not letting your Father know. Don't you require his permission of any sort?"
Harry looked at him with a thoughtful gaze before he took out his pistol, aiming it directly at the pale face which was now turning even paler looking at it and grey eyes blinked rapidly. "Or I could just shoot your fucking face off." He said in a calm voice. What he didn't know that his calmness would falter when Draco looked directly at his green eyes and then at the pistol and took out his pink tongue and dragged it against the underside of the silver pipe before taking the other end in his mouth and sucking on the hollow opening. Harry looked at him with a raised brow and then chuckling. "God! Aren't you a proper slut? Even while on the dead end, your only option is to suck." Harry jerked his gun sharply, clinking against the teeth and even hitting the inside of his cheek. "Is it not?!" Draco groaned in response as if saying 'yes.'
Harry gave him a small grin. "Sappy I may be, but I'm not fickle, however reckless I might be." He pulled at the sheets covering Draco's pale pink feet upto his knees and knelt on to the floor beside the bed. Draco hurried to sit upright but Harry had kissed his toes, his sole and his heel of the feet. "I ask you, My Queen, for your forgiveness. Please be kind enough to have pity on this shameless man." Draco tried to pull his feet away from his mouth but Harry had grabbed onto his ankles and it hit him with a strong déjà vu. "Draco. Please." He gave a long lick from the middle of toes to the middle of the back of the feet.
– he wanted to say, oh he wanted to scream and beg and cry out so loud. But he couldn’t. He felt his closed eyes water and he blinked them open, squinting when he saw the white light again. He twisted his head to look at his side, all he saw was dirty floor that competed with Azkaban’s.
"What is his name?" Harry repeated this time with a growl. The snake looked at him, and shook his head. "Tell us, or you will die!"
"Yes. And now-" Draco held at the stick and snapped it in two. Nothing happened for a while, it almost seemed to be simple and foolish to do so. He thought he might considered something else as the wrong object. "Why's nothing -" there was a huge boom then, a rush of air forced against them and he was glad that Harry held him tight or he would have fallen down on his torso or his arse. It continued for a while, loud noises emerging from every corner as if windows were shut and large gates were opened, there was loud cries of babies, women and men: then it stopped, and everything turned still and quiet again. The soldiers around them had fallen down with their eyes closed and their heads limp.
"I'm not going to use it, you spawn of Devil." Draco sighed when Harry had wound his hand in his. "I had wanted to say that you're nothing but a wisp of darkness over this world and it would be so much greater without you in it."
"Is it done now?" Draco came close, standing beside Harry to look at the machine. Harry inhaled deeply, smelling apples and citrus with a strong hint of vanilla. It smelled expensive. His skin was damp and his hair was wet, few droplets rolling down to his back and chest.
"Okay, sure I believe you in that." Draco knew that he didn't. "and you believe that she is sane enough to wed us." He nods his head. "and you want us to ride to Ravenclaw for this?"
“Oh but I already did, he loved it when I played with his cock. Didn’t you, my Darling?” George said with mirth. George.
Harry wanted to expose the shit eating grin on his face but he managed to let out a frown. "Why? What happened?"
"It's fine Malfoy. It really is." When he seemed to calm down slowly, Harry continued. "Nothing a quick episky can't solve, right?" He wiggled his brows, but Malfoy barely changed his stoic expression. He sighed internally, it was pretty hard now to get Malfoy to speak more than required in anyway.
Harry didn't sleep that night. He was standing by the balcony looking at the half moon and the stars around it. He knew Draco looked at him from the bed, he could hear the soft rustles. But even enough breathing didn't calm him down. His father was on possible deathbed, he was now the king of Gryffindor, and a tyrant was succeeding towards his goal. He didn't tell Draco, but more than half of Ravenclaw and almost all of Slytherin was under this so called Dark Lord. He could see stressing building up day by day in Draco's grey eyes. He knew both of them didn't love each other till now, but he cared extremely for the blonde. Draco had been preparing himself for the child he'd carry, he ate healthier food, even those fruits he hated and took walks in the morning, saying that the morning sun was good for blood flow and bone strength. He wore airy fabrics and toiled hard in the makeshift lab. Harry promised himself, after this situation was over he'd make a proper potions lab for Draco. He was lost in his thoughts when he felt leans arms around his waist from back. "you're not sleeping, My .... Harry." Harry knew he was almost going to say 'King', but he was thankful he didn't.
"Let's break these too." She smirked. We heard a toll of the church bell outside. After the nine tolls, we got into the process. It was quite a therapy, release anger  issues or something.  It was probably half an hour later when the door clicked open, there was a another click as well which did not all sound like that of a lock. A man walked in holding a gun.
"The next will be your fangs, you worm!" She said with a glare. The horse she was sitting on, stepped on its middle and the snake shrieked again in agony.
"Draco-" I was cut off, I felt like everyone just loved cutting whenever I was going in deep into something.
"I won't let it happen! I won't let it-" he ran forward, his hands raised in a tight fist. Harry was ready with his sword.
Draco shook his head. "It's fine. I asked my one of my friends to stay with me. He's Muggle, but I think he's aware about magic. He hides it."
"We'll use potions. Now let me in." Draco replied in negative, he used all the strength in his back onto the door, he could feel his success close when he suddenly heard a yelp against the door.
An hour later he was dressed properly in black robes which were accented in dark blue fabrics at the sides. It itched him badly, specially on his back and shoulders, but he didn't say anything. The first time he had complained about it, Ron had casted a 'smoothening charm' over his robes- the itching didn't cease but for the next week he had huge blisters all over his torso. He cleared his throat and went through the write up that Hermione had did for him and memorised certain important parts.
"Oh you do, don't you?" Draco whimpered on top of him, when he brushed against the prostate once and then going back to scissoring again.
"All I smell now is a rotten eggs and swamp!" Greyback whined behind him and Draco hid his smirk. "I don't ever think this would go away."
It was morning when I woke up. The light was pouring lightly from the windows, it had to be barely five. Harry had his arm around me as he slept with mouth open. There were deep bags under his eyes and I knew he slept quite late. I pushed his hand away carefully before kicking him off the bed. This was second time of Me doing it, and I enjoyed it every time. I think it's going to become a habit  seeing him all shocked and scared, reaching for the wand which we all know is carefully placed in his armoire, adjust his glasses, become confused and then look at me with a look of 'why' and a small pout.
“No, it wasn’t that.” He finally got his voice back and Potter didn’t seem satisfied. “I just thought-“
"Salazar! Salazar, do something!" Draco cried out to the snake, but it didn't do anything.  Harry hissed again and the snake then went onto the thin wrists, wrapping its body around the grip. Harry loosened his hold.
"Fine. I'll see you then." He gave a nod before walking out of the room. Hermione looked at Draco with concern.
"I'm just aiding you to be in consciousness." Harry said, his hands caressing the angular jaw. "I had thought that you-" he couldn't say more about the way he imagined Draco on someone else's bed, Draco had silenced him with a kiss.
hearing. Draco felt his heart flutter, and after looking at the deep green eyes he couldn’t meet them again- not even when he met Potter after his hearing to say a word of thanks by repeating
"I didn't do it with anyone but you." He turned his head to look into blazing green eyes. "I only fucked you. No one else from underworld."
Because I wanted to meet you. I wanted to see your face. Screwed up like what it was during your trial. I want to see it again and again. Harry wanted to say that. "I told you. I wanted the break from all that complicated stuff. I was tired of fame, of name, photographs taken, being put on a pedestal. Being here, life's easy."
Harry came back to the flat that same night. Malfoy had opened the door with a frown and a still heated cheeks, but this time his eyes were a bit hazy. He looked tipsy. "Potter?" He drawled out in the same manner he used to pronounce in school. "What are you doing here?"
"It is but the same thing." He tutted. "Steal, borrow, conquer- or whatever, they imply that it will be mine." An evil toothed grin was on his face and Harry wanted nothing but to punch him straight in his jaw. He was about to say something when he heard the doors behind him open.
Draco walked towards him in a steady stride. "Your eyes say something else, Prince Harry." He smirks slightly before holding out both of his hands. "Do you want to tie my wrists too, and drag me along?" Gasps from everyone could be heard as only criminals and molesters were done so with, which made Harry flush and Draco smirk more.
His pace increased then, not too much, just a fraction- there was a lot of friction and he went deeper and deeper with every move. I was clinging to his shoulders, matching his every downward thrust with my own upper. His pace faltered and he went faster. Only Harry could do that, go faster and slower in the same thrust.
Harry was specifically put into a different cell than others. The walls were thick and of stone, even if he tried screaming at the top of his voice, but there was no reply from anyone. He then had to lay back and count the seconds by. He had gone upto eleven thousand, four hindered and fifty six, then he had given up, closing his eyes and sighing loudly. It must have been an hour or so which might have passed since when he heard very soft footsteps and the clink of the knob of the iron door. He had to blink back when sudden candlelight entered the cell. He grabbed onto the dagger in his boot and pounced on the figure. He didn't expect to be pounced back instead, which lean arms and legs wrapping around his neck and torso respectively. His name was called in a soft sigh in his ear and he sniffed at the neck of the person. "Draco." He whispered grabbing onto the hips, the candle laid forgotten in a lateral position on the dirty floor. Draco called out his name again and placed haste kisses on his neck, jaw, cheeks and finally on his lips. It was as if Draco couldn't have enough of him as his hair was being tugged at and his lips pulled in little nips.
The blonde instead smiled down at him, with mirth though. He reached behind him and pointed a small black gun at him "Harold Padfoot, this the state police, you're under arrest!" He said in a raspy voice which was strained. Harry looked behind the blonde sitting on his length and found his own pistol lying carelessly on the floor near the chair he had previously occupied.  He felt a hard slap on his cheek making him glare back into the grey eyes.
Harry had the audacity to laugh. "If I had stopped you would have cursed me to oblivion." Draco rolled his eyes. He didn't say anything and just listened to badumps under his ear and relishing when Harry had taken to slide his fingers in his hair.
"Everything is fine. I'm just asking Miss Matilda here, who is the father of her unborn child?" She was fuming and Harry chocked on his saliva. He called my name again but I chose to ignore him. I waited for one whole minute (believe me I counted till sixty) and then my smile turned to sneer. "Tell me!"
"The attorney forms ready? Yes. The documents are good to go, they just need your seal." He held out the forms to him and Harry signed through without giving any second thought or look. "I have to ask something of you."
"No! No! Professor, don't please." He cried out. Those red eyes didn't look intimidating any more, they looked foolish and scared instead.
"I could tell them." He lifted his head up. Even though he was a few inches shorter than the other man, he could manage to  look down at him through his nose.
Draco could only gape at him, and his face was red with fury. "how dare you!" He strode forward and pushed at the strong chest with his right palm. "I haven't done any of that. Nor have I indulged in any form of lip to lip contact with anyone! And who are you to allow me from doing anything?" He pushed at the chest with both of his palms, Harry only budged a little but other than that stood straight. "First you stop me from speaking-"
But the Professor shouted then, pulling out his own long but thick, twisted wand and pointed it at the running man. "Voldemort! I curse you to Avada Kedavera!" Then there was an explosion, all black and green. The people surrounding him fell back. Harry supported Draco's fall with his arm. It was smoke and fogged all around them, heavy air going into their lungs and soon they were coughing. There was a pinning sound in the air. Draco had too see that the Professor was well, he was an old man per say, but to his surprise Professor was standing even in the smoke and noise his face stiff and stern.
They all washed up at their chambers; Harry decided that it would be a perfect time to introduce Draco to their new shared rooms, which was Harry's own. When he was done, Harry nodded his head at him, as if silently telling  him at was the time and lead him to the throne room. Pansy and Blaise stood at the sides of the throne, while Hermione and Ron stood with the Princes.
"I don't know." Harry sighed as he placed himself on the bed again. He wrapped a hand around the pale ankle and squeezed at it gently. "I wouldn't mind staying the King. And I think my father would be proud if ever, I've been holding on quite well."
"Exactly." She picked up another glass. "fucking asshole broke my vase." I gave her a smile. "what about you?"
Draco looked at green eyes with as much ferocity he could muster. Harry gave him a small smile before bending his head down. "I apologize for last night. I shouldn't had done that. I felt such at the time too, but ego had resided my mind. I hope you can forgive me."
"It's Harry. C'mon say 'Harry, fuck me hard." Draco didn't reply, only thrusting backward. Potter pinched at his waist, going slow for a moment. "Draco." He said sternly. "Say it!"
"Yes, absolutely! Do you live nearby? You could make me a cup? That would be great, wouldn't it?" Draco didn't know what to say. On one hand Draco didn't want Potter to see where he lived, but then on the other- Potter was the Head Auror, and he could easily doubt Draco of any reason if he didn't let him in. And moreover, he could even investigate him, even if it was unnecessary, because Draco didn't have anything to hide about. He made a quick decision in his mind and nodded his head.
Harry squat infront of him, trying to look at the expression he was making. "I agree." Draco raises his head to meet his eyes. "but what about your Father?"
"I don't care." I muttered, my eyes rolled back when I slipped two of my fingers in me. He was right it burnt, but damn did it feel good too. I slathered the remaining wetness around his length and pushed it inside of me. "Oh yes, Harry!"
"Aunt Luna says nargles take them somewhere from the house. Mom says 'its nothing like that Rose. They fall off naturally for everyone.' " Her mimicking of Hermione made me chuckle loudly. She squirmed and I put her down so that she could run away. Draco wasn't with Luna then. I looked around and saw him at the open food stand with, no one other than, Victor.
"Mr Flemming's son, Victor." I looked at him blankly before I shut my eyes. Four weeks prior he had mentioned he was going to meet a patient's son for better understanding of a ridiculous case. The main thing is, he told me the thing while we were making out and holding each other's length in Molly's bathroom. Who says such a thing at such a time?
Harry's eyes widened and Hermione gaped too. Ron said. "but- it hasn't even a month since you met Harry." Draco rolled his eyes before picking up a glass of water and sipping on it.
And Harry felt like he was totally fucked when he saw the red and blue sirens and wailing "tee-too" of the cars, that he desperately wanted to shoot the cars' tires to puncture. He was meeting for a deal regarding drug import and distribution. The gangs
"Nothing I  swear." He raised two of his arms in a mock surrender and shook his head. "I just want to know you better. Remember I told that I want to be your friend." Silver eyes rolled and thin shoulders shrugged. "I'm really not inspecting you or anything."
He scrunched his lips. "I thought you'd like it." He folded his arms on his chest. The shirt was unbuttoned on the first few eyelets, and although I couldn't see that scar of long time back, there was enough of pale skin visible to  soothe my eyes.
"Yeah." He smiled. "my friend is coming. He'll probably arrive any minute now." Harry smiled and let himself out. He stood by the entrance of the building for a hour and saw a tall brunette enter. He walked a few steps towards the nearby tree and saw the man enter Draco's flat. He whispered under his breath, wandless magic tingling through his fingers and his green eyes shone with 'imperius'.
James chuckled looking at the younger man fussing around. "And you're not wearing anything. Did I make you anxious that you had to rush here without any clothes on. Should have considered the decorum you have to maintain now that you're the Queen."
See, that made me angry. I scratched at his wrist and with some fevor removed my pants. I lined his prick at my entrance but it wouldn't just go in. "Draco! Draco!" I looked at him, his green eyes how blown to black. "let's slow down." I whined loudly in reply. "Draco, we need lube." He panted out and I halted for a second. He was right : he needed lube, I was about to caste the spell, then I saw the bottle of firewhiskey on the table. I picked it up, uncorking it with my mouth. I poured a lot of unnecessary amount on my open palm. "Draco! Stop! It's going to burn."
I turned around to face him. "Chapstick, Harry. My lips should look wet, like I just swallowed, won't that look nice?" His eyes twitched. He was controlling himself from narrowing his eyes. And he knew perfectly what I was implying.
He smiled at her and dropped to both of knees, for a moment I thought he'd ask permission to give her a cunnilingus. But then he reached his pocket and took out a ring. It was big and had three  large diamonds. It just screamed Pansy. "Would you do me the honour of being my-" my gasp and Pansy's squeal interrupted him. Pansy jumped on him and snatched the ring from his hand and slid into hers.
That's right- Victor was the one who did it. He didn't just stop there, he kicked on his gut and then a loud "get out you fucking bastard!" was heard out of his mouth over the now-turned-low volume of the music. Then he came back and consolidated Draco, who just nodded his head mutely. I couldn't stand anything anymore. I rushed past the back door of the pub and apparated back to our house. I was heaving and my magic was out of control. A bulb burst into shards and the candles lit and unlit repeatedly. I decided to take a long bath, a warm one, to soothe myself.
He was just about to leave with his hand around Rose's in  a blind grip when he paused and took the Gryffindor's brave leap. "Are you free this Saturday?"
Potter sighed. "It seems like that doesn't it. A Head Auror approaching you, and on top of that our history and all." There was a scratching sound, which meant that Potter was probably nervous as well. "But I am genuinely interested in you."
"Don't be crass." Draco moved back and jumped onto the cool marble platform. "I dreamt that I am in a huge mansion, red carpets below my feet and chiffon curtains hid the morning sunshine which threatened to peek from the floor length windows."
"Oui Draco. Merci." I spoke the only two words I knew well enough to pronounce and understand in a quick exchange. I stood up, carried him to the bedroom and dropped him carefully on the bed. I had gone to get a hangover potion for him but when I came back he had already slept soundly. I sighed before slipping in the covers too.
Harry on the other hand was facing his own dilemma. Ron had gone with a troop into the Ravenclaw forests, it had been three days since he had left. Harry would spend a lot of time in the court, going through the usual plans and proceedings of the battle he knew was coming in less than a week. He didn't want to fight, if he could he wanted no bloodshed whatsoever. But since he had heard how Ravenclaw King was being pushed into the dungeons and his place was taken by a 'wizard', he knew he had very less time to prepare. Only half of the spies he had sent to the nearby kingdom came back, with information that the rest were either killed or had their mind taken control of. The Dark Lord, as they called him and didn't know his actual name, was ruthless and merciless. The Wizard saw to women and young boys be raped infront of him and thrown to as food later on to a giant snake. The wolf roamed freely in the forests, acting as a leader to his own pack of wild beings.  Harry was scared for Ron and his friends, and he decided not to tell Draco, not in the condition he was in now where he barely ate anything except a few nibbles. He knew the man wasn't able to hold himself upright for more than an hour and Harry wanted nothing but to be with him. But since he was being avoided like a plague by the same man and the sudden pressure of maintaining a whole wide kingdom, Harry could do nothing but to watch from far. The time he had as rest was spent in library with Hermione.
Kingsley had sent his patronus: it was five in the morning and I had my limbs around my husband, when a blue eagle flew in and screeched in Kingsley's voice to get my arse to the office as there was a break in Xello-Ring Case. We had never got any clues to further in the Xello-Ring Case. The last clue was found around a couple of months ago. It involved muggles and police (as well as Muggle army), it was hard anyway to interfere. Xellophilus, an aphrodisiac and halucigen, wasn't just a drug- it was a deadly drug. A couple of uses of this potion and person would be on deathbed. And the fact that this was distributed to the muggles made it much worse. Having properties of magical capabilities, with ingredients which muggles still hadn't discovered, we were at a high risk of getting found out.
"I'm just stating the truth. Draco is working on Victor's father, it's a magical disease along with trauma, he needs to talk to Victor about it regularly. Didn't he tell you that?"
His face was brought up and he opened his lips to kiss at the presented mouth, feverishly. Harry chuckled pushing him back. "do your customers want a whore to fuck like a lover. Or... Is it just me you're giving this special service?" Draco looked down instead of replying, his cheeks turning red. "don't reply to that." He pushed down his shirt and trousers along with his pants in a swift motion, then laid himself on the blonde lithe man. He spread the pale thighs apart and putting them around his waist. He leaned down to kiss the pink lips, but this time taking the control rather than Draco. He bit at his lower lip a bit too hard, drawing blood out and lapping at the cut. When he leaned back he could see grey eyes drunk in lust, hair fallen on the bed and it looked like a halo on the grey sheets, and pink lips tinted red with blood.
"I did promise to be with you." Harry says sternly. "it's a wonder that you're questioning my word."
Draco didn't realize that he was whimpering and gasping loudly but he did know that he could only hold onto the hair he was gripping as if his life depended on it. He whined when those fingers slid out of him, his hips thrusted into the air and strong hands paused his motions with a tight hold. "Draco..." He opened his eyes to meet green orbs. "I'll put it in. It's going to- well, hurt a bit, but it's going to be fine, so just tru-"
"Yes!" Then he cut the call. I blinked a few times. I was actually quite impressed. If I still wasn't in love with Harry, I would have seriously considered dating Charmond. I removed my healer robes and smoothed my hair down and ran out of the building, not before signing my leave and even taking the cake box. No one leaves cake behind. I slowed my pace when I neared the gates and I looked around. I searched for him, for his dark maroon hair, but I couldn't find him. I almost gave up, when I felt someone lift me from back and gave a small twirl, making me yelp. I was put down and was given a loud kiss smack on my cheek.
Harry let her wrists be held down on either side of her head, even though she knew that it wouldn't take her a minute to over power the blonde, but she couldn't help but stare and gawk and roll her eyes when Draco shifted her hips back and then forward, riding Harry's so-called-cock in much fevor. "Oh Harry!"
"No it's not alright!" Merlin forbid if he'd let me speak. "How long does it take for you to scribble 'have a case' or 'Kingsley called' or 'Ron needs help'. I don't put a notepad and a pen, not a quill but a sodding Muggle pen, on our nightstand for a decor item." I winced at that and I know he saw it because he continued. "I don't mind you going off for field cases, even on a Sunday, or taking too much overtime or sometimes coming home at wee hours. I don't say anything!"
"But you did, didn't you?" Harry held his arm tight around the lean waist. "He was holding you like you belonged to him."
"I could drop Rose and come back? You look pretty tired and seem like in need of one. Till then, they could be gone." He motioned at a balding men who sat in the corner who was drawing a few circles on a sheet of paper. Malfoy glanced at the man and looked unsure. Harry was sure he would say no, so before he could he continued. "Great! Then I'll be back in fifteen minutes then?" He didn't let Malfoy speak and ushered Rose out of the shop
"Oh no, Potter. Yesterday it was bacon pastry. That's savoury." Malfoy smirked at him, coming forward to place both the cups of coffee infront of him. "one is with chocolate, be wise with what you choose to drink first." He turned around and walked to the metal drawers arranging the papers in them albeit magically.
"There was a lot of it. Like someone wanked off on my door. It was disgusting. I had a friend clean it up for me. I swear if I could just scourgify-" he stopped himself.
Draco visibly gulped hard. His eyes dropped to the off-white shirt the other man wore. "I didn't always fuck them, if that's what you're asking."
"You heard right." Draco replied in a small voice. He risked his hand forward to brush the dark hair away from the scar he'd always seen the school, but Harry caught the slim wrist before it could touch his face. He pushed his own hair back showing the long jagged scar on the side of his forehead. "Oh God! It really is you!" Draco breathed out loudly, his hand shivering in the other's hold before he snatched it out.
Harry grinned but then advised himself to be narcissistic at the time. He pondered on the main subject. " you were a honey trap. Your head officer allows you to do so?"
"Oh yeah. Let's hope for the best." I gave a slight nod of head. Draco ushered us in quickly, his fingers not clenching around mine, oh no. They were on Victor's bicep. I went to the kitchen to put the pie on the slab. That's where I bumped into Ron.
Draco gulped as he took in the clean shaved man in front him, his jaw all square and lined, and his mouth in a huge shite-eating grin. Potter also wore a  thick, square framed  glasses which of course suited his face, just like how huge beard and brown goggles did. His hair had been pushed back and then to  side, his scar was still covered but Draco could make out the heated edges of it. He felt his cock stir and his arse clench as he remembered what they both had been upto not even forty-eight hours ago.
He knew Potter held all of his weight on his arms, as he was bent at a weird position and Potter pistoned in him relentlessly. And it was amazing to feel. His balls tightened. "Gonna cum?" Draco groaned in reply as he arched further back on Potter's chest. A hand brushed against the fuzz of his balls and then there was a gentle press at his perineum coupled with harder and faster and sharper thrusts right at the bundle of nerves in him. He came with a loud cry and long ropes of cum decorated the snake plant kept right on the side of the window. He took three deep breaths and slumped down on his knees, panting heavily.
Draco wanted to ask him to reconsider, to talk to him further, but his mind didn't allow him to plead. He winced when he stood up straight from the bed. He couldn't find any of his clothes, so he snatched the sheet from the bed and wrapped it around him. He could feel a trickle down his thighs but he chose to ignore it. "Fine!" He said haughtily as he limped to the door and then banged it shut.
The Dark Lord's hand had loosened from his wand and it was snatched away from his fingers and the warm body pressed against his chest vanished completely. Harry ran forward, snatching a sword from a soldier and pointed at the Dark Lord's chest. His peers might have guessed the correct opportunity too as they kicked and punched the men holding them, each holding on to a weapon of sort. Draco rushed to Harry's side , holding onto the stick and pointed it at the Dark Lord. The evil man had to chuckle at the situation. "You don't know how to use that Draco, it requires years of magic training. And more over, a magical core."
"Well... No." Draco removed his cotton trousers, fumbling now with his shirt. "The thing is I never saw his face." He moaned when Theo roamed his hands on him, lifting his legs up and his fingers wrapping around his length. He pushed a finger in his mouth and sucked on it wetly. "He touched me, and then touched me inside."
I flopped on his chest and I couldn't help but let my tears flow down my face. They were dropping on his skin, I'm sure he would have passed it off as sweat if it wasn't for my shoulders trembling. He called out my name a few times, but I didn't reply, hiding my face. "Draco?" He pulled my face up, I'm sure I looked like a mess, my nose red, my eyes teary, cheeks heated up and my hair disarray.
"No funny business, Padfoot. Put your hands where I can see them, both of you!" Harry glanced at Ron and nodded his head, and they both pulled their hands up. Ron rolled his eyes at the motion they had to do but didn't say anything.
"Head Auror Weasley, I got you raspberry muffins today. Three of them!" He handed Ron the box which the other gladly accepted with a quick snatch, opening it and stuffing one already in mouth. Malfoy already had a tissue paper out to hand it to him.
"But you implied it." Draco was swift in standing up. "I get it King Harry. I get that it's all about you, all about what happens to you. You just married me for some extra land. Fine then." He walked to his husband, poking his finger on the firm chest. "you can sit here on your arse. But I will not, I will save my father. I will save my kingdom. And then you can sit back and watch like an arrogant, spoiled Prince." Draco didn't wait for a reply and strode out of the room to his lab.
Two of them were old, but one was young: that one was Malfoy. They bowed, stiff and stern, before turning back and a large white canvas appeared behind them. Each of them twisted their wrists and a long round brush appeared in their hands, they all started with one stroke and moved together to make another then two simultaneous strokes. It felt less like a painting and more like dancing, they moved together and stopped together, in same direction and the same curve and lines. But they each made something else on the same canvas. The old man in the middle was making a sort of scribble of parallel lines, all of them curving to the top left and a few triangles at the bottom. The one beside him made circles, just circles and small rapid lines. Malfoy seemed to be making cloud like structures, followed by zig zag lines which looked like lightening. Moreover, it looked like they were making trash, Hugo could make better stuff than that. Maybe it was abstract, Harry thought. He looked about and realised he wasn't the only one with the same thought, many were discussing with the ones beside them. "What are they making?" He asked Hermione. She just shrugged her shoulders and muttered a 'I don't know'.
"C'mon, Malfoy. It's just coffee." Draco looked around as if thinking that someone might pop out of thin air staying 'Look how we tricked the ex-deatheater, Malfoy Jr'. But when it didn't happen, he acquiesced and hesitantly nodded his head. "Swell! I saw this cute little café nearby, I think you know about it. We can go there!" Draco ignored the way Potter's green eyes lit up to resemble shinning emeralds, and looked back at the direction of the said café and then saw the sky.
Potter looked happy then. He wanked him now, moving at a slow but in a pleasurable manner. He almost hummed a bit. "I hope you weren't a virgin."
"Where you were clinging to that old man. Were you on a date with him?" His eyes narrowed. I could now only see the green and black of his eyes.
"Why are you speaking his name like that? And I asked him how Muggle sex was different from wizarding ones. And he showed it to me in some small device of his. It was purely educational." He folded his arms on his covered chest.
Hermione found him and handed him a plate of cheese and salad, and forced him to eat to full and gulp down a tall glass of water. According to her he needed his proper energy in front of loads of people before he made his speech. But he didn't have the chance to look for Malfoy again, because as soon as he took his last sip, she pulled him back to the atrium and sat him beside her and Ron. The brunette and Luna soon arrived in front of them and called them all to sit down. There was a green curtain behind and they didn't say anything, just motioned their hands at the curtains. As they walked back the curtains lifted and revealed three men dresses in different clothes but in light attire.
He was angry too, I bet, three fold than before. He was gripping hard at the hem of  the blue night shirt he wore. "I had a coffee with Pansy day before yesterday, Greg called me to ask about his new shop, Millie informed of her cat birthing babies, Luna was talking to me about pygmypuff stool and different colours of it. Did you want me to tell you about those? How pink shit means that pygmypuffs are ready to copulate?" He did have a valid reason but I was still angry.
"I want to spend some time just with you, before I have to share you with someone for my whole life."
"Yes! Yes! Yes! A million times yes!" She was screeching. It was a wonder how Louis put up with it and is  going to put up with it every day. "Draco I'm married!"
Professor shook his head and along shook his long white beard. "Long before he even came to Slytherin, he hexed me to here. Until I turn to a corpse, I will haunt this place in my life. Probably even after death." Draco sighed.
Ron patted him on the shoulder. "Alright, Malfoy. Leaving all these- are the yesterday's documents done."
"Do not ever talk to me like that." Draco gritted out pulling at the red hair at the nape of his head which jut his head up. Harry winced for Ron internally, even though the red head didn't show an ounce of pain on his face. "You don't have much time to live, don't make your last few minutes full of pain and agony."
He saw the blond man blink once, then once again. First in confusion, then in astonishment. "I- I think, yes."
"No magical traces found in a ten meter parameter of the warehouse." He poked at a dead body of a middle aged woman. "No hints of spell either. It as if all of this was done by a Muggle."
"He's well. He would sleep for a while, but he will be back to normal soon." The old gaze shifted to his right. "And yours too , Harry."
"That can be a lot of things." Harry said- agitated. "But we are too close now. Ron and I can take a few men and hunt for those damn animals tonight."
"I know a lot many things." He winked before walking out of the room as if to straighten the world right again.
"What? No!" I groaned when I recalled what happened in the club. "Why are people keeping things from me?"
He was replied with a hissed form of chuckle. "There's no harm done to them. Your Father sits in Slytherin right now, your Uncle cleans my potion chambers with his wrists in shackles. But about your handmaiden- it's tough to say. She is quite pretty to not be touched by my men."
So tired cause I wrote this whole chapter once and it all got blanked out when I opened my device to upload. So this is like the second draft. Note to myself to do stuff offline and not in cloud. And I decided to write more words for a chapter so, long chapters now! Yay! Also I'm working on another drarry fic, not that seriously but yeah.
Draco let a smile upon his face. "Don't you know? Pregnant persons tend to be more chaotic with every changing mood and very high libido." He purposely whispered the last word. "And you only ever see me - whether that be through the keyholes of my rooms in Slytherin or right now as you want to see me in just a mere barely there garb. Are you just all see and no play, Dark Lord?" Draco taunted him with a smirk. He wanted nothing but to puke on his face, but he restrained himself.
He thought he was alone. That's why he jumped when someone called behind him. "Prince Draco." He huffed and turned around to see a very old man, his beard white as was his hair and he wore rimless glasses on his nose. Draco looked into those twinkling eyes of the man.
"He'll be well. I gave him today's potions." Draco said, his heart had been clenching at the thought of guilt he hid.
Draco nodded his head. “I did-“ he felt a sting on his left cheek, two seconds later he realized that Potter had slapped him. His eyes teared up and when he looked up to glare at Potter, he saw that those green eyes that haunted him in his dreams had a glow of red in them now.
He didn't come back the whole day, he didn't even come to burrow. When Molly asked I told her that Draco was not feeling quite well and she handed me a pot of beet soup as I was leaving. Teddy asked for him too, he turned around to go to play although in a slow manner when he heard that his cousin couldn't make it. I tried floocalling Pansy (I even called her husband's phone), she didn't reply at floo (and told me to bugger off when her husband picked up). The wards were set up too, so I couldn't apparate to their place. Bloody Bitchy witch: Draco would never know that I called her that. I even told Kreacher not to mention it in front of Draco. I slept in a cold bed that night, missing Draco's breath against my neck and his legs around my waist.
But then he grew up and realised how wrong he had been. How selfish he had been. That helped him gain patent rights in so many cases and even earn his position, so that he could help those who were being unjustified.
scared- him being the head Auror and the blond: a pardoned ex-felon. Harry just shook his head with a smile.
"You're boring to tell to. You just make noises like 'hm-hm'." That made a chuckle spill out from my mouth. Teddy just glared at me.
"Malfoy is taking over you." My smile dropped instantly and I looked at the damp cobblestones. "Harry, what happened?"
"Congratulations." Draco turned to leave, but then Potter wound his hand around his arm. It was heavy and warm, but a  careful grasp. He looked at the outstretch limb before glaring at its own. Potter didn't back down though, his grin just widened.
James chuckled. "you have a sharp tongue, Draco. The apple doesn't fall too far away from the tree." Draco glared at him. "and quite striking eyes, it's a shame you use them for glaring at a King." Draco winced when he felt a tight grip on his arm and he looked at his side to find green eyes looking at him sternly. He could only internally roll his own eyes at the Gryffindors and their stern looks. He let his eyes drop to the floor, his lips screwing to a pout. "it's alright Prince Draco. Sharp tongue is always welcome, but not to someone at the position above of you."
Draco swallowed and tilted the vials into his mouth. "Please don't say that, ...my majesty." James chuckled, before drifting off.
As soon as I entered the drawing room, I was pounced on by a mess of soft onesie and bright blond hair. I picked the boy up and twirled him around a few times before putting him down. He giggled as he hugged my leg. "Uncle Harry! Uncle Harry!" He grabbed his chubby arms at me. I replied to him with a coo and rubbed his hair to a mess.
"I love you." Draco said into the hot skin. The hand in his hair stopped and the heartbeat he listened to quickened. "I love you." Draco repeated. "I hadn't said it before, I didn't know. But now I do." He leaned back to look into the surprised eyes. "if you don't feel the same-"
"What laws?" He used his Auror voice- a bit by the end. It always made me weak on my knees, it also made me quiver in fear, he knew it. And he was still doing it. I accioed my wand and pointed at him.
Harry had to stop himself from wincing. He gulped audibly and Draco forced himself to a sitting position, as the raven helped to fluff the pillows for him. "You needn't sit." He was met by blank silver eyes. Harry's neck heated up and he reached to rub his nape. "I wanted to see how you were. Molly says you don't eat much, and it's been three days since you had a proper meal." Draco just shrugged his shoulders.
"Louis." Pansy greeted him back as she smashed another vinyl record. He looked around, his face turning pale as he took in the condition of his room. We had done quite a work to be told. I managed to break his big telly and some console of some kind, I think Harry called it station or something, ripped apart a painting and broke a bowl. Pansy went crazier, she scratched open the couch and threw the foam around, she broke the black glass table, smashed every wine glass she could find, broke the glass doors of the cabinet and threw an antique gramaphone, denting the metal flower terribly. She was now on the way to smash every record. She smashed another one.
Harry sniggered as he finished his first cup of coffee, and casted a statis on the other one. "He's just sucking up to you. You are his boss's boss, anyway. One day he'll come up to you and ask for something, and you wouldn't be able to say no."
"Yes, yes. The nonsense you drawl out." Harry holds the other feet now, rubbing a new piece of ice there.
"I'm sorry." He said. But Draco shook his head. He grabbed his hand and pull it to his sheet covered crotch. Draco was hard and the sheets were wet with pre cum.
"And why did you take such a hasty decision? I wouldn't say it's your long affair, cause I believe yesterday was the first time you met him."
The next morning I woke up earlier than I did usually. Draco was half awake, and I stood to leave for kitchen. I came back with two strong teas, one with milk and one without, and a plate full of toast and fruits. I gave him the milky tea and the vial of hangover potion which I had placed on the nightstand a few hours back. He grumbled and gulped down the potion like he did with his vodka shots before sipping on the tea. I let us take a few bites and sips before I asked him again. "Where were you last night?"
She accioed her wand and stripped off her trousers, palming her own cunt, all the while eating Draco out. "I'll- I'll do something." She panted out as she leaned back, delighted when the blonde whined.
"I apologize for that, Harry. But please try to understand. The Dark Lord would have all control of Slytherin if a child of my own, an heir, is not in existence."
"So much!" Draco's back arched upwards and Harry just couldn't stop himself from biting at his left pink nipple. Draco yelped and tugged at his hair and his legs clenched around his waist. "What are you doing?!" He groaned out. Harry lapped at the abused skin, giving it soft licks.
A chirpy  woman replied, her hair drying up and creating a frizzy mess due to the sun,"Calm down Ron. He was the one who said he wanted to meet. If not, we know to attack. That's what the note said."
I heard a light snore on my chest and I couldn't help but smile when I saw Draco sleeping on me. Maybe I was just wondering about a lot. Or maybe I was totally wrong. But
"Anyone but his lover." The old eyes charmed with mischief when Draco scowled. "He would say anything to the one he holds infatuation for."
"I don't! I swear on my unborn eggs!" It twisted and turned to get out of the hold of the hooves on its bodice. "I don't know. He didn't tell me!"
I took him to a nearby café, near Mungos. It was busy and it was lively. When we got through in, I could already see Harry. He had changed his hair to sandy blonde and removed his Auror robes. He had changed the colour of his undershirt to yellow and held a newspaper infront of him. No one would recognise him like that, all except me. I could every time tell who he his just by looking at his eyes. That's what saved him once. I grinned at Mr Flemming before wrapping my arms around his non injured elbow. "could you get me a lemon cake and something for you? I will be at a booth." He nodded and I went to the wooden table near the window. I sat with my back to Harry, well side of the back. I knew he could see my each and every movement but he wouldn't be able to read my lips. Mr Flemming came with a small plate of a big cake slice for me and a cup of tea for himself. I took in a bite and moaned loudly, loud enough to catch attention of people around me that included Harry.
She saw Draco bite at her lower lip and look at the hallway in which they were standing in, Harry herself realised that a foot of space had been created between them by now. "I wanted to say something to you. Try something, I presume, as well."
"Better walk away gentleman, it is of no concern of yours." He said rudely. Draco was about to retort back and he moved his hand to his wand pocket, but then there was a sharp tug on his wrist.
Draco groaned a bit. "But it's hot in here. If I could I wouldn't want to wear anything at all." Harry could feel a stir in his trousers but he restrained himself from pouncing on his husband. Before he could say anything there was a loud hoot from the balcony making him draw his hidden dagger. "That's Snape's owl!" Draco rushed to the bird perched there and held him carefully to bring him in the room. When he saw the look the other Prince gave him, he said with a calm voice. "Snape's my uncle. The alchemist of Slytherin." He placed the bird on the table and put a few crumbs of the bread he had been eating infront of it, and untied the note attached to it's leg.
Harry laughed loudly, each passing second making Draco shiver in fear wilder. "why you ask?" He didn't waste time before pulling Draco to the ground, pining him with one hand on both of his wrists, holding the legs with his knees. Draco struggled desperately, trying to pull his limbs. Harry slapped him on his face hard, pale skin turning red. Draco yelled loudly, calling for unheard help. That only turned on Harry. His length was hardening and he grinded down against the soft prick. "yes! Shout more! Cry for help. I want to see that face of yours." He leaned down to lick at the long neck that he dreamt to wet dreams in past few nights. He sunk his teeth in the skin, sucking it to bruise terribly.
Harry had his eyes softened. "it's just one out of many, Draco. Not everyone is like that. And it's not wrong to be gay. He probably didn't know how to express. Just let it go. I'm with you here." He held the pale, soft hand. "I won't leave you, I promise." He wrapped his arms around him.
"I did. I just wanted to get to know you better." His jaw was pinched and he let out a closed whine.
"Yeah, it feels ... Good. What a layman way to present this situation, Potter." Harry shut her up with a deep kiss swallowing all the whimperings which she let out.
Malfoy had just finished with the organising of the papers and then had moved to Harry's table, clearing the mess of letters and incendio-ing  then unnecessary letters which most of the times included horny writings and nude photographs. "I consider the term secretary, Head Auror Weasley." He held a pink letter to his nose and took a whiff in. "Oh look Missus Flemmings wrote again. And this time it's jasmine eau." He held it out to Ron and Harry had control himself from slamming his head onto the desk again. He chose to take another sip of the coffee.
"Hermione is getting cranky too. Hugo is eating all her happy hormones." I chuckled at  that. Hermione was six months along now, even then she didn't  leave her position as the state secretary. Ron was always after her to take a leave, but she was just so adamant. I still remembered: a while back when Hugo first kicked, she had screamed for us through her patronus and Ron and I left the immediate mission only to find her stroking her belly with adoration. We were annoyed, but I was really happy too.
"I heard Mrs Granger-Weasely is running for the position of a minister in the cabinet, will you be supporting her though that's a question."
The thing is, that didn't stop me from going on a self proclaimed - hidden mission when Draco told me he was going for a movie with a friend of his. This friend, I knew with no doubt, was Victor. Kingsley gave me an early leave when I told him there was a family issue in the run (which wasn't a lie), he just smacked me on my back and told me to deal with it right now. I was under a loud glamour and had changed my clothes to Duddley's old ones and was now sitting three rows behind Draco and Victor. There were sharing a small tub of popcorn, and that made me remember that Draco didn't like popcorn. Too salty, too roasted, too non-filling for him, he always said. I just couldn't help but think- why the fuck was he eating them now? With Victor that too! At that moment I wanted nothing but to flip that popcorn tub on both of them. But I cooled myself and extended a vision charm on my glasses when the lights in that cinema hall dimmed. Through out the two hours and seventeen minutes of the film I didn't pay attention to the screen. I got to know that it was a sappy romantic when there was a lot of crying and sniffling from the woman beside me and then a loud "woo" from her after a matter of minutes (probably because the actors kissed). I had my eyes on Draco and Victor, the way Draco would throw his head back at times to chuckle when Victor would whisper in his ear between the scenes, or when he would say something to Victor and the slight tears which formed in his eyes cause of which Victor gave him his napkin to dab on. And of course the way they looked at each other with a smile when the lady beside me had yelped the "woo".
"It's Granger-Weasely." Draco's eyes threatened to roll, but he controlled them. "I didn't know you painted professionally."
"I don't know how to say this." Harry motioned him to continue. "This morning, and there was semen on my door."
Harry considered the fact for a while. "Would you mind if we allow a few werewolves into the forests of Manor?" Harry could easily read his expression. Malfoy didn't like the idea one bit, of course he wouldn't, the land was his ancestors'. But there was nothing wrong in asking. He saw him nod his head stiffly and then turn back to the shelf. Harry could feel the pout forming onto his face. He sighed heavily. He was about to say to him but then Abott's patronus flew in threw the walls and Harry had to rush out of the door to the apparation point.
Draco didn't look back at him. "Do you know when I had known that you were perfect for me?" Harry shook his head, but then he realised that Draco wasn't looking at him; so he whispered a 'no'. "Uncle always talked about a Prince of Gryffindor, reckless as he is as a monkey and his hair wild as a bird's nest," Harry rolled his eyes. "His heart is of gold. He told me how you had saved many poor, not only of Gryffindor but of Ravenclaw as well, from harsh tax impositions, from mighty strong knights, from evil landlords, just at the age when you were barely twelve." Harry remembered the time. Ron's father had been one of them, Hermione and he, had tried their very best to improve the Weasley family's condition, but then he had seen it impact everyone else as well. Even though it started as a personal agenda it had wide spread to most of the people of the same economic station. Hermione had been by his side to suggest how to speak, how to discuss along with a lot of mock debates- that's how he had succeeded in his motive after a period of half an year. Everyone had cried out his name in joy, the kingdom had rejoiced and Harry knew his father was proud of him. "You were a hero from a story at that time." He perked up when Draco looked back at him, and gave the blonde man a small smile. "You might find it funny, but that is how I learnt about the world. I wasn't allowed to venture out of the castle gates. Barely any of the commons of Slytherins know how I look like. For them I'm nothing but a shy and reserved Prince, who might hate the commoners. I was able to involve myself in the court proceedings only behind a huge veil  of black fabric, and Pansy and Blaise by my either sides to speak for me." Harry now came to know why he had been flagged by two of his subordinates on the first day they had met on the barren lands. "Uncle told me about what happened around us, in the neighborhood kingdoms, in the faraway lands. Told me how Victor Krum had given up his noble title to become a knight. Fluer of Beauxbatons, being the most beautiful of the woman in all lands. How Luna Lovegood was exiled as she tried to practice an old and forgotten spell." Harry hasn't ever heard him speak so much than the first night in Gryffindor, specially never of his memories. So he let him, placing his hand on the other's knee which was covered by sheets.
I was then blasted back from him, my back hitting the couch arm softly, I felt traces of magic between Charmond and I. I blinked rapidly turning towards the fireplace and there stood Harry, dust evident on his robes and his eyes- merlin his eyes were, not just furious, they were
"And you're living with him?" Potter said with a warning in his voice. Draco could only blink, he took in his attire and Potter was in a black shirt and black trousers, perfect to blend in with a black night. He couldn't be spotted by anyone of the neighbors even if Draco chose to make a ruckus.
"No!" He struggled. "Leave me be! Let me go now you-" He didn't have the chance to speak any further when he saw a black cape and a loud whoosh of the sound. The scruffy man was pushed to the dirty floor of the alley and his wand was thrown away. Draco stilled in his actions, when he saw the man turn around and take in the situation not before stepping a foot on the scruffy man's chest, holding him down, his own long wand pointed at him. He had a black mask on his face, which covered most of face and all his hair, leaving just his right cheek visible.
Ron looked at him for a five seconds, them slammed his fork loudly on the table. "You fucking wanker!" His mouth sported a wide grin immediately. "You have a crush on him!"
"I know, I know." His swiped his finger pads against my cheeks, holding them delicately. "and I'm so sorry."
"Yes. They are just following normal protocol. They don't get close to the bodies though, our team makes sure of it."
"Yes. My child, is- is now growing in you. And I'm very much happy." He risked putting his palm on top of the pale one. Draco looked at him with a raised brow, but he didn't say a word. "I, really am, asking for your forgiveness, Draco. It pains me, not as much as you do, but a bit too much to see you in such situation. Slytherin is my responsibility as well as it is yours. I would do anything to save it. I would do anything for the man who has captured my heart in just a few days time." Grey eyes widened when he heard that. "And with the gift of child you give to me, I feel more motivated than ever." His eyes filled up with tears and Harry thumbed at the pale-now-red cheeks to wipe them away. "I truly am ashamed as to what I did last night and did this morning. I was brash and didn't mean any of it."
"Smoke. Tobacco. Cigarettes" Draco gasped before leaning back. "Of cigarettes! He smelt like cigarettes!"
This story has the long awaited update now, phew. Before anything else I would like give my excuse for a five month late update for this fic. I got a lot of comments, messages (and pokes from a few of my friends) which I did not answer. I had wanted to ghost this fanfic, but then I was way too much in love with this AU. I had thought about this two years back, and I couldn't just give it up.
That made Draco sit, his head heavy but no longer dizzy. "I don't want to see him!" He narrowed his eyes to a glare. "I don't want him seeing me too! That fucking bastard!" Hermione gaped at him, more shocked at him swearing.
Draco looked at him and caught  eye contact with Potter. He shook his head. He whispered a please and his eyes begged. But it was too late when Potter pointed his arm at Mathew and yelled "Stupefy!"
"Same for you two." Draco spoke to Blaise and Pansy, them both nodding their heads in agreement. A second and Harry had picked up a speed of eagle, moving his horse to his maximum run. He saw Draco closing his eyes and clenching his hands around his arms. There indeed was dust and hot wind passing through them, as if slapping them. He unclipped one side of his cape from his shoulder and wrapped it around the frame in front of him. Draco gulped, he was sure though that he couldn't be heard due to the loud wind and thumping of the horse's hooves, but he gladly accepted the red fabric, digging his fingers in it.
"Alright...Would you like to grab a cup of coffee?" Harry winced internally at the timing. He had decided to give a bit of time, possibly a few more meets; but he wanted to talk to Malfoy more.
Harry slammed his head on the desk again. "Ron, I don't care. Keep it down though." Ron did have the tendency to roll words loudly in excitement. He blamed it on strong tea, Harry blamed it on him  spending too much time with Hugo.
I narrowed my eyes at him. "Harry. Sit properly." When he motioned to stand, I snapped. "On the floor!" I noticed that he wore his worn out, snitches pyjamas bottoms, when he sat in Indian style. I crawled to his side of the bed, barely feeling the bedsheets tug away from my own naked body, and let my legs fall down the bed and cross one another as I stared down at him. "you're a cheating bastard, Harry. And according to laws I have every right to cast a crucio on you."
"Don't lie, dear. You might have consequences to face. My magic tells me you went down to the dungeons."
Harry's eyes had turned stern and stony. His grip on the sheet of paper had tightened that he almost ripped it. He had never met this Dark Lord, but even by the way he wrote and snake like twists in the calligraphy was enough for him to know that this particular man was not only dangerous but evil as well. The way he had addressed Draco was truly lecherous, out right disgusting. Harry could make out the hisses in his writing and even the moments he might have moaned while inking the letter.
"Do you mean the Batman one?" Malfoy inquired as he pushed the windows open and the cool winter air blew in. "As to how Harry Potter would react? A bit pitiful if I must say."
"You fucker." Ron didn't back down anyway, so Draco had to kick him in his stomach. He let out a small groan then, a reaction necessary.
All I can say is that after the second round, Draco pulled out the dress he had brought when we went to Malibu. The next day we both took a leave and had lunch by the oak tree we had in the backyard. Upon my insistence, we went to watch the film that he and Victor had already seen (along with me, but he didn't need to know that yet. I would probably tell him after a week or so, when he would be terribly pleasant), he kept on saying "oh I love this scene", "this is going to hit hard", "did you see that, that's so sweet?" I couldn't pay attention to the movie at all, I just kept on looking at him and his wild reactions. He got a lot of kisses in the dark theatre, from me that is, and he reciprocated so well. We came home late, after eating at the new Chinese restaurant and loads of shopping bags (which I knew would appear anyway).
But the red head decided to grin. "Charlie Weasley. It was time I actually met you Draco Malfoy." See now that made my jaw drop.
"This is terrific!" Harry closed the distance between two of them, holding the blonde to his chest. "but can you make the potion?"
He shook violently as his eyes met deep green eyes and a wide smirk. "hello Draco! Nice night." Draco didn't move. He couldn't even if he wanted to, he was stood with shock and fear.
He chuckled lightly and stood up, handing out the flowers to him. Draco looked at the orchids as if they were crying mandrakes. "I saw too many plants at your place, and thought you would love flowers." He said a foolish excuse, mentally slapping himself for not preparing in advance.
If only he could find his voice. He sobbed and wailed. He didn’t know what was happening to him- would his fate be better than Azkaban or worse? Would he better hope for a time turner so that he could go back to when Dark Lord was still alive- he could manage to get in his good side.
"I just don't get it. Mathew always told me everything. I know him since I came to Muggle world. He helped me with everything around me. From jobs to documents. Then why?" Draco let his head fall on the broad chest. He inhaled deeply. "I can't get that merlin awful smell out of my nose."
"Have you eaten anything?" Draco shook his head. She called for a servant and instructed him to get something. "we have called for Harry too. He'll be right here!"
"We'll get along well, alright." Potter looked at him with a heated gaze before his eyes narrowed slightly. Draco took a dry gulp of air. "won't we, Draco?"
Malfoy Manor was seized, his mother has chosen to spend her time in a small villa of Black family in Rome, and Theo had arranged a flat in Muggle London for him. It wasn't much large, but it was adequate- a two bedroom apartment with a small kitchen and drawing room, which was mostly occupied by Prince, a small, black spotted cat which Theo had got for him from Venice a couple of months back. He didn't like the creature for a while but then had grown fond of it.
"We'll do something, Draco. Slytherin and Gryffindor are together now. We can go for a war now itself. But-"
"Have you now, Prince?" Harry nods his head sternly, his jaw clenched. "well that would be swell. Let's get you all ready. We only have a few hours to prepare everything and you both two." She stands up to move deeper into the forest all the others behind her.
Out of all the people, she least expected Draco Malfoy to turn up at her door, at quarter to midnight. The blonde was drenched thoroughly, her long hair fell heavily down to her back and the light night gown of sort she had worn did nothing to cover her up in a decent fashion rather than protect her from the cool breeze. She shivered at the place, her mercury eyes frantic and teeth chattering. "May I come in?" Even in a vulnerable state, she managed to sound unconcerned and strict.
Years of Auror practice and field work had her trained for any sort of attack, but she did not expect Malfoy to push her back against the wall. Maybe while they were in Hogwarts, she would have kept an open eye even while asleep to seek out Malfoy's next mischievous tactic on Harry; but now- more than a decade later, she had seen the cackling, rude blonde bully evolve into a quiet yet snarky woman, Direct Secretary to the the Defence Minister.
He quickly leaned back and jumped off the bed. He was about to rush for the bathrooms, when the quick idea stuck him. He rushed to the doors, as if he was running down in search of a bowl, but then stopped himself infront of the  still bowing wolf and open his mouth. He gagged and then saw his sick fall  from the head to the snout of the wolf. It was glaring at him and growled ferociously. "oh merlin!" Draco gasped and then gagged. This time the animal jumped back and the sick fell onto the ground.
"It's an order general Weasley. Stay here. If I'm not back or a messenger is sent within half an hour- kill them."
"You imbecile! You told me to disrobe infront of everyone!" And Harry immediately regretted that decision, no one should see Prince Draco in such a way, except him. Harry almost choked on that thought.
"What are you doing Draco!" Harry shouted, his voice boomed in the court. No one reacted, except for the snake like man, who grinned in delight.
“I know sweetheart. I know. You’re just so beautiful. Fucking Voldemort and Lucius for keeping you all to themselves.”
"No, it takes the normal time. I just conceived quicker." She nodded her head eagerly. "and I don't think Harry should go too, tonight. He is having too many responsibilities to maintain now. He's a King and a King shouldn't leave his kingdom just because he feels like." Draco pointedly doesn't look at him, maintaining an eye contact with Hermione instead. Harry sighed knowing the reaction he was currently receiving. He raked his hair with his fingers. He was happy, happy that he would be a Father soon, but the reaction he got from Draco brought his mood down.
It was raining heavily, cats and dogs screeching on the streets. A carriage passed by and stopped infront of an old building. An old man came out of the rattling cottage, his face set grim and his shirt barely holding his tummy. From the dripping carriage jumped a boy of not more than thirteen- his dry brown hair now turning wet, his skin pale as a sick man's and his eyes red like the brightest rubies. He held nothing but a book, which he protected in his damp brown jacket. He bent in a greeting and said. "Well evening sir. I'm Tom, I'm here as an apprentice for the Professor." The men led the boy in before slamming the door shut hard. The rain poured in harder and a puddle was thrown onto the door as the carriage moved away.
I walked by the street, looking and glancing at the glass panes and the sales behind it, when I was pulled by my elbow to an alleyway. I couldn't help but yelp and my heart beat sped up. I was ready to kick the person in the shin, when I breathed out heavily as I saw Harry. And Harry did not look pleased. He looked furious and his pupils were blown wide. "Harry!" I smacked at his chest. "you scared me!"
"Not as much as the Queen of Gryffindor here, who would soon be Queen of all lands of Hogwarts and my precious partner of life and bed." Draco physically cringed at the mention. The Wizard laughed proudly.
I knocked on the door twice and then twice again. My heart fluttered when I heard his groan. "Really not in a mood Pansy, I'm knackered!" I could already imagine him in some white pyjamas, with his hair mused and sheets tangled around his legs. I caressed the door, as if I was caressing his body. I knocked again. "Pansy, I swear on mother's china- I'm tired. I don't even know how I'll go to Mungo's."
"Anything for Gryffindor and her people, my King." Harry smiled and everyone reached for their horses. Hermione gave up on hers and rode with Ron. Harry noticed their secret hushes and whispers but then averted his gaze when it became intimate. He really missed Draco with all of his heart.
The grin dropped from the tanned man's face. He looked quite serious now. "It's heard that an Officer participates a lot in honey traps. And many of the mafia seniors have seen his pale arse. True, Malfoy?"
“Don’t be.” He said with a hot whisper in his ear. “I wouldn’t have survived later on if you hadn’t done that.” Draco realized that his cheeks were hot and he wanted to scream out loud. No one except Potter would hear him. Then there were fingers on his jaw, almost pinching his chin. Potter turned his broom around with a simple maneuver and Draco had to force himself to look at the handle of his broom, but not for long. Because when Potter pulled his chin and told him to look at him; Draco did, and he knew he was a goner.
"I might have lost it." I slipped down my trousers and then I was stark naked. I did not lose it obviously. Harry gave it to me on my birthday, even when he said it was silver, I knew it was high quality platinum with a chrystalised tear of unicorn. I gave it Charmond, for safekeeping.
He smirked against my lips. "In an old shirt and pants, which barely match with each other and hair all messed around. I bet I have bags under my eyes."
"The Dark Lord." He stated,  before continuing.  "My husband and his people, me and my people and everyone in Hogwarts: we are sick of his ruthlessness. Such evil that he bears upon us, without any remorse. He has made so many puppets from good people, who were once righteous. We have found as to how to defeat him, but we need to know a few things."
Harry chuckled, shaking his head. "what's this Draco? Are you saying that I casted a spell on him?" He said in a sarcastic tone. He stood up taking a few steps forward, making Draco take more steps back. "I don't even have the wand with me."
"Oh my dear, precious Dove." He hissed with a smug tone as he sat upon the throne. His eyes were thin and narrow, but they glowed red like hot iron in furnace. He held a long stick- which he called it as his wand, and moved his other hand over his hairless head. Dressed in all black robes, which even covered his finger tips, the Dark Lord grinned at the blonde who stood infront of him, right in the middle of the long hall. "I knew you would come." He cooed as he stood up, walking quietly as if he was slithering and held up his hands to touch the man. "One call from me and you came, lovely Dove."
When he reached the room he was assigned to, after a few hours of random wandering and thinking, he found the room empty. He was glad, until he found a note on the vanity desk. It was written elegantly and in the same handwriting which had called him to Ravenclaw. The Dark Lord had
"Mr Flemming." I knew Harry was just out the door and he could very well hear us. "why don't we go for a cup of coffee and we can talk about you ... and your Wand, in detail. I could use a break too." An advice for one and an inneudo for other. Two birds with one stone.
"I'll make the bill for Mr Harry Potter, it would be one hundred and seventy." Harry just signed him a cheque and left the lavish shop with the breeze blowing his hair on the face, to join Hermione and Ron who were dressed themselves in expensive robes in matching colours of ocre. He greeted them with a warm hug each which was pleasant for the cold weather, and apparated to the Grand City Hall.
"And why such sudden change of mood, Draco? Not that I mind but feel suspicious." The man grinned down at him and Draco suddenly realised the height difference between them, as he looked up.
"I do." He says sternly. "I want you to promise, that at least for five years from now, you'd stay loyal to me."
"My King." Draco sharp voice cut him. "I am taking supplements and having enough water. Is that all you wanted to say?"
"Can't you just finish it now?" Harry sensed a bit of command in it, it was refreshing. But Malfoy stopped himself. "I mean- is it okay to finish it now?"
The woman just smiled and patted at his shoulder. "Of course, of course. Wouldn't want to interrupt two young lovers."
"Victor- showed it to you?" He huffed and buttoned up his (my) shirt and put the pillow on his lap, covering his half hard cock. "Draco?" I asked when he looked outside the window. "
Harry sighed before leaning in and capturing her lips with her own. "You're not committing a sin." She tugged at the soft curls at her nape. "You'll feel good. I promise you that." She placed slow and sweet kisses down from her jaw to her neck and shoulders, nibbling in certain places, tasting Draco as much as she could for this would be the only chance she'd ever get in her whole lifetime.
"I would like to apologize for that. She just looked into wizarding paints right now, and there is a hypnotising effect to it, that's what makes them come to life." Harry felt a burst of anger in him, he didn't want anything to happen to Rose, and he had even told Malfoy that she wanted to learn in Muggle manner. But when he opened his mouth to say something, Malfoy beat him to it. "It won't last long, I promise. But she needs to be able to control her mind while she is using them. And I even make others do it, but it doesn't affect them in any manner. Yet they come to understand colours better. She'll be fine Potter, I swear on it." Malfoy's cheeks were red by the time he finished, and Harry realised he didn't want to piss him in any manner. Harry could understand the amount of power he held over him. He sighed and cooled himself down, and nodded his head.
"Then do so." James nudged him and Draco reluctantly walked to the wardrobe and put on a pair of maroon trousers. He walked back and slid in the space James had created for him just by his side. He couldn't stop the tears from rolling down as he hugged the older man and slept along with a hiccups with a warm hand on his head.
The Dark Lord smirked up at him. "I do. It's just-" Draco cut him with a loud moan as he grinded hard downwards.
"Of course not." His hold loosened a percentage. "I'm just worried about you. He might be manipulating you to..."
Then there was a buzzing in my pocket. I stilled and felt the wand buzz twice fast and thrice slow. I cursed a 'fuck' and rushed to the bathroom and apparated to a place which looked a  dock. It smelt like salt and fish. I entered the warehouse where a junior Auror greeted me. "Auror Potter, we found ten bodies, all dumped in the water. We are guessing it was done not more than twenty minutes ago. The magical signatures are there too, and there are a few bodies which might be further in the water."
I was both thankful and angry at that ( thankful cause otherwise Draco would have fallen back. Angry - because what gave
When she leaned back the blonde whined aloud. "Just a moment, pretty," said she. She sucked on her longest finger, covering it with as much wet as she could before slowly pushing it in through the tight walls. It was so tight she was scared it might bleed, but it didn't. She noticed Draco grabbing the sheets in fists, her eyes shut tight and her lower lip in a bite. Harry blew at the shiny clit making Draco leave her swollen lip and her thighs shiver. Harry curled her finger upwards before taking it out and pushing it in again. Draco cried out beautifully.
They must have lasted at most ten minutes. Draco had a way with his mouth- more with his tongue, actually. They were laying on the wooden floor of their living room, Theo’s legs on the scratched up couch and Draco's around Theo's waist, when Theo said,"Do you think it might turn out to be real?" Draco looked at him with a raised brow. "Your dream. Will we get our lives back?"
Draco shook her head. "No. It feels good." Only Draco Malfoy could manage to blush even while red. "It's just..." Harry raised her brows and rubbed at the smooth skin of her thigh. "I haven't- there hasn't been any means of penetration in there, in the recent years."
“You fucking whore.” Draco felt tears slip down his cheeks. “How many times, huh? How many times did you fucking slip into Goyle’s bed and rode his dirty dick? Bet you do it every night, you slag!” As if to make point Potter wrung his neck and Draco cried out openly, gasping in as much air as he could.
'Harry' fulfilled his demand (or request, actually) by thrusting in and out at a faster pace after only saying. "Why, of course, Draco." Draco had to hold onto the arm around his waist, while his other hand went ahead upwards to dig into raven hair.
"Muggles do this while having sex. I thought you'd like it, with you know - your muggle childhood with those awful muggle relatives of yours."
Unlike the Slytherin castle which had four storeys and less area it covered on the ground, apart for its wide gardens and lawns which had various species of flora and fauna; Gryffindor castle was wide and spacious, it didn't have large gardens but had a large greenhouse. It had plain and bare lawns, and he found a few novice soldiers practicing there. He was tired by the time he reached the huge kitchen, which was bustling loudly. There were loud shouts, but the most of a red haired woman. She looked tired and age showed on her face, but she was more active than any of the younger ones around her. He didn't know how he would enter so he planned to turn, when the woman approached him with a smile he stood startled. "oh dear, you're awake this early. Tell that to others now, would we? You're new here, aren't you, dear?"
"I didn't let him sleep last night and he was late by two hours for his work." I did receive a hasty owl from Harry saying that he was really upset and now Robards had given him an earful along with a desk job. I honestly couldn't care less, even if I wanted to.
"Call me Draco, Rose." Harry wanted to call him Draco. Malfoy bid them goodbye, and a few teenagers rolled in the makeshift shop with a 'Hiya Draco's.
"Why don't you run a bath? Go to your rooms and get ready over there first, before having breakfast. From what I've heard from Hermione, a child is in process of existence there." He pointedly looked at his abdomen, making Draco blush.
Harry, worried already that he was, frowned his brows and picked up the note. "Draco?" Draco nodded his head agreeing for him to read. Harry's lips formed to a grim line as he read through.
King James, who looked like an elder version of Harry only that his eyes weren't green, looked at both of them with a  stern look. "Harry," his voice was a deep baritone with a slight hint of age, Draco noticed. He looked like his father too, but while Lucius had a sincere and clear voice, Draco had a certain airy tone. "I have heard that you've got yourself married, without anyone's say, with no one other but Prince of Slytherin itself." He looked straight at Harry. "one day, you hurry off with a small lot of people with my smartest councillor and the general of my army; who are your best mates, of course they fall to your whims." His stare falls onto the said pair, who looked down to stare at their feet. "And the very next day you bring a spouse, and married, and even magically bonded with him. Were you of your rational mind at the time?"
"Coming from where? Which direction?" The Dark Lord turned to face Greyback completely now, his back to Draco- so he couldn't see Draco's worry and anxiousness.
"I think that's enough prep for you." Harry pulled out his fingers. He used his precum to lube himself up and lined his head at the entrance. "here we go!" He pushed in, in one thrust. Draco almost felt his throat jump out of his mouth at the sudden intrusion. His cries increased in volume and he could feel new tears roll down his face. He struggled around as much as he could, but he couldn't throw away the stronger man. A few aimed thrusts later he felt a huge tug inside of him and one of cries turned to a loud shout. He stopped himself from moving and saying anything when he felt that feeling again. It felt too bad yet too good. He didn't want to feel it, but a few prods at the same place again and again made him yelp out again.
Hermione saves the pride of Gryffindor."What Ron means to say is, this is unbelievable and uncalled for. How could our Prince marry yours? Gryffindor and Slytherin have been in a dispute since years. Is this for what you'd call us in such a short notice and in heat of noon? You could be punished for such humourless lunacy."
"Yeah! Yeah, I love it, sir!" Harry sucked at his shoulder. This time round he was going to leave marks that would last for at least a week.
She was sure Draco might have unrooted so much of her hair by now and covered her face and back with red lines of scratches, but one look at the red face, closed eyes and bitten mouth wide open to let out pants and frequent whimpers, had had Harry forget all the little pains she faced at that moment. She was sucking on the clit and lined her finger against the wetness, when Draco gasped out, "Wait!" Harry halted all her moments.
The door then slammed open. "Draco! What the fuck are you doing?!" I turned around quickly, and Flemming might have been surprised too, because the puckers tightened again, resuming their suck on my back hard. Which made me yelp.
"I- I told you, I'm coming back." He kept on huffing and deep breathing. Draco looked around and it was already quite dark. He had wanted to say that Potter was acting totally bonkers, but then he remembered that he had already insulted pretty much the other day in the celebration. "For coffee?"
"I'm- I'm not naked!" The blonde tried to cover her chest with the towel, the ends slipping dangerously. "I'm wearing a gown!"
"Nice job, Ron." Harry said with a smile, and patted on his shoulder. Draco had smoke fuming out of his ears.
"Sure, wh-" he got interrupted by Hermione. He would have strangled her to death had she not been his childhood friend and his counselor as well.
"The panther is not real, nor can it actually come out of the painting, so please do not worry, s'il vu plais." The old man said again, smoothing out his thick moustache. "This is a... unnamed thing that we are working on. We are still..." He flailed his arms. Malfoy walked quickly and whispered into his ear. "Oui. Merci, mon Cher. We are still in process and in development of something extraordinary. Now, merci beaucoup. Thank you very much." He nodded and walked out of the centre, leaving the painting with a hooting owl for people to admire, along with his two men. Harry jumped to follow him, ignoring the hisses of Hermione.
"I could help. I know a bit of electronic stuff." Of course Harry could use his wand, but he wanted more time. Wanted an excuse. And Malfoy  probably didn't know that  the wand could  be used on Muggle electronics as well. And he shouldn't  be knowing that as well. He saw pink  lips getting bitten infront of him.
"Draco," James called out to him, his eyes softened when he saw the wet eyes. "You can be as you are, we aren't against it. You would be the spouse of the future ruler of Gryffindor, and now that you have mentioned, of Slytherin as well. Please make yourself at home." He turned his head slightly to look at his son. "and Harry, I would appreciate if you treated your now husband with utmost love and care. He is your husband, an equal. Not your subordinate." Harry could only nod his head in reply. "You all have traveled quite a long way. Please have some rest now. The dinners will be in your chambers. The Slytherin mates of Draco are welcome to stay."
I gave her a dangerous smile. "oh yes I am. I threatening you infront of Robards, the head Auror, the whole Auror department, an Unspeakable and a powerful woman who is engaged to a Muggle police officer. So you better take it seriously" for emphasis I leaned on my arms on the table and put my face infront of hers. "you understand, don't you?" She gulped before nodding her head.
Draco chuckled. "You underestimate me, my husband. I was trained by the best. Give me the right instruments and perfect ingredients, I can make it in a swift."
"General Weasley makes a point." Hermione could feel her inner shrewd counselor surfacing. "perhaps you could disrobe and show that you have nothing on you before having a private meeting with the Prince."
"I apologize for my words in afternoon. I was not in my right mind at the time." Draco crept out of the bed, staggering towards him. He was aware of his undressed condition, but this was just his husband. He sat himself on his lap, Harry's hand winding around his waist.
Draco took a deep and told him everything. About how his father had been in trouble since he was nothing but a young adolescent. That he would have been married to Dark Lord if he hadn't approached Harry. About the letter they received from Snape and the recipe of the potion. That he would have prepared a healing potion for James if he hadn't been making his own. That Harry had told him to be out of his room as he didn't want to look at him anymore. He was sobbing by the end and James caressed his hair and cheeks with a gentle touch. "I miss my Father so much, my majesty. I long for eyes to look at me with adoration. I envy your and Harry's bonding but I swear I didn't mean to cause any issues between you two. If I could go back in time and make your potion prior to mine, I would." James gave him a warm smile and pulled him to an embrace. Draco hid his head in the chest and cried there.
"The Leaky's." Ron just shrugged his shoulders and bit into another of the biscuits. "I was with Dean and I saw them in a booth."
"You state a lot of conditions and opinions, being that you're just a mere counselor and not even a royal blood." He raised a brow at her. He looks at Harry with the same expression. "Fine then! Your subordinates will stay here, while you and I have a talk at your camp."
"You didn't talk to me!" Pansy was screeching and it was wonder that Louis just smiled at her, that banshee look on her face was scary. Fucking mental case I tell you, both of them.
"I hate you." His wide eyes were tickling with tears and I wanted nothing but to rush to him and hug him tight and kiss him till we both were panting, but I stayed where I was.
I turn around to face a plump woman, her hair cut in straight bangs, dressed in a Nirvana T shirt and printed shorts. "I'm sorry, miss." I flash her my ring finger of left hand. "I'm married."
"I made that out." Draco said excitedly, his brows perking. "He has a wand, he never parts with it. It has all his magic in it."
Those eyes rolled. "that's pleasing to here." He brought him up to kiss him. "I'm not going to jail."
He didn't touch any of ours lower body though. When I did try to, he grabbed my wrists in a tight hold and put them above my head, against the headboard. I struggled but he was too strong, damn him being an Auror. He grinned when he mouth a no, his teeth biting at one of my nipples and finger running at the other. I was withering below him, it must have been hours, no ages, as he kept on that with random bites on my waist and torso. I kept on calling his name, at last I sobbed out, shivering with need and anticipation. "please Harry."
"One of those pureblood things?" She took Draco's groan as affirmative and sucked hard on her clit. "Never thought that a pureblood thing would ever make me turn on so much." She bit lightly on the pulled up skin making the blonde whine. Harry herself moaned when Draco pulled at her hair and she felt her whole self thrum in excitement. "You like it, yeah?" Draco kept on moaning ‘yes’ and Harry kept on diving her tongue in and out, holding down the slim hips which withered upwards haphazardly to meet her jabs.
It scowled and sneers with its animated features. "I won't say." Neville dropped down and stomped hard in its guts. It almost screamed. "His name takes his power from him. It's his bane!"
"Oh fuck!" She pulled her legs up to sit criss- cross, I didn't really care when her whole vagina came into sight. You usually get a habit in seeing a thing a lot many times to think of it as normal. "what are you going to do?" She stuffed a chocolate frog in her mouth.
"Yeah." I rubbed a hand on my face, skewing my glasses a bit my forehead and my eyes burnt. "Him too."
It was Draco's turn to snort. "make it 11." When Harry looked at him as of he didn't believe him, his eyes widened. "what? I was trying to get your attention!"
"Excuse me!" He called out and the old man thankfully stopped. He saw Malfoy widen his eyes like the same owl he might have drawn. "I need to talk to you, Mister..."
"W-what can I do?" Draco pulled at his hair. Evil thoughts crossed his mind and he shivered. He bit his lip thinking of all the possibilities which all ran to Lucius on his deathbed. He then looked at twinkling eyes of a serious old face. "You!" He snatched himself away from Professor. "You taught him all that!"
"Some stuff. Harry, I'm tired and I'm dirty. I want to bath, can we please talk after that?" He gave a stiff nod and I entered the bathroom, filling the tub with warm water and some deep River salt. I took two hours in the bath. It was already night when I came back out and I saw Harry on the armchair, waiting in the dark. "Merlin, what's wrong with you?"
"Yes, God!" He moaned out, clasping at the covered shoulders of Harry and riding desperately on thick fingers. His head fell forwards then, hiding his face in warm neck.
would ever know of it? We're Slytherins for Salazar's sake, one of our qualities is to be sneaky." There was a murmur beside her and her tone immediately changed to kind and generous and romantic, which I thought never made Pansy Parkinson. "of course not honey, I would never do that to you. Your cock makes me hooked around you."
Draco shook her head. "I don't know. But I did say I want to try something." Harry frowned when Draco shrugged her shoulders and the red towel dropped to the floor. Long fingers then came up and placed themselves under the thin straps of the nightgown, pushing them down the bony shoulders making the satin slither down, next to coarse looking towel. Harry gasped aloud, unable to look away from Draco Malfoy standing naked in her hallway.
"Harry stay away from this creature. It hypnotises to make us think what we don't want to." Ron let out his sword along with a dagger. Harry noticed there were a lot less people compared to the number that had left.
"Oh Merlin and Salazar, you are a beast." Harry answered him with a possessive hand around his abdomen, caressing at the heavily clothed skin. Soon after the said event had taken place, he had ordered for  proper robes for Draco, he disliked that flimsy pale blue gown which he had worn. He himself had taken to drag Draco to an empty room and change his robes, not before snogging him breathless and pulling at both of their lengths in a quick manner. He would have done it all the way, but he wanted the comfort of their bed and silk sheets, Draco looked brilliant panting and red faced atop of red sheets, his hair spread out and his lips all wet and shiny, which looked much more kissable than normal, under  the moonlight.
She wanted to cry at that moment, laying her head on Malfoy's bony shoulder she wanted to sob and plead her to stay with her. But she didn't. Even when Malfoy stood up, wincing and aching, her hand cupping her quim to feel the heat. "Thank you Potter." She said, Harry saw her back. "I think I should leave now."
"And he told you of the object where the 'Dark Lord' would have kept a part of his life?" Harry rolled his eyes when he said out the name. According to him the man wasn't any scary being, he was just an insolent child in a body of an old bastard. Draco nodded his head in reply.
Harry couldn't help her legs from moving and her arms to wrap around the thin waist, when she heard the first sniff of Malfoy's silent cries. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Draco." She kissed gently at the nape after pushing the blonde hair to one shoulder. "I'm so sorry. You weren't doing anything wrong, I promise." She rubbed soothingly at the quivering back as she whispered against her ear. "It's all my fault. I shouldn't have treated you that way." She gently turned Draco around, she almost winced when she saw her blotched face and teary eyes. She pried the gown away from the limp fingers and led Draco to the bed gently before sitting her down. Harry went down to her knees, dropping down to the floor, and carefully held one of Draco's feet. "I told you, you look like a goddess. I should worship you, not fuck you like an alleyway slut." She wrapped her mouth around the big toe painted in the perfect shade of ocean blue and relished in the way Draco shuddered and gasped her name out. She kissed her way up, kissing and nipping at the skin till she reached the uncovered moist mess her cunt was making. She forced herself not to smirk in delight of the sight and in one breath dived right in to lap at the slick.
"I'll get this cleaned up." He said as he walked to the armchair and called for a servant in a pretty casual voice, who hurried in an instant. Draco caught the eyes of the girl and realised that even though she had her will, she was still controlled by Him. Draco took in a deep breath and went to the bathroom after giving a nod to the Wizard.
I crossed my fingers and nodded my head. "I promise." Afterwards, after I had put Teddy to bed, I floocalled Pansy. I didn't give up even after half an hour. Eight minutes to nine, she answered, her short bob flaring around her in flames and her glare looked firey, both figuratively and literally. "Pansy." I greet her with a nervous smile.
His blonde hair was petted now. "I should have looked for better rings. But Draco dear, you truly did wound me when you had run away. Do you know how many people I had to kill and how many I had to spell on, just to find out where you were? Luckily your personal knight was kind enough to let me go through his memories. Poor man then has been sleeping ever since." Draco's eyes widened and pooled with tears but he stopped them from rolling down. "And now you have a life of a foreign man growing inside of you. That is quite a trouble now, we would have to get rid of it." He gasped and stepped back, a hand coming to place itself on the belly protectively. "But it would be hard to identify it, maybe we should let it grow a bit before we kill it, don't you think so as well, Draco?"
To say Ron was livid was an understatement, but Harry knew he was overreacting anyway. "Malfoy, Harry! Malfoy of all the people. She decides to let Rose go to
He scowled when he opened a cabinet and pulled out a bottle of Hufflepuff wine. He drank a few sips straight from the bottle as he sat himself on the bed. He expected a night with his husband, limbs tangled around him. Now he had to sleep alone, a cold night he had to endure.
"Yes. I'm aware." Draco snapped. The man looked at him in amusement instead. He stroke his long white beard and turned around. He started walker deeper into the library and Draco followed him. There was a slight creep of shiver which ran down his spine, but he made his back straight and walked further along, just a couple of steps behind the old man.
"Yes. But power is power." Draco looked back at him, his eyes narrowed. "And Slytherins love power. I don't wish to talk to you anymore." He dismissed his husband, and turned to the man he was holding onto. "My dear Dark Lord, shall we rest in our rooms? I feel my hormones tumbling again." The corpse like man replied to his request with a squeeze on his waist and a vocal affirmative. The wolf was told to lead them to the dungeons below, and the creature hurried to do the same.
That morning Draco took his first batch of the potion. It had to be taken twice on the chosen day. Draco had prepared extra so that he could take in more as a precautionary measure. When the brunch was going on he could feel his lower abdomen tighten and ache, but he had to pass it along with a smile as he made himself familiar with the other officials. He felt hot and cold at the same time, he hadn't eaten anything and he was sweating through his robes. By the time brunch was over and he saw Harry rush somewhere, he dashed to their rooms. As soon as he closed the door behind him he tore away his clothes. He could feel them wet with sweat, but his condition worsened. The room tilted for him, making him fall on the ground. He pulled at his remaining garments as he crawled to the edge of the bed. He saw a jug of water on the side table and he brought the rim to his mouth, drinking the cool liquid in huge gulpes, a large part of it spilling onto his body. It felt good, but it wasn't enough. He managed to get into the cotton covers taking large gulps of air. He had to tell Harry something and the guilt scratched at his heart, and then he fainted.
"Fucked you pretty good." Harry picked up the shirt from the floor which was fallen by the table and placed it on the pale shoulders. He pulled out the cloth from breast pocket and wiped at the bitten and bruised chest of the cum. "You should get dressed." He stood up before tucking himself in. He strode towards the table and picked up the gun, while Draco tried to gain his senses. "I'll be keeping this. You have a pretty bad habit of thrusting this onto my face." Harry slid it into the back of his trousers.
Draco nods, his eyes still closed. "I am." He felt a hand under his chin and a finger brushing his hair to the side.
"Tom, yes." Professor nodded his head. "But it isn't the name that you would want. His magic name differs, and he wouldn't disclose it to anyone. Anyone but...?"
I actually did write the first chapter because I wanted this chapter to take place. But I couldn't just write this out of nowhere now, could I?
"My sweet Draco. Why do you dirty your hands, when we can just let out a small curse." Hermione perked up at that, looking with anxiousness and an overwhelming feeling when a long stick was taken out from a holster at the Dark Lord's arm, it was long and straight. "Now, one by one, let's see each of them whither in pain." He pointed one end at Ginny and Hermione had to hold her breath.
"Yeah? How was the movie?" I asked as I slid his shirt down and spelled it to the laundry basket placed in the corner of the room.
"You came too? Do you know how dangerous this is!" He pulled a few leaves from her hair before he looked at Harry. "Harry, didn't you say anything to her?"
The Wizard cut him with a bark of laugh. "Oh but Draco- I wish to have you as well." He brought up his gloves hand to caress at the pale nape. This time Draco didn't move as he would have, a row of goosebumps ran down his back. "I want you to be mine. Be my partner, not that Gryffindor brat's. All the time in Slytherin, haven't I tried to court you with longing gazes and precious presents?"
Draco gulped loudly, his hands shaking a bit. He felt the note being taken from his hand. "what are all these birds?" He hears the authoritative voice say. "you're the dove, and your uncle is the owl. Who is crow? The Dark Lord?" Draco numbly nodded his head. He was shaken by his shoulder and was turned to face green eyes. "Draco.." he was called softly.
That helped. Because when I heard the floo roar downstairs in the living room, I was calm and quiet. I had just made myself out of the bath when Draco came in. I was greeted with a long kiss which tasted like buttered corn and tomatoes (Bloody Mary it was then!), I rolled my tongue against his palate, relishing when he moaned and grinded his hips against the towel I was wearing. "Oh Merlin! Harry!" I felt his arms wrap around my neck as he pulled me closer, and I wound mine around his hips. I frowned when he leaned back and licked his lips. "what an evening!" He said before chuckling. I unbuttoned the shirt he was wearing.
"I need time, my King. I'm going to bath now." He didn't give him a chance to speak when he rushed to the adjoined en suite. Harry flopped on the unmade bed ruffling his hair with his hand. He cursed himself a few times before standing up and calling a servant in. He whispered something to him and told him to hurry with the actions. The servant nodded and hurried out if the room.
"Heavens! You scared me!" Draco said, etching a smooth smile on his face. He made sure his hips swayed as he walked closer to the bed and turned on the table light next to the bed. The pale white skin looked so much translucent and wrinkly. "Why are you in dark?"
He shook his head. "Twenty five of them are missing. And ten are dead. Their bodies are still in the warehouse." We approached a large, creeky shed. It was still dusk, as we entered we couldn't see a single thing before casting a higher volume Lumos. And Ron was right, there were a lot many dead bodies. I casted a time spell as I realised that this had been done not an hour ago.
"Twice Malfoy. Twice." The older man sneered at him. "You're given a chance not once, but twice. And each time you came back without a report or any result."
Ron shot him a look, I just pinched my nose. "Yes. Immediately if possible." As he scurried away, I rubbed my face and then took in the haphazard condition of my friend. He wore a worn out robe and fuzzy slippers, his red Auror coat just slung around his shoulders. "you look ready to sleep."
He was replied with a hearty and hissy chuckle. "of course it can. I would just have to use my spell if they come way to close to us." The Wizard produced his long stick and showed it to Draco.
"This might have been a bad idea." She blindly grabbed the pillow and placed it in front of her chest. "Maybe I should go."
"For a while. But the killings have increased." Roberts didn't say anything more and when Draco looked up he saw that they were just outside his own office. "And I've paired you up."
"I always follow the words of my counselor. I agree with her." He was hoping the other would back out but his eyes widened when he saw the Prince jump down from his horse.
"We thought you were sleeping, but then Harry saw the state of the room and you were sweating profusely."
Harry provided him. "here. A pen." He held out a black pen. It was expensive, fountain head, and never let other customers touch it, but Malfoy was different. He needed special treatment.
"I mean that you wouldn't take any one to the bed, except for me. I realise I'm not well versed in the actions performed on the martial bed, but that doesn't mean you will go ahead and perform those with someone else. You took an oath to belong to me, and I would prefer you maintain that for at least half a decade."
Draco was breathing heavily, he was panting. When Harry leaned back to look at him, Draco's eyes were filled with need. Draco pounced on him, pushing him backwards till his back was digged by the edge of the desk he was just talking about. Draco didn't give him a moment to think, as he smashed his lip on his mouth- kissing with desperation and thirst. He bit on his lower lip, his tongue poked at his own and their teeth clanked against each others. Harry groaned when he felt his tongue getting bit and he pulled back. Draco only had a look of confusion on his face when he leaned forward, chasing his mouth. He pushed Harry back on the table and Harry was poked by pens and paper holders, which was not comfortable at all, but he let it go when he saw the pale man straddle him and removing his belt. He pushed his trousers down, threw them in a corner, and pale knees on the each side of the wide torso. He climbed up to the chest and thrust his hips out. The tip of his cock brushed at the heavy beard before it brushed against the lips. "Suck!" Draco said in a raspy voice.
The blond nodded his head. "I'll just have to owl them to the ministry." Ron told him to do so and left the room. An hour passed by in scribbles and paper rustles. Harry couldn't help but notice each time Malfoy bent down to pick something which fell or open the lower drawers or lean up on his toes to grab something from higher shelves and the way the whisps of his platinum hair would be pushed behind his ear repeatedly by his fingers or the way he would bite his lower lip while he thought he left someone from the list of people missing.
"Ron isn't wrong Harry." His counselor, Hermione, says. "Yet the idea of marrying him can benefit Gryffindor a lot. But tonight? That fast. And what about the rituals?"
Harry rolled his eyes, though he was smirking, he held the pale waist in a tight grip, tight enough to make the blonde whimper. "that would be 'sir' for you." He pulled him closer, rubbing his hard length against other's. "Understood?"
He bit his lip before speaking. His voice coming out choked and petulant. "It was an endeavour on Muggle plays."
Draco hated his father for his childhood decisions. For telling him that half-bloods were below him and wizards like the Weasley family were to be despised. To not show his emotions even when he felt them clawing at his heart. To call Muggle borns as mudbloods and spit at their souls. To worship Dark Lord and follow his every command. For taking his mark and to make Draco take his mark. For grinning when that evil man hugged him in front of everyone in the ashen ground, while everyone knew he was shuddering in disgust. For putting him and his mother through trials, while he himself had enjoyed his two year lavish stay in Azkaban.
"Shut up!" Draco was panting with fear and anger. "get out. Before I call the police on you. You were my friend, so I'm not. For Lord's sake get out!"
"Sir, a flute of champagne?" Harry immediately grabbed at the slender glass and smiled thankfully at the waiter that passed by him, the only person he might have genuinely smiled at tonight. He was tired by everyone approaching him for one thing or the other and the weight of the sheet in his pocket felt really heavy, even though he did this every year. Before anyone could approach him he rushed to the washrooms. He didn't want to meet anyone in their but he hadn't expected someone to be seated on the soft satin ottoman that the washroom had infront of the floor length mirror, at the end of the male stalls.
"Where were you?" Draco almost jumped out of his bones. He managed to let out a squeak when he turned around as he closed the door, the Dark Lord sat atop the bed in darkness, his red eyes glowing like that of a panther in prowl.
Just one finger in and Potter had found his prostrate. "I think I'll better fuck you." His pants were then kicked off along with his shoes. He honestly didn't know when that happened, but he opened his closed eyes and there were three fingers in him, widening and stretching him open, while sliding in and out at a constant pace. Draco had a hard time keeping up with what was happening, but he didn't care.
"It's fine. I made sure it was stevia and not sugar or honey." Ron looked at Malfoy as if he would have kissed him, resuming his feeding on the muffin. Harry groaned, stuffing his head in his arms, as he looked at them.
"I have to show something to you." They reach a basin of sort infront of a dirty and cracked mirror. The man then stood Draco infront of the mirror. "What do you see?"
"I have never... Never been so humiliated in all my life." His voice croaked out. "Even while the Dark Lord loomed around in the corridors of the castle, would peek into my rooms and glance at me in an extreme manner, while I tried to run away from his sight: even then, I wasn't so embarrassed as I have felt over here."
"You're just going to put me to bed." He rolled his eyes and lifted his arms to either sides. "Merde. Tu es une salope." I quickly unbuttoned his mid night blue shirt, and slipped it down his shoulders and then turned to his trousers. "An old one that too, who's a prude." He lifted his arse up so that I could slide down the pants.
"He's your husband, Harry. You both took vows. How can you doubt him? How can you not trust him?" It made me feel like it's my fault, I felt guilty. I cursed aloud.
