Harry was tracing the scar on his arm, and Draco winced at the memory of Harry’s earlier words. “You don’t have to do that if it bothers you.”
The chill was frightful, and Harry changed his mind after less than five minutes on the roof. The thought of staying in his flat with only his console for company was even more frightful, however, so he came up with a new plan as he scarfed down some leftover beef stew. There was an arcade he liked to visit near Camden Lock that had some great retro games, including one of his new guilty pleasures,
Fluff with a bit of snark (it moves the plot along too, I promise :P). A new character is introduced.
Harry couldn’t think of an ear joke to make, so he contented himself with swatting Draco dramatically away. “Back off, Malfoy, and let me drink my poison in peace.” He swallowed the potion with a shudder, as it tasted like death.
Harry’s reply was interrupted by a rising murmur from the crowd that had gradually materialized behind them. Craning his neck around to investigate the source, his heart dropped into his stomach when he saw Draco entering the room. He looked wan, but well-dressed as usual, with no sign of injury. To Harry’s relief, he did not appear to be handcuffed or shackled in any way, even after sitting down in the highly uncomfortable chair at the center of the room.
“You stay here, I’m going to get us some breakfast.” Draco pulled on a plush velvet robe and disappeared through the doorway to the landing. Harry was left to his musings about Draco’s Patronus, and the inklings of an idea that he wanted to share with Draco when he returned.
Draco was too tired to do anything but chuckle a little. Right now, he just wanted to bask in the sunlight of Harry’s presence, filtering through the quiet forest of their satiation. The music from downstairs faded into the distance as he dropped into sleep, with Harry’s arms wrapped around him.
Hermione’s reaction was swift and positive. “Oh Harry, that’s wonderful. Is it someone we both know, or is it someone you met in the Muggle world?”

Harry all but glared at Malfoy. “First of all, could you stop calling me Potter? We’re not in school any more, in case you hadn’t noticed. Besides, it sounds like you’re spitting out my name every time you say it.”
She chewed on her lip for a moment before telling him. “Well, it’s Ginny. She and Ron are having a bit of a row about her new relationship, something about keeping him out of the loop for too long. I guess she doesn’t take kindly to criticism these days.”
Draco met him at the center of the room, and it was as if their surroundings fell away, leaving only two minds, two heartbeats, two sets of eyes that drank each other in.
“Yeah, I know. Crazy that it’s survived this long, you have no idea what I got up to at Hogwarts with it.”
“Nigel Myles-Harkley – you haven’t heard of him? Of course you haven’t, you grew up with middle-class Muggles. His family is one of the newer Wizarding families who made their fortune in magic-assisted Muggle inventions. He went to Beauxbatons and summered in the south of France, which is why you probably never heard about him at Hogwarts.”
Harry appeared to be struggling with himself, but he eventually went with, “As long as you don’t leave my side, I think we can handle anything.”
Once he would have laughed at the idea of reconciling with the likes of Malfoy, but time had changed him. Time and the memory of testifying for Malfoy and his mother before the Wizengamot, in the wake of Voldemort’s demise. They had narrowly escaped imprisonment and settled for a temporary exile, if Harry remembered correctly.
Harry couldn’t help but be impressed. “Wow, that’s really… Wow. Not what I was expecting to hear.” He shifted a little in his seat. “Why are you telling me this, exactly?” The worried look on her face wouldn’t go away, and he was starting to feel alarmed. “Is it – is he okay?”
The next thing Harry knew, he was staggering on a rooftop with an unpleasant sensation on the left side of his head, which had been closest to the threat of impact. The unpleasantness quickly sharpened into pain, and Harry’s worst fear was confirmed when he touched one hand to the source of the pain and discovered that his ear was missing. With blood welling down the side of his face and his glasses hanging askew, he did the only thing he could reasonably think of doing in the moment, and that was to spell Hermione.
By silent, mutual agreement, they started undressing each other on the spot in the living room. Harry’s need for Draco’s touch was spectacular, and Draco’s need seemed no less, although he showed more restraint because of the injury. Harry’s fingers fluttered in anticipation as Draco finished removing his shirt and started undoing his trousers for him. He was wearing nothing underneath, and Draco felt the familiar uncoiling of arousal as he knelt before his lover and took him into his willing, hungry mouth.
It was well into November, and their days together had taken on a routine of sorts. Draco admitted to himself that he rather liked having Harry there, to provide warmth and meaning in an otherwise boring and empty life. The novelty of living as a Muggle libertine had started to wear off by now, and he had begun to count down the days to when he would be able to reclaim his full power as a Wizard again. If it weren’t for the periodic arguments, he might consider what he and Harry had to be almost perfect.
Harry would not be diverted. “I’m serious, I was not in a good place mentally a year ago. I still wonder if I should see a therapist again, give Hermione a break.”
“So Potter, tell me more about this business of leaving the Wizarding world behind.” Malfoy stirred his tea spoon laconically, but Harry picked up on some genuine interest behind the cool façade. “Surely the Boy Who Lived must miss being a celebrity.”
When Harry re-emerged with a couple of plates in hand, Draco had relocated himself to the second chair across from the couch, a fresh Felici-Fizz in hand. He waited until Harry had set down the plates before wordlessly holding out both bottles. Harry was clearly hesitant, but politeness won out and he opened them.
She nodded and passed the message on to Ron, who seemed thrilled at the idea of having Harry over. “What do you say, pour at four?” He lowered his voice a little when the people around them twitched in fright at the volume of his enthusiasm. “Just so you know, Ginny might be there too.”
“Look, I’m way out of my depth here. Can the two of you stop messing around and help me find something that actually works? I’m about ready to give up, honestly, and I haven’t tried but the one shirt on.”
That drew a laugh from Harry, and to Draco’s relief, he agreed. “Yes, you’re a right peacock, you are. Is it – “ he seemed to have trouble getting his words out – “are you really that nervous about telling your mother beforehand? I mean, I understand about not wanting to risk losing everything. But what if doing the interview and going to the ball together has the same effect? Wouldn’t that make it all pointless?”
Draco threw her a withering look. “That was my father, not me. I can still be around Wizarding folk at Wizarding events, I just can’t do anything remotely magical unless I’m at home.”
This Draco was not neatly dressed or impeccably groomed, but wore a pale grey silk bathrobe and his hair swept sideways at a decidedly rakish angle. The color in his cheeks and lips gave Harry a clue as to what he might have been pursuing moments before, and a wave of crimson heat crashed over Harry as he looked at Draco, stunned into silence.
Harry was almost gleeful in his response. “Brilliant. Let me just take care of a few things before we head out.”
Hermione had recovered with the help of a hanky and eagerly jumped back into the conversation. “Oooh, really? What was her reaction, did she mention anything about the latest gossip coming out in the papers?”
Harry was not prepared for the onslaught of luxury that was Harrod’s. It called to mind his first visit to Diagon Alley, as a fledgling Wizard with little idea of what lay in store for him. Abundance lay everywhere, and without Draco’s guiding eye, he would have turned around and fled, or drowned in it.
“Hiya Harry,” she greeted him, and he was pleased to note that the circles under her eyes seemed to be less dark, although she still appeared pale and wan to him. The workload this year had not been kind to her. “I hope I’m not interrupting anything.”
Draco’s head vanished before Harry could question him, and Harry was reduced to feeling foolish as he put each clothing item on and struck a cheesy pose before the mirror. It was almost as bad as the photo shoot he had endured during the one interview he’d done with Witch Weekly. But Draco was true to his word – by time Harry had finished trying everything on, Draco brought him a smaller selection and removed some of Harry’s rejects.
Draco felt only a little pleased with himself. “What about the shape though, shouldn’t it be turning into an animal form? Or do I need to be under duress for that to happen?”
“Good Godric, Potter, what kind of a clothing selection is this?” Draco held out one shirt like it was something a Kneazle had dragged in, then sniffed at it unselfconsciously. “At least it doesn’t smell as bad as it looks.”
Hermione did not react in any way that he’d dreaded. Instead of showing shock or concern, or – Helga forbid – disgust, she clapped her hands together and uttered a soft shriek. “Harry! I knew it would happen, I knew it!”
Draco couldn’t say no, not while Harry was looking at him like that, like he’d discovered new treasure.
“Oh come off it, it didn’t affect you that much, did it? This drink’s different, it’s more for energy but without some of the nastier side effects of caffeine. Don’t ask me to say the name though, I have no idea how to pronounce it.”
Draco made a shushing gesture. “Now now, we’ll have none of that. First we find what makes you look best, then we talk pricing. Clerks can be – flexible.”
You will notice right away that Draco is called by a different surname, which will be explained in a later chapter, although the reason may become obvious as we go along. Also, not surprisingly, Draco has attitude problems.
Nigel titched, stepped back a little and admired his handiwork. “Any handsome friend of Draco’s deserves a little extra attention. Oh yes, I think we did very well. The green cardigan complements your eyes perfectly.” His gaze swept lower, until he reached Harry’s feet. “Where on earth did you get those socks?”
Draco seemed to have other ideas, however, clinched by the Draught of Peace he finally brewed for Harry. It didn’t seem to set off any misuse of magic alarms, since the making of the potion did not require any magical activity in itself once the ingredients were assembled. The last memory that Harry had of this very strange and exhausting night was of Draco’s arm wrapped around him from behind, as they lay spooning in bed on the side that favored Harry’s good ear. “Good night, love,” Harry thought he heard him say, but he might have imagined it.
Harry acquiesced and led her to the bedroom, where he started rummaging through one of his dresser drawers for the map. She insisted that he lie down after removing further layers of clothing and let her do the searching, which she finished promptly by saying “Accio Marauder’s Map.” Harry felt stupid for not remembering the charm, and wondered aloud if it might work for retrieving his ear, but she reminded him that it did not work on people, animals, or body parts. “Let me see if I have anything in my bag that I can brew for the pain while I check the map. Do you have a copy of a map of London lying around, by chance?”
Harry followed his trajectory, wrapping one leg possessively around Draco’s as he took himself back in hand and increased the pressure and speed of his strokes. Draco, swiftly coming to, pushed Harry’s hand away so he could bend down and resume working on Harry with his mouth, and this time, Harry was ready to let go. With gusto. The sounds that came forth from his throat were involuntary, as he poured out every last drop of pent-up lust into Draco’s throat, but Harry was too carried away to be embarrassed in the moment.
.” His final word was accompanied by a gesture that caused Draco to close his eyes and curl his toes a little. He decided to shut up about threesomes and let Harry have his way instead.
They lapsed into silence, sipping at their respective drinks. Harry looked sideways at Ginny and was struck again by how sophisticated she looked, despite being a year younger. He had to remind himself that they were all young still, even as they had been aged in spirit by the travails they had gone through.
Draco snorted. “Witch Weekly? Fuck that rubbish, if we’re granting any interviews, it’s going to be to the Daily Prophet. As for the match, I love Quidditch but I’d rather make our debut at an event where I can dress to the bloody nines.”
Draco didn’t ask him to elaborate. “To answer your other question, I’m not sure who set up the display, but I can certainly find out for you.” He turned away but was cut short by Potter’s hand on his arm.
PS – I couldn’t resist dropping in one more tidbit of research. “Afterfeathers” is a term in ornithology, and according to Avian Report.com’s Guide to Bird Feathers: “The primary function of the afterfeather is to enhance insulation. The Ptarmigans exhibit a variation in the length of the afterfeather in their summer and winter plumages. They have longer afterfeathers in the winter plumage and shorter and less complex ones in the summer plumage when insulation is not vital to the bird.” It seemed appropriate, given the cyclical nature of this story and the relationship between Harry and Draco. :)
“I can’t even begin to imagine how he got that to work, it must have taken a lot of preparation and forethought.” Hermione’s tone was almost admiring, before she realized how she sounded and blushed. “In any case, it was not Draco’s doing, he just happened to be the trigger.” She frowned. “It seems that he did set off a misuse of magic alert somehow, but he won’t share what spell he tried to use.”
Draco seemed to be in a similar condition, and pounced on Harry at the end of the bed as soon as he had landed. “Enough of this,” he growled at him as he went about the serious business of pulling off Harry’s shirt and trousers, all while kissing a line along his collarbone, and ending with a possessive bite to his shoulder. “You have the weirdest imagination, I swear, but that little trick was really – “
Forty-five minutes later, impeccably dressed and only slightly late, Draco emerged from the Tube station and began the usual slog to his place of work. It was ironic that of all the places he might have chosen, he ended up a with a bookshop in Soho run by Wizarding folk with aspirations of promoting unity between Muggles and non-Muggles. The terms of the immersion contract were broad enough that he probably could have finessed his way into something more prestigious, like a law firm or a banking establishment. But the thought of working with people – Muggles – who consistently thought they were better than him was too much for him to stomach. Better to stick to a place where he could still maintain a smidgeon of self-respect, with a boss who was a Wizard. An elderly nutter of a Wizard, but still a person of magical means.
Draco had nothing to say to that, although he was clearly put out. Harry brewed a pot of tea during the conversational gap, thinking that they could both use a cup of something warm to drink. And who knew, tea might melt Draco’s chilly disposition for the moment.
, but Draco settled back in his chair and closed his eyes for a moment, resting his fingers on his temples.
Besides the money, what was there to fear? He tried to picture his mother standing before him, hearing for the first time that he and Harry were lovers, and he couldn’t envision what her reaction might be. It was entirely possible that he might be overreacting, and as he talked it out with his therapist, he started to wonder if his fear about his mother was really just a manifestation of his own inner demons, rather than an accurate reflection of reality. If so, they held some serious power over him, raising their voices in cacophony until he felt nauseated to the core. Envisioning his father was no better, bringing forth on top of the nausea a feeling of self-disgust and disappointment at his failure to live up to his father’s standards. If he wasn’t able to do right by them even now, then it wasn’t worth showing an ounce of vulnerability to them.
Draco turned over to look at him, his mouth serious but his eyes playful. “Not until I’ve finished having my way with you,” he teased. “But I think we’ve reached our limit on this experiment of ours for today.”
dunce, and I can live with that.” Their kiss was sweet and promised more to come once they reached the privacy of Draco’s home.
“Where’s Draco and what have you done with him?” Harry muttered after Ginny had disappeared into the ladies changing rooms. He sidled up to his paramour and gave him what he thought was a debonair grin, but Draco took little notice. “I’m just saying, you’re really channeling Nigel right now. Speaking of, where is Nigel? Shouldn’t he be swooping in and giving out his opinion left, right and center?”
Normally, Harry would have wondered what exactly she meant and probed further, but he was too distracted to care. He strode over to the cluster of Witches. “Er, sorry to interrupt, but are we all set for a plan to get Ginny to safety? I’ve just got word from St. Mungo’s that Draco is awake and wants to see me, so…” He waved the coin at them awkwardly.
Instead of questioning the fact that he could now taste the atmosphere and see the sounds of music spiraling through the Wizarding radio, he felt overcome by an urge to slide down a bannister. Funnily enough, there was one in the hallway, presided over by the floating chandelier that had captivated his attention on that night not so long ago, when Nigel had paved the way to Draco.
Harry was about to launch into the story of Mrs. Weasley’s endless knitting when Draco entered the room, hoisting a large platter of finger foods that included a plate each of shrimp and oysters. “I went with a seafood theme tonight, hope that’s all right for you both.”
Harry groaned and slumped back under the covers until only the tips of his hair and fingers were visible. “I just wish it were over and done with.” He reemerged a few moments later. “D’you know, this will be the first time I’ve willingly shown my face since the whole breaking up with Ginny debacle? I can’t even remember the last photo of me that appeared in the papers, I think I might have been plastered.”
Draco was awake, if begrudging his wakefulness. “I wouldn’t know, I never learned how to produce one.”
Draco did not look as well-slept as Harry felt, which somehow made him look even more alluring, jellybeans notwithstanding. He didn’t seem to mind the kiss that Harry offered, and they spent a pleasant couple of minutes pressed up against each other before Harry remembered. “Bloody hell, what time is it? I have to spell Hermione.”
“Honestly, I got tired of all that open space. Feels less alone, being in the city, yet it’s easy to lose myself when I want to.”
He couldn’t help but chuckle in disbelief at his lame joke and Draco’s reaction, as delightful as it had been. Where had that impulse come from? Kissing aside, the real question on Harry’s mind was, did Draco view Harry as just another friend with side benefits? Or did he have different, more inscrutable designs on him?
The time was late, but Harry was able to get dressed and start cooking by ten-thirty. He spelled Hermione from the kitchen while Draco was taking a shower, after gingerly removing the gauze bandage from his head.
he thought – then was overcome with moans of pleasure as Draco picked up the pace, somehow still maintaining eye contact throughout. Eagerly, as if he wanted Harry as close to his Adam’s apple as possible, he devoured him, until Harry could feel the tingle of impending orgasm. “Agh – no – not yet, I want to see you come first.”
“Where is that? Here as in your brother’s home after a shite day, or here as in the fact that you’re now getting just as much media attention as me, if not more?”
They could, and they did. The morning finished in a torrid haze, and they eventually collapsed onto the bed with their clothing mostly undone and Draco’s newly conjured glasses askew on his nose. The tie was long gone.
At that moment, the Boy Who Lived was trying his very best not to die. Metaphorically, of course. His days of living dangerously were over, at least for now, and he could probably count on one hand the number of times he had engaged in anything that might be mistaken as risky in the past year.
Draco obliged. It felt kind of nice, being waited on hand and foot by the Boy Who Lived. Or at least, the Boy Who Had Lived and Now Hid. For the first time, he wondered whether Harry was single.
“Why don’t the two of you get better acquainted while I gather the noshables. Nigel, can you get Harry something to drink?” Draco asked as he left for the kitchen.
She smiled at him. “Well, all right. As long as you’re both on board with it.” She sighed and steepled her hands before continuing. “I think the first thing to consider is, how do you want to frame your change of heart? For example, is Draco coming from a place of curiosity and open-mindedness, after enrolling in a Muggle immersion program? Or is he coming from a place of wanting to make amends, after being so horrible to you for the past ten years? It can be a combination of both, but I think it’s important to delineate each and every point so that there can be no misunderstanding. Otherwise, in the eyes of the general public, he’s just a former Death Eater cozying up to the enemy, so he can save face for his traditionally-minded family.”
Harry wanted to tell him, but contented himself with holding Draco’s hand while they sat in the train car.
“Right – sorry, I didn’t mean to rub it in. But really, I would have thought – you weren’t ever curious to find out what form your Patronus might take?”
Consider the itch well scratched. But he couldn’t help thinking to himself, as he sat in the kitchen with his habitual morning mug of Earl Grey, that there had to be more to life than this. More than living in a well-appointed townhouse paid for by his family’s fortune, surrounded by any form of entertainment he desired. More than working occasional afternoon shifts at a Wizard-owned bookshop that pandered to Muggles, which was part of his contract during his immersion experience. More than visiting with his Muggle therapist twice a week, who somehow seemed to be convinced that their sessions were having an effect.
Hermione shook her head. “That shouldn’t make a difference, the wards should guard against Muggle weapons and unarmed Wizards as well.” She twisted her hands together in frustration. “Sometimes I wish I’d gone further with Comparative Muggle-Wizard Studies.”
“I can’t believe you like that rubbish. If you have to do it at all, why not go with George’s new venture instead and get involved in virtual Wizarding games?”
Harry was still gathering himself together, but Hermione seemed to be less on guard than before, if begrudgingly. “Why don’t I talk to Ron about it, maybe we can have the two of you over for dinner. Discreetly, of course.” Her expression was softened by the tears she had shared with Harry, and Draco felt that he might have been rather harder on her than necessary.
Draco shrugged and handed the blazer to him. It was lightweight yet warm to the touch and smelled vaguely of a spicy cologne, Harry couldn’t help noticing as he scurried through the bedroom to hang it up. The setting sunlight had abandoned the bedroom by now, forcing Harry to switch on the light as he entered and exited the closet.
Back out in the world, relieved to be free of the crowds of gawking people and bothersome reporters hounding him for a new angle on the Draco Malfoy story, Harry Apparated home. In a fit of self-disgust, he had a good tidy and managed to get the flat in relatively presentable order by mid-afternoon, before packing himself a small bag to take to Ron’s. They worked out a Portkey in no time, and before Harry could succumb to the temptation to spell Draco – or worse, his mother – he arrived on the front step of the cottage.
Draco all but rolled his eyes and flung himself onto the couch across from Harry. Well, not so much flung, as gracefully plopped. Harry was intrigued by what he had done with his hair, which was long but not overmuch, and gently waved so that it fell evenly and softened the sharper angles of his face. If it weren’t for the attitude, he almost looked like he could be in a painting himself.
“There’s a Christmas Ball for Ministry employees and guests coming up, maybe I can introduce you then. Will we see you and Harry there?” Ginny asked him, with a cocked eyebrow.
It was a sign of Harry’s faith in her abilities that he agreed to go along with her suggestion. Ginny hesitated, but Harry was eventually able to talk her around, insisting that it would be safer to work out a plan from inside the Ministry complex than from a limousine that only concealed its occupants from Muggles.
“Ugh, fine. We don’t have to take Nigel out for dinner, but I do insist on inviting him over to my place. With you there. We owe him that much.”
Potter looked down at his hands, then directly into Draco’s eyes. Draco found an unexpected sadness there, and turned away to order another drink. “Can I get you anything, Potter?”
She Disapparated after shrugging back into her coat, leaving the two of them shell-shocked. “Did that – “ Harry began.
Harry picked up his coat from the back of the chair and slung it over one arm. “Home.” Seeing Draco’s growing alarm, he gently added, “Surely you don’t think you’ve recovered enough to leave St. Mungo’s yet, do you?” He sighed. “Besides, I doubt the Ministry will let you go anywhere, they probably think you’re a flight risk.”
Harry was frozen, lips responding but hands limp at his sides, as if they’d forgotten where they could go. Draco grabbed them with a hiss of impatience and placed them on his hips, leaning into Harry with as much weight as he could manage without crashing into the wall behind. Harry’s hands had finally come to life, and Draco could feel a moan of relief bubbling to the surface as he relaxed into the familiarity of it. Godric, he would miss this.
Draco did not seem convinced. “We are here for your aesthetic improvement, not for some fangirl distraction.” He steered Harry toward the clerk guarding the men’s dressing rooms. “We don’t have a moment to waste.”
But Draco didn’t seem to be bothered by it, in fact he was looking Harry up and down with a new level of interest, like he was a particularly delicious specimen of crème brulée.
Remembering his parents and society’s general expectations for him, his thoughts turned in a more pragmatic direction.
Draco had hoped he wouldn’t bring that up either, but Harry was like a Crup with a bone once he got going. “Well, you know my father was in Azkaban for a little while, right?” He skipped over the part where Voldemort had broken him out of prison and made his life a living hell, and tried to express himself as neutrally as possible. “He never quite managed to rebuild his life once the Dark Lord was vanquished, although Mother did her best. I still haven’t seen him since he left.”
They rode the rest of the way in chilly silence, with Draco taking sips from a tiny bottle of Ogdens out of the mini-bar as they got closer. Harry finally put out a restraining hand when he emptied it and reached for another. “Careful there, I don’t want you sozzled before we even get inside. There will be plenty of drinks, trust me.”
Under normal circumstances, Draco would have laughed at the name. But tonight was not normal by any stretch of the imagination. Not for him.
Friday night, with Harry tucked into bed and a Draught of Peace down him, Draco bit the bullet and spelled Hermione through his fireplace in the den. She answered in a distracted sort of way, looking over her shoulder at a scene that was unfolding out of sight. “Sorry Draco, let me get to a place that’s more quiet.” She walked through a dark hallway and Lumosed the light on with a sigh. “That’s better.”
Harry, on the other hand, seemed determined to tune them out. “Draco, I’m not sure this is a good idea. I tried Z once, and I don’t think it ended well.” He thought for a moment. “Honestly, I don’t even remember how it ended, which is even worse.” His hand tightened around Draco’s, and Draco kissed it the way he liked it, with just a little bite to the knuckle. “Don’t worry, Harry, we’re not going to force you to do anything you don’t want to. But I’m curious to find out how Z affects me - don’t you want to find out too?” He gestured toward the women with his free hand. “Not to mention what it does for these two?”
Harry did not have a response for that, and so they walked in companionable silence the rest of the way to the Tube station before parting.
And now for a little shameless plugging, since I am apparently still possessed by the impulse to write fanfic. My next story is set during the Marauders era with a little teen Wolfstar thrown in, so we probably won’t be seeing too much of Draco or Harry, but I plan to start posting chapters soon. See you there, if that’s your cuppa!
Harry wanted nothing more than to hold Draco in his arms, but the closed-off look on Draco’s face prevented him. “Can I get you anything? Some water, or a tisane?”
She nodded, made a note, and fixed him again with her gaze. “And do you feel that you yourself are not one of them?”
Malfoy chuckled, a sound almost as foreign to Harry’s ears as the sound of his name. “I have to hand it to you, Potter, you do surprise me sometimes.” He stopped chuckling at Harry’s look. “Sorry. Harry. I thought you loved getting all that attention, being you. And a Gryffindor.”
Harry sniffled and wiped one sleeve across his nose. “No, I’m sorry. I don’t know why you set me off like that, I’m not normally this way.”
Once the conversation had ended, however, Draco dropped his head into his hands and stayed there a while, slumped before the fireplace in his London townhouse. He now spent a fair amount of time in London, returning to the Manor only when his parents invited him over for a meal or social function a few times a week. The bulk of his time now was spent doing research at various institutions, particularly St. Mungo’s. He did not know how far his interests in alchemy, runes, potions, and Muggle medical history would take him, but he had not yet lost his drive for learning as much as possible, with the eventual goal of disseminating his discoveries throughout the world. It was as if he wanted to erase all the misdeeds of the Malfoy bloodline, by doing as much as he could for the human species as a whole.
Trouble was, it all took so much effort. Effort better spent on doing good, on ensuring that the future that Dumbledore had died for, that Fred Weasley had died for, that Sirius, and Lupin, and Tonks, and Harry himself had died for, remained a hopeful one. He had thought and rethought over his last words to Draco that dreadful afternoon in the hallway, and had come to the conclusion that he was wrong. Really, he would never be done with hope. It was just the attachment to a particular type of outcome that had proved to be problematic.
Feeling irritated but curious, Draco pressed on. “Why would I need one? What do you do with it, anyway?”
Draco wiped away imaginary tears and paused enough to draw breath. “Oh, I’ve picked one out already. I’ve been using it ever since I started this Muggle immersion program, although I tend to go by Draco anyway, like it’s a nickname.”
“Oh for Merlin’s sake.” Harry snatched up a bottle and closed one fist over the top. There were not many occasions for it now, but the bottle-opening charm had stayed with him from his wilder days. It really drove home for him how helpless Draco must feel, not to be able to exert even the simplest magic outside of his home.
Brandon laughed at him, without malice. “Glad we have that cleared up, Harry. Are you doing all right with your drink, or should we get you something a little less strong for the road?”
Draco’s imagination went all sorts of ways, and he suspected Harry’s had too. The reminder that Harry had a life that was very different from Draco’s was a thorn in his side, and he wasn’t sure he had grown enough to accept the sting.
“Well, Harry – “ accompanied by an arm flung chummily over one shoulder – “what do you say to having a drink?”
“Like now?” Draco’s fingers tightened around Harry’s, and he leaned in to breathe deeply from the place on Harry’s neck nestled between ear and jawbone, brushing his long eyelashes across Harry’s skin in the process. Far from feeling ticklish, Harry felt the now-familiar ache blooming below his ribcage, that he had learned to associate with Draco and his damnable magnetism.
Besides exploring a different area of London (The Black Cap pub is unfortunately out of business, although The World’s End and The Underworld are still very much in business, pandemic hurdles aside), this chapter felt like an excuse for me to explore Harry’s and Draco’s personas by opposites. Why wouldn’t Harry fall apart after isolating himself for too long and start drinking and flirting to cope, while Draco chooses to stay at home cleaning and waiting around for Harry before launching into nurturing mode?
“All right Harry, you’ve put up with our drinking long enough.” Ginny turned a mischievous eye upon him as he sat in a chair nursing the unpronounceable soda from South America. “What does everyone think, should we try the Z?”
had he been thinking, to invite his former arch-nemesis over to his tiny flat and cook him dinner? He considered calling Draco to cancel the plan, but his Gryffindor pride wouldn’t let him do it. He had to prove to Draco that reconciliation was possible, after all they had been through at Hogwarts and Malfoy Manor.
Alone at last, Harry found himself fidgeting with the now useless Protean coin. Pulling himself together, he stepped forward and sat on one side of the bed after the briefest inner flicker of hesitation. “Drakes.” He stretched out one hand to meet with Draco’s, lying on the coverlet. “Are you all right? Did they get you all patched up?”
Draco saw what she meant when they entered the living room, after depositing their outer layers in the tiny coatroom. One side was arranged neatly in front of the fireplace, with furniture in tasteful tones of earth and beige and a watercolor seascape on the wall above the couch. The other side was a riot of color, largely featuring orange and yellow, and centered upon a table strewn with various Quidditch-related paraphernalia. “Ron’s workspace,” Hermione explained, before raising her voice to inform Ron that their guests had arrived.
“Hiya Harry.” Ron appeared in the row behind them and plopped himself down in an empty seat. “Sorry I’m late, I had to walk Ginny through some last-minute stuff.” He looked around cautiously and leaned in to whisper, “She’s having a bit of a meltdown, to be honest.”
Inside, the space was vast and glowing, decorated sparingly with fairy lights and snow sculptures. The area for dancing boasted a midnight blue stone floor, which twinkled like the night sky in time to whatever music was playing. Harry covered up his nerves by immediately heading to the bar to get something for Draco, while Draco stayed in place, surveying the magnificent array of people before him. Most of them he did not know, but he thought he recognized a few familiar faces here and there.
Much to his surprise, Harry felt a flicker of the old Seeker curiosity coming to life, at the thought of getting to know Malfoy better. When the feeling didn’t go away after a minute or two, he started walking home, and by time he reached the stairs to his flat, his mind was made up. He would go back to the bookshop again the following day, and ask Malfoy if he’d be interested in going anywhere together, to catch up properly.
“Not unless you want to look like a sixteenth-century gallant.” Nigel couldn’t seem to resist bantering, and Harry was irritated with it.
That was Harry’s cue to make a hasty retreat back to the place where he should have been all along, in the den. The image of Draco on the bed was burned across his brain, and Harry didn’t know whether to laugh out loud or claw his eyes from his skull. The urge to laughter came from the sheer cognitive dissonance of seeing how much his image Draco had changed since the time of their schoolboy rivalry, and the eye-clawing, well – he didn’t know where that impulse came from. New information overload, perhaps. He was also bewildered to realize that the sight had sent his nerve ends tingling in all manner of unexpected places.
Before he could voice any of his concerns, Draco nudged Harry none too gently toward the table behind, until he was sitting squarely on its surface. Wedged between Harry’s legs, he leaned over him to lay a wide circle of kisses about his neck, cheekbones, eyebrows, and nose. “Great mother of Godric, Harry, I want you so much.” The circling continued, and Harry was starting to feel dizzy from Draco’s fevered attentions, his already on-edge nerve endings set aflame. “I want you just for myself, and I also want to show the world what you mean to me.” His eyes were open as he cupped Harry’s face and stared him down. “But I want to do it on my terms, not my family’s.” He raked his gaze across Harry as if he were mentally undressing him. “I hope you can understand that at least.”
Harry finally gave up and let them drag him to the checkout counter, where the clerk watched in amusement as Draco paid with what looked like a silver credit card and Nigel lovingly wrapped each item in tissue paper before depositing it in a Harrods bag. The feeling of sunshine on Harry’s face had never felt sweeter when he exited the store.
“Harry, Harry, over here!” One voice stood out from the crowd, and Harry paused to look around and identify who it was. A security guard opened the barrier and let someone in, dressed in gauzy pink robes and a glittering tiara. As she approached, Draco recognized her and hesitated to greet her, considering the circumstances of their last meeting.
“That’s it, you’ve got the beginnings of it,” Harry encouraged him. “Try it one more time.” He took Draco’s other hand to hold, and they faced the couch together.
,” he jerked out with a groan at the end, tensing up for several seconds before collapsing back onto the bedcovers.
“Harry!” Hermione rushed forward and gave him a halfway hug as he rose awkwardly from the couch. “I came as soon as I could.” Seeing him looking sideways at her companion, she added, “This is Lucy Hawken, she’s a recent addition to the Auror team.” When Harry still looked shifty, she reassured him, “She specializes in cases involving stalking, harassment or blackmail, among other things, and she’s going to be helping us with getting Ginny to a safe house.”
Belatedly, he remembered that Draco preferred shoes off, and removed them in a panic as he scurried past the shoe rack into the den. He had barely enough time to arrange himself on the couch when Draco appeared at the bottom of the stairs, still slightly rumpled but at least dressed. Nigel was not far behind him.
Trust him? Draco had not been inclined to trust Harry – well, ever - but tonight, with two Felici-Fizzes in him and a pleasant hum of anticipation in his chest at the thought of flying again, he couldn’t exactly say no. “Sure, why not. Let’s give it a go.”
“Hello, hello.” Nigel’s eye swept Harry from head to toe, then back up again to scrutinize the fit of his shirt in a professional manner. Or at least, Harry hoped it was professional, and not just gratuitous gawking.
Speaking of thirst… Draco tapped the tea caddy at his elbow, which opened up and displayed a colorful array of flavors and herbs. “Astragalus and peppermint,” he uttered, and a teabag appeared in his mug. Potter took the hint and voiced his own preference – “chamomile” – before they subsided into awkward silence and sipping.
“You found it.” Draco had reemerged from his bath and stood behind Harry, wrapped in nothing but luxuriously fluffy towels around waist and shoulders. He looked almost gaunt with his hair still wet, the cut of his cheekbones more prominent than ever, but Harry was too elated with his discovery to notice. “Feel familiar?”
They ended the session after Draco had succumbed to the nausea and retched a few times into an empty rubbish bin. She sent him off with a pat on the back and a cool glass of water, and Draco found himself wiping away sweat in the hallway as he left. He hated it when his own body betrayed him, and he longed to put his troubled history with his family behind him. But the time was not ripe, not yet.
The Chief Warlock fixed him with a stare over glasses worthy of Dumbledore. “The intentions cannot be proven, but the actions can. The fact that you appear to have successfully cast the Killing Curse without a wand is cause for concern.”
“Looking for anyone?” The speaker was a heavily beglittered individual of indeterminate sex, and Harry felt himself blushing at the way the stranger looked at him. “Or have you found yourself yet?”
He didn’t want it to end, but time was pitifully short, and so he stopped, steadying himself by placing a hand on either shoulder and looking Harry dead-on. “I’ve missed you too. But I – “ sweet Salazar, this was going to take everything he’d got – “I can’t carry on with you, I’ve got to think of my family now.”
Harry’s hand drew away and touched his lips, still wet from Draco’s attention. “I – I’d better go. When can I see you again?”
Draco pushed up his blindfold and lifted himself onto his elbows. “It’s pretty simple, just do what I did earlier with my finger, then add a couple more fingers and finish with your cock.” He smiled at Harry’s uncertainty. “Don’t worry, I keep things very clean down there. As long as you keep the lubrication coming, I’ll get off in no time. And you probably will too.”
They were spared answering by the band striking up a boisterous tune that invited dancing. “Come on, Harry, let’s go mingle a little.” Draco was only too glad to lead him away from Ginny, who was looking Draco up and down like she wanted to eat him alive, or at least nibble on a few choice bits. If Draco hadn’t been so fully settled into his gay identity, and if she wasn’t a Weasley, he might have been interested.
Draco left them to their decorating schemes, and sought out the coatrack in the break room. Thank goodness the holidays were not upon them yet, otherwise he would be forced to participate more in the upkeep of the store. Autumn was a few weeks away, and he could still afford to exert the minimum amount of effort at his workplace as the hordes of summer tourists slowed to a trickle. Be that as it may, the day was surprisingly chilly, and he had chosen to wear a light form-fitting jacket in distressed denim that had drawn many admiring glances on the way in. Or maybe they were admiring him in it. Not that he cared just then.
Draco noticed his not-too-subtle attempt at changing the subject, and let it pass for the time being, despite his growing irritation toward Harry. Why, after bothering him about it for so long, and introducing him to his closest friends, was he so reluctant to be seen in the public eye with Draco? There was, of course, the delicate question of Draco’s mother, and whether she was ready to learn that her son was dallying with his former arch-nemesis from school. As long as Draco didn’t have to tell her personally, he didn’t so much mind the idea of her reading about it in the papers. Kept it at an emotional distance, until he felt ready to confront her.
“Stop it.” Harry smiled at the innuendo, but he was beginning to feel deeply tired. “I think it turns that way because of my dad. He was an Animagus, you know.”
Stunned, Harry could do nothing but listen as they explained the intricacies of what happened. It seemed that the attacker was once a Ministry employee and had been working an ancient, illegal curse on the grounds surrounding the Ministry buildings, that caused any protection spells cast upon it to disintegrate over a period of time. It wasn’t clear whether he had originally intended to work the curse for Ginny and for that night specifically, but the protective wards had weakened enough that he was able to Apparate himself onto the red carpet and draw his weapon on Ginny. What he hadn’t counted on was Harry being there and removing them both before she could be harmed. Draco’s interaction with him had only slightly delayed his ultimate goal, which was to trigger a built-in Killing Curse once the gun was shot.
Meanwhile, Harry didn’t know what to do with the exquisite new clothes they had sent home with him. He settled for hanging them in a special place in his closet, and admired them as he changed into something more comfortable.
The cacophony that greeted them was overwhelming, and it was all they could do to keep from turning around and diving back into the car. Every Wizarding reporter in London had a question for them, it seemed, and each question was accompanied by a frenzy of flashes, as the attendant photographers snapped away. Draco thanked his ancestors that there were barriers lined on either side of the red carpet, so that their way forward was relatively unimpeded. The sight of the Ministry building looming ahead had never seemed so welcoming.
Harry managed a shaky grin. “You wish. I’m home now, just having a spa day in my shower. Care to join me?” Too late, he remembered that Hermione could show up at any moment. He also remembered that he really missed Draco.
Draco followed him back out into the hallway, weaving a little and sniggering at him. “What are you going to do, go starkers?” Harry had already removed several layers earlier, but he left his pants and a T-shirt on, less out of modesty and more for a need of something to lessen the friction while sliding down said bannister.
“Thanks, Hermione.” Harry went in for a hug, which she returned warmly. “Sorry about all that, and sorry it took me so long to tell you. He’s not a bad sort, really he isn’t.”
To his therapist’s credit, she took it in stride at their next session and allowed him to abuse several of her couch cushions before suggesting that he try talking about it instead.
He immediately stepped forward to silence Harry with a kiss, pouring all of his pent-up frustration from the past few weeks into this moment. He knew they didn’t have long, and with his anger temporarily swept aside, this was the best way he could think of to soften the blow for Harry.
Draco took a stance and breathed in slowly and deliberately. Stretching his hand out toward the opposite wall, he imagined his father’s face looking down on him with love instead of disappointment. He imagined being embraced by his mother, and felt a spark of warmth awaken in his chest. And he imagined Harry’s eyes looking at him with open admiration.
Hermione was sprawled on the ground with her bag tipped over and the contents spilled. She was conscious and unhurt, as far as he could tell, but the horrified expression on her face made it seem as if she had suffered a serious injury. Pinned against the door, which was hanging half off the hinges, was Draco Malfoy, who appeared to be unconscious.
This a short one, centered around a conversation between Harry, Hermione, and Draco. Brief profanity and makeup sex. Draco is very emphatic about his gayhood.
Harry’s expression was mischievous, and Draco wondered whether he’d overdone it with the Felici-Fizz. Who knew how it affected these foolhardy Gryffindor types? But that ship had sailed already, so he might as well find out where it was headed.
Harry felt relief mixed with frustration at the cryptic lack of detail. “I don’t know why I listened to the Mediwizard, I should have gone to the hospital straight away, press be damned.” He ran one hand distractedly through his hair, which seemed to have gone back to its usual unruly ways. “D’you think you could help me get in, if I get my Invisibility Cloak?”
Draco leaned back, smiling. “Ah Harry, that’s where you’re wrong. You see, in the mind of a Malfoy, or any socialite Wizarding family really, appearances are everything.” He ran a hand through his hair and over his mouth in an unconscious reflection of his words before continuing. “It looks a lot worse if they threaten to disown me
Harry blushed deeply at the mention of his one publicity indiscretion during his days as a playboy of sorts, if by “playboy” you meant someone who stood about awkwardly at parties until he’d had at least three drinks in him and five hints heavily dropped on his head. “I just meant, what about you and your precious reputation? I thought you cared more about keeping the string of one-night stands going than about just spending time with someone like me.”
Harry shook his head, still staring at the floor. “No. No, I don’t think so, actually.” He wasn’t crying, as far as Draco could see, but the flat tone in his voice was more worrisome than any amount of tears would have been. “I haven’t been all right for a while, and now…” His voice trailed into nothing, and the seconds ticked by until Draco thought he would explode with tension. “This is utter shit. What we’ve been through, and how we’ve been living, and now you want things to go back to the way they were before? I know it was daft of me to think that you might have cast the curse, but what evidence was there otherwise?” He turned his head to look at Draco then, framed by his riotous hair and the crook of his elbow. “Hermione said that you must have done something to set off the misuse of magic alert. What was it?”
Draco shivered involuntarily at the thought. “Not planning to run into them ever again, thanks. Isn’t it an enormously difficult spell?”
Draco wasn’t quite sure how it had happened, but he was certain that he could not be imagining that Potter was in his home. After waving a hand in the direction of the door until it locked, Draco let Potter steady him as he removed his shoes at the door and stumbled toward the kitchen at the end of the hallway. “Tea,” he croaked at the kettle, which began to boil instantly. “Care for a cup?”
“Granger,” Draco spoke through gritted teeth. “Look in the bag I brought, you’ll find some a Wound-Cleaning Potion and ingredients for a Draught of Peace. If you let me go, I can use them.”
“Godric, I’ve missed this,” Harry murmured, and Draco gave an involuntary laugh at the near exact echo between his thoughts and Harry’s words. “I’ve missed everything about you, I’ve been going half mad without – “ and then he was under again, swimming through the tireless cascade of kisses and caresses exchanged between them.
“That’s wonderful, as long as you’re being safe about it.” Harry wasn’t going to ask for more information, but she gave it to him anyway. “There should be all sorts of spells for protection against disease, not to mention charms for lubricating, stimulating, massaging... I can find you a book on it if you want.”
Draco’s tone took a beseeching turn. “Harry, don’t you see, the Christmas Ball is the perfect occasion because it’s at the Ministry. Can’t get any more public than that.” His hands found their way back to Harry’s. “I know you’re a private person by nature, but in this case, the personal really does need to become political. We  - you – could do so much good by making this appearance. Just think of all the young Wizards and Witches who will be able to look up to you and follow your example, without shame or fear of being rejected for their identities.” He kissed Harry’s hands, one after the other, and trained his stormy blue gaze upon Harry’s steady green. “Together, we could make history.”
Harry could hear a sharp edge to Draco’s voice, and he supposed he deserved whatever resentment Draco might be feeling toward him. Harry was the one who had left during their last argument, after all, and Harry was the one who had refused to speak to him out of a misguided sense of personal honor. “I haven’t done much of anything really, just played a shitload of video games trying to distract myself from feeling miserable. I finally had enough of staying inside and went to an arcade in Camden, then got hungry and went to a bar with drag queens.”
He still carried his wand with him out of habit, but for the most part he had returned to living as a Muggle, minus the Dursleys and the cupboard under the stairs. Instead, he now lived in a cupboard at the top of the stairs, a third-floor loft that could barely be called a flat, it was so tiny and utilitarian. But, it was in the heart of London, and allowed him to take refuge from the downside of being a Wizard and a celebrity. It was a temporary reprieve, he told himself and his closest friends. But so far, he was not missing the Wizarding world much at all.
that had poured out of him, he couldn’t help responding in kind. Besides, hadn’t he called himself a glutton for punishment? “What does that expression even mean?” he wondered out loud.
“No, they aren’t. Harry’s brilliant, in his own way, but I think he was relieved to leave most of his studies behind after the drama of seventh year.” Hermione had steepled her hands again, which Draco took to be an indicator of impending decision. “Listen, Draco, I would love to take you up on your offer, but I have to get past a few work deadlines first. This year will be the death of me, I swear.”
Draco looked a question at him, but seeing Harry’s eagerness to please, and very much wanting to get back to feeling each other up sans clothing, he nodded assent. Harry prodded him into a seated position, sneaking in a kiss or two in the process, then began the first step. It involved wandless magic, in which he had become secretly adept after returning from his walk through the afterlife with Dumbledore, but he hadn’t done it in earnest for a while.
“Harry. It may shock you to hear this, but sometimes I say things I don’t mean. I even make up stuff just to sound cool. Especially when I want to impress someone. Like the Boy Who Lived, for example.”
Harry nodded, holding a spatula in one hand while something sizzled in the background. “What about your family, how are they taking your magical hiatus?”
about things, hadn’t he? And yet, if it weren’t for the string of cock ups and meltdowns, perhaps he wouldn’t be where he was now, on the cusp of something bright and meaningful. Speaking of which… He caught sight of Harry lingering in the door to the antechamber, uncertainty written all over him, and stood up a little straighter. It was time.
Harry had reached Draco’s side and took one of his hands with determination. “Look, I know it’s probably not what you want to hear, but Draco and I are seeing each other now.”
“Later, Harry,” she cut through his panic. “Right now I just want you to concentrate on getting back inside and finding something to stop the bleeding. A towel or some gauze if you have it.”
Draco didn’t have an answer to the question, but Harry’s quizzical look wouldn’t go away, so he made a stab at it. “I don’t really know, Harry. I do rather like it here in London, but it’s a lot harder to get away with magical activity in public. I suppose I will have to go back to the Manor eventually, get things sorted out with my parents.” He put the lid back on the box of chocolates. “I was working on getting their archive of ancient artifacts and documents organized before I moved here. Maybe I’ll finish that project up first.”
“That’s it, I swear. He bought me that one drink, and I was silly enough not to refuse, and then I realized that I liked men and that I loved you, before I left.” His eyes were anxious and very green against the aquamarine of the knitted blanket that was pulled up to his chin. “Does that make me strictly one way or another? I don’t know, but it was still a relief to discover that about myself. I was worried that it was only a weird, one-off thing with you.”
The night wore on into the wee hours, and the bar staff were clearly ready to start closing down by time the group made up its mind to go. Harry felt a moment of unease as he watched Malfoy stumble toward the loo, and wondered if he should step in and make sure he was all right. But he needn’t have worried, as the rest of the group were just as concerned with Malfoy’s wellbeing. It was at Mysteria’s insistence that Harry accompanied them all the way back to Malfoy’s street, and it was equally Mysteria’s insistence that Harry be the one to take him inside and make sure he was all right before leaving. “You still need to catch up, love,” they told Harry with a wink, when Harry might have protested.
Ginny tilted her head to one side, pursing her lips comically. “So you’re a helpless little kitten then? Too cute.”
Ginny sucked in air with surprise, and Harry knew exactly how she felt, because he felt it too, twisting in his gut. The green flash of light could only mean one thing, and Draco wasn’t even authorized to do magic in public, let alone one of the Unforgivables.
Harry laughed. “Since when have you shown any interest in my friends?” He stopped laughing when he saw how serious Draco was. “Sorry, I’m still getting used to the fact that we can tell people now. Within reason.” When Draco’s accusatory stare still didn’t let up, Harry shrugged. “What did you expect me to do, it’s not exactly like you have a history of getting along with my friends. They were all in Gryffindor, for Godric’s sake.”
Draco scoffed. “Hardly. Do you know what it does to a person, turning off the sex tap like that?” His long fingers were knotted together, and Harry was surprised to see hurt in his eyes. “Not just the sex, either. I missed having you around.” It looked like it took some effort to say, but Harry felt warm inside after hearing that Draco had missed him.
Groggily, Draco looked around the room. Everything looked normal, with the obvious exception of Harry’s presence in his bed. The offending wardrobe stood meekly against one wall, and Draco felt his heartbeat start to slow with relief. He sighed out loud and put his head in his hands, cupping his palms against his closed eyes. “Gah. Too many dreams.”
Draco put a stop to any further mental gymnastics on Harry's part by stepping into the bathroom. “Harry, I think what she is trying to say is, Ginny thinks that watching you and I together would be really hot.”
Draco didn’t say anything, just looked at Harry for a few minutes. The expression in his eyes was unfathomable, and Harry began to wonder if something was wrong. His fears were allayed when Draco’s face lifted into a smirk, and he bent down to kiss Harry. Harry could taste himself on Draco’s lips, with just a hint of salt and musk. Remembering where Draco’s mouth had been moments before brought a fire back to his lower belly, and he shivered at the thought of going at it again. But first, he wanted to talk.
Harry groaned. “I had completely forgotten,” he admitted, wincing again as she glared at him. “But I’m glad you brought it up.”
Malfoy stood with cold fury writ large on his face. “I think we’ve had enough of this conversation. Unless you can give me a reason not to escort you out of my home.”
Harry and Draco go on a date. Contains explicit sexual activity, mixed with magic. Some light is shed on Draco’s past. Harry gets to cook again.
Nothing happened, and Harry advised him to be less angry about it. “You’re not trying to be forceful, just maintain focus and be in touch with yourself. Feel your inner confidence.”
Draco thought for a moment, then told Harry about the small creature he’d encountered. “In my dream, I think my Patronus was – a carp.”
Which was how he ended up on a posh street in Notting Hill, lurking across from the townhouse where Malfoy supposedly lived. It looked perfectly ordinary, almost ridiculous in its niceness. Could this really be the dwelling place of his longtime arch-nemesis at school?
Harry’s smile widened, and Draco was put out to find that all three of them were chuckling. “Sorry, Sir Ocelot, we can’t help remembering the time you were turned into a ferret.” He put an arm around Draco to take the sting out of his words. “Old Mad-Eye Moody really had it in for you that year, even if he turned out to be Barty Crouch Jr. in the end.”
Draco took a deep breath and willed himself not to shut down, or pitch a tantrum, because truly he felt it could go either way. “I don’t really care to have this conversation right now, Harry. We have enough on our minds as it is. But, if you must know, my only intention as far as Ginny is concerned is to make up for what a humongous prat I’ve been to her over the years. Especially after what my father did to her in second year.” He stretched out his legs before him and glared at Harry. “As for Nigel, I don’t think he meant anything by it. But I will leave that for you to determine all by yourself. You’re a grown man, I know you can handle it.”
Draco snorted weakly, then winced in pain. “Depends on which body part you ask.” At Harry’s look of concern, he clutched his fingers around Harry’s and nodded. “Yeah, I’m all right. Thanks to this massive healing spell around my ribs.” He licked his lips, which looked dry and chapped. “The bullet was cursed, you know, and it punctured my lung. If they hadn’t gotten to it as quickly as they did, I might be in much worse shape by now.”
“You’re just saying that because you’ve got a hero complex. Why should I care about some distant group of Muggles and their problems? It doesn’t really affect me.”
He began to reconsider that assessment when a pair of fantastically dressed drag queens made an appearance from behind the curtain, cheered on by a small crowd that had gathered in front of the stage area. Fascinated despite himself, Harry watched the show from the bar while he inhaled chips, burning his tongue a little in the process. He tried to get the barkeep’s attention so he could order something cooling to drink but found himself S.O.L. as a very chatty group of young women had arrived and seemed intent on ordering half the menu.
Harry’s perception of time had narrowed and warped until he was no longer conscious of having a body. All he could focus on was the imminent danger that Ginny was in, and how he might remove her from that danger. The first thought that popped into his head was
It couldn’t have taken more than fifteen minutes for them to prepare for his departure, after hugging Ginny goodbye and shaking hands with Feruza. Harry however felt like it took forever, such was his haste to see Draco and verify with his own eyes that he was all right.
“Well, I’m hardly complaining. That one move you did, with the side hip thing, made your arse look amazing.”
, Draco reminded himself. Friends were for people who needed them, and Draco did not want to be needy of anyone. He could practically see the need oozing out of everyone at the table, and it repelled him if he thought about it too closely. But he was willing to play along, because it meant one less boring night for Draco, trapped in the Muggle realm.
Draco seemed hesitant, so Harry gently took him under the chin and guided his face back up to kissing level. It wasn’t so different than being with a woman after all, if he ignored the slight rasp of stubble and extra hair, the lack of soft curves, and the brash layer of masculine lust that enveloped the entire experience. But why would he want to ignore any of this, the gift of self-discovery and of finding new inroads of pleasure with someone as beautiful as Draco? “Godric, this feels so good,” he whispered, before kissing him once on the nose and reaching down between Draco’s legs yet again. Draco’s expression was lax, unfocused, clouded by desire, and Harry relished the deep red hue his lips had taken while sucking Harry off.
“So, Ron.” Hermione was again the first to break the silence. “Don’t you want to hear the story of how they met? Or reunited, I should say.” Ron’s expression changed to one of alarm, but Hermione’s pointed stare goaded him into asking to hear more. Harry was only too happy to oblige, and Draco wondered again how it was that he could stay so cheerful under such awkward circumstances.
The Chief Warlock had several questions for Draco after all of the other witnesses had been called, but his solicitor requested a brief recess. It took an inhuman amount of effort for Harry to prevent himself from running after Draco as he exited the room. Why was it that he, media darling and Draco’s closest ally, couldn’t be allowed the satisfaction of talking to him?
She punched him none too gently in the arm. “You know what I mean. His view toward Muggles and anyone who is not one hundred percent Wizard has changed. Just the fact that he and Harry are together, is a beautiful testament to the possibility of unity.” She was growing misty-eyed over her Brandy Alexander, and Draco wondered with alarm if it was more Brandy than Alexander.
The fireplace roared to life again, and Draco brought his head up with a start. It was his mother, and he found himself sitting up automatically with a straight posture, as he always did in her presence. She was smiling this time, and Draco smiled back. “Hello Mother.”
Harry didn’t ask for details, but his ears were a little pinker than usual when he took his first sip of the Cosmo Nigel offered to him. It flooded his mouth in a burst of sweetness and cranberry-citrus flavor. “That’s pretty good, thanks.”
Draco felt like a dolt, clutching a rickety old umbrella as they approached the door, which was brightly lit amidst the gloom of the evening. “Just drop it in the hedge over there,” Harry directed him when Draco held up the umbrella. “They can use it for other guests.” Draco complied and stood back as Harry knocked on the door, adorned with a cheery brass knocker in the shape of a Cheshire cat.
The advantage of not having a job gave him plenty of time to clean out his flat and decide what to cook. He could make an excellent
It was as if a light had gone out behind Harry’s eyes, spreading pallor into his cheeks that was quickly replaced by the warmth of anger. Draco took this as his cue to step away, smarting from the agony of physical separation.
It was all Draco could do to not stare at her with his mouth open. Was she that strategic in her approach to friendships, and were the pieces really going to fall into place as easily as she was suggesting? He had his doubts because he and Harry both were so effing stubborn, but he wanted to acknowledge her effort in any case, regardless of outcome. “Mother... thank you. For caring, and for letting me know.”
“Interesting.” Harry’s hand continued to stroke Draco’s hair, but his mind had gone elsewhere. Draco grew suddenly restless and sat up, kicking off the covers. He and Harry were still very much naked, but his appetite for fleshly delights had been derailed by the dream. Besides, his stomach was rumbling.
? It doesn’t make any sense.” She brought both hands up to bury them in her hair. “And what about Feruza, or Malfoy? Or anyone else who’s still there, at the mercy of that lunatic?” She began to walk, making long strides down the sidewalk while Harry jogged to catch up. “We have to go back, I don’t want to leave them alone any longer than we already have.”
After several rounds with both Harry and Nigel, he finally felt the effects start to wear off, and sleepiness overtook him. Harry was barely able to cover his own yawns, and Draco eventually stood up, with the intention of ushering him out the door, while Nigel gathered his own things upstairs. The night, and its magic, was almost over, and the prospect of the day ahead was beginning to weigh on Draco.
Harry had keeled over to one side, overcome by the pounding sensation on the side of his head and the lingering taste of beer in his mouth. He thought longingly of his missing ear, and wondered whether they would ever be united again. “Hermione, I have to find my ear.”
Patting him on the back as they separated, she replied, “Well, that makes you one in ten million then.” She sighed loudly as if she’d been holding her breath. “I really hope it works out between you and Draco. Despite what everybody might say.”
Was that the best he could come up with? He wanted to fall weeping on Harry’s neck like a courtesan in an overwrought novel and then carry him away to his own private island like a glamorous film star to shag him senseless, followed by a nice long cuddle.  It was a hopeless dream and it was not to be taken seriously, even though he’d thought about it many times before.
“Look, Harry, I appreciate that you were willing to step outside of your comfort zone and have a little fun with me. Hell, it was more than a little, you should really consider going gay full-time.“ Harry’s smile curled up briefly, then faded as Draco went on. “But really, who are we trying to fool? I’m not the type to stay committed for long, and you’re not going to want to stay in hiding forever, and I don’t want any kind of publicity that might displease my family. What would be the point of carrying on?”
Harry stood up in turn, horrified by Malfoy’s reaction. “I’m sorry Malfoy – I mean, Draco. There’s been a huge misunderstanding, I only wanted to make amends. Or at least start down the road toward making amends. We’ve been through a lot of shit the past eight years, and I think I’ve had enough of holding grudges. I had hoped you would feel the same.”
Draco lay sprawled backward across the bed, his robe and legs fallen open to either side over the edge while Nigel worked his magic between them. It was not long before Draco tipped back his head with abandon, obviously cresting a wave of sensation, then bringing a hand down to bury in Nigel’s hair. Harry watched his lips move as he sat gradually upright, and how he smiled when Nigel rose to kiss him. They indulged in long, juicy snog before Draco slapped a naked buttock and made to stand up.
“Wow, that Z’s hit you really hard by now, eh, Harry?” Draco’s arms were gentle as he guided Harry back into the bedroom. “Let’s establish a safe zone for ourselves. I don’t want you ending up anywhere you don’t want to be.” Harry’s eyes were closed, and he murmured something unintelligible. “I’m sorry, what was that?”
. There had been many painful episodes in his life, of course, but he still felt in quiet moments of self-honesty that falling in love with Draco and being rejected by him was at the top of the list. It had been more than a year since their last encounter, not far from where Harry now worked at the Ministry of Magic, and he still thought of it every time he passed that particular corridor. The desperation of their last kiss, and the deliberateness of Draco’s decision that had left Harry gutted and hopeless.
Grabbing his shoes in one hand, Draco made the climb, with Harry close behind. It was but the work of a moment to put on his own shoes and help Draco upwards through the skylight before lifting himself through and reaching down to collect his beloved broom.
Harry put an apron on before responding. “Mrs. Weasley, believe it or not. I know you don’t like Ron’s family very much, but she’s been like a second mum to me. Or a first, given that I never really knew mine.”
Brandon seemed nice enough, and by time the beer arrived, in a very tall glass, Harry had convinced himself that he had set his head straight about everything. Who cared if Draco was too much of a selfish git to be open about their developing relationship, and if Harry felt jealous every time he thought of Draco messing around with someone else? He had told Draco that he was all right with keeping things open-ended, after all, and why shouldn’t said open end apply to himself as well, if he wanted?
Draco, to his relief, was still there. So, however, was his mother. Neither of them had seen him yet, and Harry took a moment to steel himself before properly entering. They were in conversation with Auror Hawken, of all people, and Harry hesitated a fraction of a second before catching her attention. “Ah, Mr. Potter.” Her tone was polite and professional. “You’ve heard the news of Draco’s acquittal, I take it.”
“How on earth do you do that? Make it look so easy?” he murmured into Draco’s hair as they swayed in place.
Daylight arrived, and Harry slept the sleep of the dead until close to ten-thirty. He forced himself into the shower and emerged squeaky clean and partly satiated after a second wank. As was his usual wont since Draco had re-entered his life, he spent far too much time trying to arrange his hair just right, before giving up and spelling him at the stroke of eleven by the church bell down the street.
She only paused for a couple of seconds before rallying. “Harry, I need you to tell me where you are, and then I can help you.”
“What would you like to be called then? Harry, are you even aware of the giant franchise that Muggles have been building upon your name? Some woman claimed the credit for coming up with your story, and frankly, I don’t know how you can stand for it.”
“Luna!” Harry had no such reservations, and plunged forward to give her a quick hug. “What brings you here?”
Apparently Luna posed no threat, and the new Auror turned her attention to Feruza while Ginny walked over to the clothing racks at the far side of the room with Luna to change. Harry took a moment to brief Hermione on what had happened, including the part about Draco being taken to St. Mungo’s. She squeezed one of his shoulders in sympathy, and asked if he’d had any news, which prompted Harry to check the Protean coin yet again. This time, he was able to pick up on some tiny writing that had appeared, which he handed to Hermione for help reading (he was growing less impressed with his Burberry glasses by the minute).
“Well, actually – “ Malfoy didn’t seem any more enthusiastic about the idea than Harry felt (his previous magnanimity toward Malfoy all but forgotten), but it was too late. The posse surrounding him had decided that they were going to sit together, and that Malfoy and Harry wanted to talk. Which is how they found themselves squashed next to each other in a wine bar in Soho.
Mysteria grabbed his hand and led him behind the waiter, who seemed bent on finding them the most exclusive booth possible. Once parked, Mysteria turned their gaze upon Harry. “What does it matter, you can still enjoy yourself, yes?”
“Wait.” Brandon had gone after him. “Let me give you my number, in case you get lost or need anything.” He was scribbling in a tiny notebook that he’d produced from a pocket somewhere. “Wouldn’t want to have your fate weighing on my conscience tonight.” He tucked the piece of paper into Harry’s coat pocket and gave him a small smile. “It was very nice to meet you too, Harry.”
Draco balked at putting on the jumper, turning up his nose at the loud design. When Harry explained to him that they would be flying in the countryside, he insisted on visiting Harry’s closet and picking out something himself.
Harry picked up another bottle after handing the open one to Draco. “No offense, mate. How about – to making new friends out of old enemies.”
Harry followed his lead and found himself gaping at the chandelier floating overhead in the stairwell. It consisted of several concentric loops that moved slowly in circles, flashing various rainbow lights off the crystals that dripped downwards from each loop. When he looked back down, Malfoy had disappeared into the kitchen at the end of the hall, and Harry peeked through the doors that flanked either side of the foyer. To his right, there was a small dining room with a table for six. To the left, a den with dim lighting and pudgy armchairs arranged across from what appeared to be a locked cupboard.
