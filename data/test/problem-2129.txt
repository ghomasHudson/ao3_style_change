Alastair tells those male satyrs to have a strong sexual desire. They will chase the Nymphs and any woman for intercourse. The satyrs were able to smell women who were in their fertile period.
Harry's smile seemed full of amusement seeing Draco's helpless condition. The man opened all the buttons on his shirt so that his chest and muscular stomach were exposed. For a moment, Draco was stunned by the bronze skin that sparkled like satin, but then he realized he was in a precarious condition.
"What do you want to say, Troya?"
Both of them were surprised to find Peeves already above them, hovering here and there. Draco's face turned tomato red from embarrassment, and Harry turned red from the annoyance of being disturbed.
"Only the part where your position as a god is threatened, God Zeus who is said to want to step down from his throne, and Goddess Hera's disapproval of me being here," Draco answered truthfully. Indeed that was all he had heard before Alastair forced him away from the door.
The young woman began to sob softly.
When the others had started to get off their horses and pulled over to take shelter under the shady trees in the forest, Draco was still sitting on his horse. His silver eyes stared blankly at Harry, helping Arabelle get off the horse.
Draco carefully peered through the adjoining window and found a man in an expensive, formal suit standing at his door. From his appearance, he seemed to be a good man. But looks can be deceiving, can't they? Draco still couldn't believe that such a kind and smiling Doctor Jason was actually a ruthless psychopath.
"I don't think we should hear this, Prince," Alastair warned anxiously.
"You don't want to?" Harry spoke again. He had run out of ways to convince Draco to agree to go with him tonight. While Harry had every right to be angry—even chastised—at the refusal of his own subordinates, he did not. Besides, Draco's words had some truth in them. They are not soulmates; he couldn't just ask Draco to be with him and pretend he was his
"All right..."
But why didn't the man do anything to him? It doesn't mean that Draco wanted Harry to do anything to him. But that memory, the image of Harry, who was so enthusiastic about it, could not disappear from his mind.
"Is that true? Have you ever seen a snake?" Draco asked. He looked for bite marks on his wrist, but they weren't anywhere. He doubted the testimony of courtiers about the cause of his illness.
"Don't you have a lunch appointment with your parents, Rouvas?" Harry smiled stiffly while Draco was still struggling to escape his grip. "I'm afraid you will be late, and of course, you definitely don't want that to happen."
Draco angrily pushed her hand away and scoffed. "So funny, Pansy. Like I just got permission from my parents to date,"
“Get over there quickly. He wants you," The bartender standing behind him whispered to him, as if afraid that if Draco didn't do what Harry wanted, it would be fatal.
A few people were laughing. Draco could clearly hear them whispering. "Winged devil? How funny,"
Draco's cheeks warmed, but Daphne didn't seem to notice and continued her words.
Glenice pursed her lips. As usual, she couldn't fight Draco. Until accidentally, both of Glenice's eyes stared at the garden, which was already far away from them. Glenice's eyes narrowed at the crazy sight.
"Honestly, no, the oracle who found you testified that it was a snake bite. Besides, didn't the palace healer confirm that? Said it was from six snake bites."
Draco just watched the man as he walked and sat there. Taking a deep breath, Draco begged him. "I know an immortal like you can live for thousands of years. But I don't, so I don't want to waste my days just like that," he said softly.
Draco thought for a moment. He does not know. He didn't really like living in Sparta. All the attention on him was starting to tire him out, but being taken to the mountains by people who might just be swindlers doesn't sound too much fun either. He still believed that he could return to his original body. Suppose his soul can move to Troya's body that means there was a way to do the opposite. He just doesn't know how.
"But I'm not Elle! We are clearly different. She is a woman and I am a man. So let me go, I am not a substitute for your wife!" Draco couldn't help but sound annoyed.
"No need, I'm fine," He insisted.
"Seducer," Draco sneered as he smiled widely and shifted his gaze from Cedric to the large trees that were currently accompanying them.
Draco quickly shook his head, then smiled. "It's okay. Uh, are you Pott—I mean, Mr. Potter's guest who came today?" Draco asked, correcting his words nervously.
Without further ado, Harry threw his jacket on the chair, loosened his tie, and gave Draco a sharp look. "What did you say to Ron's Wife?"
Supported by the cool and serene air, Draco finally fell asleep without noticing the presence of someone who was now standing in a dark corner and watching him with glowing eyes.
"How can I not interfere if you disturb my human? I am his guardian angel, and I have the right to keep him away from you," argued Icarus.
Unaccompanied by anyone, Draco walked down the halls, room after room, until finally arriving at the end of the hall, with walls completely made of glass, reflecting sunlight all over the hall and a magnificent view behind the glass. The view of the crimson rose garden that vines and fills the small garden there.
Demigods could occasionally leave Olympus to meet their families. The status of a Demigod was usually kept a secret, as many humans believe in superstitions such as their hair or body parts having specific properties.
The King of the Delion Kingdom looked stuttered when he heard those words. He was terrified that his words would offend Harry because, after all, the King of the Delion did not want to damage the relationship created between the Delion Kingdom and the Shinia Kingdom for the past century.
"Looks like it's a member of the royal family. Draco, you should just keep walking here and act like you normally would."
Natalie's smile widened when she heard Draco's words, "See! Let's go back! I want to rest!" Natalie said excitedly to her husband.
Showing off to each other in informal events like this has become an open secret that can't be doubted. The nobles will wear the latest luxury clothes from famous fashion designers. They will gather and form their own association as a place to show off each other.
Harry quickened his pace towards Draco.
Really, Cedric could not understand him. A very sharp iron sword had just hit his neck, but he still had the courage to speak, as if he was not afraid that his actions would make fresh blood flow again profusely from his neck.
Harry put his eggs on the kitchen table, then he stood facing Draco and saw Draco's face burning with angry flames. Then Harry started walking toward Draco, his green eyes suddenly turning dark black. A dark aura rose from him. Now his black eyes stared at Draco, intimidated.
Was that man drunk? Draco's heart started thumping. In a conscious state, Harry's emotions are very unpredictable, especially when he was drunk.
And he's sure, someday Draco will realize that there is still Cedric who wants to love him with all his heart, take care of him, and make him the happiest person on earth.
are you?"
Draco stared at the other man stubbornly. "Then explain to me who this woman is, why her face looks so similar to mine and is this why Harry kept me captive?"
Everything went well at first. Harry kept his promise to change into a better man, to take care of him, to make him happy.
Draco waited a long time until the car finally slowed down. There was a sound of massive gates opening, then the car started again, slowed down, and then stopped. The sound of the car door slamming. And thankfully, there's a movement to open the trunk. Draco prepared to jump and attack whoever opened the trunk door, then escaped.
"I was in the mood to eat out, and you..." Harry studied Draco with a 'watch out if you dare to argue' look. "You are my lover, so you must accompany me."
"They must not be real messengers. They are scammers. A real god can't send his followers to the land of humans. Of the three Oracles that resided in the temples of Athena and Apollo, none claimed to have received
Draco shook his head. "No, I—"
As a stalker, Hector was too attractive. He has light brown hair with a handsome outline. His blue eyes give off a masculine feel. His body was also naturally shaped through the forging of military training since he was young. That person was clearly not on steroids, let alone consuming protein drinks to build muscle. But his good looks didn't help. Hector scares Troya with his excessive attention.
Whether it was because Harry couldn't think straight or because the man did have a lot of strength, the man pulled the rope so tightly that the young man wearing the dress let out a soft moan of pain.
When Draco woke up, the first thing he felt was the tightness in his chest. He writhed in panic, trying to breathe rapidly, trying his hardest to get as much oxygen as possible.
Draco was speechless for a moment. The young man cursed himself for thinking too far. Damn it! Draco didn't know that fiction novels could affect his sanity.
It was clearly a god's weapon. The Greeks were not familiar with such weapons, but the Spartan warriors will not fear death. For them to die in the line of duty was an honor. They only hoped that Hades would not drag their souls into Tartarus for defying the gods.
"Your Majesty, you look very compatible with His Majesty. I hope my daughter can also find a man like His Majesty and live a married life like Your Majesty and His Majesty," said a middle-aged noblewoman who was one of the many nobles who currently surround Draco.
Feel free to leave feedback/comment, guys. I will appreciate it sooo much. Thank you! ❤️
More tears slip past Draco's beautiful grey eyes, but Harry doesn't wipe them away this time. He
The King of Sparta refused to believe it. It doesn't matter how convinced the messenger was. He didn't want to give up his son without a fight.
Draco had no other choice. He also didn't know what kind of danger could befall him in this era of ancient Greece. Draco was about to ask which warriors would be willing to escort him before a dashing man suddenly came up to the two of them and spoke.
"Cedric," Draco whispered softly.
"What do you mean?"
With that, Draco's cries finally broke out. He sobbed, with a doll in the shape of Doraemon in his arms.
Arabelle stepped in as well, with her brain still raging. A luxury carriage was waiting for them. With the help of the coachman, the two of them finally managed to throw their buttocks onto the soft seat in the carriage.
All his life, Draco had been against sharing glasses and plates with other people. But this time, he accepted it for fear that Ares would be offended if he refused. There must be a reason why the majority of Greek poets said Ares was a cruel god.
"Yes, of course, master Harry was against it. The pregnancy was dangerous. Mrs. Seraphina's life was at stake,” Alden bowed his head sadly. "Then Mrs. Seraphina miscarried."
"Do you think the people are willing to pay for such large amounts of linen? No, they are thinking of buying linen from other kingdoms. If this happens, of course, our kingdom's economy will decline."
Of course, the relationship between Ares and Aphrodite was well known in mythology. They were a sinner couple and had an affair based on lust. Ares was said to love the Goddess so much that he repeatedly kills his love rival.
Good, it looks like Doctor Jason's getting off guard. Now it's time to find a way to fool this doctor and run away later, Draco thought.
They only consist of four men with mercenary-like appearances and a woman with dark brown hair in a similar outfit. Draco originally suspected that the messenger God Ares would have a unique physique like a centaur or satyr. His suspicions were running high, but the gifts he brought were bountiful. Draco doubted that any wealthy aristocrat in Greece could carry such an expensive wedding gift.

"It's possible. This is also the first time I've heard of him intending to." Hera sighed.
"I can't," Cedric said weakly, with his hands already moving to grip Draco's arms gently.
Draco half smiled, then touched Harry's cheek gently. In an instant, Harry's body stiffened as if surprised by the soft touch of Draco's fingers on his cheek.
All the guards clapped loudly when they saw Cedric draw his sword from the guard's neck. Cedric walked with a crooked smile towards him. The prince let the tip of his sword graze the battle area coated with rough cement.
Draco was stunned by Hermione's words. He beamed at the happy news. "Congratulations,"
looks very adorable. His hand moved to brush away some of Arabelle's hair that had fallen over the sides of the girl's face.
"You mortals think of them as mythology, and yourself make a convincing spectacle that they exist." Uninvited, Harry sat next to Draco.
"Mom,"
Draco shook his head, trying to wriggle, but Harry's strong body that was half crushed him limited his movements. Moreover, his hands were tied up, making his arms feel cramped, and his wrists ached when he moved them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco was exhausted both mentally and physically. He hadn't gotten enough sleep because Ares spent the night with him yesterday. Whether intentional or not, the way to sleep was just 'flirty'. He snored, but his arms wrapped around Draco's slender waist, rubbing his stomach and not wanting to let go. Draco figured he could pretend to be asleep since he hadn't touched any other area. How can a sleeping person choose where he touches?
Harry twirled Draco's body. He couldn't possibly keep his wife dancing with him. In any case, when they weren't in Shinia, Harry couldn't break the royal rules at will, even though technically, Harry had already broken some of them.
"Fine, that's not the point. I saw a glimpse of the future when I kissed that guy."
"It's because you are the queen that I made you a bet!"
with open arms.
A human passed him and asked what he was doing. Then he even explained about nuclear reactors and how to use them. At that time, Prometheus was a technician who took care of the advanced machines belonging to the Titans. Ares was already in his palace. He should have met his new wife. But Alastair notified him there was a local earthquake that forced them to split up. The prince of Sparta disappeared with his horse.
"How long can you love me?" he asked.
"My throat hurts a little from screaming so much earlier," Draco reasoned in a slightly low voice.
"They're brown, just like your hair," Draco said in a small voice.
Draco was undoubtedly familiar with the story of Eros and Psyche. Aphrodite, jealous of Psyche's beauty, orders her son Eros to make the princess fall in love with an ugly monster. But Eros gets hit by his own love arrow and has a love affair with Psyche. Aphrodite initially disagrees and undertakes various gruesome trials to dissuade them. Finally, the two of them got together. Their story was a Greek mythological tale with a happy ending.
Harry chuckled a little. He had intended to bring Draco back with him, but with Draco's disheveled appearance and Harry's immaculate appearance, there was bound to be some slanted gossip about them.
"This is amazing," Draco said.
"It's not poison, Draco, it will stimulate you until your cravings get out of hand, and you will be in pain if you are not satisfied."
Daphne's last words before leaving brought Draco away from his frustration. Harry had treated him just like his lovers, who could be commanded at will like a doll!
creepy. Draco started to feed the cereal into his mouth and watched the movie. He watched tv more and more serious until he didn't realize Harry was at his side again.
"Did he say anything to your wife?"
"That makes sense," The King nodded.
"Are you sure you want to live here?" asked Hagrid, who was opening a room for Draco.
"You make me like a whore. You only think of me as your toy!" Draco shouted angrily.
"Have you finished eating? Is that all?" Ares glanced at Troya in surprise.
For starters, Draco planned to dip his long legs into the river. Draco's hands moved to lift his simple dress a little high so the river water wouldn't get it.
"As if!!" Draco screamed sharply, trying to restrain himself from crying. “I don't belong to anyone, let alone an evil monster like you! I want to get out of here. I'm sick of you, sick of everything in here. I want to go out!!!!"
"He's not the Oracle who lives here. I heard he's from Athens. After delivering the medicine he claims to be from God Ares, he leaves."
Harry's head shot up as if it had been jerked. He looked at Ron warily. "Oh, yeah?" his tone was relaxed, but the tension in Harry's voice couldn't fool Ron.
Draco took it with a little hesitation. "I can't carry this sword around all the time. The police will arrest me for carrying a sharp weapon."
"Oh, thank goodness. I thought I was going to get dumped," Draco whispered again, honest about his frustration.
"You look sad," The sound made Draco jump. He turned his head to find Doctor Jason standing at the door, staring at him anxiously. "Are you okay?"
Draco's heart skipped a beat when he heard a male voice that had only been in his mind for a few seconds. Draco quickly looked up and saw Harry looking at him with a surprised look.
»»-———— ♡♡♡ ————-««
"He'll live," Alastair said once they had come a long way.
"I was just taking a short walk, Your Majesty," Draco said with a gentle smile.
Draco nodded. "Since I'm your wife, don't you need to ask my permission just to hold hands?" He blushed at saying that.
Before Harry could finish his sentence, a scream that sounded spoiled made the man shut his mouth. Both Harry and Draco quickly looked for the owner of the voice, who turned out to have opened the door to the royal study so rudely.
Harry had only glanced disinterestedly. He was busy staring at Draco's sleeping face. "What else?"
That's Glenice. Draco's personal maid.
"Erm," Draco gripped the white blanket tightly, trying to hide his naked body, which was full of hickeys and Harry's bites. “Can you bring my breakfast to my room? I'll eat there..." he spoke awkwardly.
»»-———— ♡♡♡ ————-««
"We didn't see that. But we saw this," Cedric let go of Draco's hand.
Ares chuckled, feeling amazed, confused, and surprised at the prince's request. "You're not wrong. You must have heard from my people how I abandon my lovers and ignore them when I'm bored. I don't think there's any point in pretending to be nice to you. I really can't guarantee that I'll still like you, Troya." Ares responded.
Draco stared angrily at Harry. Why did that man abruptly come and scold Draco all of a sudden? Where was the promise that Harry said that he would release Draco if he became his lover? Draco's anger also ignited.
Although Harry could continue his enjoyment, the sight of Draco's orgasm and Draco's throbbing hole squeezing him, deep inside, made him unable to hold back anymore. Before he could help it, Harry exploded his desire to join Draco in a sullen pleasure.
"Are you currently trying to seduce other noblemen? Aren't you satisfied with just having His Majesty?"
Draco turned his head and faced a beautiful woman in her white dress, who smiled gently at him. Maybe this woman was the only guest at the party who wanted to say hello to Draco.
"You really think so?" Draco said uncertainly.
"Yes, he's an immortal as well. But I don't know what kind of creature he is."
"What is it?" asked Harry, seemed aware that Draco had been staring at him with... scared maybe?
It felt like the young man wanted to curse himself. Only one day had he expressed his emotions freely with Cedric, but he couldn't control his feelings anymore. Draco didn't want to be branded as incompetent by anyone.
Draco was so mesmerized he was almost breathless. He stood for a long time in front of the garden, then frowned when he realized that the right-wing of the house, though clean and well-groomed, appeared to be hardly ever used.
The first chapter for this fic! Enjoy! ❤️
"Thank you, Your Majesty." said the King of the Delion with great relief.
Unbelievable! Draco shook his head in disbelief as he heard the words slip freely from Cedric's lips.
Before answering Draco's question, Glenice bit her lower lip timidly. She knew very well that a lowly maid like herself was strictly forbidden to talk about royal family members, especially if she wanted to tell something that didn't sound good.
"You can do it. We haven't even started yet. You don't have to worry about anything. Everything will be fine," Cedric reassured.
"Did I make a mistake?" Draco asked cautiously.
The God of War re-sheathed his sword after making sure that no more monsters would attack him. He saw the dawn starting to rise and the sky turning red. The bride should be arriving today. He also saw the fresh carcass of the bull monster he had killed earlier. Ares scratched his chin and got the idea to bring a present for his new wife.
"You, who else?"
Draco held the reins of his horse in a graceful motion. At this moment, he was the center of attention of the guards standing guard right behind Draco. Right now, Draco was no different than a goddess who had descended from the sky.
"Isn't that obvious? It's all because I
"Yeah, it's just a name, and maybe everyone in the future will remember it as a rebel and a traitor," Terence said with a crooked smile.
Arriving at the hospital, Harry rushed to the room where Draco was being treated, along with a bouquet of flowers that he was holding. And Harry walked through the hallway but then seen several men running from the corner of the hallway where Draco's room was.
Real love comes to those who still hope after disappointment, who still believe after betrayal, and who still love after they have been hurt.
Draco sank further through the forest, the only shortcut to the main road, although the risk was that if he wasn't careful, he would fall into a fairly deep ravine.
“Such a good boy, so sensitive and pliant for me,” Harry cooed, causing goosebumps to erupt on Draco’s heated skin.
"If Prince Cedric forgets, let me remind you one more time. I am the wife of Harry James Potter, ruler of the Kingdom of Shinia. I am your brother-in-law and queen. Does Prince Cedric think it is appropriate for me to open my heart to you?" Draco asked in his proper sentence.
"We are Sparta! We are not easily defeated. My agreement with Oracle is one-sided. I will demand renegotiation."
"Queen Draco, you must know that right now, the kingdom is thrifty? We must prepare ourselves. We don't know when the other kingdom will attack and seize power."
"Thanks, Draco." Hermione touched Ron's arm gently, turning Ron's seemingly inseparable attention to Draco. "Ron, this is Draco," muttered Hermione softly.
Harry casually lay on the bed, unconcerned with his naked body, raised his eyebrows, and smiled as Draco looked away. On purpose, he approached and lifted Draco's chin to look at him. "Why, babe? You're embarrassed to see your lover naked? Haven't we spent hours naked together?"
Who is this female soldier?
"I've never been this happy."
"His fault for not trying harder for me. I'm Aphrodite, the Goddess of Beauty that everyone worships. Hephaestus should have put in a little effort to make me like him," grunted Aphrodite.
"What? No! Look, this was all beyond my plans. I'm not the only one to blame for this. Hermes proposed it. He took us on a bet to get the Prince of Sparta. This is just a game. It's just that Hermes made it so complicated!" Ares took a deep breath before explaining.
. I'm aware of my place in Your Majesty's heart. I have no right to be jealous because I know Your Majesty doesn't love me." Draco said with a genuine smile.
"Fairy, werewolf, warlock, vampire, do any of us look like angels?"
"Yes, as long as you can beat me. I'm sick of seeing you holding back like this."
“Draco,” Harry's voice was low and menacing, even though he actually enjoyed saying Draco's name slowly in his mouth. "If you don't do what I say and are busy looking for a way to — who knows what plans you have in your pretty head, then maybe I will change my mind and just fuck you right away."
"Your Majesty, it seems that you don't have a partner anymore. May I be your partner now?" asked the crown prince politely to Draco as he extended his hand.
Despite this, Draco had thought that the concubine would just tell him her name.
27/08/2021
Arabelle was a beautiful girl, but unfortunately, Arabelle's beauty does not match the standard type of beauty in the western kingdom. Arabelle had black eyes and straight hair that were also dark, not the standard western type of beauty. But somehow, Harry really liked Arabelle's face. Maybe it was because Harry could not obtain Arabelle's beauty in others in this kingdom.
"I understand your feelings, but there were some things that I didn't have time to explain to you at that time when master Harry interrupted our conversation," Alden said again, "Indeed, you will surely see that master Harry only sees you as a substitute for Mrs. Seraphina. No. As time goes by, what master sees is you, yourself."
"Who?" Draco grimaced when he realized the woman's comment.
"Prince Cedric! What did you do to her?!" An angry shout managed to distract the girl from Prince Cedric's hostile face.
With his terrifying chuckle and laugh, Doctor Jason swung the knife, and for a second, Draco felt a sharp pain from the sharp metal cut in his arm.
Draco picked it up when he saw several guards running toward him.
"I'm neither thirsty nor hungry. We just had dinner last night," Ares smiled at him.
Instantly filled with dizziness because of his head's sudden position, Draco realized that he had been lifted out of the club. With all his might, Draco tried to fight. His hands pounded the bodyguard's back, and his legs kicked violently while screaming in anger and frustration, but the bodyguard's body was rock solid, unresponsive to Draco's struggling.
"My Lady," a middle-aged woman was now bowing in front of him. "You have been awaited by My Lord below."
"Why do you always make me feel like I don't deserve to be with you?" Cedric’s words managed to make a frown appear on Draco's forehead.
"Prince Cedric ordered us to guard the Empress,"
For whatever reason! Damn the vulgar novel Draco just read! That crazy novel must have affected his brain.
"No, I'm fine. I'm sorry, my head hurts a little."
Vlad moved away. He was standing in front of the window. Silence as if thinking. "Go."
Draco's heart began to double. Cedric's sad face looked at him with a look of tender love, a look he would never get from his husband. The other man's hand that gently stroked his hand managed to make him feel comfortable.
"I... I thought you were just joking."
Draco felt too exhausted to throw a bunch of cursing at him.
His stomach rumbled, and he felt thirsty. Since lunch, he hadn't eaten because he was too nervous about plotting his revenge on Harry, and now he was hit by the stone. The food's aroma was so intriguing, the scent of sweet and savory dishes.
"Yes,"
, Harry thought,
"Okay, it's up to you," Ares smiled. He then cleaned his hands with a cloth soaked in warm water and then stretched out his hand.
Harry's goal tonight not to find a partner for a one-night stand in an exclusive bar in the city. In fact, he wants to spend some time alone from his busy day-to-day dealing with documents on his desk.
"Ares, can you wait until I'm ready?"
"At this point, the situation will be a little dangerous, Prince of Sparta. You must not be separated from Attica for whatever reason. Do you understand?"
"You like it, don't you?" Harry whispered softly with his breath hot in Draco's ear. "I really like your lips and the soft sensation they have on mine," Harry's hand crept downward, touching the skin of Draco's neck. "Your whole body is warm, baby, as if it made to tease me." Harry's fingers uncover the oversized shirt Harry deliberately put on Draco, playing with the top of Draco's panties and slipping inside, teasing his cock. "Here... The most passionate part."
Pansy and Blaise laughed. It didn't matter if Draco was ready to throw the bowl away.
"Isn't His Majesty still sick?" asked Arabelle curiously when she saw a shawl draped over Draco's slender neck.
"What do husbands usually do?"
When they are on their way home, Harry's mood seems even worse than before. Draco frowned at him. Does Harry always go through his days in this rage? That man will surely die young, Draco thought with amusement.
"No, Your Majesty." Draco firmly refused as he rose from his position.
Silence greeted the two nobles. They both stared at each other with intense gazes that were hard to decipher. Until footsteps that sounded like they were made as loud as they could tread the forest ground jolted Draco.
"Draco,"
Alden frowned and came closer. "What's the matter, sir?"
Draco snorted. "I don't want to take anything from here. I came here with nothing, and so when I get out of here."
After ensuring everything was fine, the couple got up from their position and resumed wandering in the dense forest. But this time, Cedric could no longer hold Draco's soft hand because he was already busy giving his hands to the helpless-looking little bird.
"Don't stand around like a fool, Malfoy."
"We can't draw your blood. Your condition is not possible," the doctor interrupted as quickly as Alden did.
Cedric's smile still on his handsome face began to steer his horse towards the place he wanted to show Draco. Before Draco started his horse to follow in Cedric's footsteps, the blonde took the time to glance at Harry.
"This sword of mine is a gift from Ares which when slashed will burn his flesh at the same time. It's harrowing, but the bleeding won't last long," Alastair explained.
"Good,"
Draco pulled out his phone and waved it in the air. "By calling him, you moron," he spats.
He was on guard, and he began to guess who had entered this royal chamber without the slightest bit of courtesy. Draco knew it couldn't be his husband. Harry was a nobleman who had been trained to be the ideal king since he was young. Harry would never break down a door violently, even if it were his own bedroom door.
Draco shook his head. "Ah, it's okay, doctor, forget it, thanks for taking care of me."
"You can read here," Harry offered, seeming too kind.
Harry chuckled when he saw their behavior. Then Harry lowered his head and looked at Draco, his smile fading immediately. "Don't try to run away, and don't try to ask anyone here, they won't be able to help you, and if I find out you do, you will be punished," Harry whispered coldly, his attitude turned stiff, and he let go of the hug from Draco, without another word he left Draco alone.
Anyway, thank you for reading. I hope this new plot was enjoyable. Kudos and comments are always appreciated <3
"Yes, I can, Prince." answered Glenice without lifting her head.
"Can you walk?" asked Harry as he rose from his position and held out his hand to help Arabelle up.
"What? Amazons?" he gasped.
As for Draco, he watched the whole thing from where he was sitting. He noticed Arabelle crying into Harry's chest. It would be a lie if Draco didn't envy the young woman. She was free to express her feelings without fear of anyone reproaching her.
"Yeah, although it's a little hard to accept," Blaise continued seriously, trying to imitate Pansy.
Doctor Jason sighed as Draco was pensive. "Ah, I shouldn't talk too much. You should get some rest."
"Is that Harry's newest girlfriend?" A cynical voice was heard. Apparently, the owner of the voice was intentionally making Draco hear it.
"Glenice... Are you ignoring me now?"
"Master is with a guest in his study room, Mr. Draco..."
But he decided to calm down and carry out his original plan, which was to befriend Hadreda. The Star Tower looks quite deserted, but that doesn't mean the building was neglected. There were several Titans seen working there and carrying scrolls of parchment in their hands. The Titans lived like the ancient Greeks, including their clothing and food.
That devil saved him. Draco closed his eyes, imagining Harry blocking the knife that was about to stab him with his bare hand. Draco still remembered the flowing blood and couldn't help but realize that he had been saved by Harry several times.
"Zeus, that punishment is too much. Ares can't lose the title of god of war," Hera said after Athena left.
Ares took the prince into his arms and spoke while whispering in his ear. "Didn't I tell you that I would protect you?"
A loud groan was heard. The bull moved away, trying to stay alive. Ares' sword managed to hit its vital veins. The monster bull's blood gushed out, turning the mulberry bush in its path red. The bull struggled and tried to escape with the sword still stuck with the last of its breath. Ares jumped forward and hit the bull's nose hard with a fist wrapped in copper plates to knock it off balance.
The pure white body looks very soft, the long blonde mane that tries to cover him, the two long legs that bend each other as if the owner needs warmth.
Draco didn't understand how that bastard could move after all they'd done all night.
The man looked at Draco sharply, then shrugged and stared at Draco straight ahead. "Come on, I'm not in the mood to argue with you," he looked at Draco seriously. "How do you feel?" Harry lowered his head and studied Draco.
Draco looked at his father, who was now taking a small glass bottle out of his pocket with a cold stare. When Lucius took Draco's hand and placed the glass bottle in his hand, he remained silent.
"Prince Cedric?!" Draco gasped in surprise when he saw Prince Cedric, Harry's cousin, walking towards him with an extremely annoyed expression.
," Daphne was dumbfounded when she saw Draco looked normal at the name of the restaurant. “Hey, that's the classiest five-star restaurant. There will be lots of eyes that see and judge you, but don't mind them.” Daphne rolled her eyes flirtatiously. "They're just jealous because you're with the most wanted bachelor."
The legend tells about Prometheus, a Titan who shared the knowledge of how to make fire with humans. When Zeus found out, he imprisoned him on a high mountain and let the birds peck at his flesh and heart. In fact, Prometheus was not teaching humans how to make fire.
"Y-you," Draco swallowed his voice harshly.
—Draco concluded that he really had lived in ancient Greece.
Several servants were seen immediately rushing away to carry out his request. Draco then looked again at the King and Queen, who looked sad. He felt confused, wasn't their child already conscious? Why do they keep acting sad? As soon as the servants returned with the large mirror, Draco froze with surprise when he saw his reflection. Then the Queen began to wail.
Draco was on one side of the vast gardens of the palace, wearing a comfortable cotton dress and a wide woven hat. The weather was sunny, and the sun was shining brightly but not hot because it was almost evening.
Till one day, Harry came back. He said he was sorry. He regretted everything and wanted to start over. Harry wanted to be a better man and make Draco happy.
"It hurts! Help!" Draco screamed without restraint. He rolled on the hard bed, curled up, holding his head. A loud buzz rang around his ears. It sounded like a swarm of bees swarming and about to attack him, but its form does not exist. After a few seconds of struggling, he passed out.
Harry's lips formed a horizontal line, waiting for Ron to finish his words.
"If only my stepmother were not pregnant with my child, maybe I would also fall in love with you, Your Majesty," Terence said non-formally, ending with a chuckle.
"He's not that attractive. I'm just not interested enough," Ares said while looking the other way. He lied, of course. He couldn't remember the last time he felt so passionate about a human. Neither did he say it because he wanted to please Aphrodite, but more to maintain his pride.
The God of War hugged his slender waist, continuing the kiss while the nervous and inexperienced Draco tried to speak. Unfortunately, when he opened his mouth, Ares instead raised the level of his kiss and pulled his tongue out.
"Did Your Royal Highness just see something funny?" Draco asked as he caught the crown prince's amusement.
When he regained consciousness, Draco was in the white room, and he closed his eyes again. Never before had he felt so grateful to be in this room. Terror still crept over him, imagining the blade flickering across his face, on his body, on his arms…
"When did I apologize?"
Draco's inexperienced movements caused Harry to grit his teeth to suffocate his mounting excitement. Finally, in one smooth motion, Harry pressed himself in, connecting his body with Draco.
Honestly, after hearing the news that he was pregnant, Draco felt as though his world was collapsing and falling to pieces. After all this time, he had struggled to get rid of Harry, and Harry had miraculously agreed to free him, but it seemed fate was playing a game with Draco.
Draco flinched. His eyes immediately turned from that beautiful place toward Cedric, who had already slipped from the horse first.
Draco nodded his head, wiping his tears embarrassedly. "I'm fine, doc..."
A groan escaped as she felt a stinging pain run through her elbows and knees. As much as possible, she tried to get up from her position. But unfortunately, she was too weak and could not do anything.
"Who told you to come out, huh?" Harry's voice rose slightly, burning with jealousy, but he didn't want to admit it. He then grabbed Draco's wrist. "Hurry up and get inside," he ordered.
Draco failed to hide his surprise. His face went red from being caught by the other boy. "I thought you were still in the hall," Draco responded, trying not to sound stupid.
"No... This... It's not because of the bugs..." Arabelle stuttered as she touched the bluish blotches that stood in stark contrast to her long, pale neck.
"I don't really like festivities, just celebrate our wedding with dinner that some close relatives attend. I'll think about the food," Draco dodged, thinking of an easier way to deal with it.
"Then why are you talking to me about this? Don't tell me you think I have a chance to—"
"Are you mad because I don't love you?" Harry asked carefully as he looked into Draco's silver eyes.
Zeus leaned back and scratched his chin. His eyes were filled with anger and disappointment. The beard and mustache on his face were a sign that he was a senior generation of the Titan race that was more than four thousand years old because he didn't age like the rest of the Titan race. There was a faint wrinkle on his forehead, but it was not due to aging but a manifestation of the burden of his thoughts for thousands of years leading the Titans.
"Harassing?"
Draco managed to turn on the light, and it was quickly revealing Harry. The man sat on his couch casually, wearing only black silk pajamas and holding a drinking glass next to his hand. Draco glanced at the brandy bottle that appeared to have come out of nowhere, which Harry seemed to have poured while waiting for him.
As sensitive as Harry, Draco realized that the owner of the crying voice was none other than his husband's mistress. Nevertheless, he tried to be indifferent so he wouldn't spoil the activity the four of them were currently doing.
With a bit of a grunt, Harry pulled on his light robe and covered Draco's bareback with the soft cloth. Draco flinched and stared at his husband's face, which was for some reason adorned with the flames of intense anger.
"Maybe the weather's cleared because the guy who loves you finally has a chance to be alone with you."
Draco kept his relaxed posture. He didn't want to give the impression that he was interested in the current direction of the topic of Terence's conversation. "Why do you say that? Aren't you the future ruler of Delion? You will be known as a King, not a rebel."
"I know, darling. I know..." Harry smiled again. He bent slightly to reach for a rose that was now lying on the wet grass. His armor stained with mud and blood from the people he killed in that war was a complete contrast to the pink rose in his hand.
"Please, have a seat. You want coffee?”
"Fine. I feel like I have a little sister. She is very innocent and cries easily," Draco said lightly, which managed to make a smile line Harry's face.
He had expected it. Suddenly, the street scene was more interesting than Ron's face.
"Please, just be my mate for tonight."
With the slowest and gentlest motion possible, Harry lifted Draco's pillow a little. The king’s stout hand moved quickly to reach for the book that managed to disturb his composure. If he remembered, Harry had never seen such a prominent blood-red book in Draco's library.
"Don't talk like that. You can't keep running from me," Hector tried to grab Draco's hand, but he brushed it off.
Draco looked at their faces one by one. They were all physically very human, but there was something different about them. Even though they were all tough, there were wise eyes full of depth of knowledge from them. Unlike Draco's earlier image, Ares' envoys were not barbaric and quite polite.
Vlad tightened his arms tightly around Draco's waist even more. "You're not going anywhere. Your place is here with me."
The man's big, strong arms held him until his hands felt stiff and sore. But Draco didn't give up; he struggled with all his might, scratching and biting his arm, which still felt as hard as a rock. He was panting, and his face was red with anger and shame because, as a man, his strength was so powerless to withstand the domination of his fellow male power.
"That woman is my husband's mistress. Her name is Arabelle," Draco said without being asked. He didn't want to let the silence suffocate him and the people who had entertained him.
"It's your own fault, why did you catch up with me at the crosswalk earlier?" he asked in such a harsh tone.
"Greetings, Your Grace," Draco said politely as he made a gesture of respect.
"It's still alive! It's still breathing!" Draco said, annoyed, and it seemed the blonde had started to forget that the other man he was currently talking to was a king everyone should respect.
“Mrs. Seraphina's body was too weak to grow a baby in her womb, and she could not conceive until the child was born. That fact broke Mrs. Seraphina's heart and made her physically weaker.” Alden sighed. "Mrs. Seraphina was getting sicker day by day until finally, she can't get up from her bed. One morning master Harry found her dead in her sleep."
he sighed.
"He's my wife. Only I can call him by his name. Call him 'Prince of Sparta'," Ares reminded.
The blonde let out another sob. Finally, Harry began thrusting in and out. He kept his motions shallow at first, before finally sheathing himself in and out of Draco’s hole over and over again. With a final sob, Draco came so hard that he blacked out. Harry’s orgasm came to the second Draco clenched down, and his cum spurted inside the long-haired man.
He saw Draco start to take steps to attack him. Draco moved so fast, Cedric had no other choice but to point his sword right at Draco's smooth, flawless skin.
The first thing he had to do was find a job because Draco had to survive. As before. Especially now that he supports himself and the child in his womb, he took a deep breath.
Out of the corner of his eyes, he could see the reddish blotches on his husband's chest. Now, Draco couldn't think positively anymore. After reading the highly erotic vulgar novel, Draco could tell that the reddish blotches were from Arabelle.
"Then, what are you going to do with him, Ares?"
"What happened to them?" Draco raised his eyebrows curiously. The envoys looked at each other, not immediately answering.
Doctor Jason was shocked. "What? Aren't you... Aren't you..."
"I love you," Cedric said firmly.
Was it Harry's enemy who wanted to harm him? Did they know he was pregnant with Harry's child and wanted revenge? Subconsciously, Draco hugged his stomach. His instinct directly moved to protect the baby in the womb. He then shook his head, trying to calm himself. No, Harry's enemies must have taken care of the matter before deciding to let Draco go. And the only ones who knew that he was pregnant were himself and Potter's personal doctor.
Glenice looked awkwardly at Draco, who seemed very curious. It seemed, Glenice had to satisfy her queen's curiosity.
Currently, their position was even.
"I have to go. Arabelle needs me," said Harry as he pulled his hands that had been holding Draco's back.
"But Ron, we've only been here a little while. It would be impolite to—"
"Look over there," Pansy pointed at the Gryffindor table.
Ares often uses it to kill monsters that try to pounce on him. As a god, Ares doesn't really like to use his god's power to fight. He likes sword arts. He likes throwing spears. He enjoyed the sensation of a torrent of blood splashing profusely from the veins of every enemy he slashed. The renowned Titan blacksmith forged the swords and spearheads he carried.
Thank you for the kudos and comments, guys! ❤
Icarus smiled. "This sword will appear when you need it. You just have to call for it. Say 'Excalibur' when you need this sword."
"Yes, yes! This will be a secret between us."
Harry glared at Draco. "No, yesterday's situation made you known as my dearest. People who target me will definitely target you because you are the weakest. It makes you always have to be with me, under my protection." Harry looked straight at Draco. "You are my weakness."
"If it were me, I would use my poisoned arrow and then let it die slowly," Athena informed.
"What do Spartans usually do when they party? It's not like Thebes or Athens. I thought you Spartans only knew how to war," Dion added.
When Draco looked at Harry, he can't help but remember their lovemaking last night flashed in his mind. Unable to endure all those erotic memories, Draco looked away. "None of your business,"
"Watch your mouth, Ares! Zeus has weakened!"
"Come on, honey, let's say goodbye to the host," Ron nodded at Draco, then tugged at his wife's waist to follow him.
"Lie down," Harry helped straighten the pillows behind Draco, then slowly laid Draco down on the bed.
"Where are you going?" Blaise asked as Draco chose to turn left.
"Now, I can do it without having to worry about someone else stealing my crown."
"Draco..."
"Are you obsessed with becoming an Empress?" Draco asked quickly without thinking.
Alden nodded, asking for an acknowledgment. “Hopefully, you can get rid of all the unnecessary grudges. For sure, I can guarantee that master Harry really cares about you. You need to know that master Harry is really serious about marrying you. He is currently in Italy, visiting Mrs. Seraphina's grave."
"That's my business, Aphrodite," Ares answered flatly.
"What do you think I want to do?" Harry threw down his shirt and stood naked in front of Draco. The man's body was extraordinarily beautiful, slender but firm with his muscles poking out, looking so strong. "I'm going to take a shower," Harry looked amused at Draco's surprise. "And you come with me."
It's a bedroom. A very feminine room with soft pink tones, almost white. Draco looked around the room and found something that stunned him… and paled.
"He's asking me a favor," Hermione winced as she rested her head against Ron's chest. The man was still lying relaxed with his eyes closed, enjoying quiet moments cuddling with his beloved wife.
Harry stepped faster. He even ignored Arabelle, who had a little trouble walking because the dress the young woman wore felt heavier than usual.
"Then let Draco be my lo—"
"Yeah, she's like an encyclopedia walking in there because she's almost the same age as Ares and has lived in Ares palace for a long time. You can ask her anything."
Damn that guy. He deliberately spoke his words in a sensual tone in order to influence Draco.
Suddenly Draco smelled a burning scent from his phone, and he threw it off spontaneously. Draco turned his gaze to Harry, who just stared at him flatly and then turned his back.
The man calmly removed his tie, his movements so slow but threatening that Draco unconsciously shuddered and inched away.
For God's sake, it seems the king no longer cares about the existence of etiquette in this palace.
Before Arabelle managed to open her mouth to answer Harry's question, the king's emerald eyes had already caught Cedric coming out of the royal guard training area while carrying a young man in his arms.
"Yes, I did save you," Harry muttered as if he could read Draco's mind. "But it's not for your sake. It's for my satisfaction."
"Allow me to guard Troya, my King. I will take him to a safe place and away from your enemies. He has already died once. We do not know what danger he will be in."
Draco couldn't help smiling at how excited Doctor Jason was. "Thank you, doctor,"
Harry sucked lightly on the tip, eyes never straying from Draco’s as his teeth grazed the tip as well. Draco sucked in a shaking breath. The blowjob he was expecting didn’t come. However, instead, Harry moved to spread Draco’s legs. Draco obliged to avoid falling over in the shower, placing a hand against the wall to keep himself steady. Harry then dipped his tongue into Draco’s crease, craning his head to get a better angle. His tongue ran across Draco’s puckered entrance.
Hyde. Harry had heard this name before.
"Oh, of course, because you want that power for yourself. Besides, I saw you were going to kill me, and I wouldn't let anyone do that to me." Draco's tone started to go up a few octaves.
This new plot will make those who read it angry and annoyed because I also feel the same LMAO. Harry really is an asshole and a fool in this fic. Poor Draco.
"Can I try it?" Draco asked curiously.
If he really lived in ancient Greece, he was pretty familiar with the stories dating back to that period. As a big movie actor, Draco played Eros, the God of Love and the son of Aphrodite, who fell in love with Psyche, the youngest daughter of a Greek king and queen.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco pulled his hand from Cedric's grip. He took vast strides toward the bird. The blonde gave a slight grimace as he lifted the defenseless bird with both hands. Cedric followed Draco and knelt beside him. The man's index finger moved to gently stroke the little bird's head.
One day, when Tom is as annoying as the plague that must be put down, Harry himself would take care of him. But not now, maybe Harry's reputation for cruelty made Tom very cautious about his actions. Harry wanted to see how far Tom was moving. Only then did he decide what to do with the trash.
"I like someone," Harry replied bluntly.
"Little boy, how about we also get to know each other? I'm Aphrodite," The Goddess of Beauty forced Draco to focus on her.
After a tremendous upheaval of heart and mind, Glenice finally decided to answer Draco's question. "I was thinking if His Royal Highness and his stepmother were having an intimate relationship, if not... they might have had sex before."
The carriage door closed, and Draco heard the sound of the wheels turning along with the grunts and stomping of the horseshoe. Draco banged on the door, hoping anyone would hear. Before Draco gave up panicking and burst into tears—something was heard climbing into his carriage.
Draco didn't turn around. The blonde, with all his might, tried to free his hand from Cedric's grip. "Aren't you tired of talking about this all the time?" He asked, sighing wearily as his attempts to free his hand from Cedric's grip were meaningless.
"As I said before, if I find you, you will never be able to run from me again. I will never let you go."
"Do you come here often?" Draco asked curiously.
"Trouble solved. Draco, give your horse to Glenice. You will ride with me. This way, we can get there on time," said Cedric.
Draco cursed himself inside, he should have been quicker, or maybe he should have hit Alden on the head with something so that the man fainted and could not call his friends immediately.
Harry just kept quiet and started joining Draco to watch movies. Draco chose to ignore the man and began to get carried away by the film in front of him. Draco finished the movie until eight. His mother still hadn't come home, and Harry was no longer beside Draco, who knows when he left.
The journey was tortuous and long. Draco's body was thrown roughly by Harry's bodyguard into the trunk and locked from the outside. Draco tried to kick, scream, and struggle, but he was exhausted and out of oxygen in the end. Realizing that this trunk space was so cramped and stuffy with the oxygen intake running low, Draco paused. He tried to calm his pounding heart, mixed between fear and curiosity.
"Where can I get Ambrosia? I mean—I don't know about immortality. But if I have to—"
Cafe Hogsmeade is a cafe owned by his friend, Luna Lovegood. They loved visiting this place because of its comforting atmospher. The atmosphere looks like it is in the forest with the scent of leaves, rain, and citrus.
"Draco! Please stay with me!"
"No, maybe it was one of Hades' experiments,"
“Since Mrs. Seraphina's death ten years ago... Master Harry changed, he closed his heart. And immerse himself in work. He's never been the same since then."
"What are you doing here?"
Draco's mind wandered over to those happy moments when he, his father, and mother gathered together at the dining table, eating breakfast with his loving father and mother. Lucius, his father, would talk about his business trip experiences, and his mother, Narcissa, would look at him with adoration. Everything feels so happy. Everything feels so perfect.
Seeing Harry starting to be provoked by emotion, Draco's hand moved to caress Harry's muscular arm that he could reach gently. He hoped the soft touch could reduce Harry's sentiments.
Now Draco was even more shocked. As if it was something that the immortal man often did. "Take me home right now! I will never love you!"
The maids immediately returned to their individual jobs. They did not want to linger under their master's tantrums any longer. Harry became even more confused by himself. Now his mood was twice as horrendous as before. He becomes very sensitive with anything related to Draco.
The night wind was getting stronger. The wind was competing to blow Draco's long, soft blonde mane. The sound of powerful thunderbolts began to shout at each other.
This was their first dinner. It was also their first official meeting as a couple. Ares chose his palace hall, whose floors were covered in shiny marble, as their banquet area. The God of War told the satyr to place a long table made of shiny volcanic rock. Draco sat there next to his husband, who occasionally looked at his wife curiously.
Draco was just pensive, trying to absorb Alden's words as best he could. Was Alden lying? But the other man seemed straight and honest. Draco just couldn't accept the image he had of his father had just shattered. If what Alden said was the truth, Draco would have to accept that his life with his father in a fairy tale was mainly a lie.
"What? Then why did you tell me?"
Instantly, confusion filled Draco's head. Right now, there was only one thing running through Draco's head, why do people who were in love always have irrational thoughts? He did not understand.
"But it's not even too late yet,"
Tired of seeing the crazy pair in front of him, Cedric immediately took wide steps towards the royal ballroom. Cedric ignored his brother as the king shouting his name in anger. Harry suppressed the anger that was currently holding him back. However, he had to calm the girl who was still sobbing.
Harry gritted his teeth, trying to hold back his intense lust, trying to defuse the urge to charge and sink deeply into the bottom of Draco's tight hole.
"What are you doing out here?" Harry narrowed his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
However, Harry's eyes still weren't on him. As if there was something more interesting to see than to see himself begging.
With care and gentle movements, Draco wrapped the peach-colored satin scarf around Arabelle's slender neck. As much as possible, Draco hid the dirty tracks so no one could see.
"Punish me if I'm wrong, but Ares is proven to have broken the rules. He made contact with humans by carrying his identity. I demand that Ares be punished!" Athena persisted.
"Mortal," he mutters mockingly.
"My name is Vlad, and I want you." A pair of fangs can be seen growing from Vlad's mouth. Sows terror to a Draco because Vlad looks abnormal for a human.
The sound of an open door suddenly filled the dim room, followed by a man's voice.
Alden nodded, recognizing that his master was about to explode with anger, and chose to leave instead of being scolded like this morning.
"About what?"
Harry shakes his head. "Slowly, Princess.
Draco looked around. A large room with a fluffy bed. "Heaven?" he guessed.
For some time tonight, Draco sighed again roughly. His head already starting to get heavy from thinking about it. He lifted his face again to look up at the sky, but unfortunately, before he could enjoy the beauty, his eyes were locked on the figure of a man who was standing stiffly in front of his tent while hovering his piercing gaze at him.
"Don't you know that coercion like that can be traumatizing? I want to live this marriage happily. That's why I ask you to wait until I'm ready," Draco said, sounding hurt. "And you agreed..."
"There's never going to be a time when you're really ready, Troya. The sooner we do it, the more fun it will be. You are lucky because I will be the first man to touch you. Most lovers can only enjoy it after a few times. But I'm not a teenager without experience. I'll take you to heaven." Ares did seduce while laying his wife's body which was currently weakened by some supposedly harmless touches.
"Now you're all right," Draco said, gently stroking the horse's head again.
Draco started thinking that if Icarus doesn't even know, he's in danger, how does Harry know he's in danger?
"Just ask," Draco said casually. He took a step back as Cedric urged him on.
"Sit down," Ares said again.
"Where can I find the star observatory tower here?" Draco asked.
Draco took time to smile at Natalie as their eyes met.
Draco swallowed harshly, an oppressive aura emanating clearly from the gaze of the man before him. "I do not understand what you mean," He said without the slightest trepidation.
"Can I find out the details of why this happened?"
But suddenly, someone bumped into his shoulder and just walked into the middle of the crosswalk even though the light hadn't turned green yet. From the side of his eye, Draco could see a car speeding up. The person who bumped into him was still walking. The hood they were wearing made Draco not recognize that person is a man or a woman. Though, from their posture, Draco could tell that that person is a man.
Draco stared in disbelief. He tried to free himself from Cedric's grip with all his might, but, for the umpteenth time, Draco's strength was nothing compared to the strength of the man who had spent a quarter of his life on a battlefield covered in blood.
Worst case scenario, he could be dead by the time Ares found him. He was lost in the mountains of Olympus. A place where human-eating monsters roam freely. When the monsters met the smell of humans—they would act like sharks in the ocean when they smelled the blood of their prey.
“Master Harry married in Italy when he graduated from college, at the age of 20. They are a young couple who love each other. As far as I know, master Harry loves his wife very much," Alden cleared his throat. "I had already started working for master Harry by then. In the past, She was a good person, very easy-going and friendly, but… Mrs. Seraphina was indeed weak from the start. She has heart disease with an imperfect valve." Alden took a deep breath as if trying to muster up the strength to tell a story.
"Understand,"
What's the story? What other surprises? Draco's heart skipped a beat.
Draco woke up to he senses the smell of grilled sausages and eggs. Without realizing it, he just walked into the kitchen. Draco stared at the breakfast on the table and snatched it right away. Without thinking, he finished it in just a few seconds. It felt like he hadn't eaten in days. His stomach was starving.
"How dare you embarrass Alden like that, and how dare you try to run away from my house," Harry's big hand gripped Draco's arm roughly and dragged Draco, who was trying to escape.
After a few moments, Cedric sat up straight. The man's hand moved gently to tug at one of Draco's currently intertwined hands. He gently stroked the back of the blonde’s hand. Cedric wanted to send a warm feeling on Draco's soft, cold hand.
"Master," Alden bowed slightly.
Harry and Draco continued to walk until they both finally settled their bottoms on a pair of throne chairs that were right next to the throne chairs belonging to the King and royal concubine of Delion.
"My plan today is to try to be close to you. I think as husband and wife we should spend more time together," Draco reasoned.
Draco managed to find a gap in the room where he could put his ear to and hear the conversation between Goddess Hera and his husband, though faintly. Draco had missed most of their discussion, but the boy kept trying to listen to the rest of their conversation.
"Then I'm even more worried about Draco," Hermione recalled Draco's plea to her. "He asked me to help him escape from the house. His eyes were so tortured, is it possible that Potter held him hostage in that house by force?"
Maybe it should be like this. Perhaps Draco and Harry should have taken different paths and parted ways with all the happy and sweet memories that remained at the bottom of his heart.
In the mythology he knew, the Titans were a group of early gods who ruled the earth. Kronos was the first ruler to eat his own children for fear of falling into power. Then Zeus, who his mother saved—arranged a plan to free his brothers who had been eaten—then took revenge. Kronos was defeated, and Zeus became the main God of Olympus.
Yes... that man must have been denouncing Draco as a shameless queen. Draco knew that.
"I got it first, Malfoy."
If he goes back to that house, then his chances to escape will disappear, Draco thought frantically. He can't go back to that house! Draco impulsively grabbed his head, pretending to be in pain.
Frowning, Harry sat on the edge of the bed and touched his fingers to Draco's forehead. The temperature was average; he had no fever. The wrinkles on Harry's forehead were getting deeper, so why did this guy say he was hot?
"Isn't the palace over there?" Draco asked confusedly as he pointed in the opposite direction.
Especially for the past year, Harry has been busy pampering his
"Did I say we were going to the palace?"
Draco closed his eyes and tried not to cry. He does not want to be an emotional man just because of the forbidden love that his brother-in-law was currently offering.
"No. It's better to ride alone, but I would definitely prefer to take the carriage if you are by my side. Your pretty face can definitely dispel my boredom." stated Cedric regardless of the circumstances around him.
A fist landed so hard on Cedric's face that the prince’s face turned violently to the side. He pulled his lips into a sinister smile.
Draco then ducked down to bring his face closer to Harry so that the man would see his eyes. Within this distance, Draco can admit that Harry has a handsome face. But there is a dark side that envelops him so that Draco should not know him any further.
The Satyr looked desperate and pale. It looks like he's been the Cyclops' toy for days.
Draco pushed Cedric's chest hard so that there was a distance between himself and Cedric. Suddenly, Cedric was shocked and was about to ask what happened, but when he saw Draco's calm face, a strange feeling gnawed at his heart. Didn't the young man feel a flutter when Cedric touched him?
Draco's silhouette took off his shirt, and his innocent upper body was reflected in the dark shadow with a seductive shape. Damn it! Harry started cursing when Draco's shadow in the window made a motion to lift one of his legs onto the bed and seemingly take off his trousers, then Draco seemed to run his fingers through his hair, making his beautiful long hair flutter with slow motion — according to Harry's vision.
Harry's eyes also moved to scan Draco's current appearance. It does not reflect the figure of a Queen who all the people of all kingdoms have glorified.
In one corner, the bartender was busy serving guest requests, and waiters dressed in black and white paced back and forth, offering endless trays of dishes and champagne.
There, he saw a pure white horse staring at him with a gaze shrouded in pain. Something's wrong with the horse. Without thinking, Draco stepped to approach the horse.
Draco turned his head to find Harry standing, relaxed, leaning slightly against the nearby window. The man seemed to have been standing there for a long time. He must have heard clearly all the insults that had been thrown at Draco earlier. Draco's cheeks blushed even more, embarrassed and humiliated.
Harry sat on the end of the bed Draco slept on. He wiped Draco's sweaty forehead, took the young man's hand, and carefully squeezed the limp hand. He brought Draco's hand in front of his lips, then kissed the back of the hand for a few moments before finally releasing the kiss.
"Looks like something has happened to His Majesty. We'll have to see him, Harry," urged Arabelle worriedly, then rose from Harry's lap.
Daddy!
"I care for him more than anything else, my King! But remember, we have millions of people. Your concubines and I also have dozens of children who must continue to live. Don't you remember the story of Tantalus? Do you want to see the kingdom of Sparta destroyed by God Ares?"
"Because I was the man who conquered the Goddess of Beauty, she said I was her best lover," Ares said. The sentence immediately awakened Draco to reality and his resolve.
"Leave that to me," Ron reassured the Alpha. "Anyone who dares to judge you as a freak—everyone knows who you are. You're an Alpha. Instead of judging you as weird like a lonely stalker, they'll be happy to accept your invitation without a second thought."
"Because Olympus is not a place for humans. The monsters here will immediately approach when they smell a human like you," said Alastair seriously, to which Draco nodded.
Draco felt the horse he was riding slightly galloping away from the other Titans. Attica did it on purpose when she wanted to talk privately.
5. As nouns, the difference between Nephilim and Demigod is that Nephilim is a race of humans mentioned in the old testament, described as being physically impressive and heroic, while Demigod is a half-god or hero; the offspring of a deity and a mortal.
The cheating couple had spent the night together. Aphrodite, as usual, visited Ares' palace when her legal husband Hephaestus was busy alone in his workshop making tools or weapons. Their affair was well known. Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love, was not shy about having more than one lover. Not only Ares; she also had a handsome human lover like Adonis. Her limp and unsightly husband was considered non-existent by Aphrodite.
"Like what...?"
Draco was surprised at the moment, though he tried not to show it. Maybe for ordinary ancient Greeks, the Titans were just talking about their home in heaven. But for Draco, who lived in the modern era, he also suspected something else. Did they just say that the Titans were an alien race?
Draco turned around quickly, his eyes widening slightly when he saw his husband was a little further away from his current standing position.
"Oh," Draco's eyes widened, just remembering something important.
"Aren't you going to get on the carriage?" Draco asked, confused.
"Come up," said Harry as he held out one hand to Draco.
"How are you feeling?" Harry glared at Draco.
»»———————————————««
Draco turned his head and stared in awe at the man who possessively wrapped his arm around Hermione's waist. He was handsome, with red hair, sky blue eyes, and pale skin. Hermione didn't seem to be kidding when she said that her husband was exceptionally handsome.
Draco took a deep breath, held his still flat stomach, and stroked it in a circular motion.
"All right, Cedric." Draco broke off as he turned his body and took a step towards the shady tree that had been attracting his attention.
"Relax, Ares just told us to wait. That doesn't mean we can't eavesdrop," Draco said. He tossed his beautiful hair to the side to make it easier to hear. Alastair just shrugged and sighed.
"For you to come back to my house after ten days. Otherwise, the tattoo will burn your wrist," Harry explained, and he immediately crossed the street without waiting for Draco to react.
"Draco," Harry's voice cut off Draco's words.
Draco widened his eyes, almost choking on his spit and half laughing. "You think loving someone is easy?" he asked. "Love is a process, and in the process, you will know whether you love them or it's just a pity."
"Abaddon would never have come straight down to Earth if it wasn't something he wanted so badly." Harry started walking toward Draco. "What's so special about you?" he asked, his voice started to intimidate.
Now, without a doubt, Natalie will also tell the world that the person currently sitting in front of her was the incarnation of an angel. Besides being beautiful, intelligent, elegant, well-spoken, and polite, Draco also has a very good heart.
"Not really. I thought my idea was ridiculous," said Ron cautiously.
"Someone once said," said the man after standing in front of Draco. His beautiful amber eyes were able to hypnotize Draco. "Flowers don't worry about how they will bloom. Flowers just bloom and turn toward the light..." He smiled. "And it makes them beautiful,"
After all, Draco had to remain gentle and polite to the man, even though he had openly forced Draco into a relationship these past few days.
Draco's words managed to shift the focus of the Delion's King from Harry and his mistress to Draco. Harry's legal partner looked so relaxed, there was no look of anger or disappointment on his beautiful face, and it made the King of Delion wonder.
"Bastard," Harry cursed with his eyes already brimming with rage when he saw that the white cloth around Draco's neck was now stained with bloodstains. Even the stains had soaked Draco's goose feather pillow.
"No. I've spoken to my ministers. This may all be a trick of my enemy. Ares may never have been involved in any of this. The Oracle, nor can it be found in any temple." The King of Sparta suddenly turned dense, he was still half-convinced, but hope shone in his eyes.
✧･ﾟ: ✧･ﾟ✧ :･ﾟ✧･ﾟ✧
Draco looked at Vlad with horror. He was sure that Vlad was not playing with his words. He's a crazy monster who's only obsessed with him. And Draco will be stuck with Vlad for the rest of his life because he belongs to...
Without waiting long, the King of the Delion Kingdom immediately rose from his throne. The atmosphere that had been boisterous because of the admiration of the ladies and gentlemen over Harry and Draco had now disappeared.
"Thank you," Draco smiled and looked at Arabelle as she was currently admiring Draco's embroidery.
"Ah! I forgot, Professor Snape asked me to see him tonight. You guys can go first," Draco stated, remembering his promise to Snape, which coincidentally saved him from this super awkward situation. "Bye." Then with lightning speed, Draco walked away from Blaise and Pansy.
The now gigantic vulture shrieked again and arrogantly flapped its wings, creating a strong gust of gust that knocked down many things around it. It then flew back to Alastair and stood beside him with a look ready to hunt.
When Harry intimidated him with the threat of throwing him at his bodyguards, Draco felt helpless, and he was furious at himself for being powerless against the other man. Draco has no idea. He felt as if the threats Harry was throwing at him weren't serious. Draco began to realize that Harry was starting — already obsessed with him. Draco doesn't know what kind of obsession Harry has with him.
Cyclops, different from the bull monster he met last time. They were much more powerful and troublesome. In addition, they were rare species that were not easily reproduced. Hades was always angry and asks for compensation if Ares kills Cyclops in his hunting activities.
Draco tried to grab the man's head by grabbing his soft black hair. But unfortunately, Draco's actions only made the man kiss his neck even harder. Gasping and desperate, Draco finally could only observe and feel.
Hector grabbed the prince's slender waist and forced him into his arms.
"Because?"
Draco stepped backward, glanced at the white door, and tried to get as close as possible, so when Harry acted out of bounds, he could immediately escape.
"Touch me wherever you like, don't stop..." whispered Harry excitedly.
"Well, Potter is infamous for being...cruel. He looks cold and stiff, but when disturbed, he is ruthless. Sometimes I get a little bit of sympathy for his mercilessness."
"Like Goddess Hera who supports her husband no matter what, I want to be like that too. I can help you. You can use me for anything. I have proven to your guests that I am probably the best chef on Olympus. But I'm sure I can be good at other things too." Draco made his point.
"Don't you feel lucky little boy? You can be in the same room with the main gods of Olympus like us, Ares and I Aphrodite. Then there is Eros, our son, the God of Love. Now you're even having a friendly chat with Dionysius," Aphrodite greeted Draco. She took Ares to their table because she was interested in the interaction between the two of them.
"If I get hurt, all you have to do is call a healer and keep it a secret from everyone. Easy, right?" Draco replied lightly with a small laugh.
"We're taking a short break. You can take this break to eat," said Harry without bothering to turn his head back and look at his group.
The young man noticed his reflection in the lake. Troya's physique was indeed very enchanting. Even though he wasn't wearing makeup, his golden blonde hair was also left loose and only combed with his fingers. His skin was flawless white, and his lips were naturally red like ripe apples. His eyes were symmetrical round with curly blonde eyelashes that make his gaze deep as if drowning.
Draco was embarrassed to hear that because Alastair explained the subject of women's bodies with a straight expression. Alastair could answer anything but Ares' personality. Alastair considered talking about his master without permission to be impudent.
The man turned his head back, and Draco realized another person behind Harry, a small and elegant woman.
Draco’s pupils dilated, and he whimpered. “Yes. Yes, I need it.” He cried, feeling embarrassed and humiliation spread across his cheeks.
Harry chuckled, approaching Draco like a lion stalking its prey. “I would never expect such a thing. I just wanted to get more of a taste of your milky skin.” With that said, Harry fell to his knees on the shower and slinked over, so his mouth was precariously close to Draco’s now half-hard member.
They were solitary creatures who easily get angry. They do not like crowds, so they choose to hide in caves in the highlands and stay away from humans. Sometimes, a group of hungry Cyclops no longer felt full enough to eat livestock and try to prey on humans.
"I mean the heater. Do I need to turn on the heater?" Harry asked, trying to keep himself from laughing foolishly. Indeed, his wife's flushed face and the look of surprise in his eyes were new to Harry.
Cedric understood. Draco accidentally reopened the old wound he had been keeping so deep. Cedric understood that the wound was still there today.
"You finished my breakfast?" asked a voice from behind Draco.
"My Queen, you are a woman. What do you know about war strategy? I will defend what is rightfully mine. I'm not willing to give in to an Oracle whose identity is unknown." The King has decided.
"My boss... He's—"
"Too bad, Ares, as long as I live, you will still be known as a pathetic loser god that no one wants. As for me? Well, have you heard that the humans in the city of Athens want to build a statue of me the size of a hill?" Athena boasted.
He didn't expect that Cedric, who he knew as gentle and very fond of jokes, actually had a rough figure like this. But... Draco should have guessed this already, considering Cedric was someone who was greatly feared on the battlefield.
Harry then flashed his triumphant smile when Draco was already standing beside him. Then no one spoke. They just stood still, staring straight into the distance.
Draco had just realized something. He moved his hand to touch his slender neck. When he raised his hand, he could see that the deep red bloodstain had already covered his palm.
"Yes." Draco nodded his head, clearly embarrassed. "I changed my mind. Do... Do I—we—still have time?"
"You!" Harry called to a servant who had been seen holding back her tears. If Harry remembers correctly, the servant was Draco's personal maid.
The man waited for Alden to close the door and leave the two of them alone, then said calmly. "Good evening, Draco." Harry smiled calmly. "Actually, I want to discuss matters relating to your twenty-third birthday..." His smile turned mysterious. "But then I realized that good talk would be of no use between us, so I'll get right to it."
"Yeah..." Draco replied quietly as if part of the sentence had been blown away by the night wind.
Draco took a quick glance at Harry's naked body, standing proudly beside the bed, his face flushed with embarrassment. They were there, red marks on Harry's chest, on Harry's hip, near his manhood. Did he do it?
"If you're sick of me, you should let me go."
After a short goodbye to Draco, Natalie grabbed her weak husband's hand for them to leave. She knew it would be a little rude for them to continue on their way, considering that Natalie's old husband had a mouth that she couldn't keep up with at times. Natalie was afraid that the words that would come out of her husband would hurt Draco's feelings.
And what he was worried about happened. Draco stumbled, his body tumbling into the abyss. His head hit a large rock until it bled. His body ached as if there were thousands of needles poking him and his legs were bending strangely.
Draco blinked absentmindedly. My Lady? He tilted his head in confusion, but then he followed the woman without asking anything.
"Your Majesty, if you and your
“I just wanted to find out how far you would pretend to act as if you're reading. After that, maybe you can realize how much sexual tension between us," muttered Harry calmly, not shifting an inch from his seat but looking so menacing.
Draco wiped his tears harshly and glared at Harry. "All this because of you!" exclaimed Draco accusingly. "If you don't involve me in your life full of enemies, I won't experience this!"
"Yeah, you’re right. I'm crazy because of my cousin's wife,"
"How is he?" Harry pushed his way through the crowd of nurses. The nurses in another room were seen chasing him because the wound on his arm had not been bandaged.
During this time, Harry had always kept himself away from any kind of interaction with any Omega. If necessary, he only interacted with them as necessary, and Harry ended the interaction first. He couldn't imagine himself lingering with another Omega and treating them as his surrogate mate. Although for a while, Harry felt it was impossible to do. Also, he felt like he was breaking his sacred bond with Ginny.
Anyway... Stay safe and healthy guys! Please take care of yourself. See you in the next chapter! ❤️
No matter how upset Draco's conscience was at the sight of the affair, Draco promised not to comment, let alone be angry about it. Ares was now forced to sit next to his wife to separate Draco from Dionysius. Draco looked confusedly at the War God, who was now hugging his shoulder.
"Troya, everything will be fine,"
Doctor Jason seemed to know that Draco was wondering. He shrugged his shoulders. "Don't tell Mr. Potter that I'm talking about him behind his back, okay? Until now, I still have goosebumps remembering his murderous look when threatening to kill all the doctors and nurses here if they don't save you," he stared at Draco regretfully. "Really, anyone who saw his behavior yesterday would have come to the same conclusion, that Mr. Potter is a boyfriend who loves and worries about you very much."
Pansy remained patient. It was a little difficult to be sensitive among those who were insensitive. "Potter
"Firstly, I have handed over a lot of treasures to the king of Sparta as a wedding favor. Second, we haven't even officially announced our relationship with the Titans. Third, if I wanted to kill you, why would I bother looking for you in the middle of the forest like this?" Ares explained.
"You are a Demigod... A Demigod who their God parent does not protect..." whispered Harry.
The servant's face turned cloudy even though Helios, the God of Sun, was in high spirits today. The boy sobbed. "Your Majesty, you should just run away." He said sympathetically.
Five hours later, Draco was face down on the mattress, panting after having just experienced his tenth orgasm at the hands of his greatest enemy.
"No?" Draco asked, feeling a little curious.
"I promised to hand him over, my Queen. If we violate our promise, maybe he will destroy Sparta and kill thousands of innocent souls." the man called the King of Sparta also mourned.
"I'll go first," said the female messenger as she ushered Draco away.
"She doesn't deserve to be side by side with Harry. I'll bet Harry will soon get sick of her and dump her." The sexy woman in black brushed her hair arrogantly. "As soon as he saw me, Harry would have liked me and threw that girl away."
Lucius' heart seemed to be filled with joy when he saw the worried and panicked look on his son's beautiful face. "And when that happens, everyone will make fun of you. Over time... you will be pushed aside and forgotten," He said with a satisfied smile.
Arabelle just stared in disbelief at Cedric. Was it true that this man was the same man who always gave her a scornful look full of anger?
One minute.
"I lost again to Your Majesty," said his maid while pursing her lips in annoyance.
Is that true? Did Ares really exist? If so, will he be tortured? It looks like it won't be that bad. Draco was sure he never remembered the story that Ares was an abuser, but he couldn't believe too much in mythology. What's even more dangerous is that if this turns out to be all a scam and he will be taken to a strange place—where he may be held captive by the enemies of the King of Sparta.
"Where do you think we are?" asked the man again with a dull face.
"Tom didn't do it all himself. He hired a very famous assassin in the underground, Hyde."
Finally, Draco could breathe a sigh of relief. Now, Draco felt himself getting sleepy and decided to go straight into the room to rest after turning off the television and washing his bowl. After cleaning himself and changing into pajamas, Draco lay down on the bed and fell asleep just like that.
"We have to take clean up,"
"Prince Cedric! You've gone too far!"
Lucius chuckled at Draco's words. His words reminded him of Narcissa—Draco's mother, who was very firm in her principles, but unfortunately, now the woman who had given birth to Draco had united with the earth and was slowly but surely, being forgotten by people.
"Arabelle, I don't understand what you're talking about," he said, which made Arabelle flinch and stare at Draco in surprise. "But, spots like that shouldn't be shown. It looks weird." Draco continued softly, tugging at the satin scarf that protected his neck from the scorching heat.
He was scared, truly scared. Even though Harry had freed him, Draco still felt that he was still not completely free from the man because of this baby. The baby that belongs to Harry
Draco's face turned pale, hearing that the god eavesdropped on his when he cursed harsh words. He felt like jumping and running to the wolves' lair because of shame.
"Yes, prince Troya. How are you going to punish them? They've failed to protect you." Ares confirmed.
Draco tried to think, and he had not checked the bathroom at the end of the room. There may be a way out of there that escaped surveillance. He quickly stepped into the bathroom, but his steps staggered. Somehow his head felt dizzy, and his whole body was shaking… Hot… What was this? Draco touched his forehead, it was hot.
Draco's jaw dropped. "Are you crazy?! If you want me to look like a woman, why don't you just find a real woman, not me!" Draco spat out angrily. His pride felt abused as a man.
Draco shivered, then he took a few steps back to distance himself from the pale-skinned man. "Fine, Potter, I can't just love you. It takes time and a process to love you. And not necessarily I can do that," Draco felt like he was explaining it to kindergarten kids.
According to his mother, only a few Demigods were living on Earth. Most of them lived with their God parents in Olympus. The Demigods who live on Earth are all wealthy and respected people because their God parents support their children's lives. But not for Draco. He only lived in a cheap apartment near the corner of the town.
After Draco grabbed the slightly oversized outfit, Harry didn't turn around. Oh, of course, Draco couldn't possibly ask the man to turn around so Draco could freely wear the clothes. By the way, the man had already shown his authority as a ruler.
"You too, be careful," said Cedric before the man took his long legs away from Draco and Arabelle.
"How long are you going to continue like this, Draco!?" asked Cedric sharply.
"Are you okay?"
"Then, are you going to let her keep crying like this?!" interrupted Harry in his already rising voice.
How will he hold himself accountable in front of his father and mother later?
Suddenly Harry raised his hand. "Of course it can. Demons have a strong appeal, and angels have never tasted worldly things that demons can offer."
Draco bit his lower lip. For a moment, his heart hesitated. Draco needed clothes right now, considering he wasn't wearing anything under Harry's thin robes. Besides, he was also feeling cold right now.
"M-My boss... S-Someone killed him. I don't know who, I'm still in the store. Please, I'm starting to panic," Draco tried to say what he could.
Draco straightened his chin defiantly. "Because of who?"
"Thank you," Draco nodded and accepted. Then he gulped down the contents a few times before giving it back.
Does this maid know what happened last night? Draco had even tried to wear clothes that covered his entire torso, neck, and lower body. Yes, as soon as he went into the bathroom to clean himself, Draco thought it was his upper body that Harry had so many marks on, but it turned out that his guess was off. His lower body was covered with kiss marks and bites by Harry, especially his inner thighs. It made Draco couldn't stop feeling ashamed of himself and swearing at the other man.
"Prince Troya," he called, but Draco chose the faster way. "Do you hear me?" Hector said again.
"What? I don't think so. Why would we do that?"
Draco stared for a long time at Potter and Cho, who were sitting next to each other. So close that Cho would occasionally steal opportunities to hold Potter's hand. Draco was sure he saw Potter uncomfortable, and he hoped it was
"Where's Louis? Get him!" Draco shouted out his manager's name. Again, a foreign language came out of his mouth. He also felt a strange horror, as if he had become a different person because even the voice he heard was not the same as his own voice.
All need sacrifice. Of course, the price was high. But Draco felt it would be worth the satisfaction he would get later. The satisfaction of killing the man in painful torment, as he did to his father and mother.
"Thank you," Draco said.
Flames burned in Harry's eyes, and it was clear the man was trying to hold back. "Whatever, meet me in my study room later." His voice was more like a growl, then turned back furiously.
At that instant, his burly bodyguard let go of Draco, almost knocking him out from the exhaustion of struggling. They stood face to face in the eyes of the many waiting people. Harry was still standing with a cold, expressionless face as he rubbed his cheek, where Draco had slapped him.
"Thank you, Duke Richmond. You look very handsome tonight too." Draco praised sincerely.
"His first dance is mine. I'm his husband. I deserve it."
"Pray to the wise Athena, my son. Ask Athena to protect you from the cruelty of Ares. You are the most loyal servant of Athena's temple, and I am sure the Goddess will not neglect you." The Queen of Sparta said so while sobbing.
Cedric tilted his body and supported his head with his own hands. Cedric looked at Draco from the queen's hair to his toes with a playful look. "Shouldn't I be the one asking that, Your Majesty? What are you doing, hm?" Cedric asked, restraining himself from bursting out into a loud laugh.
Harry muttered to himself. Now he has to have dinner with his sweetheart.
No! He couldn't wear the dress, which was tantamount to acknowledging Harry's control over him.
Everyone knew exactly what Arabelle's position was in this palace. She was the mistress of their own king. Everyone also knew very well that the king had always spoiled Arabelle. Still, they couldn't understand. How could the girl run around and smile happily like that?
Harry stared in disbelief as he saw his wife now in the arms of his own cousin, Prince Cedric, and the disbelief grew even more when he saw the fresh blood already soaking his brother's hands and… his wife's shirt.
Draco looked to his left and found a large golden door. Curiously, he opened the door handle. It seemed difficult and stuck, but then after Draco tried a few times, the door opened easily, with a creaking sound from the hinges that hadn't been oiled in a long time.
"No... It's... It's itchy. It's itchy." Arabelle whined and gripped Harry's oversized shirt as the young man again wanted to scratch his skin roughly.
Ron and Draco both frowned. Harry went overseas?
Harry nodded his head, feeling ready because of anger. Tom and the psychopathic killer, whoever he may be, and anyone who dared to hurt Draco, his possession. If they decided to confront Harry, then they had chosen the wrong opponent.
Cedric didn't know whether he should be happy or sad because he had again managed to become the first person to see Draco's various expressions.
Amid his nervousness, Draco continued to walk gracefully. The older man's bored gaze didn't make Draco take his eyes off the older man. He kept looking at the older man.
"I won't bother you," Harry raised an eyebrow at Draco's doubtful look. "I won't bother you, Draco." the man repeated his words. "I won't even get up from this chair,"
"No need! I mean—it was an accident, and I'm fine. I don't want to punish them," Draco shook his head quickly. He felt sorry for the envoy. They all looked tired and hurt. He must be fortunate because he just sprained his leg while the tough Attica now appeared with her hand broken and bandaged.
"Look at him. He's gone mad."
Ares couldn't say that to Troya—the Prince of Sparta who had only been his wife for a few days. The young man did not work with his approach. There was something about him that was strange and different. As if he was not part of the humans living in Greece.
"Why are you looking for me, Prince Cedric?" Draco asked. He straightened his back like a typical nobility.
Draco realized what would happen next. Ares gave him a deep and passionate kiss. His fingers were a little rough from swinging the sword frequently—combing Draco's hair while occasionally applying pressure that emphasized his power over Draco. The young prince gasped, and his breathing sped up. It was as if he had been stung by something that made his ripe and inexperienced body turns hot. Even though today the night was quite cold and the wind was blowing hard.
"What is this?" Harry's voice sounded offensive.
Harry smirked. "Then why did I save you from him?"
A frown of displeasure appeared faintly on Harry's forehead when he heard the answer. For some reason, Harry's anger was boiling when he heard that answer.
"You sound emotional, Ares. Do you still hold a grudge against me since the Trojan war, where Diomedes managed to injure you so badly?" Athena purposely annoyed Ares.
The firm voice of one of the palace guards who was right in front of the door of the Delion Kingdom's hall filled the room, which for some reason suddenly became silent. There was only the sound of the orchestra welcoming the arrival of a perfect couple of Kings and Queens of the past decade.
But Demigods mostly possess extraordinary powers, unlike ordinary humans. For example, Hercules has extraordinary strength, then Perseus, who has the same strength. It's the same with Achilles. As for Draco? An ordinary human who works in a bookstore. He started to doubt his Demigod blood.
Even though she looked unsure, the maid nodded, then bowed slightly and walked out of the room. Draco could breathe a sigh of relief now. He lay down on the bed, then closed his eyes and fell asleep.
"I heard that you said you wanted to marry a prince, and I just found out that the prince is my devoted follower. What's your plan, Ares?" Athena probed.
There's no answer.
"Athena!" Zeus was angry at her impudence.
His mother chuckled and went back to doing her cooking. The excuse was genuinely childish, but at least the answer tricked his mother.
They weren't always on Olympus. Their people were scattered throughout Greece and even in other countries. They were called the Titans, with Zeus as their leader. The Titans formed their own communities and mingled with fellow Titans. Sometimes they also interact with humans and act like ordinary civilians.
Harry closed his eyes in annoyance as the dirty thoughts began to take over him. Not wanting to be tempted any longer, Harry immediately hooked a hook in the form of a satin string to the hook hole in the back of the tunic.
"Forgive me for disturbing Your Majesty and Lady's leisure time, but I would like to speak to Lady Canterbury alone." said the crown prince while staring at Draco's silver eyes that had bewitched him for a while.
Harry stared back at his reflection in the mirror in disbelief. Did he really do this? He was frequently involved in inner struggles for carrying out ideas that he thought were both reasonable and unreasonable at the same time. Harry tried his best not to think about Ginny, who was probably very disappointed to see him do this.
Draco glanced at the mansion. Harry hasn't been around since this morning. The man had gone somewhere early since then, and Draco didn't dare ask Alden. Draco should be happy. He frowned at the thought. But somehow, he wasn't happy. It feels suffocating and depressing. And Draco was holding back tightly at the emotional impulse that made him want to cry.
Today was the day that the entire Shinia Kingdom entourage prepared for their return in the next two days. Everyone was getting busy, Draco was as busy as everyone from his kingdom, but he still made time to sit in the Delion Kingdom library and read a book that caught his attention.
Ares led Hera to a closed room and asked Alastair to stand guard outside with his wife. By now, Draco had put his ear to the door, but he couldn't hear anything. Disappointed at not being able to listen to the drama that seemed to be exciting, he sat down on a granite bench at the front of the room, propping his chin up. He yawned because he was bored and sleepy. At the same time, he was worried that Ares would be angry if he went to his room first. Draco still had a hard time understanding Ares's fickle temperament.
After Hagrid left, Draco immediately lay down on the bed which was still comfortable enough to sleep on. His body was very tired. The journey, which took almost eleven hours, made his body, especially his buttocks hurt because he had to sit for hours.
"Have you forgotten that hurting the wife of a king is strictly forbidden? You could be sentenced to death by beheading for your actions," declared Harry coldly as he shifted his gaze from Draco's droopy eyes to Cedric's face.
The frenetic atmosphere made Draco squint his eyes. He didn't like this crowded and suffocating atmosphere. He missed his room, a quiet, peaceful place where he could sit and read while listening to soft music. This booming music was almost beyond his tolerance, it felt like he would leave this place, but he couldn't. That man, that evil man — according to the source, Draco heard that he would be coming to this place in a few moments.
The picture was very similar to Harry's late wife. Draco's chest tightened at the realization.
A second later, Draco's body slammed through the surface of the pool and sank. He didn't try to save himself, letting his body sink deeper into the pool. His eyes darkened and closed, and who knows how much water he swallowed. His breath was tight, and his lungs felt like they were about to burst.
"It's all right, doctor. Being sad is a normal thing for me…” Draco smiled bitterly, then put on a sour face, and grabbed his stomach. "Ouch,"
After struggling to walk back to his room, Draco chose to clean himself over and over again because no matter how many times he showered, Draco still felt his body dirty. Very dirty. Draco could never forgive Harry, nor could he forgive himself. However, Draco felt ashamed of himself, considering that he had drifted into Harry's desire. What happened all night, Draco could not erase from his memory.
Harry turned his head and caught Draco watching his body. His sensual gaze radiated, hot, and passionate. But then he found Draco's eyes circling all over the bathroom.
Had Draco said that Cedric was the most feared knight in this kingdom? Although his ability was still below Harry's, Cedric's brilliance on the battlefield can not be doubted.
After wrapping the scarf around Draco's neck, Harry pulled himself a few steps away from Draco. The man stood up and stared at Draco's calm face with an intense gaze.
Luna was still giggling. "Tell me what you saw,"
"I heard the people of Olympus rarely eat chicken. I was just experimenting," Draco responded politely. He then explained the cooking process.
"That woman is Seraphina Potter," Alden mumbled dryly, staring deeply into Draco's eyes. They were now sitting in the room at the back of the house, which has direct access to the back garden and was equipped with beautiful, comfortable couches and a table that currently serves hot steaming coffee on top of it.
Draco just sat on the white chair in desperation because, after a long period of walking around the room, checking every corner of the bathroom and the windows, there was still absolutely no opening that could be used as his escape route.
ridiculous," Blaise rolled his eyes.
Alden bowed, and he walked out of the room. Harry then proceeded to get back on his papers for a while. He'll check on Draco when he's done. Harry couldn't wait to carry out the plan he had prepared to conquer his lover.
Harry frowned in surprise. "What? What idea do you mean?"
Harry repeated his mistake. He got back into a relationship with his other former lover.
"Prince of Sparta, they will escort you to your room. All your needs will be taken care of by the Nymphs," Alastair informed. Several nymphs, who were almost entirely attractive in their clothes, exposing their bodies, approached Draco.
Draco was surprised and blinked a few times. Really, he didn't mean to make Harry uncomfortable.
"I thank all the guests who have taken the time to attend the welcoming party of the Shinia Kingdom's entourage. Hopefully, this party can entertain the Shinia Kingdom's entourage. It can also create even closer relations between the Delion Kingdom and the Shinia Kingdom." said the King of the Delion Kingdom, whose hair had almost turned white in a loud voice.
Draco had accidentally looked at the channel history when he was watching a gossip show. Draco felt that what the host said was ridiculous. They discuss artifacts from the past, examine shapes and images that resemble humans dressed as astronauts, and conclude that aliens have come to earth thousands of years ago and claim to be gods.
Draco felt his eyes become heavy, and he couldn't feel his body from the waist down. The last thing Draco remembered was a hand reaching to him, and then he was knocked unconscious afterward.
I hope you liked the chapter xD
Since Draco was born as the only descendant of the Malfoy Royal family, Draco was destined to marry and become the queen of the Shinia Kingdom. Draco's father had neatly arranged everything. Of course, Draco, who was obedient, wouldn't refuse it because his father always said that it was for Draco's own good.
Draco could bear it all, but not his mother. His mother from childhood used to wallow in wealth, like a princess. Even until she married his father, Lucius used to treat her like a queen, with many servants surrounding his wife. Narcissa was devastated when she was forced to cook by herself with those fragile, unskilled hands — because she had never cooked in her life. And it gets more and more devastated when they get poorer, suffer more. Finally, the suffering was unbearable for his mother. She started getting sick, getting thinner, crying more often on lonely nights. Then one morning, his mother just died.
Everyone fell silent, including Harry, and then professor Trelawney showed them a sketch. "Is this what you imagine? Has an ugly face and horns?" then she turned the page. "Or a demon’s face with angel’s wings?"
"Ah yes, sorry in advance if this question sounds rude. But... Are you sick? Your hands feel so cold. I can even feel it even though I'm wearing gloves," Draco looked at Charles worriedly.
"Near the cliffs, there are a lot of beehives. He entered the wolves' area. I saw him about ten minutes ago when this damn Cyclops swing me around,"
Harry frowned. “Did you mean by
Draco clenched his jaw when he saw his father walking back in his seat with a smug look on his face.
"Draco," Harry interrupted and stared at the beautiful man deeply. "You know I will never leave you," the man's hand turned to touch the petals before cruelly crushing the rose in his palm.
"Alastair is the only demigod here," Attica added.
"Hey, is it okay if we tell this?" Alastair reminded.
Draco started cleaning up the spilled cereal, and when it was all clean, he poured the cereal back into the new bowl. Harry was still watching him, and Draco acted as if he didn't exist. So Draco started turning on the tv and watching his favorite movie.
Draco was awestruck that he has never had anything so cool like this. He glanced at Icarus with joy, and Icarus simply smiled. It was as if he had just given a present to a child who was crying because his ice cream had fallen.
The middle-aged man with a wise gaze shed tears of emotion. He wore a robe and leather armor, a sword attached to his iron belt. Draco just stared at him in confusion until a sudden headache hit him.
When Harry moved, Draco moaned. All of this was too good to bear. He couldn't reach his consciousness any longer, almost frustrated that his body had finally given up on Harry's whirl of passion. Harry lowered his head, kissed the corner of Draco's lips possessively, declared his possession, and plunged himself deeply.
"The point is, don't even think about approaching his territory, not even us demigods dared. He lives in the underground of Olympus and does many secret things that even Zeus doesn't know," Alastair said.
Draco was not sorry about everything that had happened. Instead, he felt grateful. Because with all that he went through with Harry, he is now a strong person. He became a person who could survive alone, without any support from anywhere.
He threw the glass bottle vigorously at a rock in front of him. It didn't take long, the clear liquid that filled the bottle had now spilled over the stone and the grass beneath it.
"General Hector has a point. In legend, a god like Zeus simply chooses and goes to the human he likes. They are gods! They can do anything!"
Draco uttered the words in his mind like a spell with trembling steps as he approached Harry, who was waiting for him like a king. He placed the glass on Harry's table.
"Well, that might be true," Zeus admitted.
When Draco just nodded, Harry landed another slap on the top of his ass, sending Draco another high-pitched yelp. "Understand?" Harry growled.
"It goes well,"
Draco frowned pointedly. "And what did I do to you, dear Mr. Potter?"
Draco ventured to face the man. And that is a big mistake. He saw those eyeballs gleam horribly in the middle of the darkness, a fiery red color.
The man still covered Draco's mouth. "Shut up," he said. "If you want me to let go, promise not to scream anymore, or I'll sew your lips," he commanded.
Luna smiled. "I think he likes you," she said, and it literally made Draco almost laugh out loud if Luna didn't close his mouth quickly.
"You like the clothes?"
The young man began to worry that his relationship with the War God would deteriorate. He didn't want to be neglected in the circle of the gods alone. He didn't have enough supplies to face the Olympus forest.
From where he was, Draco could see the guards cheering with joy as they stared at him. It seemed like Cedric had already informed them of his willingness. He replied to the guards with a charming smile and a very graceful wave of his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
The smile that had been adorning Draco's face was slowly fading away from his embarrassment. The queen's smooth forehead was filled with faint wrinkles as he found a bluish patch on Arabelle's neck, which happened to be exposed.
They returned to their feet around the garden, and during the tour, only Draco and Natalie spoke. The King of the Delion occasionally chimed in, while Harry ignored their conversation and always had a frown on his face.
“H-Harry... Please...” Draco sobbed, feeling the tears spilled over.
"This place is beautiful and... awesome," Draco said.
Given their current relationship was a secret, Cedric also invites the young man to travel to the forest. Cedric understood very well that Draco liked the outdoors.
Draco embraced him, using his strength to draw Harry's body against his own as they kissed. He felt the heat of Harry's release as he spilled inside of him, the body in his arms jerking in aborted deep thrusts as his hips stuttered helplessly. Draco still had a significant erection, but he knew it would be painful if he came again. He was far too overstimulated to continue, so instead, he lay beneath Harry, breaking their kiss as the other collapsed atop him, breathing harshly.
“Should we order that many clothes? Didn't you say you won't retain Mr. Draco any longer?"
Thank you for reading. I hope you guys enjoyed this revealed chapter. Kudos and comments are always appreciated <3
Draco didn't want to turn his body and look at Cedric because he knew he'd be indecisive again.
"Yes, Ares. You have a chance. You are the only child I gave birth to from my relationship with Zeus. If indeed one of Zeus' children will take his place, I hope it will be you." Hera said seriously.
"Your Majesty, can you pull the hook?" Draco asked as he looked at Harry behind him.
He then lifted his ass from the chair he had been sitting on for the past three hours. Before he left, Draco took the time to bow slightly to the crown prince.
Papyrus can only be obtained through transactions with the ancient Egyptians. It also goes through months of voyages, and usually, only poets, healers, priests, and philosophers use it. In the court of Sparta, papyrus was used when kings made important decisions, regulations, or announcements. But Draco instead wasted it, making the diary and scribbles less meaningful.
Ares then grasped his hair and played with it. Draco flinched because even if it was just a brief, harmless physical contact, it could actually make his heart pound. He doesn't know if he can build resistance against the War God's existence.
"They must have thought nothing of it. Your reputation and His Majesty will surely be disgraced," Arabelle looked into Harry's eyes worriedly.
"No. If I'm hurt, I’ll always try to get that woman out of the palace." Draco said confidently, taking a step forward which made Cedric take a step back. After all, he had no intention of hurting Draco.
Glenice's answer made Draco's eyebrows knit together, "How did you know?" Draco asked, glancing at her.
Everything was fast; Draco didn't have time to run or panic because suddenly Harry's bodyguard, the biggest one, grabbed him roughly, picked him up, then slammed him on his shoulder like a sack of rice.
Draco screamed inside.
Draco continued to stare at the couple until the man hugging his woman there accidentally looked at Draco. Draco's glazed and dejected eyes locked for a few seconds with Harry's. They continued to stare at each other until finally, a booming sound of thunder made Draco break eye contact.
At that time Draco realized that he was not in his room. Everything felt strange and dark because all the windows were covered with thick curtains.
"Yes. We made you our bet."
Draco just realized, the young woman who seemed to be acting as his servant spoke in a foreign language. Somehow, Draco could understand. It sounds like Greek. Draco concluded that this prank show was set in ancient Greece. Although not as accurate as the general description recorded in the maestros' paintings of ancient Greece, Draco admits that the producers of this show were pretty serious in working on the setting.
"I'm not young anymore. My body isn't aging, but my mind isn't as bright as it used to be. One of my children may have to take my place at Olympus." Zeus explained.
Draco's already reddened face was getting redder. He felt very ashamed of the wild thoughts that had previously filled his head. How could Harry want to spend the night with him? He already had Arabelle, a mistress, ready to satisfy him at any moment.
"Draco!"
"Potter," murmured Icarus.
When Daphne dressed him up, Draco was too tired to make even the slightest disobedience. He didn't even ask anything earlier when Alden escorted Daphne to his room, and the woman suddenly dressed him.
Draco was even more confused by Arabelle's words. His eyes that had been staring at Arabelle's long neck also moved to his personal maid, who was currently staring at Draco with unreadable eyes.
Alden nodded his head. "Daphne has prepared him from an hour ago," Alden bowed, then opened the door for Harry.
"What do you want?" Draco asked disapprovingly when he heard the crazy remark Terence had just said.
"Watch yourself, General Hector! If the king finds out about this—" Draco spoke a little loudly. The maid looked restless.
"Everything, he should know everything. That will set him free as well as set you free."
Harry fell silent. Alden's words were so tempting. He returned to the room, driven by the intense feeling to see Draco again. Draco was still stretching and groaning on the bed when Harry sat beside him. The young man stared at Harry with his misty silver eyes, as if not recognizing him.
And noise in Draco's ear got louder and louder until he felt it in his brain. He closed his eyes and endured the pain. It's like someone forced their way into your brain, but you're trying to block it. The pain was so intense that Draco grabbed and squeezed Harry's hand.
Draco could see the vampire's sharp fangs sticking out through her lips. Other people certainly couldn't see the fangs, of course, if the vampire didn't want it. But not for Draco. He could see the immortals who were considered mythology to humans.
Narcissa chuckled at her son's ridiculous behavior. "Now, what do you want me to make?"
Not long after that, Professor Trelawney walked in with some of her drawing books. Of course, this is not a drawing class, but professor Trelawney really likes to show her works depicting mythological creatures. Draco was always amazed whenever she showed them the drawings as if she had actually met these creatures.
"Gotcha!"
"What's wrong with you? Are you sick? You're acting weird," Harry stared intently at Draco.
But reality hit him hard.
"Is he the human who is said to be the most beautiful in Greece?" Aphrodite looked furious.
Never in his life had Draco done anything like this. However, despite how he was sure to feel in the morning, Draco knew he would never feel more satisfied after a session of sex than he did at this moment.
"Yes... what a pity." Draco said absentmindedly.
When their eyes met, her laughter disappeared instantly, and there was not a smile. Because of intense curiosity, little Draco walks closer to her to ask why the girl stood alone and laughed for no reason, but the closer he got, the more the girl lowered her head. Then suddenly, the girl lifts her head to show a big smile with two fangs appearing in both corners of her lips covered in blood, and both eyes widen as if her eyeballs want to come out of her head.
"What is it?" asked Harry, confused by Arabelle's behavior.
"So, all of you are demigods?" Draco asked.
Harry cleared his throat before he opened his mouth. The man also ran his eyes towards the dense trees, which looked less extraordinary than his wife's lips.
Cedric understood it was a difficult thing. So he would always be by the side of his loved one, assuring him that he wouldn't hurt Draco as Harry had done before.
Her cry grew louder. Harry couldn't do anything but gently caress her back, which was already shaking violently from her cries, and whispered soft words in the ear of his mistress.
"You are the wife of the king, especially now that we are going to travel to the other side of the kingdom. What do you think they will think when they see you in the same carriage with another man?" Harry asked sharply.
Draco simply replied with the word "Oh," and let Harry walk beside him. People are now paying attention to Draco, not because they think he's crazy or anything, but Draco thinks it's because of Harry. The people staring at Harry were girls who seemed fascinated.
It was the most beautiful dress Draco had ever seen. And again, what the hell! Harry told him to wear a dress? Has that man gone mad?
Draco jumped when the voice sounded nearby. Terrified, he turned to find Harry over there, sitting on the sofa not far from the bed and studying Draco.
"You're a married man, in case you forgot, but you visit a young woman instead of your wife every night. And what's worse, no one knows what you've done with that
The smile on Harry's lips was a cold, triumphant smile. "Then come here, my darling." The man opened his arms, and Draco stepped hesitantly toward him. With a sensual gesture, the man grabbed Draco and briefly kissed those pink lips. "Good, don't test my patience. I don't want to be challenged tonight."
This must be a dream because before going to bed, Draco lay restlessly, trying to erase the memory of his love affair with Harry that seemed to have always appeared in his mind. And because this is a dream, it never hurts to enjoy.
"Duh, of course,"
With his face still hardened, Harry pushed open Draco's door with a grunt. However, when Harry's feet had stepped on Draco's room, the man immediately remembered that if someone was sick in the room, he shouldn't make a fuss.
Harry took a shaky breath. For some reason, the attention his own brother had for his wife disturbed his peace of mind.
"No! The party's over! Everyone should go back home!" Ares commanded in annoyance.
"Very funny." Harry snorted in annoyance. "Where are we going to look?"
"Looks like she needs you, Your Majesty," Draco told with a meaningful smile and gently pulled his hand from Harry's shoulder. Harry nodded firmly with his eyes now filled with a shimmer of happiness.
"Hades allowed me to come back here, my dear. With an arrangement that I will return to his place again together with Aphrodite to be a friend for lonely Persephone." Harry turned his attention back and staring at Draco, who was already crying silently — too scared to run away.
"So you don't want to?"
Harry tried to remind himself again. The barrier was there, the density as if trying to keep Harry from entering it, and Harry pushed forward, claiming what was his.
In many mythologies, it was said that Ares often could not stop himself from being present directly in wars between humans. He also threw the spear and swung his sword. He so enjoyed taking the lives of humans that he was reluctant to use his divine powers and chose to fight with weapons forged by blacksmiths. He didn't want the war to end.
Harry tightened his jaw even more. This was one of the things he didn't like about Draco. The blonde always put the kingdom above anything else. He stared at Draco and Cedric with furious eyes before the king’s legs moved to kick Cedric's stomach and left the room violently.
Harry pushed him roughly against the door, and to his surprise, Draco could feel Harry's hard-on pushing firmly against his back. He wanted to move and dodge, but it turned out that Harry was already pressing him on all sides.
"If I forbid, won't Prince Cedric sit here?" challenged Draco.
"He can help you escape, so you don't have to go to Olympus," said the maid anxiously.
"No need," Harry's lips tightened in a thin line. "You better go, Rouvas," said Harry coldly, then he turned around and stepped into his mansion with Draco in his arms, shouting at Alden to quickly call a doctor.
The young woman’s stepped quickly towards the royal garden. At this time, because the royal palace was crowded with guests, she was sure that her man was now in the garden behind the castle. The garden was definitely quiet because only the royal family can enter it.
Alden nodded as if he could read the question in Draco's eyes. "Well, we've been watching you all along. The small house you shared with your family at that time was one of the properties belonging to master Harry. Everything was arranged so that your life is fine even though your father was bankrupt."
Ron was silent for a moment and frowned. He thought hard a second time. Harry watched his Beta closely.
She kept crying and continued to cry on Harry's chest. Of course, this made Harry confused. The king could only move his strong hands to stroke Arabelle's back, which was shaking violently. He hoped it would make Arabelle feel better.
"I'll escort him," he said to the servant.
Harry's expression turned cold. "What's wrong with Tom Riddle?" he asked.
"Se… Sex?" Draco asked haltingly, with his face already flushed with embarrassment. For some reason, Draco's cheeks turned red just by hearing those words.
"Have sex with him?"
"She has returned to her palace,"
"Would His Highness Draco want to dance with me?" asked the king with a smile and stretched out his left hand in front of the young man, Empress Draco, while the king's right hand was hidden behind his burly back.
"How is he, doctor?" Harry looked away and stared at Doctor Jason, who was still standing beside Draco, checking Draco's IV.
"Well, you understand that even with just a glance, it's easy to notice your resemblance to..." Alden stopped his words, noticing Draco's blank stare. "Are you all right?"
"What's your name?" Draco asked.
Draco raised his eyebrows, interested. Harry never asked for anything. The man is used to order, and then when it is not being obeyed, he will force whatever he wants.
"That is a lie, my King! There has never been anything like this before! A real god doesn't need to ask a human for permission to marry a human!" Hector tried to convince his King.
"His Majesty is confused. This drink will make him better." Draco saw the 'Healer' approaching with the earthenware bowl. The disgusting potion he stirred with his wrinkled bare hands earlier was likely to be drunk on him.
Doctor Jason's body collapsed to the floor because of the gunshot. Harry looked back, saw Doctor Jason collapsed with the knife still in his hand, and he then turned his head toward the door, towards Alden, who was holding the gun in his hand.
"Have you tasted the chicken?" Draco returned to being cheerful.
"Okay, thanks for the ride. I'll take my leave now," Draco said, then walked toward the exit.
"I'm fine, father," Draco answered gracefully. He started to guess when the emcee would appear and end this prank? He just realized, if this was a television prank, there must be a camera. He was also worried that his appearance and makeup would be wrong to invite protests from his fans. "Where is the mirror?" he whispered to the young woman who seemed to be always beside him.
"You can ask him directly," Attica responded.
"You have the right to survive incidents that may occur in the future, no one knows. I could dump you tomorrow or ten years from now, or maybe I'll never let you go. So, I agree. I guess I'll have to reassess you one more time. Are you more than a beautiful body with a rose scent? Do you deserve to be kept in my palace after you turn unattractive and boring in my eyes? This sounds cruel, but since you seem serious—I won't underestimate your intentions either. I ask you one more time, Prince of Sparta. Are you seriously going to support me more than just my bed partner, be my tool and ally? That means you might become one of the assets of the War God, like the Amazonian knights." Ares responded.
Draco studied his body. His legs are normal, head and hands are smooth, there are no scars at all. Wonderful.
The black-haired woman stared in shock as she saw the man who had been the focus of her gaze suddenly disappeared from the dance floor. The dance floor was now filled with Empress Draco, the man's wife, and seems to be having a short chat with the guests.
"What?" Ares raised his eyebrow at Draco.
Harry also got up from his chair. "I'll walk you outside," he said.
"Now, put on these shoes." Daphne put a pretty gold shoe on the carpet. "Then I'll walk you down. Mr. Potter is waiting downstairs because the party's getting started."
"Thanks for your time," Harry bowed and took Draco's hand. He kissed the back of his hand gently.
Harry's eyes lit up Draco's pale face with a sharp and unfriendly gaze. Oh, come on, Draco was just expressing his opinion, but why did the man act as if Draco had committed a fatal offense?
Cedric raised his eyebrows high when he heard the words Draco had just said. While he saw the fire of sincerity burning fiercely in Draco's eyes, he realized that Draco wasn't playing games right now.
"I didn't say I agreed. But I wanted to give it a try," Harry replied. "If I don't find the right person, then what?"
It felt like Draco wanted to laugh out loud. Harry asks Draco to love him even though he doesn't know him, and now what? A man claiming to be his guardian angel? This world is exceptional.
"Calm down, babe. I might hurt you," Harry held Draco's hips with his hands as they were moving, inviting him urgently. "But I promise, after the pain, you will feel pleasure." He said.
"He's only human. What kind of damage can he do? Why are you so angry with me? I've made more mischief than this. Why now?"
Draco was just about to open his mouth to say "winged, horned creature". But Draco keeps his tongue from commenting any further. Then he walked out of the house irritated. That man asked Draco to love him, but how could Draco love him if his attitude was annoying.
