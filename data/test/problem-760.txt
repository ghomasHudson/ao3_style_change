“Yaxley said you wished to see me, my Lord,” he said quietly, looking at the floor. He didn’t want to look up. Every fibre of his being told him not to look up. The Dark Lord hummed and Draco heard the rustle of robes – one of the men next to him cried out in pain.
“We can’t go charging in, mind,” Granger said contemplatively, winding a finger around a curl of hair as she thought. “We’ll have to get a plan together. We’ll need your cloak, Harry,” she said and Potter nodded while Draco turned to him in confusion.
“He had found your location in Dalby Forest and he was going to tell the Dark Lord. And my mother – she sent me a coded message telling me to run. I left with the help of a house-elf and came looking for you, to
“No. Not this time,” he admitted and Potter blinked, stretching. His eyes closed again and Draco thought he had fallen asleep once more when his breathing caught and his eyes blinked open, a lot more lucid then they had been a few seconds ago. “What happened?” he said quietly, his voice raspy. Draco lifted a glass of water and helped Potter take a sip, bracing his back with an arm. Potter slumped back against the pillows, wincing. His lightning scar was livid against the pale skin of his forehead.
Harry was still kneeling by his body as Draco took a few shaky steps into the room. The Shrieking Shack was silent around them, abandoned thoroughly by the Dark Lord and his Snake, and all that remained was the shell of the man who had been his most trusted servant.
Draco blinked, his eyelids feeling heavy. He blinked again, feeling like he was having to drag his eyelids upwards. His vision blurred and crossed and he let out a shaky breath.
“Come on, up you get. I won’t let go, I promise,” he said quietly and Draco believed him. Still half-blinded by tears, he allowed Potter to help him get out of the sleeping bag and then guide him, barefoot, across the clearing to the big tent. It was warm inside and Potter ushered Draco to sit on the edge of one of the beds in the sleeping section. “Lie down, okay?” he said and Draco let himself slide sideways to lie down. The bed was a lot comfier than the ground sheet and sleeping bag had been, and he sank into the mattress. Potter shuffled a little bit to sit next to him, still holding onto his wrist. “Go to sleep. I’m right here. I’m not letting go,” he murmured as Draco shut his eyes and drifted away.
“There were forces at work, Draco, that you were not aware of. I did what I had to do, and I –” He stopped and cleared his throat, as though some emotion had just become lodged there. “I would do it again, if I had to.”
Hermione was waiting for him just inside the atrium. Her hair had fallen mostly loose of her bun and she was trying to tie it back again, three bobby pins gripped between her teeth. Harry smiled at her and she rolled her eyes.
Draco slipped out of his mother’s hold once more and joined his father. Potter’s eyes flicked over to him and Draco tried to communicate without speaking. He would not betray them. He would lie and deceive and even lay down in front of his father if it gave Potter a chance to escape.
"Well, that changes everything," she said, raising her wand again and flicking it in the direction of the wall covered in writing and it all vanished. "So we need to narrow down the families to those whose children left them," she waved her wand again, and all the files in the room flew into neat stacks in the centre of the room. Ron, who had been leaning against the wall, nearly toppled over as the file he had been holding flew out of his hands. "Right… let's eliminate those families that had no survivors after the war," a flick and a few files vanished, the piles shrinking. "And those who had survivors, but they all ended up in Azkaban," another flick, more files disappeared. "We should now be left with surviving families who have “free' members, as it were," Hermione explained, slipping her wand away into her robes. Lune reached forward and plucked a few files from the top of one stack, and the others began to help themselves, Hermione passing Harry a few as well.
Harry shut the floo abruptly, and hauled himself to his feet, staggering slightly. He felt sick and dazed, and it was only with a vague notion of what he was doing did he force himself to leave his office and head straight for the Auror's cubicles. There was a ringing sound in his ears.
The group of students who were hiding here were nursing various injuries. One girl with a nasty scratch down one side of her face had an arm in a make-shift sling made from a Ravenclaw scarf. A boy, a few years younger than Draco, stood but favoured one leg, the other balanced on his tiptoes – every shift in weight made him wince. Hermione was looking as well.
They stood in silence for a minute and then Potter blinked at him, a small smile creeping across his lips.
“How do you think you did?” Hermione asked Malfoy, who looked up in surprise. He was dressed again today in a well-tailored navy suit, which brought out his grey eyes, turning them from silver to storm. Harry blinked and looked away.
He nodded, stepping out of Harry’s arms, numb to all else but grief. He did not look back as he ducked into the tunnel they had crawled out of. The castle grounds were still and silent around them and despite the early hour, even though dawn was fast approaching, the darkness seemed thick and impenetrable.
The passageways wound through the castle, taking them further and further away from the kitchens. Dobby and Draco were silent as they walked until they reached a heavy wooden door.
Hermione screamed from behind him and Draco turned to see a giant spider trying to climb through the hole the blast had left. Ron and Harry shouted spells at the same time and the spider flew backwards into the night. Harry ran after it, peeking out into the chaos beyond the walls of Hogwarts.
From around them, the train's whistle sounded, and everyone started to scramble to get on the train.
“He wishes to speak to you, alone,” it told him solemnly and creaked open again. Draco rolled his eyes and turned on his heel, back up the spiralling stairs. He didn’t bother to knock on the door this time, just pushed it open and Snape looked up with a frown as he entered once more.
“How much do you know about You-Know-Who’s origin?” she asked and he blinked at her. She rolled her eyes and waved at him to sit down. He slung a leg over the bench next to the dining table and sank down, listening. “Harry knows, he told u– me. He and Dumbledore explored some memories that Dumbledore had collected through the years. You-Know-Who was born to a witch mother, and a Muggle father,” she said and Draco felt his jaw go slack in shock. The Dark Lord was a
Malfoy was sat down on the bed, staring ahead but not at anything in particular. He had shucked his shirt, but held it balled up, loosely in his hands, and Harry took a moment to watch where the moonlight from the window caught against Malfoy's pale skin. He looked lost and very alone in the darkened room. Harry shook his head, forcing himself to stop staring, and walked further into the room, startling Malfoy a little who looked up at him with wide grey eyes.
“Scared, Malfoy?” he asked in a slightly teasing tone and Draco could have nearly cried but he took a deep breath instead.
It was only when Malfoy was firmly inside and Harry had shut the door, did the reality of the day hit him.
“I figured as much. My Mark burned most of the night,” he interrupted, not wanting to think on those minutes of fear, squeezing Potter’s arm so that he realised that Draco was still holding on to it. He changed the subject. “Hermione’s asleep. She wanted to wait until you were awake but she was falling asleep standing. Do you want me to wake her?” he asked and Potter glanced over his shoulder at the closed off area where Hermione slept. He hesitated but then shook his head.
Draco dropped the piece of paper back onto the bedside table like it had burned him. After a summer of being held at arm's length by Severus Snape, Draco wasn’t sure he wanted to sit in his office, with tea and biscuits, and discuss his ‘Head Boy Duties’, whatever that entailed.
The oak door creaked again and this time the room fell into a still hush. A rustling sound met Draco’s ears before he even saw them approach, and then the Dark Lord was entering the room, his long robes dragging along the ground behind him, his awful great snake slithering along next to him. Aunt Bellatrix entered behind him and practically skipped to her seat as the rest of the table rose to a stand, some Death Eaters struggling to keep their balance. The Dark Lord paid them little attention as he took his place at the head of the table. He did not sit.
“I’ve been practising my dives! I’m going to be on the team this year,” the third-year promised and his father clapped him on his shoulder. Sasha had been sorted to Gryffindor, like all other Weasley kin, and Draco was sure the house Quidditch team mainly consisted of them now.
“Fuck you, Malfoy,” Potter snarled and Draco stepped forward and pushed him back, hard, both hands on Potter’s shoulders. Potter went staggering back into a tree behind him and Granger gave a yelp of dismay.
’ indeed,” a fifth-year scoffed. His father had been sitting at Draco’s dining table when Burbage had been killed. He clearly hadn’t been told.
“Headmaster Snape bids you to enter,” it intoned gravely and then it moved aside, revealing the moving staircase. Draco gestured for Isobel to go first and she did, tossing back her head of chestnut hair and striding forward. Draco, rolling his eyes once more, followed her.
“Madam Lestrange,” Tom murmured reverentially, tugging on his forelock as Hermione approached the bar.
“He’s digging a grave. For Dobby,” he added and Draco’s eyes stung with tears again. Bill gave him a once-over. “You’re Lucius Malfoy’s son, aren’t you?” he asked and Draco let out a wet-sounding laugh.
“I seek a treasure, Baron,” Draco finally said. The ghost’s chains clinked as he moved slightly. “A treasure that I believe another has cursed. Did you know Tom Riddle?” he said and the Baron’s eyebrows rose. His doublet was spotted with darker marks that shone iridescent in the light from the fireplace.
It was easier to stay in his room. He had his own books and trinkets, and he could bar the door to intruders with only a whisper to the wards. He often dozed off in the armchair by the fireplace, or on the window seat overlooking the Italian gardens – he had found that his bed no longer felt like a sanctuary, given how often someone had woken him up by banging on the door and scaring him awake. At least if he fell asleep in a chair, he was upright. And even if he did manage to fall asleep in his bed, he was plagued by half-remembered nightmares and constantly thrown awake by his own anxiety.
His mother embraced him on the platform and Draco squirmed a little, but let her have this comfort. “I shall write,” she murmured into his ear, before pulling away. “Especially about Albert. I know how much that peacock means to you, and how old he’s getting. If anything happens, I’ll let you know,” she said, loud enough for their minders to hear, and any frown on his face Draco wiped away in an instant.
“I don’t imagine it will be very warm overnight,” she said, as if pointing out a small curiosity, and he shrugged one shoulder.
. “Do you not leave that Manor these days, Draco?” she asked as she looped an arm around his. “Don’t you think he looks pale, Blaise?” she said to their other shopping companion and Blaise just quirked an eyebrow.
“Where’s Harry?” he shouted desperately at Ron, who gave him a terrified look. They stopped at the sound of a shout nearby and turned to watch as Bellatrix began another volley of curses with Hermione, Ginny and Luna. A Killing Curse streaked past Ginny, the air around her hair flaring green for a second, missing her by inches.
“What was that about?” Weasley asked, jerking his chin towards the kitchen where Bill was now holding the door open for Fleur.
“So you think it’s a cult?” he asked and Draco looked at him blankly until the tips of Weasley’s ears flushed pink and he looked away.
“It’s in the dungeons,” Potter said, his voice measured and clear. “You enter through the wall. It’s full of skulls and stuff and it’s under the lake, so the light’s all green.” There was a short pause while the Snatchers reflected on their answer and Draco jumped in.
“It says Ig– Ignotus, I think…” she murmured, reaching up a hand to brush off the stone again as Potter straightened, jamming his hands into his jacket pockets.
They landed in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky which held the night’s first stars. Stone cottages with thatched roofs lined either side of the lane and Christmas decorations twinkled from the windows. A little ahead of them, the golden light of Muggle streetlamps indicated the centre of the village.
"He's upset. He has a right to be," Harry said quietly. From her chair, Ginny's eyebrows shot up, but she didn't say anything further. Strangely, she had been one of Malfoy's most vocal supporters when they were divorcing - she argued that he had needed help rather than punishment.
The sun had barely risen by the time Draco was packed. He turned on the spot and Disapparated with a crack as the first rays of dawn broke over the horizon.
“I’d rather be in control of all my faculties, thanks,” Draco interrupted him blandly, and Snape inclined his head. They sat in awkward silence for a long while.
The Gryffindors talked as they walked, and Draco let the sound wash over him. Back to Hogwarts he went, a place he had run away from over 6 months ago. A place he fled in fear and he was now returned to with a purpose. Find the Horcrux. Help Harry defeat the Dark Lord.
He unfolded himself from the alcove and ran for his rooms. It didn’t matter that the house was empty, Draco couldn’t have walked if he tried. His legs and lungs burned as he rounded the corner into the East Gallery and by the time he had shut his bedroom door behind him, his eyes stung.
"Dad!" he shouted as he fell forward out it's hold, scrambling towards Harry desperately. Harry reached for him and pulled his son to his chest, half-intent on absorbing his son into his body. Hermione let out a sob next to Harry, and Ron reached over to cup the crown of Albus' head in his hand, soothing back his hair comfortingly.
“Why should we trust you?” Potter asked and Draco blinked at him. He and Potter had been meeting in dreams for months now, surely Potter had learned to trust him. But maybe Potter didn’t remember his dreams? Maybe he had no recollection of what they had spoken about in all this time.
“You’re going, aren’t you?” he asked quietly into the silence of the corridor. Harry nodded, flexing his hands at his sides.
“It won’t be. We’re going to have to fight. We might have to… We might have to kill along the way. But that’s what we need to do to end it. We’re the only ones who can do it,” he said and Harry let out a shaky breath and then pulled away slightly.
“No, I rather thought I’d just like to stand here instead,” she told him sarcastically and Draco rolled his eyes. He was not going to get into a spat with the Head Girl on the first day of term.
It was a beautiful thing to behold. The moment was broken by Granger finishing her work and tilting her head down to meet his gaze, which made her frown.
“Maybe. But I think I feel ready now. Whatever my father did to me… it’s in the past. I won’t be like him to our child,” he said firmly and Harry smiled at him.
Harry was directly across from him in the circle now as the final piece clicked into place. Draco gaped at him and Harry only smiled as his eyes met Draco’s for a second.
“There are always whispers. I don’t believe anything I hear these days,” Draco told Blaise, who slumped back on the sofa, long legs kicked out in front of him. They slipped into silence. Around them the common room was humming with activity, friends reunited after a summer apart, first-years trying to find an out-of-the-way corner where they wouldn’t be eaten alive by the older students, Crabbe and Goyle watching Draco darkly from near the bookshelves. It was suffocating, claustrophobic. Draco pushed himself out of the armchair, and Pansy’s eyebrows shot up into her hairline.
“You found it alright, then?” Draco said, closing the book and standing, putting the book down where he’d been sitting a moment before.
“I need to get a book from the library. I’ll see you in Charms,” he told them both, not looking at them, before walking away briskly. As he passed the group of Hufflepuffs, one of them started to sob in earnest, and he turned his face away, hot shame flooding through him.
After the feast was over and the plates were cleared, Snape dismissed them to their common rooms. Draco was pleased to see that a sixth-year Prefect, Dougal Lithgow, took the lead in shepherding the first-years down to the common room. He went ahead, ready to tell the others the password as they came through, Pansy and Blaise next to him, Crabbe and Goyle following in their wake with a menacing air.
“Yes, just the snake,” Hermione said in a small voice. “But – Draco -” she began and he held up a hand to stop her.
“What’s your name?” Greyback snarled, crouching over Potter so that Draco couldn’t see his face. He kept his face neutral as he knew some of the Snatchers were watching him, his mind racing to build a convincing lie.
“Dobby does not know where Harry Potter is,” Dobby said slowly, as if weighing up his next words. “Headmaster Snape asked all house-elves this, and none knew where Harry Potter is. But if Master Draco wishes to leave Hogwarts to find Harry Potter.” He paused then, the corners of his mouth pinching as though the words were a struggle to say. “Then Dobby will help Master Draco leave – in secret,” he added in a whisper and Draco gaped at him for a minute.
!” and he watched as her surprised expression slackened as she crumpled to the floor. His father barely managed to take half a step forward before Draco hit him with the same spell and then he went down as well, leaving both of his parents now facedown on the floor.
“We need to get him inside,” Granger eventually said and Draco nodded. “I’m going to use a Hover Charm, we can’t lift him like this. Can you get the bottom bunk ready?” she asked and Draco left her to it, disappearing into the tent. It was warm already, and he took a second to look around this familiar place, in a way glad to be back in it, before going to the bunks and drawing back the blanket on the lower one. The tent flap moved and the floating body of Potter came drifting in, Granger right behind him. Draco stepped out of the way as she lowered him down onto the bed, and then drew the blanket up to his waist, leaving his chest bare. He was much quieter now, though his eyes still rolled and he let out a few gasps.
There were howls and cackles and screams, and Draco was buffeted by a strong wind that had been called down by someone, but it felt like a light breeze to him. He breathed and flexed his fingers and found that, strangely, he was not panicking. He was calm. Everything around him felt fuzzy, like he was trying to touch something underwater, intangible and fleeting.
“No fire tonight. Just in case,” she said with a smile, but her gaze flicked up to the clearing around them and he nodded. The snow deadened any of the typical noises of the forest, and it felt like all his senses were heightened because of it, straining to find noise when there wasn’t any.
“I’ve been to my aunt's vault once before,” Draco told the goblin, who gave him an unimpressed look. “I visited with my father, as he was her trustee during her incarceration. I know how to get in. You can’t stop us,” he said and the goblin had bared his teeth at Draco.
“No. Let her rest,” he said and Draco leaned back in the stool as they lapsed into silence. “She was speaking Parseltongue, Bathilda. It’s why she didn’t want to talk in front of you and Hermione. It would give her away,” he said and Draco nodded.
“They’re definitely in there. Nowhere else they could be,” one of them said gruffly and his companion made a small noise of agreement. Draco strained to hear them talk. “How do we get in, though?”
“You tried to kill Dumbledore,” Potter growled at him and Draco bobbed his head in acknowledgement. A sudden lump formed in his throat as he thought again of that night, all the pain and terror and then that blissful, excruciating hope that had been snatched away.
“Yes, Dumbledore’s dead,” Harry replied, still calm. “But you didn’t have him killed.” Draco looked back, frowning.
“Oh, Harry! Let’s have a look at you, come on,” she said, letting him go and pushing him to stand an arm's length away, studying him. “You look very tanned,” she said and Harry shrugged a shoulder, letting his backpack drop into the spare chair next to him.
“Will you come home with us?” his father asked, hopeful, and Draco turned to watch as a pair of Aurors slipped into the room, scanning the Hall. Their eyes lit up when they spotted him with his family and one nodded in their direction, the other following.
"Off home, Mr. P?" she asked, tutting at the quill as it jotted down what she had just said. It crossed out the last words it had written apologetically.
“Weren’t you found with this rabble? How do you not know?” he asked and Draco was about to reply when the drawing room door opened once more and he froze. His Aunt, her hair unkempt, strolled in, her head held high.
Hermione had told him weeks ago that Potter loved him too. The thought still gave him a hot thrill, and he tried to tamper down the flush on his cheeks as he opened his eyes and directed the spell.
“Harry is their friend. He's also their teacher. A lot of these students were in Dumbledore’s Army with us, they trust Harry and they want to help him,” she explained. Draco frowned.
"Did you speak to Rose?" he asked, as the memory of their conversation sprung into his head. Hermione nodded.
“Bought it from Dung ‘bout a year ago,” Aberforth said, straightening up. “Albus told me what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you,” he explained and then Ron made a small excited noise, stepping away from the window and coming further into the room.
He had an escort to Platform 9 and ¾, though Draco was aware that it wasn’t a guard of honour. The Death Eaters that flanked his parents on either side had their hands casually positioned over their wands, ready to hex Draco if he tried to make a run for it. They surely didn’t trust him to get on the train and go to school.
“It feels like it, a little. But I do believe that it’s getting better. That we are getting somewhere. Who knows?” he asked, shrugging one shoulder. “Lovegood might’ve given you some very valuable information, it’s just wrapped up in a children’s story,” he said and Potter nodded.
By the time they reached Bellatrix’s vault, sopping wet and a little breathless having just fallen 60 feet, Draco was about ready to go home. The Transfigurations that Hermione had placed on Weasley and Draco had been washed away in the Thief’s Downfall, along with Hermione’s Polyjuiced form. Thanks to Harry’s quick thinking, Bogrod, the goblin that was leading them down to the vault had been Imperio’d once more, and with some trepidation, Draco watched as Harry pressed the goblin’s hand to the wooden door of the vault. It melted away at once and they stepped gingerly into the vault, which was dark and cool.
“It’s true. I Disarmed Dumbledore that night on the Astronomy tower. And in turn, Potter Disarmed me, when I joined him and Granger in November,” he explained. His mother pressed one trembling hand to her mouth as Draco perched on the edge of the table in front of them. The elves had gone back to the kitchens after waging war and there were platters of sandwiches and flagons of pumpkin juice and mead lining the tables now. He couldn’t bring himself to eat, not just yet.
“No one,” Harry said confidently, and Dumbledore nodded once, satisfied. “I’m going to keep Ignotus’ present, though,” Harry added and Dumbledore smiled. Draco huffed a laugh and Harry glanced back over his shoulder at him, his eyes catching the light and sparkling.
“Potter?” he murmured into the darkness, not seeing him silhouetted against the tent doorway. There was no reply. Draco kicked off the blankets he had piled onto the bed, and slid off the top bunk, stumbling towards the doorway. The jar of bluebell fire had been left in the snow, the blanket nest shucked and Potter was nowhere to be seen.
“Honestly mate, if someone had told me at Hogwarts that you’d become a proper boffin after school, I would've laughed in their face,” Ron said, shaking his head, and Harry grinned.
They entered towards the back of the Great Hall. The four long tables were crowded, and students sat in travelling cloaks, lined on either side of their house table. Some looked sleepy, some were crying. Only Slughorn looked up as Blaise and Draco slipped in, and his expression was one of confusion and fear. McGonagall stood in front of the High Table, her voice carrying over the students.
“It’s – too – dangerous!” Ron yelled after them but they were already soaring down, Draco’s stomach lifting in that familiar rush of air. Goyle was perched on a fragile tower of desks that lightly smoked and Harry dived and Draco reached out a hand –
He stopped there, feeling his mouth quirk in a smile. He set the letter aside and scribbled a note off to the Librarians asking for anything they might have about aboriginal and colonial magic, and then pulled ‘
's rose up around them. Hermione pressed a hand to her mouth as Rose and Hugo leaned out of a window to wave, and Albus and Scorpius joined them in their compartment, leaning out of the window as well. Ron gave a sniff and waved back, while Harry reached for Draco's hand and laced their fingers together.
News rolled in throughout the morning. Imperiused people up and down the country had come back to themselves, those few Death Eaters that had escaped the battle were fleeing from the country or being captured, the innocent were being released from Azkaban and returned to their families, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt, who had only gripped Harry’s hand in a firm handshake once before leaving, had been named as Interim Minister of Magic during an emergency Wizengamot meeting.
“What is he doing here?” he asked, pointing an accusatory finger at Draco. Draco, who had heard Hermione crying at night though she never mentioned why, sniffed.
Screams and yells of delight rose as Harry ducked through the door into the room beyond. Hermione and Ron followed and Draco could hear their names being called and then he stepped out.
Dumbstruck, he turned on his heel and marched away, back towards where Pansy and Blaise were sitting, the Gryffindor left behind as blood thundered in Draco’s ears while the word pounded away in his head.
“ROOKWOOD!” Percy bellowed from behind Draco and then he charged away, disappearing into the skirmish.
“It would be,” she said quietly, casting Potter a nervous look. His jaw tightened in response. “If we hadn’t promised to give him the Sword of Gryffindor in exchange,” she said and Draco’s jaw dropped, before annoyance crashed over him.
"Just up ahead," Draco called back to them, and a wave of sound went through the Aurors. They seemed to fall into some sort of line formation either side of Harry, like a ripple behind him. They reached the top of the stairs and Draco led them right, through a narrow wooden-panelled hallway. The corridor was draped in cobwebs, but there were tracks on the floor - something had been dragged through here.
Hermione finally righted herself and pulled her beaded bag free with shaking hands as Harry joined them. He had his arms around himself, his wet hair attempting to spring free. Hermione pulled a bottle of the essence of dittany from the bag and unscrewed the pipette, letting a few fall to her hands first before passing the bottle along. They all hissed as the dittany healed their sore hands and faces, and Harry set the bottle down next to him on the grass as Hermione pulled out some bottles of pumpkin juice, handing them round, and then some clean, dry clothes.
“Dandelion and Burdock?” Hermione asked, wrinkling her nose. Malfoy cracked open the can and poured it into the glass, but he only shrugged.
’ of Weasley trying the wireless. Hermione gave them a look as they entered and then ducked back behind her book, smiling to herself. Draco settled himself onto a bench by the dining table and picked up one of the books at random, flipping it open and trying to focus on it, but he couldn’t, not with Potter being right there, sat on the other armchair, giving Draco the occasional glance.
The next morning started the same as the one before, though Mipsy wasn’t in the kitchen with a cooked breakfast for them. Harry, a little sleep-deprived from his early morning study session downstairs (though he had gone back to bed about an hour after Ron) burned a slice of toast on the Aga and scrapped as much char off as he could before lathering it with butter and marmalade while he waited for the kettle to boil, listening to Ron’s off-key singing from the shower upstairs. Harry was, in truth, very impressed that he could hear it at all, but judging by Hermione’s eye-roll as she entered the kitchen, her hair tied back in a bun today, she was used to it.
!” The spell came before Draco could even blink and his wand was whipped out of his hand, flying in an arc for Potter to catch. He gaped as Potter snatched it out of the air and stood, brushing down his jeans as his glasses caught the firelight, the lens flaring gold for a second. His jeans were stained with mud at the knees and his jumper was fraying at one of the sleeves cuffs, but Draco had never been happier to see anyone in his life, even if he had just taken Draco’s wand.
“Drop your wands,” she snapped, and no one moved. “Drop them or we’ll see exactly how filthy her blood is!” Draco let his and his mother’s wands fall to the floor with a clatter, though Weasley and Potter didn’t move. Bellatrix growled at them. “I said,
“It’s just Hermione,” he said and Draco nodded, though he didn’t feel much comforted by that. Hermione, shorter than both Harry and Draco, was now on a height with Draco, Bellatrix’s wild black hair streaming around her face in the early morning sea breeze. She came up to them and opened her hands up at her side, as if showing them something.
“Blood traitor!” she screeched and he shrugged one shoulder. “When the Dark Lord learns what you have done Draco, he will –”
"Thanks. He's been missing that bear all summer," he said with a small smile and Draco nodded a little.
Draco’s feet left the ground now and he was carried upwards by the rising mound of burning gold, and he gasped with pain as a pendant burned his collarbone. He didn’t notice he was moving until he was forced to follow the avalanche of silver and gold into the outer chamber, somersaulting into the cool air of the underground caves, landing on his side and panting.
“What? Oh, oh yeah!” he said and McGonagall rolled her eyes and waved her hands in a shooing motion.
“The picture, Hermione, it’s the thief, the thief who stole from Gregorovitch!” Draco’s eyebrows shot up. The wandmaker? How did Potter know about Gregorovitch? And who was this thief? He stepped forward again as Potter turned back to Bathilda. “Please! Who is this?” She just stared at Potter in response.
The motley crew wound their way up the cobblestone street to the white bricked building that stood out brilliantly in the grimy dawn. It was not ideal. With the addition of Travers, Draco could not feed information to Hermione while looking like a curious foreign guest, and Harry could not communicate with any of them. Draco felt a tug on the back of his robes which he was sure was Harry letting him know he was there, but there was no way to check.
“We should probably order. We need to be back in an hour or so,” Hermione said, glancing at the slim watch on her wrist. She reached for the menus in the centre of the table, and handed Harry and Draco one each. Harry took up the menu and shielded his face from Malfoy’s questioning gaze.
A fire was already roaring in the elaborately carved-stone fireplace, two serpents coiling around carved pillars on either side of the mantle, and Blaise and Pansy had claimed prime seats, already deep in conversation as Draco approached. He lowered himself into the armchair opposite them, leaning back into the plush green velvet.
“That makes sense,” he said and then he asked the question he had wanted answers to, ever since Potter landed on the forest floor, “What were – what were you dreaming of?” he asked and Potter frowned at him, shuffling down in the bed a little, tugging the blankets up and hissing when the fibres brushed the new mark on his chest. Draco let him settle, not wanting to interrupt his thoughts.
“I’m not attacking you for it, Harry. All I’m saying is, you could be kinder. His subject of study sounds interesting, ask him about it?” she suggested, just as Malfoy reached the table, the glasses balanced in his grip. “Thank you,” Hermione said with a smile when he put the pint of coca-cola down in front of her.
’ and was just turning to look at more when Granger called out again. Draco rolled his eyes, half-expecting it to be another false alarm, but then she said “They’re here… right here,” and even Potter jogged over, his face a picture of hope and grief.
Neither twin could tell the adults what his actual plan had been, but Draco had hazarded a guess. "He wanted heirs. I denounced the Malfoy name years ago, removing myself as heir, so it dies with me. He probably thought he might be able to convince at least one of the boys to come around to his way of thinking," he said through clenched teeth when they were at St. Mungos, where the boys were being monitored. Harry gripped his hand next to him, and smiled slightly.
"The Headmistress reported them missing not five minutes ago, Sir," he said, with forced respect, "We've sent Aurors to meet the train en route, and another team to Kings Cross to check the platform, but we haven't heard anything back yet. Please - wait in your office, we'll come find you as soon as-,"
“You too, Mrs Malfoy. Is Draco in? He invited me over,” he said and she nodded, gesturing for him to come in. Harry unwound his scarf as he came into the entrance hall, eyes roving over the details around him. He remembered being half-walked, half-dragged across this hall, his face swollen and stinging, his vision obscured, his scar burning. He felt a chill go down his spine but tried to suppress it. What had harmed him them couldn’t harm him now.
Torture, Dark Magic, canon-typical violence, suicidal thoughts, loss of appetite, coercion, Alcohol Abuse/Alcoholism, Physical Abuse, Blood and Injury, Non-Consensual Potions Use
Once they were done, all three of them worked together to raise the tent, and once that was up, Draco turned to gather kindling for a fire, but Hermione stopped him with a hand to the shoulder.
“- too late,” Harry said. “You’ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco months ago. I took his wand from him the day he first found our camp,” he explained and Draco nodded vaguely. Harry had taken his wand by
’ – Isobel MacDougal was a pure-blood, as was Draco. As for leading their fellow students on the right path, Draco could only guess. Behind him, the gargoyle cleared its throat once more.
“What do you reckon it’s looking for?” Weasley shouted from the back and Harry turned his head to reply. His nose was smudged with dirt and there was a high flush on his cheeks, like he had spent too long in the sun.
“Oh this is ridiculous. I’m going to clean up,” she snapped and she flounced off to the bathroom, shutting the door behind her. Weasley groaned from the armchair.
“Hermione it’s freezing, let’s get inside,” Potter suggested gently and with a firm grip on her shoulder, he turned her around and marched her back into the wards, his wand still holding the shield charm. Potter paused as they crossed the ward boundary, smiling at Draco, and then reaching back and pulling Weasley, who had picked up his rucksack, in behind him. Weasley looked around with a relieved expression which sharply fell when he spotted Draco shivering in the snow.
“Just tired from the journey,” he offered by way of explanation. Pansy gave him a look that suggested that she did not believe him at all, but turned back to her dinner without comment. Blaise craned his neck to study the occupants of the hall.
“I had figured,” he told her blandly and she shot a nervous look at the door to her drawing room. She sipped her tea and said nothing.
“Hello,” he said by way of greeting once he got within earshot and she looked up, grinning when she saw him, slamming her book closed and putting it on the table to come to her feet and pull him into a hug. Out of habit, Harry turned his head to avoid a mouthful of hair, and then closed his eyes and leaned into the hug, enjoying the moment with one of his best friends.
“Thank you Dobby, for looking after me. Thank you for remembering I like honey in my tea when I’m upset. Thank you for playing games with me in that horrible stuffy nursery. Thank you for preparing me for what was to come, and thank you for coming when I called. You were far kinder than I ever deserved,” he said quietly and Hermione sniffled behind him. Potter swallowed.
“I’m sorry sir,” Draco said, casting a look down at the ground. He was not used to appearing contrite in front of teachers.
“You – you reckon?” he asked and Potter turned away again, pacing once more. Draco turned the Snitch over in his hand as Hermione gave him a concerned look. It was a small, warm weight and heat seemed to radiate from inside it. He looked up as Potter froze in the middle of the tent, his fingers pinching his lower lip as he was lost in thought.
With trembling legs he stood and looked around the room he found himself in. It was a dusty, sawdust-strewn bar. He felt a sneeze building in his nose and choked it down. The front door to the bar was still open and Draco ducked down behind the counter, crouched in a dark corner until he heard the door shut and then the scrape of the lock being bolted again.
“Mr and Mrs Malfoy? Will you come with us, please?” one of them said, not really asking. His parents stood and his mother paused to hug him once more and kiss his cheek before they were led out of the Great Hall. Draco did not watch them leave, instead turning back to the Hall to try and find Harry in the crowd.
“Dream of me often, do you?” he asked, crossing his arms over his chest and Potter smiled. It was genuine and Draco thought of the times he had often seen Potter smile from across the Great Hall, the corners of his eyes wrinkling, the corners of his mouth quirking upwards. There had been times where he had wanted desperately to have that smile turned on him, but it never had been.
“I don’t think you can fix this kind of break, Harry,” he murmured and Potter looked like Draco had slapped him. He stood, nearly sending Draco’s stool crashing to the floor as Draco leaned back and he stuffed the two parts of the wand into his trouser pockets. He grabbed a t-shirt that lay screwed up on the floor next to the bed and pulled it on roughly.
“We need to get into Hogwarts,” Harry said, after Aberforth hadn’t spoken. “If you can’t help us, we’ll wait ‘til daybreak, leave you in peace and try to find a way in ourselves. If you can help us – well, now would be a great time to mention it,”
“Search, fast!” Harry told them all, and they scattered. Draco went to the back of the vault, past the stacked goblets and other treasures, squeezing past some draped animal skins. He scanned the piles in front of him, turning around sharply as there was a clunk behind them – the door had reformed. Griphook dismissed their frightening faces and suggested sharply that they use their wands.
“How is it my fault?” Harry asked, feeling his temper rise. He had forgiven Malfoy as much as he could, given all he had been through at his hand. Hermione held up a quelling hand.
“I hope so. But I think I have everything I need right now,” he said and Draco leaned over and kissed him on the cheek. He opened his mouth to speak, but the Hall fell silent as one of the Fellows stepped up on to the dias, a piece of paper clutched in his hands.
Another few people had arrived, Dean and Luna Lovegood, looking wan and thin, and then finally the bride, Fleur Delacour. Potter, who had been rocking slightly where he knelt, cradling the elf's body, stopped and looked up. His eyes seemed hollow in some way, like the life had been drained from them.
“You never know what roads are closed off or where, in Oxford. Just the other week, that Muggle detective and his lanky blond sidekick were monologuing over another corpse found near St Edmund Hall. The side roads were closed for three days,” she said ruefully and Harry smiled. In her letters, she had often complained about DI Lewis and DS Hathaway, who typically turned up in odd places and questioned assorted students about the various and unfortunate deaths of the denizens of Oxford. Thus far, Hermione had managed to avoid being caught up in their enquiries, but Harry thought that had more to do with her knack for Notice-Me-Not charms.
“Shush. It’s only Bella having a little fun with the Mudblood. The other prisoners have been taken down to the dungeon until the Dark Lord arrives,” she murmured soothingly to him and his blood turned to ice in his veins. Thoughts threatened to overwhelm him. If spending nearly six months in a tent with Hermione Granger had taught him anything, it was that she was more than ‘
“I’m going to see if Hermione’s finished planning,” he threw over his shoulder as he walked away. Draco lingered at the bottom of the clearing, spinning his wand between his fingers. He raised it once more and whispered “
"What are you doing to find my sons?" he asked, though his mouth felt like it was stuffed full of cotton. Thompson blinked at him stupidly for a minute, before pushing himself to standing, matching Harry's height, adjusting the cuffs of his shirt underneath his robe.
He made his way back to Hermione and took her elbow, somewhat rudely interrupting her conversation with the Law Fellow.
“The Dark Lord?” he asked and Potter nodded. Draco felt his heart sink in his chest. “But if he has… pieces of his soul floating about, he’d be… well, he’d be immortal essentially,” he said quietly into the silent clearing and eventually Granger gave a sombre nod. Draco slumped a little where he sat. “Merlin,” he breathed finally and Granger nodded. “Do you know what you’re looking for?” he asked eventually and Potter squirmed where he sat.
Draco woke with a start, nearly falling forward out of the armchair. The teacup he had dropped as he fell asleep tinkled as his foot brushed it and he ran a hand through his hair, breathing hard. That must’ve been a dream, surely –
"What?" he gasped out, falling back on his heels, feeling his knees protest. He reached out a hand and held onto the edge of the fireplace, steadying himself.
“Oh, we volunteered. Well, Harry volunteered us. But we always like to see familiar faces onto the train,” Draco said, smiling down at Tatiana. Even her dark hair couldn’t free her from the tell-tale Weasley blush as it burned her ears. “How about I go fetch Harry if you’re meeting Ron and Hermione on the platform?” Draco suggested and Ginny gave him a small smile, which he took as agreement. He hopped back on the train and began the search for his husband.
s’, which surprised him – it didn’t seem like the type of book Granger would have lying about. He picked it up, figuring that Granger wouldn’t mind, and took it outside to read on a log next to the fire, the blanket wrapped tightly around him.
"Shut it, Thompson, or I'll do it for you," Ron snarled, whipping out his wand and pointing it at Thompson. They had never gotten along, even during their training days, and when Ron had left to join George at the joke shop, Thompson had seen it as a personal victory. Even so, Thompson looked suitably cowed.
"Yes, but it was a possibility. And that's all this is, Malfoy," Ron argued back, and Malfoy glared at him, "a possibility,"
"She hasn't even arrived at Hogwarts yet, Harry," she reminded him and Harry nodded, looking down at his hands. A painful silence fell until Ron cleared his throat, and Harry looked up at him.
“Of course not, of course not!” he said impatiently and he let go of Draco’s arm to move closer to Potter, bending slightly to be at eye-level with him. Draco drew back, allowing his mother to wrap her arms around him once more.
“YOU’LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH ME FIRST!” Draco shouted, barging past the rest of the table, eliciting gasps from both the Gryffindor and Slytherin tables. He had his wand out already, trained on Pansy who was gaping at him, white-faced. “You touch a hair on his head Pansy and I’ll slit your fucking throat,” he snarled at her and she recoiled. Daphne Greengrass was trying to pull her back into her seat as the Gryffindors table slowly rose to their feet, wands drawn and ready in their hands. And then the Hufflepuffs stood and turned and then the Ravenclaws, their backs to Harry, facing Pansy who was finally pulled back to sitting just as Draco reached Harry.
“Don’t you usually have two sugars in your tea?” Potter asked him and Draco flicked his gaze over to Potter, who looked thoughtful. Draco hesitated but then nodded.
“-RONALD-” the sound of Weasley’s backpack thudding to the snow “-WEASLEY!” she screamed into the night and Potter got between them, pushing Hermione back with a Shield Charm cast from Draco’s wand. He was shivering violently and Draco took a step forward, wary of crossing the wards.
A log fell in the fireplace, sending up yellow sparks and Draco lifted his wand again, his hand shaking out of his control now, and pointed it at Rowle, who screamed and screamed and screamed – until, at last, he fell silent.
“You could be kinder to him,” she said, and Harry frowned. Hermione rolled her eyes. “I don’t think he has many friends here in England anymore,” she went on, frowning herself. “He was under house arrest for the last year of Hogwarts, and I think a lot of the Death Eater's children fled to America. I doubt he keeps in contact with anyone he knew at school,”
Voldemort’s mouth hung open in a scream of fury that seemed stuck in his lungs as the snake’s body thudded to the ground at his feet where – where Harry wasn’t.
“The building has been touched by Dark Magic. You’d need to cleanse it and tear down the old building entirely, including the foundations, before you’d ever be able to rebuild again,” he explained and Granger nodded, contemplating his answer. Potter slipped a hand out from under the cloak and Draco was about to tell him to bring it back in, in case some unsuspecting Muggle happened to walk by and see a disembodied hand floating in mid air, but all Potter did was reach out and hold on to the rusted gate, his knuckles turning white from the intensity at which he held it.
“What did you do, Baron?” he asked quietly and the Baron turned so that half his silver face was cast in shadow.
“Mother,” he started and she hummed and looked up at him, her face serene. This evening of peace was so like it had been before the invasion that it soothed them both, and he smiled at her. “Do you know anything about your cousin Regulus?” he asked and she frowned.
“Yeah, but your parents? Well, they’re in his inner circle, aren’t they?” Weasley asked and Draco sniffed.
“How do you know Dobby?” he asked and Potter let out a bark of a laugh. Granger giggled and took another bite of her own, making a small noise of pleasure.
“We couldn’t tell you where we were, mate,” Ron whispered. He was by the window, looking a little pale, though relieved.
“I’m going for a walk,” he announced suddenly when the smell of Pansy’s lunch got too much. She stepped out of her seat to let him go through and looked as though she was about to come with him. “I won’t be long, Pansy. Have your lunch,” he told her and though she looked a little miffed, she sat back down. Crabbe and Goyle eyed him from their seats but he knew that the pile of food in front of them was too much temptation for them to leave their seats.
“Sorry. I had a nightmare. Thought I’d come down here and do a bit of reading to calm down,” he said in a quiet tone, lifting the book for Ron to see. Ron blinked at him and then sighed, turning to shut the door and then taking a seat next to Harry, who watched him in bemusement.
Snape was announced as the new Headmaster at the feast. Around him, the Slytherin table had exploded into cheers and jeers, but Draco remained frozen to his seat, staring dumbly up at the High Table. He knew, of course, but the reality of it hadn’t hit until now. On either side of Snape, McGonagall and Flitwick sat with identical expressions of practiced pleasant neutrality, though he could see the fire burning in McGonagall’s eyes. At the furthest end of the High Table sat the Carrows, who Draco recognised from the Manor. They were usually found skulking at the end of galleries and it looked like their new positions, though Draco could only guess at their subjects, would give them the same opportunity at Hogwarts.
“Well, they’re extinct in the male line. That is to say, there aren’t any direct male descendents bearing that surname,” she explained at Potter's confused look. “They died out centuries ago, though. If they have any descendents, they’d all be called by other names now,”
“Trying to prove Voldemort’s ideals then?” he snapped before he could help himself. The anxiety he had felt at the nightmare still lingered and made him snappish, it seemed. Hermione kicked him under the table, and while a flush rose on Malfoy’s cheeks, he maintained his composure.
He smiled when he saw a figure approaching, his pale hair practically white in the late autumn light. Harry raised a hand in greeting and the figure sped up, coming into view.
Harry sat down heavily on the sofa, dragging Malfoy down with him. For a while everyone remained silent.
“I didn’t think so,” he said cooly and he returned his attention back to his original speech, “as Head Boy and Head Girl, you will both have duties unique to your position. Like Prefects, you can give or deduct house points. You will also be able to change any common room password if required – all you will need to do is place your wand flat to the common room entrance and announce what you want the new password to be. You can and will be asked to assist professors in lessons, including covering any lessons should the professor be absent or needed elsewhere. You may be asked to referee Quidditch matches. In the event of an unlikely emergency” – here Snape gave them a grim smile – “you will be asked to assist in the protection and evacuation of the castle. Do you have any questions?” he asked them both, though his tone suggested that they shouldn’t have. They both shook their heads. “Once again, I offer my congratulations to you both. Especially as this year continues, we should expect changes in the curriculum, and I expect you both to lead your fellow students on the right path,” Snape said ominously and Draco exchanged a quick look with Isobel, who did not look convinced. Snape turned back to the papers on his desk. “You may go,” he said, dismissing them both.
"Right, on you get!" Ron cried, opening the nearest door and, with Harry's help, loaded the children's trunks in. Rose scampered in, her brother following behind her, while Albus and Scorpius lingered. Harry drew them both in for a hug and kissed the tops of their heads, promised that they would both be up for their first Hogsmeade weekend, and then let the boys go.
“Potter!” she called, stepping off the platform as the remaining students pushed past her to get to Kingsley. “Aren’t you supposed to be looking for something?” she said significantly, and Harry looked confused for a second before realisation dawned.
He and Harry had had a fair few fights about giving Albus' the Invisibility Cloak (with the proviso that he shared it with Scorpius, of course). Harry thought it was useful for both boys, while Draco was convinced it was dangerous and would get them into more trouble. A fair few times Harry had thrown the fact that he had raised the boys alone (without his help, thanks) back in Draco's face, and a fair few times Draco had stormed out of the house and found himself drowning his sorrows at the Leaky Cauldron, but they had finally agreed that Albus could have it, as long as the Headmistress was aware, and agreed, to let him. And surprisingly, she had.
“He’s taken the others,” he whispered back, and Potter jerked his chin towards the door. “Has Griphook told her–”
They sat in silence for a while longer, sipping their tea. Hermione sighed and stood, looking at the clock on the wall.
“I was just sorting this, but it’s done now. Were Ron and Hermione on the platform?” Harry asked, stepping back from the luggage rack and pausing to kiss his husband.
In all the confusion, Draco began to run for Neville, but drew up short as Neville broke the Body-Bind Curse on him and in one smooth movement, knocked the flaming hat off his head and drew from its shadowed point – the Sword of Gryffindor. The rubies caught the early dawn light and glinted like fire as Neville swung it and in a single strike, beheaded the snake rearing from the ground.
“Oi! Watch it, Malfoy. The Dark Lord needs you,” one of them snarled and Draco’s muscles tightened in fear. Yaxley and another Death Eater were dragging him along the corridor and Draco’s socked feet struggled to find purchase on the carpeted floor. He glanced behind him and saw his bedroom door was wide open – with a sinking feeling, he realised he had forgotten to lock it.
Harry found himself briefly chatting with a History Fellow about their research, but their similarities ended when the man announced he was undertaking research regarding the rise of Pureblood supremacy and the values behind it, and Harry politely excused himself to find Hermione. He found her standing with a Law Fellow, both of them deeply entrenched in a conversation about Magical Law extending to Magical Beings, and Harry gave up trying to follow the conversation after about 5 minutes. He told Hermione he was going to see if there was any wine left, and she waved him away without saying anything.
“I really am pleased for you, Hermione. I guess things have changed since I was last home,” he said and she reached over and took his hand, prying it off his pint glass to squeeze it.
“Did she–?” he began to ask but Potter withdrew his hand and shook out his jumper sleeve, so that the cuff unrolled and covered it.
. Granger whipped her wand out and a bang went off, a flash of red light flaring as the snake was bodily lifted off Potter, who was wheezing on the floor, and slammed into the wardrobe at the back of the room, which caved under its weight.
,” he offered and while she pouted, Lilyana said nothing further. The train next to them whistled and the adults lurched into action.
He took a deep breath and turned his face to look up at the sky. Stars were already peeking out through the purple sky, and the sun glowed orange and warm in the distance, already over the horizon. He stayed there until the last of the sun's rays had slipped over the trees, and then he went back inside, catching the end of the show.
Before he could even think, Potter rolled off Draco and hauled him to his feet as Weasley dove for the chandelier and dragged Hermione out of the wreckage. Potter lept in another direction, heading for Greyback while Draco went for the goblin, pulling him out of the ruins of the chandelier. He heard Potter shout “
“Interesting,” Greyback said contemplatively. “That’s interesting…” He walked past them again and his voice was behind Draco’s now, where Potter was.
?” Longbottom asked and Harry gave him an apologetic school, lifting a hand to rub at the scar on his forehead. His eyes closed involuntarily, tightening for a second as if in pain.
The motorbike and it’s sidecar shot off into the night, flames roaring from the exhaust and the three Death Eaters soared behind it. They were firing off curses one after the other and a terrible green streaked across the sky, and Draco’s heart skipped a beat, diving after them. A scream wrought the air, cutting through the noise of the battle. “NO! HEDWIG!” he could hear Potter cry out in the darkness and the motorbike lurched forward once more.
Everywhere around him were the detritus of students long gone. He passed a broken harpsichord and the remains of a hoop skirt wrapped around a moth-eaten mannequin. Shadows loomed in every corner and he flinched back when he turned sharply to find a mirror propped against a battered looking trunk. He stepped forward to study himself.
“No,” Potter said sharply and Bill took a step back, as if startled. “I need both of them here. I need to talk to them. It’s important,” he said authoritatively and Bill looked like he was about to say something but then Potter pushed himself away from the door frame and took a step back. “I’m going to wash, then I’ll need to see them, straight away,” and then he turned down the hallway, heading for the little kitchen.
“Get back inside, Aberforth,” one of the Death Eaters said warningly and the man, Aberforth, stepped towards them. Some of them took an involuntary step back.
“Death Eaters did this!” Ron bellowed, pointing at his brothers. “Your people did this!” he shouted and Draco pushed himself forward, emotion swelling inside of him.
was the title and Harry ran his hands reverently over the gold embossed title. This book had been out of print since the 16th Century and while the Bodleian Library had a copy, they required everything short of a kidney before they would hand it over. Harry had once drunkenly proclaimed he would sell his soul to see a copy, though his study group had thankfully talked him out of performing the rite.
Harry stepped back into the office and sunk into the sofa, half-listening to the broadcast as Lee Jordan, now the main voice of Magic Daily, the evening News broadcast, introduced Hermione.
!’ and encouraged visitors to donate to the site. There were trenches laid for the layout of the maze but only a few stones had been placed. Isla scuffed her heel against the ground and sniffled.
“You know Law back to front, Hermione,” he said reassuringly. She gave him a small smile and continued to pick at her breakfast. He did the same until Hermione stood, brushing down her skirt and giving the clock over the fireplace a significant look.
!” he said and the wand sparked and then, like a dying match, went out. Potter eyed it and then tried pointing it at Draco, who leaned back a little in his seat. “
“No, not that school Sir. It was very exclusive, invitation only to apply, that sort of thing,” Hermione explained quickly before he summoned the Gordonstoun applicant, and Longshaw blinked but otherwise looked mollified by the explanation.
“I thought you wore glasses, Potter?” Greyback asked and Draco prayed to anyone or anything that would listen that Potter’s glasses had been smashed underfoot in the search through the tent, but there was no such luck.
“I’ll take a watch. No,” he said, interrupting Draco’s protest before it could even begin. “You look knackered. Get some sleep. I’ll just grab my wand and head outside,” and there it was. The moment Draco truly had been dreading. Potter blinked at him expectantly but Draco watched as the expression melted into confusion. “Draco, where’s my wand?” Potter asked and Draco would’ve liked the chance to enjoy his name coming from Potter’s mouth but there was no time as Potter’s lips set into a thin, stern line. “Where is it?”
“Get Bill!” Draco shouted as Potter began twitching in his arms. He laid him down gently on his side, and smoothed his hair back, muttering soothingly to him. There was the crunch of sand behind him and he turned to see Hermione staggering towards them, Ron a redheaded blur in the distance as he sprinted back to the cottage.
They said little while they finished off making their teas, exchanging pleasantries. Harry said the weather in Australia was improving, while Draco said the weather in France was turning more miserable every day, but at least it wasn’t so horrendously hot anymore. They found two free seats and carefully sipped their tea, the silence stagnating around them.
"They're missing, Hermione," Harry murmured, sounding very lost, and Hermione made a soft, pained noise.
Potter, holding onto the motorbike with only his knees now, looked around, panicked and Draco could hear the Dark Lord scream “Mine!” over the shriek of the wind. Draco watched as the Dark Lord raised his wand and Potter, whether from fear or some other emotion, closed his eyes as the Dark Lord said “
! Draco felt a thrill at the realisation, which was quickly tempered by the Dark Lord speaking once more. “You have failed the Dark Lord, Rowle, and he does not forgive easily,” Voldemort continued, snapping Draco’s focus back to him, and Draco shivered. It was true. “What do you have to say for yourself, Rowle?” the Dark Lord said and Draco stopped the spell, dropping his wand to his side. Rowle gasped and coughed and wretched and still tried to mumble out apologies, words that did not make sense when strung together, but Draco could tell he was desperate. Draco’s hand shook as the Dark Lord hissed behind him.
"I'm sure my father would be simultaneously horrified and overjoyed to hear it," he said and Harry frowned. He set the jumper down on his lap and began to fold it, finding the careful movements soothing.
“Funny ‘ow they all thinks we wants to ‘ear’ that,” Scabior said mockingly from the shadows. “But none of ‘em can tell us where the common room is,” he added and Draco’s stomach dropped, his heart skipped a beat. There was no way Potter could answer them, no way he knew where –
“I reckon you’ve done alright, mate,” he said quietly and Draco nodded, immensely grateful for Bill’s kindness. “I’m going to keep an eye out from here. You can go back inside if you like,” Bill said but Draco shook his head.
“I trust Hermione, she’s usually right about this sort of thing. We should go,” he said again. “Lovegood’s on your side as well, Harry, the
“Good girl!” Aberforth shouted as he ran past, a small group of students on his heels. “They look like they might be breaching the Northern Battlements, they’ve brought giants of their own!”
A group of wizards that had been coming round the corner retreated, and the goblins scattered with shouts in a language that Draco did not understand. Harry paused for a second, his wand held in an arc over his head and then he swung it downwards at the dragon, shouting “
“I’m sorry, alright,” he whispered and Draco sagged against him, fisting his hands in the borrowed t-shirt that Potter was wearing as pyjamas. “I’d been fighting off that vision since we left your parents and then talking to Griphook and Ollivander… I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to avoid you,” he said roughly and Draco nodded, smudging tears into Potter’s shoulder. Potter pulled back, sliding his arms from around Draco’s shoulders to hold onto his upper arms. Draco hiccupped a little and Potter gave him a small smile before leaning forward and kissing him softly.
The Bulstrodes were from Gaddley. Draco felt sick, imagining Milicent laughing as she cursed and killed a family of five. She wouldn’t, would she? Milicent could be harsh and brutish, but surely she wasn’t capable of murder? Draco pressed his knuckles into his eyes and tried to breathe through the nausea.
They stepped off the pavement, and the woman turned away at once, as if expecting it, and began back down the lane. They followed her down a few cottages and then she turned and hobbled down an overgrown front path. She fumbled with a key at the front door of the wattle and daub cottage as they shuffled down the path, Potter leading the way, Draco behind him and then Granger behind Draco. She was breathing shakily behind him and even as they approached the door, she whispered to him.
“HAGGER!” shouted the Gamekeeper's giant brother, and a volley of arrows flew overhead, scattering the Death Eaters who shouted with surprise. Voldemort’s giants roared at Grawp and ran at him, making the earth tremble below their feet as centaurs crested the hill, their arrows nocked and aimed, all of them shouting a warcry, their hooves pounding the ruined lawn as they charged.
He tried to keep himself busy. He tidied the tent, straightening the beds and fluffing the armchair cushions. He set cleaning spells on every surface he could find, and when that was all done, he picked up a book from the pile on the dining table and set to reading it, or at least attempting to.
“Yeah, lets,” he said and she looped her arm through his and they began to head for the door. Malfoy was stood to one side of the atrium, looking a bit dazed, and Harry nearly kept walking, if it wasn’t for Hermione stopping dead in her tracks.
“Well, I don’t really know anything about him,” she admitted. “He’s not in any books other than Nature’s Nobility,” she added and Draco wrinkled his nose.
!” he yelled into Harry’s ear, who had reflexively hugged him back, though he looked positively bewildered.
,” he said quietly, resigned, and the sidecar exploded. Potter looked sickened and Draco wanted to reach out and touch him, but there was no time as the Death Eaters behind them pushed forward, firing curses one after the other.
As night began to fall and the forest went dark, he avoided the park rangers and found a clearing. He charmed the small area around it with wards, lifting his hands and his wand and repeating “
“You have been very brave, Draco,” Dumbledore said and Draco’s heart clenched. He felt tears sting in his eyes and he wiped them roughly.
“Welcome, students, to another year at Hogwarts,” Snape intoned over the hall, his voice lacking the warmth that Dumbledore’s always held. Draco shivered next to Pansy. “There have been a few,
“We don’t have time, Hermione, you heard what Harry said,” and Harry gave him a look, his jaw set in determination. “I’ll go outside of the cloak,” he said finally and Ron gaped.
“I think we should go and see Xenophilius Lovegood,” she said and Potter turned from where he was sitting at the tent entrance to gape at her.
“Oi, pretty boy,” came a call from the Stairs in front of him. Draco’s eyes flew open to see Fenrir Greyback stood there, a group of lackeys surrounding him. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end, like they always did when Fenrir was near. His sharp teeth and strange amber eyes did little to endear him to Draco, and the nicknames didn’t help either. Fenrir bared his teeth at Draco in something that might have once been a smile, before the Wolf inside took over. “Better keep that bed warm for me, eh?” Fenrir practically purred and the lackeys laughed uproariously as Draco held himself very very still.
Draco was then dragged into a discussion with Ollivander about wands, and he had felt bad for the old man, who looked exhausted. Clearly the wandmaker was tortured by the things he had told the Dark Lord and as they left the room, the man’s arm shot out and grabbed Draco’s hand.
"“Repayment'… a dark wizard must've taken the boys!" Hermione said, mind fitting the dots together. She had one hand tangled in Harry's robes, steadying him where he leaned heavily against her, and her eyes were flicking over the image again and again, a frown on her face. "A Death Eater, probably. Probably lost a son in the War," she continued, and the Aurors were all nodding along with her, a few looking at their relatively newly-elected Minister for Magic with newfound respect.
“Didn’t you ever read Hogwarts; A History?” he asked and when he turned back around, Granger was beaming at him. He gave her a baffled look. “What?”
“Please,” Draco begged, on his knees on the recreated floor of Bellever Forest, dreamed pine needles digging into his shins. Potter looked at the forest around him, but was not moved. “Tell me where you are. Let me help you! I want to help!”
Gathering together the team who were going to Malfoy Manor, they took the lifts down to the atrium and headed towards the Apparition point, the Aurors marching in time while Harry, Malfoy, Ron and Hermione strode alongside them. One of the most experienced Aurors, Begbie, a strapping man with grizzled features and hair more salt than pepper, was leading the team, and he ushered them all into a formation at the apparition point.
“Did you lock the door behind you?” Aberforth grunted and Draco nodded once. “Good. They said you’d sneak in. Come on, they’re upstairs,” he said firmly and Draco ducked through a second doorway and then up a narrow flight of stairs which led to an open sitting room. The wooden floorboards were scuffed and a threadbare carpet was laid in front of a small fireplace which lay empty and cold. A portrait of a girl with a pleasant but vacant expression watched from over the mantlepiece.
"Where's your brother, where's Scorpius?" Harry asked and Albus made a weird sort of noise and gestured to the mirror again. The silver-framed mirror. Harry's knees went weak, his mind running at a hundred miles an hour. "Oh Merlin, no. No, please," he begged some unseen entity. The mirror surface began to churn like restless water again, and bulged outwards, straining against something on the inside, until, at last, Draco and Scorpius broke free.
“Oh, Merlin. She was…” he said, struggling for words. Umbridge had been awful, in her own way, to even the Inquisitorial Squad. She rewarded them even more for ratting each other out than if it was just another student. Blaise had worn the incorrect uniform one day and Pansy had told – he had been given three detentions and the next opportunity he had, he implied that Pansy had been fraternising with a sixth-year Ravenclaw. Despite her protests, Pansy had been given detention too.
“Malfoy, would you like to join us for lunch?” she called to him, and he looked up with a bewildered expression that quickly smoothed out into a neutral one. Harry opened his mouth to protest but Hermione stood on his big toe (entirely on purpose, despite Hermione’s apologetic smile).
“Do you really think she knows who you are?” she asked and Potter turned back to look at Bathilda who was watching him, expectant.
It hadn’t been entirely blissful, of course. There had been one or two knock-down, drag-out fights, especially when Harry announced he wanted to go into Auror training three months after the war ended. Draco had been horrified and furious, and then thankful when Harry completed one year of training, decided it wasn’t for him and withdrew. Draco had spent that year completing his final, lost, year at Hogwarts, waiting every morning for the letter that would tell him that Harry had been injured in the line of duty. Hermione, who had also returned for her final year, had spent most mornings talking him off the proverbial ledge.
“You asked to see me, sir?” Draco asked, looking around the door to see if anything had been disturbed. Nothing was changed from when Draco had last visited, not even the mound of paperwork still piled onto the desk.
“We lost the sword,” Harry finished glumly. He held the dittany pipette delicately and hissed as a drop landed on a burn underneath his singed jeans. Draco held out his hand and Harry gave him a few drops, which Draco pressed into the sides of his neck, swearing at the sting as the dittany healed the welts there.
His hair was ruffled, like he had run his fingers through it too many times, and, not that Harry was looking particularly, his lips were flushed pink, probably from Malfoy biting them nervously. Harry had to look away before he embarrassed himself by staring.
“Cold,” Potter said, dumping his damp clothing on the canvas flooring. Draco wrinkled his nose at it. “Did you think of anything?” he asked and Hermione shook her head, pouring what looked like tomato soup from the flask into the bowls.
of displeasure, Draco dropped the spell again and Rowle lay on his back, shaking heavily and panting. A dark stain was spreading across his lower robes and Draco looked away.
“-I’m going to keep fighting even if you’ve given up!” Harry was saying, on his feet in front of Aberforth now, his back ramrod straight. Draco blinked in confusion and Hermione caught his eye, shaking her head slightly. Harry could deal with this on his own.
“Fine. Lead the way,” he said, settling the backpack straps over his shoulders. She nodded and turned on her heel, setting off deeper into the forest, Draco following along behind her.
He was just finishing off a report for the Minister that afternoon, when the floo in his office flared and his secretary Belinda's face appeared in the flames.
“No reason, darling. There’s a touch of flu going around, that’s all,” Mother lied sweetly, giving her husband a small smile. “Take a seat, darling, dinner will be out soon. Can I fetch you a drink?” she asked as she guided his father into a seat. He had once sat at the head of the table but had been relegated to mid-way down over the course of the summer. He slumped into the chair and muttered something that Draco couldn’t hear but Mother walked away regardless, presumably to the library where a full decanter of Firewhisky was usually kept.
The worst night had been when he had woken Harry up, convinced that Voldemort was in the house, trying to steal the boys. Even though Harry had tried to talk to him, tried to convince him otherwise, Malfoy couldn't be persuaded, and had eventually started screaming in fear, while Harry floo'd everyone and anyone in his desperation, the boys shrieking, terrified at the loud noises.
“Someone Apparated in and set the Caterwauling Charms off!” the main Death Eater said, clearing his throat. Draco crept closer, breaking cover for a second to get closer to Aberforth’s doorway. “Got to keep the streets clear, so what?” he tried for casualness which apparently back-fired.
“Gryffindor Golden Boy, of course you do!” he said and Potter laughed, lifting one hand to shield himself, the other shielding the porridge balanced in his lap. Draco dropped the blanket and smoothed it over his lap. “You make me want to, at least,” he admitted quietly and Potter’s smile faded a little. Draco looked up and caught his gaze and for a second it felt as though the snow outside had cut off the world and it was just them in that moment, Potter’s gaze hopeful and Draco’s longing and –
Draco leaned closed and smiled to himself slightly. In that very way of humans, all around the sign scribbles had been added by visitors who had come to see the place where the Dark Lord had been vanquished. There were names here and there in Everlasting Ink, some names had been carved into the wood and other left messages which shone in the moonlight. Draco read them and smiled.
She was right. He hated it, but she was right. He had to show no weakness. It was the only way. He straightened his spine and ate, though he barely tasted a thing.
"Oh Harry, I'm so sorry. Whatever we can do, we'll do it. Location Charm? Have you tried it?" she asked and Harry shook his head.
Hermione withdrew her beaded bag from her robes and fumbled inside it for a moment before pulling out the shining sword. The blade caught the wandlight and the rubies winked red in the dim light. Hermione held it out to Harry, who took it by the hilt, catching the tip of the blade on a silver flagon – it did not spring into 20 copies.
’ for his GENERAL I paper, which, like the Specialist paper, had lasted three hours. His back was screaming at him by the time he stood up from the desk he had been assigned, and his hand protested loudly whenever he so much as twitched a finger.
“Be quiet! The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine, Cissy! We have a very serious problem! Go, Draco – and Cissy, Lucius, leave us!” she snarled. Mother reluctantly gave Draco his wand and he gave the trio, Dean and the goblin a glance before casting
“A fair bit away,” he commented and Harry found himself nodding in agreement. He opened his mouth to explain why he had chosen Australia, of all places, but he was interrupted by a Fellow approaching them, his formal robes swirling around his ankles. He was a short, squat man, who had the appearance of someone who saw very little daylight for long periods of time, though there was a warm and kind smile on his face as he greeted them.
"You go down too, your Dad has something for you as well," he said, thinking of the small parcel wrapped up and hidden in one of the kitchen cupboards.
"Harry-," he said and Harry pushed his chair back so quickly it made an alarming scraping sound across the floor.
“I found glasses! There was glasses in the tent Greyback, wait–” one of the Snatchers said in excitement and Draco heard the crunching of ground underfoot as he ran off, returning seconds later. Greyback snatched something off him and then there was a pained sound from Potter as the glasses were forced back onto his face.
"I was sick. Do you still not realise this? When I was sent to France, I was diagnosed with Post-partum Depression and Psychosis, I was sick," he said through gritted teeth, his fingers tightening on his mug of tea.
Had it all been a very elaborate dream? Draco thought it might have been. He picked up the cup and set it on the tray on the table next to his chair. Then he stood up and walked over to his bed, climbing onto it and lying down, not bothering to change. His wand lay serenely on the bedside table, barely touched since he had returned home for the summer holidays, and he didn’t bother to pick it up and cast a deafening charm around the bed.
, though he cast charms around it to make sure it didn’t spread. He helped himself to one of the sandwiches Mibby had made and took a second to think about what he should do.
What was left of the marble staircase had been steadied by a series of spells from Professor Flitwick, though the rubble would take days to clear. Filch, his back bent as he pushed a broom through a thick layer of dust and debris, grumbled under his voice as they snuck past him, Mrs Norris’ eyes trailing their movements from where she watched, perched on a boulder.
“Who did this?” Harry asked darkly and Draco turned to look at him. He looked murderous. His eyes were blazing, his jaw clenched so hard that a vein had popped in his temple. He looked like he was about to self-combust.
“Get under the cloak. It won’t cover your feet but it’ll be dark when we get there, it won’t matter,” Draco instructed Ron and Hermione and they nodded. Hermioned picked up the empty bottles of pumpkin juice and put them in her beaded bag, and then reluctantly, they both moved to stand on either side of Harry, prepared to be covered by the cloak. They paused as a great wave of wind hit them, nearly sending them staggering, and Draco turned to see that the dragon had stopped drinking and was now flapping its wings.
“If I can just poke the sword through the handle – but how am I going to get up there?” Harry was talking to himself more than the others now, and Draco shifted his weight slightly, his shoes now uncomfortably warm. Panic was rising as Harry looked around the vault, as if expecting to find a ladder. He turned to Hermione, his expression desperate. “Hermione, I’ve got to get up there, we’ve got to get rid of it–” he said but no sooner had he begun to speak then Draco raised his wand at him.
After the Dark Lord had finished his speech, his followers scattered. Those that drank too much at dinner went to raid the potions stores for Pepper-Up Potion, and others went to fetch cloaks and brooms. Draco tucked himself away in an alcove at the top of the Stone Stairs, watching the activity with a faint ringing in his ears.
“Harry, I’m sorry–” Hermione began talking again and Draco turned his gaze away from Dumbledore watching them to see her advance more. Potter’s fists were clenched at his sides, his knuckles white. “-but I think the real reason you’re so angry is that Dumbledore never told you any of this himself,” she said and Potter scowled at her.
"No - see the scorching? Hidden Words doesn't do that. It doesn't burn the message into the surface, like this one did. This was meant to be found too - nothing “hidden' about it. The kidnapper wanted someone to find this, they probably cast a timer charm on it so it didn't appear until the platform was empty after everyone had left. This was probably
“A few foxes came by, but it was… quiet,” Potter said, turning the spoon in his bowl idly. Draco helped himself to another spoonful while Potter thought for a second. “In – in Godric’s Hollow,” he started and Draco gulped, the porridge suddenly tasting a bit like cardboard. Potter gave him a look through the corner of his eyes. “Did you stay at my parents grave when Hermione and I left?” he asked and Draco set his bowl down. He nodded.
“You need to think of something happy,” Potter reminded him as the Patronus faded into stardust before their very eyes. Draco turned and glared at him.
“My father can barely walk in a straight line these days, and his wand was destroyed in that fight, so he’s not exactly having fun,” he snapped back and Potter froze.
“Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?” the same voice sneered into the darkness and then became muffled as though its owner turned away. “Spread out. He’s here.”
“We need to go,” he said and Harry nodded once, wiping his eyes roughly on the back of his hand. Goyle had disappeared from the corridor, but there was activity coming from the other end, flashes of light and colour and the sounds of many people running passed.
“He has,” he said finally, his eyes catching Draco’s over the firelight, dark and intense, and Draco took a second to understand what he was saying, before gaping at him.
“In Nature’s Nobility,” she reminded him and Draco reached out to the book he’d put down on the bench beside him while they ate.
"I've contacted the Auror Office separately but currently - we don't know where they are," she said and Harry's whole world slid sideways, panic gripping at his throat.
A year ago, after a bath, and a hot meal (and a healed leg for Scorpius), the boys had been able to talk about what had happened to them, after some coaxing from Ron. Lucius had charmed the barrier shut, much like it had been for Harry in his second year, and during the boys confusion, had confunded them both and led them away from the station, where he had Apparated them both to Malfoy Manor. Scorpius' broken leg had happened during this Side-Along Apparition, and the Aurors theorised that it was because Lucius took on more than he could handle, causing a splinch. He had kept them in the Manor proper for a few hours, but when neither boy would stop screaming, and their magic started making things explode (one of the Aurors had found the chandelier in the Dining Room on the floor in a shattered heap), he had moved them into the mirror.
“I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,” Harry said, talking fast, beginning to jog. The others kept abreast of him, Draco still holding the ruined cup. “He hid it exactly where I hid my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. Come on!”
“Draco, come on!” Hermione called and he turned to see that the doorway had opened. He followed them in, turning at the last second to see Ginny Weasley’s hair whip around a corner and disappear. He tried to shout after her, but she was gone, and in the split second he had hesitated, the trio had disappeared into the Room of Requirement.
“We’re here to see He Who Must Not Be Named!” Greyback rasped on Draco’s right and Draco’s mother sniffed.
“HARRY! HARRY – WHERE’S HARRY?” Draco could hear Hagrid bellow over the chaos around them. The centaurs had joined the frey now, scattering the Death Eaters, who ran from the giant stomping feet as they blundered around. Great drops of black blood fell onto the courtyard, as the giants bellowed and covered their ruined eyes from the attacking Hippogriffs and Thestrals, who whinnied and snorted in fury. Grawp, in his fury, pummelled the giants he could reach and Draco saw one fall just as Neville pulled him into the crowd that was rushing into the school.
Despite the sombre news, Weasley and Hermione were beaming at each other, buoyant at having heard familiar voices for the first time in months. They sobered up a bit after looking at Draco’s dour expression.
“C’mon,” he eventually said and Draco fell back into step behind him, as they headed towards the church. With a glance back, Draco could see that the memorial had transformed back into the obelisk. As they approached the church, the singing grew louder and Draco blinked rapidly as they edged through the kissing gate. He had to press close to Potter for them both to fit without it looking like the gate was swinging on it’s own. Deep snow lay on either side of the slippery path to the church doors and Granger and Potter waded into one of the banks, heading for the back of the church. Draco shuffled behind Potter again, reaching out a hand to steady himself once more. If Potter felt his touch, he didn’t say anything.
“You’re an idiot,” he said with forced cheerfulness. “But at least you’re an idiot with principles. Come on, I want to see what all this fuss is about.”
His wand was still for a long moment and then began to wobble and spin before settling in a direction over his left shoulder. He shoved the wand back down his jumper and set off in that direction with renewed purpose.
“No,” Harry said, interrupting him. He stood straight, taking his weight off Ron. Hermione had rejoined them and Harry gave them all significant looks – he had seen something. “We need to get going,” he told them in a mild voice. Hermione's gaze steeled and Ron’s jaw tightened, but Harry seemed reassured by this, that they had all understood. He caught Draco’s gaze, and Draco inclined his head very slightly, acknowledging he understood.
“Congratulations, Professor,” He said and Lupin beamed down at him. Fleur had sidled round and was offering Lupin a chair, and he tried to wave her off.
The aches felt deeper than the ones he had gotten after long Quidditch practices, but then Harry to remind himself that he was older and more likely to feel these things far deeper. He found Hermione in the atrium once again, and was about to suggest heading back to Grimmauld Place when she went up on her tip-toes and waved across the crowd. Harry shrank back when he saw Malfoy approaching.
“All this snow!” Granger whispered on Draco’s left, slipping out from underneath the cloak. “Why didn’t we think of snow? After all our precautions, we’ll leave prints! We’ll just have to get rid of them. Boys, you go in front, I’ll do it–” she began to fuss but Potter took her arm gently in his as he slipped out of the cloak, Draco still hidden underneath it.
By the time they got back to the tent, the sun was setting. Draco felt drained, tired from using all that magic, and his lips were bruised from the kisses he and Potter had traded throughout the afternoon, an unspoken agreement passing between them. Draco had summoned the owl repeatedly and every time Potter got a little closer to it, tears in his eyes, though Draco thought they might have been happy ones after all.
“I want to help him,” he finally said, saying it aloud for the first time, and Dobby gave him a sceptical look. Draco huffed in frustration. “I do! Ask me Dobby, you can tell if I’m lying. You’ve known me my whole life,” he said and Dobby looked over him once and then nodded.
“Oh pish-posh, Blaise, why go to Paris when you can find everything you need in dear Diagon Alley,” Pansy said on Draco’s other side. Her dark bob had obviously been freshly trimmed and her robes were cut fashionably short. She waved cheerfully at one of the shopkeepers, who went pale and darted inside the building. “Doesn’t quite have the same summer feel as it usually does, though,” she murmured quietly and her hand tightened around Draco’s arm.
It only took him a minute to spot it – “There, it’s there!” he shouted, pointing his wand at a small alcove in which a small, squat gold cup stood. The others whipped around and the cup was caught in a four-way spotlight, all of them hardly daring to believe it.
“I didn’t mean to wake you,” Draco murmured in apology to Crabbe, who watched him from heavy-lidded eyes that barely caught the light of the lamp that Nott had to keep lit at night.
The War Memorial had transformed as they had approached it, transforming from an obelisk covered in names to a new statue. A man with untidy hair and glasses, a woman with long hair and a kind, pretty face and a baby boy sitting on his mother’s knee. Snow was dusted over their heads and Potter drew closer, his mouth open. Draco dropped his hand and edged closer for a look himself.
“What happened?” he asked, running over to them. He reached Potter first and reached up a hand to touch his fingers to Potter’s forehead. Potter hissed but didn’t step away.
“Actually we were just catching up, Fellow Longshaw. We attended the same secondary school together,” she explained, giving Harry a quick glance. Longshaw’s robe wasn’t piped with purple which marked the Magical Fellows from their Muggle counterparts, so they had to be careful what they said.
"Children who converted to the light after the War? Children who were disowned after denouncing Voldemort?" he asked, ignoring Malfoy's flinch.
cloak!” There was no response, no rustling of fabric and Draco took a steadying breath – at least the cloak would hold.
"Everything's fine," Harry said with a smile, and Hermione looked relieved. Next to her, Hugo was casting nervous glances around them, and Draco gave him an encouraging smile.
“I’m going down to the lake,” he said finally and he gathered up some clean things and left the tent. Draco hesitated for a second before dashing to the table and snatching up ‘
“It should keep you a little warmer, at least,” she said with a smile and Potter took it gratefully. Draco hesitated and then grabbed a pile of blankets that had been bunched up at the end of his bunk and went over to Potter, settling them down next to him.
There was a routine, of sorts. He would wake in whatever forest he found himself in from the day before (Charnwood, Ashdown, Tentsmuir, Wentwood, so many others), pack up his camp and then search the forest. He would follow the trails and then walk deeper into the woods, humming the Hogwarts school song to himself and hissing “Potter? Granger?” as he wound his way around pines and oaks, straining his hearing for some sort of response.
“I can’t believe anyone ever thought she was a legitimate journalist,” he said finally, tapping Rita Skeeter's name on the front cover. He gave her a guilty look as she let out a huff of a laugh. “Do you remember in fourth year, when all those articles came out about–?”
“Well it’s the Black house, innit?” asked the other Death Eater in a nasally voice. “Why not send in the Malfoy brat? He’s Black enough, right?” and his companion laughed.
Sniffling, Granger raised her wand again and began weaving it in midair. Draco recognised the spell as soon as vines began to blossom in the air, and he raised his own wand as well, joining his magic with hers. Around hers he wove more magic, until a beautiful wreath of Christmas roses and white lilies hung in midair. Potter caught it and settled it in the snow atop Lily and James Potter’s graves.
“Hermione?” he asked and Granger made a small noise of acknowledgement, not looking up from her book. He gave Draco a concerned look but decided to press on, apparently. “I’ve been thinking. I – I want to go to Godric’s Hollow,” he told her and Granger finally looked up from her book, though Draco could tell from her expression that she was a thousand miles away, probably still thinking about the mark in the book.
“What about your pretty little friend…” Greyback said with relish, leering at Hermione who tried to pull away from her captors. One took a hold of a fistful of her hair and she yelped. The Snatchers jeered.
“I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you and I shall punish every last man, woman and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour,”
“Muggles who’ve just been leaving flowers on your parents’ grave! Harry, I’m sure there’s someone over there!” she snapped and Draco withdrew his wand as well inside the cloak, raising it a little as Potter hesitated next to him.
“Malfoy?” he asked and Draco jumped a little. He had thought Potter was another vision, but Potter wasn’t disturbed by his appearance. In fact, he appeared like he had been expecting it. Potter blinked and rose to his feet. The room around them was fuzzy and vague but Draco could make out two other shapes, one sleeping on a sofa, the other on the floor next to Potter.
“A doe. She appeared out of the woods and led me to this pool. I could see the sword of Gryffindor at the bottom of it,” and then Weasley, with a jump of remembrance, withdrew something shoved down the side of his backpack – the Sword of Gryffindor. Draco and Hermione gaped at it and Weasley looked at Hermione gingerly, like hoping it would be met with her approval. Hermione, awestruck, forgot she was angry and her limbs loosened a bit as she leaned forward in her chair.
“And then there’s this,” Harry said, turning back to Dumbledore, pulling the Elder Wand free and holding it up for the portraits to see. Even in his exhausted and aching state, Draco looked upon the wand with reverence, and he could see the same look on Ron and Hermione’s faces. The most powerful wand of all time was in this very room with them. Harry glanced back at them and frowned. “I don’t want it,” he eventually said, turning back to face Dumbledore’s portrait.
“I’ll take the watch tonight,” he offered as he sat back down and Potter looked at him from over the top of his glasses but didn’t say anything further. A long stretch of silence passed between them before the question bubbled up from Draco’s mouth before he could stop it. “Do you not remember the dreams?” he asked and Potter stiffened but didn’t look over at him. “I just thought – well, I thought they were real. I mean, I thought I was going mad when it first happened but since then it’s been
Further away, hidden in the shadows of a building that had been signposted as the ‘Rustic Temple’, Potter was teaching Draco. The building was made of large interlocking stones in an octagonal shape, but without a roof wind whipped through it and sent chills up Draco’s spine as he tried to think happy thoughts, his wand raised in front of him.
“Before you know it, Taitana Krum, you will have more friends than you can count. That’s the beauty of Hogwarts,” he told her and while she didn’t look entirely convinced, she nodded, a touch mollified. Draco straightened. “Harry’s on the train if you’d like to say hello, Ginny,” he offered, and she nodded.
“And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful,” he continued, a little slower, like he was picking up the thread of a thought that had just escaped him. “And at the height of his power, when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him, he duelled Grindelwald, and beat him, and he took the Elder Wand.”
Once they were all seated, the Fellows shut the hall doors and wound their way through the desks to the front of the hall. There was a large blackboard at the front of the hall, raised on a dias, that proclaimed in large but neat writing ‘SPECIALISED 1’.
“I am Fellow Williams. As a brief introduction, Mr Potter, this Viva will take about half an hour and in it we will be discussing the answers given in your four examination papers and any questions they may have raised. The Fellows in this room are Witches and Wizards and under the Statute of Secrecy, nothing you describe here that involves Magic will be divulged to our Muggle Fellows. Do you have any questions before we begin?” he said, and Harry shook his head.
“And the Carrows can’t get in?” Harry asked, looking around. Draco turned as well – there was no obvious door, not even the portrait passage which had swung closed, the entrance now concealed behind a Gryffindor tapestry.
“Quite tragic,” Snape replied in the same measured tone, eyeing him with no expression. Draco caught his gaze and Snape raised an eyebrow, only fractionally. It was enough. Snape knew what his mother’s letter meant, and he wasn’t going to stop him. “I think, Draco, that you should return to your dormitory and collect your belongings, and then return here. I will arrange a Floo pass for you. Would” – Snape glanced at the complicated planetary dial that sat on his desk – “you be able to return in an hour? That should give you enough time, I think,” Snape said and Draco nodded, cold fear still coursing his veins.
“The wand. The Elder wand. It’s buried with Dumbledore at Hogwarts,” he said and Hermione gasped, rocking slightly where she was leaning. Ron went to steady her and Potter shook his head.
“Who would you marry then?” she asked delicately, flicking a crumb off the table. He scowled at her.
“Did you make notes of your answers?” Draco asked as they walked over to the table that held the clean mugs. Harry nodded, and Draco sighed. “I did, but only after I got home each night. I think I remembered enough to talk about them, but… well, we’ll see, I suppose,” he said and Harry gave him an encouraging smile as he dropped a tea bag in Draco’s mug.
“You’ll take care of them?” Hermione asked Draco, a small tremble in her voice as her daughter drew away from her and climbed back onto the train.
“Sometimes. I think it’s more… I miss life when it was simple,” he said as Draco took a seat on the old blanket that Potter had laid on the ground next to him. The cold from the forest floor still seeped through and Draco shivered.
, Cissy, it rises! As is the Dark Lord’s wish, the Ministry shall reflect his values,” Bellatrix said once she put the goblet down. She pushed her tangled black hair away from her face and shot a stern look at his father, who had stayed in his seat, looking dejected as always. Once news of his wands' destruction had reached him, his father had been even more of a shell of himself than he had previously. “Do you not wish to join the Dark Lord in his victory, Lucius?” she asked him with a sneer and he turned over his wand hand, his empty palm face up.
“Yeah, maybe. After all, I did have to write quite a lot about the Dark Arts today,” he said and Ron gave him a sidelong look.
“I can’t read our future in the stars, I’m afraid,” she said and Harry grinned. They turned into a dark corner and Hermione took Harry’s hands in her own. They both turned on their heels and with a
“We don’t look like ourselves, and there’s no one around, Hermione. Come on, we’ll be fine,” Potter said soothingly and Granger looked a bit fraught but nodded, casting an eye over where she suspected Draco would be standing. He came up behind them and whispered.
They took their seat towards the middle of the hall and Hermione’s legs bounced as she couldn’t sit still. Harry himself felt a bit sick, and he reached for Draco’s hand, who took it and held on tight.
“I wonder why nobody’s ever rebuilt it?” Granger asked as they moved closer. Potter’s eyes were fixed on the blown-apart room as they stepped up onto the pavement next to the rusted closed gate.
“You need to let him in, Harry,” Hermione said softly into the semi-darkness. She wiped her eyes on the cuff of her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke. “We need to find out where You-Know-” – she stopped and shook herself – “-Where Voldemort is, because he’ll be with the snake. Do it, Harry – let him in!” she told him and Draco’s hands tightened where they were holding onto Harry’s arms.
“You’re not going to go inside?” Granger hissed from Draco’s other side, looking incredulous. “It looks unsafe, you might – oh, Harry, look!” she whispered and Draco turned to look as well.
“Everything’s fine,” he told the table, which let out a collective breath. He updated them on how the other members of the Weasley family were doing before slipping into the seat left for him at the head of the table. Draco hadn’t really been listening but Bill must’ve said the wrong thing because his soup bowl was zipped out from under his spoon by a snapped spell from Fleur, who marched off into the kitchen with the bowls stacked in her hands. Bill gave them all an apologetic smile.
"Go home, Harry. We'll get you first thing in the morning, but right now, you need to sleep," she said, and Harry swallowed his pride, and nodded. Hermione stepped back to let him stand up, and caught his hand in hers, giving it a squeeze. "Take Malfoy with you. He looks a bit lost," she said in an undertone and Harry started to protest, but it died in his throat when she gave him a stern look.
“No, sorry,” he admitted and she sighed and stood. Draco followed her, shaking the cloak slightly to dislodge any snow that might have gathered around his knees. He joined her as they wound their way amongst the graves. As he walked down the path, he was suddenly aware of the complete darkness around them and he looked over at the church – the stained windows had gone dark. The lights had been turned off and they were now alone in the church yard.
Draco let his body fall to one side and he slipped out under the dragon’s wing, heading for the water. He righted himself just in time to hit the water and plunge deeply into it, the cold shock knocking the breath out of him. Once the momentum of the fall was slowed enough, he kicked upwards, his lungs straining for air as he broke the surface, gasping and spluttering. There were three circles of ripples around him, showing where Harry, Weasley and Hermione had fallen, and they all broke the surface simultaneously, coughing and gasping for air. Draco pointed to the opposite side of the lake.
“No. We usually take it in turns to watch, especially at night. But without–” He stopped and blinked rapidly, and Draco remembered that Phineas, whoever he had been, mentioned that he thought Weasley had left them (and admittedly he hadn’t seen Weasley since he arrived and surely he would have had something to say about it if he were here). “Anyway, she’s tired. I think we’ll stay here another day and then move on,” he said and Draco nodded. He sipped from his mug and turned his attention back to the book. “What will you do?” Potter asked and Draco looked up, frowning.
“And in the forest–” he began again, and Draco listened. He listened to how the ghosts of Harry’s parents, godfather and Lupin had appeared to him. How they had walked with him, side-by-side and silent, to his death. What he had seen while he lingered in that place between this world and the next. And how Draco’s mother, Narcissa Malfoy, had lied to the Dark Lord, if only to protect her son.
Potter, either unfazed or uncaring about Draco’s presence, stripped down to his boxers and waded out into the freezing lake, gasping as the cold water tumbled over his skin. Draco kept a lookout and occasionally snuck glances. Potter was lean in the way best suited to a Seeker, muscular but slim. The muscles in his arms flexed as he dunked himself under the water, washing away the dust and blood from the day, and as he reappeared at the surface his skin broke out into goose pimples.
“I never thought you would be,” he said quietly. Draco sniffed and lowered his arm, the train turning a corner and King’s Cross out of sight now. “If you want children, let’s do it. I think a child could do worse than us for parents,” Harry said with a shrug, pulling up the window and turning to walk to the teacher’s carriage at the front of the train. Draco followed, smiling at students as they went, listening to the rumble of excited chatter as another year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry began.
“There’s only one way in, now,” Aberforth said, his eyes still on the portrait. “You must know they’ve got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends, Dementors all around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded. How do you expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his deputies… Well, that’s your lookout isn't it? You say you’re prepared to die,” he finished with a shrug of one shoulder.
“I left Hogwarts,” he said, his tongue sticking to the roof of his mouth. “They were – they made us torture students in Defence Against the Dark Arts. Finnigan was one of them, I’m sorry Thomas,” he said and Dean’s jaw tightened but he only nodded. “I went to tell Snape, but he already had a letter from my Mother. It was in code, so no one would realise, but she told me to run, that the Dark Lord wanted me dead. So I left. Dobby, actually – he helped me escape,” he added, tears pricking at his eyes again. He blinked rapidly and coughed.
“Why would he? He’s sent out his army to do the job for him, and he thinks Harry will go straight to him, because Harry wouldn’t want anyone to die for him,” he said and Ron shook his head.
“Accident?” There was more laughter from the Snatchers. “You know who used to like using the Dark Lord’s name, Weasley? The Order of the Phoenix. Mean anything to you?” Greyback asked and Draco saw Weasley shake his head.
"Yes," he agreed, bowing his head. He reached for one of the books next to him and picked it up, reading the title with a frown. "
“You could learn a lesson from him, boy,” came a slurring voice and Draco looked up to see his father watching him from between curtains of lank hair that had fallen around his face. Mother drew back in her chair and smoothed her skirt. “Loyal to the end. His father must have been so very proud,” Father said and Mother shot him a stern look.
“I – yeah – blimey.” He was obviously overwhelmed, so Draco reached out a hand and Potter took it, without even thinking, squeezing it tightly. Lupin spotted the hand and followed it to its owner, stepping back with a shocked expression when he noticed Draco standing there. Draco opened his mouth to explain but Potter beat him to it. “Draco’s with us now, Lupin. He’s on our side,” he explained and Lupin gave him a once-over look, obviously weighing him up and then he stuck out a hand.
,” he said and Potter nodded, weaving his way around the bed to stand in the middle of the room. Draco followed him. “Is she safe, at least? Are
The afternoon sun was bright as Draco stepped out, and as he turned to say goodbye, he heard the door close and lock behind him. He blinked at the apparently innocuous boulder where only seconds ago there had been a door and then he ducked his head and disappeared into the treeline, preparing to Disapparate. He took a second to look back and he thought he could see the turrets of Hogwarts on the horizon, but he couldn’t be sure. He turned on the spot and disappeared with a
They rose and awkwardly left the room, riding the staircase back down to the gargoyle. They took a moment to stand in silence in the empty corridor, before Isobel turned to Draco.
Next to him, Hermione lay gasping, tears streaming down her face and Weasley was on her other side, groaning in pain. Harry, however, was already on his feet, trying to snatch at Griphook who had leapt from his shoulders and was sprinting towards the crowd of goblins that was advancing on them, daggers drawn.
“Draco, move this scum outside,” Bellatrix said, flicking the sword in the direction of the unconscious Snatchers. “If you haven’t got the guts to finish them, then leave them in the courtyard for me,” she added with a sneer and Draco felt heat rise in his cheeks but did as he was told.
“It is!” Greyback rasped and Draco felt all the fight leave him at once. “We’ve caught Potter!” Greyback crowed and around them the Snatchers cheered and whooped. Draco ducked his head down and tried not to cry. Next to him, Dean Thomas shuffled and knocked their shoulders together. He looked up and Dean gave him a wide-eyed look, as if to say ‘Do something!’. Draco cleared his throat.
“I – I can do it. Hold him still,” she whispered, picking up the right wand. Draco shuffled around until he was leaning over Potter’s head and held him down by the shoulders. He bent over as far as he could, pressing his forehead into Potter’s bleeding cheek.
When Potter was done, he looked up at the sky, as if surprised by how light it was now. Ron and Dean Thomas slipped past Draco and Bill and headed up to the little outlook where Potter was sitting. They exchanged a few words and then Dean and Ron climbed down into the hole and began to help.
“I love you too. I have to go,” Harry replied quietly and Draco thought about fighting, thought about convincing him to stay, but he could only nod.
’s as they duplicated, turning into a shower of coins. “It burned me!” Hermione exclaimed, sucking at her blistered fingers. Draco bent down to pick up one of the coins and dropped it almost instantly, shaking his hand with a hiss of pain. It, too, duplicated, exact copies popping into existence around his feet.
“To be an All Souls Fellow is very prestigious,” Harry had explained. “It’s not an opportunity I can miss, not really,” and he had gone back to folding the t-shirt and ignored Cameron until he had left the room in a huff.
Draco felt his knees give way. Hermione hurried to hold him up, as did Ron, but thankfully Voldemort hadn’t noticed the movement, too focused on Harry. Draco’s ears rang and his vision swam. He had been the master of the Elder Wand? All that time, trapped in the Manor, he had been the master of the most powerful wand to ever exist? During his weakest moment?
"Thanks, Papa," he said and Draco felt his heart soar a little, and he smiled back. The boys had really struggled with what to call him, and he had been “Draco' for a few months, until Albus had tried “Father' which made Draco go pale. Since then, they had tried various names for him, including ones in other languages until they had unanimously decided on “Papa', though it had only been in the last few weeks of the summer holidays that it had been used. It still gave Draco a thrill to hear it.
They pulled him through the hallway and Draco’s mind raced. Where were they taking him? What did the Dark Lord need from him? Draco couldn’t even guess at this point. They guided him roughly down the Stone Stairs and into the dining room, where they dropped him to the floor in an undignified heap.
“Uh, coffee, please. Two sugars,” he asked and she nodded and began to make him a steaming mug of freshly brewed coffee as Hermione came into the kitchen, her hair swept back into a chignon at the base of her neck, wearing a blue skirt-suit.
as the stack of books he had requested from the Library appeared on the shelf next to the request tray, and Harry jumped a little at the sound. He collected the books and stacked them next to the letter and the book Malfoy had sent him. He looked between the two for a minute before reaching into his backpack on the floor and pulling out a sheet of parchment along with a pen. He paused after writing ‘
“That didn’t help much, did it dear?” the mirror asked him in a pitying tone and he momentarily thought about throwing a paperweight at it, but resisted. He joined his mother in the corridor and she gave him a smile and straightened his robe.
Isobel MacDougal had been named Head Girl, and she was waiting outside the Headmaster's office on the seventh floor when Draco arrived from breakfast. After a little more than two hours of sleep, he was exhausted, and the world felt hazy and distant. He was aware that he looked it as well, and Isobel, prim in her Ravenclaw uniform, gave him a look up-and-down in distaste. He ignored her.
Dumbledore stepped forward and touched his shoulder lightly, and Draco looked at the Headmaster and saw that although he smiled, tears ran down his cheeks.
“And what’s he doing here?” he asked snottily, pointing a finger at Draco. Hermione opened the beaded bag that still hung from her wrist and dropped the ruined locket inside it.
They continued along the street, Draco wrapping himself in his years of Malfoy training, his eyes focused straight ahead and his chin tilted up. He still caught the cries from the desperate people on the street though, begging for gold, food, a wand to show that they were really wizards! Hermione scanned them, looking pained and Draco poked her in the side.
“-They’ve put a Taboo on it, anyone who says it is trackable – quick and easy way to find Order members! They nearly got Kingsley-” and Draco frowned.
“Oh good, I thought I was going to have another nightmare,” Potter said, smiling. He was dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, and there were some scratches on his arms, but he didn’t look any worse for wear. Draco, suddenly overcome, sank to his knees and Potter frowned down at him. “What’s wrong with you?” he asked and Draco waved a shaking hand at him, unable to voice the emotion he was feeling. He pressed his other hand to his mouth to stifle the noise he was trying to make – screams or sobs, he wasn’t sure.
“You keep saying that, but one of them can,” he said in a pointed way and he gave Draco another sideways look. “Harry’s invisibility cloak-” he started but Hermione cut him off once more.
“What can I do for you, Mr Malfoy? We’re only on the first day of term,” she added, scrutinising him. Blaise cleared his throat.
“Hermione found it in the copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard Dumbledore left her. And we saw it on a grave in Godric’s Hollow.” Potter had relayed the events of Godric’s Hollow to Weasley sometime during the day, and Weasley nodded with understanding. Potter turned his gaze back to Hermione. “Do you really think Xenophilius Lovegood knows what this is about?”
“Yeah, I was. Well, I broke up with him prior to coming over to the examinations. He tried to reconnect when I was back in Australia, but I put a stop to that,” he said and Draco nodded, a hint of colour rising in his cheeks. He leaned a bit closer, as if to ask something else, but one of the doors off the atrium opened and a Magical Fellow in a purple-piped gown stepped forward.
"Merlin," he said, feeling his knees give way. He sat heavily on the staircase, and Malfoy sank down next to him.
“The introduction is at six, with a drinks reception to follow. You’ll need to change, by the way,” she said, eyeing his jeans and jumper. Harry pointed at his backpack reassuringly and she nodded. “Have you thought about what answers you’ll give on your papers?” she asked, and Harry raised an eyebrow at her.
They spoke a little while they waited, and Luna eventually settled onto the sofa and fell asleep, resting against Hermione’s hip, while Dean and Ron kept talking in quiet voices. Draco just listened for the sound of Potter returning from the outside, but when he did eventually hear any movement, it was just Bill returning.
“Yes, that’s what they’re called,” Granger muttered at him, obviously focused on her notes. He picked up another book and flicked through the pages – it was a book on Medieval Magical Iconography Throughout Europe and he could tell it was probably irrelevant from the first few pages.
"They're missing. You have to help us. Please," he said, his voice trembling, and the Patronus stamped one hoof against the floor nervously before galloping away, disappearing through the wall.
This attempt at not-sleeping nearly ended in disastrous consequences when he accidentally dropped a whole bitter root into his simmering cauldron, which sent a cloud of noxious smoke pouring through the dungeon classroom in his Potions class on Friday. Coughing and waving a hand in front of his face to disperse the smell, Slughorn waved his wand and the smoke was sucked up into the tip of it, disappearing with a small
“Told you! Viktor Krum was right!” he crowed at Granger, who turned around to scowl at him, but she turned her attention back to Draco.
“Draco, your arm!” Hermione said, shocked and he froze. “You must’ve caught it, let me see–” she said and before he could stop her, she had bustled over and wrenched his sleeve up. The trio froze at the sight of the raw, red ‘T’ dissecting the Dark Mark and Draco turned his face away.
"Your Dad pulled a few strings, and they handed him over yesterday. Granmol," (which was the unusual term for endearment both boys used for Mrs. Weasley, which Harry explained was a portmanteau of “Granny' and “Molly'), "had him overnight to give him a bit of TLC, and he came back by Owl this morning," he explained and Scorpius gave a giddy laugh of relief. "Go on, your Dad's in the kitchen, go thank him," Draco said, standing aside on the staircase. Scorpius hurried past him, feet thumping on the staircase, but he paused on the landing below and looked back up, grinning.
"Let me know, please… If you hear a-anything," he said and Hermione nodded, moving to go and take his spot on the sofa next to Luna. Harry felt untethered all of a sudden, like a ship come away from its mooring, until he turned to Malfoy, who looked as lost as he felt.
“No,” Harry admitted truthfully. “I don’t like dark, cramped spaces. I don’t like loud noises. I don’t like feeling cold,” he said and Hermione nodded. “But, it’s a part of me now, I suppose. Just like the scar,” and he reached up and touched it, lightly brushing his fingers over the raised surface. “It’s there, but it’s faded. It doesn’t hurt anymore. I hope that one day, the War won’t hurt either,”
“Do it!” Amycus snapped at him, and Draco flinched. He turned to Finnigan who stared at him with fury in his eyes and he jutted out his chin defiantly. Draco tried to apologise with his eyes, tried to tell him in some small way that he didn’t want to do this, but Finnigan just watched him, his hands clenched into fists at his sides.
"You tried to drown them," Harry snarled, and the room went very still, as if cast under Petrificus Totalus. Malfoy's face was ashen.
Ron was already straightening up, squaring his shoulders. “Right, so you can’t go, that’s what he wants, that’s what he’s expecting. You stay here and look after Hermione, and I'll go and get it–” Harry interrupted him.
“He had the ring for ages beforehand. You know Ron, can’t hide a present to save his life, I found it in his sock drawer a week later, but I decided to keep it quiet. Took him another six months before he asked,” she said and Harry laughed.
“What?! You’ve sighed four times in the last two minutes,” she shot at him and Potter gave her a surprised look but then frowned.
“That wasn’t your Patronus!” said a Death Eater, pointing down the street where the owl had disappeared. “That was a stag!”
They both watched him for a few silent minutes. Granger took a step closer to Draco and leaned heavily against his side – Draco wrapped an arm around her and brought her in close and then she just pressed her face into his shoulder and cried. After a minute she stepped back, sniffling and rubbing at her face.
“It’s just the snake, yeah? We kill the snake and we – Harry’s done it,” he said gruffly, his throat audibly clicking when he swallowed. Draco nodded. They lapsed into silence.
Draco ran for Hermione’s area and knocked the canvas aside. She groaned in her sleep and blinked up at him. “Harry’s gone,” he told her, his voice strained and she sat bolt upright in bed, her face drained of colour. She kicked her blankets off too and followed him out to the door, where Potter had been but now was very much not.
“No,” Hermione whispered and then she was sprinting across the clearing, passing through the wards and launching herself at Ronald Weasley, whose face had just come into the light as he stepped out of the treeline. His joyous expression collapsed inwards as Hermione landed the first blow across his shoulder.
It felt like a fever was building inside him and he nearly became delirious from the pain, tempted to go home, tempted to crawl back to Hogwarts and beg forgiveness. But the memories of Dumbledore saying “I can help you,” and Potter saying “Maybe you can keep secrets too,” made him stay and lie there and scream until he finally, blissfully, slipped into unconsciousness.

To see their names and the short span of their lives engraved onto cold stone made Draco feel breathless. Tears pricked in the corner of his eyes and he wiped them away as Potter began to speak, reciting the last line of the inscription.
,” Harry murmured and the wand, miraculously, resealed, the splinters reforming into one whole length of wood, the phoenix feather disappearing from sight. Harry paused, as though taking a steadying breath, and then plucked his wand from the desk, turning it over in his hand – from the look of relief on his face, Draco could tell that the wand was whole again.
“Really gives a feel for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn’t it?” Ron said solemnly as he slipped out from under the cloak and held a door open for them to slip through.
Narcissa Malfoy stood in the doorway, her expression surprised but not shocked. Age had been kind to her, and though Harry could pick out the fine lines at the corners of her eyes, she looked no different than she had when he had first seen her at the Quidditch World Cup. She looked him up and down and then smiled, looking pleased.
Hermione, running past, gave him an impressed look, but she turned back to the group of Goblins and fired off another ‘
Draco took an involuntary step back, feeling like someone had just punched the air out of his lungs.
“It was my father’s,” he said and if Draco could have freed his hands to smack his forehead, he would’ve. “We borrowed it to cut firewood–” he continued and Draco wanted to strangle him. Too much information, too much easily disprovable information, and Potter was giving them rope with which to hang him.
“No, not yet,” he said, his voice a little hoarse. He cleared his throat as Fleur Delacour entered the cottage.
There were cries of horror and protest around him. Hermione was barely being held up by Ron, both of them looking as desperate and full of heartache as Draco felt, grief smeared across their faces. Around him, the protectors of Hogwarts wept and cried to see their hero dead. Distantly, Draco could hear his aunt laughing at their pain. Beside her, the Dark Lord stood, pale in the early morning light. The snake, Nagini, slithered alongside him, curling around and over herself, her tongue flickering as she tasted their grief in the air.
He swam back to the side and quickly hauled himself out, his boxers sodden and sliding down his hips as he reached for the towel he had left on the side. Draco quickly shot a warming charm at it and Potter gave him a thankful look as he wrapped it around himself. He sat down on the side next to Draco and sighed.
“I am surprised to see you out and about, Bellatrix,” he said mildly, straightening and pulling his cloak around him.
They made their way to the top of the house in silence, Malfoy occasionally pausing to look at the photographs on the walls or a trinket on a side-table, or comment about the decor of the house itself. On the second floor, he paused and smiled, gesturing to the framed picture of both the boys in their Kiddie Quidditch Team, aged about six-years-old, Albus sat confidently on his broom while Scorpius stood, awkward, next to him, clutching a teddy bear. In the photograph, his broom zipped out of his hand and went flying away, while a silent cry of outrage came rushing out of Scorpius' mouth. Harry paused to look at it.
“The house-elves, they’ll all be down in the kitchen, won’t they?” Ron said and Harry blinked at him.
“So those artifacts would be the wand, the stone and the cloak?” Draco said, his eyes going wide, remembering the story. He caught Hermione’s eye and she gave him a grim smile.
