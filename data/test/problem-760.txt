Ginny snorts, and other people laugh. She edges closer to the wand in the middle of the circle, then gives it a strong spin.
"Er, hullo," Blaise had blurted to Ron and Harry, and Theo only barely stifled his laughter.
"I know, right?" Theo's eyes tear up as he clasps a hand over his mouth to stop his snorting noises. "Everyone knows
Potter stands, shit-eating grin present. "As you are, Theo."
"Blaise!" she cries, and attention finds its way to her and Draco, as she wanted. "Beautiful execution!" They saunter over, and Theo notices Harry edging away from the group. He wraps a hand around Harry's forearm and pulls him back to the scene. Harry groans, pitifully, but doesn't protest.
And they did. Granger had declared that Jones, Longbottom, and Macmillan were to share a dorm, much to the three's relief (considering some of the earlier arrangements), when she saw the next and paled. Nott had groaned, and Blaise looked on to him and Malfoy in confusion until Granger — with a shaky voice — announced their group:
Weasley pleads for him to stay with his eyes, but Blaise gives him a murderous look, and Theo passes on a hex from a wizard who's practiced dark magic, thank you very much.
"Honestly, how could he
Theo grins, and his two roommates shake their heads before jogging out of the corridor.
Then Draco's face contorts to something worse. "School? Why would I be worried about school?! He's the current most famous wizard in the world — he'll tell
Both Ron and Pansy look like they want to say something to help their best friends' future fates, but they stay mute.
(And Harry wonders momentarily if Malfoy realizes he is dating a potential lesbian.)
Leaving them incredulous, he fled.
"Well, at least they both have big dicks." He repeats.
Theo shrugs, smiling mischievously. "We've been brewing Polyjuice. Planning to molest some people without them knowing."
"Hey, Theo!" Ron grinned at him.
Draco was still hiccuping and wailing, but Theo got him on his feet, and he could, fortunately, walk, unlike Harry.
Their friends look at the two.
Theo groans, pitifully, and ignores the crowds' urges. He crawls over to Draco, and peers at him.
And no kidding that his incredibly attractive roommates, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, were more oblivious than anyone on this damned planet.
to give Potter a lust potion?!" Draco shouts, pale face red. Theo thinks fleetingly of a tomato.
Draco mentally groans.
Harry and Malfoy watch as Theodore exits the Great Hall, turns a corner, and is out of sight.
"Where?!"
Draco scoffs, and Harry rolls his eyes but opens the chocolate all the same.
Draco and Harry glanced at each other, but at that exact moment, Ron comes bounding past the corridor, shrieking: "No, Harry, Draco! You misunderstood!"
Hermione sighs. "Theo, it won't work. Frankly, they're too idiotic for it to work, and your plans have been failing."
"Yeah, you do, whatever a cornophapic loony is," Ginny says, carelessly. "Anyways, to answer your question, Harry, she's been on little flings with Parkinson, I presume."
By complete accident, of course.
Harry blinks. "Yes, but how do you know that he's going to the library?"
" the Gryffindor gushes. Theo blinks, taken aback. Sure, he and the boy didn't hate each other, but they didn't spill intimate secrets, either.
Theo shakes his head, grinning at the two boys, while Blaise pipes up. "Blaise Zabini does
Blaise rolls his eyes, pulling on a strand Theo's hair. "Since you've become so adventurous."
But Draco wasn't listening. Neither was Harry. Because, conveniently, as Slughorn was telling them Amortentia would be what they were testing, Neville had "accidentally" blown up his cauldron, in which the Numbing Potion contents landed perfectly on both Harry's and Draco's head. If either of them suspected anything, they didn't say so as they left the classroom to go to the hospital wing.
Indeed they were! Theo had opened the door after his shower to be met with the two boys sitting on their beds and calmly talking — which was terrifying enough — and they were motioning to his bed whilst doing so.
Harry stands, abruptly, looking a mixture of embarrassed and angry. "Excuse me." He leaves the room, but not without giving Pansy an "accidental" kick in the ribs on the way out from where she's still rolling.
"Well, maybe because I met someone who was gonna be in Slytherin, and was definitely not impressive," Potter shot. "Nott, I doubt you're anything like our dorm mate here, who believes that he's a necessity to everyone, and has a severe superiority complex."
Malfoy sneers at Potter. "Like he wants to fraternize with
on this!" The professor calls again.
Blaise laughs, and Theo raises both of his eyebrows. "Is that true, Draco? You and Harry made up?"
Theo snapped his eyes away, flushed. Shaking his head, he quickly dressed into his robes, and descended to the common room, to wait for Blaise.
Blaise flushes then glances at Theo and the rest of the common room. "We'll never finish in time."
"Hey, Crawley. Hope you don't mind — " he starts.
Shit. He's going to have to fix their relationship,
"Mister Malfoy, I'd hate to only write
"Now," Parkinson starts, "do you happen to know where
"I'm bisexual," the boy across from him blurts.
anyways, next chapter is by FAR my favorite chapter so i can't wait to share that one! hope you enjoyed this one!
"What? I mean - I thought -
"Mister Malfoy, my boy, there's something on your essay, could you come here for a moment?!" he calls.
Then it breaks out in concerned creases, and he's pacing the dorm, tirelessly.
Draco's breath catches.
"I'm not talking to him in the first place," Theo retorts, glaring. "Because of
Yes, very, very shirtless, and they were sitting on their beds, shirtless, with bare chests, and strong bodies, and pale skin and tan skin and they looked smooth, and Theo whimpered, quietly.
"We're not any better," Theo murmurs. "His arch enemy, and a random bloke who was on the wrong side of the war."
of being bisexual, on the same day Pansy told me you were gay."
"I'm staying," he clears his throat. Pansy sends a meaningful glance.
Draco is grateful, nonetheless.
"Oh, come on, haven't you noticed?"
Theo. It was terrible. Theo kept on having to see the two hottest boys in their school in the bare minimum of clothes and was getting excessively flirted on by them, and it was just
Draco swallows. "Yes?" He's surprised yet delighted to hear his calm voice ring, and tries to maintain an impassive expression.
you about Harry and Draco... Er, I might've slipped something out," he flushes darker, "accidentally, of course!"
Theo is dumbfounded on how he never noticed him, but he blames it on him not accepting his sexuality till five seconds ago when he first set eyes on this highly attractive boy.
Draco's eyes widen, and he looks at Pansy, incredulously. "Are you mad?" His voice is high-pitched.
Theo nods, relieved that someone will be in the room with them. He gives them a farewell, then ventures back to his dorm.
"I dunno, I'll do whatever," Ronald Weasley's comes out slightly confused.
"I assume his Prince Charming is tall, dark, and handsome?" Theo cracks a grin.
" Draco says the password, causing the curtains of the eighth year tower to spread, invitingly.
Harry thuds his head against the window and slides a hand through his hair. "I'm just so...
"Blaise, Ron, you're going to hold them back," she starts.
"Hullo," he says, warmly. "What're you guys doing?"
's charm. And... Well,
Theo happily closes his curtains to his bed, and wonders what on earth his two roommates would do without him.
He looks to Pansy. "Move."
"They're being civilized while they're conversing about my doom. I'm avoiding that place as much as I can, love," Theo clarifies.
"And then you won't even have to worry about us," Malfoy reassures, smiling.
and she groans, upset, before muttering dark goodbyes to the two boys and disappearing into the crowds.
"Obviously he does, though!" Draco insists through his tears and obnoxious sobbing. "Or he wouldn't be torturing me and my poor heart!"
Theo rolls his eyes.
Behind him, Hermione appears. "Hmm. You weren't lying about the braiding hair part," she muttered to Ron. "Hello, Theo. Hello, Blaise."

"Yeah, didn't expect that," he chuckles, nervously. "Thought she might pick a love potion — "
? Are they even dating? And if they were, she must be terribly clingy. And Malfoy isn't property! You can't just
"Hey, Nott," they greet, simultaneously.
He had never seen it before this year.
Everyone, even the people closest around him, evolves in conversation. As Hermione and Pansy talk about Potions, Ron and Greg about chicken, and Theo and Blaise about gossip— Potter chuckles, gently, from beside him.
"It's not a superiority complex if it's just that I'm
Greg, Pansy, and Draco set off to the eighth year tower.
Harry falls back, a bit dejected. "Yeah. Right. I'm gonna go mull things over in the shower," he grips Theo's shoulders. "And thanks, Theo. I was afraid we'd never patch things up."
Ron sighs. "I dunno. Just... It's over now, right? I was just throwing out an idea."
Slytherin first year being called a
Harry shook his head at his own stupidity, then quickly left as well.
Hermione walks over as well, gives one glance to him, then scoffs and goes back to her window seat. "What is it
He keeps an impassive front, though.
"Blaise!" Hermione greets, and the party starts up again.
It's around twenty minutes of quiet working when everyone hears a glass vial break. Automatically, everyone looks to Neville, who shrugs, and is perfect condition. Then, someone shouts. "
Theo sighs, rubbing his eyes. "Blaise,
The two look up at the open pansexual, and Potter blushes a bit, while Malfoy — knowing Blaise — rolls his eyes.
They walk into the common room. Pansy's eyes zoom in on something, and not before she glances at Draco, cruelly, does she yell: "Oh,
know, was that they expected him to settle down with a wife and have little, heroic Potter children.
Theo trods over, staring at the group of Potter fans. He sighs, before pushing through and picking Harry up, roughly.
"No," Tracey snaps. "Why in the hell would I not be here? Where would I be?"
"Are you sure Harry and Malfoy don't know?!" Seamus Finnegan calls to Theo and Blaise.
"I'm Theodore Nott. I'm afraid we've never been properly introduced," he says.
"He can't see me like this!" Draco splutters, stumbling up the stairs, gripping Theo's arm, vicelike.
"We all had to figure it out ourselves, you did, too," Pansy shrugs. "How are they?"
"How's your day been, Nott?" Malfoy leans on the table with his elbow and surprisingly looks like he genuinely wants to know.
Something Theo knows to be significant to all of the returning Slytherins is marks. They need immaculate marks and pretty NEWTS to fix their tarnished, pure-blood names.
Hermione nods, smirking devilishly.
super romantic!"
Again, Greg pipes up. "Everyone from Harry's group calls Draco, Draco, and everyone from Draco's group calls Harry, Harry. The only people not calling each other by their given names are Harry and Draco. Harry even calls me Greg, on a good day."
Draco, being the genius he is, immediately took advantage of it. He and Potter had made a deal.
Blaise scoffs. "Of course not. Slughorn was elated to join in on the scheme."
Ron looks at him, expression puzzled with a hint of admiration. "You are very..."
. Since we understand each other, can we go get breakfast? I've been up since six, and it's already nine, and I'm fucking starved."
But Anthony seems charmed all the same. "Yeah! Yes, of course."
It's only a few moments later when he feels eyes on himself, from the opposite side of the room. He sees Anthony Goldstein staring at him, intently, before flushing when caught.
"What?" Harry looks up.
bad."
Draco nods, and Harry smiles, faintly.
to?" A Gryffindor seventh year asks.
to be stuck Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter?
"Well, you're both idiots, so shut up and listen to me," Hermione glares at her two best friends, before looking up and seeing Theo. She brightens. "Hey, Theo!"
"We know you're bi, Harry," Ron assures. "We were just waiting for you to find out."
Theo's eyes flicker to Ron, astonished. Ron gives a small shake of his head, and Theo sighs. How does Blaise still believe the two are together?! He thought his best mate was

Abbott nods, smiling like the Hufflepuff she is. "'Course."
Draco Malfoy comes bounding out and jumps on Harry's lap more shameless than any Slytherin ever. "Please, please,
Theo snorts. "Sure you didn't. Now, I need your help."
When Theo reaches his dorm, he's met with a pitiful looking Draco Malfoy laying on his bed. He sighs.
With Blaise and Ron in position, she flicks her hand to Theo and Pansy, who successfully say the counterspell. Theo's two roommates are immediately brought back — lust filling their eyes at the sight of each other.
At the mention of Malfoy and the library, a small voice in the back of Harry's head reminds him that he's supposed to be doing something, but Harry lacks both the care of and the remembrance of what the task was.
"Wait, why can't I?" Theo asks.
Theo almost chuckles to himself at the sight of Draco purposely facing away from Harry to block the view of his usually pale face, which is stained deep red.
"Yes, well, Blaise told me." Malfoy still looks curious.
Theo wants to pout, but then Blaise pipes up. "But lately they've been settling down. They're not so...
McGonagall suddenly took on a grave expression. "The council and I had decided the best way to spread unity was to alphabetize the students into pairs of three and then letting them be dorm mates. It really mixed up the students, and... Well, interesting groups were formed."
! Can we sit with you?!"
Pansy looks at Granger, eyes devouring. "Would you like to join me on seeing what we could do with Firewhiskey, Hermione?"
Probably the most surprising one was the pure-blood, Russian, silent, and creepy Slytherin named Ivan Crawley, and the muggle-born, geeky, clumsy Hufflepuff named Mason Jones. Crawley was a death eater that was forced to join the Dark Lord's ranks near the end of the war. Before that, he always acted the same — like he was a stone. He was quite smart, but always kept to himself, even more so than Theo, and if he wasn't in Slytherin, Theo would have had no idea that he existed. Mason Jones, though, was the complete opposite. He was known for his time with the house elves, for he often worked alongside them, much to their dismay. He was an incredibly clumsy Hufflepuff and was constantly ridiculed in Potions when late Professor Snape was teaching, as Theo had heard around. He was kind of a ball of energy, and Crawley was the opposite.
Theo groans then glares icily at Potter. The latter has the decency to look apologetic and pats him on the back before returning to his respective table.
with anybody, did I? I get so..." He glances at his sticky sheets, and looks under them to see what Theo expects is nudity. "I
They eat mostly, greeting some familiar, younger Slytherins, and some eighth years. Soon Malfoy walks in, at his side is Pansy Parkinson and Gregory Goyle. A little Slytherin, maybe a second year, follows them, grasping Parkinson's robes — which appears to highly annoy her. Theo watches as they sit down a way down from him and Blaise, and wonders when Blaise chose him over them.
Draco looks up, finding a Potter watching him, intently. The former feels his cheeks heat up, but he trusts himself to will them to his normal pale complexion.
Potter."
"No, but I'm here," Gregory Goyle says, shortly, settling down on the other side of Ron, and next to Hermione.
Theo was originally scared that the born Slytherin wouldn't fall for his trickiness, but he seemed so anxious about Harry that he fell for it, easily.
feelings for each oth – "
my little angsty baby, draco
"Will it always be a dare if it lands on you?" Neville Longbottom asks, from his place next to Hannah Abbott.
Potter nods, looks up, and offers a smile.
Theo has a shit-eating grin on his face, when Ron saunters in, smirking. Ron quickly goes to his usual table with Hermione and now Pansy, and sits back to watch the show.
Theo grins, and shrugs. "I enjoy seeing everyone suffering because of the party that was a
The other two boys shrug, but Hermione looks displeased on not knowing Theo's plans.
Theo rolls his eyes and passes the vial to Harry. "Drink it. It's a Hangover Potion."
The circle laughs, despite the earlier tension, and even Davis cracks a small smile.
Every single student in the eighth year common room stares at him and Potter.
"What do you mean, Potter?" Draco winces as it comes out, and Potter erupts in laughter.
Never mind that. Now, The Theo Triumph — Potter thought of the terrible name, the imbecile — was in the bin with the rest of Draco's plots to defeat Potter, and Draco doesn't even have a Potter as an ally with him.
"Hermione!" Theo exclaims. She looks to Theodore, eyebrow arched. Theo flushes. "It's just... Okay, here: Harry's been super weird around Draco lately, like...
There were no shrieks, but Theo reckons they got the message when he got to the dorm that night with two vague messages of telling him they were sleeping somewhere else tonight.
Blaise studies the scene, then starts, "Goldstein, still?"
Still, he snaps, again. "What, Potter?"
"Yeah, well, about that, Professor," Harry seems ready to use the man's favoritism.
Blaise rolls his eyes. "You're hurting Slytherin's reputation by lying so obviously, Draco."
As they continue to annoy Malfoy, Theo's inner Hufflepuff urges him to stop it. "Okay, lay off it, guys," he says, and Malfoy looks, gratefully, at him. "His own secrets aren't hurting anybody."
Draco looks on, dumbfounded. "What?"
"Graphorn, Professor. For it's two long horns represent..." Draco zones off again.
A moment later, Harry stands. "I'll be taking a shower."
Harry is easily pulled in. "What? Why? Is it me?"
It was almost too easy.
Theo hurriedly goes on his bed and shifts the curtains a little.
The classroom silences, watching the events unfold. Theo mentally groans, and sends a meaningful look to Hermione.
Theo goes to tell her to kindly fuck off, before studying the situation.
That was their new method. They started trying to
She looks away from her gazing at Longbottom and focuses on Theo. "Nott? Yes?"
Theo hisses, swatting away Blaise's frantic hands in his hair.
i hope you enjoyed this fic as much as i enjoyed writing it! i wrote this a while ago, but every time that i revisit it, i like to tweak the words around to develop this version of theo more, and i think this is the best version yet! also, this was the first time i wrote drarry, pansmione, and blaise/ron (which are all pairings that i adore) and so this was such an adventure for me.
"Again, I did not
Then Theo's eyes flicker to them. "Did
The satisfied smile Parkinson has on her face makes him want to take whatever he said that triggered it, back.
"I'm going to bed. Wish me luck." He says his farewells to the other eighth years, and Blaise kisses his cheek, whispering, audibly: "Get Harry and Draco's hair, tonight. I've already got Ron's and Hermione's."
"I've noticed." The bushy-haired girl nods, dismissively. She holds up what appears to be a slip to get into the Restricted Section. "How'd you get this From Professor Flitwick?"
"Well, at least you're not sharing with Weasley," Blaise says, stretching on his bed. "Honestly, the boy is an oaf."
"Not really, but they're being incredibly annoying," he nods.
Theo searches the circle, and finally sees Harry, who is staring intently at his glass while swirling the liquid around.
"What, did they dip each other in Amortentia?" Theo hears someone whisper.
He walks away, but then Potter calls him. "Uh, Malfoy?"
But Draco isn't listening. "He hates me so much!"
"There's gonna be a quiz on Friday to check up on what we know — you
give him chocolate, are you?"
His hand was on his wand in an instant, but Theo placed a gentle hand on his.
to hide it from the public.
Potter opens his mouth, then closes it quickly, nodding with a smile, before looking back to his book.
"Oh, no," Theo grins, sinisterly. "I didn't tell them they were in love with each other, no. They simply just led into the trap of reading the box themselves."
"I'm not sniffing them!" Blaise's head shot upright, his expression indignant. "I'm... searching them."
"I don't bite, Harry," he says, grumpily, from his bed.
. You, who has been frowning at Slytherin ever since you set foot inside the castle."
"Hi," he breathes, heavily, from having run. "You need to do something about the living arrangement."
Incoherent mumbling is heard.
"Nothing that won't stay between you and me," Theo winks.
The boys nodded, confused as to why she asked a blatantly obvious question.
Harry scolds that stupid voice and attempts to think about other things than Malfoy's arse.
Theo gathers up his nonexistent Gryffindor courage. "So, I heard that we'll have a few more Hogsmeade visits. I was planning to go with Blaise, but I think he's having an existential crisis. So, would you like... Would you like to..."
"Theo, you naughty boy," Blaise laughs. "Anyways, is Draco here, yet?"
Draco glances, his gaze cruel, at Harry, before walking to his bed and pointedly pulling out a textbook.
It's silent for a while.
someone! Poor Malfoy, he must be in the worst relationship ever!
Theo mentally groans as his dorm mates exchange an awkward greeting when Draco walks through the door.
Theo sidles over and starts helping the other eighteen-year-old. When finished, he gives him a warm smile.
Blaise looks at Theodore, imploring. "What the hell is going on?"
Walking away, Theo sees Anthony Goldstein talking, animatedly, to a group of younger years. He catches his eye, and winks to Anthony, causing his eyes to widen, and his tan skin tints red.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I just don't get why they aren't snogging and shagging annoyingly yet," Theo complains as Blaise threads his fingers through his hair.
"...have all each other's classes together, always go to the library at the same time, and share a common room," Blaise fills, smirking.
And he flees the room.
She points to Ernie MacMillan and Millicent Bulstrode, who exchange fake googling eyes to each other. The class attempts to hide their snickers.
Then a repeat of earlier happens, this time getting them kicked out temporarily — surprisingly, Hermione just smiled.
"Draco!" Theo shouts, and Draco, surprised, looks to him. He flushes. "I'm not telling anyone, anything. As you may know, I brought Harry up as well and he said just as interesting things."
Draco didn't see him until two months later, where they were supposed to share a dorm together. Potter never brought it up, so neither did he.
"To Hermione Granger, of course!"
"Not to mention Harry's and Ginevra's," a voice calls, and Pansy Parkinson appears from behind another bookshelf. She leans elegantly against Hermione's chair. "I was eavesdropping, too, sue me."

Theo sighs, dejectedly. "Well, good job, you, but Draco and Harry aren't
"It's still here?" Theo asks. "After reconstruction?"
He shrugs at Blaise. "He's pretty powerful after being showered with promises of chocolate."
with a quick wrist turn to the left. An old party trick that lets some secret desires, ones that you may not even know about, into an invisible bowl of magic for a couple of hours; don't worry, we couldn't figure out whose is whose, even if we
"Honestly, I'd congratulate you on your first good insult, but unfortunately, I don't condone house division, and your comments aren't benefitting unity, so shame on you, Potter," Malfoy teases, a small smile that Harry praises, gracing his lips.
"Ron," Blaise says, warningly.
Blaise continues to stare at the ceiling. "I don't know what I see in him," he says, truthfully, almost sheepishly. Theo grins at him, and he winks.
Blaise waited four days after Christmas — rather impatiently, Theo might add — and all of the eighth years who left found a way to get back to Hogwarts.
Theo flushes. "Shuddup. They're both straight, and I'm not even gay."
Soon enough everyone catches on, and only sends furtive glances to the two, frozen boys.
count of these, so don't try anything!" He grins, eyes sparkling as he slowly charms the vials in the front of the room to the separate tables.
He rolls his eyes, leaning back. "What?"
"Well," Blaise shifts, "you did kind of inform them, bluntly."
Comes the drawl that Theodore Nott surely should've been used to, but alas, even after sharing a dorm with him for over seven years, he still cringed at Draco Malfoy's low, aristocratic voice.
"Can you just hear me out?"
have to make the best entrance?" Theo sighs, fondly, at his best mate.
after this. To a higher level.
And Harry honestly doesn't like her.
"Right when I think you're tolerable, you say things like this, Draco." She chews on bacon.
"Theodore Nott!" Blaise admonishes but looks a bit humored. "Why aren't you listening to me?!"
Ron chuckles, disbelievingly. "You're so shameless."
Even though he
?" Pansy says, not even hiding her wicked tone. "Terribly sorry, darling."
Abruptly, the door swings open. They all turn to see a flustered Weasley.
Theo gnaws his lip, then nods. "Harry, if you're worried about the party, don't. You were drunk. We all do, or say, crazy things while intoxicated. He's just wondering why you aren't speaking to him anymore," he leans in, and Harry does, too, "I think he misses you, to be brutally honest."
Theo arose from his internal monologue, and whisked around at the mention of his name, effectively hitting his head on the top of his chest. Wincing, he stood, stumbling only a tad.
"And I'm sure they're elated about that," Ginny adds, at which Hermione glares at her for, and Ron laughs in a rowdy tone.
Theo sighs. "Everyone knows it, Blaise."
"They're not bloody idiots, Laney," Davis snaps. "My parents are locked up, and my current home is a ghost house. Wonder why there's such a large number of Slytherins returning, too, Moon? Because we have
Theo groans, and as usual, Blaise laughs at him.
Hermione can't seem to get Draco calmed down, so Theo thinks, quickly. "
Theodore grins to himself as he finally enters the library alone on a Saturday. Peace and quiet.
"Of course!" Blaise smiles. "And Potter, by the way, is
Draco tries his luck with Crawley.

"Oh, you
He hears Joan Laney and Liliana Moon, and gapes. Laney was a known, reckless but quiet Slytherin, and Moon was a sweet Hufflepuff, but he distinctly remembers Laney wearing a pretty, little yellow flower behind her ear which didn't fit her character at all.
Draco snorts, and Theo watches excitedly as Harry looks up at him, and throws one to him. "You try it!"
Their heads swivel to Hermione, who's hand is open, and beneath her is a pile of glass and a pile of powder. Then they look to the doorway.
"Mate, there are
"And," he splutters, tears streaming down his pale face, "I don't know
Theo rolls his eyes, once again, and groans. "Come on, Blaise." He pulls him out of the dorm.
Theo grits his teeth. "Okay, unfair. Everyone liked either Potter or Diggory fourth year, and Malfoy passed puberty with an Outstanding in third. I'm not gay."
When the entire class finished, Slughorn charmed the vials closed, and Theo's two dorm mates look at their papers, confused.
"Must be with Boot," she mutters.
"You're too thin, you can't restrain either — " Hermione ignores his sound of protest " — Pansy, Theo, you two will unfreeze them on my word."
Theo's gaze is snapped away from Anthony's brown eyes. "What?"
"Yeah, sure, whatever. Listen, I got a plan for Harry and Draco." Theo's expression turns childishly excited.
Longbottom sends him another pointed look. "First move? Me? Thanks for the vote of confidence, mate, but that won't work."
The Gryffindor gnaws his lip, and barely conceals his hesitant look-around. Students rush around the two former rivals to get to dinner, and Granger is still listening in, raptly.
The two Slytherins stare at him.
Draco openly gawks at her, and Potter looks at her, confused. "Who, is my question," he says.
"What will Harry
While passing what seems to be Boyle's dormitory, he sees Granger talking to a panicked-looking Parkinson. Curious, he nears, but then Granger slams the door shut after pushing Parkinson in.
Blaise frowns. "Potter doesn't work that way. He'd forgive you, hell, even Draco, if you guys tried. And anyway I was talking about how he'd be happy to have the opportunity of fucking. He'll think with his dick."
"It's weird," he complained from laying on Blaise's bed. "They don't even walk around shirtless anymore."
That is, until Theo's former best mate and current enemy, Blaise Zabini, broke out into fits of laughter. Soon followed Weasley, and then the whole room broke out. Even Granger was giggling.
Blaise eyes him. "You're not gonna
"Yes," Anthony's brown eyes twinkle. "I'd like to. As a... I'd like to go on a date with you."
Although large, the armchair still makes their sides touch. Electricity swarms through Draco's body at the touch, and he almost gasps. His nose is filled with a nice, woody smell, and the scent of treacle tart, and one last hint of something so unexplainably
"Right," agrees Harry, much to his disappointment. He quickly shoulders Ginny for her stupid snickering and swipes up an apple before standing and following Malfoy to the entrance of the Great Hall.
Shortly, no more than three minutes later, the two walk out, looking very uncomfortable.
Blaise smiles, basking in the praise. "Of course, Pansy, love. What'd you expect?"
"Shuddup, Nott." Weasley flushes darker and glares playfully at Theo. Theo laughs.
Slughorn blinks. "Yes, of course! Everyone get back to work. Go over your Amortentia scents, then get ready for the — the other potion." He doesn't give further instruction and looks rather bummed out.
You can't possibly think it's a good idea to room us together."
"Well," Hermione starts, "shouldn't we be getting back to our work?"
Harry's eyes opened wide, a green fire not doused by the water.
"Mmm," Blaise trails, thinking about Weasley. Then he shakes his head. "Isn't he a little preoccupied with Granger?"
Pansy sniffs. "You were ignoring us. And we're here, anyways."
said, either."
"They're waiting for me to go in there," Theo repeats, plopping down on the edge of Blaise's bed.
Theo laughs as they walk into the Great Hall. He's become more talkative since the war, and he assumes he's just become more confident now that his parents are locked up, and his brother, Leonardo, and he are in the care of their considerably more sane aunt and uncle. His parents monitored his every action and word and constantly criticized his decisions. When his brother was born, thirteen years after his own birth, they put even more pressure on him.
Draco glares, hotly.
There stands a slightly flustered Anthony Goldstein. He smiles at Theo.
Draco follows him to a hidden alcove. It didn't matter much, anyway, considering that everyone is in the Great Hall, eating.
"Of course you don't fancy — " Hermione stops. "Hey, Harry."
on Theo."
Blaise raises his cup of alcohol to her.
They chose the sofa, and two, large armchairs next to the fireplace. Hermione sits on the sofa, legs tucked in a crisscross position, and Ron sits against the sofa. Her fingers thread through his hair, and he looks relaxed. Pansy lays across the other two seats of the sofa with her feet tucked under Hermione. Greg sits next to Ron on the floor and studiously observes the fire with a distant look. Blaise, on the armchair closer to the fire, inadvertently stares at Ron and Hermione, looking distinctly troubled. Theo, next to Blaise, seems to be staring at a different eighth year who is studying with some others (which Draco really ought to look into). And Potter is alone in his armchair, further from the fire, and is very obviously avoiding eye contact with Draco.
Now, Theo giggles, childishly, and wonders how it's still like that a week later. Even Blaise, who Theo always thought of as the most — despite their sorting — brave boy in his grade, couldn't pick up the nerve to approach Weasley on the matter.
"Weasley, Granger," Blaise nodded, and Theo rolled his eyes. His crush on Ron is becoming overwhelming, and Theo wonders when he'll figure out the two aren't actually dating.
Theo grins, secretly, to himself. He knows what happened. He actually woke up extra early this morning, and on his way from the showers, he saw Blaise in only his underpants in the middle of the hallway. Theo took to dragging him to his dorm, where he saw the half-naked Weasley sleeping on the ground. He then went forth with his plan.
Not in the mood to help McGonagall's plan to inter-house unity, he falls to his bed, closes the curtains, and falls asleep.
"No, he never will!" Draco spits. "I'm vile and disgusting! I wasn't even good at being a
Harry Potter,
She flushes, but smiles. "Do you happen to know where Pansy is? I mean, Pansy, Draco and Greg?"
Theo looks up, arching a brow. "No," he mutters, but Blaise has already hauled him up and sat down.
Not at all.
Never mind being wasted.
The silent, brooding, Russian Slytherin has everyone's attention now. He takes a swig of an unknown vodka, then shrugs.
pick Potter up on Saturday after breakfast, weekly. Merlin, he hasn't done that in a while.
I fancy him! He's a hundred percent Gryffindor and sappy, but he's just so... so...
Draco nods, quickly, and lets out a sigh. Whether disappointed or relieved, he doesn't know and doesn't think he wants to. For his own damn sanity.
"Well, you can't expect just
The words read. Tracey took a swig of Firewhiskey.
Blaise shifts. "I mean - "
The best pair of bloody
He stares back, before looking down. "How do you win a staring contest when there's so many pairs of eyes?"
Abruptly, a loud laugh sounds out, and the three look up.
Draco's insides warm. "No, I am not."
Theo stifles a grin, and Hermione sends him a skeptical glance. "Hey, I just delivered the chocolate! Harry was the one who offered it to Draco, and ended up like... this."
," he says, sounding smug with his argument.
So, of course, Theo went to Blaise.
Harry. It's no fair." He pouts, childishly.
He honestly couldn't even enjoy them, the idiots.
"Well," Theo splutters. "Have you tried — Well, you know... Making the first move?"
Theo let his gaze fall to Gina Sallis, who sits a few seats away from Goldstein. She whispers fervently to a Hufflepuff while plainly pointing to Harry — who stays oblivious.
(See the end of the chapter for
"No, it's all over victory and a winner to their rivalry," Theo snaps, and that catches the other two attentions. He flushes but waves them off, dismissively.
Stop!"
Theo rolls his eyes at the three, wondering how the hell he ended up in his current predicament.
But honestly, how can he mouth something, expecting Harry to look to his lips without being so...
Theo gawks. "It's only been..."
"So, I should just act like before?" Draco asks, wringing his hands, anxiously.
Theodore walks swiftly to his bed, looking through his school work. Malfoy turns to Harry, an angry and a tad upset expression on his face.
Harry shakes his head, mouth opening. "No, but – "
right?"
"It was only a couple of Ravenclaws... Oh, Sallis was definitely there," Ron cringes, looking at him, apologetically. "I'll explain it to Harry if he gives you any trouble."
"Theo isn't dating anyone. Malfoy and I would've already found out," Harry says, wincing when he felt himself almost say
"They want to hear you confirm it," Hermione says, absentmindedly. She flicks through Ron's schoolwork, and everyone ignores Ron's protests. "A
Blaise lets his eyes scan the room as well. His grin falters, and everyone strains their necks to look at what he's seeing.
Theo sends him a very rude gesture and receives laughter from the crowd.
Pansy takes on an innocent expression. "Yes, but MacMillan wanted to sit next to his girlfriend instead of Longbottom. See, it's their one month anniversary."
didn't I?"
"Huh?" Blaise asks, lamely.
"Threesome with Draco and Harry," she says, wickedly.
She turns, eyebrow raised at him. "Mister Nott."
Draco sits next to Theodore at the Slytherin table, and leans on his elbow, watching the boy eat.
Potter plops down in the seat next to him. "Mind if I sit here?" He gives a boyishly charming smile to Theo.
?" Theo's eyebrows furrow in confusion.
"Right? Are he and Ron together yet?" Longbottom asks.
That is until he sees the dorm in its usual condition.
Not that it's a bad thing, Theo has been cherishing this small break, but it's strange, indeed.
But it was different now.
"Next thing you know, Crawley is going to come out," Harry mutters.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry sighs, rubbing his face from emotion, as he sits in his space at the Gryffindor table.
He started, his hand on his wand before he even realized it.
He admitted to himself that maybe he was a little keen on Cedric Diggory, just a bit, in his fourth year — what with his charms, abilities, and kindness. And he grudgingly reminded himself from time to time about what he thought of Viktor Krum when he first saw him on a broomstick.
"No, not actually. If they're in denial deep enough, then they'll think of anything to get out of the situation. It's what people do when they're afraid of love," Blaise taps his nose, twice, arrogance blatant in his face. Theo was close to responding to how ironic his "discovery" was, but he kept his mouth shut.
"Wonder why," Pansy snorts.
Then, triumphantly, Potter smirks past his shoulder. Theo drops his hand and looks back to Malfoy, who is stabbing his egg with enough force to move a Hungarian Horntail.
"Nope, nope, nope." Theo sprints across the room to the door. "Do not include me in your silly fights. I will not be choosing aside, and am just here for my education. Good luck with not killing each other, I'm going to go take a shower."
Blaise nods, but Theo gapes. "Apparently I missed the memo, sorry?"
The eighth year consists of a returning twenty-nine people, but with the addition of other years, Blaise summed it up to at least fifty people, which is gonna be crowded but memorable. Which is all that matters, in Blaise's eyes.
"Why don't you go tonight?" Draco asks, catching on. "Harry and I were planning a date on Friday, so tonight will be your guys'."
Daphne turns a bright red, askew from her usual confident attitude, and loud laughter sounds around the crowd. "What a perfect way to start the game," Ginny groans.
Theo knew something was up with the two.
on this?! Always let me proofread your Potions essays unless you plan to fail your last year!"
Theo hesitantly walks back to his own dorm, sighing when he hears more arguing coming from inside.
"Yes, well, that same day Harry found out he was bisexual," Hermione glares to a cowering Blaise, "much to his confusion. Then, again, Pansy Parkinson told Draco that Harry knew he was gay, much to Draco's embarrassment. We assume Draco wanted to tell Harry later on, considering everything they've done to...
Harry and Draco were avoiding eye contact, and Theo had to start a hesitant conversation that crashed and burned and they ended up just leaving to the Great Hall with their former house partners.
"Just gave him a peek," Blaise dismisses. "Anyways, you're in gay heaven. Draco isn't at all bad on the eyes, and come on, we
"The Hufflepuffs were crying when you didn't pick him up on Saturday breakfasts like you usually do," Greg informs. He momentarily looks like he's confused about why he knows this, before shrugging and settling into his pie.
Draco gives her a warning look, and she raises her hands in defense. That's a... touchy subject.
Theo looks at Anthony Goldstein, who looks at him at the same time. They blush simultaneously, like normal, and then Anthony winks. Theo's insides warm.
"Ron - " Hermione starts, but he's out of the library in a second.
Harry barely glanced at the potion before downing it. He yawns, and looks instantly relieved. "Thanks, Theo. What happened last night?"
"I don't know, Harry," Theo says, casually. "Ever since he's found out that you found out he was gay, he's been hesitant around you."
Back then, Harry had a purpose. And he doubted that anyone would think of his sexuality after the Triwizard Tournament's turn of events. Back then, no one worried about that. Back then, he was to defeat the Terrorizer of the Wizarding World.
to be ready for that," she goes on. "And writing
They both stand there for some time, staring at places other than each other.
"True," Blaise agrees. "I thought Sallis would be dead by the time they found out."
to say that Dra- Malfoy is
Theo huffs, offended, and mumbles something, incoherently.
Hermione shifts, then set down Ron's old parchments and looked to the Slytherins. "Well, as you know, Harry found out Draco's gay."
And it doesn't look like it'll be improving any time soon.
"Shall we talk?" Draco asks, kind of impatient.
Pansy and Hermione blink at him. Pansy pipes, "That's brilliant, Theo."
Blaise barely stifles a snort. Malfoy continues to stare at his book.
, Ron. Blaise knows all. I already knew you all were staying."
, love?"
(See the end of the chapter for
They sit on their respective, opposite sides, and contently watch Theo walk across the room.
Poor Weasley. Blaise
"Blimey, mate. That's just rude," Weasley frowns.
But Malfoy didn't sit next to them. No, he sat next to
Draco let out a soft laugh. "The same about Pansy. Bye, Potter." Potter gives a small, adorable wave as a response.
for sticking your nose where it doesn't belong."
It's literally been six days into the school year, and he's already exhausted.
Draco goes to yell at him again, but Harry cuts him off — "Malfoy, Pince." — which immediately silences him. Theo almost smirks, but a glance at Draco quickly changes his mind.
Yeah. Maybe McGonagall was right to mix up the houses.
bad."
Harry's head shoots up, and he says, what he thinks was, very casually: "Boot?"
Theo looks questioningly at them, but shrugs. Hermione and Pansy are gone, as well. It won't matter, anyways. They're all drunk.
"Why in damnation are you always blushing, Weasley?" Theo asks, kind of fondly. He'd like to think they get along.
Hermione flushes a darker red, but nods nonetheless, and follows Pansy. Theo watches, entranced, at how they look together; two extremely clever women emanating beauty and brilliance. They look like the most powerful couple in wizarding history, with Pansy's arm snugly fit around Hermione's waist and Hermione's head tilted in the other woman's space — they look like they have the secret to the universe and you'd have to do the impossible: separate them to get it.
Draco has already kissed Granger sweetly, and had given an awkward lap dance to one Ronald Weasley, and looked relieved to see it was only Theo. He gives a reassuring smile, and Theo gives one back, before landing his lips on his.
Murmurs of confusion roll through the crowds.
"Let's take this somewhere else, shall we, boys?" Theo asks, in a quick, hushed tone.
He and Potter worked remarkably together. Granger would constantly tease the two of them. Saying they were the best pair she'd ever seen.
Malfoy turns, quickly, sniffing loudly, and studying his book without really reading. "No, not really."
Theo's eyes widen, and his heart plummets. "I mean - If you want to. I was actually thinking more of... As a date."
"It's the most peculiar thing that people think that all Slytherins are the same. I witnessed a
"Do I?" McGonagall quires. "Why? Are Misters Malfoy and Potter harming you?"
Theo flushed but nonetheless argued. "Most people just think that because he's the 'Saviour'."
Blaise nods, collecting food on his plate. "Mostly Potter, though. The other two just get dragged along."
Blaise grins. "Knew I could count on you, love. Go ahead, spin my wand."
"Why?!" Draco yells in his other ear before pacing again. "
When Harry returns, Draco automatically turns to ruffle through his bag, and Harry looks put out. Theo almost accepted defeat, when Draco piped up, conversationally. "So do you know the answer to that silly Charms question that Flitwick assigned, Potter?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco snorts. "You're even more oblivious than Harry."
Pansy waves, dismissively. "Oh, don't tease him, darling. There's so much more."
The three male dorm mates spin to see Weasley and Granger gaping in the doorway.
She shrugs, and smiles, sheepishly. "Had to catch your attention, sorry."
McGonagall continued. "I put my faith in both of you to become the men you have been growing to be, and to develop acquaintance with each other. I also put my faith into Mister Nott, to his abilities, and strongly believe he will be able to hold back any rough arguments that may arise."
Draco lets out a low whine that's only heard by a few people around him. He nods, top lip between white teeth, and he goes looking for another seat, as well.
Blaise slowly nods. "I see where you're coming from. Blunt and factual... right?"
"But then," Theo adds, smirking, "of course, like I said,
They start laughing again, and the Blaise chokes out, "It's like not knowing that you're bisexual!"
The two Slytherins nod, and gradually the conversation shifts away from Harry and Draco to school stuff and other things. If anyone looked at the four eighteen-year-olds, no one would guess that, before August, the pairs ignored and hated each other's existence.
Potter grins widely at his efforts. "No. That's long gone. I think she's a lesbian."
But of course, when he told
Both Malfoy's and Potter's eyes linger on Theo's laughing face enough to make him uncomfortable. Potter clears up first, shaking his head. "Really? Oh."
Theo groans at his unfortunate results of having two dramatic dorm mates and nudges Draco with his knee. "Everything is fine."
The Boy merely laughs, harder.
Theo sighs, running a hand down his face. "That's my fault. I set them up so that when they woke up it looked like they had shagged."
Theo spins. "By competing with each other to see who can become my friend first? This is barbaric! You two can try what you want, but I'm not breaking. Just leave me alone."
The four eighteen-year-olds send one another glances.
Abruptly, Hermione and Ron stop laughing, Harry flushes and his expression turns curious, and Blaise just gnaws his lip at the heavy gazes on him: Harry's confused, Hermione's upset, and Ron's amused.
dorm," Blaise says, but then looks at Harry whose eyes are hyperfocused on something behind him. "Harry, is something wrong?"
"Thanks, love," Blaise graces them with a charming smile even in his hungover state, and Ginny snorts.
Draco nods back, and goes to leave, but then asks: "And you... You aren't with... With the Weaslet — Ginevra?" He scrunches up his nose in concentration.
"I think we're ready," Blaise smiles, standing up. "Everyone get up!"
Theo smiles back but suddenly frowns when Blaise pulls harshly on a strand of hair.
They all looked to Theo, who felt a little sick. Malfoy was literally the only classmate he couldn't beat in late-night Slytherin duels. And of course: how on
"Like a wet dream," Theo says, bluntly. Blaise beams at him, Vanishing the mirror and checking the time. "Where are the others, again?"
"And a part of Lockhart's history," Ron cackles, and Hermione sends him a disapproving look.
Theo glares, hotly. "Shuddup. I actually thought he was interested in that seventh year — Georgia or Gikle or something like that..."
The room silenced and watched as Potter slowly dragged his body and chest to the two Slytherins, and settled uncomfortably next to Theo, pointedly ignoring Malfoy and Blaise.
okay, next chapter is from harry's pov, and it's pretty fun :) hope you enjoyed this one; kudos, comments, and bookmarks are always appreciated <3
they were involved, not if they were
"Please, Nott, do not talk to him. The Gryffindor is going to spoil our intelligence with his irritating verbal etiquette," Malfoy says, eyes flickering to Potter.
Blaise looks up from his book, and Weasley quickly moves his gaze from Blaise to Theo.
"Look at his arms and tell me that his title granted him it. No, the bloke is just hot. Anyways, didn't you used to fancy Potter?" Blaise furrows his eyebrows.
Greengrass shakes her head, and Blaise quiets everyone down. "Come on, Greengrass. What're you gonna do?"
Theo gives a small shake of his head. "No, I reckon they didn't. The lust potion must mean only lust — nothing too intimate. Harry had automatically taken off Draco's shirt."
"Now,
McGonagall gives a surprising chuckle. "They're teenage boys. You can't expect anything less of them. I know you're more mature for your age, but understand that those two are born competitors. They enjoy fighting. And I just saw them in a deep conversation without throwing an insult, so I believe this is helping everybody. Now, please excuse me, I have a meeting to attend."
Tracey leans back, and everyone watches her. She huffs. "Well, I'm in fucking Slytherin, aren't I?"
"Draco," Theo tries again to no avail.
"He's asleep," Theo says, reassuringly, but then frowns. "That, or he's wanking, but either way, he won't hear you."
Harry spins on his two friends. "What just happened?"
"He's going to the library, so I need you to set up the dorm in a romantic manner," Malfoy informs Harry as they settle in an empty corridor a little ways away from the Hall. "Can you do that?"
After a moment, Ron pipes up. "Did Blaise spend the night?" Ron quires, trying to look uninterested.
Really he didn't see it as a big deal — Blaise Zabini has been an open pansexual for a couple of years now, and plenty of people still like him. Even Ron, who, although he hasn't come out yet, is bi, and when he came to this conclusion no one treated him differently. When they didn't know, of course. (That's a funny thought. He's the same person as before — personality exactly the same — but with just
Theo looks, bewildered, to Ron, but he just shrugs and stares at something
"What?" Ron asks.
Theo feels a smirk creep on.
Draco stills, lips in a thin line, and Theo can almost
Abruptly, Theo notices that his two dorm mates have successfully listened to their entire conversation, and the two quickly look away when he acknowledges them.
He doesn't think twice. "Hey, Abbott!"
Theo's eyebrows furrow, and he sits in the chair next to Ron and Harry. "I was eavesdropping, how is that a bad idea?"
Theo glares. "They were going to kill me if I
"Come on, Malfoy," Theo urges, and Blaise smirks. "Do you fancy anyone?"
"Come on, Theo. Think about the possibilities! With them pining over you, you could have anything you want!"
Blaise sits up. "You didn't?!"
"How do you know?" Harry asks, accusingly.
"Hey, Ron, Hermione," Theo greets.
Draco swallows air, and below him, Ron pats his leg, comfortably. "Go on, Draco. Harry has tons of room."
Theo laughs. "Whoever's that was knew it was theirs because they stopped desiring it."
There was an encounter that changed Theo's routine up a bit, though. A while ago, Draco had led Theo back to the dorm, only to be met with Harry leaving hurriedly, and then Harry not returning till the next day. Ever since then, they've been working separately.
Hermione looks to him, then to Potter. "Harry, scoot for Draco. He wants to sit down."
"Oh, please, Ronald. We've known Harry long enough to know when he's actually in harm and when he's just being dramatic," Hermione rolls her eyes.
Everyone watches as she gnaws her lip, and weighs her options. (Theo could've sworn she glanced at Ginny.) Then suddenly stands up and grabs Ron by the arm, pulling him to the closet, choosing the dare. Blaise snarls a harsh insult towards Greengrass, lowly, in Theo's ear, and Theo shoves him.
Theo sighs, dejectedly. That was rather anticlimactic. He takes out the needed ingredients and starts making the silly Stench Potion that Slughorn assigned yesterday. Hermione sends him a sympathetic look before returning to her own potion.
Blaise turns to Malfoy. "Hey, Draco, you got any fancies?"
Abruptly, Draco leaves the classroom, parchment still clutched in his hand. Theo looks at Harry. "Well? Are you going to go after him?"
"Mason," Crawley says, simply, throwing his arm over the back of the chair.
It's Saturday, and Theo always spends his morning in the Hogwarts library. Harry, for once instead of Draco, accompanied him.  Theo found this a good opportunity to talk about what's been stressing him.
"Ah," Potter nods. Draco sees his smile out of the corner of his eye. "And how on Earth do you make my last name sound like an insult every time you use it?"
Draco scowls as he scrawls the Ancient Runes instructions into his notes. Granger, from beside him, gives him a curious look. He waves her off, dismissively, before continuing to write in his worst handwriting.
harming him, but
Merlin, is everybody in this damned eighth year oblivious?!
Ron huffs. "Yeah, but moral support."
"He won't, though," Theo insists. "He's still avoiding me. As well as Draco."
"Honestly, Ron, how long have you been searching for me? Everyone knows I go to the library at this time,]." Theo looks at a heavily breathing Ron. This must be what Blaise's wet dreams look like. "Never mind that, everything's settled. We had a little chat."
why would I be good at anything else?!"
Harry pulls away, looking content, then frowning and taking a swig out of a bottle.
"Okay." Harry nods, firmly, then goes to walk forward. "I'll do that right now."
"Sure, Granger," a posh voice drawls. They turn to see a satisfied Draco Malfoy standing a foot behind Harry, smirking. "No funny business going on here — just didn't want to miss breakfast, that still has thirty minutes to go."
"Why'd they be... be in the library together?" Harry asks, very,
"That's terrible," Theo was astonished.
And Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter were shirtless.
Harry shoots up, and his dorm mates look to him, surprised. He flushes. "I gotta- Go find- bye!"
joke. "Malfoy been keeping you up, eh, Harry?"
The room was sort of in the shape of a pentagon. The door was at its base, along with Potter's and Malfoy's chests at its sides, and Malfoy's bed was to the right, whereas Potter's to the left. Two windows separated the spaces between Theo's and the other two's beds, and Theo's was at the point of the room. His chest was against the foot of his bed like his old dorm. There were seats at the two windows, and the sheets decorating the beds, and the theme color was a dark purple — no more segregation to the eighth year students. They still wore their house badge on their robes, but with a purple badge underneath to show they were eighth years.
Parvati piped up. "I was, but Blaise told me how exciting this was going to be, so... I came back."

He smirks, playfully. "Guess that's for me to know."

"Has Potter been speaking to you about me? Or Malfoy?" Theo asks.
"You know we can't control our urges," Harry says, cheekily. "Besides, who knows — someone might dose us with a lust potion."
, let's all be best friends," Malfoy drawled, again. "Why need Granger and Weasley, when you have me and Nott?"
party game. You'll regret not doing the dare or body shots."
Theo grins at him, taking one of his slices of bacon. "You love me, don't you, Zabini?" he teases, lightly.
Theo bites his lip. "I've got an idea, but not good enough. I'll get back to you."
Malfoy gives a small shrug, looking a tad sheepish himself, but still looks victorious at the small success against Potter.
"Pansy never should've told him Harry knew. It set us back, remarkably," Hermione scolds herself.
did you make her buy a lust potion?!"
Pansy fidgets nervously, and Hermione turns to her. "Stop worrying so much, Pansy. I've got a couple of emergency antidotes back in my trunk. This is not even close to the first time this has happened to Harry since the war is over."
The Gryffindor is looking up now, with his brilliant green eyes searching Draco's.
But Draco looks ready to shake it off, and Theo panics, but then Slughorn showed his first signs of owning a brain.
After several minutes, Theo stands, slowly. He eases his hair back into their natural curls, but Blaise swats his hand away, so only one braid remains at the top of his head.
i would say poor, oblivious harry, but he's been essentially torturing theodore with his attractiveness, so he and draco will just have to deal with it >:) hope you enjoyed this one!
It sparks an idea in Theo.

"Yeah, there's loads," Hermione continues. "For instance... Ernie Macmillan and Millicent Bulstrode."
"You get to snog Draco
passing this up!"
Theo frowns. "How do you know about Harry and Draco?"
Draco frowns, but silences all the same.
But the other two obviously didn't trust him, because both turned around and asked other students what it was. But all twenty-nine eighth-year students were in the room, and all of them wanted Harry and Draco to get together. The two returned to the table, dissatisfied.
Pansy sniffs, once again. "You offended me earlier."
Draco shifts in his seat, avoiding eye contact. "How does everyone know we were avoiding each other?" he mutters, darkly.
Theo groans, then brightens at the sight of Neville Longbottom and Hannah Abbott walking through the eighth year curtain.
"Well, when I went to the library, to uh, you know — look for you, to
He opens the door, and throws the chocolate to Harry, casually. "One of your fans told me to give that to you."
Harry blinks. "You're not dating Malfoy?"
"No, I'm comfy." She wears a small smile that the only other person that would notice would probably be Greg. Her eyes are closed. "Go sit next to Harry, he has room."
Draco gapes at her, but Greg simply pushes past them and settles in next to Ron, who is seated on the ground. Pansy follows shortly.
Harry scrambles from his bed to catch up with Draco, whose hand is on the door. Theo rolls his eyes.
Sure enough, the crowd parts to greet a very attractive trio. Ron, indeed, is wearing the tight, blue shirt Blaise bought him. Hermione is looking gorgeous in a white, appropriate dress, and hair tied up. And Harry, the sex image, is looking unusually alluring in average Muggle clothes.
"You were planning to
They attack each other, and Theo watches, horrified, as Harry tears Draco's shirt off.
Hermione attempts to get everyone back to the actual lesson, but Pansy rolls her eyes and slings an arm around her. Greg, flushed but grinning, talks to a pretty, smiling Padma Patil. Crawley talks happily to Finnegan, and Jones stands there, beaming. Joan Laney and Liliana Moon are talking animatedly to Kendall Baker and Oliver River — all from different houses. Theo eyes Blaise and Ron, who have that eternal awkward air around them as they talk quietly, and he almost laughs out loud when he sees that Blaise's cheeks were darker than normal.
Ron gapes, and Harry's eyes widen into saucers.
Ron glares, half-heartedly, and shoves more bacon in his mouth.
Theo gapes after her.
Theo quickly pushes the other boy's face away but doesn't manage to stop his snorts of laughter. "Harry, stop. I'm not Draco."
Hermione shrugs. "They act pretty domestically. Like right now."
Theo almost vomits.
of his sexual preferences.
The three dorm mates erupt in laughter, and Theo smiles, fondly, at them, before taking on a warning expression. "No nonsense in the dorm, boys."
Blaise smirks. "Well, of course, Theodore. And has a remarkably white smile," he flashes his pearly whites.
"She's killing me, Nott. She's so gorgeous, and she doesn't even know it. She keeps on kissing my cheek, but never my lips.
Theo grins, sheepishly. "They were really nice."
"He is rather attractive, isn't he? I do hope he comes back from the shower without a shirt," Blaise comments, absentmindedly.
Longbottom stares at him. "What."
Theo smirks, despite himself. "That's the good part. If you don't do the task, you have to take body shots off of the person you like. Mind you, your desired person can deny the body shots, then you just have to deal with
Weasley looks around. "I'll be here, too. Some things are going on at home that I don't wanna be present for."
Draco shakes his head, sheepish but keeping an impassive front. He's been prone to being more expressive, lately. He blames the war.
Malfoy looked up then, from his station of sorting through some parchments from his bag, and he didn't even
"We're fine, Theo. Closer than ever," Harry assures him as they take a trip to the library.
(When he saw Ginny Weasley, he immediately allowed it, though, because that girl knows how to party.)
Harry sits there.
Harry let out a low whine. "He said something about wanting to see it, before, and he seemed really interested, so I thought we could just scope out the area."
Harry gapes.
"Mate, he didn't
"Hey," Theo breathes.
Hermione peers over from her respective spot in the back of the class. Her eyes twinkle. "He
"Yes, but they're still not certain on each other's feelings," Blaise says, exasperated. "The box — what did it say?"
Theo blushes and rolls his eyes. The new couple go over to Slughorn, who was watching them with an endearing look.
(See the end of the chapter for
Someone.
Theo flushes red. "Why must you have such a dirty mouth?"
Theo splutters as he is left utterly alone. Then spins.
Draco stands, posture rigid, and tries to get his breathing under control.
Blaise nods and smiles, fondly. "Oh, yeah. Hope he wears it, anyways. And stop messing up your eyebrows."
. Had a chat with your Granger this morning. Of course,
"What?" Harry repeats, lamely, as he stumbles back to the window.
Pansy snorts, but Blaise is already gone. She looks up, then stands, as well. "Hermione, would you like to go to the dorm? I have a few assignments I need help on."
Before he can come to the Ravenclaw's assistance, though, he heard a very loud sob.
"Oh well, I wasn't paying attention," Theo shrugs. "All we have to do is sniff it, it should be fine."
Harry glance between Draco's retreating form, then to Theo. "I don't..."
Something.
Nonetheless, Theo held his tongue, unlike Potter. "Sorry, professor, but why are you telling us this, now?"
The groans and people laugh at his misfortune. He doesn't understand why. Harry, Rogers, a Hufflepuff Theo can't remember the name of, and two younger years already have their shirts off, and a few people are nearly naked. Including one Ginny Weasley, who is discreetly rubbing against a shirtless Luna Lovegood, currently.
"If you don't say that these potions were from me then you'll find out," Theo says, cheerfully (and ever a Slytherin), much to Blaise's disdain.
Theo smiles, cheekily, and Hermione answers his question, "He wants their first date to be in the
They greet each other like they're at an important gala. Neither will be attending one, anytime soon. Theo momentarily wonders if Blaise is trying to pretend that that's what this is.
this, Blaise said he was being a little whining baby.
"Well, when you put it that way..." Blaise trailed off, and they burst out in laughter. "Is that one of your fantasies, Theo?" Blaise chokes out.
?" Malfoy rolls his eyes, foot tapping the ground, impatiently.
The majority of the circle calms at that, but the Slytherins give little shakes of their heads.
A collective agreement is sounded around, but Theo sees someone — a younger year, presumably — leave the circle, discreetly. Blaise glances at the empty spot, then to Theo, clearly upset, but Theo reassures him with a look.
It was rather easy to get Gina to buy the love potion, two days after he found out her obsession with Harry. She had heard him blabbering on about them in Hogsmeade, and she bought one in an instant.
Then the entire class breaks into cheers, and Slughorn looks teary-eyed.
He groans as the determined Gryffindor, and the stubborn Slytherin, walk over to him.
Theo thinks that maybe houses don't mean that much after all.
"You'll crack, buddy," Potter pats his back.
Draco grits his teeth, but nonetheless, turns and slowly sits down next to Potter.
So, now, Theo stands in front of the flawless looking host, Blaise Zabini, who is about to throw the party of the century. With guest of honor, Harry Potter, of course.
Draco is still crying when he gets there, but is able enough to choke out: "Harry?"
Oh, they're in deep.
Ron sits up, quickly, from his sitting position. "What?!" he cries.
Draco's head snaps up, grey eyes immediately catching green.
"Great, I owe you, love," Theo grins.
Blaise looks, praisingly, at him, and Ron glares, half-heartedly, at him.
Harry flushes. "That's not why–!" His eyes widen, and then he starts walking backward. "I have to go explain to him. Sorry, Theo, I'll meet up with you later."
Draco sits in the corner of the room, arms wrapped around a bottle of Firewhiskey, and is mumbling things to himself.
Draco sniffs, loudly, before beaming at Theo. "Thanks, Theo. Can you love me?"
Blaise grins and pats his best friend on the head. "Yes, I do, my dear Theo. Hermione and I are arranging something."
He feels another body at his side, and a tan chest is in his view. "Really, let me help," Potter whispers.
With his two dorm mates, frozen and half-naked with raging boners on the floor, he does what any eighth-year student does in a time of need.
Draco fucking Malfoy was not supposed to look so damn good in just his boxers.
Theo rolls his eyes, then drags Draco up the stairs again.
"Seriously, Draco!" Granger scolds as they exit the Study of Ancient Runes classroom, and venture down the corridors to the Great Hall. "If you don't start paying closer attention, you're gonna lose track of class. You don't even have all of the needed notes for today!"
There was a half-naked couple in the corner, a very passed out Padma Patil hovering in mid-air, and a few other sleeping figures in the room. Along with Theo, sits Blaise Zabini on one of the large armchairs, groaning to himself.
Draco!"
"Okie dokie, Theo," Blaise sings, going back to drunkenly snogging a very drunk Ronald Weasley.
Theo attaches the letter to a brown, tawny, school owl, and watches as it flies off. He grins at it.
He really just wants to go home to Leo.
Ron coughs. "I'm still here."
"Hello, Nott," the blonde purred.
He had hoped Ron woke up first, but either way, they were going to be in torture trying to remember what happened. Which is, all in all, great.
When Theo makes it to their room, Harry is once again trying to undress him. He pushes the Gryffindor on his respectable bed, and then gasps when Harry immediately starts to tear off his trousers and pants.
"Like I want Malfoy as a mate," Potter responds, icily.
"So..." Harry says, wearily. "You... We were just in a wrong situation."
"Day?"
"Look where you want, you'll find some," Blaise responds, mysteriously.
wants to.
Theo bites his lip, before raising his hand to shake with Potter.
he's feeling like that.
Theo peers at them.
Potter cocks an eyebrow, before realizing what Draco said. "Yeah, yeah, of course. Follow me."
"Draco and Greg are hidden away with Pansy in her dorm. And the Gryffindors took mine," he grins, cheekily. "Wonder what Ron is going to wear. Hopefully that tight, navy blue shirt he has."
"Yeah. They're gonna be competing to see who can break you enough to want to join their side of the dorm. You can definitely use this to your advantage." Blaise looks off, thoughtfully. "With Potter's influence, and Draco's money... Mmm. And their bodies altogether."
Theo slides through the crowds, wondering exactly what this night will lead to.
Theo thinks back, fondly, of the awkward events after that morning.
Harry's face contorts in horror. "Oh, fuck... I didn't...
He rolls his eyes, but Blaise takes it in, smiling, fondly. "I think it's cute," he says, lowly enough for neither of the boys to hear. "They're really competitive, but it's all over you."
But Pansy smirked at him.
"Miss Granger?" Professor Babbling moves on, and Draco catches Hermione's worried glance his way.
Longbottom shakes his head.
It's the first Sunday of term, and he watches as both of his stalkers walk out of the hall, McGonagall following, shortly. Theo stuffs his face with a piece of toast before saying a quick bye to Blaise and running out.
"You two are friends, again," Ron observes.
Abruptly, the lights go away, and Blaise twists his wand and grins.
Goldstein laughs, and Theo decides he really likes it.
But the party is still in good condition, and, grudgingly, Blaise allowed some seventh and sixth years in.
Theo debates, silently, as to which dorm mate to carry up first, but with his eyes landing on Harry — who is decorated with adoring people, and a couple looking, lustfully — he decides. Harry will not be molested tonight under Theo's watch.
Potter shifts. "What's going on for Christmas?"
"No, I didn't," Harry says, defensively.
of girls who are gushing over you. You should hear some of the sixth years from yesterday — they are ready to kiss your feet. Not joking, mate, swear it on my magic," Theo says to a dubious-looking Longbottom. "Hey, look; if you were swinging our way, I might even have asked you out myself."
i changed anthony's description quite a bit from how jkr imagined him, but... creative license :) by the way, i personally adore the way that upthehillart draws the harry potter characters, so if you're interested in how i imagine everyone, you can go over to her tumblr <3 hope you enjoyed this chapter; kudos, comments, and bookmarks are always appreciated!
They sit at the once full table and avoid each other's eyes.
That causes Longbottom to blush. "Apparently so would Zabini."
Malfoy bites back a smile.
Potter sighs. "Look, Nott. I'm sorry for trying to make you go against Malfoy in some power strike. He just angers me beyond belief, sometimes, and I lost control. We seem to make everything into a competition, even if it might lose the opportunity to gain a friend."
See, why can't
"Blaise," he calls, "I'm gonna head up."
. How very Slytherin of him. I approve."
They all look over to see Theo shoving spoonfuls of food in Blaise's mouth, who was furiously scribbling away on a piece of parchment.
Then Theo's expression turns grave, and he's shaking his head disappointedly at Harry.
It was halfway to the truth and Blaise notices it, smiling along with an approving pat on the back.
be a great party for Christmas if Blaise is planning it.
When Harry leaves, Theo catches Ivan Crawley watching him from his dorm. Crawley cocks an eyebrow. "What're you doing, Nott?"
It had first shown when they made the agreement. It was like Malfoy didn't even know it was there. He just smiled automatically, and Harry loved that it was so
so, basically, harry and draco are now going to be fighting for theo's friendship and overall favor! also, i think i'll be able to post a chapter every day until the story is completed. hope you enjoyed this chapter; the next one's more of harry and draco torturing theo ;)
"Well, I have to go, now." He stands, clumsily. He's always been clumsy, and stress, nervousness, and surprise often increase it.
"Why doesn't Ron take you?" Hermione asks, a sort of sly look on her face.
Theo taps his foot impatiently as he waits at the bottom of the girl's dormitories stairs.
"That's good you're getting along with him."
The two girls look to each other, then burst out in laughter. Hermione chokes out, "Theo, we've known since the beginning of the year. Even Ron knows."
Drunk crying is just plain annoying.
Theo's stomach lurches, and he wonders if they were talking about him. "Blaise's," he answers, shortly, but the other two don't miss the unease in his tone.
Ron glances at it. "Forgot I even had it."
"No worries," he grinned, casting a Drying Charm on the soaking wet boy.
Harry gnaws his lip, before grabbing the bottle and sniffing. He immediately goes happy and stares at Draco for a second before writing down what he smelt. Draco, brows furrowed at Harry, quickly does the same, and the results are almost the exact.
She shrugs, slowly sitting up. "I don't. He's always...
Potter realizes what it sounded like. "Oh, no, no, no! Not like
"As I'm sure you'd love that, I can't force them to. Well, actually I can, but that would either involve an Unforgivable, or some serious seducing." Blaise's smooth voice was muffled while he played with Ron's pillows.
Right when Blaise gave the last vial, he and Draco were coming down from the stairs, and Ron and Harry were getting ready to leave.
Weasley's eyes widen a little. Theo often chooses to stay remarkably silent during lessons and dinner, so his joking may be surprising. He just prefers to observe, rather than indulge in the...

"He's doing fine," Theo clears his throat, and busies himself with his toiletries and bedtime routine supplies. "Told me to tell you that he won't be visiting tonight because he's doing something with Granger."
crying.
Theo shrugs, avoiding eye contact, sheepishly. "You said some... interesting things last night, but nothing too embarrassing. Just some love... confessions."
you," Hermione gives a slightly creepy smile, and Theo shudders, involuntarily.
Draco's gaze falls on the freckled boy, and he shifts, "Nothing much. Just uh... Where are the drinks, Blaise?"
"How's it going with Theo and the dorm?" he asks, buttering his toast, messily, to get the thing in his mouth faster.
, too. "Thanks for that, but this one won't. Honest!"
Theo's eyes widen, and he quickly pushes Harry back. "Whoa, slow down, there, Mister Centaur. It'll look... suspicious if you come back so quick."

Harry stops. "Wait...
He looks down, humiliated. Of course, Anthony isn't gay. How could he? He probably likes tits and vaginas, and he probably has girls lined outside of his dorm door, just
Then it clicks.
be?" Parkinson can't stop laughing. "Who've you been hanging out with these past few weeks?"
Theo shakes his head, before heading to his own dorm.
A lightbulb pops in his head. Goldstein? Didn't he use to wear those Muggle braces on his teeth?
"Harry?!" Ron exclaims, leaning over him.
relationship.
With his perfectly styled hair, and expensive, in style clothing?! Don't make me laugh anymore, Theodore, I'm dying."
Harry looks at him, strangely. "I've no idea why I'm telling you all of this."
"Oh, you know," Theo says, dismissively. He stands slowly, and a terrible smirk overcomes his face. "Oh, you're
Theo glances at Anthony Goldstein, who raises his eyes in curiosity like everyone else in the library, then to Madam Pince. He winces at the look on her face.
McGonagall took on an apologetic look. "Believe my sympathy, Mister Nott, but we're keeping this arrangement."
Potter shrugs. "Worth a shot. Think I'm getting closer."
"Oh, but Ron is right. Blunt but factual. Like our last attempt, but more...
Hermione shifts, as well, uncomfortable. "But they're so... And you're so..."
Theo whimpered, a tad louder.
Draco doesn't answer, only crying and sniffling.
, reads the white, spidery words that spread above Blaise's wand and in front of Ginny's freckled face.
first date."
"You've fancied Weasley since our fifth year, Blaise," Theo points out, grumpily.
Pansy nods, but looks to Theo. "Did they- er, did they kiss?"
"What is it?" Harry asks, concerned.
Theo spins, and comes face to face with a messy-haired Hermione Granger.
"Then go!" Theo pushes the boy forward. Harry stumbles but continues to move forward to Draco's pale blonde hair.
Harry finds his two best friends where they usually are on a Saturday morning — arguing about random things in a random corridor. He used to think that it was some sort of foreplay, but now he knows it's just a type of therapy. It reminds them that the war is over and that they can go back to the things were before: constant bickering.
"You know, I couldn't help but notice that, also," Theo agrees.
"You know how to say 'open', Ron," Harry says, grinning. "Did it last year, remember?"
Greengrass winces from beside her, and Theo grows quiet. "Tracey..." Millicent Bulstrode whispers, warningly.
Hermione rolls her eyes and bites back a smile. "Fine. Let's talk about the party."
Theo covers his eyes, and yells, exasperated, "
the end!
Ron moans, pitifully, to himself. "It's just... Well, everyone knows Harry's pretty oblivious, and nothing bad on his part, you know that he just gets clueless sometimes. He's pretty observant, otherwise, I mean he
Before Theo can put any more thought on it, Anthony adds, "And yes, I used to wear Muggle braces."
Theo rolls his eyes before passing the potion. Draco, immediately recognizing the pale blue liquid, swallows it in one gulp.
Potter looks away.
Ron turns sober. "You didn't — ?"
That's why when he was first assigned in a dorm with Harry bloody Potter and his old, attractive dormmate, he was very defensive. Even with the modern open-mindedness, straight people still got weird around anyone who wasn't strictly heterosexual.
Potter stares then looks away. "Right. Uh, I have to talk to you about something, Malfoy."
"He's down in the dumps," Theo urges.
He mouths to Harry.
"I don't understand how you can room with them, honestly, Theo!" Ron chokes out to the boy.
Blaise blinks. "Date?"
Seamus Finnegan clears his throat. "Well, Davis, with all due respect, I have to disagree. Crawley and I are getting along just fine."
"I love it," Blaise winks to Potter.
Blaise rolls his eyes, albeit darkened cheeks. "Not like you give anything to the gossip circle. Anyways, I bet you and Hermione do this a thousand times worse, and Theo and I are
Then, the door started to open and Blaise was on his own bed, hands in Theo's hair faster than lightning. Theo recalled how Blaise had started the braid in his hair when he first entered, and now it truly seemed like that was all he's been doing, and Theo only has a moment to appreciate how brilliant Blaise is before Ron talks.
would be!"
Theo pouts. "Why didn't you tell me?"
Granger's fingers visibly tighten in the red hair. "I'm here," she barely says.
Theo thinks back. That
The spins keep on going, and as the circle drank more, the dares became odder. Soon the students who chose to sit out were surrounding the rim of the circle, looking regretfully, to their earlier, sober minds. Among the circle, Harry had already snogged two people, had gotten body shots off him thrice, and had his toes licked by a very flushed sixth year. He kept on drinking to forget each experience. Finally, it landed to Theo, who wasn't nearly as drunk as the other participants and has only had one shot of Ogden's.
He is just about the sexiest boy Theo has ever seen in his life.
"I'm Anthony Goldstein," the boy replies. "And I can't say we have."
Since their new obsession with befriending Theodore Nott began, he accompanied his old rival, Draco Malfoy. They made an agreement, and they stuck to it. They shared thoughts, gave answers, and even wandered their new discovery of Theo's sexuality together (which they, of course, got a healthy hint about from Zabini).
Blaise tuts. "Sorry, mate, but I got a meeting with someone."
Harry freezes and Draco looks torn.
Goldstein visibly cowers. "As..." He clears his throat. "As friends?"
He glares, swatting her away. "Oh my fuck, woman.
Then their expressions change, and Theo glares.
Potter and Draco catch eyes, eyebrows arched. Goldstein?
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm staying, as well," Potter's voice sounds, and Draco bites down a grin. The other two-thirds of the Golden Trio chuckle. Potter smiles.
"We're gonna go to the dorm, don't bother coming back for a while," Harry says to Theo, winking, and basically snogs Draco out of the room.
It moves instantly. It turns and turns in a dizzy manner, and everyone gives a gasp as it slows down to a stop in front of Daphne Greengrass.
It gets quiet again. Greg snorts at something, but he looks zoned, and Draco doubts that he was even listening to them.
"You're not going to stop, are you?" he sighs.
And Harry realizes he
by some snotty Ravenclaw this morning," Draco had said, conversationally, to him, one day over their cauldrons. Blaise was busy pestering Weasley, so Theo figured it was fine to talk to Draco.
" Pansy reads, then smirks sweetly. "Oh, darling, this will be quite nice."
"What?" Hermione gasps.
Blaise laughs. "Fine! Any volunteers?"
Draco nearly falls out of his seat.
And it's sexy, adorable, and frustrating, all at once!"
to see this."
Ron chokes on air.
"What?"
"What do you know, Weasley?" Blaise arches a brow.
Hermione arches an eyebrow. "Hello, Theodore. What's got you all chirpy?"
"Hey - " Harry was cut off by Draco's lips on his.
"You absolute dickwad!"
Harry was debating on what 'romantic' meant to him, and what it might mean to Malfoy — to Theodore it pretty much means one rose on his bed — so when he opened the door to be met with Pansy Parkinson he was more than surprised.
Draco's head shoots up.
And now, they're here. And Theo hasn't missed a second of their arguing.
"Draco," Blaise says, sing-songingly. "Who is it?"
"The same day I found out you were gay, I figured out that I'm bi," Potter says, softly.
He goes to Hermione Granger.
Theo shifts. "Is uh, is Anthony Goldstein staying?"
like the knowing glance between them.
Potter clenches his sharp jaw, but then nods, throwing a good night to Theo before motioning Weasley to something on his bed.
Malfoy snorts. "He was
"Goodnight, Blaise," Theo waves, but is stopped by Weasley asking him something.
"I'm just saying that I'm bi, and I don't care that you're... gay," Potter explains, face flushed to a pleasant red that Draco kinda likes.
"Hi," the boy responds.
"Do you
"That's where everything gets a little crazy. Once you spin the wand, words will say what you have to do to who the wand lands on. So, for a barbaric example, I spin the wand and it lands on Greg. Words will appear with what someone wants to do to someone else in the circle. Whether bad or good, I'll have to do it."
Harry stares at him, unbelievably. "Read the box?"
"Nothing, it's just," Potter stammers, "Ron thought you were interested in him." He seems to measure his words carefully.
"Gina?" Blaise offers, cheerfully. "Gina Sallis, the Ravenclaw?"
"Who are you fancying?" he asks, without actually holding eye contact.
"What is — " Blaise starts, but Ron presses a finger to his own lips and points to the two paralyzed boys with a shake of his head.
"Need help?" The smooth, yet posh voice slithers through his ear.
He shouldn't. If anything, he should just be surprised. But now he's just confused and happy and kinda frisky — which should remain a secret, mind you.
Another thing is for specifically Draco Malfoy — family is first. And Draco needs his essays perfect if he wants to help his family — his
Draco turns to Theo, instantly. "What's the potion?"
" Harry stammers, and that just eggs Parkinson on more.
The blonde clears his throat, and she snaps her head up. He gives her a look, clearly saying: "
Blaise walks over to Theo's bed, laying on it, but continues to watch the other two.
not know that Draco Malfoy was homosexual?"
When he reaches Harry, he isn't expected to be pulled in by drunk hands, and get snogged so roughly he wonders if it's already the next day when they're finished.
Theo nods, telling the truth. "I believe so."
Sooner than later, people slowly start stumbling to their dorms, or out of the common room, or falling asleep in weird positions. Each one kisses or hugs Blaise (and sometimes Theo) before they leave, and Blaise responds, enthusiastically, back. Theo sees both of his dorm mates dead drunk, and sighs.
Theo smiles, warmly. "Not as of lately. Actually really awkward."
Potter flushes that adorable red, and Draco huffs, glaring at the ground.
Theo sighs as Professor Slughorn enters the classroom.
Groaning, Theo shuts the boy's curtains and casts a Silencing Charm.
Theo groans as he leans back next Blaise on the boy's bed. He escaped here after a quick scope out of his room to see both boys gone to the showers. He quickly headed here, passing a flustered Weasley.
, he hated them when they were so damn oblivious.
"We'll throw a better one for Christmas. Student-run," Blaise had promised most of the eighth years, who grinned because it was Blaise Zabini talking, and he was one of the best Slytherins in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There would
Blaise winks at Ron.
Theo grins, goofily, and gives a small wave to the boy. Anthony, still red, gives a wide smile and the mouthing of 'hello', back.
"What?" he chokes.
"I can't speak - " Ron starts.
"Noticed what?" He furrows his eyebrows.
," Potter shoots, dryly, and Nott mentally groans.
"Just do it," Theo cocks a smile. "You won't be disappointed."
Hermione hurriedly stands, as well. "Of course! Tell me if you need the notes from today, I know you were..." Only Draco notices how her eyes flickered to Potter. "Somewhat distracted."

Theo ignores him. "Oh, I've got to go!"
"Honestly, mate, Draco is
If his plan worked successfully, he'd prove that they were in love with each other. Again, his approaches are rather blunt, and most likely will make things a bit awkward for a while, but it'll show them their feelings.
He sniffs. "S'important to know how to.
Draco hid his attractive smirk. "Yes, until the Ravenclaw mysteriously sprouted a beak," he drawled.
Groaning, Theo drags his body to his dorm. He opens the door and promptly ignores the two enemies waiting for him.
"When did you get so boring?" Theo drawls.
Theo blinks. "You know Ron is..."
my dear friend, Blaise."

ah, i finally don't update at midnight! and so theo's plan completely failed but he gets an A for effort; also, the last chapter before the epilogue will be posted soon, so keep an eye out! :)
Theo looks flustered — showing himself from a few months ago — but Blaise scoffs at Hermione. "Oh, come off it, Granger. He used to seem all intelligent and nice, but he's always been this perverted, sneaky little fuck. Besides, what can you expect from someone who rooms with Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter?"
Harry moans and controls his breathing before falling to the ground, dramatically.
He spoke grandly of Draco and his mother. Neither Draco nor Narcissa believed that Lucius would get away with anything. He was, of course, one of the Dark Lord's trustees.
Theo and Blaise share dumbfounded glances, but let it go all the same.
Theo nods in agreement. "I'm going to keep an eye out for those two. Poor Blaise and Ron, though. They're clueless."
Theo walks down the corridor, and Ron follows. "At the speed they were going, they should have read it any minute now. Just wait for the shrieks."
"It's just — I think Draco's upset," he confesses, hiding a grin.
"Okay!" Blaise chirps, loving the reactions to his game. "Greengrass, go on, give it a spin."
"Oh, possibly hell?" He offers. "No? Well, I don't know. Thought you'd know of his whereabouts," he adds, as an afterthought.
"Sorry, Potter, just tell Draco I dropped by!" She barely spits out between her laughter, and she stumbles out of the dorm.
And so, Theo took Blaise to his dorm, grudgingly.
me making theo sneakier and sneakier, i love my basically-an-oc-by-now baby :)
"Well, who, then?" Potter presses, suddenly sitting-up-right-intrigued. "Parkinson?"
The boy has light brown skin, and his hair glistens in it's wavy, black strands. He has bright hazel eyes, and he carries a great number of books. He wears a long, dark blue robe over seemingly Muggle clothes, and he appears to be in Theo's age, with his eighth-year patch right below his Ravenclaw one.
Theo chuckles to himself and plucks off the picture of Sallis. If Harry saw her first then he'd fall in love. If he saw someone
"That still doesn't explain why you encouraged her to get one for him," Draco points out, still looking annoyed.
"Okay?" The other two say in unison.
He chuckles one last time, nervously, and gives a sheepish grin.
"I'll pass," Theo says, quickly, and the circle laughs in anticipating excitement.
"So..." Theo trails.
Draco hears Blaise stifle a laugh.
Strange, honestly, because after they leave, the East Tower will once again be empty, and eighth years will no longer exist.
He catches up to her. "Professor!"
looking more at me."
The boy is instantly awake, and slurs, "Draco? You've such nice eyes."
Theo looks at Draco's.
What Harry
likes Blaise and Theodore more than Parkinson.
Until everyone besides Harry starts bending over with laughter.
He watches as they both start flushing crimson, and he sees Draco edging his wand out to no doubt erase any evidence on what he smelled, so Theo swiftly switches their parchments and hides a smirk.
Theo cringes, but flushes all the same, ignoring Blaise's rants about the two handsome boys.
Neville smiles, and walking backward, adds: "And get Harry and Malfoy together, would you?"
Theodore, being his intellectual self, was the first to catch on. "No," he said automatically but amended at his headmistress' expression. "I mean, professor, they'll kill each other. The idea is insane, so if you plan on carrying it out, please put me in a different dorm."

He wasn't disappointed, but he was slightly surprised to see Ron picking up a Harry Potter.
"Nott," the latter greets.

In his hand are a box of cherry chocolates, a note to Harry from Gina Sallis, and a small picture of the aforementioned girl.

Parkinson regards him. "Oh yes, Boot — the Ravenclaw. Draco and he must be in the library together."
Draco whips out his Ancient Runes notes, seeing perfectly fine — if not a little illegible — notes on what happened in class today. He glares at Hermione.

Blaise rolls his eyes. "Don't push your luck, Nott. Oh, and by the way, Potter's coming over here."
Surely enough, slowly people start trickling in from the dorms of the eighth year tower. The common room greets more than one seventh or sixth year, and Theo watches in fascination as the crowd thickens. Music plays, snacks are spread, and Theo sees Blaise pass a few Galleons to a group of seventh year girls as they carry in a large crate.
Theo grins as the class swarms Draco and Harry, who thank them for the congratulations. They navigate their way to Theo.
Hermione snorts. "They don't think like that, Theo. With those two, when it's a competition, there's a winner, and there's a loser. No in-between."
"Honestly, Harry." Granger looks disappointed.
Draco's eyes widen, then he goes to speak.
Theo disappears to brush his teeth, but when he comes back they've continued arguing.
Theo whistles as he walks down, and runs into a flushed Ron. Ron looks surprised to see him alive.
"Fine. Only because I'm hungry." Draco dips his teeth into the chocolate, and his eyes catch flames. Harry catches eye contact with him.
"Go!" Theo urges, giving him a small shove.
But Malfoy looks back to Potter, and when he grins, maliciously, Theo can almos
Ron looks pained, now, as they start walking to the eighth year tower. "Theo..."
Okay, even after everything, Theo wasn't expecting this.
"How do you know, Malfoy." Harry grits his teeth, though more annoyed with himself than anyone else.
" he reads, blatantly, and glares at Draco, who is very pointedly looking at the floating words. "So, I get
Greg looks at Theo. "A house-elf promised me a cake. Bye."
Blaise licks his lips, and the freckle-covered chest turns red, and the two Slytherins watch in amazement as it travels up Weasley's spine, past his neck, and blends the freckles together.
"Oh, he'll hate me. Right when we started getting along like true friends. He'll think I'm a freak, and he'll tell the entire school that I fancy him — "
"It had a glamour on it, you know that," Harry says.
Potter looks at his best friend in astonishment. "What?"
"If you really want to know," he pauses, "just read the box. Thoroughly."
Though weird, Theo has gotten to know the two boys better, individually. He and Draco both enjoy Potions, and they sit together with Blaise, consistently, now. He tutors Harry with the same class, and he even got to know more than planned about the Golden Boy.
And just lets the fact that Draco Malfoy is a homosexual roll over him.
the anger boiling inside of Potter.
Then it clicks to Theo.
"Yes," Draco whispers, and leans in for a kiss.
"That literally sounds like paradise, Theodore," he moans during dinner once. "I'm coming over after dinner. I
"Brilliant idea, Theodore," Mason Jones smiles.
, Ron."
Theo slides out his shirt, receiving several wolf whistles and a few heavy gazes. He stares pointedly at the wand as he gives it a good twist.
He looks to them, confused. "Did I say something?"
— alright, okay, off track, sorry. Anyways — now, look, I like the bloke now that he's... nice and stuff, but let's face it. Draco Malfoy is a coward. So..." He looks very uncomfortable. "Oh,
He settles in his usual, hidden table that sits next to a window, but is less visible from the other tables. He got here extra early, and Madam Pince appears to still be in the Great Hall. He silently pats him on the back before opening up his homework for Arithmancy.
these last three chapters are (funny) wild so buckle in!
Abruptly, the door opens, with a flustered — as per usual — Theodore Nott, and a smirking Malfoy.
Blaise grins. "Why does Theo always get this treat? Honestly not fair at all. Weasley hasn't taken his shirt off since the first day. Hello, Draco, Potter."
Potter looks to Theo and opens his mouth to say something, but Weasley cuts him off. "Come on, Harry. Let the bloke get some sleep."
Blaise tuts. "As much as I know you'd love that, you know you can't pressure them into this."
No fair.
Theo stares blankly, before approaching him, only to be stopped by a sight.
Theo frowns. "No, not yet. I'll have to go wake him." He takes a vial before waving a wand at Blaise and pushing the crate of potions in the dark-skinned boy's hands.
"Well?" He seems to be a mixture of embarrassed and amused as he looks around the room. He sends Theo an unreadable look. "Applaud us."
"Nope."
They exit the dorm and descend to the empty common room. Theo looks at Blaise in confusion.
Anyways, it doesn't work like a love potion where the first glance at a person or an enchantment makes the subject fall. Two love — er,
"Because they're both single, young men," Parkinson comments, sifting through Malfoy's things, and Harry ignores the knowing and mischievous expression on her face.
Draco looks at him, suspiciously. "If this is an escape plan, Nott, remember that we know where you sleep."
"They were going to figure out sooner or later!" Ron flushes. "It's actually good that you explained it to them how you did."
He wonders if he and Harry Potter will ever be together, without Theo to lead them.
I do," Blaise rolls his eyes. He sits on Theo's other side, next to Harry and Draco. "Can I come, too?" He asks the couple.
here, we just came 'cause there's nowhere else to go."
They all burst out in loud laughter, causing all eyes to look at them, and a harsh warning from Madam Pince.
He wasn't.
Head whisking to the Gryffindor table, his eyes widen when he sees that Potter is indeed walking this way with a determined look on his face. Theo groans, pitifully, and Blaise snorts before engaging in a conversation with Millicent Bulstrode about the effects of wearing dragonhide heels in rocky locations.
or something, and Draco has been snappier and really rude to Harry, and I've no idea why."
She stares at him.
He keeps his back to them and blindly shuffles through his chest for his books and some parchment to start on his stupid Runes essay.
Hermione clears her throat, and says to Pansy, "Pansy, you're writing is a little unclear on this part, could you maybe..."
"Oh, shut it, Parkinson," Draco hisses at her, grasping his forehead, and covering his red face.
Pansy Parkinson and Gregory Goyle swoop in, sitting next to Draco. "Love, everyone knows of Harry and your new friendship. It was quite the talk when you two stopped talking."
Harry slides over to his side of the room, watching her. Malfoy has...
"I thought it'd be better for him to find out himself," Hermione explained one time. "And, of course, he'd give Ron a heart attack with his seductive approaches."
Draco arches an eyebrow, then nods and turns away, but not before his eyes fall, longingly, on something next to Theo.
Harry quickly looks to the host. Then clears his throat. "They're not in her dorm, anymore."
"Oh, bother!" Ron hisses, grabbing the potion and walking over to Harry. "Open wide." Harry complies, confusedly, and has the antidote quickly poured down his throat. Pansy bursts out laughing at his expression when he realizes what happened.
"No, Harry," Hermione Granger's exasperated voice rings.
"Merlin, you didn't know?" Harry shakes his head. "Well, sorry... Uh, I just remembered Theo said he wanted to meet me, so... bye."
Theo flushes, but grins. "Good on you, mate."
He sees Potter and Malfoy taking the way to the dorm, and McGonagall taking a different route.
"Yeah, he's not," Blaise snorts. "No one can be. That is unless you want to listen to hours and hours about how Harry Potter is the most interesting, handsome, and kind man in the world. Sallis is in love with him, honestly."
("Plus it's kind of hidden," Harry pipes, but they ignore him.)
He's been getting on with Hermione and Ron spectacularly. Hermione enjoys having intellectual conversations with him, and Ron is just so friendly, so they get along fine.
"Oh, of course not," Theo assures. "If you're lucky, someone just wants to ask the person the wand lands on a question."
Blaise informs Theo, helpfully, as he continues to stare across the hall at Ronald Weasley, who stares back, just as unnervingly.
Theo shrugs. "Sure, but now they're both so awkward. Did anything good come out of the blasted party?"
Everyone raises a cup to that, and Theo smiles, secretly, to himself, while wondering
Malfoy hisses a harsh — yet softer then they used to be — insult in Weasley's direction before walking out and slamming the door behind him.
Then Draco clears his throat. "Okay. I er, I'll see you in the dorm."
staring at each other's bodies earlier.
Ignoring their heated stares, he looks to Blaise. "Can I stay at yours, tonight?"
wizards — oh!" He spots Draco and Harry standing in the middle of the classroom, and then clears his throat, eyes twinkling. "Well, sit down, Harry, Mister Malfoy!"
"What?!" Harry snaps. It takes a while for him to get an answer.
McGonagall sent a concerned glance to Theo, before looking to all of them. "I warned you beforehand, considering that Miss Granger shouldn't trouble herself with your reactions if she announced this in the eighth year common room. Please keep this information to yourselves, and do not cause too much of a scene in the East Tower. You are dismissed."
" Blaise reads, after spinning his wand, eyebrows furrowed. "Okay, which kinky fuck thought this one?"
Draco is swiftly cured as well, and Pansy is soon rolling on the ground, laughing.
"What?" Blaise raises an eyebrow.
Blaise glances over the rim of his goblet to Theo. "So much for the

Theo shrugs, but Potter seems interested in the topic. "You're dating someone?"

It was true. Headmistress McGonagall had put together a special meeting for the new dorm mates.
pairs of eyes trained on him, and he felt inexplicably uncomfortable.
"You totally did! Like, in third – no... Oh, no way!" Blaise exclaims, jumping up. "You've liked both Potter

Theo gulps. "Not Mason Jones, that's for sure." He rushes to his dorm.
"Finally they'll stop eyeing each other awkwardly in Charms," Hannah Abbott winks at Theo.
"Don't worry. It's Thursday. You can redeem yourself, still," Pansy winks. "Everyone will be elated. Harry most certainly."
"Draco," Theo cuts in but is ignored.

call him Draco?
But, no. All of his classes today included Potter.
? Right, Pansy there... Perfect. Blaise next to — always flawless, love. And Turpin if you could — nice! Exactly what I was thinking! And...
"The incredible increase in inter-house relationships," Hermione finishes for Pansy, who grins at her.
Theo's two dorm mates freeze in the doorway at the scene in the classroom.
Theo lasts the better of five seconds before dropping his fork (along with his Shepard's Pie) and looks at Draco, flustered.
Theo blinks.
Even though he knew it wasn't true, even though Blaise knew it wasn't true, even though everyone knew it wasn't fucking true, he repeats this in his head;
The two boys stumble, then sit on their beds with a sort of curious glance around. Hermione squeaks. "That's not good! That may confuse their
"Not a chance."
Theo winces. "She asked what happened..."
he can feel himself floating away. Surely that'd be enough to move him?
Pansy immediately looks at Theo. "Who do you think is in worse conditioning: Harry/Draco, Ron/Blaise, or Neville/Hannah?"
Theo smiles, sheepishly, then promptly bites his toast. "Sorry. Just zoned out."
"Maybe just act normal. It'll take the awkward edge off, and then he'll probably just fall in line."
"Don't say I didn't warn you," Theo scolds, and Blaise rolls his eyes. Theo opens the door.
"Theo, you first?" Blaise asks as he settles next to Theo.
"In sixth year," Harry recalled, when Theo curiously asked why he didn't have the skills he used to, "I had acquired an old textbook. It had a bunch of side notes that informed me how to properly brew the potions, over the textbook's incorrect ways. It even had small scrawls about other things... like spells and enchantments. It said it belonged to the Half-Blood Prince. I later found out that was..."
Draco elbows Potter in the ribs, and the Gryffindor sobers up.
it reads.
Greengrass does, and it lands on Ron. Blaise gives a low whine in Theo's ear, and Theo snorts.
Malfoy gnaws his lip. "Just be ready, eh? Later, Potter." Then he left.
"So, what?" she asks, absently.
Parkinson nods, smirking. "Uh-huh. How are you doing, Potter?"
"Of course," Blaise scoffs. Then he reevaluates the circle. "Okay, perfect. Theo, would you explain how to play?"
Harry glared, half-heartedly, before falling to his pillows in a heap, groaning. "What time is it?"
Blaise snorts.
Parkinson arches an eyebrow at the aforementioned hand. She lays across Malfoy's bed, arms crossed behind her head, as well as her crossed legs stretched out in front of her, and an absolutely carefree expression decorating her attractive face.
It's only a few moments later when Hermione comes back with the antidotes. She slides over to the two, paralyzed boys, and motions the others over.
"Save it for my brother!" She calls over her shoulder before disappearing from the room.
"I haven't any idea as to what they were doing. They kept the curtains open, so at first, I thought they were into exhibitionism, but then they cast a Silencing charm, and just started talking! With literally no sexual intent! It was insane!" Blaise rambles on, grumbling about how Granger is probably boring in bed, or how Weasley is just in the closet, waiting for Prince Charming to save him.
What did Potter mean when he said, '
"Of course," Hermione says. "It's a very important part of Hogwarts', Voldemort's, and the Wizarding World's history."
Ron shrugs. "They don't act like a couple at all. Blaise braids Theo's hair, sure, but he also tells him his sexual ventures in full detail," Ron shivers, but Harry could've thought he saw a flicker of jealousy. "Honestly, they act like Harry and me."
"So, what're you doing 'sides braiding each other's hair?" Ron inquires, plopping himself down on his bed that's pillows appear in the same condition the ginger left them in.
"Of course," Theo smiles, brilliantly. "Why would I ever try anything like that? I'm bunked with the Savior of the Wizarding World and Draco fucking Malfoy. Oh, one more thing, who snitched on me?"
Theo cringes as Ginny sidles over to Greengrass and slides her tongue along the length of her pale neck. Cheers and hoots sound around the crowd. "Get some, Ginny!" is heard from Harry's and Ron's area, and Ginny glares, trying to find out which one said it.
"Well?" he snaps. "Go on with your pitiful lives."
"Must be for Potions," Hermione frowns. "Honestly, Ron, you should encourage him to get these things done sooner. Parkinson and Greengrass
Greg shrugs then looks to Draco. "Why are you so quiet?"
Ginny Weasley's hand shoots up.
"Ah, damn me to the deepest of hell. How did I mess up so crucially? I'm an idiot, almost as much as the moron I fancy. Oh, no, this is terrible. Will Theo tell him — "
Theo pushes past the two shirtless boys, then past the two gaping interrupters, and flees the scene.
Then he lays back down, flushed. "The other requirement?"
Neville smiles once more before ascending up the stairs.
"No nonsense, my boy!" Slughorn exclaims, looking more excited per second. "You and young Draco can sit next to Mister Nott, there! Don't be shy!"
Harry gawks. "Really? You really think so?"
"We were waiting for you to tell us," Hermione says, cautiously.
Theo almost bangs his head against the wall at his stupidity.
"Well," Ron starts, but then shakes his head.
"Now, no questions! After smelling the potion, write down what you smelt on a piece of parchment and exchange it with your table partners. The vials will be out in a second, and I have a
"Well, this is bloody delicious," Harry moans. "Where did they get this?"
Liliana Moon, a few seats away, tilts her head. "What do you mean?"
"And here comes Choice Number Two, Draco Malfoy. Aren't you elated, Theodore?" Blaise lightly teases, but the reassuring hand on Theo's arm is comforting.
The one in Harry's hand, is in a barely legible scrawl, but it's clear:
Hermione studies Theo. Then looks to Blaise, then finally Ron. "Think it has to do with Code Silver?"
