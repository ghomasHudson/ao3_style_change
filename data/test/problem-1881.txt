“What have you done to that poor tart?” a deflated, blackish sponge cake rested on top of the table where a weird looking cream whipped itself.
“You should be nicer. I just saw you soul, Draco. It’s so pretty I can’t believe it belongs to you” Harry was still recovering and his nerves were on edge, it had been a difficult spell “The other one was there too, and I can tell you it is not supposed to be, the spell rejected it immediately” or vice versa, he wasn’t sure.
Harry thought about the risks and Alexei and Draco. The memories of his boyfriend’s wounded body, his eyes red from all the crying and his agony screams back at the church were enough to bring back his Gryffindor recklessness and make him accept the deal with little hesitation.
For now, Harry had to go a step ahead and find a way to communicate with Alexei, if that was even his name, so displaying all of his books and notes on the desk of his current room he started planning. He had Hermione’s ideas on a piece of parchment and was trusting he could make some progress; god knew Draco needed hope and he was determined to give it to him.
Someway, somehow they end up kissing like mads, Harry on top of Draco, holding his weight on his stretched arms, barely touching the blond who kept trying to get more contact.
He made his way to the computers on the corner of the library and started looking for more updated information on the Romanovs. He wanted to take notes but he couldn’t just summon a parchment while being surrounded by muggles so he stood up and went to the little stationer’s store on the second floor of the building. He bought a notebook and a regular pen and made his way back to the electronic station. He saw Draco between some shelves, completely absorbed in the reading, so he decided not to interrupt him.
“Promised. By who?” Harry could make himself an idea, but it was a nauseous thought. How could anyone do something like that to a little boy?
“You are not allergic to cats; I know that” he did. He had seen his medical records and Draco was not allergic to anything, but maybe he just didn’t like cats “Do you want to go to a different place?” he liked to annoy the man, but he was not that cruel.
“What on Salazar’s name is this sorcery?” Draco had asked with horror in his voice. He knew, of course he knew, that it was some kind of muggle jumble, but it still made no sense for him. What could possibly be the point in a button-full silver box with words in it? What was paper for? Muggles could be so lazy…
“I’m sorry, I got too excited” at least he had de decency to blush and apologize “I’ve got your medicine” he added, holding a funny-looking vial, shaped as a tear with a thin tip on one end, and a greenish-blue liquid inside.
They pressed the play button and the film started. It was something about fashion. He had figure that much. There was a messy girl dressed like an elf and a fancy lady that reminded him of his mother somehow. Narcissa wasn’t so nasty, but the vibe was the same.
“Thank you” he went back to the hall and tried the bedroom but he wasn’t there either; nor his, nor the next one.
“You can come, babe” his voice was rough and deep, probably from the abuse on his own throat, but Draco’s single thought was that that should be illegal. He felt the anticipation built at the same time Harry took his length inside again and added a third finger making his body shake as he released his come on Harry’s tongue.
“Yes, so to speak” he was a little bit less tense without Harry there, but he suspected the man was smoking somewhere and he didn’t like that he was the cause.
The place had been built not too long ago on top of the remnants of the old Ipatiev House, where the royal family had been murdered during the revolution. That definitely caught the wizards’ attention.
“This is ridiculous” Harry complained after three hours of pointless search “I don’t need to know Slytherin’s offspring, I need the bloody royal family”
“I saw your father today. The doctors say he has been behaving, but still has no memories of the recent events. He gave me a flower, the same kind he used to bring me when we first met” Draco knew how much she loved her husband, even after all they had gone through, so, he couldn’t help the knot forming in his stomach at the situation. They had made many mistakes, but his mother didn’t deserve that; she had probably been the bravest of the Malfoys. “Are you alright, Draco? You look pale” seconds later he was empting his gut in the lawn, holding tightly to the chair, everything turning around him, right before it all went black.
When they landed where Ms. Kozlova dropped them, Harry thought they had changed countries. The isolated and imposing castle didn’t fit in that place. Yekaterinburg, where he discovered they were later that day, was one of the most beautiful places he had seen, full of joyous people and beautiful colors. They had gone straight to the wizarding part of the city, which had the single access point to and from the school.
Narrow passage, door on the left, no light, just keep walking, keep moving. He saw a light, a gap on the stone, a strand of green wool, he managed to get to the other side, he felt his heart break.
“He went in on his own. I just told him it was fine” his magic was already radiating from him. He was about to lose his control “There, there, no need to get aggressive. We can’t hurt each other, you will only affect yourself and probably the veil and you do want to see him again, don’t you?” Harry froze. See him again?
“Well, I guess that makes sense” he answered dryly “He wouldn’t have had half the followers he had if they found out he was a half-blood”
They spent the rest of the meal in silence, well, except for Draco’s pleased sounds. One would have thought pure-blood etiquette had something to say about getting a culinary boner over a steak, but Harry was not complaining. This was something that, he could bet, Draco didn’t show everyone, so he was flattered, and horny, but mostly flattered.
“It does. I tried, but there was no luck” they stayed silent “Maybe you should knock me out; that way you could talk to him and get rid of me for a while, double win” Harry could tell he didn’t mean it, but he sent him a glare anyway “Don’t look at me like that, it was a joke, for Salazar’s sake”
“Miss Granger, a pleasure to see you again” Harry said nothing, but Hermione smiled and offered her hand to the blond, who took it softly.
“All right, Potter. Let’s see if you can really do something with that brain of yours” he wasn’t going to give in so easily “I’m confident my mother told you everything so far, and you have already seen my bruises, and touch them even, so, what do think?”
“How long have I been out?” the blond asked as he straightened himself in the bed. Harry was next to him, in the chair he usually occupied, making notes on his pad.
Alexander seemed to think about it for a minute, more out of distrust than oblivion, but he finally let a breath out and nodded “Follow me” he commanded and Harry did so.
They reentered the room through which they had come the first time and as soon as Alexander closed the door and whispered a few words they were inside the transportation chamber of the castle.
“He likes you” Harry’s breath got stuck somewhere between his lungs and his throat “He does. He gets nervous too frequently now that you are around and he was too excited when I appeared and you are telling me you were hugging, so that is the only explanation” the boy kept looking through the window even from the distance and Harry took the chance to change topics.
Draco had waited for him in the living room, obviously planning to kill him since he was wearing one of Harry’s shirts, unbuttoned. He had not missed Draco’s attempts to provoke him to go further from kisses. They were grown up men and they liked each other a lot, of course, but Harry was not risking hurting Draco. He was still sick and he was violating the patient-healer relationship enough already.
Once there, Alexander moved straight towards a particular stand and grabbed a thin, dusty notebook that he handed to Harry.
“Hi, honey. I see you have taken a nap” he said before kissing him and Draco hurried to fix his hair, messy from his slumber. His eyes fallowed Harry as he said hello to his parents. He focused on the ring on his left hand.
“Too much wine” Potter had answered. From then on it was all very foggy. He had the vaguest memory of being studying something about the Romanov family from another book that approached every royalty in history, but that had very little information on the Russians since none of them had had any magical qualities. Same problem over and over again.
He pocketed Harry’s wand and put on a pair of shoes. He looked out the window to see the sun setting behind the Urals. He needed some answers, there had to be something that gave sense to that and he was going to find it.
“Thanks” he took a sip. Perfect “I got us a little bit of everything, I hope you are hungry” Draco nodded and took a piece of bread and spread some butter on it. They stayed in silence for a while more until Harry noticed Draco looking at him from over the juice cup “What’s with you today? You have been acting so weird”
“We need to watch him for the next hours, but the bleeding has stopped. If this had happened when he wasn’t being treated it could have been so much worse. I will stay here, since there is no point in sending him to St. Mungo” she nodded and he grabbed a bandage from his case to secure the stitches. They had already cleaned the sheets and it was a less disturbing sight.
The night view of the city was something to look at. Their room was facing the direction of the Red Square, where lights were pointed to the St. Basil’s cathedral, making the colors vibrate. The city was active; people would come and go, wizards amongst muggles and everyone having a great time.
“How are you feeling, darling?” she asked, but Draco ignored her completely as his focus was on the dark-haired wizard.
He went to the kitchen himself instead of asking an elf. He knew better than to provoke the witch, no matter how good he treated the creatures. He found a couple oranges and squeezed them while brewing some coffee and adding some cream to it, no sugar.
“Harry…please” he begged, hoping his boyfriend would understand what he was asking for, but Harry seemed to be ignoring him. Only seconds after Draco felt how one finger joined Harry’s tongue on the task, burring inside Draco with little effort “Oh, Merlin” he moaned when it started to move.
They ate and chatted. Butter beer and wine were everywhere, Harry’s face was already red, he didn’t know if for the alcohol or the laughter. Teddy had stumble upon one of the hidden beans in the cake and was still cursing, earning himself a glare from his grandmother. The other bean had happened to be in Ron’s slice.
“It was not going to be so easy, Potter. It could be anywhere in these books. They don’t have very suggestive titles, so we have to go through them all” Draco said, leaving the volume in his hands on the pile of discarded and reaching for Harry’s book “Let me see that one. I don’t trust your reading skills” he was already going back to the page where Salazar Slytherin’s family tree started. It was a graphic book, therefore, it was huge.
“Well, I’m not you mother, but I think we can do something decent before everyone else arrives” he rolled up his sleeves and asked George to clean up while he reviewed the recipe and started working.
He went over every moment he had spent with Draco since their reencounter while picking the apples from the cellar along with every other ingredient he needed for the apple pie variation he had prepared for Draco two days ago and that he had loved. They had flown naturally into the relationship they had now, and that made Harry ask himself what could have happened if he had accepted Draco’s hand back in first year. Would they be friends? Would they have ended up a couple sooner? Would they have fought the war? There was no point on thinking about that, but he would have enjoyed this Draco back then, definitely.
“I’m desperate” Harry laughed anyway. Draco was looking at him, but he made an effort to stay focused on his task.
“Thank you, Draco” the blond nodded with a smile and a comfortable silence took over the scene until he spoke again.
He took one of the letter after closing the book he was reading and unfolded it. A broken vine wand, dragon heartstring core, an English witch who lived in Spain. He could not fix it and she knew it, but she requested a new one with the same qualities and, if possible, the same core. Those were tricky ones, but he enjoyed a good challenge. Marking the parchment with a green
“You wish” the answer had come out his mouth before he noticed. Making him bite his lower lip. Potter did not seem to know what to say, but he did blush a bit.
“Some juice would be lovely, thank you, Draco” her voice was sweet, even if her eyes never left Potter’s annotations.
They stayed like that for a couple minutes. Catching their breath. Harry fell on his side and hugged Draco.
“Master Draco, your mother is waiting for you in the garden, sir. She asked Bibly to come look for you” the blond fixed his eyes in the clock above the window, noticing it was half past five already. He loosened his hair from the bun where he kept it so it didn’t bother him while working before addressing the creature.
“You shouldn’t have gone through so much trouble just for me wanting to cut my hair, love” Draco said as he rubbed some more oil on his shoulder.
He needed to say something. But, was there anything that could compensate his past actions? Anything to make it right, after so long? He was not going to fix anything, he knew it, he had been an idiot, and nothing will change that, but he needed to do it, he had to.
“You didn’t know?!” Harry was alarmed. He dropped the old book to the floor. So much for extra-careful.
“I want you with me. I need you to do this, please” Harry’s look was dark and intense and Draco feared he would say no despite everything, but he kissed him once more and the blond felt his heart fill with hope.
“Draco, can you hear me?” the other man screamed in response, he was barely conscious “Narcissa, I need you to get some towels and water” he didn’t need them, but the witch would never leave his son side willingly and he had to concentrate. She seemed to understand and ran to get what he asked, even when she could have asked an elf, or summoned it with magic.
Harry finished the torture and gave him his medicine before going to his room to, presumably, get ready for his reunion with Granger. With the same messy hair, but less wrinkles in the shirt, he returned.
“I don’t think so” this would have been a perfect moment to have Ellias around “We just arrived from England, but maybe our friend had something booked for us” the man waved his wand and checked a stack of papers without even looking.
“Oh, I wouldn’t kill you, Teddy, but I should have burned that damn thing the moment I saw it” Andromeda shoot the older wizard a scowl and he blushed, stroking his hair.
“Granger? Why? I mean, I’m sure she knows almost everything that’s ever been written, but you sound awfully confident” the healer was doing spells and changing his bandages.
No one said a word, but his mother’s face made it clear it was very much true: Harry Potter was in his bedroom.
He looked towards the bedside table. Harry had left his wand there. Why? He had no idea; but Draco would probably kill him when he returned for being a stupid, irresponsible, little Gryffindor. Going around that place without protection was just foolish.
“I know it’s stupid, since it doesn’t solve a thing, but it was a way of burning away the anxiety. When everything finished I even considered that the war had been the easy part. To deal with the lost, the trauma, the stress, the attention, the consequences…it was too hard” Draco offered him a supportive look “I went to a muggle university and I was lucky I had the excuse of being away and studying overnight to cover the fact that I barely slept, otherwise Hermione and Ginny would have killed me”
He worked mostly with the magical population, but had a couple of days a week saved for muggle shifts; he didn’t want to become rusty. More often than not people reached him as a private healer or consultant, and when not working, he was researching or spending time with Teddy or his friends.
“I am afraid I do not know what you mean” Harry felt Death moving and Rasputin’s eyes went straight to it while he grabbed the cross hanging from his neck “Oh, you mean that” he smiled “To help him, of course” Harry was starting to like Death. He would choose it over that sadist any time.
It was written in English, for some mysterious reason and it brought back a lot of memories that Harry had chosen to burry deep. He aligned the key with the lock and turned it to the right two times and four to the left, like Alexander had instructed. He heard a clicking sound and the door opened when he pushed.
“You better. You could make a thesis on this subject and I want in” Ronald was next to his wife immediately while Potter kept pushing her in his workshop’s direction. Maybe his mother was right, again, and he did need a fireplace in the main house “Good bye, Draco. Nice to see you again” she managed to say in between Harry’s shoving.
He tried the library, but he was not there either. Draco was starting to suspect he had just apparated somewhere outside of the house but he wanted to doubt that he had left him alone without warning.
“This is hideous” as soon as Draco entered the room he had complained “Who in his right mind would decorate a whole half of a hotel in Gryffindor colors? Is just such an obvious poor taste demonstration” Harry laughed at his back.
“Oops” the elf snapped her fingers and vanished leaving a very amused Harry Potter bursting into laughter and a really embarrassed Draco Malfoy sinking in his seat and hiding his face behind his hands.
Harry watched the ring-lines permanently attached to his right hand and then looked at the golden key on his palm.
He would rather never get used to the sight of Draco crying like that. He kept telling himself it was Alexei, but it was still hard to look at. There was so much pain in his eyes, in his voice. He also tried not to think about the injuries in his body, he would take care of them later, but the thought of Alexei not feeling them…he could hurt Draco so much without noticing. Maybe this link was not such a good idea after all. He was putting his patient at risk and so far it was not worth it.
“Not much, the twins are driving me crazy. I caught Lorcan out in the garden the other night, almost leaving the wards. I think he was chasing something or was affected by Wracksputs, I didn’t have my glasses though” Harry smiled at that.
“I love you” he said against Draco’s neck. He had said those words before, but he hadn’t meant them. He thought he had, but he was obviously wrong “I love you, Draco” he repeated and the blond pulled away.
“Mr. Potter would prefer Pumpkin Pie which is Madam’s favorite, Apple Crisp Cheesecake, Master Draco’s favorite or Fresh Peach Crumble with season fruit?”
Draco heard a knock on the door and stood up softly. It couldn’t be Harry and there was no one else who would call to the brunet’s room so he took his wand out just in case.
He tried the locks in the closed door, but it didn’t open and somehow he had the feeling it wouldn’t.
“What are you doing here?” he guided Potter to his wardrobe and put on only his underwear; he was covered in wounds, and he needed to keep them accessible for his healer.
No, Harry couldn’t have been there. Had he been lying to Draco? Was that possible? Apparently everything was possible for Harry Potter. He could even fix a broken wand.
It was a lot to take in and he knew Malfoy would need time to adjust himself to the idea. As soon as the man agreed, he would perform the analysis of his soul, and they would know if the theory was correct or not. From then on it was a matter of trial and error.
Draco saw a box, a different one, among the other. He knew that box contained something important. He had no idea how, but he did.
“Ana. You did it! You survived!” he exclaimed running to hug his sister. She smiled and returned his hug.
Maybe he had to go looking for him. Maybe everything was on the other side of that veil. Maybe he could finally find the library and his answers and his boyfriend…
The only thing he hadn’t managed to get was a damn yard. The bloody house had not a single outdoors space, save for the roof. He had thought about charming a drawing room to make it look like a garden or something, but it wouldn’t be the same, so he gave up and came around the idea of living a place with serious ventilation problems.
They left the RUMMA and made the way to the hotel in less than fifteen minutes even when they refused to apparate; well, Harry did. Draco had just avoided the discussion and agreed with him.
He didn’t not register the ten seconds that followed Draco’s voice. His attention was on the blond. His mind was blurred by happiness and his eyes with tears. He was safe. He was back. He had chosen to live, to go back to him and their world.
Draco made his way to the bathroom, that was obviously where Harry had come from. A soft, green towel had been left for him and Draco thought for a moment in asking Harry to clean and compose his clothes, but he had to stop fearing his magic. If he turned into Alexei, well, they could use the opportunity to gather more information; anyway, he decided to do it after taking a most needed shower. It was obvious Harry had remodeled the bathroom, since Draco was incapable of imagining his ancestors washing themselves in a black-marble-tiled, modern shower with glass doors, automatic water-keys and multidirectional jets. Well…he could barely imagine himself doing that, but there was no doubt Potter enjoyed his bathroom time. He stepped into the shower, confused about the many keys, but as soon as he closed the screen, the upper jet actioned itself and let the water flow at the perfect temperature. Draco stayed like that for a couple minutes before locating the shampoo and pouring some on his palm. It was honey-scented, but it smelled different in the bottle, it was not exactly how Harry’s hair smelled and for some reason, it bothered him.
“Connection?” Harry asked. He had been trying for too long to bring some sense upon Alexei’s situation; he wouldn’t refuse some answers. Even if they were coming from that man.
“Long story. Just take us to the castle, discreetly, please” the man was obviously not convinced but nodded anyway.
What had really puzzled Harry was the note he received from Kreacher. Poorly written, due to the old elf’s semi-blindness, he notified Harry in it that his cousin had gone by the house and when he had found out he was not there he had asked Kreacher to tell him he had sent him an e-mail; although Kreacher had written
“Well, not me. I can only feel what he is feeling and, believe me, it is enough” Harry felt a little bit ashamed. If Draco was felling the third part of what he felt, those were no emotions for a thirteen years old kid.
They passed a couple more rooms before finding the library, one of them was probably Harry’s chamber, another one had a sign with Regulus name on it, and the other was heavily warded, with every possible muggle and magical lock. He was going to ask, but decided against it. He would question his house distribution another time.
They arrived to the library in less than twenty minutes, and Harry cursed himself for not choosing a longer way there. He had savored every second of that ride. Since Hagrid gave it to him, his godfather’s bike was one of the most valuable thing for Harry. He had taken the muggle test for driving and gotten the ministry permission to use an enchanted vehicle after he had turned eighteen and since then, he had chased every opportunity to use it. It gave him a sense of freedom he was not used to experience outside of a broom and, to his advantage, he could use his bike among the muggles as well.
How could Harry go down there every day? It was a miserable place and he couldn’t possible fit in that passage.
“Good morning, sleeping beauty” Harry greeted and Draco blushed. Of course he blushed. Who had energy to flirt at this hour?
“That doesn’t work for me, little devil” she was Harry’s kryptonite, she could ask for a flying unicorn with purple hair and he would get it for her as long as she looked at him like that. Draco was the strict dad; someone had to.
“I will. Please, send Mr. Malfoy my regards” she smiled sadly and he knew why, she had told him about Lucius’ state, but she nodded anyway before leaving him alone.
“I should shave after breakfast, I’m a mess” he meant it, he had never take so little care of his beard before, but he had been too busy to notice it until now.
Robards returned six minutes later with an old pocket-watch and handed it to Harry. Draco took the chain that hanged from it.
Dotted lines appeared in every direction, like dust seen through a sunbeam. They went straight to a mirror before moving to the next one and the next one and the one after that, until it disappeared in front of a particular one. Harry may have been confused had he not entered to Koldovstoretz through a damn mirror. He touched the surface tentatively and when it moved, making waves, like a stone breaking the calmed water, he threw himself inside without a second thought.
Their first stop was on Vaynera Street where they located a fancy beauty center and Draco got his hair-cut. From then on, Harry was dragged shop after shop until Draco bought enough souvenirs for his friends and his mother, he even bought tiny leather fingerless gloves for Bibly; when Harry asked why, Draco explained that she was a free elf, she was an employee with a salary, vacations and medical insurance as the new law dictated. Anyway, if you asked her, she would probably declare his absolute loyalty to them.
The healer managed to unzip the blonde’s coat enough to see if he had any injuries, and even when he was not wounded, a bunch of hematomas were starting to form everywhere, his skin was really hot but he was shivering. Harry was officially panicking. Alexei was out of control and that was messing with Draco’s power. Wizards healed by means of their own magic, and his medicines were just a plus to aid his organism; if he lost his control that way, it would affect his body that was already in a delicate situation.
“Hello, prince” the man whispered back. He was awake. He had just given him time to adjust after waking up.
“I’m fine” he answered roughly but when his best-friend and wife sent him deadly glares he added “Thank you” Draco nodded, slightly amused, before asking the same to Hermione.
“I don’t think she’ll be joining us. Bibly says she went out and didn’t say where or when was she coming back” Harry nodded and started putting some dill marinated salmon and arugula salad into his plate. Draco picked the same and poured some white wine into their glasses.
“That’s the problem, it is not something you get or catch and for sure is not a thing you miss while growing up. That’s why I thought of dark magic, a curse maybe”
“I am afraid Koldovstoretz’s Head Master is a private man, he allows no one on the school grounds if not for academic purposes. I could put a word for you if you offer something for the students”
Once he was done he wrapped himself in the towel and tried to find a hairbrush in the bathroom, but he had serious doubts he could find any.
What had been Draco wearing when he left the room? What had they last talked about? Had he said something and Harry didn’t notice?
“Here we are” he said while turning off the bike and hating the moment Draco’s body got away from his. He had spent the night with the blond in his arms, it should have been enough, but no, he kept looking for contact, craving for it.
“Yeah, I think I remember that. And I guess it explains the bandages” Harry nodded, his look fixed on him; Draco noticed the dark circles under the emerald eyes “Why were you on my bed?” not that he was complaining, he didn’t remember the last time he had woke up to a hot body against his, but he could imagine more pleasant circumstances.
The bedside table was full of potion vials and ointment containers, bandages, tonics and towels. The wand he had returned to the Slytherin, rested beside a cold cup of tea.
“I’m old, Harry. I’m as old as the world itself. I have been here to see every time, every war, every fight, every disease, every famine, every single death. I don’t do it for my own pleasure, I am just doing my job. Therefore, I’m not an irrational being. I don’t just take a healthy man’s life for the mere fact that they fell through one of my veils” the explanation was taking too long, but, as stupid as Harry could get to be, he was not going to rush Death “In those cases, they face a test. They can choose whether to stay in there or come back. Your godfather preferred what my world offered; maybe your friend would prefer yours”
When they finally entered, a bunch of orbs started shining with a soft white light. It looked like a lot of
“No, I think a couple times a week would do just fine, but I have to check on you at the beginning. It’s just regular procedure, since I work with combined treatments” he had finished packing up his stuff again and was about to head to the door “I’ll be going then”
There was something hanging from it, a veil or something like that. A foggy, dark veil that fell in shreds from top to bottom and moved softly, like it had just been touched or the air had moved it. But there was no air in there. There was nothing and no one.
“Wait. It was a joke” they looked at him astonished “I mean, this was once the way to enter, but it was a little hard for kids so they modernized it a couple decades ago. It reads the core now; you just have to go through the door” Draco understood now why Hermione had told him this man was peculiar. He had cut his hand just to play them a joke…definitely funny.
They continued their way through the muggle village. Harry usually found himself more comfortable doing his shopping in muggle stores and Teddy enjoyed the trip as much as he did. The boy had a taste for muggle candy, he stated that the flavors were normal and agreeable, unlike the ones in the Bertie Botts’ beans. He paid for the blueberries and put them in the bag before checking the time.
They got to the bed and Harry made him lay, face down. The bump in his lower back was not that bad, since he had landed in the carpet, but it looked awful, nonetheless. The cut was closed in a couple of minutes and Harry had applied ointment and bound it up, it will take some time, as the previous wounds, but it would heal.
They kept eating in silence, well, except for Kreacher complaining about the mess his master had made to get breakfast ready in short time. Once they were done Harry made his way towards the main door, grabbing a black jacket on his way out. None of them had mentioned the sweater Draco was wearing so he had had no time to thank him or question why were they so wrapped, but before he had the chance, Harry took something out of his pocket, placed it in the pavement and pointed at it with his wand after checking there was no one around. A couple minutes later he was passing one of his legs over a motorcycle and turning on the engine.
The Malfoy’s fortune was lost, mostly in payments for the damage of the war, as the Wizengamot had declared, and the savings they had in foreign accounts were not nearly enough to keep their previous lifestyle, but that was not an impediment; they could adjust to a simpler life, the thing was they needed to keep going. Maybe Draco couldn’t become a famous researcher or potionist as he had once thought, but he had to do something, something meaningful, something he could be proud of. He had started studying the art of wand-making once he met Adelaide Beavais, who had followed her mother’s steps in that sophisticated art, but developed her work in a small wizarding village in Lyon, and who took him gladly as her apprentice. Now, four years after becoming an expert, he had his own style, still in refinement, but good enough to grant him economic independence. He spent hours in his workshop, experimenting and petting carefully every detail of his wands, mostly sold in France, Italy and Germany and, especially, customized.
“You doomed his family. You sent them on the wrong path, you were the reason they were killed and yet you say it was to help him?” the veil moved, but Harry saw nothing coming out so he kept his focus on the other wizard.
“Have you been sighing and whispering my name while you work? Or was just basic complain about how annoying I used to be?” the golden boy was definitely ashamed.
The lobby was strangely decorated, with half of it in red and gold and the other half in a pure white, each one connected to a set of stairs with similar ornamentation. The reception was in the middle, elegant but normal, no particular color inclination.
“Harry, my boy, what a…” he started greeting until he noticed that Draco was unconscious and his expression transfigured into worry “What happened?”
The first thing he did, after pushing Harry off the bed, was wrap himself with the sheets, finding little cover in the half-undone bath robe Draco had been using.
Next step was to take care of himself. He asked Kreacher for some coffee and breakfast and made his way to the bathroom. Cold water was in order and he let it run over him, just standing there clearing his head for a while before taking his honey and almonds shampoo and pouring a little bit too much in his hair; some of the product fell down his neck but he ignored it, mixing it later with the soap to wash the rest of his body. Foam was everywhere in the shower and he appreciated even more the cold water now; steam would have made the air too heavy with smells and his head was not in the mood for it.
“Of course I’ll go out with you, Harry” he answered sweetly before adding “But I still need to cut my hair. I’m sick of looking like my father” Harry laughed.
“Draco, what’s wrong? Are you feeling bad?” he tried again in the calmest voice he could manage at the moment. His eyes were fixed in the shaking figure as he grabbed a letter-opener from somewhere near the desk and pointed it to Harry. Was that there before? It didn’t matter. The only important thing at the moment was Draco and the way he was hurting his palm with the sharpened object.
“I…I am not Draco” the voice was his, definitely, but the accent, the tone, the look in his eyes when Harry managed to finally focus on them…that was not Draco Malfoy.
Suddenly, a pure white light projected from Draco’s chest and a small bluish ball formed between the two wizards; streams of light surrounding it. He had seen that before, when he and Sirius had been attacked by the Dementors in the forest and his godfather’s soul had left his body for a brief instant. He knew that he was looking at Malfoy’s soul. The ball was not a perfect sphere though, it had a darker protuberance, moving around like an orbiting moon. It was smaller and had no presence, except for the physical deformation it caused. Harry had his answers already, but his magic was not satisfied and it reached for the lump.
He was suspicious. He had the feeling his mother had managed to leave them alone. She had been bothering him about building a civil relationship with Harry, and even when he had assured her that they were civil enough, she kept insisting. That looked very much like one of his mother’s attempts.
“Oh, good to know you were just mildly dying, I’ll make sure not to worry next time” he rolled his eyes. And then she called him a drama queen, bullshit “I’ll bring you some food, I think you have lost weight” Harry looked at her fondly, and Draco smiled while she left the room.
“No” they hadn’t talked about kids aside from that time at the hotel “We have been together for too little. I don’t want to rush anything or do something that would scare him” he said and Hermione smiled, understandingly.
“Dad, are you okay?” he didn’t like this place. They had been taken away from the palace and he still wasn’t sure why. He knew something was happening in the country, he had seen the people shout at the palace gates but, why? Why were they angry? Why  had his father told him he was no longer the tsarevich? Had he done something wrong?
Wands could not be mended once they broke and yet Draco was holding Harry’s wand. He was holding something that should be impossible.
oy, but it was not. He leaned against a wall to catch his breath after running a second time around the whole floor. Maybe he had gone back to the room, maybe he was in a different floor, maybe he had just gone to the garden for a stroll, maybe, maybe, maybe.
A tattoo-like mark surrounded his neck like a collar, except it did not fuse in the middle, instead, both ends fell down in thick lines until they reached the center of his sternum. Right between his heart and magical core.
“Neither have I” the dark-haired wizard offered “but according to the report, there was a case fifty-seven years ago”
Six more chapters up!! I hope you are enjoying the story so far. I know these last chapters are a bit messy so if you have any questions I'll be glad to answer them in the comments.
“No, this one is fine. I just…I’m not used to cats. Mother never let me have any pet other than an owl and the manor is not exactly near anywhere with domestic animals. I only saw them at Hogwarts and now that my neighbors have a dog, but no cats around” an image of teenage Draco trying to stroke Crookshanks in the halls of the castle when no one was looking popped into Harry’s mind and he almost cooed.
“I don’t know, Draco, I haven’t been even near that thing in my entire life, what makes you think I know how it works?” he walked to the little table where it was ringing and picked the handset.
Harry vanished the shirt and trousers and started working. Draco had nine wounds, two of them really nasty, so he focused on those first. Getting the splinter out of his thigh, Harry cleaned the spot and stitched it magically at the same time he injected a bunch of potions straight in his bloodstream; blood replenishing, calming draught, wound-cleaning potion and the special medicine he had made. Collarbone was next. He repeated the same procedure, removed the splinter and closed the wound, and then moved to the smaller ones. The thigh was the worst one, since he had lost a lot of blood from it, and the clavicle was too close to the neck, and could have been fatal. The others were distributed in his abdomen and limbs, but were considerably shallower.
Harry waited for him to get used to the invasion with his arms at each side of Draco’s, a thin layer of sweat covering his skin, making his hair stick to his forehead. He had lost his glasses at some point but that didn’t prevent him from staring at the mess of moans and sighs that was Draco, like he could fade any minute.
“The most plausible explanation is that you have suffered some kind of soul alteration, since your core was intact when I checked it” he finished and Draco took a second to absorb the information.
“Get in with me” he asked “Please” he added as if it was necessary to plead Harry, who was more than happy to oblige his every wish. He took off his clothes, doubting if it was appropriate to take off his underwear too, but Draco took the decision for him and turned to do it himself. He got in and they positioned with Draco between his legs, his back against Harry’s chest and his head resting on his boyfriend’s shoulder.
“Relax” Ellias growled and they both made silence. When they entered the bathroom they headed straight to a huge mirror on the wall. Ellias went first, disappearing through it like it was water. Harry looked around but no one seemed to notice anything. Harry went in next and Draco followed close.
Harry almost buried the man with a look but he softened his expression when Draco entwined their fingers. They walked past the entry, not contentedly, since Draco could feel some kind of spell rummaging through his magic, but after the initial moment of discomfort he found himself pleased with the way more adequate vision that welcomed them. That was more Draco’s style: fancy and cozy.
Back to Hermione’s letter, she had asked how they were too vaguely, almost politely, probably out of the excitement of having a baby-boy coming up soon, and told him about how Ron was planning on throwing a party but wanted to wait for him to celebrate. She also asked if they were together already and, if so, how was he planning on telling her husband. That had made him smile; she knew him way too well.
Harry had stood up, looked at him as if he was processing the words and he had finally burst. A vase broke and Draco felt Harry’s magic trembling in the air. He had panicked for a second, thinking that it could trigger Alexei and he wasn’t sure he would handle that very well. The brunet left the room and Draco didn’t see him until the next day, when he found a navy blue sweater on the bed after his shower and headed to breakfast, finding Hermione there. We know the rest.
“But we have barely been together the last few weeks, you are always busy. And now I’ll have to stay with gran for three days and I love her, but I miss you, Harry” he was almost crying, and his hair had turned blue. Thanks Merlin he had taken precautions. Harry kneeled in front of the boy and hold him near.
It was a strange library. It had no bookshelves, no parchments, no tables, no quills, no people, no Harry. It was empty.
He casted a spell he had learn on his trips, a spell to track dittany. He had learnt to use it in order to find ingredients and to differentiate a real medicine from a placebo when he had a test or to spot the altered ingredients when he bought on informal markets, so to speak.  Harry used dittany in most of his potions, including Draco’s.
“I don’t trust you to stay in the house, as soon as I let you down you will run to your workshop and Harry was really specific about that, especially after seeing it” she stated and he rolled his eyes. He was not going to fall to the basement or start nipping himself with every wood splinter.
“I think it was the other way around, Mr. Dark Magic, sir” Draco had laughed and Harry had confirmed he was completely at ease with his past. He kissed his smile and lead him to the kitchen to get some wine and cheese and a ton more kisses.
“Good. Are you done or do you need more time?” Draco checked his notes and then the book on his hands.
He tried to regain his breath before opening his eyes. A hand – Harry’s hand – was making circles in his back, comforting him.
They had not talk about the exchange with Alexei, but Draco knew the name Romanov. He had studied it while he was a kid, and his father was lecturing him about the importance of knowing the wizarding members of the monarchy. Besides Victoria and the current queen, Isabel, there had been only a few, but Lucius had made him study the whole family three of the English royalty. And if his memory wasn’t failing, the Romanov last name was somewhere around it.
There was no answer at first, but a minute after, the door opened and a guilty-looking Potter was staring back at him, his lower lip trapped between his teeth.
“He was in so much pain, Harry” he whispered “I was…conscious, I heard, or something like that, the entire conversation. When he started thinking about his family, remembering his death…it was so heartbreaking” he wiped his tears “He’s just a boy”
His father was distressed; he could see that. And his mother? Well, she had never been the same after Father Grigori had died. He hadn’t either, his knees were swollen and he had no one to heal them. He was scared of falling, of going out, of playing with his sister…yes, sister, Ana was the only one that still played with him. The others were too busy growing up.
“No, I’m not, since he is not charging us anything” he coughed spiting his tea back into the cup “Draco! Manners!”
“What do you mean?” the headmaster turned and locked his eyes on the other wizard for the first time since he showed up, before his skin paled “Impossible” he murmured “You cannot be alive” his hand was trembling “Potter, what have you done?”
He kept looking. Tatiana was the laziest one, she would be close to the fountain, probably behind the rose bushes. He went to get her but he saw Maria first, sneaking from the back of the lion shaped water-sprinkler.
“Liar. You’re already flouting. He told you to stay in bed and rest, and here you are” he chuckled in her hair. To his mother’s eyes he was always going to be a kid, especially since they didn’t have to worry about legacy and prestige anymore, they had had it hard to be a normal family when he was younger, but now she could openly be the loving, caring mother she had always been. He was everything she had and vice versa.
“What is it?” not losing time with his hair but adjusting his white coat a little, he made his way to the door of the resting room, followed by the tiny girl.
Harry was fully concentrated in his attentions and Draco thought for a moment he would pass out from the pleasure he was feeling. It had been too long and he wasn’t going to last much more.
She complained but accepted her defeat and he went back to get Tatiana. Not a hard task, the girl had gotten distracted with a bee on one of the flowers. She even squeaked scared when he touched her shoulder and went back running to the base where Olga and Maria were talking about dancing lessons.
“Thanks. That’s helpful, believe it or not” it was, Harry just didn’t know why at the time “You are strangely calm today. The usual would be for you to be running around and probably hurting yourself. Not complaining, just saying”
Two down, one to go. He looked in every imaginable place. Even the trees, where she would hide if it was any other person looking. He huffed, frustrated, about to give up when he saw his mother smile, amused.
He was trying to decipher if a certain scrawl was a representation of the Thurisaz rune or the Wunjo one when Harry’s face appeared mere inches away from his. He took a step back, hiding his surprise as well as he could.
“Yeah, but I though some Internet could come in handy if we want this done quickly and I don’t have it at home” Draco looked at him as if he had grown a couple horns in the middle of the forehead and he had to laugh at that.
Harry was pacing around the living room, muttering something to himself that neither Draco or Hermione could hear. The witch was sipping her tea and trying a cookie, her eyes closed in utmost relaxation while the blonde’s leg moved unstoppably. How could she stay so calm when her best friend looked like he was about to murder someone?
“What the hell is that and why should it be because of dark magic?” he looked confused so Harry started explaining the situation.
The former salon on the second floor was now his studio and there were two more bathrooms, for his guest’s comfort in the third floor; which was entirely for visits, including Teddy’s playroom, since the boy’s actual bedroom was in Regulus old chambers, next to his.
Harry had left a bunch of potions on the bathroom the first day so he went to get one to calm the ache of his body. He was not a healer but he had been superb at Potions back in school and he could find a damn bottle and take the proper amount by himself. He did not depend on Harry, at least for that.
“I will talk to him and let you know tomorrow morning” she resumed her reading and like that they were dismissed.
“Sure. Let’s get changed” they moved around the room to get ready while talking about other plans they could get done until Monday.
. At first he had forgotten it, he had been too worried about Draco to think about anything else, and then Alexander had asked him not to take it to the Prophecies’ Room since it was heavily protected against all kind of spells and he could get caught with a simple
“I think I’ve heard something about them, not good, I’m afraid” Harry confessed, now with the whole picture in front of him.
Draco’s dream came to him. He heard his voice, telling him what had happened, as he ran downstairs. Turn here, careful with the broken step, follow your instincts, well, at least that was something he had. It usually got him into trouble but he was looking for that, he needed to find Draco and he knew he was in danger, he needed Harry and he was not there.
“Y-yes.” He stuttered out; Harry could see Draco sitting up out of the corner of his eye, but he was refusing to look at him. He looked down into his lap, which was apparently a whole lot worse.
He sighed, guessing it was just another girl calling for his business partners every need. Draco put the phone down on his shoulder, shouting for Potter downstairs. He heard the scrambling of feet flying up the steps before the door burst open. Draco pointed the phone in his direction and the man's face instantly fell, grabbing the phone out of his hand.
Harry’s eyes narrow, huffing pointedly, he tries to speak, but the boy shoves a hand over his mouth.
His eyes travelled over to his two best friends, they'd gotten together after the war and they were practically talking about marriage already. Hermione was asleep on Ron's shoulder, Ron was playing with her hair. Harry wanted to vomit, it's not even like they were snogging but after Ginny; Harry couldn't even stand to see anyone in a happy relationship.
i can’t begin to describe how delighted i am at the love my fic has got, it went up so quickly and is still going!!
“Never have I ever, kissed someone in school?” It was Hannah Abbot’s question, she kicked back her shot, winking at Neville; who spluttered into his own drink, blushing furiously. Harry took another shot, remembering him and Ginny’s kiss in the common room in sixth year. Hermione obviously drank, along with Ron and Luna. “Okay, I’m kicking things up a little, never have I ever kissed someone of the same gender.” Blaise chimed in, picking up his own glass. Dean and Seamus drank, which wasn’t a surprise, they’d been dating since the war ended. Ginny took her shot, along with Luna, who slung an arm around Ginny’s waist.
Draco stumbled back onto the sofa he knew was there, he let Harry down next to him, who leaned back on the arm rest, breathing heavily. Draco couldn’t stand a second away from him, pulling the other boy onto his lap, Harry straddled his waist; kissing him blindly. He reached for Draco’s belt, his breath hitched, his body on fire. Harry looked up at him with pleading eyes and Draco could not wait.
be gay, thinking these thoughts felt poisonous, he might vomit on the spot. “Harry?” Ron whispered, Harry’s head snapped up to look at his very concerned pair of friends.
“No fucking way.” Draco removed his head from Harry’s shoulder, sitting up as straight as a board. Harry looked at him cautiously, confusion coursing through his face.
changes. “Okay, I have a lot of work to do here.” Draco motioned to the oddly coloured walls of the kitchen, Harry shoved him gently.
Before the war, Harry felt like he was constantly walking on tissue paper that could tear any minute. He fought one of the most powerful dark wizards ever and won, but he couldn’t complete his seventh year potions exam, he felt like such a failure. He couldn’t live up to being “the boy who lived”, Harry would give anything just to have lived a normal life.
hermione and pansy are great friends, harry has some things to say, draco is more than happy to listen
He walked around to the computer that was sat at the till area, going through what orders they had to do specifically for today, replying to emails and noting down what ingredients they were running low on. It was a tedious job, but with only two of them in the store everyday, one of them had to do it. And considering Potter’s brain was made of sawdust when it came to things like this, it was Draco’s task.
Draco reached the old wood shed at the barriers of the Hogwarts grounds, he came here a lot during his sixth year, it was the sole place in the whole school that was completely secluded from everyone; the only other person that knew about his wood shed was Pansy Parkinson. She was the one that actually discovered it but they hadn't been there together since they broke up. They had a horrible relationship, it revolved around them getting wasted and having sex, they broke up when the war started since Draco was needed a lot away from Hogwarts and Pansy's parents were trying to get them to marry each other. They were still friends but had been distant since returning, Draco just guessed the war had hit her badly.
Harry found he didn’t know what to say. He didn’t talk to Draco about his father. He hated the subject, tried to pull away from it as much as possible. Harry wasn’t sure whether he had it in him to be understanding. Draco had told him once that that was okay but Harry hadn’t wanted to press it. “He seems to really care about his dad.”
what you said, when I was upset about Father. You said you believed me. And now you’re saying that you don’t believe that I can be better than that, I guess. So if you don’t know how I feel about — about the last year, about anything, then why are you even here?”
Harry decided to get all of them a glass of wine, deliberately disappearing into the utility room for a few minutes to give them some privacy.
Harry had guessed as much but he decided against telling Draco that. Instead, he hummed encouragingly and kept them walking through the manor, towards Draco’s bedroom. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Blighter at one point and raised a hand in a half-wave. Blighter nodded in acknowledgement, keeping a close eye on their movements. Draco’s feet were trailing.
For a second they both stared at each other. Malfoy didn’t look quite so stark when he wasn’t in a prison uniform, but he was still as thin. He was taller, too, and had a few inches on Harry. He was wearing a plain white shirt which was obviously too large for him and a pair of plain grey trousers. Everything he wore looked expensive and soft and his feet were entirely bare. Harry stared at them. His toes looked strangely vulnerable.
Harry stood and made his way to the box. It led him past Narcissa and he made a point of nodding at her.
the Malfoy’s and he had no earthly reason to keep coming back. Except, he could smell the scent of the flowers from the Malfoy’s garden even through the wall, the sweet scents mingling with something heavier, muskier, and he was at least not lying on his back, replaying an argument he could not change or months spent living in a tent, afraid of his life. He wasn’t lying in bed and remembering how it had felt to die.
Harry liked that. He liked the atmosphere. He didn’t like how several of the other employees blinked in shock and surprise when they saw him but he was trying to get more used to it and he supposed it wasn’t fair to completely write them off because of it.
Before Harry could say anything she had disappeared, her laughter trailing down the hallway back to him. Harry sat back in the armchair and looked around Lavender’s crowded living room, waiting for her to come back with a lot of books that he would read and felt a spark in his chest which felt like contentment. He imagined getting his questions answered, imagined finding a purpose. He pictured himself going home and telling Ron and Hermione and he thought about their faces and how happy they would be if he knew what he wanted. He thought about telling Draco as Draco added drops to one of his potions, imagined the quirk of his eyebrow and how he would roll his eyes just before he smiled. It made him feel happy.
Ginny snorted. “No, it is true and I think that. Every time I try to help Mum or talk to her she just cries, you know? And I feel
Malfoy coloured instantly. Harry had noticed that he seemed to do that easily, his skin so pale that all of his emotions seemed to affect it. Harry watched the blush springing up, his eyes following Malfoy as he leaned against the bathroom sink. He crossed his arms over his chest and sighed, looking mulish and uncertain. “No,” Malfoy snapped. “Don’t be so crass. I’m here to tell you I don’t want you to take what I’m saying in the wrong way.”
Late that night, Herbert, the Malfoy’s owl, appeared at Harry’s bedroom window, pecking gently to be let in. Harry started and then pulled himself out of bed, easing the window open. Herbert dropped the letter onto Harry’s bed and then flew around, perching on the window sill and hooting lowly. Harry grinned at him and went to pick up the letter.
“All right,” he said finally. He felt some of the tension leave Malfoy’s body. “I’m going to shower now. You can leave.”
“Are you waving, mate?” Ron asked, voice just above a whisper, amusement and bemusement tangling together.
“You never told me that you were writing to Ron and Hermione,” Harry said from the doorway of the kitchen.
Draco let out a huge sigh. His spine curled as he bent forward and then he lifted a hand to tug at Harry’s curls. Harry knew he was holding them straight, watching them spring back into shape. He let him. “It’s a terrible telling off. I don’t feel cowed at all.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said, looking for words that disappeared completely when Malfoy moved again, pulling Harry down to him as Malfoy ground up. The air left Harry’s lungs in a rush and he dropped his forehead against Malfoy’s shoulder. He wanted more. He knew it with a startling clarity and Harry moved his hands, dragging them out of Malfoy’s hair, and seeking the warmth under Malfoy’s shirt. He pressed sloppy, open mouthed kisses along Malfoy’s throat, sucking a bruise onto his collarbone, biting lightly at it. Malfoy groaned and Harry felt heat and pressure and the blinding need of release coil through him.
“There’s ghosts everywhere, Potter.” Malfoy looked at him like he thought he was daft. “I’ll have to be careful you don’t sneak up on me talking to one.”
Harry did not feel like the dictionary definition of a decent sort at all. He felt reckless and wild, grinding into Malfoy, balancing himself on the chair and pressing kisses down Malfoy’s jawline. He pulled back to capture Malfoy’s mouth in a kiss, his hands still buried in Malfoy’s hair, holding him in place. He didn’t think he needed to, though. It was as if Malfoy was trying to fold his whole body around Harry. His hands were on Harry’s hips now, nails digging viciously in and legs twined around Harry’s. Everytime Harry moved, Malfoy clutched at him. It made Harry’s heart sing with euphoria and adrenaline. It made him feel like he was diving off a cliff.
Malfoy pulled a face. “Don’t be so disgusting, Potter,” he drawled. “I told you. I’m here because talking to you gives me a headache and I thought that, if we were outside in the fresh air, it might combat some of your natural headacheness.”
Ron looked kind as he leaned forward, reaching out to pat Harry’s arm. “No, of course you did,” he said, in the same tone of voice Harry had heard mothers adopt with children. It made a laugh rise in his chest and he leaned back, arms crossed over his chest.
“Liar.” Harry turned to look at the bubbling cauldrons and said, “How many of these are time sensitive?”
“Shut up, Ronald. Anyway, Draco’s trial starts in about twenty minutes and — well Lucius’ has been going on for a few days already.” Hermione pushed a hand through her hair. “We’re not going to that one.”
“No.” Malfoy drew himself up to his full height. “You may think that everyone’s going to just fall at your feet — Saviour Potter, back at it again! — but I won’t. I won’t just let you come in here and upset
It made Harry laugh, but he knew this was serious and he reached out, grabbing onto Draco’s wrist. He held onto the fine bones until Draco looked up properly. Maintaining eye contact, he said, “Tell me why.”
Narcissa held up a hand; Harry was extremely relieved to have an outside impetus to be quiet. She was smiling and Draco’s amusement was shining from his face too, his grin wide and the light in his eyes undeniable. Harry did not stare.
There was an owl at his window. Harry grinned and unfastened the note, unrolling it as he lay down on his bed.
“I’ve never thought that about you,” Harry said, opening the wine and starting to pour it into their glasses. “I’ve always thought you wanted to stop talking about a subject before it was battered to within an inch of its life.”
“But,” Draco started then stopped. He was still on the ground and he tilted his head back to stare at Harry. He looked more than a little confused and a lot lost. They looked at each other for a long moment and then Draco reached his hand out towards Harry. Harry moved forward to grab it and let himself be tugged down onto the ground.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Ginny said, breezily. “I’ve known you to like it a time or two.” Then, she winked; Harry felt the back of his neck heat up again.
if his parents had been alive. The water hit his back, hot and hard as needles, as he sat on the floor of the Malfoy’s shower and pressed his face into his knees. Maybe his mother had enjoyed long showers. Maybe his dad had liked baths. Maybe he would remember bath nights as a kid fondly, maybe he would have been read to sleep, maybe he would have grown up with parents who loved him and pressed kisses to his forehead before he went to sleep and slipped money under his pillow every time a tooth fell out. Maybe he wouldn’t have had to walk into a forest and say that he was ready to die. Maybe he wouldn’t have felt like crying in a Malfoy’s shower, maybe he wouldn’t have been pressing his fingernails so tightly into the soft skin of his thighs that they bruised. Maybe.
Hermione sighed. “He’s been on the Wizengamot for at least fifty years. And the amount of times he falls asleep is apparently shocking. I’ve read the paper mentioning it at least two dozen times and I’m not overly looking for it. It’s a wonder he has his job.”
Draco swallowed and then said, “Because they were important to you.” His face was aflame. Embarrassment was evident in every minute movement he made. Draco twitched his fingers and then pulled his wrist out of Harry’s grasp. Harry let him go. “Don’t make a thing out of it, Potter.”
you?” She looked at Ron with wide eyes. “I thought you were maybe going to fight! I thought maybe one of us would have to come collect you and maybe help cover up some kind of broken nose scenario. Then I thought maybe you were going through a crisis.”
This was definitely helped along by the fact that Malfoy never once mentioned it. Harry had known before that Malfoy was capricious and mercurial, flashing in and out of moods. It had been obvious at school; it was even more obvious now. Harry wasn’t sure if it was worse, either, and did not want to ask. It felt too intimate. Instead, he learned Malfoy, memorised the topography of his face: he learned the curve of his mouth which meant he was amused and hiding it, the tightness of his jaw which spoke to an anger Harry himself had not caused. He learned the way Malfoy moved: languid and graceful only when he was aware that others were watching, becoming erratic and even
“I thought it’d be nice. They really did get me loads, which is great, but even when I go to the Weasley’s, they just — you probably don’t know this but Mrs Weasley always has the biggest spread and there’s so much food. If I brought everything, I’d probably end up charged with attempted murder.” Harry stopped. “I mean, food coma murder. That’s a new law. They’ve just introduced it. They’re calling it the Christmas law.”
He shook himself and splashed water in his face afterwards and studied his reflection. He looked at the pile of photographs and seized the last of his bags up and apparated to Grimmauld Place. The repairs had rather fallen by the wayside, a grand idea he had wanted to do and then got too caught up in other things. As Harry stood out on the pavement in front of the house, clutching bags of his belongings, he thought maybe he could make it work. Maybe this could be his home.
“Of course not.” Blighter turned and Harry followed him, doggedly attempting some form of conversation that was mostly ignored. Instead of answering his mundane questions, Blighter instead regaled Harry with a list of all the painists that had once played in the piano room, looking more and more vexed as the conversation went on.
“I was so scared, Harry. I thought — I thought this was it. I thought it was my punishment, like it was hubris, and they wouldn’t ever remember and it would be all my fault.” Hermione gasped it out and Harry felt how much it must have hurt her. Even now, her body held that hurt. Even now, he felt the way she shuddered with the thought. Harry hugged her tighter.
Screw it, Harry thought, and stood up then. Malfoy watched him warily as he walked over to him, never taking his eyes off Harry for a moment. Harry held out his hand and Malfoy stared at it, unmoving. Eventually, Harry had to reach out and gentle prise his fingers away from the whiskey glass. Malfoy’s eyes were huge and hot on him: Harry told himself it was the reflection of the flames.
The ringing in his ears stops, the pain in his head levels out to a gentle, dull hum, his erratic breathing stops and the extreme panic in his stomach calms. Harry looks over to the people sat to his left, they’re so familiar, yet so distant. It's almost like they knew each other in some alternate timeline, or he’d read about them in a book once, but he didn’t
Draco was stumbling around their room, it was graduation morning, he had lost his tie, Harry was still in the shower.
Draco almost vomited at the thought of doing anything other than curling up on his sofa with a cup of tea and a novel. He quickly typed out an apology and a rain check, beginning to clean up his work area so him and Potter could close the store. He closed his eyes, inhaling sharply, sticking his nose up as he swung through the door.
Harry didn’t dare breathe, nor move. Draco placed two fingers under his chin, pulling his face up to meet his. He pressed his lips gently against Harry’s, he let out a content sigh. This kiss was different from the last, this wasn’t angry, this wasn’t unresolved sexual tension needing to be released with some sloppy snog. This was a genuine, intimate, sweet moment that Harry had been dying for. He just didn’t expect it from Draco Malfoy, but now that he got it, there was no way in hell he was stopping.
His dorm mate was still out which was strange for it being almost 1am, instead Hermione was sat on Rons bed. Her hair was pulled back into a ponytail, she was wearing her pajamas and working on an essay; she looked like she had been there a while. She noticed his arrival and beamed from ear to ear, she jumped up from where she was sitting and drew him into a bone crushing hug.
He smirked, “and now i'm going to bed.” standing up, leaving a gaping Pansy in her room. “Wait don’t go! I want to know more!” she pleaded, he just gave her the middle finger, backing out of the door. “You’re insane!” Pansy shouted.
“Yeah, we snogged once, dunno why.” Harry chuckled, his face flushing faintly at the memory of that night. Ron spun his chair to face Harry, a smile appearing on his face. “I’m sorry Harry, as long as he’s not being an arse to you, shag who you want.” Ron pulled Harry in for a hug and they just stayed there, holding each other for ages.
Ron laughed and shook his head. “Yeah, you would. You just don’t get it right now. That’s fine, though, because I get it. If you don’t want to be an Auror then, Merlin, Harry, don’t be. I’d only be happy if you were happy, too. Seeing you wear yourself down would break my heart a bit.”
The owl saved him from having to figure out what to say (did he laugh? Did he say something flirty? What was flirty? Had he ever flirted before in his life?). It swooped in, dropping the letter in front of Harry and then retreating to perch on the kitchen counter. Ginny blinked at the owl in surprise and Harry stared at it too, dumbstruck. It was because he was staring that he noticed the owl tenderly turn in circles, apparently displeased at the layer of dust on the counter.
Hermione sniffled again and then she was crying, grabbing for Harry’s hand and then Ron’s. “I’m just so scared of hoping too much,” she whispered.
Draco reached out, eyes still closed, hand encircling Harry’s wrist. “You said you’d read to me.” He was almost pouting. It made Harry’s heart clench.
Draco started. It was extremely physical. He pushed himself forward, spine snapping straight and pulling him away from the wall. His shoulders tensed and he turned his head to look at Harry, eyebrows lifted, jaw slack. His hand was still clutching onto Harry’s but it was much tighter. Harry made himself be soft.
“I don’t want you to be in my shadow, Draco,” Harry said, removing his hand from under Draco’s gin. “You said that and I — I don’t want that for you. I don’t want it for anyone. I think you shine brightly enough on your own. I think you’re going to do great things.”
“I can do it,” Harry said instantly, so fast that it surprised both of them. Ron blinked at him and Harry smiled. “I like dogs. I’ll do it. You’re busier than I am, anyway.”
Harry stretched his legs out over the arm of the chair he was on. “Yeah I guess. It was my fault though and I think it’s because — because I never know what to say to him. Or how to do it. Or how to even start.”
“Maybe I’m not a decent sort,” Harry said. He pressed a kiss to Malfoy’s cheekbone and Malfoy’s eyelashes fluttered closed for a moment. Harry had the fleeting thought that he looked innocent, which was quickly chased away by how hard and greedy Malfoy’s hands were, pressing harshly on Harry’s hips, disappearing into his t-shirt, encouraging Harry to
but I just think that you should take a little more time with the decision. Really think it over.” She took a sip of her wine, nose scrunching as she tasted it. “You don’t owe Narcissa Malfoy anything.”
“You are here for me,” Harry said, smiling at him. “I know you are. But Malfoy’s not — he’s not drugging me. I just genuinely don’t think he would do that — now.”
Harry stared at Malfoy, who in turn was staring out across the fields. His eyes looked unfocused and, despite what he was actually saying, Malfoy looked sad. It was in his eyes, how shuttered they looked, and the way his mouth pulled itself down, and the heavy lines which had appeared across his forehead. Malfoy wasn’t looking at anything in particular, instead looking into the distance, with the fierce look of someone who wanted to run towards it.
He also did not like it when Malfoy thoroughly chased the morose stage of drunkenness, something that was only cut short by him sitting up straight and proclaiming he was going to vomit. Harry ran after him, tripping over a pile of books which delayed him enough that Malfoy had already thrown the door of his en suite open and was hanging over the toilet. Harry didn’t even hesitate before he was on his knees beside Malfoy, a hand rubbing his back, murmuring at him until he was done. Malfoy looked at him with glassy eyes, made several feeble attempts to shove him away and then curled his fingers into the soft cotton of Harry’s t-shirt, pressing his forehead into Harry’s collarbone.
It was the tone of Malfoy’s voice, the way his eyebrows had raised just slightly and the exasperated tilt to his mouth that made Harry laugh, a clear, bell-like sound which rang across the kitchen. Malfoy looked startled at first, though it quickly faded away, replaced by a grin that was small and pleased.
“I’m not worried,” Harry said automatically, despite the fact that anxiety had bloomed in his chest.
“No problem.” Harry pressed the pads of his fingers more firmly against Draco’s back. “You need to take care of yourself, you idiot.”
“I,” Harry said, startled. He wasn’t startled enough to stop, though, and instead he watched Malfoy as he flung his head back, watched a bead of sweat roll down his neck, and gather in the valley of his collarbone. Harry could feel the shake of Malfoy’s thighs, could almost taste how close he was to coming in the air. He leaned forward and licked away the sweat, pumping Malfoy harder, pressing kisses along his neck. He could feel Malfoy tightening underneath him, the build up of pleasure and heat in his body reflecting Harry’s need. Harry dragged his teeth along the line of Malfoy’s jaw and whispered in his ear, “Okay. Come on, Draco. You can come. I’d like you to come.”
“Oh is that a new hobby of ours?” Harry asked, tilting his head towards her. Hermione glared at him. “No, seriously. Are we going to be like the Non-Judging Breakfast Club?”
“No,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Listen, okay? I just want you to — I’ve heard you say you regret stuff, I guess. I just wanted you to say you wanted to keep changing. That’s it. That’s all. It’s not a lot. It
Hermione left for Australia a week before Hallowe’en, trying not to cry, looking pinched and pale. Harry and Ron saw her off, both of them grinning at her, deliberately cheerful in a concentrated way designed to take her mind off her own anxieties. Once the portkey that started her journey activated and Harry and Ron were alone they let their smiles disappear.
Harry dropped his backpack onto the floor and smiled at her, transferring his gaze finally to Draco. Draco was still looking at him in shock.
“No, it’s brilliant,” Harry said. “It was a great idea. I think I’m going to like working with animals.”
Malfoy looked vaguely ill. “This is really hurting me,” he said, almost moaning. “I know that, Potter, but it would greatly alleviate my burden if you could simply say ‘yes, I accept your gratitude and will bear this nobly, as I bear everything’ and we can be done with it.”
Apparating into Hermione’s kitchen, Harry was not in the least surprised to see Ron sitting there waiting. His eyes fell on the boxes in Harry’s hands and he punched the air.
“I said it. You don’t know — you don’t know what every night was like for me right after everything. And you don’t know what it’s always like now. I’m better, Draco, but I’m not stupid enough to think it can’t come back. Hermione used to tell us that it was important to feel it and to know that it was temporary.” Harry could still picture her and her soft, hushed voice as she said it to him and to herself too, how they had pressed against each other on sofas and in the corners of rooms and how they had slept curled around each other sometimes because it helped. He remembered the comfort of it, when he had felt like he was falling apart. “You’ve not absolutely lost it yet, Malfoy, and I’m really proud of you. I just asked you a question about your potions. I don’t think you want to kill people.”
Relieved, Harry let out an exhale which rippled strongly across the surface of his tea, turning it into a mini-ocean. “Thank God.”
“I just felt it.” Harry took the sandwich, carefully unwrapping it as they walked down the corridor towards one of the benches in an alcove. Hermione tucked herself into Ron’s side as they sat, quiet for a long minute as everyone started to eat.
Once a time limit was imposed, Harry floundered for something to say. He slipped his hand through the handle of the mug, lifting it, and looked at Malfoy for a long moment. “I just don’t know what to do, I guess,” he said. He didn’t look at the countdown. The numbers sliding down made him nervous. “That’s what it boils down to. I don’t want to do something and then regret it.”
Harry nodded and Malfoy drew back, patting the back of Harry’s hand. “Wonderful. I’m glad we’re getting to a place of understanding. It gives me hope.”
going to be worth it. It had been just over a fortnight since the last tea and Harry had been very deliberate in the amount of time he had waited (exactly fourteen days) before sending an owl to Narcissa to ask about tea. He had come up with the exact right amount of time to wait with Ginny one night, the two of them sitting squished together on the Weasley’s sofa, everyone else upstairs in their own rooms. Harry didn’t know exactly what was happening anymore between the two of them — it was a shifting, headless monster that neither of them wanted to directly address at the minute. Instead of talking about it, they talked about other things or they drank or plotted how many days it would take for Malfoy to think that Harry had been bluffing.
Draco impulsively reached for his glass, downing his shot in an instant; Pansy drank too. Blaise’s mouth hung open, “Pansy doesn’t surprise me, but you Dray?” Draco shrugged smugly, “Theo Nott, fifth year, a game of truth or dare.” he put his glass down, leaning back against the bed, chuckling to himself faintly.
There was only one other person that could help him with potions, and the last time Harry spoke to him about that subject he told him he knew how to kill him without leaving any traces. Still, he was out of options now.
“Look, I don’t care who you’re shagging, you’re eighteen now, I don’t control you and I never have. But I do hope you realise what you’re doing, this is Malfoy we’re talking about! This is seven years of shit we have to undo?!” Ron ran his hands through his hair, sighing. “You do what you want, I just don’t want you to be another notch on his bedpost. And I don’t mean to state the obvious Harry, but he’s a guy.” Ron motioned to Harry, he rolled his eyes.
“So, am I getting the grand tour?” Draco gave Harry a wicked smile, before he was pulled up the stairs.
“I’m so happy, that house is finally gonna have some life blown into again.” Ron winked, Harry kicked him playfully, throwing his head back; exhaling.
Harry yanked the door to the trophy room open, he hadn’t been here since fourth year and it looked like it hadn’t been cleaned since then. Malfoy set down his bucket, “I’ll start on this side.” He walked over to the left side of the room, starting on the first trophy. Harry blindly moved over to the right side, sighing as he started on his own trophy.
After a very lovely dinner from the house elves, Harry set out to find ron. He wasn’t going to originally but if Ron had got Ginny to speak to him? Something might have happened and he didn’t want to be that arsehole that didn’t help his best friend. He checked the great hall first since dinner was still on, peeking in through the door to see if he could spot the fiery hair of his best mate, he groaned internally when he saw it; meaning he would have to go in.
It was weird seeing their room completely empty, it had become so homely in the short time they had been there. There was none of Harry’s endless quidditch magazines, Draco’s sheet music wasn’t pinned to the corkboard hanging on the wall. Plus Harry’s side of the room was clean for the first time since they returned to school.
Harry shot up, staring blankly at Ginny. “What?” Kiss Malfoy? Over his dead body. He glanced over at Draco in front of him, he expected the boy to be cowering in a corner, except he was sitting proudly; a smirk on his face. “Sure.”
He was hard, painfully hard. From Draco Malfoy. It was actually Harry’s worst nightmare come to life.
Harry sat up a bit, barely hiding the confusion on his face, ever since Ron had put that idea in his head it had been all he could think about. He wasn’t gay, he
He’s not looking at Harry, body angled deliberately away from him. It feels rehearsed, well practised, which makes him wonder exactly
“We think you’ve been in an accident Harry, you were found in the forest and when you woke up…” She trails off, looking to Madam Pomfrey for support, who nods for her to continue. “Madam Pomfrey guesses you’ve been hit by some kind of memory hex, except it was cast by a very experienced hand, and we’re working on how to get it back.”
Right now, he was stood in potions class and he had no idea what he was doing. He didn't have the heart to tell Slughorn that he was bloody awful at potions considering his was top of the class in fifth year, well he
“Well hi everyone...I’m pretty sure you all know who I am, but today, I want to reintroduce myself to you. Everyone here knows me as a saviour, as their hero, golden boy, the boy who just wouldn’t bloody die. But this year, I’ve just simply been Harry. This year was the first time in my life where I could just be normal! Worrying about school and relationships and not about some dark wizard trying to kill me.”
Harry is standing in between the brown haired girl and the boy, he’s dressed in one of those robes with the red hood. And he’s smiling, brighter than any kid he’s ever seen. He is entirely unsure as to what’s happening in the picture, or why he’s so happy, but it doesn’t feel right. The smile looks fake, melted, disoriented, Harry could never smile that much without it being fake. Everything feels wrong, everything feels so fake.
Harry knew no one else could hear him, but by the sounds of a low moan falling from Draco’s lips, his words were true.
“Okay so i’ve not told anyone this yet, not even Ron and ‘Mione, so you can’t say anything alright?” Draco crossed an X over his chest, Harry rolled his eyes. “I took a job at Hogwarts.”
Harry stood up, crossing the circle and flopping down in front of Draco. He'd never been so close to the other boy in their whole life, they had been throwing insults and arguments at each other since first year, but that had always been from afar.
But bloody Potter had to go and ruin that for him, what right did he have telling him to just forget about things? The anger rushed through again, he had to hit something, and that something was probably going to be Potter.
Draco got up, banging on the door of the bathroom, “Harry! You have fifteen minutes to get out and ready!” He shouted, the door swung open and he was hauled into the room.
This plays on a loop in Harry’s head as he’s being hurried down a darkened, dreary hall, filled from floor to ceiling with antique paintings and portraits. The other lady's name is Professor Mcgonagall, she's holding onto his shoulders with frenzied haste. Madam Pomfrey has his head bowed, and a hand over his forehead, gently pushing him through the corridor. They reach a mahogany door, with a brass handle, Mcgonagall doesn’t even knock, she simply walks in; closing the door behind her.
Potter’s breathing levelled out and he stopped crying, his hands that were clutching onto the front of Draco’s shirt released and he sat up a bit; his face flushing with embarrassment. “What happened before you came here?” Draco asked, firmly, not to scare Potter, but to ground him.
He could see out of the corner of his eye that they were pulling into Hogsmeade station. He was terrified, going back to the place where he spent so much time after it had been destroyed on his own doing, that's got to sting a little bit.
“Thank god you came back Harry, we thought you weren’t going to.” she admitted, casting a glare at her boyfriend.
“Meet me here at 8pm sharp, no later or I will add another week, you’re dismissed boys.” She shooed them both away, Harry nodded his head at her before darting out the room.
As soon as the door was closed Draco had Harry shoved up against a wall, kissing him fervently, his hands travelling up to Harry’s hair, tugging, enjoying the illicit moan that came out of his mouth. He kissed down the other boys tanned neck, leaving already purpling marks as he went. Harry pulled his head back up, kissing him again, fingers grasping for Draco’s buttons, unbuttoning them quickly; not stopping this time.
Draco stood behind Harry, wrapping his arms around his waist, his face buried in the mess of Potter hair. He swayed them both gently, softly moving them to the music still playing on the radio. “It’s ready love” Harry kissed him on the cheek, turning off the stove. They both bumbled around the kitchen, Draco setting the table and lighting candles because “that’s how the Malfoy’s do it.” Harry plated up their food, adding the last little flourishes so it was
“We can’t do this Potter, don’t make this any harder than it already it.” Draco started gathering up his oils, placing them into small glass jars for resale.
"Checking how high the drop is, see if its worth it." Harry was seething, the cheek of Malfoy since they had returned had been through the roof, and Harry wasn't taking it anymore. He grabbed the boys shoulders and shoved him against the wall, "Don't forget Malfoy, you'd be dead without me too, you'd be lying in ashes right now if i didn't have the fucking decency to pull you of out of that bloody fire! We both saved each other okay? It's time forget about it"
“Oh, so it’s Potter now? I'm pretty sure it was ‘Harry’ a few days ago...” He added, resting a hand on the kitchen counter. Draco slammed his spoon down on the table, making Harry wince slightly. “Stop it, stop
So he slept with every girl he could, trying to push down the feelings that were bubbling up in his stomach for years. And apparently, snogging Harry Potter was the outcome of those feelings.
expensive black porsche that his Father had bought him, which he liked to remind everyone of when he could. He was just leaving when Potter walked into the office, a forlorn look on his face.
Harry felt the unfamiliar feeling flood through him, it wasn't exactly unwelcome but it was far from pleasant. "First time" Malfoy questioned, raising an eyebrow. Harry shrugged, taking another inhale, "it gets better, I do it all the time, calms me down" Malfoy shared, Harry was a little shocked, this was the first time they had ever had a genuine conversation. "Might take it up too, the war fucked me up a little." Harry leaned his head back against the window, exhaling; Malfoy let out a weak laugh, "I think you deserve some calm after all you went through."
Draco rubbed a hand over his eyes, cursing himself for almost falling asleep again. He was cutting up hawthorn fruit, and it was taking bloody forever. Outside the door, he could hear the last bustle of the shop for the day, they’d be closing soon. Draco watched as he mindlessly cut up the fruit, it was something he’d done a million times now; but just because he could do it in his sleep, it doesn’t mean he should be nodding off with a knife in his hand.
He was walking back to the station with the rest of the school, he’d let Pansy and Blaise walk on ahead; he’d catch up with them on the train. Right now he just needed to feel the fresh air on his face, Draco just needed a moment alone before what would be a very hectic weekend waiting for him when he returned home.
Harry pushed Draco’s shirt off his shoulders, kissing down his own neck this time, his breathy kisses made Draco’s stomach pull. Harry let out a whimper against his chest, the sound going straight to his crotch, his skin heating up. Draco reached for Harry’s coat, carefully pulling it off, trying not to damage the stunning pocket watch.
“Fine. But you better have a damn good explanation for this.” He stalked out of the room, Harry followed him sheepishly.
“Now i’m going to talk. First off, I’m not shagging him, we just have been getting on better recently, for merlin's sake we live in each other's pockets Ron! He's changed a lot, but so have I…” He trailed off, he had changed a lot in the past few months. He came into Hogwarts hating Draco Malfoy more than anyone else on the entire planet, now he was not entirely straight and slowly becoming obsessed with his roommate; for the second time in his life.
That night when Harry got home the house was quiet. There was a note stuck on the cupboard where the teabags were kept that read
That startled a laugh out of Harry. He looked at her, slightly bewildered, eyes round and searching. There was no other way. He didn’t have it in him to come up with a plausible excuse, not when he’d slept so little and spent so long replaying one argument for the past twenty-four hours. “Malfoy told me not to come back. I mean, your son. Draco.” Harry frowned. “You know what your son’s name is.”
“Okay.” Malfoy paused for only a moment and then sat beside Harry. He left a respectful distance at first and then appeared to think better of it, scooting over just slightly. Harry felt the warmth of his body and leaned towards it.
“You’ll definitely wanna when you’re in bed, though.” Harry curled an arm around Malfoy. “Trust me, okay? We’ll get you to bed and I’ll tell Blighter to make sure you’ve got everything you need waiting on your bedside table for your hangover tomorrow.”
Harry frowned. He had turned away from Malfoy, pulling the dirty t-shirt over his head and dropping it onto the floor but he turned back slowly. Malfoy’s gaze flickered to Harry’s chest for a moment and then back up to his face. He steadfastly refused to look down again, his jaw set in a determined line. Eventually, he lifted his chin and pointed it to the ceiling. Harry shook his head.
“Yes, well, I’m a very selective person.” Draco said it easily, clearly delighted with himself that he got to say it. Harry shook his head and tugged on Draco’s arm a bit more, pulling him towards the kitchen door. As they passed every cauldron, Draco said goodbye to them. It was only once they were out of the kitchen and the door had closed behind them that the glittering edge of Draco’s mania appeared to wear off. He sagged a little, leaning into Harry’s side and pressed his face into Harry’s hair. He mumbled into it when he spoke. “I can’t really go to sleep.”
This time, Malfoy’s laugh was less bitter, instead skirting towards resignation. “That’s wonderful for me, then.” It made Harry frown and he was just about to ask what he meant when Malfoy straightened up and walked to a door not far from them. Harry had missed it. He could not understand why because the minute Malfoy touched the wall the door was there, gleaming wood, welcoming them. Malfoy pushed it open and said, “Come along, Potter.”
Malfoy, looking for all the world as if he had no earthly idea how this was his life, scowled even deeper. “You’re not meant to
Malfoy pressed his nose into Harry’s chest and sighed. “I’m going to hate me so much again in the morning,” he breathed out. Harry’s breath caught in his chest and then he lifted a hand to stroke through Malfoy’s hair. The other boy made a noise, a sharp inhale, and then he sagged against Harry.
Harry felt hot under the joint weight of his friend’s gazes, embarrassment making his neck warm. “We were talking about what she wanted to do next year and she told me that I clearly didn’t want her.” He scratched at his neck. “I tried to tell her she was wrong but it just didn’t go right. And she told me she thought I was stuck and she didn’t want to be. So....yeah.” Trailing off, Harry took a large gulp of wine before he looked across the table.
Malfoy’s face had been bright red, his whole neck a flush and Harry had looked at it and tasted it and he’d been walking on air ever since.
“Potter, if I have to listen to you complain for even five more minutes I am going to steal your wand, okay?” Malfoy leaned closer so that his face was directly in Harry’s line of view and he couldn’t focus on anything else but it’s sharp lines and points. He waited until Harry made eye contact and then Malfoy made a satisfied noise and started to talk again. “I am going to steal your wand and I will kill myself with it. I will murder myself and it will be so messy and you will definitely get arrested for it and all the evidence will stack up against you and you will go to prison. All of that, simply for not being able to be quiet for ten fucking minutes. It would be a shame, for yourself, and a shame for me. You understand?”
“Yeah. Yeah okay.” Ron didn’t move though, so neither did Harry. Instead he pressed his leg against Ron’s and sat there, staring into the fire, trying to comfort and be comforted, trying to hold onto the flicker of hope. Hermione had found her parents and was with them. There were just more steps in the process. They could do this, like they’d done everything before, like they’d always managed to. They could do this because they had always done things that seemed impossible.
,” Malfoy breathed out. He raised his hands to his face, digging his palms into his eyes, and then he looked straight at Harry. Harry felt the gaze like needles on his skin. “You can be upset about your parents, Potter. I’m not going to think less of you.”
“I’m happy if you’re changing,” he said, pouring whiskey slowly into the glass. “That’s all anyone ever asks for, right? New beginnings and the ability to transform.”
“Fine!” Harry said, throwing his hands in the air. “Fine! You don’t want me near you! But can you just listen to me? You’re going off on one and not listening to me.”
Harry did not think that was true and he thought Malfoy should know that. “That’s not true,” he said.
If he had thought about this ever happening, in a dream, Harry had expected it to feel like fireworks. He had expected the riotous explosion in his chest, the wave of emotion that would overtake him and make him feel like he was drowning. In his dreams, he would have expected it to feel like a bludger to the chest. It didn’t.
“I’m glad you don’t think I’m stupid,” Malfoy said, voice cool, “but I don’t actually need any external validation, thank you.”
“A friend,” Ginny said, almost sneering. She was gripping tightly to Harry’s hand. It was the same kind of punishment his heart was eeking out to him, a deathgrip that felt like it was going to wreck him. “You want a friend who you can kiss sometimes and not feel bad about it. I don’t want that, Harry. I’ve had enough of waiting around.”
“A job fair. He arranged one. For me.” Malfoy was still looking at him as if Harry had sprouted three heads. Harry lifted a hand, almost as if to check, and then ran it through his hair instead. Malfoy kept watching him. “It was really nice, actually. People don’t really do things like that for me and he’s not trying to press or whatever, I think he just wants me to find something to do with my time.”
“Yes,” Hermione snapped and then looked abashed. “Sorry. I’m just – do you think that something’s wrong?”
“That’s your problem. You’re not making your mind up.” Ron leaned over, shoulder against Harry’s, a warm weight. He was looking at him with huge eyes, a steady, weighted gaze. “You’re not an indecisive person.  I dunno why you’re doing it.”
Harry sighed back, half an imitation, half genuine. He took his own sip, tasting the wine and then another. The wine was a new thing, something that came about as a means to feeling more in control. “Let’s be proper grown ups,” they had all said, clustered around the breakfast bar after dinner, leaning into each other and enjoying the silence. That had meant dinner and dessert and wine and an attempt at talking about culture, which usually quickly descended as they all got merrier and bored with pretending. Still, a new thing or not, the wine was sticking around, fashioning itself into a new routine. Harry liked it. He wanted to be able to develop his own routines.
Harry shrugged, mustering a smile as he wandered over to where he had kicked off his shoes the night before and shoved his feet into them. “Yeah, I’m fine. Why wouldn’t I be?”
Harry looked at Ron instead of back at Hermione. Ron was leaning back in his chair, his arms folded, watching them. Harry recognised the look on his face from the hours that they had spent together playing chess. He was looking at the pieces in front of them, trying to anticipate their moves. His mouth was curved slightly. He was watching Harry just as intently as Hermione had been, but he wasn’t speaking now. He just looked like he was listening.
“Ginny and I decided to call it quits,” Harry said. He hadn’t meant to use that phrase but it was out of his mouth before he had considered it too deeply. He looked up from tracing around his glass to the matching expressions on his friend’s faces: surprise, concern, affection. It made his throat feel like it was closing over. “You don’t have to look so concerned.”
They did. Harry refused to let Draco say no to anything. He challenged him to races across the grounds, easily beating him which horrified Draco to no end. His face was red from exertion and his eyes were bright with competitiveness as he got into Harry’s face and accused him of cheating, loudly and at length.
For a moment, he couldn’t speak. He knew the Malfoy’s had been obscenely wealthy. He knew that they were
Draco looked a little stunned. His mouth was open and lax. It made him look gormless and it made Harry’s heart surge. Narcissa looked less surprised, but one eyebrow was still raised high. Harry shuffled, uncomfortable under the scrutiny.
? (Who had named an owl Herbert?) Hadn’t the Malfoy’s had a significant number of assets stripped in the form of reparations? It seemed impossible to pick one and Harry didn’t consciously try, just letting the words slip out. “Blighter?” he heard himself ask, voice weak.
He was never allowed to stay in the corner for very long. There was always someone tugging him forward, including him in conversation, asking his opinions, or trying to force food down him. Molly Weasley plied everybody with food and Bill and Fleur had apparently liberated a whole vineyard considering the amount of wine they brought with them. There were Irish coffees and brandies and port. There were presents exchanged and hushed remembrances of Fred and, shortly after, not so hushed remembrances. Hermione and Ron were caught kissing under mistletoe and Molly cried, while Arthur patted her back. Charlie kept talking about his partner in increasingly bizarre and outlandish stories that made Harry laugh so hard he hurt, before he eventually admitted that he meant his favourite dragon. It was wonderful.
“Yeah, I got it.” His reply was as soft and low as Draco’s question had been. It felt like they were whispering secrets in a crowded room, even though they were the only two on the grounds now. There was no need to whisper. They still did.
Harry nodded at him, stepping up onto the platform and hesitating only briefly before he sat beside him on the piano stool. Malfoy watched him carefully, a flint in the back of his grey eyes. “Everybody changes,” Harry said, his knee pressing against Malfoy’s. “Or everybody should change. I think — I mean, you know that I feel like the world has needed to change for a long time, but I reckon one of the ways we have to do that is by looking at ourselves first. I’m not the same person I was two years ago or a year ago. I don’t know if that’s a good thing or a bad thing all the time but if we’re going to ask other people to do it, we have to do it too.”
He made a noise in the back of his throat and then cleared it. There was no point feeling sorry for himself. This wasn’t about him.
“You’re filthy,” Malfoy announced one afternoon, meeting Harry at the gate. Harry was filthy: restlessness had settled under his skin, an itch that never seemed to abate, and he had taken Yolanda (Mrs Ormsby’s German shepherd) and went for a run in the countryside, not caring that it was raining or that the muck he kicked up as he ran covered him. He had bathed Yolanda, but hadn’t done the same for himself.
Harry scrubbed a hand over his face and sighed. “Fine. I don’t know whether to accept the Auror offer or not.”
. Once or twice, Narcissa shouted up at them and Draco would laugh down and try to soothe her and Harry would point his broom straight up and fly as high as he could.
Draco’s mind had another moment of brightness, this time to make him realize that they were both extremely dressed. Immediately, he moved his hands away from Harry’s hair and went all the way down his arms and then his hip, where he found the hem of his shirt and pulled it, accomplishing little to nothing to remove it.
“The pleasure was mine, Hermione. Thank you for your help” he said politely “Have a good day, Mr. Weasley” he had tried.
“I think we should give a try to this theory of yours before I get more anxious, if that’s even possible” Harry motioned to the stairs and started walking, taking his notes, and a small envelope Granger had brought him earlier, with him.
That castle was absurd. Why on earth had he ever considered the place to be beautiful? Had he done that? He didn’t remember. Draco intellectually knew he should ask for help, but his logical-thinking had ceased functioning for some time now. He had a single idea on his mind. He had to find the basement.
“What? Stop thinking nonsenses, Potter. How can a single person be so dumb? Of course I’m not pregnant” Draco rolled his eyes “And you are the doctor”
“For Merlin’s sake, just kill me already” he murmured to himself and Draco had to laugh. Well, the day had gotten better, undoubtedly. He had had a chance to meet his mother’s family house, he had found out Potter thought he was attractive, so far, so good.
“Sure, fire away” he explained the basics of the situation, respecting Draco’s privacy and concentrating on asking about something that could cause a healthy wizard to suffer from an inexplicable disease “Did you check the magic core?”
“I don’t recommend you do anything exhausting or physically demanding, but I see no reason why you couldn’t do simple stuff, at least until you get your treatment”
“Draco, Harry told me all about it. I’m so happy we are moving forward. You’ll see, you’ll be better in no time. Why are you so red, darling? Should I call Harry back?”
“I miss you too, Teds. I’m sorry I have been so busy, but I have a friend who is really ill and needs my help. I promise I will try to make some time for us and we will go play Quidditch to that hill you like or do whatever you want. Please, don’t cry”
Harry broke the kiss. He had to. Malfoy’s hand had been soaking and drops of water continued to roll down the neck of Harry’s shirt, making him shiver every time. Malfoy chased the shiver, pressing harder into Harry every time, but eventually it became too much. Eventually, Malfoy’s mouth on his became too much, overpowering every one of Harry’s senses and making him feel as if he was losing himself. Drawing back for breath, Harry blinked at Malfoy and then let go of the front of his jumper. It was wrinkled, completely ruined by the grip of Harry’s fist.
Finally, he cleared his throat. “Are you going to say something or are you really into staring now?”
Malfoy sighed and gestured to the gates. “They’ve been open for about ten minutes. We’ve been notified. Are you finished with your brooding?”
, but I can’t stay here and have to do that every single day for the next year or two. I can’t sit around and do nothing and watch George blow things up and talk about Fred like that and just have everyone say that it’s
Draco blinked at him several times, astonishment shining from his face. He stared at Harry, clearly searching for something although Harry wasn’t sure what. He just knew that Draco clearly must have decided he found it, because finally he swallowed and raised his own hands to cover Harry’s. “I don’t think that’s very appropriate,” he said, softly. “I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, Harry.”
Harry laughed again, though this time it was softer and more into himself. He curled his shoulders over the cup of tea in front of him and stared down at it. “That’s the single most boring thing you’ve ever said to me.”
Harry loved Ron so much it made him feel a bit ill. He leaned in to him and let that be his response.
When he slid out of the bed, Harry hesitated, staring around the room. He could hear the noise of Draco sleeping, the rise and fall of his chest in the corner of his eye. The room was messier than Harry had ever seen and he spent a few minutes searching for some paper and a quill.
Harry had come back to life so many times before, but this felt like an entirely different life he found himself in.
“Okay, you’re right, I was upset and I’m admitting it. It was very nice of you and I won’t do something like that again.”
Draco’s nostrils flared and his body shuddered. Harry could see the movement through his pyjamas. “Is that it?”
Pushing his hands into his trouser pockets, Harry scowled at the ground. He thought about arguing, but it felt kind of pointless. It was what he was known for. He was definitely not going to argue. “I think things through.”
“I’ll have written evidence that you attacked me, of course,” Harry said. He walked closer to Malfoy, who blinked in surprise, and then hastily covered it by looking away. They started to walk up the lane. “It’d be kind of sloppy.”
Hermione watched him with kind eyes. “Harry, we just thought it would be nice to talk all together.”
Ginny stared at him blankly and then narrowed her eyes. “But I don’t want to do that, Harry. I don’t
Malfoy groaned into Harry’s mouth and Harry grinned. He felt Malfoy smile back, the curve of his smile pressing against Harry’s mouth, and Harry pulled back to kiss along it, grinding down again.
“Ludicrous.” Malfoy lifted his chin and glanced at Harry once, from the corner of his eye. It seemed to make him decide to lift his chin even higher. Harry hated it. “There’s no point in lying, Potter, no one here is going to believe you anyway.”
Ron was true to his word and gathered information from Oblivaitors, hunting them down and flashing them smiles. Harry considered doing it too, leaning on his name and his history. He thought about walking into the office and saying, “My name is Harry Potter, I saved the world, I need your help.” The thought of it made his insides shift with unease but the idea of seeing Hermione looking like she had forever made him feel worse. He wanted to help. He
“Yes!” Ron looked like he was gearing up to get on a roll. “Based on not living here! It’s not my fault I don’t live here. I try and I try, but I can’t say no to my mum. You’ve all had her roast beef! It’s got its hooks into me and now I feel like I’m being punished for liking food.”
Today, it appeared as if Narcissa Malfoy had something she wished to discuss. She was sitting only slightly forward but watching him intently, the cup of tea floating by her elbow untouched. She waited until after Harry had drank some of his own before saying, “You will, of course, forgive me for asking, but I am curious about your returning visitations.”
The owl came a few days later, nipping into Harry’s room and out again. Harry grinned and stared down at the familiar handwriting, shoving a gingerbread cookie into his mouth as he opened it.
When the response came, it was early the next morning. Harry had fallen asleep in a curled up ball in the middle of the bed with the window open and the curtains not fully closed. Sunlight slithered in, cut-glass and bright, but it wouldn’t have woken him up yet if it wasn’t for Herbert. Harry blinked into wakefulness and grabbed for his glasses, staring at the owl in front of him.
Malfoy stopped walking and looked at him with the kind of expression that clearly said ‘I believe that a hippogriff has kicked you in the head multiple times.’ “No. With
” She sobbed again, huge sobs which wracked her whole body. Harry dropped the letter and folded Hermione close into him, running a hand up and down her back. He muttered words to her, words of comfort and love and reassurance and Hermione cried onto his shoulder.
Lavender scoffed and then studied him, bathed in shadows. Even from the relative safety of her dark hallway, he could see that she had changed. There was a scarf wrapped around half of her face. He thought it looked like a dark, gauzy material and she had twisted it around her in some kind of elegant pattern. He could tell she had a scar over one eye, bisecting her left eyebrow. His fingers twitched in sympathy and his stomach rolled (how could he have been so selfish not to check in, how could he have only cared about himself and very few people, how could  she look at him now) but Lavender just kept looking at him until she finally nodded.
Ron looked at Harry, askance. “I’m not admitting that at all.” He turned back to the display and sighed. “I should be happy they’re all out now. I told Hermione I wasn’t going to leave everything to the last minute this year.”
” Malfoy rolled his eyes and turned away. The robe he was wearing flared out as he dropped down from the platform the piano stood on and sat on the edge. His hands flat on the platform, he bent forward, staring down at his shoes and scowling. “That’s my whole fucking point, Potter.”
Malfoy stopped walking and, a moment later, Harry did too. He turned to look at the other boy, who had narrowed his eyes and looked torn between annoyed and amused. “Are you seriously trying to comfort me by saying house arrest isn’t all that bad, really, because you’re out in the real world being boring so obviously if I wasn’t locked up here I would be doing the same?”
“You can,” Ron said, now beside Harry and pressing their shoulders together. United. They were going to be together through this, too, like they always had been. “We’re here for you. I’ll ask at the Ministry — I’ll ask whatever you need. I know some of the Obliviators now.”
“I live to bore you,” Malfoy said grandly, sweeping a hand across the table. The cauldron nearly suffered for it and Malfoy sprang into action right away, clattering forward and stirring it, jumping around and throwing extra things into the cauldron. Harry watched him as he moved about the kitchen, a muttering whirlwind, and he felt almost calm.
“Maybe that’s what Molly says, but we know better.” Harry flashed Ron a grin, shoulder checking him as Ron pretended to be more put out than he was.
Harry grinned lopsidedly. It sounded like the exact kind of polite invitation he expected — something that Narcissa didn’t mean, but felt that she had to say. What else would she be able say after having tea with someone who had testified for her? Harry wondered if she would be relieved if he told her that he had no intentions of coming back, then decided not to. If she was going to be polite, he could be too. “Thanks,” he said instead.
“You’re an idiot. Come here.” Harry went easily. The gallery was long so it took him longer than he would have liked to reach Draco and then he sank down beside him. He tugged at the book in Draco’s hand and Draco relinquished it easily, but Harry returned it almost immediately. It was about the history of healing potions and it wasn’t that Harry didn’t think that was useful — it was just ridiculously boring and he would rather have plucked his eyes out than read it. Draco smiled fondly at him.
Stretching like a cat into the sunlight, he flipped onto his stomach and stared out the window. It was still early but he could hear the faint signs of London stirring outside.
Harry blinked wondrously and walked up the llane. As he walked, he thought about firelight on Draco’s pale hair and how cold his hands got and how easily he flushed. He pictured Malfoy’s eyes and thought about his hands in Harry’s hair and how their hips fit together.
“Honestly, Ron.” Hermione rolled her eyes. “He wrote each of us a letter to apologise for things in the war. He asked us not to tell you. It wasn’t long after you first went to visit, I think. I wrote back, but Ron didn’t.”
Herbert looked at him calmly and pointedly. Harry shrugged. “Look, she’s every right to not like Malfoy’s,” he said. Herbert turned his beak away. “Don’t be rude,” Harry found himself saying as he dashed off a return response.
He couldn’t hear her. Harry could hear only his frenzied heartbeat in his ears and the voice in his head that told him where to check for injuries. His wand was out and his blood was pounding, rushing through him, urging him on. He was casting diagnostic spells quickly and then Hermione said his name loud enough to break through the fog that had come over him.
Hermione looked at him with bright eyes, pride shining out of her face so obviously that Harry had to duck his head and consider his tea. He’d made it a bit too milky, he realised, but it was an adequate enough distractor — or so he thought anyway. When he looked back up, Hermione still had that look on her face and Ron had a variation of it too. It was slightly more restrained on Ron’s face but he leaned forward, thumping Harry hard on the shoulder.
Malfoy tilted his face back towards Harry, staring down at him with a deep wrinkle on his forehead. His eyes were huge, warm as steel melted down, and he reached out. Malfoy looked as shocked as Harry was when his fingers settled on Harry’s shoulder. Harry turned his head to look at it; Malfoy hesitated and then his hand smoothed over the shoulder over Harry’s t-shirt. He patted Harry’s shoulder and then said, “It’s my father’s birthday.”
Grinning, he said hello to Blighter and allowed himself to be led to the study yet again. It wasn’t quite as bad this time and, when he left, he was sent off with two boxes of cupcakes and without seeing Malfoy again.
Instantly, Malfoy stopped laughing. He pushed himself off from the banister and glared at Harry. “Do you really not understand English? It’s not a good time.”
The worst part was that he couldn’t go now, he thought. Draco was awake, probably, but Harry wasn’t sure. Maybe he had dashed the note off and then retired to bed. That seemed like something he would do.
They looked at each other, Harry glaring and Malfoy with a light in his eye that Harry didn’t understand until he tilted his head back and laughed. “You always make it too strong,” Malfoy said, moving to gather mugs. “You’re so easy. I knew that would make you decide not to do it.”
“You have poor eyesight, so no one can trust your judgement,” Malfoy said, grandly. He lapsed into silence almost immediately, twisting in the armchair so he was studying Harry. Harry tried not to flinch away from it, willing himself not to shift under Malfoy’s stare. “What makes you think I’ve changed?”
Malfoy sighed and shrugged. He looked unhappy. “Even if I told you yes, why would you believe me? I wouldn’t believe me, in your place. You’re practically the only person I see. I would tell you ‘yes’ just to make sure I’m not completely alone, wouldn’t I?”
“Look at me, Draco,” Harry said but he didn’t leave it to chance, or Draco’s bravery, or any hope that may have been fluttering in his heart. He reached out and placed two fingers gently under Draco’s pointed chin, turning his head to him. When they made eye contact, Harry could see that Draco’s eyes were wild, dark grey and roiling. His shoulders were tense and his eyes caught Harry’s then slid away. Harry stood and stared at him and said, “Please.”
Draco froze for a moment, his expression slate-clean and then it lit up. Harry watched him and he could see the sunrise inside him, the light from the knowledge of love illuminating him. He wondered if he’d looked like this but decided there was no way. Draco looked magnificent, resplendent and Harry grabbed the back of his neck and pulled him in to kiss him.
Harry thought about staring at the sky still, a spike of fear lancing through him. He couldn’t though. That was cowardly. He squeezed Draco’s fingers tighter and turned his head to look into Draco’s face. He looked worried, his eyes suddenly tight and distant. His face was still red from the flying and there was sweat gathering in the dip of his throat. Harry looked at it for a moment and then back at Draco’s face. He nodded.
section of the garden was just right for it. The ground rolled out beneath Harry’s feet, grass that was lush and green and carried out onto the horizon. There were stables not too far off. The sight of them nearly made Harry feel a bit ill. If he had to watch Malfoy show off by talking about his prize horses he was going to turn back and vomit in the rose bushes.
Harry’s smile was quicksilver and he jumped onto the broom. “No you don’t,” he said and then they were kicking off, heading higher, brooms pointed almost straight up. Harry’s heart surged and his chest expanded. There was a huge amount of space in his lungs and the air swept in, filling him up, making him bigger than he had been. The wind rushed by his ears and Harry could do nothing but shout with it, looping delightedly back until he was staring at Draco.
He followed Patrick into his office. He talked and he heard himself talk, asking questions. Patrick was
for a fact that you never said ‘hey, Harry, just as an FYI I’m writing to your friends sometimes, just for the laugh of it all.’”
“It isn’t different at all.” Harry opened the shower door. “Look, you really should leave now unless you’re planning on watching and then just stay but you know. You made it clear you weren’t.”
Malfoy did not lean forward. He simply stood there, staring at Harry, and Harry stared at him, his heart pounding, the crash of water loud in his ears. Time was not moving and then it was, Harry surging forward, pulling his hands out of his pockets to grab at Malfoy’s jumper and tug him down. Malfoy’s fingers became claws on the side of Harry’s face and then their lips met. It was awkward at first, too vicious, their teeth clacking. Harry hissed but it didn’t seem to matter because then they were kissing again, Malfoy’s mouth hot on his.
Draco nodded and turned his head to the side. Harry felt Draco’s eyes scanning his profile, felt how intently he was looking at him. He didn’t turn his own head. He kept looking straight up at the sky, holding Draco’s hand tightly, forcing air into his lungs.
“I’d be delighted to join you, Malfoy,” Harry said softly. Draco smiled, his eyes bright even though his mouth looked like an unsteady line. They collected the brooms and returned them, shoving at each other in the shed, pushing each other out of the way as they tramped into the kitchen. Blighter appeared immediately to dissuade them from cooking and took an order for dinner before ushering them away.
Harry turned his head, catching Hermione’s eye and then Ron’s. “Not really,” he said slowly. “He’s not bewitched me, if that’s what you mean. I’d think that’s a bit of a ridiculous suggestion considering I’ve been able to throw off an Imperius for a good number of years now.”
Better, until Harry exited the study to find Malfoy lounging against one of the walls. It was such a blatant display of eavesdropping that Harry actually paused and stared at him for a whole ten seconds before he threw his head back and laughed. Malfoy looked affronted and pushed himself off from the wall, scowling at Harry. Harry noticed he’d rolled the ends of his trousers and his sleeves up: he deliberately did not look for the Dark Mark.
The woman sits upright, she's trying not to show her worry by giving him a reassuring smile. She taps the stack of papers on his bed. “I’m going to show you some pictures, is that okay Harry?” She asks, Harry nods and she turns over the first picture.
Malfoys reaction surprised Harry a lot, he didn't complain or argue, he just nodded his head; kicking the back of his seat out from behind him. “Not so fast Mr Malfoy.” McGonagall started, gesturing for him to sit back down. “Both of you are to stay here until I return with a potion for Mr Malfoy's nose, you are going to talk about this, without hitting each other.” She stood up from her desk and left them alone in her office.
everyone tries to work out what the hell is wrong with harry, whos just trying to figure out who the blonde boy is
They evaluate for a moment, staring at each other, willing for someone else to just talk first. The lady with the pointy hat sits herself up, crossing her legs. She looks at him intently, and Harry can tell she's begging him to pretend whatever's going on is some kind of practical joke; she exhales sharply.
Clearly, the confusion on Harry’s face is obvious, because the boy stops laughing. He turns to the girl, silently asking her questions that he cannot answer. The girl gives an apologetic smile, glancing over to Harry. “Very funny Harry, but do you mind telling us what happened? We’re pretty worried about you.” She reaches forward to touch him on the shoulder again, but Harry flinches away. The girl looks hurt, she pulls her hand back and lets in rest on the red headed boy's knee.
“And yes, it is a guy, don’t you think that maybe i’m freaking out that it’s a boy too? Did you ever care to think that maybe I have no idea what’s going on? I don’t know how to explain what’s happening between me and him right now! What you saw was, look, he invited me to the Malfoy’s christmas ball and they have proper dancing and shit and I don't know how to dance at all.” Ron snickered, Harry shoved him gently. “So he was teaching me how to dance, we just had a moment, it’s happened before.”
The green lighter sat on his bedside table, almost mocking him, he had been doing something for years unknowingly making his childhood enemy go crazy. Draco was starting to feel the pleasure rising up in his groin, he was teetering right on the edge of his orgasm.
“You make me feel.” Draco shoved the last bottle into its case, the slam of the box closing echoing in the deathly quiet room. “And I don’t like it, I want it to stop. Now.”
That was true, he was an awful liar. He swallowed, his entire body felt like it was frozen in place. Having Potter leaning over him like this was making his stomach tug uncomfortably, god the other boy was so
Draco shuffled about in his lap, turning around to face Harry. “You think you can be quiet?” He quipped; Harry gestured to the rest of the circle. “I don’t think any of them are paying attention.” He pulls Draco flush into his lap, his legs on either side of Harry’s hips. He leaned forward to kiss the other boy, instantly slipping his tongue into Draco’s mouth. His hands reached down for Harry’s belt buckle, undoing it slowly, his fingers brushing against his stomach.
Harry walked into his room, ready to give Malfoy a piece of his mind. The sight he saw when he walked in was not one he was expecting.
"You know Malfoy, you're not as evil as people think you are." Harry turned his head to look at Malfoy, the boy flicked his cigarette out the window, his grey eyes darkening.
“You are both cleaning the trophy room this week, I will come get you both at eleven and I want to see some work done.” She said sternly, motioning for them to leave. Harry and Draco shuffled down to the trophy room in silence, buckets clattering together as they walked.
“I’d watch your mouth, Malfoy, one owl to my brother and I'll have your arse rotting in a cell for the rest of time.” Ron spat, crossing the room over to Draco, who stood up to his full height. “That’s enough Ron.” Harry placed a hand on Ron’s shoulder “we can talk about this privately.” Ron shoved his hand away, looking Draco up and down one last time.
Harry sighed, turning around to talk to Ginny again, she was standing a lot closer to him than he liked. “Ron wanted to speak to you about something, go see him.” Thankfully she didn’t stick around for long this time, disappearing as soon as she had told him what she needed too, not waiting for an answer. Harry breathed out, finally getting into the kitchens.
The dorm room door swung open, Potter marched in, sitting down on the windowsill opposite him. He stretched his hand out, Draco knew exactly what this meant.
He pulled open the door, his mood instantly dropping when he saw Malfoy sitting at the windowsill, and he was
Ron nodded, a large hand still cradled around the mug. He looked serious, eyes huge and assessing as he looked at Harry, head tilted to one side just slightly. “Then, mate, you gotta figure it out. If you want to do it, then you will. It’s just one of those things, right? If you think someone is worth it, you figure it out.” The words settled in the air and Harry let them wrap around him, focusing on them, on Ron’s deep, solemn tone of voice and the comforting atmosphere and then — then Ron said, “Can’t imagine why you’d think he’s worth it, of course, but I always thought you were a bit of a weirdo.”
“Well, I don’t love it either!” Ron said. “But I will. Because you’re Harry, and I’m Ron, and  you’re important to me and I want to be here for you.”
Smiling softly, Harry turned and cupped Draco’s face in his hands. “I know. But if you want to talk, I’m here.”
. Harry rarely got to see Draco’s face, slack with sleep, body completely without any tension. He used the pads of his fingertips to trace Draco’s face and found himself grinning as he smoothed a thumb over his eyebrows.
“A list of the things you think you’re stuck over. Then we can work on it.” Hermione was practically beaming now. “It’ll be a new project!”
Harry had laughed and loved it and Ron had just looked almost as panicked as he did now, staring at shelves of snow globes and baubles and decorative tea towels.
Hermione still held his hand, warm and clasped between hers, and chewed nervously on her bottom lip. Ron studied Harry calmly, his hand wrapped loosely around the stem of the wine glass. He looked tired and sad, but he gave Harry a half-smile.
They did race, the pace breakneck, Draco just behind Harry the whole way. The ground approached faster than Harry expected and he pulled up at the last moment; Draco’s reflexes were not quite as good and he ended up tumbling onto the grass. There was a thump and a groan but when Harry came over to him he just said, “I’m only winded.”
Draco was beautiful when he smiled like that. He kept smiling, cupping Harry’s face, pulling him into a kiss. “I love you too,” he said.  “I love you. I do. Even though you’re so stupid and I thought you’d ignore my note and I thought — I thought there was no way. Even though I thought you wouldn’t. I love you.”
