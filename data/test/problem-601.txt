“Yeah, I did notice. What does it look like to you?” Tonks asked, the answer already stuck firmly in her mind, only needing confirmation.
“I love you too, Hermione Granger,” Ron whispered before placing a gentle kiss on Hermione’s forehead. He was glad he finally got over his fight with Harry and got Hermione back. He couldn’t imagine a future without this wonderful woman by his side.
As he materialized again, the sight that met his eyes made him drop his usual expressionless mask.
“Harry, what the fuck are you
The owl who had hovered over the make-shift camp was sitting high in the tree that Remus was sitting against. Most everyone in the camp was asleep, though they all had extremely good hearing as well. Remus stood with his scrolled letter in his fist, scratching the bark of the tree to get the owl’s attention. When the curious barn owl gave a soft hoot, Remus coaxed it down with a gesture of his hand. The owl landed gently on his outstretched arm and gladly offered its leg, which indeed had a delivering strap on. Remus quickly attached the scroll and whispered the destination of the letter to the owl, which gave a hoot of understanding and took off into the night.
Ron had jokingly suggested that the DA should all simultaneously cast their Patronus, directing the protectors to gather around Dumbledore’s tomb, just in case. Harry and Hermione had both immediately jumped at the idea, and a DA meeting was being held that night to inform all of the members and get some last minute practice in for all of those students who hadn’t quite gotten the hang of the charm yet. Draco, having never attended a meeting, had never successfully casted a corporeal Patronus, so Harry was going to take him along, induct him into the DA, and teach him the charm.
“Ron and Hermione always send me food over the summer holidays; they know my aunt and uncle sometimes punish me by taking meals away. This summer was worse than usual. I think it’s because of the warning that the Order gave my uncle at the train station…He was furious. I was locked in my room right away, and he didn’t let me out to use to loo for three days. I wasn’t stupid enough to ask for food; I knew I’d get a thrashing if I did. I sent Hedwig to Ron and Hermione and told them what had happened; they sent along as much food as they could. It was mostly sweets and pies from Ron, and health foods from Hermione, but it was food nonetheless.”
After they had all finished breakfast, Harry, Draco and Ron helped Hermione lug all of the many boxes up to the library, where Hermione taught them a spell to magically locate any documents associated with Wool’s Orphanage. After hours of searching, they had a pile of documents, from the original building contract, to the bills of unpaid property taxes and the contracts of renting portions of the building out to make the payments.
“Dizzying dandelions,” Hermione snapped at the Fat Lady, who gave her a reproachful look before dutifully swinging forward to allow them entry. “Why would my reaction be so bad as to get us banned from the library, Harry? Who on earth are you dating?”
A few times Draco would just sit with a blank stare, not saying a word even when Harry tried to speak to him. Healer Smithson explained that he was going into a sort of trance as little snippets of his memory started to come back. It gave Harry hope, but he tried not to get too excited about it; it would be a long time before Draco’s full memory came back.
“Did he hurt you, Harry? I mean...I can’t even imagine what Draco would be feeling after regaining all of his memory and trying to associate it with the life he’s been living these past few months. He must be so confused, and he probably said some things he didn’t mean in his confusion.”
“Alright, Harry, Blaise; come to the centre of the room. The rest of you, please move all of the desks to the sides of the classroom and stay back.”
Remus blushed as Severus cleared his throat. Harry was beaming and couldn’t hold back any longer. “It’s also pretty awesome that I’m not an only child.”
Harry finished buttoning his shirt and pulled his robes on, grabbing his book bag from the end of his bed and following Draco out of the dungeon quarters. Remus and Severus were walking not too far behind them having a whispered conversation. Harry was trying not to listen in, but it was inevitable as their voices rose.
As if on cue, the door creaked open to admit the Potions Professor, who glanced around before catching sight of the boys and rolling his eyes. “Come, Harry. We have a busy day tomorrow, and I want you up by six to get ready for the interview,” said Severus as he reached over to right a picture that had ended up crooked on the wall.
Remus was completely exhausted. The Healers had tried everything they could to close Severus’ wounds, including Muggle techniques, but the curse simply reversed all of their efforts, and some of them had a further negative effect on the Potions Master. They were administering a steady stream of blood replenisher and cleaned the wounds every hour to keep infection away, but there was nothing else they could do.
“I’m sorry, Harry. I did not mean to shout at you, but you must understand that not informing the Order of your mistreatment was the most foolhardy thing you could have done. You would have been most likely placed with the Weasley’s at the Burrow, not at Grimmauld Place,” Severus explained. He felt bad for shouting at the boy, who seemed to crack so easily under pressure lately. It was as if this Harry was a completely separate person than the one Severus taught at Hogwarts. Where was his Gryffindor pride? His reckless behavior was still fully intact, though, apparently.
“I’m not going to reveal the specifics, just let the Order know we’ve received valuable information. Also, Lucius questioned Pettigrew a bit more before he took him to the Ministry, and he revealed a few more things, like where some of the Death Eater safe houses are, and Voldemort’s last known location. We kidnapped Wormtail from a temporary strong hold, which the Dark Lord was getting ready to abandon. Pettigrew unfortunately did not know for sure which of the safe houses Voldemort was taking over next,” Severus revealed. He had not told his son about the additional questioning, and feared that Harry was going to fly off the handle again about information being withheld from him. Thankfully, the boy simply nodded, relaxing after his brief panic.
“You know Dad would probably kill you if he heard you walking around referring to him as ‘Sev’ all the time. He only let’s Moony do that, and even that’s a rare occurrence.”
“I did not see fit to make a wish,” Severus replied as he sat back down, glaring at Remus as he sat on the arm of his chair. He smirked as Remus rolled his eyes and sat on the floor in front of his feet instead, leaning against his legs.
Harry had the urge to laugh, but refrained as he didn’t want to be cursed by Snape – who didn’t even have a wand to curse him with. Harry felt a great surge of sympathy; losing your wand was like losing an arm. “Don’t be ashamed; you were trying to do what was best for the Order. I guess it’s kind of like ‘you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours.’ I owe you my life, sir.”
Remus bit his lip as he looked searchingly at his husband. He was surprised with how calm Severus was with all of this, but he was also very glad for it. “I imagine it’s not very easy for you either, seeing Harry and I fall to pieces over someone you hated.”
“She’s right, you know. They’re only trying to protect us. If Tonks, an Auror who had much more training than any of us, can get kidnapped by the Death Eaters, than the Professors have the right to be concerned about our safety,” said Harry, though much less dramatically than Hermione had shouted her reprimand. After all, his parents were two of the people who had decided on taking these privileges away.
“And a good farewell we bid thee,” Harry answered the traditional saying. It paid off to be best friends with the smartest witch in their year, after all.
“Sorry, Molly. Old habits die hard,” Harry admitted with a sheepish smile before blowing gently on his steaming tea, taking a careful sip.
“Well then, I think there are only a few more questions I need to ask before I’ll be on my way to make my evaluation. It is clear that the both of you have thought long and hard about this decision, and there is no lack of love between the both of you. Though the Ministry is reluctant to let single parent adoptions take place, it is much different when the adoptee is nearly of age themselves, and the importance of this adoption does not seem rest on the fact that Harry needs a guardian, but it is symbolic and sentimental that it become official and legal that you become father and son.
“Oh, I suppose. You two are going to be more doting than even I will be,” Aurora teased as she stood with the solicitous help of Remus.
“What about the Elder wand, and how did you get the stone?”
Harry sighed heavily as he stood up slowly, only realizing as he tried to move how incredibly tired he really was. Occlumency really was a pain in the arse – and the head, Harry mused as he rubbed the bruised spot on his forehead where he’d met the cold stone floor. He tried to ignore his Potions Professor as he turned his back to him and pulled his shirt off over his head and reached for his pyjama top. He stumbled as his vision swam in his tired state, nearly sending him to the floor again. He felt a strong hand close over his bare arm and looked up to find Snape standing beside him.
He sinks into one of the plush armchairs as Harry turns to busy himself with the tea, reluctantly pouring one for Draco as well. His cane rests against the cupboard and Harry eyes it with reproach, as though its existence is some personal offence. Eschewing it, he does his best not to limp as he walks to the chair opposite Draco’s, depositing the tea before him with a perfunctory clatter. There’s a moment of awkward silence wherein Harry stares at the table and Draco looks at the wall.
“Could have,” Harry replies without the grace to act sheepish. “But it didn’t. You didn’t let it.”
“I know I have rather large shoes to fill,” Malfoy says, his voice uncharacteristically subdued. This draws a smattering of laughter, though his own tone does not sound amused. “I can’t promise to fill them, but I can promise to try. I’m relying on all of you to help me.”
“So. What happened with you and the Weasley girl?” It’s a hasty attempt to change the subject and Harry appreciates it, appreciates that he doesn’t have to form a reply to Draco’s sudden outburst of kindness.
He holds out a hand and she looks at it with confusion. After a moment, she places her wand in his palm, hesitant, unsure. Harry studies it. Rolls it between his fingers. Smiles, just a little, wondering what bit of magic had flowed from her in that dim and cluttered shop.
“Harry Potter.” Harry is aware that his own voice is cold and prickly and tense as though it is under some immense amount of strain. Spine rigid, he waits for the message to be relayed to McGonagall, but try as he might, he cannot swallow down the anger that stains his vision red. Perhaps she knows what he’s come to say. Perhaps she won’t allow him entrance at all and he’ll be left to stew in his irritation, an angry student all over again. Surprisingly, however, the gargoyle springs to the side, its flat expression showing its utter disdain for Harry’s scowling demeanour as he moves to stride up the stairs.
Harry gulped as he heard the hurt in Draco’s voice. He had not meant to push Draco away, but he couldn’t even stand to be in his own skin, let alone punish Draco with his presence. He finally looked up at the blonde as Draco squeezed his hand encouragingly. The Slytherin’s eyes were an icy blue-grey, swimming with concern and love. Harry felt his stomach squirm. How could Draco want to be anywhere near him?
Harry shook his head as he accepted the glass of water that Remus summoned for him. “No, I was definitely myself. I think it was just...a nightmare. My scar doesn’t hurt.”
“Hidden in his quarters, stunned but alive.JHi”
Severus stood up from the hearth and held a hand out to help Harry up. “I think that is enough for now. You can practice a bit on your own and read a few chapters before we begin blocking against mental penetration from an outside source. You’re doing very well already.”
Harry did as he was told, though thoroughly confused as to why. He didn’t have to wait long to find out as Draco thrashed around wildly, bile sliding down his chin as he convulsed violently. Harry couldn’t help the sob that escaped as he watched Draco have a seizure.
“No, Remus, you were too preoccupied. I’m the one who’s made a terrible mistake. I had that very bracelet for ten years after Lily’s death. I went to Potter Cottage after their funerals and when I saw the bracelet there, I took it. I thought Lily should have it, though, so I took it to her gravesite and buried it beside their headstone. I had the Horcrux and I let it
“First of all, you’re supposed to
“How did the lesson go, Harry?”
WARNING: Mentions of torture and nudity. Nothing too horrifying, I believe.
“It’s all so surreal...” Harry whispered, earning himself smiles from his parents as Draco kissed him gently on the cheek.
“Dad, please...” Harry said quietly, seeing the torn expression on Draco’s face. He knew the blonde wanted to have his father back, but he also knew that Severus had been the one to take care of him for so long.
“I’m still me, Ron; I’ve just been through quite a lot since the beginning of summer. The Death Eaters killed the very last members of my family; even if they weren’t the most loving people, they were still my only family. Severus saved my life, and I ended up saving his as well. There’s no way you can go through that and not form a bond with someone. I can’t ever fully explain my feelings towards Severus or Draco to you completely, but I love them both, and they’re my family now, along with Remus. Can’t you just be happy for me?”
“I think that’s enough confirmation of who you are, Peter. You said you had something important to tell us; go ahead,” Severus instructed, glancing back at Remus to makes sure he was writing everything down.
A few minutes passed in complete silence. Harry was still curled up against Severus, his head leaning on his chest, and Hermione had taken up one of the armchairs, her eyes red rimmed and wide with fear. The door to the dungeon quarters opened once more, and Draco made a direct line to Harry. When Draco saw him curled up next to Severus, his expression grim, he sat down beside him and started rubbing his back.
“Calm down, Harry me lad! We’ve taken the necessary precautions, we assure you,” Charlie said as he wrapped a heavily muscled arm around Harry’s shoulders and drug him over to one of the sofas.
Harry nodded, giving his stepfather a warm smile. “Yeah, everything’s fine. You’re right; you should probably head out before dark. Just be careful. You saw what happened to Dumbledore’s hand when he found the ring. Make absolutely sure all of the protections Voldemort set up around whatever it is are completely dismantled.”
Remus quirked an eyebrow in question, clearly not seeing the problem that Severus apparently had.
Harry sighed, running his hand through his messy hair. Moony had told him the same thing, and he knew everyone was just trying to do something nice for him. Perhaps he should just get over it and let them. After all it was just one day, and you only come of age once.
Myrtle had glistening, transparent tears trickling down her softly glowing cheeks. It was an odd sight to see a ghost cry. “That was part of the reason. The other part was that I wanted to haunt Olive Hornby for teasing me so much. I would be in my sixties if I hadn’t died so many long years ago. In all this time, I’ve learned that it’s better to pass on without knowing then be stuck for an eternity in a place you can never truly be a part of again.”
“What were you thinking of?” Harry asked quietly as the people around them went back to their own practicing.
As Harry drew closer to the small statuette, he finally felt what he had been waiting for. A kind of thick, oily feeling permeated the air around the griffin, clearly much darker than any other item in the shop. As he stood right in front of the statuette, Harry had to bite his lip and stifle his gasp as his scar gave a painful twinge and continued to burn. There was no doubt; this was it.
Severus glared and took the glasses back, tapping them with his wand and transfiguring them to Harry’s instructions. “Better?”
Severus just nodded appreciatively as he watched the Matron obsess over the bed and straighten out the different potions on the bedside table. Just then, the infirmary doors opened and a stretcher floated it, directed by Abigail, who walked slowly behind it. She smiled lightly at Severus as she passed him and lined Draco’s stretcher up with the bed so he could be moved over.
“But who would he have murdered at Hogwarts to be able to make a Horcrux? I mean, wouldn’t a student’s death be a little suspicious?” he asked, looking mainly at Harry.
Severus turned towards Remus and grasped the werewolf’s hand in his own. “I know this is a lot to ask – too much – but I think this is the best option. Black hasn’t been beyond the veil for very long; he’ll be the easiest to convince, we won’t have to waste as much time giving him a rundown of the time he’s missed, and because he’s not so far beyond the veil, I think he’d have the best chance of being able to handle physical objects on this side of the veil. Trust me when I say that I’ve been going back and forth about this for some time. This wasn’t a recent idea. This is the best shot we’ve got, Remus. I know it will be…highly emotional and uncomfortable, but I will be here by your side through everything, I promise.”
“Exactly! Just because we’re sixteen and gay, doesn’t mean our minds revolve around sex! Hell, we haven’t even done it yet!” Harry yelled in frustration blushing to the roots of his hair as Molly entered the room to investigate all of the yelling.
Harry shrugged as he rolled his wand back and forth across the wood surface of the table in an annoyed fashion. “I guess, just remember that all of this is included in the Oath alright?”
“We’ve talked about this…I don’t want to go into this without you either, but it would throw off the entire battle plan. I’ll have Dad protecting me. I’ll see you when we get back, I promise. We’ll both be back, ok?” Harry assured his boyfriend, most definitely not feeling so confident in his own words. He was utterly terrified to the point of numbness, but he would not let it show. He needed to be strong for Draco and the rest of his family.
Draco had made his way over to Harry, who had fallen to the floor beside Severus’ cot, tears streaming down his cheeks as he sobbed over and over again to save his Dad, he couldn’t lose anyone else, it was all his fault.
with?” Ron asked from his position of standing beside the door, almost like he was making sure he had a quick escape if he needed one.
Harry huffed in annoyance. Why had he not been told about this in the first place? Now he was simply afraid to think at all, paranoid that thinking about flowers could somehow lead to a memory about his mum because her name was Lily. It was more than disconcerting, it was downright infuriating. “Well I’m glad
“Well, it just so happens that Professor Dumbledore made me lower my requirement scores for my N.E.W.T.s Potions class because so many students got less than an O on their O.W.L.s that I would have a class consisting of exactly four sixth years. Apparently that is unacceptable, so I had to lower my score requirements in order to obtain a larger class. So, you’re in luck, Potter. Welcome to sixth year N.E.W.T. level Potions.”
“Severus, what’s going on?” Remus asked, feeling that same surge of anger he felt before when his husband had been keeping things from him. Only when he saw the white handkerchief in Severus’ hand and Harry’s cloak upon the table did he realize what was going on. “Oh!”
“It’s a diversion. They’re trying to draw extra security to Diagon Alley in order to slacken security somewhere else. I mean, security in the Alley is already pretty tight after the two attacks that happened there, but I think they’re really trying to draw attention away from something else. They’re planning something big,” George said.
“Your wand is a conduit for your magic.” He points at the length of willow she’s clutching in her hand. “Without that conduit, the magic has to flow from you. It didn’t hurt when we were young; back then, we were an excess of magic just waiting to burst out. But when you use it consciously—it takes its toll. Your hand will feel fine within the hour. Intuitive magic isn’t for more intricate spellwork; the more magic you do, the more damage you do too. I will say—your intuition is rather creative. Most simply go for the redirect. You completely removed the Sneakoscope from its trajectory and made it appear elsewhere. I’m—very impressed.”
“We meet again.” The morning has not yet begun to break through the black of night, but they have both entered the grounds, breathing puffs of steam into the dark sky. Draco’s voice is dry, quiet, and still it makes Harry flinch and shrink against the wall. He’s never been jumpy. He chooses not to think about what this sudden startle reflex means.
“Right. Well.” Harry stands, stiff, holding his hand out until his cane smacks against his palm. He’s tried. He can say truthfully now that he’s tried to have a conversation with Draco, to put the past in the past, to act like adults. He can meet his eventual scolding from McGonagall with this very example of his attempt to reconcile with Malfoy. After depositing his teacup, he makes for the door, but turns before exiting.
“Now, Miss Baker. Please get out of my office.” Her face falls for a moment before she sneaks a glance at the clock and manages a look of chagrin even under the weight of her smile. “I would like to get some sleep before tomorrow.”
Harry drinks. Firewhisky scorches his throat and brings heat to his cheeks and he thinks, ruefully, that perhaps McGonagall was right.
Harry is flush with firewhisky and anticipation.
They lapse into strained silence once more, their usual twilight boldness unable to help them now. Harry finds himself tapping on the wood of his cane, tapping his other fingers against his leg, looking everywhere except at the pale face which considers him from above the cauldron.
***************************
“It was… an object.” Draco’s voice is halting, uncertain, none of his customary arrogance to be found. Harry draws in a breath. “Similar to the one that took your leg. We were investigating and I grew--too comfortable. I looked away for a moment.” His fists clench at his sides, knuckles tense and white beneath ivory skin. Harry finds himself mirroring the pose, his hand going numb as it grips the wooden handle of his cane.
Severus hated to admit it, but the cake was actually quite delicious. He forced himself to take small, even bites. “Do not concern yourself, Harry. I am not exactly known for celebrating my birthday. In fact, this is the first time since my Hogwarts years that anyone besides Albus has made any sort of fuss about it.”
It was a free period already, and because of his grounding, Harry made his way down to the dungeons to spend the period in his room, revising for the test he had in Potions on Thursday. He sat his book bag heavily on the couch, pulling out his Potions book to take to his room. When he turned to walk down the hall he felt his heart jump in his throat as he drew his wand and brandished it.
Harry had always thought of his father as invincible, untouchable. Even before the man became his father, he never thought anything could touch Snape. Despite all he had been through with Voldemort, Snape still managed to live on and stay strong. The thought of something as mundane as a boulder taking the man’s life angered Harry. How dare fate cheat him like that? If Severus Snape was going to die, it had better be in an epic battle for his life, a harrowing tale that would be retold time and again for a hundred years or more. Death by a bit of falling stone? Not for Severus Snape!
Shocked into silence, Severus looked around the table to confirm what Dumbledore had said. Remus looked like this information was nothing new, but Tonks had an incredulous expression on her face as she gaped at Snape. That pretty much confirmed it all. “You cannot be serious. I was the
When Hermione came into the room, looking all the part of a worried mother hen searching out her injured chick, Harry felt the last of his resolve break free again. He didn’t bother to hide the anguish on his face, because he knew he’d never be able to fool Hermione.
Harry shrugged nonchalantly, never really having given the Potion Professor’s study habits any thought before. “I just thought it was because he was really good at potions, so it was easy for him,” Harry answered truthfully.
Severus pulled away from his husband and took a deep breath, pulling himself back together before their very eyes. He stood taller, and his face showed much less emotion. “I want to see him.”
Dobby appeared then, hovering a tray of warm soup, bread, and pumpkin juice over to Harry, who looked like he’d rather climb under a rock and die than eat anything.
“Mm, I should hope so, as the man is simply refusing to say anything about where he’s been disappearing to these past few months. Do remind me where you’ll be that day so that I do not worry about you not coming home straight away,” Severus instructed his son, ignoring the few surprised looks he received from the students sitting around the newly formed quartet.
Severus had no doubt that Molly was not exactly thrilled to see him again, but his decorum stopped him from commenting on that fact. “The pleasure is mine, Molly. Please, everyone take a seat. Dinner should be arriving shortly.”
“Need I remind you that Harry Potter is my
“Well if you would have told me to ease you out, I would have! Besides, if it’s Voldemort or another enemy in my head, I won’t give two shites about hurling them out physically,” said Harry, shrugging indifferently.
“Oh and how could I possibly do that?” Draco asked, his tone sceptical and his expression slightly confused. What on earth was Harry talking about?
“The Dark Lord was speaking of sacrifice. He said he could sacrifice one if it meant saving the others,” Peter said quietly, his eyes staring unnervingly into Harry’s beryl emerald eyes.
This time, Mrs. Luther was staring at Harry, a slightly shocked look on her face as her quill hung limp in her hand. It was another few seconds before she snapped out of her reverie and started scrawling on her parchment once more. When she looked up, her smile was wider and warmer than it had been before.
“Oh, Ronnie, you know that’s not going to happen. Harry is still your best friend; he just has other people in his life now that take up more of his attention that you were used to having on you. He hasn’t replaced you at all. You’ve essentially replaced yourself by displaying to Harry that you don’t accept who he is now. If you want Harry to treat you as his best friend once more, then you have to start
“Go to bed, both of you,” Severus said, pointing Harry towards his bedroom and Draco towards the door to their quarters.
Harry pushed the rest of his food away as he turned in his seat to look at Snape, who was facing the sink still and had his back to Harry. His head was hung slightly and his arms were stretched out on either side of him, resting on the counter in front of him. The man looked worn out and it made Harry’s gut squirm with what he supposed was pity. “Still no news on where he is, then?” Harry asked of Malfoy, though from what Snape had just said he thought he already knew the answer.
“Good, good. Well then, I have another memory to show you, but this time it is not my own. I do not know if you are aware, but the Headmaster’s portraits all around this room have retained their memories from when they were alive, as well as what they continue to see as portraits. Taking advantage of this, I extracted a memory from my predecessor, Armando Dippet, that I think you’ll find quite fascinating. There is another memory mixed in as well, to show the things that Professor Dippet did not see, but are of the same event. I retrieved those from dear old Phineas,” said Dumbledore, his smile gentle and his eyes twinkling as ever.
“When I was a baby and Voldemort attacked me, his failed Killing Curse ‘marked me as his equal’, unwittingly transferring some of his powers to me. When this happened, it formed a sort of link between us, a mental connection of sorts. He had no idea of this connection, as it’s mostly one-way, and never knew I was seeing into his mind in my sleep, feeling his strongest emotions at random times, until last year when he was possessing his pet snake Nagini. She attacked Ron Weasley’s dad, and I was inside the snake’s mind
“What is it, Tom?” Dumbledore asked, though he had a feeling he knew what it was, from the report about Billy Stubbs’ rabbit.
“Not to worry, love. Why aren’t you cooped up in the library with the rest of the lot? Not that I’m sure you couldn’t use the break, mind you. Whatever it is you’ve all been searching for, you’ve been at it for quite a long time!”
Lucius looked stunned as he looked between his son and the Headmaster, not sure of what he was hearing. “The Ministry would be willing to make this deal?”
“Good news then, Severus?” Professor Sprout asked from over her knitting needles, pausing at the smile on Severus’ face.
take the reins now!”
“Six O.W.L.s…Not too bad, though I can’t move on to Auror required courses now,” Harry said as he refolded the parchment and slipped it back into its envelope.
Just as Harry expected, Severus was waiting in the sitting room for him, looking thunderous and ready to scream for hours. Harry just wanted to go to bed and drown in his own misery, but he doubted he’d get off so easily. He didn’t care if his father grounded him for life; there was no reason to leave his room anymore anyways.
Down in the dungeons, Harry, Draco, Severus, Remus, and Hermione all sat in front of the fire, sipping eggnog and relaxing after a fun and eventful day. Hermione was curled up with her book beside the fire, Harry’s blanket wrapped around her shoulders. Harry and Draco were playing a game of wizard’s chess with the new board Remus had given Draco. Harry was losing badly. Remus and Severus sat together on the couch, watching the chess game commence as the fire warmed them.
Harry took a deep breath and retook his seat across from the Headmaster. If this was it, the last of the secrets, then Harry could learn to let it go. “Yes, sir. I’m ready.”
“Dad...”
“Unscathed? Draco, when you showed up here with Dumbledore you had bruises and cuts all over you, not to mention you were starved and obviously emotionally drained. Merlin only knows what else was wrong with you that you were keeping from everyone. If it wasn’t for Dumbledore’s trust in you and his impersonal healing spells, Snape would have found out for sure. I thought Gryffindors were the foolishly stubborn ones, not Slytherins!”
The only fireplace in the infirmary was in Madam Pomfrey’s office, and she received quite a fright when Severus stepped out of her floo, Harry following close behind.
Bellatrix pouted and drug a long, sharp nail across Harry’s cheek, drawing blood as she dug her nail in. “Our Lord never said anything about not harming him, though. What’s a little blood, eh? His blood is no longer a safe-haven for him. The only person who shares his blood now is our Master himself,” Bellatrix cackled, slashing Harry’s other cheek with her nail as well.
“Yeah, I will,” Harry replied as he and Draco headed down to the dungeons, while Ron and Hermione entered the Great Hall for dinner.
Draco shook himself out of his reverie as Professor McGonagall shouted across the classroom. His heart jumped into his throat as the head he was staring at before turned, and bright green eyes met his. They looked completely haunted and beyond exhausted. He swallowed as he tore his gaze away and looked up at McGongall, who had moved to stand in front of him.
Draco looked pleadingly at his godfather, hoping the man would pick up his line of thinking and insist that Harry go back to sleep. He was unsuccessful, however, as Severus sighed and nodded for Harry to join them. Apparently the Potions Professor had mistaken Draco’s pleading look to deny Harry, for one to
With his eyes wide and his mouth hanging open stupidly, Draco stared at Harry for long seconds before he realized Harry was pointing his wand at him. One glance into Harry’s eyes and Draco could read the Obliviation spell forming on the tip of his tongue. He quickly pulled up his blocks and cast a shield charm around himself, glaring balefully at the Gryffindor. “Bloody hell, Potter! You were going to
Severus’ eyebrows disappeared into his hair as Remus choked on a sip of tea beside him. To be quite honest, Severus had never really thought about having any more children. He’d never seen himself as a father before, and even taking care of a teenager had its trying moments, granted that the teen
“The prat, of course I’m still going to be there after classes end every day. I just got frustrated with his mood swings when I was only trying to help him,” Harry snapped, feeling the indignation of before when Draco had gone off on him for simply helping him to cut his chicken.
Harry laughed and hugged his father tighter to himself. Merlin, how he’d missed him. “I was so scared that you’d never come back. I can’t lose you, Dad,” Harry whispered, trying to fight back his emotions. He had cried enough for his father; he was ok now, there was nothing to be upset over. But every time he thought about the fear and worry he felt while waiting to hear how Severus was doing, it felt like a hand was squeezing his heart.
“Uh, sure, alright. Am I going to take that Oath now?” Draco asked nervously, glancing back and forth between the two older men, taking in Harry every once in a while as well. He had never seen Snape so angry before, and he had seen Snape plenty angry on plenty of occasions to compare it to. He was scared pretty thoroughly.
After Harry had woken everyone, they all trooped up to the Head office to floo back to Headquarters. Professor McGonagall was there shuffling stacks of parchment around on her desk, looking as though she hadn’t slept in a few days herself.
What exactly did it mean? It didn’t really seem appropriate for his parents’ graves at all.
Severus pinched the bridge of his nose, feeling ten times more exhausted than he had when he first stepped foot in the infirmary that morning. He knew Harry was only trying to protect Draco, but his increased worry made him want to shake the truth out of the damnable Gryffindor. He’d get it out of one of them eventually; he just had to continue to be patient. “Alright, Potter, you don’t have to tell me – right now, at least. Ms. Granger, I’m going to need to see this book you found and all of your notes before we go trying anything. Poppy, is Harry free to leave?”
“How do we destroy them? We’ve searched every book we can find, and Hermione has come up with a few theories, but we’re afraid to test them in case she’s wrong.”
Struggling down the hall towards the library, he realized he would soon have to succumb to the need for food and water. The few things he had managed to scrounge for right after the break-out were not enough to sustain even the frailest of infants, let alone a middle aged man who had been denied sustenance for so long.
The Healer frowned as he moved her wand in an arch over Draco’s forehead, watching as a thin blue line traced through his hair and settled near his left ear.
It took another three torturous, exhausting, frustrating weeks to research and learn the method of Legilimency Harry needed to help awaken Draco. What with the Oath to keep Draco’s sensitive memory to himself, Harry had to do much of it on his own so that no one else saw or found out about the horrible memory.
Draco sat back down across from Harry and slumped in his seat, feeling a little defeated by Harry’s quick thinking. “That’s the hard part. It’ll take practice and a bit of getting used to, but once you get it down, it becomes much easier. Snape has tried giving you menial tasks while blocking, correct? It’s just like that, but you never let it down, even in your sleep.”
Draco chuckled and hugged his father once more, glad that he hadn’t been forced to give the man up. He vowed to make sure his father got through this war, so that they would have time to rebuild a proper father-son relationship.
Harry shrugged as he slumped down in the arm chair across from the couch. He watched Draco read for a few seconds before turning back to Snape. “I’m just worried about him, sir. I know he had come to depend a lot on Sirius during the full moon and he’s probably feeling terribly lonely without him. I just don’t know what to do to help, or if there’s even anything I
“People are finally realizing what a bigot Fudge has been. No matter how many stories Skeeter put out there that you were crazy, Harry, the Wizarding World has got no choice but to believe everything you said last year now,” Hermione said with quite a smug smile as she spread jam over a warm piece of toast.
your family name, and
Draco sat down on his bed, his back leaning against the headboard as he slumped elegantly. Only Draco could pull the look off. Harry sat at the foot of the bed, a respectful distance from the blonde, but not too far away either. Hermione took the desk chair, looking awkward and out of place as she studied the nails on her left hand.
Draco looked sceptical for a few more seconds before sighing, his shoulders dropping as he took in Harry’s honest expression. Maybe he had overreacted, just a little bit. “I’m sorry; I guess I just got really jealous when I saw her touching you. I don’t like other people touching you that way.”
“Visitors! Oh, it’s been ages since anyone has come to see poor, dead Myrtle. Who’s come to see me now? Oh…it’s you,” the opaque, misty-eyed girl pouted as she spotted Ron and the DADA Professor.
Severus and Remus were especially worried about their son and godson, on Severus’ part. They were both in grave danger, should anything happen to the wards protecting the Quidditch pitch or surrounding grounds. The weakest spot was the Forbidden Forest, in which the students would be allowed to travel once a week to work on their Potions project. Severus considered exempting Harry and Draco from the assignment, but Dumbledore had vetoed the idea. Severus was not happy with the Headmaster at all.
“Harry, it’s not safe. Please, go back down to the dungeons and wait there. I’ll send back information as soon as I can,” Remus said as he stepped onto the ever-spiralling steps that led to the door of the Head’s office. Harry was right there with him, following him as he rushed to the hearth.
“I’ve called you all here this morning because we have an emergency situation on our hands. I am sure most, if not all of you, have noticed the disturbances in the castle as of late. These strange occurrences have been analysed and it is of the opinion of the Headmaster and all four Heads of House that the castle must be evacuated in order to strip and reapply the ancient wards that protect this school.”
All Harry can do is splutter indignantly. His mouth refuses to form a single coherent word.
(See the end of the chapter for
A sigh. Harry folds his arms across his chest, leans back against the desk, and resigns himself to a rather unproductive period.
“Of course,” she says airily, which infuriates him all the more. Her tone is rational, and if it had been anyone but Luna speaking, he would say that tone sounds patronising. “I’m mistaken, Harry. It happens from time to time.”
“State your name.” The gargoyle sounds bored, tired, as though guarding the spiral staircase has become more a chore than a duty.
I'm sorry!!!! Don't hate me.
“Oh, Harry. Forgot to tell you.” Ron’s speech comes hastily as Hermione shoots him a look, and his face is almost as red as his hair. “We’ve made a breakthrough in the Belfort case.”
“You saved me, too.” The words are out before Harry can process what he’s saying, before he can swallow the sentence. He can feel his skin flush, russet growing darker under the candlelight which refuses to dim. Now the words come pouring out, the alcohol lubricating his tongue, words spilling over and burning like bile. “When—when it happened. You could’ve gone to investigate the object. Let Dippet see to me. But you didn’t. You tried, I remember, tried to fix…”
Moments later, Harry bids Neville farewell and makes his way toward Malfoy’s classroom, his heart hammering in his throat, nervous for some reason he refuses to name.
***************************
a bit petulant, but I know Draco’s done nothing to endear himself to you.” Not hurt, then, though of course she’ll get her scolding in. Harry has to stifle a smile at that. It’s like they’re in school again and she’s chiding him for not doing his potions assignments or for teasing a first-year. Perhaps he's still a child after all.
They speak a bit longer, making plans to have drinks in Hogsmeade at the end of the week. Just as they begin saying their goodbyes, Ron’s head appears in the hearth, distorted by glowing light.
“I wish Professor Binns would never have updated his lesson plans,” he manages wryly, drawing nervous chuckles from a few students. For this moment, they look at him not as their annoying professor who makes bad jokes and assigns too much homework, but as the legend their parents told them as bedtime stories whispered by candlelight, the one who defeated the Dark Lord, the Boy Who Lived. He hates it. His mood fouls and he makes some passable attempt not to show it on his face. It isn’t their fault, after all.
With a blur of motion, Harry whips the Sneakoscope at her, sharp eyes watching her face as she first realises what’s happening and then reacts. Her pupils dilate, nostrils flare, and with an audible pop, the Sneakoscope disappears, reappearing a moment later with a quiet rattle atop Harry’s desk. He laughs loudly, leaning back in the chair with an impressed grin wide across his mouth.
“Same as you, I’d imagine.” His voice sounds mildly amused and Harry laughs, humourless, his hand flexing against the cold cane that rests cruelly in his grasp. “Can’t sleep. Nightmares. Pain.”
***************************
“And finally, an introduction must be made. As most of you have undoubtedly heard, Professor Flitwick has taken ill and will be unable to teach for some time. This term, Charms will be taught by Draco Malfoy.” Her tone is blunt; she invites no argument, and Harry is sure that this is directed at the professors as much as the students. At once the Great Hall erupts in murmured conversation, a hush that evolves into a roar, growing in volume until Draco himself stands to address the crowd of students.
Snow dusts the tops of the trees. Flurries gust flakes of snow into the students’ hair and they laugh, sending packed balls of ice flying toward each other near the frozen lake. Harry smiles as he watches them, his breath fogging the window, tea forgotten in his hand. Shrieks and curses batter against the glass. It’s early for snow, but no one seems to mind the chill, the ice, the crisp morning air that takes their breath away. He finds himself wondering what the giant squid does during the freeze. Does he hibernate below the glassy surface of ice? Does his magic keep him alive despite the frigid temperatures?
“You can’t tell anyone about this. Not your friends, your classmates, your teachers. It’s something we don’t teach at Hogwarts — something that not everyone can learn. I’m not even promising that the four of you will be successful.” They watch him with something approaching awe and he clears his throat awkwardly, shifting in his chair. “Wandless magic. I like to call it intuitive magic. It saved my life several times when I was with the Ministry.”
“A pretty trick to endear myself to the students.” As though merely thinking his name had summoned him, Malfoy emerges, a cauldron clutched in his hands. Harry’s mouth snaps shut. “I’m sure that any of them who know my name don’t think of me too fondly.”
Again... please don't hate me!
The figure is tall. Slim. Fair. An expensive-looking black suit fits snugly against the lean body which lopes gracefully beside McGonagall. Pale hair pulled back at the nape of a paler neck. A flash of a haughty smile. Just a glimpse of the right side of the newcomer’s face has Harry’s heart pounding in some strange tattoo of anger-inducing familiarity. Neville’s voice echoes with the same righteous indignation which bubbles like firewhisky in Harry’s chest.
“I—what?” He echoes himself, but this time it is incredulous, as though Luna has begun crowing like a rooster, as though she’s suddenly provided him with proof of the Crumple-Horned Snorkack’s existence. He feels that he should be somewhat offended, though he isn’t sure why, and he folds his arms over his chest like he's afraid she might be looking directly into him. “I’d think you’d know as well as anyone I’m done—meeting anyone. For the time being.”
“To be fair,” Ron points out, even as Harry and Neville shake their heads. “I don’t think anyone other than you knows the, er, mining policies. They probably didn’t think it was important.”
“For the record, mate, I’m fully on your side here. Draco? Teaching kids? Terrible bloody idea, if you ask me. A Malfoy’s a Malfoy, and—“
“Yeah. Similar.” Harry’s head spins in the silence which settles over them like a fine mist. He knows he should stop drinking but he drinks anyway, his fingers trembling against the sweating flagon of ale. Mirroring him, Draco drinks even longer, as if to steady his shoulders which are already unwavering, always more stable than Harry can hope to be. Harry finds himself wondering what’s happened since the war to lend him this calm, this unflappable ease that is so at odds with the grandiose, pureblood pride which had possessed him at Hogwarts.
“Morning,” Harry says, soft and gentle. The mood changes quickly; thestrals swarm him with coos of excitement, battering him in their attempt to get to the meat they can smell in the bag dangling at his side. A foal nips at his hand and he laughs, reminded painfully of Hedwig, of the way she used to peck at his hands when he held food near without surrendering it. He scatters the meat about, trying his best to be fair with its distribution, and he smiles sadly as he watches them pick at the garish red scraps. Tentative, he holds a piece out for the foal, watches as she sniffs and then gingerly removes the meat from his hand.
Her reasonable tone sends him over the edge. He stands, turns, lets the door slam behind him. As he storms down the hallway he can hear the gargoyle making snide remarks, but they are lost in the chaos of his thoughts.
Harry fights the smile that flickers on his lips, remembering how frustrated he’d gotten, sitting in the dark and willing reality to bend to his whims. He’s not yet told them the physical toll that intuitive magic can take; he’s not yet explained that wrapping your willpower around something and forcing it to do your bidding is more than just flicking a wand and muttering a spell. He wants them to remember. Remember the days when they were children, before Hogwarts, when their magic ebbed and flowed and pulsated like a living thing.
“I can’t do it.” Finally she speaks, dark gaze settling on his own. “I’ve tried and tried but I can’t make it happen. I sit in my bed and I try to make my books levitate, or I try to Summon things without my wand, and I just can’t do it. It’s infuriating!”
“Dippet couldn’t fix a leaking cauldron.” His voice is harsh and his hand flexes around the flagon, a pale fist as tense as the pale jaw which works above it. “I don’t know much about the curses on these objects. But I knew enough. Enough to stop the bleeding… To stop—well. To get you to St. Mungo’s. Besides, Dippet was too busy shouting to help.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry whispers, loud as the wind dies and the air grows still. Draco’s gaze flickers, unreadable, and he turns away toward the door.
Harry listens to Neville prattling on about Quidditch and the bets he may or may not have made with some of the professors, interjecting his own projections and musings here and there.
Tension snaps between them, almost tangible, a thread of common ground as fragile and taut as a bowstring.
in which it's Draco who extends an olive branch.
She beams at him, as though he couldn’t have offered her any higher praise.
“You’ve met someone.” Her tone brooks no argument. But Harry argues anyway.
“Did you hear?” Anxiety thrills through Neville’s gentle voice, gilded with excitement, and he places his hands on Harry’s desk as though imparting some vital news. Harry’s only response is an uptick of his brows. “Flitwick’s retiring. Health reasons. Rumour is that McGonagall has already chosen his replacement.”
“The first years are really surprising me,” Neville’s saying, nodding into his pudding. “Most of the students don’t care at all about growing shrivelfig but this lot really seems to be catching on.”
Both are silent for a moment. Considering what they’d lost.
“I could help, you know.” There’s something different in Malfoy’s tone now. “With the pain in your leg. Unlike you, I’m not helpless at Potions.”
***************************
Until now, of course. Now, when the Headmistress rises from her seat and a hush descends over the students even as they tuck into their pudding.
“I don’t brood,” he says, offended, even as he pulls her into a tight hug. “What’re you doing here, Gin? Shouldn’t you be practicing? I hear you’re a shoo-in for the Cup, and I’ll be damned if I lose all my Galleons because one of the Harpies can’t be arsed to show up for practice.”
“Guess we’re both orphans now.” The hard veneer of his expression cracks as Harry’s gaze falls. “Sorry. That was cruel.”
“Sir,” she begins cautiously, after he nods in her direction. “What exactly are we doing here?”
“What the hell?” she manages after a stunned moment of silence. Too shocked to be polite, she gives him an angry glare, shaking her hand as though it’s burning her. “That could have hit me right in the face!”
As the feast’s speeches had ever done when he was a student, this one fades into the background as Harry watches, surveys, takes note. Every table is a mix of crimson, yellow, blue, green, all eyes fixed upon the head table as the commanding voice of Minerva McGonagall takes hold of them.
“It needs to simmer a moment.” Malfoy’s voice is closer than Harry had been expecting and he takes a startled step back, hand flailing for his cane. The two consider each other over the silver curls of steam which waft upward from the potion.
“It’s not Ron.” Harry’s flat voice seems sufficient to snap Neville’s mouth shut and colour his cheeks, and immediately Harry wants to slam his head against his desk. “I’m—I only meant that Ron’s too good an Auror to quit now. He’s steady on track to become Head Auror, and I think he was talking about coming to Hogwarts to make me feel better. Plus at the Ministry, he’s closer to Hermione, and we all know how sickening they are even after all these years.”
“That kind of thinking ruined my family.” It’s a simple phrase but it takes Harry’s breath away, makes him turn toward the man he’d spent so many years trying to avoid. From this angle Draco is like a statue: perfect, sharp, features chiseled from marble by the steady hands of a master. From this angle there is no hint of the wounds which dance angrily across the other half of his face. “I don’t… I don’t want any of them thinking it’s right. I don’t want any of them to fall into the same trap I did.”
“Why’d you do it?” Harry takes a long drink of his tea. Something to hide behind, to cover his frowning mouth which asks the questions he can feel burning in his throat. “Why’d you punish that Ravenclaw?”
Draco says nothing. Harry looks at the clock.
“They think I don’t know the policies on the mining of magical ores,” Hermione laments, her cheeks red and her fingers clutching a near-empty flagon of firewhisky. “Like I’m an idiot! How could I properly assist the Minister if I don’t know all the policies? Anyway, I told them they had to have their permits turned into the Minister’s office by next week, and they were certainly not happy with me.”
“I didn’t let it,” she echoes, looking at her hand with awe before turning her gaze to the Sneakoscope, now lying still and nonviolent on the wooden desk between them. When her eyes finally flick back to look at his, a smile breaks like sunlight across her face, and she giggles with an abandon he hasn’t heard from her before. “I didn’t let it! I did it! Why does my hand hurt?”
“I dunno.” Harry’s response is dull, anticlimactic, a vague response to a very pointed question. He clears his throat, takes a long and fortifying drink of whatever lies in front of him, sweating in its container. “She saved my life. In a way, she saved all our lives. She lied to Voldemort. Told him straight to his face that I was dead even though she knew I wasn’t. I felt—I felt like I needed to be there.”
The night air is cold. A gentle but biting wind chills his bare fingers. The pain brings a certain clarity; it rids him of the fog of fretful dreams and unwelcome memories. Pale moonlight cascades upon the castle grounds, bathing Hogwarts in an ethereal silver glow which never fails to astonish him. Starlight studs the velvet sky, illuminating the mist which descends over the inky surface of the lake. Nights like these on the empty grounds make Harry feel small, insignificant. Alone. It’s a nice feeling, to remember that in the grand scheme of the universe, he means almost nothing.
It’s always strange to eat in the Great Hall before the term begins. Conversations are quiet; the long House tables are empty, extravagant meals are replaced by hearty stews with crusty bread, and mead flows freely, until the small gathering of professors are red-faced and laughing. The topic of discussion rests heavily on the potential new professor. It seems McGonagall has been tight-lipped, which irritates Slughorn more than anyone else, as he believes himself and “Minnie” to be rather close. This sends Harry and Neville into a fit of quiet snickering, which they hide well, but Hagrid has a harder time concealing his loud guffaws. Harry finds himself patting the half-giant’s back until he calms down, but the laughter has done its job offending Slughorn further, who slumps off, muttering under his breath.
“What happened?” It comes out before Harry can stop it, the tumble of words which had always seemed to get him in trouble. There’s a flash of reproach in Draco’s light gaze — --finally, something other than the oddly formal composure he had been brandishing since arriving on the school grounds. Harry can feel his cheeks flush and he chokes down another sip of the still-too-hot tea. “I only meant… Well, you know what happened to me.”
“No one in your group has managed it yet,” he offers vaguely, plucking a Sneakoscope from the desk and turning it in his fingers. “It’s an extremely difficult form of magic. It’s fickle—more of an idea, an intention, than a defined spell. Think of it like your mind trying to solve a problem. You can’t try to force it to solve it the way you want it to be solved; you have to let the magic do it on its own.”
Harry likes to think he’s cultivated a calming atmosphere. He surveys his classroom with a discerning eye: would he have felt comfortable here, learning spells to protect himself and his friends? Candles sit on every spare ledge, endlessly burning with the help of a few clever tricks, lending their warm and flickering glow to a room bedecked with wide windows and gentle sunlight. A cupboard rattles in the corner. Sneakoscopes perch on their edges along the wide shelves beside objects which whir and spin unthreateningly, while enchanted keys flit, feathers rustling, near the ceiling. He’d thought, perhaps, to add a grindylow to his collection, but Luna had regarded him with some measure of bewildered astonishment when he’d mentioned it, so he’d chosen instead to include portraits of dangerous creatures to the mix.
“Wrackspurts,” she says delicately, taking a step back from him to observe their beastly companions. They’ve eaten most of Harry’s offerings, moving now toward the pair, to inspect their pockets and bags for any further whiff of food. Unimpressed by their findings, the thestrals disperse, wandering through the field as the sun casts its light upon their inky skin. “I’ve always thought it. They’re why your hair stays so messy.”
Nearly a month into the term and Harry finds himself tossing and turning, vision stained red whenever he closes his eyes. Pain lances from the base of his spine down his leg, into the tips of his toes, and no matter which way he lies, he can’t escape it. With a sigh, he stands, pulling a sweater over his head as he limps through the door.
The firm, clipped sound of McGonagall’s voice pulls the Hogwarts staff out of their collective reverie. With bated breath, they attend her every word, listening as it grows closer.
There are people missing, of course. That brings him painfully, abruptly, back to the present.
“Malfoy.” This time, Draco holds his teacup out, waiting for Harry to pour the water. He obliges. A strange and electric tension snaps in this mundane act of making tea.
Neville continues with his suggestions, and Harry interjects every few minutes with his own ideas, until the room darkens as the sky outside fades to twilight.
“We don’t have time tonight for a lesson. But we’ll meet every other Tuesday, here, after dinner.” He locks eyes with each of them individually. “Intuitive magic is extremely difficult and it will leave you exhausted. Make sure you pay attention in Potions — an Invigoration Draught will come in handy. Now. Go back to your common rooms. Don’t let Filch catch you; I won’t be covering for you.”
Draco considers him over the cup he’s raised to his lips. Smiles again before drinking, something unreadable on his face.
“Not important?” Hermione’s voice reaches a fever pitch and Harry knows he has to intervene, to say something so that their row will not be heard by the entire population of Hogsmeade.
“Of course, Miss Baker.” He gestures toward the empty seat across from him and she takes it, fidgeting nervously as she does, unable to meet his gaze for more than a few seconds at a time. Harry waits patiently, his hands folded in his lap, eyes steady as he watches her face.
“Potter.” That cool voice is as infuriating as it had ever been, though now it is imbued with true calm where in younger years it had been filled with some desire to be noticed, to be seen, if even by its enemy. “Don’t let me interrupt whatever conversation you’re having with yourself.”
The Three Broomsticks is crowded and warm, the orange glow of enchanted lights casting a haze of comfort over the pub’s patrons. Merry conversation fills the wide room with a low hum; Madam Rosmerta passes drinks to the crowd with an unwavering smile on her face and tips a wink to Harry when they make eye contact. The smell of butterbeer and firewhisky stings their noses pleasantly and laughter erupts in the corner, loud and hearty, and Harry takes a moment to breathe, to remember that he no longer needs to be aware of every exit, every face.
“Waxing nostalgic?” The voice is low, amused, and it makes Harry’s teacup fall from his hand. Only an instinctual throb of magic saves it from shattering into a thousand pieces, meeting a steaming death against the cold stone floor. Draco’s eyes narrow as he realises that Harry’s wand is not in his hand, but he says nothing of it. “Didn’t mean to frighten you, Potter.”
There are nights he can’t sleep at all.
***************************
“Yeah. Shame.” Inelegant as always, Harry eyes Draco with guarded interest, wondering what demons have chased him out of his bed. For a moment they stand in silence, regarding the moonlit grounds before them. A thousand questions boil their way up Harry’s throat but he swallows them down, unwilling to be the first to break this tenuously cordial moment.
The Great Hall is abuzz with chatter, a clear night sky looming above them as the last remnants of enchanted daylight fade to darkness. The Sorting had gone by in an instant—even the Sorting Hat seems to know the ceremony is more of a formality now, a way to divide students into manageable class sizes rather than pitting them against each other—and it had almost been possible for Harry to forget that there was a familiar presence at the table. He’d been avoiding Malfoy, only catching the barest glimpses of him in passing, over so quickly it seemed that their avoidance had been mutual.
Not the entire truth, of course, but not entirely a lie either.
The click of the door opening echoes, cavernous, pulling Harry from his moment of introspection. But Neville’s grinning face is always a welcome sight, and Harry can’t help but reciprocate, smiling widely as he watches those long legs carry Neville down the stairs. Longbottom towers over him, his strides smooth and clean, and Harry immediately banishes any resentment that leaks through his enthusiasm to see his friend.
The students erupt with questions, so rapid-fire he can’t even attempt to answer them. After a few moments, he holds his hands up, laughing quietly until they settle down. He can remember his first group of students looking at him like he’d grown a new head. These students seem eager, thrilled, ecstatic, and it lights a fire in him, something familiar and nostalgic, an echo of Dumbledore’s Army ringing in his ears.
“I assume the same thing that happened with you and Pansy,” Harry says dryly, coughing as he takes another drink of the ale. “We realised that sometimes feelings don’t last after school. We’re still friends. Close friends. It’s better that way.”
Draco’s lips part as though he might say something else, but the clatter of the porcelain on the serving tray snaps his jaw closed.
“I got held up at the school,” Malfoy says, his voice calm, smooth as ever. Harry finds it rage-inducing. Wishes he could conjure that same peace no matter the circumstances. But instead he can remember shouting, screaming, anger, a red-hot ember in his chest that burns and glows and threatens and seethes. He stokes it with another drink of firewhisky. “I didn’t mean to be late.”
“I wanted to see you and Neville before term begins.” Her hands rest, authoritative, on her hips. “I’ve got the night off, Potter. Your precious Galleons are safe.” Teasing, always teasing, and he wouldn’t have it any other way. But now her expression shifts, concern warming in those amber eyes; she knows him too well, no matter the distance between them. “How bad is it today? Out of ten.”
The laughter dies on his lips as he heaves into consciousness, his leg aching, head throbbing with the fading sounds of screams and whispers. Dust motes hover, stagnant, in the beams of sunlight which filter through the long curtains. Sunrise has cast an orange glow into the morning air. Harry groans, rolling over, pressing his face into his pillow in some futile attempt to smother himself back to sleep. He can feel his heartbeat thumping frantically in his chest; he is no stranger to unpleasant dreams, but they never fail to leave him feeling helpless, terrified, as though he’s stuck in the past with all the demons contained there.
He’s not sure he likes this. The vulnerability. The way his body seems ready to snap. But he doesn’t hate it either — not really.
When they arrive at the castle it is dark. The corridors echo with their footsteps. Harry assumes that they will part ways now, go to their own quarters without another word, both left to chew on their conversation until sleep finally claims them. But Draco keeps pace with Harry, accompanying him, some unspoken agreement keeping Harry silent as they both walk toward his room. He feels stalked. Like a mouse cornered by a snake. Skittering toward its imminent doom.
The courtyard bustles with activity; students lie in the sun with books spread before them, quills scratching on parchment and leaves fluttering under a volley of levitation charms. There’s laughter and shouting and Harry smiles as he leans against the corridor wall, watching a couple of first-years attempting a game of wizard’s chess.
“Right,” Harry nods eventually, stubborn as he gazes at the horizon, no matter how keenly aware he may be of the fact that their shoulders are almost touching. The darkness makes them different. Bolder. Or perhaps only more comfortable. They’d both lived their lives in the dark, after all. Made a show of fighting it to pretend they hadn’t grown to be part of it.
“Ronald!” His mother’s voice interrupts him and Ron flushes again, narrowly avoiding a spoon that has come whizzing past his head. Harry grins widely, and they all move to the table, crowded together around a family meal that makes Harry want to laugh and cry all at the same time.
He sputters to a stop when he turns to find Harry standing just before him. His lips are slightly parted in uncharacteristic surprise, and if Harry hadn’t been so overcome with gratitude, he might take a moment to revel in that astonishment. As it is, though, he knows that his eyes are shining with unshed tears, that they are standing far too close together, that Draco’s breath is stuttering.
“What about that Dippet bloke? Your partner. You said yourself he’s a genius with a wand and he’s left the Ministry, and could be McGonagall knows his family, since he’s Armando’s great-great-great grandson, or nephew, or something.” Harry splutters but keeps his face buried in his teacup, hoping Neville doesn’t see the way his own cheeks darken at the mention of his former partner. Clearly, however, Neville’s so consumed by thoughts of their future coworker that the boggart could hop out of its cupboard and he wouldn’t notice. “Or there’s the Prentiss twins, they both wanted to be professors when we were in school…”
I haven't updated in a year. But I hope this semi-long chapter will make up for that. See my first chapter for important notes regarding the story as a whole. I'm sorry for the delay; 2020 was a rough year for a lot of us.
The kinder tone has Neville smiling again and Harry counts it as a success, despite his bruised ego, despite the ember of bitterness slowly burning a hole in his gut.
Thousands of paper butterflies flutter near the enchanted ceiling — this one charmed not to reflect the weather outside, but instead an eternal twilight, a purple-orange sky streaked with feathered clouds. The butterflies are every colour imaginable, some iridescent, some shifting through the colours of the rainbow. Harry’s mouth drops open; he’d never thought Draco Malfoy to be capable of anything so delicate, so… beautiful.
The sunset shatters across the placid surface of the lake, painting the dark water with brilliant splashes of pink, purple, orange. There’s a comforting sort of loneliness in sitting on the shore. Gentle waves lap against the sand, just missing the rubber of scuffed trainers; a tentacle breaks the glassy expanse of water to wrap almost lovingly around Harry Potter’s calf. He smiles. Taps a finger against the slick, rubbery thing that’s squeezing him rhythmically. The giant squid must be lonely too, he reckons, living by itself in the vast, dark lake—but perhaps they’re both onto something, breathing in their solitude, letting themselves simply exist, without expectation, without some greater purpose they must fulfill.
“McGonagall hired
He drops his wand arm and, by extension, the student, who looks dumbfounded. Serene, placid, Draco glides past Harry, ignoring the shocked expression which hangs limply below unruly black hair. Harry watches him go and feels deflated. His own rage seems to have nowhere to go, so he turns to the slack-jawed student and narrows his eyes.
Pinprick stars glow in the black sky. The moon shines, round and heavy, illuminating their path with pale light that makes Draco shine silver and casts Harry into shadow. He laughs at the thought, granting him a confused look from his companion, which he duly ignores, simply continuing to focus on his steps, the uneven ground they traverse.
Thankfully, he does not find out. Malfoy uses his wand, summons a bit of the potion, spreads it with a flick of the hawthorn clutched in his hand. It spreads across Harry’s skin and he hisses for a moment, not expecting the cool burn — but it dissipates immediately, leaving a soothing numbness behind.
“I should go,” she says, her voice a dreamlike trance, a siren’s call if he’s ever heard one. The girl who’d been known as Loony Lovegood. “I want to see Ginny before I set off with Rolf again. I’ll see you soon, Harry.”
“D’you know what happened to him?” A flick of his wand beneath the table and the air shimmers with his unspoken Muffliato. “Half his face is covered in scars. Weird scars. I thought I could get him to tell me about them, but of course, he’s still the same prick he’s always been and basically told me to fuck off.”
***************************
Best to leave the past in the past.
“Stealing from the Potions cabinet again, then?” Harry jokes lamely, anything to break the strange tension.
Harry had done the same. He smiles, waves his wand, and plunges the room into darkness.
This gets him a laugh — quiet, but a laugh all the same, and he finds his own smile spreading widely across his face. Harry takes this as his cue to leave.
“Welcome,” she says curtly, hands clasped in front of her, shrewd eyes scanning the room as though determined to memorise each face for future scolding. “Summer ends, and your life at Hogwarts begins. For those who are returning, welcome back; for the new faces, I am afraid that I must bore you with the rules of the castle, but rest assured that I shall let you resume your frivolities soon. The Forbidden Forest is exactly as its name suggests: forbidden. If you find yourself nearing the forest’s edge…”
“You’ll want to be out of here before one. That’s Trelawney’s free period.”
“Yes,” Draco interrupts, bemused, as though even he is unsure whether he accepted because he wants to go or simply to shut Harry up. Either way, Harry is grateful for the chance to stop talking, and he vanishes the teacup  in some attempt to do something with his hands.
Harry feels himself flush again.
That same concerned look still wrinkles her brow, but she allows Harry his pride, just this once. As she turns to walk up the hill, he gives his wand a perfunctory wave. With his weight resting on the newly-conjured cane, he limps behind her, only giving himself an instant of cruel jealousy before breathing in the refreshing August air. Long grass flickers and waves beneath the westward breeze. The twilight is beautiful, and he focuses on that, on the budding moon and the faint smattering of stars just beginning their ascent, on the light chill now embracing him. Not on the cane. Not on his leg. Not on the haze of memories threatening to cloud his vision. Ginny awaits him, and so does Neville, and he will not allow himself this time to grieve a life that was never meant to belong to him.
A long chapter! I hope that's a sufficient holiday gift for my long absence. Once again, all the thanks in the world to Brandon and Andrea, the best betas ever. Please be gentle with me.
There’s a pause in which Harry becomes afraid that Draco might touch him, might use those deft fingers to apply the potion. But is he afraid of that touch, or is he afraid of how he will respond to it?
He pours the tea as Neville pontificates.
Incredulity is not an unusual expression on Ron’s face; wide eyes and slack jaw are oddly comforting beneath the bright hair, amongst the constellations of freckles scattered across flushed cheeks. Harry can’t help but smile. It’s a strained one, hidden behind a cup of tea that warms him almost as much as the fire crackling in the Burrow’s hearth. In the kitchen, Mrs. Weasley is clattering away, charming the dishes to wash themselves as she cooks them an undoubtedly hearty meal. Her light voice and bubbling laughter make him feel at ease and he relaxes as Mr. Weasley’s excited voice chimes in. It brings back memories of school, of holidays, of their youthful days plotting moves of war in the darkness of Ron’s bedroom.
***************************
The secrecy, of course, isn’t entirely necessary. But it does make the students more interested. They lean in close, hanging on his every word, and Harry has to stop himself from laughing.
Or perhaps he’s projecting the things he cannot allow himself to feel onto a squid. As though to punctuate his madness, the tentacle gives him an even sharper squeeze which prompts a sigh from the empty bellows of his chest. How washed-up must one be to find camaraderie in a fucking squid?
***************************
Draco seems taken aback by the question—as though he’d been expecting another, something more difficult, more vague.
***************************
She scurries from the office with a tumbling mess of appreciative words, and Harry knows that she will practice against his advice, more and more advanced spells until she winds up in the hospital wing.
“So, Hermione,” Harry says, and her gaze snaps to his as though she’s about to turn her rage onto him. “I spoke with Malfoy today.”
He turns, and his mouth snaps shut. A hand moves instinctively to his wand, despite the fact that they are no longer teenagers, no longer on opposite sides of a war neither of them should have been fighting. A habit. Some ridiculous impulse he needs to suppress.
“I don’t know specifics,” she hedges, brown eyes flicking away from his own for a moment. Not lying, exactly, but skirting the truth. “You know how the Unspeakables are, Harry. All I know is that there was an accident with a case he was working and the next thing we knew, he resigned.” It’s unspoken but obvious: Draco’s departure from the Ministry sounds exactly like Harry’s.
“What’re you going to do about it?” A cruel voice cuts through the general gaiety, sharp and mean, and Harry searches the crowd for its source. “You’re a disgusting excuse for a wizard. Nothing but a — a Mudblood.”
The streets of Hogsmeade are quiet but not empty. People walk, huddled in their coats, hushed conversations interspersed with gusts of shrieking wind and the occasional drunken giggle. Harry and Draco walk silently, Harry slightly swaying with the breeze as he pulls his scarf around his face. The cobblestones are rough and uneven beneath his feet and he has to think about each step, each movement, in order to not stumble. Not next to Draco, who seems to place each step with easy grace, some feline elegance imbuing him with a natural surefootedness that Harry can only envy.
“Harry.” This voice isn’t part of the dream. He scrambles from bed, shoving his glasses onto his face as he makes his way to the hearth.
Harry’s guffaw of laughter would almost feel mean if he couldn’t feel the redness spreading across his face.
“Soothing Serum,” he says, his voice oddly gentle. “I use it every night. Here — may I show you?” Formal again, Draco gestures to a chair and Harry reluctantly sits in it, grimacing as he props his leg upon the desk and pulls the leg of his trousers up to reveal the injury beneath. The same angry, red scars snake up and around Harry’s calf, pulsating, biting.
“Good. Well. I’ll—see you then.”
“I keep beggin’ Charlie ter let me visit Norberta,” Hagrid booms, sloshing ale on the table as he passes a large mug to Harry. “He won’ commit to a day, but he says I can come see ‘er!” He beams behind the bushy beard, large teeth crunching into a stale cauldron cake.
“So you thought I’d confide in you?” Now he laughs, a sharp sound, mouth twisted into that smirk with which Harry is so familiar. “You were always a bit dull, Potter, but I thought you had to be at least a little clever to defeat the Dark Lord.”
Wordlessly, Draco holds the vial of potion out, grey gaze unable to tear itself away from that expression of awe, of relief. Their fingers brush for one more fleeting instant, as tenuous as the paper wings which dance along the ceiling, when Harry takes the bottled miracle and nearly runs from the room.
Curiosity ignites in Harry’s chest as he summons his teapot from his chambers. Neville takes a seat easily, his feet bouncing with anticipation and the energy of imparting a secret. Another smile, this one a bit gentler, ticks at Harry’s lips; the war has left its marks on all of them, but even through his own metamorphosis, Neville has somehow managed to retain that sweet spark he’s always had, that same genuine kindness Harry had seen in the eyes of a red-faced boy searching for a lost toad. A hand moves to touch his scar; it is no longer the two good legs that Harry envies, and yet he cannot bring himself to feel any true animosity toward one of the best people he’s ever had the good luck to know.
As he walks away, shaking his head, he can hear Hagrid’s chortling laughter echo behind him.
Harry moves toward the student, but before he can even summon an indignant shout, a spell whistles past his ear and collides with the chest of the fourth-year who uttered the insult. The boy is flung back and held against the wall, his eyes wide with terror as the black-clad attacker descends upon him like a wraith.
Harry, picking at his treacle tart, nods vaguely in response.
“Professor?” A cautious voice draws his attention away from the stacks of parchment on his desk. He knows the voice, but it carries an unusual air of uncertainty now, a lack of confidence, a vulnerability that makes him pause. Looking up, Harry gives the girl a reassuring smile, hands pausing in their shuffling and organising. “Can I talk to you for a moment?”
in which harry and draco may or may not go on a date.
This time around, I must thank my WONDERFUL betas Andrea and Brandon. Without them I wouldn't have finished this chapter coherently. They're so sweet and so encouraging and make me go back and fix my sometimes atrocious grammar issues. Thank you both so so much! Other notes: don't worry, the animosity will begin to cool down soon. I did warn that it's a slow burn, though.
“Save your apologies,” Harry quotes wryly, which grants him a small smile twitching across Draco’s mouth. They watch the students for a moment, and Harry wonders if Draco is thinking of his first years at Hogwarts, the moments of gaiety where even his bullying was juvenile, worth nothing more than hurt feelings and harsh words. Or is he thinking, perhaps, of a winter spent indoors, sobbing in a room filled with rubbish, wondering what will become of his family?
“Oh,” Draco responds, his choice of words just as lackluster as Harry’s. A pale hand moves to yank the tie from his long hair, rake his fingers through the almost-silver strands which glimmer under the flicking candle flames. He looks almost alien. Translucent. Fragile. “Well. I’m sure she would have been… flattered.”
“Thought you weren’t coming.” It’s an honest answer, unexpected, and Harry coughs as he pours for himself out of the pitcher Rosmerta left them. He waits until Malfoy has started to drink before he takes another drink himself, a bit of warmth to steady his shaking hands. That grey stare is too much for him to take. He’d rather focus on the mahogany tabletop, the stained wood floor, the flickering candlelight which casts uneasy shadows across the pub, the thrum of magic in the veins of those gathered inside the Three Broomsticks.
Draco sighed and nodded, offering Harry a chaste kiss in gratitude of his unwavering support. “Blaise told me I need to rethink my loyalties and realize I’m making a mistake by being with you. He said I had to stick with my own and become loyal to Slytherin, or else.”
Harry shook his head and sat up, his back leaning against his headboard and his knees drawn up to his chest. “I couldn’t; there was no way. I can’t believe he’s gone...I was so
Harry had begged and pleaded with Snape to come with him and help explain, but the Potions Professor had been adamant that Harry do it himself. He had a point, Harry admitted; he needed to practice explaining why he had chosen Snape in preparation for the adoption interview. Snape had explained to him the process through which magical adoptions occurred, and it didn’t sound like it was going to be as easy as Harry first assumed. He’d been a bit bemused as to why Snape knew so much about magical adoptions, but he didn’t push his luck by inquiring about it.
“You must understand, Harry. I saw no sense in worrying you further when I myself did not have all of the answers to the questions you would undoubtedly have. Even now there are details I am unclear on, and now I have no time left to help you figure them out.”
“At the end, when Greyback was talking. He’d only ever said the part about meeting again, but just as it cut out it looked like he said something else. Play it again,” Harry insisted, his stomach in knots as he tried not to envision what he saw on the werewolf’s lips just as the image faded.
Ron moved forward in his seat, clearly intending to speak, so Harry let him, even though he wasn’t sure he’d like what the redhead had to say. “I don’t think that’s possible, mate. He may remember everything, and have all the memories of how he used to act and feel, but that’s not who he is anymore. It’s not like his personality is an outfit he can decide to just change whenever he pleases. Who he is now, is who he is; his regained memories can’t really change that.”
“Mr. Zabini, Mr. Nott; you two stay.” Remus waved his wand to unlock to door, releasing the other students as he resized Harry’s bag and handed it back to him. “I think maybe carrying your cloak in your book bag isn’t such a good idea without some sort of warding on it, yes?” Remus whispered to Harry as everyone filed out.
“In, then. I’ll get the Mistress.” The girl turned left towards a long corridor and let out a shrill whistle that made Harry jump. “Loretta! Man here fer ya’!”
“Of course, my dear boy; of course. It is the least I could do.”
“Thank you. So are we all clear on everything now? I’m sort of grounded still, so I need to get back to my room before my dad has a fit.”
me to realize, that you had seen that memory long before we’d gotten together; before the accident, even. If it had changed anything about your feelings towards me, it would have happened long before now. You’re not a distraction; you’re what keeps me alive, what saved me from myself when you pulled me out of the coma. I love you and I’m an idiot. Forgive me?”
Severus brushed the hair back from Remus’ worried eyes, caressing his slightly stubbly cheek with the back of his hand. “Nothing will happen to him, Remus; I’ll make sure of that.”
to sleep,” Harry begged, rubbing at his bloodshot eyes as if to get his point across.
Severus sighed as he rubbed a hand tiredly across his eyes. “Not exactly obvious, no, but I
Snape…No news had been heard, despite Dumbledore’s efforts to find him. The last known place Voldemort had set up shop had been cleared out, and without Snape as their informant, they had no idea where he was now. They had no way of knowing if he was dead or alive, at this point.
“Remus and I had discussed this just before we moved. I guess it is time.”
“What am I going to do with you, Harry...” a deep voice said as he finally fell into the blackness that was sleep.
in Merlin’s name is the meaning of this?” Professor McGonagall asked derisively. The wall was in shambles, and the door to the rumoured Room of Requirement want hanging from its hinges. Three Gryffindors and one Slytherin stood covered in the dust and plaster from the blast.
nothing could be done, Albus, you should have told me it had started to spread. What’s more, even if something
“What’s happening, where is Professor Dumbledore?”
Draco stood suddenly from his seat at the table and grasped Lucius’ arm, startling the man. “Dad…be careful. I want to glamour your hair; I’m going to as well. We’ll stand out like beacons with our blonde hair. This way, we’ll blend in more.”
“That is one thing we can only speculate about. However, if you pay close attention to the memories I have collected for your benefit, you may see things of significance that Tom takes for himself. I am not guaranteeing that this will lead you to find any of the Horcruxes, but it is the best chance we’ve got.”
“Please, Severus...I hate this. I can’t even talk to you anymore. I want to fix this, let me fix this.”
“I’ve reviewed your curriculum and I’m very pleased, as I think Filius would be. I must say your willingness to step in at such a late hour is commendable.” Harry smiles once again; even as she attempts to thank the still-mysterious newcomer, McGonagall sounds fierce, as though she is begrudging even her gratefulness. “Tomorrow your first class will be with the first-year Hufflepuff and Slytherin students. I will have a timetable for you as quickly as I can.”
?” he spits, fists clenched, and a memory springs forward: those same fists destroying everything he could touch, here in this very office, a similar stoic gaze unaffected by his rage. Shame catches in his throat. Is he the same hotheaded young Gryffindor he’d been in school? As the wind suddenly drops from his sails, he sags into a chair, taking the biscuit she silently offers. “Professor. I don’t understand. How could you hire Malfoy?”
“Yeah,” Harry replies, watching him fade into the darkness. “Night.”
“You don’t have to downplay what you’ve done,” Harry says, an echo of Malfoy’s earlier assertion. His voice is still quiet. Unsure. “Your job was to secure the object. Not help me. But you did anyway.”
“Friends with Draco Malfoy. You git.”
When they do move, it’s in tandem, jackets tucked over arms and coins flipped to a still-smiling Rosmerta, who gives them each a cheeky wink before swaying to pour more drinks across the bar.
Harry’s mouth has fallen open. For the first time since Malfoy arrived on Hogwarts grounds, he looks at him fully, and he knows he’s gaping but is unable to stop himself. The left half of Draco’s face is scarred by shifting red-purple-grey slashes which seem to swell and recede with his heartbeat. Tension is snapping, thick in the air, subsiding only when the newest addition to the school’s staff sits back down and the students erupt into new, excited conversation.
A hush falls over the students as Harry enters the classroom, sunlight streaming through the windows to illuminate their eager faces in a soft yellow glow. His eyes narrow behind the round spectacles. Fourth years are never this attentive—not even during the interesting subjects like Patronus charms or his joint lessons with the new Transfiguration professor. Hesitantly, he places his things on the desk at the front of the room, thinking of the date.
The Charms classroom is… not what Harry had been expecting. Draco had changed it drastically, of course, but it is not the austere and foreboding place he’d always associated with the Malfoy family. Deep black wooden seats circle the room, leaving the floor open for lessons, for practice. White chalk still marks the chalkboard in Draco’s small, neat handwriting. Fairly unremarkable, even to Harry’s untrained eye, until something drags his attention upward.
“You reckon I’m a traitor now?” He’s joking, but he watches Ron warily, knowing this might lead to some explosion. After a moment of quiet staring, Ron leans back, taking a long drink of his tea as though there’s something stronger hidden in the sugary bottom of the cup.
“Save your apologies.” And with that he is gone, fading into the darkness of the castle.
“Oh, Harry, I just—I wanted to see how you’re doing. I know sometimes the school year can be stressful, and I had some ideas about lesson plans if you’re having trouble, or I’m happy to just hear whatever ideas you’ve come up with so far. Education is very important, after all.” Each word comes more and more quickly as though they’re fighting to make it out of her mouth, and Harry smiles with some bemusement until it dawns on him. Guilt. The smile looks guilty and the words are all guilty and even Hermione can see the exact moment when Harry Potter becomes angry.
“Of course I was afraid,” Harry replies, his voice quieter than he’d thought it would be. Every year he gets some variation of this question and it never gets easier to answer. “I was afraid every second. I tried to be brave but I knew what I was risking. I watched my friends die… my family… I knew I would watch people die around me until the end. And that was the worst part.”
“It’s true, though,” Harry replies, quiet, perhaps too quiet for Draco to hear. “At least I was young when it happened to me. You—you had a whole life with your parents. I barely remember—”
“So ‘Arry,” Hagrid hedges, not able to meet Harry’s gaze. “Wha’ d’you think of tha’ Malfoy bloke teachin’ here? I reckon it were quite a shock to yeh!”
“Looks that way.” Clearing his throat, Harry watches as Malfoy slopes toward him, his lean figure cutting through the snow like a knife. He hadn’t prepared for a conversation; pain lances up his leg and settles in the base of his spine and he does his best not to grimace as Draco leans against the wall next to him. “What brings you out?”
“I surprise even the famously unflappable Harry Potter.”  Draco summons the milk and sugar with a lazy wave of his wand, a fading echo of haughtiness stiff upon his brow. “It seems that life at the Ministry didn’t agree with either of us in the end.”
“I had to leave.” Quieter, now, Malfoy seems to be talking more to the empty air than to Harry. “After I left St. Mungo’s, I couldn’t go back to the Ministry. They weren’t going to push me out or ask me to leave. I could still do my job. But I couldn’t go back. So I came here. Practically begged McGonagall for a job, embarrassingly enough, and luckily Flitwick had just sent notice of his illness. And here I am.”
“As fun as that may be for old times’ sake,” Draco says, his tone dry, “I do tend to keep up my own supply of ingredients.”
It’s not a good finish. It’s a surprisingly weak one, leaving Harry feeling as though he’s lost track of his story, lost the upper hand amongst a crowd of liars and thieves and people who don’t deserve his judgment, but who get it anyway, because he’s not the reverent whispers they speak behind their hands, he’s a blunt instrument just like he’s always been, someone raised and kept alive for one thing and unsure of what to do with himself now that that thing has come to pass. When he finally manages to meet Draco’s eyes, they’re unexpectedly soft. Not angry. Not accusatory like Harry expects them to be. He’s never seen any softness in Draco, only anger, and pride, and fear.
“Yeah, well, good to know you and Professor McGonagall have agreed that I’m no more than a petulant child who’s not to be trusted.” It comes out a bit colder than he’d meant it and he regrets it instantly; the dreams always leave him in a nasty mood, and Hermione had chosen a bad day to wake him and place this new betrayal on his shoulders. He sags, exhausted, hands lifting to scrub through untidy hair. “Sorry, sorry. I’ve done nothing but prove your point, haven’t I?”
