Harry ignores them. "That's why he's been acting weird all day. He also said he'd find me a replacement and sort of train them so they can get used to my antics."
"No," Draco says, a light laugh passes through his lips. God, he misses his friends. "I just feel like it's time to actually take care of myself. I want to settle down."
“They’re so..” Albus trails off, staring at the picture with a strange look. “Young,” he finally settles on.
Scorpius and Albus both level James with a stare, eerily disconcerting. It makes Lily shiver, and it also seems to creep James out. They don't say anything, and instead sweep through the hall to the kitchen. Lily shakes her head at James, and follows, him trailing behind her.
"Darling, have you seen yourself? After all, it is only fair that everyone who's met you is at least a little in love with you."
James doesn't look at any of them, frowning to the floor just before Lily's spot. She doesn't understand. Perhaps it is because she's only thirteen, and the others are older and have a better understanding of how the world works. Perhaps it is because she had been only almost six when their father left, that she didn't have the capability to grieve properly, or that she had less memories of him. She can't understand why the adults always look pained, and weren't able to speak about the matter of her father.
He takes a shuddering breath, and pulls away slowly. His eyes are red-rimmed, cheeks pink. His eyes are the exact copy of dad, she thinks. Hers are more of a lighter green.
Draco looks away from the window, placing his wine glass on the window sill. He peeks at Harry through his eyelashes. "At times, yes. Sometimes, no."
“You betrayed them, in the end. I'm just saying you’re not that bad.” Then he sighs dramatically, “Merlin, Draco, just let me be your friend. Please.”
. "But when I asked him if he wanted to light an old candle, he took the match from my hand and threw it away. Sad, really," he shrugs, somehow it's an
“Yes.” He says, unashamed. Then he stares at her silently, all the amusement draining out from his expression. He takes a couple of her books and walks beside her out of the library.
Draco looks at him straight in the eyes, and it feels like he's confronting himself more than answering Theo. He nods. "There is."
She rolls her eyes, ignoring the person and turns towards the small gathering of Gryffindor first years around her table. “We’re finished for today, go prepare for dinner. If you have any questions or trouble with homework, you can find me after, okay?”
"We're old enough. Why can't we talk about Father normally, why is it like some sort of taboo to ask about him?"
“I will take a day off tomorrow,” Draco informs him quickly, avoiding Harry’s eyes. “Thank you for, uh, dinner and the ride. Um, good night.” Then he dashes out of the car and
She blinks, the muffled voices of the library coming back to her. She looks at the first year, and smiles. “No, I was lost in memories,” she says. “Well, how to describe him? He was beautiful, kind, and smart.” It was the answer she had memorised for two years. Then she added, “and I think, a little bit sad.”
Draco blinks and looks down, but Harry doesn't seem like he's broken from any enchantment at all. Draco bites his lower lip. "I just think it was time to settle down."
"Of course," Harry says, frowning. "I would never do that. I just," he cuts himself off when a waiter comes with their food and pours their wine. "Just doing what's due."
Harry must have not fully recovered, because next he sees a fond look crossing Draco's face. But as soon as he sees it, Draco has already pulled away from his arms and stretches as he stands up. He does
Draco rolls his eyes and sits up, leaning against the bedpost. "I was given a day off and I thought I would use it by meeting up with my silly friends over lunch. But I guess this works too."
Draco rolls his eyes, moving forward to take back his glass of frozen hot chocolate. Theo raises the glass away from his reach.
Draco gasps, although Harry doesn't quite know if it was because he'd said those sacred words, or it was merely because Draco had finally come. He doesn't dwell on it much longer, because then he's coming himself. He slows down, taking his time and enjoying the feeling of the last of his euphoria as little by little he spills inside. He's sheathed almost fully inside when it stops coming out.
It’s fine, Lily thinks. Father is just upset at something. Perhaps he also had woken up from a nightmare. Nightmares are scary, she thinks. It makes her angry sometimes, though mostly she wakes up feeling scared.
Lily is sitting comfortably on the floor, her back leaning on the sofa, between Scorpius’ and Albus’ legs. While James and their dad sit across them on their own single person sofa.
bought black out curtains. It's just that he never really wakes up and stays to see if it actually worked.
Draco stares at him, then at his tie, and back at him. "Oh," he says, fingers automatically redoing Theo's tie and brushes his collar neatly. "Apologies, it's just that I–"
Harry doesn’t even realise that it was he who moved, at first. But then he’s already leaning over Draco’s knees, feeling Draco’s warm breath on his cheeks and he faintly smells the sweet fragrance of red wine. His hand is hovering on the side of Draco’s head, very near that the ends of silky strands brushes his fingertips.
“If you only remember little about him, can you miss him?” The one who had begun the questions about her father asks her with a small voice. Then, she understands the meaning behind the question.
"Me too," Theo shrugs. "Remember how people used to be afraid of you because you looked so unapproachable? Fun."
"Come on, Lily Luna," James says. Then, the same time as she sees Harry place each of his hands on the twins' shoulders, James apparates them into the living room.
James had been thirteen, he had the blessing of having complete parents from he was a baby until he turned into a teenager. He had known what it was like to receive his Hogwarts’ invitation and boast about it in front of Father and Dad, how it feels like when his whole family came with him to King’s Cross. To send a letter back home on the very first day alone without family at Hogwarts and receiving a reply the next morning filled with reassurance. James had known what it was like when he went home for Christmas bringing trouble with his homework and having Father help him. He knows how it felt like, having his family cheering for his team at Quidditch, having Father cheer for him even though it was against his former House.
The answer seems to surprise him, and James blinks at her before nodding as well. Scorpius and Albus remain unperturbed. But Harry is quick to recover, giving them a warm smile. "Let's go then."
“No.” Albus scowls. “From what I understand, you’re telling me that he was aware that he would leave us. That it was his decision to leave us.”
Harry doesn’t realise this but as he drifts off, he unconsciously grabs Draco’s wrist and pulls him down beside him. He doesn’t understand - his body feels warm, the blanket feels warm, and when he unknowingly drapes over Draco, he feels even more
Harry suddenly feels sleepy. “Dunno..” he turns to Draco, eyes fighting to stay open. “I’m sorry but I think I’m falling asleep.”
He turns to Draco and furrows his eyebrows as he says, "Draco also doesn't do well with alcohol, do you?" then turns back to Harry without waiting for an answer. "You should try to see him drunk. He's cute that way, because he gets quiet but not really, he would sleepy whisper-ramble all night long until he passes out. And—"
"You didn't tell me?" Albus says, looking up. Rose gently pry the photo from his hand and Hugo scrambles to her side.
,” he hisses. “How would you understand what he felt? What the fuck do you know about how he’d struggled to accept his mistakes, struggling how he should feel about the things he did or didn’t do?! That lots of people lost their families, and how he thought he was selfish to try and keep his own family alive?!”
Harry shrugs helplessly. “You’re a casualty of the war as much as the others. You’ve been a brat, yes, but you’re not evil. I don't see why I can't try to befriend you now that we've grown.”
Theo has been late for twenty minutes when the cafe's door opens and he comes in, stumbling but managing to look dignified the next second. He catches Draco's eyes and flashes him a smirk as he walks towards his table. He quietly sits down across Draco, unbuttoning his suit and places it on the back of his seat.
It’s convenient that Draco finally accepts his fate to Harry gaining the green card to annoy him anytime he wants. But Harry's mind is nowhere but his last train of thought. He doesn’t know why he’s suddenly taken aback when he knows that Draco has never looked not good. He'd heard girls, and sometimes even boys, appreciating Draco Malfoy’s good looks over the years.
"Shut it. Where's my wand?" he winces when Harry pulls out, letting himself get manhandled to fit in Harry's arms. Harry waves his hand, effortlessly casting a cleaning charm, and drags his bed cover over them. "Show off," Draco says sleepily without heat.
"You really aren't going to leave me alone?" Draco says after a long moment. He keeps his eyes trained on the books in front of him.
"And I won't ever leave the kids, I won't- I wouldn't dare-- but I told him- I told him to don't go where I can't follow and he promised that he won't but then he left. He fucking left and I feel like I'd march to where he is and drag him back here because I can't-- I'm not as strong as everyone takes me for and I need him."
Lily pulls her face enough to see that Harry's face is expressionless, ordering James to wait for him in the kitchen. She stays long enough to see that Harry doesn’t say or do anything when Albus stomps out of the house before Scorpius pulls her completely away from their family.
Draco hums, twirling the red liquid in his glass. His cheeks have the pretty hue of pink, expression ever so relaxed. Harry thinks this is one of his favourite looks on Draco. Soft and content.
Harry’s heart beat erratically. They were so close. Draco had a tiny freckle on the corner of his eye, and Harry could see straight up the skirt to Draco’s pants. Harry wasn’t even sure it counted as
do not tell you that things are not your fault. Other people might, but I do not. If something is your fault, I tell you. Is that not true?"
Harry understood what Draco wanted and increased his pace, his pelvis slapping against Draco's arse with every thrust, and Draco loved it, the physicality of bodies meeting—not just genitals joining, but people, with all their strange and dangly bits, scrotum slapping against his arse, and
"Okay Potter," I say, speaking so quickly I stumble over my words. "Listen. You might be able to use the house's energy if you have more power. I'm going to let you use my magical energy. Here's the thing: it could kill me. It's worth the risk, because if we do nothing, we'll both die anyway."
“Why not?” Harry asked, and even as he said it he could think of a million answers to that question.
“Oh, don’t give me that. I don’t care to retroactively psychoanalyse my teenage self. Was it you I was attracted to, or was it what you stood for in the war? Was it that you were fit, or that I wanted to be the type of person who could be with you?” Draco smiles sadly. “I don’t know. All of the above?”
Wilhelm winked, which was disturbing, his little wooden eyelid clinking down, and Harry waved his wand and watched him disappear from Harry's hand.
Goldie Masters turned around, her eyes widening with eager glee when she spotted Harry. She snapped her fingers and a camera appeared in her hand. She held it up and clicked before Harry could even smile-but-unintentionally-grimace.
Potter, to my great surprise, bursts out laughing. A real laugh, his head tilted back. "For fuck's sake, Malfoy. I don't think rats have an ethical code." He sobers. "The rat-rats, I mean. I know people-rats don't have an ethical code."
Aster reached for the cracker, but Draco held it out of her reach and Harry handed her one of the apple slices. "I don't understand what motivates them to do these things."
Everyone in the office loved Draco—and that was the result of hard work, years of building trust, proving to each of them that he had changed. They loved him not because he was a Malfoy, but because Draco was a good partner, a reliable co-worker, a fighter for everyone’s causes. Because he told fantastic stories in the lunchroom, putting on dramatic voices and exaggerating just the right parts.
, Harry." He looked into his tea. "I never have." Harry didn't respond, so Draco, unwilling to endure the silence, kept talking. "In school, like in fourth or fifth year maybe, I used to give myself pep talks about how to avoid getting into it with you. Snape was livid at me for losing house points because of you; my father was furious that I was being public with my animosities. I
Hermione looked at him nervously over Goldie’s shoulder. Everyone always listened to Harry more than the others, which was preposterous because, really, this wasn’t even his thing, and yet the success of it would hinge on his retention of Hermione and Draco’s outrage.
"Mr Potter!" a voice cried, and he saw the pink flash of a Press ID badge. "Mr Potter, would you like to make a statement about your outfit? About your position on the R.O.B.E.S. Order?"
Harry looked around the cafe. "There's a free table next to the veela over there. If you don't mind. You know how no one likes to sit by them."
“Huh?”  Draco removed his hands from his eyes. “Oh, because babies wake up crying. We had Lorraine, so.”
Draco had closed his eyes, his lips twitching up in amusement. "He's your son, Potter," he whispered with relish as he gestured towards the Floo.
Harry doesn't think; he only does what his instinct tells him to, which is apparently to rise up and back on his knees and lower his mouth to Draco Malfoy's penis, opening his mouth to fit around it, feeling a little awkward-sloppy, but not caring at all because his
"We grant an interview. All the publications are clamoring for one—they all want to get the exclusive tell-all about our relationship."
"Yeah, okay, I've heard enough," Harry said, tugging his DMLE badge out of his pocket and throwing it to the floor in front of Rump's feet. "Whatever you think 'Western magic' is, I want no part of it."
Life on the street bustles on. People hurry past, glancing at their watches, presumably late for work.
Turns out Hermione has figured out a Charm to rewind a VHS tape to the exact second she wants, which she does as Harry stands to Draco's left.
. The Weasleys tried to be there for me, but now that Ginny and I are split, and Ron's being a bit of a wanker, I feel like I don't have them. And it's not like they ever really
his full-time job. He completely checks out during the bureaucratic nonsense that he's heard over and over, his mind wandering, wondering what the fuck he and Ginny are going to do.
Ginny's eyes widen until he can see her entire iris. "You're seeing a bloke." She takes a shaky breath. "I mean, as long as it's not Ron. I guess...that's cool?"
“How long were you and Astoria married?” Harry asked, walking into the bathroom and searching for his stuff.
"Don't be mean to Radcliff." Potter absently heals a scratch on the rat's paw. "You're better at Transfig than I am, so I'm going to do the dead man, you do the rat. Don't hurt him. Like, make sure he can go back to being a live rat when we're done."
"Did you have fun last night?" she asks, looking up. "I didn't see you at the end of the party. Did you take my advice and go outside for a breather?"
"One hundred percent honesty, we said. Necessary for a real relationship, we said," Harry jokingly prodded. But then he seemed to have an attack of morality and added, "But only if you want to."
Draco scoffed. "Harry, you saved the world when you were one and again when you were seventeen. I'm pretty sure we can handle anything too."
"To be clear," Draco says, "we're discussing the embryo Ginny aborted before it became a baby, and not the actual human baby Teddy, who is your godson?"
Draco groaned, then decided to play along. "Alright, Mr Potter, here's what I can offer: I can offer you and Deputy Leader Granger time to present your case to the party leadership. I can make sure the leadership takes the proposal seriously. However, I must tell you that I do not think it is a
"How exactly would this bring people joy?" Draco asked, holding a petit four delicately between two fingers.
"Fine," Harry says, feeling helpless for about the millionth time in his life. "We'll talk after dinner?"
Harry’s eyes flitted to the clock. He wanted to get out of here. “Draco, we agree. People should be able to wear whatever they want. I’m just not sure what you propose doing about it.”
"Jelly-knees, fluttery stomach," he said. Something in his tone was raw, like he knew he was exposing himself.
"Er, yes. I do. I didn't cancel because I didn't want to see you. I just…I have trouble. Doing things."
and declares, "Potter! You need to ask before you introduce that type of element into our sexual repertoire."
"Then forget the guilt; there's nothing to be guilty for. And you're right. About the job. I'm worried about what will happen, now that I'm gone—but I won't miss it."
Draco paused his rant when they sat at the table with full plates of eggs, toast, and fruit. Harry figured there was no way Draco's rant was truly finished—Draco would rant forever about most things, after all—but that he merely needed a breather and/or sustenance. Now was Harry's chance to change the subject, to focus on something they could actually
Harry shot a Stinging Hex at Draco's arse as they continued up the stairs. Draco's outraged and delighted laugh rang through the stairwell, echoing like the clear sound of a welcoming bell.
series. They’d gone to films and Quidditch games and football games and, one long weekend, to Scotland for the Gourock Highland Games. He’d taken them to see their favourite children’s musician, Lonnie Smack, in a park.  Every autumn they’d gone to the Godric’s Hollow Mabon Festival.
"Scared?" I ask. I am, though I'm not fucking admitting it. I didn't spend six years living in the Slytherin Common Room to get cold feet over some light corpse desecration.
Malfoy leaned back on his arms, closed his eyes. “They’d tell me my desires are unavoidable but that I need to marry a witch to make a good match, to align them with a proper family, to have a child in a traditional conception—because the entail is written so that children of male pregnancy and of adoption aren’t considered true heirs—and that I can fuck anyone I want discreetly on the side, as is befitting my social position. They’d probably use the word ‘dalliance.’ ‘You may pursue discreet dalliances, Draco,’ they’d say.” Malfoy paused, opened his eye. “Wow, fuck, this potion works for imagining bad things, too.”
Draco suppresses a smile as he opens his music app, waves his wand to turn on the speakers, and presses play.
Draco picked up his teacup, put it back down. "I thought we—I—could keep emotion completely out of it. I thought we could be pragmatic—we could be roommates and pretend to be in love sometimes. We were both used to taking on burdens for work, for the magical world. I thought it wouldn't be that big of a deal. I thought—we were already family, anyway. Like, if moving into Andromeda's house would save the world, obviously I'd do it, right? At least…that's what I told myself."
Lorraine, who would have brought tea if she saw Harry in this state, was on her day off. Draco was at work—arguing a case—so he wasn't on his mobile.
"In any case," Hermione continued, for some reason not wanting to continue talking about Malfoy's coffee habits, "Robards has assigned us a new case. We have a meeting in five."
"Are you sure?" Harry looks at his tea. "I mean, it's fine if you're not comfortable with it. He was a right arse to you for like an entire decade, and then there was the whole getting-tortured-at-his-house thing. You don't need to be okay about him, just for me."
"What are we discussing, exactly?" Hermione asked, her tone reminding him eerily of Professor McGonagall.
"Nullify the vow," Draco said. "So I don't feel like a dirty manipulator and we both know, for sure, our feelings aren't being affected by a magical link. Tell each other the truth from here out, no matter what. Even if it causes arguments. No,
"What about the press?" Albus asked. "You said you were going to keep us out of the press—what press?"
“You look like Albus just found out that Capella was not his first child. You look young enough to be on the Wall of Grandchildren.” Draco pauses, flinging a hand to gesture at the wall to the left of the hearth, which is covered with dozens of framed photos. “Why were you testing Age-Regressing Potions? Surely you know those potions are completely tested and regulated by the Ministry.”
family, too. And so then we were family. I don't—" He looked at his lap. "I don't expect those of you who are in the younger generation to understand what I mean. Anyway. We were family, and we had all this shared history, and all the time in the back of my mind is that this is a man who
At this, Malfoy sighed and turned around, apparently resigned to conversation. "Bill is still on leave tending to his small humans. Which means I have twice the work, which means I really need my morning pick-me-up."
. Harry's lost in it, his hips rolling forward, pushing farther, chasing that feeling in Malfoy's mouth, when suddenly Malfoy splutters, gagging and coughing, and pushes Harry's penis out of his mouth so he can catch his breath.
Harry grimaces at Hermione, wondering what the fuck Draco wants to say to his dead parents and assorted other parent figures, but Hermione just laughs.
"What's her name?" Draco asked, his voice cracking. "Or are you going to continue torturing us by withholding that information?"
The worst part about this having-to-share-a-room-and-bed-with-Draco thing was that Harry couldn’t even be mad about it—because it was for
Draco tensed before he spoke. "I'll thank you to give me the benefit of the doubt, Scorpius. I'm well aware of the implications."
"True," Draco said. "So the question is, would our relationship be revealed accidentally, or because we decided to announce it?"
"That wasn't a sexual move; it was me fighting you because you're a fucking git." Harry was going to continue arguing, but somehow they're snogging again. Some minutes pass; Draco tastes like chocolate.
“I can’t believe you wore those shorts.” Draco crossed his arms over his chest. “All I could think about was the fact that I
"They know the facts," Harry said. He turned to look at Draco, and Draco gave him an encouraging nod, then reached over slightly awkwardly to hold Harry's hand. "But they don't know what it was like. Watching people die. Our mates from Hogwarts understand, to some extent, and Ron and Hermione, of course. And Ginny. If I'd found lasting love with someone in that group, it would've been straightforward, I suppose."
“Sometimes the need to engage in a kinky round of stopwatch-timed orgasms arises extemporaneously, Harry,” Draco said, his face suddenly serious, like he was arguing in front of the Wiz. “Sometimes sexual spontaneity comes at the expense of safety precautions.”
Harry slumps towards her until his head rests against her shoulder. "I liked it. I like him. I don't know
"As far as I can see, the only person this would help is Borgin, back in whatever-the-fuck-year Tom Riddle worked there after Hogwarts. The current law only says that business owners can be held legally and financially responsible for illegal activity on their premises. It's common fucking sense. Business owners
"I feel like I've run a marathon," Harry said later, after everyone had left and Lorraine served chicken shawarma bowls (rice for Harry, cauliflower 'rice' for Draco).
"I don't understand," Lily said, turning to look at Nico, then back at Harry and Draco. "I mean, Dad, you once told me you couldn't date someone because they didn't like David Bowie, and no offense Draco, but you have the
Harry blinks. He's tempted to look at the ceiling and shake his fist at the universe. What the fuck? How can this be his life? What is he supposed to do—go sit there next to his erstwhile enemy whom he'd fucked just last night? And, oh god, he can see half a hickey on Malfoy's ridiculously white neck.
"Oh Potter, you've no idea how long I've wanted to do that." He tried to organise his hair back to the apparent mop I had.
Draco woke up happy. He didn’t know where he was, but he did know that he felt safe. He was leant against something comfortable, and was being held safely. Draco wasn’t very used to affection, but he had to admit in his dream addled state, he could see why others liked it.
He’d always loved the stars. Those pretty dots in the sky that told a million tales. He always figured they were the best story tellers.
"What's going on in here?" Pansy faced me, her face flushed pink from breathlessness. She calmed herself quickly, using a hand in front of her face, which she dragged down to drain her face of emotion. It looked like a well practiced tactic to look neutral, and was creepily effective.
“I’ll probably help them. Bye.” He kissed her on the cheek before getting up and leaving with as much grace as he could handle.
“Ugh, fine Blaise! Whatever! I’ll ‘get to know them’. Don’t put your hand on my mouth ever again, I don’t know where it’s been.” Draco gagged. Blaise bounced his brows and lowered his eyebrows.
"Now this is a classic single word riddle, where you have to think of how it's spelled and take it apart. But an answer just as fitting would be..." She faced the eagle, "a person wearing a blindfold." You could nearly hear the eagle grumbling about 'Ravenclaws these days', before the door opened out. "Thank you Bernie!" Meredith called to the knocker before walking into the common room. The first years followed after her, all in awe.
“Vould you really? You are a vonderful friend Drako.” Draco tried to hide his excitement as he got out of his seat with Viktor
“Oh that’s so nice.” She poked his nose dismissively. “Now lets have dinner while its hot or I might have to torture a house elf.” She grinned sweetly and pulled on a curly lock of hair. Draco followed her.
Once everyone left the classroom, noise erupted from the crowd. A lot of people were talking about how cool Moody was. Draco scoffed at this.
“How about you act like an upstanding pupil and I don’t punch your teeth in?” She threatened, rolling a sleeve up. “Or would you rather get your teeth curb-stomped?” Potter shuffled away slightly.
Draco put on a mask of fake calm and charisma. “Great playing. I’m Draco Malfoy.” He shook the other boy’s hand. “I admit I wasn’t aware you were still at school, and neither were the other’s telling by their shock.”
After a second of deliberation, Potter agreed with a smirk. Draco rolled his eyes as he began to walk back to Slytherin dormitories.
“Malfoy! Are you okay?” Draco jumped to his feet in surprise and turned to where the voice cam from.
“Oh tits on a treadmill that’s wild! Dragons, dragons have got to be real! Harpies?! Werewolves?! VAMPIRES!?!?” Danny continued with growing excitement.
Blaise blushed faintly. Or Draco thought he did. You couldn’t really see it because of his skin tone. Draco was jealous. You could always tell when Draco turned pink. He was pale as parchment and twice as white. Or something.
"You really don't have to Malfoy, I'm okay with my clothing, there's no reason for me to waste any money." I tried insisting that it really wasn't worth it, but he blocked me out and immediately started charming his face. Before I could stop him further, he'd already given himself a softer chin, freckles, and light brown eyes in a look that honestly suited the black hair much more. I could barely recognize him, as he had turned into a completely different person. Which I guess was the point.
“Tell me something I don’t know. Now go.” He pushed her away and she waved goodbye in a huff. As soon as she left Blaise slid next to him.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
He looked at the docile scene before him with a befuddled expression on his face. Hermione swiftly slipped her arm out the crook of his elbow and came over towards the sofa.
“It’s about what you said, romance. And I’d rather keep that tidbit of information between us.” He jabbed Potter’s chest as he returned to his crossed leg position.
Blaise was getting into it, now doing some more jagged and off movements, as he obviously grappled with doing what Moody was making him and what he wanted to. Eventually he was forced to resort back to dramatic stage dancing with a reluctant frown on his face.
TW: kind of a toxic relationship being set up between Blaise and Theo, with some mild manipulation so if that might affect you please try and avoid a part of Octavia’s POV.
The whole thing looked pretty funny, as Draco looked as if he was intimidated by Pansy, a skinny little 5’2 girl who wore a tad too much makeup. He still glanced away from her death gaze anxiously.
He racked his tired mind whether a re-sorting could be arranged, but the hat had been said to never make a mistake. Besides, he'd never heard of any kind of ceremony to re-sort a student, and didn't want to cause that big of a fuss.
“So am I going to have to sing a duet with him later? To the Backstreet Boys?” He asked Draco. Draco shrugged with a smirk.
"And I still can't believe you own a library. I'd kill for my own library! My shelves are practically breaking under the weight of my books, it's not fair." She didn't seem as bothered about it as she sounded.
"The stupid looking one is Weasley, the nosy looking one is Granger, and the Harry Potter looking one is Potter. And we are leaving." He took her hand and tried to drag her away but she resisted.
And they moved on from it. Octavia would be keeping the argument in the back of her head, but she just wanted to have a nice Halloween. She she’d try and have one without fighting with her brother. If that was possible.
“Hmm. Funny.” She pointed at him. “I like you. You’re fun.” She jumped over the banister, past the gaggle of gingers, onto the floor and walked towards him. “What’s your name?”
Draco was in the library now, along the restricted section and potions section, caught between two shelves of books. It was the dustiest area of the library, since not many went where the potions books were written in pure Latin. It did however make for a perfect place to have some peace and quiet.
Blaise eventually let go and stormed back into the party like a man on a mission. Potter stared after him confused.
He felt too cold, too hot, everything was too loud and too quiet. He couldn't focus on the goblet directly in front of him and his vision kept shaking. All he could think of was what trouble he was in. 'Father's going to kill me. Father's going to kill me. Father's going to kill me,' was all that cycled in his mind. He blocked out the rest of the sorting and tried to keep his breathing quiet.
"Yeah right. And what's with your name? Draaaacoooo. It sounds pretentious." Draco felt anger curl up inside him.
"Thank you Neville, but I don't need saving. It's not a big deal anyway. I suspect his head being full of Popty-Pings, a close cousin to the Wrackspurts. It gives the afflicted an ego and makes them confused enough to suffer delusions for weeks at a time. I've tried recommending ways to get rid of them, eating plenty of salty food, keeping a daisy behind your ear to lure them out, holding the back of a teaspoon to your forehead for a couple of hours, and so on. Of course, you need to want them to leave, so I suppose the Popty-Pings will continue to fester until they've eaten all of his earwax. Once they do, they'll bite through his eardrum, leaving him deaf." Luna responded evenly, even happily. I made concerned eye contact with Neville, who shrugged and mouthed "search me".
“I wish I had an older sibling! All I have is my twin brother Felix, and he’s a real pain.” Martha told her.
"Aster," Ginny said, reaching out and placing a hand on the baby's blanket. "You're a strong woman already, aren't you?"
"Right," Harry said, not relishing the thought. He sighed. "I kind of can't believe the kids believed us."
Harry stared at Parvati, not knowing what to say. She leaned closer and wrapped her long arms around him in a hug. Then she pulled back and announced loudly, “Anyway, I cried like a baby. She can never go back, you know?”
Harry exhaled as tingles prickled through his body. He tried not to moan, because that seemed somewhat inappropriate when someone was merely scratching your head.
He dreamt he was awoken by a familiar grey-blond head kissing his neck. He dreamt he liked it. He dreamt he smiled, closing his eyes, and threaded his fingers through Draco's hair. He dreamt Draco climbed on top of him, he dreamt he loved the weight of another body on his. He dreamt a bone-deep relaxation with a joking partner atop him, not sex but laughter. Harry dreamt Draco teasing him for being a "glorified cop," he dreamt of pride at their political accomplishments and a world that wasn't burning. He dreamt a baby gurgling in the hallway and the sound of Scorpius and Albus half-asleep, walking into walls on the way to the baby. He dreamt he thought Draco was sexy as fuck. He dreamt he asked Draco if he wanted to snorkel. He dreamt Draco said yes. He dreamt Draco in a pair of swim trunks, fucking up a Bubble-Head Charm and trying to get the bubble off his ear.
"Harry," Ginny says, full of concern, stepping forward, but Draco steps between them. Ginny, voice like the war, barks, "Get out of the way, Malfoy."
"You're going to love Tetris," Harry says out of the blue, smiling, and Draco kisses him, smiles giving way to insistent lips and roaming, undressing fingers.
Draco lived in a townhouse in Primrose Hill, right near a bunch of upscale Muggle shops and one or two magical places that went unseen by Muggle eyes. It was only a short walk to the park, which, when he moved in, would be a step up from Harry's current morning walk route.
"Draco!" the young Potters chorused, and Lily threw her arms around his neck. It was strange that he was used to that—that this brilliant, fiery young woman wanted to hug him, to treat him as an auxiliary parent figure. He squeezed, and then she was gone as fast as she'd appeared.
Harry moved his hand from where he was bracing himself on the hearth and scrubbed it through his hair. He'd been trying to get Albus alone to talk to him for weeks, but it was proving nearly impossible to get him away from Scorpius. But Harry really wanted to talk to Albus alone, to make sure Albus was okay with his dad dating his father-in-law. He didn't really think Albus (or Scorpius) would have a problem with it (and surely Draco would never have conceived of this wild plan if he thought it would be a problem for their sons), but at the same time he really needed to actually
By the time he arrived at the front door, he'd managed to clear his mind a bit. Walking always helped.
Draco squeezed Harry's hand. "I saw the worst of the war, like Harry did. The only difference is that I was a coward while Harry was brave. I only hope the people of Magical Britain can accept my life's work as penance for all the pain in which I was implicated."
Draco turned, and their faces, bent over the butterflies, were very close. “Not everything that’s wonderful is magic, Potter.”
"Wait, everyone at RAMag who went to Hogwarts?" Harry asks, suddenly realising that means Hermione wants to invite Malfoy to their flat.
"Yes," Harry said, affecting a serious tone, "it's part of how to keep the romance alive. I'm an expert at it."
He and Ginny had a flat in Southwark for a while, and then they'd bought a house in Holyhead, near Ginny's work. When he and Gin had split, he needed a place large enough for three kids and he had almost wished he'd held onto Grimmauld. Instead, he'd found this house in Finchley. It was a nice-enough house with bedrooms for everyone, a practical kitchen, and a little garden where he and his kids had played games of low-flying Quidditch. Every inch of it was written with memories.
“I was looking out for your well-being,” Harry corrects. “Merlin knows you won’t look after it yourself. Hiccoughing for three straight days, no end in sight.”
Just what they need—acute sickness on top of all the grief, funerals, and post-war weirdness. He wonders if his immune system will be able to fight off whatever she has. It can't be particularly robust right now. He's only just started to feel well-fed again.
“You’re imagining us introducing skateboards to the magical world. When we finish school.” Harry laughed, bursting with incredulity.
"What?!" Draco knew his rising intensity could only escalate the situation, but he couldn't help it. "What are you talking about?! You told me you liked
As Teddy made for  the kitchen, Harry only just suppressed a dramatic groan. It wasn't a great feeling to have no idea what you want, but to have everyone around you think you know
"A test? I didn't know there was going to be a test! Which spell would I need. I only practiced the ones that were in the school books, but does it rely on more of an improvisational tone? Is it altered to fit each student, or would it be the same throughout? Is it a duel or practical?" She rambled on, seemingly to herself. Draco nudged her shoulder.
at some point i might share my more public insta where I could post updates in case this fic gets anymore traction because OVER 4400 HITS????? WHAT YOU GUYS ARE GREAT!!!!
“Great deduction Potter, aren’t you clever. Impeccable Latin skills.” He sarcastically congratulated him. “On another note, have you thought of your favour yet?”
“Uh...sure then. Okay. That’s fine. Fine and dandy. Perfectly adequate. That is so okay with me, I am cool with it, it’s fine...” he continued as he walked back into the bathroom.
“Cheers to that!” Potter crowed. “To getting sloshed!” Draco tapped his cup against Potter’s before they both downed it.
Please leave a kudo and a comment, they are so appreciated! What you thought of this chapter, constructive criticisms, and any mini one shot ideas you’d like me to add to another fic I am welcome to! Have a great one, until the next chapter!
“I mean, I guess he’s teaching us something. Regardless, using the Cruciatus in front of Longbottom and the Killing Curse in front of...well, you, probably isn’t a thing he should put on his next resume. Or the fact that he has a habit of turning teenagers into ferrets. Not the best teacher we’ve ever had, in my book at least. Even that werewolf was better...” he began to put his broom away before Potter put a hand on his arm.
“You mean after you wiped the floor with us and stole fifty galleons, 20 sugar quills and 30 chocolate frogs from everyone?” Theo corrected, recalling the gambling hour.
"Come on Tom, you now have your chance to fashion me up. Make me look...Fabulous." I jokingly posed which made him snort and roll his eyes.
"Yeah! Screw Snape! But uh, quick question; what is handflapping?" Michael added, quite unhelpfully.
Turning over in his bunk, Draco faced the wall. If he squinted, he could make out a cloud in the expanse of blue. The blue all around him was a stark reminder of how truly Ravenclaw this was. How Ravenclaw HE was.
Draco wasn't really focusing as he walked with his sister, hands in pockets, kicking up grass. He was lost in his thoughts until an utterly loathsome voice decided to interrupt them.
With a clearer look at Blaise and his outfit, he looked heavily debauched. His jacket was wide open, and a long line of love bites seemed to litter him head to toe.
"I'll catch up with you. I need to say goodbye to Mum and Ginny first." He jerked a thumb behind him to Mrs Weasley.
"Blimey! Going to Hogwarts with the boy who defeated You-Know-Who. Wait...does he...do you have the - the you know..." His voice quietened down to a whisper as he pointed to his forehead. Harry nodded and lifted his fringe, revealing the bolts of lightening that streaked about it, ending behind both of his ears. "Bloody Hell! That's the real deal, that is. That's incredible! And you really got that from battling You-Know-Who?"
Sirius sighed again and sat down on a sofa, while Potter sat down on another, trapping Draco on the floor between them.
“Now I know that in less than a week you will become eighteen. My little Draco will become a man!” She rested her face in her hands and looked at him with what he dubbed her ‘crazy eyes’. “And just in time. I estimate that we will be capturing the Potter boy within the week, and the Dark Lord may rise again!” She nearly swooned. “And what that will mean for you is that you will have the great pleasure of becoming an official death eater! Long overdue if you ask me, but I am so looking forward to you joining the ranks!” Draco smiled widely.
“Don’t call me that! In public or EVER!” She hissed at him like a bedraggled cat, black mascara dripping to the left of he eye.
"Put down the girl!" One of them yelled at him. He obeyed hesitantly, but as soon as he did he was Stupefied and hit the ground.
I hope you enjoyed reading this! Comment if you have any ideas or mini headcanons or meme conversations you'd like me to add as this is pretty chill fic with an open plot to those.
Octavia kind of hoped that she'd see those three Gryffindor students again. They were quite interesting, and they could probably give a different view on Hogwarts as a whole, different to the view her father and Draco shared anyway.
Draco gave his hand a quick squeeze as he walked past him, and Neville gave a grateful smile in return. He walked over to the stool a bit more confidently and put on the sorting hat.
“Draco?” He faintly heard Pansy ask, in the background of his internal conflict. “Professor, he’s going to cry.”
Transfiguration was okay, more enjoyable than the last two had been. McGonagall established the year curriculum for them and they were then tasked with transfiguring multiple materials, such as felt, plastic, wood and metal. The metal was directed to be transfigured into water, which was very difficult for all. No one in the class managed it, though Draco and Blaise managed to transfigure the metal into liquid metal.
“Hey Via!” He walked over to her and tucked the newspaper under his arm. “So what do you want to do?”
"I'm o-okay, I was just about to go onto the Platform for the Hogwarts Express." While they were having their second meeting, Draco could spot the nice woman leading her twins through the platform, leaving only the nervous boy and the excitable little girl.
Sirius rose his head to greet a fist flying into his nose. Thankful for his reflexes, he managed to trap the kid in a headlock and pointed a wand at his back. He then cast some more rope onto the kid’s upper arms. Hopefully high enough so that he wouldn’t be able to burn through them again. Fucking wandless magic!? What kind of batshit training had this kid been through? He didn’t even look a day over twenty, how the fuck did he know wandless magic?!
“I mean, it’s fine I guess. They’re just friends, and we’re just friends so it’s all...cool.” He says awkwardly. Draco sighed.
“Stop it! I was excited to go to Hogwarts to get away from Mother’s pecking! Get off!” She shook away his hand. “Why are you up so early anyway. One wouldn’t think you’d leave your bat cave (AKA your bed) earlier than 10 on a Saturday. What gives?”
“Promiscuous girl, wherever you are,” he spun and changed their positions, “I'm all alone and it's you that I want.” He pointed to her then put a finger over his lips as a shushing motion.
On top of that, classes were getting a bit more intense, and as well as his workload, he had at least half of Greg, Vince and Pansy’s.  Thank Merlin Blaise could handle his workload. He loved those three, but they were terrible procrastinators and had an absolute shit work ethic. And because of his brotherly needs, he was practicing magic and tutoring Octavia as well. She claimed she “didn’t need his help” and that he should “get some sleep” but that was humble poppycock.
“Why’re you stuffing food in your face, is this how Mother raised you?” He asked teasingly, loading a single sandwich onto his plate. He wasn’t that hungry.  She rolled her eyes at him. “So how were you classes?”
He spun round to the music and shook his head side to side. He smirked at Blaise and spun the taller boy. How the tables turn. Blaise grinned widely.
It's size reminded Draco of the manor's ballroom, except instead of a large chandelier, the room was lit with flaming torches. A marble staircase led them all to the upper floors. Draco could hear babbling from further along and deduced that the rest of the school were already there. It would make sense, since only the first years could use the boats across the lake, and they needed a large audience for the sorting.
Draco shook his head. "I'll be fine, it's just a quick thing." He also decided to ignore Blaise's bouncing eyebrows because he was a better person than Blaise.
“Drako! I thought I ‘ad missed you!” Dobromir yelled out and put an arm around Draco which Draco immediately tried to pry off of him.
"My parents were always dead set on Hogwarts because they wanted me to become a Slytherin as they had, and the other schools have different houses. Wanted to live out their nostalgia through me I guess." Pansy said, pouting and crossing her arms. Octavia patted her shoulder pityingly while leaning against Greg.
"Hey! Let him go!" Octavia yelled at Crouch while Draco tried to desperately tell her not to intervene.
Rumours of what had happened in the entrance hall swept throughout the school, and whenever he saw the Golden Trio he got a whispered “ferret” from the Weasel. Which was just plain ridiculous. Weasley was the weasel here, not him. It wasn’t his fault their new DADA teacher was psychotic. So far he’d avoided Snape’s attempts to talk with him about it and had tried to get on with his school life. Primarily the task of getting Octavia friends.
He was still wearing his trousers and socks, but only one shoe (?) and had his tie wrapped around his forehead, mussing up his usually oh so perfect hair. One his stomach in green ink was “THE WEIRD SISTERS” and the cherries on top were his bright pink painted nails and the large bruise on his neck.
Draco nodded and Potter sighed in relief. “Plants that heighten love. Herbs for love potions, Herbology hints on romantic spells,
He would like curly hair. Or at least hair that wasn't supposed to be slicked back all the time. He thinks it made him look like his father, and it gave him terrible cow licks after he washed the gel out. He preferred Narcissa's long hair to Lucius'. It was lovelier, less harsh and perfect.
Once she had changed clothes, some other girls from the dorm came rushing into the room excitedly, gathering around Martha for makeup help. Octavia edged away from them all a bit, not wanting to cramp Martha further. Martha met her eyes and smiled.
He shakily got up and began to pack away his books and parchment. He left the spilt inkwell and quill.
A boy had walked down the stairs. He looked about Draco’s age, and was wearing very baggy and ugly clothing, and donned a pair of unfashionable circular glasses on his face. He was looking at Draco with a lot of surprise and Draco scowled at him.
She shrugged. “Mere curiosity, I suppose.” Now Draco didn’t trust that for a minute, but he accepted it and miserably ate his sandwich.
“Ugh, Felix’s hair is the worst. He never brushes it and has kept using the same shampoo since he was toddler. It looks like a mop at the best of times.”
“I can see things no one else can. If fate won’t do its work, it’s up to me.” Octavia raised an eyebrow at him.
...until a large Durmstrang boy Octavia hadn’t caught the name of fell into Draco’s arms and let out a defeated sob.
"So Potter, back to the castle it is? I expect Granger and the Weasel will be missing their little Golden boy."
"Oh, yeah, they definitely do. My cousin always had piles and piles of presents for Christmas and his birthday. I...didn't. Usually. I mean it's fine, I don't deserve them anyway, and Hagrid shouldn't have spent money on it, I could have paid, it would have been fine but he insisted...I should probably pay him back when I see him again he shouldn't have worried..."
Vince nods. “Thanks Draco, I will.” He stood up and offered his hand for Draco to take. Draco waved it away.
“You didn’t see anything.” He hissed. “It was a one time thing. Tell Blaise that.” He jabbed Draco in the chest and Draco scowled as he remembered why he never really spoke with Theo Nott.
I hope you enjoyed reading this, I'm sorry for the wait that happened, I am writing the next chapter as I post this and it should be out within the next two days. Comment if you have any ideas or mini headcanons or meme conversations you'd like me to add as this is pretty chill fic with an open plot to those.
“Just vait until Dobromir hears about s’is, his blood vill be jealous!” Draco smiled at the dorky phrasing.
“Maybe if you want the anger to stop you should take a leaf out of my book. I seem to be quite popular.” He advised.
I hope you enjoyed that chapter even will all its drama. I mostly used this chapter t set up some arcs that might continue, and the next chapter will either have the badge’s response, possible Ron moments, or even the first task! (Don’t rely on the last one)
"You will be reciting the Pureblood laws backwards while I do this. Stutter or fail to do so. and you will face the consequences." Lucius raised his cane at the ready. The boy nodded.
They were a little bit early, so they got a good choice on seating. Draco asked Octavia whether she'd like to sit further down with the other first years, but she adamantly refused, claiming she wanted to see Pansy, Blaise, Greg and Vince again. Draco knew she had a slight problem with talking to people her own age, being pretty starved of children her age when she was younger. He let her follow him until they found where Pansy was. The other's hadn't arrived yet.
She then tried to compliment him and told him he had pretty eyes. He only smiled and said he got them from his mum. Oblivious.
I hope you enjoyed the chapter! If you don't know about my other fanfic, It's Easier Than Hating, then please check that out it's an Eighth year fic, and if you do know I apologise if chapter updates are a little slower because of me working on this. Your support means the world to me so I hope you have a great day and a great life! Catch you later, BisexualGurrl! xoxo
Narcissa nodded, delighted, and ran to the ice cream shop, nearly knocking someone over in her rushed. Draco sucked in his teeth.
The night of the Yule Ball and Blaise and Draco are drunk. Draco more so. A bit of romance between them plays out.
It's then that Octavia heard Draco mutter, "Mad Eye Moody," fearfully. She gave him a questioning look and he gulped. "A retired Auror. Kind of famous and infamous at the same time. Put a great deal of people in Azkaban, but made a lot of enemies. Became incredibly paranoid. I saw him once when I was younger. He was set to...investigate Father. Someone had reported some suspicious actions. He came to the Manor and nearly turned Father's office upside down. You were just a baby at the time. Scared me to death, but I was only four. He didn't find anything." As he whispered this, his eyes never left Mad Eye's movement. The man had sat down at the teacher's table and it's then that Octavia realised...
The kid tried another spinning kick before Sirius caught the foot mid air, tugged the kid’s leg towards him and cast a sleeping charm, watching as the once confident boy tottered around slightly before falling unconscious.
He’d heard about side effects of excessive use of the Cruciartus Curse on people as well, but refused to acknowledge it. He wasn’t going to St Mungos to become some bedridden Longbottom; a poor victim of the war. He wasn’t that far gone.
This was very contrary to the other three tables, all filled with sadness and anger. This tournament may have been started to promote school unity, but it may destroy any semblance of house unity in the process. Many Slytherins were cursing at the table and each other, feeling the verdict to be very unfair. Some even seemed to be plotting Diggory’s death, and they couldn’t be the only ones.
Potter really ought to learn fashion. He’s in the public eye now! He needs to pick out a higher quality accessory or two. If Draco were a celebrity you wouldn’t see him showing up on the front page of the Prophet looking like Potter does.
“Let’s stay on topic Draco, I can tell you about your own prudishness after we get to the bottom of it.” He waved away Draco’s huffy scowl. “Anyway, since he isn’t embarrassed about that, it’s more about who he hung out with on the quidditch pitch. May I please call Miss Parkinson to the stand?” Pansy pushed Blaise out of the way and stared down Draco.
“Okay, I no longer wish to be carried by you. Put me down, I’ll limp my way to Pomfrey.” He told the smirking idiot and struggled a bit in his grip.
They met their parents outside the tent and they decided to set off towards the pitch down the softly lit path. As a unit of Malfoys, they had to present themselves with poise, elegance, sophistication and wealth. So they kept their heads high, their noses higher, and their name known. They were set to be in the top box alongside the Minister, who in Octavia's opinion looked and acted like a bumbling idiot. Draco agreed with her, but he couldn't be as opinionated and open as she could. He was the heir to the Malfoy fortune, she was a prize to married off later in life. Sure her half was drearier, but there was more pressure on him. Ever the stupid big brother, he always took the hit for her and took the brunt of Malfoy responsibility.
Potter nodded before throwing his head back and downing it. He grimaced again before it must’ve taken effect, as he smiled in ease.
“But what about that girl from the summer? You’ve been bragging about it since September! And what about that girl on Halloween? You said you and Carrie snogged in the defence classroom?” Draco questions him. Blaise shrugged.
Professor McGonagall put out a wooden stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a large pointed wizard's hat. This one was old and dusty, looking to fall apart at the seams at any moment. The sorting hat, Draco realised.
"At the World Cup me and Octavia saw some Beauxbatons students," Draco mentioned casually. "It reminded me of how Mother wanted to send me there. Of course, Father wanted to send me to Durmstrang, because of it's love of the...the Dark Arts." He stumbled over that phrase and immediately felt the urge to scratch at his forearm. He pushed that urge away and continued. "Instead of only Defense, it also teachers Dark Magic to students, to understand all areas of it. The manor has a lot of material on it, but Hogwarts is far too vanilla to except that. Of course, he also wanted to send me there due to it's hate of Mu-" he swiftly remembered Octavia was in the carriage, "-uh, muggleborns. Very pureblood at Durmstrang. But Mother didn't like the idea of me going to a school too far away anyway, so they agreed on Hogwarts." He explained. Blaise nodded.
“How dare you. You’re the nerd.” He argued, shifting so Pansy’s boobs wouldn’t be in his face as she leaned towards Blaise, both still doing a practically scripted scene.
“Don’t remind me.” He glanced at his cup. “I think I’m getting a little bit drunk. Do you know what it’s like to be drunk?” He asked.
"Huh." Draco thought for a moment. "That's interesting." A new source on information. Neurodevelopmental disorders and mental illnesses were topics buried well in the library and archives. He'd heard of the shunning that occurred if any baby showed signs that it was 'lesser' in any way. Usually a mercy kill. Quick and easy. Even if it were an ancient practice, it was proficient, because that is how a Malfoy should be. Those were usually the stories that he got if he ever asked his father for a bedtime story. Nightmare fuel with a vaguely threatening message, the message usually being 'if you mess up, you're next on the chopping block'.
Draco’s hands immediately went to his head and found that his hair was floating above his hand in haphazard locks.
“Not yet!” She scolded. “And not if you still want to duet with me later!” Blaise backed away with his hands up in a surrender.
“I was wondering if your beautiful self could pick up the alcohol.” He booped Draco’s nose. He scrunched it uncomfortably. “Just from the kitchens. The bottles will be laid out on a table with the label ‘for Blaise Zabini’. You can’t miss it.”
"-that's not even including the incredible medicinal properties of crocodile vines, though the reason they aren't used as much in potions is because of the sheer mass needed for a proper reaction. They're very rare, and subsequently very expensive, as they can only be found in specific areas of the Amazon, although I heard the scientist Millie Fensworth is learning how to grow them in captivity. Isn't that great?! Just imagine what-" The other three boys had tuned him out by then. Terry looked oddly calm, and hadn't had a physical reaction for the entire lesson. Draco looked over to him, and realised that he was now holding Anthony's hand. The position of his wrist looked a bit uncomfortable, but Anthony looked to be okay with it.
Harry sighs. "I know. Want to sit?" He gestures at the other side of the booth. "Somehow seems less awkward than each sitting alone at different tables, pretending not to realise the other is there."
Draco looks over his shoulder to look at Harry reclined on the bed, and Harry shakes his head. "It's not
Harry closed his eyes, wondering how this was his life. When he opened his eyes, Draco had turned around, and Harry watched his shoulders shaking with laughter.
The witch in between them looked back and forth at them, shuffling the cards in her hands all the while.
Harry wasn't going to say anything to scare Draco off the leftist agenda, but he couldn't help but muse delightedly that Draco, for all he called himself a centrist, was few leagues left of centre these days.
"Do you ever feel," Harry asked, pulling his lips away from Draco's, "like your life is just beginning? Even though you're 55? Wait, no, 56."
"Does Albus routinely make you feel like you've committed a complete betrayal of the left?" Harry whispered. "Or is that just me."
Malfoy pressed into Harry's space, and he was kissing back. Heat rushed to Harry's face and chest and he reached forward to touch Draco with no real plan of where his hand would land, just wanting to touch him somewhere. It landed on his shoulder and Harry pressed his fingertips into Draco's skin.
“We all could’ve done things differently,” Harry said, trying to suppress the imagination that was trying to run wild in his brain.
Draco slumped forward over the table. "It's not the sex," he said, and once he'd started the thought, the Veritaserum dragged the rest of it from him, "it's the love. Or maybe it's the sex combined with the love. I'm not sure—it's possible I've been in love with you for a long time, on some level. But there was no intimacy there, so it was easy to hold the feelings at wand's length. But I'm only human! I can't keep it under control with you looking into my eyes while you orgasm all over me!"
I turn, incredulous, and smile at him. I can't help it. I'm not being safe. I'm not protecting myself. I'm smiling. "It worked."
"Thanks," Malfoy says, rubbing his hand on his stomach. "And thanks for the fuck, Potter. I needed that."
Harry raised his shoe. It was…true enough. He'd brought it up. Although it had been Draco's idea, hadn't it? He lifted Draco's, too, and everyone in the room started laughing.
"You'll forgive my saying," Wilhelm said as he inspected the spot on the wooden tree that his axe routinely hit, "you have been thinking of little else for the past few days. You thought of the ceremony at least five times, so you must at least've been thinkin' about it."
"You know how Twycross in Magical Games and Sports has been keeping a tally of how many days in a row Smoot wears the turquoise robes?"
Harry'd never been sure who the "us" in that sentence was, but he'd worn the cutoffs. (He'd had to Transfigure his boxers into briefs.)
Harry lets his cheek drop to his hand and, amused, motions for Malfoy to ask away. This is his life now: Muggle consultant to Draco Malfoy.
Ron and Harry were well-matched Auror partners, too. The difference was, they spent most of their time trying to avoid extra work, and a small percentage of their time jumping into dangerous situations to stop bad guys. You couldn’t pay Harry or Ron to care about punctuation, and in fact, Robards had tried. He’d claimed it was part of their job—that their reports needed to follow the Ministry Style Guide, whatever that was.
Albus was pacing; Scorpius was sat in an uncomfortable-looking chair bouncing his legs at an alarming rate. Ginny and Astoria stood leaning against the wall, smiling and talking.
Harry picked up his burger and took a large bite; sauce dripped down his chin and he reached for a napkin.
"I keep telling both of you," Harry says, "I'm not getting in the middle of it." He's happy his friends are finally together, he really is, but honestly. He can't deal with all that.
The next week, Hermione's doing a crossword while Harry pulls his hair out reading a bunch of forms and brochures the Royal Academy of Magic sent over.
When we've finished, I can't stop staring. "This is one of the worst things I've ever had the misfortune to see."
"Supposing that, on the first day this law is in effect, the head of the DMLE goes to work in non-Western attire?" Harry asked, leaning back, his shoulder bumping Albus's.
"It—it brought up a lot of feelings for me. I was worried about the baby not being wanted and what that meant about
They stared at each other. Draco didn't want to be the first to ask something, not with them both hopped up on truth serum. He knew himself—he had no self control around Harry. He'd end up asking something completely irrelevant and inappropriate, just because he could. And the truth serum had not been his idea! Let Harry be the one to talk first.
Harry stands, wobbles (still drunk, he notes), his sticky hand held aloft, kicking at the clothes littering the floor in the hope of uncovering one of their wands. "We are definitely alive."
Harry watches the boys in question as they raise their arms up, flick their wrists, and slide their arms to the side. "Erm, yes, I venture we could learn this dance."
“Well,” Draco says, trying to retain some level of composure, “I thought I was going to die. It was a very dramatic time. And we were young and hormonal.”
Harry gasped, sitting upright. "Is the baby okay?" He jumped out of bed, tripping over the shoes they'd left haphazard on the floor last night. He fell, catching himself before he hit the floor but slammed his thigh on the night table. "Fuck!"
Teddy nodded, his intensity growing. "Yes! Exactly! People who are invested in the gender and sexuality binaries can handle people being gay or straight—because those orientations both assume the binary. But if someone is bi or pan or queer, that assumes a
"I don't need your money," Harry said, holding up one finger. "I only speak one language so I'm not sure why your being able to speak languages I don't understand would be considered a selling point." Two fingers. "And how does your doing yoga benefit me?"
Malfoy opens his mouth, then closes it. "This is literally true of any two or more people who are in the same place at the same time. This has been true every time we've seen each other for the past few weeks."
"The boys are freaking out so much, you'd think it was their bodies being ripped apart," Ginny said, a fond twinkle in her eyes.
"Well," Hermione says, looking up from her computer, "we're really close to RAMag, so any of the clubs right around here are probably filled with other students. Classes start tomorrow, after all."
Draco reclined Aster, her head nuzzled in his right elbow, and raised the bottle to her mouth. Once she started suckling, he turned back to Harry. "Yes, you're right. Alright. I think I'm already doing that, but I'll double check."
“You said ‘we made plans,’ not ‘we’re going.’ That wording seems to suggest that you don’t think you’ll actually go. Or you’re giving yourself an out.”
That's doable. Nothing has ever been casual with Malfoy, has it? "It's not casual," Harry echoes, nodding.
"Nothing, I—everything is good with him! He just—I don't know. We need to make decisions about how much we want our lives to tangle together." She paused, fiddling with her cup. "He's finishing his yoga teacher training, you know, and we both have jobs—are we going to move in together? When he's searching for better jobs, does he apply in other cities or not? Do I consider going with him? It's just—you know. Life."
Harry glared. "So the solution to having feelings is to run away from them? Is that what you'd tell Scorpius to do?"
"Right," Draco said eventually. "It's perfect." Then he frowned and waved his wand, changing the frame.
Draco turned to look at Harry, his grey eyes looking for something in a way that made Harry feel uncomfortable.
As they near the top of the rocket escalator, Malfoy turns, his face a rictus of horror. Harry springs into action, pushing past Malfoy so he's a few steps ahead just as it reaches the top, and he models how to step off. Merlin, the last thing Harry needs is someone to hit the emergency stop on the escalator because a posh wizard has no Muggle skills!
Draco sighed. He let go of his briefcase and it soared through the air into a cupboard, then pointed his wand at his feet and his oxfords disappeared, replaced with a pair of slippers. "Rump is an arsekettle."
Malfoy turned to Harry, looking mutinous. "You've hit me in the head and lost me my spot in the queue. Are you trying to ruin my day, or is that just a nice side benefit?"
Lily stands up at that, as does Scorpius. But it seems that it’s still too slow, as James moves as if to shove Albus, and their dad looking absolutely thunderous as he holds his oldest son back. Lily unconsciously recoils back, and even Albus looks startled but stubbornly stands still. She has never seen their dad angry, but now, she finally believes that this man is indeed the one who killed a dark lord in his teens. Then, as if he only realises just then who he’s standing against, Harry looks as if slapped.
He doesn’t think he can put his mind to work today, not as long as he keeps going back to think about yesterday’s disaster.
Draco sighs, leaning his head to the wall behind him. Harry's eyes catch sight of the highlights of his bare throat, watching it bobbing as Draco swallows.
"Blaise says he wants us to go on a trip to Italy," Draco says, turning to face Theo. They are currently standing in front of said restaurant, waiting for Theo's ride to pick him up. "Will you be coming?"
"Of course you will. I'll scream bloody murder until the Aurors come here by my voice alone and drag you back here to me, if you leave."
There is an uncharacteristic cynical jab in Scorpius’ tone when he says again, “It was himself that he killed, wasn’t it?”
Draco, still startled from his own sudden instinct, startles even more. He snaps his head towards the voice and feels his blood drain out. "Harry?" He whispers, then very slowly lifts his gaze to the restaurant's big, shining, colourful title. It is the restaurant where Harry was having the dinner meeting. He looks back to Harry again, who is standing just outside the door.
Draco’s lips, but he pulls away shortly. He opens his eyes; Draco’s closed. And when it finally opens, a curtain of haze covers.
"This is.." she trails on, in awe. Albus snatches the photo, and Hugo almost jumps towards Albus if Rose had not held him still. Lily turns to Scorpius to find that her brother is already watching her.
Lily feels her blood run out of her face, and Albus has gone rigid beside her. Scorpius is holding her hand so tightly it hurts, but at the moment, she doesn't notice.
"And then I started thinking about marriage, because I realised I never really did. And then I thought I don't even need marriage, because I'm too busy anyway." Harry says, then sighs pitifully.
“Yes, I guess I did,” she says, absently combing through her long hair. “Though my grandmother said mine is a shade darker. His was almost white, platinum.”
When Blaise steps outside his bedroom, Pansy turns back and says, "Theo has returned to London, I believe he also wants to settle down. I'll tell him to reach out to you, if you don't mind?"
Draco glances at his wrist watch, letting out a small huff as he absently touches the glass of frozen hot chocolate, cold water droplets from the glass dampen his palm. He had gone off work early, having nothing else to do and Harry only had dinner with a president of another company for the day. And then Theo had contacted him, asking if he was free for coffee, and Draco agreed.
it happened. Now that he knows how sleeping while holding Draco in his arms feels like, he's not exactly sure if he would live with the fact that he won't spend the rest of his life not doing
They're in their usual bar, where they have their weekly drink since university. Also where they go when at least one of them wants to get wasted but still wants to go home in one piece - today is Harry's turn. All of the waiters recognise them at this point, even going as far as having a few secret signals between them. For the normal days, they'd go to the bar and refill their drinks themselves. For
Draco's voice is soft when he answers. “Fighting a war is hard, bearing the consequences of the aftermath is harder. A survivor of the wrong side of the war, no less.”
It's silent for a minute, them staring straight at each other and standing very closely. Harry barely registers the low noises of other passing people behind him because–
“No,” he says to himself, straightening his posture. He narrows his eyes to his reflection on the dark computer screen. “Time to put your charming personality to good use.”
apologies for the delay, i was unsure as to how to end the story and i am still not satisfied with this yet but here it is
Albus blinks, and nods. He clears his throat rather loudly, a touch too dramatic that it catches all the other three attention.
Harry glares at his pint, drinks the beer with large gulps, and glares again at the empty glass. Ron exchanges looks with Hermione; he shrugs, and she sighs. Ron waves a hand at a waiter, signaling with his fingers the number three and two at them and receiving a thumbs up in return.
“I don't think I ever did,” he answers softly. “He was born into the war, on the opposite side of the war. Maybe I didn't understand back then, but now that I know what it feels like to have a family that you love...” he trails off.
Harry lowers his chin, a small smile on his lips. Dazzling green, green eyes lights up at him. He softly says, "Come, I'll get you home."
“Oh,” he says intelligently. Draco looks unamused. “That's nice to hear but apparently I ate something wrong at breakfast and I need to excuse myself at this not right moment.”
“Please, you have to know that I mean it. I value your work and you have done a stunning job for the past seven years. But you- Draco, you have done something that no one else has ever done to my heart. You must understand that you have not taken my heart;
"Yes, Sir," Draco replies absently, tapping the screen. Then he takes out a file of paper he was carrying on his arm and places it on Harry's table. "This is the proposal for the acquisition of Emerald Cavern Hotel."
They're sitting on the carpeted floor in Draco's living room, leaning their backs on the sofa. Sitting very closely, nearly touching. A bottle of red wine opened on the coffee table in front of them already half empty.
It is true. Lily looks back at the picture again, and her father smiles at her. Scorpius has the most similar colour of his blond hair, though Scorpius' is almost curly as their dad's while their father was only a little wavy. Also inheriting his grey eyes. Albus has their dad's dark hair and green eyes, though his hair is not as messy as Scorpius or Dad's.
“No,” he says quickly, a small smile appears on his lips for a second before it disappears again. “That you miss him. Father.”
Draco blinks at her. He and Theodore Nott were college sweethearts, meeting as freshmen and dated through university until Theo had to go away for work. They had tried long distance relationship but with somewhat exhausting different time zones, they eventually lost.
“Rivals to lovers are a popular trope, you understand,” James drawls, crossing his arms across his chest.
Draco carefully places the bouquet on an empty corner of his desk, offers a stiff smile when Harry catches his eyes from inside, and very discreetly dives for his phone.
His best friends slump on their respective seats. Hermione finally finishes her first pint. Ron groans and mutters something along the lines of
“He's only second to Hermione. But that charms work made her more mad than she was about his insults for me. He also took one step further to write a song specially to insult Ron's ability in playing Quidditch.”
Later, Draco will wake up with Harry still in the same place. Silently, patiently playing with Draco's fingers. Harry will kiss him, and he will drown in happiness, feeling content. The kids will wake up and crowd his bed, and they will eat together. and then, they will go back home a family of six, complete at last.
"No need," Harry says with a wave of his hand, then proceeds to nod at him and heads into his office.
They haven't talked to Scorpius about the idea for when they get home. Lily nudges Albus with her heel, and after getting an annoyed glare, nods her head towards Scorpius who's in a conversation with Hugo.
She takes it, and looks. It is a photo of a young man leaning on a  short wall, behind him a view of a river and a bridge. He's smiling at someone behind the camera, genuine and soft, and his grey eyes are twinkling. He looks happy and very much in love. The wind blows, but his white blond hair just falls artfully across his face. He blinks, and smiles even wider. It is clear that the man was simply unable to not look good.
Harry doesn't reply and takes another shot. Ron and Hermione let him. They both stay silent until the first bottle of liquor is halfway finished - until Harry is tipsy enough.
But her steps pauses when she sees Scorpius standing beside the door of their parents’ room, she’d call him cheerfully if he hadn’t moved to put a hand over her mouth. She frowns, but Scorpius nods his head towards the slightly ajar door.
Harry and Ron quickly drain their second pint. Hermione rolls her eyes, still nursing her first. Ron pours the liquor to three smaller glasses, and Harry and he immediately takes the first shot.
Harry only laughs at him, and kisses his nose. Draco scrunches his nose after, and pouts. Then he announces that he's hungry and demands Harry take him to the most obnoxious restaurant in Paris he can find.
And so dinner they go. Theodore Nott is an obnoxious brat; he picks a Michelin-starred restaurant, because,
Harry raises his eyebrows. Draco seems to only now process what happened, and a pretty hue of red flushes on his pale cheeks.
"All right," he says, and leans down to dramatically place a kiss on Draco's cheek. "Goodnight, darling. Thank you for dinner."
When he steps out of the elevator and his gaze falls to the empty desk across the door of his office, Harry feels even more pathetic. He forces to look away and walks inside his office, slumping in his seat but not moving to turn on the computer.
Here is the thing. She had a thousand times of practice, delivering the same answer every time someone new asked her. She should answer with practiced ease. And yet, this time she pauses. Various notes and books from her first year that are laid out on the table for her tutoring suddenly become a blur.
"He looks just like him," the lady says, and stares at Scorpius who looks uncomfortable for another short moment, then to Albus. "This one's a copy of you," before sweeping her eyes to Lily. "Hello, dear."
Harry quirks an amused smile. "Yes, that's good as well." he says, furrowing his thick eyebrows. He has grown facial hairs since the last time Lily had seen him, framing his jaw and around his mouth. He's still very handsome, even if he now has a permanent weary look on him. "Are you guys hungry? Should we go eat somewhere?"
"And it was you that cooked for him and the kids, it was you that took care of him and the kids. You taught the kids how to walk, you took them to play and kept them safe when he wasn't feeling well. And you hung on and kept taking care of your kids,” Hermione says. "You might not know how to sing, how to teach your kids potions or- or things. You don't have to know everything to be a good parent, you know."
, if he might mention. But as he registers that he’s kissing Draco Malfoy, he feels as if all his breath has been taken away.
“Hey,” Harry says, softly. He places a hand over Draco’s, sensing the way Draco stiffen when he did. “What I said yesterday, I mean it.”
"There aren't a lot of things to do when your supposed enemy doesn't really do anything besides studying."
It is five past ten when there is a knock at the door. Harry looks up to see Draco already walking towards him with a tablet in his hand. On his left wrist is his usual expensive silver-green watch - which Harry learnt is a
Draco is leaning his head to Harry’s palm, tilting a little to the side. Harry moves forward again, this time with more force and crushes their lips together. Draco is pushed backwards, Harry getting on his knees and nudging Draco’s to make it part way for him.
"Did you only wake up just now?" She asks. "Have you finally fallen ill? Wait for me, I'll go to you right now."
Harry smiles at him, then takes a nostalgic look around the shop. "Your father and I used to go here a lot ever since we graduated from Hogwarts."
Harry lifts his hand to James' nape, caressing the short hairs before his neck. "I miss all of you too."
They end up in a small restaurant on the side of Muggle London, Harry apparating back and forth twice with two of them each at a time. There's a nice old lady at the cashier and a young woman as the waitress.
There's a soft noise coming from Draco, and his blond head looks up to look at him. "You're very… creative with your imagination, you know that, Potter?"
Ron doesn’t return Hermione’s stare. He takes another shot instead. Well, sure, he had said it offhandedly. He’s pretty sure he meant it as a joke, but
There is a small sob that escapes Harry, and Lily has her brows furrowed as she tries not to cry again.
There is no calculating gaze, but Draco’s eyes seem to examine Harry as whole. He hopes whatever Draco finds he realises that this is true when Draco gently jerks back, looking startled. Draco is still not saying anything.
Harry shakes his head sadly. "I asked. It's not the salary, not the hours, nor something I did. And he's not exactly a liar when struck with a chance to diss me."
“Draco,” her dad’s voice is slightly disapproving. “Come on, love. You’re tired. I'll hold you all night, okay?”
"I think I might fancy him," Harry says. While his two best friends freezes, Harry blinks at them. As the silence grows longer and weirder, it seems to sober Harry up. His eyes widen as he says, "Oh."
Harry remembers a head snuggling even closer to his chest, warm and comfortable. Home. He feels at ease.
"It's not fair," she whispers finally, into the tense air of the compartment. "You might have more memories of him. I only have blurs of moments."
Draco turns to look at him, tilting his head a little to the side. He looks awfully young and innocent like this; his Slytherin tie loose and the upper buttons open, a glimpse of the pale collarbones Harry absolutely doesn’t stare at when he first noticed, his white-blond hair falling into his eyes and framing his face. There’s softness instead of the sarcastic sneer and sharpness Harry had associated him with for the last seven years. The sunlight from outside shines onto his figure, and he looks very lovely.
She watches as Harry takes the picture with trembling fingers— he isn't crying, but she thinks she has never seen such a heartbreaking scene until this. He hasn't moved on then, she thinks.
“Yes.” She answers immediately, stomach fluttering at the idea. All this time, she had wolf down every bit of information and fond memories of their father as if starving. But it was as if the world was keeping her in the dark, no one willing to answer her questions, no one willing to talk about Father for hours.
Harry glances between his best friends, then at his empty glass. He opens his mouth, Ron and Hermione look strangely expectant.
Both of his friends stare at him, turn to stare at each other, then back at him. Draco raises an eyebrow, then sighs.
Draco looks like he's deep in thought, a wistful look is his expression. Shadow of the rain droplets decorating his face, skin pale as the room is dark save from the lights outside, shoulders hunch as his oversized jumper stays a little disheveled, shirt's collar tucked inside unbuttoned and Harry can almost see his collarbones. Loose strands of platinum hair falls upon his eyes, its brightness still rivalling the moon – it somehow makes him look fragile.
Harry turns, strips of lights from the street highlighting Draco's features. Soft glow yellow light, the shadow of his long lashes on his pink cheeks. He must be cold, Harry thinks.
"She should have," Lily agrees. “But she never seems to really like us so much. Look! This must be when they graduated from Hogwarts.” She points to the picture on the first page. There’s two teenagers, standing so close to each other. One was wearing the Gryffindor robes, and he had his arms around the waist of the other one who wore Slytherin robes. They weren’t looking at the camera, but at each other instead. Their foreheads pressed together, their wind-blown messy hair tangled over each other, somehow contrasting perfectly.
"School is fine." Scorpius says. Harry almost jumps at his voice, and turns around from the sink. He seems to be surprised and confused seeing the four of his children standing beside each other on the kitchen door.
Draco sighs, a fond, pleased feeling swells through his heart at the sound of his childhood friend. He hasn't noticed how much he missed his friends until now.
"I miss this," James says quietly after they all finish eating and the laughter has died down. "I miss all of you, really."
"It's not because something Potter did to you that you haven't told us, is it?" Blaise asks quietly.
“You won't blame him," James says sternly. Harry's hand flutters towards him, but James shakes his head and says softly, "I got this."
Draco squeezes their hands, back arching upwards, and Harry retracts one of his hands to wrap around Draco's waist.
"Seven years ago," he says. She takes note of how it wasn't only Harry or James that stiffen, but also Scorpius. "What actually happened to him?"
Draco widens his eyes but quickly schools it into a smug expression. "I did hear that right. You admit I am brilliant."
“Still, I’m sorry. You can take another day off tomorrow.” Harry offers apologetically, looking at Draco with a sheepish grin. “ I promise I won’t be drunk tomorrow.”
Draco glances at Theo, who's staring at him with an indescribable expression. "Yes, an old friend of mine just returned to London," he says.
And Harry thinks it's the wine because next he answers, "You're the most important person in my life."
“No,” Albus stands up suddenly, and everyone turns to look at him. “I understand, trust me, I do. it’s absolutely clear that the
"It means you have grown even more beautiful." Theo says, then he smiles briefly before sipping Draco's drink again. "And I must know, Draco," he lifts his chin from his hand and leans closer. "Pansy said you plan to settle down. Perhaps you are seeing someone at the moment?"
I hope you enjoyed this chapter! I was going to make this longerbut I will simply add on another chapter later on to try and give you more regular updates. If you would like me to post longer chapters with more waiting time, or are okay with the system I'm working with now, please let me know. If you have any ideas you'd like me to add in please let me know as I am open to suggestions. Stay safe in quarantine amigos, I hope ou're coping well, I send my best wishes to you my readers!
"Oh haven't you heard? Pansy and I are dating! Isn't that right honey?" He draped himself over Pansy, pretending to swoon.
"That's enough, Draco," A sharp voice interrupted the boys recitation. The boy stopped his pacing back and forth. Lucius stood up swiftly his robes falling to the ground in dramatic fashion, a cane in one hand. He moved towards the boy, towering over him as he circled.
Potter responded by grabbing a book from behind himself and opening in turn. Draco glanced at the cover and snorted.
Potter was inching ahead, a look of pure determination on his face. But Draco ploughed forward. He willed the broom to pick up speed as it careened down the pitch. He pushed his body weight forward and eventually it began pulling ahead of Potter.
He then shook Blaise slightly to wake him up. “C’mon Michael Jackson, time to get up.” Blaise groaned loudly.
"Yeah, that's not going to work." I stared at Malfoy aghast. What had he done?! Hermione's face pinched slightly in anger.
"Do you know about the recent discovery of a new kind of sentient Myosotis variety? Apparently they can sing." Neville asked Michael.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “I will be if you stop being such a snack thief!” She batted his hand away again. Blaise pouted.
Aunt Bella’s face pinched slightly. “Yes yes, a mother figure of course, but do never call me as such.” At his questioningly gaze she smiled tightly. “Makes me feel old. Stick with Auntie if you please.” She let him out of her embrace and sat to the side of her chair, rapping her fingers on the table. “What was it you were saying earlier, about practising transfiguration? What spell are you having trouble with?”
After a couple of tense moments, Moody entered the room. Draco froze. The robotic eye was focused solely on him. He told them to put their books away, and the Slytherins did so with great reluctance, while a couple of the Gryffindors began to look excited.
“So wouldn’t you be far more grown up now?” She batted her eyelashes. “And mature?” She drew circles on his arm with one manicured nail.
Light was going through the sack so he could determine that it was at least daytime. He had to plan to get out of there.
“Ah, but I am old-er. Older than you lot. Now go away, there’s no way I’m letting my little sister get drunk.” He ruffled her hair and her scowl deepened.
After a short telling off and spiel about subtlety, he allowed them to drag him out of bed at far too early a time on a Saturday to have breakfast.
“Why would you? It’s romance! And! And, and, and I saw Greg helping Vince with his tie the other day!”
“Why are you in Grimmauld place? And if you’re the Malfoy kid, why can I get through the wards? I would think that you’d be considered ‘precious goods’.”
I'd never seen him without walls up. His face usually seemed so neutral and impassive, his most popular expression a sneer. As he slept, I can't say he looked completely at ease, but his features were more expressive than when he was awake. He had a slight scowl on his face, a little pout with his bottom lip protruding outward, his brows furrowed ever so slightly. It was kind of...cute? In the way that a puppy dog is cute or something, not attractive cute. If that. He wasn't anywhere close to puppy dog cute. More...dainty. Yeah, dainty. He had very small dainty features.
"Dammit no, let me pay!" I tried to run after him, but it was too late, the Galleons were on the desk.
“Call me Viktor. Goodbye Drako. Until ve next see one another.” Viktor waved goodbye. Draco nearly swooned.
“They’re well written! The whole point of them is that they’re supposed to garner sympathy and emotional attachment from the reader!” He defended badly. Thank god the common room was empty.
"Nothing darling, you can go back to bed." Lucius tried ordering her with a tensely gentle voice. Narcissa's eyes drifted over to Draco, from his frazzled hair to his bloody arms. She cocked her head at the blood on the carpet.
Draco glanced upwards over the large book and saw Potter looking at him pensively. As he was caught, Potter quickly turned his gaze back towards his own book. Draco furrowed his brow in confusion but continued to read.
“Yeah? What of it?” The two of his stared at him, daring him to admit to his discomfort. He blew a strand of hair out his eye with a huff.
“Dance with me, you ponce!” He yelled over the music and grabbed Draco’s hand to spin him round and make him dizzy. “Boorrrn in the U-K, I was, boorrrn in the U-K!” He sang loudly, encouraging others. Draco rose an eyebrow as he bobbed to the music.
"Oh Harry, we've been looking for you! I told you that you should invest in a phone you know. It would be so much easier and less flashy than sending around Patronuses, and would take less power. They can be used in the muggle world inconspicuously, and would integrate more advanced technology into Wizard society. I mean, I love the Wizarding World, but it does lay the aesthetic on a bit thick, don't you think? Practicality is key for moving forward, so no wonder Wizarding Britain lacks so much of it..." She carried on discussing with me about integrating technology and blah blah blah. I say discuss, but it was a sure fire one sided Hermione information blather if I'd ever heard one. And I had. Multiple times. At this point my brain had switched off quite a bit so I couldn't find it in me to tune in a whole lot.
“Whatever. Point is, where did you go? You said you were going to go common room but we got here and you were nowhere to be found! What happened?”
You know the drill, if you like it and haven’t yet pls give a kudo, if you wanna be reminded of updates then bookmark or subscribe, and to help me fuel my shit work ethic for faster chapters, any comments are always appreciated!
A blurry figure with really soft hands carefully puts my glasses on my face. I take a second to take in my surrounding's and see Malfoy sitting at the edge of my bed with wild eyes and mussed black hair, his hand on my knee. He's staring at me intently and his mouth is moving and he's making words and talking to me and-
“Thank you Potter, I’d nearly forgotten what had happened two minutes ago, your service is truly noble.” He told him in a deadpan.
"Ugh! Snape is such a jerk!" Anthony yelled out, slamming his hands on the table. The usually calm and sensible boy was looking as angry as he did during his fight with Hermione. "He's over dramatic, grumpy, leans over your shoulder when you try to focus, takes points off injured students, and yells at students for handflapping of all things! You should allowed to be yourself Terry!" He told the smaller boy, whose face lit up even more at Anthony's pronouncement.
“Suuuurrrrreeee.” Blaise leaned over Draco and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder. “I do have an actual question though.”
Speak of the devil, as Octavia walked down the halls of Hogwarts she saw her brother doing the same. He was walking towards her with his head titled downwards, slight bitterness painted all over his face.
"Don't compare your pain. I mean, my parents did die, but at least the person who did it got defeated...by me? I guess? And at least I know why he did it. Light vs Dark. I agree that not knowing would be terrible."
I am halfway through the next chapter for Double Trouble I SWEAR! I am so sorry about my update schedule but I am making progress and have been writing a drarry Rapunzel AU in my meantime but besides the point I hope you enjoy whatever this is!
“As long as the ickle firsties, second years and third years leave eventually so we can do stuff, that’s fine.”
"I suppose you're right." She admitted, smoothing our her hair and standing up straight in an attempt to look more dignified.
"Uh, Malfoy, do you mind letting g-" He yanked back his hand before I had the chance to finish my sentence and turned around to grab his own bag.
"Potter, get up or I'm locking you out of our dorm!" I opened my eyes again to Malfoy's face right up in my mine. A shock to say the least.
“What...am I doing......what...?” Draco muttered as he took in his surroundings. “Why...don’t I have my shirt on? And why is my stomach painted on...in green? And did Pansy paint...my nails?” He continued to mutter questions to himself as he got out of his bed, gripping his head.
“Lead the way Parkinson.” She threw an arm around his shoulder and walked him up to the ‘stage’. She left him there to go and whisper something to the person controlling the black box and he smiled. She returned to Draco with two microphones and handed him one.
Once he sat, he bounced experimentally. This was...fun? He bounced again. Quite a bouyant mattress. He bounced again.
Showing off seemed to be a good way to fit in amongst her peers. Many of them came from pureblood families, so expressing relations and advanced spellwork was key. Family assets especially, deciphering who owned the biggest mansions or the coolest boats or abandoned properties. It was quite a bit of fun, and her being a Malfoy put her high on the social ladder.
"Late never and punctual is Pureblood a; 16 Number Rule!" The boy's voice grew louder as his father gave the first hit to his arms. "Them between heir a create will and ge-" The boy was interrupted by the thwick of the cane on his arm. With a sharp look from his father, he continued. "Gender opposite the of Pureblood another court will Pureblood a, age of is one when; 15 Number Rule." The boy straightened his back determinedly. So far no book had fallen off of the pile atop his head, and he had not stuttered. He only needed to make it through one more hit and he was free. "Educated well is Pureblood a - AGH!" The third hit came. This one was harsher than the others, and most most likely heated up to burn by Lucius' spells. It drew blood from the boys arms, and nearly caused the boy to lose balance. One of the books nearly toppled and the boy brought his hands up in fear to steady the pile, blood dripping down his arms in large clots, staining his robes and carpet.
Potter blinked up at him, and then scowled. "Maybe you need to get this through your thick skull, Malfoy, but not everyone's an asshole like you are. Not everyone would blame a school bully for trying to summon Voldemort or something." Draco flinched.
“Far better than you it seems. You look like someone stole your sugar quills.” She commented,and Draco’s face immediately hardened.
“Erm, hello there Borislav.” Draco greeted the boy who was staring at him. Said boy flushed and grinned widely.
When Lucius was teaching Draco about his ancestry, and how all Purebloods must go by the particular codes, Draco had asked this same question. He was subsequently shunned for his insolence and was told not to dwell on flights of fancy such as 'individualism'. He never brought it up again, with his mother or father.
They both gave her hair a ruffle as they walked past to sit down, and Octavia allowed it more graciously, giving them both a younger sister smile.
He was curled up on the sofa near Pansy, no surprise there, but who else he was asleep beside was a bit suspicious.
So in terms of information, Sirius was still missing a who, what, why and a where. At least he had a when.
Before she was imprisoned in Azkaban to atone for her crimes, she made a daring escape from her holding cell. She stole back her wand, Apparated to Malfoy Manor, stole the Malfoy child in the dead of night and fled.
So that was chapter two! Leave a kudo and a comment, I especially appreciate constructive criticisms and comments that let me know whether or not you like how the narrative is going, as they help me with the process. One really nice comment legit made me cry so thank you so much for the happy brain chemicals, you are a treasure.
"C'mon guys, breakfast is in 15 minutes, the post will be here soon." Anthony told them, packing his things into his schoolbag. Draco jumped out of his bed and rushed to the mirror. He supposed he could keep what he had on, he didn't think it smelled too bad yet. His hair however...
He was confused. Lucius had told him time and time again that he'd be in Slytherin. It was in his blood. All his ancestors had been, so why hadn't he? He considered whether his mother could've had an affair, but knew it wasn't true. He shared an awful resemblance with his father.
"Yesss, finally, excitement! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!" Michael began chanting. Terry put his hands over his ears and tucked his legs up onto his chair, while Draco once again thanked the gods that he remembered to set a silencing charm around this part of the library. Neville looked like he was about to be sick, and was clutching the edge of his chair with a death grip.
“As I said before, I’m fine. And why do you care anyway, Potter?” He walked over to the upended broom that was stuck in the dirt.
“Sure.” Before the table would run out of booze, Draco filled two white plastic cups with wine and passed one to Potter. Potter looked surprised yet grateful.
!” He imitates and Draco laughs. “When you were younger you probably would have called Octi ‘Malfoy’ if it wasn’t confusing.”
I could hear some humming come from the bathroom, and I got out of bed to see what Malfoy was doing.
“I know about the no straight thing, not about the Potter thing!” She gasps. “Is there a Potter thing?!” Her mind reels. “Is there a fucking
Class ended pretty quickly, ad Draco rose to meet Octavia in the entrance hall. He took the Daily Prophet out from his satchel and flipped through it as he walked. It was then that he saw it. The Weasleys. An embarrassing situation highlighted on the front page. It included a mislabelling of Arthur Weasley, as well as a picture of the Weasleys in front of their sad little house. Immediately, a million different insults and taunts to throw at Weasley flew through his mind, but he shoved them all down.
Because even though he hasn’t lived it yet, and is so deep in his own denial, he understands that he can’t do anything about those feelings. He won’t let himself get crushed and fall of the tracks. He won’t let Potter break him.
“As long as you actually get some sleep instead of studying or reading those trashy smutty novels of yours.”
But Draco, he hadn’t even had Hogwarts. Just him and Trixie. Sirius dreaded to think of the kid’s state after all that time. He could barely stand a short conversation with his cousin, let alone years and years. But he could relate to being locked up for a long time. He just hoped the kid wasn’t as wracked as he was.
Lucius Malfoy, Narcissa Malfoy, Draco Malfoy and Octavia Malfoy. They all carried themselves with the poise and elegance only a Malfoy could ever possess. Some of it was lost on Draco due the circumstances.
Hopefully it wasn’t close to what Blaise was doing to Theo Nott’s face while he sat on the best armchair, Nott sitting on his so called ‘best lap’, snogging the life out of each other. It was like two dementors except they were horny teens.
He made a clicking sound with his mouth and Cushion responded by jumping onto his lap. He craned his neck towards them.
Their was an incredible Wronski Feint performed by Krum that Draco cheered for, even though Irish player Lynch hit the ground with a thud.
"I...guess that would be...fine..." Granger replied hesitantly, ignoring Weasley's anger. "Look! It doesn't matter if you go with us or not, I just want to start moving!" Potter nodded and so
“Theoretically. I feel it would be quite apt.” At Potter’s confused look, he elaborated. “Because of my name.”
“Well you can hardly blame yourself, being entered into a death tournament is probably higher on your list of worries than dressing up.” Draco told him. “And you still haven’t answered why you’re here.”
She was supposed to be someone perfect for him, they got along like a house on fire, and he cared about her more than anyone else. He could see how pretty she was in a faraway sense, but he just wasn’t attracted to her. And in his house it seemed everyone was.
"Oh I do love ice cream! What flavour would you like?" She snatched the pouch excitedly. One of her more childlike times then.
“I’ve never told anyone. And you can’t tell anyone! It’s really important you don’t tell anyone.” Draco knows he barely needs to tell Blaise this. Blaise is helpful. Blaise wouldn’t tell.
Jesus Christ this was a messy situation. He goes to Grimmauld, expecting a perfect place for his Godson to plan to take down the last of the Death Eaters with his friends, and finds his psychotic little shit-head of a second cousin by the name of Draco Malfoy. Not only that, but the same Draco Malfoy who was apparently kidnapped fucking forever ago by his other psychotic cousin Trixie.
"It's been going quite well so far, but knitting requires more outside perspective than my other art projects. I prefer to go with my gut but the wool demands a plan. Would you like my first beanie?" Ah, it was a beanie then. I nodded and she placed it on top of my head, giving me a gentle kiss to my cheek. She took Malfoy's previous place of the sofa and leaned her legs on my legs.
I was frozen in disbelief. In shock. In befuddlement. I was fucking confused. Why were we rooming together? There had to be some mistake. While I was having my internal (and probably external) panic, I saw Malfoy walking up to the end of the hallway where I was.
“Hey Drakey Drakey Drake!” Pansy came bounding up to him. “You look quite lost in your thoughts my darling.” She looped an arm with his. He raised a brow.
He woke up a couple more Slytherins, providing his favourites with hangover potions, and the rest with mild pain charms as he sent them off to their rooms. He continued to clean up the mess, and not much to his surprise, no one returned to help.
“Right, well we all got pretty plastered! It was amazing.” Blaise recovers, telling the Durmstrangs who were listening in. “I don’t know whether you’d be able to party with the Slytherins.” He taunted.
He was right about the curliness. And the ringlets. And, uh, the frizziness. It was a mess. A curly frizzy bushy blonde mess. It wasn't quite an afro, but it was close. The sheer volume was kind of amazing actually. Was it just really spread out now, or was it really concentrated before? It was hard to tell, especially with the way it was bouncy about as Pansy and Malfoy had a cat fight.
He enjoed Ravenclaw. He truly did. But he was in too deep for his father not to react. Especially since his only other friends outside of Ravenclaw were Gryffindors. He like his house, but his father would not. He heard the whispers that followed him around the hall. He needed to be resorted.
. “Eef we’ve all got our papier, zen we shall go now. Look in order! Fix zat hair! Adjust your cap!” Margaux turned her cold gaze to him, which then warmed slightly. “I bid you adieu, mon ami, until we meet again Draco.” She squeezed his forearm.
She was Pansy Parkinson. Draco’s right hand woman, the theorised girlfriend, the Slytherin princess.
, it was just getting boring. Draco had run out of things to do inside, and nothing could console him. He had read every book in the library (even the ones he knew he wasn’t supposed to), had practiced every spell to near perfection, had charted very star in the sky, and had brewed every possible potion.
I never knew Malfoy spent so much time trying to bother me. And he'd just admitted that the reason was just for some attention! I'd also never considered how long it took for Malfoy to make the badges, I just knew he did it because he hated me. I'm realising that our whole rivalry was really silly. It just got sillier as the years went on and we became more pubescent insecure messes. It was so stupid and childish looking back on it, but at the time, it was the worst. So I said as much.
“As a matter of fact, I would want a dragon for a pet. They’re incredible creatures and highly intelligent. They can also breath fire,” he added as another thought. “And how are these Blast-Ended Skrewts useful, Granger? I don’t know the proper use they display and what we’ll get out of farming them, and since all they’ve done is injure a student, I believe I’m free to judge as I see fit. And these are horrid and ugly and dangerous.” He finished with a nod to his Skrewt.
In one corner there was a gathering of first and second years, all wearing fake vampire teeth or fake blood, pulling horrid faces at each other and pretending to turn each other into vampires. It was frightfully inaccurate to what actual vampires were like, but he supposed it looked...fun.
For Neville it took a while longer. A whole minute with the hat on his head he sat on that wooden stool. Draco could admit to feeling a bit worried, as this was the longest the hat had gone before making a decision this sorting. Finally the hat grumbled out:
"Exactly!" Granger agreed with him, before looking disgusted to having agreed with him. She managed to hold Weasley back from the scruff of his collar before he had his own shot at chatting them up.
“Another person? How many people do you know?” He asked with great confusion. The way the kid phrased it sounded like he’d never been outside.
“Whatever Blaise. One day your perverted nature and sex addiction will come cost you greatly.” He bopped Blaise on the head again (this time with the book) to drive in the point.
"I think it means combat or duel. Pretty cool name for an owl. The family owl I'm allowed to use is called Pluto. He's an Eurasian Eagle-Owl. Very big and can carry large packages, but it's quite painful if he lands on your shoulder. And he's no where as pretty as yours." Draco says as he helps Harry with piling their luggage in the compartment. Once they'd piled all of their suitcases and things under the seats, they sat down. On instinct, Draco straightened his back and locked his knees, keeping his hands neatly on his lap.
Luna smiled widely and tossed the bottle to me before trapping Malfoy in a big embrace. His face was awkwardly squished against her, uh, chest area, and the whole thing looked awkward because of the position difference of the sofa and floor. He looked like he didn't know what to do, so he set about giving her some dorky shoulder pats, a mug still precariously in one hand.
Octavia shrieked as Draco vomited over a section of the entrance hall, just missing her shoes. He clenched his fist and wiped away at what was on his face, feeling disgusted with himself.
"I appreciate your intentions Granger, but you're going to have to go further than giving an odd house elf a sock to make a difference."
“For the last time Draco, stop trying to meddle! I’m getting somewhere by myself, I don’t need you to but in for everything! I’m fine!” Was the last thing she yelled at him before flouncing off to her dorm.
"You've caught me Weasley. First step; accidentally lifting desks. Next step; world domination." Hermione chuckled.
"I decided that I needed a new wardrobe. You know, stuff that isn't just Dudley's hand me downs. Especially since we're not going to wear uniform anymore." Ron nodded along and started making grabby hands towards the bags.
Cheers were let out, hands were shaken and bets were settled. Draco looked practically euphoric in the aftermath, and continued to pester Octavia about complicated quidditch moves or "did you see that one part when-", and as much as Octavia liked her brother being happy, she was getting kind of sick of it.
Pansy snickered. "It looked so bad that he's decided to quit Hogwarts and continue life as a designer handbag."
“Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me,” he tried to continue, “you know what I want, and I got what you need.” He tried to smirk.
She excused herself from the table to go marching after the indignant Gryffindor. He was flouncing through the entrance, looking to be heading towards the Great Lake. Octavia sprinted slightly to catch up.
“Nah, I’ll be fine. This way the reveal with be even better! No shoo while I work my magic!” She yelled at Octavia and she grinned.
“What was that about my family?” He confronted them, face red as his hair with anger. Draco took a step forward in front of Octavia on impulse.
“Yes please.” She agreed, and let him talk her through some stuff. She was only going to make some notes on it at first, but as Greg explained everything she continued to write and write until eventually she practically had her full essay done.
He grabbed as many as he could carry and went back up the stairs to the common room. He walked in to see Via,  Martha and the other brat trying to draw on someone’s face with a quill without waking them up. He cleared his throat sharply and they ran off giggling. He shook his head and downed a hangover potion, waiting a moment before painless bliss washed over him. It tasted disgusting but the effects were worth it.
"They didn't have anything to do with it! Let them go!" Potter's voice rings out and it's the last thing he hears before he gets to a silent part of the wood. He doesn't stop running. He needs to get them both back to Narcissa and out of this mess.
“I’m just full of surprises.” Potter replied as he pulled out another book, the title surprisingly in English. Draco returned to his book with a smile on his face.
"You better not be like this for the rest of holiday." She told him as they left the box down the purple carpeted stairs.
Martha had so much to say, a real motormouth. And all of her incredible stories and drama made Octavia feel pretty boring. All she’d known all her life life was the manor and it’s grounds, maybe their holiday home in France. Her social life was strictly her parents, her tutors, the portraits on the walls, and Draco. Martha seemed to have lived more than Octavia, and it made her a bit jealous at times.
Dumbledore continued, "This is due to an event that will be starting in October, and continuing throughout the school year, taking up much of the teachers' time and energy - but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely. I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts -"
At this point Draco was vibrating with excitement and anticipation, buzzing in his seat gleefully, to the embarrassment of Lucius.
After The Nightmare Before Christmas they didn’t watch anymore films, because apparently they had to save the best for the later. By this point, t was nearly dinner, so Octavia took out her fangs , wiped off her makeup, and went out to sit in the great hall.
“Here we go.” He muttered before clearing his throat. “WAKE UP YOU SPECCY GIT!” He yelled into Potter’s face and smirked as the boy jolted awake with shock.
