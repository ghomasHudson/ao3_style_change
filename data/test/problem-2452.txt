“Merlin, it was amazing,” Neville sighs. “She prepared them in this coconut sauce with galangal and …”
“So this is the team you go straight for, Draco?” one of the twins asks, in heavily accented English.
Prompt Twenty-Three:
“Had a raid go a bit pear-shaped,” Harry concedes. “I got suspended until Christmas so I’ve just been in visiting a woman who got hurt.”
It’s as if Ron is thinking the same thing.
The last words trip off his tongue.
are so much better since you started teaching her.”
Won’t
“Not the game, lad,” Cranswick laughs, stepping back and turning his attention to Draco again. “I don’t care what anyone has to say about that Mark on your arm—you’re a credit to the Arrows.”
“Bill and Fleur and their kids do.”
Draco’s smile is absolutely blinding. He pushes his hair back out of his eyes and bites his lower lip, giving Harry a hungry stare before taking off down the pitch so fast it’s as if he was never there at all.
It doesn’t help.
of the blame lies at Voldemort’s feet, Draco.
“So we use the spiral staircases,” Hermione declares. “At the ends of the floors. It will be fine.” No one else says anything.
The last time he saw Viktor was years ago now. Before his injury, when Puddlemere had been playing an exhibition match in Bulgaria. Harry had been coming to terms with his sexuality, and Viktor had been very…
“No! Black family tree, Black family decorations. There will be no …” Kreacher pauses for a long second, his wrinkly little legs wiggling as he leans further into the box and Harry thinks if a slur comes out of the elf’s mouth now he will push the him into the box and tape it shut. Kreacher emerges, scowling, holding a clutch of tiny silver stars on strings. “No
Harry’s caseload is still heavy, even though he’s pretty sure these will be his last few weeks on the force, and he spends a frustrating morning surrounded by paperwork. Head Auror Dawlish has been amazing at letting him have as much time off as he needs for campaigning, but Harry can’t let this pile up any longer or Ron will just be stuck with it after he’s gone.
The Orphanage is warm and homey. Fires burn brightly in the hearths and Christmas music filters through the rooms. Harry carries the boxed tarts to the kitchen and thanks each of the staff for their work during the year, giving them cards with generous little bonuses inside. He’s so glad that this place feels happy every time he visits. He can’t return these children’s parents to them, but he can make sure that none of them ever feel unloved.
Harry spends his time at home, mostly. He sleeps a lot. Orders takeaways, because he’s not sure about keeping food fresh in a wizarding house, and it’s not like he’s going to get Kreacher back from Hogwarts to ask. Takes Teddy to the park on a good day, watching him toddle in the grass on his fat little legs.

“Is this you and Ginny?”
“Am I
“We need to work out what’s happening with our magic,” Hermione concludes, wrapping her hair in a thin towel coiled tight on her head. “Some spells seem to work fine, and others either don’t work at all, or the castle responds.”
“A lot better than
had enthusiastically covered his every errand in the weeks after the War. People are so bloody entitled. Still, he watches more closely as Potter returns to take his seat, and an inexplicably warm feeling washes over him as he sees the way his eyes light up when the waiters set perfectly deconstructed treacle tarts in front of every guest. There’s just a hint of the boy he watched shovel dessert in his mouth in the Great Hall every day. Not that Draco was prepared to admit, then, why he was paying attention.
“Can I—”
Suddenly, there’s an almighty cracking sound beside Harry and a rain of broken glass. He spins, wand out to deal with whatever this new threat might be. But all he can see is one of the giant twelve-foot Christmas trees that line the Food Hall, and he watches in horror as the delicate gold and glass baubles that decorate it splinter and fall to the ground.
Iyer looks at him curiously. “What are you suggesting?”
“Wonderful,” she enthuses. “Take Ginny, she’s at ‘Wheezes and bored out of her mind because there’s too much snow for her to fly.”
Harry sighs.
“What time do you call this...the

He and Harry carry their haul to the staff lounge. Neville picks up a particularly mammoth wreath to examine it for damage. “Buxus and evergreen oak. Not a Nargle in sight,” he says with a wink. “What about you, what are you doing here?”

standing near the kettle casting, but the aroma coming from that general direction has a decidedly astringent sting to it that’s starting to make his eyes water.
“No, these ones,” Rose points to the other unlit spaces. Harry is still confused and says as much.
There’s always a moment, just as she’s leaving, when he thinks about asking. If she married Weasley. If she has children. If ….
them. Dinner’s going to be so good they’ll gladly hand over their galleons.”
“It’s not that—”
“Excuse me?!”
“It doesn’t make any sense,” Harry sighs, kicking at a laundry hamper in frustration. It spins away on its wheels and crashes into the wall.
“Oh that’s disappointing,” Luna sighs. “I wonder what went wrong.”
“You went to him first?” she asks, aghast. “Without even talking to me?”
, I think you’ll find I’m not the place to start,” Draco’s tone is ice-cold, and he immediately picks up the clipboard and pencil and walks away.
to the whole affair. But then it became obvious that she had absolutely no intention of ever going public. How could Hermione Granger, Senior Wizengamot Advisor and Order of Merlin First Class possibly admit to being involved with a lowly consultant who was on the wrong side in the war?!”
If the librarian recognised him, she gave nothing away. She nodded at his requests with a friendly smile and showed him where to find the books he needed, and how to check them out with his wand. Even the books themselves, rather than feeling like dirty, shared,
“I don’t think I’ll change mine,” Luna says, looking down at her own lacy pink bra and voluminous bow-covered bloomers. She looks like a vintage pin-up. Harry suspects the outfit will not fare well in the lake water and says as much.
“You can arrest me now, Mr Weasley.”
“And, in another Christmas miracle, it positively
Harry feels the circle of their spells start to bend, as if the ritual is starting to tip over. As if all of the energy in the magic is being drawn from …
“Why are you lurking over here?”
“Here, here,” announces Zabini, overenthusiastically for the subdued group, raising his glass and lurching to his feet. “To Draco and Luna!”
“Just to round up the team, we have a Portkey in the morning.”
So what if he’s unwilling now to get his hopes up all over again? To show Draco Malfoy, of all bloody people, his weak underbelly—figuratively
“What on earth do you know about Muggle motor mechanics?” Draco scorns, incredulous.
“The thing is, we’re over 300 points behind.”
“I didn’t mean anything by it, I genuinely didn’t know,” he says gruffly. “But we can continue with separate practices. It probably makes sense.”
-ing another plate and forking some slices of bacon and toast onto it. “Here, we’ll share.”
“Ginny,” says Harry, but neither Ron nor Ginny hears him. They stare at one another, oblivious: Ginny is frightened but defiant; Ron appears utterly lost. When Ginny speaks again, it’s still to her brother. No one else in the room is really there.
“I’m not well.”
“Hermione, this isn’t real!” Harry yells, turning back to her. It was her request that conjured this nightmare; she must be the key to defeating it. “Bellatrix is
Draco glances up sharply in surprise. “No, why would I be? She’s the expert.” Leila laughs in appreciation, jabbing Draco in the ribs playfully and muttering something unintelligible at him in French before walking away to pack up her things.
Hours later, he sits astride his broom watching Oliver Wood bellowing at Maxwell, their newest Chaser, a fresh-faced signing straight out of Hogwarts who shows enormous potential but is literally becoming too terrified to try anything.
“It’s really stunning. Far too beautiful to burn.”
Harry looks at Malfoy, who is staring up out the kitchen windows, his face impassive. He seems uninterested by the whole conversation, which is somehow even more infuriating.
“You’re disgusting, Potter. Leave me alone.” He stalks from the room before he can change his mind, Harry’s chuckle following him out.
“Look, you don’t have to like Draco, or even speak to him if you don’t want to. You just have to concentrate on your part of the plan. He’s always been clever, he’ll learn the ritual steps quickly. And there’s absolutely no upside for him if we fail.”
“What the fuck, Harry?” Draco cries, startled.
dining room might not have Voldemort or a giant snake, but the house is starting to feel like just as much of a prison as the last time Harry was here.
bond? I’d really like to be your husband.”
It’s a horrible hatchet-job, penned, no doubt, by Rita Skeeter. It insinuates all kinds of things about the financial propriety of the charity, suggests that Draco’s been breaching the Statute of Secrecy with his Muggle kitchen staff, contends that more of the money donated has gone on his own home renovations than anything else. And Draco wouldn’t care about any of it except that it says over and over again that he’s only made friends with Harry to attract more influential guests to his dinners.
“You don’t need to come. You can follow me later if you want.” She grasps his hand quickly and gives it a squeeze. “When you’re ready.”
“Or there’s a whole cellar of wine that I couldn’t tell from vinegar,” Harry offers, but loses his train of thought as Draco takes a step toward him.
Malfoy’s eyes narrow, as if he’s expecting some sort of trap. Harry thinks about what Hermione said at lunch yesterday, about leaving the past where it belongs.
In the end, the evening feels like something of an anticlimax. Harry supposes he expected some sort of rousing speech about courage and history and whatnot, rather than yet another recitation of how many pairs of socks they’ll need.
Of course it’s Harry. He gets out of bed as he waves his hand at the canvas door. It’s as if Harry was leaning on it, because he practically falls into the tent.
Her mouth is a thin red line. She fixes him with a steely expression, before reaching into her bag and producing a folded piece of parchment. “This is what you wanted,” she warns, passing it to Draco. And Harry supposes that she’s right. Draco will have a job with the best club in the League. There’s no arguing with that when it comes to reestablishing his reputation.
Harry turns to see Wood glaring at Malfoy, his face an ugly puce colour. Good. At least someone else is as outraged by Malfoy’s underhanded suggestions as Harry is.
“Excuse me?” Malfoy looks at him as if he’s misheard.
Aiden North’s jaw falls open, and he stares at Harry as if looking for back-up. And it’s true that Harry had stopped him from doing that just yesterday, because it might be permitted by the rules but it still
Draco snorts. “Definitely not. Pans wouldn’t touch Blaise with
“What do you reckon this is?” he asks, holding out the letter for her to take. She tilts it slightly toward the fire so the light is better, frowning as she reads the text.
“I’m really sorry, mate. Obviously we’ll get the Healers and the Unspeakables to look it all over, but these arseholes seem to be being pretty honest about what they did. I don’t think the memories are coming back. They were startled we even worked it out, but it seems like their ancient spellwork just didn't catch Muggle things like a pair of sodding trainers.”
“To save you from yourself,” she announces, striding around the bed and pulling the curtains wide, letting the cold snowy light blind him. “We are two weeks out from Christmas, and I’m betting you haven’t even thought about gifts.”
“I’m going back to the hotel,” Harry replies, proud of the even, not-at-all slurred way the words come out.
, and so he needs to convince Malfoy to help based on the puzzle alone.
Ron’s expression changes in an instant, from incredulity to outrage. “
“Enjoying the view from down there?”
He takes a room at a new inn called the Siren’s Song and throws himself into working with Neville on plans for the new school. Neville’s found a fantastic property for it. A former convent with sandstone buildings, high arched windows, wooden floors, and plenty of land. Because the children will be so young, one of the first things they work on is how to utilise the Floo network effectively so that Muggle parents can take their children to local drop-off points near their homes. “No different than a school bus,” Harry assures him. “And they can always come through, too, if they like. We’ll teach them how.”
“We can’t risk it,” Harry sighs. “If these stairs close over while we’re in there, we’ll be separated from Hermione.”
“No I just…forgot it was on.”
“Wasn’t it amazing, Coach?” the young Chaser gasps.
Harry approaches to the doorway. All of the on-duty staff are gathered around Casey’s charmed hearth, but in place of the previously destroyed grate is the Yule log he’d given Draco.
, Draco realises.
“Ah...Chen is. Why, has something happened? I told you to come straight to me with any new information.”
He scribbles on the note and sends the owl off with some crumbs of very blackened bacon from the edge of his plate. He pokes at the watery pile of eggs and something that might be kippers, his heart sinking.
Clearly the part about Nev and Luna is just bullshit. If that were true, Harry would know.
like cheating. The whole point of being a Beater is skillfully knocking the Bludgers away, not turning them into magical opponent-seeking missiles. But again, there’s no chance to object before Malfoy moves on.
” It’s exasperating how Malfoy can still flood his veins with irritation, even after all this time.
The place is quirky: over-decorated with plastic dolls stuck to the ceiling and doors leading off to other rooms. It’s still early enough in the evening that it’s mostly empty, and so Harry takes a seat at the bar and orders a beer. He hands over the tab card and the woman serving him retrieves a Muggle credit card in Harry’s name. “Here you go!” she says, handing him a receipt. Two scotch and sodas, two vodka tonics. The date on the receipt is over a month ago. Harry, unsure what else to do, pockets the credit card.
He doesn’t like the look Blaise is giving him either, which is piercing and far too perceptive. “Just as long as you’re careful. This isn’t like you, Draco. You’re not one for a holiday fling, even when you
The increased press coverage works, of course. Tickets to watch an Arrows game begin to sell like hotcakes. Parkinson insists they hold an open practice, which they’ve never done before, and Harry’s staggered to find the stands packed with school kids pointing out their favourite players and clapping wildly at the team’s more outrageous manoeuvres.
“Then, we don’t currently need help and the best way out is through,” concludes Hermione, pocketing the teaspoon again.
Hogwarts is opening itself up again.
wrong,” Ron scoffs. “What does that even mean?”
He finds Malfoy where he left him, perched on the sofa with one long leg crossed over the other. It’s so jarring, to have an adult version of his childhood rival sitting here in front of him. Malfoy grew up to be attractive, in spite of everything. All sharp cheekbones and jaw, and those pale grey eyes.
Harry couldn’t care less about their stupid pure-blood sports, and he very much needs to get out of this room. He places his napkin on the table and nods at Luna. “I’ll see you all tomorrow then.”
“Did he speak to you about it at all this morning? Ask you to confirm to us that the two of you had been together?”
“Don’t act stupid, Potter. It’s unbecoming.” He shoves his sleeve back, holding out his forearm where the Dark mark is a faded, harmless-looking gray. “No one is ever going to hire me legitimately.”
Harry feels crestfallen, like he’s ruined something important.
well,” he says, gesturing too broadly with a glass of pinot. Draco signals Jason for another glass and helps himself without asking from the bottle Potter has ordered, which is predictably awful. “It turns out that my best friend and I have basically spent ten years being not-best-friends over a succession of stupid misunderstandings.”
“I want to go and check on my mother. Are we agreed she’s not a suspect, or does one of you want to accompany me in case I’m planning to give the game away?”
on your broom, but yes.”
“What would you have us do instead?” she asks. “You know we can’t get back past the fifth floor — we tried. Ron’s trapped down there somewhere by himself, facing Merlin knows what. I don’t want him in danger any more than you want Draco to be.”
Potter gives him a look that is far too piercing. Draco glances away at the stage. “So you’re all sorted now? The air’s all cleared. The Golden Trio restored.”
Harry walks toward him from the Great Hall, his robes swirling around him and his cane clacking gently on the stone floor.
“Pansy thinks it’s because I haven’t forgiven them for the war, but she’s wrong. She’s beautiful and fashionable and always knows exactly the right thing to say. She and her friends have always known magic and its history and traditions. They have no idea what it’s like for those of us who come to it later...”
“Okay,” Harry murmurs, and Draco feels the word more than he hears it. He looks around the room, at the newly-stripped floors and the whitewashed walls and the brightly coloured rug. Thinks about Harry coming back here from the Farm each day,
Harry takes a deep breath, trying to calm his pulse which is now unaccountably racing. He can feel sweat beading on his upper lip and suddenly he needs fresh air. He signals for the bill, waving away Hermione’s suggestion that they split it. As he rummages in his pocket for an extra galleon, his hand closes around a card. He takes it out and examines it in surprise. He doesn’t recognise it, let alone remember putting it in his pocket. On one side it says “Tab #62” and on the other it says “Friendly Society, Wardour Street, Soho.”
Luna, as if reading his thoughts, steps alongside him and takes his elbow in her hands, giving his arm a little squeeze. “They really do enjoy their jobs, Harry,” she assures him. “And they’re well taken care of. I had Hermione look over their contracts.”
“I’m staying,” Harry insists, because it’s the right thing to do.
“I’ll need your wand,” she says gently, and Ginny, who has been standing firm all this time, falters a little as she draws her wand and passes it to Cassie, hand shaking. She looks lost, and so very young. The Auror takes the wand and holsters it with her own.
“Can I open today’s door?”
“Let’s go,” he calls, and Draco sets off the Snitch with a delighted smile.
“I’m not going to talk about it while she’s here,” he grits out, feeling cornered. This isn’t how he wanted to talk to Ron about this
Lunch is ludicrously over-priced, but the food is wonderful, and it’s nice to sit with Ginny and enjoy a meal free of any expectation. When they were together it always felt like such work. Their conversation was always stilted, and Harry always felt like he was just generally doing a bad job of being a boyfriend—that he was broken in some undefinable way.
Malfoy, sir,” he clarifies. “Mazzy was taking breakfast to his study and found him.”
“I did some day-labouring on a vineyard. The owner was struggling with a Phylloxera infestation, and the traditional eradication spells weren’t effective. He was going to lose the harvest. I just thought, maybe I could graft two of the spells together, the way they graft the vines. It worked.”
,” Malfoy says crisply, and the door to the Slytherin common room is revealed.
“What kind of message is
Harry struggles to get his feet back underneath him, swiping ineffectually at the damp of his jeans. “Not exactly doing it by choice,” he sighs.
The Hogwarts house-elves have set the wizarding tents up in neat orderly rows on the north field, like a small canvas town. He uses a locating charm to find his own and enjoys a really extraordinary Côtes du Rhône with his dinner before taking a book to bed.
Harry’s determined that death won’t touch his family again.
“Hermione, come on. Tell him that’s bullshit.” Harry turns on Malfoy, who doesn’t seem to be taunting at all. He wears a worried expression, ignoring Harry while he waits for some sort of response from Hermione. “Malfoy, you replaced our

Harry feels like they’re in two different conversations. “You were in touch with Malfoy,

.” Ron and Harry both finish together with her in unison.
“Next on my list,” Harry assures him, and heads for Diagon Alley.
After his training was complete, Draco was told he had to appear at the British Wizarding Embassy in Paris to submit his documentation. No university would confer degrees on a British student without confirmation that they were of “fit and proper character” — code for
Neville eyes the forest alongside them warily. “If Robert was right about this, there’s every chance he was right about the Acromantula as well.”
the one who doesn’t know her anymore.
Neville is delighted to hear from him. “It’s so good to see you,” Harry says, and finds he means it with a sincerity that catches him off guard. These last few weeks have been so unsettling, and the unnerving realisation that his friends and family might be similarly affected has unease sunk deep in his bones. Neville, though—Neville has been in Australia since before all this began. Harry doesn’t have any confusion where Neville is concerned.
“Tastes better this way,” Draco counters, and Harry decides to kiss him rather than argue. It’s a kiss tinged with burnt sugar and champagne and the possibility of a future Harry hadn’t let himself imagine even a few short weeks ago. Harry concedes Draco’s right: it does taste pretty good.

“And George said that was bullshit and the word was actually

“Your mother—”
“Dean, maybe,” Hermione suggests, and that makes a certain kind of sense. Except.
you!”
“I always hated this house,” he says finally, picking up Harry’s hand and giving it a squeeze.
It’s all too easy to forget that Luna’s a Ravenclaw sometimes. People constantly underestimate her. Hermione, it seems, among them.
“It’s just...I understand Narcissa isn’t well. And the house seemed very closed up. Not at all...Christmassy,” he fumbles, waving an arm around Andromeda’s warm and inviting kitchen, already heavy with the smell of baking biscuits, a wreath hung above the back door and tinsel strung across the kitchen Floo. “Do you know if she’s okay?”
“Show me?” Luna asks curiously, leaving her sunny spot by the window to read over Hermione’s shoulder. She frowns for a moment, and then turns to Neville. “Could I please cast a medical diagnostic over you?”
“Merlin, no. This house is like a tomb at night. Walls thicker than a Hogwarts first year. Can’t hear a thing. Certainly not over Pansy’s whining.”
“And so I started writing to him. I even visited him a few times in Germany. It took a very long time for him to forgive himself; even longer for him to believe that others forgave him too.”
Lucius is lying beside his desk. Harry doesn’t need to go further or touch him to see what so terrified Mazzie. He’s obviously dead, one eye closed and the other bloody and staring, blankly, into emptiness; hands stiffened into claws; his whole head tilted at a strange, unnatural angle.
Harry looks at a particularly vicious little paring knife repeatedly embedding itself in a chopping board and thinks that there are
Draco gives Andromeda a questioning look, but her arms are firmly crossed and it’s clear there’s nothing to be gained by wading into this one.
“Still ugly,” Rose concludes, sliding back to the floor and heading off in search of more presents to hand out.
He tucks the rings back into the little velvet pouch and puts them in his pocket. Technically, he should leave them here for Bill to sign off with the rest of the items, but Bill won’t mind and Draco can sign the paperwork later. He’s too excited to get out of here and show Harry.
“Sure. Just tired. And it’s a bit bloody weird, isn’t it?” She waves her hand as if to indicate both the gathered group and the Manor in general. “Can’t believe I’ve wasted a weekend to come here and hang out with these dreadful people.”
Ron’s irritated demeanour hasn’t faded, and Harry still feels the reluctance coming off him in waves. Still, he doesn’t disagree.
“Mate, what the fuck.”
Hermione opens her book again. “We need to work out what the Room is doing.”
“Was the dream the same, this time?” Luna asks.
Relief floods through him like a tonic. He’s really here — alive and conscious. They both made it out.
He tugs a flyer off a nearby noticeboard, flips it over and scribbles
“Could you show me the plant, Banny? You could just point me in the right direction, you don’t have to tell me anything at all.”
Harry’s grateful for the distraction. At least while Hermione’s reacting to this taunt, there’s less risk of her examining his own reaction too closely. Her shoulders tense, but she continues to ignore Parkinson, pleading with Luna for a better explanation.
“What happened?” Harry asked.
And really, there’s no arguing with that. Hermione kisses Rose on the top of her head. “Be good for Uncle Harry.”
Harry’s saved from trying to articulate that thought by Malfoy tapping his knife gently against his glass to draw their attention. Luna sits beside him, smiling beatifically.
“We may need to rearrange some things,” he suggests gently, pushing an armchair out of the way, and transfiguring the coffee table into a squat, sturdy-looking little step ladder.
They both hear the knock at the front door. The house elf pops into the room to announce
When Harry arrives, the house is already overflowing. Victoire and Rose are chasing each other up the stairs in peals of laughter, and George and Percy seem to be having one of those extremely loud discussions that is one well-timed insult away from an actual fight.
“What, you’re a Curse-Breaker as well?” Disbelief colours Potter’s tone, and Draco realises he’d almost forgotten he was there, caught up in Bill’s notes and the intriguing mystery the Potters’ rings represent.
” he repeats, with a disbelieving tone.
“Kreacher, surely we could just hang one or two,” Harry says placatingly. “At the bottom, maybe. Round the back.”
“Hey!” Casey yells, rounding on Malfoy, incensed at having his hard work ruined.
“But it’s not really that, is it?” Potter’s eyebrows are drawn together over his bright green eyes. Studying him carefully. Seeing far too much. Draco desperately wants to take those crooked, childish glasses off his nose so he can’t. “You’re just doing what you’re good at. Hosting, socialising, whatever. You’re trying to do something significant with the skills you have.”
Ginny gives a soft laugh. “Oh, Harry,” she says fondly, pressing a kiss to his temple. “Come inside, it’s freezing.”  She gets to her feet.
Harry thinks about trying to explain everything that’s going on, and can’t.
One drink becomes two. Two becomes three.
Draco shrugs, his hands shoved deep in his jeans pockets. “I’m going to have a devil of a time catching up before the end of term exams, but the conjured medical records certainly helped. My supervisor is giving me extra tutoring because of my recent
“Should have known as soon as Harry asked for that,” Ron scoffs, as if merely liking egg in a sandwich is akin to treason.
“You need to open an investigation,” Hermione presses on, oblivious.
“Hogwarts was built on
Harry reaches out to catch Malfoy’s wrist, but he shakes Harry loose. “I have guests to host, Potter. Not everything can be about you.”
Hannah and Neville sit around for a bit, having a cup of tea and talking with Luna about their wedding plans. But eventually Hannah’s yawns become uncontrollable, and the three of them head through the Floo as well.
his job, past tense, he supposes. Ron chose a different path, and that’s never been anything other than a low-level source of strain between them. One that Harry has no idea how to ease.
“It’s amazing,” he enthuses, and is gratified to see Draco flush a little with pride.
Healer Mason’s old office is empty, and looks even sadder than it did the day before. Harry fires a special mending spell at the chair wheel. It’s one he knows well because he developed this habit of rocking his own chair back on two legs while he stares up at the roof and thinks. After about the third or fourth time he’d broken a chair that way Hermione resolutely refused to help him fix it
Harry takes the slip of paper and stares at it. He experiences the same discordant feeling he’s had all week. A sort of jangling in his nerves that he can’t understand and can’t get to settle down.
Once again, cold air sweeps through the room.
“Don’t what? Tell you the truth, Ron? That I couldn’t stop thinking about what that man said to me at dinner? That his words just went round and round in my head when I went up to bed, in the darkness, in
“It just seems like a strange thing for you to do. So long after the War. You never seemed like you’d be a political animal when we were young.”
Hermione sighs. “I suppose that’s right,” she concedes grudgingly. “In any event, I’m going to read until they need me.”
“Have you noticed the portraits?” Hannah asks around a mouthful of spaghetti.
“Where was he?” she demands. They’ve drawn back his covers, and Draco can see the sweat soaking through Potter’s pajama jacket. A permanent tremor seems to have settled in his right arm.
Teddy presses his face to the glass, waving wildly at them all as the train begins to move. Rose runs the length of the platform alongside him, cheering and laughing. They watch and wave until the last of the steam dissipates from the station.
She rolled her eyes, shifted a stack of books off a chair without asking and sat down, pulling out a casefile. “On the use of
When they come back to London on Sunday, Harry is distant and thoughtful. Draco leaves him to his own devices, going home to unpack and then curling up in an armchair with his notebook to sketch out the last steps of his plan for the stabilisation spells.
“What are you on about,” Draco sighs. He’s pretty sure he’s not going to enjoy where this is going.
, Harry. You have to find a way to live. Out there you’re dying.”
“Local oneirologists have been no help. They all recommended you.”
Barely appeased, she hands over her loops of popcorn and Harry heads for home.
“Leave me, Draco,” she says, her tone cool. “I know what I’m doing.”
Probably for the best, Harry thinks, given he’s got a missing witch to find in Shropshire, rumours of a dragon escaping a reserve near Cornwall, and Christmas to plan.
Draco spins around, startled. He looks as bone-weary as Melinda had described, his face sallow and his eyes dark, but Harry can’t concentrate on that at all. Not with the contents of the cupboard on display behind him.
“Months?” Ron manages, confounded.
They go out through the kitchen gardens, turning away from the direction they’d both taken yesterday afternoon and instead toward the stables and the banks of a small lake on the shore of which two white peacocks are strutting back and forth. Harry pauses at a bend in the path. He can see Ginny in the distance jogging, and Bulstrode seems to be bridling a horse for a ride.
“We could stop now,” he says quietly, giving voice to what Harry’s thinking. “No one would fault us for that.”
“Let’s get some sleep.”
“What’s this going to mean for the ritual?” Ron asks. “Should we try those spells? No point in carrying on if they don’t work.”
Harry shakes his head quickly. “No, I know. But if I’d been doing my job properly that day, you wouldn’t have been injured. So I just wanted to stop by.” He glances at the copy of
Time continues to feel elastic and unpredictable, but it seems like it takes more than an hour to clear a passage up through the staircase. Harry’s struck by how uncomfortable the lack of daylight is making him. Four floors above ground and still as dark around them as the dungeons. It’s an awful sensation that makes him want to fire
He tosses his napkin on the table and lurches out of the room, cuffing an unsuspecting house-elf out of his way as he goes. The little creature stumbles but quickly gets to his feet, smoothing out his uniform and hurrying away as if nothing has happened. A horrified silence settles over the room.
old. Like pureblood ancestral heirloom old. The magic in them is something else.”
“You should be very proud of this, Potter.”
he doesn’t want to share, particularly when the rest of the squad is happy to. He shrugs awkwardly and picks up his bag.
She happily chats for a while about how well Hugo is doing in daycare before she bluntly swings the conversation around to Harry.
Parkinson gives him a strange look. “Turns out you’re not going to have to worry about that, Potter.”
Harry’s had enough champagne that Luna has to explain to him twice that
Malfoy blinks slowly in confusion. Harry becomes momentarily distracted by the pale sweep of his long lashes.
Neville snorts. “Well, obviously. I was looking at Ghost Gums in Cairns.”
He thinks about asking Neville what he wore, but the idea of telling anyone he’s thinking about doing this feels too hard. He’s the one who gave them all a piece of his mind for going at all. It makes his face feel hot and his skin too tight.
She looks at Granger, who nods.
“You can’t talk her into this if it isn’t what she wants,” Harry cautions.
“What?” Draco is so heartbroken and so confused. His head is pounding, and his shirt is clammy where his sweat has cooled, and his arms ache, and he can’t understand how this day has unravelled so fucking quickly.
He had forgotten completely. In recent years he’d been far too hungover the day after Solstice to emerge from his room much before noon. But as a child, his mother had let him stack the coins in neat rows for her while she counted them. Draco looked at the pile of money in the bowl and began to dream of what he could do with it. And when he finally settled on a plan, he knew that terrible evening was only the beginning. The very next day he contacted an estate agent and put the Manor up for sale.
“Hey, can you give me a hand for a tick?”
“That makes sense,” Lovegood says, looking at her file and tapping a quill against her cheek. “Harry’s fighting very hard to stay where he is. It’s putting enormous strain on his magical core, and that in turn is putting strain on his body.”
and privilege that entailed.
“Well, you can’t,” Cassie continues. “We don’t even know how his father died yet. It could be natural causes.”
“Thank you, Draco,” Luna says sincerely, as Ron helps her to her feet.
Harry nods. He remembers.
“I’d help you with this, you know,” Neville says quietly, taking a last look around the garden, but he doesn’t wait for Harry’s response before heading inside to the floo.
“Hmm, let’s see,” she muses, as if she’s giving the question serious consideration, tapping one perfectly-manicured red nail against her cheek. “Could it be the MBA from Harvard Business School? The four years working leveraged M&A for Morgan Stanley in New York? My restructure of the Arena Football League in the United States, or the two separate Quodpot franchises I’ve rescued from bankruptcy? Hard to say, Potter, hard to say.”
at least earned a treat.
“Because I didn’t expect you? Remember last night and the whole,
“Well, step aside, Potter,” Malfoy sighs. “Not all of us have nowhere to be in the middle of the afternoon.”
. Gods only knows what that’s supposed to mean. Harry picks at a loose thread on the knee of his jeans. Thinks about the pile of dirty laundry upstairs that sits beside the bag of clean clothes he dragged back from the laundrette last week. He’s pretty sure there’s nothing in the bag that would be appropriate for a posh dinner. But then there’s nothing in the dusty wardrobe except his too-small school robes and possibly a boggart, so that’s not going to work either.
Danforth’s mouth falls open, but no sound comes out. The Healers scurrying around him stutter to a halt, seemingly lost.
Harry sleeps through his alarm, something he hasn’t done since training, which leaves him rushing out of the Floo at the Ministry still eating his toast and desperately trying to fasten his uniform with one hand. And even though Ron teases Harry to this day about his very first flawed Floo attempts, he’s a grown wizard now, and more than capable of emerging gracefully from a fireplace
Draco waits for the end of that sentence but it doesn’t come. The urge to flee is still all-consuming and yet he finds himself unable to move. Sitting here in the dark, damp seeping through his clothes.
It isn’t hard to identify what the problem is. The Arrows are actually flying brilliantly, Harry is really impressed. But every time it looks like they’ll have an opportunity to score, a Wasp is there with a Stinging Hex, the Quaffle is lost, and the sodding stadium starts up that wretched chant again.
“No,” Harry assures him. “It’s a fair question—I haven’t cared about anything other than Quidditch since the war. Until now. I mean it’s amazing that the team is winning, obviously. But starting to fly again, that’s even more incredible. And you, you’re something else again.”

There’s an explosion of light and a horrifying crack and they’re plunged into a suffocating darkness.
The headline is an inch tall.
“Not when we’re
Malfoy nods and she edges past Harry as if she’s carrying a live grenade and leaves.
“You’ve got to relax!” Neville cries, clearly torn between rushing forward to help her and getting too close to the vines.
“Just the shake-up we needed around here, you are,” he hears Cranswick say, poking a skeletal finger at Draco’s chest. “Good for him, an’ all.”
“I said
A predictable silence follows, while Cassie and Ron absorb this and spin to stare at him, identical looks of confusion and concern on their faces. Harry’s stomach sinks.
Harry thinks it will be worth it.
On Saturday, Harry wakes to the sound of two owls tapping on the window of his rented room. One holds the Leaky’s complimentary copy of the
The three of them head back to the East Wing and Lucius’ study. Ron casts to release the Ministry seal on the door, opening it and waving Harry through ahead of him.
” and “
“And the castle seemed to adapt,” Hannah goes on. “Luna’s Christmas light spell held. But anytime something got us closer to the door, it was as if the castle fought back against the threat.”
“Oh gods. He’s away on assignment, and for one awful moment I thought some Ministry cretin had decided to send
“It’s important, rewarding work,” she insists. “We’ve brought dozens of Dark wizards to justice.”
As it hits the ground, they are surrounded by the sudden ringing sound of clashing metal.
“Draco—”
Harry follows him through the trays of seedlings on tables, and mimics the way Neville ducks exaggeratedly under the bough of a thin tree Harry doesn’t recognise but also doesn’t want to mess with. They reach the doors to Neville’s office, and Harry waits while he unwards them.
She steps daintily forward, and before any of them can even yell their objections, half a dozen knives have flung themselves directly at her. Neville yanks Luna to the ground, as at least two of the blades slide discouragingly through Harry’s shield and embed themselves shudderingly in the door frame above them.
It’s the photos folder that’s the hardest, though. The pictures in the envelope had felt self-contained: a single vacation that might have been faked. But the pictures on the phone are the full evidence of a relationship well-lived. Perhaps the worst part about it is how many of them ring true for Harry, even if he can’t recall them directly. Dance parties he’s seen in his dreams. The slew of pictures they’d apparently taken of themselves at an Arctic Monkeys gig.
“But if Luna was at the party and had the spell cast on her, why wouldn’t she have also been persuaded and fallen in line?” Malfoy asks.
“I can’t believe how much progress you’ve made,” Hermione enthuses, helping Rose into her coat and tucking her training broom under her arm.
Cassie breaks the silence. “Ms Granger, can you confirm Ms Parkinson’s version of events?”
“The Chosen One is
The effect is breathtaking. Harry stares at his house in wonder, lit from ridge to foundation, like something out of a movie. He clutches at Malfoy’s arm, unable to help himself.  “It’s
Draco watches her fly drills for a moment. “She’s alright,” he shrugs. “Her form is a bit utilitarian.”
“Someone tells me I’ll be here at least six weeks, and while that bed at the Leaky was pretty good,” he arches an eyebrow at Draco, “no one wants to stay in a hotel that long.”
“I’ve got a rug,” he mumbles, with a smile. “S’not as nice as this one.”
at this moment. Solving the case would mean sending her straight to Azkaban. But he puts his napkin down on the table obediently and follows Cassie out of the room.
Ron picks up the pillowcases and grins at Harry. “Reckon she took personal offence at the idea she’d be asleep for a whole season. As if she could ever be that unproductive."
“Dumbledore once said to me,
Harry makes up his mind. Kreacher will probably flay him in his sleep, but he’ll worry about that later. He can’t remember the right spell and is forced to dig out an old textbook from the top of a dusty shelf. He sneezes repeatedly as he flips the pages looking for it, and then slaps the book closed in triumph.
Harry snaps his eyes up to Malfoy’s. His expression is implacable.
“And when you came to teach at Hogwarts, you were so self-assured, and so bloody attractive I couldn’t stand it,” he breaks off in a chuckle. “It brought back all the best memories from school, watching Quidditch together.”
“We stayed at the Ritz. It was too hot,” he mumbles. “And Americans have no manners.”
Ron shakes his head, slowly. “You didn’t,” he says, simply. “You couldn’t. He was a big man. He struggled, we can tell that he struggled... you wouldn’t be able to —”
He manages to stick to his work routine and well away from Harry for the rest of the week.
Teddy’s school trunk has been packed for a week, sitting neatly against the wall in his bedroom. Maestro, the owl Harry gave him for his eleventh birthday, waits patiently in his gleaming cage.
it during a game feels wrong to him—employing magic against your opponents goes against everything he believes in. It makes him think of Quirrell messing with his broom in First Year, the tampered Bludger in Second Year, Dementors on the pitch in Third Year.
“I thought you’d be out celebrating,” he says, looking a little warily at the way Harry is brandishing the broom at him. “Is everything okay?”
“I don’t know,” he confesses, and it unlocks something in his chest to say it out loud. “I’ve got no idea.”
“Forgive me for being a little surprised that she worked with
There’s a ringing in Draco’s ears that doesn’t have anything to do with his headache.
It seems like a terrible idea, but it’s been a long time since Draco was someone who avoided his problems, so he Apparates straight to Grimmauld Place and raps on the door. It’s dark blue and very shiny, and he realises absently that Harry must have painted it recently. The knocker is a bright silver, and the mat underfoot is new. He’s just taking in the wrought-iron railings and the freshly dug look of the flowers in the crooked planter box under the window when the door flies open and startles him.
to marry him.”
“Oh yeah,” Neville says, seemingly unsurprised.
Her eyes are watery, and she has a bright smile. Harry looks away, suddenly embarrassed.
“And what is it, exactly, that you imagine I’m
“Come home with me,” Harry finally manages on a whisper, the last of his courage leaving him.
“Lovely to see you too, partner,” Harry says, trying and failing to scoop an armload of files back into some semblance of order.
Prompt Seven:
“What the fuck are you playing at?” Harry hisses, holding Malfoy in place against the wall with his forearm.
The smile falls off Draco’s face. “Give me your wand,” he sighs, exasperated, and Harry hands it over without really thinking. Draco fires an
“Oh, thank Merlin,” Granger says, gently supporting his head as she holds a glass of water for him. It’s cold and feels soothing against his raging throat. She’s been crying and her eyes are red.
Except.
“Draco’s had us working at one-and-a-half speed for two days now,” she says with an embarrassed shrug.
“Where do you come into all of this, Luna?” Hermione asks.
“We had a breakthrough, in the case,” he announces without waiting for Draco to look up. “It might mean we can find Marsden, and then maybe we’ll have more information. For Belle.”
Ron lets out a low whistle. “That might work.”
Harry feels some of his goodwill drain back out again.
“Congratulations,” Draco says, inclining his glass to clink against Potter’s.
“I’ll pay for another room,” Harry says quickly, turning for the desk. Sharing a room with Malfoy’s not going to do anything for the unholy attraction he’s developing to the man.
“Do you need to keep reading?” he asks, looking at the notes.
Harry doesn’t care about Draco Malfoy’s redemption tour. And he’s certainly not going to help him with it.
“It’s a prohibited substance. It’s illegal to have it here at all.”
He Floos straight to the shop, startling George who is wanding huge cardboard boxes into a towering stack in the back room.
“Christ, Draco,” Harry laughs abruptly. “That’s not how you unwrap a gift.”
He’s comfortable now that it’s just a brooch.
“What the fuck, Draco?”
Harry had put the marshmallows away and then spent a long few minutes watching the fire burn down, the calendar twinkling happily on the wall.
Ginny gives a short laugh. “Really? Because you could open a useful little window onto the Dark Lord’s mind? Because he made you say a few nasty words to Dumbledore? Dumbledore —” her voice raising as her anger returns “— with his ‘wait and see’ approach. He just let it happen to me, didn’t he? Let that…
“I’m going to sleep in Corner’s bed,” Draco decides, pulling off the dusty cover and shaking it out. “He was always the only attractive Ravenclaw.”
“We have to,” he hears Draco murmur against his hair. He wants to protest, but he’s far too tired, so he just lets himself slip off to sleep.
Harry passes the Tornadoes coach on his way to the changing rooms. Cahill shakes his hand, congratulating Harry on an excellent game. “How the fuck did you teach them to play like that so quickly?” he asks, sounding gruff but impressed. “We absolutely cannot stand these new rules, they’re impossible.”
Ron wolf whistles at him, and Luna gives him a tight hug. Ginny just grins over her pint glass.
follow rules. Even stupid ones.
If the look that Parkinson levels at him could kill, Ron would already have another murder on his hands.
Harry’s already changed into his pyjamas and is propped up in bed with his playbook. Malfoy stares at him for a long minute before chuckling to himself as he kicks off his boots. Harry adjusts his glasses self-consciously.
“Whenever that is,” Luna murmurs, looking at the eerie shadows cast by the castle above them.
,” he manages, the name feeling thick and awkward in his mouth. Malfoy—
Harry wishes he had Hermione’s childhood Time-Turner, so he could go back a few minutes and excuse himself to splash cold water on his face and come to his senses.
“This is the drawing room,” he manages with a choked cough.
“Is that against the rules?”
“A motorbike?”
The foundation class is just twenty students, and only seven of them are Muggle-born, but given the short amount of time Harry and Neville had and how confusing the conversations must have been with these courageous Muggle parents, Draco thinks that’s quite the achievement. The children don’t wear uniforms, and their coloured clothing makes such a contrast to the rows of little black robes Draco associates with his own schooling. It’s like a breath of fresh air.
Hermione frowns for a second. “It’s a … charger.”
“Thank you for joining us this weekend, Luna and I are very glad you could all make it. We’ve invited you all here to celebrate some wonderful news with us.”
Granger says nothing, fixing him with a steely expression, as if to say
She clears a pile of clean laundry off a chair so that Harry can sit. So many little onesies and towels and impossibly tiny socks. Harry didn’t even know they made socks that small.
“Investigating Aurors?”
“Not at that point in the evening, certainly,” Ron agrees. “But unfortunately, our report from the Medi-Aurors is clear. You didn’t kill your father.”
He hands over his own lumpy, poorly-wrapped gift. Draco unwraps the book.
. A limp piece of tinsel has been tied around the handle.
. Wine-flushed and radiant and inexplicably interested in Draco. It’s a calamitous idea. Ruinous.
Malfoy, of course, looks perfect. His robes are midnight blue, cut in some European style that Harry doesn’t recognise. He knows nothing about fashion, but he knows how good Malfoy’s clothes always look, bringing out the paleness of his complexion. Malfoy is demonstrating something to Nott and has his wand out, doing a complicated bit of spellwork over the drinks cart. His wand looks like an elegant extension of his hand, turning in tight, precise gestures. Suddenly he looks up at Harry, whose mouth goes dry. He empties his champagne and fetches another one.
“Not all the students are Muggle-born?” Neville is still talking.
“What happened though?” Luna asks again. “When we finished the ritual?”
“Bollocks,” Malfoy says curtly, cutting Harry off. “We can’t take them on speed yet, Morgan’s assists aren’t clean enough and they were faster than us to begin with. You’re to focus on hexing their rear Chaser, number four. He’s the key to—”
“You’re not at the Leaky,” Draco manages, stating the blindingly obvious.
Ron glances over at Cassie, who gives an almost imperceptible little shake of her head.
“I’m serious. I have an early Portkey. You need to go.”
“Just decorations on trees?” she asks. Alicia had absolutely thrown herself into her studies after the war, determined to put everything she’d learned in Dumbledore’s Army to good use. She was the youngest appointment to the Defence against the Dark Arts post in a hundred years, and thanks to Voldemort’s curse on the position finally being broken, one of its most long-standing.
“She just needs to make sure Malfoy’s not being railroaded,” Harry says, aiming for a conciliatory tone. “You and I both know that’s not the case, but if it makes her feel better for me to sit in, I can’t really see that it does any harm?”
He finds his satchel where he dropped it in the kitchen. Harry can see Teddy home. He doesn’t need to stick around.
Draco finds himself glancing frequently at Potter, who starts the evening scowling and fidgeting with his cutlery, but gradually relaxes back into his seat, drawn into discussion with those around him. A small smile finally starts to edge up the corners of his mouth. Draco watches as he excuses himself between courses and makes his way out to the loo. His shoulders seem a little less slumped, but Draco is still struck by how wan he looks.
“Yes.”
“It wasn’t very nice,” Luna agrees quietly.
. But there can’t be any next until this is over.
“Sounds about right,” snorts Draco, but he’s studying Harry with concern.
Prompt Eight:
“And where do you propose to find a coach who can do that, when you’ve just
“What’s your range of motion?” he asks. His tone seems serious rather than prurient. Any hint of antagonism has vanished.
Draco sighs. “I’m serious. This really isn’t about him anymore. He’s gone, and he isn’t coming back. I know that.” He does know that. But thinking about Harry is keeping him awake every night and plaguing him every day. Maybe if he fixes the rings, Lily’s magic will leave him alone.
They look at each other, stumped.
, but he doesn’t get the chance because there’s a loud round of cheers nearby and suddenly Ron and Nott and Zabini all come crashing through the undergrowth toward them.
The wave of nausea hits him so suddenly that he’s completely disoriented as he jolts from sleep. He lurches out of bed towards the ensuite, only to find the light already on and a very clammy-looking Draco clutching the toilet bowl. Draco groans and waves him away, and Harry has to dash down the stairs to the guest bathroom, making it just in time to empty the contents of his stomach immediately and repeatedly. He’s not sure how long he lies there, cramped and doubled over, before he hears the door open behind him. Draco looks pale and very ill, but he seems to be moving around under his own steam again. He passes Harry a glass of water and helps him to sit up, stroking the damp hair back off his forehead.
about the outcome. I don’t feel that way now, and it’s got nothing to do with the Vow.”
, Harry. I don’t know why it’s
“Was this you?” Harry asks, pushing the paper towards him and tapping an article, oblivious to Draco’s startled expression.
There’s a silence. Draco wishes he could see their facial expressions, but if he goes down now they’ll obviously stop talking about him.
“Well, lucky for you I’m here and
The following week it’s a putty knife and a sash window.
“Yes, well, the preset view was terrible,” Malfoy almost mumbles. It might be the least articulate Harry’s ever heard him.
“I agreed to have you all here, cluttering up my house,” he grumbles on, having taken a deep swallow. “But I don’t have to put up with
The Victory Day memorial in May will mark the tenth anniversary since the Battle of Hogwarts. A bigger commemoration than usual is being organised, held at the school for the first time. Neville is on the Trust Board. He’s pleaded with Draco several times to join as well, but Draco’s realistic. It’s one thing for a Malfoy to attend the ceremonies and appear appropriately contrite; it’s quite another to be involved in organising them. So he just gives Neville ad hoc advice and helps behind the scenes. He has no idea why Neville keeps reaching out to Potter to try to get him involved. He’s seen some of his less eloquent responses over the years.
Draco looks down at his lean chest, the sheet tangled around his legs, the stag tattoo prancing around on his arm. His heart clenches. He can’t let himself get used to this.
“Conscious and confused, Potter. You’re as likely to get a tale about how she needs to study more for her Transfiguration exam as you are to find her on a day when she knows what day it even is.”
“Hello?” he calls out, hearing a distant sound of music but not much else.
Hermione starts again, and this time she does as he suggested.
He gives Hermione another squeeze. “I knew you would,” he says, beaming with pride.
In the Ministry lobby, around the restored Fountain of Magical Brethren, a small Christmas market has been set up, with stallholders selling Christmas trinkets and decorations. One cart near the edge stocks beautifully-decorated Yule logs, wrapped in plaid ribbons, ivy, and berries. Harry selects one and the witch behind the stall packs it into a bag for him.
Harry is so pleased to see him. “You’re welcome to stay as long as you like. I can probably transfigure the couch into a bed,” he says helplessly, looking at the tiny amount of floor space and thinking of Neville’s six-foot frame.
It feels odd, the idea of using her given name, but no less strange than the forced intimacy of them all sitting around Harry Potter’s bed, he supposes.
dinner, and you’re here for a shag?
“It’s a very nice picture of you, Harry,” Luna says diplomatically, coming up behind him and giving him a not-at-all comforting pat on the shoulder. “Very festive.”
Cambie squares her jaw, her expression more confident.
Harry sinks into the chair with a sigh.
“A modified version of Fiendfyre. It burns as hot and as bright as the original spell, but flares out very quickly and can be controlled by the caster. I designed it myself.”
He knows what he has to say.
Harry follows him back to his office, and does a double-take when he reaches the threshold. Thick dark curtains hang at the sides of the window, now looking out on a dark, snowy vista. Two additional lamps have joined the one on the desk, casting warm and inviting light. A painting of Hogwarts is hung on one wall, showing the castle bathed in summer sun, the Giant Squid lazily breaking water in the foreground.
Draco’s in shirtsleeves and a burgundy waistcoat. The fabric looks ridiculously expensive and it just makes Harry want to reach out and touch it. He stuffs his hands in his pockets.
“You keep your medical notes in a fur-covered diary?” Malfoy asks, more bemused than surprised.
“Well, either this will work or it’ll kill me. I don’t really lose anything either way.”
“I thought Marsden was going to—”
“What?”
, Draco. He’s very weak but he’s breathing on his own and he’s no longer comatose.” She looks bright-eyed and happy.
“Auror Harry Potter, accompanying Miss Rose Granger-Weasley to see her mother, Auror Hermione Granger.”
He tries to concentrate on his work, and definitely not on the absence of any artfully folded memos from the Curse Breaking department. At least three times he considers just popping by to see if Malfoy is in, but it doesn’t take much to imagine the lecture that would likely follow, so he manages to refrain.
like the ones in the calendar. And, I mean, a snowman is a bloody snowman, isn’t it?!”
He considers trying to find one of Gasnard’s superiors to demand more prompt attention, but when he looks at the queue of witches and wizards waiting for the tellers, he feels a fresh wave of discomfort about drawing attention to himself. He decides that waiting one more day can’t hurt that much. He’s probably tempted fate long enough, being out here in the open like this. He’ll get some lunch sent up to his room at the Leaky and finish the lesson plan he promised Elsa.
“You haven’t opened all the doors,” he points out.
He takes a deep breath and begins to cast.
“Are you going back?” Harry doesn’t like how small his voice sounds. He concentrates on taking little sips of water. On not thinking about Malfoy’s lilies clutching at Viktor’s—
“You mean you’re sorry for detaining me and then forgetting about it completely, demonstrating once and for all how little regard you have for me?” His voice is chillier than the icy breeze whipping around the stone edges of the building.
“Mulled wine?” he offers instead, though he has no idea where he’s going to get some at this hour.
like, Hermione! Just drawing it wasn’t going to help. And what the hell is this?”
“Don’t, Hermione,” Draco groans. “There’s no point. I made it clear to Harry I wasn’t interested in picking up where we left off. The fact that he’s working here now doesn’t change things.”
It feels oddly invasive, crossing the threshold. Even as he’s done so in the homes of dozens of his patients before now. This is somehow very different.
“Why is the house-elf here, Harry?”
Inside the paper is a velvet box and inside the box is a small silver amulet on which two tiny dragons hold a green gem. The magic in the amulet is very, very old. Harry can feel it dancing lightly underneath his fingertips.
“Good morning, Draco,” she says, beaming at him as if welcoming an old friend.
By the time Harry goes up to bed, he feels exhausted. He hopes that Malfoy might come by again, not so much for the sex — though that certainly wouldn’t be unwelcome — but so that he can talk to him.
“What in Merlin’s balls are they doing?” he finally shouts at Wood, who is circling near the hoops while the Chasers fly a swift end-to-end pattern.
The castle.
That was...
Granger lets out a little sob at that and buries her face in her hands.
“You look very festive,” he manages. He suspects her earrings might be actual Christmas tree baubles. They cycle through a series of different coloured lights in a way that is already starting to give him a headache.
“Where have you been?” he asks, curious and strangely glad to have him back. He flips on the coffee maker and tries to find a clean mug.
Ron and Hermione volunteer for the overnight shift, which Harry suspects has more to do with a desperate need for some privacy than a newfound wish to look after Draco Malfoy. He doesn’t really begrudge them that, but somehow he does begrudge them heading to the farm each night after dinner while he paces. And thinks. And then tries not to think.
It hadn’t occurred to Harry how involved the syndicate might want to be, or how on earth they’re going to manage that, but he can’t bring himself to worry about it right now. Anything is better than the alternative.
Up ahead, Pete shoves another branch aside as he forces his way through the overgrown path.
“So you went,” Ron interjects.
“He wanted to get up
Draco looks more exasperated than Harry’s ever seen him. More exasperated even than when Harry suggested using
Teddy gives him a startled look, and Andromeda frowns at Harry as she reassures Teddy that there’s no way that will happen to him. Harry looks embarrassed and uncomfortable.
, Hermione!” he yells, shoving his breakfast plate off his lap and standing up, his heart thundering in his ears.
. Having
“No, uh...I don’t know. Just scribbling.” He tears the page off the pad and crumples it up. No need for mysterious snakes to wind up in Rosie’s paper chains.
“Leila, this is Harry Potter,” Malfoy says, as he approaches. She eyes him with measured interest and a small smile.
When he returns to work, he calls past Catie Chen’s desk. She seems surprised to see him.
He can’t face the crowds at Flourish on a Monday morning so he decides to see what the hospital gift shop has to offer. The kiosk is a riot of floral bouquets in buckets, bright foil balloons emblazoned with cheery messages like “It’s a girl!”, and a big seasonal display of stuffed animals with names like “Mistle-toads” and “Santa-claws”. The last thing he expects is to see Malfoy in the book section.
After the practice ends, the players head inside to get changed and the crowds drift away, but Draco lifts off again, flying complicated loops of the pitch. It’s cold, and Harry knows he should go inside and warm up, but it’s hard to take his eyes off the bright streak sweeping back and forth above him in the gathering dark. He loves watching Draco fly. Harry’s so filled with envy his chest feels tight with it. He takes a deep breath and carries the training crate back to the gym.
“I can get started tomorrow morning. I should be done within a week.”
Neville visits at half-term.
“Puddlemere don’t own the Arrows, Harry.”
“It was anything but,” snorts Ginny, an incredulous expression on her face. “Not only was the magic
“I’m not
He continues in that vein for the rest of the week, making excuses about needing to meet with Parkinson to deal with some administrative matter or other, and dashing off to the park to meet Leila. She’s a diligent, careful coach, never letting him extend himself too far. Within a week, Harry can fly basic patterns again, though he’s sweating and red-faced and tired at the end of it. He comes in for a shaky landing and hears a slow clap behind him.
Harry's words seem to ricochet off the edges of the disillusioned space into the silence that follows. All he can hear is the Muggle tourists chattering to each other as they wait in the nearby queue. It’s not a secret of course, and he’s sure that Malfoy
“Come back? Later, after your time at home.”
that?”
—as if that wouldn’t completely undo me. Expecting me to play boyfriends with you to appease this ancient tyrant of a calendar you’ve got yourself knotted up with, and at the end of it all you’ll sit down to your family lunch and where will I be? Exactly nowhere. Because I can’t risk
“Avoiding getting vomited on? It will be blue, you know. He’ll never get the stains out.”
“Then, I think we’re done here,” Parkinson announces, and as Draco reaches for her, she snatches her wrist out of his grasp and hurries out of the room. Draco looks frustrated and furious, casting a hostile glance back at Hermione and then at Harry.
Harry tangles their fingers together on the table. “No, let me. I never thought, when we first met under that tree as children all those years ago…”
“Granger, is he gay?”
He kisses Harry softly, right there beside the train tracks on the empty platform. Presses promises against his skin with his fingertips. Holds him as tightly as he can.
“Do you need us for a case? I was just going to get coffee.”
you were the only link between the two cases and I
“But I’d have come with her anyway,” Harry protests. “She didn’t need to lie.”
If Harry thought that them sleeping together would have softened Draco’s attitude towards him at all, he was sorely mistaken. Instead, the main change is that he’s now met with Draco’s intensity around the clock. He colonises a bedroom on the second floor for his own things, unpacking a far more extensive wardrobe than seems credible for the size of the bag he had with him, and filling every available flat surface with Quidditch books pilfered from Harry’s library. It fills Harry with an unaccountably warm feeling to see him making himself so at home, and also that he chooses to sleep in Harry’s room regardless. Although Harry’s not sure how much he’s actually sleeping, given he always wakes to find the bed empty and Draco sitting at the kitchen table hounding Kreacher for more coffee, buried in playbooks.
“Shove over, Harry,” she laughs, nudging his hip. “These are heavy.” She pushes his toaster out of the way to make room for her pile.
Ron’s mouth thins in frustration.
It doesn’t make any sense to Harry either, but the wealthy witches drifting around Luna’s store swooning over her selection of Plimpy Home Pedicures seem to be happy, so who is he to judge?
Draco gives an exasperated huff. “Everyone is ready.” He gets to his feet, tossing some Galleons on the table for their drinks. “No more waiting. For any of us,” he says pointedly, reaching out for Harry who is almost too surprised to take his hand as the yank of Apparition hits him.
The team fares no better in the second half. It’s as if some of the players are following Harry’s instructions and some of them are following Malfoy’s. What little coordination they had in the beginning completely falls apart, and it begins to look like seven individuals flying around randomly, occasionally hexing a Kestrel in the ankle. The Arrows are nothing more than an inconsequential irritant. When the final whistle sounds, the score is 112-0.
“My father knows nothing about me. He barely knows anything that’s going on in the world around him. He’s deluded. Pathetic.”
” She dashes from the room wiping at her eyes.
A row breaks out almost immediately between the Deputy Minister, who wants to call the Aurors to arrest them all, and the gnarled little wizard who heads the Board of Governors, Augustus Frankopan.
“Which are—” It’s possible Harry dozed off a bit whenever the legal restrictions parts of his training came up.
Hermione sits opposite him, writing up her report in her quick, flowing hand.
Harry sighs and exits the safety bubble, issuing instructions to the rest of the team and asking Masterson for some rooms from which they can work. None of the interviews reveal anything helpful at all, and other than taking a Pensieve memory from the young woman who had seemed to trip the curse, there isn’t much more they can do. When Harry and his team leave the hotel, Malfoy and Sato are still together in their bubble, and the doors are still firmly closed.
. Harry had forgotten it was an option, acting on auto-pilot as he’d made beds and swept the floor.
“It’s
Underneath the mat of tinsel there are gothic-looking baubles and some glowering Christmas angels. Once again, the Black family traditions leave a little to be desired. Harry decides he’ll fare better buying his own. He flips the box closed and digs his case files out of his satchel. Usually paperwork is for the kitchen table, but the twinkling flames in the calendar frame are pretty and so he settles in right there on the creaking sofa. It’s going to be quite the month, he figures he might as well start to get in the mood.
. Pansy claims many a teen witch has used it, hoping to dull the memories of a lost love. In its original form, it’s a very mild form of memory charm, somewhere between a spell to take memories out into a Pensieve and a full
“The staircases are our first hurdle. We were lucky getting up here, but none of the others were pointing where we need them to be.”
“I didn’t give you any reason not to,” Draco responds, his tone still tired. "Former Death Eater, in possession of deadly substances, in close proximity to those dying from deadly substances. It was actually surprisingly well thought out for you for a change, Harry."
“Just like that?” Potter asks.
“Wow,” Potter whistles, impressed. It squeezes something tight inside Draco’s chest. What he would have given for a reaction like that when they were first years. This was the version of Potter that Lucius Malfoy would have wanted him to be friends with when he was ten years old. Or maybe not: this version wouldn’t have been special.
or a basic drying spell.”
The tears that had eluded him in the days since he’d found her body flowed freely then, as he thought about the one dinner that had always been her favourite. Year after year: carefully planned menus, the gardens lit up with floating candles to illuminate the longest night of the year, warming charms that let the guests meander out into the snow-tipped gardens with glasses of heated elven wine. The way she’d sat, right there, at that very desk, poring over the guest list, penning names on to gilt-edged invitations. Where other hostesses used
“I have Teddy,” Draco says, but it lacks the conviction of actually saying
Harry’s just glad there are seven Arrows players and Luna sat between him and Malfoy, so that Malfoy doesn’t get the satisfaction of seeing Harry’s jaw drop open in awe.
The doors to the Great Hall are standing open, one listing slightly on a damaged hinge. Harry doesn’t want to go in, because all he can think is that the dead will still be there, lying on the benches, even as he knows they’re long buried.
Harry’s anger and discomfort with the whole situation is still threatening to get the better of him.
“Luna has agreed to marry me.”
“The inscription is supposed to glow when the person who gave it to you is thinking of you,” she said. “But my grandmother sat right beside me and it doesn’t work. Not since I fell on it.”
salt.”
Rose is heartbroken when he tells her that he’ll be taking all their creations back to his house without her. But really, he can’t risk her slipping on the ice or Hermione seeing the state of things at Grimmauld Place. Christmas will be whisked away from him before he even gets the chance to throw any salt on the floor. But he promises Rose that there are other things she can help him with—carolling for one, the mere thought of which fills him with dread—and that since she’s off school now for the winter break there will be plenty of chances to visit.
and all, and he’s managed to embarrass himself terribly in the process. He totters around to the benches and tugs off his skates as quickly as he can.
But Harry just looks at Hermione. At the fixed line of her jaw and the way her hands are gripping her notebook, knuckles white.
“My clothes!” Harry exclaims, tugging at the scratchy reindeer jumper. “Well, I’m wearing it, what more do you want.”
“Mr and Mrs Malfoy, gathered chums, Gryffindors,” he begins, gesturing grandly around the table with his champagne flute. “As Draco’s newly appointed Best Man, it falls to me to say a few words.”
He’d thought about learning, after the War. But then it seemed unnecessary. It wasn’t as if he needed to go anywhere that he couldn’t get to by Apparating or Floo. He didn’t even have Sirius’ old motorcycle anymore, though he couldn’t remember what had happened to it.
Weasley insists they Side-Along, clutching Draco far too hard at the wrist as if he might simply disappear.

“Yes!”
“He’s transferred to St Mungo’s from that hospital he was at in Paris,” Hermione explains, and there’s something off about the way Ron just nods, clearing the salt and pepper shakers to make room for his platter.
He shrugs at her, still failing to understand. He supposes this is why she takes the time to explain
“Luna?” Hermione asks, as if Luna is going to put an end to this farce, and explain what’s really going on.
Malfoy gets up and dusts off his trousers a little. “Yes, well. I need to shower off three layers of filth and sleep for a week.” He seems awkward now. Uncomfortable. Harry wants to pat the bench beside him and get him to sit down again. He wants to recapture that brief moment from a few seconds ago when Malfoy treated him like one of his friends.
after all.
“Draco helped Neville,” Hermione carries on, pulling a couple of books off of a shelf in such a way that the whole precarious stack starts to quiver, but she just sighs at the covers and stuffs them back in again. “Because of what happened with Nev’s parents. Their family magic was… undirected, I suppose, is the simplest way to explain it.” She tugs out a couple of rolls of parchment and the resulting cloud of dust makes her sneeze.
“Possibly, Potter,” Malfoy drawls from behind him, causing Harry to startle and step quickly to one side so that Malfoy’s able to move past him into the room. “But that doesn’t account for the fact that I apparently know you take your tea with milk and two sugars, and shellfish give you hives.” He smells like the lemon soap in Harry’s bathroom, and some other woody scent that shouldn’t be at all familiar but is. Harry holds his breath for a second trying to keep his balance.
“She’s confessed, so we have to go through that process. But no prosecutor will take her to trial, Harry, you know that as well as I do. There’s no evidence to support her claim.”
here,” he says. “And I think I know how to work out who killed your father, Draco.”
“The machine also makes a very soothing noise,” Luna carries on. “And it’s very affordable.”
“You were there, at dinner. You saw what sort of mood he was in.”
He pauses long enough to get coffees at the cart in the Ministry lobby, and one of those ridiculous tiny pastries Malfoy likes. Harry tried one once and just got sugary flakes all over his robes, but he’s not above bribery in the current circumstances.
Draco picks up his copy of the paper again and reads aloud in a sensationalist tone. “
Ron is still spluttering beside him. “Of
via owl.
“Perhaps they believe,” Draco says calmly, “wrongly, as it turns out, that your previous absences were merely as a result of you being out of the country. And that as you’re here this year, you might like to be involved.”
Draco nods and wandlessly summons the bill. He catches Potter’s surprised expression, which morphs quickly into something heated and a lot more dangerous to Draco’s equilibrium. “I’ve spent years immersed in really ancient magic,” he says by way of explanation. “It’s altered my focus and abilities quite a lot.”
Draco falls to his knees, his eyes closed, his whole body trembling.
“Honestly, mate. I can’t go near a Christmas tree at the moment. Anything could happen. It’s like I’m cursed.”
Harry’s about to ask Neville more questions, but gets cut off when Luna barrels into the room, her lime robes flying. “Oh it’s gorgeous!” she squeals, clutching at the wreath. “Come on, you can help me decorate!” She thrusts an armload of ivy at a hapless-looking Neville, and Harry mumbles an excuse about being late for an unspecified engagement and scuttles for the door before he can be pressed into service up a ladder.
, what are you playing at?!” he yelps, staring at his sister. When she doesn’t reply, he spins around to glare at Draco. “What have you done, Malfoy? I’ll...” He makes to advance across the room.
For a moment, Harry considers abandoning the whole stupid endeavour. It’s not like Malfoy has bothered to write him some sort of personal plea to attend, the way he seemingly has with everyone else. Harry could just not show up. That would probably stop the invitations from coming for good.
“Not now, no. It’s so badly damaged. But the diagnostic charms show that it once was.”
Harry’s pulse is thundering in his ears.
He runs his hand down Draco’s arm, the pads of his fingers smoothing over the faded Mark.
Somehow Malfoy’s humorless, defeated-sounding snort is worse than any sharp retort Harry might have expected.
He spins around at a popping sound behind him, before he realises that Casey and Melinda have started pulling Christmas crackers. Paper hats are donned and weird plastic trinkets exchanged.
“I’ll be in and out in a jiffy,” one woman pleads. “If I don’t get the good turkeys today they’ll be all gone.”
“I thought I’d imagined that. My dad used to read me stories when I was little. I assumed I was dreaming about that, but it was you.”
“Would you like to join us?” Draco tilts his head as he asks, giving a Harry an appraising look. “You’d be well out of your comfort zone. The menu is molecular gastronomy. But there’s a spare seat if you want it.”
“I don’t think we have any way of knowing if the chimneys are opened or sealed.” Neville kneels and sticks his head in the fireplace, looking up. “Bloody dark. Impossible to tell.”
“Occam’s Razor says it was the dodgy squid.”
“I believe they’ve been exposed to the same thing.”
might have been a Slytherin caused Draco to cut dinner at Andromeda’s short and drag him immediately home to bed. Draco’s face heats a little now at the memory.
, a contrarian voice in Harry’s head offers,
He watches them, holding their crouched positions at the back door, a few steps between them and Marsden’s basement. Waiting on the signal from the team at the front. He studies his own face, a mask of concentration that suddenly slips into action. Hermione shouts. The memory shimmers and disappears.
Then he laughs. As if anyone here watches television. Wizards on this side of the pond were perpetually stuck somewhere in the 1940s. He weaves through the crowds, his beanie tugged low over his brow, but no one pays him any attention. It’s a relief as he reaches the front of the queue for the local Apparition point and thinks clearly about the Leaky Cauldron for the first time in a decade.
“I’ve made it clear time and again my position on this,” Harry yells. “And you make out to my face that you’re taking it seriously and behind my back you’re doing something completely different. You used an illegal spell.”
Harry takes a long breath and strides up the wide stone stairs. The double doors swing open in front of him without so much as a knock, and he’s greeted immediately by a free elf in a snappy little uniform, who somehow seems even more impossibly obsequious now that he has his own clothes and is being paid for his services. He insists on taking Harry’s duffle, even though it’s almost twice his size, and grovels and fawns over Harry all the way up to a bedroom on the second floor in the East Wing.
“Lie down, we’ll stretch it out.”
Ron’s face twists even further and the pair of them burst out laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation.
Masterson shows Harry and Padma to the ballroom where the gala will be held, complete with the glass display cases that will hold the jewellery. A Patronus arrives from the Auror team accompanying the pieces from Surrey confirming they’re on their way.
He watches Draco dress, a sight he thinks he could easily get used to, until he catches sight of the time again.
“Apparently they had
“Harry?”
But in any event, Draco Malfoy is definitely not attending a Muggle university in London. So whoever has dreamed up this joke has a warped sense of humour.
love him. Who hasn’t been able to move on. Who had no reason to hold back.”
“Hello, Belle. I’m Harry. I thought it might be a bit lonely in here with no one to hang out with other than bloody Malfoy. He doesn't seem like much of a conversationalist. So I thought I’d read to you for a bit. We can try this one. It’s pretty old, so it might be a bit dull, but they say it’s a classic. I’ll warn you in advance, I’m not a very fast reader. Hermione loses patience with me a lot of the time. But I guess you’ll just have to put up with it.” He pats her still hand in a gesture he hopes is friendly.
“Is this —”
“In the dream,” he goes on. “He knew what I did. He thought I was there to take up the Divination position. He talked about oneiromancy. How does he know what I do?”
Harry doesn’t have an ounce of sympathy for whatever Malfoy’s been through since the war. He didn’t wind up in Azkaban, and as far as Harry’s concerned, that was mercy enough. Harry hasn’t thought about him since.
His research is also progressing, and he’s beginning to realise that the truly unspeakable damage to her ring is directly connected to the way she died. That aspect of it makes him uneasy. Draco’s managed to dig a pretty wide moat between himself and anything connected to Voldemort. It’s hard to be face-to-face each day with tangible evidence of his evil all over again.
They move on to interviewing their own friends. Ginny, up first, is listless as ever and has nothing interesting to add.
“I don’t
Prompt Sixteen:
, actually taking the slightest bit seriously. Well, guess what? It. Was. Me.
“What the fuck would you know, Malfoy.
Harry hears the sound of someone walking down the corridor towards them.
Malfoy gives an incredulous wave at Harry’s torso. “Cover you in glitter!”
Danforth is glaring at him over his spectacles.
“Huh?”
“Did you attend on my mother on Saturday night?” Draco asks. Even though his tone is gentle, Harry notices that he falls readily back into a position of authority, the faintest of echoes of his father — an inescapable part of his past.
“What?” he asks, staggered by her reaction.
Ron shrugs. “She sounds fine. I have to get back to work now. You know, solving actual crimes.”
Harry presses him against the wall again with his hips.
Harry considers him: this strange new Draco, who he never tried to talk to, who he was always falling for just the same.
“There’s a first time for everything. Including hosting Christmas.”
When they finally coast back down for a break, Teddy’s frostiness toward Potter has completely vanished. “Did you play Quidditch like Aunt Ginny?”
. It’s just—”
For some reason, it doesn’t occur to him until he’s dusting himself off, saying, “I brought red wine, but if you prefer white I can go to the store,” that the person chopping vegetables in the kitchen will be Potter.
Draco scowls at him.
a bit pointless, Draco supposes. Calling him something different now isn’t going to change how Draco feels.
,” mutters Lucius Malfoy.
With him.
And, of course. It must be. Draco Malfoy fled to Europe with his mother as soon as his father was sentenced to life in prison and hasn’t been seen since. Harry certainly hasn’t given him a moment’s thought, except perhaps in the general sense that life after the War was a lot more pleasant without the poisonous likes of his ilk around every day. And that under no circumstances should they be allowed to return to wizarding life.
“Definitely before midnight, then?” Ron asks, and Harry nods. Ron looks a little grim, and Harry can’t help but feel the same way. He needs to speak to Draco as soon as possible.
Harry is left alone and confused, face-to-face with the beaten, blackened suit of armour. He has no idea where Draco has gone, or if he’s even still in the Manor. For a moment Harry wonders if he should go back to his own room — or just leave this wretched place entirely. But he remembers his friends.
At this, Malfoy laughs properly. Harry remembers all too well his mocking derisive chuckles, but this is an unfamiliar, delighted sound.
Her frown turns to outright disbelief and then transforms into a very smug smile that Harry definitely doesn’t appreciate. “Maybe you can help the head Curse Breaker … break a curse?”
“The book, Potter,” Malfoy explains, as if to a particularly slow child. “Whatever it is you’re going to read her?”
He arrives in the gathering dusk. The Manor, he’s forced to admit, looks beautiful. Flickering lamps line the gravel drive, winding up to the wide turning circle. The ugly damage inflicted on the ancestral home during the war has been meticulously repaired. A cold shiver runs down Harry’s spine anyway. All the restored stonework in the world can’t remove the feeling that there’s malevolence here, sunk deep in the ground.
was that?” Allsop sneers at Parkinson.
It takes him longer than it should: the Manor an unfriendly warren and Draco being in none of the obvious places. Eventually Harry concedes defeat and enlists the help of a passing elf, who takes Harry up another, narrower, flight of stairs to a set of double doors painted an incongruously bright yellow.
The thing is, Harry doesn’t have a very good explanation. He feels like he discharged whatever debts he might have owed Narcissa and her son both when he spoke for them at their trials. And it’s not as if Malfoy has been particularly friendly or even
“Goodness,” Draco snorts, picking up a shiny copy of
Harry tosses and turns, but there’s no way to get comfortable. That foul man, raging in his decline, jabbing at each of their insecurities, at all their barely healed wounds.

Hermione holds her hands up placatingly. “Look, of
“They’re supposed to match,” Malfoy points out, still holding his at arms’ length, as if it might bite him.
,” she seethes, as much to Hermione as the room at large. Draco reaches out to touch her arm, but she shakes him off.
Hogsmeade is unreasonably cold, and Draco gets irritated all over again that Neville and Hannah somehow won the argument to have the monthly pub night in bloody Scotland for once. They’re all going to wind up drinking too much and someone will be sick on the Portkey home. Probably Finnegan, he just knows it.
“Hermione will understand.”
He nods.
“Well,
Still, he’s surprised that any of this has touched the processes of the Wizengamot, which isn’t known for its progressive approach to... well, anything really. He wonders how much of this has to do with Hermione herself.
“It’s not a curse,” Harry mumbles with a resigned sigh, and heads to the bar for another round.
“That’s right. Once the castle was built, the four founders gathered in a room to imbue Hogwarts with its magic, so that it would live on longer than they would, protecting generations of students to come. We want to complete our ritual in that same room.”
“Very surprising to see you suddenly get into the race like this,” she says. Harry figures she must be a little confused from her accident. There’s been nothing sudden about his campaign. “But I’m sure you’ll do a lovely job, dear,” she assures him, patting him on the hand and smiling for Dennis.
“No, we need to stay here,” Harry says firmly. “We’re together here.”
Unbelievably, Draco’s blush only deepens. “How long do you think we need to stay here?” he asks, and his gaze is so heated Harry would happily Side-Along them home right now, but he still has Robards’ words ringing in his ears.
“Pans,
“But that was it: a final, pointless row in Hermione’s room, rehashing the same topics we’d been over many times before. I returned immediately to my bed. I did not go to Lucius’ study. I did not see anyone else, even the eagle-eyed Mr Potter at the other end of the corridor. And I certainly didn’t kill anyone.”
Hermione snorts, shrugging off her outer robe and hanging it on the coat rack.  “Why are you really here, Harry?”
Draco hums noncommittally. “Just don’t get him started on how the only true rollercoasters are wooden and at Coney Island. It’s considerably less interesting than I’m making it sound.”
Harry blinks rapidly and takes a deep breath. He glances over, but Malfoy has his back to them. He nods.
“Draco, please. You can’t take his place, not when he’s come back to us.”
“But I didn’t order these. They don’t even fit me,” Harry sighs after the man has hung up on him. He figures they must be some ostentatious gift from a well-wisher and throws them in a drawer when he gets home.
“Let’s compare notes at least,” Harry finds himself saying. “Before I … before we decide what to do next.”
it would come back,” Malfoy cautions. “And there’s no reason to think the Astronomy Tower will be any more open than any other part of the castle.”
“You could fix it, you know,” Draco says, mildly, as Harry stumbles into the room. “
to spend time in an office anyway. The whole
“Well, let’s get dressed and go see,” Hermione decides.
“Draco Malfoy?” Ron asks as he returns carrying pudding. Harry wonders for a second why everyone reacts that way, himself included. Lucius is in Azkaban and there’s be no reason for it to be Narcissa.
a glass, of course, but Merlin knows what ancient family crystal he’d smash as a result. So, he creeps on through the darkness, reluctant even to light his wand in case it disturbs the thick silence. At the top of the stairs, though, he hears a noise, just louder than his own breathing — the very muffled sound of shouting. It sounds like someone is having an argument behind heavy doors, but Harry can’t make out who. In this house and given the company, it could be any number of people, and Harry’s far too tired and wound up to care. He continues down the stairs and finds a tray of clean whisky tumblers on a sideboard.
In that moment, it is simply impossible to Harry that anyone in this room killed Lucius Malfoy. He can’t see his way to the end of the story: all the possible answers will just be the start of another mystery.
They’re always the same. Edged in gold, the ink practically announcing itself as having cost more than a week’s worth of groceries. The smug little inscription,
When they go up to bed, Harry looks at the St Mungo’s tree. Clearly magical, the deformed little spruce is still green and hasn’t dropped a single needle. He sticks a sagging bit of tinsel back to the bucket where it’s come free of its Spellotape. And then he has a sudden thought.
“I think it’s this one,” Hermione says, and Malfoy and Neville both move across to look at the book over her shoulder.
“Don’t. Look, I know everyone is apparently
“We’ve worked so hard. We’ve literally done all that we can. So now I just want you to go out there and enjoy it.”
Draco’s chest clenches. They’ve both suffered unimaginable loss, he realises. Harry’s just never seemed interested in facing up to that before now.
“What are you doing?” Harry hears as Ron rushes into the room behind him. “Don’t touch anything.”
Draco takes out a pair of leather gloves and tugs them on to his hands, and Harry starts to feel a bit frantic. He’ll leave and then Harry won’t see him again until the next time he’s injured. Which, granted, happens pretty regularly, but still.
Andromeda gives Teddy just such a kiss on the forehead, causing him to squirm with embarrassment. “Your mum and dad would be very proud of you today,” she says fondly, and Teddy blushes almost as pink as his hair.
He digs in his bag, and pulls out the Wheezes box of decorations. “Here. Maybe these will be a bit more seasonally appropriate.”
Rose is squirming to be let down and when Hermione deposits her on the floor, she immediately climbs up onto Harry’s bed. He’s pretty sure he’s not going to like where this is going.
Harry sometimes wonders why Luna stays friends with him given how truly stupid she appears to think he is. He thinks about Dudley’s Advent calendar, taking pride of place on the refrigerator each year, a piece of chocolate behind every little cardboard door.  Dudley would always have eaten the whole thing by about the 12th of December.
Luna crosses her arms and doesn’t seem at all interested in backing down.
“Yell at me.”
But when he comes out he’s startled to discover that Harry is still there, thankfully in his underwear and a t-shirt now, rummaging around in a bag he must have had shrunken in a pocket the night before. Draco pauses, watching silently as he drags out a rumpled set of dress robes.
Everyone is either staring at him, incredulous, or looking awkwardly at their plates. Everyone except Rose, who is grinning ear to ear and nodding vigorously. Rose is about the only person who genuinely loves coming to Harry’s house. She’s fascinated by the family tree tapestry and makes forts out of the endless piles of books in the library that he keeps meaning to donate to Hogwarts. She happily spends hours climbing the ancient oak that definitely only fits in the garden through magical means, and even though Harry has promised several times that they’ll build her a treehouse and hasn’t gotten around to it yet, she doesn’t seem to hold it against him. Rose is always thrilled that he’s never gotten the mowing charms working on the grass, because it’s almost as tall as she is. And if Rose thinks Harry can host family Christmas, then sod it, he will.
Harry, on the other hand. Even if Parkinson’s right that there will be an offer for him, he can’t take it. He won’t work for Allsop again.
“This was a completely reckless course of action, Malfoy. You’ve endangered Potter’s life, and you’ll face the consequences of that.”
Harry lifts up his wand and stalks toward the doors. He can barely look at Hermione right now. The whole thing is too unbelievable to contemplate. Out in the corridor, he turns left and stomps off to the staircase, but in his irritation he must get turned around because the corridor ends in a rubble-strewn set of steps going up to the fifth floor. Exasperated, he slaps the wall in frustration and spins around, almost tripping over Luna on his heels.
Draco takes out his wand; the tip glows a soft red.
“It’s a troll,” Hermione says with a wet chuckle, swiping at her eyes with her sleeve. “Your Uncle Harry and I first became friends because of a troll, when we were eleven years old.”
Harry’s stomach sinks.
“Who’s lovely?” he asks, rummaging around in Luna’s cabinet.
