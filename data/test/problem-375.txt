He did not answer. Draco waited for the rant or lashing out that always escaped Harry's mouth when Draco accused him but it never came.
Four days later, they had spoken to their friends, Severus, Sirius and Remus. Harry had apologised and they would forgive him, they said, with time.
"We are seeing a mind healer." The announcement was as abrupt as it was curt and Draco opened his mouth to protest but Harry continued "Neville Longbottom. I have researched about him. He is a good healer and he was my good friend. I trust him not to reveal anything about you."
"Be safe." Harry whispers, his voice low and his eyes utterly terrified.
It's strange to witness this side of Draco. She has never been so quiet and it seems strange. Harry wishes that she returns to her old self again.
"Why are you not opposing, headmaster Dumbledore?" Harriet asks the aged wizard who sits back and looks at her, the twinkle in eyes still present.
He would return to Britain and punish those bastards and he would never try to hurt himself. Harry won't be able to live without him. Harry would go mad. He had never imagined that Harry loved him so much. That was the main problem. He needed to trust Harry and for that he needed to talk to Harry.
A soft sound of someone clearing their throat brings Draco out of her trance. She turns her face towards the door. She had thought that perhaps the sudden noise would scare her but it doesn't. She knows that this house is safe and that the dark lord is dead.
Draco needed his help. He was pleading unconsciously with his eyes and Harry could clearly see that Draco just needed him to be close to him. Perhaps his closeness helped Draco.
"Indeed." Dudley spoke and walked towards the entry way with his daughter beside him. She was beautiful and had wide blue eyes. Her hair was long and curly and she extended her hand towards him solemnly "Hello. Uncle Harry." In spite of being just ten, her eyes looked matured and Harry knelt down in front of her, kissing her left cheek. She was after all his family.
Draco was afraid because Harry was behaving too wildly. He ignored Draco's warning and trembled with fury and madness. He pulled his hair and turned to slam his hands on the kitchen slap yet again.
Draco did not speak and Harry waited for the shove that never came.
"Ah!," Lucius said, frowning at him whereas Narcissa leaned back, his eyes very cautious and narrowed. His lips were pressed in a thin line.
"You're the only connection he has with Lily." Snape mutters, "We're doing our best but you know the most about his mother. Maybe you could talk to him- of course, after you are done with grieving."
Draco's eyes were so transparent. As Harry reached him and unbuttoned his shirt, Draco stood wordlessly, looking at him. He could have entered naked of course but Harry knew that Draco was not ready for sex yet.
His response is quick. He nods his head and murmurs, "Of course, you will if that's what you want. Please calm down. No-one is going to force anything on you."
"What was that about, Mr. Potter?" He asks in a very gentle voice but there is something hard beneath the softness. Instead of terrifying him, it makes him shiver all over and it makes him want to feel Draco's strong arms wrapped around his body.
"Here are the papers. May I leave." The girl seemed terrified and fled after Draco nodded curtly.
"I don't know. Why is he not allowed to use that stick of his anyways. I don't understand their rules. Fifteen minutes more- fifteen minutes and then I will-"
"I received a letter from his healer again. It came day before yesterday, a day after his birthday." Severus muttered, his eyes blank. "His condition is getting worse."
"Whatever you want, head auror Black." The man said and Draco stared, stunned. The answer was shocking because since when did Potter agree to anything without an argument. He crossed his arms and met Black's eyes. That Potter didn't call his godfather by his given name didn't escape Draco's notice.
"Will you accompany me?" Draco asked and Harry did not want to meet Remus and Sirius because they would never forgive him. Draco continued "They will forgive you if you meet them in person. They love you and they have always missed your presence."
"But then it means that you spent three summers in the same house then." He murmurs, his eyes blown wide in shock. This hadn't occurred to him.
"Harry." Draco murmurs and Harry doesn't look at him which of course worries him.
"I shouldn't have yelled at you or cursed you. I am sorry." He murmured and Draco took his hands in his own, replying "I understand."
Harry swallows and averts his eyes. He has moved on and doesn't want to change things. He doesn't want Draco Malfoy anymore.
He stares at her naughty green eyes. They are gleaming with mischief. Bloody hell. She is a perfect mix of Lily and James. His hair are still dripping wet and he glares at her. She stand upright and tries to school her features into innocent and guilty ones.
It was Hermione who finally knocked on Harry's door. She smiled when she saw them together. She must have realized the truth when she saw Draco's eyes because her eyes shined and her lips upturned in a smile. Behind her, Ron breathed in relief and Harry wondered when they had started reading Draco so well. He wondered if Draco was surprised as well. He pulled back and saw Draco's eyebrows raised and realized that Draco was surprised as well.
Harry broke and Draco realized that he was speechless and so angry. It was horrifying that someone could be so vile to a little baby.
Draco blinked hard to avoid the images that ran amok in his mind now. Brown eyes stared nervously at him. He would never forget them and he'll also never forget the humiliation he had suffered at this man's hands that night.
"How did you fall?" He asked, changing the topic abruptly and silence ensued in the room.
After a few minutes, Petunia spoke, "You are a very strong man Mr. Malfoy-Potter and I know that you would move on from whatever is torturing you right now."
Harry stared speechlessly as Draco continued, his fingers trembling on his thighs and his eyes shining.
He had not been normal ever since. Draco had left with Granger and had not returned even once. News of his attempted suicide had reached his ears and the fact that Potter has rescued him also reached him.
"WHY CAN'T I EVER BE ENOUGH FOR YOU? WHY MUST I ALWAYS HIDE THINGS IN THE FEAR THAT YOU WILL LEAVE ME?" Draco stopped and a lone tear fell from his left eye. Perhaps, he had restrained it for long. Harry did not speak anything because he wanted Draco to speak out. He wanted to know. "Why do you always calm me down? Why can't you understand that his presence tortures me? He was one of them. He took everything away from me, my dignity, my self respect, my confidence, everything and because of what- because I had teased his family when I was a silly kid. He could just have spoken to me and I would have – would have apologised. Why did he punish me by- by- he took everything from me, he and his bloody wife and his-. They were the reason we always quarrelled, always snatching you away from me. I tried to tell you but you never understood me."
"I don't Draco. No one has a right to touch you without your permission." Harry muttered and wiped his nose after sniffing. He continued after a second's pause, "Just because I am your husband, it does not mean that I had a right to force you or say those horrible things. I am sorry and I can perhaps never forgive myself for slipping. I tried so hard Draco. I -" Harry stopped again because his voice broke and he hated this. He had always hated crying. He hated tears.
"But, I need to know Dr-" Albus stutters, "Potions Master Malfoy's side of things."
"GOD DAMNIT. WHAT THE FUCKING HELL SHOULD I DO TO GAIN YOUR TRUST?" He shouted and Draco's heart raced because he trusted Harry and so he said so "I trust you. Of course, I do."
"It doesn't matter right now and anyways he's no longer fit to be a king. He shouldn't have let his guard down. He should have known that our enemy is waiting for just a small chance. He risked everything because of some affair with you that he just imagined mom having." Harriet said and then closed her eyes.
"But I-" Draco broke off when Harry latched on his nipple again, breathing heavily.
"The elves have prepared some dinner for us." He whispers softly and she looks at him.
She stared at him and kept on staring. His face was quite blank which was strange in itself. He was so still. Her five-year-old son was quite expressive and playful. Who was this boy? Where was she?
"Congratulations." Scorpius grins.
"Harry, is everything okay?" Hermione's concerned eyes regard him. Harry nods. It's been a long time since Riddle's reign ended and Harry still doesn't want to come out of his recluse. The way the wizarding world still works often boils his blood and makes it difficult to exist without voicing his opinions. If he returned, he will want to change things and people probably won't like that. They won't even accept that.
"Harry, listen to me please." Seamus whispers.
He spells the door closed and sits on the edge of the bed.
Severus Snape knew the reason of Draco's insecurity. Draco had told him and had also asked him not to tell anyone. He had told it to Sirius and Remus, though. Though he had been utterly shocked to know, he had not been able to do anything because Draco had discouraged him from taking any step.
"What happened?" He asked in a voice that could not conceal his despair. Granger would have noticed because she spoke softly "Malfoy, calm down."
"It's not about scars. I don't have scars." She says in a small voice and tries to take her hand back. Albus holds it tightly.
"After we are done over here, I will tell you all the options you have Dudley." He spoke and as if on cue, the door was knocked again and Draco entered in, his face red with fury. Tessa was in his arms, her face streaked with tears on Draco's shoulders and Harry was alarmed because Draco's eyes had never been so bloody murderous.
"Yes mother." She replies politely, her voice soft.
"Honestly, Harry, when have I asked you to be formal with me?" Granger snapped at him and all of a sudden she was all professional and turned to speak to her husband "Please remain here Ron. We will return and then talk. Do not enter the room in any circumstances."
Harry would never let him go. He deserved to have a man who would be capable of giving every kind of happiness to him. But Harry would never agree, as long as Draco was alive. Harry deserved better.
He sighs deeply and then looks into Mr. Zabini's eyes before replying bluntly, "I love him."
"Yes." Albus answers quietly.
Harry hugged him back and when Draco pulled back, Harry's eyes were calm "I will have tea if you don't mind. I have not eaten anything so it would be nice to have something to eat as well."
He heard a deep breath been taken and footsteps furiously walking towards his door. When he opened his eyes, he found Narcissa standing there "You need to know it. I think Draco's, ah, fate, after the trials is somehow connected to the secret Lucius has kept buried in his heart for more then three decades."
"I should have understood. I should have known that you felt insecure. I should not have snapped like I did. I am begging you. Please come back." Harry begged him, cheek resting on Draco's head and Draco felt a lump in his throat and tears well in his eyes.
He had thought that perhaps the past did not haunt Draco as it did earlier. Draco had not called himself dirty or anything to degrade himself and Harry was happy to see it.
After a silence of sound three minutes, Draco spoke " I want to thank both of you for bearing with this insanity. We don't know what we would do without you. I want to move on now. I have decided something and want to tell this decision to everyone. Expect my owl tomorrow." Harry was astonished but he was still angry with Draco so he kept his eyes closed.
He had worked relentlessly for five days and had prepared the first batch and Harry was now able to walk by himself, though he limped a bit.
"SELFISH. I AM NOT SELFISH . I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY." Draco screamed and Harry looked at him, wild laughter bubbling in his throat again. "Harry. Please calm down." Draco was on the verge of panic now but Harry was too mad.
Please review
"Why did you lie? Why didn't you tell me that it wasn't just a diary, that it was a horcrux created by a seventeen year old Riddle and that he was feeding off my magic and emotions, that I was only a tool to be used to bring him back, to make the broken pieces of his soul powerful enough to be sewed back."
"Draco-"
"I will give the letter to you. You can read it yourself and you're still married to him, whether you like it or not." Severus muttered and turned away.
"I am sorry but I can't let her do what she wanted." He mutters. She is her godmother and has a say in her life. That is why he is apologizing.
"Shhhhhhh." Black suddenly murmured, her cheeks tinged red and Severus froze as the woman stared into the child's eyes before mumbling, "That's a secret."
The other man smirks before answering, "Maybe you can ask him that is if we do manage to find them. I still think that this search is entirely pointless."
"Here we go. You had to go and marry Potter, Draco. Honestly, of all people-" Father mocked Severus interrupted with a snapped "There is nothing wrong with Harry. Do not make presumptions. He is one of the reasons your son is even alive."
"Then we should have died instead of sending her to that beast. I asked you not to take that bloody mark and you still took it. I have had enough. Once I get my daughter back, I am divorcing you Lucius Malfoy, Malfoy, Black family or pureblood customs be damned." Narcissa hisses. Severus sympathizes with her.
"Where is he?" He asked, looking at Granger. She replied "Room number 2456"
"You can have the separate room if you want." Draco froze at the first stair and nodded in acceptance. "Okay. I will ask the elves to keep our clothes in our respective wardrobes." Draco murmured and added hesitantly "I will keep both of our clothes in your room."
"Yes, Potter. It's not like you have a job. What's the rush?" asked Zabini, his brows creased in a frown. Harriet did not know how to answer. She didn't think that Zabini was mocking her. He looked curious.
Shame on him. He had lost Draco again. He had lost Draco for the second time. Draco had snapped again. It would have been better if he had stayed away from Harry. That way, at least he would be alive.
Finally- finally Petunia accepts it and all because of Lily's son.
"Draco, I am sorry." Father says. The man has the audacity to say sorry as if three words can eliminate her filth, her shame, her pain.
Harry stopped and threw away his wand before walking towards Draco. Draco had no reason to be afraid of Harry. He knew the extent of the man's madness so he just stayed frozen. Thus the shock he went through when Harry punched his chest hard before shrieking "Why did you leave? You are my medicine."
Snape, Harry." Hermione insists.
"I will get the stupid owl. Wait over here." Draco mumbled and crawled out of the bed. Harry let him go after a soft kiss on his lips and a soft "Good morning."
“ I SAID NO." Draco spoke loudly and Harry froze. Draco really did not want to go. He wondered if something had happened at the prior events.
"-she never got anything." The girl continued. She became quiet and her adam's apple bobbed for a few seconds before she continued, "I hate him."
After sending a patronus to Ron and Professor Snape she walked towards the couple slowly. She was on the verge of panic and had controlled herself with great difficulty because their were 90% chances that Harry would be dead. He had already bled so much.
"You're an auror?" Draco asked carefully.
As soon as they left, Harry turned to look at Draco and Draco blinked his eyes hard to convey the truth to Harry and Harry frowned, looking confused. He shook his head only a bit before taking his hand in his own and Harry licked his lips and gave him a barely perceptible nod.
Harry just looked at her quietly and then turned to look at Lucius again who was leaning against the door now. Draco's hands were visible now and the skin was still peeled from there. It had become better since yesterday but it was no where near healed.
"Why didn't you tell us? We could have helped you." James says because he is the eldest and he has always been protective of his siblings.
Petunia sniffs before continuing, "-to her."
"I don't want to argue with you." Albus replies quietly, "You can leave if you wish to."
"You could have died. " Draco whispered and Harry repeated "I am sorry."
"I understand that you reacted wrongly in the heat of the moment. You had plenty of time to assault me if you wanted it but you didn't. So I forgive you. Just forget it." Draco whispered and moved forward, embracing him tightly.
"It's fine, Draco." harry did notice that her eyes were blank and Draco noticed it too because he looked at him worriedly. She continued "Their is no pressure on you. You must tell us when you feel comfortable. You have not taken time to heal yourself. you have spent the past decade ignoring your pain. You must not keep it inside you. You must talk about it with somebody even if it's Harry. We have a lot of time to discuss things. Just know that we were not the ones who perhaps abused and manipulated you. Someone must have polyjuiced as us."
After a pause of a second or two, Draco continued disdainfully, "Where is Potter? As we all know, he's well known for taking rash decisions and getting people in danger, if my memory serves right. I would rather have a partner who's not the finest but but can follow my orders instead of one who hasn't taken a single prudent decision in his entire life."
The woman sat down, sighing deeply. Arthur took her hand in his before muttering quietly, "Don't worry. Everything will be fine."
"Go on. I'll follow you." His voice reached Draco from somewhere inside his room.
As he walks inside the classroom and settles on the furthermost bench in the room, he doesn't look at Draco. A minute or two passes and he takes out his books. Students are whispering amongst themselves. There is so much noise. Harry wants them to shut up. He concentrates on the pages of his potions textbook and tries to tune them out.
"Enter." He said and in came Draco. Draco was trying to look normal but he was not normal.
"Malfoy," Harry said, "He's not the only one who looks ill. I have medicine and food. Come inside."
His eyebrows rose in surprise when he saw Lucius standing there, his wand on the floor. This time his eyes were not unreadable. Far from it, they were clearly showing his guilt, his remorse and Harry closed his eyes again. What was the point now? His guilt would not change anything.
He knew that bathing won't help. This was not the first time this was happening. He used to cast multiple silencing spells in Severus' home to prevent waking him up. He did not feel the need to put up the charm here,  though he always had in the latter years of their marriage when they had slept in different rooms.
"I will stay in touch father. Where are you staying?" Draco blurted in a hurried voice and his cheeks warmed.
"It's been three and a half years since she passed away. You've to move on." Vernon says quietly.
He had realized many things since he had arrived here. Draco had become a successful potions master but Draco had not healed. He also realized that Draco loved Potter unconditionally.
"Sometimes, when I am bathing. Sometimes when I close my eyes to sleep." Draco replied and Harry spoke "You could sleep with me, if you want."
"Yes master." The elf appeared and bowed in front of him, mumbling nonsense under his breath, which was completely ignored by Harry.
Severus stares at the child. Harry does this sometimes. He calls him 'father' and Sirius 'dad' and never ceases to amaze him. How did he end up as a father of Potter's five year old, naughty, adorable and intelligent son. Being a father or having a family was never in the cards for him.
"You are a broken man, Draco. Poor little Draco. Always needing to die to run from his problems. You are not the person I loved. He was not a defeatist. He fought with his circumstances. He became a spy for our side against his father's wishes. After the trials I was shocked, shocked that you would accept the sentence. I had expected you to fight, no matter who was the minister of magic or the wizengamot judge."
After a couple of minutes, he walked towards the kitchen. Draco was humming a tune and was making some baked vegetables. He had prepared some fried rice to go with it and turned around when he heard Harry enter.
"Ron. Hermione." Harry murmured and Hermione blinked before looking at them. Ron's face was still white though now there were spots of red on his cheeks which were the symbols of his increasing fury.
Harry places a finger on his lips when Narcissa is about to say something and replies, "Sure. We'll leave after breakfast. There is a very beautiful garden at a bit of distance from here. It has a big pond and ducks and swans. You will love it."
Abruptly, he pulls his chair back and gets up. Draco is so surprised that she takes a step back. Realizing her nervous movement, she breathes deeply and waits for Mr. Potter to say something.
"Help yourself to anything you want. This is Harry's house after all." Draco said bitterly. He did not why these words had escaped his mouth but Harry effectively stopped everyone with his sharp words "Please have a seat and let Draco talk. This is our house Draco and no one who has hurt you will ever be welcome in this house. Do not ever repeat this sentence again."
Harry opens his mouth to say something but Ron's sudden "Ahem" stops him. There is a warning in Ron's eyes and his back is too stiff. Some heads turn in their direction. Ginny breaks the tension by standing and declaring, "I am finished too. Harry, I'll come with you."
"Scorpius, sit down, will you?" Scorpius makes a face at Albus and sits down beside him.
How was he supposed to get back to Hogwarts now?
Ron nods and leaves the room wordlessly but not before looking at Harry. Harry is sure that Ron will stand at the door with Hermione to know what is happening.
"It wasn't. It-"
"That you have not gotten over what happened more than a decade back, that you are so averse to me touching you that you had to hit me. I am your husband Draco. You should have just asked me to stop." Harry muttered and Draco snapped at him, "I tried. I -"
"Oh! I will definitely tell you today. Come on, let's leave." He glared at her and held her wrist painfully. She winced and said "Draco, please-"
Draco staggered and slumped on the bed, staring into his green eyes. They were- Sweet Merlin, Harry's eyes screamed murder. They were so angry that Draco could just stare. The man was practically shaking with anger.
"I was angry and hadn't meant it. I-" she said and stopped speaking when she felt fingers enclosed around her wrist. She looked up to find Vernon staring at her.
Draco rolls his eyes.
"Your mother is coming over tomorrow morning." He whispers gently and she doesn't reply. She only goes through the motions and stares at him.
"You will see. Please bring it. I think I will need a vial."
Harry was never like normal kids. But then Sirius had never expected that, not with James as his father and Lily as his mother. James had always been a master manipulator. He could charm the pants off anyone. Lily had always been very righteous, what with the way she always stood up for Severus when they teased him. Harry turned out to be a very naughty yet a very adorable and decent five year old baby.
"Do you know anything about all this?" Harry asks his kids.
"It's quite secluded, eh?" Corner murmurs.
"Draco." He spoke loudly and knocked on the door. But Draco did not answer. The only answer he received was the increase of his sobs.
But Harry knows that he can only run so much. He has not eaten anything since morning although his uncle and aunt and even Dudley tried to feed him. They have changed. The most visible change is that they are no longer rude to him. His room looks like a room. They got the walls painted green and installed a chair, a table and a closet for him. The closet had a few clothes and they were brand new which was utterly astonishing.
"I was not following you. I was just walking," Potter muttered, having completely turned around to gaze at him.
Draco stares at the ceiling. She has nothing on her except for the thin blanket. He commanded her to stay put, to wait for him as she is right now. Her face is drenched with tears. Her body is broken and it's not because her body is broken that he has gone. She doesn't know why but some death eater brought some information because of which he had to leave.
Harry was upset and worried but he did not let any of it appear on his face, not even when Draco tried to breathe his fragrance again while helping him shower. He let Draco do what he need to live in peace, even if it was for a few moments. The memories will return and torture Draco again.
With trembling hands, Harry opens the door. He knows not to believe what he hasn't witnessed with his own eyes. But the evidence of Draco's infidelity is glaring at him for Draco is not just with Seamus. Marcus Flint is with them too. They are standing in various states of undress.
"No." He answers. She doesn't know about Draco and him. Atleast, Harry thinks that she doesn't.
"Come let's go." Draco said and held her in his arms before apparating. Before he disappeared though, Harry had the pleasure of watching Tessa's beautiful eyes become enormous and bright with surprise and delight.
"Where are you-" Draco started and Harry screamed "Accio my wand." His wand flew in his hands and he glared furiously at Draco "IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT."
"DOES IT RING ANY BELLS, DRACO. YOU USED TO BURST IN MY CLASS TOO, BLAMING ME OF SLEEPING AROUND BEHIND YOU JUST BECAUSE I WAS DEMOSTARTING SOME DUELLING MOVE TO MY STUDENT. WHAT RIGHT DID YOU HAVE?" Harry was panting by now and so was Draco but it did not stop Draco from shoving Harry off and screaming at him "YOU WERE ALWAYS BLOODY LATE, PRIORITISING YOUR STUDENTS OVER ME, OVER YOUR OWN HUSBAND."
"Narcissa, please-"
"Mr. Potter." Draco says and Albus's eyes shoot at him. There is something in his voice that alarms Albus. He didn't see anything, did he? He couldn't have entered without letting Albus know. Maybe Albus is just very transparent because Draco's silver eyes are frozen on his face. They are unreadable and Albus can not understand them, no matter how much he wants to.
"Do you have any shame?" the boy asked, his brows furrowed and his eyes utterly, utterly disgusted.
It was ridiculous in a way. Who had thought that he would miss Draco so much? Each and every gesture and word haunted Harry. Every time, when Harry had just ignored Draco or his efforts to please Harry haunted him endlessly.
"Voldemort Potter. He was not Riddle. He was Voldemort, an insane version of Riddle. His mind, body language, personality did not resemble Riddle's at all. He had all but forgotten everything. He didn't even remember his goals. He was just an insane monster."
"What's wrong? Did I say something?" Draco whispers. He wishes he was over his past. He wishes that he could let Harry make love to him. Harry places his face in his hands and shudders again. Draco sits up in concern and tries to pull his hands away from his face. Harry's eyes are pained and Draco can't bear it. He leans forward and kisses his lips softly before whispering, "What's the matter?"
Weasley nodded and stood up "Ok. I will take my leave then. Have a nice day."
"Nothing." Ginny murmurs, "Hermione and Ron would definitely know something."
She looked into his eyes, as if trying to decide something and he looked back at her with kind and soft eyes.
"Hello." He replied, turning his face a bit to acknowledge the red head. It was difficult since Harry was resting in his lap so he turned back to his Harry staring.
Harriet breathed, his hands shaking in frustration, "I know that you're somehow behind everything that's happened in the past few days."
Harry stroked it and Draco said " He wanted to wax my hair and used boiling wax to do it." Harry noticed the way Draco's voice broke off pressed his cheek on the scar.
"You don' trust me at all." Harry replied as a matter of fact and Draco just stared, wondering where all this was coming from. "What do you mean? Of course I trust you."
"None of us knew Draco. Lucius acted upon his own. He didn't tell anyone at all." Severus murmurs, his eyes pooled regret and pain.
Both Draco and Hermione stared at him in shock. Harry shrugged, his eyes on Draco's face and his hands holding Draco's tightly "Draco is my priority and this is the truth. She has never behaved politely with you."
"I remember how you used to rant about her eyes and hair
She hopes she gets a role in his upcoming movie. The audition starts in ten minutes. She was so nervous that she arrived an entire hour early. What little money mom gave her before father asked her to leave is running out. Acting wasn't her first choice of work but she only just graduated a year ago and was pursuing her potions mastery when father kicked her out. She needs money to study and has no source of income. This was the first thing that came to her mind. This is her seventh audition and she is frightened. James Potter detests father. She is afraid he will reject her as soon as his eyes fall upon her. She wishes she could just apologize for whatever father did to hurt him and she would if she knew what it was that father really did.
Draco's voice broke while he said this and Harry's heart ached for him. Draco needed to share it. Yes he had told what led him but he needed to share what ever made him feel rotten from inside.
"It does not concern you." Draco said and his eyes were a bit hurt. Harry knew that Draco was under a misconception that Harry did not care so he decided to clear his doubts "There are other ways to find Draco. I could have already tried but I did not, not because I don't care, but because I do not want you to be compelled to do anything at all. Mark my words and remember them, the moment I realize the identity of this person and his friends, I will destroy them and I will find everything, no matter you want or not. I have a hunch as to who the writer is. I will give you time to tell me. If you don't, I will have to take steps."
Harry hasn't dated since he divorced Ginny. Even when they were together, he lived as a recluse and didn't contact anyone unless absolutely necessary. As soon as Lily turned five, they filed for the divorce. He had thought that he was incapable of having a normal relationship. But now Harry can't look away from Draco. She is standing in front of him. Her hair is wet and water droplets are trickling down her cheeks. Her blank eyes are twin pools of molten silver.

Draco was sleeping on a very broad pillow. He burrowed his cheeks on it and hummed. Then he hugged his pillow tightly. Only when he heard Harry's chuckles, did he realize that the pillow was a actually Harry's chest.
Harry groans in pain when he pulls his hair again and the man starts laughing manically before slapping Harry tightly. Harry stumbles on the floor. Bellatrix joins the man and starts laughing too and they start kicking him. Harry knows that his ribs have broken and his left arm feels numb and his knees are bleeding.
"Did Sirius tell you about who your partner is?" He asked.
She stood up with a polite, "I shall take my leave, then. Have a good day, headmaster," and was at the door when she heard Albus' polite, "I would like you to teach DADA."
"Tessa. Will you like to go with Uncle Draco." Dudley asked and Tessa turned towards her dad. She nodded slowly and turned towards Draco "Yes. Thank you. Uncle Draco."
"I don't think that it will come to begging. Pack quickly. I am taking you to order's headquarter." Severus mutters and leans back before closing his eyes.
"Do you think- " Blaise looks at him and takes a deep breath before continuing almost gently, "Do you think that he knows? Maybe Finnigan told him."
"Lord Burbage didn't want us to disturb the muggles living here." Weasley declares roughly and Draco rolls his eyes and even that slight movement is painful. His eyes are burning. He really needs to sleep.
godson." He mutters in a bored voice. Harry's head snaps up to look at him.
Kreacher gave the letter to him and vanished after giving him a significant look.
was the head auror.
"Invitation to a ministry party. They are always sending these. I ignore them mostly." Draco muttered and Harry replied "Let's go. It will be our first time together to a public event."
It was very obvious that Draco was uncomfortable and did not want this to continue but he also knew that he couldn't stop. Draco needed to stop Harry. Draco needed to realize that he did not have to rush, that he could set the pace and so Harry smiled and nodded.
As seconds pass, Draco comes closer.
Harry seeks solace in Draco's arms, his thoughts still on how he had been a moment away from destroying the only man who had trusted and loved him and placed his life in Harry's hands.
." He hears a soft voice in his mind and answers as softly, "
Cooking reminded him of Draco and he just couldn't stand to be alone in the place. So that idea went down the drain as well. Then he decided to go for a jog. Half an hour later, he realized that he had no stamina at all.
"I'll remove your memories but won't obliviate you. It-"
Draco opened his mouth to speak and Harry did not let him speak at all "Don't tell me lies. I have seen the letter and the-" Harry breathed deeply and continued "the photos as well. Why did you do this and do not tell me lies. I want to hear the truth."
Draco did not look at Harry and though Harry understood the reason, he knew that Draco must talk to someone. He saw the way Draco's hands crawled to a place on his shoulders to rub and clean nonexistent dirt.
She eats it quietly. Potter serves something for himself after a few minutes. She doesn't look at him.
Harry opened his mouth and then closed it. His nostrils flared a little and Albus chuckled, "At least I can finally see for myself how much of a
He remembered the fear, the agony he went through each time someone looked at him with disgust in his eyes and still proceeded to fuck him and then left him bloody and torn somewhere in a dirty alley or near garbage.
For the past few weeks, Draco had lived with Harry and had decided to give their marriage another chance. Severus could already see the differences, some of them good and some bad.
When he turned around, Draco was laid on the bed staring at him. He unbuttoned his pants and shrugged them off and his boxers followed his pants. He found himself stark naked in front of his very panicked husband and wanted to stop but realized that he had to wait for Draco to stop him.
"Look Hermione. Just stop it. I have had enough of your coddling. I'm fine. Will you just- " Potter stops mid speech and their eyes meet. There is something off with Potter today. For one, his eyes are not sparkling and for another, they are tired and quite red. Draco saw Potter just yesterday evening. He was fine at that time.
Finally, Lucius started, "How much do you love my son, Harry?" and Harry stared at Lucius. Lucius looked at him, his right ankle on his left knee and his arms crossed.
"Profess
As Tracey's terrified eyes dance in the forefront of Harriet's mind again and again, her nostrils flare and her eyes shoot open. She can't hide the fact that Malfoy is her mate forever from the man. He must either accept or reject her so that she can move on. Her knees feel weak as she stands and removes her cloak. Thereafter, she walks inside the castle. Everyone must be wondering where she was. She must talk to Snape. Only he can force Malfoy to be at least reasonable and reject her instead of tormenting her or giving her away to the aurors.
"Well, there will be no sorting - just a group of students studying. I do not think there should be any problem," Dumbledore said. Harriet's eyes fell upon the sorting hat that lay on a side table. It seemed that it was staring back at her. Harriet looked away.
"May I come in, Mr. Potter?" She asks. The man is seated behind his desk. He looks up at her with slightly surprised eyes.
She turns and stares at the occupants. Severus is looking at her. His eyes are cold. Draco doesn't remember him looking so cold like ever.
"Hmmm." Draco answered while opening Harry's wardrobe to clean it. It was an absolute mess. He gathered the clothes in a pile to get them washed and started casting cleaning charms on the shelves.
Harry pulled Draco in his arms and placed his head on Draco's shoulders. Draco stroked his hair and whispered "I love you."
Harry had never asked him. He had never expressed his desire to know about Draco's past. He had never wanted to understand the reason behind Draco's over possessiveness and insecurity. He averted his eyes bitterly from Harry's and backed away with a cough so as to clear his throat.
"What do you want? Ask for it."
"Are you insane Harry. Nothing happened." Draco spoke, utterly stunned and Harry closed his eyes, muttering, "Because you pushed me off at the right moment. It could have."
He had entertained the thought of not avenging Draco for an entire day but Draco's burnt body and his whimpers had not let him stick to that decision.
His question is answered by Snape who slumps on a chair in front of Harry before murmuring, "She is at the the Riddle Manor. The dark Lord threatened Lucius with death in case he doesn't take Draco to him so Lucius left her at the dark lord's manor."
But, it was Vernon who answered. Dudley looked much too furious and tired to say anything.
She got up and turned to get out of this house. It seemed haunted. She started running because suddenly the house seemed like a maze and she couldn't find the door. It felt that hours had passed when she finally saw the door and then she ran to her bedroom and slipped inside the blanket. She closed her eyes and tried so hard to sleep. However, when she woke up and looked at the calendar, she found that she had still not gone back. She had slept for two hours. The smell was there - present and intolerable. Not knowing what to do, she decided to meet Dumbledore. He would certainly know what was happening.
Scorpius looks at the man from the corner of his eyes. His hands are pushed in his pockets and he's looking straight ahead. It's always been like this between them. This's not the first time they're going out. James likes to pretend that they're eating out as friends, that James isn't interested in dating him. Scorpius has his own reasons of avoiding the topic. He loves James' company.
"And then there was a time when you complimented her way of eating and walking." She says.
He turned towards their other guests as well "I apologise to all of you for being rude to you over the past many years."
He summons her things quickly and apparates right inside Gremmauld place. After being proven innocent, Black transformed it into a a proper manor that rivals Lucius's magnificent mansion. It is not protected by fidilious and has a lot of windows and no dark artefacts, The portrait of Walburga is rotting in the storeroom.
"Shhhhh. Are you off your rocker? We can't tell anyone about it. He trusted us with the information. Shut up and keep searching. He is injured and should be somewhere close by." Weasley growls.
"It's Malfoy's fault. I wasn't hungry before he came." Harry hisses into Snape's face who snorts.
"Don't drink again tonight." Blaise insisted and Harry nodded before replying, "Yes. Okay. I won't. Not tonight."
"Where is Harry?" She asks. She decides to call him by his first name now onwards. Harry is a nice name and rolls off her tongue quite easily.
"Oh and yes... no one can see you till this cloak is covering you. Use it well." He mutters and takes the cloak off her hands before placing it all over her.
"Harry
"Stop. Please stop Draco." It was Harry who was not sitting behind him now. His cheeks were streaked with tears. He had somehow shifted in front of him and was wiping Draco's eyes. Draco wondered why because he was not crying, was he?
"Oh! Harry." Hermione sobbed on his chest and Harry did not have any chance to say anything at all because in the next moment, she went flying in the opposite direction and would have hit the wall, had she not cast a quick cushioning charm.
He tries to sleep but sleep eludes him. Draco's words replay over and over again in his mind, tormenting him to no end. The person he had been in love with had never existed. He doesn't know when the hours pass and sun rises. Morning dawns and sunlights streams inside through the windows and Harry finds himself still staring at the ceiling.
Harry just stared at Draco and tried to gather his thoughts.
After a pause of two minutes, Harry continued "Please stay with me for a few months. I don't want to take Hermione and Ron's help. I am sorry to be a burden on you but-"
He stops mid-speech when Dudley comes running inside. He has reduced around twenty kgs since that incident with those ghastly dementors but he is still very fat. Where an year ago, it had not mattered to Vernon, it terrifies him now, especially when he looks at Harry.
He fell quiet again.
"Enter." Black answered, amusement clear in his tone.
"HE IS DEAD AND YOU KILLED HIM AND WE STOOD THEIR AS HE SUFFOCATED TO DEATH," Dudley continued shouting, his chest rising and falling and his eyes red and damp from unshed tears.
"I have already told you that I did what I did because I wanted to - not because Albus asked me to or because I saw Lily in you or because I had to pay Potter's debt off. I did it because I wanted to but you still continue-"
"I am so sorry. We never talked about your past. I should have known. I should have understood. I am sorry that I was late. But I will help you. Please, give me a chance." Harry's voice broke and Draco whispered "You deserve better Harry. You do not deserve the emotional baggage that comes with me. I will never heal. Please move on. You have your entire life in front of you."
"Let's get you settled down in your room."
"What is it, Lucius? Just spit it out." Severus finally snapped, his eyes curious.
Harry looked towards the gate and started walking, grumbling under his breath, "Bloody Malfoy."
"Tell me. You don't have to scared of anyone. We will punish him and take you away. But if you keep quiet, then we won't be able to punish him."
"Might as well call Granger." Draco sniggered, "Potter can't as much as breathe without her permission."
Harry shakes his head and Albus sighs heavily.
"Yes," she answered.
They had bags under them and Harry looked tired. A few seconds later, he saw something akin to fury flash in them but it was gone in the blink of an eye and they turned blank.
He looked around and noticed that Dudley's eyes were tearing as well. His eyes had regret and an apology and Harry found himself forgiving them.
"Ah! But I do need to bother him." She mutters and settles on the sofa, "Blaise! Look who has come to meet us."
Draco whirls around.
"But-"She said and he shook his head, his eyes firmly on Draco's furious ones "No buts. He is my husband and you must leave. I never interfere between you and Ron, do I?"
his boyfriend and he doesn't really need to beg. He could walk in and just take it from Blaise's wardrobe. Draco just couldn't. He was too proud for it. He had some money, the most of which went towards the rent of the one bedroom flat he rented at the Diagon Alley.
"Spare me from your clumsiness Potter. I am already late." Draco drawls coldly before turning around and walking away with hurried steps. Only a few moments elapse before Potter shoots up and starts following him.
After that he excused himself to return to his husband.
"You are powerful and influential. You-"
Meanwhile, Draco was shaking with his head on Harry's chest. With soft hands, he hugged Draco and felt Draco burrow in his chest, still shaking.
Weasley sighed and continued "We can convince him to stay with us if you cannot stay with him because of your busy schedule or anything else."
"There go your BLOODY DIVORCE PAPERS. I LOVE YOU AND I WON'T SIGN ANY DIVORCE PAPERS. TO THE HELL WITH EVERYTHING. I WILL NEVER, NEVER SIGN ANY DIVORCE PAPERS. YOU WILL GET RID OF ME ONLY AFTER MY DEATH AND IT IS APPROACHING QUICKLY, SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY." Harry was panting by the end of it and he did not have any strength to shout any more so he spoke coolly "With the quantity of alcohol I consume, it will not be long before you receive a call from Hermione about my sudden death-"
Draco stops speaking suddenly and his sharp, narrowed eyes flicker over everyone. A bead of sweat gathers on Albus's forehead when they settle on him and blink twice.
"I'll give the post to you if you kiss me right now." Potter mutters after crossing his arms and leaning against the wall. He looks fit and handsome and
Harriet made a face before turning to look at the headmaster.
She sighs deeply before muttering, "she's only ten. She'll get over it."
"I was your best friend. I have always been. You never told me." Severus muttered, his voice devoid of any emotion and Lucius replied curtly, "He did not want anyone to know. He wanted to keep it a secret. Though I did not care about him-" Lucius stopped speaking and Harry realized that Lucius was lying through his teeth, "-I didn't want my parents to know."
His green eyes gleam with fury and Draco takes his hands in his. Ginny glares at their entwined fingers.
His voice must have betrayed his anger because Draco flinched again "If you want me to leave, please just tell me. I know that I am not the same for you. I know that those photos have broken you."
She closes the door behind herself and leans against it. Her eyes are dark and blank.
The car jerks to a stop and Harry screams in pain. God... it hurts so much.
"Maybe I should take care of it." She murmurs bluntly. He stares at her- like literally stares in shock.
Draco opened his eyes and blinked hard. The last thing he remembered was that he had hanged himself. What had happened after that? Why was he still alive?
It took a few moments for Weasley to stand up and look at him. Aurors passed them, paying no attention to Draco or Weasley.
This being said, Draco turns towards father. His eyes are overly bright and his back is stiff. His lips are pinched together.
But he couldn't calm down. It was easy for the woman to ask him to calm down but he couldn't even breathe properly. He couldn't survive in a world devoid of Harry.
Potter stay silent and his eyes stay annoyingly blank.
"Tell me Draco. What have you been hiding? Why are you so scared all the time, especially when Ron and Hermione are around. You try to hide it behind your anger but I can always see the fear in your eyes." Harry started and Draco cut him off "I can't tell you. I just can't. I just need you. Please I-I just - please -"
"I am not a teddy bear." Draco replied indignantly and Harry just hugged him tighter "You are my cute teddy bear."
So he spent the day sleeping in his room which seemed so big and empty. Actually, the whole house seemed empty and it was difficult to stay alone in it with Draco's parting words haunting his mind.
"Don't do it again Harry." He whispered softly and Harry replied, his voice equally soft "I won't as long as you don't. It depends on you really. I refuse to live without you. I have led fifteen long years in loneliness at my relatives's and I refuse to live like that again. SO there is that. It depends on you now."
All the images of his past and present were spinning in his head.
Harry sighed and whispered "I did hurt him and you must stop bothering him like this."
After opening the front door, Harry summoned his biggest umbrella and walked down the path that his front garden had and out of the main gate and there, beside the dustbin were sitting two people - a child and a man and both had blonde hair. Their heads were bent and they were eating a dirty burger that they had obviously taken out of his dustbin. They were soaked.
Then, came a soft voice, "My father is not self-obsessed."
"I am the one who should be furious Harry. You had been disrespectful with me or have you forgotten? You still owe me an apology." Sirius murmured, his voice soft.
Tonight though, tonight- something is different. Something is totally off. A week and a half has passed and it's almost midnight. Unable to sleep, Harry is reading.
"All right then. I will clean the sitting area and the kitchen. You can take the two master bedrooms and one guestroom." Harry spoke softly. It was surprising that Harry heard his unspoken words too.
He walked very slowly towards the bed and crawled upon it. After straddling Draco's legs, he unbuttoned Draco's trousers and then unzipped them. That was when Draco choked out "Stop. Stop. Please." And looked at him.
Potter casts sonorus on his throat and booms, "Lord Voldemort has been defeated. All the aurors and DA and the order members are requested to gather in the outer room."
"I don't. Keep away from us." Severus warns him. Meanwhile Harriet attaches herself to Severus's legs, her small body shaking. Severus wonders whether she is crying or whether she is just terrified. Black is knelt beside the child. But the girl refuses to go in Black's arms. Severus doesn't understand why Harriet is not afraid of him. By the look Draco is giving to him, he clearly is. All these years and he still doesn't understand Severus. The one who is at fault is of course Lucius.
Over the next week they fall into a rhythm or rather Draco does. Harry tries to bring her out of it. Try as he might, he can't.
Snape nods and leaves the room.
In the matter of minutes, the water was boiling and Draco cried in pain. He wanted to die, to end his worthless life. He wanted to feel clean. He knew that the hot water would eventually burn him and he would die a slow and agonising death and then Harry's face came into his mind. Harry would be devastated.
"Stay in your limits Petunia. You don't want me turn your husband and son into elephants that they are. If I realize that you hit her, I-"
He had never accepted the clients willingly, so as to speak. Oh! Yes, his basic human needs had compelled him to take up a client but he had never succumbed willingly. At the end, they had- It was impossible to think about it. In France, it had been easy to forget it but here in Britain, memories came back and he did not want to set a foot out of his house.
"Seeing as my mere kisses disgust you, I thought perhaps I would discomfort you as well." He whispered bitterly and walked towards the bed.
Sirius shook his head and his smile faltered, "I'll tell him today. Don't worry about him, Draco. He won't make a fuss."
"Why didn't you tell your parents?" He asks. His throat feels heavy. He wonders what she went through. Will she even be able to recover. Can anyone recover from this kind of thing. He hadn't known that -
Then five years ago, the prophet covered news about Potter's death. The photos of his dead body were all over the newspaper. Unlike what Draco had expected, the wizarding world had celebrated the untimely death of their fallen hero. It was like the entire world breathed a collective sigh of relief when they realized that someone as powerful as Harry Potter was dead and that they would never have to face another power akin to Lord Voldemort again.
"I lied. I liked them and I still wear them in my most important meetings, though I have a variety of robes now." Draco replied and left, closing the door behind him with a softly mumbled "This does not change anything. I am not good for you. You deserve better than me."
"What are you planning to do Weasley?" He snapped at her impatiently and she just stared outside the window. Her supposed 'accomplices' were annoying but useful.
After several minutes, Draco stopped crying and just slumped in Harry's arms.
Something had been nagging Harry. Something was compelling him to return to Draco. Four hours had passed and he had been wanting to see Draco for the last half an hour.
Harriet breathed quietly.
"Just shut up." Albus snaps and as usual Scorpius only chuckles before locking the car and following him inside.
"What do you mean ?" Harry asked, his eyes keen and surprised.
They had to be lying. Why were they -
He did not know what Draco was going through. He understood a bit but how could he understand everything if Draco did not speak a word. He knew that Draco did not speak to him about it because he thought that Harry would not be able to listen to it and yes to a certain extent he was right.
It was so bloody clear that Draco was trying to please him. The kiss was good and Harry loved every minute of it. It was not forced. Draco loved him and loved kissing him but right now Harry knew that fear was as much as the reason of this kiss as was desire. Draco's eyelids lowered and he changed his angle to get a better access to Harry's mouth and Harry started hating himself.
"Please put on something decent." He murmurs politely and clenches his hand into fists. She is not an object. She is a human being and is in pain. He has to remember this to keep his mind on track.
There is a lump in Harry's throat. He can't bear to imagine the vile things that that monster might be doing to Draco. How is Harry supposed to react to this? His heart beats have sped up and his eyes are prickling. How can this man be such a bastard? Harry wants to cry because merlin knows why but he loves Draco Malfoy. She is annoying and she keeps on snapping at him. She is never civil but he loves her.
"Why did you do it, you brat?" He snaps at her and she grins, "Aunt Siri says that you look cute when you are startled."
"It's okay. I forgive you, aunt Petunia. You must calm down. Shhh." The words escaped his mouth and he was surprised because he had not known that he had the heart to forgive them.
"HOW DARE YOU?" She screams at him and he whispers, "Please calm down. Please."
"Yes," Dumbledore answered, "That's exactly what I'm saying, Molly."
Belatedly, he realized that he was sobbing openly now, tears streaming down his cheeks, tears that he had restrained. People might think that he was being dramatic but he knew that he was not acting. He was in agony. With his forearm, he wiped his left eye and then right and mumbled "Enough. I don't want any revenge. We will see a mind healer. His health is my priority."
"No one dies, Harry. Some day you will move on." Draco stopped because it was impossible to do this. He wanted Harry so desperately. Nevertheless, he continued "You will move on and will find someone who will make you happy. I will never heal. I will always be insecure and over possessive and I don't want to cage you. You deserve better than me."
"I am sorry." Mom said. Harriet sighed.
Draco doesn't respond. Harry knows that this isn't the end of it. Draco will try again. The rest of the class is uneventful and Draco doesn't attempt to talk to him again.
On the other hand, Harry was prioritising Draco's past struggles to his and Draco was looking subdued and his eyes were distant and had a little terror in them.
Sirius was the only source of information they had right now. Ginny would just get Sirius murdered and the flee away if she realized that Harry could get him to spill everything. He couldn't be rash. He needed evidence to finish them off. Rest assured, once he has secured enough evidence, they would regret the day they decided to destroy Draco's life.
His dark eyes narrowed at her, "That's not a request. That's a king's order."
She also invited him to live with them in France but Draco refused. He chose not to work in the past but he is still a potions master and Pansy can't steal his talent, his passion from him.
"We have company, Harry." Draco spoke in a voice that could barely conceal his desire, completely distracted from the fact that he had just wanted to kill their unexpected visitors.
"Severus calm down." Black mutters but he ignores her. He glares at Lucius who is just looking shocked. Harriet is in his arms. He looks so strange with a child in his arms. Narcissa is blinking her eyes quite rapidly as if trying to wrap her mind around everything that's happening.
He was surprised when Draco narrowed his eyes and pulled back, only to shift and bite the pulse point on Harry's neck hard. Harry moaned lowly and clutched Draco's hair hard. Draco did not pull back, choosing to suck the mark he had put on his neck.
I do not own Harry Potter, nor any of the characters from the books or movies. I do not make any money from the writing of this story. All the characters belong to JK Rowling and her associates
They shake their heads before Lily answers, "We didn't otherwise we already would have asked you to help. He has been very secretive for the past few years and uses your cloak quite frequently."
. You want to dig their past, eh? You want to date -" the man chuckles again, "-date Draco as in long term dating, eh? You are welcome to try but I'll have no part in it. I tried my best and I don't have the strength or desire to do this
He opens his mouth and then closes it. He will just have to man up and resist the urges. She is reaching out and he must to help her.
Why were his eyes shining with unshed tears as his aunt sobbed on his shirt mumbling "I am sorry. So very sorry. I should have loved you. I punished a child. Lily will never forgive me."
Draco pushed the door and walked inside. Black was behind his desk. There were several files on it.
"I tried to repress your magic and never knew that Dudley was a wizard as well. I hated a child, an innocent child and god punished me through my own son and granddaughter." She spoke and fell on his knees. Finally, Harry came out of his shocked stupor and cast a quick reparo through a flick of his hand. The cup, as good as new, flew on the table and Harry walked towards his aunt.
He had just touched the first button of Draco's shirt when Draco lifted his right hand and punched Harry right on his right cheek before backing off.
Harry just stared at the man incredulously "I will just order more. You are wasting your bloody time." He mocked and Draco looked at him with his eyes narrowed.
She is staring at him, as if surprised by something he did.
"The great hall, my lady."
"Please, be coming inside, master. Master and mistress are waiting for you in the drawing room."
Five minutes later, she finds herself surrounded by her mother, Severus, Granger, Weasley and Sirius Black and of course Potter.
"I am sorry." Draco murmured and looked at Severus apologetically.
That was the moment, he looked at the house. It was an absolute mess with clothes scattered all over the sitting room and it seemed that Harry had not got it cleaned at all.
"Why do you want to get marked by that monster?" She asks. Draco ignores her and pushes his hands deep inside his pockets.
It had been a decade since Harry had spoken to Black, him or Lupin properly. He had accused them of letting him stay with Dursleys instead of taking him in. He spoke through floo or owl and only when they wished. Technically speaking, Black was completely innocent. He had been in Azkaban and Severus had said this to the brat.
. Harry looked back at the sky. Why did this always happen to him? Dudley would never let him live this down. His cousin had been waiting for something like this to happen. In fact, they had bet upon it a few days ago and Harry lost it just now - all thanks to Malfoy who was still staring at him with those captiva -
And then she laughed and laughed because it was just a matter of time that they would return. She had owled those letters to instigate Harry's wrath.
Draco simply shook his head and looked at his lunch. Harry closed his eyes and sighed. He opened his eyes when he heard a small voice "I won't try to please you with sex. "
Harry slammed the door open and closed it. Draco was still unconscious and he walked blindly towards the bed. After lying down on it, he just stared at his husband's face. A minute later, the door opened and Harry did not need to turn around to know the identity of the visitor.
"OKAY." Draco shouted, irritated by Harry's ridiculous behaviour.
He twists his face to get a better access and then joins their lips yet again. This time he dives right in. He devours her mouth. A low growl escapes his mouth as he pulls back.
"Draco, please." He pleaded and Draco smirked, "Soon." and licked Harry's lips. Harry just moaned and buried his face in his husband's neck.
"She is done, isn't she dad?" He asks sharply. Dad is a good man and he would never take advantage of someone and Harry trusts him implicitly but right now he just has a very strong feeling.
Harry looked at him with eyes that were so soft that Draco had to avert his own from them. Harry had changed so much. He did not push Draco for anything and Draco was worried that Harry was burying his own emotions inside himself. He would have to find an opportunity to talk to harry about it.
He stops and then adds as an after thought, "Don't try to help anyone. You are not in a state to help. If you do wish to help, you could provide any healing potions that you have brewed or you can brew to Hogwarts infirmary. Your mother is helping at the infirmary too."
Who said that pain was always physical? Draco's pain had never ceased. A decade had passed and Draco still had that haunted look in his eyes.
He turned to look at Hermione. She stared at him, stunned for a couple of seconds before clearing his throat "Unfortunately, this is true but I am never biased with my patients, Harry. Believe me, I have realized my mistake as far as Draco is concerned. I will turn around Draco and you can just shift your trousers a bit so that I can check your hip area and when I will check your legs, I will cover your hips. I will cover your legs when I check your back and chest. I will wear gloves so you don't not need to worry. Harry can sit with you and hold your hands if that will comfort you."
"I was only trying to find a bathroom that would open. Does that relieve your mind, oh girl-who-lived-to-be-nuisance," he snapped at her.
Draco would have responded but a voice stopped him in his tracks. It belonged to his father, whom he had been avoiding ever since he had seen him near the entrance.
"Now, shall i take you to your bedroom?" Blaise asked and sat down across him on the other sofa. Harry shook his head silently and laid down.
Harry cleared his throat and started "Yesterday, before I came here, I had wanted go to loo but when I tried, I fell down. Somehow, I managed to finish my business and returned to my bed. But then I felt thirsty and went to take water from the table and stumbled again. My leg was aching."
"It's - what can I say now? It's over. It's done with. You can't change anything now." She mutters tonelessly, her eyes welling with tears once again.
Harry was about to speak something but a soft voice interrupted him.
"Wasn't-" Draco trembled again and Harry crawled in front of him to hug him properly. When Harry's arms wrapped around Draco, the blonde completely broke down. He cried, actually, wailed would be a better word. Draco started wailing. It was like he was letting all his grief out. There were so many questions that were still unanswered but Harry did not know anything except the fact that Draco was so hurt and he had hidden it from everyone.
"You're always a very good boy, Harry." Severus mutters honestly and the child's lips stretch in a wide smile.
It was days like today when Harry wondered if Dudley was right when he said that Harry just attracted trouble.
Granger was at the door when Draco whispered "Thank you. I was right. You are the best healer, all over Britain and France."
"Harry, open the door," she murmured, feeling suffocated.
"Unca Sevvus." Harriet's soft voice reaches him and forces him to focus on present. Draco is staring at him in shock and Lucius is finally placing the child down.
She went on, nevertheless "I had a look at the effected area. It is apparent that you had whipped him with a stick." She turned towards him and smiled weakly "Relax, Draco. It will take a few minutes." Draco was so mesmerized by her behaviour that he opened his mouth and closed it. She walked towards him slowly and he relaxed. Harry stood their, still staring in shock. He came out of his stupor and walked towards Draco and sat down. Draco wondered why Harry did not defend himself. Harry had never lifted a hand on him.
Draco was not healing at all. At this rate, he would have to take Draco to a professional mind healer and he knew that Draco would never agree to that.
Ignoring her husband, Dumbledore, "Ms Potter, have you had the chance to go out of the castle."
didn't say that it was a time turner. Uncle Ron did." James continues, "Of course, while aunt Hermione was away. He also asked me to accompany you, no matter what."
Vernon doesn't say anything. Petunia looks back at the child.
Instead of answering him, mom looks at dad and utters gently, "You know that it's time. We can't change our past."
"NO, GET OUT. OUT. GET OUT YOU BASTARD." Draco's eyes shot open when he heard these words. He turned his head and saw Harry shouting on the top of his voice, beads of perspiration trickling down his cheeks.
Dad pulls back, takes a deep breath and asks blankly, "That's besides the point. How did you find this room?"
"Yes, I like him." Scorpius answers him, "But you don't have anything to worry about."
Very blankly he stood next to Harry. He looked at the ceiling while Harry tried to engage him in a conversation. But Draco could not reply. He could not look at his parents. They had had so many dreams for him, so many aspirations and ambitions. He had failed. He had sold his body. He had become a slut. He had driven his parents away from Britain.
Harriet did not reply. She kept on walking and took the right turn that led them straight to the staff room and then she stopped beside the door. She could not outrightly for their help without being forced to answer their questions but she could let them help her this way. She heard Zabini mutter that he would sit with the Weasleys. She stifled the urge to laugh. Zabini was a bi and she knew what his smirk meant and as amused as she was, she kept her face impassive. It became easier as the days passed by.
According to Sirius, Harry was not on talking terms with him and he was really friendly with Draco. Draco had never really noticed the tight hugs that Sirius always gave to him or the way he had found the man looking at his arse a few times in the past but now it was coming to him. Sirius had always wanted to touch him in one way or the other.
"Just-" He starts but stops when he hears Potter's furious voice.
"Come on Harry. Lets go. It's over. We have things to do. We can involve my parents in the party planning too. They would enjoy it. We will celebrate in the Malfoy manor." He murmurs and Harry looks at him with soft eyes, searching for something.
"You do." Harry said and Draco shrugged "It's okay. I would perhaps fall into the well of despair but you will be there to catch me so it's okay."
Everyone stares at her. That's when she realizes that many people are there in the room. Her year mates, her professors, aurors, her godfather and Potter. They are frozen at spot and Draco looks at her father with betrayal in her eyes, "You gave me away."
"That's the point. Our son is under a misconception that we are ashamed of him. He has not met us even once since we returned. Your parents are proud of the man you have become Draco. You are everything I ever wanted you to be, smart intelligent successful. Most importantly, we-" Father broke off and Harry dragged him by his hand towards the dais. He had been hiding from people and as soon as they saw him, they cleared the way for him.
Harry just shrugged "I was insane to have thought so. I miss your lullabies terribly. Will you please sing?"
He opened the letter and noticed that some photographs were attached at the back of it.
Every ounce of anger that his face had displayed had vanished and Harry wondered if it had always been so easy to calm him down.
"Is this about your
He had no choice, though, because the trio walked directly towards them, not knowing how alarmed Harry and his best friends were.
"Now, I want one in which you're with Percy and Penelope," Creevy muttered. Draco sighed in relief. He was sure Percy would be decent. But Potter's eyes were still upset and her back stayed stiff with tension.
"Where are Jameson and William?" She asked. The former was thirteen years old and and the latter was only five. They would need to be guarded at all times.
He had not even realized when his eyes had closed and he had covered his head with both of his hands, whimpering as if he was in pain.
"I am sorry that your effort went wasted." Draco spoke, his eyes on Harry now and Harry smiled "It is worth it. I want revenge as well. Now that you are with me, I can set the academy in Britain all over again. Perhaps, we can make it a Duelling and potions academy. I am certain many students would want internship under the great Draco Malfoy. I think that I will give the necessary examinations and become a professional Duellist."
Voldemort nodded and walked quietly, keeping a watch for that blonde brat. He was a ball of energy and called Voldemort 'Mr Riddle'. It was something Voldemort had allowed because he did not want him saying his name in a gathering full of his followers. The boy did not understand the fear that his name carried. Voldemort did not like seven year olds - especially ones like Lucius' brat. He was noisy and inquisitive. He was forever disturbing Voldemort with his endless questions.
"Go away." He snapped and Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's waist. "GO AWAY DAMNIT." Draco shouted again and Harry placed his head on Draco's shoulder.
"No-one can hurt Harry." Sirius says.
Harry looks deep into his eyes and leans closer. Snape doesn't move. He doesn't even blink. He literally has frozen.
At thirty nine, Draco is a handsome man with a lean, athletic body. He has broad shoulders and a flat stomach and doesn't look a day over twenty five. Usually, he dresses in muggle clothes. Today he has put on a cream colored shirt and black jeans. No one feature makes him so striking. Although Albus would say that his eyes come close. They are silver and intoxicating and when they fall on Albus, he can't help but shiver under their scrutiny.
"I was successful in brain washing you because you wanted to ruin him deep inside your heart. I did not imperio you. You were the one who came up with the plan and the one who was polyjuiced as Hermione. You were polyjuiced as one of those bastards who fucked him the first time. Do not think that I have forgotten it." She threatened him and he swallowed before continuing, "There is no point in all this. Harry is happily married to him."
"No, Jameson. I need to go and you'll stay here and continue your lessons and will protect William and won't tell Ron and Hermione." She ordered. He took a deep breath, bowed his head and she turned around.
His hands squeezed Draco's pert hips hard and he could feel the sigh of relief that Draco emitted.
"Mr. Malfoy pw- no - p-llleeeaaasse."
Father cuts her off, practically yelling at this point, "Yes, I wanted to help him. Back then, I believed in what he believed. I believed that he was right and I wanted him to guide our world towards the path of greatness. But I did not want him to touch you. I did not want him to hurt you. I did not want him to violate you. I spoke to him and he agreed to spare you and he did spare you, did he not?"
Entirely too much like Lily. That one. Stubborn and ready to do anything for those she loves.
"Please, stand here, Harriet. I want a few photographs only. It won't take much time." Draco recognised the sickeningly sweet voice. It belonged to Colin Creevy who was forever following Potter at school to take her photographs.
Dad has always been emotionally detached. Albus doesn't know how dad knows about his crush on Draco but he does and he has become even more distant ever since Albus broke up with Scorpius.
"KEEP HER ON A BLOODY LEASH. SHE HAS BEEN HOUNDING ME FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS." He shouted on the top of his voice and it had been so long since Harry had heard Draco's voice from so close. He stared at Draco's lips.
Draco simply shrugs before answering them, "Just leave me alone for a few days. I will meet you when I join Hogwarts. I need a bit of silence and I just need to be alone for a few days."
"Good luck doing that," Pansy snorted, not looking up from her book. Granger's fist loosened at that. Draco blinked his eyes rapidly, still not understanding and he hated not understanding but he couldn't interfere in her life. She was married and had a husband and three children. He would not go and make everything awkward because he had misunderstood the situation.
" I know you are awake Harry. You can avoid talking to us all you want but I will be back and then we will talk to you and Draco about this. I have had enough." Hermione was relieved and angry at him.
Harry freezes when he hears the words. He would know this voice anywhere. It belongs Seamus.
Potter's eyes widen and her mouth opens in surprise. A couple of moments later, her wings start folding and then disappear entirely.
They did not get any time to talk though because before anyone could say anything, they heard a loud, "Harry. Draco." and Draco froze. It was Black.
"The ministry would hurt them Harry. They have to remain in hiding because of that." He argued and Harry's voice rose a bit "I don't want you hurt. You don't understand. I know. I know that it would overwhelm you and perhaps weaken you and I know that you would hate that."
"Narcissa please calm down. Death eaters are swarming outside." He murmurs, knelt on his knees in front of her. She doesn't stop screaming.
Harry's anger rose and Draco's hand which was holding his on his thigh squeezed hard.
"Look-" Draco started and Harry cut him off "On the top of everything, you think that I do not deserve you." Harry snorted loudly because it was so bloody amusing. "I, who has not done anything but wallow in my misery for the past decade do not deserve you, the best potions Master after Severus Snape of the last fifty years. No one would believe this Draco. Complete Britain wants you to return. They would welcome you with open arms. And me." Harry chuckled before continuing "Had you not come back, I would still be lying in some dark alley, drunk and wasting my life. If it is anyone , it is me who doesn't deserve you. Ask Hermione or Ron. They will gladly tell you. In fact, they will thank you for getting rid of the innumerable alcoholic drinks that were strewn all over this house. You will never agree but I would never have been able to start my academy if you were not their."
"You are welcome Draco. " Ron spoke and Hermione taunted Harry " Draco is so well mannered Harry. The least you could do is thank me like he has. "
"Mr. Malfoy." It was Ron who said this and Draco had forgotten about Ron's presence at all. He looked around to find Remus gone. He must have been guilty and sad and must have escaped through the floo. Hermione was sitting silently, her eyes sad.
"You have nothing to be sorry about. I am sorry for saying all that bullshit." Harry spoke softly. But Draco wouldn't look at him. He was quiet and Harry knew there was no point of comforting the man. No words Harry could say would soothe the sting.
"Hermione." Ron spoke worriedly and she blinked. Her cheeks felt wet and she realized that she was crying. "Are you all right?"
Silence ensued for the next few minutes.
At times like these, Draco did not understand Harry at all. Harry licked all the blood and the place he had bitten and then he bit Draco's ear, mumbling "You are mine. MINE. MINE."
Draco wanted to say many things, that he trusted Harry, that he would tell him everything but he realized that he couldn't say anything at all. The strength to speak left him and he just nodded his head, choosing to stay completely silent.
Draco felt a bout of revulsion when Sirius nuzzled his nose in his throat but when he felt the tip of his tongue graze his skin, Draco's mouth fell open. Harry was staring at them. Sirius's hands wandered on his arse and the small of his back and rested there.
"Harry, don't-" Draco uttered and Harry, stumbled and fell down on the floor, horrified when he saw the damage on Draco's hips and inside his anus. "Harry, I am – I can explain. I will conceal them and you don't have to see them ever again. I am sorry-"
"BRING MY DAUGHTER BACK, YOU BASTARD." Narcissa shouts at the top of her voice and then starts screaming loudly, "DRACOOOOOO."
His glass almost fell from his hands and Hermione and Ron gasped in astonishment because three familiar faces came towards them. He had stayed away from everyone for the past decade and so had his best friends. The reason was very simple. Weasley family and their school friends did not support their decision.
"Malfoy Manor. Do bring Harry with you.."
"There is no point. Shut up, Cissa." Lucius growled and Narcissa continued in a firmer voice "He will find out by other means. You were not only one who knew about
"Shit Harry." Ron cursed and Hermione continued, frustratedly "Shit indeed."
"Okay." Scorpius says and looks at the wall, reminiscing the conversation he had with his father long back when he was only eight...
"We know that you can not face us yet but know that your parents love you and will stand by you, no matter what happens. You are not alone Draco. Your family is with you and so is Potter. Potter loves you Draco. We heard that you tried to commit suicide. Why do you wish to-" Draco was horrified because his father's voice broke. His father who never, never broke down, in no circumstance, his voice broke. Mother continued for father "Why do you wish to leave your old parents alone Draco? We miss you and we are sorry to be the reason of your sufferings. Please forgive us. If you don't wish to see us for a while, it's okay. Write to us. Meet us when you are comfortable but do not try to- to-"
She stared speechlessly at him.
"Draco, listen to me." Harry whispered as he sat up and his voice broke. He had never imagined that he will have to say these things. But it was necessary. He loved Draco, no matter what he had done the last night. He had never loved anyone as he loved Draco and thank god, Draco had punched him before things had gotten out of hand.
She nods and he repeats, "Close your eyes. Sleep."
Draco inhaled Harry's neck deeply and Harry was really alarmed now. Draco was not stopping. He was trembling and crying and was in pain and Harry could feel his own eyes prickling. He could feel his heart aching to comfort the blonde but he did not know how.
Feeling eyes boring on his skull, he turns his face around and finds Ginny staring at him. Zabini is staring at the table. He seems deep in thought. Scorpius doesn't understand why the man acts so indifferently towards him. He used to be father's best friend at one time. Not that he would be getting these answers anytime soon. Why did father leave him with uncle Remus when he could easily have left him with mother or Zabini? Why did he leave in the first place? Why did he wait until Scorpius and Albus were eleven?
As usual, the owl handed over the letter to him and flew away.
Draco heard the last bit and shook his head "I don't understand why they did so. They barely knew me at all. Why did they lead me there? I was so hungry and tired. No one would give me a job. I would have lived on scraps or perhaps died, which would have been better then what I did. I just want to forget it. Why, oh! Why? I had never hurt them at all. I hate them so very much for-for-"
Petunia nods. She won't treat Harry or Dudley like she treated Lily. But it won't bring her sister back. It won't.
"Never reached him. I don't know what happened of them. But they did not reach him and he is still my husband. The fact that I have stayed away from him for the past four years does not change the reality of my relationship with him. You were one of the major reasons of our quarrels." He replied angrily and this time Harry moved between them because it seemed that Draco would slap her again and Harry wanted to avoid it.
The child turns to look at Snape and says, "I tow -uh- to-l-d you, uncle Severus." and then, "Pwease give me that letter and the bag."
"Turn around please." He whispered and Draco turned around hesitantly.
Harry glared at the man and got only a snort in response.
"But-"
The fact that he had been entrusted in Vernon's hands to be bathed chilled his blood and made him want to puke.
"You are broke." Potter cuts Draco off and leans back, "She took everything from you."
"Why can't you-"
"Lucius, I know you think that James was not interested in anything except shagging you but-"
Then casts a non verbal legilimency spell and attempts to enter his mind. However, unlike the time he pried on dad's memories, he is met by a wall that throws him out. He learned legilimency from uncle Severus who had taught the art to Draco too.
"Well, I do. I love you the most."
Harry stares at him.
"May I, please?" A pretty girl stood up and walked towards him cautiously. She reached him and looked at his neck. It was plain that she wanted to drink from him and was controlling herself with much difficulty.
Harry cast a wordless spell and then cast it thrice to remove all the glamour and concealing charms from the area.
"Yes, Master." The elf spoke and bowed before disappearing. The blonde had the audacity to ignore him. What happened was not just his fault. Draco had been equally responsible and perhaps it was time to show that to Draco.
"Yes, Ms Potter," came the gentle reply.
"Albus." Ginny starts. Her eyes are soft as she looks at her son, "I really don't know where Harry is. We weren't on speaking terms."
Lucius opens his mouth to deny the request because they don't allow anyone except Draco in the gardens. But then the green-eyed child steps away from Severus and stands in front of him. Lucius stares at him, expecting him to throw a fit like his son does. But the child only stands in front of Lucius with his hands joined in front of his legs and his eyes huge and very very green.
He looks up to find Black and Severus snickering at him.
"What have you been working on Ms. Potter?" He asks.
Harry looked at them, startled at the invitation. Father left after that and Mother gave them a little smile, her eyes sad before following father.
"Shut up." Potter mutters and stands in front of the hideous monster, straight and proud, his eyes flashing.
Well, this was unexpected. he hadn't known that St. Mungos could do that.
"Merlin! I can't." He whispered desperately and placed his hands on Draco's hips before pressing his lips in the junction of his neck and shoulder. He sucked the skin and Draco protested weekly, "Harry please."
She is staring at her with her lips slightly parted, her eyes a bit wide.
He was still lost in his musings when all of a sudden, Sirius ran inside and hugged him tightly. Harry was in front of him and he turned around to look at them. Draco froze when Sirius buried his face in Draco's neck.
"Dad wants breakfast," Dudley said. His voice was deep and his tone was bland. It was impossible to judge what he was thinking. Slowly, other things started registering her mind. There was a smell in the room - not very strong but there. She looked around and searched for the calendar and then gasped when she saw that it was 24th August 2029. It had been 23rd August 2019 when she had slept. What was happening?
"What are you staring at? Cat got your tongue?" Draco snorts.
"You won't understand, would you. You have never gone through what I - we did so do not-" she was cut off Scorpius who muttered politely, "she won't want you to carry hatred in your heart."
Draco nodded in acceptance and stood up. When he left, Harry called his guests "Please come back."
"He will hurt you Harry." Hermione was now standing and had her hands on his shoulder. Draco's eyes narrowed murderously "I will hurt her if she repeats this sentence again. Had I wanted to hurt you, I would have hurt you. Ask her to leave."
Tracey's wings are beautiful. They are flapping behind her. Her body is trembling. Harriet points her wand on them and casts a quick spell. It will reduce the pain when - if they cut her wings off.
"Riddle is not a seer but he is the most intelligent wizard our world ever saw and he is brilliant at everything. He knew his future right from the starting from when he created the first horcrux." Draco murmurs. She looks back at the fireplace.
When Harry was done with both nipples, they were hard and tight and Draco was looking at him with lust in his eyes. There was a silent plea in those silver eyes too, a plea to reduce the pain, the pain that only Harry saw in those eyes, that he saw daily and couldn't do anything to reduce it.
Someone knocks his door and he presses the quill a bit too hard on the parchment. The nib breaks and Severus drawls, "Enter."
for you Dumbledore," Bill interrupted with gritted teeth and got ignored as Dumbledore continued calmly, "-Potter. I'll tell you once I know something. Try not to leave the castle at all and do not, in any circumstances go beyond the second floor. Let me know if any of you find out more about this - ah - unusual situation."
"I am with you." Draco whispered and pressed his forehead to Harry's "Breathe. I am with you."
They had struck a deal and Draco had agreed to supply the potions to them for an agreed consideration.
"AHHHHHH." He screamed in pain and ran towards Harry's room, not bothering to cover himself at all. The water was dripping on the floor and he was bleeding from somewhere, leaving blood trails behind him.
He had known that Draco would say this. They needed to see Neville.
"I did not- I never- Harry I am not gay. Something is wrong and he is still hiding something, something crucial." Weasley whimpered and Draco snarled "Ask him to leave. Ask him to stay away from us."
Perhaps, he would make Draco realize that no one except him would be able to tolerate Harry's eccentricities and insecurities.
Black's fingers that were intertwined, clenched and so did his jaw. Something akin to anger flashed in his eyes but he stayed quiet. He swallowed a couple of times, his eyes boring into Draco's as he attempted to calm himself down.
All Draco could do was stare at Harry for the next couple of seconds. Harry's wrist started bleeding profusely.
"Soon. Soon enough, you will know." Ginny replied in a dangerously soft voice and laughed loudly, excited to ruin Malfoy again for snatching Harry away from her.
It was Harry who broke the uncomfortable silence "Ummm, we can just see another healer. Hermione will be biased with your case, Draco. She has never been fond of you."
"She is right. Mark my words. Potter will
"Do it elsewhere, then."
"Wait." Weasley exclaimed and he breathed deeply before forcing out a, "Yes."
Whatever George and Neville were about to say was interrupted by Draco's return. He came inside and stood beside Harry. There was no evidence of tears or a breakdown on his face now. His brave husband was back and Harry was proud of Draco.
Draco had struck the deal with the vampire coven the day next to his confrontation with Harry and his friends and had not wanted to make a big deal out of it. But Harry had been so proud of him and had taken him to celebrate in the most expensive restaurant of France. He had expressed his pride innumerable times that day. Draco had never known that Harry could change so much.
They can't change Harriet's childhood. They can only make this second childhood of hers memorable.
Scorpius studies Zabini carefully. He mightn't remember everything but he remembers many things. Father had tried to hide his job from him. All he knew was that it wasn't a respectable job and that father was very unhappy. Uncle Harry was a very stern man. They were supposed to address him as sir and were scolded if they forgot. He was the very definition of an arrogant snob.
"I don't understand. How is this possible. The time Turner was invented in 2005 -"
In the end, Harry did not let Draco crucio or kill Vernon. Draco had wanted to atleast maim him beyond repair. Harry had practically held his shoulders to restrain Draco when Vernon had gloated about terrifying Harry and Tessa. The most astonishing thing was that Dudley had finally grown a spine. He had punched Vernon, not once but several times and Draco had contributed. Harry was astonished to see that Draco knew how to fight non magically.
Harry squeals excitedly before wrapping his small arms around Severus's neck and kissing his cheeks.
Dumbledore would know what to do. He always did.
He could've become an auror but that won't have helped him achieve what he wanted to. Ministry would still run the way it used to. He didn't have the patience or the energy to even attempt to change things.
But then Harry's hands were back on Draco's half unbuttoned shirt and his eyes were looking into Draco's again and Draco was starting to sweat again.
Scorpius sighs and they eat quietly for a few minutes. James looks up at him but gives him space and time to think.
"Ron, open the blue trunk and bring me the red and blue vial quickly. Quick Ron. He is in pain. Harry stop pouring the water now."
"Draco. You know that I love you more than anyone else. I won't leave you, no matter what." He whispered soothingly and Draco turned around finally to look at him. His eyes were desperate and he was silent. Harry looked into his silver eyes and realized another thing that had confused him for the past few days. Draco needed constant reassurances that Harry won't leave him, that Harry loved him and now when he looked into his husband's soft but desperate eyes, he understood the depth of that insecurity. If Draco needed a reassurance, Harry would say it again. He would say it hundred times, if required, if it gave Draco even an ounce of peace.
"Fancy seeing you here Severus." He mutters incredulously and Severus looks coolly at him. Honestly Draco wonders how Severus gets younger as he ages. His presence is still a bit terrifying and his eyes are as unreadable as ever. His robes are still black but his hair are shorter and shinier.
He gathers his courage and finally looks at Draco and realizes that he will never forget Draco's betrayal but he doesn't think that he can live with it. When their eyes meet, Draco's eyes widen in something akin to panic. Harry breathes deeply and looks pointedly in Seamus's direction. Draco blinks a few times, attempting to conceal his panic but fails because Harry has already seen it, "I saw you yesterday and I heard."
They had slept separately but Harry had checked upon him atleast twice a night. He was aware because he could barely sleep at all. He had gotten used to sleeping with Harry but he did not want to be close to anyone yet. Returning to Britain was difficult.
"What did you dream?" He asked and Draco just shook his head crawling on his lap again. Harry stroked his hair and kissed his cheek "You can tell me." But Draco did not say anything, just looking at nothing, with unblinking and sad eyes.
"You don't understand. " Draco moaned and slid down the wall, his hands on his face.
Somewhere in her mind, Petunia knew that she was on the verge of a breakdown. Dudley was crying, knelt on his knees, pounding the wall with his hands. His balled fists were sparkling and so were Vernon's hands. He was rubbing Dudley's back - whispering something, trying to calm him down. Tears were trickling down Vernon's cheeks. Petunia could hardly believe her eyes. Dudley hadn't shown the signs of being a wizard and Vernon was non-magical.
"Please." Her voice loses its aggression very suddenly, "Look at me like you usually do."
He continues, "But, I want to date you. I want to try if we can work it out. I trust you. Trusting Draco was a wrong decision and the one I am going to regret for my entire life."
For example, Harry was trying to understand Draco and was currently sitting in front of him to talk about him and Draco's eyes looked less tortured when he visited.
A few seconds later, she found herself inside her old house. It was abnormally cold in here and it was stinking unbearably. She was losing her hopes and starting to believe her husband and son. Her heart sank and a lump formed in her throat. She was not a murderer.
"I've waited long enough. Either you move on or you reconcile with Harry. He won't stop drinking and I cannot see him dying." She spoke softly and Draco just stared at the nosy woman.
The wizarding world was horrible to slytherins after the final battle. Harry had only just graduated and he attended the trials and forced the wizengamot to pardon everyone who was less then twenty. They did. He stayed until Lily was born and then he left. Ginny wasn't happy with him and he wasn't happy to see the world return to their old hypocritical ways.
"Come on in. I'll call the Weasleys over and we'll have Treacle tart and cakes and you'll finally understand that no-one hates you." He says and she gapes at him in shock.
"You can send Narcissa to Godric's Hollow too." Harry murmurs and Snape looks at her, "Yes I can but I think that she might be able to help at Hogwarts. She had been practicing as a healer before the Dark lord came back. Granger is only starting so she can look after Draco but she can't look after more complicated injuries."
Finally, Draco came out of his stupor and nodded. Harry tapped Draco's nose lovingly with his and retreated to the bath again. He noticed that Draco did not move for several minutes.
"I know that you are a potions master. Although I do wonder if maybe you have lost your touch." Potter's words are teasing but his voice is still soft.
Hermione hugged Draco lightly and Ron touched his shoulder. The others just nodded at Draco and hugged Harry lightly before leaving. Fred, George and Longbottom murmured "Keep in touch mate" to which he nodded.
"You mean that he-" He can't even bring himself to complete the sentence.
Lucius flicked his finger and Harry's eyebrows rose when a ring appeared on his third finger. It was a diamond ring and the diamond was shaped as a stag which perhaps symbolised his father.
The man stops speaking abruptly.
"And even
"Please, Draco. Undress. Just remove your trousers and underwear and turn around. I would do it myself but you are simply not ready for that kind of intimacy." Harry murmured and he was so angry and worried. Draco must have hidden scars very well. He had never noticed them. Knife created deep scars, which meant Draco had never got them healed. Why had he hidden them for so long?
Scorpius stops the car in front of the Zabini manor. It's a huge place with a garden and a swimming pool and a gym and is beautiful but it looks more like a hotel and less like a house. Lupin residence, though not this big, was cozy and spacious enough and he would prefer it any day over this large, empty manor. He doesn't want to meet mom but he's running out of options. There were not many people who were close enough to dad to be his confidante and with uncle Ron and aunt Hermione out of the equation, he doesn't have many alternatives.
