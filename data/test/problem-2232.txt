"This has to happen Harry. If I could be with you I would, I swear. But I can't. I'm too tempted to tell you everything and I can't let myself do that, so I'm staying away for now. I promise after this is over I won't do something like this again, just please, trust me."
They all become shocked at the news and I nod solemnly.
"But it's practically impossible."
He tilts his head, "Ice breaker?"
I shook my head, "Tom, wait."
Harry blinks rapidly, "errr yes, yes I am" his confusion makes me want to laugh but Ron is still in fanboy mode saying, "no way prove it!" Harry not understanding what was going on just looks at me utterly lost, making me really smile widely in amusement at the situation I've just put myself through. I just push his hair back to show the famous lightning bolt scar then quickly smooth it down and fix it not knowing if it would upset Harry. I knew how it felt to be marked with something you didn't want. "Oh my gosh you are Harry Potter!" Harry just nodded with a skeptical look towards Ron, and I decided to take pity and fill him in.
"For now just rest Draco and I'll come back later to check on you. If you need me just yell, I'll be in the next room brewing. Harry stay and keep an eye on him if you like."
tonic and a shine potion, that'll make it look very luscious. And think of all the braids and hair styles we can do after!"
I knew I should sleep but I couldn't bring myself to do it, as my mind became more and more defenseless. The older I get the more I start reverting to my war mindset, and I'm afraid. But I just breath in and calmly make my way down to make some sausage rolls from scratch. I always liked to indulge in some every once in a while and now seemed like a good time as any to do so.
I give a slight smile, "Yes, it's always been a fault of mine."
-Peter Pettigrew is an animagus and somehow is involved
That's all I can remember from the last time line so hopefully it's enough. The days pass as I spend all my time with the house elves in the kitchen helping them and cooking food for Harry, I also bake to relieve stress and it doesn't hurt to send some to Harry either. It's become a coping mechanism for me whenever I get flash backs or nightmares from the war, I'm afraid of what I'll do when I get back to school. I can't be waking everyone up from nightmares I'm not even supposed to have, and the flinching and reflexes I developed will be hard to wave away as well. Sighing I make myself comfortable in bed anxious for tomorrow, it's finally come, I go back to Hogwarts tomorrow.
All I got back was that Draco wasn't in any state to reply to any messages, and would reassure me that he would be better soon, through his wailing.
Everything is going pretty smoothly But I don't dismiss the warning and feel my heart skip a beat when I'm called to be a demonstrator. I take in a deep breath and follow the directions to a T, and I smile at succeeding. My victory is cut short by Blaise rushing forward with that fake mask of superiority and a,
It's quiet and Sev just looks somber. "He comes back, doesn't he?" I just nod yes and I tangle my hands in my hair.
She cracks a smile and then cards her fingers through his white blonde hair instead which makes me smile brightly. I figured he needed some comfort after what happened to him and Mione was the closest thing to a maternal presence he has. I see Hermione’s eyes soften and she begins to run her hands through his white strands more as I help him lay be back down so he would go back to sleep.
The note makes me still with unease unsure of just what I have lost.A knock at the door brings me out of my thoughts only to hear her voice, "Draco today we are getting you supplies so hurry up." But something is wrong, that's not her voice. I open the door to see my mother standing tall and stern, it makes the uneasy feeling return twice as hard. "Hello mother how are you today? Did you sleep well?" I smile at her and go to hug her when she steps back from me looking as if I was a house elf. "How many times must I tell you not to touch me? It will wrinkle my clothes. Now go eat we need to leave."
I've run out of tears but somehow my eyes become misty as I see the sun rise above the horizon knowing that it marks the day my mother is given the kiss. At sunset tonight is when the act will be done. Everything I did, all the pain and frustration, was worthless if she's gone. So with that sun now shining I enter the manor that should have been the place I could call home. Everything here is cold. Nothing was ever inviting or happy here, only mother, that's what made me come back every holiday. What brought light to my childhood. Now after everything it went from cold to being drenched in darkness, the stench of dark magic ingrained so deep I felt it would never come out.
He gets a bruising balm and an antiseptic serum but instead of putting it on me he hands them to me.
"How about you have a go at them in the morning and I'll work my magic during breakfast? Don't worry I'll bring you breakfast so you won't be hungry."
I couldn't bare to see him fall to pieces. So despite my gathering tears I continue to try and put some sense in that genius head of his.
It only took a few minutes until we reached the castle and there was a huge crowd of people there just waiting and cheering at the sight of us. I hear a loud,
How dare you embarrass us with such a failure as to be sorted into Gryffindor?! Your mother and I always knew you were a good for nothing son but to go this far, I can't even comprehend it. We will not disown you this time, but know that you will be punished severely for this mistake. Be grateful for this second chance, you are only getting it because we need an heir and you are still young enough to instill what it means to be a Malfoy. But one more mistake and you will no longer have family, one more chance Draconis. If you fail then we will have another child and you will be nothing to us. Enjoy your time at Hogwarts and don't bother coming back for the holidays, because once it's summer your training to be a true Malfoy will start.
He knew I had seen war and death in the most cruelest of ways and I could tell that all he wanted was to hold me. His hands were desperately trying to grab ahold of my arms and pull me close, but despite how real he looked his hands just went through me. I could see the strangling desperation in his eyes and I wondered if I matched it in my own.
I get slightly concerned at how his mood shifted at the end but agree with the plan.
I was beaming happily at the nice weather and being able to talk with Ron, Mione, and Neville, while walking next to my fluffy haired crush. Even though I felt his nerves I reasoned that it was due to him not wearing his amulet and smiled calmly at him. Nothing much happened as we waited for Hagrid besides small talk between classmates. I myself am in a very serious conversation with Ron about what will be in the great hall for Lunch but its put on pause when Hagrid comes back with a beautiful looking animal. I feel amazed watching it and take a few steps forward, or I tried, when I feel a sharp pang of fear that didn't belong to me.
Harry's emerald eyes are so big and worried that I can't look him in the eye, or anyone for that matter. "No nothing like that Neville I'm just not very.... Strong I guess is the word. I'm not good during stressful situations physically or anything that's extremely emotionally draining."
"Better be Gryffindor!" And the hall was silent with the exception of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville. Everyone was still in shock by the time my tie and robe emblem showed my new house, so I made my way to sit in front of Hermione at the table.
"That's incredible I've only ever heard of that happening with extremely powerful wizards that are attuned very closely with their magic."
I gasp, before hiding my red face behind my hands while Pansy begins to imitate what I had said. And despite being extremely embarrassed I bite my lip and straighten up before saying.
Harry is friends with a Malfoy.
but I just grin and Draco smirks. Blaise narrows his eyes and observes the both of us,
I nod and grit my teeth as the burning sensation that comes with the spell sears into my tender raw skin, and I grunt in pain. I breath rapidly after its finished as I try to withstand the feeling of my skin being cauterized. I grunt out a thanks to Sev and he looks at me with pain in his eyes.
I had the door to the cage open already and Mione gushed over how pretty the red and gold roses were. Ron himself was thrilled and thanked me before placing Pettigrew inside and closing the door. I gave an innocent smile when seeing the small blue spark that was given off at the action and announced that we should get on the train, making Molly Weasley begin the goodbyes.
So that I could give him the warmth and safety he gave me.
I grin and nod my head to agree with her bright eyes, as if we are sharing a secret. She carefully takes a hold of the sugary goodness as I brandish a comb and take a glance at her silky hair. She grins with glowing eyes full of happiness and rosy cheeks as the brush glides into her locks. I smile to myself wishing to keep those smiles on their faces as much as possible.
"Congrats Mr. Malfoy you've earned your house ten points for your skill".
During classes after I was finished with helping I would scan the catalog and write items down until I had exactly one whole new wardrobe for Harry. I even picked out a few things for Neville, Ron and Mione. I was hoping they would all like the things I got them. Then I suddenly remembered Lupin!
He mouths something which I was positive was, "are you sure?"
Tears prickled my eyes and I dreaded for the rest of my bodily injuries. I squeezed Sev's hand to get rid of the guilt in his eyes and returned it with my own fiery determination in an effort to make him keep going. He steeled himself and nodded as he went to my left and right shoulders. It hurt much less since they were only whip cuts, letting a simple skin knitter do the trick. He healed the simple scratches on my collar bones and one on the right side of my jaw. But of course he paused when he came to the gash on my left rib. I knew it was bad. I could almost still feel the cursed knife that was jammed into the delicate bone structure a few hours before.
Ron stares wide eyed while Mione is quickly inspecting his hand to assure us he's actually fine. Mione sighs and hugs him which he returns with an apologetic smile and though I'm still annoyed at him I thank Merlin he's alright. Ron shakes his head and I feel the same. As he’s distracted I quickly grab the right potion because I notice its extremely small and only enough for one person. Not knowing if Draco would go right in the face of danger without me I took my chance. His eyes widen at the action and he tries to stop me from drinking it but bless Mione she was on my side and kept hugging draco just enough for me to drink the potion.
I try to imagine myself back in a game again but it's cut off too soon by an incredible chill. I immediately get up and pull out my wand even though I know it will be of no use to me right now, and quickly make my way down the stands. I almost trip a few times but I don't have the mind to slow down because I'd know this type of cold anywhere. The dementors are still on the prowl and I'm about to get caught up with one. I can only run like my life is on the line. I'm so close to the school now and I can see students walking about a ways away so I just keep pushing despite the lightheadedness taking over. I make eye contact with Blaise and from his face I can tell that the dementor is still on my trail which is not good. I know from the black taking over my vision I'm going to pass out and I manage to take just a few more steps before I'm going down.
The muffins should be a hit with the guys and the scones will go nicely with the tropical green tea Severus likes so much during our meetings. So I get to work and feel myself become lighter as the stress rolls off of me in waves. I'm just about done with the muffins, so as I'm placing them in the oven I hear a few pops behind me knowing that when I turn around I'll be facing house elves. I take a deep breath and turn. As I thought the house elves just stare at me but luckily they're just confused and not scared. So I just nervously chuckle and apologize for breaching their domain, and if they wouldn't mind if I bake and cook since it helps after my night terrors. They look a little hesitant but they agree and I just beam at them and thank them profusely, which makes them flush and very bashful as they try to deflect all of my gratitude and compliments.
I gave a ghost of a smile and held up my hand to Harry, apparently knowing what I wanted and High-fived  me with a bubbly laugh. The rest of my time was spent helping those struggling and as class ended the professor called for me to stay for a minute. The guys say that they will meet me in potions so I nod and wait until everyone leaves.
I slowly bring out my right hand out from under the sleeve and carefully look down only to see smudges of red under my normally impeccable manicured nails. I don't give an outward reaction as I swiftly place my hand into my pocket. The gryffindors are none the wiser of what just occurred. Blaise returned to some conversation that was going on with Theodore Nott who was seated beside him reminding me that even if I could fool the gryffindors, I wouldn't be able to do that with the one slytherin.
-Sirius disappears
I put the eclairs in the oven and get ready to make melted chocolate when I hear the door open and footsteps.
"Then I will, take a chance."
Apparently Draco spoke of us to Blaise and found out Draco tutored Neville in potions and spell work because he picked up right where Draco left off. It was a giant success in my opinion and we all decided we had to do this as a tradition every week. We all agreed to make the secret quarters behind Salazars painting our own little common room with a kitchen.
"I see, then I'm guessing you need more potions?"
I thank them warmly once they finish, only for Sev to tsk and shove two potions at me. I take them with a cheeky smile only for them to be taken out of my hands gently by Harry.
The whole time I was snickering and the professors were all gobsmacked at how the events unfolded. They were clearly expecting to tell Harry to hide his gift and tell him how it was his responsibility as "Harry Potter" to be what the people wanted him to be.
"tsk, it doesn't look hard at all."
"Draco your making me a little nervous over here but I swear to you that I will not tell another soul what you are about to tell me. You are the only person who cares about me and what happens to me. I won't give this up, I won't give you up."
Raising it up in the air almost daintily as he grins, his eyes looking it over. It's metal decorated in reds and gold, with a full bowl of food and a comfy place to sleep in. It looks almost luxurious, in the sense that the metal is charmed to look like a rose carved top with vines and thorns, and a solid rectangle bottom. It looked like something of the likes of an over the top bird cage in a fairy tale book.
And then the day finally arrived, the day Draco would forever stay this way if I couldn't find the answer I've been hunting for, for the past months. I hadn't slept the night before as I kept searching and even refused to let Draco wrap himself around me so I wouldn't sleep. He sighed but accepted it and placed his head in my lap as I tried to stop myself from crying in frustration. Draco was going to be gone from my life and after the clock strikes twelve I can't do anything about it.
I just smiled at her, "I might grow it out, what do you think? She nodded rapidly.
I nod and explain. "Yup! I think you need a companion and who is better than a snake! I mean, you can talk to them so-"
Ron said and Mione just rubbed his back, making him soften a little with a smile.
"Come on lets go."
"Little Draco, master wants you again! He thinks you are hiding. He-he-"
Before his lips touch mine and it's almost as if my heart was exploding from happiness.
was going to be fine we all became much more at ease and couldn't wait for him to join us later that night. Especially because of a letter that came for Draco earlier that I just knew had to be from his solicitor. Mainly because he didn't get any other letters that were without the Malfoy crest on the outside, apart from his lawyer.
We go our separate ways after I hand him the two cookbooks Mimmzy had given to me about cooking. Then I yell out to him.
Draco's dragon form isn't meant to protect him like a normal dragon, he's only as strong in dragon form as he was as a human. By the time I was on my feet again Cedric shot another arrow into Draco's side and all I could hear was his hurt whines and soft roars. I didn't waste time in snatching the next arrow and bow from cedric's hands, but he just let them go and dashed forwards yelling.
"Might want to close your mouth there Ron, you wouldn't want to catch anything."
I crack my eyes open with all my strength and say his name out loud, granting me the vision of worried emerald eyes and furrowed brows before sleeping.
There were only a few nights he didn't wake up screaming and they were when I was keeping him company. Even then, in first year after his incident with everyone finding out about him night terrors he would still wake up horribly distressed, despite me staying with him multiple times.
"Harry? What's wrong?"
But then again that's what others said about me at first. Another thing, the boy came from a time where a war was being fought and seems do be dealing with major post traumatic stress, and maybe survivors guilt. Especially if what I think is true happened in this other time line.
Ron and Neville agree easily and Mione agrees as well but with questioning eyes. I just wink at her and swiftly turn on my heel, feet hitting the floor softly but purposefully as a smirk blooms on my face. Time to investigate. I go to a hidden nook and take off my tie and school robe so it doesn't get in the way. Then take out a short black robe and once it's on place a dissillusion spell on myself, to avoid any wandering eyes.
I stand up and get closer to the nearly opaque boy, almost man, urging him to understand. I even lift my hand to reach out and touch just to see if I could. I desperately wanted him to be real......but not at the cost of an innocent unwilling student. His facial expression looks so lost it hurts but despite that he also seems to float, elegant steps coming toward me quickly in an effort to be closer.
I remember all of us in the dorm trekking down the stairs to see Mione rush up to us and explain the explosions from the night were caused by a bout of emotional magic according to the scans Dumbledoor did. I looked to the guys and we all had the same thought but never said a word to anyone, not even Mione. After that Draco spent his days working furiously on something, sometimes forgetting to eat or sleep. Somewhere deep inside me thought maybe he did it on purpose most nights so as to avoid sleeping. I felt like I was failing him when I would see dark circles under his eyes. The mature silver eyes that glistened with both knowledge and life now looked more exhausted and burdened with each passing day.
I just smirk and wink, then walk away to Hermione's dorm room. I knock and find that it's only Hermione in the room.
Hermione asks and I just tell her it's a silencing spell so that the teacher is more comfortable. Harry though is staring at Lupin and I could understand why. He wants to know this person who was a good friend of his parents. So we began to talk softly amongst each other and I brought out the snacks much to everyone's excitement. We were only halfway when the train stopped and with it so did my heart.
I'm going to help him no matter what, and this is how I spent the rest of the summer week. Surrounded by all the books I found, scrolls, Ink, and quills everywhere, with a small spot for the snake right next to me. As well as making sure Harry got food.
I saw Hermione looking upset but trying not to show it. So I put on my ice prince mask and stared at the two girls. They became so unsettled they started squirming. I made sure to make my face look as cold as possible and narrowed my eyes, walking slowly and deliberately towards them. I truly took on the Slytherin prince persona to the point you could practically see a crown perched delicately on my head. They were trembling by the time I was in front of them making me smirk.
From your friend,
"Oh god, Harry I'm sorry! I didn't know it was you! Are you alright?!"
He looks at me and shrugs, "I'm not sure but I hope I get griffyndor. Hagrid said my parents where in there though I had no idea what he was talking about at the time. Which one do you think you'll be in?" Internally I laugh at the possibility of being sorted into hufflepuff for being loyal and self sacrificing before I say, "my whole family has been in slytherin for generations but I have a feeling I don't belong there" well not anymore I think. "Maybe we can be in griffyndor together Harry ", and at that madam Malkin looks at me in shock but smiles and says "well that's it for you Mr. Malfoy you can step down now and I'll have your robes sent to you, exactly how many do you want?" I respond with ten, six black with gold stitching, three dark grey with silver stitching, and one sea foam blue robe with black stitching. All of them in the cut she thinks is most flattering. "Alright then will you be paying that now or should I just put it on your parents tab?" "On the tab please madam Malkin". I look over at Harry who is smiling but I can see the reluctance in his eyes so I ask, "is it alright if I wait for Harry to finish? I won't bother you." She smiles and says, "of course you can." So I just go and stand far enoughto not get in the way but give Harry the peace of mind that he isn't alone. Harry brings me out of my thoughts when he asks, "hey Draco do you want to get our supplies together? I already have my wand but I need everything else?" He looks at me with hopeful eyes that I can't help but smile at, "I'd love to, if that's alright with Hagrid that is." Harry nods happily and in a few minutes is done but stalls when asked how many he'd like. He looks at me for help and I nod to him, "I think he will be good with ten as well, six black with silver stitching, three bottle green with blackstitching, and one Crimson robe with gold stitching, with a cut of your choice as well. Does that sound good Harry?"
"Are you okay? You're not going back to sleep?"
“-Okay Nev hasn't actually said anything about this at all.... But they all miss you! I miss you. So please tell me what's wrong! I'll help you. I promise! So come back."
After dinner I made my way to Sev's quarters after telling the guys. As I got to his door I knocked and when Sev saw me he smiled.
He nods "Something like that. I'm not positive but the dark lord is on the move looking for something and Quirell is for some reason the only one in contact with the dark lord." I sigh.
He looks at me with those sharp eyes that would at first glance seem harsh but I could clearly see the hope and warmth brimming in the silver iris'. It left me a bit breathless being able to see a part of his humanity when trapped in the body of such a magnificent beast. I wanted to do whatever it took to see what he looked like originally.  To know if those silver eyes were his own or a part of the transformation, if the color of his pearly scales had any significance to his skin tone.........if his shyness would continue to persist. I felt my heart do a flip inside my chest and I had to clear my throat to stop daydreaming about a human looking Draco.
So Draco begins to explain.
Her brow raises as her head tilts, bright pink hair moving with her.
The glasses were being held together by tape in the middle and he looked a bit panicked that they weren't going to hold so I go ahead and get his attention. "May I ?" Signaling to his glasses and he nods his acceptance without hesitation, making me realize just how trusting and vulnerable he is this young. I take my wand out and whisper, "oculus reparo", making the tape fall off and reveal shiny new glasses. He gasps in delighted wonder and thanks me. It's so relievingto see this Harry Potter look so joyful and happy instead of the depressed and war hardened Harry that I knew. And I planned on doing everything I could to save even the tiniest bit of his youth. "Anytime Harry, is this your first time in the wizarding world?" I ask him. He responds with, "yeah it is, it's a bit overwhelming to be honest, everything is just so new and I don't know anything. Hagrid gave me my letter today and brought me here." That last bit was new to me. "Don't worry Harry that's why you have me, I'll help you. Do you know anything about hogwarts?" He shakes his head so I explain some things as madam malkins just continues her work. "Well when we get to Hogwarts we will be sorted into four different groups or houses as they call them, griffyndor is for the brave and daring, slytherin is for the cunning and ambitious, ravenclaw is for those who crave knowledge and have wit, and hufflepuffs are loyal. So which one do you think you'll be in?"
D:[ yeah, I'll tell you once we get to class. I doubt were going to learn anything substantial in history of magic today anyways.]
God Damnit he was my friend and no matter how guilty I felt about this secret fact, it was true. I could feel it in my heart. But this was just more of a reason to not let him kill an innocent. He shouldn’t have to sacrifice a person for a free life. I couldn't let him destroy himself more than he already was.
I give him a dazzling smile and some fresh bandages from my bag with a,
I give a sigh of relief. "There's going to be a war, he comes back Blaise. Voldemort comes back. Too many people die and I came back to save the ones who died and help Harry Potter defeat that psychopath once and for all."
"Oh, well yes. Last time I hid it with everything in my being. I even played seeker for Slytherin. Well, I had to drink potions before practice and every game to make sure I wouldn't faint, but I managed to hide it from everyone until the war really hit hard. You had wanted to talk to me so you went to my room at the manor but I had just been on my way back from a meeting with Voldemort. It was so stressful that I fainted right outside my door not even able to get inside my room, but you were there. That's how you found out, you were the only one to know. From then on you gave me extremely strong energy and pepper up potions. Before then I had been secretly making them myself since I started school."
"Wait....... what?!"
His breath hitches and he closes the gap between us so that were standing so close I can feel his bodies warmth on my skin. His movements are slow as if to let me back out but I stay still and keep watch of his eyes as he places his hands on either side of my jaw. He pauses when our noses are brushing against each other but I just place my hands on his hips and I hear him say,
Harrys POV:
I grin and nod. "Yes please I could do with some company. It's pretty lonely when I bake and I'll get to teach you everything! Oh this is going to be great!"
I make it to the school doors when my eyesight gets blurry again and my breathing's noticeably more ragged as it escapes my lungs. I'm covered in blood that's still leaking from my face painting the side of my neck and staining my clothes. Stumbling uneven steps I'm finally feeling myself come down from my energy high.
I make work brushing and then making a perfect high ponytail. I then split the pony tail in four sections and tie a small, elastic band about four inches from the beginning of the pony tail on each one. Then I feed through each smaller ponytail through the middle of each section and it looks like there's a twist between the top part of each section and the elastic. I do that to all the sections and then grab all of them and push them to the base of the original ponytail and tie them together. Now I take the remaining dangling hair and tie another elastic halfway Down and make an opening in the middle as I bring it up through the twisted knot design. Then with the remaining hair I make them into two twists and wrap it around the now elaborate bun. I pin everything securely and then put a decorative pin on the top right
And despite valiantly trying to avoid snickering I couldn't stop my shoulders from shaking a bit, and in result I saw Draco's furious blush and wide silver eyes filled with mortification. I could only look at him, my heart filled to the brim with happiness and affection, uncaring of anything other than him finally having freedom. He caught sight of my eyes and gave me a soft smile in return before pulling me in to a surprise kiss. I had to stop walking and remind myself not to move my hands for fear of revealing Draco's naked body, all while faintly hearing pansy's screaming.
She pauses outside a pair of grand doors to whisper.
"I know your worried but, what I'm doing and what is currently happening at hogwarts has to happen. It all works out in the end I promise. I'll see you later today in class dad...... "
"Hello there! We haven't had a visitor for ages! Oh how delightful! Now tell me what tea is your favorite hmmm? We can't fill you up with food without some tea! Oh and I must lead you to your rooms and get you changed immediately for dinner! Come along now I'm pansy Parkinson by the way."
"I was! I do understand what it feels like to do horrible things just so you could see tomorrow mornings sun.”
I laugh and say, "I bake when I need to calm down or forget. Normally it's after I wake up from....night terrors. It just helps, I've been doing this since the summer before Hogwarts and it really does help. I normally wake up screaming at four in the morning so I do this instead of staying and torturing myself thinking about the dreams, or memories."
"did you cast something on one another? It's the only thing that makes sense."
I nod expecting as much. Harry and I make it to the room and we get our robes and ties, though I make my way to Ron and shake him lightly. "Hey Ron you need to get up or you'll be late", I was only greeted with a groan so I took out a muffin and placed it near his face. He immediately picked up on the smell and woke up to see me with the muffin in hand and I put it in his hand. He grins and everyone else in the dorm starts to laugh as he struggles to take a bite and shimmy into an article of clothes at the same time.
And Draco sitting next to me on a bed, my head in his lap, as he listened to music with his eyes closed. I grinned at the sight and shifted so he would open his eyes. As soon as he saw me his eyes lit up and he hugged me while waking Ron and Mione. As soon as they both woke up they cheered loudly making Neville, who was on a bed, spring up in shock. He gasped and initiated a giant group hug which is what madam Pomfrey along with Dumbledoor and Snape came to see.
And sure enough it was there watching us.
"Yes, very much..."
I gasp harshly and cry out from both the surprise and pain.
, still managing to screw up my life.”
"Did you want follow up?"
“Draco, don’t be daft,” Harry laughed, deflating. “You’re job is important. You’re busy when you’re busy. I’m not, like, some Victorian housewife that needs entertaining. Have you been sat here all this time worrying I was mad at you? What is this, some sort of apology fancy meal?”
“Sorry. About earlier. Think I was just frustrated.”
. He played like, what, three regulation games?”
“That’s not the lead, Pans. When I woke up, you were standing in my kitchen, carrying my ex-boyfriend’s belongings and murdering my favourite plant. That was very
Truthfully, Draco knew he was a kissass. He always had been, sort of. He felt comfortable there.
“Do you even remember my surname, Harry? Doctor….”
“It’s Potter,” she added, standing up. “He’s injured. Word on the street is he’s left the team and he’s going into business at George Weasley’s shop…”
"Yes, but that is the difference between you and I. I exude hope. I live on last chances and desperate causes. You should try it."
Sure enough, she stormed away from the fountain, and Harry and Draco were left with the audience of a few scattered pigeons, and one very startled elderly couple who were holding some birdseed. Accidentally catching his eye, Draco and Harry burst into a short laugh that died before it could take hold. Harry cleared his throat.
was ludicrous.
"Fine," he said as he walked out the double doors, almost angrily stomping as he did, clearly annoyed at his concession."But I swear to all that is sacred, Potter, if this is some sort of plot, I will gladly lose my job in order to properly curse you."
There is a war and a half between them now, and Draco understands less than ever about the world.
“It’s been a month. I’m sorry I didn’t come down here sooner. The start of the year is far busier than I anticipated. I’m not a teacher by trade, as I am sure you’ve realised.”
“Oh my god, shut up. Sap,” she teased. She kissed him on the forehead and walked out the door with another box, looking more graceful in three-inch heeled boots while holding a moving box than most people did on the dance floor. He loved her with every fibre of his being.
it was him.”
“You know what, Draco. No. I don’t want to do this. I just want to… I don’t know. Talk?”
“Haha, so funny. You’re a hilarious guy, Malfoy.”
He surveyed the flat as surreptitiously as he could and found it in much the same state it had been that morning.
“Well,” Harry hesitated. “Turns out he didn’t particularly
"Alright, Potter? You said you needed to speak to me?" Kingsley asked, dragging Harry’s attention back to the room.
Draco nodded and stood up slowly, shifting Rose across his body as he handed her to Hermione.
“Yes,” Draco whined, turning his face but not lifting his head. “How the fuck does one add a ‘
Without turning or stopping, Harry said the sentence he’d been asking for weeks. “Why’d you kiss me.”
“Yeah,” Harry exhaled shortly, plunking a cup down and filling it from a carafe.

? Are you fucking
A headshake, a sadness.
“Well,” Abe said hesitantly. “That’s...that’s the thing, Draco. Marco isn’t there either.”

“Well, okay. I’ve been debating how far back I need to go for this all to be explained. I think it’s far. You remember the trials I assume?"
“You’re forgiven if that’s what you need to hear.” Abe wandered out of the back room and gave Harry a gentle tap on the shoulder. Which, for him, might as well have been a bear hug. “Come over here. I’ve got these new coated steel you’ll like.”
“Okay,” Draco replied, leaning into the touch. He reached into his trouser pocket and pulled out the box. “Molly gave this to me. I don’t feel right having it.”
Draco nodded and leaned against her for a moment. She pulled him into a tight hug.
Inexplicably, the name made his smile turn sour, sad. For the first time in his life, Harry waited patiently. It felt like there was something going unsaid, something he should wait for.
She poked him in the side and he looked up. “Ahem. I'm sure
Draco inhaled deeply. “It's not a bad thing to say you need help."
“Neville,” Harry laughed. “Mate. I grew up in a dorm with you. I know exactly how much pain this is causing you. I’m just also finding it hilarious.”
“Shut up.”
Malfoy smirked. “So the Headmistress finally got to you, too, huh?”
Bill smiled kindly. “That’s fine, Harry. Try me. If I can’t help, I can at least ask around. You’ve come all this way. School doesn’t get out until Friday, so it must be important.”
Malfoy grinned at him. "Sheer curiosity, Potter. Curiosity is a powerful thing. I had to know."
It was gorgeous.
“Well exactly. So let’s just leave it.”
. That was his issue."
“Very mature,” Draco retorted with a smirk. He yawned and closed his eyes.
"I have an idea. But, Metro, I think. From the flat. Think you can get there on your own, at least? Want to make sure we…we can test this safely."
The cramped corners made it harder for him to pretend he wasn’t following Draco and instead, he just decided not to pretend.
“What?” Malfoy teased, misreading Harry’s silence as disbelief. “Did you expect me to maintain my proud family name? Didn’t mean to disappoint.”
Draco physically could not stop himself from recoiling. The mark was faint now, barely visible, really. It was almost mistakable as a scar, most days. Deigo thought it was a burn mark from having a tattoo lasered off. But, regardless, when Potter touched the skin of that arm, he felt violently ill. A phantom burning sensation shot through the whole limb as he pulled his hand from Harry’s grasp and put it decidedly under the table.
decisions. He could work it out another time.
"Maybe," Harry shrugged in the shell of his former voice without looking up.
Harry’s head jerked up from his pile and he stared at both of them. Ron was splayed out in his seat, robes open and at ease. Draco’s legs were crossed at the ankle, casually possessing the surface of Harry’s desk like he’d always belonged there.
“You sound like Dr Stenhouse,” Draco whispered, his eyes watering from being squeezed shut. He opened them and found Harry’s palm, moving to scoop his cheek.
“Look. It’s fine. Just...maybe if you don’t hear from me in like an hour, send for an Auror?”
“Perfect,” Harry stated, tucking hair behind Draco’s ear.
For either of them.
husband,” Harry grumbled, scrubbing at his face. “Fuck.”
Ginny had the decency to blush and nodded once.
, which is fucking terrible, by the way.”
As the reached the bottom of the atrium, ready to stop by the coffee cart, Draco whirled around. He must have startled Potter because he flinched slightly and pulled his hands from his pockets. He wondered how deranged he looked right now because it certainly felt like it was
"I'll ask one final time, Mr Travers. How did you find this place?" the taller man asked icily.
He grinned and sat across from her, pouring himself a cup of tea and filling it with milk and sugar as Pansy pursed her lips at him judgmentally. “I missed you,” he laughed.
“I’m… sorry?”
“Draco?” a familiar, honey-warm voice asked, sounding shocked.
-naked.”
"Gee, thanks,” Harry grinned.
Still. Today, Harry agreed. Since Draco knew that today was more important than he could ever explain to Harry, he took it as a win and ordered a semi-expensive merlot before Harry could arrive and admonish him. Half-way through their meal, though, Draco was face-to-face with a suspicious Harry Potter. Which had never gone well for him in the past.
Harry laughed. “Pickings were slim. Shut up. I would have had food if
“Forgetting this isn’t new to you.”
They left separately this time, and in the strange silence that hung in the air after the initial crack of magic, a tiny ringing thought hit him; for the first time ever, Harry Potter had said the word
“Are you
“Draco, I’m sorry for my role in all that,” he muttered.
When Draco and Harry finally got married, it was seven years after their first wedding was to have taken place, and no one really understood why they bothered. They'd been living together and wearing rings the whole time. Still, a wedding happened and it was much bigger than originally planned.
out of me. You and your dumb hair and your fancy clothes and your ability to make women fall at your feet with that ridiculous wink of yours. Those things annoy me. To no end.”
"What?" Ron said. "Too soon?"
Bill waved a hand. “You don’t owe me an explanation, don’t worry. What can I do?”
The next day, Harry went to Montgomery and admitted that he wasn't ready to be back in the field. He took the desk job. He just wanted Draco to be okay, wanted him to be happy. He deserved to be happy, and it was not fair for Harry to take that from him.
He looks like he could murder someone but lets us in with a tired sigh and some grumbling. We all dash into the room where Draco is and we're met with a bright smile from the blonde.
"The name is Draco Malfoy, Mr. Black. And I have come up with one but I will have to consult with Harry here first. Als-"
"Oh my god Draco, he comes back? Fuck. Okay I'll do anything I can to help, how long do we have? Your 18 so what 7 years?"
"I have some news for you."
"~ hello~" I grin and nod.
It was in this moment while we were both giving our thoughts on how ice flowers could be a key ingredient for helping vampires walk in the sun, that he abruptly wrote something completely unrelated.
but just like the first time his mouth opened and closed but no sound would come out. His hand came up to his throat and tried to speak with all his will but nothing. His eyes were wide and went from madam Pomfrey to me in panic. I just held his hand, massaging circles on the back of it as madam Pomfrey debated the issue. Draco leaned into me for much needed comfort and I freely gave it, wrapping an arm around his shoulders.
His face betrays nothing but I can feel a bit of sadness from him and it makes me confused as to why, but he just goes back to listening to the others. Oh god I think I just messed up.
He intertwined our fingers and I let him. Just this once I tell myself. Just once. And so I follow his lead and I pass the day in a blur of lectures and trying to stave off the feeling of needing to scratch at my fore arm.
"You are unlike anyone I've ever known Draco. An intellectual capable of keeping up with me and understanding of things no normal child should be.Thank you."
"From what I remember you were supposed to break into Hogwarts to get to Harry but you didn't succeed the first time since the fat lady didn't let you into the common room during dinner. Harry was asleep and everyone else was eating, but as I said you didn't succeed. All I know is after that Sirius was spotted flying away from Hogwarts on the back of a thestral when Pettigrew escaped capture. I literally have no idea how Pettigrew got in the school at all or where this thestral escape plan came from but that's all I know. Also, that Harry had a black dog by the end of the year. I didn't know the dog was you though."
I wake up in cold sweat with a silent scream on my lips gasping for air, my vision still blurred with tears and green flashes. I press my palms to my eyes and count to calm down, I get in the shower and dress even though it's four in the morning. I make my way to the kitchen and I start to make scones in peaceful silence. I get lost in the process feeling completely relaxed, and smile as I place them in the oven. I think about the train ride and I'd hate for Harry to feel hungry in case the scones aren't enough. Especially if I'm going to befriend Ron then I definitely need to play to his stomach. I decided that I couldn't get in the way of Ron and Hermione's friendship especially since friends like them are rare, they wouldn't abandon him. As far as I know they've been inseparable since they united their group and I will not be the reason they drift apart. So I look in the books to find a good dish that won't be messy and easily eaten, sandwiches are the obvious choice but it's boring and I selfishly want something to occupy my thoughts from drifting back to my darkest days. So I decided to make personal sized chicken pot pies to keep me busy, but because I had so much time left I piped the elclair batter left in the fridge and shoved those into our second oven as I busied myself with the custard filling. It was during this process Ib, Mimzy, Ike, and Dobby came in to make breakfast.
Even after her marriage and adoption of Harry, Rose had kept her position and continued her work. MI-7 was ecstatic over the news. Having Rose in France as the wife of one of the most powerful Dark wizard in France was more than enough to pacify the worried Secret Services. Having Rose raise Harry Potter, the saviour of the Wizarding World, meant that they could insure that the Muggle Government could have better news and Intel on the Magicals than what pitiful and useless information or reports Fudge rarely sent. Having Rose keep her job meant that MI-7 kept their most promising agent active and didn’t have to train someone else. The best part of the arrangement was that Harry was never going to be Dumbledore’s puppet (Muggleborns might love him, but the muggles knew better) and if Lord Voldemort ever did come back, having Rose as an aunt, the boy would be safe and would be trained to fight and survive. In sixteen years, no one in the British Government ever regretted the arrangement.
“It's a sea monster!” shouted Lavender Brown as she pointe to the lake in excitement.
His uncle Alexander had started to get involved in the school when a very unaccetable candidate for the Headmistress post (Beauxbaton always had a woman at the helm of the school); a known creature and being hater! Of all things! It was rumored that her husband had secretely been financing Lord Voldemort during his reign of terror. The woman had such horrid plans for the school; starting by limiting the number of students with veela blood into the school and segregating them along with the half-bloods and the muggleborns from the ''pure'' students. Alexander Vaux De Villiers never could stand the couple in high society, but the very idea of letting such a vile woman in the school or on the Board of Governers..? Not a chance in Hell! He had backed up Madam Maxime, stating her numerous years dedicaded to helping all students no matter what; from failling grades to bullying problems, from pregnant students to abused children (from parents or teachers)... Madam Maxime was there and ready to fight for those who needed. She took care of the school for half of her predecessor's tenure. Who better than this fine woman could watch over the next generation of witches and wizards of France? Madam Maxime won unanimously and the school has never been better because of it. Yet, Harry did not feel like going to Beauxbaton; it was too genteel for his tastes. He needed a school with a good duelling and runes program.
''You will tell Vernon to accept that promotion in America. You will tell him that it will be good for his reputation and for your son if you all moved to America. You will write a letter saying that you grant ME sole custody of our nephew Harry James Potter and have one of your neighbors sign as a witness. You will move as soon as possible and you will never come back. Do not tell anyone where exactly you are going and do not give them a forwarding address. You will dissapear and never come back to England. Am I clear?'' demanded the youngest woman as she looked straight in her sister's eyes.
''I will come with you to the hospital and speak with the healers. However, it is best to bound with your chosen mate as soon as possible. It will prevent the British Wizarding Ministry from removing young Harry if they ever found out he was raised by a single female muggle. The Ministry does not approve or see in the best of lights single mothers or children out of wedlock. Furthermore, the French Ministry for Magic will not refuse service to my species, just muggles. Something one does not find in Britain.'' said Ragnok as he sat down and pulled the necessary paperwork both she and Alexander will have to fill out.
to warm their beds or that they could do whatever they wanted without any reprecussions. I have worked very hard to... show them the error of their ways. Be it with words or hexes... I wonder if they found Mr. Rougemont's left testicule, yet?”
There was a few hiccups in her perfect world. Marge Dursley, Vernon's spinter sister, and her horrid lap-dog, Ripper, who came at her home to visit and always left half-drunk. She would always be loud and quite crude. However, the woman only came one week every few years. Then, there was her freakish sister Lily that was a freak with her freak of a husband and kid. Petunia liked to pretend that her freak of a sister and her world didn't exist. The good thing was that Lily and her never spoke, see or even mention one another under any circumstances. Her last hiccup came in the form of Rose Evans, her youngest and mysterious sister.
A vicious fight erupted between the two and Molly, Ron and Hermione were forced to returned home; the rest of the Weasley clan stayed to help mend the rift between the families. It was during that time that Harry met the Weasley and couldn't help but like them. The wedding went on as planned without the dark clouds and it was truly a magical and spectacular moment.
She quickly and discreetly (not really, it was pretty obvious) passed along the information to Ron and Ginny. All three couldn't believe their eyes. Ron couldn't believe that Harry Potter would sit and be friendly with slimy snakes. Obviously, Durmstrang had a bad influence on the bloke and it was Ron Wealsey's job... NO! Ronald Weasley civic duty to make sure that Harry Potter sees the light and becomes friends with good and light people, like him.
It only got worse when it was reported that Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived and heir to three powerful and rich families, was going to attend the party... UNACOMPAGNIED. It meant that many young witches and their opportunistic families were now cursing Dumbledore to Hell and back. His aunt Rose had the article cut out and spell-o-taped in her scrapbook of “
Mrs Figgs was rightfully shocked. Petunia Dursley left for America with Harry Potter! She had to tell Dumbledoor and make sure that they could find the boy before the Death Eaters did. They had to make sure that the muggles would never again leave their home like this. How was the Order supposed to protect and train Harry to his destiny if the Dursley family kept moving from one place to another? This was awful! Just awful!
Which was why, at this very moment, Rose was planning to have everyone (Sirius, Remus, Alexander, etc.) sent to Greenlane Place, the Vaux-de-Villiers’s townhouse in the heart of London. There, everyone would be closer to everything and would be able to act quickly if things went wrong. She wanted everyone one to moved out efficiently to help Harry and no man or god was going to stop her righteous fury if her nephew had so much as a hair out of place. Her entire armoury was being ship to Greenlane Place and her superiors were awaiting her arrival.
''Worry not about the dark arts. The Vaux De Villiers have been practionners of the dark arts since before Charlemagne and despite our many ancestor's becoming Dark Lords in their own rights, not one of them ever began to learn the dark arts or had their children learn of the dark arts before their core settled. We can teach the theories behind it, however, for each spell, each ritual and curses, we must teach the consequences that touches both the world around us and ourselves. We teach a dark spell, then we teach them what it does to your adversary or victim, what you must do to have the spell or ritual work, and then what happens to you if you do theses spells and rituals. Usually with very graphic details to scare the living day light out of the little angels. It makes them think twice before using a spell they should not.'' reassured the man. ''Besides, I have no intention of teaching the boy the dark arts! He has a light core! Well... More grey than light with this soul leech... The Vaux De Villiers family has been practicing the dark arts for centuries; we have a higher immunity than most to it's addicting lure. Harry? His family is so Light oriented and for so long, that the dark arts would swallow him before he even made it half-way a fraction of what we can do. It would kill him before he even realise it. He will learn some curses and jinks, but the dark arts? Not even if I was imperiused! My vows as Monsieur Vaux De Villiers would kill me before that ever happens.''
Petunia's heart shattered at the news that her sister's death and at the thought that her nephew now being an orphan. However, all the hearbreak, all the sadness she felt and all the love she could possibly have felt for her nephew and estrange sister all vanished when she realised that her nephew was a freak just like his parents!
The second man was named Daniel Leeman, half-blood who was Bagman’s second-in-command and the unofficial Head of the Department. Much more competent and fitted for the role, he was the person you went to when you need help or if you wanted to advance in the department. Ravenclaw alumnae, Leeman refused to simply accept the word of famous, rich, or powerful people without looking into a situation. He was the reason that the Tournament had not been allowed in 1994, when Bagman had tried to present the whole thing to the Minister of Magic with barely any thoughts or explanations. Leeman had made the research and proved that, had Minister Fudge gone with Bagman’s plan, the Ministry would have been screwed.
Petunia Dursley, née Evans, was perfectly normal, living in a perfectly normal house, in a normal neighborhood with her perfectly normal husband and their perfectly normal son. Thank you very much! Petunia Dursley, née Evans, was the vice-president of her neighborhood's book club, the thrice time winner of the best garden of Little Whingning and was the street gossip queen. Her husband, Vernon Dursley, was the important Vice-president of the sale department at Grunning Drill Company and was a man who always remember to put down the toilet seat after he was done. Her son, Dudley Dursley, one year and a few months old, was a little angel who was a bit fussy about certain things, but always deserved the very best and always made her proud.
The old man tried to leave but the Hogwart champion, who had been all but forgotten by his own headmaster called out to him. Telling him that if he dared to disobey the orders of the Minister and ruin Great Britain’s reputation any further, then the Light Party was going to lose the Longbottom seat and Great Britain one of his oldest and most noble House. For Neville Franklin Longbottom will not have his House allied or associated with a man who would gladly destroy his own country. Speechless, the old man could do nothing as his own champion, his own student; his pawn passed by him and refused to look at him.
Petunia didn't waste any time to make sure her sister's advices were followed and she waited in the kitchen; it took less than 40 minutes before she heard the tale tell sound of the Evan sister's old code. Carefully, Petunia opened the front door and led eyes upon her youngest sister. Rose walked right in without a word and made her way to the kitchen. There she saw her two nephews; one in a highchair with chocolate milk, the other on the floor chewing on his blanket.
Fifth year was quite an eventful year for Draco. To begin with, his language teacher offered him an official assistant job with full pay. Which brought him many acclamations from the staff, but many dark looks and rude rumors from the other students; either Draco slept with the handsome middle-aged man to get over his break-up or he slept with the teacher to make sure that he didn't fail his classes. Either way, he was a whore and was using the poor older man. Of course, none of it was true and no one was brave enough to taunt or say such things within earshot of anyone related to the Malfoy heir; lest they find themselves at the other end of his wrath.
The resulting applaud was deafening. Durmstrang chanted his name, much to his embarrassment. Beauxbâtons applauded the young man with just as much warmth. Harry had been very popular amongst the French after the small party this summer. The Hogwarts contingent was ear shattering. They would get to see their hero perform. Finally, after all these years, they would see him and all the spells and skills he was rumored to have.
“Oh, trust me, I know! The way Dray keeps undressing you with his eyes must have been why the cup choose me instead of him. He would have been far too distracted. It wouldn’t have been fair for either of our schools.” Replied the young woman.
The best school in the world at the moment was Mahoutokoro and with Harry's soul leech, even if they did get it removed, there was no way that they would accept him as they were even more Light obsessed than Britain. The second was a tie between Ilvermony (the american school) and Castelobruxo (the south american school) and they only accepted children from their own countries or continent. Besides, since World War Two, the American-Brittish relationship was that of a cold war. Macusa did not approve of Dumbledoor's attitude or rewards at the end of the war just because he had defeated Grindelwald. The man had been begged and almost bribed countless of times to intervene or help, and he had done nothing but offer empty excuses and advises. Only to take the glory from everyone else when the Allied Forces and the American Forces had all but destroyed the Dark Lord, making the sacrifice of thousands of good wizards and witches seem completely irrelevant.
Lilianne got up and walked to her Headmistress with her head held high and a large smile on her lips. She shook her Headmistress’s hand and made her way to the small office door hidden in an alcove near the Head table. To the purebloods and wizard-raised half-bloods, this elevated her in their eyes. It was only proper to shake hands with one’s Headmaster as a sign of accepting the responsibility of representing their school in such a function. It was also a sign of gratitude to be given the trust and honor of competing in their school’s name. Should the Headmaster refuse to shake the hand offered, it would have been a large signal that said Head was against the decision and was a grave insult. Thankfully, Madame Maxime was beyond please and shook vigorously her student’s hand with a proud smile.
Nothing was going to plan and his chances of glory at defeating Lord Voldemort slipping away. He needed Harry to die against Voldemort in an epic battle to make sure that the boy became a martyr and make him, the distraught and wise old mentor who saw the boy as his own flesh and blood, a hero for ''avenging'' the death of his brave, selfless and young protogé.
Chapter 5
Rose was adament that Harry went to a muggle elementary to learn how to socialise and help learn about his muggle heritage; while Alexander though it was a terrible idea, as children were often time cruel and Harry could respond with accidental magic. Besides, unlike Britain, France offered a elementary type of school for wealthy elite families where children learned to socialise and learned about the basics such as math, reading, writing, french litterature and history. Thought not completely satisfied, Rose accepted to send Harry to
It was clear they wanted to see what sort of man was the other was. Would they be the sort of man who had such a fragile ego that they would not tolerate his partner to take the lead once in a while? Would they be the sort to put the other in their supposed place? Would they throw the other away for not being sumissive enough? Would they simply fold and accept the dominance of the other? Or, perhaps they would accept the other's independance and enjoy to follow their lead sometimes? Or perhaps they would love the other for who they are and would help raise the other up instead of trying to keep them down? Well, now was the time to see...
Of course, being raised to be a man by his aunt and uncle meant that Harry kept his mouth shut and his opinion to himself. It was not easy in the least, not with the English hounding him everywhere. After a while, Harry got fed up and simply pulled out a sob story about how hard Halloween was for him because of his parent’s deaths and that he was very emotional during this day. He also thanked the English for
was one of them! So the spell that had been held a god-send only a few decades before was now a dangerous and illegal spell. It was used ONCE as a method of defense by a scared man trying to save his family and it became a spell of war. This is what you will learn in the dark arts class.''
Edward and Iris Evans sent all their daughters to private and specialised schools; Petunia went to a private school for young women that taught an amazing science programs, Lily went to Hogwarts to learn magic and Rose to her military school. Each girls went to the best school their parents could afford. To Rose, when Petunia decided to drop her chances at Oxford to marry that walrus of a man, she had disgraced and disrespected her parents sacrifices to give them the best futures possible. They have not spoken in six months after their last fight.
Narcissa and Lucius had made it clear to their son that they cared not if he prefered men or women; there were potions for heirs if need be. It warmed the young Malfoy's heart to know that his friends would always be there for him when in need and that his parents would always love him, no matter what path he chosed. That summer would always be one of the most memorable ones in his life.
