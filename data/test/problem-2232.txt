“I— I have this note for Blaise Zabini,” he stammered, hastily handing Blaise the note before hurrying off.
“First of all, I need new dress robes,” Draco declared. “Preferably in a cool-toned colour, something like light grey or blue. Second, we need a complete wardrobe for him.” He pointed at Harry, who blushed crimson. “Dress robes, everyday wear, casual clothing for at home, clothes to sleep in—everything.”
Harry’s cry drew Severus’ attention back to the duel just in time to see Remus collapse. Before he could decide how to react, Harry had already jogged across the garden to revive him and pulled him to his feet.
Bloody Gryffindors and their hero complexes. Draco simply squeezed Harry’s hand and pulled him into the people-packed street. Harry sighed, but didn’t argue further, following Draco through the crowd. Within minutes, they were at Twilfitt and Tatting’s and Draco’s excitement rose.
Remus repeated. He got out of his chair and crouched down before Harry, grabbing his chin to force him to meet his eyes. “It is
“There’s nothing to talk about, you’re all completely crazy. There is absolutely no proof that I’m his son and the only reason you think I am is because he’s too proud to admit that he’d never stand a chance with my mother.”
Harry laughed. “I know you, Draco, and that was your worrying face. It’s going to be fine, you’ll see. They just have to see who you really are and they’ll like you in a heartbeat.”
The image of Harry on his knees in the train flashed through his mind, and he couldn’t help a moan of his own. He swallowed Harry deeper, trying not to let his teeth graze the sensitive skin.
“Look what we have here, the Chosen One and his sidekicks,” Draco drawled, twisting his mouth into a disdainful sneer.
“No! No, Narcissa, don’t. I— It’s bad enough as it is. It doesn’t have to be embarrassing on top of everything. Please just— No.”
Harry was barely two steps into the hall when his eyes found Draco, his expression brightening a little. Draco felt his lips quirk up into a smile and he quickly fought to control his features. He knew that Harry had caught it anyway, because when those green eyes left Draco’s, a tiny smile appeared on his face. Unfortunately—or maybe fortunately, Draco wasn’t quite sure—Harry sat down with his back to Draco and didn’t turn around for the remainder of breakfast.
The rest of his speech centred on the war, reminding the students that the Dark Lord was quickly gaining followers and his ranks were expanding into positions of power. He warned them to be careful, to report anything out of the ordinary to a member of the staff and to obey the rules set by the teachers, for the sake of everyone’s safety. Severus’ eyes found Harry’s again at that point and this time there was a hint of a smile on Harry’s lips. When Albus wrapped up his speech and sent the students to bed, Severus breathed a small sigh of relief.
“The rules are simple: Both of us will use any means to either disarm or stun the other. As soon as one of us succeeds, the duel is over.” Harry turned to Remus, smiling up at him from his lowered position. “Ready?”
, Severus, help me. I need to get out of this somehow. With my father out of the picture I can get away, Mother too. He’ll never find us without my father’s help, without the family traces. I don’t want this anymore, it’s pure madness! I—”
The first thing Severus became aware of as he woke up was the thrumming pain in his skull. It took considerable effort to force his eyes open. He was in his own bed. That was a good start, even though he couldn’t remember getting there. In fact, his memory of what exactly had happened was rather hazy in general.
Harry laughed and gave them a round of applause, to which they bowed dramatically. Fred opened his mouth to say more but was cut off by Molly who started to berate them for the poster in the window, and Harry quickly ducked away to avoid getting caught in the crossfire. The amount of people in the shop made it difficult to reach the shelves, but Harry managed to squeeze through after a few minutes only to notice that he’d lost Ron and Hermione in the process. For a moment he considered going back, but the crowd of people pushed him further into the store and he decided to just get back to them later.
“Can the house-elves take the basket to Gryffindor tower for me?” he asked Severus. “I’ll keep her with me for now, nobody will see her under my robes.”
Again, anger bubbled up in Remus. What the hell had changed? Why the fuck had he retreated from them so suddenly? It made no
When Severus was again absent during dinner, Harry was sure that something must be wrong. Upon his asking, Narcissa told him that the house-elves had delivered meals to Severus’ room, so Harry decided to just go knock on the man’s door after dinner. Simple.
He looked around in the room as he sat down. Severus had not brought much, the most prominent thing being a potions set sitting in the corner behind the door. When he turned back to Severus, he found the man looking at him expectantly. Right.
“I’m not sure I’ll survive without being able to touch you,” Harry murmured against Draco’s lips, his hands gliding down Draco’s torso. His hands settled on Draco’s belt and he paused. He looked up at Draco with searching eyes—hesitant. “Can I?”
Resigned, he buried his head in the pillow again, his mind caught in a loop of replaying the scene in the hallway and berating himself for it. It felt like mere minutes later when another knock sounds on his door.
Harry looked at her sharply. Severus’ own invention? Before his mind could go down the rabbit hole of what that implied, he forced himself to file that away for later. He finished healing the last of the smaller cuts on Severus’ right side, then turned to look at his father again.
“It’s about the prophecy,” he began, and could see Harry tense immediately. “Specifically, it’s about how the Dark Lord knew about the prophecy in the first place. As I’m sure Dumbledore has already told you, when Sybil Trelawney made the prophecy to him at the Hog’s Head, the first part of it was overheard by an eavesdropper, before he was caught and thrown out. That eavesdropper— It was me. I overheard the first part of the prophecy and brought it to the Dark Lord. I’m the one who told him. I’m the reason he came after you.”
“Nevertheless,” he forced himself to continue, “I do not want to put our current relationship at risk. Not only are we both responsible for Harry, but I truly do value you as a friend. If this is going to happen again, we should be clear about our intentions and boundaries.”
“I’m sorry,” he said, getting off the couch. “I didn’t mean to yell, I just couldn’t let you near that curse, what if— What if it had transferred to you? What if it had latched onto you and I couldn’t have done anything to stop it?” He looked properly miserable now. “I didn’t mean to yell, I’m so sorry.”
“No, my lord, the old man has made no progress with rallying forces to oppose you. Even with the Ministry now acknowledging your return, his efforts to gather supporters against you are futile.”
He hurried out of the bathroom and grabbed his broom, which was settled in the corner of the bedroom, holding it up next to himself. Definitely taller. He whirled around and went back into the bathroom, this time turning to a full-length mirror on the wall opposite the bathtub.
“Of course not, Draco, but that’s his own responsibility, not yours! Or perhaps it would be Severus’ responsibility, but he is hardly available right now. Either way, you are staying here.”
“Brilliant.” Remus got off his seat, turning to the door. “I’ll talk to Harry about setting up a room for you to brew in. I’m sure he won’t have any objections once I tell him it’s for the Wolfsbane potion.”
This chapter is comparably short (jeez, we’ve gone from a 2000 word average to a 5000 word average per chapter), but it covers a couple of important things:
“Unfortunately, my new residence comes at the price of having an opening into Hogwarts and an assassin for that fool Dumbledore. But perhaps you could be tasked with this. Yes, I think that’s what we shall do.”
“Watch where you’re— Warrington?” Draco blinked at his former Quidditch captain in confusion. “Didn’t you graduate last year? I thought we had a goodbye party for you with the Quidditch team, or am I going barmy now?”
He glanced at Remus, looking for support. Remus put a hand on his shoulder and gave it a light squeeze, reassuring him a little.
He extended a hand towards Draco to help him up. The Slytherin groaned, but took it and let Harry pull him off the bed. They brushed their teeth quickly and Harry went back to the bedroom so Draco could take his shower. It still made no sense to him how anyone could opt to shower in the evening instead of in the morning. If Harry didn’t get his morning shower he was useless for hours.
With one simple action, Potter had thrown all of Draco’s well-controlled, strategically placed defences overboard, opening a door inside his head to an entire world of possibilities he had forbidden himself to consider so far. Despite years of open animosity, Draco’s initial wish to befriend the formerly scrawny, then-eleven-now-fifteen year old boy had not changed one bit, he had merely accepted that it was impossible for anything positive to ever be between them. Except it apparently wasn’t. Right?
“Severus! You’re awake,” she exclaimed, ushering him to sit down before drawing her wand and checking him over. A mother through and through. “You must be starving, we’ve put some breakfast away for you because we weren’t sure when you’d wake.”
Harry didn’t know what to do with that. Would he still have loved him if he’d known he was someone else’s child? If he was
“Harry,” said Remus. His tone was gentle as if he were trying to soothe a frightened animal. “There are things you don’t know about Lily. Will you let me explain?”
“Hey,” Draco smirked. “You really take an awfully long time to get changed, Potter. Waiting for someone to come and watch?”
guess what; Dumbledore announced the DA as an official club, and he said that you’ll supervise! Did he talk to you?”
“Intuitive? What do you mean by intuitive?” Hermione prodded. Harry squirmed, trying to find the right words to explain what he meant.
Remus wasn’t sure who moved first, but within the blink of an eye they had closed the distance between them and their lips slotted together. He stifled a moan as he wrapped his arms around Severus’ waist and pulled him closer. The kiss was much gentler than what he’d imagined, though it was growing increasingly heated by the second. Severus’ lips were soft and hot and parted just enough for Remus to dip his tongue through, earning him a groan from Severus as their tongues met.
Draco scoffed, rolling his eyes, earning himself another glare from Harry. Just what was going on between those two?
“We used to call Sirius ‘Snuffles’, because of his Animagus form. You don’t happen to have one of those, do you?”
be that family. And instead of at least making sure, you just sit here, too stubborn to even bother to check whether you’re his father or not. Do you really hate him that much?” Lupin had gotten off his chair during his rant, and was leaning across the table now, his angry face only inches from Severus’.
“One moment, Albus,” Minerva cut in. “Are you suggesting that Lily Potter cheated on James? And if she really did, who
an actual Seer, as much as that surprises me,” Harry said quietly. He steeled himself, then went on to quote the prophecy:
The sound of a door opening and closing pulled Remus back into the present. Severus had returned to his room. With a sigh, Remus gathered his will and pushed himself up, readying himself for a potential refusal.
Harry was about to respond that Fleur was quite a skilled witch herself—she’d been a Triwizard Champion after all—when the real Tonks appeared at his side without warning.
Harry almost answered, holding himself back at the last second. He glanced over at Remus, who gave him the tiniest shake of his head. Classified information then, they couldn’t risk anyone overhearing that Harry knew about it. Nevertheless, he didn’t want to lie outright, so he resorted to a wordless shrug and continued down the alley. Thankfully, the others followed after barely a second and dropped the subject.
Blaise rolled his eyes again, but his lips lifted into a small smile, and he answered, “There’s so much to tell, you’ll have to be more specific.”
a way to see him without anyone getting suspicious!” Draco whined. “What am I supposed to do to see him? Sneak out after curfew, hoping I won’t get in trouble every single day? We won’t be able to be together in peace for a single minute as soon as we’re at Hogwarts.”
Remus hoped that his smile came across as reassuring, but in reality he himself was not entirely sure time would be enough for Harry. There seemed to be so much standing between them, so much history, so much mistrust and anger. But looking at Severus, Remus could see that the man really wanted to try his best. He just hoped that Harry would once more prove how kind he was and give Severus a real chance, eventually. The boy clearly had a lot of healing to do. Who could blame him?
“Sorry, Narcissa, I’m just excited. But how can we go flying? It’s not like there’s enough space in the backyard, otherwise I’d have spent much more time outside.”
Their sentiment, however, was not shared by everyone, and Severus suppressed a groan as Molly raised her voice in outrage.
“I would never!” Harry protested. “You know I would never laugh at you, I’m just curious. I always thought you hated me.”
“I agree, Harry shouldn’t know,” replied Severus. “It shouldn’t be a problem to stay discreet, should it?”
He itched to get up and do something, but most of his urges were out of the question. No murdering the Dursleys. No waking and confronting Albus. No checking on Harry, who would most likely not want to see him.
He was just about to launch into his explanation when the compartment door opened and Ginny stepped in.
“It’s not an issue if you don’t have enough cash, mother can give you one of her checks and you just write your name into it,” Draco reassured him, and Harry relaxed marginally.
“Bye Tonks,” he replied with a smile, and then Remus turned on the spot and apparated them back to Grimmauld Place.
“I know it looks like a sudden change, but they’ve been here for over a month,” said Harry. “You don’t know them like I do. Draco and I are going to face enough backlash at Hogwarts, I was hoping you wouldn’t be part of it. Just trust me for once”
“I’m sorry, Harry, but I can not explain this to you, as much as I would like to. All I can say is that I assure you that this has nothing to do with you or your role in this war, and that I promise to reveal information that pertains to you immediately from now on. In fact, I was hoping to begin teaching you myself this year.”
“Hear me out, please. While Potter resides there it can’t be used as headquarters, not until he has mastered Occlumency. The house is big enough to room four people without issue, and Narcissa would feel somewhat at home. If we make her feel welcome she might be a useful ally in this war, and the same goes for Draco. The boy is talented, and quite powerful, too.” He frowned slightly. “There is, of course, the issue of Draco and Potter being rather at odds with each other, but I believe with Narcissa there to control Draco it’s manageable. It’s the safest place for them, probably the only safe place at all.”
For the first time, Narcissa looked nervous. “I know you and my son don’t necessarily see eye to eye.”
“They suit you very well,” Draco’s mother commented approvingly. “How about you try on the next set, while Draco and I look for some more styles and colours you might appreciate?”
“Ah,” Dumbledore said, “I see how that would be tiring. Don’t despair, I am sure they will find a new subject for their attention soon enough.”
“Ah, I don’t want to jinx it by sharing that already,” Albus replied nonchalantly. It made Severus’ blood boil again. “Rest assured, though, that it is perfectly safe for Harry to accompany me, you have my word.”
“I’m not sure I can,” he admitted quietly. “I’ve never had parents, but that was because they were dead. I’m okay with that, I’m used to being an orphan because my parents just
One look into the man’s face was enough for Harry to know that he was absolutely not going to drop it. He was steeling himself to summarise the worst, when Remus saved him.
Snape beckoned him to go back into the library, apparently eager to get it over with their lesson for the day.
“I am not sneaking, chicco, it’s not my fault you have your head in the clouds,” Blaise retorted, then went on, “Yes, it is. You didn’t miss much, it was incredibly boring—Slughorn was fawning over Potter half the time.” Blaise paused, then he added, “Actually, though, you did miss something: There’s something weird about Potter. He looks completely different from what he used to, acts different, too.”
“I think he’s struggling with the idea that he could actually have a family, a real, blood-related one, not just a chosen one. He wants that more than you might think, but he’s terrified of being disappointed or worse abandoned. He doesn’t hate you, but he also doesn’t trust you yet. It will take time, Severus. It’s only been a little over a week since he learnt that he’s your son.”
“Be— Betrayed you,” she forced out, her face distorted with pain, sadness and guilt. “Told— Se— Severus.”
He simply let her pass into the house and watched her talk the portrait off the wall. He even thanked her and offered her first name basis—which she reciprocated, as if
In his shock he all but forgot his outrage at Minerva’s blatant assumption that they’d slept with each other the moment they met again, and answered before he could think twice about it, “Just once. I hadn’t seen her in years.”
“Although I am fully confident that Mr Potter is capable of leading the DA himself, for the sake of assurances adult supervision will be provided by our former Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin, who could unfortunately not join us tonight.”
Draco let out all the breath he’d been holding, burying his face in his hands. “Potter,” he accused, “that was the single most embarrassing and humiliating exchange I’ve ever had with another living being, and I’ve gone through it
“Severus,” said Narcissa, giving him a polite smile, “I owe you a great debt for this. I am eternally grateful for your help.”
He felt unease settle in his stomach like pebble stones. The Weasleys had long since taken the role of Harry’s surrogate family, he had known that already. But so far he had successfully avoided to let himself consider what would happen if they truly disapproved of him, if they tried to keep Harry from him. Would Harry let them? Would he prefer them over him? He already had a solid father-figure in Remus, plus Severus was fairly sure Harry was beginning to view Narcissa as somewhat of a mother-figure as well. With the addition of the Weasleys, Harry had plenty of family by now. What did he really need
“So,” Harry murmured, dipping his head to run his lips along Draco’s neck, “what were you so distracted by before?”
Harry frowned. Snape’s magic felt familiar, too; differently than Draco’s, but much more so than Narcissa’s. He quickly smothered the feeling. He simply hadn’t paid any attention to Narcissa, that was all.
He spent the next hour packing his trunk with Draco’s help, who had returned before him. When they were finally done, Harry looked around in the room. Only a few things were missing, given that he hadn’t brought a huge amount of personal things with him to begin with, but it still felt odd to see their bedroom so empty with all their stuff packed. One more day and they’d be going back to Hogwarts. One more day and he couldn’t share a bed with Draco anymore, one more day and he couldn’t even
Severus nodded and moved hastily off the bed. Just as he was about to apparate, Remus called out to him again, “Severus. Be safe.”
“It’s linked to another one, a counterpart so to speak,” Harry explained. “If you write in one of them and activate the Protean charm, whatever you’ve written immediately appears in the counterpart, the receiving one chimes, and the ink in the sending one changes colour.”
They fell silent then, watching as the debate about the snake’s name narrowed down to a choice between constellation names, as was traditional for the Black family, or names related to the snake’s own nature. Soon there were only two names left to choose between: Iris, because of the rainbow reflections created by the snake’s skin, or Cassiopeia. They couldn’t seem to agree on either of them though.
“I— Probably. Although there are certain things I won’t mention to them — or rather things that will mean something to you that will go straight over their heads.”
As Remus went on to reassure him that he had done what he could under the circumstances back then, Harry slowly began to feel more relaxed. Eventually, he and Draco went back upstairs to read and for Harry to spend some time with his new snake.
“That—” Severus broke off and considered for a moment. It wasn’t impossible, if Harry’s shield had been raised far further away from him than one normally would place a shield—halfway across their battleground. He must’ve put it up under the cover of the fog.
he reminded himself, as he sat down at the dining table right next to the man. Somehow, they had established permanent seats for all of them, with Harry at the head of the table, Remus and Severus to his right, Draco and Narcissa to his left. It seemed fitting, given that Harry was now literally the Lord of the House.
It was both heartbreaking and oddly soothing to leaf through letter after letter from his mother; letters in which she told Sirius about Harry, about how he was already flying on a toy broom on his first birthday or how he’d just said his first word. Then, there were letters from his— from James, talking about how he missed leaving the house, but how idyllic family life was, how Harry loved playing with the cat. James might not have been Harry’s real father, but he’d loved him.
“Yes, yes,” Severus assured him. “She’s completely unharmed. She even offered to take a new Vow, but Harry refused.”
“Draco, I—” He exhaled, the warm air making Draco shiver as it hit his skin. “I’ve obviously never done this before, you— You’ll have to talk to me. Tell me what you like.”
Wordless? Harry, that is really advanced magic! Most people cast spells like that verbally their entire life. How on earth did you manage that so quickly?”
Draco glanced at the clock. Again. Time was going in slow-motion it seemed. He felt like he was waiting for hours already, but the minutes just stretched into eternity.
Harry tried, but his body wasn’t fully obeying him yet. Vague memories of feeling like this came back to him, memories of waiting for his heart to calm down in his cupboard, of running through Little Whinging until his legs gave out, of trying to breathe quietly behind closed curtains in his Gryffindor dorm. It would pass. It would take a while but it would pass. It was better than the alternative.
“I wanted to ask you a favour,” Remus began, glad that his voice didn’t betray how nervous he was. “The full moon is coming up, and I was hoping you would brew the Wolfsbane potion for me again. If I had the potion, I could stay here during the full moon and I’d prefer not to leave Harry for two full days. Plus my recovery time would be much longer without the potion, meaning I couldn’t really be there for him for quite a bit longer after my transformation.” He shot Severus a pleading look. “I would be very grateful for your help, Severus, for Harry’s sake.”
Draco’s cheeks coloured even more and Harry wrapped a hand around the back of his neck to pull him down into another kiss. Every thought was wiped from Harry’s mind as his hands wandered all over Draco’s skin, tangled in his silvery-blond hair to pull a little before letting go again and returning to their wandering while they kept snogging each other senseless. Draco groaned against Harry’s lips as his palm passed over a pebbled nipple, and Harry swallowed the sound with a grin, bringing his hand back and teasing the spot some more, satisfied by the shiver that ran through Draco, as Draco pressed in impossibly closer.
“And most of my other cosmetics—conditioner, moisturisers, body wash, cologne—you name it. Why would I use subpar products when I can just make my own? You should try it sometime, would do your hair some good.”
, he told himself, forcing himself out of the armchair and towards his bedroom. This wretched day could not end soon enough.
“Will you tell me what this is?“ Severus asked, biting back his anger about Albus‘ involvement in Harry’s horrible childhood.
Severus almost rolled his eyes. Yes, he knew rather well how Draco felt about Potter, much more so than Draco suspected, probably more so than Draco himself. He’d never understand the boy.
“Yes, I do,” Draco countered. “You’re clearly upset and I won’t just leave you to deal with it all by yourself, so I’m staying. Do whatever you wanted to do, I’ll just be here if you need me.”
Molly Weasley covered her mouth in silent shock, her eyes comically wide as she stared at Albus who was still speaking.
The full moon. With a sigh, he glanced at the calendar again. One week to his next transformation. He had to ask Severus for the potion now if he wanted a chance at taking it on time to have full effect. Also, better now than later, because if Severus refused he’d have to find a place to go for that night. The idea of leaving Harry alone, even if just for a night and a day, unsettled Remus. While the boy could undoubtedly take care of himself, Remus was loath of potentially not being there should Harry need him. Not that Harry had taken all that many steps towards him since the revelation of his parentage. He did, however, allow Remus to talk to him.
As always I hope you enjoyed it! God I wish Ao3 had a messaging function, cause your comments always make me so happy, I wanna continue those conversations :D
“You’re not going to use Legilimency on me and have me try to block you?” Harry blurted out, taken aback by the apparent end of their lesson. Snape gave him a cold glare.
“Anyway, Ogden and Marvolo got into a discussion — or a fight, hard to tell — until some Muggles on horseback passed by outside. Merope was rather affected; Morfin teased her in Parseltongue that she liked looking at that Muggle. Marvolo wasn’t pleased. He attacked her and when Ogden intervened, Morfin attacked Ogden. Ogden ran and the memory ended.”
of the stairs to their floor that would warn him if someone passed it. Remus had never been more glad about Severus’ tendency for mild paranoia.
Once the first years were sorted, Albus commenced the feast and everyone dug in. Severus kept his eyes on the Slytherin table the entire time, looking for any kind of sign, anything irregular. He knew full well that whoever the Dark Lord had entrusted with the mission to kill Albus was probably more than skilled at concealing their intentions. Sometimes it really was a bother that pure-bloods went through all this social grooming, perfecting their masks and personas.
“I can tell him, if that’s alright with you, cub. You don’t have to explain it all again,” he said, putting a hand on Harry’s shoulder.
Harry got to his feet, pulling Neville along. At the last second, he remembered to grab his bag in which he kept his Invisibility Cloak and the charmed journal to communicate with Draco. Perhaps he could get away with sneaking off to meet him. He grinned as they left their compartment, and suddenly he didn’t mind Slughorn’s strange desire to collect influential students all that much anymore.
to believe that maybe they could overcome the past five years, but he didn’t want to feel manipulated into it and bloody everything felt like a manipulation when it came from Snape.
Their chests were pressed together as they kissed, and suddenly Harry was incredibly bothered by the silk top that Draco was wearing. He wanted to, no,
early, and eat the dinner Narcissa had undoubtedly saved for him under a stasis charm. Or maybe he’d just have pre-dawn breakfast, steal some snacks from the pantry and hole up in his room. It sounded like a decent plan.
“Nothing happened between us,” Harry answered irritably, “we’re still together. He didn’t come with us because nobody can know that we are.”
And then Draco’s part got longer (and smuttier) than expected, but if I had shifted that to the next chapter it would’ve been too short and I didn’t want to artificially stretch it either. I guess we're just at 6-10k chapters now, oh well.
Waving off Vince and Greg who had automatically begun to rise in order to join him, he grabbed his bag that held the notebook and left, forcing himself to walk normally, rather than hurrying down the corridor. As soon as he was far enough from his friends to be sure they wouldn’t see him, he hastily pulled the notebook out of his bag. It was warm to the touch, confirming that he had not imagined the chime. He really had to admire Harry’s casting there, the spell-work was immaculate.
Harry glanced down the hallway. Two corridors further and one small staircase up and he’d reach the Slytherin common room, and from there it was just one more turn to Severus’ office—and his quarters. He turned back and his breath caught when he spotted a head of blond hair. Draco’s silver eyes were looking right at him and Harry had to fight the automatic smile that wanted to creep onto his lips.
Burgock’s eyes widened slightly, but thankfully he didn’t say anything. A faint glow rippled from his wrinkled hand onto Harry, engulfing him for a moment, before dissipating again. Draco watched curiously, he’d never seen the goblins do magic before. When the spell was done, Burgock paused, furrowing his brows.
Draco frowned at the thought of his boyfriend being swarmed by hordes of girls—and boys, if Blaise’s comments were any indication. Why exactly had he decided to date Harry bloody Potter again?
Draco felt like lightning was coursing through his veins, every single touch amplified. For what felt like a blissful eternity, there was nothing else but Potter’s hands on his waist, his neck, his jaw, in his hair, always pulling him closer, and Potter’s lips on his, Potter’s tongue dancing with his, Potter’s teeth nibbling on his lower lip.
Harry loved those evenings. When they all sat there—talking sometimes quietly, sometimes animatedly about Quidditch, about how Draco had always refused to get dressed after his bath as a toddler, or how Severus had brought home the wrong child from the playground instead of two-year-old Draco once because all the children there had sported the same blond hair—Harry felt as if someone had wrapped him in warm cotton, soft and soothing. They felt the most like a family in those moments and he cherished that feeling above all else.
Hermione joined them again after lunch and relented to help Ron with an exasperated sigh that Harry related to much harder than he’d ever thought possible. Potions class couldn’t come around fast enough in Harry’s opinion—and wasn’t that an incredibly strange thought to have.
Snape narrowed his eyes at him. “That, Mr Potter, is the objective of today’s lesson as a matter of fact,” he replied with a slight sneer on his face.
“Yes, I suppose that could be arranged,” he eventually answered. “Although you would need some sort of adult supervision, unless you would only want to teach younger years than your own. Have your O.W.L. results arrived yet?”
Harry furrowed his brows, then startled when a boy’s head popped up from beneath the seats, facing away from Harry as he said, “What?”
Harry nodded and moved away to strip off his shirt. Draco kept talking about the salve as he applied it—how it worked, where he’d found it, how long it took to brew—and Harry was grateful for it. He would’ve been much more uncomfortable if they’d sat in silence. Draco then moved to the burn-scars on his arms, but when he reached for the two large scars on Harry’s right forearm, Harry stopped him.
. With only half a mind, he quickly stripped down to his pants, threw on a shirt he usually slept in and crawled under the covers, falling asleep almost immediately.
“I’ll tell the Weasleys and Hermione,” he insisted, unwilling to dwell on the confusing feelings rising in him.
Lupin pinned him with a fierce look, and Severus was suddenly reminded that this man turned into a rather murderous wolf once a month.
His brooding was interrupted by Charlie Weasley, who wanted to know everything Severus could tell him about prism vipers, and for the remainder of their dinner Severus was too preoccupied to worry more about his place in Harry’s life. Finally, the elves cleared the table and Narcissa announced that they would be returning to the drawing room now.
Minerva rolled her eyes and set down her glass. “Don’t be stubborn, Severus,” she admonished. “Just answer the question and I’ll tell you all my theories.”
“So, are you happy with your grades overall?” asked Remus, steering the conversation away from Harry and Draco’s old rivalry tendencies.
Severus nodded and watched impatiently as Albus left. As soon as the door fell shut he let out an exasperated sigh.
he reminded himself, narrowly avoiding to rip the door open, send a hex and bang it shut again. He took a deep breath, and instead walked over slowly, lifting the locking charm with a wordless flick of his wand. He didn’t open the door yet.
And he was gone in a heartbeat. For a moment Harry just stared at the door he’d left open behind him, trying to comprehend the situation. Then the same diffuse pain as the day before came rushing back into him, only ten times worse. He couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think.
“Oh, you’re looking for Harry? Whatever for?” she asked innocently, having schooled her face into a neutral expression.
“Minerva, what brings you here?” he asked, hoping that his Slytherins hadn’t caused any trouble for him to deal with.
“Well, I’m not sure if you want to hear it,” Narcissa began, hesitant, as if waiting for Harry to change his mind. When he said nothing, she continued with a sigh, “You do rather resemble someone I know. Someone who used to be very close to Lily Evans.”
“Well, there’s more than one facet to this. The first one has very little to do with any particular student personally, but is a question of reputation. I am well-known to favour pure-blooded Slytherins, while bullying half-bloods and muggle-borns from other houses. This reputation was deliberately built for over a decade, so that when the Dark Lord returned, as Albus always insisted he would, my loyalty to his ideals would not be questioned. It gives me no pleasure to snub talented students, and I’ve always made sure that end-term and end-of-year exams were graded fairly. The second is more personal. I admit that I’ve held biases against various students in your class in particular, that were founded upon personal grudges. While Mr Longbottom, for example, has certainly earned some of my disapproval through his subpar performance in my classroom, the reason why I was especially harsh with him is that the prophecy could’ve applied to him as well. Had the Dark Lord chosen Longbottom instead of you, Lily would’ve lived, and for that I resented him. That he was alive when she wasn’t.”
“No teeth,” he managed, barely able to breathe. It wasn’t a particularly eloquent instruction, especially on the
Severus gave a sharp laugh. “That was my response as well; unfortunately, he was very much serious. Ask him for his reasons yourself. Of course this, just like my relationship with Harry, has to stay entirely secret. Not even the rest of the Order is supposed to know, apparently. That goes for both of those things.”
It was getting harder and harder to stay pleasant around the man the more he learned about him and his decisions. The memory of Harry’s story flared in Severus’ mind and he had to take a few deep breaths to calm himself. It wouldn’t do any good to fly off the handle.
“Actually,” Remus chimed in, “I had an idea. If I recall correctly, both of you play Quidditch. I thought you might want to go flying?”
“No,” Remus insisted. “Now go pack your books and robes, I don’t want you having to pack in a hurry tomorrow.”
His mother had put her mind to cleaning up the house after wringing a hesitant permission out of Potter during dinner one night. She kept herself busy with clearing out the dining room, which left Draco to his own devices for the most part.
Draco rolled his eyes, but Harry could see a smile tugging on his lips. Slinging an arm around Draco’s waist, Harry pulled the Slytherin towards himself and planted a sloppy kiss on his lips.
Simple enough, Harry would think of something—he had plenty of experience with getting into trouble after all. He had just stowed the scroll away again after sending the message, when another knock came from the door.
actually who he really was? What if that was just Harry’s influence and he’d revert into the cold Malfoy heir his father had crafted as soon as he was on his own again? He didn’t
“Not everyone is like you, Harry,” Draco said, shaking his head. “Not everyone is as forgiving as a fucking saint. I called Granger slurs for years, I told her that I hoped she’d die!”
Severus opened his mouth, but his words were too quiet to understand. Harry leaned closer, barely catching the whispered incantation.
She laughed. “I do wonder what he’ll write about now that he doesn’t have Harry to complain about anymore.”
Eventually, Hermione cleared her throat. “You’re right,” she said in a small voice. “We shouldn’t talk badly about— about your family.”
For a while, these individual conversations continued. At some point, Fleur left her seat next to Bill and shooed Mr Weasley out of his, as the discussion about the wedding cake got more heated. To Draco’s surprise, Mr Weasley did not take Fleur’s vacated spot, but instead walked right up to the empty armchair next to Draco’s mother’s seat and struck up a quiet conversation with her. Across the room, Mrs Weasley lifted an eyebrow at her husband, but otherwise nobody reacted. Draco tried to pick up enough of his mother’s conversation to understand what they were talking about, but it proved an impossible endeavour while simultaneously keeping up with the twins. He was so preoccupied, he barely registered Granger calling Harry’s name before Harry was already getting up, brushing Draco’s shoulder for the briefest moment as he went to take Fleur’s empty seat.
“You already said that and I told you that he intends to apologise to all of you. He already apologised to Hermione and she accepted it,” Harry argued back. “If she can give him a chance, you should too.”
“Severus, Harry has woken up a few hours ago. I’ve already warned him that he’ll have to continue his Occlumency training and we’re expecting you whenever you’re free to start the first lesson. There’s enough room for you at Grimmauld Place if needed, you are welcome here.”
All your comments make me so happy <3 way to keep me motivated to write *fast*! Nevertheless, a little warning: Exams are around the corner so my posting might slow down dramatically for a while - but don't worry, I'll still try to write as much as is reasonable besides studying.
“Harry looks…well,” Molly admitted somewhat grudgingly. “Better than he usually does, at least, but is he eating enough? He forgets whole meals sometimes unless I remind him.”
Protean charm is way beyond that, especially with all those modifications you claim to have added—the ink changing colour, the chiming—hell, even the privacy charm on this is N.E.W.T. level!”
As they settled around the kitchen table, Harry watched the Malfoys’ faces carefully. While Narcissa seemed mostly apologetic, with barely a hint of curiosity in her eyes, Malfoy—he should probably start calling him Draco, Harry realised—sported a look of stubborn righteousness.
Before he could talk himself out of it, Harry stepped forward and quickly wrapped his arms around Severus, letting go again immediately, then turned around and left the library, along with a shell-shocked Severus, behind.
, yanking Remus’ head back and baring his neck, which he promptly latched on to. Heat shot through Remus’ body and he allowed his hands to drop from Severus’ waist to his arse, pressing their crotches together. Severus moaned into his neck before pulling away with a gasp. Black eyes found his and Remus’ heart hitched.
Striding past him towards the sitting area, Harry once again noticed that he was now the same height as the man who had once practically towered over him, if not even a little taller. It still felt odd. He gestured for Severus to sit, taking his by now favourite armchair for himself. Severus inclined his head and sat, arranging his robes meticulously, which gave Harry time to calm his flaring irritation.
Severus’ frown deepened as he kept turning the pages, as if he was looking for something. Harry could see the exact moment when he found whatever it was, because his expression hardened and his jaw clenched.
How did Severus feel about their conversation, though? Over the past weeks, Remus had grown rather fond of the man. Their daily conversations ranged from incredibly short to several hours long, and they weren’t
Draco’s stomach fluttered as he thought about the present hidden in the bookshelf. He had almost lost his mind over what to give Harry for his birthday until he finally bit the bullet and asked Remus for help. He’d come to appreciate the man now that he knew him better. Unfortunately, Remus hadn’t been able to tell him anything that Draco hadn’t already considered: something to do with healing, defence magic, Quidditch, or something personal. In the end, Draco had decided to just do both—one regular gift, for when everyone was visiting, and one personal gift, just between them. Said personal gift now sat between two thick books, covered by a concealment charm and waiting to be summoned as soon as that damned clock finally reached midnight.
He cast a Tempus to check the time and sucked in a sharp breath, scrambling to his feet. It was almost seven! Hastily, he threw the Potions book and his journal back into his bag, the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauders Map already packed, and snatched his cloak from where it was slung over the back of his chair. He gave Sirona an apologetic pat on the head for not taking her with him and rushed out of his dorm.
It’s not just that he knows Draco is baring almost all in a popular wizarding magazine. It’s not just that all of their friends have a copy of said magazine. And it’s not just that it’s the only thing they want to talk about on a Friday night in the pub.
“There you are!” Ron says as he gets closer to them. “You know, the sooner we get in, the sooner we can leave.”
“It’s in my pocket. On the floor,” Harry replies. He’s also tired. Draco groans but gets up to grab one of their wands. He waves it, muttering a spell, and cleans them both off, before getting back into bed. Harry holds an arm out, and Draco curls into him. Harry sighs, contentedly, and feels Draco go heavy against him.
His life is moderately less ruined by Draco when he knocks on Harry’s door the next day. It’s Harry’s day off, and he was going to spend it cleaning his flat, but he’d much rather be spending time doing literally anything else.
No. Oh no. Harry shuffles on the spot, trying to will away the growing erection. Draco smiles at him, and Harry can just imagine it. In a minute he’ll wink, and Harry is going to come in his pants and then he’ll have to move to a different country.
He gets to the visitor entrance to the Ministry and slips on his robes, leaving them hanging open at the front. He can’t be bothered to do them up. He never did at school, why would he now? He steps into the phone booth, dials the number, and slowly descends. His stomach twists uncomfortably. He hates being so close to so many people, and he hates giving speeches. He’d much rather just send the money and spend an evening in the pub.
Harry’s hand speeds up. He’s so close. There’s a rushing in his ears, a pounding in his head as his orgasm builds.
He flips the page open, ignoring the pictures and starts reading. It’s a very standard interview. They talk about Draco’s mum, his modelling career, his charity. Harry knows it all, has spoken to Draco at length about it. Has been there to see most of it. He has no idea what Ron could have been talking about.
He collapses against Draco, his hand sticky and bent in an awkward position, Draco’s hair tickling his nose. Draco gives him a shove and he slips from Draco with a wince and flops onto the bed. He’s exhausted, his body sore and tight.
Harry has spent all day thinking about Draco, and it’s starting to cause problems. In his pants. Serious problems.
They walk in silence in the direction of the park, along a route they take often. Harry enjoys these moments, walking in gentle silence with someone he feels he can be completely himself with. Sometimes they walk for hours in silence. Sometimes they talk about nothing. Sometimes Draco starts a serious conversation, like he truly is interested in Harry’s opinion.
“I think you should have shown us more,” Seamus shouts, and Dean rolls his eyes, slinging an arm around his boyfriend’s shoulders.
“You’re not fine,” Draco says, his voice low and deep. His eyes are so grey, looking deep into Harry like he is reading his soul, and something starts to stir.
“And you’ve no desire to read the interview?” She looks like a more terrifying McGonagall for a moment, and Harry wonders if he could get his dinner as a takeaway.
anything else. He tries to think about Hermione, or homework, or training regimes, and instead he thinks about Draco laughing with him as they walk, Draco standing next to him, solid and supportive, Draco’s hand on his back. His cock throbs.
“Hermione, can I have my hand back?” Harry asks. Hermione’s eyebrows shoot up, like she’d forgotten she was holding his hand, and drops it. They sit at the table, and the waiter drops their menus in front of them and quickly retreats. Harry wishes he could follow him.
“I know. But Andy called, and I didn’t want you to have to wait here on your own.” Draco glances at him, genuine concern in his eyes, and Harry wants to collapse into him, wants to let Draco take over. Wants to find support in those arms and eyes. Draco looks back to Teddy and smiles. “How you doing, terror?”
Harry nods, taking the magazine and putting it next to him. The rest of the meal passes in happy companionship. Harry doesn’t even think
It’s Dean’s art show, and everyone is going to support him, unless they want a beating from Seamus. Harry would have gone without the threat of a beating, but he appreciates Seamus being overprotective of his boyfriend. He’d like to be protective of someone, someday. As long as that someone is Draco.
Even if he did talk to Draco, what would he say? Draco should be with someone classy and grownup, not the overgrown child that is Harry. He looks at Ron, ready to say this, and stops. Ron is staring at him, unblinking, clearly working something out.
He’s talking about Hermione. Harry can follow that much. But who the fuck is he supposed to be in love with? He hasn’t been in love with anyone since… well, he’s not sure if he ever has, if he’s being honest with himself. He’d know if he were in love, and he isn’t. Definitely not.
“What are you doing?” Ron asks as he walks into the flat. Harry shouldn’t have given him the spare key. Ron looks around the room, letting out a slow, long whistle. “Bloody hell, mate. You’re not handling this well.”
“Harry. You ran.” His voice is low, gravelly, sending shivers down Harry’s spine. Harry’s hand tightens on the magazine, and Draco gets closer, crowding Harry against the wall. Harry can feel his pulse in his ears, his cock straining against his jeans, his breath hard.
“This isn’t fair, Harry! You can’t tell Ron something and expect him not to tell me; I’m his girlfriend! And I’m your best friend!” She sounds upset, and the guilt curls in Harry’s stomach, which he pushes to the side. He should have told her, probably when he told Ron, but he couldn’t. Sometimes Ron is just easier to talk to. And it’s up to him who he tells about his ridiculous romantic feelings.
He thinks a bit more about how he’s a disgusting human being as he walks towards the Ministry. They’re having a fundraiser, and he, Ron, and Hermione are expected to give a speech as ‘war heroes’. He is not looking forward to it. Hermione asked him if he wanted to get ready at hers, but he can’t look people in the face knowing that during his calm-down wank that morning images of Draco bent over in front of him, rounded arse smooth and pale, popped into his mind and led to the hardest orgasm he’d ever had.
“Harry, it’s nearly time,” Hermione says, bursting whatever bubble he’d been in. He coughs, and Draco’s hand comes to rest on his back, hot through the robes. Harry looks at him, wanting to say something, and wanting to run very, very far away.
“He is,” Draco agrees. He steps forward with his wand, tapping next to the charcoal sketch. A scroll appears next to it, the script reading ‘Sold’. Harry feels dizzy. Draco has bought the drawing of them, of Draco looking at Harry like
He realises what it is a moment later, when he gets close enough to see that she has a magazine in her hand.
“Yeah. I hadn’t before. I… I thought I should.” Harry’s voice is breathy and Draco moves closer. Harry’s erection is pressing against Draco’s hip. He must be able to feel it.
It takes Harry a couple of reads to really understand. Draco loves someone. Someone who pulled in from the fire. It could be a metaphor. He could mean someone who helped Draco when he was first struggling after the war. But Harry knows, in his bones, that it isn’t metaphorical. If there had been someone else, Harry would have known. There isn’t anyone else. It’s him.
Draco must have known what he was doing when he said that. He must have known that Hermione or Ron, or even Harry would read it and know what it meant. That Draco loves him. That Harry saved him, and he saved Harry, and their lives that have been so intertwined for years may join together. The knowledge takes Harry’s breath away and he stares at the words as they swim in front of him. He feels light.
Draco is standing in his doorway, eyes bright, concern lining his forehead. He leans against the frame with both hands, his body taking up the space.
Harry had been teaching Teddy to fly, using a training broom, and then suddenly Teddy was on the ground and Harry felt sick. Teddy’s usually turquoise hair is a muddy brown, a sure sign he’s in pain. How did he fall off the broom? Harry is the worst godfather ever.
Harry walks into his flat, heading straight for his bedroom. He opens the magazine that’s lying conspicuously next to his bed. Read the interview. That’s what Ron had told him to do. He’s not read the interview before, just wanked over the images of Draco naked.
It’s a sunny day, warm and filled with summer lethargy, and Harry can’t think of anything he’d rather be doing. He nods, slipping into his Converse and grabbing his keys. Draco waits for him patiently, as he always does, arms behind his back. He looks good, Harry knows. His hair flops into one eye, short at the sides and long on top, emphasising his long neck. His clothes are cut specifically for him, and they fit tight to his body. He’s stunning.
He’s absolutely not going to do it again. It was reprehensible that he did it before, and it’s clearly going to cause a problem! Harry closes his eyes, willing himself to go to sleep and stubbornly ignoring his rapidly swelling cock. He is not going to wank over Draco Malfoy. Not again.
It’s never made Harry feel left out before, but after three weeks of fantasising about a man he already had a huge crush on, it stings a little to see them.
do that again. The fact that he did it once is awful. He takes his wand from where it fell onto the floor during his… a minute ago, and Scourgifies the floor, cleaning up the evidence of his terrible idea.
Training had been hard, especially as everyone had been talking about the damn magazine. It seemed that the positive reviews about the interview and photo shoot had prompted their manager to contemplate getting a few of their star players to do a similar thing.
“Ignore him; we can’t leave early.” Hermione rolls her eyes and starts to straighten Harry up, making his tie neater, and pushing his hair back in a vague attempt to make it behave. She never used to care about the way he looked before, so he scowls at her.
“Cast an Expelliarmus and hope he goes away?” Ron jokes, clearly not in the mood to help Harry at all.
“Why don’t you want to look at the pictures?” she asks. “I know that you’re going to say it’s just that you
“Hermione, he looks fine. Let’s go,” Ron takes her hand and drags her away. She looks at him, and he shakes his head. A little conversation that Harry isn’t privy to.
“Have you seen it?” Ron asks Harry as they stand at the bar waiting for their drinks. Hannah is moving with a practised fluidity behind the bar. Harry watches her pouring their pints and resolutely ignores Ron. Ron knows he hasn’t seen it, and Harry is
“It’s not your fault. It could have happened to anyone.” Draco’s voice goes to Harry’s cock via his heart. He wants to rearrange himself, but he also doesn’t want to call attention to the semi.
“I think you’ve been in love with him for a while, mate.” Ron’s lips curve into a wry smile and Harry leans forward, needing some blood in his brain. He has no idea what to do. He’s shit at this love stuff. Ron is much better; he has Hermione and he hasn’t fucked up his relationship with her. Harry’s in love with one of his friends, and he has absolutely no clue what to do next. He doesn’t even know if Draco likes him back!
“There’s nothing to explain. I haven’t bought the magazine, so I haven’t seen the pictures. It’s as simple as that.” Harry hopes he sounds nonchalant, but he suspects he doesn’t from the way Hermione scowls at him.
He palms his cock through his pants, shivering at the sensation. Yes, that’s it. A nice rounded arse, a nice slippery hole. With no face. Nope. No face at all. He pulls his cock free and starts to tug in long slow movements, letting himself feel it in his toes. He closes his eyes tight, trying to focus on his hand, his cock, the pleasure spasming through him as he rubs.
, crush on Draco. Who wouldn’t? He’s witty and smart and dedicated. Those are very sexy qualities in a person, and it’s a good thing that Harry hasn’t thought about what Draco would look like naked, or how hot he is or else his crush might have developed into something a lot more, and that would be bad for everyone.
The problem with thinking about not wanking over Draco is that it very unhelpfully supplies his mind with the very images he doesn’t want to be wanking over, and his cock can’t help but respond. It apparently thinks that wanking over Draco is a fantastic idea. But Harry’s cock is not in charge of him, so he ignores his cock, his arms crossed over his chest and his eyes clenched shut.
Finally, Hermione breaks. “Ron told me you had a reason for not wanting to look at it, but he wouldn’t tell me what,” she grumbles. Ah. Harry shifts in his seat.
He has, instead of the parties, not cooked for himself in a week or bothered to clean up the takeaway containers. He’s been watching repeats of old TV programmes, when he’s not at training, and he can’t remember the last time he cleaned the flat or his training leathers. They’re sitting at the end of the sofa in the open kit bag emitting an interesting smell that Harry hopes he’s usually flying too high for anyone else to notice.
supporting Draco. I can support him without looking at him naked,” Harry hisses, trying to regain his balance as they land. Hermione raises an eyebrow at him and stalks towards the restaurant. The waiter looks startled. Harry knows how he feels.
Draco looks stunning. Harry knows Draco is stunning, because he always is. Because no matter what he wears, in this case a sharply cut black suit, it looks like it was made just to flatter him. Because there’s something in his eyes that glows when he looks at Harry. Once upon a time Harry used to ignore how stunning he was because it was hard enough thinking he was amazing without thinking he was hot and amazing. But now Draco’s beauty hits Harry and he can’t breathe.
He turns back to the bar as Hannah puts their pints down and takes their coins. “I’m not going to look at it,” he grumbles.
“I’m sorry,” he murmurs. Draco is so close to him that Harry can see the tiny flecks of blue in his grey eyes. Can smell the tang of champagne on his breath. Can feel Draco thighs, firm against his.
annoyed. Ron carries on, clearly pretending that Harry is involving himself in the conversation. “Ginny says Blaise has a copy in their bedroom.”
Harry shakes his head. Ron doesn’t understand. He needs Ron to understand. “No, I’ve been wanking over those pictures of him.”
The mood shifts as they wander into the examination room and stand to the side as the Healer talks to Teddy, feeling his arm, sending diagnostic spells towards him. He looks so small, and so hurt, and Harry wants to cry. He did this. He hurt his baby. He feels cold, shivery. Draco is standing so close, and Harry can only focus on Teddy, as he should.
“Are you going to buy it?” Draco asks. His voice goes through Harry, and the erection that Harry was expecting starts to grow. Harry groans. He can’t have a hard on, and be in love,
Harry’s cock twitches. He does. He wants to fuck Draco more than he’s ever wanted anything. Draco grins, winking once, and Harry growls, grabbing at Draco, lips crashing against his, hands in Draco’s hair, on his back, cupping his arse. Draco wraps one long leg around Harry’s hips, grinding his cock against Harry’s.
His cock is definitely interested, and definitely hard, by the time he gets home. He drops his kit bag by the front door and goes straight to the kitchen. His brain tries to remind him that this is a terrible idea, that he doesn’t need another reason to obsess about Draco, that wanking over your friend is a horrible,
“Clearly they’ll have Potter,” Grace Barker, their beater, a prodigy just out of Hogwarts, had said to a room full of laughter. Harry had had a sinking feeling that he would definitely be involved.
It’s getting ridiculous. Harry tightens his legs around his broom and hopes that no one will notice that he looks uncomfortable. His cock swells in his Quidditch leathers. He is at
Ron finds him hiding in his flat. Not hiding. That’s the wrong word. Camped out. He’s camped out in his flat like a hermit. It’s the only option he has, because he can’t see Draco, and apparently the fucking man is everywhere. He plans on going full Gatsby, except without the lavish parties.
He walks into the gallery, taking in his surroundings. Portraits hang around the room, thick brush strokes of oils and detailed watercolours. Pastels and sketches and even a portrait of Seamus asleep done in embroidery. Dean is really very talented, and Harry lets himself marvel at it for a moment. The room is lit with soft candle light, and there are trays of champagne floating around. A Muggle band that Harry vaguely recognises is playing over the speakers. It all feels like a wonderful blend of magic and Muggle and Harry is overwhelmed by it.
to think of Draco in that way, because he already spends too much time thinking about Draco in other ways. Like worrying about whether he’s sleeping enough, or caring about how awkward he feels around their friends, or wondering what Draco’s opinion on Harry’s new broom is. He doesn’t need to think about Draco naked.
Harry is getting confused with the circle of questions, but Draco is clearly not in the mood to answer any of them. Harry moves closer to him so that the backs of their hands brush together. His heart beats hard in his chest, and his breath is short. He loves these moments, when he’s so close to Draco it feels like they could be on the edge of doing something amazing.
“Can you see the others?” Hermione asks, too short to see over the crowd. Ron looks around before Harry can pretend that they aren’t there. It’s going to be awkward enough seeing Draco after wanking over him for a week, let alone having to make polite conversation before giving a speech. He’s nervous enough as it is.
? No! Nevermind. I won’t ask any more questions. Just…” She stops and reaches next to her where she’s put the magazine to the side. Harry tries to ignore the way his heart jumps at the thought of what’s in those pages. “I think you should have this.”
“Why did you take them?” Harry asks when they’ve walked past a group of elderly people moving slowly in unison. He doesn’t know why he needs to know. Draco does a lot of things as a model. He once did a photoshoot where he had to dive off a bridge and just trust that someone was going to cast a Levicorpus in time to stop him from smashing into the ground. Draco’s hand brushes against his.
He comes over his kitchen floor in a rush, his body shaking and his eyes stuck on Draco’s. He gasps for breath and leans against his table, his cock going limp in his hand. There’s spunk on his floor, and the silence of the flat sends shivers down Harry’s spine. The magazine lies open in front of him. Draco is still laughing.
Ron chuckles. “So, you haven’t seen it?” Harry scowls at him, not deigning to answer such a ridiculous question. Ron snorts. “Oh, you’re in for a treat.”
He shuts the door, locking it, and they walk down the street together, their feet tapping on the ground in unison. Draco is the same height as Harry, lean whereas Harry is lanky, and it’s pleasing that their steps are so similar. Harry doesn’t have to worry with Draco. The stark difference from when they were children doesn’t escape Harry’s notice.
“It’ll be okay, mate,” Ron says, following close. Harry nods. Ron has been gently supportive, but also made sure that Harry showered and threw out all the takeaway containers and sent his training leathers for an elf clean. It’s like having Molly there, except that Ron is very willing to hit him if he tries to slip back into his recluse ways.
“You’re a wonderful godfather. It was an accident,” Draco whispers back, his mouth close to Harry’s ear. Harry nods, leaning into Draco and letting himself relax in the sureness of Draco’s competence.
“I think it’s broken,” Teddy says, looking down at his arm. It doesn’t look broken to Harry, but he is in no way a Healer, and Teddy is looking very very pale. They’re sitting in the emergency waiting room at St Mungos, the plastic chairs are uncomfortable and the light is harsh. Harry doesn’t like it here. Maybe if he’d been a better guardian he wouldn’t have to be here.
“You love me.” Harry strips his pants off, standing naked in his bedroom with the man he loves, the man he’s been wanking over for weeks, staring at him. His cock is leaking, his body too full of adrenaline to concentrate.
“Am I a terrible godfather?” Harry asks, his voice small. Draco’s hand is so warm on his back, and he feels so comforted and safe.
“Have you read the interview? Or just jacked off to him winking?” he finally asks. Harry feels heat rise in his neck and cheeks and ears.
“Clearly! How much did they pay you for a naked shoot?” Neville asks. Harry knows it’s a joke, but he can’t help but see how uncomfortable Draco looks. He makes most of his money modelling, and donates half of it to his mental health charity, but it’s still something he doesn’t talk about. Draco picks up his glass of whiskey.
Harry spends over himself with a shout, the orgasm tearing through him, blinding and intense. His balls ache with the force of it, his legs shaking and his eyes watering. His chest is covered in spunk, thick and hot, and he removes his hand slowly, sinking deeper into the bed as the realisation of what just happens floods him.
“I know. You’d never do that, would you?” Draco turns back to Teddy. He’s rubbing Teddy’s back, soothing with touch as he always does. Harry feels sick. He couldn’t do that. He can’t soothe. He can just get his godson’s arm broken.
“Don’t be damp, Harry.” Ron laughs, pushing Harry into the room. He’s right, Harry knows. He defeated Voldemort. He faced death. He needs to get a grip. He gives himself a shake and grabs a glass of champagne. Ron claps him on the back, hard, and Hermione comes to stand between them, linking her arms with theirs.
Draco’s mouth presses against his, soft and insistent, and Harry leans into it. Their bodies rock together, Harry’s arms slipping around Draco’s waist, pulling him closer as Draco’s mouth opens. Their tongues twine together, and Draco starts to move them down the corridor towards Harry’s bedroom.
“Good luck. I’ll be here,” Draco practically growls. A small, highly embarrassing noise escapes from the back of Harry’s throat and then Hermione’s hand is wrapping around his arm, dragging him towards the stage. Where he has to give a speech whilst sporting the hardest erection of his life.
He could wank and not think about Draco. That wouldn’t be wrong. He could think of any of the guys he’s fucked in the past few years. He could just think about an arse, with no face attached. Just think about sliding into a hot, tight, hole.
“Two please, somewhere quiet,” Hermione says, her hand still on his like a vice. They weave through tables, and Harry has just enough time to note how nice it is, big windows enchanted to show a Tuscan sunset, a big glass chandelier, cosy booths with thick red table clothes. He’d love to come here on a date. Or at least with someone who wasn’t frog-marching him everywhere.
“Anyone want another?” he mumbles as he walks away, knowing he won’t be heard. Ron arrives at his elbow two steps later.
“It hurts,” Teddy says. Draco nods, moving to sit next to Teddy and putting an arm around him. Harry relaxes into the chair and watches Draco with Teddy. He loves seeing them together, the soft way Draco talks, the gentle ease of it. When they’re talking like this Harry can see the family resemblance. The straight nose. The pointed chin. The shrewd eyes. Draco’s gaze flicks to him again, and he gives a small, soft smile, before pulling Teddy onto his lap.
Harry is a disgusting human being. It’s been three weeks since Hermione gave him that accursed magazine, and he’s not sure there’s been a night he hasn’t had a wank over it. Even when he doesn’t actually look at the magazine, the only thing he can think about when he indulges in his nightly relief is Draco fucking Malfoy. Not even a random blond haired, grey eyed, stunningly handsome man. No. Very specifically Draco.
“Do you still…?” Ron trails off at the end of the question. Four years ago, Harry made the terrible decision of confiding in his friend that he had a minor,
“Why?” Draco asks. Harry doesn’t have an answer that makes sense anymore. Draco's eyes flick down to the magazine still in Harry’s hand. He smirks, his eyes darkening. “You’re reading my interview?”
“I have no idea,” Harry replies, feeling shaky, his voice cracking. “I looked away for one second and he’s fallen off the broom. It’s only a test broom! It flies three feet off the ground. I don’t know what happened…” he trails off. Draco’s hand is on his back, rubbing small circles, soothing him. It doesn’t help the situation in Harry’s pants.
And then Harry is sliding into his heat, their bodies closer than Harry could ever have dreamed. They rock together, their mouths connected, and Harry doesn’t think he’ll last long. Next time. There will be a next time, and next time Harry will spend hours worshipping Draco’s body. Learning every centimetre of it. But right now he drives into Draco, urged on by the way Draco moves, the sounds he makes.
guilty. He hasn’t done anything wrong. Well, he hasn’t done anything illegal. He wonders for a moment whether wanking over your friend is illegal, and decides there would be no way to police it, even if it was. He can feel that his blush isn’t going away, and he is resolutely not looking at Draco.
The friction of being inside someone, a blond someone, with grey eyes and a smile that lights them up. A deep growl, delicate fingers. That V that points to a cock. Blond curls trailing down from belly button to cock.
Harry takes a mouthful of food and chews it, watching her. No point in giving in too easily. He swallows and takes a sip of water. When it’s clear Hermione is about to break, he leans back in his chair and clears his throat. “Because I have a very small crush on Draco, and I don’t think seeing pictures of him naked will help me get over it.”
“Right. Because if you did, you would definitely want to see him naked.” Ron stares at him and Harry groans, banging his head on the bar.
“Harry, I’m close,” Draco pants against Harry’s mouth and Harry nods. He slides his hand between them, taking Draco’s cock in his hand and rubbing his hand in time to his thrusts. His brain is filled with Draco, his body tight, his balls aching, and then he feels Draco tense beneath him, as he comes. His hole clenches around Harry’s cock, sending him over the edge and ripping his orgasm from him.
“Ron!” Harry sits up, glaring at his best friend. Ron is the planner. Ron is the strategist. Ron is the one who makes it all make sense. Everyone knows that. Ron looks at him for a long moment, clearly enjoying the anguish that Harry is in. Harry is about to say something suitably snarky when Ron sighs.
“I came as soon as I could,” Draco says as he jogs into the waiting room. His hair is flying into his eyes, his t-shirt is tight on his pecs, his legs long in black jeans. He looks worried and flushed, and Harry’s cock twitches in his pants. He groans internally. He’s worried sick about Teddy, and his cock still can’t behave itself. He is the worst human being in the world.
“Do we need to talk?” Harry asks, pulling his clothes off, following Draco’s lead. Draco's suit jacket, shirt, tie, socks litter the floor, and Harry’s t-shirt and jeans join them.
Teddy looks up, trying to smile as Draco comes to a stop in front of them. He crouches down, rubbing Teddy’s knee. Harry clenches his legs together, willing his growing erection away. This is
They move together, lying down on the bed, Draco on his back, writhing as Harry prepares him. He’s whispering and moaning, and Harry can catch every other word. ‘Love’, ‘need’, ‘want’. Harry agrees, licking Draco’s chest, running a tongue over Draco’s hardened nipples, revelling in how responsive Draco is.
“I’ve been wanking,” he says to Ron, in a vague attempt to make himself feel better. Surely Ron will know what to do.
Out of lateness, rather than stubbornness, he’d not looked at the magazine that morning either. He’d barely managed to grab his training leathers and a piece of toast as he’d rushed from his flat. He rarely regretted not living in a wizarding house, but that morning was one of those times.
“Where are we going?” he asks Hermione as they march to the Apparition point. Harry wishes for a moment that Hermione wouldn't march everywhere. He aches from training, and he can’t concentrate on walking when he knows she’s carrying
“Being in love,” Ron replies like it’s obvious. It isn’t obvious to Harry, and he’s not entirely sure what Ron is talking about. He isn’t in love! Ron sighs, flopping onto the sofa with Harry. “Mind you, when I was in love I made out with another woman and then left you in a forest, so I’m not sure I can judge.”
“I didn’t… I… uh…” He did run away. And Draco followed him. And he pulled Draco from the fire. Draco drops his hands, stalking into the flat and shutting the door behind him with a foot.
Harry tucks himself away, shame flooding him. He just wanked over his friend. In his kitchen. Like an animal. He feels exhausted, spent and sticky, and he knows he can never,
“You should be nice to animals!” Teddy sounds indignant and Harry chuckles, memories of a cocky, arrogant Draco flooding his mind. Memories of Draco shouting at him across the Great Hall, of gloating about his broom, of making ‘Potter Stinks’ badges. He helpfully chooses to forget the memories of Draco being an actual terrible person. Draco looks at him, grimacing, clearly remembering the same things.
The food arrives and Harry lets Hermione stew for a moment as he digs into his pasta. It’s warm and comforting. Hermione finally sits up, taking her fork and stabbing at her penne. They eat without speaking, the clinking of their cutlery loud in Harry’s ear. He knows that Hermione will break first, because Hermione likes having the last word and she hates being wrong, and because he can see her thinking through an argument.
“He’s a good friend,” Harry says to stall. He doesn’t want to tell Hermione about his crush that has definitely gone away. If he tells her it becomes more real, and he doesn’t want to deal with it. She’ll insist that it’s something they should talk about, or she’ll want to do some reading, or
“More than I’m worth,” he mutters, and everyone rushes to assure him that’s not true. They’ve seen the pictures. They’ve read the accompanying interview. It was wonderful. He looks wonderful. He
“How are you feeling about the speech?” Draco asks, and Harry relaxes. Draco thinks he’s uncomfortable because of the speech. Which, to be fair, he is uncomfortable about. The erection is just adding to the discomfort.
"Until she was taking her leave.  Just before she left she said 'I trust you're keeping your nose out of my son's business, Mr. Potter.  It would serve you well to do so.'"
"I'm not here because of what you and Draco already talked about.  Trust me, I wouldn't be here unless I had damn good reason."
of it, tend to be a little bit sentient.  A little bit alive...  They actually develop their own personalities and have their own sort of magic."
Draco snorted a soft laugh that he tried to squelch when the suspected vampire turned his shadowed eyes to him.  "Oh god he knows I'm laughing at him, let's go somewhere else...."
Draco gave Paul a tight smile, then got some help bringing his cake back to his bench, watching the rest of his competitors take their turns as well.
Harry repeated the words a few times, banging on the door roughly.  Hermione and Ron were huddled under the invisibility cloak a few steps away while he tried to get Borgin back to the door.
He started to walk out of the room, then paused in the doorway, his hand on the frame, long fingers stroking the polished wood for a few moments before he looked back into the room at Harry.  “You mentioned, through Draco, about the ring...”
Harry chuckled, shifting to lean forward, resting his arms on his knees as he looked at the blonde boy.  "Did he reel back in horror?"
"No, I..."  Draco trailed off, sighing a bit as he realized he'd just outted himself to Harry on something else.  At this point he figured he was already in this, he might as well just tell all.
He ducked his head, looking away and suddenly very aware fo the hand he had on Harry's knee.  He pulled it away as he shook his head.  "No.  Do you?"
Not someone that Harry had been friends with, or would ever be friends with.  But he remembered shortly after the war while others had been interviewed about Dumbledore's Army, Zacharias had said he would have 'definitely turned up to fight' only he'd lost his coin and so didn't get the message that they were all meeting up.  He went on to claim it had probably been stolen by a Death Eater and Harry had rolled his eyes so hard it hurt.
There was, though.  Draco was lying and he knew he was lying.  He didn't go out because of all the people that seemed to radiate hatred towards him.  He didn't go out because he didn't want to see smiling pictures of dead people who haunted him while he was awake and while he was asleep.
“What would the point of that be?”  Harry tried to look confused, even though his brain was screaming joyously.
“Mistakes happen.”  McGonagall said, her voice ever so slightly uncertain as she looked from Draco's face to Harry's and back again, trying to make sense of this.
Harry paused as he was finishing cramming last minute bits and pieces into his trunk, wishing he'd listened to Mrs Weasley the night before to make sure he was done.
The young man slid the box with the receipt tucked into a corner across the counter to Draco.  “But I'm sorry I missed you last time.  Hopefully if you need to come back again I'll be here.”
“Okay..  Okay that's better..  Keep doing that.  Oh you probably shouldn't breathe so hard but.. I don't really know.  And I don't care so long as you keep breathing...”
“No.. well.. I don't know, actually.”  She hesitated, closing the book over her hand as she looked at Harry more directly.  “Harry...  Do you know how good Draco is at magic?  We see him do things but never that much and so it's hard to tell where he is skill wise.  You've spent more time with him since the start of school than I think anyone ever has aside from Crabbe and Goyle.  Have you noticed?”
“It sound like it...”  Draco chewed the inside of his lower lip, watching Harry and starting to smile when he saw the look on his face, unable to help laughing.  “Merlin...  You look thrilled...”
Re-telling in AU what happens when Harry finds Draco in the bathroom in book six. It wasn't supposed to be a chaptered fic but as I was writing it I realized there was no way to say everything in one part. So we'll see where it takes us!
He headed up to their dorm and set to trying to clean up the mess he'd made with the contents of his trunk after he'd torn it all apart looking for the ring.
"Would you shut up!"  He hissed, looking around and trying to control his breathing so he could listen.  "You have to be the dumbest clod in the world.  I don't give a rat's ass what you and your friends can do in here but do NOT call attention to us in this forest.  Not while I'm with you."
"Big fancy way of saying you don't WANT it to stop."  Harry smirked back at the blonde, still holding tightly to him.
"He didn't say much at the lunch, either.  Honestly it was just Slughorn appraising us.  Trying to decide if we were anything he could 'collect'." Harry framed the last word in air quotes, making a face.
It wasn't until close to midnight when a flurry of wings came in through the window, and his lap was suddenly full of Owl that he startled awake.
“Of course I didn't.  I don't know how any of this memory gathering was really his business.  And he could have just told me all of this in one meeting.  Two hours of conversation would have given me all the information he has, even if it's what he
“Not at all creepy.”  Draco said sarcastically, the snarky tone to his voice finally starting to return as he looked back at the dark haired man. “I know they are.  But how would you have felt, back before the wa-..”  Draco stopped, closing his eyes for a moment and exhaling a breath as he couldn't manage to choke out that single syllable.  Not right now, anyways. “...back when you were a target, if someone tucked you away in a flat somewhere, took your wand and assured you that OTHER people were looking out for your safety.”
Love you all, appreciate you all, hope that you're all doing well.  And if you're new here and new to this fic I love you, appreciate and hope you're doing well, too!
Harry waited, watching Draco who seemed unable to do anything.  After time stretched in silence too long, he held one hand out towards Draco in invitation, speaking quietly.  “Disarm me, Draco. Whether I won it or not, it’s always been and always will be yours.”
Draco's intake of breath made Harry smile, knowing then that the blonde had understood what he was getting at.  He turned to smile at him, feeling a bubble of almost excitement within his chest.  “He's got a bunch of them.  Horcruxes... Which doesn't mean he wouldn't get absolutely LIVID when he finds out one's been destroyed, but he has a bunch.”
It wasn't a surprise, he had known what Harry had immediately gone and told Neville after their last 'visit'.  But it was still uncomfortable to try and swallow Neville knowing and BADLY covering for his sake.
"Ugh.  I haven't heard that name in years, I haven't missed it."  Harry said, resting his head back against the wall.  "And I went a whole eleven years without ever having heard it in the first place."
What would happen when 'The Chosen One" decided he liked the idea of a Wizarding World, if not an entire world, under the power of Voldemort?
“Sorry.  I know about...”  Draco tilted his head a bit, clearly not wanting to say Sirius' name, and Harry was honestly quite grateful for that.  “She'll likely be one of the first to be killed if that makes you feel better.  Either because she gets sloppy thinking she's above everyone else, or she'll be murdered because she won't shut up about how close she is with the Dark Lord.”
With a huff he tore the envelope open and unfolded a very thick parchment that said something entirely different than every other missive he'd received since leaving the Wizarding World.
He moved to the side, further along the counter when Harry nudged him down, thinking of a million questions he wanted to ask but certainly couldn't while they were surrounded by Muggles.
"I had to think of something." He said, grinning at Draco.  "I figured that would actually be best."
Harry had tapped the back of the chair with his knuckles and straightened up, he nodded at the question and looked slightly apologetic.  "I want to go back and try the incantations.  I'm worried that if the missing stuff isn't in the house and someone else has it they'll start trying to move things around with word circulating that I own the place now.  We want to make sure if they're in someone else's possession we find out who it is."
Impossibly blue eyes, dark hair, and features that had been slightly more squared off where his own came to sharper points.  It was like staring at the past... Almost.  He was older now, he could see that.  Just like he was, of course, but he looked so much the same that it gave Draco's heart a particularly hard wrench.
He didn't, really.  He didn't at ALL appreciate any of the work that had been put into this.  He would much rather be at home in Malfoy Manor right then.  Blissfully alone in it's cavernous rooms and taking his chances with this 'new power' that everyone was rumbling about.
He was in the middle of contemplating what the weird wood and metal structures were when Harry broke the silence.
"A subtle enchantment."  Borgin said, already laying the ring and cloth on the counter, pushing it towards Harry by the fabric.  "It alters the perception of the wearer.  Opens their mind to things they had never before considered."
Draco was at the window of his Room of Requirement bedroom, looking outside and watching the peacocks.  He turned and looked over his shoulder at Harry who was seated on the floor going through one of the magazines that were strewn about the room.
“I would have been fine.”  He eventually muttered, lifting his mug to take a larger gulp of coffee, but then pushed it away.  “You're both acting like I've never lived by myself before and need taking care of.  I have, as it happens, been living on my own for years and not once have I died.  Miraculous as that may seem.”
Not to mention how much time they spent whispering together.  Stopping as soon as Harry got close to them.  Or the even more annoying 'meaningful looks' they gave each other often when Harry did decide to say something.  It was annoying.  Anyone would find that annoying, it wasn't just him being intolerant.
“Sounds good to me,” agreed Luna. She held out her hand to Ginny. For a brief moment, she had flashback of her dream, Luna holding on her hand, saying she was sick.
“I saw him at the quidditch game!” Wait. Victor Crum? Victor Crum was a professional quidditch player. He was very good and one of the youngest in the league. She hasn’t realized he was still in school! And at Hogwarts no less!
Despite having seen Draco shirtless plenty of times, Harry raked his eyes appreciatively over the pale chest as if it was completely novel to him. No, he would never get used to that sight, he was sure of it. His gaze travelled up to Draco’s face and found himself breathless as he took in Draco’s flushed cheeks, slightly swollen lips and dishevelled hair.
“I’m fine,” he mutters. Everyone eyes him suspiciously, but goes back to talking to Hermione and Ron about the speech. Harry takes a deep breath and turns to find Draco standing next to him, looking worried.
It’s not a voluntary reaction, he’s aware. He has trained his cock to swell at the sight of Draco, because he’s been wanking over Draco’s picture, and exclusively Draco’s picture.
“I haven’t.” A car drives past, and Harry glances over at Draco. His nose is so straight, his lips curling slightly at the corners, even when he’s relaxed and not smiling. Harry takes a deep breath. “Do you want me to?”
Fuck it. Harry tugs his cock out of his shorts and pants, not bothering to shove them down, and starts to rub a hand over it in quick, tight bursts. There’s no finesse. He doesn’t bother to tease himself, just watches as the image of Draco moves, winking and smiling. He has a beautiful smile. There’s a trail of blond hair leading from his belly button down behind the book. Harry knows what it must lead to, and his imagination provides an image.
“Spending the day with you,” he replies. Draco smiles at him, a genuine smile that lights up his eyes and makes his shoulders relax.
He hadn’t looked at the magazine when he got back to his flat from dinner with Hermione the night before. He had tossed it on his kitchen table and pretended to ignore it for the rest of the evening as he watched a film and imagined himself being whisked away by the attractive male lead, who was not at all tall and blond, with chilling grey eyes.
Hermione accosts him after training. He’s sweaty and gross, his hair plastered to his forehead and his Quidditch leathers starting to chafe. He really doesn’t want to be accosted, but there she is, standing by the entrance to the locker room, smiling at him knowingly. She greets Harry’s team-mates as they walk past her, and Harry narrows his eyes. She never just turns up to his practice without arranging it beforehand. Something is wrong.
“We’re going to that new Italian place on Diagon, and you are going to explain to me why you refuse to support your friend and buy the damn magazine,” Hermione huffs. They get to the Apparition point and she doesn’t wait for him to prepare before grabbing his hand and spinning them to Diagon Alley.
The park is filled with children running around, dogs sniffing the ground and each other, people playing Muggle sports. It’s filled with life and movement, and Harry takes it in, feeling like he’s part of it. Just another person, enjoying the park on a summer’s day. Next to him, Draco takes a deep breath.
It’s just embarrassing, that’s all. Because he’s thought exclusively about Draco for nearly a month, and because the feelings he had for Draco are definitely becoming something more, and let’s face it, he’s never been great with people he’s liked. Memories of trying to ask Cho to the Yule Ball creep into his mind, and suddenly he’s standing in front of his friends with his cheeks on fire.
“It’s not a treat!” Harry half shouts, catching himself before he can be too loud. He looks behind him to make sure none of their friends heard. Draco is sat in the middle, laughing with Hermione, looking every bit the model he is in a tight black t-shirt. Objectively, Harry knows that Draco is hot. He’s a model. It is literally his job. But Harry has never thought of Draco in
They should probably talk. Maybe define what their relationship is, or will be. But Harry doesn’t feel the need, because they are what they’ve always been, and what they always will be. Linked and together and dependent on each other in a way that makes this seem inevitable.
Draco smiles at him, standing close, his eyes dark and his lips pink. Harry can’t be here. His cock is painfully hard, his heart is painfully beating, and his head is painfully sluggish. He needs to leave. He’ll buy something later. Or he’ll buy the first thing he sees now. Other than the portrait of him and Draco. Draco already bought that.
Hermione and Ron are waiting for him at the door to the events room. Ron is in smart black dress robes, also not done up, and Hermione is in delicate blue dress robes that are, their heads bend close together as they share a whispered joke. They look good together, happy and confident, and Harry realises he’d quite like something like that. An easy happiness. Or, no. Their happiness isn’t easy. It’s fire and passion, and a deep respect. Ron is the only one who can tease Hermione about her lack of cooking skills, and Hermione is the only one who can joke about being the more intelligent of the two of them.
“So. Explain.” Hermione picks up her menu, even though Harry knows her attention is on him. He copies her movement, not really looking at the menu. He’ll probably get spaghetti bolognese.
Harry’s chest tightens, something stirring in his stomach. “Well then, you definitely should have taken them,” he says. Draco looks at him, his grey eyes swirling with something, and he smiles softly.
