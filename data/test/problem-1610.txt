So many, he can tell, were taken inside of nightclubs and discos. Some with swinging colored lights and glitter pressed lips. Eyelids that sparkle, and jeans that hug too tightly. There’s a man swinging around a pole, and he’s wearing nothing but a loose garment around his hips.
He sighed with resignation, and vowed to never view Malfoy's videos ever again. He could no longer endure any more of his confidence and shiny hair.
“Yes,” Harry says. “I’ll be there. Let me grab a few things.”
“The wall?” Harry’s almost asked, which wall.
The crowd of muggles chatting loudly with the guards at the wall is only just beginning to thicken, and Harry doubts anyone’s got the energy to spare him a critique of his sense of style.
“What?”
“What are you doing?” Harry asks.
“You said we shouldn’t leave,” Harry says, but Malfoy’s already standing and Harry cranes his neck just to catch his eyes.
Malfoy’s arm stretches before him, and he reaches to pluck out a hanging picture. “I took this just yesterday. I reckon the film’s still developing, but there’s a stark contrast between the images of the wall we just took and this one right here.”
“I’ll show you around,” Malfoy says, tucking away his camera. “But I assume we’re both overdue a drink.”
"No," Hermione said quickly. "There isn't. Just don't watch one if there ever is a new one, which there isn't, by the way."
“I understand. I’ve got files and papers lying about everywhere. It drives Hermione wild.”
Harry finishes his toast, and nurses his empty tea cup between his hands as Malfoy unfolds himself, and disappears into the narrow hall.
“Yes. You saved us from grave evil, Potter. It’s the least I can do in behalf of the wizarding world. And the muggles, really.”
“I can imagine,” Harry mumbles, still looking at the picture. He takes the bottle of vodka from Malfoy, taking a short swallow of the stuff and coughing just a little. ‘What else have you got?”
“They’re quite explicit,” but Malfoy’s standing, and he’s heading towards a pile of cardboard boxes. He pulls out a few photo albums, and they slide onto the couch as Malfoy flips one open across their laps.
"You hair is a mess," Malfoy said.
“Sod off,” Harry stands from the kitchen table. “I look like rubbish.”
Finally, he found Ginny chatting with a stranger, and headed towards her without interruption.
“No. Not enough.” Harry was practically rutting against Malfoy’s half-hard erection. Impatient, he finally pulled their pants down.
“If,” harry spoke quickly. “Theoretically, if I stayed. What would happen?”
Draco moves his face to the side, wet lips brushing against Harry’s cheek. “There.”
“It’s not the tidiest. Work-“
"All?" Hermione seemed just as distressed. "There are at least a hundred of them."
Malfoy raises is eyebrows. “Well. Do you?”
“I did not.”
“I don’t fucking know,” Harry whispers, and he’s looking at Malfoy’s lips, like one gazes at the sun when they know full well that they shouldn’t.
"Fine," Malfoy relented. "Just, keep your distance."
"Yes, that makes total sense."
Harry's fingers curled against the glass tightly, and Malfoy stashed his wand away. "What are you doing here?"
“Let me try.”
“Malfoy.”
“No. I wasn’t.”
“Or you could simply leave,” was Malfoy’s response. He took a peek into the ball room, and said, “They all appear severely intoxicated.”
“It’s a charm,” their boots touch, somehow Harry’s gotten a little closer. “You can tell. If you look close enough.”
“Malfoy,” Harry says. “What was it like? Living here.”
Harry placed a hand on his arm and then Apparated them both home.
Malfoy’s fingers skimmed over some of Harry’s messy belongings. He eventually looked towards Harry, and froze. “Where can I hang my coat?”
“None at all.” He lets go, and the ball bounces at his feet.
“Perhaps it’s been a busy morning.”
“You weren’t called back,” Mafloy’s lips hug a cigarette as he walks across the living room to prop open a window, then fishes for a matchstick.
“Are you drunk?”
But someone has grown rose bushes by picket fence, and when Malfoy unlocks, and they climb up the short steps to the door, he can see many pots of flowers and other plants.
"There's a gala in a few days-"
“I say a lot of things.”
“Who?” Malfoy’s watching Harry’s magic as though he is in a trance.
“Oh,” she says, taking the gift from his hands. “I told you he was good.”
“Paris,” Harry thinks of the Beauxbaton girls, charming their way through Hogwarts, and then remembers the present he’s got to wrap for Fleur.
“Really?” and Harry can’t help but take them from Malfoy’s hands. “These are wicked. I was there, you know?”
“My muscles.”
Malfoy passes him the cigarette.
“Come with me.”
A man begins to hack at the wall. Some seemingly arrive prepared, with hammers and muggle tools weakly dismantling pieces of the wall. They begin to climb over one another, helping each other to cross over the wall as the guards stand, almost awkwardly, too stiff and too unguided to do much but stare and clutch at their weapons.
He watched as Malfoy’s expression changed, as his body shook, and he released. All of it was enough to already cause a twitch in his cock.
“You’re taking pictures.”
"I meant outside." Harry took a sip of the drink to appear more laid back, but he almost choked when it burned a path down his throat.
Harry looks away from the films just long enough to make eye contact and nod in approval. “Whatever is fine. This is all yours?”
Then he was standing between Harry’s leg, and pushing him down towards the bed until his back hit the sheets. “Buck up.”
“Good.” Malfoy took a step back. “Good.”
“Harry, thank Merlin you’re here. I can’t do this anymore. I’ve still got to wrap Dad’s odd muggle contraption that Hermione’d insisted I gift him and I just can’t be bothered any longer with this shite.”
“Of course.”
"Obviously, I was invited."
“Of course it fucking scares me, Potter,” and Malfoy’s scoffing as though Harry’s entire existence is a joke. Which, frankly, it is. “That was very Gryffindor of you to ask.”
It reveals the palest chest Harry’s every seen, and pink nipples that stand under the cold wind that wafts through the window. It’s suddenly warm, as Malfoy tosses his sweater as his feet, and bends to take his trousers off. He stands, by the half opened window, in nothing but his briefs.
Malfoy’s eyes are cool, there’s a crinkle in the corners of his eyes that suggests he’s having so much more fun than he should at the moment.
Harry bites his inner cheek. “I could come with you. Backup.”
The ball room that held the gala was lit up in a thousand different floating candles. They bobbed in the air and cast a golden glow around the area. Harry was almost instantly surrounded by different people. The minister made a show of greeting him, and welcoming him to the event. He placed a firm hand on Harry's back and ushered him around the place. Harry was forced to shake hands with many people he would never remember, and every familiar face he spotted was too far away from him. He found Hermione while he was forced to embrace an elderly stout woman, but when he dislodged, she was no where to be seen. Ron was by the drinking fountain, but every time Harry made an excuse to leave, someone else would take a hold of him.
There’s one of Teddy’s drawings hung up on the refrigerator with a magnet keeping it in place, and Draco seems to be running his fingers over all the sweet tokens that Hermione’s been keeping magnetized onto her fridge.
“You do.”
“Hermione,” Harry draws closer to the fire. “Did you lose your earrings?”
Draco’s pink lips stretch into a small smile. “C’mon.”
“I can tell.”
“Why?”
When he turns around again, Malfoy’s eyes are beacons of light in the dark room. Neither of them say a word, and it burns Harry’s throat.
Harry rolls his shirt and clutches it in his hand as he walks over by the window. The white panes are in need of some dusting, and the windows are stained, but Malfoy lets him lean against the cold glass and takes a few photos before Harry can ask if he looks ridiculous or not.
“Malfoy, you are perhaps the most frustrating man I’ve ever met.”
Malfoy’s wearing a thick Christmas sweater with a reindeer on the front, and a giant red nose sticking out from it. He looks much the same as he had at Hogwarts, and age has only further defined his bones. Harry thinks Malfoy’s sweater hangs from him, as such an item hangs from a thin coat hanger.
“Obviously,” Harry echoes. “But you can now. You will be able to, I mean.”
“How do you know I looked through the pictures?”
"And I have a reason to believe that Malfoy's going to be there."
“Oh yes,” Malfoy takes a swig of the bottle and passes it to Harry before disappearing. “Here.”
“Don’t bother with that,” Harry had shrugged his off the moment their feet touched solid ground, and it now laid in a crumpled heap on his carpet.
“Are you offering?”
“Language.”
“How romantic.”
“You didn’t have that much to drink.”
The two of them get shoved around until they’re pushed to the outside ring of the crowd, and it’s less noise, and it’s more of just them and the guards and this bizarre night that only continues to escalate in strangeness.
Malfoy watches him over his cigarette, then pulls it out of his mouth and gives it a tap over an ashtray.
“Are you seeing anyone?”
The rush of the floo distracts Harry from climbing up the stairs to grab some presents and wrapping paper.
Harry’s eyes landed on his bed and he cursed himself for being so blunt.
They appeared inside Harry’s bedroom, and both looked away.
“No shit.”
“I am,” and it almost looks as though Malfoy winks.
"I meant with his hair."
Hermione gives him one of her looks. One of which suggest that he’s clearly underestimating her interpreting abilities.
They stood facing one another for a moment.
For ever since Harry and Ginny split up, Ron and Hermione’d somehow gotten in their heads that Harry was decaying in a bout of loneliness. Which he wasn’t. Yes, Grimmauld Place can seem awfully large without a Weasley companion, and cold, and dark, but Harry is fine. He finds that he quite enjoys solitude when he can find the time between work shifts.
“For now.”
“Whatever shall we do?”
He almost giggles.
The crowd is a mixture of singing and cries of joys and whoops. Harry is half-tempted to follow the men who are hoisted over the wall. They sit, not quite sure which side of the wall to leap from. And some, from the West where Harry is, begin to cross over. And then more and more of them, until those who cross from the East and those from the West, all blur together as though they are simply people crossing a road. They nod to one another, they smile, they hug, they cry as though they are no strangers to one another. Under the winter moon, they are all one and the same.
“If you stare that hard I think he may finally notice you.”
“It’s very good,” Malfoy says, and he sits across from him. And they sit there, Malfoy listening to the radio, and Harry half-waiting for Malfoy to say something to him. Anything, it wouldn’t matter what it was.
He slowly regains his energy, and begins to clean after the mess they’d all left behind. He thinks he’s even spotted a set of Hermione’s golden earrings, but it’s just the glitter and shine from one of the strings that had popped from their crackers.
“Why not?”
“And you’re stuck with me.”
Now all there’s left to do is wrap some presents and stick them under the tree.
“I think so,” Harry finds himself walking towards the hanging pictures, examining one of a stiff family. “Do you take any magical ones?”
“Thank you, Malfoy. I appreciate you letting me stay.”
Harry takes the cigarette, but he only holds it over the ashtray. “They’re good pictures.”
“Then I will blend right in.”
Harry holds his breath. He’s not quite sure if he’s more upset over Malfoy’s appalling wrapping techniques that Hermione had so eagerly praised, or over his sarcastic comment that surprises Harry in a way he hadn’t expected to be surprised by Malfoy’s character.
Malfoy grabs a clear bottle and stands beside him so their arms brush, and Harry smells the opened bottle of Vodka, and the sharp cologne Malfoy has on. “Yeah. The place is borrowed, from a friend. I needed it if I wanted to keep my job and was lucky enough he was thick enough to escape west.”
“Do you want to fuck one? Right now?”
"Stop being dramatic," Hermione snapped. "Just don't watch any of his other videos."
“All right over there?”
It’s a collection of skin tones and warm shades, and of rippling abs and muscles, of soft curves and pubic hair.
Harry was more than just fucked.
Harry Potter stared down at his muggle smart phone, and then stared some more.
"So you do know what I'm talking about."
“You have a fetish for my hair?” Malfoy said breathlessly, casting a quick cleansing spell.
"You seem flustered. Are you sure I'm the one who should be drunk?"
Malfoy looks away. “Of course.”
“I should find a place to stay.”
Malfoy’s eyes ran across Harry’s messy hair, and then fell to his lips. “Yes.”
Malfoy ran his fingers through his hair while he thumbed the pre-cum on Harry’s tip, and smeared some of it down the rest of his length. “What about my hand? Is this okay?”
Harry expects anything but the snort that escapes Draco Malfoy.
Harry looks down at the photo album in his lap, and turns over the cover page. It is clear right away that this one is far more explicit than the first.
“I take people’s pictures too,” Malfoy explains, standing behind a desk and rummaging through boxes. Harry catches a flash of his silver hair, falling across his face before Malfoy quickly tucks it away behind his ear. “Not just for the papers, I mean.”
“Yes.” But Malfoy doesn’t seem desperate to see anybody any time soon. “I suppose. Besides, I’ve built all of this myself.”
"Help," he said.
“You’re doing no better with your tongue.”
Malfoy leads Harry down a narrow alley way, someplace past a bustling restaurant, and a waiter who calls out to Malfoy in rapid German. Malfoy laughs, and the sound rings in Harry’s ears as they split from the rowdy crowd of people, and into the backdoor of what seems to be a dark store.
Malfoy smirked down at him, and took the opportunity to capture his lips again. Shirts went flying, and trousers followed. Malfoy’s grasped Harry’s hips tightly before he pressed both their hips together. Harry let loose a strangled noise, skin heating up as he felt Malfoy’s erection press against his through the thin material of his pants.
Malfoy wandered around the room. “You don’t own a single hairbrush.”
“What for?”
“Yes,” he hears. “But it’s far more difficult to develop those without anybody noticing. I think I’ve found a solution to quicken the process.”
“Just the one,” Malfoy tucks his hands into his pockets. “Are you feeling cold? I could get the fire.”
“Perhaps you will.”
“I’m not,” Draco takes a deep breath. “I’m not against it. I just miss her, terribly. And I hate that she thinks she’s got to stay away from me to make him happy.”
It’s dim in the room, but Harry makes out a glossy picture of a man wrapped in fur, beaming before the camera. “That’s him. We’ve been able to keep in contact with some of those on the other side. It’s rather dangerous and awfully Gryffindor.”
Harry sighed and finally looked up.
“That’s fucked up.”
Malfoy’s turned away, moving behind a kettle and two mugs he’d pulled out from the cupboards.
“Let me,” and Harry pushed Malfoy down and spat on his hand before jerking him off.
his fingers worked in his hair, and Malfoy began to frown as the curls struggled against his careful touches. “Your hair is impossible.”
Draco jerks back, pulling his hand to his chest as though Harry’d burned it. Then he straightens up. “I should go.”
Harry tries to manipulate the ball with a wand-less spell, and he manages to suspend it in the air. He deactivates the charm, so that it will only work when the next person touches the ball, and then begins to wrap the ball as he well as he can. “Where is she, anyway?”
Harry’s not so sure about that, but he hopes for once that Malfoy’s right.
Luna refills their mugs of hot chocolate, and tosses an extra mini marshmallow in Harry’s with a wink. The song on the record player’s a little more upbeat now, and it’s making a few of their friends stand to their feet for a break, to dance a little and muck around as though they’re still at Hogwarts, hosting an early Christmas party long past curfew o’clock.
The scents rush to his head, and he feels almost dizzy with the reminders of the holiday season so blatantly displayed before him.
“Why do I have to listen to you?”
“They all break eventually.”
“A magazine,” he shrugs. “Though now I assume for naught. All things considered.”
“Perfect.”
“No. I don’t think anyone will.”
"Then leave," Malfoy said simply.
"I don't see what the big deal is about," she said. "Yes, he was an arse, but no one can deny he's skilled with his fingers."
“What?”
He wished he hadn't when he found Malfoy leaning comfortably against the balcony rail. The first button in his crisp shirt was loose, and one of hands cradled a half-empty glass of what looked like firewhisky.
He wondered if anyone else knew about this. How many of his friends had seen this? Did they laugh at their childhood nemesis, or were they just as addicted as Harry was? He doubted it was the latter, and he was in too deep with one particular video where Malfoy was curling his sodding hair with a hair curler, that he didn't bother to check.
“Welcome to my own laboratory,” Malfoy says with an elaborate wave of his hands. “I’m sure I’ve got a bottle of something down here. Vodka. Is that all right?”
Malfoy still appeared thoughtful. “Perhaps if you used it on several occasions, it could have an overall improvement on you hair.”
“Perhaps don’t use your wand. You can do that, can’t you?”
“You didn’t leave either, after looking through the pictures.”
As soon as he was within walking distance to Ginny, she took the stranger's hand and walked off.
“I can handle it,” Harry looks up at Malfoy’s silver-gray eyes. “Thanks.”
His fingers continued running through Harry’s hair, and he slowly looked away. “We could try a potion.”
Draco’s hand begins to retreat, but Harry catches it swiftly. “Where else?”
“Are you usually this insufferable?” Harry mutters, grabbing the box of chocolates from Draco and using a pair of scissors to curl the ends of the twine so they look less like a rat’s limp tail.
“I have an idea or two,” Malfoy takes the last delicate bite from his toast, and then brushes the crumbs from his fingers as he stands. “Wait here.”
Hermione finally turned to Ron. "This is your fault. You fix this."
“From that ghastly look on your face? Yes.”
Harry swallows down his tea. “So you’re stuck with me.”
“I’m not quite sure you want to see those,” Malfoy says, but his voice is half amused.
“Malfoy,” Harry’s lips twitch, like saying their names out loud is only sounding more ridiculous.
“Okay,” Draco smiles. “C’mon then.”
“So are you,” Harry retorted. Finally swallowing down his nerves, he sat on the edge of his mattress.
He groaned and buried his head in his arms. "There is something wrong with me. Seriously, seriously, wrong with me. Ever since Ron sent that bloody link, I can't get Malfoy's stupid face out of my head."
“Tea, please. If you’ve got any.”
“I’d better.”
His hands are in his back pockets, and he takes them out only to tuck them back in. “Well. If you need anything I’m right across the hall.”
Harry looks up sharply. “Perhaps.”
His hair was short. It was messy, and curly, and it stuck in every direction. Harry combed through it with his fingers, trying to experience what Malfoy must have in every one of his videos. But his locks got tangled too easily, and they didn't comply with his flimsy fingers the way he wanted them to.
“A few risky lovers?”
“Of course,” Harry stands to his feet. “I’ll be there.”
Harry nodded, and struggled to find his voice. “If that’s no trouble.”
After he was done watching the video, Harry dragged his feet to his bedroom mirror and stared.
They leave the building and find themselves out in the cold streets again, the ebbing sounds of some celebration happening a few paces behind them.
“Nope,” Malfoy says, twisting some twine over a box of chocolates. “Still the same muggle hating, Voldemort loving fool I’ve always been.”
“Depends on your definition of the word,” Draco snatches the box back, and touches the twine gently before tossing it aside. “Show me how you did that.”
Harry thinks this feels a lot like getting drunk with his friends.
"Malfoy," Ron and Harry said simultaneously.
“Come in, if you’d like.”
“I’m not sure. Tonight feels different, does it not?”
“That’s good,” Harry lifts the package up. “Really good, actually.”
“Coffee?”
“I’d rather a warm bed.”
It’s a few floors up to Malfoy’s flat, and once they’re there it’s obvious even in the dark, that the flat is half-lived in.
“It is terrible everywhere you go, it doesn’t make my case any special.”
“You’re impossible.”
“All right,” Harry laughs at Ron’s state of distress. “I’ll handle it. Go deal with Arthur’s gift.”
“Does it matter?”
Harry shrugs. “Apparently I’ve got the face for that stuff.”
Malfoy’s fingers dig into his waist, and twists him around so Malfoy’s neck bends, and they’re almost nose to nose. “What are you so afraid of, Potter?”
“Yes. After, well, after tonight. Will you be coming home?”
“I’ll help. You’ll take all the pictures you need. And then you’’ll show me where to stay as I wait for a call to return home.”
“One of us would leave eventually.”
“Oh,” Harry says, and he flips through pages and pages of that stuff, of men in wigs and high heels. His heart is thudding in his chest.
"Do I want to know?"
“Malfoy.”
“May I kiss you?”
Harry finds himself climbing over the wall, and he’s on the East. Easy as that. Another flash catches his eyes, but this time the camera is directed at him, and when the photographer removes the camera from their eyes, Harry freezes, as though he’s waiting to have his picture taken again.
Malfoy looks right at him, and then moves as though trying to get to Potter. People push at his shoulders, and, he thinks, it’s only inevitable and entirely out of his control that he is practically thrust in Malfoy’s direction.
“Kitchen, I’d reckon.”
"Harry, you're my friend, and I love you, but you're a terrible liar."
“It’s good to see you again,” Harry says, when really he means to ask Hermione what the fuck did she think she was doing inviting Malfoy over to wrap presents.
Harry holds his breath, waiting as Draco pushes against the counter, leaning forward to look at his face. “Yes. Right there.”
"It's all yours, then," Harry said, almost breathlessly.
“Clever.”
“As do I.”
“You do now?”
The smell of eggnog and cinnamon is overwhelmingly out of place in Grimmauld Place. Although Ginny and Harry had decided to part ways weeks ago, it’s difficult to remove Ginny’s incessant holiday spirits from the old Black home. As difficult as it was for Harry to tear down the horrid wallpapers enchanted to with sticky charms from the gray walls of the town house when he’d first moved in.
“Are you going to work today?”
“That sounds like a mess.”
“All right.”
There’s a handful more people than he had imagined circling the Christmas tree. They’re all chatting over the sound of Hermione’s record player, something that sounds muggle and ancient and reminds Harry of Privet Drive and Aunt Petunia shoveling fruit cake down Dudley’s thick throat.  He finds he doesn’t mind it quite as much as he would’ve imagine. Besides, his friends call for him as he stands awkwardly by the fire place, and nothing about this place resembles his childhood home.
“Thanks, Hermione.”
“I know.”
Malfoy watched him with amusement. "What are
“I’m suggesting you kiss me. Or fuck me. I know you’ve been dying to since last night, and you haven’t been able to stop thinking about it since you saw those pictures.”
“Yes. If you want to, too.”
“It’s just I heard about the breakup.”
“Better?”
“Well, yes, officer,” Malfoy rolls his eyes and shuts the album. “Are you going to report us to the authorities?”
“I should take more of these,” Malfoy says, peering into his camera. He’s facing Harry, yet he’s surprised when another flash goes off. He blinks.
“The high spirits,” the cap from the bottle hisses as Draco spells it loose. Harry watches as Draco tosses his head back for a long gulp, the way some of the liquid escapes past his lips, rolls down his chin and to the length of his neck so Draco has to lift a hand, after, to clean the mess. “But I assume the wrapping too is taking a toll. I’m afraid we’re getting old.”
“I hardly think she’s anything to do with our current conversation.”
“Fantastic,” and Malfoy’s out of the flat. Just like that.
“Sod off,” Harry mutters, examining the ball. “It doesn’t work well with spells. I tried.”
It was just as good as the other ones. If anything, Malfoy seemed even more talkative in this one, something Harry thought he would never use to describe Malfoy. Malfoy's pale hair seemed luminous as he brushed it through with an expensive looking comb. Harry wondered how he kept all his videos muggle-proof, knowing that the slimy git used an infinite amount of hair potions to keep his hair in its pristine state.
“Oh, how stupid of me,” Malfoy turns and hurriedly fiddles with what seems to be a radio.
Harry’s breath hitched as Malfoy continued to moved his hand up and down his length. “Touch yourself.”
“That’s your decision to make?”
Not that it mattered. Harry watched him brush his hair, part it down the middle, and continue to braid it in quick steps that had Harry's head spinning to catch up with the movements.
“What?”
Harry discovers it’s a bouncing ball that transforms into different objects depending on the owner’s will, and Ron’s doing a terrible job of wrapping it.
"No, thanks."
Harry’s never seen anything like it. Not even in one of those magical magazines the boys used to keep under their beds at Hogwarts, charmed to replay images of men pounding into women.
“I know. I took them.”
“No. I understand.”
The table fell silent as his two best friends stared at him.
"Ever the civilized wizard," Malfoy commented, whirling the drink in his hand so the ice cubes clinked together.
Malfoy smiles. “It was in the Prophet. Pansy’d told me all about it, though the papers often lie so I didn’t think it was true.”
He watched so many, that he noticed Malfoy's older videos were filmed in a different location, that his hair was a tad bit shorter, that he talked a little softer.
And when they’ve had enough of those, they stand almost awkwardly. Harry’s still clutching the bottle of vodka, he realizes, and he takes a sip as he thinks of what to say next.
Malfoy, who looks as though he’d finally grown into his skin. Pale hair and paler skin all the same as they were in Hogwarts. But he’s less standoff-ish, now. As though he’s finally connected his mind with his body and he stands with the air of confidence that was once the counterpart of arrogance. A mocking of his father’s self-rightness that never went well with his gray eyes, or sharp chin.
“You seem to want to dance,” Draco says.
"I have. I've lost my goddamn mind over an arse like Malfoy, and I'll never be sane again."
The fridge opens without so much as a creak, and Draco’s long fingers find the curve of a bottle of firewhisky. “Sometimes that stuff gets overwhelming, doesn’t it?’
Both of them taste like vodka, he knows. He can smell it when Malfoy exhales, or when he speaks.
“All things considered,” Harry echoes. He’s not sure what the Auror department had in mind, but he can’t think of any way to return back to London. He’s been given no instructions in the rush of the event. Surely, they’d send someone else after him, just in case.
“Documentation.” Malfoy moves away, takes more photographs of people doing things like climbing over the wall, and further vandalizing the area as the guards stand idle.
Draco turns. “Potter.”
Malfoy’s fingers brushed against his own cock, making a show of knowing how to handle his own arousal and reminding Harry that he’d done it many times before. He touched them both, each hand working on a different shaft, until he let go of his own cock to hold them both in one had. It was rough, with nothing but pre-cum to aid Malfoy’s movements. Harry hadn’t had a decent shag in a very long time, and he was reminded of that when it didn’t take but a few more yanks to have him spilling all over Malfoy’s hand.
"Ron, I'm going to kill you?"
“She’s married to Bill.”
“Where are we going?” Harry asks, as Draco takes his hand.
"No," Harry said. "I'm not going."
“No, no, no. I don’t want you to be wrapping paper, I need you to wrap yourself with wrapping paper.” The ball reverts to its original form, pops, and is transformed into a sheet of wrapping paper. “Fuck!”
"I know," harry said weakly. "What am I going to do?"
“Fuck, Malfoy.”
“Right.”
Harry’s cheeks flush, and he looks away.
“I know,” but it came out as barely a whisper, and Mafloy’s eyes met his with a heated flush down Harry’s body.
Harry stands, and lights the cigarette for him. Malfoy’s breath comes out in a puff, but Harry doesn’t flinch away.
“I noticed.” Harry says.
Hermione set the rest of their dinner down on the kitchen table. "Who?"
“What do you mean?” he mumbles, but he’s perfectly aware.
Harry wants to ask if he’s asked this of every man he’s taken a photo of. He wants to know if these albums are the pre-game before he leads them into his bedroom, but Malfoy stubs the cigarette and slides his sweater over his head.
Harry didn’t have a chance to reply as Malfoy’s teeth grazed his skin, he seemed to suck everything from Harry’s neck.
"No. All you need to do is be there."
“I should go,” Malfoy looks his way again. “More pictures to take.”
“Oh,” Malfoy looks away, tidies the pictures in his hands and then turns to tuck them away behind his desk. There’s a round window there, overlooking other buildings, and the lights from the city are subtle and sweet. Different from London, Harry thinks. “I’m not sure what’s home anymore.”
Head Auror Dowson had announced the hasty, last-minute mission to Harry via the floo. Harry’d been comfortably winding down with a bottle of friewhisky and a stack of reports on the worn out leather couch of his run-down apartment when his fire place went mad, and he’d been thrust an emergency portkey to Berlin.
“I don’t want it.”
Harry moves from the living room to the kitchen, where the music isn’t as loud, and where the christmas decorations begin to taper off.
“That’s it? You just walk around doing whatever you want whenever you want to?”
“Having trouble?” Malfoy sits beside where Harry’s cross-legged on the wooden floor.
“Sweet, isn’t it?”
“Come on, then. Ron’s been asking about you. He’s got a special case with something he’s picked up for Teddy.”
“What kinda stuff,” and it’s unsettling, how Draco’s eyes look all over his face as though he’s never seen him before.
“You still talk better than you walk,” Harry says. There’s a loud bang, people cheer, and someone’s blown off a great chunk of the Berlin wall.
“Who’s that for, then?” Malfoy asks, smirks. “A new girl? Does the Prophet know?”
“What was that for?”
Malfoy’s in a dark blue robe over what appears to be a white set of pajamas. “So, coffee?”
“Don’t worry about it. Really. I should get out of your hair soon. I’ve already spent the night.”
He can still smell the eggnog, the spice, the cinnamon candles that lay scattered throughout the living room and into the kitchen, and the large pot of hot chocolate charmed to remain burning hot.
Someone begins to sing a song, and then the whole crowds chants something that sounds German and old in a way so synchronized that even Harry takes a moment to let the foreign words ring in his head. He wonders what the words could possibly mean, what song would be chosen to be sung at a night that seems charged with the electric sensation of a change that is on the verge of dismantling decades of a strict regime.
Harry leaves his post by the guards, and allows the crowd to shove him around.
Harry’s eyes swallowed in the image of Malfoy’s perfect cock, the way it bounced every time he made a move, the way his own cock brushed against it when he lifted his hips this way or that.
“Show me who else you’ve taken pictures of.”
Harry turns around to see Hermione examining their craftsman ship.
Harry watches as people hold video cameras, the flash going off from several cameras as men and women continue to break pieces of the wall.
“You sound upset,” and so does Harry’s voice, and he’s not quite sure why he feels disappointed.
“I can understand,” he says, and it’s whatever that their feet touch. It’s almost like a game now.
Harry turns to Hermione. “This Holiday’s charity case?”
“Yes,” Malfoy smiles behind the lens.
“And if I simply left, where would I go?” Harry asked. “Should I go inside or should I go home?”
Harry was suddenly at a loss for words again, he stood there awkwardly.
“What were you doing with Malfoy anyway Harry?” Parvati asked.
Draco chuckled as he turned to face Harry, “Do I have that affect do I?”
Harry could feel her eyes on him, “Harry... Is there anything you wanna tell me?”
Actually being in a relationship with Draco though...Harry’s heart fluttered at the thought. But he also knew the two of them were muddled with complexities, burdened by their pasts, fiery with emotions, they were both flawed but also exceedingly heroic. This was a lot to take in; such depth in their personalities made up of concealed truths and hidden secrets waiting patiently to be revealed to one another.
“I’m not suspicious.” Harry said sternly.
As the Golden Trio hurried along underneath the cloak, Hermione spoke.
“Draco, I’m sorry, it’s not my busin-”
Harry shook his head and avoided the question by stuffing his face with more pancakes.
Draco simply shook his head grinning, apparently too drunk to really analyse the details of this revelation.
“Shove off.”
“Now, I’d just like to begin by saying how wonderful the first half of the year has been,” McGonagall said standing, addressing them all.
There was a pause as Draco stared at Harry. Grey eyes on green ones, looking for truth.
As Harry’s eyes adjusted to the darkness, he saw five beds, four of which had their curtains hanging from their four-posters, obscuring their occupants. Harry had been in here enough times, but only when Draco was certain that the two of them would be alone. The fact that Draco’s fellow Slytherin friends all slept in their midst made Harry feel as though he was seeing Draco’s dorm for the first time again.
“Mr Potter! My goodness what an honour-”
Harry clung to him; one arm around his waist and another around his neck, his hand softly caressing the blond’s hair at his nape.
As they both scraped outwards into the air, Harry saw Draco’s fingers begin to close over the golden ball. He scrambled to close his hand over Draco’s, not ready to give up. When both their brooms hit the ground, they toppled over onto the grass in a tangle of limbs, Harry’s hand still clasped over Draco’s, feebly clawing at the Snitch underneath.
“Potter you’re stressing me out. Please sit down.” Pansy said miserably.
“Er, no, nothing. Just happy to be going back home.” His cheeks were warm.
Ron was actually frowning at the board, an expression that never came across his face whenever Harry played with him. Maybe Ron had actually found himself a worthy opponent?
“You heard me.”
Harry read over the letter. He felt he could’ve said more but the urgency he felt toward just responding to Draco was overwhelming, he needed Draco to know how much he missed him, how much he cared.
“You’re not ending it over this?” Hermione said tentatively.
“That time…” Draco panted as he kissed along Harry’s jaw, “When you guttered me on the Quidditch pitch in fifth year. Merlin I was so turned on.”
“Harry,” Hermione said sternly, still scribbling.
Harry reached out and squeezed Ron’s hand, “We’re always here for you.”
When Harry finally found Ron and Hermione, he quickly scurried over to them, thankful that they were sitting a little apart from the rest of the Gryffindors. Their faces looked at him with sympathy, but Harry could see Ron was also eyeing with him a look of disdain and betrayal.
As he eyes returned to the room at large, he saw his new Firebolt leaning against a corner in the room, and his trunk at the foot of his bed, underneath; a huge dark red and gold rug that covered just about the entirety of his dorm's floor. There was a small fireplace at the back wall, an armchair big enough for two people beside it, and a doorway next to the fireplace that led the way to the bathroom.
He and Ginny had ended their relationship during the summer, agreeing that they were both much closer as friends, and being in a relationship made them both feel oddly uncomfortable around the rest of the Weasley’s.
The eighth years, plus Ginny and Luna, happened to sit in the middle section of the table, whilst the various teachers began to sit all around them, and then the remainder of students sat at either ends of the table.
Harry awoke to quiet whispers and murmurs around him. His eyes were still closed, but he could hear voices he recognised. Perhaps this was another dream?
“Piss off. All of you.”
Harry felt himself going red as he refused to look at Ron as he felt the redheads eyes on him.
“You don’t think you could summon some back Potter? The last carriage just left.”
“Spying on me now are you?”
“Hey I hope that ‘LV’ doesn’t stand for Lord Voldemort.”
Ever since his chat with Luna around the Great Lake, Harry suspected that Luna and Draco possessed a special friendship that couldn’t ever be known to outsiders, for they had shared their fears and hopes, and most likely lots of tears between a hard iron door, in the midst of a horrifying situation that had lasted for months.
The eighth years were to travel to the Room of Requirement in small packs in order to avoid detection from Filch.
It was true, and Harry and Draco both knew it. In fact, they’d never totally overindulged in their relationship, they’d always leave each other wanting more, which only added to the thrill and pleasure of their secret fling. But the more they met up, the closer Harry became to Draco, and he’d become terribly afraid of what was in store for their fate.
Harry.’
As his eyes scanned the dark wooden walls again he noticed various posters of snitches and Quidditch players, the original list from Dumbeldore’s Army, a rare picture of himself, Ron and Hermione one summer at the burrow, another of all the Weasley’s, and a photograph of Dumbledore himself, smiling at the camera with a twinkle in his eye. There was also a desk and a small bookshelf. Harry thought inwardly about the size of Hermione’s bookshelf in her room, and the quite possible fact of all her walls simply being floor to ceiling bookshelves.
But then Harry paused. He looked closer at Draco’s torso and chest, before becoming overwhelmed by unwanted images of blood and water pooling on a cold bathroom floor. Harry standing beside a dying Draco, utterly shaken and helpless.
“Yeah, it is. And it’s driving me mad.”
“Ready to go?” Draco said as he approached Harry.
“Bit keen were we?” She said giggling, then she looked at Harry, whose hair was messed worse than it usually was, “Oh God please don’t tell me you guys were just getting it on before I knocked?”
Now, Ron and Hermione sat a few tables behind him.
Harry ignored him as he kept sucking on Draco’s neck and ran his hand softly over Draco’s toned stomach.
Her eyes also watered and sparkled with a kind of gratefulness. “I’m great Harry.”
Harry, suddenly unable to speak, simply nodded and kept George’s fierce gaze to convey his agreement.
“Luna!” Harry said.
“All right, for those who don’t know, if your name is called out, you choose either truth or dare. If it's truth, you gotta confess. If it’s dare,” she giggled, “well we’ll reach that bridge when we cross it.”
“Hm. I guess we have more than a few things in common.”
Blaise smiled, “Whatever this is,” He looked between Harry and Draco. “Blimey you’ve got no idea how much me, Pansy, Theo, Goyle and all the rest had to endure Draco’s endless rants of ‘Potter this’ ‘Potter that’-”
Harry stared at him.
Hermione looked up from across the table over her Daily Prophet, “What’s so funny?”
“Before we’re burdened by more tiresome obligations and responsibilities of adulthood?” Hermione said.
Harry’s attachment had grown tenfold, and it made him irritably uncomfortable. He didn’t want to be attached, he didn’t want to be looking out for a glimpse of the blond any chance he could.
As the night went on, both Ron and the staff became drunker and drunker. Hagrid and Slughorn had begun singing old wizard folk tunes, while the other teachers had gotten out of their seats and begun dancing atrociously around the Great Hall to various Christmas carols.
‘OK, so maybe I like men,’ he thought to himself. The thought, surprisingly, didn’t make him uncomfortable, in fact, it felt as though he was discovering a part of himself that hadn’t before had a chance of coming into Harry’s conscious. But now, with the war over, the Horcruxes destroyed, Voldemort defeated, Harry suddenly felt like he was learning to properly get to know himself.
Harry knew, no matter how much it hurt, that being with Draco meant putting his family at risk of Voldemort’s wrath, and he just simply couldn’t let that happen.
It was dawn, and the soft hues of light fell through Harry’s mullioned windows and danced gently upon the hardwood floors of his bedroom.
She held up her hand as if to stall his outburst. He saw, as she raised her hand, that she was holding something delicate in the other.
Draco.
Harry felt invincible and infinitely happy. He fell into a deep sleep wrapped in Draco’s arms.
“So are you going to kiss me or are we just gonna sit here like a couple of Hufflepuffs?”
Harry then felt Draco’s hand on his hip as the blond slid his fingers underneath Harry’s shirt, caressing Harry’s skin. Harry bucked into the touch.
Now appearing in contemplation, Draco’s face shone as he felt Harry’s grip slacken slightly.
“God Harry, your body,” Draco murmured into Harry’s neck between kisses, then lowered his hand even further to grip Harry’s cock.
“Hush not so loud, he is sitting on this table,” Hermione whispered, “But nonetheless, Ron’s right.”
Slowly, Harry looked up at him.
Draco ran soft circles through Harry’s hair as the blond looked to the ceiling. He seemed to read Harry’s mind when he spoke softly again.
Blaise laughed, “I don’t really go by labels. If I think someones attractive, whether they’re male or female, I’ll go for em’.”
“You’re reading Shakespeare?” Harry asked, once more noticing the book in Draco’s hand.
Harry turned to look up at Draco who stood looking effortlessly beautiful. A Slytherin scarf around his neck, a black winter coat that went down to his knees, and black cargo pants and sneakers. As he sat beside Harry, he took off his coat to reveal the same emerald oversized sweater that Harry had come to fall in love with, and his snow white hair was messed from the weather outside. ‘No one should be able to look this good’ Harry thought to himself.
“Mmmm, you smell soo good Draco.”
Draco giggled, “No. It was the summer wasn’t it? We had time to get off by ourselves whenever we wanted to.”
“Sorry Granger, your boyfriend’s quite the entertainer.”
Then they looked at each other, and Harry was sure he saw the same feelings Harry was feeling in the intensity of Draco’s grey eyes.
George shrugged, “It still hurts. A lot. But I know Fred wouldn’t have wanted me to sulk around. So I keep distracted. I keep up the business for him.”
“What are we doing Malfoy?”
Harry looked to Draco, whose head was bowed looking to the ground, his hair falling into his eyes. His hands, still wrenched behind his back by the unknown wizard who had pulled him from the ground, his whole body slouched.
“What are you talking about?” Harry demanded.
Harry raised his eyebrows, “Huh. I was never much good at that.”
Clearing his throat awkwardly, Harry slowly got up from Draco, the bulge in his pants embarrassingly uncomfortable as he made his way back to his place in the circle. Draco was red, his eyes had darkened, his hair a mess and his clothes askew, Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen anything more arousing.
Harry felt his heart rate speed up, “Well, actually...I was going to ask you that. You see, I was sure we went to bed together, but when I woke up you weren’t there?”
“I can get Ron and Hermione if you want-”
Slowly, Draco rolled over to face him. Harry locked eyes with his and slowly descended into the mattress, pulling the doona up onto himself as well. They now both lay on their separate pillows facing each other. Harry had no idea what was going on, all he knew was that he loved it. He reached out his hand again so as to touch Draco’s face but Draco grabbed it this time. Harry thought he might push him away, but instead, he curled his own hand into Harry’s and let them both fall into the space between their two bodies. Draco slowly ran circles with his thumb over Harry’s hand, before he whispered.
“And how do y’suppose you’ll teach three subjects ‘Mione?” Ron demanded.
Harry couldn’t stop himself from laughing.
“Blaise. Luna. You guys should come too.”
“What? He’s beautiful isn’t he?”
“But what other options have you? Oh, I don’t know, let me think… Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher perhaps?”
Harry could hear himself beginning to ramble but Draco’s giggle broke his words.
“Missed me?” Draco smirked at him.
Draco tightened his grip on Harry’s hair as he bucked into Harry’s hand, groaning.
Harry huffed in frustration. One minute Draco was vulnerable, the next his walls were up and he antagonised Harry in his own defence.
“Well?” Draco pursued him, grey eyes dark and an evil smile plastered on his fine features.
“D-draco,” He choked out.
“He’s our friend too,” Harry replied.
“Ron, I’d thought winning the war last year would’ve put things into perspective. Whatever happened between me and Malfoy in the past was trivial, principle, meaningless!-”
“Thank you Ron,” Luna said kindly.
Harry dug his head deeper into the crook of Draco’s neck and Draco hummed at the touch, clinging to Harry tightly.
The kiss was fiery and urgent. Gasps and moans escaped each other’s lips as Harry gripped Draco’s hair and Draco tightened his grip on Harry’s hip.
Harry was speechless. All the emotions that had been brewing in him since he woke up today were threatening to burst.
“Good. I’m glad,” She paused as she glanced at Draco in the corner. Then she looked back at Harry, “You look very happy Harry, I think you two make a nice couple.”
“Blaise how do you know about Roonil Wazlib?” Harry asked as he chewed his mash potatoes.
“What about you?” Draco hissed nervously, his face even paler than usual, “What are they gonna say when they see you and I are...are… you know…”
Harry had enough on his mind; between Voldemort’s repeated visits and his foreboding knowledge that the wizarding world would soon be in war… No, he simply could not be in love with Draco Malfoy.
Although Harry wasn’t seeing Draco as much as he’d liked due to their demanding workload, if he ever got the chance to sit next to him in Charms, or Potions or Transfiguration, he would. Harry would sit beside him at meal times and although his tiredness seeped into their Saturday Quidditch lessons, Harry managed to stay awake purely for the fact that he got to look at Draco.
“Then, maybe I’ll come see them after Christmas?”
“You have a strong magical trace.”
Draco gave him a look but the smirk on his lips gave his feigned anger away. He sat down next to Harry. Harry couldn’t deny that they were quite close to each other now. They weren’t touching but Harry could feel the other boys body heat.
The blond’s face looked hopeful as he faced away from his friends, but also, to Harry’s strange delight, a little worried.
“Alright then Draco dearest, it’s about time you had a go,” Blaise said pointedly.
“Draco,” Hermione interrupted, “Are they for our Runes assignment?”
Draco had gotten up to. He was standing beside Ron and Blaise in a corner, Harry noticing that the three shared a bottle of some amber liquid between them.
Draco placed his hand behind his head on Harry’s pillow. He looked Harry up and down, sizing him up as he often did before they’d fight. Harry hovered above him, his hands upholding him on either side of Draco’s head.
Harry kept his head in his pillow, “Right.”
Draco pulled Harry closer. Their bodies now flush together.
“Potter?” Came Theo’s voice as he stood beside Blaise, a look of utter disbelief on his face.
Harry couldn’t argue with that. Ron shrugged. Then the three of them headed for the eighth year table.
“‘Mione!” Ron said next to her.
“Earth to Ernie,” Neville said as the others were still sniggering.
“Jeez Zabini when did you become generous?” Seamus asked.
“Oi.” Came Ron’s muffled voice from the table.
Harry was in disbelief, but it only lasted a short moment, before he was suddenly overcome with excitement toward the day ahead.
Harry didn’t need to be asked twice. He kissed Draco passionately again, and Draco moaned into the kiss.
As Harry and Ron were helped by Draco and Hermione to ascend the stairs to their rooms, Ron was whining.
“Merlin I was so jealous of you when I heard you got Seeker.” Draco laughed.
“Then why do you keep coming back?” Draco asked, his grey eyes locked onto Harry again.
Harry knew Draco had no idea where the Gryffindor common room was, so he pushed away the idea that Draco could actually be looking for him. And yet, the turmoil swelled inside him; did he reveal himself and face the wrath of Draco’s anger? Or did he just chase the boy around like a lunatic?
Harry looked at the gold lettering on Draco’s belt again.
She smiled and looked at her fingernails, “Oh you know, we’re all just so open these days. All so trustworthy and accepting. I’d just thought I ought to let you know that.”
Harry swore to himself. This was quite a predicament.
“Yes Harry,” Draco murmured into his neck.
“Yeah those shabby cardigans really turned me on,” Draco said.
Draco shrugged and returned to his wand, “Yeah. I mean, at first I just thought it was principle. Like, you’ve got to hate each other you know? That explained the fights in front of the others. But…” Draco suddenly dropped his gaze to the table, “But how do you explain the incessant staring from across the Great Hall?” He returned his gaze to Harry. “I thought maybe it was just because I hated you so much that you always turned up in my line of vision, but, it wasn’t until later, that I realised I was actually looking for you.”
This caused a few giggles and Pavarti and Lavender started whispering profusely to one another.
Draco pulled Harry’s head back and connected their lips. Once more, their kisses were urgent, desperate, fiery. They panted and moaned into each other's mouths. Harry had snaked his arm around Draco’s waist and Draco pulled on Harry’s messy hair tightly.
“I figured. I thought I’d seen you wear this before.”
A moment later, Harry had reopened his eyes and was pulling Draco back properly onto the bed.
Pansy’s face broke into that ominous and mischievous smile, “The way I hear it, you’re making more than just an effort with our darling Draco here.”
Harry, barely hearing him as he took in the immaculate nature of Draco’s emerald and silver room, still said nothing.
“‘Mione,” Ron spoke with his mouth full, “Don’t tell me you got the house elves to make these?”
Seamus was practically sleeping on Dean; his whole body slumped up against him.
“Well, you are aren’t you?”
“I understand your decision Potter. After what you’ve been through, it’s only fair that perhaps the Dark Arts isn’t for you.”
The truths and dares continued to go around the circle, Harry only getting drunker and drunker at the passing minute. He’d noticed however, through his drunken haze, the dares getting more and more sexual.
“I saw that,” Draco said as he placed his books on a random coffee table and moved over towards Harry by the fire. As he sat down next to brunette, Draco looked at him and said, “Looks like I got my wish after all,” He winked.
Harry nudged him slightly in the shoulder, “Aye, that’s if you get chosen. And who were you expecting really? Ernie MacMillan?”
But just as Draco had brought his lips up to Harry’s jaw, and Harry’s hand had snaked to the back of Draco’s head, a sound at the end of the deserted corridor caused the two to jump away from each other at the speed of light.
Their bulging eyes bore into him and Draco. Apparently they weren’t only excited about flying, but by being in the mere presence of Harry Potter and his infamous Slytherin Death Eater enemy.
“You don’t know me Potter.”
Draco watched him out the corner of his eye, then moved slowly to lay beside Harry, pulling the doona up over them both.
Harry looked smug, smiling at the shocked look on the blond boy's face.
But Draco broke the kiss abruptly as he threw his head back, his eyes squeezed shut in pleasure.
Draco seemed to break away from his reverie as he turned to look down at Harry.
“FIGHT! FIGHT OUTSIDE! FIGHT!”
Slughorn’s large and pompous figure appeared a few meters away, waving him and Draco over to the table.
Harry threw his cloak on one of the desks, “That I’ve been seeing someone.”
“Mate? What was that?”
Draco gestured to the large armchair by the fire, that looked exactly the same as Harry’s except it was dark green.
“What about you two?” Harry smiled looking between the Slytherin’s.
“Your mum and dad. And Sirius. They’ll always be with you Harry.”
As the night continued, everyone was getting sloppy and sloppier.
“May as well ask you the same mate,” Ron said.
“I’ll talk to him toni- tomorrow!” Harry said quickly, undoubtedly knowing Hermione would’ve caught on to his misstep.
Harry suddenly felt nervous. So Draco had just done this as a favour, and nothing more. That thought, seemed as insane as the reality of this whole situation.
Harry had barely a second thought before he scrambled to his desk, placed a fresh piece of parchment in front of him, and dipped his quill in ink. His mind raced and his green eyes were blazing, then he bent over the parchment and began to write.
As the age old rivalry between Gryffindor and Slytherin had evidently been passed onto Harry and Draco seven years before, who took it upon themselves to be the new leaders for the infamous divide, surprisingly, their newly formed friendship seemed to be doing the most in regards to eliminating house segregation.
“So!” Blaise said loudly half way through dinner, causing everyone to look at him.
Draco flushed.
She rolled her eyes as the three drunken boys on the couch started laughing again.
Again, I feel mental writing to you all the time. I like to think I’m not very selfish, but there’s this nagging feeling inside me that wants you all to myself.
“Draco I want to,” Harry said clearly.
“What? It’s true Draco. You’d never shut up about him,” Pansy said.
“You’re barking? There’s no way the Malfoy’s would switch sides. Especially not for their son’s love interest.” Ron said.
Now delirious with pleasure, Harry gasped again as Draco moved his hand over Harry's that was gripping the bulge in his shorts. Draco moved even closer to Harry now, so he was leaning a little over him. He removed Harry’s hand and replaced it his own, rubbing gently against Harry’s erection. He continued to kiss down into Harry’s collar bones. Harry threw his head back once more and gripped Draco’s hair tightly with his hand.
Encouraged by this gesture, Draco began trailing kisses along Harry’s shoulder, nuzzling his head deep into Harry’s throat.
“Thanks Luna.”
Tiny giggles were escaping peoples lips as Harry looked back at McGonagall, mortified.
The decision was made for him. At that very moment, Draco turned in the opposite direction of his friends and stormed up the marble staircase, huffing and swearing as he went.
She practically waltzed out of the Great Hall, her trunk magically gliding beside her.
That was until Draco purposely bumped Harry with his shoulder, causing him to look up into Draco’s eyes.
Sighing, Draco said, “Of course I’d choose you Potter! Merlin, I’ve never played against Thomas or Finnigan, but I know your style like the back of my hand. I hope McGonagall and the rest of them realise this. Surely being two Seekers would heighten our chance.”
“Yes but pairing him with Harry?...Boy, the first years are in for a treat. Might end up watching a free wrestling match instead, might not even get to mount their brooms. What’s McGonagall playing at with this?”
“What are your friends doing?” Draco murmured into Harry’s skin.
“Even at eleven you already knew the good from the bad. And you were brave enough to stick up for your friends.”
“Draco you must be pretty good at this, I’ve never seen Ron get so worked up. He wins every time.”
For the first time in a very long time, Harry woke up feeling perfectly content. It was as though he was deeply rooted in the present moment, without any sense of dread that usually brewed in the back of his mind.
Harry laughed and Draco smiled at him, before returning his gaze to the fire.
Draco stilled and looked away.
Harry rubbed his forehead, suddenly vulnerable again.
We had our last Potions class for the term today. Slughorn wanted us in the Christmas spirit so we brewed Amortentia. You’ll never guess what mine smelt like ….
When they entered the warmth of the pub, Harry saw that the Weasley’s were mingling around the center of the pub, all with drinks in their hands and happy looks on their faces. Which happened to morph into utter shock at the sight of Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy standing flushed together in the doorway.
That seemed to seal the deal right then and there. Harry couldn’t possibly admit to that revelation. He needed to move before the mess they were in only got extremely and irreversibly messier.
Harry’s eyes widened.
Molly’s motherly voice spoke abruptly, “Right, well here we are.”
Ron looked smug, folding his arms. Hermione was smiling widely. Harry just shook his head, before adorning himself once more in the cloak, finally leaving the Gryffindor tower.
“Er- well,” The man cleared his throat, “I’m taking Mr Malfoy to the Ministry. His probation officer wants a word with him, he needs to check up on his progress here at Hogwarts.”
‘To Draco,
“Don’t,” Harry said.
“There’s more to it than that.” Hermione whispered back.
“Well, it is...still professor. You see… I wondered if I could get a job here, to teach.”
“Hey, you coming?”
“You shouldn’t have to get used to it.”
“Y-yes Harry.”
Draco reached up and wiped a stray curl away from Harry’s eyes as he stared fondly down at him, “...You’re beautiful Harry.”
Draco looked down toward it frowning, “I know, I have a feeling it’ll never come off. I’ve tried every spell I can think of,” He looked back at Harry, “Does it bother you?”
------------------
Harry found himself nodding profusely without seeming to realise what he was doing.
But once more, the decision was made for him.
“I have something for you.”
“Yes and that’s precisely why he shouldn’t be left unsupervised, look at the mess he’s dragged you two in over the years,” Hannah said, apparently to Ron and Hermione.
Harry knew that this was all of their sexual frustration that had built up over the past week finally getting released, and frankly, it felt fantastic.
Draco laughed, “You are mad Potter. Surely you know that by now.”
Harry could only scoff. He suddenly found himself longing for the day when Hermione made it into the Ministry, just so she could sort these feigned, pompous and insincere people out.
Draco was humming into their kiss, which was becoming sloppy as their breaths and moans drew more urgent.
He cleared his throat, “Draco and I...well...we’re sort of, together.”
Harry raised his eyebrows and shrugged his agreement.
“Draco, please don’t tell me you snuck Potter into your room back in the day?” Blaise said, his eyebrows raised.
“Shh Ronald.”
“He’ll have to do a lot more than say sorry. Empty words really. If he’s gonna earn my forgiveness it’ll be through action.” Ron said on the other side of Hermione.
“So then-” Draco interrupted her, “-We decided to do something special for you. I felt terrible Harry. I had no idea.”
Harry blanked.
McGongall left and all that could be heard was the ancient clanking of the door closing, and the soft crackling of the fire.
“Blaise. I will hex if you don’t shut your mouth.”
Draco looked at him sarcastically.
His face shone guilt, “I swear I was going to tell you sooner, I just...didn’t know what was happening. I was...I was trying to figure out how I really felt.”
“What about Defence Against the Dark Arts Harry?” Hermione asked.
“Right, I guess I’ll go first-”
Draco reached up and wiped a stray curl of hair out of Harry’s eyes. Harry leaned into the touch.
“Yeah Potter,” Draco’s slurring voice was raspy, “You’re so sexy when you’re drunk.”
Draco watched as Harry reached inside his robes, notably freezing on the spot with the idea that perhapsHarry was here to hex him while they were alone in the dark.
But the boy who stood beside the bed couldn’t suppress his grin. His arms were folded against his chest and he looked undeniably pleased with himself.
“Come on Ron, you’ve beat Harry three times already, I want to go to bed.” She fixed him with a knowing look and Harry looked away.
“No.”
--------------------------
“You’re late Potter.”
Ron laughed, “Nah Blaise…’Arry and I...We-” He started laughing uncontrollably, unable to finish his sentence.
“D-draco I’m so...ugh I’m so close,” He mumbled into his shoulder.
Draco was coming home today. Harry could barely suppress his excitement.
Within the next hour, Harry and Draco had cleaned themselves up and were now sitting up right against the headboard in Harry’s bed.
Somehow, seeming to know what Harry was thinking, George placed his hand upon Harry’s shoulder and forced him to look up.
Harry now sat at his dark wooden desk once more.
He sighed.
Draco giggled, pushing Harry back up against the shower wall and tilting his face to kiss him again.
Draco’s head fell back, his eyes closing, Harry bent to kiss his neck softly, but he kept his eyes open; he simply revelled in watching Draco come.
There was a pause. Harry and Dumbledore simply stared at each other.
Draco hummed a laugh, “You don’t have to worry about me Potter, I’m fine. It’s nothing I won’t get used to.”
Hermione, Ginny and Luna sat across from the boys. Hermione giving Ron a pointed, nasty look as she sat.
“Figures McGonagall would transfigure this tower into an almost identical replica of the Gryffindor common room.”
“Yes...And no. I think it was just easier for us to deal with your insults if we just told ourselves it was because you were jealous...Still, that didn’t ever stop me from fighting back.”
“Draco! Missed you my friend.”
As Harry approached, Dean called out.
Draco grumbled in frustration, turning away.
Draco smiled, “That doesn’t surprise me. You wear your heart on your sleeve.”
“Draco!”
Ron, suddenly insulted, looked at Hermione and chimed in loudly.
“Pansy that’s enough,” Harry choked out through his dry throat.
“Give it up Potter I won,” Draco underneath Harry.
Draco chuckled into Harry’s throat, kissing him once more just under his ear. His hand now leaving Harry’s pants to trace lines underneath the bottom of his shirt, along Harry’s hips.
“And I have a feeling he won’t be unsupervised.” Hermione said as Harry’s eyes widened, but determinedly kept his back to them.
Harry gripped his wand as if to stop the urge to jump up and leap with joy. Merlin, what was it about Draco Malfoy that just made him insane?
Ginny made a face at him and then said “Goodbye Mum.” She kissed her mother on the cheek then set off to find a compartment on the train with her friends.
Harry sighed, “OK, I’m only saying this because I know you won’t drop it until I do Hermione...But-” He swallowed, “Merlin...OK, I think I’ve got, you know, feelings for him. And that just can’t happen.”
A few of the first years looked at Harry as Draco began packing away the trunk.
Harry choked on his sandwich.
Draco chuckled, bringing Harry back to the moment.
“I wasn’t sure if you wanted to sleep together tonight.” Harry said quietly, “I thought you’d be too exhausted.”
Harry spluttered and split his tea half down himself, swearing. Draco actually laughed out loud this time.
He was a little early for their meeting when he arrived at her office. The moving spiral staircase filling him with sad nostalgia.
It only took Harry a few more ruts before he was coming himself, his head falling onto Draco’s shoulder again and his breaths ghosting Draco’s neck.
Harry carefully folded up the letter in his hands and placed it on the pile with all of the other letters Draco had sent him on his desk.
Harry, all too aware that the other eighth years had a habit of listening in on Harry, Ron and Hermione’s conversations, thought it more prudent to hold his tongue on the topic of Draco Malfoy’s return.
“Ron.” Hermione hissed, giving him a pointed look, then redirected her gaze to Harry with sympathy.
Ron pressed on, clearly noticing nothing.
Slowly and carefully, he removed his hand from Draco’s hip and rested it on the bulge in his boxers. Harry dug his head deeper into Draco’s chest so as to stifle the moan trying desperately to escape his lips. He slowly peeked up at the blond, so as to check he was still sleeping. Draco looked content and free as ever as he slept, and this only turned Harry on more.
Draco still gripped Harry’s waist tightly as he breathed into Harry’s neck, the hot water still pouring over their bodies.
“Yes Harry?” Hermione urged as his two best friends sat eagerly either side of him on the stone bench.
“What?” Harry and Ron spluttered in unison.
“Is that a problem? Them being straight?”
Harry hissed and swore.
Blaise shrugged then shared a knowing look with Pansy.
Their sleeping arrangement had become second nature. Sometimes when Draco would leave the common room to go to bed first, Harry would climb up the stairs a while later to find Draco sleeping peacefully in Harry’s bed. And sometimes, when Harry’s restlessness pursued him to take a midnight walk around the castle, after he returned to the eighth year tower, he would climb into Draco’s bed and snuggle up next to him, Draco softly running circles over Harry’s back with his palm. So, in short, they were sleeping in each other’s beds every night.
Harry laughed again.
Harry, Hermione, Draco and Blaise threw back their shots. When they looked to Luna, she simply said, “I’m not interested in relationships. I believe they call that asexuality.”
Then Harry was moaning loudly into Draco’s mouth as he came. He was grinding roughly against Draco, riding out his high. And not a second later was Draco biting down into Harry’s shoulder, trying to stifle his groaning as she shuddered in Harry’s arms.
“Merlin.” Draco muttered as he ran his hand through his hair looking at the table.
“Yes Harry?” Draco wiped a tear away from Harry’s cheek, cupping his jaw.
“What are you talking about?” Ron asked.
“How’s Ginny?” Harry asked quietly as he glanced at her.
His face was puzzled when he answered, “Um, yes. I did. Wow. I actually slept, and sitting up no less! Draco this idea was great!”
When they finally broke apart, Draco gently ran the back of his fingers along Harry’s cheek.
“Forget it Potter I’m not giving you that satisfaction.”
“That works for me. Who knows? Maybe we’ll find a second youngest Quidditch player in a century,” Draco smirked at him.
As Draco’s grip on Harry became tighter and his strokes began to speed up, Harry was panting, but Draco looked up at Harry in his lap and captured his lips once more.
“I’d like a word with Draco.”
Now it was Harry who was left unable to answer. He looked at Draco earnestly, as if the answer would appear across the blond’s attractive face.
“Yeah, about six years too late.”
Neville, Seamus, Dean, Luna, Ginny, Lavender, Parvati, Ernie and Hannah were already inside, sitting near each other but spread out between three tables.
Neville, Dean and Seamus burst out laughing, Hermione was giggling behind her newspaper.
“Yeah?” the blond still twirling his wand casually.
When Harry turned to see Draco staring at him from the doorway to the bathroom, Harry noticed something he was surprised he hadn’t noticed before since sleeping next to Drack; his Dark Mark.
Draco laughed, “That is true Potter.”
“Just Hermione and Ron, when we were on the run. We’d give each other one before we went to sleep.”
When they broke away from her Harry spoke, “Thank you Mrs Weasley, for having me over the summer.”
Then Draco was tangling his fingers into Harry’s hair again, pulling him for a fiery kiss.
Draco laughed, “Merlin Potter. I’m sure our gravitational pull will endure for a day.”
Draco hummed again, “It’s great Potter, don’t stop.”
Harry thought it better to be truthful, “No. Draco didn’t put me up to this. He just made me realise something that I perhaps knew but hadn’t figured out yet.”
Ron was taking a seat in between Hermione and Seamus. Harry quickly turned to grab more drinks for them, before joining the circle.
He said it so casually as if he was questioning Pansy’s sanity. Murmurs flew around the circle and Dean blushed but Seamus just returned to his drink.
Draco stalked past him, scanning the five beds in the dormitory, “Relax Potter. Weasley probably just assumed you’re coming up here for a wank. Which is partly true,” the blond chuckled, “but it also means we’ll be left alone.”
Harry was painfully hard now. With Draco’s arm so tightly wrapped around him, and his soft lips resting against Harry’s forehead. Draco was irresistibly beautiful. Damn him, Harry thought. This wasn’t fair and the tension built over the past week was really at his breaking point.
“Who cares!” Ron said hiccuping, “I love drunk Harry.”
“Oh never you mind.” Then Harry heard the squelch of a kiss assuming that Hermione had just pecked Ron on the cheek. At this, he reset his brisk pace out of the Great Hall and toward the eighth year common room, feeling once more, widely grateful for his friends.
Platform nine and three quarters was bustling with students and their parents hugging one another as the white smoke puffing from the train made its way through the crowd. As Harry made his way through the huddles of people alongside Ron, Ginny and Molly, eyes from all directions burned into him. Barely suppressed whispers floated into his ears as he passed.
Harry spluttered and laughed into his pumpkin juice, as Ron smirked at him.
Harry laughed, classic Ginny.
“Draco I-” But he was cut off by Draco’s hand suddenly holding his own, and squeezing it tightly.
feels in this one <3
Harry was already so turned on. They hadn’t even spoken yet but he found he wanted this more than anything in the world. He reached up and gripped Draco’s soft hair, bringing the blond’s head into Harry’s neck, motioning him to suck.
Before anyone could respond however, Blaise and Draco appeared standing beside them all at the ‘Gryffindor’s end of the table.
“Righto righto,” Ron said smiling as he broke away. “Anyway, it’s mum I reckon we should be worried about. Dad off at the Ministry and the rest of her sons out working…” he trailed off, “Yeah I reckon I will invite her and dad up to Hogsmeade, get her out of the house.”
At this, Pansy lowered herself and straddled Ernie, and started sucking mercilessly at his neck.
Draco.’
Draco was looking at him fondly yet directly, as if taking in every word Harry said into account.
“Alright my turn,” Blaise said. “Never have I ever gone further than foreplay.”
Harry exhaled, rolling his eyes, “Yes Blaise. I mean to say that I’ve never been a fan of the Ministry, and ever since the war ended, whenever I’d think about becoming an Auror...something just felt off. Then Draco helped me realise that Hogwarts has always been home for me, so why not get a job in the castle?”
Draco shifted back to sit up straighter against the headboard, then gripped just between Harry’s hip and arse, motioning the brunette to grind harder.
Draco captured Harry’s lips again and murmured into the kiss, “Come for me Harry.”
Blaise had scooted up the bench to sit with them.
“C’mon Ron, there’s just something really hot about Slytherin robes. And the way they all wear ‘em so well,” Harry hiccuped.
“Good news eighth years,” McGongall said loudly as she stood at the head of their table, “Mr. Malfoy will be returning this evening.”
The four of them walked further into the room.
All the Gryffindor’s eyes widened and raised their eyebrows.
“Yes. You were already famous, and to add, you could catch Snitches at the age of eleven. I’d been riding a broom for a year or so before I went to Hogwarts, and I still couldn't manage it.”
Harry grinned at him, “And you Hermione? Do you have as many books as Neville has plants?”
--------------------
Draco was silent for a moment, apparently thinking, before a mischievous grin broke out on his face.
“Harry did you really beat up Draco on the Quidditch pitch in your fifth year!”
She sniggered at him, “Hey Potter. Enjoying yourself are we?” She looked him up and down. The alcohol so deep in Harry’s bloodstream that he couldn’t even bring himself to feel insecure under her gaze. He suspected she was looking at an exceptionally dishevelled boy who had, at this point, lost all inhibitions as he stared contently at Draco.
“Going somewhere Harry?” Hermione asked.
“Cheat!” Draco yelled after him as he mounted his own broom and flew after Harry.
“You did that on purpose! You cowardly piece of-”
“I know… I know you’re here for me. I’m sorry. I-” Harry broke her gaze, suddenly nervous, “...I’ve been seeing someone, OK?”
“Is that, is that mine?”
Spurred on by Draco’s arousing sounds, Harry began to grind against Draco’s hips, feeling his growing erection in his pants and needing to find friction. He heard Draco choke out a moan at the pressure Harry had ground down into Draco.
----------
“Harry we love you!”
At this, the chatter and excitement broke again as they all made their way toward the staircases. Harry heard the distinct voice of Draco Malfoy muttering behind him.
Hermione looked concerned, “You’re sure the food and drink is digestible?”
His thoughts then began to drift to the dangerous and confusing topic of Draco Malfoy, now suddenly even more awake at the mere fact that the blond was just on the other side of the wall. So much for eradicating that gravitational pull Harry thought to himself, now he was forced to be closer to Draco than ever, and to make things more confusing, he found that he enjoyed the proximity.
Blaise waved his wand, conjuring six shot glasses, magically filling with Firewhisky.
Harry blanked, he and Draco hadn’t even talked about their plans for Christmas.
“Give me back my Snitch Draco,” Harry said clearly.
“What does it look like?” Draco’s seductive smirk didn’t waver.
Harry caught his eye and Draco smirked at him, and no sooner was Harry suddenly sobered.
Draco still looked as casual as ever, “Well yeah, I offered you my hand once, remember? You rejected me so I hated you, but I still wanted to be your friend… So I guess that’s love isn’t it?”
“I think I’d be more afraid to drink something from a Slytherin then whatever the Room has conjured up,” Neville said.
Draco looked even more attractive as his uniform was now as ruffled as Ron’s, his hair all messed up. Harry, inwardly wishing that he’d been the one to ruffle up his boyfriend’s hair and clothes.
Harry’s thrusts began to slow as he neared his release. Draco pulled on his hair again and the two reconnected in a clumsy kiss.
“Harry!” Ron’s loud voice forced Harry’s eyes to snap open. He jumped up, his wand already in his hand.
Harry swallowed.
“P-Potter,” Draco whispered.
“As do I,” came Lavender’s squeaky voice, “You two are cute together.”
“Figures only you’d be able to tell that the Golden boy’s gone missing,” Theo snickered.
“No, actually, we’ll leave you guys to it!” Draco said loudly, before he was stumbling to his feet and tugging on Harry’s tie, pulling him up.
A few moments later Harry found himself watching Seamus scramble through the common room door with a rolled piece of parchment in his hand.
A few of the other girls laughed in agreement. Harry’s eyes found Hermione, whose face shone a knowing smile.
Harry kept thrusting, seeking as much friction as he could. He began kissing Draco’s neck again as the blond groaned shamelessly into the echoey classroom.
“So when did you get back Draco?” Hermione asked.
There was Pansy, sitting right next to Hermione across from him. Blaise sat on Seamus’s otherside, Theo sat between Neville and Hannah, and finally, with another lurching feeling, sat Draco at the head of the table, only one seat away from Harry.
“I er, I’ve been thinking about what I’d like to do when I leave Hogwarts.”
Harry pulled back to look at him properly. Draco’s eyes were dark, sparkling slightly in the dimness of Harry’s bedroom.
“Merlin Draco I’m close-”
“Aren’t you going to Hogsmeade with them today?” Draco asked quietly.
When the blond’s head fell forward and became level with Harry’s, Draco’s eyes were darkened. Once more, Harry was intoxicated by his looks.
The three slumped onto the couch by the fire, their eyes unfocused and their laughs getting louder as they looked between the unruly state of themselves.
Harry stared at him, deluded.
“Harry.”
Draco turned to Harry once the couple were out of sight and grabbed his hand, “You’re definitely sleeping with me tonight.”
Draco, whose hand still lay on Harry’s neck, pulled the brunette into his chest. Harry snaked his arm around Draco’s waist, relishing in the warmth of Draco’s body that he’d missed so badly.
“No, not yet.”
“He’s from Fred and George’s year I think,” Ron said behind Harry.
“Potter,” came Pansy’s voice from somewhere in the distance.
Harry’s hips bucked at the touch. Draco smiled before carefully undoing his fly and reaching inside Harry’s boxers.
“Ugh, would you like to come in?”
Harry was oddly by the fire with Blaise.
My probation officer told McGonagall everything. She wasn’t happy and demanded that I’d be set free at once, and that if they dared put anything about what happened to me in the Prophet, they’d face the wrath of Kingsely and your Order lot.
When the eighth years had arrived at the Great Hall for breakfast, the four house tables, as well as the eighth year table had returned.
Harry suddenly felt himself grinning down at his plate, “Yeah, very good.”
Draco shifted uncomfortably but Harry settled him as he placed a palm over Draco’s hip, holding the blond in place.
“You’re joking?”
Their eyes locked. Harry's eyes; still fierce and determined.
“I’m fine,” Harry lied, not looking at him. He reached for his wand, but Draco had grabbed his own first, and gently waved a Warming charm over Harry.
“It's the terror of knowing what the world is about!
“Potter you’re welcome to come have some tea with me. Frankly I thought you’d still be down at dinner. Personally I couldn’t handle much noise tonight, I’m used to being on my own you see, being an only child. It always takes me a little to adjust to the commotion.”
“Don’t look at me like that, Harry’s in the same boat.”
Harry lay on his own bed, convincing himself that after such a long day, Draco would probably want to be alone when he finally got back to his room.
“Mmm.”
“Is this OK?” Harry asked.
With a final slight squeeze, Harry finally let go of Draco’s shoulder, and nodded, trying to convey some reassurance. The anxiety in Draco’s eyes seemed to fade, and the muscles in his jaw unclenched.
At this, Harry turned.
Blaise and Theo were laughing harder than ever.
Pray tomorrow gets me higher!
Harry didn’t need to be asked twice. He felt like he’d overdosed in Felix Felicis the way he was so uninhibited, ignoring Ron’s spluttering and walking confidently over to Draco, lowering himself and straddling his hips.
“That I love you Harry? Yeah, pretty much.”
Draco chuckled, his voice still low and raspy, “I missed you Harry.”
“Draco what position did you play?”
McGonagall wanted the remaining students to wear their robes for some ungodly reason, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to complain; seeing his platinum blond boyfriend clad in his black and emerald Slytherin robes had left him utterly flustered and aroused.
Harry didn’t know why he felt so upset. Yes, he was most definitely, unquestionably in love with Draco, but he had only just begun to notice his very real attachment to the boy.
“Yes. Don’t stop P-potter.”
Harry’s eyes fell shut at the contact. Draco’s lips were soft and warm.
She looked between them innocently, “Well...I knew it was a boy that Harry was seeing.”
As Blaise wiped his eyes, he said, “I wouldn’t put it past them. But who cares? We know the truth now. My God, wait till I tell Pansy!”
“My God Harry, that feels so good,” Draco breathed with his eyes closed.
They stared into each other's eyes.
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen them this drunk,” Neville said.
The next few days into their first week went by relatively well, relatively meaning that Ron’s wish of a laidback year was irreversibly squashed. Their workload was much much like fifth year, except NEWTS were even more complicated than OWLS. He realised that the eighth year's gift of a brand new tower and bedrooms wasn’t just a simple thanks for their services to the school, but perhaps McGonagall's attempt at compensation for their treacherous year ahead, filled with long hours in the library and a constant look out for Hermione, begging for her help.
“Merlin Draco, did you sleep in your clothes?”
Harry thought it better to go along with this lie, he didn’t fancy Draco thinking Harry was there to be his bodyguard, even if Harry rightfully knew that if anyone tried to hex him they’d better prepare themselves for the wrath of Harry’s wand.
“So were you.”
----------------------------
They both tried to outfly each other just as they had done years before. Sometimes Draco would feign a dive and Harry pursued him only to realise the Snitch was nowhere in sight. Then at one point they forgot they were pursuing the Snitch at all and just raced each other around the pitch.
Harry felt his stomach flip and it took all his effort just to keep from smiling. Sobered by these mere facts, he vowed to himself to sort out whatever this was he was feeling toward Draco, preferably to end it.
Ron sniggered, “Oi, I’d save those thoughts for the shower cubicle.”
Ron giggled, before Hermione, Draco and Blaise all took their shot.
“What if the others see me?”
Harry suddenly looked away and fumbled over his words. Draco giggled as he watched Harry struggle.
“Hang on,” Ron said, his mouth full of toast, “Teddy, as in Lupin and Tonks’ Teddy, as in, Harry’s godson Teddy?”
“I’m fine Ron,” Harry said sharply, now heading for the portrait hole.
The blond rested his hands on Harry’s hips, looking up at him seductively and Harry’s already painfully hard cock twitched.
Draco stared at the man a moment longer before lowering his wand.
“Yeah we helped!” Ron shouted as he stood, swaying lightly.
Harry couldn’t believe that he and his two best friends; the Golden Trio, were really sitting around a tiny table, sharing cake, and telling Draco Malfoy all about their stupid adventures they’d gotten up to over the years.
The bathroom had become foggy, obscuring their naked bodies, but Harry found comfort in it, it was as though it was just him and Draco in their own little world.
Harry still felt as though he had a long way to go until he fully healed, but he knew returning to Hogwarts would be the best place for him to deal with his anxieties, surrounded by those whom he loved so much.
“Nice shirt Harry,” Ron said, smirking.
---------
“I dunno, I just thought we could be friends,” Harry turned to look at him, “Obviously you know yourself best, but from an outsiders point of view, I know you’ve changed.”
They froze in each other’s tracks. But it had only taken a second for Draco to assume his arrogant smirk, crossing his arms smugly as he looked down at Harry from the upper steps.
Harry was in fact shivering.
Draco murmured into the kiss, “You smell like you’ve been swimming in a punch bowl.”
----------------------
Harry turned, and strode out the door. Knowing that if he stayed a second longer his boiling anger would really get the better of him and he’d probably hex Theo and Blaise into the hospital wing for a week.
Then Ron’s voice suddenly caught them from across the table.
Draco curled one arm around Harry’s waist, then dug his head into Harry’s neck, breathing in the brunette’s scent.
Draco moved then to reach up and stretch, yawning as he went.
“Ugh, if only I’d just asked McGonagall if I could go with him! I hate the thought of what they might be doing to him Hermione.”
Harry was sure he hadn’t heard him right.
Nevertheless, Harry had grown attached, and that scared slightly him more than his recurring dreams of cold black floors and oddly familiar passageways.
“Oh Merlin how I’ve waited for this day,” Blaise said, ignoring Draco who looked livid.
So then I was suddenly surrounded by Aurors and Ministry guards and the lot. They bound my wrists and took me to see my probation officer. He gave me an expected howling, lectured me about gratefulness and whatever. They kept me in a detainment cell overnight after they’d owled my Mother, who arrived the next day.
-----------------------------
“Uh Hem,” Pansy’s voice registered somewhere in Harry’s somewhat functioning brain. Harry and Draco suddenly stilled at her interruption.
Harry instantly felt their magic intertwine, immediately easing his anxiety. He squeezed Draco’s hand in response.
Harry watched him go before returning his eyes forward, suddenly faced with the mingled expressions of Ron and Hermione. Hermione’s face bared that familiar knowing expression that often unnerved Harry. But Ron’s eyebrows were high up somewhere on his forehead and his smile had formed a smirk, “Jumping on McGonagall’s bandwagon of house unity are we?”
Come home, I want to hold you.
“Draco?”
A few of them gasped and started whispering at the sight of the Gryffindor. Harry knew it would’ve been futile to put on his cloak, but now he deeply regretted it. He had, single handedly, just made this situation ten times worse.
“Pansy and Blaise seem to think you’ve had a thing for me for a while...”
Draco chuckled, “Merlin no, but you’re stiff as a broomstick.”
“What the bloody hell was that all about?” Ron said, apparently sober now.
“I dunno darling. Why don’t you go look for him yourself?” Pansy asked in a sweetly sarcastic tone.
Draco smiled knowingly, before Flitwick’s squeaky voice was suddenly echoing around the room telling them the class was over.
As the eighth years trudged through the snow alongside the younger year levels, Harry, Ron and Hermione wrapped their Gryffindor scarves around their faces as the cold winter wind whipped at their skin. Only their watery eyes could be seen peering through the falling snow.
“I’d like a word with blondie here if you don’t mind,” the man returned his fierce gaze to Draco.
“I thought you wanted to be an Auror?”
Harry reached around and tightly wrapped his arm Draco’s waist, as Draco rested his hand along Harry’s neck.
“Yeah, M’ fine Neville.”
But he’d grown used to the room’s eccentric taste, which was decorated in a dark academia aesthetic; silver serpents carved throughout the furniture, black feathered quills, velvet emerald pillows and a potent scent of leather, all combined to achieve a scornfully aristocratic and expensive look.
“That’s Harry Potter!”
“Have a biscuit Potter.”
That had Fred and George written all of it. Harry smiled sadly.
She smiled at him, “Have you heard about the new eighth year tower?”
As he applied more pressure to himself, cupping and gripping at his bulge under the bed covers, Harry thought he was already shamefully close. Draco’s simple proximity was enough to send him over the edge.
“But you...you beat him with this.” Draco looked at Harry now. “It answers to you.”
“Think there’s a little bit more to it than that,” Pansy said smirking and Blaise chuckled.
“Sorry.”
Harry had dealt with enough Ministry people to see through their false persona’s of kindness and generosity. He respected only Arthur Weasley and Kingsley. So as he looked at the overly dressed, bulky, top hatted man, practically springing in the doorway, he could only manage a small “Hi.”
Her knowing eyes seemed to expose every secret he kept in his mind and his own eyes scanned back and forth between hers nervously.
Watching some good friends screaming ‘let me out!’
They did as they were told, and said nothing else.
“True, but I know mum and dad would love to see you.”
“I think he might be,” Theo said, a mischievous smile on his face, “Got lost on his way back from dinner last night and happened to stumble right into Draco’s bed.”
After a few seconds, Draco stood up, picking up his book as he went.
Harry heard Draco shift behind him, the blond’s presence crowding him from behind. Draco dug his head into Harry’s neck, softly gracing his lips over the clenched muscles of Harry’s throat.
Harry heard Draco gasp a sound of disbelief and sit forward on the edge of the couch, turning his whole body toward Harry, “What?!”
Harry could only chuckle, “You don’t say?”
“So have you talked to McGonagall about this already?!”
“Blaise what the hell?!” Draco snarled.
Harry gripped his forehead, trying to digest all of this.
When he made it down to the Great Hall for breakfast, (purely by memory as his head was still spinning and this thoroughly disturbed his vision), he slowly made his way up to the eighth year table, still desperately clutching his head.
As they approached McGonagall, now puffing slightly, Harry saw the all too familiar cold stone face of the Headmistress.
It suddenly clicked. The two unlikely friends’ cheeks were pink, their eyes dark, and they happened to be leaning upon the wall so as to just keep themselves upright.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, you can...You can see them?”
They both had O.W.L’s to study for, and Quidditch practise, Draco had prefect obligations, and Harry had distressing Occlumency lessons, not to mention his increasing run-ins with Umbridge, as well as his constant dreams about darkened passageways and mysterious wooden doors. In short; Harry and Draco’s secret fling had occurred at the worst of times… If it was even to occur at all.
“Maybe if I went with you tomorrow people won’t treat you so badly,” Harry murmured as he touched Draco’s chest gently.
Harry somehow managed to make his way over to the blond, stumbling a little on his way over.
Draco was positively shaking. Harry had held his gloved hand the whole walk to Hogsmeade.
“W-what?”
I now realise how my Mother feels living in this huge house by herself. It’s much too big. I think we might sell it and live somewhere small in the countryside.
Her face was suddenly beaming.
“Oh Harry!” Hermione said as she flung herself around him.
Harry and Hermione glanced at her before lowering their voices.
“Well, I like Quidditch don’t I?”
Breathy moans sounded beside Harry’s ear as Draco rode out his high, and only a moment later, Harry was coming too; bucking his hips and gripping Draco’s blond waves tightly as he moaned out Draco’s name.
His ruts become more urgent and clumsy, the two of them seeking as much friction as they possibly could, but also prolonging their release because they didn’t want this moment to end.
And with that Hermione kissed Harry on the cheek then walked confidently up the stairs, out of sight.
The Golden Trio turned.
Hermione blushed a little, “Well, we’re paired together for Charms. We couldn’t just keep acting like either of us didn’t exist.”
Anyway, I just hope you’re OK. And I hope your mother’s OK too. I’m glad you wrote to me.
“They’re not staring at you,” Ron sneered.
Harry sighed into his pillow face down, “Where’re you going?” His voice was muffled.
“We might ask you the same question Malfoy,” Lavender giggled.
“What?!” Hermione and Ron said in unison. Hermione beamed. Ron came to join them at the door, looking at Harry, aghast.
Draco motioned to get under the covers. As they rested their heads on the pillows, Draco graced his thumb across Harry’s cheek bone, then brought his hand to cup Harry’s neck.
Harry giggled as he hopped off his lap and threw Draco’s Slytherin T-shirt back over himself, “Can’t complain though.”
When Harry reached its entrance, he disdainfully muttered ‘morsmordre,’ then found himself in the midst of the dimly lit, black and emerald Slytherin common room. The tall windows filled with a dark green tinge from the lake. Harry still ogled at how the Slytherin’s never felt claustrophobic so immersed in the depths of Hogwarts, with the occasional glint of movement fluttering past the ancient glass.
“Merlin green looks good on you,” Draco said as his eyes scanned Harry’s middle.
Draco chuckled into his skin, before he actually kissed Harry full on the neck. His warm and wet lips inciting a new and absurdly pleasurable sensation.
Draco raised his eyebrows slightly, “Then why are you here?”
Ron had appeared suddenly at Hermione’s side, looking aghast between herself and Draco. After a moment, he resolved to say, “Well, you know Hermione, now that we don’t have a war to fight I plan to read that one, I hear it’s most illuminating-”
Harry shivered, his breath and sobs slowly easing.
Harry simply shrugged smiling. He really didn’t know why he was getting himself so plastered but he was having so much fun that he didn’t care.
“Does, Inter-House unity ring a bell?” She asked looking at Ron sarcastically.
Draco actually laughed now, “Definitely Harry.”
Harry wanted to hear that rasping voice a thousand times over. The fact that Draco had moaned his name as he came on top of him was easily the hottest thing he’d ever experienced. His lower abdomen was swimming again in arousal.
Harry felt a tingle of excitement run down his spine as he realised that he wanted this. He wanted the chaos, the contradiction, the complexity, the fire. Those were the things that always had a way of seeping into Harry’s life, so why not share it with someone who he not only fancied and fell in love with, but with someone who knew what it was like to live amongst chaos and intensity.
Neville looked on the verge of a panic attack, biting back his lower lip, “Uh...dare.”
Hermione smiled and shook her head. Draco looked at him, a kind of ‘are you serious?’ look adorning his face.
“Uh, sure.” Harry said as he cottoned on to the goodness this offer possessed.
On the bottom half of the parchment, Harry saw the list of subjects being offered. He scanned the list quickly looking for Quidditch. When he found it, he saw that three names had already been scribbled down below it’s title; Seamus, Dean and Draco. Suddenly excited at this revelation, that there was a one in three chance that it would be himself and Draco that would teach Quidditch together, Harry dived for the pen stuck to the noticeboard and scribbled his name below Draco’s.
Draco looked back at Harry, “It’s OK Potter, there are natural remedies that can help nightmares too.”
Harry laughed.
“Well that explains Potter’s ridiculously grinning all morning,” Pansy muttered. The other eighth years giggled and Ron just shook his head smiling at Harry. McGonagall however, had appeared not to have heard.
Draco was now stroking Harry in time with his grind’s. The blond was breathing fast into Harry’s neck and Harry brought up his hand, reaching behind him to roughly grip into Draco’s wet hair.
“Doesn’t matter. It still called to you.”
Draco interrupted him. Harry simply stared.
“So I noticed you put your name down for Quidditch mentor,” Harry said.
“Where’ve you been?!” Hermione hissed at him.
More clapping and cheers ensued around the table, mostly from the teachers. Harry noticed that the other students at both ends of the table looked merely astonished at the fact that they were sharing a table with most of the staff, not to mention the eighth years.
Harry sighed, “Draco, I have bad dreams. I don’t think you’ll get much sleep beside me.”
Harry felt Luna’s soft words wash over him, the war is over. Once more, that immense wave of relief washed over him and he could only chuckle at Luna’s eccentric words.
“The more I think about it, the more I’m like, how in the name of Merlin’s saggy left tit did I not see it in the first place?”
“Blimey ‘Arry, you’re really going for it tonight,” Seamus laughed as he watched Harry swallow another shot of Firewhisky.
“I know." Harry cut him off, not wanting to hear the truth.
“Hey everyone!” Ron said happily, only to see Arthur and Bill draw their wands. Draco flinched under Ron’s arm, to which Ron gripped even tighter and spoke louder, “Oi! This bloke happens to be my friend! Harry and Hermione’s friend as well! So I’d appreciate it if you lowered your wands.”
Although it’s warm inside the castle, I prefer the warmth of your body. The heat of your chest against my own. The comfort of your head nestled in my neck.
Draco nuzzled into Harry’s throat more intensely now, kissing and sucking in any place he could reach. At the sound of his name, Draco gripped Harry’s shirt and murmured just below Harry’s ear.
“He owled me last week to say they’re just adding the finishing touches. Maybe that’s why we got given a chance to visit the village, ‘coz they know George’s shop’ll be read- Oi! You sneaky little git!”
Draco looked at Hermione tentatively, “Uh yes they are.”
Harry squeezed his eyes shut in frustration. After a few surreal minutes, the eighth year table was left only to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Blaise.
“Not as bad these days, but sometimes the heat of the moment gets the better of her. I can’t talk though,” Draco chuckled as he stared at the lake, “I was so much worse than she was. Any chance I got to humiliate someone, I’d take it. And not just you Potter, I’m talking people in my own house.”
Harry emerged, invisible, but curiously surprised at the way Draco continued to look back in Ron, Hermione and Neville’s direction. It was almost as if the boy was stalling, hanging at the back of his Slytherin gang, almost daring Harry to appear out of nowhere.
The brunette chuckled, “Yeah. The sorting hat told me I’d do well in Slytherin.”
Harry quickly bounced out of bed, throwing a random hoodie over himself, pulling on a dirty pair of pants, and followed Draco out through the door.
“Mmm,” Draco lifted his head. He ran his thumb along Harry’s cheek bone, admiring the glowing look on the brunette's face, “You’re so handsome Harry.”
Harry fell asleep peacefully with Draco’s arms around his waist and his blond head nuzzled into Harry’s neck.
“So...So maybe you’d like to come by the manor one day?”
“Pity McGonagall wasn’t here to see this!” Seamus said loudly.
“So basically you want to get drunk for Christmas,” Luna said.
Ron and Hermione were chatting animatedly about their upcoming Christmas in Hogsmeade with the rest of the Weasley’s.
“I’m going to bed. Night Luna, Harry, Hermione.”
He gripped Draco’s collar as they continued to kiss deeply, Draco once more cupping Harry’s neck.
You’re not going mental. You’ve got no idea how much it turns me on to hear you’re wearing my clothes and sleeping in my bed. As for the crimson rug...perhaps my bedroom thinks there’s a place for a certain Gryffindor in my life?
“So, you didn’t answer my question...Why are you out here?”
“I guess that means you did too?”
They all laughed again. Harry, once more thrilled to be at Hogwarts during Christmas.
Harry sped off to catch him. He came up beside Draco and reached out his arm. The Snitch had then abruptly sped downwards towards the grass. The two boys followed suit, almost flying vertically downwards.
Draco smiled and brushed a strand of hair away from Harry’s eyes again.
But nonetheless, Harry lied on his back, eyes open facing the ceiling, certain that he wouldn’t fall asleep until he heard Draco come up the stairs.
After a moment, he began to giggle and then he looked back into Draco’s eyes.
“Yep. Better believe it, Potty’s in our bedroom,” Blaise laughed, and Theo laughed too.
“We figure that should get us some drinks, whatever they might be.” Seamus smirked.
At this, Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and began pulling him toward the dormitories. Before Harry could contemplate what was happening, he doused himself in his cloak and followed along in Draco’s wake.
Harry tripped in surprised, and the cloak was pulled to the right, revealing his head and shoulders.
The first day of school was pleasant enough. Harry kept thinking back to the way he’d told Draco he’d be seeing him later on only to realise how stupid he sounded considering they ate their breakfast, lunch and shared all of their classes that day, together. Nevertheless, Draco was polite to him whenever they passed each other in the halls. He had kept to his own Slytherin friends, but Harry had to remind himself that this was literally day one and to expect things to happen, whatever those things were, he needed to be patient with Draco.
The six of them sat in a circle on the rug by the common room fire. It was a hysterical sight, as they all still adorned their Hogwarts uniforms.
All of the first years stood around Draco in a close, huddled circle as the blond was sitting on his knees on the grass next to a trunk that harboured all the Quidditch balls.
To add to Harry's potent mixture of emotions swimming in his stomach, he now felt relief. But no sooner had the relief swept through him, was he suddenly up on his feet and storming across the room ready to shout out his anger at an innocent Hermione.
Draco’s voice nearly knocked Harry off his feet. The blond still kept his eyes on his book.
As Draco sat down beside Harry, he reached out and pulled Harry’s right hand toward him. Harry watched as grey eyes swept over the white scarring that faintly spelt, “I must not tell lies.”
Ron snorted, “Fair enough.”
“I do. Unfortunately.”
Draco then began to stroke him, slowly at first. Harry couldn't remember a time when he’d ever felt so good.
Harry couldn’t stand it any longer. Every eighth year was listening in with wide eyes like it was some intense reality TV show the Dursley’s used to watch back in Privet Drive.
Harry shrugged once more, “Yeah but you’d be bored with anyone but me, admit it.”
“Only joking Ronald!” And she intertwined their fingers and kissed him on the cheek before the four of them made their way down to the Great Hall.
“It’s great anyhow,” Hermione continued. “It gives us free reign for self-expression! Now we can transfigure our room into the way we want it. I also know that there will be an eighth year’s table added to the Great Hall, and it’ll sit between the staff table and the four house tables. I guess this is all to do with the advocacy of house unity and I’m sure McGonagall wants all of the eighth years to be sort of role models for the rest of the school.”
“But we can’t-”
Draco chuckled, “I don’t know, I can’t become a teacher straight out of Hogwarts, but maybe get an internship in Potions, or Healing.”
Harry dug his face deeper into Draco’s chest and wrapped his arms around his waist, trying desperately to slow his breathing.
“H-Harry you’re,” Draco cleared his throat, “You’re drunk. We c-can’t.”
“Harry.”
Draco’s grey eyes sparkled as they bore into Harry. Then he brought his hand down from Harry’s hair to his neck, and pulled him in for a kiss.
Harry didn’t have it in himself to pretend he was fine. Instead he squeezed his eyes shut, brought his knees up to his chest and covered his eyes with his palms. He had heard faint footsteps beside him and after a second, he felt Draco’s warm hand close on his shoulder, then slowly run along his arm to tear one of Harry’s hands away from his eyes.
“What?!” The boys said together.
“Draco’s coming back tonight,” He said truthfully, admitting that no one could possibly fool her.
OK, so Harry wasn’t dreaming and this really did just happen and he really, really enjoyed it. Merlin, why do girls have to know everything?
“I’m sorry am I missing something?” Harry asked, suddenly finding his voice. “You all act as though you know something I know nothing about-”
“And how exactly do you know what the Gryffindor common room looks like Malfoy?” a slight, all too familiar smirk that he reserved for Draco only, creeping onto his face.
Harry shook his head fondly.
Harry was so lost in the moment. So lost to Draco’s sounds of pleasure escaping his lips. So lost that he couldn’t even acknowledge he’d never done anything like this with another boy. The heat of the moment was so strong that he merely just went with it, and he found that it all felt so natural.
Harry sat back and pondered this new revelation. He wasn’t sure how he felt about not returning to Gryffindor tower, but he supposed the beds would be bigger if they got their own room.
“Mmm,” Draco murmured. And Harry felt a surge of confidence and arousal. He dug deeper into Malfoy’s neck and shoulders, purposely gracing his fingers along the soft blond hair at Draco’s nape, resisting the humongous urge to run his hands through it.
As Harry dug his head into Draco’s neck, he spoke through broken sobs, “I,” he sniffed, “I could’ve grown up with my mum and dad, and...and Sirius,” Harry choked on his breath again, “But they all, they all d-died, and I was left with...with them!”
“Still, I’m very happy for you Harry, I’ve always admired you.”
“Merlin Potter you do that a lot.”
Harry quickened his pace, heading toward the beech tree. Draco looked entirely absorbed by the book in front of him and Harry considered that the Slytherin most likely came out here for peace and alone time. But there was that gravitational pull again, and Harry felt himself unable to stop his feet getting nearer and nearer toward the blond.
“Blaise will you stop encouraging him!” Hermione demanded.
“That is all from me,” McGonagall headed for the door of the common room before she turned to look back at them, “Try to get some sleep. Although the prospect of this year may seem as though you are here to simply study and unwind, the passing of time between injury and recovery can be treacherous. You have all been hurt by the war and one simply doesn’t heal quickly from such trauma. You know that you have the support from myself and the staff, but the most crucial support will come from amongst yourselves. Aid one another in times of need. Goodnight.”
Harry ran his fingers along the blond’s sharp jaw.
Oh Merlin how Harry had missed this.
They stared at each other once more, and then Draco wrapped his arm around Harry’s middle bringing their bodies flush together. Harry’s hand glided up Draco’s bare, toned stomach, up over his chest to rest on the boy’s neck. Harry nuzzled his head into the blond’s throat and kissed his soft skin tenderly. As their bodies lay closely intertwined, Harry could feel Draco’s still hardened member against his own, their bodies still waiting for release after hours of build up and teasing.
Harry swore as he stood.
“Harry,” Draco said, finally looking at him. “You said you had scars from the past seventeen years?”
There was silence as the five eighth years and Luna ate their breakfast, before Hermione spoke once more.
“That’s enough!” Yelled Madam Rosmerta. “Clear out! All of you!”
When they finally reached their table- Harry squeezing in between Neville and Hermione, Draco in between Theo and Blaise- McGonagall spoke, “Thank you for joining us, Potter, Malfoy.” She nodded at them and smiled, “Everyone, please return to the feast.” Harry’s fellow eighth years looked between him and Draco, their faces as confunded as the rest of the students behind him. Slowly the chatter returned to full volume and Harry began to fill his plate with everything in sight.
“Uh! Blimey, I’m staying in here for the rest of the afternoon,” Ron said as he pulled his scarf down from his face.
He looked at Harry then but Harry averted his gaze. Laughing feebly, he said, “Um yeah I guess the castle is still learning about us. Er, I’ll just get your sweater.”
“Draco you feel so good,” Harry croaked.
Harry had to run a little to keep up with the blond’s furious pace, his black and emerald robes billowing behind him as he climbed higher and higher up into the castle.
They sat side by side on the leather couch, Harry had his hand gripped to Draco’s thigh as he kissed tenderly along Draco’s neck. The blond’s head rested back on the couch, giving Harry more access as he ran his hand up beneath Harry’s T-shirt, caressing the brunette’s toned stomach.
Harry could only laugh, “Of course they are.”
Of course, the four of them weren’t inseparable. Draco still spent a lot of his time with Pansy, Blaise and Theo.
Harry continued to stroke Draco, feeling the blond’s leaking tip between his fingers.
This, Harry thought, was a Slytherin at work. Pansy, so enthralled by the humiliation she was inflicting upon not only Harry, but Draco; the boy whom she’d been best friends with for seven years, who, Harry noted, looked utterly terrified.
“Earth to Harry?”
Harry felt the ebb and flow of their magic intertwining, its power even stronger than before now that they had declared their love for each other.
And then some uninhibited children pointing plainly at him. Loudly expressing their thoughts as their parents try to hush them behind their cloaks.
The figure adorned a familiar emerald, oversized sweater, expensive black trousers, and its head was coated in Harry’s undeniable favourite colour; platinum blond. It was Draco.
“You’re late again,” Draco drawled as he sat on the teacher's desk.
Harry hummed in agreement, his green eyes wide and dark.
“Undress me Harry.”
“You don’t mean to say you’ve forgiven him Harry?” Neville asked.
“I’ll miss you tomorrow.”
“I’m in love with you Draco.”
“Harry will you sign my robes!”
“Wooahh, OK. So we're in that mood tonight…  Alright I get it.”
Then Draco was growling eagerly into Harry’s shoulder, biting down on his skin, his grinding becoming erratic and Harry knew he was as close to climax as he was.
Harry couldn’t look at him. He was just grateful the room was dimly lit so that Draco couldn’t detect the fear splattered across his face.
A rush of gratitude swelled in his chest. He took her hand and squeezed it, “Thank you Ginny.”
I’m jealous that you’re getting to spend so much time with my godson :) But I’m glad that your mum and Andromeda are reconnecting. Maybe we can babysit Teddy together sometime?
Most of the time however, Draco and Hermione were studying together in the library ever since they became project partners in their Ancient Runes class, but the sight of the two of them; huddled over a desk scribbling down notes and exchanging ideas that sounded to Harry like they were speaking a different language, warmed his heart nonetheless.
“Yes,” Harry replied honestly, “I thought about that a lot actually.”
Harry’s insides burned and he tried to ignore the fact that this was jealousy he was feeling.
“OK, OK. I get it Harry. But you can’t just stalk up to the pitch on Saturday with no game plan.”
Ron smirked, “Make out with Hannah.”
“Hello Harry Potter. Thank you for inviting me Hermione.”
Harry could feel the other Gryffindors a few metres away glancing up to the three of them.
As Harry began to stroke slowly, he nuzzled his head back into Draco’s neck, sucking softly.
Harry and Draco piled their plates with food, only just realising how hungry they both were due to the certain activities they’d engaged in in the past twelve hours.
“Right.”
And then his two best friends got to their feet. Ron squeezing his shoulder lightly as he passed, before they left the Great Hall, leaving Harry alone at the eighth year table, utterly speechless.
Harry studied Draco’s face again, “But not anymore right?”
Just as he was feeling like he was going to throw up, Harry felt that familiar softness and warmth take this hand.
Harry’s heart fluttered in admiration and excitement. He propped himself up on his elbow.
“Yeah, right,” Harry said harshly, clear sarcasm in his voice, “Like you’d want anyone to find out… I’d pay to see the look on old Lucius’s face.”
Follow my new drarry instagram acc @drarryworks I need drarry friends <3
Harry shifted closer and nuzzled his head into Draco’s neck, kissing it gently.
As Harry sat across from them, his back facing determinedly toward the Slytherins, Ron spoke at once.
He turned and the three best friends followed him as he gave them a grand tour of his beaming new joke shop.
Their homework seemed to double at each passing week. The spells; more complicated, the potions; more intricate, the incantations; more advanced, and the textbooks; more complex. Harry began to realise what it felt like to be Hermione simply by being in the library nearly everyday.
“I’d love to have tea with you.”
“It is not your fault!” Harry looked at Draco fiercely. “That tosser provoked you!”
“HERE AT ONCE!”
As Harry chewed on his salad sandwich, he asked, “So, I guess we won’t have to worry about getting food or drinks. The room would do that for us.”
“U-ugh,” Harry moaned, “I really am living out my fantasy.”
You are expected to develop an hourly long class that aims to equip students with the necessary abilities to thrive in the said subject. This responsibility is to be taken seriously, do not abuse this privilege if and once you have decided to sign up.'
They all laughed.
“Oi! Theo, check this out.”
“It’s still early.”
“Mmm, you’re so hot,” Draco began a trail of kisses up Harry’s chest to his neck. Harry groaned, his head falling forwards onto Draco’s shoulder.
Draco put his hands in the pockets of his robes and he turned to stand beside Harry.
“Wulfric,” Harry muttered to the fat lady.
“OK,” Harry continued loudly, “Now put out your hand, look down at your broom and say ‘up!’”
Harry took his seat on Draco’s otherside, and Blaise sat beside Harry.
“I played Seeker.” Draco said kindly as he played with the Snitch.
Harry moved up beside Ron and Draco and placed his hand on Draco’s shoulder, “Yeah Mr Weasley, it’s alright, we’re friends.”
“Merlin you Gryffindor’s are something else. I truly wonder if the lot of you have any self-restraint at all,” Blaise said smiling at Parvati.
He returned the smile.
It couldn't be.
But Harry still hadn’t openly admitted that he and Draco were practically together, which seemed stupid considering they were certainly acting that way.
Harry, dreadfully aware of the faces still staring at him looked back down at his plate.
The next morning, it was Christmas. The eighth year’s presents didn’t appear in their rooms however, but in their common room instead.
“Cheer up Malfoy! How about this,” Ron started as they neared the Three Broomsticks, “You and I will walk in together, and I’ll introduce you to mum and dad and everyone, saying you’re my new friend. Which you are anyway!”
The sight of Draco, his hands effortlessly shoved in his pockets, his Slytherin robe deserted to reveal his Slytherin sweater vest and white shirt, laughing casually with Ron and Blaise, turned Harry on no end.
“Merlin he was fine,” Blaise said looking upwards, clearly picturing Remus in his mind.
I haven’t slept much either. I miss your touch.
“You guys are so beautiful. Hermione that dress looks so great on you, Ron is so lucky isn’t he? Draco did I ever tell you how much I love the colour of your hair? It’s just like, you know, it’s like, so blond! You really are-” Harry hiccuped again, “-so handsome.”
Harry could only happily oblige. He continued to rub the blond all over his shoulders, neck and back, continually touching his hair at segmented moments. And between it all, soft hums and moans escaping Draco’s lips as Harry carefully tore at the knots in his back. Before long, Harry felt Draco become a dead weight and his body was suddenly falling back into Harry’s chest. Overwhelmed by this sudden clash of body contact, Harry felt both his heart and mind racing, knowing how touch deprived he was and if he didn’t nudge Draco, he may very well do something he’ll regret.
Draco simply shrugged, smiling slightly, “Yeah, but I also feel very good, so I guess it balances out.”
Now it was Thursday morning, and Harry was in the common room with Ron waiting for Hermione. Only fifteen minutes ago had Harry woken up once more in Draco’s bed, the blond’s intoxicating scent circling around him, their bodies much too close for Harry not to think absurd thoughts about what he’d like to do with Draco. Their fingers overlapping one another and Draco’s head leaning into Harry’s chest. Merlin if he didn’t stop thinking about it he would have to deal with the recurring tightness in his pants all day long, it was enough that he had to disengage from Draco only moments before and hurry off to his room for a cold shower.
They moved so that they were both properly sitting on the bed. Draco ran his hand through Harry’s hair and pulled his head back so as to look at him properly.
“Oi! My name-” Ron hiccuped, “-Isn't Weasley...It’s Roonil Wazlib.”
Harry was running out the door before his mind had even caught up with what he was doing, Ron and Hermione following in his wake. Everywhere around the pub people were getting out of their seats to see what was happening outside.
Harry was hard now, and he could feel the pulse of Draco’s cock through his trousers as the blond began to rut gently against Harry, seeking friction.
Harry felt a flush of anger in his chest.
“You know, when we do try…” Draco gestured between them, “... this… It’s all gonna crash and burn.”
The two performed an interesting little handshake one might see on Muggle movies before they all sat down.
“Oh. So he isn’t so oblivious after all,” Pansy said crossing her arms and smirking at Harry.
“And you’re an excellent flyer Harry. You could always coach Quidditch here.”
“You have no idea how much I missed this.”
Harry felt his eyes sting before he threw himself into Draco’s arms. He felt ashamed at his vulnerability, but also so elated against the warmth and scent of Draco’s body.
When he broke away, his hand came down to grip Harry’s arse. Then he lowered his head to whisper in Harry’s ear.
And just as Draco’s tongue had entered Harry’s mouth and the blond was humming approvingly, did he break away, leaving Harry totally bewildered for the second time in a few minutes.
“Shut up Malfoy.”
Harry looked down the table toward him. Draco had a book in one hand and a fork in the other, apparently absorbed in his book and ignoring the banter between his friends. As Harry began to feel excited at the prospect of what tonight might bring, his eyes bore into Draco as he watched the blond suddenly rise from his seat, close his book, nod at his friends, and then depart from the Great Hall.
--------------------------
Harry groaned loudly.
Harry met Draco in the Entrance Hall at eleven o’clock.
“Ugh great, more responsibilities. I thought we were coming back for relaxation,” Ron said.
His emerald eyes blazed onto the man in front of him. Harry wanted to attack him. For every insult, every annoyance, every orgasm he’d ever ignited in Harry. But he still sat on that annoying position between go and stop… but at last, Harry conceded that if he was going to attack Draco, he’d do it the sexual way.
“Well...he plays Seeker doesn’t he?” Hermione said.
“Still, it didn’t make it any easier. I was so jealous of you and your friends.”
Harry felt himself relax again. Blimey Draco really does have me wrapped around his finger.
He ran the back of his fingers down Harry’s cheek, so as to wipe away more tears and once again, Harry was leaning into the touch.
Blaise raised his eyebrows as he studied Draco, “You look a little flushed Draco… Don’t tell me you’ve been fooling around with that bloke from Ravenclaw?”
“Draco, how can I be honest with you, when this whole thing we have going on… is based off secrecy and lies?”
Hermione’s face suddenly became full of pride, “Oh Harry!” She wrapped her arms around him tightly. “That was very mature of you.”
Although he battled with nightmares and the occasional panic attack, he felt relatively unburdened by the war, especially when he found himself in moments such as this. Alongside his best friends, and heading towards the one place he felt truly at home. He often had to revert back to the indescribable sensation of relief he felt in the moment he actually killed Voldemort. It seemed to ground him. Once he was grounded, he could list all of the things he was grateful for, just as Hermione had told him to do whenever he felt overwhelmed.
At one point during their walk, Harry’s eyes gazed out onto the vast expanse of ice that had coated the lake’s surface, absentmindedly wondering if the Giant Squid would be feeling claustrophobic in the depths below,  just as he had once felt in that icy lake in the Forest of Dean a million years ago.
“There wasn’t anything you could’ve done Harry, It’s happened-”
“Harry can do whatever he wants in his own time,” Hermione said pointedly.
Draco’s mouth fell open looking betrayed.
Harry gripped onto Draco’s robes, groaning in the darkness of the corridor.
As Harry’s breath began to slow, he began trailing soft kisses along Draco’s shoulder.
The next few weeks saw Harry and Draco become closer than ever, and much to Harry’s delight, Draco and Ron were slowly starting to get along as well.
Simply knowing that Draco was babysitting Harry’s godson left Harry in such a state of lightheaded happiness, he honestly thought he might drift away to heaven.
“You!” Harry shouted, until he properly heard what she said, “Y-You what?” Harry looked perplexed.
McGonagall, Hagrid, Slughorn, Flitwick, Sprout, Trelawny, Madam Pomfrey, Madam Pince, as well as fifteen other students were mingling around the table, all with glasses of wine or butterbeer in their hands.
“How did I not notice this? The other night when you got back to the castle?” Harry asked.
Draco had a fond expression on his face as he looked between Harry and Ron, and Harry found his heart fluttering at the sight.
Harry saw a glint in Draco’s eye, and it took all his effort not to reach out and kiss him senseless.
“Am I right in assuming you’ve never combed your hair a day in your life?” Draco chuckled.
Ever since the end of the war, Harry tried to be as present as possible, reminding himself that the past was the past and the future didn’t harbour any prospects of defeating Dark Lords, so he took another shot from Seamus and readily resolved to get drunk.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco stilled, then turned to face Harry, his pale expression contorted with disdain, but also showing a glint of a smirk.
Harry shifted uncomfortably in his seat, Hermione noticed, as she always did, “Of course, you have every reason not to Harry.” She said with a sorry look on her face.”
“The other eighth years seem to think there’s something going on between us.”
“I...I can’t tell you sorry-”
“Oh gosh don’t remind me of the weekends Slytherin played Gryffindor, I don’t think Draco went one minute without mentioning Potter’s name whenever we’d be leading up to a game.”
“Er- Draco?”
Draco nodded before looking out at the lake. Harry studied his features before he spoke again.
Draco winked at him. And then he was walking out the door leaving Harry utterly speechless.
“I’m spectacular thank you Harry Potter.” She reached into her purple and sparkling pouch by her side and pulled out her spectrespecs. She put them on and fixed her gaze on Harry.
Harry’s eyes were dark and wide, and all Draco did was stare at him smugly, his lips slightly pink and his cheeks flushed.
Draco’s face returned to its smirk, “I think we were a little preoccupied that night Harry.”
Harry looked into Draco’s grey eyes. They looked exhausted. Harry took Draco’s hand away from his cheek and softly kissed his palm.
Hermione rolled her eyes and Harry looked sheepish. But Harry couldn’t be more thankful for Hermione’s presence, as she cottoned onto Harry’s look of hesitance.
When Harry begrudgingly entered the Great Hall for breakfast, antagonising shouts, pointing of fingers, overbearing laughter, cringeworthy whistles, and loud mocking and taunting drifted to him from all sides, most especially from the Slytherin table.
“I get it Harry...All the uncertainty you’ve known…. Loved ones lost and people you thought you knew, turning their back on you... But listen to me, I promise I won’t.” His grey eyes blazed, “I won’t ever leave you and I won’t ever hurt you.”
Harry’s heart hurt at this revelation.
“Wait!” Theo said, his eyes wide, “What if Potter’s been in here before, and we never realised it till now?!”
“Potter!”
When he’d returned to the common room with Ron and Hermione in the afternoon between classes finishing and dinner starting, they saw a new piece of parchment pinned to the noticeboard.
They were to meet Mr and Mrs Weasley, Bill and Fleur, Charlie, Percy and George in the Three Broomsticks, which was where the family would be staying over the next few days, aside from George, who had his own rented apartment in the village.
Harry pinned Draco’s wrist to the cold stone floor with his hands.
“Right, have a seat Potter. What is this about?”
Draco let out a sound of amusement, “Yeah, right.”
It’s getting harder and harder to be away from you. I don’t know how to explain it but I just feel like there’s something between us, there always has been. I feel like I’m going mental, but it’s probably just the lack of sleep.
Harry gripped his arm and gave him a fierce look as if to say, ‘I’m here for you.’
Draco and Blaise performed that same sexy handshake that Harry could only awe at. ‘Why did Slytherin’s have to be so cool?’ Harry thought to himself.
“Sorry Potter, can’t win every time!”
When Harry got outside, he saw a small crowd of people circling. He pushed through.
“Ohhh the boy who lived, ignorant as ever.”
Harry watched as Blaise suddenly walked briskly out of the pub.
Harry and Ron’s argument seemed to drift back into the distance. Their friendship worked that way; they could be so honest with each other that it would trigger one of them, but it was that honesty that founded their friendship, knowing that whichever one was pissed off, that they’d always come round.
“So long as we all think the same thing,” Dean said.
After an unknown amount of time had passed, Harry realised they’d reached that point in the night where all inhibitions were lost, and they both could just comfortably share silence.
Ron and Hermione however, didn’t look shocked at all, in fact, they looked as though they were expecting him.
Perhaps it was the atmosphere of the night; still air and starry sky. Or perhaps it was rejuvenated Gryffindor courage that seemed to rise to the surface, caused by the mere proximity to Hogwarts. Whatever it was, Harry felt himself stalking up to Draco Malfoy.
He had undoubtedly stumbled, and the sound of his fumbling footsteps echoed around the deserted corridor on the sixth floor, as his feet pinched the hem of the Cloak, evidently showing random pieces of Harry’s body.
“Oh, great.” Draco said sarcastically, “So no matter what I’m paired with a Gryffindor.”
“Typical,” Blaise muttered. “Doesn’t ever wanna leave Potter.”
But then Draco’s lips were gone, the blond giving Harry one last ambiguous glance, before he was straightening his clothes and heading for the door, leaving Harry feeling more confused than he had done since they’d first begun hooking up.
“Alright there Potter?” Theo asked, smirking.
Hermione sat beside Harry, the two of them appearing just as amazed as each other at the sight of these unlikely pairings.
“So how are you doing George, really?” Harry asked as the three followed him to the back of the counter.
Ron left, leaving Harry painfully reminded of Fred, that same aching longing filling his body.
The Christmas Trees were sparkling, and although the sky was a soft, pastel blue through the windows, there was already snow falling from the sky.
“Goodnight Harry.”
“Well, OK sure, we can talk. Have a seat.”
Harry was shocked, but Draco spoke first.
“Er, what do you mean what was I talking about…? You heard me, I was watching Harry and Malfoy play Quidditch-”
“I’d like to work here too-”
“Well why aren’t you using them now?”
The man halted. Harry felt Pansy and Draco turn their eyes upon him, their eyebrows raised in amusement.
Harry, Ron, Hermione and Luna all laughed in shock.
“RON!” Harry yelled.
“Ginny’s one person, and she’s not in Ravenclaw.”
Harry suspected that the house elves thought it was only enjoyable to open your presents in the company of your friends, rather than by yourself in your bedroom. He found himself smiling at their kind gesture.
“Er, thanks.”
“Merlin ‘Arry I’d forgot about that!” Seamus said through his laughter.
“Do away with me then Potter.”
Draco gripped ever so tightly on Harry’s cock and before Harry knew it, he was coming hard into Draco’s hand. He bit down onto Draco’s neck as he came, so as to stop himself from groaning embarrassingly loud. His hips bucked into Draco’s hand as he rode out his high, feeling Draco’s hand rest on his hip to steady him.
Harry and Draco shared a look, now realising they were between two of their awfully drunk friends, and that meant they’d most definitely become the center of attention for the rest of the evening.
“Yeah?” As Draco connected their hands.
“I’d thought I’d give it a try yeah.”
“Yes but-”
Their lips met again.
“Hermione knows I love her,” He replied strongly, frowning at Pansy.
The blond had become atrociously jealous.
Then he broke their eye contact and stalked off after Pansy.
Harry turned to him angrily, “What’s so funny!”
Harry gasped as he fell forwards slightly, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder. Draco continued to stroke him thoroughly as Harry panted into Draco’s neck.
“Hey Potter.”
Draco chuckled as they both turned back to their friends, who were still laughing at Harry and Draco’s expense, the two of them silently accepting defeat.
Suddenly, a great oak wooden double door appeared upon the blank space of the wall. When the three entered, they were blown off their feet with loud, blasting music. The Room looked just like a house party. The lights were dimmed. There was a fireplace along one wall with a rug, a couch and two armchairs surrounding it. Long, thick ribbons that looked like streamers hung loosely from the ceiling. This reminded Harry of Slughorn’s Christmas party back in sixth year. There was a large wooden table adorned with party food and next to that, another table with a large assortment of drinks. There were many comfortable armchairs spread throughout the room.
“Oh please, don’t act coy,” Pansy said, flicking her ponytail smiling. “I know what Draco’s like when he hasn’t had any sleep. And I know for a fact he doesn’t take any sleeping potions. But I also know that he has been getting sleep, lot’s of it may I add.”
Harry smiled fondly at his friends, and at the memories of their first year. He’ll never forget what it felt like riding his broom for the first time.
Harry continued to suck on Draco’s neck, not ever wanting this pleasure to end. Draco was so irresistibly sexy, Harry just wanted to eat him up.
“Great. Goodnight boys.”
When Harry lifted his head to look at him, he found Draco smirking.
Harry looked at him then, eyes watery.
Ron stared at him in disbelief and then Draco was stirring on the couch beside Harry.
They set off together toward the carriages.
On Saturday morning, Harry awoke in his own bed, but Draco lied peacefully beside him. The night before, Draco had come into Harry’s room in the evening to go over their Quidditch lesson, and before long they felt themselves sleepily fall into Harry’s bed, Draco’s fingers playing with Harry’s hair before his eyes slowly closed and their hands, once more, clasped together as they slept.
“Yeah it’s great. I’ve played with Dean before, flown for fun with Seamus, but they’ve got nothing on you.”
Draco turned as he reached the bottom step, fixing her with a fierce gaze.
Harry took a moment to find his voice.
“Harry, we’ve barely been back at Hogwarts for an hour and you’re already acting insane.” She gave him a stern look. “You promised Molly. No funny business.”
Harry’s heart fluttered for what felt like the millionth time that day.
-------------------
“Pansy you really wonder why the other houses never approach us. You’re unbearable,” Draco said glaring at her.
Harry caught her eye and shook his profusely.
There they were; Blaise, Pansy, Hermione and Ron, plus some of the eighth years who were listening intently to their conversation, were laughing their heads off, whilst Draco and Harry could only sit beside each other with no choice but to endure all their friends' torment.
There was a pause, before Harry said, “I told them. Ron and Hermione.”
“Do you ever feel like there’s this, you know, this weird thing between the two of us-” Harry looked at the wall trying to decipher his thoughts, “Like, there’s this pull, that’s been there ever since we were little. And...and that’s why we always fought, and why we always run into each other. Because there was this weird energy between us that was like, I don’t know...magnetic!”
“Um, I can take care of him Hermione, if you want to help Weasley,” Draco said tentatively.
“Why not?”
I can’t wait to wrap my arms around you.
Draco burst out laughing.
“What’s gotten into you? You’re acting like a Gryffindor.”
And then Draco bent lower and began sucking on Harry’s neck.
“If you say so.”
Draco turned on the water then they both undressed themselves, leaving a mingled pile of Gryffindor and Slytherin robes all over Draco’s black tiled floor.
“You were?”
She exhaled frustratingly, “I could say the same to you two! On the Quidditch pitch for five hours!”
Pressure on people, people on streets!”
Draco and Blaise still hadn’t returned from McGonagall’s office and it was now nearing 9 PM.
After the initial adjustment from week one at Hogwarts, the following weeks seemed to frighteningly fly by. Harry really did wonder if the clocks in the castle were set to run faster. But despite the quick pass of time, he fell asleep each night dangerously exhausted.
“Yes I know Hermione,” He said impatiently, “I’m sure you’ve noticed all the free time I’ve got, between studying five subjects and trying to not get swallowed by the amount of homework we’ve got.”
“I can’t help but ask,” Draco stared into the fire, “We haven’t been back to the castle for more than twenty-four hours and you’ve approached me four times already. Why the sudden interest if not for thinking I was up to something?”
Draco didn’t answer right away. Harry watched his eyes sweep over the page he was on, then mark it with his expensive looking bookmark, then stowed the book beside him. Harry frowned at the front cover, was that? No, couldn’t have been.
“I’m definitely going to miss you.”
There it was. Hermione proving once again how strikingly mature and intelligent she was. And all Harry could do was look at her in awe and remind himself how lucky he was to have her as a best friend. Now his face shone with fierce pride.
“Well get used to it, because they’re my family.”
The arm that was still draped over Harry’s body from before suddenly started moving, Draco’s hand sliding softly down Harry’s chest and stomach.
Harry licked his lips as his green eyes blazed in the morning light. He suddenly felt vulnerable, he knew he was already dangerously attached to Draco, but he didn’t want to let that known, but he also needed Draco to know how much he meant to him, how much Harry needed him.
“What’s wrong?” Draco muffled as he kissed along Harry’s shoulder.
As Harry had expected, the news had already travelled to the other houses somehow within the hour. Some the Gryffindors (Fred and George most particularly), were grinning up at him, calling out to him most unpleasantly, and this extended to some of the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs as well.
“Yeah, inter-house unity at it’s finest!” Pansy shrieked and Hermione laughed. Apparently the two got along now.
When they finally made their way into the shop, unwrapping their scarves and taking off their gloves as they went, they saw already a hundred kids chatting, laughing and trying out different products.
Draco growled. He ran his hand roughly through Harry’s hair and kissed him passionately.
Not a few days after Harry’s first bewildering encounter with Draco Malfoy, did the two run into each other again.
A particular favourite song of Harry’s had just begun to play and he suddenly stood up on the couch and started singing loudly.
“Proud to admit it?” Hermione finished for him.
“Well I’d like to hear it from you more often,” Ron said sharply.
Harry had never felt so good in his life. The scent of Draco only added to his euphoria.
“That doesn’t change anything Potter! We’re still gonna have to keep a secret.”
Harry felt his insides boil with anger again.
“I assure you Mr Potter, Malfoy here will be safe with me. Now come along now,” He began turning toward the door, “I’ve already spoken with the Headmistress. The Ministry is expecting you at nine o’clock.”
“Later.”
When she pulled away, she spoke again.
Once more, Harry felt himself placed on the threshold between desire and sanity. He knew he shouldn’t surrender to Draco’s touch, but Merlin just those soft lips had him yielding to the heat of the moment. Why did it have to feel so good?
“We know who you are!”
“God Draco,” Harry said breathlessly, “Why did we spend all those years fighting when we could’ve been doing this?”
“Well, if you all don’t mind, I need to shower.” Draco said and got up and headed for his dormitory.
Harry hadn’t even realised he’d gotten a full night’s sleep entirely undisturbed.
Harry suddenly felt intoxicated by his attire. He could smell the boy's scent; it was wood, mixed with lemon and parchment, but also hints of grass and soil. Harry was rendered immobilized on the spot, immediately at a loss for words, the reckless courage seeming to catch up with him.
Harry had only had a few drinks, but he noted that Draco had resolutely caught up with Ron and Blaise, the three of them now rolling around on the floor singing Christmas carols loudly. A sight he truly never, ever, thought he’d see.
Harry turned at this.
“Right, so I think we make the most of this year before... you know…”
“Is that so?” Draco’s grip on Harry’s hips tightened.
Pansy and Blaise burst out laughing.
When the two of them went down for breakfast, Ron, Hermione and Blaise were already there. Luna was sitting on the eighth year table too, and Harry noticed that there were only about fifteen other kids who also sat in the Great Hall, scattered around the mostly empty House tables.
Thus far, Harry hadn’t really thought about the intricacies of being in a relationship with Draco, his focus remained on the confession of his feelings.
“And they beat me up! As if you’re lettin’ em’ go to school, run around the village, when they’re associated with such vermin! And now they’re beating me up! Who knows what else they’re capable of!”
Harry’s head was still tilted back slightly, wanting the sensation Draco was giving, but also hugely confused and conflicted at this sudden turn of events.
“Never have I ever wished I was in a different House,” Hermione said.
“We’ve all had our hardships, to put it lightly,” McGonagall continued, “But we’re all here to live another day, and I think that is reason enough to celebrate.”
Harry was defeated. Breathing heavily and unable to move now due to Draco’s weight above him.
“I dunno, some Muggle singer.”
“Back for more are we?”
Harry’s thought processes had sufficiently dulled. The only thing he was thinking of was how much he wanted Draco. The tingling and sparks of their magic still dancing around them, tickling their skin.
“Mum does that mean I can stop brushing my hair too?”
Harry had gotten no sleep the night before, tossing and turning insistently, his thoughts burdened by imagery of the endless depths of the Ministry of Magic.
“First up, we’re gonna play Truth or Dare.”
“What do you want?” Harry demanded fiercely.
He sniffed into her bushy hair, hugging her tightly.
He stalked past her down the staircase. “Yes Pansy.”
He avoided their eyes before finally reaching to grab some toast and porridge. His stomach had a sickly stirring sensation whirring around it and yet he also felt tremendously hungry. As he munched down his toast, Harry concluded that he may very well be running to the toilet cubicle any minute now to hurdle up whatever was stirring inside him, but as for right now, he was hungry and his toast and porridge seemed to be slowly waking up his brain.
Good news: I’ll be home on the 12th.
Draco’s smirk was undeniable, and all Harry could do was grip Draco’s tie tightly in order to stop himself crumbling to the floor with desire.
“Yes?” Harry murmured into the blond’s neck.
Harry swallowed and took a deep breath.
“Well, that’s good…” Harry said grinning but still looking shy and unlike himself.
“I agree. I think we make a great team,” Harry turned to look at the blond, “The first years really liked you.”
Ron’s mouth fell open; not only had a bushy haired Hermione scrambled through the door, but a certain blond haired Slytherin followed carefully behind her.
“Works for me.” Ron said.
Hermione’s eyes were watery as she stared at Ron, before she flung her arms around him and kissed his cheek.
“Thanks Potter but I think I’m able to carry books by myself.”
Draco frowned and broke eye contact, but moved so his lips touched the palm of Harry’s hand that still lay gently on his face. Draco kissed it softly but refused to look at Harry.
He looked at her then, into her warm and welcoming eyes.
The owl gave him a steely look. Harry had become accustomed to this look from Hedwig, and he knew the owl before him wasn’t happy about the prospect of being sent back out through the snow, having to travel all the way back to Malfoy manor.
“It was fine I guess.” Draco sipped his tea.
Ron clung to Hermione before the moment began to pass.
The blond moved to straddle his hips and pinned Harry’s arms to the ground.
Harry shrugged, “It has a sentiment. I like to keep it close to me.”
Harry stared into the blond’s eyes, “Sleep with me.”
What’s more, is that because Draco was now sleeping with Harry every night, Harry’s usual curfewed ‘release,’ was deemed impossible now that he shared a bed with another. He longed to touch himself. He should’ve done when he was in the shower, but he always remained in Draco’s bed in the morning for too long, wasting his precious time and rendering himself unable to get off before school started.
“You’re so hot when you’re angry Potter,” Draco murmured along Harry’s skin.
Harry’s eyes were blazing as he looked down at the flustered face of his ‘enemy.’
Their fingers were intertwined as Draco led Harry down the dark corridor. There were black wooden doors with snake-like doorknobs lining the hall, and then Draco entered one toward the hall’s end.
“Good. You deserve to feel this way Harry.”
He was breathless and gasping Draco’s name.
To which Harry was left with hot tears rolling down his cheeks.
'Any eighth year that would like to mentor the younger students in their preferred profession, please write your name below underneath the said subject. These mentorships will happen on the first and third Saturday mornings of each month. Please note that a maximum of two eighth years only can be assigned to each subject. If there are more than two names listed below a specific subject, the staff will decide which two will gain the mentorship position.
Harry felt his chest fill with warm and fuzzy feelings, but when he looked at Hermione, her eyes were watering, an astonished and extremely flattered look upon her face as she stared at him.
It was the day before Christmas Eve, and Harry had arranged a meeting with McGonagall so that he could tell her about his new aspiration to be a teacher.
Harry’s heart was beating in his throat. He looked to Draco, who was still looking into his lap, seeming to be patiently waiting for the wrath of Ron Weasley.
“Hmm, I’ll go with dare.”
“Are you two just about ready to admit you are obsessed with each other?” Pansy asked, causing yet another round of laughter around their table.
They rest for a bit, even nap, lying side by side in a bed in their clothes and stocking feet, separated by mere inches, separated by miles and lifetimes of the earth.  When they rouse themselves after a few hours of sleep, Harry's hip is clearly agonizing but "fine" he says, "fine, fine" as though it were merely a stubbed toe and not something so painful it is making him wince to move.  Draco watches as he takes his hair down from the tight braid he travels in, tying it back more naturally, and wonders why this is always his lot.  Always now he watches and waits, he almost says, he almost does, but in the end all he can offer to these moments of pain and curdled misery is a helpless gaze.  He hasn't even asked anything, but still "fine" Harry insists, biting off the word as though it itself were the problem.  His fingers are clenched so tightly on his cane Draco doesn't see how they can squeeze so tightly for so long, knuckles glowing white on the spell-reinforced ebony handle.  They pick their way down the hall, Draco fearing the whole while that they will get lost again, but discover another tiny, bitter irony; there is an elevator only a few doors down the opposite direction from which they arrived.  Sighing, sharing a glance that expressed their common opinion of this, they get in.  Is this all we can agree on now, Draco wonders idly, meeting those green eyes disgust for disgust at the thought of their previous rambling progress through the halls.  Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy's example to the contrary, Draco is forced to acknowledge that shared disdain for the world in general doesn't seem like a stable basis for a marriage.  The easy camaraderie and reliable support that was the basis for years seems gone, and Draco doesn't think scorn is a worthwhile substitute.
Potter, you are more than a bloody
They get to the room finally, after getting wildly, extravagantly lost in the endless shifting corridors.  Once, Draco can't help but think, this would have been funny.  They would have been laughing, joking, practically chasing each other through these just-alike halls past the identical doors stretching off in all directions.   Now they just shuffle along, not speaking, barely looking at each other, and Draco hates it, hates everything about it, cursing himself for leaving England and Harry for agreeing to this mad idea for some reason.  Even so, eventually they come to a door where the bracelet shines white for a moment, and at long last one of the serried ranks of closed doors actually swings open.  Finally, Draco thinks.  Harry looks a bit drawn now, limp a bit more pronounced, crows feet around his eyes a bit deeper, but he's still got the half-smile he wears in public places.  Draco hates that face as much as Harry once hated Draco's public face, cold and uncaring, a young Lucius Malfoy peering out into the world.  Harry's face isn't cold; it's warm, but it shows the warmth of a comforting lie instead of true warmth.  Draco looks down, tired beyond reason of that face.
"What?"  Draco looks up, knowing he is blotchy and wet and destroyed, but what difference does it make at this point?  Harry has seen him looking worse.  "You know what, exactly?"
and a dark maroon fez, bows, waves his arm in an elaborate salaam.  "Potter?" he asks in a heavy accent. Harry steps up smiling and nodding, so much the picture of the British tourist that Draco's teeth ache.  There he goes, Draco thinks bitterly, Mr. Popular, attempting to charm the locals even when they aren't his locals at all.  The man waves an arm towards the car, the rear door pops open with a clunk.  "Please, please!"  Sighing, Draco climbs in, not sure what to expect.  Anything to escape the filthy street.  Surprisingly, the interior of the car is cool and pleasant.  A gentle breeze wafts constantly, smelling faintly of cloves and cinnamon, easy to pick out for a potions master.  A tiled, pillared court with a fountain sprawls unexpectedly before them.  Mirrors reflect the space, doubling themselves off into infinity and making the courtyard look almost infinitely larger. There are piled brightly-colored cushions to sit on (though how Potter is supposed to get up from the floor with his bad leg is anyone's guess), green plants, even a hookah which gets a suspicious glance from the both of them as they settled.  At least they agree on that.
"Together," Harry finally says in a voice like a breath, the tiny soft flower petal voice that Draco hasn't heard for a decade at least, the voice that first confessed love on a moonlit bench, the voice that sometimes told secrets in the middle of the night, secrets so large that they could not fit into the room otherwise.  Harry swallows, gives a tiny defiant lift of his chin, echo of a long-ago boy who snatched an improbable triumph from nowhere.  "It's been a long time since we did something... together."  Draco couldn't help but laugh helplessly at how silly Harry's statement is, looking around himself at the hotel room in a far-flung corner of the world from their usual places, but... even so.  Harry is still right, he has to admit.  We weren't really here together before this discussion; we were alone in the same room.
Draco twists, peers eye to eye from close range through the glasses, takes them off Harry's face and sets them aside.  "I know how miserable you look, then.  The only time I see you smile is when you go out, and it's that fake Ministry smile you do.  I hate it.  I half think you only do it because I hate it."  He arches a brow to show he is joking, but the look on Harry's face tells him the joke falls flat.  He sighs, kisses the dents in the proud nose where glasses have worn grooves, and settles into Harry's arms from memory instead of recent experience, twitching to find a more comfortable position.  "You never smile when it's just us.  And it hurts, and then I hear myself sounding like a bitter old thing when I talk, and I just..." he shrugs, helpless to capture the emotion in words.  "I am sorry for sounding like that so much... I really don't mean to."  Harry sighs, snickers, looks away.
Draco stumbles out of the international Portkey lobby into a wall of heat and noise, Harry trailing behind him.  "Dear blessed Merlin," Draco whimpers softly, dabbing at his brow with a grey silk handkerchief and pretending to ignore the eyeroll and sigh from his companion.  Cairo is utterly overwhelming.  People are swarming like ants in all directions, and the shouts and horns and tinny, wailing music are enough to make him wish they were back in England.  A change in the air brings an overwhelming stench of something rotten, and he gags briefly before the stench vanishes in the swirling dust.
"Good afternoon, two under the name Potter," he says to the clerk, trying with moderate success to modulate his tone.  The young man behind the desk nods, smiles, makes all the appropriate noises, pretends with admirable aplomb that he has seen nothing.  His name is Fouad, Draco is informed by his jaunty nameplate.
Draco inhales, exhales, letting the moment sit and just be for a second before answering.  He finally leans back, setting a tiny amount of space between them but keeping Harry's hand in his own, almost a challenge.  "No," he finally says, sounding shockingly together to himself considering how he was just crying.  He fights to keep his bitterness out of his words and almost succeeds.  "I never wanted you to go.  No matter how bad it was, I wanted the situation to change, but I never wanted to be... without you."  They sit for a moment, lost in thought.  Draco is surprised to hear himself keep talking.  "I know how miserable you are."  Harry snorts at that, chuckles, and it's almost his old laugh.
massage', and realizes too late with the sudden half-hidden curl of disdain on Fouad's lip that he was badly misreading the situation all along.  All his instincts are wrong lately, it seems.  They take the elevator, the right one this time, and make their way the few short steps to their room.  When they step inside, the hissing of the sand from the kinetic sculpture is loud in the silence as Harry sighs heavily.
"I miss together," he whispered back, cursing himself for hoping.  Harry shifts again, stretching his leg, but Draco slides away and then leans over, keeps leaning, too far, ending with his head resting pillowed on Harry's good thigh.  A tentative hand comes up, strokes the greying silvery hair and loosens it from the tie Draco bound it with before dinner.  This used to be a familiar thing, resting like this; the ache of the memory is so strong Draco feels it as an almost physical pain, but still he treasures the thin, restless fingers toying with strands of his hair more than gold or jewels.  "I miss together more than anything."
"'S hot," Harry says faux-agreeably, the way he always sounds rather than let himself say what he actually thinks.  Draco hates it, opens his mouth but then closes it again.  What's the use?  Harry leans on his cane looking decades older than his actual age.  Draco watches him glance up and down the narrow street, presumably looking around for the magical cab that they had been promised.  Go to Egypt, Pansy had insisted, it's exactly what you need!  A romantic getaway, rekindle the spark, and so on and so forth.  Thus far, Draco reflects bitterly, this trip is about as romantic as day-old takeout.  Eyeing the suspiciously organic looking detritus around the base of one whitewashed wall, he revises his estimate.  Day old takeout from the rubbish tip, more like.  A noise draws his attention, horn shockingly close.
.  He meant to do it.  He was aiming for my head, and he'd have been happy to hit it.  Would have, too, if I wasn't busy flying arse-over-tip when he cast it.  It was pretty fucking far from an 'accident'."  Draco sits with his mouth hanging open; Harry has never said this before, not in this way.  He knew about what caused the wound of course, knew the particulars, even knew the perpetrator, but this is the most he's heard Harry say about it directly in almost two years.  He wishes he had known, but maybe...  Before he can speak, Harry whispers "Sometimes I wish..." and trails off, the end of the sentence so glaringly obvious that Draco wants to scream.
"No you don't," he says, humor masking a misery that seems to go into his very bones.  "You really don't."  His green eyes are clearer than Draco has seen them in what seems forever, but what is shown there is pain that threatens to bring back his tears.
Several more courses come and pass slowly, Potter stabbing desultorily at the food as though it has personally insulted him, staring at each mouthful like... Merlin and Circe, Draco thinks, like a bitter old man.  For the first time in a long time, he looks at Harry, really looks, leaving all his preconceptions and their history and past and love and everything behind.  It's easier to do this in this strange setting, like nowhere they have been in ages... there is no Harry-shaped hole in this place to fit him into, so Draco looks and sees only what is there.  When he does he feels his heart lurch in his chest.  Mother of Night, he looks dreadful.  To Draco's shocked eyes, the grey threading through Harry's limp black curls stands out like a flag, the lines on Harry's face, the dark sunken circles beneath shadowed eyes, the bony, veined hands moving restlessly... whenever did he get so thin?  The way he sits is nothing like the Harry in Draco's mind and memory, splayed in his chair like a lazing leopard, sprawling out to take up space, waving, smiling, active and exuberant... this Harry hunches, drawn inwards like a surly raven, wounded leg sitting askew at an awkward angle, eyes aimed only at his plate.  This, Draco thinks miserably, this is what has been hiding behind that public face... but not hiding well.  Not from him.  He could have seen this at any time if only he had looked.  Harry looks up, puzzled, catches his eyes for a moment, and Draco forces himself to speak, break this awkward moment.  "What..." he says, throat unaccountably tight and dry, sips his wine and tries again, "what appeals to you, then?  Shall we stay here in the hotel, perhaps a trip to the spa?  Go out?  See the sights?  Sleep in?"  He arches a brow in the way he always did, saddened when instead of the easy smile his heart still half-expects he gets a look of indifference.
"What should we do tomorrow?" Draco asks as the first course is delivered, tiny delicate bites of lamb spiced with sumac and mint.  Harry shrugs irritably, peers at his food as though it is suspect, finally deigns to taste one of the fragrant morsels and grunts in surprise as though shocked to find it edible.  Fighting the almost painful urge to roll his eyes, Draco continues.  "The brochure said that they do day trips from here if you'd like to go see the pyramids, or bits of magical Alexandria.  There's also a trip to a glassware factory, if that appeals; the glass here has been famous for thousands of years."  Harry doesn't look up, merely spears another of the lamb chunks and eats it.  Draco feels almost as though he's talking to himself.  He wonders for a moment if anyone else can see Harry, or if a stranger passing by would simply see him sitting by himself, conversing with an empty chair.  "At some point on the trip, I'd like to visit the shrine of Hekate Soteira in Alexandria, as it's quite old, but of course that doesn't have to be..."
"Do you?" he says before he can think about it, words hard edged and spiteful.  "You have a bloody odd way of showing it, then."  Now it is Harry's turn to look confused, losing that sorrowful look, brilliant green eyes blinking behind round glasses that have gone from being hated to loved and back so many times they have lost all meaning.
He doesn't hear the bathroom door open, nor the click of the cane on the tiles.  He is too caught in his misery, tears pouring hot over fingers, trying not to sob out loud.  The first indication that Harry is back is a soft hand on his shoulder, a whisper behind him "Oh Draco..."  The heavy thump of Harry settling (practically falling, really) into the chair beside him.  "It's alright," he hears, wondering what this means, "I'm sorry.  You don't have to put yourself through this.  I know already."
"I... what?"  Harry pulls back, closing off again, and Draco can't stand it, can't stand to see him vanish again into half-smiling nothingness.  He makes an abortive attempt to leap up, then stops, settles, braces himself in the wretched uncomfortable chair.  I can do this, he thinks.  I have to do this.
"No need to answer now," Draco says quickly, sounding rushed, frantic to preserve this tiny beachhead in a subject he had thought surrendered long ago.  "Think on it if you wish.  So wasn't dinner grand?"  He reminds himself of one of the Weasleys with that clumsy segue, curses as Harry grins ruefully at him, flicker-fast, another expression he has missed like a drowning man misses air.  The other man doesn't point it out though, just sits quietly, fingers twitching in Draco's hand as though remembering how to be held, how to hold.  Moments pass, then minutes, in a newly comfortable silence.
Harry chuckles, and Draco thinks it may be the most bitter sound he's ever heard come from his husband.  "Isn't this where you tell me you want a divorce?"  Sound stops, other than the rattling of the cup in the saucer in Draco's hand; even the hissing from the kinetic sand sculpture seems muted.  Actually, maybe I
"I never stopped meaning it," Draco whispers.  "I just..." he draws in a breath that seems too tight, lungs not quite as big as they ought to be somehow.  "I don't mean to close myself off, but I suppose I have as well.  I wanted to come on this vacation for a reason, though not the one you thought."  They both gave a hiccup of a laugh, the first shared laugh in... gods, Draco thought sadly, how long?  "I wanted a different place, so we could form... different patterns, maybe, change the way we interact back to what we used to..." he sees the wave of bitterness like a physical thing, passing through Harry like a cloud over a sunlit meadow, and stumbles to correct himself.  "Obviously we can't go back to the past exactly, but we can..." Harry's face is closing down, turning away, sealing everything away again and Draco wants to scream and throw his cup and this fiddly little teapot and his own internal organs around the room in a rage.  "Let me try again.  I want to get back to a place where I have my husband again.  I miss the company, I miss your touch, I miss your silly jokes, I miss
"Why would I want to go
"Draco..." a soft whisper, breath stirring in his hair.  "I hate seeing you like this too.  I... I just..." Harry breaks off, shifts in his seat, some invisible pain inside his leg forcing him to move to let the knotted muscles ease themselves.  There is something new in his voice, something Draco hasn't heard for longer than he likes to contemplate.  He lies quietly for a moment, savoring being in Harry's arms where he hasn't been, feeling Harry's body which has almost become a stranger to him in its odd new shapes and its unfamiliar boniness, his familiar scent which is still after all these years like a benediction, a marker of safety.  Even so, even with this focus on the moment, he almost misses the shift, the changing that marks a decision.  "Were you..." comes the soft murmur, pauses, continues "you really didn't bring me here to break it off?"
"The... what do you mean, the opposite?  You thought I... Merlin, no, I don't want a divorce!  Why..." Harry half-shouts.  He runs his fingers through his greying hair, disturbing it into a shadow of its former unruly self, reminding Draco suddenly, incongruously, of their first days together when everything was fresh and new and they were young.  Another chuckle, softer, more than half a sob.  With a moment of crystalline clarity, Draco realizes that he's seen Harry cry only a handful of times.  He is suddenly aware that this may yet turn out to be one of those times, and that knowledge sits in his blood like acid.  "Oh Draco," Harry says, voice thick.  "How did we get here?"  He looks old, impossibly defeated, hunched in the awful chair and staring at his feet as though they held some mystery.
"Harry James
"Wh... together?  You?" he asked.  "Why would you..."  Offense vanishes in a moment.  Green eyes blink, once, twice, looking confused and lost before cutting away, more open and present than Draco has seen in... far too long.  "I..."
He buries his face in his hands.  He doesn't mean to cry, not really; for this, though, there's nothing to be done, and Draco cries because there doesn't seem to be any other option.
"You should sound that way," Harry mutters.  "It reminds me how I look now.  How I'm probably acting.  I..." Draco waits impatiently for the end of the sentence, but it doesn't come.
Like everything else at
"Alright then, Harry, tell me, why did I 'invite' you?"  As if he needed to invite his husband, as if they weren't just traveling together!  He snaps his fingers imperiously, odd looking house elf appearing in an instant.  The elf receives his request for tea and Arab coffee and returns almost immediately with a tray, bowing and scraping until dismissed.  Harry just stares at him, acting as though there is no elf present.  "Go on," Draco finally says, waving towards the tray.  "Have something and tell me what it is that you think you've figured out."  Shaking fingers lift the steeping pot and pour a cup of tea, taking refuge in the familiar ritual.  The tea is strong and black, even the smell revealing its harshness, acrid, pungent, far too strong, cutting across the warm sweetness of the incense.  Draco adds sugar, a splash of milk to cut the bitterness, sips.  Acceptable for now.  He turns, mustering up all the long-ago social training he's ever had not to speak again, forcing himself to wait.
