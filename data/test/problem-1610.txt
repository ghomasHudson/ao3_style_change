Professor McGonagall did not seem surprised at his return. That was lowering, because Harry had no reason whatsoever to be visiting her office again today. He was sure he’d been an unpredictable child, once upon a time.
“Morons,” Pansy scoffed. “Honestly. Hogsmeade was overrun with the Dark Lord’s followers. Where did McGonagall think all those Death Eaters were coming from?”
It was an incredible story. Harry couldn’t imagine how Hermione managed to hold herself so professionally in the face of it. But then, Hermione had always been impressive. His heart swelled with love and admiration as he watched her scribble dutiful notes.
“And yet...” She shrugged. “Draco is a very different man than he was as a child. And, in point of fact, I’m not sure he was exactly who we thought he was. Even then.”
“Very well.” Hermione said briskly, and Harry saw Ron squeeze her knee under the table. “Tom Riddle, the man known as Voldemort, returned to corporeal form at the end of our fourth year at Hogwarts. Much of the public refused to accept that fact. Can you tell me, each of you, when you became aware that he’d actually returned?”
“I know you’re going to be fine,” Harry said quietly into Al’s messy hair. “And I want you to know… I’ll be fine, too.”
it’s not fair to Albus. And, most importantly, it’s not fair to Draco.” Her eyes opened, and they were so, so sad. “I know you don’t want to hear that.”
Winky snapped her fingers, and Harry’s wand appeared in her skinny grip. She held it out to him impatiently. Harry unclenched his fists to take it from her. His magic flared once, making everyone in the room wince, and then it settled into a low, steady purr.
Luna confirmed, through her hopping Patronus, that James went straight home after physical therapy. It was nearly an hour before Harry saw hide-nor-hair of his children. Finally, Lily popped her bright red head out of the storeroom. “Dad, I’m hungry. Can we go for pasties?”
“Ta for the tea, dears,” she called as she hurried back to the front hall. “Tell Ron I want an update on the business with the cursed broomsticks. Sooner, rather than later.”
“Ah, yes. Sadly, Spinnet’s got the troll situation well in hand. How on earth will you meet new people without the threat of imminent demise?”
“Molly’s prepared to give you the ins and outs of Hogwarts,” Percy told Lily, chest puffed with pride. “She did very well on her exams last year, very well indeed.”
“Lily’s in the back, wrapping gift packages with Angie,” Teddy offered. “Albus is on the sales floor, somewhere. Good luck spotting the little Goblin.”
McGonagall’s lips pursed to suppress her smile. “No, Mr. Lupin. That won’t be necessary. There’s a tried-and-tested solution for this kind of injury.”
I intended to post a lot more during quarantine, but my daughter's online schooling took up much more time and attention than I could've predicted. Then, of course, the world exploded around us. Or... perhaps it just came into focus. Either way, I'm sorry for not keeping my promise to post.
Compared with the many days and nights Harry spent there, twenty-five years ago, the hospital wing was barely recognizable. Always the most modernized of all Hogwarts facilities, it'd been completely gutted after the war. Madam Pomfrey installed up-to-date magical monitoring equipment, as well as adjustable beds and safety rails. The floors and furniture were scrubbed clinical white. The walls were pale blue, the ceiling darker and Charmed to display fluffy clouds during the daytime, and pin-prick stars at night.
Ted pulled an umbrella from the still-pretty-ugly troll leg umbrella stand. His amber eyes were serious. They stepped out on the flagstone stoop, joined hands, and Disapparted with a
“Dad?” Al frowned, before shrugging away Harry’s odd appearance. “Can Scorpius come for dinner? His mum has shopping to finish.”
She gave him time to reply, but there was no chance of that. Ron looked ill. His freckles were stark against the translucence of his skin. Harry pictured Fred, and Colin, and Lavender, Tonks and Remus, and on and on. A long parade of lives traded for Harry’s.
Harry wiped a hand across his mouth and sighed. “I can come today, soon as I’ve let the office know. Just for the day, d’you think?”
“Where is James?” Neville wondered, peering back toward the conference of fearsome women in argument across the room.
“Less so than the average wizard,” Parkinson replied, pinning Ron with her stare. “He’s in the public eye. His wife was a professional athlete, and then a coach. All those endorsement deals! Head Auror, and heir to the Sleekeazy fortune. There are trade-offs for the kind of money and power the Potter family’s amassed.”
“It’s nobody's business but our own,” Harry finally replies. Pansy sighs, standing. She tucks her wand into her sleeve and waits while Harry sets the mugs to wash in the ancient sink.
The staff table was only half-full. McGonagall sat in the middle, cutting a slice of ham into neat little squares.
“It stands to reason you’d remember it fondly, despite everything that happened there. Hogwarts was your escape.”
. A male child with Veela ancestry. It’s incredibly rare.” There was something proud, almost smug, lurking behind his eyes. “Veela genetic markers attach themselves to X chromosomes, typically. It’s not my particular field of study, but I have a colleague in Italy doing remarkable work with gene mapping—”
“Give her time,” Fleur says, patting his knee. “She used to hate me so much and now she loves me. She just needs time.”
Harry frowns and starts observing Draco the following days. He notices how focussed he is in class, avoiding drawing attention to himself, but taking notes in elegant slanted cursive and scribbling down the right answer to every single question the professors ask. Harry sees the dark circles under grey eyes, the way Draco yawns, but still soldiers through every afternoon session at the Host Club.
“Er…could you make me a cheese toastie, please?” he asks and his question is met with a disappointed frown and a deep sigh, so he adds “but you can make whatever you want for dinner. I’m not fussy.”
“Then take your time to prepare me,” Draco replies, hoarse and desperate as he kisses Harry deeply, making him moan into his mouth.
“Might be worth a try,” Harry says, “if that’s what you want. But you can’t leave the house to go to a tattoo parlour.”
Harry shrugs, avoiding grey eyes. He’s never paid too much attention to these things. Besides, it feels like a shame to buy new things, when he can just take what Molly kindly gives him. It’s not worth the hassle. He doesn’t need new things. And what has he done to deserve them anyway?
“He’s barely eating at mealtimes,” the Slytherin says with a grimace. “He came back early this morning, completely invisible. I saw a hand appearing out of nowhere and opening his bed curtains. Gave me a fright.”
Harry shuts his eyes, focusing on the feeling of Draco’s hand stroking his back, on his sweet and calm voice and slowly he starts breathing again.
“Are you sure, Harry?” the Headmistress asked, studying him and then looking at Draco when Potter nodded and then shrugged. “Mr Malfoy?”
“You wrote me so many letters,” Harry explains, “baring your heart out to me. You never said those things to me; you only ever write them down.”
“Cup of tea, love?” Draco asks, and Harry nods, because the words are still painfully stuck in his throat.
“Mhh,” Draco hums his approval as Harry slides his hands under his knees and opens his legs, his warm breath tickling Draco’s sensitive skin, a mere inch away from his hard cock.
“I said,” Harry repeats angrily, “clean up the mess you’ve made. You ruined Draco’s robes, and he only has four of them, because you won’t allow him to have more. So clean them up, before the stains become permanent.”
“You’re a nuisance, you know?” Malfoy says behind him, grabbing his book and following him inside, still barefoot. His footsteps sound soft on the carpet and Harry wants to turn and look at him, but he feels like Orpheus with Eurydice, worrying that Malfoy might disappear if he shares a glance with him.
“Malfoy,” he drawls, but his face lights up when he spots Harry. “Harry Potter, such a pleasure to meet you. I’m Auror Page.”
“How is your Italian course going?” Draco asks, and Harry smiles. He’s been attending a class organised by the local council for foreign language speakers, and he’s even made a few friends. They’re all Muggle immigrants from all parts of the globe, and Harry loves listening to their melodious accents, enjoying the fact that for once they get to know the real Harry instead of The Boy Who Lived Twice.
Teddy looks proud in his little uniform, ready for another day in Muggle primary school. It was Hermione’s idea to send the children to school. She spent years advocating the necessity of an early education, much to Mrs Weasley’s outrage at the prospect of not home-educating her offspring just like every single Wizarding family.
“Oh,” Draco says, his mouth hanging open as he stares at Weasley. “That’s…really kind of you. Thank you.”
“My ice cream has melted,” Harry complains afterwards, looking like a lost puppy as he washes his hands in the sea water. It never fails to amaze him how clear it is. He can see tiny fish swimming around their feet.
“You’re so good. Pulling your cock for me like that,” Malfoy whispers, his posh crispy tones inexplicably turning Harry on even more. He’s already so close to coming, even though it feels impossible. What is Malfoy doing to him? “Do you want to come on me, Potter? On my scars?”
“They took my wand away when they collected me in the morning,” Draco explains, his voice low but still discernible in spite of the loud chatter around them. “They only gave it back to me when I was escorted to the castle.”
Potter looks awkward, sitting down at the dinner table, still wearing his Auror uniform, which looks a million times better since Draco’s had his way with it. The buttons are polished and the ironing charm is still in place, in spite of having been secretly cast the previous day. Draco feels proud of his work.
“Did you hear about Hogsmeade?” Neville asks, breaking Harry’s daze. “Professor McGonagall is going to allow the eighth-year students to go to Hogsmeade every weekend. Professor Sprout told me yesterday evening.”
Harry thinks he’s probably imagining it, but it almost looks like Malfoy’s cheeks are turning the loveliest shade of pink.
“Milk, no sugar,” Malfoy says and then grimaces when he notices Harry pouring three teaspoons of sugar in his. “Merlin, Potter, are you actively trying to get diabetes?”
So he let Harry kiss him and touch him like he was something precious that could break into a million pieces, and he continued holding the Gryffindor in his sleep, grabbing his hand when he could see that he was struggling, making him fall apart under his touches and kisses.
is. Do you think I haven’t noticed how you’re always following me around? You never leave me alone for more than a few minutes. As if I could AK myself while I’m taking a piss.”
Harry lets out a shaky laughter, feeling so happy that his heart is about to burst. They kiss, a tender and soft thing, lips barely brushing against lips.
Harry’s hot mouth closes around Draco’s pale neck, trailing kisses up his Adam’s apple, until he sucks on a spot that makes Draco whimper and clutch at his top.
“I…” Harry swallows loudly and scratches the back of his neck. “I need to finish this essay by Monday, and I also need help with the Transfiguration homework.”
Draco grabs a pillow and positions it under Harry’s bum. He lifts Harry’s legs up and stares at him for a few seconds. Harry feels exposed, like a present on display for Draco to admire. He wants to move his hands, to cover himself up, but at the same time he craves Draco’s grey eyes on him, wanting to keep his wrists where his lover placed them.
“A little better,” Ron says. “Angelina has been coming to see him every day, and she managed to get him back to the shop a few times. She’s really amazing, and I think George might be secretly in love with her. Mum approves for once, so we’re just waiting for him to find the courage to ask her out.”
But as Harry puts all the clean clothes in the drawers haphazardly, he comes to the conclusion that the moment he actually realised he was in love is during their very first trip. That disastrous weekend in the Lake District. The reporters had been everywhere in London, making Harry feel trapped and anxious. He had stopped sleeping again, he wasn’t eating properly, and Hermione was getting more worried by the day.
“But you’ve just come,” Harry argues, feeling his own cock hardening at the thought of being inside Draco’s tight heat.
“Take a deep breath for me, sweetheart,” Draco says before he starts gently pushing against him. At first nothing happens, and Harry looks down, mildly concerned, but then Draco tries again and the head of his cock slides inside. Harry gasps, closing his eyes as Draco slowly slides all the way in, holding his breath as he feels so full and stretched. “Breathe, my love, breathe. Open your eyes and look at me, Harry.”
Draco loves putting his hand on his bump to feel the baby kick and punch against it, an ecstatic smile on his beautiful face.
Harry spends the rest of the day trying to kiss him, laughing because the freshening charms don’t actually seem to work, and Draco pulls the funniest faces every time Harry so much as breathes next to him.
They were both quiet for a few minutes, Potter’s nostrils flaring, his magic slowly getting out of control, making the lights flicker, the windows rattle and the curtains move.
“Circe, your hair is impossible, Harry!” she grumbles, pulling up her sleeves and cursing under her breath. “Where were you planning on taking him?”
The Auror’s lips part, her smile disappearing as she stares at Harry and then at Draco, but then she quickly schools her expression back into her pleasant cheerfulness.
They barely spoke the day after, Harry casting glances at him over breakfast, finally touching his hand on their way out, stopping for a second to gently tuck one of Draco’s loose strands behind his ear.
They lie in the dark for what feels like ages. Harry thinks Draco has fallen asleep, his eyes shut and his breathing regular, when Draco suddenly speaks again.
When they finally arrive in the capital city of the Netherlands it’s already dark, but Harry still stares at the charming houses with his mouth agape.
Draco comes back from community service, dirty and wounded, and heads for his bedroom without a word. Parkinson and Zabini follow him, and Harry just feels useless waiting for them to emerge from the dorm.
“Look at this,” Malfoy says, showing him a photo he just got out of an envelope, and Harry’s breath hitches in his throat.
“Same,” Draco said and then found the courage to reach with his fingers, tracing Harry’s dark eyebrows, the curve of his nose and his scar, his soft lips, with the lightest brush of his fingertips.
It was clear that Potter wanted to ask more, intrigued as always by anything that smelled like a secret, but the train came to a halt and the other students started moving, so Potter had to hide again under his cloak.
“Yeah,” Harry replies as he averts his gaze, swallowing stones, a massive lump in his throat. “I’m fine. Coming.”
“Would you like to see the inside of one?” Draco asks, and Harry can do nothing but nod enthusiastically. It takes them a few hours to go around the site, and by the end of it Harry regains his speech.
“If you hurt or insult my boyfriend one more time,” Harry snarls, “you’ll spend the rest of your days at St Mungo’s.”
When they lie in a tangle of limbs afterwards, fingertips featherlight on each other’s skin, Draco wonders if he should sleep in his bed, if he should ask what Harry wants, but then green eyes lock with his.
Harry sits up, a soft blanket slipping off his shoulders. He looks at it and then at Malfoy, questioningly.
“We’re running late, you sap,” Draco replies, then changes his mind and chases Harry’s lips for another kiss. “The ferry won’t wait for us.”
Harry feels a thrill when he reads it, his fingers trembling slightly as he holds the parchment. He could have anyone’s attention, really. There are so many people out there who would pay for a glimpse of his life. And yet, he feels stupidly giddy because Malfoy has been decent for once, almost friendly.
, or that he’s trying to salvage his reputation by exploiting your fame. It would just be a disaster. And imagine if the wizarding world found out that the precious Saviour fancies blokes!”
Draco’s never admitted it out loud, the deep need he feels to be accepted, but Harry knows and he hugs him, stroking his back, without a word.
“We’ve done it,” Draco whispers, kissing his forehead, his fingers shaking on dark curls. “Harry, we’re going to have a baby. Thank you so much.”
Harry walks and walks, his thoughts swirling around his head, finally settling as if tired of running around aimlessly. He can’t remember the last time he had the castle all to himself.
“I might have accidentally picked up a dodgy magical artifact with my bare hands whilst clearing out the Dolohov safehouse,” Harry confesses, grimacing.
Harry’s finger tentatively moves to Malfoy’s cheek, wiping away a tear. He brings it to his lips and lets the saltiness burn on his tongue.
“Are you coming back with us?” Chloe says, looking hopeful. “I actually bought a little present for you, but I left it at home. You could come by to get it…”
A few students seemed surprised and enthusiastic at the idea of being able to skip lessons and study independently. Draco knew he would still be expected to attend every single one of them. The terms of his probation were clear.
“What?” Harry asks, nearly shouting. Ron looks hurt, but Harry’s stomach is in painful knots, his hands a sweaty mess as he feels his heart thumping in his chest.
“I also booked an appointment with a Mind-Healer,” Harry adds, his cheeks flushed. “I think I need some help.”
“I guess I’ll see you on Monday, then,” he mutters, and Harry Disapparates with a curt goodbye. It’s only when he steps through the Floo and Kreacher comments on how marvellous he looks that Harry realises he’s still wearing Malfoy’s robes. That he’s left his clothes at the Manor, and he has tacitly accepted Malfoy’s present.
“Yes, but they look used and damaged now,” Draco says, grey eyes locking with green. Harry suddenly doesn’t know if they’re talking about books anymore.
Or maybe it was the first time they ended up in bed together. It felt so inevitable at that point, after all the time they’d spent gravitating around each other, trying to avoid the reporters, refusing to give a reason why they had left the Aurors. They ended up without any idea what to do with their lives, sitting on Harry’s sofa side-by-side with a handful of brochures produced by Hermione. Harry still remembers that night so clearly, the way Draco whispered in the crook of his neck that he had wanted to touch him for so long. The curve of Draco’s spine under Harry’s fingertips, his trembling hands, the way he kissed him with such abandon, the smell of his skin and the moans that escaped his lips every time Harry kissed and touched and claimed him as his.
“Sorry, but I promised Malfoy I would help him with a difficult volume on cooking spells this evening,” Harry says, and he finds the other Aurors suddenly staring at him.
Harry nods and then he pries himself from the spot where he’s been rooted for the past ten minutes. He bids his farewell and then disappears through the Floo.
The blond seems to think for a while, studying him, and then his eyes open wide as he points a finger at him.
“I’m not spying on him!” Harry says, outraged, feeling his cheeks heat up. “I just want to help him, that’s all.”
“Have patience, you troglodyte,” Malfoy says when he notices the disappointed expression on Harry’s face. They wait in silence as the tea brews, whilst Harry has a look at the contents of the pantry, checking which ingredients are available and making mental plans for lunch.
stayed,” Malfoy replies, taking a seat on his usual sofa and staring at Harry. “No one has set foot in his room since the war. The Aurors are afraid he might have left something nasty behind, some kind of trap.”
“Eat your own, and don’t you dare take mine, you Gryffindor menace!” Draco warns, looking affronted as he glares at him under pale eyebrows. His hair is even lighter than it used to be, and there’s a sprinkle of freckles on his face. His pale skin is so sensitive that he tends to get sunburnt, so Draco is always covered in sun cream. Harry likes helping him put it on his back before they leave for the beach, letting his fingers run across pale skin as Draco relaxes under him.
“Sorry,” Ron says apologetically, disentangling himself from Harry and letting Draco take his place on the sofa.
“No, I’m not accepting any jobs abroad anymore,” Draco replies, “it’s about my medical check-up with Pansy.”
“We could skive off the club,” Harry says, tracing Draco’s top lip with his tongue, making him moan. “I have my cloak and the Gryffindor eighth-year dorms will be empty at this time of day. I could smuggle you in.”
And Harry’s okay with it, really. He tries to tell himself at least once a week that he’s fine. He has his friends, a job that takes up most of his time and energy, a godson that he loves to bits and a house that still feels too big and dark and that constantly needs fixing.
“Draco?” he calls and the blonde stands in front of him, looking dishevelled and tired, dark circles under his eyes and a worried expression on his face.
“Maybe you should ask for Hermione’s help,” Ron suggests as he’s busy playing chess with Neville. It’s a Friday afternoon and the Gryffindor common room is loud and cheerful, and all Harry wants to do is just throw his bloody essay in the fire and join his friends.
“Don’t eat too much gelato, otherwise you will get a stomach ache,” Draco warns, but Harry tries to steal some of his instead, making Draco huff indignantly.
,” Page casts, his eyebrows furrowed. He shuts the trunk and then holds his hand out to Draco. “Your wand.”
“Ha ha, very funny,” he says, but then he realises that the exact same scribble has appeared on the piece of parchment he’s holding. “Wait, what?”
“You must be mad,” Draco concludes, letting his fingers sneak under Harry’s robes, needing to feel his bare skin against his palm.
“Have you packed?” he asks Draco, and the blond sneers at him, sitting on the bed. His back is tense and stiff. Harry watches as he unbuttons the front of his robes, revealing a milky-white neck covered with a long scar slithering up and ending abruptly just below his chin. Draco follows his gaze and holds it for a few seconds.
“I wanted to,” he interrupts him. “Now get your elegant arse downstairs before the stasis charm runs out. I’m still crap at them wandless.”
Harry knows things are hard for all of them, that Fred’s death is too hard to deal with. It is a void that can’t be filled. He doesn’t know what to do or to say, but he still takes his own empty plate and joins Molly in the kitchen. The soapy sponges are already at work in the sink, washing the plates and pans with Molly’s magic. Harry moves slowly behind her, trying to make enough noise not to scare her with his presence.
Besides, he doesn’t want to upset George, who’s been barely eating and is a shadow of his former self.
“Well, I refuse to work on the weekend,” Malfoy says, with an air of superiority. As if it was his choice to work on any other day of the week.
Harry tries to catch his breath, feeling the enormity of what they’ve just done, the panic suddenly starting to rise in his chest. He touched Malfoy. Does this count as sex?
“Yes, but I’ve wanted to kiss you since the day you sent me that drunk owl,” Harry replies, letting his honesty slip out in the darkness. Draco’s breath hitches.
“I think you should go to the Hospital Wing,” Marelli insists, but Harry is already stepping away, going back to his desk.
September rolled into October and Draco found himself wondering when Potter had become “Harry” in his head. When the scrawny little git had become a taciturn young man, his green eyes darker than they were before the war. He thought about all those months without seeing him, after spending six years constantly looking at him, studying his every move and learning to decipher every single expression on Potter’s face. After months spent wondering where he was, if he was going to save them all from the abomination that had occupied his house and terrified him, he had finally caught a glimpse of Potter’s disfigured face at the Manor and he had recognised him immediately (how could he not have?). And then in the final battle, Potter was a wreck, all skin and bones, long hair and a stubble, a manic look on his face when he finally defeated the Dark Lord.
“You wouldn’t be able to leave the house. Besides, the Ministry will never allow me to,” Draco replies, averting his gaze, his eyebrows creased. He stands up and starts putting his clothes on, leaving Harry sitting on the bed, feeling like an idiot and missing Draco’s warm and soft skin.
“You need to leave,” Draco whispers, fastening Harry’s cloak around his neck and handing him his wand. “There’s a pub in town that has a Floo connection. If you appar-“
“Skeeter’s fault,” Harry grumbles. “She declared that I need a girlfriend for Christmas. I wish they would leave me alone.”
Something bigger that has been growing inside him, like a vine that has gently wrapped around his heart, merging with it.
“You’re going to ruin your expensive trousers like that,” Harry says, trying to gracefully sit down, but feeling like a beached whale instead. “Oof, I’m a bloody planet!”
“I…” he’s trying to figure out a way to describe his relationship with Malfoy (former adolescence nemesis?), when he hears a distinctive gasp.
It kind of worked and then it didn’t, because it still hurt like hell. Draco winced in pain, thinking that the potions were not strong enough for this, and Potter cast the spell again and again, until he mended all of his broken bones, one by one.
Once he’s there, he concentrates on the jumps he needs to do to get to Wiltshire. He apparates to Leeds station, where he’s been once with Ron after the War. Then to Cambridge, in front of Hermione’s house. He thinks about Grimmauld Place and he gets to London, where he has a small break and drinks a cup of tea with Kreacher. He makes the last two jumps to Southampton station and then to the gates in front of Malfoy Manor.
Draco suddenly drops the book and notices him. His eyes open wide and he sits up, rolling down his left sleeve as Harry’s eyes catch a glimpse of his Dark Mark.
Draco’s fingers grab his arm when he’s still half-way inside the floo network and then pulls him straight in his arms. Harry stumbles, but the other man catches him and their lips collide in a searing kiss that leaves Harry weak in the knees and out of breath.
from his face and Harry inhales, admiring the lines on his pale skin, the way they make him look like a work of art.
“It’s not that I don’t trust you,” he states, because that’s the truth. He never thought he would be able to, not after what they’ve been through and their history, but he does trust Draco now. “I just…it’s complicated. It’s ancient magic that no one should have ever used. And I somehow got caught up in it because of a stupid prophecy.”
“You like to see me ugly?” It’s a mere whisper, but the pain and insecurity bubble to the surface of Draco’s words, making Harry shake his head and reach for his lips.
“What happened to Draco?” she asks, looking around the Hall. Ron hands her a copy of the Prophet, and both Slytherins swear out loud as their eyes land on the photo.
“I’d rather not,” he had said, forcing him to take a walk in the gardens, their steps on the gravel loud and surreal, until Potter had come to a stop and had taken the wand out, handing it to him without a word.
Harry feels tears prickling the corners of his eyes as he stares at Draco, hands in his lap, looking down.
On Saturday he’s a bundle of nerves and Hermione continues asking what’s going on with him, but he keeps on saying that he’s fine. They meet up with Ron again and then after lunch he excuses himself, saying that he wants to give them a chance to be together. They both blush and he sneaks out of the Three Broomsticks and then into the Hog’s Head. Aberforth looks at him like a grumpy goat.
“I know you went to the Manor,” Hermione says on Wednesday evening, “and I’ve pretty much figured out the reason why. I just don’t understand why you won’t tell me yourself.”
“how can I help you?” Harry spun around and came face to face with a very pale handsome man with dark hair wearing old styled robes and a cape “I am Sanguini, the owner of this establishment” The most notable features were the slightly pointy canines and red eyes … according to the book on magical creatures he read this man was a vampire …
Dumbledore paced his office both seriously pissed and in a panic. He was pissed because he paid Molly good money to have Ginny seduce Potter, but the little wench ended up in the wrong house! The panic was because he realized he screwed up big time by telling everyone that Potter was sick! Anything else would’ve been better, right?
Blaise rolled his eyes “well you aren’t helping” he commented as he leaned back on the couch in the common room.
The healer smiled on the outside hiding the fact that she was nervous, “I’d prefer fewer people involved so rumors don’t spread and, besides, there needs to be others watching all the other students. So for now, it’s just you and me acting as guardians to these ladies.” She explained reasonably, but while they were sound arguments they weren’t her main concern. The main issue was whether or not the other professors were under potions as well. Severus no doubt had to make a batch of the potion that removes the loyalty potion when he made Minerva’s, but Dumbledore’s obvious scheming made getting the potion to Minerva urgent. Now she had to get Severus deliver the rest of the potions to the professors.
“the one smart thing he did was not potion my Slytherins otherwise I would’ve noticed much sooner” Severus said at least giving Lockhart credit for knowing to not cross a potion master’s students. If any of his snakes started acting oddly he’d know right away. the other houses aren’t as observant or as resistant to the allure of fame so it be harder to pinpoint if a potion was involved. Lockhart was a Hogwarts student in the past so he knew how the houses played off each other and no doubt used that to his advantage “but you’re correct. He is a fool who needs to be taken down. Cache and Poppy will handle that though. We have a pressing matter to tend to at Gringotts”
“Sanguini has cells in the basement levels. A werewolf can rent one for a night during the full moon or rent a bedroom and cell combo. The cells are charmed to handle the wild werewolves even at their worst” Trocar blinked as if he remembered something and pulled out the item in his pocket that was connected to the gold chain revealing it to be a gold pocket watch “it’s nearly midnight! You should be in bed”
Frank snorted “I am not a mutt and though this is only the third day we’ve been together I can tell you actually like me”
A sigh slipped passed the potion master’s lips as he recalled the disgust his apprentice has for his fame or to be more exact the idiots after it … something he foolishly believed that Harry Potter loved just over a week ago “in away you are … do you intend to tell Draco?”
“you had to do so much and we aren’t even at the part where you escaped … was that really Voldemort you met? Dumbledore only announced that you slipped down the stairs doing the brave something that earned you, Ron and Hermione those last minute house points” Neville commented.
First he made and ate a large lunch, cleaned his cauldron and stored his potions on the counter. He gave the kneazles some food before jotting down a quick list of each ingredient he took from Snape and the amounts. Of course he added some other ingredients for potions that might prove useful, like the dreamless sleep potion. That would be good to keep the Dursleys out of his hair.
A light blush graced Neville’s cheeks at the kind offer “that’s fine. You were going through so much-”
“dying?” Severus gasped, his usually calm mask shattered. Did the child he vowed to protect really come so close to death when he was brewing a potion or drinking a shot of whiskey? Guilt hit the potion master like a lightening bolt …
Severus couldn’t stop the blush that spread across his cheeks nor the flutter in his heart so he leaned up and kissed the vampire ”we’ll see. Right now I actually am busy”
Cache held his wrist firmly down to the armrest, while subtly placing his thumb over the snake’s head and whispered the incantation to reveal the tracker, which he refreshed his memory on this morning. With the now green glow coming from the skull’s right eye socket Cache paused “I moved a tracker from my body before and it was a bit unpleasant, but that wasn’t the problem. I knew the person who placed it on me would feel the difference if he saw me and couldn’t feel the bond the tracker makes. With that in mind do you have anyone who will notice if it’s gone?”
“I can do that. I know how to make those” he said as he set the finished potion aside to cool “it’s done” Poppy got up and peered into the cauldron …
Not long after Neville left the next morning Harry pulled out his experimental potion and applied it to several more scars …
“that’s such a disturbing thing to tell a child” Narcissa said completely disgusted with the muggles’ behavior.
“this isn’t working” Harry sighed as he leaned back in his chair and put his pencil down. It has been five days since the Dursleys left and he hasn’t found out a way to get to Gringotts without possibly getting caught. He has been writing down theories, but nothing added up right “I need an extra ingredient” he musings were broken as the two Kneazles bolted down the stairs playing with a bucket. One of the buckets that the Dursleys so
The twin with the gold streak in her hair took a little of the salve on her index finger and gentle wiped it on the long jagged scar. It was cold and made Harry shiver a little, but the little boy could feel the tight retracted skin ease almost instantly. Feeling the strange prickling sensation that followed made Harry look at his scar and his eyes widened as he saw the scar fade away.
(finding your corpse would’ve made my day) Severus thought bitterly as he did a subtle look around the room. It was a guess, but he suspected Dumbledore preformed a ritual … or at least tried to since it clearly failed “yes, but sadly I had no clue where the explosion actually took place so I had to look around and everyone knows it’s unwise to floo into an unknown situation. It could make things worse. We should leave, I believe the train pulled up. Sadly I don’t have any burn salve or I would offer it” he lied.
“you saw Gloria …” Aster said more to Brian who set out some of his mini homemade pizzas. She liked Gloria, but the crocodile isn’t someone you have meet without advanced warning even for full grown adults who claim to be tough.
Best case scenario is that he’ll end up with blue eyes, blonde hair and something to remove the fake color. The fourth vial will is skin color, but he will need to stick his finger in for that one.
“five or six?! That’s preposterous!” Poppy yelled, but she and all the now fussy Hogwarts professors were rendered silent as Julian and Draco decided to preform a spell. The spell they chose was the light spell and didn’t just cast one wordlessly and wandlessly, but they cast hundreds without words or wands. Dozens of glowing white orbs were flying out of their palm and they were staying in certain places as if the boys had some control over the orbs, which no one thought was possible “w-wandless?”
Cache nodded and rolled up his left sleeve revealing several scars missing “yes. Light that was refracted through some diamonds. I checked each time. The potion heals the nerve damage. It’s amazing, but there are limits. I tried to put it on a paper cut. The cut didn’t heal any faster, but I can’t say for sure if it did nothing. I applied it to the rest of my scars so they should be gone tomorrow … Trocar refuses to let me to try drinking it. He took my quartz cauldron captive until I find another guinea pig” the blonde sulked and settled back in his seat to work on the rune sequence on he table.
“please tell me I stole that” Harry muttered to himself as he skimmed through the books “YES!” he cheered and fished the large and advanced potions volume out of the stack of books. Thank Merlin he raided the library!
A large dark blue luggage bag and a matching duffle bag caught Harry’s eyes and he put both in his cart.. Then he found a green bag with a black cord that he can use to make into his own bottomless bag and in the cart it went.
Cache leaned over and whispered “be honest, do I look that bad?” he said quietly as the entire hall erupted with whispers and chatter … Severus snorted in amusement, but didn’t respond …
(he better not be good looking) Draco thought as a hint of jealously reared it’s ugly head at the way Julian spoke about seeing Tom, but he didn’t spend too long looking at the green eyes that were focused on the orb for Quirrell groaned getting everyone’s attention “so what should we do with him?” Draco asked knowing he had something to do with Julian’s discovery of the last horcruxes and didn’t like it for some reason that seemed to be jealousy towards Tom.
“that’s perfect” Harry snickered and emptied all the food he wanted out of the frig and pantry and put it in his bottomless bag. Finally he looked at his three pets who each looked amused at his actions “what? I had a lot to vent” he shrugged. He knew neither the Dursleys or Ms. Figg will get out of this unscathed. By the time they get back all of the wizarding world will be after them in order to find the ‘Boy Who Lived’.
The goblins in charge of the Prince and Potter vaults continued asking question after question of Minerva to get every detail they could, “Thank you, Ms. McGonagall, for all your help and for supplying us with a pensieve of your memories. We will press charges immediately.” Griphook said as he took a few notes and signed the parchment next to his fellow goblin’s name.
"No … he would've known." Ron muttered in disbelief as he watched the man being taken away and not seeing a rat.
“ahhh it’s good to be home” said Petunia as they drove up to Ms. Figg’s home “it was lovely spending time with you Arabella”
A frown found its way to the potion master’s face “seeing auras …” he sighed as he recalled how the poor boy reacted to the simple scan at Gringotts. The runes were enough to scare the boy so he could only imagine how Julian felt when he woke up and suddenly saw auras … he must’ve been terrified.
To their surprise, they were made to immediately sit in the chairs that were awkwardly placed right in front of the door. Their seats were in the middle and the Wizengamot members were seated on either side. A couple goblins were standing only a bit farther in the room. As strange as the set up was it soon became clear why it was necessary. Everyone had to stay far away from the patient in the bed on the farthest side of the room.
Sophia frowned “I remember hearing that main fragments can be harder to remove if the wizard the soul fragment belonged to was very skilled with possession or the one being possessed has an unprotected mind”
The apprentice drew his willow wand and stood in a relaxed position. It was only a fraction of a second before Lockhart shouted the classic disarming spell. Cache was watching the wave from the spell approach and he allowed the weak spell to pull the wand from his hand. Despite the arrogant smirk on Hermione’s face Cache remained calm.
Stephen frowned glanced at the potion master as if asking permission before he explained. Severus wasn’t an idiot. He knew where this was going and nodded knowing Julian would learn this eventually “ok … Julian you made a good point. Lets first look at colors then the aura shape. Red was temper. Severus is easily angered by certain things and he is very strict, but this is where the shape comes in. You said his aura doesn’t fly around, but you do mean its more like a glow?” Julian nodded as he glanced at Severus almost nervously as the man would be mad at him “that’s good. The tight aura you see, Julian, is a sign that he has very good control. Severus here won’t go flying off the handle no matter how mad he gets. Your Daddy isn’t so controlled, but he’s very laid back. Now what about me?”
"Oh right." Frank chuckled and slowly frowned as Trocar's anxiety visibility increased with each passing moment. "Trocar, you'll be fine-"
“impossible? Who here has had a case of accidental magic?” several of the students raised their hands in response to Cache’s question “isn’t accidental magic, magic without the use of a wand? We’ve all used
“most of the time yes, however potions can find many things that a spell can’t. People don’t use potions often because it takes a full month to brew and they can involve very complex procedures. Only masters can do it consistently and that’s only if you have the timing for the moon perfect. It’s effect, but difficult so it isn’t used” Severus smirked slightly as the gears in his apprentice’s head spinning no doubt looking for a means to fix that issue “that is where we will start then. A full moon is close so the timing is perfect. Poppy mentioned that she has you from 8:00 to 1:00 on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays so we’ll meet in Diagon Alley Wednesday at 7:30. Where do you live? I want to see your set up first”
"Yeah." Hermione pondered a minute to recall the details that were released so far. "The details made public said that a magical blowout is where all of a witch or wizard's magic expands quickly before suddenly being forced out by the pressure and that's what Dumbledore suffered. It was implied that it could've been deliberate, but everyone was ruled out, right?"
After thoroughly cleaning away years worth of blood, feces, grime and urine from his body, face and hair a few more injuries were revealed. She immediately began applying a few different salves to a series of cuts, scrapes, bruises, bug bites, blisters, oozing sores, angry welts and to her horror cigarette burns.
The potion master was furious though he skillfully hid it “it seems the incompetence lies with your professor with your professor, but no matter. I will be teaching you from now on. Do you have any ideas on where you would like to start?”
Trocar grinned “isn’t it great! This’ll be like a stunner to the chest for Dumbledore! Frank found it-Oh right! Remus Lupin is back, but first, Frank smelled Remus and went to see what they were doing in the Three Broomsticks and found this! Since muggle newspapers don’t have magic photos it’s safe to copy them and several of the werewolves did and snuck them into every place imaginable. I even took one to Lucius”
Once the food came Harry pulled two food bowls out of his bottomless bag and put the meat in it to distract the kneazles “Poppy said that she wanted me to meet someone who was considering teaching me potions, would that be you Mr. Snape?” Cache asked as he set the food bowls down and let the kneazles start eating.
The goblin manager of the Potter accounts went to another office and went in “Razorback I have an offer for your clients, the Malfoys” the other goblin looked irritated until Griphook started explaining …
"Ruby Gro." The casually dressed dark skinned woman with long gray hair said with smile, "I'm Sirius' mind healer obviously, but I came to talk to you."
Frantic scratching from above alerted him to Hedwig’s attempts to get to his side, but he couldn’t move … hell, he could barely breathe let alone get up to the access panel. The attic panel dropped to the floor and Harry heard something flutter down to him. Soft feathers caressed his skin offering a great feeling of comfort.
“Cache … how would you like to learn under me? I could find someone to train you in potions too if you want” Poppy asked, this boy was a natural healer. You don’t let a chance like this slip through your fingers!
Without another word he kicked the large bread loaf into the room. As they scrambled for it he spelled the waste filled bucket empty and used a water spell to fill the water bucket with water before shutting the door …
“who the fuck is Julian?! Where’s Harry? What did you do to him?!” Sirius screamed s he tried to grab Severus. This time Remus was faster and Sirius was struggling against the werewolf’s grip in no time.
"Slow increase in unpredictability, mental decline, drastic physical changes … His soul was broken wasn't it." Lucius snapped, tossing the book to the floor as his anger rose, "That book said there's a treatment. He's alive-"
The goblin nodded “actually yes. I would’ve discussed this with you before, but you had far more pressing matters to deal with first” Harry sighed in understanding. With getting away from abusive muggles and trying to set up a life away from Dumbledore’s plots he was busy “first, your godfather, Sirius Black. The man was another friend of your father, but he is in Azkaban for killing several muggles along with his best friend Peter Pettigrew and betraying your parents to the dark lord since he was their Secret Keeper” explained Griphook.
Trocar came flying down the stairs and pulled Harry into a hug “IT’S NOT A DATE! He’s too young!” the vampire glared at the werewolf who was laughing uproariously at the outburst.
He smiled “this way” they went over to the receptionist’s desk in the lobby and looked at the medi-witch seated there “excuse me, I was wondering if I could get a test done to see if I’m a natural healer”
“she’s a snake!” Ron snapped angrily as if it explains everything and in his mind it did. He wasn’t just seeing his sister in a different house he was seeing the chance at fame and fortune being pissed away because his sister betrayed them for the snakes. She was supposed to be in Gryffindor and marry Potter so they could have all the money they wanted. It was infuriating to have all that work befriending Potter turn to worthless dust without even a knut to show for it! Ginny ruined her and her family’s futures and she wasn’t getting it!
What happened during the weeks since Dumbledore discovered that Harry was gone? well the answer lies in the for sale sign the vampires and werewolves used when abducting the Dursleys … it was a very real sale …
“WHAT?” Severus snapped once the minister left the room. He respectfully took the wills and read them through carefully. There it was in black and white. Peter Pettigrew was the secret keeper and both wills say Julian was never supposed to end up in the Dursley’s care. All the names of those who could care for Julian were unable because they were dead, in prison or, in the Longbottoms’ case, in St. Mungo’s. He may have hated Sirius Black and knew being in his care wouldn’t have been good for Julian, but the arrogant blockhead didn’t deserve getting sent to Azkaban. It will be annoying seeing the jerk again, but it wasn’t right to leave him there “Alice Longbottom signed each as a witness, but … no, he had to be involved somehow. Dumbledore was close to each of these people who could’ve cared for you so it would too coincidental if he knew nothing about this”
Harry watched as Sanguini pulled out a necklace that a simple green stone hanging from a silver chain. The vampire placed the necklace around the tense potion master’s neck an fastened it and with care pulled the black locks away from the chain while letting his fingertips caress the soft skin earning a shiver “ummmm … I’m going to step out for a minute” Harry said feeling like he was intruding on an intimate moment.
“you guys should go then. I’ll handle the Gringotts arrangements honey” Narcissa said as she leaned up and kissed Lucius.
“we’re just trying to get to know Cache a little that’s all” Draco said subtly jabbing Blaise in the rib to keep him from saying anything embarrassing.
“pervert” Severus panted breathlessly as he tried to recover from the kiss. He pressed his fingers to his lips feeling a little saddened that those other lips were gone, but he shook himself out of his daze and went to get ready for the day. When he left his bedroom he found Cache sitting in the living room of his living quarters waiting for him “you brat”
“this came out quickly. Lucius works fast” Cache mumbled just loud enough for the potion master next to him to hear as students filed into the room.
Armel frowned, "I was taking account of everyone's symptoms after they returned … they tried to turn Dumbledore."
“as they should be” Severus said as he came in with Poppy. A slight blur and no sign of Trocar was all he need to guess that the vampire hid in his bedroom again most likely to avoid the St. Mungo’s healer “looking into the eyes of a basilisk is not a minor concern“
“yes and I will take you up on that offer” Severus said sternly. He needed to know exactly what was going on so he stepped into the floo with Brian and Julian. When the classic flames died down he saw that his was in the living room of a tree house like building in the middle of a forest. Brian went to put Julian to bed as Severus sat at the dining room table in the kitchen section. When Brian returned he finally asked the question he wanted answered “what happened to Julian?”
*crash* the loud sound was followed by a pained mew that had Harry abandon his potions and run towards the commotion. Lyra had crashed into the china cabinet and a platter crashed onto her.
“she’s just advertising for a friend honey. Pay it no mind” Petunia smiled and kissed her son’s head. Vernon got home minutes later and Harry served dinner. He was made to watch them as they polished off the plates of food. Once the dishes were cleaned and put away Vernon dragged Harry up to the cell.
“that makes sense” Brian chuckled after they flooed home. It took a while for Julian to accept his powers and he will need more practice, but he can tell what’s important “I’m proud of you Julian. You handled yourself very well” Brian said as he picked up his son “how about we go on a small trip before school starts. Would seeing a beach down the ways be nice?”
Cache opened his eyes revealing green orbs instead of the fake blue he had just minutes ago “well my eyesight is still sharp, but … I’m colorblind again”
"Damn Draco." Harry hissed as Draco wrapped his legs around his waist accidentally brushing their cocks together. Well, it was an accident the first time, but Draco moaned and continued grinding his cock against Harry's lustfully. The pleasure was racing through their bodies making it very hard for Harry to carry them to the bedroom.
“Severus made the offer meaning he is responsible for handling the payment” the twins said in perfect sync as they held Severus close.
degree burn I got helping someone in Gringotts” he admitted and sighed as Severus gave him a look silently ordering him to let him see his hand “it’s not that bad” he said as he held his hand out.
Severus stood up and gave Ron a withering look “Cache gave me his memory of the event and everyone saw Ginny’s injuries so, yes, it was as bad as it was described. Ginny told my apprentice and myself exactly what happened”
Harry just rubbed his arm … there were going to be some deep bruises there … before he started cooking. Sizzling from the butter in a pan was as far as he got before he heard grunting from outside. The young wizard’s heart plummeted as he watched Vernon drag his trunk in the house and his Aunt Petunia open the cupboard door. With a loud thump Vernon tossed the trunk in the cupboard and locked it.
With all the portraits frozen to prevent witnesses he began a ritual of his own. The headmaster held a little curly black hair he found in the Dursleys’ cupboard over the rune sequence and dropped it …
“chores …” Brian sighed, he didn’t want to give the boy chores, but this would be a good chance to start good habits “you only have to worry about recovering and taking your medicine for now, but afterwards you will have to keep your room tidy, doing your best in school and listening to the rules. Rule 1, is to tell me if you’re in pain or hungry. Rule 2, is for both of us and it’s to tell the truth. Understand?”
Cache frowned “runes are tricky- … oops! Hold that thought” the boy hopped up to stir his potion not seeing the vampire roll his crimson eyes. The young wizard didn’t seem to realize that memorizing the entire alphabet of runes in a few hours was not something you call ‘tricky’. Trocar knew Cache will advance quickly in this subject.
“fine with me” Percy huffed fed up with his little brother’s behavior and just let go of Ron’s robes, which resulted in Ron tumbling to the floor.
to be there. She might have already been there when I arrived” he said and calmed down when the two kneazles nuzzled his hands.
Cache subtly twitched in irritation and gave the growling kneazles curled up at his feet where they where out of view of the students a few calming pets (well that’s definitely a form of payback if I ever saw one) he thought dryly. Originally Cache was only supposed to help in the potion classes where Severus needed a second pair of eyes and help Poppy, but to visit other classes on top of it … well he had his work cut out for him that’s for sure and Severus and Poppy couldn’t say otherwise because they had to pretend to be loyal to Dumbledore. It was still clear they were not happy. However Cache wasn’t too annoyed by this move. How could he be when the old fool basically just gave him permission to wander the school unsupervised?
“What’s your cub’s name?” Greyback asked as he summoned both of their wands to his free hand so they couldn’t get them back.
In a cozy daze, he felt himself, as odd as it sounded, being placed inside something, but it was so nice and for once he didn't feel like he was floating out of control, so he didn't care so much. The best change was the little voice of the same child that seemed to come from all around him and, more importantly, the child sounded happy now. It made him happy as if he wasn't alone and he constantly tried to move closer to the voice. Sadly, despite the sweet voice telling him he was safe he still felt broken in way. However, even that eventually changed when one by one other little, but very familiar, entities came into the space he was in.
“ill? … if one rumor got out it would be mayhem. I know a couple reporters who’d love to see what they can find” Lucius said with an evil smirk before going up to write a few letters …
Ron smirked feeling great about finally ditching the ghost and it only got better. After flooing into the wizarding bank, they were met by a goblin and personally escorted to a room. He felt very important and loved every minute of it.
Brian smiled and kissed Julian’s forehead “nothing is wrong. You just gained a rare trait from my family” he said calmly. It just figures the child that has a major trust issue with magic suddenly gains the ability to see auras …
For once in Petunia’s life she was thrilled to meet a freak even if she couldn’t figure out why it was so easy to talk to him. Vernon even took the day off to get these papers signed. Now they were just waiting and not for very long …
"That was an interesting day … I'm tired." Cache sighed, but he didn't get a chance to sit for someone knocked at his door. Of course, he expected Trocar or Armel or Greyback with a panicked cry for a babysitter and sleep, but to his surprise it was a sheepish Remus.
The young child screwed his nose up at the smell, but set his wolf in the seat next to him , took the cup and he gulped it down “yucky” Brian laughed and pushed the food closer to the boy who was eager to eat something to get the taste out.
"A job slip?" Cache observed as he looked the slip over. "You both wish to work part time at Hogwarts during school and over breaks?"
“I’m going with the basic Nerve Tonic as a name. I hope the testing process goes alright. The reaction time is a week at the full dose” Cache remarked as the medi-witch checked that his paperwork as complete and had him stamp them and the box with his ring.
The only real difference was that no one knew Cache. No expectations. No lies. No famous scar. No father who apparently left a bad impression for people to put on him. Cache was a blank slate.
Griphook nodded seriously “that would not be good considering the type of trackers used have a death curse attached. I’ll have a healer meet us with some pain relievers in case they’re needed” the goblin scribbled down a note and sent it fluttering away “now lets go meet them”
Trocar saw Harry avoid eye contact for a second in a silent sign of nervousness and pouted “you know you can talk to us. What is it about this that bothers you? Just because we can’t stop the news doesn’t mean we can’t change some things so you can get feel more comfortable” the vampire said feeling really bad about letting himself and the others get carried away and not taking Harry’s thoughts into consideration.
The twins Brian is afraid of are the potions teachers for all years and they also assist in sex ed to present birth control potions … they can be pranksters too when they are mad and their main pet peeve is when someone they know seeks out potions from someone else …
“Trocar has an odd sense of humor” Frank muttered as he flicked the mockingbird making the painted bird caw and fly away revealing a door knob. He set the loaf of bread on the ground and grabbed the doorknob and turned it. With a click a hidden door swung showing a hidden room … a very dark hidden room where five prisoners were glaring at him as he slowly ate his tasty cake …
“yes … Harry placed the wards and charms for us in the lab so we can floo there to help and not have to worry about sunlight. We will be there when Severus is freed. For the potion master’s sake he better have a good response and come to Harry’s side … Merlin, I wish just one of us could go with him!” Trocar whined sadly.
“honestly I didn’t consider that … I don’t really want a sum for helping with this. Perhaps I could simply ask for a favor in the future” said Harry,
Draco burst of laughing, "So you and your friends are vouching for Harry Potter's existence. An existence that's separate than Cache's and pretending to tutor Harry Potter allows you to spend time with Sirius and Remus without suspicion … that's actually quite clever."
Trocar"s eyes flicked over to the werewolf for a split second before finishing packing his case filled with papers for class, "We discussed this-"
Sanguini actually had to let them in, because Greyback and Mike couldn't wake up to get to the door they were sleeping so deeply. The same happened with Jenny, which, of course, worried Harry at first. He was scared someone suffered a complication so was damn relieved they were just exhausted.
“yep … something about a prodigy apprentice healer that is approaching healer status faster than anyone” Trocar chuckled as Harry blushed modestly. Problem is the vampire only told part of the rumors. The other part was the ‘smoking hot apprentice healer whom everyone wants a sample of his bedside manners’ …like hell he’ll tell Harry that perverts are after him “oh, Harry you have an owl”
“we’ll go with you” Severus said when he saw that the goblin didn’t comment when the three dark creatures followed Harry out the door. The Malfoys gave hand written permission signed in blood to Griphook and they went down the hall to join the young wizard and the creatures. Even Draco who seemed to be in a state of denial and had yet to look Cache in the eyes.
"We'll handle that … you've done so much already … too much." Alice cried softly as she hugged him. Finally, she slightly let him go to look at him properly. "You may look different, but I always knew." She sniffled brushing away some tears. "You told us a lot, but not about this. How did you do this?" She asked playing with a lock of the fake blonde hair.
So with the budget in mind he put a pack of eyedroppers in the cart and left to pay for everything. After passing another aisle he saw some pet things and wondered if he should get his kneazles a pet bed. With everything paid for he put all the smaller items in the new blue suitcase and duffle bag and carried everything out since he couldn’t cram them through the bottomless bag’s small opening. As he reached a secluded corner he pulled out the invisibility cloak and covered himself and his luggage with it.
Dumbledore looked at the pile of donations on his desk with a smirk “there’s enough here to get my castle built, but I need to do this carefully”
Dumbledore grinned at the floor of his office where a new rune circle was drawn “just a little more time and I’ll at least have a golem to hide the brat’s disappearance” he said. This had to be done now for the Hogwarts Express will be arriving any second. It will be easy to say Potter missed the train. No one will find it weird not like if the boy never arrived at all …
Narcissa smiled hoping Cache had some closure “those creatures didn’t tell the boy about their … activities, right?” asked the Lady Malfoy who was feeling protective over the boy who has done so much for their family.
“green is a color that is close to blue, but I’m more grounded … I’m laid back, but really not the curious or adventurous sort like your Daddy. Swaying in an aura is a sign of control, but no where near the level of control Severus has. Are you ready to see your aura?” Stephen asked knowing the little boy probably wouldn’t want to see the aura around him. The boy was clearly trying not to look at his own body …
Sanguini looked amused as he saw the rather relaxed boy had no fear of him. Once on the top floor the vampire pulled out a key and opened the door to apartment 405 and showed Cache around.
“yes … and Harry will continue to know nothing, understand Severus?” Sanguini hummed as he gazed into the shorter wizard’s eyes. With the distinct impression of being hunted by something powerful and realizing he left his wand in Harry’s apartment Severus nodded.
Wait … That’s it! The books! If there was a spell to unlock then there should be one to lock! All he had to do was get out of here, get the cupboard open, take the bottomless bag, find the spell that locks and lock himself back in before anyone notices. He had to move fast.
Harry sat there in the dark pondering what to do ignoring his stomach growling for food. All he needed to do was wait for them to leave really. Problem is he didn’t know when they were supposed to leave. It had to be soon if they were packed so there was no point in risking getting caught just to make potions. He should just wait …
“I have been around a long time. People can be easy to read after so long and you’re wrong” Sanguini purred as he pulled Severus closer and was pleased to hear a soft gasp from the potion master “I have no interest in having my fun and leaving … I have no interest in using you and breaking your heart … what I want is to be with you and only you for no one I’ve ever met fascinates me like you. Your scent is intoxicating” he said as he nuzzled Severus’s neck “the taste of your skin is divine” he said before nipping the sensitive skin earning a moan “every sound that pours out of that mouth of yours is like music to me including anything related to your sharp wit … mmm and of course your moans” Sanguini chuckled as his hands slipped under the robe to caress a bare backside getting those delicious moans from the potion master who was becoming more and more flushed “and the sight of you is breathtaking no matter what you believe about your attractiveness … I want you”
"Is it true that Gringotts gives out payment plans for muggle-burns?" The young witch asked blatantly ignoring the goblin's question.
Two cups of Darjeeling and a plate full of ginger nuts appeared on a small, round table. The table slid itself, abruptly, into the gap between Harry and Teddy’s chairs. James’s plate also refilled with biscuits, and his teacup started steaming again.
It was a strange sensation—wanting to contradict Malfoy, out of routine politeness, while at the same time agreeing the man had a point. He
Harry thought there were flaws in that logic, but he couldn’t nail them down. Instead, he grumbled as they made their way back to the table, “Only Slytherins would invent proper methods for loathing people.”
Harry sent a final Patronus to Ron, “Sorry, mate. I know Mione wants to debrief tomorrow afternoon, but I have to run up to Hogwarts for the weekend. James is in some kind of trouble. I’ll Floo you when I know more. Can you send an Owl to Luna’s office for me, care of Sol Eisenberg? I’m supposed to meet with him tomorrow afternoon. Talk soon!”
Millie looked thoughtful. “That what happened to Marietta Edgecombe? In fifth year? I heard that was your fault.”
Harry watched his spine stiffen, his shoulders grow sharper. He’d spent so much of his life watching Draco Malfoy, and then so much trying
“Powdered unicorn horn in the Grand Wiggenweld Potion,” he rasped, without looking up from his phone. “It reacts too much like sodium bicarbonate. Can’t risk it.”
“Godric’s saggy balls, Malfoy, I know that!” Harry gripped his fringe in one fist, then let go. Malfoy tracked the action with his eyes. “She’s my sister-in-law, you cynical tit. I know she’s clever. She was a Triwizard Champion!”
Pansy met her gaze steadily. Her cheeks were pale and her eyes shone too brightly. “The Dark Lord would know, Hermione. He always knew.”
Hestia Pérez, who worked in accounts for the Ministry, trailed in shortly after. Flora looked relieved to see her sister. Millie ordered at the counter for them both.
“Draco was a big part of your life during school. You devoted so much attention to him.” Catching his withering glare, she only smiled again. “Really, Harry. You always were a bit obsessed.”
“There are prefects to help you find your way around,” Harry said. “If Artie Sorts into Gryffindor, she’ll have lots of help figuring it out.”
“Merlin knows,” Teddy shrugged. “Should’ve been here by now, but maybe therapy’s run late? You could send Prongs over to check with Luna. He’s been a right arse about keeping me in the loop, lately.”
Ginny was sure that people wouldn’t understand, would question their commitment to each other. She didn’t want to look like a martyr, or a gold digger, or a Chosen One fanatic. She didn’t want to answer invasive questions about their bedroom.
Speaking of Scorpius, he told me to tell you that his mum wants to schedule a visit at Christmas. She thinks Scorp will feel better at her new house if I can come for a day or two, just to make things normal. I think she might invite Rose, too. Can I go? Just overnight? I don’t think she means over Christmas Day or anything.
“Well. Fine, but it’s all silly superstition,” Mione said. “Luck! Divination! There’s another Friday the 13
In general, Harry doesn't describe how people look in any detail. This is why Rowling could make the case for a canon black Hermione; in seven books of acquaintance, Harry never describes her skin tone. Asexuality is a spectrum (like all sexuality), and you'll get a very clear idea of how Harry's romantic and sexual drives function in this fanfic. That said, I'm not trying to create a "typical demisexual" character, because there is no such thing. Harry's difficulty seeing people objectively is personal to him. It's not BECAUSE he's demisexual, but it is RELATED TO his demisexuality.
Hestia cleared her throat a little too loud, drawing Harry’s eye. Hestia was Flora’s identical twin, but there was no chance of confusing them—Flora Bulstrode wore her long, chestnut hair naturally, while Hestia had dyed it a soft shade of pink.
There was a confused beat of silence on both sides of the loo door. Then Hermione said, “Well, that’s... lovely. Scorpius must be excited.”
“Not all magical ingredients can be substituted. Not without reducing the efficacy of the potion. Unicorn horn is unique in its ability to neutralize and purify Curses. You should know that, seeing as it’s second-year potions theory—”
“People started getting ill. Bad food, or not enough water, or the stress—who knows?” Millicent shifted an arm around the back of Flora’s chair, and her wife leaned back into it. “We only had nineteen upperclassmen with us. Most of the Ravenclaws and all of Gryffindor abandoned us, soon as McGonagall’s back was turned, to go back to the fighting. Weren’t many Hufflepuffs left at Hogwarts by then, ‘cept those newly-sorted. 208 little kids under the care of 15 Slytherins, three Ravenclaws, and Zacharias Smith.”
Teddy stuck his head out the back door to the garden, calling for Pellimore. The russet-and-cream barn owl swooped into the kitchen, shaking dew from her feathers as she landed on a twisty perch near the warm stove. “Hey lady,” Ted crooned, stroking her feathers. “Got to send a quick one to Wheezes. Want to visit Freddy?”
“‘Venery’ is a stupid word,” Harry huffed fondly, even though no one was around to hear it. Sort of. Almost no one.
“I know you do,” Harry said, blinking too much. “You thought about it already, I’m sure. But I didn’t—I didn’t want you to realize what it meant to see them, right there in front of everyone.”
“I’m very well, thank you.” She put a hand against her stomach, and Harry couldn’t help looking. He didn’t see any evidence of a baby bump yet; her dress was rather voluminous.
Harry stopped breathing. Opened his mouth. Shut it. Winky eyed him with caution, and her eyes were far too knowing. He clenched his fingers around his wand, and shoved the lion in his chest back down to the ground.
“Where does George wants us?” Harry asked, pulling off his outer robe and shrinking it to pocket-sized.
Harry wasn’t sure that was true, but arguing with Floo-Hermione was nearly as impossible as arguing with her in person. He managed to prop his head up on his fist and blink his eyes open wider. He tried on a smile.
One of the major criticisms of Rowling's work is that villain characters--or, more specifically, people Harry doesn't like--are described as ugly, while Harry's friends and comrades are not. Even when Harry is aware that a character should be good looking (think: Gilderoy Lockhart and Fleur Delacour), he never actually views them that way himself. He focuses on elements of their appearance which make them grotesque. When characters he loves really aren't attractive, objectively, he still describes their features in positive terms. Cho Chang is immediately attractive to Harry, but he finds her less beautiful as he gets to know her. Ginny doesn't get much description until after Harry develops romantic feelings. Snape is probably not a great looking guy, but he's also subject to Harry's biased point-of-view... So, who knows?
The storeroom teemed with bodies. Many of the heads were ginger, of course, with Molly and Arthur at opposite corners, directing traffic with their wands and booming voices. “That’s not the right chewing gum, Freddy, dear, you need the one that foams at the mouth!”
“But I won’t be,” Harry shook his head. “Hermione will be with me, and George and Angie. Audrey and Percy, I’m sure, and Fleur—”
The stocky woman pressed a bit at her scalp, between neat cornrows, in a gesture Harry privately thought of as Spinnet’s Stall. “It’s just... with the vote on increasing House-elf wage requirements, and the doxy infestation over in Limerick...”
“Draco isn’t Theodore,” he tells her softly. She refuses to flinch, but Harry reads it in her eyes anyway. Something’s sparking within. “I don’t know why he did this, but it wasn’t… it was only once. He doesn’t want anybody else.”
“Can I bring Ted?” When McGonagall’s eyebrow went up, he explained, “Teddy’s been helping a lot with James, since the accident. I think it’d help.”
Harry shook his head. “Jameson’s an excellent Auror. He wanted fieldwork, and he deserves it. We were lucky to hold onto him for as long as we did.”
, Pansy,” Harry spits. But he moves aside to let her step through, into the foyer of Grimmauld Place. Harry doesn’t ask how she knows, because she probably didn’t. Not for certain. Just another of her wildly-accurate guesses, confirmed before he took time to think it through. Pansy, fully-qualified witch, is just as much a viper as she’d ever been at school.
“That makes no sense,” Hermione said. “If he knew about the affair, why wouldn’t they divorce before now?”
Harry hasn’t sat down yet, and it feels a bit like being on trial. Pansy is perfectly dressed and perfectly calm, like a barrister, and Harry is nothing but wrinkly, unwashed guilt. He scrubbed and scrubbed at himself when he stumbled home last night, ran the shower until his skin was pink enough to hurt, but he doesn’t feel clean. He feels
Professor Tugwood’s sparkling eyes slid down the ward, taking in the curtained cubicle. Then they paused, just a moment, on Neville, before coming to rest on Harry. Her black eyebrows went up.
Harry knew it was a really very staggeringly bad idea to get drunk on the grounds of Hogwarts. He rarely drank, and for very good reason. But, then again: The world was made of Malfoys. He prodded his head with a finger, and it wobbled enough to trigger a ghoulish moan.
Angelina’s smile dimmed a little. “Merlin, yeah. Poor kid. Can you imagine doing that to your child?”
“I’ve never seen Malfoy look like an angel,” he said, woodenly. “Baby, or grown up, or anything.” Harry was sure that was true, and also not at all sure. It made his head hurt.
“Thank you,” Harry said, although he was never sure whether he was speaking to McGonagall, to the House-elves, or to Hogwarts itself.
“I’m not getting nearly as many passionate declarations as I expected,” Teddy mused. “Disappointing. I could’ve memorized the good lines to use on Victoire.”
“You’re right,” Harry told her, and Teddy nodded vigorously. Winky took this as permission to vanish all the remaining alcohol with a clap of her cold hands.
Spinnet chewed on the inside of her cheek to hide a smile. “I know what you’re doing, Potter. I cannot be bribed.”
“Oh, I don’t know. Her husband might like the idea. Blaise has a very Parisian attitude toward sex.”
The ‘private dining’ turned out to be somebody’s sitting room—or so it appeared to Harry. Instead of wooden chairs, tiled floors, and bud vases, the place featured a pair of very long, very squishy sofas. They faced one another on either side of a skinny table, and Harry had to relocate several cushions before he could sit down.
Nobody should be shouting but, if there was shouting to be done, it should not happen in his sitting room. Harry made a sound he was very glad nobody could hear. He peeled himself free of the duvet, adjusted his slipping sock, and shuffled his way toward the kitchen fireplace.
“Mmm. Perhaps.” Pomfrey snapped the book shut. “Regardless, we don’t keep anything of this strength on hand. We’ll need them brewed fresh.”
Books are bigger than their authors, bigger than words on a page. Books are portals. Books are treasure maps. Books are Rorschach inkblots, and they only have meaning because YOU do. The reader is the point. Your imagination, your passion, your big, beautiful heart... that's the point. So fuck The Author. She doesn't deserve you anymore.
“Our father thought our aunt and uncle were dangerous,” Hestia added. “He didn’t like us around them much.”
The shower was too hot, his head too fuzzy. He scrubbed up quickly, trying to wash himself awake. It didn’t help. With a resigned sigh, Harry toweled off and pulled a small glass vial from the top shelf of the medicine cabinet.
As color flooded Malfoy’s cheeks and the corner of his mouth twitched, Harry’s stomach decided to exit his body through his own throat. His heart might follow, if it pounded any harder. Only two decades of giving speeches and interviews and Wizengamot testimony prevented him from collapsing in a mortified heap. Draco Malfoy didn’t have Veela allure. He had something far scarier, far more compelling:
Once Teddy helped Harry to the bathroom, and then reluctantly shut himself behind the adjoining door of his own guest bedroom, Harry pulled out a cloak and a map.
“I see. Then I’ll fill in the blanks, shall I?” When Harry didn’t stop him, Sol leaned forward in his seat. “You knew Hogwarts drop-off was going to challenge your mental health. That it would throw you off balance.”
“If there exists a man more restrained than Draco Malfoy, I’ll eat the Sorting Hat,” she mused. “Rather unexpected, then, for him to raise a child like Scorpius.”
He pulled in air, and released it with a hiss. “Yeah. Thank you, Winky. I’ll do that right away.” Winky nodded, curtsied, and disappeared with a
Millie’s expression made it clear her opinion on Harry’s intelligence. “Did you imagine you’d been cagey about that? Yous aren’t subtle, Gryffindors.”
Parkinson regarded him with careful composure. Then she took a deep breath through her small nose. “If it were me? Or Greg Goyle? Or
Shall I order in breakfast for Saturday morning? Or perhaps Millie would be willing to bring an order, to go?
The dangerous thing about time travel, Harry thought, was that the past was a thing that lived inside you.
“My god,” Harry sighs again, and he can sense Pansy relaxing, although without his glasses, she’s just a black-and-tan blob across the room. “We’re a tire fire, the pair of us.”
Lily took off, swimming upstream through the mass of Friday night shoppers. Harry lost sight of her almost immediately, and his hand went to the center of his chest out of habit. The gold pendant, imbedded with Protean and Caterwauling charms, was keyed to three wristbands worn by his (highly embarrassed) children. Al called it an invasion of privacy. Lily said she got it caught in her hair during Quidditch. James kept “losing” it under his bed. Harry patted his shirt front, but the necklace stayed silent and cool to the touch.
“I should—” Harry cleared his throat. “I think Lily will be finishing up her club meeting soonish. I should get going. But I appreciate the tea.”
“James?” Harry said, turning toward his son. “It’s important. However angry you were, I can’t imagine you want Sam to stay in hospital like this.”
Parkinson’s nostrils flared. “Graham Montague. The 16-year-old boy your brothers trapped in the Vanishing Cabinet, which they failed to report to anyone! He apparated for the first time to escape, Splinched part of his
“I know.” Teddy shuffled some parchment. “She does this, though. Blows hot and cold. Gran says it’s a Veela thing, and that she’ll settle down in a few years.”
Harry was prepared, at all of twenty-self-righteous-years-old, to mark Malfoy’s letter ‘return to sender.’ He was prepared to feed to it to Buckbeak the hippogriff. He was prepared to tear it into tiny, tiny pieces, and put those pieces through his Muggle paper shredder. He was not prepared—not at all—to be the only person Draco Malfoy felt deserved no apologies.
“I’m quite willing to answer all of your questions,” McGonagall said, “but I require your presence at Hogwarts.”
The air above the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch is far too hot, too muggy, to stay still for long, so Harry circles as fast as he dares above the flashing crimson bodies below. Gryffindor kit, gold trim on red leather. Sleek ebony broom of a quality no student should own. Harry can feel the smooth acceleration, the carved grip under his gloves.
They must be practicing, because the stands are empty. There are no opposing colors on the field—no yellow, blue, or green—and, anyway, it just feels simpler. Kinder. The sky is impossibly blue. Summer Quidditch practice at Hogwarts? This isn’t how things work, is it? But it's familiar, somehow.
Harry thought about it. He’d been fairly certain that Artie would Sort into Slytherin. Both her mums were Snakes, their families in Slytherin for generations. Family values, Harry had learned, were the strongest indicator of Hogwarts House placement. The Sorting Hat wasn’t a tool designed to bring out the best in children, but to provide them a comfortable place to land—a community of students who came from similar backgrounds and had similar goals.
“He helped us move everyone to the Hogsmeade corridor, and then he hung back, to make sure no one attempted to use the Cabinet,” Pansy went on. Her eyes were unfocused and her expression bleak. “I still can’t believe the thing hadn’t been destroyed already. I suppose the Dark Lord forbid it."
“I asked you to come in because I believe James is not being entirely honest with me, nor with his Head of House,” McGonagall said. James shifted in his chair.
“Cease fire, Draco!” Teddy cut in. Though it wasn’t said sharply, Malfoy immediately closed his mouth and picked up his cellular. “You, too, Harry,” Teddy said, pointing a finger at him. “You can snip and snipe at one another as much as you like, once Sam’s back on his feet.”
, hmm?” When Harry’s face falls, so does Pansy’s. He’s never seen her so sympathetic. “You thought it was something you’d earned the rights to. An immutable truth.”
“The receptionist. Simone Morris.” Spinnet began to pace in front of Harry’s desk, ignoring the grouping of armchairs entirely. “She’s got to go, sir. I’m sorry.”
He slapped blindly at the bedside table until he located his glasses, shoving them onto his face with enough force to sting the bridge of his nose. He squinted at the clock. 9:02 AM.
“Right,” Harry smiled, awkwardly. “That’s—right, great, then. How’re you?” He barely restrained his wince, and the urge to hit himself over the head with a Mallard Mallet.
His godson was attempting to wrap up a very large Waterworks Whirligig. His fringe was drippy. “Cheers! Whatever I can eat standing up in the back, yeah?”
To be honest, I hadn't intended to share this with you yet, either. It's rough. It needs edits. If you notice issues, let me know and I'll correct them. By the time this fic in finished, it'll have plenty of changes throughout.
Pansy doesn’t offer a hand, or hug him, or kiss his cheek (god forbid). Just smiles that small, secretive smile and lets him pull the door open for her. He casts a wordless, wandless Warming charm over her small form, and she nods her thanks.
The practice was located near St. Mungo’s, and they did a lot of back-and-forth with the Healers there. Of the five therapists on staff, Luna was the youngest and the least experienced. Harry met with them all at least once. It took a few tries to match him up with the right grief counselor, and he’d sat in on the kids’ early appointments, too.
Shouting from the Floo always sounded odd, crackling, like the person on the other end had a mouth full of Muggle Fizz Wiz candy. Harry drew the duvet over his head, folding further into the sofa. The motion rattled a bowl on his side table—the remains of optimistic oat porridge which Ted left for him that morning. It’d congealed into a gluey lump by midday, swimming in a shallow pool of warm milk.
Harry snorted. “I can’t believe Hermione let you leave right before Hogwarts this year. You get to avoid the tearful send-off.”
“A reason? Do you lot need one? I’m fairly sure Angelina wouldn’t have minded if I’d been away from home, actually. I think the password on my front door is
Harry chatted to Millicent and Flora for a few minutes while Lily examined Artemis’s new cat. He had a hand over his chest, tapping his Protean pendant, but he did manage to relax enough to stop grinding his teeth. “What’s your cat’s name?” Harry asked Artie.
“Because Al doesn’t want people to know he’s worried about James,” Rose answered in an equally low voice. Al made an affronted squeak.
“Yes. A complete history of the Battle of Hogwarts, with necessary background information and as many first-hand accounts as I can accumulate.”
“Oh, yes. I’ll line the garden path with pralines, and the hungry slugs should march right out the front gate.”
It was a bit of a trick getting James onto the platform, since he’d always taken it at a run. Even Harry had trouble walking straight at a brick wall without flinching. James managed it with his eyes closed. Albus didn’t dare take the piss.
Harry blanched, and he only just managed to stop himself from dropping his forehead to his desk. “Love letters,” Harry croaked. “She’s saving the love letters.”
“D’you think I was unrestrained?” He asked suddenly. McGonagall glanced up from her desk. “As a kid, I mean? Was I—well, unpredictable? Spontaneous?”
Teddy snorted. “Because he took one look at you, fast asleep, and decided to Curse himself in the face?”
“Yes, trade-offs, Weasel,” Parkinson said. “That’s how this works! You get to sail into the Auror service without even a N.E.W.T. You are world-famous, and married to the most influential witch in the British Isles.”
The thing is: Our community needed WORDS right now. Even imperfect ones. We need messages of hope, to overwrite the hate we've had to swallow in the last few days.
They pushed through the swinging door onto the sales floor, and were nearly concussed by a wave of high-pitched sound. Squealing voices, whirling gadgets, chattering pygmy puffs, crying babies. Harry cast a wordless Susurratio toward his own head, and then another at Ron. The taller man jumped.
We're deviating from Pottermore/Cursed Child canon here. I'm as happy as I'm going to be with this--it's difficult not to pad it out with information Harry shouldn't have yet. If you get a second, reread the chapter "The Battle of Hogwarts" from Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows, to see events from Harry's point-of-view.
Her flickering face went pinched. “Nothing, actually. He was not the victim.” She drew a crackling breath. “James was the aggressor, I’m afraid.”
“My my! That’s terrible. Samuel Wolpert, isn’t it? He’s always so charming in my classes. We’ll get the little so-and-so fixed up in a jiff, never fret!”
McGonagall cut him off: “Perhaps the apologies should wait until after we’ve assembled the facts?” A little embarrassed, Harry followed along behind the headmistress with Teddy at his heels.
ran into conflict with her clients’ confidentiality. But Malfoy wasn’t a client, so it was likely the censoring thing. “It’s been long enough, I think. Enough distance from the war, maybe? You could just ask Draco why he never wrote to you.”
“Rose ran after Al as soon as we arrived,” she said, digging into her handbag. Her arm disappeared down to the elbow. Hermione loved a good Extension Charm.
All four Slytherins read through the contract thoroughly, which Harry respected, even if it did mean he needed to refresh his coffee while he waited. Eventually, the document was signed, sealed, and stored at the bottom of Hermione’s parchment pile.
He wants to delay—to watch her walk away into the inky November night. To sit in his depressing kitchen, drinking firewhiskey. To
Harry sent Prongs off again with a thank you, and a promise to contact Ron for himself. Then he dressed quickly and warmly, threw a change of clothes into a satchel, and chugged his remaining caffeine.
. Their doors were on the left. On the right: Dedalus Diggle—Harry’s first partner in the Auror service, and the oldest active-duty Auror in the Ministry—took charge of
He didn’t know Pansy at school—not at all—but he knows her now. He knows her smell, and the scars along her forearms, and that unbreakable love for Draco Malfoy. A love that survived the worst the war could dole out, and kept them both breathing. An immutable truth.
“You were—we were drunk.” Teddy seemed to be talking himself through things as he went. He scratched his eyebrow with the tip of his wand. “We drank too much, Miss Winky.”
She frowned toward the reporters, clustered together a few train cars away. Several flashbulbs went off. Harry adjusted his glasses.
“No problem,” Harry said, taking the owner’s place at the counter. The line to check out stretched straight down the main aisle, before curving to the left along the shopfront windows. Harry sighed.
“Wouldn’t know really,” Ted admitted with a shrug. “Didn’t know ‘im when he was a Death Eating tosser, did I?”
“I know this will come as a shock,” Parkinson drawled, looking straight at Harry, “but my family weren’t in the Dark Lord’s circle, either. I found out sooner, at the start of fifth year. From Draco.”
“Thank you,” Hermione finally said, solemnly. “I can’t tell you how much I appreciate you doing this. All of you. It must be—” She choked a little, and turned to Ron.
But friends, please believe me: Nothing Rowling says or does can change the part of her story that lives in YOU.
Sol inclined his head. “Especially James. We had an action plan. James and Albus had scheduled counseling sessions yesterday. Did they go?”
She said all this in a smooth, unaffected tone, but those dark eyes betrayed her. “I regret it. I was an idiot child, and I regret it, and I’ll never be able to atone. And yet.” She thinned her lips. “I am sorry, Harry Potter.”
“‘S not normal, is it?” He fiddled with the cup lid, bouncing a knee. “Most people don’t think about school that way anymore, I think. In adulthood. Especially not if they got attacked at school every year.”
Ron lost it, choked with giggles. Tears were rolling down his cheeks as his face turned nearly as red as his eyebrows. “Merlin, Ginny…”
“Pansy, you mentioned that Flora was the one who turned Septima Vector over to the Order of the Phoenix.” Flora turned a bit pink, but nodded. “Can you tell me about that?”
The older wizard observed Harry again over tortoise shell reading glasses. Harry shifted awkwardly on the sofa. He regretted the decision to skip shaving, and he hadn’t noticed the coffee stain on his kecks until he after he left the house.
Harry’s eyes slid right, toward the golden, claw-footed mirror. The odd, backwards inscription still bothered him.
“Yes! Not that there was really any question,” Scorpius prattled as the color returned to his cheeks. “I’ll visit Mother every week, of course, in the Summers, and we’ll organize the holidays together. Vikram and Father have some scheme for after the baby is born, splitting their time at home to help Mother while she recovers.”
“We agreed this might be the safest place in the school for an object like the Mirror,” Professor Dumbledore explained. “So few people are ever born with the skill to enter. And I think Salazar would have appreciated the symbolism.”
Harry and Ron made their way through the crowd to Arthur, who was trying to make out an order form written in what looked like ancient runes. “How’s it going, Dad?” Ron shouted.
Of course, he couldn’t. A Time Turner only allowed you to reverse five hours, and Harry never did figure out how Dumbledore walked the timeline back so many months. Hermione said, once, that time travel broke one of the Wizarding world’s most important laws. That it was dangerous. That it ruined lives. Harry needed, more than ever, to believe that was true.
“Harry Potter was very angry,” Winky told him, pulling a little at one of her big, wooly ears. “The Elves is not wanting to bother Harry Potter, but Winky is coming anyway. To stop the shaking.” She gave him a very disappointed look. “Harry Potter is breaking things.”
James waged a very brief battle with himself, before he leaned down far enough to thump Harry on the back. It was almost a hug.
“Madam Pomfrey was notified. He has been in the hospital wing for the past four hours. Poppy exhausted all the usual remedies, and we’re moving on to Curse-specific treatment protocols. Which is why,” she arched her eyebrows, “we need to know which Curse was cast on Mr. Wolpert.”
Harry put his wand into dueling position, and circled the basilisk’s skeleton on quiet feet. His heart pounded. His wand felt slippery in his hand.
Harry held her gaze, and his notorious temper, until the atmosphere in the room seemed to thicken with malice and magic. Parkinson didn’t look away.
Harry’s missing letter wasn’t a secret, though Harry never brought it up. One day, during Sunday dinner at the Burrow, George said, “Heard the Baby Death Eater didn’t send you a letter, Harry? Knew he was full of nogtail shit.” Harry only nodded, and Ron laughed, and Ginny pressed her lips together until they disappeared. It became a kind of shorthand:
“Perhaps,” she hedged, “but you and Ron both tend to cut him up whenever we mention the subject of our school days. Lee and George join in, though heaven knows why—they barely knew him then. It must be difficult for Al, to think you all hate his best friend’s father.”
Scorpius gasped, and grabbed Al’s chin to turn it toward him. “Accidental magic?” He tilted Al’s head back and forth, examining his cowlicks.
And it looked, for a few moments, like Teddy was going to agree with him. To placate him, maybe. His eyes—flicking from Harry’s face to his scarred, wandless hands—were unbearably soft. Tender.
“I asked him to come,” Harry said. He took one of the armchairs in front of Professor McGonagall’s large desk. A flick of her wand conjured a third chair, and Teddy sank into it with a smile of thanks.
“Means a lot,” Neville said. “I’m not feeling all that trustworthy at the mo’. I hate that I missed so much with James.”
“Hello Lakshmi,” Harry greeted, stepping into her arms for a tight hug. She was a short-haired woman with brown skin and hip black spectacles. Lakshmi Patil was four years younger than Harry, but he often thought she’d not be out-of-place among the teenaged Auror recruits. She was calm and clever, with an easy smile. Lakshmi wore the uniform of the hospital wing (white apron over her clothes, white cap on her head) but she couldn’t look less like Poppy Pomfrey if she tried.
Sol Eisenberg was older than Harry by two decades and, were he Muggle, could be looking toward retirement. Thankfully, most wizards kept working well past their hundredth birthday. Harry couldn’t fathom addressing his
Flora’s eyes slid closed for a moment, before she visibly stiffened her spine. “I’m sure that’s true. More coffee?”
Astoria Malfoy had done something totally out-of-character; there was a deep, guilty part of Harry that needed to know why. He found himself observing Astoria like a ‘person of interest,’ the way Gawain Robards had taught him, two decades ago.
“Teddy’s with me. He and James went back to Gryffindor Tower, to disable the Curse and gather up all his potions. They’ll be headed this way.”
Draco Malfoy had grown paler with age. He was the fairest person Harry knew, with skin so porcelain and pore-less that Harry used to wonder if he used a Glamour. His hair wasn’t even properly blond—it was pure, unrelieved white, each strand thicker than it seemed it should be. Every part of Malfoy was cream, ivory, and snow. He wore black and gray, occasionally green, like the man still slept in the Slytherin dormitory. He wore his hair long enough to curl around his ears, in loose waves that seemed (to Harry) shockingly disheveled. His widow’s peak had increased, making his face was even more triangular.
Hermione tapped the kettle with her wand and pulled out the tea. “It’s impossible to imagine Draco as a cuckold. He’s so incredibly sharp.”
Harry leapt from the bed, and dashed so quickly down the hall that he was dragging Ted behind him. They crashed down two floors to the basement kitchen, Harry’s heart pounding. Minerva McGonagall’s moss-tinted face waited calmly in the hearth.
“Morgana, I know!” She noticed Neville shooting her a glance, and smiled drolly. “Imagine growing up with those two for older sibs. It was a routine hit to the ego.”
“As you wish,” she nodded and popped. “I’ll prepare the guest rooms. Do endeavor to hurry, Harry. I don’t think the anticipation is doing anyone much good.”
It’s disappointing that James didn’t come clean with you about the argument in the Great Hall. I told him specifically to write to you. It wasn’t much of an infraction, really, but his language was pretty off-color. I asked around discreetly, and I’ve heard he might be facing some teasing for the cane and the limp. Awful, just awful! What is
“Not every couple works out, no matter how old they were when they met.” Harry pulled the letters out of Teddy’s worrying hands. “Maybe this time you should consider dating somebody new, just while you and Vic are on a break. It doesn’t have to be serious.”
50 Sekforde Street in Farringdon is actually the address of an Australian restaurant called Granger & Co. That was too funny not to use.
The smile must not have gone well, because Hermione looked worried. “Perhaps Ron should come back early,” she said.
Millie blew out a very impressive series of smoke rings. “You’re here for the truth, I’d imagine. So am I.”
“Stupid,” he said, and then decided it answered her question, too. “It’s stupid, never mind it. How’re you, Myrtle?”
Angie started to laugh, head thrown back. Fleur rolled her eyes, said something too quiet to make out. Hermione smiled.
His eyes were the same bright, open blue they’d always been. His wide mouth still smiled when he was thinking, or sleeping. Not everything had changed.
Flora said, "Rosmerta's House-elves were gone. None of the equipment will work without their magic, so we could only eat what we didn’t need to cook. The store rooms wouldn’t stay cool, either, without the Elves about; all that meat and dairy turned rancid in a day. The kitchen was swarming with flies.”
I hope this chapter brings you a bit of light in a very dark time. I'm posting some links at the end of the chapter to charities which assist some of the people most at risk right now: Black trans people in the United States. If you have a little money, you can make a donation. If you don't, that's okay. Your big, beautiful hearts are enough.
“I truly hope you’re able to forgive one another,” Pansy says as they return to the front hall. Harry’s jaw clenches. “The pair of you—it makes sense. I still don’t really know why.”
And that was the bloody crux of it: Harry didn’t want to be better. Wiser. Kinder. It was pointless, and Harry was tired. He didn’t want to forgive Draco Malfoy. Lucius Malfoy. Pansy fucking Parkinson. He knew it was a character flaw, to hold these particular grudges when he’d let so many others go. If he were really the paragon the Wizarding World believed he was, he'd probably do that. It had been 20 years. He knew he was a hypocrite.
"Where are you even going, huh? You have nowhere to go. You're still a criminal so you don't really have a choice", Ron said, grim smugness on his face.
"Uh. That's flattering, Malfoy", Potter replied and raised his eyebrows. Oh no. What was happening? Was he trying to fucking flirt? With...with him?
"You two, for example. You're making breakfast on a workday, you basically live here and are very clearly doing boyfriend stuff, but somehow you're… what? Friends who shag?", she said and looked at Draco and Harry. Draco avoided everyone's gaze by smoothly putting the scrambled eggs on a big plate.
"I do not even want to think about this. Look, I'm as tolerant as they come, but did you have to shag Malfoy of all people?"
"I thought you were, I don't know, a Gryffindor. What about just winging it? I thought that was your thing."
"Why did you do it?", Harry asked and filled her cup with hot tea and milk, two sugars, like he always did.
"No, you don't", Draco said and snogged him again. He half-heartedly wiggled a bit under him, but it was less trying to get free and more trying to rub his cock on Draco's. Then it was biting and frotting and laughing and wrestling with Draco always on top, and more frotting. Potter took their cocks into his hand and rubbed them and Draco came on his fingers. He tried giving head for the first time and was quite proud that it worked. When they were done, Potter got up and made coffee for them. It was all a bit too good to be true.
"I know I haven't been the most attentive boyfriend. But I'll be better from now on. I'm so glad you're coming back."
"Since he felt used and had feelings for me and I did not feel the same way about him and he is a sane person who notices these things, he stopped seeing me", Draco said with a defeated smile on his face. "Now back to Hermione, please."
He had started with Dudley. The favourite, the one Petunia had doted on. He made them watch, silenced and tied down by spells. And then he had crucioed him with the wand that he had nicked from the last raid.
Potter's hands on him. He stopped trying to grasp the concept of it. He closed his eyes. Potter was standing so close that Draco could feel his body heat radiating off him. The other man pulled him closer by the hip. Draco touched Potter's back and rubbed up and down. It felt firm under the fabric of his robe. Draco opened his eyes again. And Potter's face was so, so close.
He apparated to work. He opened up the shop in the morning and closed it in the evening,  because he had no social life at the ripe old age of twenty-three.
"Belial. I shouldn't have done that. I'm so sorry. I thought this would be fun. And maybe I wanted to see what it was like. With you and Potter. But I should've talked to you."
"Have you tried it with a bloke?" Potter said and had the audacity to look him directly in the eyes while doing so.
"Wow, Hermione. Are you deliberately dressing like that to drive me crazy?", Ginny muttered. Hermione blushed. Because, yes, she was deliberately dressing like that to drive her crazy. And it wasn't especially hard to dress like that. Ginny had told her about having a thing for the stereotypical library-lesbian-look and well, that was basically all of Hermione's wardrobe anyway. The things that Ron liked to see her in were the exception to that rule and she always felt a bit as if she were playing dress-up in those. So, if she wanted to look her absolute best for Ginny, which she absolutely did, she just put on her favourite clothes and felt sexy in them. Never underestimate the power of attitude. And nice short fingernails. Instead of answering, she just smiled. "Wow, you fucking tease, you absolutely know! I'm shocked!", Ginny lamented in mock terror. Hermione grinned. "I'm also wearing a very conservative skirt that is riding up under the table", she said and squeezed Ginny's knee.
"Well it's not going to happen, Nott. I will self-sabotage the shit out of this, like any rational adult would. Because I'm too selfish to actually break up with him just because he is too good for me."
When Hermione looked into Ginny's eyes, they had a slightly dazed expression. She bit her lip and whimpered lowly. It was interesting to Hermione, what that expression did to her. With Ron, she had been a bit more submissive, careful to not hurt his fragile ego. It backfired most of the time, but whenever she was a bit more self-confident, Ron would whine about her being bossy. With Ginny, she didn't feel like toning it down in the slightest. But Ginny was just as dominant as her, which, the last time, had ended in a delightful play-fight. There was biting and scratching and even some choking involved. After putting up a good fight, eventually Ginny melted into Hermione's pulling and pushing, still clawing at her back, but mewling in a desperately horny, slightly defeated way. When she had started to kiss her way down to Hermione's wet cunt, Hermione realised that she had not been on the receiving end of oral sex since she had dated Viktor back in fifth year. And oh, had she missed it. But that wasn't the only reason she screamed like a Banshee on fire. It was just so right- Ginny felt right. Her tongue was so smooth, her sucking so devoted- the enthusiasm with which she moaned into her and burried her head between her legs.
Potter fell asleep immediately. And miraculously, Draco did too after a while. He dreamed of nothing.
"You're going to end up a spinster with that attitude. Or do you want to fuck around, like Harry? That might work for queers, but no straight wizard wants a slag", Ron shouted.
"Bye, Malfoy. Sorry to interrupt", Hermione said. She wanted to say that he wasn't obligated to leave, but she couldn't bring herself to do so. She needed to tell Harry what she did, for better or for worse. Malfoy vanished.
Belial wanted to make quipped remark, but for some strange reason, his tongue was stuck in his mouth. He coughed and took a gulp of blue wine.
He came in through the fireplace. Draco grewted him with an unusually warm hug. Draco's apartment was decorated with candles, and it looked less frugal than Belial would've imagined it. There was a decanter with blue fairy wine, and some elegant wine goblets next to it. Draco smiled at him and made intense eye contact. Which was not normally his style. Maybe he wanted to work around the awkwardness? It was strange how attractive he looked in the dim candle light. He was as blond and slender as ever, everybody's type, probably. But Belial had always had looked at him in a brotherly way. Well, not solely in a brotherly way. But noticing his twinkish qualities under the influence of alcohol was only natural. But now it was somehow more obvious. The cat-like elegance. The hip-bones, visible under the rather tight muggle shirt he was wearing.
"You didn't tell Draco shit about us. And I asked him about his feelings and he is absolutely devasted."
"Muggles are so inventive", Belial remarked. They sat down on the sofa, and the movie started. It was American, and hard to listen to at first. And it was good. So good that Belial didn't even notice at first how him and Draco were suddenly so close to each other. But after he noticed, It was hard to even concentrate on the film. Draco stretched his arm lazily and it somehow ended up wrapped around his shoulder. And it felt so good to be held like that. Belial leaned his head against Draco. Merlin, the man smelled like he had bathed in amortentia. What had happened since they had last met? Where did this magnetism come from? Belial felt Draco breathing calmly. His hand was lightly massaging Belial's tense shoulder. This was definitely not their usual pub banter. This was breaching date-territory. He was getting in trouble. This would and in drama. It could only end in drama. That was the problem with being a gay wizards: the drama. The community was so small that everyone was shagging everyone. But this was Belial's mistake for even starting anything with Potter earlier on. He blurred the lines between friendship and romance. And even unwittingly betrayed his mate. Who did feel like more than that. And was so warm. And close. And oh boy, giving him little butterfly kisses on his neck, right below his earlobe. He wanted to say something about crossing lines and staying out of trouble, but all that came out was a soft moan. Then there were lips on lips, the taste of elven wine, hands pulling him closer, and a blizzard of hungry emotions that made him temporarily not listen to his inner turmoil. The voice of reason was very low. Dry, warm hands on his back. Light scratching. And with more prowess than Belial would've thought Draco possessed, he had taken off Belial's shirt and pulled down his pants. Draco sensual licking and sucking was merging with the monstrous sounds of a man transforming into a devil. Belial moaned and screamed, pulling Draco's hair and pumping into his mouth. The second he climaxed, his guilt and doubt flooded back through the dam that the wild lust had build around itself. To his own surprise, he felt tears rolling down his cheeks.
Draco wanted to scream. He looked at Harry,  ready to tell him sod off,  but instead he froze when their eyes met. It somehow felt way to private, it hurt.
"Malfoy. Just to make myself clear. I came here because I wanted to date you. I asked you out because I want to shag you senseless and if you think that's too forward, please tell me so", Potter said confidently.
One of the aurors didn't have his wand out and was fiddling with his thumbs instead. Draco looked into his face and froze. It was Potter, unmistakably, still the same face with his messy hair and those glasses that never seemed to stay put. Draco felt something he hadn't felt in years. Hot, juvenile anger bubbled up inside him. So there was Potter, holier-than-thou St. Fucking Potter, and raided his place? Really? He crossed his arms and was close to snarling something along the lines of searching his arse for dark magic, but then remembered that it wasn't a good idea to anger the people who might close this place down if he had forgotten even a single apple outside of the hidden department that only activated if you said the right words.
"I guess I am a bit tense about the whole Potter-affair", Belial admitted. Draco's eyes flickered away for a millisecond.
Draco knew it was a mistake to keep sleeping with Potter. The constant rejection festered like mold in an unwashed cauldron. But every time he tried to stay away, hours felt like days and days like weeks. He wanted to not seem desperate, not call for month, ditch a date from time to time, but he couldn't bring himself to pretend. He went out alone and tried to have a good time, he smiled and drank until his eyes hurt. And after a few sleepless nights and then returning to Potter whenever he called like he had accio'd him there, Draco came up with a plan. A petty, juvenile plan.
Petunia and Vernon had screamed at each other in agony. Like Harry had screamed the first few times that Vernon had forced himself on him. And Petunia had to watch this time, couldn't pretend to not hear, couldn't look away and do nothing.
"Uh, hi Granger", he mumbled and ruffled his hair. Harry thoughtlessly un-ruffled it in a very boyfriend-like manner indeed. Then he kissed Harry good-bye and walked into the fireplace.
When Draco was done sweeping, there was the noise of apparating. Five aurors stood in the shop, wands raised.
"Are you coming over here, or..?" Potter moaned, two fingers still scissoring inside him. Draco came over and took Potter's wet hand away from his bum. Then he placed his cock on his stretched hole and slid in easily. It felt great and fucking Potter into a sofa was exhilarating, but it was somehow less intimate then the eye contact and the kissing. Potter moaned and came all over Draco after he had repeatedly hit his prostate. When Potter clenched his buttocks around him, Draco came, too. Through the satisfaction,  the climax had somehow felt anticlimactic to Draco. Potter scourgified them both. Then he cuddled up and rested his head on Draco's lap. "Should I leave soon?", Draco asked awkwardly.
Ginny growled lowly. "I thought we wanted to have coffee and a proper date and such nonsense. I'm going to shag you in a stall in the loo if you keep going like this."
"You've looked better, dear", it reminded him unnecessarily. He took a bit of Bubbler's Best Blemish Remover and covered his face in it. Afterwards he looked like a very convincing doll. Almost human.
Draco went into the cellar and looked at the object. It was wrapped into a black piece of cloth. It moved. That startled Draco a bit, but it wasn't anything that much out of the ordinary. But then, it sneezed. And even though that wasn't that uncommon for old, charmed objects, something about that sneeze sounded decidedly less like an object and more like a subject. Draco put on his dragon-hide gloves and took off the black cloth. Under it, there was a big, round globe and in that globe a tiny creature that Draco had read about, but never seen. To his knowledge, fae draconis had gone extinct seventy years ago. But this one looked alive. And very, very angry.
Hey Mione, Ron is here. With flowers and half-arsed apologies. You want to see him or can I kick him in the face?
When he woke up in the morning, Potter was gone and he felt well rested and eerily calm, as if he didn't just done something absolutely terrifying. He couldn't remember the last time he had felt calm instead of numb. Potter came into the room, a towel wrapped around him.
Potter moved next to him, his brows furrowed. Then he spasmed and screamed, a weird,  high-pitched scream.
Belial Nott, Theodor's elder brother, had been a somewhat good acquaintance over the last two years and they occasionally drank some firewhiskey together. They had met when Belial had bought some spying fancy noodles from him, a thing that was usually added to gift baskets. It worked as long as they weren't cooked and eaten, which was usually infinitely. Because they were technically not a spying device but a perfectly edible food,  they weren't outlawed by the ministry.
"I kind of dated Malfoy's best friend. Wait, what did you do?",Harry explained and then turned to Draco furiously.
"As in "we fuck" or as in "we sleep next to each other and I'm oblivious to the effect it could have on precious, wonderful, baby gay Draco"?
There wasn't a lot of people who were allowed to call Harry at work. Mad-eye, Minerva and Belial. That was it. Oh, and Draco, but he didn't know that.
"You know Harry Fucking Potter? I,  of course you do, he was in your year at Hogwarts, right? I think Theo told me something about the two of you on, don't remember what, though", Belial answered.
Potter sat on his knees and waited. Draco came closer, stroked the damp hair out of his face and put the glasses on him. He lunged toward and pinned Potter to the bed, kissing him. Potter laughed, out of breath, and tried to wrestle out of Draco's hold.
Hermione had given him a lop-sided grin and a hug. "Good, Harry. I'm glad you know that about yourself now."
Draco wasn't angry at the world anymore, like he had been as a teenager. He had just accepted that he was dark and that sometimes he was petrified and couldn't move, even when he wasn't sleeping.
"Yes, that's better. I want to look at all of you, though." Potter investigated Draco's face. Then his hands brushed against his chest and Harry bend his knees.
Potter got rid of his robes and unbuttoned his shirt. It looked almost vulnerable, his bare chest in the pale light. When he peeled off his trousers, his cock bounced. Draco had seen his fair share of naked people, the whole Slytherin team had not been shy in the locker room. But in his whole life, he had never seen anyone as naked as Potter. It was obscene, this nakedness. Raw. Draco sat down on his sofa.
It hadn't been hard to make the investigation disappear. Not for an auror,  not for The Boy Who Lived.
"Hm. Pumpkin Juice. Brings me back to Hogwarts", Ginny said dreamily. Hermione laiughed. "I ordered pumpkin spice latte, that is decidedly not the same. It is very muggle, american even, if I remember correctly."
"It's not a date. I'm not into blokes. Why does everyone think that?", Draco said absentmindedly. Harry looked away. "Oh", he said with something in his voice that sounded an awful lot like disappointment, which made no sense at all.
Belial looked ready to strangle him through the floo, so Harry just aguamenti'd the fireplace. Nott was right of course. Harry knew he was being an absolute dipshit. But if Draco expected him to play the doting boyfriend for him, just because he was being a good lay, and cute, and had scrunched his nose in an adorable way when he was thinking, and snogged him into pillows and made his nightmares better and was absolutely ridiculously perfect for him, he was so wrong.
Hermione should've returned by now. It wasn't right. It was true that he had been a bit harsh with her, but she just had this infuriating energy around her, this silent superiority. It would've made anyone mad. And it wasn't as if he had ever laid a hand on her. No matter how much nagging there was, he had always hit the wall or a table, never her face. And he had never cheated on her. That had to count for something, right? Oh well. Maybe it was time to get her the flowers she so clearly needed and apologise. Ron put on his coat and got some colourful tulips from the station. Then he apparated to Harry's front door. He was still not over the fact that Potter apparently allowed Hermione into his wards but not him. And they had been best mates for such a long time!  If Harry wasn't an arse-bender, he would've been jealous. He rung the doorbell and it yelled into the house that Ron was at the door in a rude, thick Liverpool accent. No one opened. Then, there were muffled voices and steps. Harry opened the door in a bathrobe.
"Oh. I think I'll just get going, then", he said and entered the room. He was in pyjamas, which meant he was more likely a boyfriend than a hook-up, and he was also Draco Malfoy.
"Hi Malfoy. Let's skip the drink and go to mine, yeah? And how about tonight, I really want to see your pointy face again. I'll pick you up after work if you don't protest immediately."
It was probably part of it. Did he tell Belial all the same phrases, did he scratch his back? Did he kiss his nape? Draco felt how Potter opened his belt, saw him kneel in front of him with that perfect impersonation of love on his face. Then there was a swirling tongue, a warm throat and the feeling of getting sucked dry, as if all his self-preservance was sucked into Potter's mouth.
Belial hurriedly dressed himself and disappeared into the floo. And he took the bottle of wine with him. Like the stone-cold bugger everyone seemed to think he was.
They repeated the Spiel a few times. Potter's place, a dark alley and privacy charms, the kitchen counter. And they'd spent the night together and calm.each other after the inevitable nightmares. They saw each other every other day and Draco began to hope. Stupid hope stretched it's tendrils into his heart and squeezed his capillaries. Hope sipped into his smiles when he looked at Potter.
"Hey, so, Malfoy,  I know you and Potter aren't exclusive, but are you really cool with me and him shagging? Because, I will stop immediately if it bothers you. I wouldn't want to risk our friendship over this, it's just sex", Nott told Draco over a pint, and it was like a bludger hitting him in the chest. He bit his tongue so hard that he tasted blood, and that was the only reason he didn't start crying in the middle if a crowded pub. When did Potter even find time to fuck other men? Did he use a time-turner? Did he squeeze it into his lunch break? Draco stared at Belial in shock. It made sense. Belial and him. They were flirting in front of him the first time they met. So why did this feel like fiendfire? Why couldn't he open his mouth and say something,  anything, to Belial.
And then he felt a sharp pain in his stomach. He wanted to scream, but it felt like he was gargling spicy blood. He looked at Harry for help, but Harry was giggling. Ron passed out.
But still, this was supposed to be non-commital. And Draco was in danger of losing his head and getting his heart crushed into a million peaces. If Potter knew that he occupied his mind, every single day, that he was his first thought in the morning and his last in the evening, he would surely drop him like a hot potato. And everything would go back to grey fog again.
"That I can't stop watching your mouth and stop doing that indecent thing with your tongue, Potter."
And then he started cleaning like a sodding muggle, it was ridiculous, he started lifting things and tried to put them back into the shelves. Draco just stood there for at least ten minutes, while Harry tried to manually move a stone chair that was made from volcanic minerals to absorb wild magic.
Belial was not the nicest person. He wasn't even someone who Draco would've tried to spend time with. He just was very persistent. And for some reason, he had picked Draco Malfoy as his drinking mate.
"Well clean up then, you incredibly arrogant tosser!", Draco screeched. Oh no. Where had that emotion come from? What had happened to the pleasent numbness? Why were there so many feelings, why did it burn, why did it hurt? Draco felt his eyes getting hot. What was that? He wasn't going to cry, was he? He hadn't cried in years. Not since his mother had died.
"Want to down our coffee, apparate back to your place and see if we still fit into our Hogwarts-uniform?", Hermione asked and wiggled her eyebrows suggesitvely. "Yes please!", Ginny croaked. "I was joking but I guess we could actually do it", Hermione said. The waiter came back with their beverages. He seemed a bit more calm now. Hermione gave him an apologetic grin. He turned beet red again and left for the kitchen. "Maybe we should tone it down, that poor man looked like he had trouble breathing", Hermione mentioned. Ginny shrugged and gulped her coffee down with an impressive speed. "He's fit, he can join us", she said. Hermione did not like that thought much. Yeah, it was kind of hot but she wasn't really ready to share Ginny with anyone. Oh no. They should probably talk. Have The Talk. Relationship talk. Or they could not. And then probably end up like Harry and Malfoy. That would be awful. She staightened up. Time to Gryffindor this situation into clarity. She sighed. Ginny looked at her in  worried way. "Hey, luv. Is there something wrong?" Hermione pinched the bridge of her nose.
Draco danced a bit. But it wasn't because he was crushing on Potter, Draco told himself, no, it was just nice to...finally not having to think about when they'd meet. Or something. But this obnoxious smile on his face just wouldn't go away. It was stuck there and helped him sell absolutely worthless and useless rubbish to people. And when it was nearly half eight, Potter came in. Draco tried to act casually, which, well, wasn't his strong suit. Potter came over to the counter and hugged him. It was glorious and absolutely ridiculous. He didn't usually hug anyone except his mom, and his mom was dead. But, well. Hugging Potter was nice. And he was absolutely not getting anything "out of his system", if anything, the crush intensified. Potter helped him close the store and started snogging him in the store room. They apparated to his bed mid-snog. And then it was hours and hours of fantastic sex again. And falling asleep next to each other. And eating breakfast in bed.
He worked at Borgin and Burke's since their family account was frozen, dealing with technicaly legal goods over and obviously forbidden things under the table. Draco was good at it. Better than Burke.
"I kind of dumped him just a few hours ago. I'm surprised he's not here, trying to annoy me further, actually."
"Well I like it when you call me Potter. Does something to me. Whatever. So. You fucked Belial. Good for you. Yes, good. You. Uh. Was that a one time thing?", Harry asked without looking at Draco.
