"May I see them?" the brunette asked tentatively, not wanting to cross any lines with Draco and his possessions. He didn't want to upset him.
The boy across from him hummed and jerked his head at the door, "Well Pansy's here. Bitch to her. She might have some more information for you anyways."
Draco let out a humourless laugh, "Yeah sorry about that. But I've healed you and there shouldn't be any scarring. I learned it from Severus, so if there is any scarring it should be minimal."
Harry nodded stiffly, "Yes. To put it bluntly, the rumors were true. There was a piece of his soul inside me. I needed to die in order to destroy it."
"Draco? Please eat something. You won't do yourself any favors if you just sit there staring into space," Hermione stated in a motherly tone. Draco ignored her. Just like he had been doing for the last five days. "Draco?" she tried again as she placed a cup of steaming tea on the coffee table in front of him. He did not even turn to look at her. "Please?" she tried in a soft whisper, a broken whisper, the voice of someone who was on the brink of giving up.
"So?" Harry asked, his voice a deep husky whisper. Draco fought the urge the shiver. He turned on his heel and cocked a sleek blonde eyebrow at his lover.
The clicking of nails against the wooden floorboards alerted him to Seeker's proximity. He bent down against to ruffle the dogs' flanks before straightening up to pour the chicken soup into a deep bowl. He set about placing the bowl of soup and a glass of water onto a tray so that Harry did not have to move from the sofa.
"I don't care what the nurse says!" Harry snipped, his breathing harsh to Draco's ears. "I just want to have some good memories before ... if I ..."
"-I took you up to my room in the manor," Draco smirked, his stomach flooding with warmth at the memory.
Draco tore his eyes around the room, spinning around searching for Seeker. He soon found the blond tuft of Seeker's tail shaking from underneath the bed in their bedroom. Draco barely made it to the bedroom without tripping heavily over his slippery socks on the floorboards. "Seeker?" he breathed as he bent down on all fours and peered underneath the bed. The dog was used to witches and wizards popping in and out unannounced and yet this intrusion had rendered the poor animal to a quivering mass of gold fur. "Hey bud it's okay" Draco tried to soothe in a quavering voice as he flattened himself to stroke the fur under the bed. Seeker's large watery, almond eyes looked sad at Draco's words but licked at Draco's hand as the blond continued to stroke his fur and ears.
Blaise nodded, "We might as well before the Weaslette decides to make a scene. At least this way they can have some more support."
He didn't mind the work or the familiarity of classes being back, but it still left him feeling a little hollow whenever the bell chimed for the end of class. It was strange seeing Hogwarts rebuilt to its former glory, especially when the last time he'd been there the stairs had been bathed in blood and the walls had been crumbling around his head. He had only returned to the school after the Christmas holidays. His mother had insisted on taking extra time to let him gather his thoughts and make an informed decision about his last year of education. He opted to go back as soon as the January term commenced. Pansy had returned much the same time as Draco and despite being shunned, it wasn't half as bad as the letter's she'd written to him, about the punishments Draco was forced to endure.
Later that evening just as everyone was milling into the Great Hall, Draco leaned close to Harry and pressed a hand into his palm as they went their separate ways on the other side of the door. He wanted to talk to him in the Room later on, and simply wanted to spend some time with him. Their evening meet-ups had been few and far between since the start of term had resumed, and he was anxious to spend some proper time with Harry.
He glanced at his watch and smiled slightly; it would be little under an hour before they reached Blackpool, and once they were checked into the hotel, they could take Seeker along for a walk on the beach and stop off to get some food. His own stomach grumbled happily at the thought of an impending meal.
"Well you're here with me now, aren't you?" Draco asked softly with a lazy smile as he raked his hands through Harry's hair. "Although, I do think we need to be heading to bed now."
They seemed awfully well mannered and although a lot of thought had clearly been put into writing them, Draco could see where Harry's grip on reality began to slip again. It wasn't until the last letter in that bundle, did cracks began to appear in the writing and the manic ramblings began to come to light. Draco blanched as he read the words, his stomach gripping in dread at Harry's chaotic thoughts.
A shudder of tears and pent-up anguish were roiling around inside Draco's and he was struggling to contain it. He sniffled again, "Oh, Merlin, Harry -do you have any idea how much I miss you?"
"I love you too," Harry whispered, his voice seeming to have disappeared with the shock of the gorgeous, cool band on his left hand. It shone brightly in the cozy lighting of the restaurant. He gazed at it for a few moments longer, turning his hand at slight angles so that the ring glimmered. It smiled a little wider and almost jumped out of his skin when Draco placed a hand on his shoulder.
They both sighed and took their time standing up and leaving the Room, the door disappearing as the door clicked shut behind them. As they came to a stop at the staircase, Draco turned to him and smiled softly, "I guess I'll see you on Saturday then?"
As soon as Draco had prepped Harry enough with three fingers slipping all the way up to the knuckle, he released Harry with a wet pop and smirked as Harry gasped and looked down at him. Draco smirked, "Are you ready, Harry?" he growled in a husky voice before nipping at the brunette's thighs.
"I'm scared that one day I'm going to wake up and not have you beside me –and –and that it'll be all my fault," he blinked away at the tears brimming on his lashes before inhaling deeply, "And it's not even that the same thing would have happened. What if –what if I drive you away again? Without physical consequences? What if I am so unbearably horrid that regardless of our age, you decide that you can no longer stand to be around me?"
Harry shifted and felt the heat through the duvet covers under his thighs and hummed in pleasure, "oh that feels like Heaven -Ooh!"
It took a while before the murmurings of the hall came back however it was still tense, only really broken by the abrupt departure of a certain red-haired girl with tear stained cheeks.
Blaise nodded as he checked over the list, "Yes that's all we'll need for now. Pansy can you start chopping the peppermint for me?"
lying there lifeless. At least then he wouldn't have anyone mourning his body. Why did Draco have to die? Why did it have to be
Last night however, he hadn't been able to restrain himself as he'd read about the latest story Skeeter was spewing about his life, most of which wasn't even remotely true. It had struck a nerve when his guard was down and he hadn't wanted to unleash the anger on Draco, but he found he couldn't stop himself. He'd left as soon as he made sure the blonde was alright.
Draco looked up into those bright green eyes that were no longer obscured by his round glasses. They were filled with concern and shining with lust. It was a strange, over-whelming sensation that flooded Draco with a renewed sense of confidence. He reached up and brushed Harry's hair out of his eyes before tenderly cupping his face. "Take me," he breathed.
Harry's lower lip wobbled a little at the memories dancing in the flames of the fire before he wiped at his dampening lashes and cast a shy eye around the room, "To this day I'm still surprised we're back here again. I was sure Severus was going to sell this place to Slughorn."
It also seemed to help that, since the war had ended along with the trials, pureblood tradition was widely disregarded at present, so it wasn't like same sex relationships would be terribly frowned upon. He couldn't deny his annoyance that the blonde wouldn't just get up and kiss the stupid boy yet. What was stopping him? He was the Savior of the Wizarding World, The Boy Who Lived Twice, and had so many people falling all over themselves just to sit near him. So what was Draco so worried about? Well that wasn't difficult; he was an ex-Death Eater and a Slytherin not to mention a Malfoy.
"Alright Potter, you have yourself a deal." He placed his hand into Harry's and tried to ignore the jolt he felt as his first skin-on-skin contact with another human being in months, as it ran through him. Taking his hand back, he stood a little straighter and inclined his head, "See you soon then, Potter."
Draco did his best to unclench his muscles and then hissed in pain as Harry's cold, slick finger swathed his insides with the cooling salve that would also heal any abrasions caused during the rough passionate sex.
The train chugged along on the train tracks, the swaying of the carriage jostling the letters in his lap as he bound them once again and reached into his satchel for the next pile. He had quite forgotten the emotional range that the letters seemed to work on; one letter would have made him optimistic about Harry's recovery and then there would be a bad day, a day so bad and so wrapped up in his own head that his only way to get it out was to write to Draco and vent his frustrations. On those days his words would hurt and cut into the stone barriers Draco had erected around himself for his recovery process, but a few words had slipped through the cracks and it had made even thinking about replying to the brunette that much more difficult. Draco did have his bad days too, mostly when his therapist cancelled an appointment and he had to travel to the hospital instead or even something as so simple as the weather coming down and making his joints ache and creak. On those days he was too tired and exhausted to care what Harry had to say and didn't reply at all to any of the younger man's letters until Severus came to see him at the end of the following February. He could still remember how cold it had been that day, but not nearly as cold as the look in Severus' eyes. The lecture he had received for not responding to Harry had followed him around for weeks after.
"Well everyone knows about my childhood and defeating the dark lord and winning the war and everything. All those books have been published and only one of them was actually written by me." Draco chuckled softly at this, "What I would like you to do, is write OUR story. Of how we met after the war. How we came to be together. Up to this holiday and whatever happens after."
Through a shaking sigh of relief –it was always hard to read but it hadn't been as grotesque and frightening as his mind had made out –Draco replaced the letter inside the envelope and then slipped it to the back of the pile before picking up the next one and slipping it out.
Harry turned to look up at the expressionless man and felt weak at the prospect that he certainly had indeed insulted Draco into not attending that evening. "Forgive me, Lord Malfoy, I had merely stated that I could see that he was wearing make-up to conceal how run down he was looking at the waxy quality of his skin and naturally he seems to have not appreciated such comments on my part."
They were perched on the stone steps over-looking the sandy beach as the tide glistened in the afternoon sun some hundred yards away. A thin blanket was hanging over their shoulders as the soft breeze in the air made Harry shiver violently. Draco had insisted that some fresh air and sunlight would do him good. He had been woken up at 3:54am to the sound of Harry vomiting heavily in the toilet. He had rushed in to his fiancé's side, and massaged his shoulders that were slick with cold sweat. When Harry had finally finished emptying his stomach, Draco had helped him to rinse his mouth out over the sink.
The only indication that anything had transpired out of the ordinary was the fact that Harry -his little Harry -was nowhere to be found.
!" Draco barked as loudly as he could, which was quite a strain considering how strained and tight his voice felt in his throat, as he threw his breakfast bowl over at the maid who had refused to leave him alone. She had insisted on trying to feed him but he hadn't been in the mood to be fed. He hadn't even been hungry, so why hadn't she listened to him? He was fed up with no one listening to him especially whenever he fell ill.
It was the first time, in any of the letters, that Harry had signed his full name. It was also the last letter that Draco had received that year. He refused to admit, even at that point, that he had been worried and fretted over Harry's well-being and sanity, especially when he didn't write to even complain about miniscule things. It had niggled at the back of his mind but he had refused to actually write to the young brunette man. He didn't actually get a chance to talk to Harry until in late July when he and his parents travelled the arduous journey along to the Lake District. Once they had settled into Severus' manor and taken a late afternoon nap to gather themselves, they went along to the conservatory and found Severus, Horace and a straight-laced, clean-cut young gentleman with his back to the three of them.
The silence that had stretched out over the conservatory was suffocating as Harry had so casually referred to his breakdown. Draco waited for something catastrophic to happen but nothing did. Harry simply arose from the table and extended his hand towards the blonde man before him and smiled warmly. With all eyes upon him Draco had jutted out his chin, stood up gracefully and smoothed his own waistcoat down and walked along past Harry out of the conservatory and into the lush green gardens that he had stared at all afternoon. He had to admit that the gardens were beautifully, and it wasn't exactly as stifling as he'd thought it would be walking side-by-side with Harry almost like old times, only not so close. It had been a pleasant afternoon and much to everyone's surprise it was the small pebbles of warm summer afternoons that started to pave the way back to some sort of relationship with one another, regardless of what sort of relationship it would be.
Draco looked up at his godfather and felt the fight ebb out of him for a moment. He clenched and unclenched his fingers and shuddered in his heavy dressing gown. The fire crackled in the grate before them and he stared into it before answering, "Fine, I'll write him a letter. But I shall decide where to go from there on."
Draco and Pansy's head jerked up at his question. "Why would I do that?" he asked after a moment of silence, "He's sitting at the Gryffindor table."
"Well one could try reading him medical journals about certain parts of the body; recent medical discoveries in the wizarding community that have cured other parts of the body and new theories of medicines about to be conducted and things like that. Having knowledge is one of the keys for people to believe that they are capable of fighting whatever ails them."
"Why?" Draco hissed, "so that you can watch him sleep? If he gets away from this Hellhole of depression maybe he will feel more inclined to respond to the treatment!" He did not care that he was snapping at her. She needed to be told. Just because she had received training and a degree to work as a Healer did not mean that she was qualified to know what was best for Harry. The world of medicine developed every day, every hour, and humans were only JUST starting to understand the basics of it all.
"I didn't come to gloat," the brunette boy insisted before softening his voice, "Do you want a dry shirt?" he asked.
By the time the young maid came back up for to bring them their mid-morning tea, Draco had to admit he found Harry's rendition of the medical journals a lot more interesting that he would have done if one of his old professors had been teaching him. He sat there in his straight-backed chair and steeped fingers and watched the young brunette man as he really got into the writing, and smiled to himself before he informed Draco of how a few of the discoveries had gotten muddled before printing, and some of the people got confused as to the positioning of some of the internal organs. As they sipped at their tea, Draco couldn't help but notice how truly entrancing the younger man was and he couldn't deny how intriguing Harry was becoming by the minute. He loathed admitting that his father had made an excellent choice in bringing Harry over to read to him.
"Don't be bitter," Severus snapped and watched as Harry twitched on the bed, his breathing easing into a normal rhythm. "All I am trying to point out is that a lot of your current problems could have been avoided if you had sought help. There's no weakness in asking for help, you know? Even I have asked for help on many occasions. Lucius often asks for my opinion on new deals he could make and how to go about some situations in politics, and even thought politics isn't my forte I manage to give him some insight."
The silence that followed was heavy with tension but he soon exhaled deeply and ran a hand down his face, "There were too many memories for me to go back there. I wanted to stay here for once."
"Of course I shall. Now go off and get as much work as you can do before tomorrow evening, alright?"
Draco wanted to object but he held his tongue and nodded, "Of course, Harry," he assured as he accepted the brunette back into his arms and cradled him in such an affectionate manner, it was such a sharp contrast to his sharp features and haughty disposition. Harry melted into his arms at the touch, his eyelids fluttering closed.
Lucius eyed him with scepticism before turning to face him, "And would you be willing to complete such a task for my son, Mister Potter? I daresay some company his own age would not go amiss either, if I dare say so myself."
Harry thought about it and hummed gently before smiling and taking a sip of his drink. "So we're friends now, are we?"
Harry looked around the room, at the fire burning in the fireplace, the glimmering stars, the holly on the mantle, and tinsel all over the borders of the room and criss-crossing over at the ceiling. "Do you really think we can be friends after everything?" he asked in a meek voice.
He was so absorbed in his own thoughts that he didn't hear the footsteps coming up the spiral staircase, or approach him across the stone balcony. He wasn't even aware of the other person until a hand rested on his shoulder and he lurched around, his eyes wide and wand jabbing into the shin of the sneak. "Merlin, don't do that!" he hissed out as his heart skipped a beat before calming down in his chest.
He had received a small parcel in the post that morning. Clearly it wasn't dangerous otherwise it would have been diverted. Unless the system was getting slack, which he didn't doubt would happen eventually. He had opened the parcel and inside was a small slip of paper and a phial of scented body oil to be dabbed behind the ear before he went to sleep. When he unfolded the slip of paper he was amazed that written across it was the password to the prefects' bathroom. As insulted as he was, he couldn't deny that he wouldn't mind taking a long, quiet soak in the swimming pool-sized bath-tub. He was curious about the body oil too.
"Draco please …" Harry begged. He wasn't sure if he was begging for more or begging for Draco to stop.
"Because he's my boyfriend," came a rasping voice from behind them both. They both turned with widened eyes.
"A likely story," Draco muttered to himself, before sighing. It was too cold to argue. It had been such a long, distressing day and his nerves were shot. He rubbed at his chest and drew in a couple of long breaths, "I can only handle a small number of things at a time. You know this. It would seem that father's death just pushed me out a little too far and I wasn't ready for all of it yet."
Draco nodded, his eyes heavily lidded and his lips parted as he breathed roughly and leaned in to press their mouths together, hot, wet and arousing. Harry let the warm mouth kiss him, fighting through the fog in his mind that was numbing his senses. He let out a soft hum of pleasure and let his eyes fluttered closed completely when he felt a sharp tooth graze across his bottom lip and tug gently. Draco pressed another kiss to his lips, and then another and another until he pulled Harry closed towards him with such hungry urgency that it ignited something within the younger man as fingers threaded through his thick, dark hair. "Take me to bed, Harry," he growled low in his throat despite the constrictions in his chest brought on by the weather, "Make love to me. I want you to make love to me all night and long."
"Severus let me in after he went to bed from the party," Draco stated before coming over to the brunette and placing both of his hands on the brunette's tense shoulders. "Relax, Harry," he breathed gently, "Nothing will happen that you don't want to happen, alright?"
Draco could feel his nose and eyes burning, the tears sticking to his lashes. Tremors were clawing at his body at the thought of having a wonderful future -with another man that was not Harry. No matter how close they grew, he would not be Harry. There was only one Harry. He sniffed loudly and wiped the cuff of his hoodie against his nose and eyes, trying to rid the hot tears now streaming down his cheeks. Through the blurred world of his tears Draco felt two thin arms wrap around him and curl him over against a weak chest. Thin fingers combed through his hair in a soothing manner. "Don't cry baby -I don't want to see you cry," came Harry's soft voice as his cool cheek was pressed against Draco's burning forehead. "Shh baby come on don't cry," the rocking motion was soothing but still Draco finally felt as though he had been torn from a very comfortable place.
As Draco busied himself filling both the water bottles with the scorching water, he coughed loudly to get Harry's attention, "Harry, come on, love it's time to wake up alright?" he called softly not wanting to aggravate his lover. In the mirror he watched Harry frown and roll onto his side with a small groan. Draco sighed as he fastened the cork into the second hot water bottle and brought them over to the bed. Being careful not to disturb Harry too much, he placed both bottles under the duvet cover at the bottom of the bed, so as to keep their feet warm. Harry was still sleeping stiffly on his side, so he removed the towel from the radiator where it had been warming whilst they were out and spread it out over his fiancés body.
,' he frowned wondering what on earth that was supposed to mean when the words faded and he gave a rueful little smile as he watched new words reappear, '
The North Pier had been fun; it was a little dull with a feeble attempt of an arcade at the front and then nothing except for a small ice cream parlor in the center and then a small darts-game at the very end. This was where Draco was determined to win a prize for Harry. It had taken thirteen darts and over thirty pounds in muggle money but they left that pier with Harry hugging the cuddliest cream fluffy teddy bear ever, that was almost the same size as his torso.
They stared at one another and breathed in deeply, their chests heaving as they glared at one another. Harry felt his heart drumming in his chest increase as Draco's grip loosened on his shirt and he jerked his hand away as though he was being burned. He sneered and turned away from Harry and stalked back across the room, raking his hands roughly through his messy blonde hair and groaning, kicking his feet at the floor and groaning out loud before turning around and yelling loudly, "I can't fucking believe this!" he shouted at the room, his rough voice echoing out across the scorched stone walls. Harry watched as the blonde boy paced, his stomach tightly knotted and throbbing with pain. He didn't know how to approach him. He didn't know how to move without his stomach screaming out to him. "Why the fuck would you even care about what happens to me?!" Draco sneered out, his red-rimmed eyes burning with tears.
Harry shook his head and came around to the side of the bed, leaning close to Draco and reaching for his hand. The pale hand shifted away and was tucked underneath his arm. Harry's hand froze in mid-air and he could feel his heart crack down the middle. He held Draco's gaze for a moment, feeling all the pent up emotion from the last few months boil inside him, before he lowered his hand to his side. "Is that really how you feel?" he muttered gently.
Severus frowned a little and hummed low in his throat, "You should have come to me before when Dreamless Sleep would have benefited you. As it stands, taking it now would only be making your situation worse. I know depression isn't easy to deal with Harry but –"
Harry nodded his head, "He was but apparently there was an accident with one of the auror missions and several of the men had serious wounds. All of the staff was needed. It couldn't have happened on a worse day I know. I tried to tell him that I needed to get back to be with you, but he insisted that since I was not legally bound to you like I would be to a wife, it wasn't too great an emergency, funeral or no. I had wanted to yell at him there and then and show him the ring but I didn't want that sort of damage to be done to either of us. I tried to finish as fast as I could but they just kept sending more emergencies my way. I truly am sorry I couldn't have stayed. Your father was a great man. I had and still have a great deal of respect for him."
Draco cleared his throat but made no move to sit down. The glares from the surrounding tables were burning a hole through the back of his skull, but he couldn't back down. Not now. They had a friendship -a very intense friendship -and he was allowed to talk to Harry whenever he damn well pleased. "I was wondering that, if you were finished, you might join me for a walk around the lake."
Draco smiled to himself as he mounted the stairs with the small suitcase in his hand as he followed Cass up to the second floor. Harry had opted to stay on the small benched out front with Seeker, claiming he wanted to spend as much time in the sun as possible. Draco did not mind. It gave him time to sort the room out; when Cass left him at the door with the keys dangling in the lock and a bright grin, Draco sighed happily and walked into the room with both bags in hand. The decor was bold; white bed, sheets and pillow cases and walls and furniture; however the carpet, wall opposite the door, and the coverlet on the bed where the deepest shade of ruby red he could ever have imagined. He doubted that Gryffindor tower ever had this shade of red within it. He removed his wand from his sleeve and flicked it wordlessly; the suitcases unpacked themselves and he watched with a smile as their shoes aligned beneath the radiator, the shirts and trousers hung up in the wardrobe and the jumpers and underwear were folded and neatly placed in the three small drawers.
Harry was trying hard to suppress a smile as he poked as his pasta with his fork, "can we go tomorrow?" he asked hopefully.
Draco peered into the bedroom just in time to see Harry growl in frustration, tossing the pyjamas off of the end of the bed, his face contorted with anger. "Harry?" Draco whispered, edging just inside the doorframe, not wanting his irritated lover to lash out at him.
It had been a few years after that summer that everything had started to go wrong. It had started off fairly simple at first; a missed meal here, a late night there, but sooner or later Harry had started taking up night-shifts that would bleed him dry of both energy and liveliness. It hadn't been so bad at first, just a couple of incidents over the space of a couple of months. It hadn't really bothered Draco at all, a minor irritation that was quickly dissolved when Harry would take a couple of days off to spend with Draco. They had taken daily strolls around Brittany, dipping into each and any shop that took their fancy, and even stopped inside a coastal hotel that looked out over the sea and the sandy beach below. They had sipped at sweetened teas and eaten little cakes from a sweet, elderly muggleborn lady who had a young wizard for a grandson who would race along the sea wall with his friends, a little wooden muggle train clutched in his hand. Draco would chatter away about the incessant regulars who came into the shop almost daily to demand the newest stock he had. He would then listen to Harry about the abnormal amount of aurors he got in weekly who got splinched whilst apparating and using the floo network. One man had lost his eyebrow in Switzerland!
He wanted to go and see his companion? Lover? Whatever he was, Draco wanted to see him and make sure he was alright. He huffed at the irony.
"I know it hasn't seemed like it, but I have missed being with you," he murmured so softly he wasn't sure the blonde had heard him, "I don't know what is going on with me and I really wish I could fix it for you," he looked up to see that Draco's eyes were gleaming as much as his own. "I wish I could be good enough for you," he choked as his voice broke, his eyes so hot and exhausted from crying so much over the last few months that he shuddered and wrapped his arms tighter around himself.
They kept the dinner conversation light, not veering onto anything too heavy like why this was the earliest Harry had been home in the last month. For his part, Draco couldn't risk himself looking too disheartened. He was relieved when Harry had promised him early that morning that he would be home at a reasonable time for dinner. More reasonable than it had been recently anyway. The food was good, thank goodness, because if Draco had unintentionally gave Harry food-poisoning after a long month of late shifts and running himself into the ground, he didn't think he could forgive himself. Draco didn't know what was bothering his lover –could he still call him that? –but whatever it was it was making the younger man look older than his thirty-two years. Draco already knew he was beginning to age with his receding hairline and weakening muscles but he still made an effort to take a stroll around central Paris with his mother and a few friends from his University days. He needed to keep himself occupied outside of his business with Harry, although, now even that was difficult now that he had to work in the shop day-in and day-out.
He glanced down at the book in his hand; an old time favourite of his and well-read if the dog-eared pages were anything to go by. Harry had scowled at the condition of the book and told Draco to use a bookmark. That had been the morning before they went down to Brighton for the weekend. Seeker had enjoyed it -bounding along the beach and harassing the sea-gulls. He and Harry had thoroughly enjoyed chasing after him. One of the tokens of that mini-break was now staring him right in the face; there, wedged in the place he had last stopped reading, was the white framed strip of photographs taken in one of the muggle photo-booths.
By the time they were exhausted enough and lying in a tangled heap on a pile of their clothes, the flagstones burning with their body heat, and lying with Harry's head against Draco's shoulder. They were both breathing deeply and both completely mind-blown. The clock chiming eleven at night, Harry let out a soft groan and rolled over so that his forehead was pressed against Draco's flushed skin, "I don't really want to leave. Not after that. I'm dreading tomorrow now."
As he slotted his key into the lock of the door to the apartment he felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up on end and a shiver run down the length of his spine. Frowning heavily, he turned the key and pushed the door inwards and stepped into his dark apartment. As he observed the room he was confronted with, even in the darkening gloom he couldn't see anything out of place. Frowning even deeper, he dropped his keys onto a nearby table, and began turning on the oil lamps dotted about the room. The room came alive bringing small objects into sharp relief as he went about unfastening his waistcoat, shirt and trousers before toeing his shoes off and slipping down into a nearby chair. He ran a hand down his face and sighed wearily. It had been a long tiresome day. He pinched the bridge of his nose and his eyes fell upon his briefcase once again, the letters sticking out from underneath the flap. He bent down, his knees pressing into his chest, as he tugged the last couple of bundles out. His breath was a little shaky as his fingers hesitated on the already opened envelop. He didn't know why he was hesitating. He knew what the letters said, and he knew the course they took. He also knew how they ended. Did he really want to read them all over again? Slipping one out, he held it at an angle so that the firelight caught it.
On one of Draco's braver nights he and Harry went walking along the streets of Paris, not bothering with travelling cloaks as the weather was rather balmy to say the least. They had walked along the Seine and then gotten some port at a high-end bar that Lucius often frequented with clients. They had drunk and talked and become a little careless as they wandered back through the darkening streets, almost leaning against one another out of comfort rather than the bubbles fizzing at the back of their throats. Harry had felt somewhat lightheaded and didn't really remember climbing up the marble staircase or even somehow being coherent enough to change out of his clothes and slip into one of Draco's nightshirts that had been too baggy on him but he didn't are because it had smelled wonderful. He did, however, remember waking up bleary-eyed with a pressure humming in his skull in a grand four-poster bed –and he wasn't alone. He had wanted to yelp at Draco's arm so carelessly tossed over his naked waist, for the nightshirt had ridden up to his chest during his sleep, but somehow the sound had latched in his throat. He didn't leap out of bed and hurry to his own room. Instead he settled back down and watched Draco as the man slept peacefully beside him, unaware of the flush on Harry's cheeks or the loud hammering of the brunette man's heart against his ribs.
Draco looked into Harry's eyes and smiled softly, "Don't be silly, love. You're not a baby," he leaned over and pressed a kiss to Harry's forehead, "Now why don't you go in the living room and rest whilst I finish this and take it down to the car?"
Harry shifted, bracing himself on Draco's knee with one hand while he guided himself. It was uncomfortable at first. Harry grabbed a small bottle of lube -manually -and made it a little easier to slide inside the blonde. It took a little while, a lot of pushing and stopping and tiny thrusts to get Draco used to the intrusion.
When the sound of panicked footsteps rushed up behind him, creaking on the floorboards, and the door slamming loudly in its frame, he flipped around in his chair ready to shout at whoever it was when he felt his chest loosen a little and his heart to calm down. "What the bloody hell do
Lucius chuckled dryly to himself, "On the contrary I found myself intrigued to meet you when he returned home in such a state. It seems he hung onto your every word and was quite interested." He turned to look down at Harry, "I pray to Merlin that you were not giving my son false hope, Mister Potter. If there is a way to cure my son or at the very least ease his discomfort, then I would be grateful in more ways than one. He is my only child after all."
Without a backwards glance to his friends, Harry followed the blonde man out of the Great Halls and out onto the frosty grounds, the grass crisp and crunchy under their feet. The chill in the air made their breath rise up in front of them but he couldn't deny that he was glad for the escape from the Great Hall. His heart was still stuttering in his chest at the fact that Draco was the one to provide the reprieve, as he'd previously wanted to keep their friendship to themselves. He was glad that Draco was becoming more confident with their friendship, despite how he had often dreamed that maybe they would be able to grow even closer.
"Act as though you doubt that I wanted to repair this relationship because of how I felt for you instead of not wanting it to be for naught." He shot an exasperated look at the brunette across from him, his thick dark hair tinged with greying threads at the temples gleaming in the firelight. He leaned forward in his chair, "I decided that I saw the man I fell in love with once again. I saw the man I love coming back to me where he belongs. I saw you getting better and getting the best possible care in the world and that made me think just how serious you were about everything we discussed in those letters. How almost losing me must have scared you that much to catapult you out of your insufferable denial. I'm not making excuses for you and we both know that, but I'm
Harry shrugged awkwardly, "Well sure but now I know I'll miss out on something if I don't ... come out of it."
,' resounded through his head like a mantra. He watched, fascinated, as Harry ripped the foil packet open with his teeth and slipped the condom out. He grimaced at the oily little disc and how Harry rolled it down his shaft with minimal fumbling.
Harry hummed softly in his ear, "I'm so glad that I found you, Draco Malfoy." Draco felt a sting of tears threatening his eyes but he blinked them away, almost ashamed that he were the one about to cry instead of his lover. "Can you promise me something, Draco?" Harry asked softly, as he held out his left hand and turned it a fraction left and then right, letting the band catch the early morning light.
"For you to vent," he replied evenly, "You have a lot of anger that you need to get out. Don't deny it!" he stated quickly just as Draco was about to retort. He watched, satisfied, as the blonde's mouth clamped shut again. "You need to vent and that's okay. If you want, I can help you with that. We can do it in the room, just as long as there are no cutting curses flying about, alright?"
He patted his pockets down and then widened his eyes mockingly, "Oh no! Would you believe it? I've only gone and lost him again."
"You've practically ignored me all day, I just want to know if I've done something to upset you," Draco state as though it wasn't really a big deal with a shrug.
Harry hummed, listening to the dulling thud of the blonde's heart. "Did you like it?" It had been the question on his mind throughout the majority of the evening, not wanting to jinx the moment.
"You can and you will," Severus stated as he strode out of the ward, leaving Harry standing there awkwardly in some borrowed clothes and edging weakly down the aisle between the beds of sick patients until he came around the pale curtain and his eyes landed on a pale Draco sitting upright in bed against his pillows, looking grey in the late afternoon sunlight pouring in through the high, narrow windows. His eyes flickered up when he saw Harry standing awkwardly at the end of his bed, but his expression didn't change when their eyes locked onto one another.
Harry nodded his head and then looked up when a couple of young men in grubby clothes carried a large tin tub into the bedroom, water sloshing weakly just over the sides and onto the marble floor. A young maid hurried behind and mopped the floor dry. They set the bath down and Harry thanked them and then dismissed them all with a polite smile. As soon as Draco was stripped down, his face aflame as he tensed up as Harry lifted him up and out of his bed before he lowered the blonde man into the warm soapy water. As Draco sank down so that his chin was resting on the water, Harry fumbled around rolling his sleeves up and then dribbling a phial of pale pink liquid into the bath. Immediately, Draco felt his legs strengthen a little in their resolve, having felt as weak as spaghetti not seconds beforehand. He felt like he had more energy. He hadn't felt so relieved in ages. He hummed as he soaked in the bath, oblivious to the made stripping the bed of his silk bed sheets. He didn't register Harry telling them to have basic cotton sheets, silk would do nothing for his fever and they weren't to ever use it again when he was ill or on the verge of getting ill. They'd nodded and took the ruined sheets down to the furnace.
The castle is eerily quiet, save for the quiet murmuring of conversations and the occasional sob as people mourn the loss of their loved ones.
it’s Harry that Draco has done all of this for. He wants to scream and cry that he loves Harry, he loves him so much to give up his own happiness to ensure Harry’s safety. But he can’t do that. He can never do that, because now, Harry will hate him like he had before, and he will think of Draco as nothing more than a Death Eater and a murderer.
The whispers travel around the castle like a wildfire, taunting Draco from every corridor he turns to, every classroom he enters. They rustle through the silence like the turning of pages in the quiet library, and Draco has to take several deep breaths to prevent his throat from closing up.
and from the heat of his body sprawled upon Draco’s own, Draco’s stomach twists into knots, something visceral swirling hot with longing, a
“I didn’t do it for you,” Draco hisses. “I did it for him. To keep him safe,” he adds, and Draco wonders why he is so desperate for others to believe his reasoning.
“Snape saw me, and made him close the door, so I don’t know what happened after,” Harry grumbles, and Draco’s heart kicks into overdrive. He
Amongst the roar of the fire, Draco hears a terrible scream, and through his watery eyes, he sees Crabbe’s grip on the side of a table loosen. He falls, limbs flailing as the flames swallow him whole.
Something splatters down onto his parchment, a water droplet. Another one lands right next to it, and Draco’s vision blurs. He feels something wet slide down his cheeks, and Draco watches as the droplets soak into the parchment and the ink fades and smears across it.
“Do you think he’s killed someone or something?” Harry asks suddenly, and Draco sees Weasley flinch. Draco’s heart twinges inside his chest, because Harry couldn’t be more wrong. If only he knew the truth, he would not be sitting there accusing Draco of murder.
She comes over to him several minutes later and tells him she has healed him to the best of her ability.
He sees Longbottom carrying bodies into the Great Hall from the rubble gathered on the grounds outside. Draco looks away from the small body held in his arms and stares outside, the darkness blinks back at him.
Hidden within the darkness, Draco sees the Dark Lord, nearing the castle with his army of Death Eaters. They gather in front of the steps, and Draco sees Hagrid’s looming figure, bound by ropes.
Draco screams, and tries to find his wand from where it had rolled away from him. Draco locates his wand, and by the time he turns around to stun Crabbe, he’s already running away.
His father comes to stand on his other side, and his mother grasps Draco’s upper arm in a firm hold.
Draco feels relief and exhilaration flood through him, and choking back a cry, Draco pulls Harry forward towards him. He wraps his arms around Harry’s frame, one arm lacing around Harry’s waist and the other coming up to grip his shoulder. He holds him tightly against Draco’s body and Harry squeezes back just as tightly.
The dark circles under his eyes, however, makes the hard lines of his face more prominent than usual. He looks exhausted, Draco thinks idly, like he hasn’t slept in weeks.
Summer passes through a haze of darkness and misery. The Dark Lord takes up residence in his house, and he appoints Draco as the youngest member to join his command. Draco knows that he is punishing Draco for his father winding up in Azkaban, but he also knows that rejecting such a proposal will put his mother at risk.
To his dismay, he utters an Unforgivable, his mind muddled with fear. But the words do not get a chance to leave his mouth, and Harry fires an unfamiliar spell at him, as a blinding streak of white light hurtles towards him.
But with everything between them having been tipped out of balance, with everything they’ve gone through in this war, with everything they’ve seen and done, Draco isn’t sure if what he wants is what he deserves.
Draco looks at her, and sees the way she’s sitting up straight uncomfortably, the way she looks as though she is in pain. It reminds him of Granger, all those months ago, when she had caught him listening in to their conversation.
He’s looking for a book for McGonagall’s transfiguration essay, when he hears hushed whispers. He pays it no mind at first, but the voice is too familiar to ignore.
“We would have gotten help,” Pansy says, jumping in to help, and she does a good job of looking honestly apologetic, “But there was no time. Swear it!”
” The section of the floor she is pointing at shifts, just a bit. Then, with a flick of her wand upward she says, “
“If you’d allow it, I’d really like to try,” he says, wand still pointed at Harry, but he turns to smile pointedly at Umbridge, like some kind of secret.
“We’ll talk to you later, Max,” Potter is saying behind Draco, “I gotta make sure the ghost doesn’t go off and pick a fight with the wrong person.”
It probably doesn’t help that Tracey, very abruptly, tells him never to become a healer. Ignoring better judgement, the new DA member asks for clarification.
Instead it had been their mother, who very gently explained that Max’s grandfather, their father’s father, had passed away rather suddenly and they needed some time alone.
“Why do you have a crazy portrait of your mother in here?” Draco demands the second he sees the man who had clearly been eavesdropping.
“No. He’s been busy with… whatever he’s been doing,” Potter replies, spitting out the last of his words with a surprising amount of disdain. “Nobody’s told me anything. Hardly anyone owls me back, and when they do it’s vague and clipped and
“No,” Draco replies immediately, leaning back in his tub and rolling his eyes. “That wasn’t scary at all.”
“We both know what I meant,” Draco drawls, but Potter cuts them both off by recounting exactly how to get the Room of Requirement to work.
He was becoming more aware of the Gryffindor’s reactions, however, along with his friends, and he wasn’t sure what that meant. It was like a map in his head. This thing got this reaction, this comment was off limits, this joke got no response, and so on.
“Hello, Malfoy,” Granger greets with a polite nod. Despite her finding it much easier to be around Draco now, there is still a stiffness to her shoulders. This isn’t like their silent meetings in the library, where they hardly speak unless it is about homework or a book. This is a loud, crowded social gathering, and neither was prepared for small talk with each other.
“Have we found everything?” she questions when he approaches her, eying his hefty stack of books with the slightest of smiles on her face. He nods up at her, grinning despite himself.
“Thank you, Miss Babbage. I suspect these incidents are impossible to explain using Muggle means, yes?” now she was looking at Draco and the boy startled.
“He just came back from his career counseling meeting,” Eve, who decided that sitting on Draco’s legs was a totally normal place to perch, says while flipping through a book Draco doesn’t care about.
it, logically, but the idea didn’t want to settle in his chest. It was like there was someone else inside him, refusing entry to his heart.
Draco lets out a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding and approaches, eyes wide. On the plaque on the cage it reads “Eagle Owl (female) - Temperamental.” He didn’t know what they meant by temperamental, but the creature was stunning in his eyes.
“What do people dating each other do on Valentine’s Day?” Draco wonders aloud as he walks along the edge of the lake. His camera is out, snapping photos of the new plant growths as they emerge with the shift into Spring, but he’s not paying the closest attention.
“We should go,” Potter whispers and both Draco and Granger nod in agreement, the three hurrying away and towards the castle.
Draco felt a little bad sending Sirius and Potter into the proverbial pit, but it was temporary, and Sirius wouldn’t be doing anything Order related while he was present. It would all work out fine…
Questions start flying and Draco answers them to the best of his ability, remembering Arthur Weasley despite himself, and then Daphne says, “My mummy and dad told me Muggles aren’t that bad, but I was never sure. You make them sound okay, though.”
Ah, so Cho Chang had come to greet Potter, and Weasley had accidentally run her off with his big mouth. Judging by the severe blush on Potter’s face he’s completely mortified by the encounter, attempting to hide further and further into Draco’s side, like he can fuse with his robes and disappear forever.
Eve smirks at him, not quite laughing, but appreciating their back and forth. They’ll have to check on the Ravenclaws tomorrow, or wait long enough for Tracey to reattach to Luna the next chance she gets.
“And you don’t want to be held accountable?” Granger questions, sounding a touch suspicious now, and Draco gives her a sour look.
“Then let’s head back to the house and get something to eat. We can start looking over the papers tomorrow,” Sirius says and begins walking. Neither boy has any arguments against that and quickly move to follow.
“You continue to be truly hopeless, Longbottom,” Draco says with a bored look, giving the book a once over, before shrugging and holding it out. The other boy, very hesitantly, begins to reach out, but then Draco pulls it back like he’s changed his mind and Longbottom makes a strangled noise. “This is an advanced subject,” he says, “Sixth year at least. Did Pomfrey really give you this?”
“No room,” Draco immediately says, looking over, and finds Potter standing with his hand still gripping the compartment door. Green eyes look around the space, eyes falling on the free seats Draco and Eve are currently using as footrests.
“The day after?” Draco’s brows furrow as he begins to walk again, but doesn’t go back to his pictures.
Now they also house the Death’s Head Hawk Moth chrysalis, a blacked-out vial of seven-day-old dew from 12 Grimmauld Place, and, most recently, a mandrake leaf from the second years’ mandrakes in Greenhouse 3.
“Gentlemen, so glad you could come,” Draco offers a fake business smile to the ginger duo as they join him in an old, abandoned Charms classroom on the third floor. Draco sits at the head desk where the professor would usually stay.
Somehow Draco manages to get one of his hands up and plants it over Potter’s mouth. His smirk is a scowl, now, and he grunts, “That was a lot less appeasing than I’d hoped it would be.” He glances over Potter’s shoulder at Granger, who looks shaken, but not as bad as Potter, and is giving her friend very worried glances. “Explain,” he snaps at her, and it is a testament to how shaken they must be when she, too, does as asked without complaint.
Draco has no choice. He has none at all. He has to turn and walk alongside the Ministry woman. He has to force an expression of giddy interest. He has to smile - thin and cruel - as he looks at the Gryffindors and pretends like he’s actually enjoying this.
Granger had been telling Draco about how blind Potter was. Apparently, he’d gone to send a letter to Sirius and had run into Cho Chang, the girl “clearly flirting” with Potter, according to Granger, but Potter had hardly reciprocated. In fact, also according to Granger, he’s been incredibly rude and standoffish, attempting to brush her off.
“If you’re going to ruin the mood with your whimpering, at least do it with your lions. This is just pathetic.”
He’d asked Max’s mother what it was like, since she knew almost as much as Draco’s mother, and she’d answered him honestly.
“Self-proclaimed,” Draco concurs, “pureblooded families that have also remained pureblooded for as long as possible. Which… well, it means incest and inbreeding.” The table’s faces all immediately crinkle up in distaste. “I’d like to point out, however, that the Malfoy line actually avoided these things, though after all of the supremacy, prejudice, and likely murder… eh, it’s a void point…”
Draco would have usually complained, but he needed them to like him, so all his complaining fell to his mother, the house elves, and Eve.
“Whoa, Harry, you look awful,” George says and Draco looks around swiftly, eyes wide when he sees a downtrodden Potter walking right past them, a vacant look in his eyes until he’d been called out to. It looked like he hadn’t even noticed the four scheming students.
!” he says firmly, the new image in his head. He tries to force out the image and energy behind it through his arm and to the tip of his wand.
“Oh no,” Harry suddenly groans, making Draco look up. The other boy seems to have finally begun to fully wake up, eyes more alert as he looks at the schedule in dread. “We have History of Magic first thing tomorrow morning…”
A giddy, dumb chuckle is all the warning Draco gets before Weasley is hurrying over to a random door up ahead. Draco pauses to watch the idiot’s back as he swings open the door without preamble.
A jab to Draco’s ribs has him yelping in surprise before he throws a glare at Pansy and her sharp elbow. “What?” he hisses, angry, and she gives him a bland look before nodding down an adjacent hall. He takes a few moments to keep glaring at her before relenting and looking where she directed.
“Luna filled us in on what happened after you guys got separated,” Draco says softly and, with some urging, convinces Harry to sit on the ground with him. They aren’t out of the woods yet, but they can at least get some rest.
and it is by an author named J. R. R. Tolkien. Draco has never heard of this book before, which surprises him.
Draco turns away to start marching towards the Great Hall, but only just in time to see Harry smile weakly after him, an ease to his posture finally returning. “Sure thing,” Harry agrees and the four all head out, Hermione falling into step at Draco side, no words said, mostly because she’s still trying not to laugh.
Umbridge won’t stand for it, though, hurrying around her desk to grab ahold of Edgecombe’s shoulders and demand she finish telling her what she needs to know about the alleged “Dumbledore’s Army.”
Harry glances at him, movements too sharp, before he forces himself to release a burst of air from his chest. “That sounds good,” he agrees and Draco nods once. “You know, Draco… You’re a lot nicer than I’d thought you’d be.”
One thing Draco was quickly learning about Muggles is that they had the weirdest, and most interesting, of products. He’d never had the chance prior to the 1995 summer to truly explore Muggle places, his parents constantly looking over him, and he was eager to finally enjoy himself and explore the mysterious, Muggle world.
When he’s sure Edgecombe is gone, Draco hurries forward in her place, towards the office door, and looks to his left to spot the twins down the corridor for just a moment. They offer Draco two, proud thumbs up, but the blonde is already waving them off urgently. They need to go down and warn the DA immediately while Draco tries to control Umbridge.
“You might as well come,” Weasley says with a shrug. “Nobody thinks you’re as bad as you used to be and with Percy doing… whatever the hell he’s doing, we got a little extra space.”
The five of them look to the door she had been trying to open. If it had already been locked, and it wasn’t the Love Chamber, then it must be the Locked Room, right? When Draco and Weasley had been here before, they hadn’t come in contact with the mysterious door, but Draco hadn’t read anything anywhere about it locking the other doors.
“I’d rather not talk here. Too many wandering eyes and ears,” Draco warns, glancing at the compartment door. The two grudgingly agree, still looking worried, but no one brings it up for the rest of the trip to Hogwarts.
“Do you mean Muggleborns, darling?” his mother asks, brows slightly pinched, and Draco nods. “What about them?”
Granger has begun to list off all the facts she knows about snow leopards, which sound interesting, and Mrs. Weasley has sat back down at the head of Potter’s bed, but Draco isn’t paying much attention. His focus has shifted back to the boy in the bed, who is grasping desperately for the opportunity to just not think about what has happened, and failing quickly.
Draco has to fight the urge to reach for his wand, anger very swiftly boiling to the surface, and he has to halt in the hall to take a breath. Up ahead, Weasley has noticed the pause and has also stopped and turned around, glaring at the blonde.
Draco feels ice down his spine. It feels a lot colder up in the Astronomy Tower all of a sudden, but he can’t bring himself to move. Can’t bring himself to do anything.
He pats Blaise’s hand for good measure, then turns out of his grip and slips to the side of the room. He’ll have to wait and watch for an opening, but he’s accepted that he won’t like it and will just have to swallow his impulses. He wasn’t a damn Gryffindor. He could do this.
“We’ve all sat down and spoken in detail about these things,” Draco replies simply, folding his hands on top of the table. “You all might be okay with running into this blind, but we are not. We have weighed pros and cons, plotted out escape routes, devised believable lies for as many situations as we could consider, and are regularly paying close attention to any other Slytherin who might be interested in the DA.”
“Well, you have it,” Lupin’s smile turns a little humorous and he shifts his weight to hold his case more comfortably.
“You are such a prat,” Potter rolls his eyes and Draco, feeling a spike of immaturity, sticks his tongue out at him.
“We are working on some of Longbottom’s fears,” Draco explains, eyes flicking past the Gryffindor to the herd of thestrals currently nibbling at some carrion. It looks a little old, and mostly eaten, by this point. “We’re starting with the school’s… horses, since they are remarkably peaceful,” he gives Longbottom a pointed look, “but they still frighten our emotionally fragile friend, here.”
No, instead she had finally excused the rest of her Inquisitorial Squad, save for Draco. This was because she wanted to drag him down to speak with his godfather, likely thinking Draco’s presence would somehow put Snape in a better mood.
As it turned out the girl had a very similar problem to Draco. Strange things happened to her that she could never explain. Strange things like what happened to Draco.
It’s a few moments later before the wandmaker returns, looking thoughtful as he presents a new wand to Draco. “Try this one,” he says and immediately the blonde is curious. All the others Ollivander had named what the wand had been made of, but not this one.
“Overreact? Overreact?!” Draco repeats, throwing his head back to glare at Granger in astonishment. “If anything you’re all underreacting!”
“Mr. Malfoy, you are meant to be in bed,” his godfather says, a warning in his voice. Draco immediately puts on his best puppy-dog eyes. They never work on Snape, but Fudge seems like a highly emotional man.
Sirius has shifted back even further by the time Draco reaches him, his muscles burning with the strain of his controlled movements, and Draco is met with his next problem. He could grab Sirius by his clothes, but those could rip too easily. Then again, Draco could bite into Sirius’s arm, seriously hurting him, but making sure he doesn’t
“Don’t tell Daphne that. She’s going to want a far more romantic story,” Eve smirks over her book. She and Granger both have matching
“Very well, Draco,” Skeeter says, voice tight and face drawn. She was livid, the anger dripping off her body. “It would appear I have no choice. I will help with your… schoolyard games.”
“Your father works with Muggle stuff. And you, Harry, your mom’s muggleborn! How did you two not know this?” he demands, looking between his two schoolmates. Ron turns pink and Harry looks away, clearing his throat.
“I’m sorry, I’m just really enjoying the image of Narcissa Malfoy listening to heavy rock,” Eve smirks.
So, despite Harry passing on his own password as well, it was only Harry who ended up down in Draco’s dorm room on the regular. Sometimes only for an hour or two, sometimes for the whole night. They still go to linger around with their friends at their highly warded library table or up in the Room of Requirement, and they still sneak up to the Astronomy Tower to talk to Max or walk around secluded spots on the grounds, but it is nice to have one more place where they can completely relax.
“Oh, stop pouting,” Max snickers and Draco quickly forces his face back to something neutral, refusing to admit he actually had been pouting. “There’s bound to be tons of machines there that’ll cause radio interference. Papa said so. We won’t know for sure until I get there, but...”
“Actually… I came up with one over the Christmas Break, if you’re interested?” Weasley admits, scratching at the back of his neck self consciously. Immediately, Granger moves towards him.
The blond finally moves forward to help her when it is clear she’s making no progress, and as he opens the door and smiles down at her he coos, “Milady.”
“I’m from America. Playing tourist with my parents and my stupid older brother.” The kid turns to motion towards what must be the rest of their family. The father is making a fool of himself, his oversized glasses slipping down his nose as he excitedly examines every single plaque, sign, and exhibit. The mother is smiling at her husband, her features round but elegant, which surprises Draco. Muggles aren’t meant to be elegant. The apparent brother is standing even farther away with weird earmuffs on that have a string attaching them to a little, black device.
Near the end of the evening, however, exhausted and weary from the day, Draco turns to his mother when they get a moment alone, tapping her hand until she looks down at him. “That Weasley boy… He said something I didn’t like,” he begins and Narcissa’s eyes narrow just marginally.
“Minister Fudge,” Draco calls, standing up before he can leave. Everyone looks at him, which is a little unnerving, but he ignores them and makes his way over to the Minister. He was just nearly out the door again but had stopped to give Draco a very displeased glare.
“Well, Fred, I think you might just be right! Why, I think the best word to describe little Malfoy now would be…”
“Aww, but I thought you wanted to be his fwiend!” Max teases, not at all offering the sympathetic ear that Draco really shouldn’t have been expecting.
Draco’s brows rise at that. Too? These guys couldn’t possibly be first years. Could they? They were so big! But… the nervousness might be because they were new and he supposes they could just come from bigger boned families, or something.
Which is a dreadful mistake, really, because Draco is immediately pointing his wand at him and saying, “
to give her a confused look. “Since she thinks we’re an item? Which, for her, is like an engagement.”
“I think that’d be a good one,” Eve says, stepping out to show off the short black dress she’d picked out, decked out in all kinds of belts around her waist, neck, arms, and wrists.
“Nothing, nothing,” Eve waves him off and Draco glances at Potter, expecting some equal level of confusion. Except the raven-haired boy isn’t looking back. Instead he’s looking ahead, eyes a little wide, and his cheeks and ears pink. Draco doesn’t have a chance to inquire what might be wrong because Eve is already talking again, saying that there’s a gift shop just ahead, and Potter is already following after her before Draco can get a word in at all.
“I know, I know, it’s just funny,” Max says, sounding cheerful. It was just midnight at Hogwarts, which meant it should be about six where Max lived. They were probably far from being tired after their Christmas festivities. “You’re just so posh! Did you dance with every girl? What about the guys?”
“We all currently are, Potter, don’t act high and mighty. Here,” he hands over the form given to him by the official and Potter slips it into a pocket. “If anyone asks if you’ve been checked in, show them that.”
“They’re his legal guardians, then?” Max’s mother asks and Draco hums an affirmative. “And he has no one else who he can go to?”
Harry, however, had a bit more of a backbone to fight with. His response to hostilities was sass and fire. Longbottom’s was hiding away and disappearing.
It takes a moment, but then he’s extracting a handful of floo powder that he dumps into Harry’s open palm.
“Not many people do,” Duke smiles softly at Harry. “I know my opinion will mean little to you, we just met, but I wanted to tell you that I am proud of you, Mr. Potter. You have stuck with your convictions through all of the ridicule and cruelty, and that takes a strong kind of soul.”
For a second Draco catches Pansy’s eye. They don’t nod or move or even try to express anything, yet Draco thinks he knows exactly what she wants to say. She’s solid and decided. Whatever is going to happen is going to be bad, and they cannot let that pass.
Then strong, familiar, shaking hands are grabbing his pelt and pulling him. He can smell Harry’s scent through his sudden, feral haze, refocusing his tempers as he releases the Death Eater. Harry has smelled frightened ever since Draco found him in the Ministry, but it had been buried underneath the adrenaline. Now it wafts worryingly around them.
It is only as he reaches the corridor that the Slytherin common room is hidden in that it hits him like a ton of bricks. He remembers a conversation at the Gryffindor table and Fred and George’s obvious distaste towards the Slytherins thanks to their Quidditch team. These were the cliché Slytherins. These were the ones that exemplified every, negative Slytherin stereotype. These were the ones everyone else used as an example when saying how bad Slytherin was.
“It’s a Suicide Curse?!” Potter nearly jumps up, looking horrified, but Draco just keeps giggling. It seems to be just enough to keep the boy from storming off and telling a professor that Draco has lost his mind.
“Take a look around, if you like,” says the male employee, not moving from his spot but at least looking up at them.
The moment they had entered the hospital wing, however, he had been pushed out of the way, the Weasley’s and Granger already waiting inside. A familiar looking beetle alights on Draco’s shoulder as he slips off to a seat in the corner, away from the action, but able to observe everything. It was clear he would only get in the way otherwise.
“She’ll be fine,” Pomfrey assures, with a small smile and nod. “She’s been taken to St. Mungo's, but she’ll be back in perfect health, I am certain of it.”
“Narcissa,” he greets, and from an outsider’s point-of-view it is sure to look perfectly proper, but for everyone else it is blatantly obvious Sirius is being an ass. His expression, his over-dramatic motions, and his tone all speak to a mocking mood, surely repulsed by pureblood manners.
It had been hell to convince Dumbledore that this was a good plan, bringing Potter out for a day for himself. Sticking to Muggle London had been Draco’s first suggestion, since the Death Eaters wouldn’t be paying very close attention to it. They also wouldn’t dare make any move in the middle of all these crowds, not while they were trying to stay out of the Ministry’s sights.
“I do not doubt you could, but it would be best not to test these things out on a bunch of impressionable children, don’t you think?”
“How lovely,” Skeeter drones, clearly not impressed, and Eve snorts as she walks past Draco and Skeeter and over to the windows. The Slytherin girl turns back to look at Skeeter, a smirk on her face, before tapping out a particular pattern against the glass.
“I haven’t even proven myself, yet. The Dark Lord is only now giving me the chance to prove myself. Allow me to prove myself, Aunt Bella.”
But this chrysalis, right here, was something like a treasure for a potion maker, and Skeeter was simply offering it to Draco. Yes, it was clearly a ploy to get him to attempt to become an Animagus… but would it really be so bad to take this? Making the potion wouldn’t make him an Animagus, after all, there was more to it than that… And it would be a marvelous test of his potion capabilities…
“Or when Becky Barron invited everyone else to her birthday party last year except me because I was ‘weird,’ and you said they ‘all deserved a hex to the face’?”
“You do like using big words,” Harry adds, looking far too pleased for this situation, and Draco shoots him a glare before scoffing and sticking his nose in the air.
“What the hell, Crabbe?!” Weasley yells, apparently also having spotted Crabbe’s guilty movements, and the rest of Gryffindor is quick to single him out, too. The giant of a boy keeps his eyes off to one side and Draco lands a few paces to the side, silently watching.
“He’s is loud and obnoxious, for one,” she begins, but it seems Harry has finally gotten close enough for Ron, and a few of the other Weasley’s, to notice him and the youngest redhead is jumping up.
Sitting in the middle of it all is a massive desk, equally covered in piles of papers, and a man with a monocle, ink-stained fingers, and black hair so long it pools on the floor around him, sits behind it. He’s mumbling to himself as he works, fingers skimming over papers at subdued speeds before he writes something down in a notebook, stamps the papers with one of seven stamps, then taps it with his wand and it flies off to its own file somewhere in the cabinets.
The man stood and approached the closet, despite his son’s fearful warnings, and when he opened the door he gave a start. Draco could not see what his father had seen, but he could hear the man just fine.
“You certainly have the hair for it,” Draco drawls and Hermione smacks his arm, an affronted look on her face. Draco decides not to tell her about the boy he had met at Madam Malkin’s response to Gryffindor. Harry Potter hadn’t seemed to think it was the best, but maybe he was wrong.
They’d tell Dumbledore, catch Barty Crouch Jr., and call off the task. That was what was going to happen now. That was what needed to happen.
“For what? Doing something before I was even a month old? Something I sure don’t remember,” he retorts, frustration bubbling up in his gut. Sure, he was getting answers for his questions, but this… This was so much more complicated than he ever wanted his life to be.
“That isn’t why you all are avoiding the subject,” Draco snaps, eyes narrowing, because they wouldn’t all be acting this weird over just a nasty stab wound. Nor would Sirius be sectioned off, for that matter.
“Don’t praise me for breaking the rules!” Hermione squeaks, looking utterly affronted when Pansy just shrugs and continues walking, apparently having said what she wanted. She probably was going to go off and find a way to weave a story out of this, Draco suspects, eying her back as she disappears towards the dungeons.
“Luna!” Tracey’s voice calls out as the invisibility cloak is pulled up enough to show everyone piled underneath. Weasley has been moved to drape over Blaise’s back, who looks especially displeased about it, and Tracey, with a blank face, waves at Luna frantically.
“Potter,” Draco says sharply, in warning, and Potter’s furious eyes snap up from the floor to glare at Draco instead. “We need to talk about two very important things. One: In the eyes of the Ministry, and thus Umbridge, we are not friends. We will need to be careful about when we are seen together, where, and how. Understand?”
“Okay, but you said ‘at first.’ Not anymore. Isn’t that the same as Finnigan? What, do I not get any special treatment because I’m a snake?” Blaise fires back and Draco and Harry turn away from the bickering match to look back at the article. Poor Hermione has nothing to distract herself with.
“Hey, Draco? Do you think I’m weird?” Max’s voice filters through the radio, sounding quieter than usual.
“Neither of us are Beaters, you do know!” Draco calls, scowling, but Harry is laughing and flying back out, swinging at the Bludger-Acting ball. Draco, sighing desperately, flies out as well.
The Slytherin team’s laughter builds up for only two seconds before Potter and Fred are lunging for Montague. There’s a chorus of outcries as each team begins cheering or demanding the other backs off. George hurries to try and pull his brother and Potter back, but to little avail.
“Yeah, sure, let’s just invent some new spells on the fly. No big deal,” Eve snarls, out of breath from trying so hard. She and Granger both look a mess, both always so frustrated when their spells don’t work, and Draco takes a careful step away from them both.
Draco glances at him, then looks back over the common room. Everyone is smiling or laughing or dancing or singing. Even Theodore has been dragged onto the “dancefloor” where an older student, probably a half-blood, attempts to teach him how to do the Monster Mash dance. The room is filled with life and excitement and Draco feels himself smile warmly.
No more is said, however, and Draco ends up just steaming in his frustration. They watch Professor Lupin and then Professor Snape each slip into the hidden tunnel, but that is about the only exciting thing to happen for a long while. The sun has set by the time Draco deems to speak again.
“I dunno… Just something that isn’t Muggle, I suppose,” he tries to clarify, scuffing his feet and ducking his head. Maybe a more dejected look would win him some points?
“You like him, then?” Draco observes, less of a question save for curtesy’s sake, and Max immediately begins to splutter.
“Can you be certain of this?” Snape questions, eyes narrowed but his wand already pulled out as if to act.
“Yeah, Evangeline, you broke my heart,” Draco smirks, enjoying the tables turning as Eve slowly turns a blue glare on him. Although, as fun as this was, it was nice to see Eve’s mother hadn’t disowned her daughter like she’d feared. Draco hadn’t even known Eve had finally come out to her mother.
“That’s TOTALLY it! You think they’re trying to overthrow you when I’m pretty sure all they want to do is survive! And you’re scared because you know all these jobs your dad has, he only has because of money!”
“Yes sir! It’s supposed to, when attached, make a broom turn waaaaaay sharper than usual without losing any speed,” Vivian replies, looking pleased, her green eyes crinkling into slits when she grins. “I wanna build stuff for flying when I get out of here. Stuff for brooms, definitely, but also new forms of travel? It’s super complex, and I wanna mix Muggle tech into it since it is so much more advanced.”
Draco scoffs and rolls his eyes at that. “Probably a big lie, then. She just likes spreading garbage and seeing what sticks,” he says with his nose up, a false sense of bravado about himself. Maybe if he faked it enough he could believe it as well?
Max thankfully accepted that Draco simply had strict parents. Max had accepted a lot of Draco’s explanations over the years, and this was one of the tamer ones.
“Excuse you!” Draco says, voice cracking in his affronted anger, and it sets the Gryffindors off, Potter and Weasley laughing outright while Granger looks away to giggle. In retaliation Draco scoops out a handful of jellybeans and chucks them across the room at them.
“Thestrals?!” Parvati Patil exclaims, standing with Lavender Brown, both of them looking like they’ve suddenly found themselves in a horror story. “Those things are meant to bring all kinds of misfortunes to—”
He’s dragged onto Harry’s bed by the boy, both unwilling to detangle themselves, but finally facing the rest of the room.
Certainly, there are still stresses later in the day, but not anything like Draco would have expected.
He keeps an eye out for Hermione through the meal, but she doesn’t appear. Later, after classes, Draco still can’t find her. Greg tells him she apparently holed herself up in the girls’ bathroom and Draco is tempted to ask Sophie, Daphne, or Vivian to go in and fetch her, he’s that worried. Harry convinces him otherwise, though, and they eventually head to the Great Hall for the Halloween Feast. They’re in a sedated mood, but the vibrant decorations and warm atmosphere help thaw some of it away.
Draco silences him by grabbing the collar of his grey t-shirt and pulling down low enough to show the top half of his lightning scar, silver eyes thinned. Now it’s the other boy’s turn to blanch, eyes bugging out then looking back at Draco in shock. Oh, now that was a funny expression. Draco doesn’t mind smirking as the other boy begins to stammer.
They’d awkwardly exchanged names - hers was Eve Hushburn - shaken hands, then sat in silence to read until they reached Hogwarts.
Not to say that Draco’s own mother wasn’t loving. She was the most powerful, most amazing woman Draco knew. Sometimes, however, she could be cold, or even be the source of Draco’s distress. Never on purpose, but it happened nonetheless.
“Toads are… fine,” McGonagall says at length when Draco falls silent. “I am much more partial to a cat myself, and owls are quite useful when needed.” Right, they used owls for their mail, didn’t they? That certainly would be helpful. Plus, he didn’t want a toad, and a cat could be detrimental to the garden and his snake friends. So could an owl though, if he wasn’t careful…
he couldn’t control, and he needed that remaining sense of control when dealing with these moments, even if it was fake.
Somehow that manages to startle a chuckle out of the man and he gives Draco a wry smirk. “That’s the worst part, I suppose. Werewolf fleas are particularly persistent,” he jokes. At least, Draco thinks he’s joking.
“Good thing he’s part of the Order, then, right?” Weasley offers in his own way of reassurance, but Draco gives him a bland look.
Then, Tracey’s head is ducking down and she’s giving the brain a look that, while unchanged, feels sadder than before. “This brain has Muggle thoughts…” she whispers as Harry is throwing his cloak properly around himself and Weasley again.
Finnigan and Thomas eventually leave, heading off after surely enjoying watching their Golden Trio torment Draco, and it looks like it is about time for Draco to continue his exploration. Except Granger, Weasley, and Potter aren’t leaving, and instead Potter is giving him a thoughtful look.
“He probably needs to stay all ‘conscious of the public eye,’ or something,” Weasley says, looking far more relaxed now that they’re not talking about Slytherins and their inherent worth.
Astronomy was held at midnight in the Astronomy Tower every Wednesday and was, to Draco’s knowledge, the only class that taught all four houses at once. It made sense, since all the other days were probably for all the other years, and the tower was large enough, but it still felt like it had to be quite the undertaking for their teacher. Thus far all of Slytherin, Gryffindor, and Ravenclaw were already there and they were just waiting for Hufflepuff and Professor Sinistra.
“Put that over your shoulders,” she orders, then throws her head back so she can gobble down the last of her Jelly Slug.
“Yeah, Longbottom,” he grunts, looking away before he can become too sentimental, “We can try tomorrow.”
“Who is he again?” the Muggle had asked during one of Draco’s imaginative stories. He had been thinking about a scenario in which he and Harry Potter went off to fight dragons together.
“Can you blame them? We’ve been dreadful to them!” Weasley leans around Draco to look at the Slytherin muggleborn. “Stealing land, treating them as lesser creatures, hunting some of them…”
“I am here to surprise my father,” Draco replies evenly, his head held high and he blinks down at the official in disdain. “I already know where his office is, so don’t bother.”
Granger returns to her seat on Potter’s right, her hands fidgeting in her lap, while Weasley and Potter look tense. No one is looking at Draco, which would be fine if it weren’t for the tense atmosphere permeating from them all.
“Conquering your fears will, hopefully, assist in your Patronus lessons,” Draco explains, “And Eric always understood you when you spoke of fears you knew, logically, were unnecessary. I suspect he will be able to shed some light on your predicament.”
Finally, Draco gets to the display that really stops him dead. It’s a single plaque next to a series of very thick books chained to a table. The plaque makes that pit in Draco’s stomach start turning in coiling spirals.
The uptick in Draco’s hysterical laughter, plus Potter’s silence, is enough to tip Max off that they may have fucked up. “You wear round glasses, don’t you…?” they mumble over the radio and Potter groans, slouching forward where he sits.
With the discovery of the Room of Requirement, so too was a discovery for a safe space. Out in the halls they were back to being enemies, and while there were still a few hiding spots around the castle, nothing was quite as secure as the Come and Go Room.
“A marvelous first step in magic development,” Flitwick says, applauding Draco and making him blush again. He then turns to the page on Lumos and pulls out his own wand. Draco mimics him a second later. “Now, this one already exists, and I can show you it,” Flitwick says, handing Draco back his notebook on the page that reads “Colorful Lumos?”
He doesn’t expect to get knocked over, but a hand on his arm is yanking him off the ground non-too-gently. The Golden Trio has arrived, Granger behind, Weasley nearly hurling Draco onto his feet, and Potter retrieving his dropped wand from the mud.
And then, right before Harry is about to call the meeting to a close, the entire room erupts into gasps, followed quickly by excited cries and cheers.
Except the underside of his bed is clean. The one thing he’d ever ordered the house elves not to do, and they’d done it anyway! It was gone. His radio was gone. His “sat-e-lite,” two-way radio that had apparently cost Max’s father so much money… was gone. Just like that.
“Don’t I have to be a certain age for piercings, though?” Potter questions, looking frightened by the two Slytherins ganging up on him.
Draco stops, feet freezing, and turns his head downward. He should have noticed earlier. Should have accepted what he noticed earlier. But here he was now, trying to
When Potions is finally let out Seamus manages to blow up a second potion before finally bottling… something. Neville returns, looking much better if horribly embarrassed, and doesn’t manage to finish his Cure for Boils, but also doesn’t have any more accidents. Vincent and Greg do nearly the exact same thing as each other but end up with two vials of entirely different colored concoctions.
They interview Agi for some time, Eve translating for everyone, while Draco sits off to the side and watches. He wasn’t very close with the merpeople, but a few Slytherins had found them to be spectacular company when they decided to drop by. Some were as harsh and vicious as the horror stories said, while others, like Agi, didn’t see much point in fighting with a bunch of children who only wanted to get to know them.
Draco turns his attention back to the hippogriffs when it appears Potter has no intention of replying nor leaving. For a while they are completely silent, just sitting in the grass, and Draco eventually raises his camera to take a few pictures of the winged beasts across the grass.
Draco remembers Firenze. They’d met once, in Draco’s first year, when the centaur had arrived to rescue Draco and Potter in the Forbidden Forest. It was a short meeting, if it could even be called that, but Draco remembers him. He also remembers the terror and confusion as he rode on the centaur’s back, clinging to Potter and just wishing the night could be over already.
Draco, accustomed to this after the end of fourth year, curls his tail around the other boy and gets comfortable, relaxing as he plays the part of the comfort stuffed animal, and purrs as loud as he can.
“What are you doing, Wilcom?” Draco questions, trying to get a better look at his housemate’s project. She was always tinkering with something or mumbling about inventions and experiments.
“I suppose it is an… ill-advised course of action,” Draco concedes, now more worried than anything, but Max is hardly over.
When Draco dislocates his arm in third year he doesn’t expect Max to become so frantic. He’s never injured himself to this degree before, only the occasional bump and bruise from his Quidditch practice, and he’s never had to consider all the things one must do while recovering.
“Let me make something clear, then,” Eve says, leaning forward, and Draco feels Potter shift his head to look up at her. “If anyone comes after you again, you will have my wand and my fury at your side. End of story.” And then she had turned and marched right out of the hospital wing.
“Getting Dumbledore’s fiery chicken to peck out the dragon’s eyes is probably not allowed, then,” Draco sighs, the abraxan figurine now trotting along his shoulders.
“You can drop the tough guy act with us, you know,” Finnigan says, smirking, and Draco turns an icy glare on him.
Swallowing down the lump in his throat, Draco turns back to the page he’d stopped on, staring at the words in vacant consideration.
“Something wrong, Malfoy?” Draco looks to his right, where the voice came from, and sees Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil standing beside him. “Is your camera not working?” Brown questions, leaning forwards to take a look at the offending device.
An older boy Draco doesn’t know who has plopped down beside the twins begins to snicker, wheezing out, “That’s a great image, though. Just a baby fighting off the darkest wizard of our time.” The twins also begin to laugh, apparently friends with the boy.
The remnants of Potter’s episode soon fall away, and he falls sideways into his bed, laying there and dragging his fingers through the fur on Draco’s back, only managing in getting Draco to purr louder and melt into the touch.
you… but I don’t think you’re a bad person. I think your personality is crap, but not your morals… probably.”
“She thinks we’d be a threat,” Potter says in realization, eyes widening in shock, before his face is twisting in fury. “That hag!”
“I realized how foolish I was being…” he says with false humility. He had to act the way his father expected him to act. He had to be the perfect, pureblood son. He couldn’t mess this up or all of this would be for nothing. “I did not wish to bother you with any of it. It was my responsibility to mend any damage my actions might have had on our family name and my own reputation.”
The debate lasts the rest of the afternoon, mostly because Granger can’t give up a point and Draco enjoys riling her up too much. Weasley and Potter mostly just sit and watch on the sidelines - eating Draco’s candy, the vultures - and only offer an occasional comment that sends Granger off again.
“Nope!” Terry calls brightly from up at the counter, apparently having heard their conversation. “That’s tattoos and body piercings! You could drop by Claire’s Accessories if you really wanted to get your ears pierced.”
“Maybe,” Draco agrees, finally coming to a stop right behind the Gryffindor. His hands find their way to tense shoulders, squeezing slightly, before sliding up and pressing at Harry’s neck. The boy was just one, big, living knot and Draco doubted he could easily ease all of it.
The book club had quickly morphed into a study group, Draco, Eve, and Hermione going over texts and notes constantly. It was nice, having Eve there. While it didn’t take away the stress, she could at least give them a breakdown of how the exams were structured, allowing for them to pinpoint more specific subjects to study.
“Good place to start, yes sir, yes sir,” the redhead nods, rolling her device back and forth in her hands. “You already got part of the spell developed so the rest should be easier. It’s also real important to change up the way you approach things. With inventin’ anything you’re gonna run into… SO MANY roadblocks, and usually you have to completely change your frame of mind to get past it.”
“He doesn’t seem the type to take being cooped up with much grace,” Draco muses, remembering how much Sirius had said he hated his family home, but was only there to appease the Ministry and give Harry a place to come and be safe.
The only time they got any reprieve was in the midst of classes, when they were by themselves, or, surprisingly, while in their dorm room. Theodore was still obnoxious, but for the most part he kept his distance from Draco and Harry while they were in their dorm. It certainly helped he still didn’t like Muddy and a small threat of putting her in his bed again usually got him to lay off for a bit.
“Even your father and I,” Narcissa gives a single nod, “Now tell me. What has brought on these questions? What has frightened you?”
“Oh, well… Uh,” Crabbe startles, fidgeting, then looks to Goyle for help. Goyle seems even less inclined to talk, but he gives it a try, anyway.
“I wasn’t running away. I’ve been here the whole time,” he retorts, not getting off the ground just to be petulant. Ada gives a single shoulder shrug.
“Did Weasley really say that?” Pansy is asking from her place on her bed and Eve comes over to Draco.
He takes a few, careful steps towards the office, expression suspicious, and fingers slowly moving towards his wand…
Draco snorts and pulls the radio towards him to look at it, not wanting to look at Potter as he speaks. “When I was six I wandered away from my parents and ended up at a museum in Muggle London. I… I met a family there. A Muggle family. Their youngest, Max, is our age and we…”
“Has girl talk begun?” Draco questions, crossing his arms and leaning against the doorframe. Eve smirks at him and Granger must hear his voice because she looks over.
Umbridge pauses to look down on the fallen boy, then glances over at Ginny. “This will certainly be a Weasley-free school, soon. No respectable witch or wizard will accept you into proper society now,” she pauses to snort, clearly entertained with herself, “Of course, they already shouldn’t have with filthy blood-traitors like yourself.”
Getting to work with Harry again, when he isn’t having to play teacher, is a nice change for the evening. The twins give Harry flack for stealing their partner, because that’s the kind of people they are, but Harry just rolls his eyes and hooks his arm with Draco’s.
“Aw, it’s okay Muddy, I forgive you,” Daphne coo’s and Draco gratefully dumps the snake into his classmate’s waiting hands to be properly spoiled. He hears no further protests.
“Not struggling!” Weasley snaps over at them, continuing to struggle as he waves around his wand like a madman.
“How do you plan to do this, Malfoy?” George asks, also leaning in. Both twins have wicked smirks on their faces that has Draco feeling inexplicably nervous. He forces himself to remain cool.
As the conversation veers into talk of different wizarding schools and their merits Draco turns away to watch Sinistra, but she doesn’t look at him again. Instead she has begun talking to another teacher, expression blank and unchanging even when the other teacher begins to laugh.
Draco feels himself flush, but he doesn’t look away. He doesn’t want to miss a moment of this. ‘What is your name?’ he questions when the merman just floats there, silently watching him, and the aquatic beast smiles a little more playfully.
“I was out after dark,” Draco shrugs. “It was a punishment. I am sure he would have turned me back, but I ran away before that could happen.”
“He has bird care books EVERYWHERE! And he keeps fighting with Papa about making everything ‘bird accessible,’ because apparently he is going to keep
“It just… made sense to me, after we saw how the prophecy records acted in the Locked Room,” Harry mumbles, trying to downplay his own intellect, and Draco nudges his shoulder with his right.
?” he demands, Draco’s family name sounding like venom on his tongue. Immediately Draco jumps back on the defensive, eyes narrowing at the other boy.
Draco actually doesn’t know why, because Max hadn’t known why. They’d just told Draco that black cats were considered unlucky and that they thought it was all bologna and all cats were “super cute.”
“Skeeter is an unregistered Animagus, like you once were,” he says slowly, like he’s teaching a particularly difficult student. “She is also helping us today, so please behave. And don’t tell Potter. He wouldn’t react well.”
Except when Draco stands and pushes at the door, the magically induced lock keeps it from opening fully. It budges a little, wood scraping against stone on the side where the hinges had been detached, but doesn’t fall away.
It took no one any time at all to translate it all into “I hate this,” “I hate that,” “I hate that I’m not getting my way.”
“Well…” begins the first twin, “it’s not like any of the others try and speak up against it, either.”
“Not that, you dolt!” he near screams and Longbottom’s eyes widen. “The radio! Don’t… you can’t tell anyone. No one can know! They’ll take it away and I’ll have
“She only had one of those blood quills, so we all had to take turns writing our lines while everyone else kept going with normal ink,” Finnigan snarls, glaring down at his own hand. “Made us take all day.”
“They say good luck and, I quote, ‘don’t break a leg, that is an awful way to say well wishes, who came up with that, we should break THEIR leg and see how they like it’.”
Draco’s brows furrow and he lowers the paper some, glancing over the top. “Hey, Harry,” he says, silencing the conversation abruptly, and all three look towards him. “Your birthday is the 31st, right? Of July?”
Draco hesitates, his eyes falling to his satchel beside him. Sitting within are his textbooks, quills, ink,
“Malfoy’s right, though. I do have to head to the pitch. The sun’s nearly completely set here,” Potter sighs, shifting away and beginning to pull all his books and papers together. Draco watches, quietly intrigued every time the other boy carefully and efficiently makes sure everything is organized. He’d expected Potter to be a slob, but it turned out he was actually quite the clean freak when it came to his things, taking careful care of everything and making sure it had a place.
“I wouldn’t mind being an animal,” Potter says, sounding a little dreamy. “Anything, really, I don’t think I’d care.”
Bellatrix’s roar of anger follows after them, though, followed by the sparks of some kind of spell and then the pained shrieks of the Death Eater who had been with her. “Get back here! I will not stand for this!” Bellatrix screams just as a spell bolt flies past Draco’s side and shatters a massive, glass tube full of brains.
Draco forced Hermione to study with him using charts and sketches he’d made for some of the subjects. He was, by no means, an artist, but he could show basic subjects in quick doodles on his paper that could then be charmed to move, if necessary.
“Very vell…” Krum finally says, inclining his head slightly towards both boys. “I vill give you peace. But…” Krum raises a hand to point a very meaningful finger at Draco, his eyes intense as he says, “You vill come to me if you need my help. Ve are not enemies.”
When Draco gets to the heavy, metal door to the Records Department the pin at his chest begins to faintly glow. Glowing, golden lines begin to draw themselves onto the door right beside the handle, forming a geometric octagon, before fading away and the click of a lock can be heard.
Weasley immediately turns red and takes a step towards him, but Potter grabs his arm before he can go any further. The Boy-Who-Lived is still glaring at Draco, though. “What the hell, Malfoy?!” he snaps, clearly angry at his friend’s behest.
“My mother?!” Draco questions, baffled. Oh no… did his mother know about the radio? This wouldn’t do at all. Draco would be in so much trouble if she knew, and…
“Yes, it is quite… cool,” McGonagall looks down and offers a smile to Draco, and he grins back. “If you like I can recommend other books that will be helpful in my classes.”
“Oh, sorry,” Max says with a nervous laugh and, abruptly, the giddiness is gone. “I’m just… I don’t know how to handle it!”
“I’m sure being the opposite of the Patronus did it no favors, either,” Potter mumbles, still looking uncertain.
“Because she was being annoying,” Pansy shrugs, too relaxed for Draco’s liking. “She’s always being annoying. Everyone thinks it. Well.. everyone but you,” now she’s smirking and she flicks her short, black hair. “Have a thing for that frizzy headed know-it-all?”
“It’s not that!” Granger huffs, crossing her arms. “It just seems to have come out of nowhere and I would like to make sure nothing uncouth has taken place.”
“They are the most suspicious individuals at this point,” Draco replies, also keeping his voice down.
Draco and the rest of the students shriek in alarm as a brightly colored explosion is let off right in front of them. They scramble around, surprised and terrified, only for another explosion to go off. They look like fireworks, actually. Sound like them too…
The taller boy’s eyes widen, his footsteps becoming more mechanical as he keeps moving forward, unwilling to allow himself to stop, but quickly feeling the panic take over. The panic that always takes hold when talking to anyone but Dobby, Tana, and now Potter about his radio. That illogical paranoia of “they know they know they know” and “they’ll take it away they’ll take it away.”
They both go down in a tangle of long limbs and Draco lashes out on instinct before he’s getting away and springing back up. His cloak has fallen off in the process, laying on the floor like a cascade of silvery water, and he lurches forward to grab it back up.
“I’ll explain it later,” Draco says briskly then narrows his eyes at the red-haired girl. “Where, exactly, do you propose we hide, then?”
He’d clung to snow leopard Draco for nearly an hour up in the Astronomy Tower the following evening, not saying a word, and Draco had to keep reminding himself that this was for the best.
,” he says firmly, tapping the lock, and he hears a click from within as it unlocks under his magic.
“But… but what happened?” Draco questions, his heart picking up in worry. He had no clue what Harry might have done after Draco had passed out, but surely it couldn’t have been good? The boy had been broken, frantically struggling to save his godfather - he hadn’t been in his right mind for a while - that there was no telling what he might have done before someone got to him.
Max’s mother hums, a distant noise that doesn’t seem like she’s even aware she’s done it, before she speaks patiently, “Sometimes you can’t. More of that confusing stuff, you see. Some people need a distraction, while others must face it. Some people need to cry, or scream, or laugh. Some people need to be alone, but others need people surrounding them.”
“If you know it’s just a bone, why dig it up, then?” Eve questions as they get to the fence surrounding the garden in question. Being the middle of the day Hagrid and Fang should be out somewhere else, but that doesn’t mean they can take their time.
“You are allowed to be angry,” Draco assures him, not removing his hands from Harry’s wrist or his cheek. “You are allowed to be furious. Just… don’t obsess over this. Please… You have too much to worry about already.”
“You’re gonna hate it!” Draco calls to his housemates, who shoot him unimpressed glares, but he sees Granger nodding along in agreement.
“Let me guess. The Order is staying quiet?” Draco had asked, certain no one could hear him. They’d begun layering silencing charms and disillusionment charms around their table. Their friendship needed to remain unnoticed by Umbridge, after all. They were certain none of the Gryffindors would ever rat them out, Slytherins didn’t betray their own, usually, and Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws likely didn’t notice nor care, so they mainly needed to remain hidden while out in public.
It's been a while hasn't it, y'all??? Well, to say I'm sorry, how about we wrap up year five with the LONGEST CHAPTER YET OH SWEET BABY JESUS
“Clean up your damn mess!” Blaise calls after him, pointing at the dripped toothpaste on the dorm’s floor, and Draco finally moves further into the room to retrieve his sleep clothes. To the right of his bed is Goyle’s, where the large boy and Crabbe both sit with parchment and books spread around them. They are clearly attempting to finish last-minute summer work.
“She’s no headmaster,” Harry spits, vicious and sudden, and Draco twists to look down at him. They’re side-by-side, legs tangled together, and bodies twisted so they can still hold onto each other.
Draco, in a spur of the moment he will later blame on his excitement and giddiness, lurches forward to hug his Astronomy teacher. The woman goes still, clearly not expecting this level of gratitude, but Draco hardly notices. He squeezes her tight, then releases her, turns, and starts moving down the corridor.
“Yes, that is what I just said,” the blonde says, brow arched, unimpressed but very much amused. He may not have liked the swarm of people at the Leaky Cauldron, but this? With such a small crowd? He could get behind.
“Now that I have your attention,” the serious woman begins, pulling out her wand and flicking it at the chalkboard so it begins to write on itself. “Shall we begin?”
It had put Draco at ease, not caring about the stares being thrown their way, and he could feel Harry relaxing against his side.
When he went into the forest, he also used the opportunity to transform and stalk through the trees, testing his heightened senses and getting some animalistic energy out of his system. Such energy tended to build, Draco noticed, when he was particularly angry or excited.
They’d headed up to the top box, running into the Weasley’s and the Golden Trio all over again, the Minister seemingly blind to the tension that springs into the room. Fudge does, however, keep side-eying Sirius, especially when the ex-convict steps up to Narcissa and kisses the top of her hand.
As Granger continues to speak to Weasley, attempting to calm him down, Draco hears Harry say under his breath, “Maybe I just need more sleep…”
“It is a versatile opportunity,” Narcissa had cooly replied, Bellatrix clearly not caring about the lack of emotional glee in her sister’s response.
“Offer?” Draco squeaks. He still felt horribly panicky, but this meeting was not going at all like he had expected.
Draco glances over at the other boy. He looks tired from their early morning, his eyelids drooping, but he’s looking intently at the book in Draco’s lap with confusion. “How would you know? You hardly even look in ours.”
“You think you’ll have a badass scar, now?” Max wonders, very quickly jumping ship to the positive side of things.
Really, Draco had just not wanted to leave Harry’s side and Harry hadn’t wanted to leave his, and they were just
It isn’t until later that he finds out the reason for the argument was because the Slytherin Beater had called Granger a mudblood.
“Draco’s father has graciously offered to sponsor our team,” Flint is saying and the whole Slytherin team lifts their new Nimbus 2001’s, showing off the sleek brooms, knowing it will get a rise out of their rivals.
Draco blinks owlishly before his face turns pink and he scrambles to muss up the slicked back, blonde locks. He feels ruffled and surprised as he finally says, “Harry Potter?”
“Just go easy on the poor guy, okay?” Max pleads over the radio as Draco paces across the grounds. He’s near Hagrid’s hut, hidden away from prying eyes, especially with the Gameskeeper currently absent, and Draco is positively furious.
“Oh… well…” Draco pauses, swallows, then lets out a long breath. “I’ll… see what I can do about visiting. I planned to head home for the holidays, spend time with mother. Plus, father has floo powder that can lead him straight to the Ministry I was hoping to use.”
So, he was surrounded by weirdos on all sides, but he was getting better at dealing with them and appreciating their moments of clarity. They were a break from the true insanity that now surrounded Hogwarts, and Draco would take what he could get.
“Well, I’m off the clock, and leather jackets are good protection while riding motorcycles,” Duke explains and Draco looks up at him sharply.
“Mr. Potter. Mr. Malfoy,” she says coolly and both boys jump, swiveling around in their seats and staring up at their teacher with wide, panicked eyes. Immediately Draco feels his nerves return, crushing his insides and making it hard to find his voice. “Join me in my office,” Sinistra orders and then turns away.
No ingredients get thrown, much to Draco’s relief, and when he glances over on multiple occasions the two girls are tensely, but silently, working together to get their joint potion finished.
He’s out in the halls before he knows it, walking along swiftly, and trying to work out the energy that is suddenly coursing through him. He spies the twins and Lee talking lowly in a nearby alcove and decides that’s as good a distraction as any.
“Ron didn’t need to tell us,” the other says, holding Harry’s shoulder, “But it was a pretty brilliant move. Don’t you think, Fred?”
Millicent wasn’t present, thankfully. She was the only girl in their year that Draco didn’t trust at all. Pansy, despite not being a part of the DA, knew plenty about it and they knew she wouldn’t rat them out.
Draco looks at Harry for a long moment then glances back at Blaise and Theodore. Blaise shrugs, nonchalant, and Theodore doesn’t look happy, but he eventually grumbles, “Fine,” before snatching his pajamas and storming off to the bathroom. “But keep that snake away from me!”
Potter stiffens, like he’s suddenly very frightened by what Draco has asked, and he still isn’t looking at the blonde. Feeling bold, Draco’s loose fingers shift to instead hold and squeeze Potter’s hand, running his thumb over the knuckles.
The latter one would have been a lot sweeter if she hadn’t popped up by his bedside while he was trying to sleep…
Eve’s mother makes her way over to her door, unlocks the handle and chain, then swings it open. “We do not want any!” she announces without waiting for the person to introduce themselves.
Still, the most shocking exchange of all, had been when Crabbe and Goyle of all people had approached the Golden Trio. Draco had watched at a distance at the time, unable to hear them, but he’d seen the shocked faces on the trio as the pair of giant wizards spoke, handed something over, then walked away.
“We overheard Madam Pomfrey speaking to some of the Order members earlier,” Luna explains. “He’s not reacting the way he should be to magical stimuli. He’s alive, but… He isn’t waking up.”
“I call it the Tail-Growing Hex,” Tracey says slowly, vacant eyes not a good combination with a giant, deadly, venomous weapon. “I know other tails, too.”
He’d arrived at the Auror offices and walked confidently up to Duke’s cubicle, familiar with the layout even after a few months away. The massive Auror had been surprised but happy to see him, despite not smiling, allowing him to take a seat as he went off to fetch some reports for him to proofread.
“That’s certainly helpful,” Granger hums, examining the pin in clear curiosity. “I suspect you found something in the Records Department, then?”
There’s a sudden disturbance, Weasley throwing himself around to try and dislodge Verteaux, but the girl is vicious and a sharp twist and thrust of her foot has the ginger swept and slammed into the ground. She snickers, pleased with her rough treatment, as Warrington says, “What do you even think you’re doing, weasel? You’re all already caught!”
Blaise, the only one Draco thought he could trust in this dorm, lazily waves at Theodore. “It’s a thing now.”
“That was terrifying,” Pansy sighs, falling backwards and sitting on the ground, her short, straight hair a mess from sweat and stress. “What happened?”
Luna, if possible, brightens even further as she hurries forward to give Tracey a hug. “Oh, very pleasant sight indeed,” Luna says, and she’d likely hug all of them if Eve hadn’t set a hand on her shoulder.
Draco cannot see his mother’s expression where he’s lowered his head, but he feels her fingers pause in his hair. “Darling…” she begins quietly, pauses, then takes a quiet breath. “We are all human, but Muggles live in a world bereft of magic. They cannot understand its beauty and complexity. They cannot offer it the respect it deserves.”
“Excuse you,” he snaps, deciding to glare at Potter since he’s their leader, “but we finally got rid of Crabbe and Goyle. We do not require any more bumbling buffoons.”
The smile on the woman’s face vanishes and Draco shrinks back from the fierce expression. He had absolutely no idea who this woman was, but he knew he should not get on her bad side. “While I cannot speak for the nature of any Muggle diseases,” Draco had no idea what a Muggle was, “The Hogwarts I speak of is a school. A school for Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
,” and the ball glows gold, lifts up, then flies away. Harry is immediately after it, grinning so broad Draco can see it from afar.
“Can you blame him?” Draco arches a brow and crosses his arms, looking at Sirius before facing Potter again. The air around them shifts with his tone, all their expressions turning serious. “This is the last chance anyone has of going through with their plans. We need to be careful…”
His radio is in his hands before he knows it and he goes through the usual greetings automatically, voice thick, until he’s speaking to who he needs.
Harry Potter blinks at the trio in surprise. He’s surrounded by an absurd amount of sweets, making a right mess of the place, and sitting on the bench across from him is a boy about their age with a shock of bright, red hair and freckles. The redhead doesn’t look particularly happy, telling Hermione that they had already talked to the boy with the missing toad earlier. It immediately made Hermione puff out her chest and straighten her shoulders.
Harry and Weasley, on the other hand, were terrified of them. Apparently they did not see the intricate organization they had managed to pull off and, instead, just saw agony and suffering. At least, that’s what Harry had told them.
That sets Draco off all anew and Max’s mother doesn’t hush him, just lets him cry. She hums some lullaby she’s used for her own children before and Draco ends up falling asleep in his tub, letting his Muggle family cover him in kindness and warmth from a single, satellite radio.
Leaping to the ground Draco shifts back into a human, shaking himself out and wiggling his nose. The shift back was still disconcerting, but he had been right; it was getting easier and easier the more he practiced. Still, with only three days under his belt as an Animagus, he figures he was doing pretty well.
“Seriously?” the twin on the far side of the group from Draco says, arching a brow and smirking. “Do you hear this, Fred?”
Then he’s looking at Sirius and glares, clearly unhappy, and Sirius’s apologetical smile grows more desperate. “Surprise…?”
“Because I’m jealous. Super jealous. Just… sooooooo jealous!” Max groans. They sound muffled and Draco guesses they must be in bed and moping. It wouldn’t be the first time.
Draco’s face turns pink and his eyes only widen, now with a touch of horror. “I-I’m not sweet!” he yelps in indignation then shoots a glare past Lily when he sees not just Harry but Blaise, too, holding back snickers.
They sweep into the dancefloor with ease, dancing and spinning with the crowd, making a point of doing a few unnecessary dips and twirls when they’re sure too many people are watching. May as well give them a show, they figure.
“These kinds of things are… delicate,” Max’s mother offers gently, “If you truly believe Harry needs help, then do not stay silent. But, at least, show that you are there for Harry. Show him he has support and that he, too, can reach out for help.”
“Now’s our chance!” Harry yells, urging them all to finally start moving. His Militum is impressive, but it won’t last forever.
His eyes widen in amazement, a cheer bubbling up in his throat, and he turns his head to look back at Potter to rub his victory in his face, when he realizes why the other boy had suddenly pulled back.
“No, I am attempting to remember a band name, but I think I got it wrong,” Draco replies, looking over to Potter who is staring at the radio in shock.
Harry snorts and Ron’s mouth twists doubtfully. “Mmm, nevermind, I’ve seen better,” the redhead says flatly and Hermione’s held giggles seem to get worse, her shoulders shaking terribly.
The Atrium of the Ministry looks different without anyone in it. The massive, dark room echoes with every step as Draco tumbles out of the floo, jogging up to where Tracey is waiting for him.
“Acting like a spoiled brat who doesn’t understand how the real-world works.” Draco feels his face heat up, shoulders stiffening, but before he can retort Max is continuing with a laugh, “But you’re MY spoiled brat of a friend, so no worries. I’ll help you figure it all out.”
“I’m beginning to get the feeling you didn’t want to be in this house,” Draco whispers, leaning towards Harry so only the other boy can hear. He’s met, very suddenly, by surprised, green eyes.
Draco arches a brow in confusion and behind him he hears Eve groan loudly. “Why would I be upset because it is just Chang?” he questions. Once again, Eve groans, this time louder.
“Potions first,” the messy-haired boy mumbles, voice scratchy from sleep, and Draco sits down on his own bed to look at their classes.
“With curses! I mean, you’re a weirdo, and I know you don’t share everything, but I just thought… it made sense. Right? Cause Wiccans are… magic-y and stuff? Did I say something wrong?”
“No…” Max mumbles, sounding sad and defeated. It made Draco smirk. He so rarely got the opportunity to win these encounters.
Max has a bit of a come apart for a few more minutes, Harry laughing as Draco tries to get them to calm down already. It takes a lot of convincing, but finally he’s managed to get Max to see that everything is done, now, and he just wanted them to know.
He had just wanted to complain to Max. He had just wanted to share how much of a pest he saw Potter to be, and how his social standings were sure to crumble if he continued to associate with such undesirables. He hadn’t thought…
The blond grins a bit bigger, not even trying to hide it, as he says, “I told you they’d lose them, and they did. Multiple times. Thus far it has only been myself to help find them again, however.”
“Neither have cited sources, though, even the Quibbler,” Draco says firmly. After having to listen through Max working on papers for their school, and thus all the cited sources everything seemed to have in the Muggle world, Draco had noticed a severe lack of such things here in the Wizarding World.
The Slytherin common room had been frighteningly quiet that evening, and Draco had fled to sit and read with Eve in the library.
“Yes, I was there,” Draco says, trying to sound sarcastic, but his smile is uncontrollable by this point. Mostly, he’s relieved to not been kicked out of school, but it does sound exciting, and Harry’s energy is infectious. “I hardly know anything about it, though,” he admits at length, shrugging, a broom in both hands. Hermione had lectured so much about it before their flying class that Draco had tuned her out for most of it. Now he wishes he’d listened more.
It left Draco and Weasley having to swiftly hide behind statues or pillars or inside halls to avoid detection, and it was quickly riding their patience raw.
He swiftly skims back over the file, back to the list of creatures housed in Unhideable Hall, until he finds what he’d just read. His eyes widen and he scrambles to find more files on the specific creature he’s just identified.
“Oh, nah dude, we were just bored. We each had to buy him a giant cookie since he did it, too, so now I’m down three dollars…” Max replies flippantly and Draco sighs. So much for applying logic…
He peers dubiously at the photos on the wall beside small replicas of vehicles meant to travel through space. Most are labelled as “satellites,” which Draco remembers Max’s father mentioning, but there are also “rockets” that Draco had first assumed were missiles. ‘More weapons,’ he’d immediately thought, but then became confused as he read.
He could pick up a few phrases here and there, but when Draco looked at the vinyl sleeve he couldn’t find a list of any lyrics. All he could find was that the song was titled “Smells Like Teen Spirit.”
McGonagall slips her wand away and urges Draco towards the store and they slip inside. As uncertain as the outside may have made him feel, the young wizard immediately felt a very different atmosphere within. There were shelves filled with thin boxes everywhere, a light dust coating every surface and little particles floating through the air. It didn’t look particularly special, but it felt like so much more.
“I was pretty desperate to get down here myself,” Harry chuckles wetly and Draco watches in mounting panic as the Gryffindor’s eyes grow wetter and wetter. “There was so much happening, so many people were getting hurt all because I didn’t just… stop to think. I didn’t have a plan, I relied on everyone else to come up with solutions, and they’re the ones to pay for it.”
“You have an elective where you learn how to treat exotic animals… and you have the GALL to complain?” Max demands, flabbergasted, before grumbling something like, “Stupid rich kids in stupid posh boarding schools…”
It had given Hagrid a chance to flee with Fang, but Draco had watched in horror as his Transfiguration professor was struck with stun after stun until she fell. Cries of outrage from surrounding students had erupted, but Umbridge had demanded silence and, with a squad of malicious Aurors to back her, they’d had no choice but to listen.
“He probably thinks the door’s locked,” the tallest boy whispers back, but Draco is still smacking Harry’s arm, this time more roughly. “Merlin, Malfoy, what is wrong with you?” Theodore snaps, having spotted Draco’s actions. Then the other two boys are turning around as well and stiffening.
“Please, by all that is divine and holy, stop now,” Weasley is whining from only a few feet away, looking like he wants to throw himself off the Astronomy Tower. Draco ignores him while Harry has the grace to smile apologetically.
“Yeah, I just…” for a second it looks like Potter might lose his temper, face pinching up in frustration, before he sags in defeat. “Listen, I already talked to Dumbledore about this. Can we just…
By the time the sun had properly risen, everyone was awake and doing better. Harry had almost been run out after being found in Draco’s bed asleep, but when Madam Pomfrey had seen his swollen, tear-stained face and bags under his eyes, she’d relented with just a warning.
The goblin scoffs loudly, finally putting the minecart into gear and taking off, but Draco is too enraptured in this bizarre revelation to be too startled this time. “Muggle-raised folk never understand the complexity and elegance in our system,” he snarls, not at all happy, but Draco hardly cares. He’s not happy about this either.
“You’ve got your answers, so I expect you not to fight me,” Pomfrey says down to Draco with a stern expression, holding out the potion bottle. It doesn’t take a genius to sort out it must be a Calming Draught.
“Maybe we could leave some food out for it?” Potter suggests, “Lunch should still be out, we could grab a plate of meat.”
“Someone,” Draco starts, but his voice breaks on the whisper and he has to start again. “Someone is out there, right this instant, plotting something terrible against you, and tonight, when you would most likely be out, alone, I see
“Yes,” Sinistra says firmly, having heard the whisper, and it sufficiently shuts everyone else up. “Does everyone have their telescope and books with them?” she questions and there is a murmur of affirmatives. Even Neville has remembered his, but Draco suspects that might be with the assistance of Hermione or even Greg and Vincent. “Good,” she glances out towards the sky, dark eyes reflecting the moonlight in such a way she doesn’t look entirely natural, “We will give the clouds some time to clear. For now I will go over what I expect of you, here.”
“You are,” Hermione scowls, but doesn’t begin to lecture them on those rules, which probably means she’s in shock. At least, Draco can’t think of any other reason she would suddenly stop talking about rules and house points. “But your safety is far more important.” Oh… well, there could be that.
“You are right,” Dumbledore nods, looking sad again, “You do deserve respect and I apologize if I have not shown mine properly.” In one, fluid movement the older man stands and makes his way around his desk. He sets a hand on Draco’s shoulder once he’s close enough, a reassuring pressure that only makes Draco feel worse. “I am sorry, but I cannot tell you everything you wish to know. Not right now.”
“You’d do well as an Animagus. Someone like you would probably be something small and cowardly. Plus, you wouldn’t have to depend on me.”
“I find Dumbledore’s actions peculiar, though, I’ll admit,” Draco says as he stands. Dumbledore had been hesitant, but pleased to offer Potter his temporary reprieve over the summer with Draco. It seemed odd to suddenly give the boy the cold shoulder. “We’ll talk on it later, however. We must be off.”
“You sure about that?” Theodore hums, smirking and tapping his chin with a finger as he glances up at the fliers. They were beginning to make their way down to the ground. “I’m sure it doesn’t take much to replace some half-blood twerp--”
When he finds Potter, still alone, he appears to be walking down a corridor he really has no business in. It doesn’t lead him to Gryffindor Tower, or the Astronomy Tower, or anywhere Draco can think Potter would want to be at this time. That, in itself, concerns Draco.
Draco stares in shock, before turning to look at the Greengrass sisters. They’re both a little winded from summoning their walls, but they have a stubborn, determined look in their eyes.
Mrs Nubble walks calmly away, heading out to work, and Mr Nubble sets about cleaning the table. Draco is so busy staring forlornly after the trash bag currently flung over Frederick’s shoulder he doesn’t notice Ada sliding in beside him until she’s laying a hand on his shoulder, much gentler than Mr Nubble. “Hey, don’t worry about it. Parental Unit 1 is probably right. Just some jerk trying to mooch off you or something.”
His hair is still long enough to curl along the ground and each paper he finishes stamping or writing on folds up into a paper airplane before taking off to its necessary stack.
“Krum had a copy, too, you know. Why am I getting all the flack?” Draco whines, sitting up straighter.
“I did, I’m afraid, but some sacrifices must be made for progress. You see, I am working on a grand project to better Hogwarts this year, but I required some assistance that only a Black could offer,” specifically an Animagus Black with a house all his own that wouldn’t rat Draco out to his parents, “That is why I am here.”
Then she tells them that Slytherins look after their own. Draco can’t help but glance over at Theodore and Millicent when she says that, really wondering if she’s serious. In addition, hadn’t it been Gemma who had been so focused on winning the house cup earlier because she, personally, didn’t want to lose while she was attending Hogwarts?
Draco digs a letter out of his pocket with a ticket held inside to show it to Mrs. Nubble. At some point in the middle of August an owl had flown through their window during breakfast and dropped a letter on Draco’s plate, promptly terrifying Mrs. Nubble and splattering eggs on Draco’s shirt. It was from McGonagall telling him to go to Kings Cross on the first of September, with the attached ticket, to get on the Hogwarts Express.
It made him actually queasy. He was aware that his actions were necessary, and that he’d still have power to help, but he felt like a coward. He felt like a coward when he was released from the infirmary. He felt like a coward as he went to his dorm. He felt like a coward as he went to classes and noticed the DA members missing.
When Draco had realized he was venturing further into thestral territory – he’d made a few visits with Luna and Tracey before – he’d said his good-bye’s and moved more quietly.
With a sideways glance at Potter, the blonde turns the page and looks elsewhere. It would do him no good to get the Boy-Who-Lived all riled up over possibly nothing. Draco was the one doing the investigating here, and he would handle it.
The lessons are rapid-fire, but thankfully short, and Draco isn’t expected to do any homework until the final day where McGonagall wanted him to write an essay on what they’d addressed.
“Do we get extra credit for these?” Harry manages to ask, looking hopeful, and Sinistra blinks very slowly.
By the middle of Herbology everyone Slytherin’s hair returns to normal and Professor Sprout is trying not to roll her eyes at them.
“Yes,” she says immediately then leans back forward towards her book, “Which is how I know that this simply cannot be supernatural, or magical, in nature.”
He spins around, finding Blaise and Sophie there, looking frightened but set on something. Blaise shoves Draco’s satchel at him just as another bang rattles the room and, through the cracks forming in the door, laughter filters in.
Harry sucks in a breath, rather suddenly, and Draco looks to him worriedly. The bespectacled boy waves him off before he can ask after him, but Draco still moves his hand from the small of Harry’s back to his nearest hand, interlocking their fingers and squeezing.
“Proof,” Mrs Nubble suddenly says and they all look to her. “This is a lot of information, very detailed and impressive, but I would like to see physical proof of your magic.” It’s a demand that leaves little room for argument, her tone hard and unforgiving. Draco half expects a fight with how the two women are matching each other’s stares.
” he announces clearly, and for a moment a wisp of shadow does emerge from his wand, but that’s it. No creature emerges for Draco and he sighs dejectedly, lowering his hand and wand into his lap. He hardly even cares he and his professor are still sitting on her rug.
Draco still hadn’t understood, until he’d been about nine and woken up from a nightmare where he had been flying on his broom, circling around a dictionary the size of a building, when he’d looked back and realized he was being followed by a flock of birds. They never got closer, or even made to attack him, they were just incredibly loud and kept following him everywhere. He had been terrified.
The Dark Lord descends onto the manor with a fury that rattles the windows within their frames. His mother sends him to his quarters, and demands he stay there until dawn.
He laughs at how ridiculous this all is, but the laughter dies in his throat, and instead, he begins to cry. His shoulders tremble violently as he sobs, and Pansy comes to his side, wrapping an arm around his shoulder.
But now, Draco realises, his father is nothing more than a coward and a hypocrite. The only thing he cares about is power and esteem, to boast of his wealth and blood status. If it were not for his father and his greed, they would not be hosting a bloodthirsty lunatic in their house. They would not have to live in fear under their own roof.
In his peripheral vision, Draco sees them begin to walk away, and the knot in his chest eases slightly.
With one arm holding Goyle, Draco reaches his other one up towards Harry. It slips right through Harry’s and Draco almost cries. Then, Weasely and Granger are flying towards them, taking Goyle from Draco’s arms and perching him on their broom.
Draco sits at the end of a bench pushed up against a wall and tries to read what Kingsley Shacklebolt is saying. It’s been more than an hour now, and for the last forty-five minutes, he has been talking to his parents. He doesn't even know where his friends are, and he just hopes they’re not amongst the bodies being moved.
Draco pushes his plate away, and stands up abruptly. He walks out of the hall as quick as his feet can carry him, and tries to pretend he doesn't hear Harry’s laugh echoing across the Great Hall.
“You have to do it, Granger. Please,” Draco beseeches, and finally, she looks up. She must notice the sincerity in his eyes, because she gives him a small nod, despite the reluctance.
Draco wonders what they would think if they knew the Chosen One had been romantically involved with him, the youngest Death Eater.
Draco whirls around as panic shoots through his veins, and instinctively draws his hand towards Harry and fires a hex. He doesn't realise his mistake until it’s too late and Harry fires a jinx. In his terror, his body works impulsively, firing off spells before he can even think.
Draco wonders what it is like to fly, to roam the skies, untethered by responsibilities and expectations. To swim against the clouds and let the wind carry him anywhere it pleases.
Harry looks down at the ground uncomfortably, and Draco feels that familiar shadow of dread creep upon him.
They leave, walking through the courtyard and towards the bridge. Rubble and wreckage from the destroyed parts of the castle remain scattered across the grounds, but the cold morning breeze that rushes past them, washes away the smell of smoke and fire.
Pansy is sorry for him, Draco realises, because she would never lie about something like this. No matter how unkind she may be at times, she would never do something so cruel.
When he awakes, five bodies litter the drawing-room, and blood seeps out through the gap between the door and the flooring. His parents remain alive and unharmed.
He leaves, slamming the door behind him. As he climbs the stairs, he hears the crack of Apparition, and smiles ruefully.
“I love you,” Draco whispers into Harry’s lips, pressing the words onto his skin. He needs Harry to know, he needs him to know so badly that his bones ache with desperation, because if he does not make it out of this alive, Draco will take his words with him to the grave, and he will never forgive himself. Harry needs to know that Draco loves him, will love him unconditionally and ceaselessly.
“Potter,” Draco forces himself to say instead, and bitterness coats his mouth as the name leaves Draco’s lips.
He clutches Goyle’s body tighter, and tries to blink the tears out of his eyes. The acrid smoke entering his lungs makes him feel light-headed and Draco fears he will fall to his death just as Crabbe had.
Draco falls back onto his pillow, and tries to make peace with the fact that someone that once loved him, has now placed scars all over his body.
“Where were you? I was looking everywhere,” Harry asks, like he’s conversing about the weather with a friend.
The last thing he sees is dazzling green eyes and a bright smile, before the darkness swallows him whole.
“I can’t– I can’t be sure,” he struggles out. “No. No, I don't think so,” he says, keeping his eyes trained on Harry. Harry’s head jerks upwards slightly, as though he’s trying to look at Draco, and Draco feels his heart lurch violently, certain that Harry has given himself away.
“Why?” Harry asks, and isn’t that the crux of the matter. Why did Draco sacrifice the only good thing he had left? Why did Draco risk his life to save the boy he loves?
Harry’s green eyes stare down at him with an intense flame blazing in his eyes, and Draco is left breathless. Only mere inches away from Draco, he smells of sweat and dirt and
Draco’s gaze flits across to the person beside them, and sees that Harry is grinning at girl Weasley. He feels far too hot, suddenly.
He hears the soft patter of feet on the wooden flooring, and when he blinks through his teary eyes, he sees a dark figure looming over him. Draco feels dread filling his veins, and he can do nothing but lie on the floor, limp and helpless.
Draco wonders if he ever knew his father at all. He wonders if the father that he remembers, will return and take the place of this strange man playing a faux performance of fatherhood.
“Yes Young Master Draco,” she says, nodding intensely. As he stares at her, he remembers Dobby, and the plan in his head begins to solidify.
He wraps his arms around himself, as though trying to keep the broken pieces of his heart intact, and feels the pillow beneath his cheek dampen with tears.
Draco turns away from Granger and towards the goblin as he says something. Fear begins to course through his veins as he watches Bellatrix cast aside the goblin and pull up her sleeve. She touches the dark mark, and at once, the identical one on his arm writhes under his skin, shooting bolts of pain through him. He bites down on his tongue to prevent a cry from his lips and digs his nails into his forearm.
He tells his mother that he had accidentally handed her a pair of his trousers without realising. She stares at him for a moment, suspicious, but nods, muttering something about obtaining more house-elves. He sighs in relief.
“Protect who though?” Harry continues, oblivious to Draco standing behind him only a few feet away. “I’m surprised he even cares about someone other than himself,” Harry scoffs, and Draco suddenly feels nauseous.
Snape hands him a vial of Dreamless Sleeping Potion, and stands with his hands clasped behind his back.
The noise increases tenfold as house-elves swarm the entrance hall. He sees Tinky amongst the throng of their small bodies, carrying a knife larger than herself and charging ahead. He watches with amazement as she drives the knife into the shin of a Death Eater, and he crumples under her attack. She draws back and plunges the knife into his thigh, spraying blood everywhere, and runs away before the Death Eater can retaliate, disappearing into the crowd. Draco feels oddly proud.
Draco feels a warm hand place itself on top of his own, and when he looks down, he realises his hands are clenched into fists on the table.
“Harry,” Granger starts hesitantly, turning her words over before she speaks. “I honestly don’t think Malfoy would do something like that,” she says. Weasley nods beside her.
Then, he hears the awful shrill voice of his aunt as she enters the drawing-room, and Draco feels his insides freeze over, because where Bellatrix is involved, bloodshed will always be guaranteed.
He hides his face in her shoulder, because it’s mortifying to be in this state, but the tears will not stop. They choke their way through his throat until his chest is heaving for air.
He stares unseeingly out of the windows, towards the Great Lake. He sees a flash of blue-green glinting in the water, but it disappears as soon as its come. It’s the mermaids, and Draco watches the water ripple across his window.
Harry nods, shoulders drooping slightly in acceptance. He stares at Draco for a moment, and from the slight crease between his brows, Draco knows he is turning his words over in his head.
Someone whimpers, and it’s the saddest thing Draco has ever heard. It takes several seconds for Draco to realise it’s himself whimpering, when Blaise tightens the grip on his arm and hisses in his ear to shut up. Pansy’s hand finds his, and she laces her fingers through his, squeezing tightly. They both hold onto him like an anchor, keeping him from drifting away.
Harry looks at him, and something in his eyes clears. The corners of his mouth pull up ever so slightly.
“I see you have done what I had advised you,” Snape begins, and Draco feels his stomach twist uncomfortably. “It was a wise decision, that boy was merely a ludicrous hindrance in your path,” he says, and Draco feels a flare of anger shoot through his veins.
Draco feels heat prickle at the back of his neck, and sees flames advancing towards them. Draco grabs Goyle’s arm, and begins running. Goyle is dead weight behind him, and Draco fears that they will not exit this room without being reduced to a pile of ash.
He hears his mother and father conversing behind his turned back, and sees Greyback leering disgustingly at Granger. He pushes her forward, and Draco clenches his hands into fists to prevent himself from cursing the werewolf to pieces.
There is no sign of Harry anywhere, and a tendril of fear wraps itself around Draco. Surely Harry would not be so stupid as to give himself up.
His blond hair hangs around his eyes limply, the gloss that had once glistened his hair, now lost. There are dark circles under his eyes, and his skin looks pale and clammy. He looks awful, and if his mother were to see him now, she may cry.
Draco wears the Dark Mark with faux delight in front of his father and the other Death Eaters, and they smile with glee and clap him on the back. His father squares his shoulders back with barely concealed pride, but his mother looks at him like the world has crashed down on her shoulders.
“Draco, you are no killer,” Dumbledore says, smiling kindly. Draco’s arm trembles where it holds his wand directed at the headmaster, and Draco knows he could easily overpower Draco if he wanted to.
“Yes,” Draco says, and his voice sounds distant and odd, like it doesn't belong to him, like Draco is in someone else's body. “Yes, I’m alright,” he manages hoarsely, because he doesn’t want her worrying over him. Neither does he feel like talking about this.
Harry’s hair hangs down to his shoulders, long and dark. Now that he looks closely, there’s a red bruise blooming on the side of his jaw and his lip is split, blood smeared across his chin. His face is ashen, and the dark circles under his eyes make him look haunted.
“Yes. Yes, I do not doubt that,” Snape says, his gaze fixed firmly at something behind Draco. “Draco, please close the door,” he orders, and Draco does, peeking out into the empty hallway.
Myrtle floats around him, speaking to him softly, and he cries even harder at her sympathy. He draws in a shuddering breath, and looks into the mirror again. At the very corner stands a figure behind him, a mop of black hair and wired glasses.
Draco ducks his face into his neck and breathes in a lungful of Harry. He tightens his hold, trying to meld Harry to his side.
Overhead, an opening appears, and Draco sighs in relief. His breath hits the back of Harry’s neck, and he feels Harry shiver in response. Draco squeezes him tighter.
with another girl. He thinks of the lips that have kissed him, kissing her, whispering pretty words to her. He thinks of the strong arms that have held him, holding her.
“….keep him safe. What does that mean? Keep who safe?” Harry asks, and Draco feels his heart drop to his stomach. No. It can’t be. He couldn’t be talking about Draco, surely.
Bellatrix demands something about a Gringotts vault, and the palpable fear in her eyes makes Draco feel that calling the Dark Lord will lead to the demise of every single person in this house. His father bellows Draco’s name, and demands he brings the goblin up from the cellar.
When he wakes up, the first thing he sees is the ceiling of the infirmary. His limbs ache, and there is still the faint sting of the wounds across his chest.
“Yes. Yes, of course. Carry on,” Draco sighs in relief, willing his pulse to calm. Tinky goes back to her cleaning, and Draco watches her, trying desperately to figure out a way to get into the cellars without being seen.
Harry swipes his thumb over Draco’s knuckles and over the back of his palm. When Harry draws his arm up, Draco notices the dried blood smudged across his split knuckles.
Blaise finds them like this hours later, and he has three cold bottles of Butterbeer held in his hands. He settles down on Draco’s other side, and takes in Draco’s dishevelled state. Draco’s eyes are rimmed red, and the skin around them has swollen painfully. Blaise squeezes his thigh gently, and offers to finish his essay for him.
He stands up abruptly and his chair scrapes across the floor loudly. He grabs his stuff and begins shoving them into his bag. Blotches of ink stain his hands as he hurriedly shoves the cap on his ink bottle and his quill snaps in his haste.
Draco grits his teeth, and assures Snape that he will return his mother’s letters, before walking away briskly.
As he runs, weaving through the crowd and firing spells, he hears his name being called over the noise. He thinks it sounds like his mother but he cannot be sure.
Snape turns to him, his dark eyes boring into Draco’s uncomfortably. His eyes flit past Draco’s shoulder and into the corridor, and his lips thin into a taut line.
Harry’s eyes find him, and Draco feels his heart crack and splinter inside his chest. Harry—his love, his life—is looking at Draco like he is a mere stranger, and he is, because Draco made sure of it. Gone is the warmth and the love that Harry had always directed at him, replaced instead with a cold indifference that leaves Draco’s insides freezing over with sorrow.
Pansy and Blaise stand back to back, firing curses and defensive charms against the oncoming Death Eaters. He sees Nott, firing one spell after the other with a sneer plastered on his face. One of his spells catches Pansy, and rips across her arm. She cries out in pain as blood begins to flow out of the gash, and Draco sees red, anger coursing through him. He stuns him, and sends him flying into a wall as he crumples against the floor.
Draco keeps his eyes on Harry, watching and waiting. He hears a cry, a final, drawn-out cry as the Dark Lord raises his wand, and Harry raises his own. With Draco’s wand held tightly in Harry’s hand, he aims and fires, and Draco feels his heart stutter inside his chest as red light meets green, sparks of light emitting from the collision of two spells.
Weasely’s eyes are red, and under the light from his wand, his cheeks glisten with tear tracks that run down his face. When he sees Draco, he comes stumbling forward. For a dizzying moment, Draco thinks Weasley is about to attack him, but with a sob, Weasely grabs Draco by the lapels of his jacket, and holds him with a firm grip.
He sees Death Eaters fighting with Aurors and children alike. He fires a shielding charm towards Luna Lovegood and watches as the killing curse rebounds and kills the Death Eater that had cast it.
She strokes his hair and whispers soothingly as he tucks his face into her neck. The fabric of her jumper dampens under his cheeks, but Pansy doesn’t say anything. Draco sobs silently, and Pansy keeps holding him through his trembling. They stare out towards the lake, and Draco cries and cries until his body feels frail and exhausted.
“Harry Potter is dead!” The Dark Lord repeats gleefully, gesturing to the body that lays motionlessly in Hagrid’s arms. Draco knows that unmistakable mop of black hair, he would know it anywhere, and the realisation crashes down on his shoulders like the sky is falling apart.
He says something about no longer listening to Draco, something about his father, but Draco can’t focus on anything but Harry’s face. He refuses to let Harry be killed by a knobhead like Crabbe, not when the Dark Lord is still out there, waiting to attack.
He thinks it’s the universe’s idea of a hilarious joke, giving Draco a glimpse of the happiness that he had cupped in the palms of his hands, before it had slipped away from him through the gaps of his fingers.
Harry stops right in front of his table, seemingly unaware of Draco sitting only a few feet away. As though reading his thoughts, Harry looks up and catches Draco's eyes. The smile on his face wanes and disappears, and he blanches as he sees Draco.
He traces the lines of Harry’s face, memorises the shade of green of his eyes, and imprints his loving gaze onto the backs of his eyelids. He commits the feeling of Harry’s lips on his own to memory, and hides it away in a corner of his heart.
The stark contrast of their lives creeps up on Draco, and not for the first time, he wonders how he had managed to be with Harry.
Draco finds himself in an empty bathroom on the sixth-floor corridor, with only moaning Myrtle as lousy company.
When Draco boards the Hogwarts express, he sees Harry with Granger and Weasley behind him, in search of an empty compartment.
Red light hits Granger squarely on her chest, and she screams in agony. Draco feels her pain rip through him harrowingly, and his body reacts to the memory of the torment as he watches her convulse on the ground. He feels bile rise to his throat, and he looks away as her cries echo off the walls in the room.
Then, he’s gone. He runs back to Weasely’s side, and leaves Draco feeling colder than he has felt in his entire life. Draco scrambles to his feet just as he hears his mother shout Dobby’s name.
“After I–” Harry breathes in shakily. “After he killed me,” Harry says, and Draco feels his heart stop. The blood smeared across the bridge of his nose still remains along with the grime that clings to his skin, but the wound has been healed. Draco remembers Harry’s limp body held in Hagrid’s arms and he feels nauseous all over again.
His father cowers under the hard frown of the Dark Lord, and Draco thinks he has never seen a man more pathetic than in his life.
Draco had known it was Harry, from the shuffle of his feet as he was shoved forward. He had known from the jet black mop of his dishevelled hair, and from the lean lines of his body.
“Yeah, mate. He may be a bloody git, but I think killing someone is too extreme, even for him,” Weasley adds.
and Harry Potter stands in all his glory in the middle of the Great Hall. Draco nearly collapses under the weight of his relief.
Harry’s breath fans across Draco’s face, and Draco’s grip on the wands slacken completely, until his hold is loose. They slip away from his hands as Harry easily takes them, and Harry looks down at him for a moment. Something in his expression must give Draco away, because Harry gazes at him with confusion and hesitancy clouding his features.
“You have to do it,” Draco whispers, and his words fade away into the silent hallway. “You have to remove every trace of me.”
She argues with his father, but stops abruptly. In the next second, her shrill scream pierces through the air, and bodies drop to the ground in rapid succession, red light dancing across his vision and washing the hall with a sinister glare.
As Draco gives her instructions, a scream resounds throughout the house, and Draco feels his blood run cold. He hears Bellatrix shouting hysterically, and hears the Cruciatus Curse cried out as another gut-wrenching scream pierces through the silence of the manor. From the cellars, Weasley shouts Granger’s name.
He notices the girl say something, and shove an envelope into his hands before running away. He knows what it is even before he sees the pink tinge on Harry’s cheeks.
“It’s a very risky charm,” she says, trying to get Draco to reconsider. But Draco has made up his mind, had for weeks ever since Harry had told him about the visions.
He turns around, and Draco sees the sharp edge of his jawline. He looks better than he had last year; Draco watches the muscles on his back ripple as he talks animatedly with his hands, and sees the jumper he’s wearing fit snugly across his shoulders. He’s eating well, and that coupled with the Quidditch practice he’s immersed himself in this year, seems to be building his figure.
Draco waits until his breathing evens out, and lets out a shaky breath. He detangles himself gently from Harry’s limbs, and sits beside Harry, watching him for a few moments.
Then, Snape is in front of him, staring down at the headmaster blankly. Something passes between them, an unspoken agreement.
His moment of relief however is disturbed by Granger’s scream, and Draco quickens his pace, grabbing the goblin with him in his haste. He enters the drawing-room and shoves the goblin towards Bellatrix.
Draco knows it’s only a matter of seconds before Harry notices, so he blindly grabs a random book off the shelf, and flees from the library.
“Tinky,” Draco starts cautiously. “Tinky, I need you to do something for me.” Tinky turns to him, her ears drooping down as her wide eyes stare up at him fearfully.
He’s vaguely aware that Balise is saying something, but he can’t focus on anything besides the hollow feeling in his chest, like everything inside him has been scooped out and left behind an empty shell of the boy he once was.
When he has the top buttons undone, he stares down at his chest in horror. His pale skin has been torn apart with deep gashes. The wounds stare back at him in a mess of bright red incisions, as though someone had ripped open his skin and hastily stitched it back together.
He tells her that she can seek refuge at Hogwarts, and sends her on her way with a note to Snape. Draco makes her promise to take his secret to the grave, and she obliges. He is unusually sad to see her go.
And then, Snape is standing in front of Dumbledore, his wand aimed directly at his chest. Draco watches in horror as a jet of green light fires from his wand and strikes the headmaster.
“I love you,” Harry whispers back sleepily, and Draco breathes in his words, absorbing them into his bloodstream. Draco squeezes him tight against his body, trying to meld their bones together and become one.
“It’s a type of dark magic I’ve never seen before,” she informs him, shaking her head. “You’re lucky professor Snape got there in time, or else you would have bled to death,” Pomfrey says, her mouth set in a grim line.
In an attempt to solidify his lie, Draco tells Snape he had been meaning to ask him for a Dreamless Sleeping Potion. Snape considers him a moment longer, and nods curtly.
Draco detaches himself from Weasely’s grip and turns back to the prisoners. He sees the goblin loitering behind Harry’s feet and he reaches behind Harry to grab the goblin by his arm. Harry, however, mistakes his sudden movement for Draco trying to attack him, and he jumps back abruptly.
The Room of Requirement becomes his sanctuary, and he spends more of his time there than he does in his own dormitory.
Draco wishes he had burnt to death in the Room of Requirement, rather than to stand here with half of his soul missing.
Draco struggles to keep his face as expressionless as possible, and tries not to let his composure crumble.
Draco lowers his wand, ready to step into the light. He doesn't get a chance to take another step, however, because, in the next second, he’s being pushed aside like a rag doll, and Death Eaters are invading the landing, sneering and taunting both him and Dumbledore.
He walks in with Weasley and Granger in tow, and they both freeze when they see him. Harry, however, narrows his eyes at Draco in suspicion, and Draco stares at him with his heart trying to beat out of his chest and into Harry’s hands.
The image of the man in front of him now does not resemble the man that had once sat Draco on his lap and read him books. The man that had spent endless hours teaching Draco to fly and a few hours more, healing his scraped hands and bloodied knees, pressing gentle kisses to his tear tracked cheeks.
As though answering his prayers, Draco hears an odd sound, and he looks up and sees the crystal chandelier above them swaying precariously. It comes tumbling down onto the ground, caging Granger’s unconscious body and the goblin within it. Shards of crystals shower over the room, and one of them grazes Draco’s cheeks, spraying blood all over his hands.
“I felt like I’d lost something really important, but I didn’t know what,” Harry continues. “Like I’d lost a piece of me. And it was you all along,” Harry finishes, and Draco feels something inside him settle into place; a part of him that had been out of place for far too long, nestles itself comfortably back into its place within his heart.
He finds nothing but a perfectly sculpted vision of emotionless oblivion. It doesn’t surprise him, not really.
After landing his fifth detention in less than two weeks, Snape corners him in a dark corridor. He demands an explanation as to why Draco is slacking off and jeopardising his future, and Draco wants to laugh. Because he has already fucked up his future, ever since that wretched mark was placed on his arm.
None of it matters now, Draco knows, because he has lost something irreplaceable and there will be a permanent Harry shaped hole in his heart.
So Draco stays back. He ducks into a corridor amidst the evacuation of students and Crabbe and Goyle follow him, suspecting that he’s up to something. Draco curses silently but allows them to trail behind him.
Draco sees Granger round the corner, and she looks around sceptically before her eyes land on Draco hidden within the shadows. Draco feels his heart thudding painfully against his ribcage, and when he inhales, the breath rattles in his lungs hauntingly.
The quiet conversations from the Slytherins scattered around the common room, fades away into white noise, and Pansy’s words echo in his ears hauntingly.
“I knew it,” Harry announces. “I knew it. There was no way Ron would have willingly asked you for something.”
Something behind Draco clatters, and he stiffens. He whirls around, and the light from his wand casts down upon his house-elf Tinky, cowering with her hands clutched at her ears.
Draco sits on a table pushed against a window in the corner. Pansy finds him there while he’s working on a Potions essay.
Draco stands rooted to the spot, staring at Harry’s lifeless form. People are rushing past him in a blur of colours and someone bumps into him roughly. The sudden jostling sends him to his knees, and he struggles to stand to his feet.
“Come over to the right side, Draco,” he offers, and Draco feels a spark of hope flare inside his chest, amongst the despair and pain. He wants to, so badly, to accept the headmaster’s help. He will be safe, and his mother too, and it feels like a dream come true from the never-ending nightmare that he seems to be caught up in.
She identifies Granger immediately, and Draco sees Granger’s fear reflected back at him as she glances past him. Weasley shuffles closer to her, trying to place her behind him so that he will take the force of a hit if she were to be attacked.
