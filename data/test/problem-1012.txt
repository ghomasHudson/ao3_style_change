Harry frowns. “But I

There’s a knock at the door, and startled, Harry turns around. The same healer from yesterday bustles in with her array of potions, and Harry stands to move away. As he does, the healer gasps. He follows her line of sight to Malfoy, who’s frozen in his spot at the foot of the bed with the piece of paper. Harry quickly snatches the paper away in case the healer takes it.
“It seems that the people who abducted Mr. Malfoy have also been planning to overthrow the Ministry. This meeting is to discuss this issue as well as any new findings.”
did you tell him?”
But even with how desperate he is, Harry sits back for once and lets Draco steer their conversations. Perhaps his guilt plays a role, but he understands the fragility between them now. And he won’t be the one to ruin it. So he listens and watches as Draco painstakingly points out his letters.

responsible for what the Death Eaters did? For what Voldemort did?” He laughs, a harsh sound that grates against Harry’s ears. “How laughable. Go ahead, blame me. Blame me for the thousands of deaths and whatever wrongdoings happened. Push them all onto me would you? After all, the rest of them are dead or in Azkaban!”
Hermione pats his back softly. “I can’t say much for Malfoy,” she says, “but it’s going to be ok, Harry. You’re trying. That’s all we ask. Take it one step at a time.”
* * *
“Who? Wait, the Weasleys are part of the Twenty-Eight right? Are you guys okay? Did they attack the store? Who did it?”
Luna pauses mid-bite into a fruit tart to look at him. “Hm?”
And when Harry opens his eyes, there’s a familiar form barreling recklessly through furniture, showers of mist flowing in its wake.
“Draco’s invisible right now,” he says.
said?”
Harry doesn’t answer.
The healer seems to share the same sentiment. She exchanges a disappointed look with Harry before going about her usual routine of spells and potions. Harry watches for a bit, but then she tells him that it might take a while and perhaps he could go grab a quick lunch while he waits?
The fox swats him with his tail.
“I’ll send word to Group C about that later.”
Draco immediately sets to pointing out letters, and Harry follows.
“Yeah, I’m alright,” he says slowly. “Draco just decided to stick his head through me to give me a scare.”
Then looking at Harry again, he seems to come to a decision. In one swift movement, he yanks Harry inside and quickly closes the door, putting a silencing charm around his office. “Okay, now sit.”
* * *
“Well get on with it please. I’m tired.” Harry mumbles groggily and drags himself up, deciding that if he’s going to have a late-night conversation, he should probably have some coffee. Hermione tends to ramble excessively when she’s tired afterall. It could be a while. The otter swims alongside him.
Harry hums. “Me too.”
So he backs away slowly and decides right then and there that whatever obsession Malfoy has with memories, he wants nothing to do with it. When he’s an acceptable distance away, Harry whirls around to look through the rest of the room. He’s not forgotten his goal of finding something to do, and to his utter satisfaction, he finds a small bookshelf crammed full of potion books in the corner.
And when Harry’s produced another alphabet paper, he sets it down gently on the windowsill, weighing it down with a pen.
“No.”
He catches “valuable asset,” “not to kiss,” and “pressure” before he feels the blindfold disappear and the clank of a door.
“Look,” Robards sighs, “I know you’re a workaholic and your need to distract yourself or whatever, but I stand by what I told you yesterday. Take a break. Go home. I don’t want to see you for a week alright?” Patting him on the same shoulder with his hand, he turns and walks away before Harry can retort.
Draco looks up at him then and flicks his tail in something like a wag. And as Harry smiles sheepishly, there’s the burst of mist and vague swirls before the fox is back again like nothing happened.
Malfoy doesn’t move.
Malfoy turns to stare at the wall. “My house got ruined if you haven’t noticed.” A pause. Then quietly, “But I loathe to leave my home so Luna offered to take me in while I figure things out.”
“Yeah. They should be here in a sec.”
. He’s kidnapped.”
that gets to turn his mind upside down while he scrambles for his thoughts?
Song rec for this chapter XP:
But instead of the usual turn to Luna’s cottage, they continue on. And Harry starts to panic. Because the spell is broken now, and he’s not even sure of the way to Malfoy’s house, and why are they even going there? He stops walking abruptly.
“Ah, yes, the joke shop. Gotta say, they put up quite the fight. Found all the attackers covered in pixies and books and facedown in a moat. It was a pleasant surprise,” Owen says with a chuckle. Then he frowns. “The other stores weren’t as lucky.”
“Draco!” she peers at the cloud of mist until Draco solidifies some and looks back. Blue-grey meets silver, and the fox launches himself across the gap to cling to Luna’s hair and yap silently.
“Quiet?” Harry crosses his legs on the ground and moves the paper on top of a box so that it acts like a table.
is. Draco gasps and turns around, so that his own mouth is as far away from them as possible.
Everything from Spiderverse is good XP:
Being with Draco again is comforting and new at the same time. Harry’s glad they’re on good terms. He’s glad they talk and share the same space and air and it’s still the same. But Draco talks more now, floats around Harry more, and is all-around more active when he’s not zoning out.
Leaves rustle, the wind blows, and still the sun sets.
It takes Harry a good chunk of the day to gather himself and find the will to go face Luna. He’s not sure as to why he’s nervous. It’s not like he’s the one that kidnapped Malfoy. Maybe it’s just the fact that he had upset Malfoy to the point of tears. Maybe Malfoy told Luna how much of a dick he was. Or maybe it’s because you understand how stupid you were and regret it now, his brain whispers. Shut up, he says back.
Hermione always catches on the quickest. “Yeah,” Harry replies.
So I guess I'll be doing random song recs (ignore if you'd like) for stuff I just feel fit the vibe so...
There’s regret, there’s pain, and there’s loneliness. Harry realizes that for the first time since Draco’s been back, he’s lonely. Meaning he hasn’t been lonely in the time between then and now. It’s such a little thing, and now that it’s gone, he misses it. It’s not the same, being with Draco’s comatose body and being with Draco’s soul. Draco’s soul is life and mind and magic all in one, and without it, his body’s just an empty shell of potential lost and gone.
* * *
But Harry only told him to try harder. Or be known as a Death Eater forever. And it had hurt. It’d hurt so much. Thinking about it now, it hurts the same all over again, and Draco’s choking back tears. He’s liked Harry for so long now, he doesn’t remember how it feels to not like him. But by the time he’d realized, it’d been to late to change their relationship. Misfortune after coincidence after fate; time and time again; and there was nothing Draco could do

When the sun starts to set, Harry’s still there. He’s spent his tears dry, and he sits, exhausted, determined to catch Draco should he choose to appear. It’s so much more tiring searching for forgiveness than anger and frustration in the heat of a moment. It’s long; it’s long and hard there’s never a sure way forward. Anger has always been easier for Harry. It’s simple, it makes sense, and if he’s going to feel angry anyways he might as well direct it in ways he can use.
Draco’s frozen. He’s been frozen the moment Harry snatched the alphabet paper, and he sits, in the same spot, in the same position. But he’s watching Harry, and when Harry looks at him, the fox is staring at him with enlarged eyes and a stillness that rivals statues.
“Okay okay hold up,” Robards raises his hands then faceplants into them. “First of all, you weren’t here yet when the notice came in, so I gave it to the first group available. Second of all, you know this sort of thing is more for the detectives. And as an auror, you’re very… rash, impulsive, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsv5IeI8bA8
Harry nods. “Yeah, what he said.”
So he raises his wand with shaking fingers, and if Draco notices, the doe gives no indication. Familiar silver eyes simply watch him, and Harry lets himself drown in the gentle waves of peace and calm coming from the silver cloud. It’s safe, and it’s comforting. He’ll receive no judgement here; no resentment.
Harry and Draco stare at each other for a moment before following her in. Sitting at Luna’s table, the room always bathed in that golden glow, it’s as if Harry’s stepped into an alternate reality. The smell of breezes and herbs fill the air, and the sound of quiet domesticity stirs and awakens a quiet pain somewhere Harry didn’t know existed.
So he grabs his wand and apparates to Luna’s before he can think more about it.
And Harry decides that yes, yes he will.
Harry pauses and stares at his paper. He grimaces. That’s not quite right. He snatches the alphabet paper back from Malfoy, startling him, and quickly scrawls a “space” underneath the letters. Then as an afterthought, he adds some punctuation on the side. He hands the paper back.
He closes his eyes. There’s silver mist and silver eyes and hair that flutters from gold to pink and back to silver-white. There’s the slender fingers and elegant confidence; the quiet that comes with a breeze and of emotions spoken and words written. There’s the sky and then its colors—and the world splashed across one single person.
“Alright then. With all due respect, I will be taking my leave now.”
Kreacher's understandably slow to warm up to the fox after that, but when Harry finally tells him who the fox really is, having decided that Kreacher is trustworthy enough and deserves to know, the elf becomes the epitome of awe and admiration.
Baker had left after telling him he had three days to decide his fate. What a joke. Draco’s fate had been sealed in death the moment he had been taken. If he refuses, he will die. If he cooperates, he will die. If the Ministry doesn’t find the traitors first, he’ll probably be killed by someone from the rebellion for being a Death Eater anyways. But there’s that slim chance. Maybe, just maybe, he’ll live. Anything to live. There’s a new dice in the mix, and he’ll throw it.
(See the end of the chapter for
He’s excited, yes. If—and that’s the thing—if, this works, he’ll have Draco back in his body, and Harry will finally be able to give the man a hug. He wants to hold those fingers in his and ruffle that hair and bury his face in it and just breathe Draco in. He wants Draco. Solid and real and

“That was
“The hole used to be bigger.”
Everyone nods in understanding, if not with a hint of dissatisfaction. Mostly just Ron.
“Good.” Then Robards addresses the group as a whole. “We’ll catch Harry up to speed real quick, then continue with the meeting as planned. Any objections?”
Harry knows at this point that she’s not talking to him. But then she walks over to him and grabs his hand, pressing a small object into it. When Harry looks, it’s one of those old, antique-looking keys, with a surprising and solidly comfortable weight that puts him at ease.
“Usually only me,” Potter replied, pulling out a folder and slipping the order form in. “There’s not a big audience most of the time.”
Draco leaned over the table, keeping his hips far away so he didn’t accidentally bump against it, and settled his focus on the tower. He concentrated on figuring out the weight distribution, where he could put his glass and not have it fall or knock the whole thing down.
Draco’s foot stopped shaking from impatience immediately and his hand gripped Harry’s just as tight. Harry, who had barely looked away in the past five minutes, watched a small smile form on Draco’s lips and pledged himself right there to make Draco smile all the time until the end of history and forever. It was beautiful and contagious.
It was at this point Draco could gauge exactly how drunk Thomas was, and the answer was: extremely. Thomas pointed to each individual in the circle and said something along the lines of, “great bloke right here”, when talking about each one. Draco said hello to each, nodding along with Thomas’ ramblings. Draco reached back and grabbed Thomas’ chair, pulling it forward so Thomas could sit back down. Draco waved his wand and another chair appeared so he could sit.
He felt his shoulders loosen at the friendly touch and he sagged slightly, wondering when his best friend had become so perceptive. “I’m okay. It’s a lot to take in.”
job, especially for what the Ministry called a “reformed Death Eater”. Harry couldn’t jeopardize that by being
The next day he returned to Gringott’s, walking straight past the goblins and down the left corridor. He cursed himself for wearing the same, squeaky shoes. As he neared the door at the end, he silently rehearsed what he would say to Malfoy. After one swift knock, the door swung open just as it had last time. Malfoy set his wand to the side.
“Sorry,” he said again. “Um…is there an address listed? I never knew it existed before now. Do you think it will be…uh, never mind.”
That made Harry laugh. “It’s just past two.”
Harry couldn’t wait until his godson opened the present he bought. Andromeda had warned him that Teddy shouldn’t get a broomstick until his second year of Hogwarts, but Harry couldn’t resist. If anything, he could take it back home with him every time they were done using it, so that Teddy couldn’t get into it when Andromeda wasn’t looking. Harry reasoned with himself. Flying was a huge part of his life, especially now that he had the time to actually enjoy it, and he wanted to share it with his godson.
Draco noticed a pattern which repeated multiple times over the course of the night. Someone would approach Potter, speak for several minutes, then move on. Eventually, though, Potter seemed to have had enough and wandered away. Draco, who’d actually begun listening to R-whatever’s rant, hadn’t noticed until he looked one moment and Potter was gone. Disappointed, Draco resigned himself to finish off his current conversation and then go home, ready to try again the next night. That was until Potter showed up behind him, clearing his throat so sharply it felt like a dagger had been thrown between him and the woman next to him.
“Oh, haven’t you heard?” Came Harry’s joking voice, unlocking his fingers from behind Draco’s head and sliding his hands down to the blonde’s chest. “You’re dating the great Harry Potter. You know, that guy that saved the entire wizarding world? Heroes don’t lose their quidditch spots.”
Thomas was seated on the edge of the bed, tugging pants on so slowly Draco thought he may have still been asleep. Draco heard a gag and then a sigh, watched Thomas lower his head into his hands, the planes of his back on full display. He was lean and not so muscular, like Draco.
“So…will you? Do you want to go out sometime?” Potter asked pleadingly, his eyes wide and vivid green.
He finishes the second potions book that evening under the glowing orbs of light he’s conjured, and he really doesn’t know if his brain can handle any more reading after that. He feels like he’s learned more potions during this one day of reading than what Snape has taught him, all five years combined. But he also doesn’t want to sleep so he stretches and makes his way out of the sky-room, as he’s come to call it.
. All of him. The bright bits and the dark bits and all the colors in between, visible or invisible.
“I saw Malfoy at the Ministry this morning.”
Harry’s frown deepens until there’s a permanent scowl on his face.
The fox rises, and with all the grace in the world, it lowers its head in a bow.
He walks around the bed, staring over every inch of the still body lying in it as if he can will the fox out. He looks under the bed then, under the chairs, behind the plants, out the window, and still, there is no fox.
Baker asks him if he’s changed his mind. Draco looks at him with disbelief, and when Baker makes no other move, Draco laughs and tells him to go fuck himself.
“Okay okay look,” Harry starts over, “it—no after the war—the world was messed up. Yeah? So now we gotta fix it.”
Robards eyes him for a second then sighs back. “Jokes aside, I’m glad you’re taking a break. That’s the whole point of them you know? To sort your thoughts so that when you come back, you’re set and ready to go. Make sure you take full advantage of it and rest well.”
kids. Ever.”
“Yeah,” Draco agrees warily, standing up and stretching. “We don’t have to set up cover, right? The Healers know we’re Aurors?”
Realization dawns.
“You’re going to have to get out. All but one guardian.” The healer says, and the Mediwitch ushers them all out except Bill, and then slams the door closed in their faces despite their protests.
“Away?” Remus asks, cocking an eyebrow.
He can’t bring himself to let go of Draco’s hand.
And the thing is, Scorpius knows he’s been fair with everyone else, too; Rose is half in love with him, and he’s not
“I’ve been helping mom around the kitchen for almost ten years.” Draco frowns. “Of course they were good!”
“Nothing.” Sirius is the first to recover. “Nothing, just – that name is not said so freely in the Wizarding World, Scorp. And – just – nothing.”
“And?” Blaise asks.
“Good.”
“Thank Merlin,” Pansy mutters with an eye-roll. She hates Skeeter. Then she seems to think about it. “Maybe they used it to get you to open it.”
“I’m not asking.”
“What?” Scorpius asks, frantically trying to remember where he put his wand; he doesn’t think the professor will hurt him, not really, but at the same time, it’s more than a little disquieting to wake and find him staring at him in his dorm while everyone else is asleep.
“Harry!” It’s less than professional, but Draco throws himself at his husband as soon as the bomb has been taken from him, kissing all over his face and wrapping his arms around him.
“You know,” Hermione says reluctantly. “There’s literally a complete house of ‘resourceful’ students.”
Draco thought he couldn’t feel lonelier than he did after he came back from the hospital and everyone was acting weirdly, but he was wrong; this is definitely worse.

“But he didn’t!” Parkinson screams. “The Dark Lord didn’t until you told him you unbelievable piece of-”
“See?” He says. “She’s gone. It’s just you and me. You can put the bomb down.”
There’s nothing here. Everything’s clean, baby stuff in every drawer and closet. He’s about to call Greyback and tell him he’s done – if he gets the
He pushes Snape out of his mind as hard as he can – it’s not really effective Occlumency, as the point would be for it to be discreet – and the next thing he knows, he’s standing in front of Lucius Malfoy.
Scorpius dies in the Forbidden Forest, and just for a few minutes, he gets to see his parents. He's never seen them before, not like this.
“Then I don’t get it,” She says. “If someone baked
“Lucius Malfoy?” Fred asks. “What does Lucius Malfoy have anything to…”
“When we were seven, mom took us to France to see some ‘aunt’.” George says. “You were five, Gin was four and Draco was three.”
Ophelia catches it in her mouth, and Draco makes a face at her over Harry’s shoulder.
* * *
Draco’d figured as much, if he’s honest. She’d asked him instead of them, so it hadn’t taken a lot of thinking to figure out that was the reason.
“I’m looking for a diadem?” he asks. “Ravenclaw’s diadem?”
Draco’s been sleeping the furthest thing from ‘well’ that he can get, but he nods anyway.
“That was Malfoy!” Harry says, shaking all over. “That was – you –
“I love you, too.” Draco whispers, fisting his hands on Harry’s suit. “

That’s all they do the whole day, all other classes are cancelled. Ginny achieves hers – a stallion – and so do several other people, like the Patil twins, all of Draco’s roommates, and Pansy and Blaise.

Sirius elbows his ribs. “Your ‘dear old heart’ is in perfect shape, Moony, don’t be melodramatic.”
Hermione doesn’t, but she doesn’t respond.
“Yes,” Harry says, very softly. He smiles. “I don’t think I’ve been better.”
Back in the dormitories, Draco sits on his bed and munches on Dragon Nougat.
“It changes often. The first time I conjured a Patronus, it was the first Christmas I spent at the Burrow. Remus and Sirius had to visit some cousin out of town, and I thought I’d be alone. And Ron invited me-”
“Excuse me?” Ginny asks angrily. “You think we wouldn’t-”
“We all believe things we know are a lie sometimes,” Draco shrugs. “This can be undone. We can destroy the diadem.”

That catches Draco completely off guard. He’s getting more and more confused with every word Harry says.
“Harry, Ron-” he begins.
After
“Yes,” he whispers.
Draco’s completely confused now.
“An old wand?” Remus asks.
would look for you.” Ron snaps viciously. “If it were the other way around.”
“You’d mind, Harry.” Fred says brightly. “The brat sleep-talks. And sleep-walks. And moves around. He can share with Georgie.”
Before Draco can open his mouth, she grabs him, and they disapparate.
“Yeah.” Potter nods. “You? Stupid question, of course you are, he’s your brother it’d be ridiculous-”
Ron hums. He’d rather Harry were already in love with Draco, but he won’t say anything. Draco will kill him if he even thinks about meddling in another one of his relationships – the last time had
He has. Especially since he started dating Draco, he just – well, he loves his husband so much, and he thought it was something they both wanted; Harry has always imagined them later on, older, with their own little Quidditch team, the kids flying while the dogs bark in the yard. He’s always thought that’d be their life.
“That you might not know about.” McGonagall explains. “Any letters without names. Floo calls to the common room. Messages of any sort that were even remotely suspicious.”
Sirius, Remus, and Teddy all show up to pick him up at King’s Cross, just like last year, and Remus kisses the top of his head when he sees him.
And really, Draco’s furious at Potter right now, but he desperately wants to get away from Smith, so the second he lets go he scrambles to Potter’s side.
Harry arrives back at Hogwarts at nightfall with a heavy heart.
“Right,” Draco says, business-like, straightening and joining his hands behind his back. “We’ll start now. I’ll be taking the negative, you’ll be taking the positive. Do you have your opening statement?”
When the day is over and everyone’s at lunch – Draco’s been skipping the meals lately to avoid seeing his so called friends – he goes to the Astronomy tower and sits with his legs dangling out the windows, looking at the students passing through.
The owl pecks at Draco’s finger, so Draco takes the letter tied to its paw. It’s not his family’s owl, so he can’t imagine who it may be from.
“Sorry.” He says. “I had a nightmare and I-” He turns back to look at Ron, only it isn’t Ron and he’s staring straight into the gorgeously green eyes of one Harry fucking Potter.
“Yes?” He asks.
“Merlin,” Draco says, nearly jumping out of his skin. “Where did you even
The search for Horcruxes is unbearably slow. The days pass in monotony, slowly driving him insane with worry. He knows the rest of his family is okay – or he wants to think so, because he hasn’t ben able to talk to any of them since this bloody stupid fucking unbearable search started.
“He doesn’t know he’s your son, Lucius.” Snape answer. Draco’s eyes widen. Lucius
“Draco,” Bill says warningly.
Harry sighs. “I just – I know he’s angry at us, and he has every right to be honestly, but I wish I could talk to him about it.”
Harry nods, relieved, and Remus laughs.
Draco’s temper snaps.
? Draco shudders. Unlucky them.
“By the caster.” Bill says.
“You both love Draco,” She says. “And we’re all worried about him. You think either of you are marching towards whatever place he’s in heroically? You’re
“Alright,” he says calmly. “Then why –

weird to have a ‘usual’ spot in Knockturn.
Harry nods and closes his eyes tightly before pulling away.
Draco smiles lightly. “I know. I was going to say that if your parents are up to something and you need a place to go, you’re always welcome at the burrow, even if you have to sleep on the floor.”

“Alright,” he agrees. “We’ll - bake a cake?”
The way they died.
He takes them outside, near the black lake, and tells them to spread around. Several seventh years are there, too, and Draco doesn’t understand why.
“Come on,” He says, rolling his eyes. “You haven’t been at lunch lately, and you need to eat.”
They wake up later again, when Ron freaks out about Draco being in his bed, and Harry showers and goes with McGonagall so they can visit Dumbledore. She floos the two of them only, leaving a worried looking Remus, Hermione, Ron, and Draco behind, and as much as Harry wishes he could stay with them, he can’t.
“So you knew where he was when he was missing?” Ron asks.
“Are you in love with him, too?” Ron asks.
“It takes some longer than others,” Lupin shakes his head. “It doesn’t mean you’re less powerful.” Draco thinks it does, but he decides not to argue. “We won’t keep seeing it in class anymore, but I’d like for you to continue practicing.”
“That man may be brilliant, Potter, but he is not a seer. A supposition from him is not a death sentence.”
And hates him.
“That’s a lie,” Draco says. “And you know it. As long as it’s here that – that boy – Voldemort, he can come back. He

He tosses Harry his wand.

Draco shakes his head. “I left it in the room of hidden things. It’s better there.”
“Look, it’s fine.” Harry says, even if his voice indicates that it’s anything but. “We haven’t been going out for that long anyways, it’s not like you can’t-”
“I did!” he says defensively.
Draco squeezes her knee. “You know, if your parents-”
“I’m sorry,” he says hoarsely.
Parkinson gives half a shrug. “Unless they change their minds, an hour, hour and a half?”
Luna hums. “What else?”
He did, but he hasn’t told anyone. McGonagall, Remus, Snape, and Merlin knows who else spent a long time trying to figure it out before a man named Slughorn finally told them about the Horocruxes. It didn’t take them long to figure out Harry was one, too.
Sprout smiles fondly. “Yes,”
“Malfoys have to look their best.” Malfoy says. “That includes eating right.”
Draco sighs quietly. Out of the corner of his eye he can see Pansy and Blaise looking at him, but Draco upturns his nose and ignores them, shoulders tense.

After a moment,
“What?” Draco asks, momentarily thrown off.
“You don’t have to stay here,” She says cautiously. She’s trying not to make his breakdown worse; Draco doesn’t think there
“Okay,” He says excitedly. “I’ll, uh, pass by your dorm at Eleven?”
“It’s the Malfoy family crest.” Draco points out.
“So what do you want to do?” Harry asks, puling away. He keeps an arm around his waist as they part, and they walk inside and towards the kitchen. Draco dumps the rest of the wine down the sink, and then leaves the glass on the counter. He looks around.
Turns out all sixth years are being taught the charm at the same time, so he sticks close to his sister, Luna, Pansy, and Blaise.
The nursery’s… pretty. Cozy. Unlike any other room in the manor.
“It’s alright,” he says again. He hadn’t been sleeping – Draco had fallen asleep in the middle of their muggle telly marathon – so he’d caught the nightmare early. “It’s alright. It was just a nightmare.”
“You’re shagging Nott!” Harry snaps.
Thomas’s head snaps up from his Pine tree.
don’t feel like I thought I would.” Draco honestly doesn’t know
He tightens his coat around himself as he gets outside. He doesn’t know where he’s going, but he just wants to get somewhere he doesn’t think about Harry and Blaise together in bed.
Neither of them sit, but they do listen to her. She huffs.
A beat of silence.
Harry knows it’ll be alright.
to wake you up.” Ginny grins. She sticks her tongue out at him, and he scowls. “Don’t make that face, you’ll get wrinkles.”
“I will.” Draco says. It’s the only thing he’s been doing since they started.
“I saw you once, actually.” She says. “We met in France. Molly took you to meet me, with your siblings.” And he thinks that may sound familiar. His mum had introduced him to her once, he thinks, said she was his aunt, where he got his blond hair from. “We stayed for a few days in a hotel, and you told me you loved Puffskeins.”
“I thought it would read my signature, so I just kind of tapped my wand against it. Then I tried a number of spells and even jumping the gate, but it just threw me back on the wrong side.”
“Of course I will,” Draco assured, his grip on Harry’s arm slipping down until they were holding hands. The pair stood at the edge of the gate, peering at the house in the distance, and then Harry slowly took his first step onto his new, inherited property.
“I’m checking on some investments,” was Draco’s response, turning back to face Potter.
Normally when discussions over his “boy wonder” life happened, he got angry, but there was a little glint in Neville’s eye, a tiny little smile at the corner of his mouth, that told Harry that he was joking. Truly, Harry thanked his friends constantly for not trapping him on that pedestal that the rest of the public wanted him on.
Harry was deep in thought, staring at the ground just on the other side of the gate. He couldn’t help but feel a jolt of hope. Maybe someone in his family was still alive and they’d been taking care of the Manor. A newfound excitement spread throughout his body, his mind racing. Who could it be? His parents? Grandparents? A long lost cousin? A grin started to form on his face as he thought about his possible alive family. Images of him surrounded by raven-haired witches and wizards, hazel eyes and wicked smirks floated through his brain. Spending Christmas holidays with them. Easter, or his birthday, or even just a casual Sunday dinner. God, he wanted that.
Despite the consistent interruptions, Malfoy only seemed amused every time Harry came back in. As soon as Harry had mentioned the blood part, his head had dropped forward and his shoulders shook with laughter. Harry just watched him for a moment, drinking in the sight of his former enemy laughing so openly in front of him. He had to admit, it was a pretty weird sight. Though, as Malfoy’s eyes crinkled at the sides and Harry saw an actual, genuine smile on his face for the first time in-- well, maybe
“Mate, are you kidding?”
The game started shortly after and Harry couldn’t find the snitch anywhere. After forty-five minutes of circling the pitch, the other team’s seeker on his tail, he still came up short. He thought he’d seen it over the opposite team’s stands, but it had just been a muggle camera that someone had brought in. He pulled up near the keeper of his own team and hovered for a few moments, looking around.
know most of them are my
Draco rolled his eyes and watched the top of the sheet slide from Harry’s chest down to pool in his lap. Harry suddenly felt self-conscious, cursing himself for deciding to sleep naked last night and was tempted to cover himself back up, not that anything particularly indecent was on display. Draco stared for several long seconds before schooling his face as though there wasn’t a hungry blaze in his eye. “Get dressed, I’m making breakfast.”
Andromeda gave him a fond smile, her red lips turning up. Her eyes flitted over him, seemingly to assess him for any wounds. Harry stood there awkwardly, knowing she would do this every time he came over. He glanced around the kitchen and found a few more vaguely familiar faces. They were the parents of Teddy’s school friends, each one holding a glass of wine.
“How’d it go with Luna?”
“Yes.” He blinks. “I’m helping.”
Harry stuffs his face back into the blankets. He feels like crying. It’s frustrating. Communicating has never been this hard. But then again, Harry has never had to try very hard. People have always come to him. But for once, he’s trying to reach out to someone and he’s faced with rejection after rejection. He can’t understand. It’s hard. It’s frustrating.
“Half the roof is
Hermione lightly swats at Ron’s arm but leans into the hug all the same. “I think it’s just the fact that you’re doing something without Malfoy’s permission.”
“I say… this is calming. I think this is your way of coping. And I think… that’s fine.”
Draco snaps to attention, even if he doesn’t show it.
They give each other a quick wave, and Thirty-nine darts out the door. Harry turns back slowly, listening to the quiet breathing and watching the rise and fall of Malfoy’s chest. With the fox gone, Malfoy looks as if he could just be sleeping. Harry entertains that for a while. Malfoy looks peaceful sleeping; if not tired. But he looks younger and older at the same time, and it’s like he’s timeless. Time freezes around them, and Harry can only sit.
Harry rather expected it to be an awkward affair. He's never been one to invite people—or acquaintances—over, seeing as he's not really proud of his home. It's dusty and dark, and in the three or so years that he's lived there, he still hasn't found a calling in interior design or remodeling. Not to mention Kreacher's vehement protests whenever Harry so much as touches a Black heirloom or a piece of antique furniture. So he's pretty much left the house to its own—and Kreacher's—devices.
Her face softens. “Oh before you go, I heard Luna’s back from Brazil. If you want to go talk to her.”
He quiets down now, looking at this notebook. At the notebook that wasn’t quite what he was expecting, but gave him that piece of Malfoy anyways. In fact, it’s better. Because this is a part of Malfoy that’s more subtle. A part that Malfoy himself wouldn’t ever write down. It’s the perfection, the want, the lack, the shattered dream—it’s everything put into the quill that wrote these words, drew these diagrams. It’s the wish for a home, built and fixed, and Harry suddenly feels the desperate need to be a part of it.
“You can’t just take it. Is that why you’re rebuilding his house?”
Then he grabs his own paper and does the same, only, taking his time with this one because there’s nothing else in the room he can destroy. So he tears it ever so slowly, focusing on the ripping sounds, and when enough time has passed for him to stop shaking at least, he walks to the window and watches the pieces fall from his fingers.
“Tell who? What?” Harry said, confused and half asleep. He pulled the covers back up to his shoulder, giving Ginny some, but not all, of them.
“Hi, how can- oh, Malfoy…hey,” Harry Potter greeted with a smile. The door to the kitchen was still swinging behind him, but he seemed to ignore the sound.
Potter didn’t exactly surprise Draco anymore. When they were kids, teenagers, Potter could easily hit Draco with a comeback, sneak into the Slytherin carriage to eavesdrop on them, and have a Stinging Hex placed on him so his face was unrecognisable as he found himself caught in Malfoy Manor. And the things Draco heard he did during the war as well, like successfully casting the Cruciatus Curse on Amycus Carrow, breaking into Gringotts and escaping on the back of a dragon, and so on. But nowadays, Draco thought, Potter had become predictable. He’d bought himself a house close to where Draco knew the Weasley’s resided, joined the Auror force at the Ministry, and was almost married, although he broke it off within a month of the wedding.
Hermione shrugged and gave him a smile. “Whatever you think is best, Harry. I know you’re eager to see what’s inside the manor, but I think taking your time is the most important part. You know how magical houses can be tricky to navigate. Remember this place when we first came here? We spent forever fixing it up, and it wasn’t abandoned as long as your place has been.” Her rant continued, “Harry I’m… worried. I don’t want you to shrink back into your own bubble when you finally get inside. I know it’ll be hard to see evidence of your family, but you have to remember to talk to us, okay? Remember what that healer told you?”
Draco’s little book had a home in the pocket of his waistcoat during the day (his bedside table at night) and held Draco’s lifeblood, his collection plans, his notes, everything. If one were to flip through this book, they wouldn’t be able to piece together what individual pages meant, except for perhaps the very last page, which held Draco’s list of bent Gryffindors, ones he’d bedded as well as ones he planned to.
He knew, logically, that there was a possibility he would not like what he found on the other side of the door. It could all be gone. There was no way of knowing until he turned his wrist and pushed. But he couldn’t. It was all too much. When he walked on the grounds, his hopes shot up that maybe everything would be fine as long as he was on the premises, but a pull in his gut reminded him that no one had been there for years to maintain it.
Harry hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to say it. Whether he should explain first or go with his gut. Explaining would be the reasonable thing to do, but then there’s the opportunity for rejection that Harry doesn’t think he could handle. He figured it was best to beg for forgiveness if it doesn’t work out. What’s life without a little risk?
Draco nodded and turned back to Potter, who was still smiling throughout their entire interaction. Draco felt weak in the knees; he needed an escape. “Well, I can pick up that order on Friday then. Thank you.”
Draco shot him a little glare and apologized to his client, then turned his attention back to Harry. “I’ll be with you in just a moment, Mister Potter.”
Draco’s legs were crossed as he sat, but as Harry nudged the topmost knee, he let his crossed leg fall back to flat. Harry seated himself in his lap, one hand sliding up Draco’s neck to cup his jaw while the other rested lightly on Draco’s ribs, careful not to wrinkle his work shirt. For a few moments, they just rested their foreheads together, breathing quietly, staring into each other’s eyes. Harry finally leaned in and pressed his lips to Draco’s, tilting his head ever so that their lips slotted together nicely. Draco sighed into the kiss, his tense shoulders falling into a relaxed position as Harry parted his lips.
Their conversation drifted to the plans for the new shop, construction and whatnot, which certainly got Harry’s attention. A piece of parchment spread out between them, sketching and erasing and redrawing the layout. This was what Harry liked. Being able to see all the steps in a plan and then executing them to perfection. Creating new layouts for specific instances, like a plant shop. Soon enough, Harry was offering to help Neville with the construction, with the latter wizard urgently accepting.
Everything was the same. The gate opened at his touch, the trees and plants lit up, the sun shone down on the long, narrow pathway to the front door, and that feeling of glee returned in Harry’s chest. He felt like his heart grew three sizes every time he walked through that gate.
Harry heaved a gigantic sigh and threw the covers off himself, taking a moment to sit on the edge of his bed before he committed to touching his feet to the cold floor. He pushed himself up and pulled on the pair of pants he’d worn last night, shuffling out into the hallway and down the stairs. Draco had a scarf wrapped around his neck, despite it still being mid-summer outside, and Harry found a small, sheepish smile for him.
Potter pushed him away when they landed, snapping, “Where are we?”
Harry laughed as he reached for the canister, slightly embarrassed. He twisted open the cap and took a whiff, fully expecting it to be a slightly rancid smell like he’d known bubotuber pus to be. Instead, he got a very pleasant mix of citrus and floral scents that didn’t burn his nostrils like he’d thought it would.
“It…worked. It worked!” He laughed, grabbing onto Draco’s shoulder and pulling him in for a hug. It was so quick that Draco didn’t even get a chance to hug back before Harry let go and started excitedly bouncing on his toes. The concrete path to the house was now visible, but was still covered in overgrowth from the lawn.
“Draco-” he began.
“Expecting company?” Hermione asked, her eyes circling the kitchen before landing back on him.
Mrs. Weasley rounded around the tree to find them and immediately pulled Harry into a rib-crushing hug. The whole Weasley clan followed behind her, and he saw some raising their eyebrows at the sight of Malfoy leaning on the nearby tree.
He hesitated.
He compromised with himself and hoisted Draco into his arms, depositing him on the couch before he made the long trek up to his bedroom.
“Well anyway,” she changed the subject quickly, “do you want to go tonight?”
She yanked the blanket more on her side and sighed. “Malfoy.” But Harry barely heard her, eyes falling shut. She kicked him swiftly in the shin and he yelped.
Already sitting down on the proffered stool, Harry claimed, “I don’t mean to interrupt.”
It was in this condition he decided to stop by Gringott’s, a decision he regretted as soon as he stepped into the lobby. Witches and wizards turned to look at him and goblins sneered when he walked through the lobby to the corridor. Surprisingly, his shoes did not squeak the whole way down to Malfoy’s office. He stopped just short of the door and tried to
“Look, I…like you, alright? I don’t see the point in skipping around the fact anymore. Of course I felt like you may like me too since we almost kissed the other day, but let’s be honest, I’m not the most observant person. If you don’t like me though that’s fine and I’m sorry for kissing you without talking about it first but I’m on my last leg with this house. I’ve been here everyday, I’ve tried everything you said, and that was the only thing I could think of that might convince it that I intend to stay. Those
The meeting went smoothly after that. Harry made minor adjustments to his sketches while Neville made a pot of tea and helped his worker in the store. Together, the two former Gryffindors laid out a doable plan for the new shop, somewhat similar to the one they were currently standing in. At last, Harry excused himself, rolling the prints up and bidding Neville adieu.
“Oh…alright. I’ll see you then.”
“I don’t really think about you, Malfoy. Ever. We’re not friends, we don’t have anything in common, and we’ve not spoken to each other since your trial and that was years ago.”
“By Malfoy?”
“It appears, unless I’m mistaken, to be the deed to the Potter Manor,” Malfoy said with finality, setting down his tools and fixing Harry with a blank look.
The next Saturday, Harry had the first quidditch match of the season. It was a beautiful day, sunny and warm with a slight breeze that flowed through the grass at Harry’s feet. He was getting a feel for the pitch before the game started, breathing in the scent of the freshly cut grass. The Weasley family, including Ginny who was on a professional team, attended, and took up a whole row of seats near the front of the stands. Luna, Neville, Hermione, and surprisingly enough, Malfoy also showed up. Harry had only invited him in passing, just to fill up the awkward space in his office after Malfoy had caught Harry staring at him for too long. He felt it was more appropriate than professing his attraction to Draco, somewhat of a neutral topic they could both relate over. He had never expected him to come, but there he sat next to Luna. Seamus and Dean, finally back from their honeymoon, were dressed in their old Gryffindor garb, despite Harry’s new team colors being green and white.
“One moment please!” Draco called, eyes a bit panicked. He immediately stepped back from Harry and tried to smooth out his shirt, conjuring up a mirror to fix his disheveled hair. When he looked like he hadn’t just been making out with Harry Potter for several minutes, he turned back to him and woefully said, “I’ve another client.”
Harry gave his jogger-clad arse a purposeful wiggle in Draco’s lap and the blonde responded by growling into the kiss, taking Harry’s bottom lip between his teeth lightly. He pulled away for no more than a second to say, “Don’t-- fuck, I’m going to be late…” They reestablished their kiss and Harry did it again, smirking with Draco’s breath hitched. Draco’s fingers, tangled in Harry’s hair, tightened their hold and Harry pressed further against him, not willing to let go just yet. In a perfect world Draco could skive off work and they could spend the day on the couch, snogging until their jaws went slack or rutting against each other until oversensitivity forced them to stop.
“Bippy is being here for her whole life, sir! Bippy remembers when Master James was just an infant!” Harry’s heart wrenched.
He could already smell the fresh baked bread before he even opened the door. The bell rang as Draco slipped inside and he took a long look at the cakes in the display case, trying to decide what would be best for the party.
Draco took a step forward and the first word of his reply was halfway out of his mouth when something miraculous happened. A loud scraping sound erupted from the gate and Harry jerked in surprise, his head turning so fast he felt dizzy. Or maybe that had been the effect of the kiss and the--
trees. He felt more alive than when he was playing quidditch. And speaking of the game, his new yard was plenty big for a regulation-sized pitch to practice on.
Harry traveled back and forth from Gringott’s to his new manor a total of four times that day, each time walking back into Malfoy’s office even more agitated than before. “I’ve asked nicely, I’ve used spells, I’ve tried begging, and I even tried touching my blood to the gate, and I’ve gotten nothing!” he ranted, pulling up a chair opposite Malfoy and sitting with a huff. “Maybe it’s not meant to be mine.”
“What are you even talking about?” he asks.
, and it runs around freely.
And with that, she takes Draco’s arm and leads him out the door, leaving Harry alone with the wolves.
“Unlike
“Fine.” He says, voice higher-pitched than he’d like. He sees Ginny, Fred, and George snickering from their seats, and Hermione’s looking at him pitifully. He swallows. “I’m fine.”
Blaise shakes his head.
“You’ve grown a lot since I last saw you.” She says conversationally, dropping her arm to her side.
“Because I’m fucking terrified!” Draco half-yells. Harry stays quiet, and Draco swallows looking away. “I don’t - I don’t remember my mother. And my father was terrible. You’ve seen – you

Draco’s lips quirk. “Okay. What are we doing in the restricted section in the middle of a Friday night?”
The three of them are squeezed into Blaise’s bed. His dormmates had been in the room, so Draco’d grabbed him and Pansy and shoved them in, closing the drapes tightly with several sticking charms and at least four
“Don’t, Potter.” Draco snaps in his ear, all teeth and no bite behind it. His fist grips tightly at Harry’s shirt. “It won’t end like that. I won’t let it.”

the exact moment they’re all fucked.
“Fine.” He says. “Err, good. Have you made any progress with your Patronus?”
“I promise.” He says.
“Tell that to Miss Granger-Weasley,” she says coolly. “Tell that to Mr. Lupin and Mr. Black. To Edward.”
Scorpius has never really known how to do what’s best for his own good; he’s told he gets that from his father.
He looks like a corpse.
“Look, I realize you’ve gone out with a lot of people-”
“Oh, congratulate them for us!” Arthur says.
“Home.” Draco says, chest suddenly aching. “Yeah, I remember.”
“We’ll tell you if we need anything else.” Draco says lightly.
“Don’t give him flowers.” He says. “Just – be calm, okay? Go on a date with him. Figure out if you like him. Figure out if he likes you. Talk about what you like, get to know him better. Try not to tell him you want to marry him and have babies with him.”
I hope you enjoy the chapter :DDDD
it bothers Draco, hates that it makes him feel ridiculous for it.
The death eaters holding them pull them away at the same time Bellatrix cries, “
Ron cracks a grin.
“Sure,” Draco nods. “Black lake?”
“This is not you.” Neville is entirely white faced, but his mouth is set grimly.
“No, we’re not,” Harry says. “We’re just having a casual, devastating conversation about getting a divorce, so you’re wrong, Gin.”
“We heard you were missing,” Arthur says to Luna. “Are you alright? Were you with Draco?”
He looks away and clenches his jaw.
“I won’t let you.”
He loses track of Harry.
Thomas!” Draco says, panicked, and he can see Harry laughing quietly. Bastard.
Draco smiles lightly. “Don’t worry. There’re plenty of things I don’t want them to know, either.”
Everyone nods. Lupin waves his wand, and several images project from it.
They’re all here. Hermione, Pansy, Blaise, Gin, Ron, Harry. They keep giving him cautious looks like he might run away.
Hermione smiles softly.
“Who told you?” Ginny asks in a small voice.
you?” He practically shrieks, mortified.
“Now,” Hermione says, clipped. “Are you in or are you out?”
“I-” Draco desperately scrambles for a way to take back what he’s said – or at least somehow wave it away – but he can’t think of anything. “I-”
In the dark, he finds her hand – burning in comparison to his, so cold he might be mistaken for a corpse – and they link their fingers together gently.
“Mom,” Bill cuts her off gently. They all turn towards the door, where Fleur and him are standing. Ron hadn’t noticed they’d come back. “You and dad go eat something, okay? Draco probably won’t wake for another few hours. Fleur and I will stay here.”
"Draco Malfoy, I swear to God-” Hermione snaps under her breath, causing Draco to laugh lowly as he ducks under a hanging plant pot.
“If I had any idea where he was-”
“I’m a
“Are we going into that subject?” Harry asks lightly. “Because then we also need to talk about why you’ve been venturing into Knockturn Alley.”
McGonagall’s lips tighten. “Your brother received a letter. Sent by Lucius Malfoy.”
Hiiiiii sorry it took so long :/ I re-wrote this chapter like fifteen times, no exaggeration :( hope you enjoy it! A little of the golden trio for a change..
He stands on his tiptoes, and reaches up towards it. He can feel a faint hint of a magical signature, but he doesn’t recognize it. It’s not any of the death eaters’.
going to Granger’s because of it.”
He raises his wand, and a silvery stag trots out from it. Draco stares in awe. Not only is it beautiful, but it’s utterly
“Why would we do that?” Ron asks, glare tightening.
“I don’t really know what his logic was.” Harry says. “Okay, that’s a lie. He only turned in the first one because he thought it might be cursed, and then you said it wasn’t, but you didn’t let him read it-”
“I’m not.” He says. He isn’t. Malfoy’s lying. “You’re lying.”
“He’s your best friend, Harry.” Hermione says, frowning lightly. “He’d stick with you through anything. We both would.”
“But you won’t get to meet Sophie’s baby!” Harry tells her. “They won’t remember you, you’ll just be that one grandma that blew herself up!”
Draco nods.

“I convinced the elves to sneak me some before breakfast.” Draco says, smiling and perching himself onto the space between Harry’s legs, placing his legs over Harry’s and wrapping them around his hips so they’re face to face. “I thought you’d like some. You’ve been sleeping less and less lately.” He looks at him sternly. “Even if you’ve been trying to lie to me.”
I don't know if it's still christmas where u are, but it is where I am, so MERRY CHRISTMAS!!

Harry grins, pulls him closer by the hip, and presses a deep kiss to his lips.
“Right, well, but I am here,” Harry says. “And-”
“Chocolate?” Lupin offers. He’s given Draco some before – often while they were practicing the Patronus Charm, since the dementors made Draco feel like utter shit – and Draco’s mouth waters, but he shakes his head wordlessly.
“Harry,” he says, very patiently. “Come inside, yeah? We’ll - watch a movie or something.”
“I call the left side,” he tells Ron instead.

fuck – fighting beside him, dying, or wounded, or dead, or
bed, actually, just with Harry in it – as long as there’s ‘no funny business’.
“Not properly.” Hermione waves it away. “We don’t really ask each other much after what happened in third year-”
Draco’s so confused he merely nods. Narcissa seems to need verbal confirmation, because she gives him a pressing glare until he answers.
They walk to the Gryffindor dorms, and when they enter the dorm, Harry’s shirtless. It’s all Draco can see.
“Invisibility cloak.” She says. “It’s not mine. I…
Draco wakes with a groan when someone hits him in the face with a pillow.
“Right?” Draco agrees.
“Can I sleep here tonight?” he whispers, and something in his voice must not be right, because Fred opens an eye to look at him. He assesses for a minute, and then pulls back the covers to his bed. Draco gets in stiffly, and Fred pats his head.
“Tough luck.” Ron says, and Draco glares at his brother. “Again.”
He stands with the full intention to grab Draco and keep him, but – of course – he’s beaten to it by Molly Weasley, who hugs him so hard his feet are lifted off the ground.
She sends over pages of research, and before Scorpius has had time to go through it all, Rose has done some of her own.
She leaves with a curt nod, and Harry turns to Draco with raised eyebrows.
She rolls her eyes and throws a muggle pen at him.
“We have to tell the students.” Draco hears McGonagall’s voice faintly – really, they always have their meetings in the abandoned Potions classroom, they should change it up once in a while – and they slow down as they get closer.
? It’s almost past curfew and we couldn’t find you
Harry swallows. He needs to tell them about the Horocruxes. He needs to tell them he is a Horocrux, but anytime he tries to, he sees them, and they’re happy, and he doesn’t want to ruin that.
“Who teaches you?” Remus asks, grabbing his trunk from him.
“Well?” Bellatrix demands. “Is it him?”
Malfoy looks at it distastefully. “You should watch what you eat.”
about it, any of it.
She seems to be even more nervous about this than Fleur is, and so she gives everyone something to do. Thankfully, everything she assigns to Draco is Fleur-related, since he is the best man, and so he doesn’t have to face Harry.
Draco swallows. “What about me?”
Draco’s face doesn’t soften. “I could be.”
, Draco wants to say,
“I turned it in to McGonagall.” Draco says. “She didn’t let me read it.”
“They could be signing.” Zabini says. “Or they could just be napping. Draco gets too strung up sometimes, Theo always knows what he needs.”
Teddy frowns. “He was pretty fair with me.”
There’re plenty. Draco loves his family and his friends, and they love him, too, so they have plenty of happy memories together. He just doesn’t know which to use.
Thanks so much :DD
When Headmistress McGonagall places the Sorting Hat on his head, Scorpius ignores the whispers; he’s been doing so all his life.
Harry scoffs. “Tons more,”
“Okay,” Remus cuts off warily, because Harry’s like his son, and he’s seventeen! The thought of him being married scares the shit out of Remus. “It depends. Is he the kind to like public gestures?”
Draco pulls him close again, and, together, they walk towards the Gryffindor Dorm. Harry tightens his hold on Draco’s hip and kisses his hair, trying to calm the dread pooling in his chest.
“No!” Both him and Ginny say.
“Harry, is everything-” Ginny begins, but Harry stops, refusing to tear his eyes away from Mrs. Thomas.
“I know,” Harry says with a small frown. He kisses Draco’s forehead, and Draco wraps his arms around him, accidentally spilling some wine.
As the time gets closer, however, Harry begins to regret it, but he refuses to back down now. They’ve a right to know, and he knows it’ll help him calm down, too.
“Why the hell does that matter?” he demands angrily. “What
“I’m disgusted,” he says. “Really, I am.”
Draco sees a flash of pale blonde hair right before the door shuts again.
“One year!” She exclaims. “Good! Making it through the first year is the hardest I tell you, I wanted to
“I’m not a baby,” Draco says, fighting the urge to pout.
“You’ve been sleeping in the Gryffindor dorms for weeks, Draco, so something must be going well.” Thomas grins. “Potter, you have to be gentle with our Draco, because he’s still a blushing virgin-”
Dobby apparates them into the Burrow. At the sharp crack, Ron’s entire family – even Bill and Fleur – emerges from the dining room – they’d been having supper – and, when they see them – and then a very familiar blond figure in Harry’s arms – they all begin talking at the same time. More than a few of them are sobbing.
“No, Harry-” Draco begins.
There are old home movies, soundless; his favorite one is the video of his first time in a ferry, in his dad’s arms while his father filmed. He's watched it enough times he could recreate it in his sleep, the way his dad grinned, the kiss his father pressed to his forehead before sitting next to him and waving at the camera, so he recognizes them in the mirror before he recognizes himself.
Pansy’s eyes are teary, but Draco doesn’t mention it because he doesn’t fancy getting kicked in the balls.
“This might not be a good time,” He says, but really, he doesn’t think Ron can get any angrier, so it’s as good time as any. “But I think I’m in love with him.”
Hermione’s frowning thoughtfully. “He was a baby then, how would he have a way in?”

The corner of Draco’s mouth pulls upwards, and he shakes his head, exhaling slowly.
Fred cracks a smile. “Mum, if Draco was light before, he’s even lighter now.”
“Have you talked to Mr. Weasley about the Horocruxes?” She asks, and this is
for him. “And you don’t have to get in trouble. Just pretend you lost me.”
Potter – who Draco was trying very hard not to notice – steps forward.
Draco nods, unsure of what to say.
The healer frowns, and she mutters four spells, two of which Ron recognizes as healing spells.
Ron snorts. “That’s not going to happen.”
They all frown at each other.
“I love you,” He says, and presses a kiss to his hair.
Better than nothing, Ron guesses.
“Then leave in peace,” Draco sneers venomously.
“Narcissa died to protect you.” At the name, Draco’s headache intensifies again. “

family he’ll have to think again.”
“What’s going on?” he asks, frowning lightly.

Harry looks down at the list.
He looks around him, trying to determine where he is, but his mind comes up blank; he’s never seen this place before.
“Library,” Hermione says.
“I’ll take that as a ‘no’ then.” He says mildly.
“Hullo,” Potter smiles at him, and Draco feels the color rising to his cheeks quickly. Fred and George snicker, and Draco sends them a venomous glare.
“Oh.”
“Don’t,” Harry’s eye snap up at the unknown voice, and there’s a blonde woman by the doorway. She looks a lot like Draco. “There’s no time. Get the girl from the dungeons. You need to get out of here.”
After they leave, Hermione carefully uncovers his mouth, so he does the same. They get out of the library quickly, and when they arrive at the Gryffindor common room, Hermione throws the cloak off.
Spain?
She laughs. “Calm down. You look like an angry kitten.”
“There’s no way.” The wizard says. They’re both kind of old, and they’re wearing dark dress robes. “He’s dead. That Potter kid killed him.”
“I-” he starts.
“Stop that.” Harry hisses with difficulty. He’s trying to concentrate, but it’s not helping; he can’t stop Snape.
Shit, but Harry just messed up big time.
Theo – the only person he’s ever even come close to having sex with – is asexual. The only reason Draco finds himself in his bed after every single Quidditch game is because Theo asked him to, since some boys in his dorm wouldn’t stop giving him shit for being a virgin – and ex boyfriends or not, Theo’s always been Draco’s friend.
“We’ll call it plan B.” Pansy says agreeably. Blaise nods.
“He’s my brother’s best friend!” Draco says. It’d be complicated enough if Potter didn’t spend every summer at his house, but he does, and so it’s even more.
“I changed my mind.” Draco shrugs. “Come on, Potter, I want a baby.”
for Merlin’s sake-”
Harry gives him a crooked grin and an easy half-shrug.
of them, I don’t care if they’re buying ice cream, you
“So, err-” Ron scrambles for something to change the subject, but he shuts up, because as they get closer to the courtyard, he begins to hear a chanting of ‘fight, fight, fight’.
It takes him a minute to realize his family has stopped walking.
“You know something we don’t, don’t you?” Ginny’s the first to say it, but they’re all thinking it.
Everything comes back to him.
Dementors, mainly because of how they make him feel, and one of the reasons he wants so badly to succeed at casting the Patronus charm is so that he never has to be with one again.
He assumes Ron and Ginny told their parents, because Draco gets dozens of letters from them and all of his siblings. He puts them in a pile under his mattress to read when he’s feeling better.
He’ll do it, drive Greyback insane with it; he’ll do it to the rest of the death eaters, too, all of them, death too merciful.
everything, he wants his family. He wants to not know any of this, he wants to know if Lucius Malfoy is telling the truth, wants Ginny to hug him and hold him and tell him Lucius Malfoy is full of shit, that none of it is true, that she didn’t know about this anymore than he did. He wants Harry to love him, he wants desperately to
“How did he?” Remus asks. “Read it, I mean?”
“Did you?” Ron asks, heart pounding. He desperately wants to grab Draco’s forearm, see if he has the mark, but he won’t; he wouldn’t.
Harry nods. Now he just has to figure out how to be honest when Draco’s avoiding talking to him at all. He sighs.
“More than he realizes.” Snape says solemnly. He doesn’t answer the other questions.
“Search, princess.” Greyback barks at him. “Or you’ll be my dinner.”
Everything is blurry, his ears are ringing. Distantly, he knows he needs to stand, needs to reach his wand. Without it, he’s as good as dead, and he needs – needs – needs –
He’s on Draco in a second, kneeling beside him and pulling his head onto his lap. He’s blinking, trying to clear his head now, and there are tiny cuts all over his face and neck. Harry curses nastily in his head.
Hermione shakes his head.
my favorite dessert I’d cherish them forever.”
“I love you,” Draco repeats, and squeezes his hand firmly. “And we’ll make it through this.”
“Letter
Draco nods, heart hammering in his chest.
It had turned into a less happy occasion when Draco continued to avoid them all – especially Harry – and they realized that even though he loved them, it didn’t change just how angry he was at them.
“How am I supposed to-” he begins, but she interrupts him by pulling him into a narrow alley. She kisses his forehead quickly.
When he’s done, he fights back the rising panic – because
do will stop them, like the only option left is some holy miracle that isn’t coming.
“Trouble sleeping?” Harry’s voice sends a chill through Draco’s spine, and he straightens slightly.
on the bright side tho, i presented my last exam today so yay
He’s getting more and more worried that his feelings for her aren’t going away; instead, they’re increasing, and he doesn’t know how he didn’t realize it before. She’s a know-it-all and pestering at times, but she cares about everything she gets involved in, she’s passionate about her beliefs, she’s everything he’s ever going to want.
“Mrs. Thomas,” he says, slowly, stepping into the room. “You don’t have to do this.”
“That’s where you’ve been all the time lately?” Ron asks incredulously.
“Hey Draco,” She says hastily. Draco hums. “Can you not tell Harry or Ron about this?”
, Draco? Honestly, how could one be into boys with so many pretty girls walking around? Granger’s also plain dreamy.”
“You know he’s going to find out at some point, right?” Bill asks. “I agree right now is not the best moment, but… maybe it’d be better if it came from us.”
“Yeah,” Scorpius mutters distractedly. “I do, too.”
The Grey Lady barely even glances at him.
He runs his fingertips across the paint, and shudders when the magical signature gets stronger. It feels warm, comfortable, and Draco
“Hey, little bro.” Fred grins. “Gave us right a scare when you disappeared.”
“If he makes you happy, let him know so.” Remus continues. “Stay around him. If you find out you like him as much as you think you do, then you ask him in another date. If you find that he makes you happier as a friend, well you know what you want.”
“Blaise!” Draco grins. “How are you?”
“I thought it was because of Ron.”
She does see Draco’s smile then. It’s dry and lacking any sort of humor. “That might get complicated in the next few hours.”
He turns around to thank Thomas, and finds Ron glaring down at him. Well, shit.
thinks about-”
letter.”
Draco makes a face before he can stop himself, and he sees Lupin smirk discreetly. He probably knew Draco’d find a way to listen in unless someone were with him.
He concentrates harder on the memory he’s chosen – the time Blaise, Pansy, and him were fifteen and managed to charm all of the portraits to chant ‘Blow me’ ominously for
He doesn’t have a wand, but he feels like there’s something he’s missing.
“It’ll end with me, or Hermione, or McGonagall, or bloody Luna finding a way to
“We did?”
The locket, the diary, and the ring have been destroyed. The diadem, too. Hermione and Ron have gone to look for the Basilisk venom, and Harry wants to go with them. He
“There has to be sometime when he doesn’t have it with him!” Ginny says. “When do you not have your wands?”
They get to the Green House – where they’ve been meeting Sprout for detention every day – and she gives Jae, Noah, and Adam a huge back of tree seeds and sends them on their way.
“Theodore
“And he died.” Pansy finishes, closing all the books and the files with a flick of her wand. She puts them all in her bag again.
“Can’t leave,” Draco mutters weakly, lips pressed against Harry’s shoulder. “We need to – need to go – nursery – Horcruxes-”
Lupin smiles, pleased. “You’re welcome, Mr. Weasley.”
“Hard to say. They’re still good friends, so sometimes they stay there and just talk, even if they don’t do anything.” Zabini says. They all stay quiet, and he listens carefully.
“Ask her to go with
Love you babes <33
.” He snaps. “In case that wasn’t clear already.”
“You should.” Draco says. His face lights up. “Ask her to Bill and Fleur’s wedding!”
“And you’re just
Draco’s squeezing at his finger under the table – it’s wrapped hastily in a napkin because the blasted owl bit him, and it’s still bleeding – and straightens instinctively when every adult in the room turns to him.
Robards interrupts him, waving a hand carelessly. “Don’t mind them. That’s just what they all go by if you want to find them within the Ministry. Not their real names. Including the Auroras.”
hands, and Harry hastily pulls away.
Draco ducks and trembles. And before he can regret his decision, he gives a quick shake of his head. “I refuse to join.”
Harry frowns. “And my stag is supposed to help with that?”
“Oooh,” Harry realizes. For a brief moment, he perks up at the idea of visiting the quaint town. Then just as soon, he deflates. “Ah, I’m really sorry about your house by the way—”
Draco flinches and immediately scrambles
The fox gives a small nod.
At every turn and reception, Thirty-nine flashes his Unspeakable badge, and Harry follows suit with his Aurora one. They make small talk as they walk: how old Thirty-nine was when he joined the Unspeakables, Hogwarts, Auror work. But not once does Thirty-nine elaborate on what the Unspeakables do, and Harry knows not to press. It’s enough that he’s been allowed to join the case.
But Luna seems satisfied with whatever she was deciding and turns away. She waves her wand, and with a pop, a plate of the cookies she just baked appears, settling down on the dusty table.
Draco just hiccups in response as he tries—and fails—to calm down.
Harry hears a loud clatter and panicked muttering before a disheveled Hermione appears within his view from the fireplace.
There’s no weight on his chest, but the cool tingle from Draco’s mist passes through the blankets well enough, and for a while he lies there and breathes. The cool tingle shifts up and down with the movement, and Harry doesn’t want to move.
“Ah,” Luna tilts her head and squints at him a bit before continuing. “I probably should’ve told you that those are my test cookies.”
The walk to the Department of Mysteries is… interesting to say the least. Despite having been there once back in fifth year—which he tells Thirty-nine about and the latter laughs—he doesn’t remember the way there at all now. So he follows Thirty-nine through hallways he’s sure were not there last time and greets the strangers that wave and call to him. And as the people they meet slowly trickle out, Harry watches the mist in his peripheral grow solidly brighter until the doe is there, trotting beside them.
“Malfoy?”
Harry glances at the doe. Draco looks back. He’s quivering, and Harry’s so muddled in his own thoughts that he can’t distinguish his own emotions from Draco’s anymore. Is he excited? Scared? Is
He sits up abruptly. “Malfoy—”
But then Thirty-nine is walking forward to the hospital bed occupying most of the room, and Harry recalls what they’re here for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ecbYr0zmx8
“You fine with that?”
He looks back up at imaginary-Harry, who’s still glaring at him, and cries harder. He erases this angry Harry, and struggles to conjure up another memory of Harry. Harry when he was younger, back at school. A happy Harry who smiled and laughed, and Draco could pretend it was all directed at himself.
Harry lets out a guttural groan as a reply.
His ears ring. It’s loud, but quiets soon enough, and it’s only when he’s starting to wonder if they’re being attacked that he hears the loud peals of laughter. He crawls back in front of the fireplace. Then gives an internal sigh of relief even as he glares at the faces.
And Harry can’t follow along anymore after that, and he struggles to keep himself from simply trying to grab Draco and shake him and tell him to
So he stands up abruptly, his chair scraping back with a harsh screech. Both Luna and Draco look up at him with varying levels of alarm.
“Wait, don’t you sleep?”
“Well not all of us can be Hermione, keeping everything in that big brain of hers.”
Harry blinks. Shit. He obviously doesn’t want to cause the destruction of the rest of Malfoy’s house, so he breathes and does his best to reign his anger and magic in. If not for himself, he will at least try to control himself for Victor, for Malfoy. For the boy curled up on the ground, hurt and unconscious.
“Okay but he tried!”
Draco just stares. Best not to say anything when there’s no right answer.
“What the fuck,” he says.
“Oh um,” he starts, and when Draco only gives him that ever patient look, he caves and decides to be truthful. “Well uh, Luna gave me your keys...”
And spit he does.
Even during the peak of his teenage hero-saving antics, he wasn’t stupid enough to try to overthrow the Ministry. The Ministry is
” Harry spins abruptly. “
Thirty-nine shakes him lightly out of his mind. “Yeah, I know. It’s kind of hypnotic in this wing of the hospital. Makes you want to stay.”
. How there’s always some deadline to be met, someone who needs to be saved, people to talk to, chores to be done. But right now, right now he doesn’t need to worry about anything. In this one second of
“Damn,” he finally says, still pulling air into his lungs with a desperation that’s almost entertaining. “How can you even apparate that far? How are you not—”
Eventually, they reach a set of doors that spell open at Thirty-nine’s presence, and Harry gapes. Spread out before him is what could be the lobby of a muggle hotel. Rugs and sofas litter a large expanse of space, and two sets of spiral staircases spiral up and up and Harry isn’t sure he can even make out a ceiling. Occasionally, he sees someone walk across the lobby or up and down the staircases.
There’s a scrape of chairs as they both stand. “Yeah yeah, of course,” Harry nods. “Whiny customers and all that.” They share a smirk. “Anyways,” Harry continues, “I should probably get going too.”
funny guys.”
There’s a pause and Harry can practically hear the gears turning in Hermione’s head.
have a problem because how is he supposed to get food in an empty house that requires constant supervision?
“I heard them talking about Malfoy earlier when you guys were passing by!” He gestures at the assembled Aurors and Unspeakables. “Don’t lie to me. I want to know what’s going on. I asked around earlier and literally
Malfoy’s back.
Malfoy pauses, his mouth open with unsaid words before he had been cut off. Harry takes the moment to take in Malfoy’s appearance. Jeans, another oversized hoodie, and his disheveled hair gave indication to having just been woken up, if his sleepy gaze didn’t say anything.
“You haven’t hurt anyone Draco. Now hush. Sleep. I will always love you.”
Draco tilts his head.
Eventually, it’s Malfoy who speaks first. “Why were you looking for me?” There’s no bite to his words. Just a neutral resignation.
“Nice to meet you, Draco.”
Ron finds him some time later, and shakes him gently until he rouses. He blinks blurry eyes up at his friend.
Victor simply gives a thumbs up before going back to obliviating witnesses. Sighing, Harry walks through the gaping doorway, only to be greeted by the sight of what was probably every single object in the house, destroyed. Furniture overturned, scorch marks on the walls and the floors. Noting that this is the only house damaged, Harry is pretty sure there are probably personal grudges involved. How much must one be hated to bring such destruction upon themselves?
“Well just as Ron said, there’s not much you can do about that now. Unless you want to take it apart?”
. Enough of it that Draco had wanted to just jump out of the building into the freezing sea below. Anything was better. Anything. But even then, Draco, with his fear of death, held on.
Harry waves. “Sure, sure.”
Harry realizes that it’s already the fifth day Malfoy’s been missing when he wakes the next morning; which is honestly pretty strange once he thinks about it, because time has flown for him. Is time supposed to fly when someone is missing? Probably not. But he can’t think of any reason for it to be otherwise.
And for a moment, Harry’s glad he’s not technically an auror anymore.
It’s golden hour now, and the streets are pleasantly quiet, with the occasional talk and laughter carried over on the wind. “It must be quite loud in London right now, especially during rush hour,” Luna muses.
And even as his fingers graze the tips of Draco’s ears, the collection of mist swirls and disintegrates. The ears flick. The fox refuses to stir. And Harry sleeps.
Harry raises an eyebrow. Why Draco recognizes dungeon designs, he has no idea. But he’s starting to get an idea where Draco got his obsessiveness with house structures. He tells Owen what Draco said.
So instead, they chatter away about work and quidditch at dinner, and Harry is happy to let them distract him with talk of things that don’t matter. It’s relaxing and carefree, he thinks, to have his friends with him and dabble in topics that would make them seem quite shallow otherwise.
Ron pinches the bridge of his nose. “What am I even gonna do with you,” he sighs. “But
The door swings open almost immediately after Harry knocks, and at the sight of blonde hair, he splutters his grievances out.
of the world to assault Malfoy and leave him burned and bleeding on the floor of his home. His peaceful home in Grasmere with no one but Luna and the land and the sky for company. And how much had Harry wished for such a life? Because if the world couldn’t let Malfoy have his refuge, then how would Harry ever get his?
While it’s certainly not the first time, Draco dreads it all the same. Each time comes as a surprise, a shock, and before the relief that comes with his rescue, he panics and panics and panics because his life dangles in the hands of strangers.
Then there’s a quiet knock at the door and a healer comes bustling in. She gives Harry a nod and proceeds to weave a complicated set of spells around Malfoy’s bed. And Harry remembers. Malfoy’s in a coma. Practically dead. No memories, no feelings, no control. The only thing that’s still Malfoy is the small fox, and even that is something shaky and not at all grounding.
Draco turns his face away back into the ground. He’ll take what he gets. He knows this isn’t real. He knows it’s better than nothing. And yet even his imaginary mother won’t address his being gay and raped. He supposes it’s because the knowledge of his real mother is still leaking into his wishful imagination. If anything, why can’t this be perfect? It’s not.
By late evening, they’ve finished unloading all the boxes, and the house is rather starting to take on a cozy air. Despite the relative lack of furniture, the items Draco did have were personalized and varied. At eight, Luna magically—literally and figuratively—shows up as soon as Harry’s rolled out the last rug in the sitting area, and despite Harry’s weak protests, drags him off with promises of food and treacle tart.
Draco stumbles back. Shit. Shit shit shit. He’s lived this long, struggled this long, bore through the pain and the humiliation and the risks and he’s going to die after all. No, that’s not quite right. He won’t die. Dying is for souls. He’ll have his soul sucked out and eaten. He’ll probably just… disappear.
“Yes.”
By late afternoon, the rain has finally stopped long enough for Harry to release his water barrier and allow himself a well-needed break. He lies under that still-cloudy sky for a bit, enjoying the lack of magical strain before getting up and deciding that he should take the opportunity to get some work done. He grabs his jacket and heads out, apparating to the first address on Malfoy’s list.
“Would you like to come in? I do have tea.”
that. Because the tension is building and vibrating under his skin, and just
“Well, I—I’m an auror now, and I’m fixing it. Ron’s fixing it, and Hermione’s fixing it—”
But eventually he comes across the room tucked away in the back of the house he recognizes as the brewery. And to his surprise, it looks fine. Better than fine actually, he decides again. It’s a fully furnished brewery with tables and stands and vials of ingredients and potions lining the walls, and Harry rather thinks it rivals Hogwarts’ potions classroom. He’s quite impressed.
trying so of course it’s all fine! There are people out there! People hurt by the war! By Death Eaters! By
“I realized that I don’t know shit about him. I don’t even know what he’s been doing these past three years. And the first time we have a proper conversation, I call him a Death Eater. It’s just wrong. Why’s he like that? Why am I like this?”
They share a small grin. Ron stretches and stands up abruptly. He offers Harry a hand. Harry just looks back at him with slight confusion.
Filled with an inexplicable urge to just
Malfoy considers him for a moment, then settles on his stomach in front of the paper.
Harry stares at the ceiling. He stares long and hard, and lets his eyes roam over the tiny grooves and bumps until they all blend together into one big mess. Dust motes and light dance across his vision, and his frustration and anxiety drifts. He closes his eyes, sandwich having long since slid out of his hand and now lay forgotten on the floor.
here?”
The woman next to Owen speaks up. “Hello, I’m Gale. Junior Aurora.”
He feels regret, and he wants to feel remorse; there’s pain, and there’s a wish. And he wishes to understand. Because to understand is to sympathize, and to sympathize is to feel remorse, and to feel remorse is to repent. He wants to repent.
He spreads countless newspaper articles across the floor of his kitchen, newspapers he hasn’t bothered to look at in ages. Magazine clippings, photos, printed speculations from the internet. He spends hours just staring at them, looking for something but not knowing what. He racks his brains, looks for the hidden clues he knows must be there. But his auror-mind had shut down when he handed Robards that form, and he’s no more detective than the average person.
The three in the fireplace exchange glances.
“Well,” Hermione starts, “About an hour ago now, there were a bunch of sudden and simultaneous attacks on a lot of businesses and stores. Most notably, many of these have been found to be belonging to the Sacred Twenty-Eight. We’re warning you guys just in case.”
, because the world won’t accept his efforts. They chuck his good-intentions back at him and call it plotting. They take his calm and repentant demeanor and call it manipulation. The world has run out of second chances and Harry couldn’t just give up his.
. But it’s not the same. He bows his head and cries over their hands.
Then it’s just a matter of arguing with himself to actually get up or not, and it’s definitely a lost cause because he simply lies back and resigns himself to a morning staring at a grey sky. Not that he minds. In fact it’s the most useless and peaceful idea he thinks he’s had in a long time. So revel in it he will.
“Yup.” Then at Harry’s horrified expression, “Oh don’t worry. They’re not harmful or anything. Just tell me if you feel anything you wouldn’t normally feel.”
Harry is not proud to admit that Ron has to drag him out of St. Mungo’s before he can blow up the hallway. The idea that anyone would block
Malfoy, so Harry sits on his hands and watches the fox settle on Malfoy’s chest and let out a yawn. When it finally spies Thirty-nine, the fox looks away resolutely. But to look away is to look at Harry, and as soon as the fox does, it yelps silently and disappears in a whiff of mist.
He eventually falls asleep late in the afternoon, sprawled across the floor in an undignified heap. But he can’t care less. He’s tired, and just wants to sleep. To sleep until he’s not tired, and he doesn’t know how that works.
He watched as something impossible simply became more impossible, step by step, word by word. All by his own hand. And now, years after everything and having sealed away his feelings, Harry barges into his life again just to yell and berate him, and Draco can’t take it. He’d worked hard at first, trying to get a Ministry position, and when that didn’t work, set up his own potions business at Knockturn. But even there, the landlords were unwilling to offer him a space. He tried place after place and place and it was only after a full year and a half of rejection and homelessness that he gave up. And it was Luna who had found him after so long and helped him back up—
He’s staring at a particularly grey patch of cloud and wondering how much time has passed when the first drop of rain hits him in the face. Then fuck, because it’s raining and he guesses he really shouldn’t have been lying out in the open in the first place anyways. But he keeps cursing, because he’s
” Robards asks this time.
The fox bobs his head.
Draco flops down next to it and starts.
The guards continue to poke and prod at him, and Draco cries and the Dementors suck his life away, and Harry and his mother comfort and scream. He dozes in between as much as possible, simply to escape it all, and even then, the cold seeps in and freezes his mind.
And then he’s spilling his guts out and laughing and crying at the same time and at one point he almost rolls off the roof from laughing too hard.
He sits and trembles in that chair, in that room, in this beautiful wing of the hospital that’s also somewhere new and strange. If Grasmere’s at the edge of the world, then this place is above it. Somewhere high above between that horizon and the sky.
For a month after the trials, the media had kept vicious tabs on the Malfoys, from reporting the sale of the manor as war reparations to every, mundane activity. Criticisms and speculation of what they must be secretly plotting rang through the magical world. Harry remembers that month as one of the most irritating periods of his life. The moment he went anywhere, talks of the savior and whispers of the Malfoys rang in his ears. The din had only continued to grow, and Harry had been furious and agitated. He wanted to crawl out of his skin and tell the world to just shut up, shut up,
He’s been awake from sunset to sunrise. He’s lived from life, to now, and eventually to death. And finally,
Harry wakes with a sneeze and an itchy nose. He’s rubbing furiously at the offending appendage before stretching, and realizes that he’s sore from lying on something hard the entire time he’s been unconscious. He groans. Then opening a bleary eye, he takes in the bare walls, the cloud-covered sky, and the blanket draped over him.
Harry glares at Hermione, taking in the firm set of her mouth and her hardened stare. Knowing he isn’t going to get much else out of her, he lets out a breath. What was he even expecting? It’s not like ranting to her will actually change anything. He’s just complaining and being an overall git.
- I'm not quite sure what I'm doing so please don't slaughter me or my baby
“Are you okay, mate?”
staring at the sleeping doe when the fireplace beside him flares green and a fizzle shoots out, followed by a loud
“I honestly don’t know what you think of me. Are you mad at me still? If so, I’m sorry for last time.”
It’s almost déjà vu, Harry thinks, when he walks down the hallway towards the kitchen with a quiet Malfoy at his side. He watches those careful movements as Malfoy flits about, eventually bringing back two cups of black tea. Except Luna isn’t there to settle the atmosphere, and a tension hums in the space she left behind.
The group turns to stare at him. Robards eyes him for a moment, then walks forward. “It’s not—”
assured. But it’s not like he can do anything about it so he sighs and nods.
and it was
Harry isn't really too surprised to find out Malfoy is friends with Luna; they are two of a kind he supposes, he could see it. But finding out that Malfoy had told Luna where he lives, and even moved into the same small town… well that was a bit more shocking.
Harry and his friends look at each other.
“We haven’t opened it.” McGonagall says. “Mr. Lupin and a few other professionals are checking it for curses or any sort of remaining magic trace.”
“Maybe they think you’re somebody else.”
Draco nods, even though he’s not sure he isn’t lying.
“What’s your name?” He asks. The house elf is the only constant. They leave him standing by the door of whatever room Draco’s searching, as if to watch him. Draco doesn’t know what good it is.
Harry’s face flushes angrily. “Are you fucking stupid? He’s my boyfriend-”
“Okay, my dear,” Sprout says, and she leaves.
“I kissed him on the forehead.” Harry says, looking horrified, ignoring Remus's question completely. “Merlin.
Harry leaves as fast as his legs will carry him, and finally, in the safety of the Gryffindor common room, he collapses on the couch, feeling like he might vomit.
“I haven’t.” He says. He wouldn’t forgive himself if his family died, and he wasn’t here. Wouldn’t forgive himself even if he
“I thought Snape might take him!” Hermione says defensively.
“Don’t interrupt me,” McGonagall says. “Mr.
“Are you okay?” Potter asks after a beat, and Draco looks up, surprised.
“I know!” Draco whispers loudly. “Merlin! Snape is a
?” Harry asks. “Draco, that’s not-”
She doesn’t seem to care about answering his question. She pushes him further down the alley, and wraps him in a tight hug, kisses his temple.
“Since Hermione’s tired—no, Hermione I’ve got this, you’re ranting—anyways, they found Malfoy about half an hour ago and they have him isolated at St. Mungo’s right now.”
So Harry cries over the sheer
He opens his mouth to voice his confusion when he feels the swipe across his neck. The fox gives a nod towards the now-bustling hallways, and when Harry gets the memo, Draco launches himself into the air to trot leisurely back towards his room.
The normally-calm and smiley man buries his face in his hands. It unsettles Harry a bit. That can’t be good. Meanwhile, Robards scribbles away.
Draco gives a hoarse laugh. Seems like fate has granted his wish after all. But going this way… no. No, he can’t. He
The sky goes from a yellow-orange to a pale purple and still, he sits. He sits until it’s dark and he can see the sporadic lights from the other houses illuminate the small patch of land that Grasmere occupies. And beyond that, it’s dark. It’s dark and black and it’s as if a void simply exists in the space between the horizon and the sky. It’s different from London. So different. London is like a galaxy of stars and comets, going as far as the eye could see. A city that never sleeps.
“Um...” Harry searches for words while Luna looks around at the piles of wood and stone and shingles that sit all over the yard and roof.
When his parents had been around, his father had been the one to find him; again and again in that relentless desperation. Each time, he had cut it close, pulling Draco out on the verge of death. Draco supposes this was his father’s way of repenting, of apologizing. But Draco is tired. He’s tired of lies and acts and his father’s silent apologies fell on deaf ears and unseeing eyes. He doesn’t care. He can’t care.
“No, not at all. We just need you, Harry, to cast your patronus. It’s a stag, yes?”
But then that thought seems to stick in his mind and he can’t get over the possibility that maybe this notebook is something Malfoy treasured. Something that’s genuine and real and maybe he has a piece of Malfoy here with him, right in his hands. Even if the real Malfoy is lost somewhere in the vast, vast world.
Hello again! Sorry once again for the late update; I really feel like I'll be apologizing a lot for that T^T
* * *
Imaginary-Harry gives Draco’s hair a last ruffle and sighs. “Go to sleep, Draco. You don’t know what’ll happen when Baker comes back. Get some rest.”
Malfoy’s hair, Harry quickly puts his hands under his thighs. He’s a bit horrified at the thought, but more than that, the idea of it sparks something in Harry’s chest that’s awfully similar to butterflies. It’s strange, and it’s new, and while it’s not a totally unwelcome feeling, Harry ignores it. His fingers tingle.
Luna looks up at him, then with a slight pop, apparates right up besides him. She settles down gracefully even while Harry gawks, as if finding one’s friend on the roof and sitting down with them up there is the most natural thing in the world. But perhaps it is.
The shouting gets louder, and as he starts to see guards running down the hall, the words become clear.
And Draco sounds so upset that Harry actually laughs.
“David. Senior Aurora.”
Heyheyhey! I'm high on sleep deprivation and stress from who-knows-what lol. But here's an overdue chapter!
“Ah, okay, that’s something to think about… well we’ll see how it goes.” Thirty-nine pauses and gives them a calculating look. Then, “Can’t hurt for you guys to know a bit, I suppose… Having an ejected soul and still being present in the mortal realm is essentially like a ghost. With the added patronus bit here. Ghosts are ghosts, because they choose to stay while being cut off from their bodies due to the lack of life, if that makes sense. However, Mr. Malfoy here clearly still has life, meaning his patronus is keeping his soul in another sort of shell. We need something else to give his soul a path back out of his patronus and to his body. That’s all.”
“That works. Anyways would you like some lunch? We really should eat before the sprites get to it. I brought some cookies too.”
