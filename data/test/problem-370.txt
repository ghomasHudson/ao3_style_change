Lest narrowed his eyes. “Brat,” he muttered as he turned around and resumed their way to the Great Hall.
“Merlin knows what she’d do to you if she saw what I looked like now,” Harry replied dryly, smoothing his rumpled clothing.  He couldn’t help but grin briefly at Draco’s grimace.
“Actually, Professor Snape checked your potion after you collapsed,” she said finally.  “When we couldn’t wake you up, he checked what was left of it to see if perhaps the potion had turned into something poisonous.  But even though he had it tested again and again, the results always said that the potion was correct.”
’ Harry thought incredulously as he watched her load up his plate with more food.  “Thank you, Mum,” he said sweetly.  Hermione just sniffed and took out a book.  He looked pleadingly at Ron but the redhead just smirked.
He tried to not delve into it, tried to tell himself he had enough to think about and good things were good things that shouldn’t be broken.  He wanted to believe that maybe life was leveling off to a state of normalcy.
Qye waited but Harry didn’t continue.  He sighed, his anger and irritation fading away as he once again absently reached out to where Harry used to be, seeking some reassurance for tomorrow.
“Hm.” Lest looked hard at the redhead who, to his credit, didn’t back down. Lest smirked slightly. “Well,” her brother said, turning and beginning to walk, “we better get a move on. We don’t want to miss him, now do we?”
“Thank you for visiting,” he said sincerely. Professor Opacre smiled back at him and patted his head, causing him to blush a bit. He held out the other one for Lest, who looked taken aback. “You too. And I’m sorry for anything I did when I wasn’t aware.”
Wide green eyes – looking so much like the first time he had looked into them – rose up slowly and met his own.
As Harry picked up his broom, Ron looked down at the ground, playing with a loose thread on his robe.  ‘
.’  He sighed and rubbed his eyes beneath his glasses.  It was Saturday night and instead of working on his Transfiguration essay, as he should have been doing, he was instead staring at the latest of Voldemort’s strikes.  This attack was the biggest since the Diagon Alley Massacre and he couldn’t help but feel a bit bitter and frustrated.
They wore rags of clothes, torn across and haphazard as if split. Both incredibly pale and thin as they stood back to back.
“Now,” she continued, smiling and sitting on top of her desk, “For our first lesson, I think all of you should pass with flying colors.  All I want you to do for the entire period is ask me questions.  The lesson begins now.”
“Krista,” the Pater said coolly and she looked up embarrassedly.  “While she’s teaching those children, she’ll also be correcting their views on us, which means they’ll tell their parents.  The adults who have some shred of intelligence will listen to them and will help us when we need them, hopefully.  Also, while she is there, she’ll be negotiating a treaty with Dumbledore and be sending me updates regularly on what’s going on there.  Dumbledore is leading a force against Voldemort and Marylin will be part of his group, which means she’ll be receiving information on what he’s doing.  If the Dazains do join him, we’ll be one step ahead of them and we’ll be waiting to crush the rest of them.”  He looked around.  “Does anyone here see why it’s a good plan?”
!' at Lest, making the vampire curse in a language that was not English as he moved to avoid the blasts of red lights.
“Thank you but…I need to work on this on my own. But I promise I’ll talk to you about it,” he added hastily when he saw Hermione’s face begin to fall and the frown on Ron’s face. “Later, when I think it through a bit more.”
Harry scowled and turned his face away from his smirking rival, who resumed his way to the Slytherin Table where he promptly sat down.  ‘
wrong with him.  So she had taken it as her duty to badger him until she figured out was wrong and how to solve it.  He loved that in her, her way of taking care of her friends’ problems, most of the time.
“Lest…” he whispered, looking at the vampire’s face, shaking slightly. Lest looked at him, emotions swirling in those missed dark blue eyes, moving quickly around and Qye held onto him tightly, his dark green eyes flickering, dark and bright, dark and bright, unwilling to leave him once again…
Zabini shrugged it off and moved on, continuing his conversation with the other Slytherins, none of who had sneered at Harry.  Harry had been left dumbfounded next to an equally surprised Hermione but he had waved it off as a freak occurrence.  After all, he had never had any particular problems with Zabini and it had been in the middle of classes.  And
“Well, we can’t exactly learn it from you old folks who can’t bend far enough to touch your shoes without breaking your back or wheezing,” Jacob snapped, glaring at the Latvian Head.  Saira growled, half-rising out of her chair.
“I don’t make it a habit of ordering my mother to do anything, Black,” Lest snapped sharply, lips thinning.  “She - ”
Sighing, he turned away from the sad-looking figure in the window and proceeded to wake his best friend up.
Seamus shivered and nodded fervently.  “I think you’re right,” he said in a hushed voice, his blue eyes turning quickly away from the blond.  “What do you reckon?” he asked quietly to his friend.  “Think Dumbledore has really gone mad?”
The hand twitched when the Slytherin pressed down too hard as an unwelcome thought entered his mind.
“I thought I just did?” Malfoy said amusedly.  Ron twitched slightly as the Slytherin put a hand on Harry’s back and guided him out of the way of a Ravenclaw group giggling past them towards the section cornered off as the dance floor.
He saw Malfoy look at him from the corner of his eye.  “Famous Gryffindor bravery giving up at last?”
But Lest hadn’t killed Qye’s relatives.  She knew he didn’t lie to her, could see it in his eyes and could tell from the hurt when she had indirectly accused him.  So Qye’s relatives had to be alive.  Hélène only knew their condition while alive, but still alive.  And Harry’s relatives were dead.
He stood there for a moment, blinking around at everyone.  Everyone was staring at him and he shifted nervously on the spot.  He didn't feel anything except the pulse.
Harry fought back a grin as he looked up at the intensely interested Seamus.  Draco turned to the dance floor, interrupted in the conversation they had been having about the Thestral from their project before the Gryffindors joined them.  Ron sighed across the table where he had been dodging Hermione’s persistent questions about his deal with Draco while also awkwardly trying to compliment her.
“What are you talking about?” Harry asked, baffled.  Behind him, Ron could see Seamus goggling at him with Dean and a few other Gryffindors giving Harry an impressed look.
,’ Vernon thought disgustedly, glaring at the person in front of him who topped him by more than a few inches.
Jonas watched, fascinated as her eyes flickered beneath her pale eyelids.  She opened them, tilted her head and moved over to the other body and repeated the procedure, the same way she had every day before.
’ he pondered, looking at the black horse.  He cautiously reached out to stroke the muzzle of the horse, wondering if he was untouched because he was violent.  That didn’t seem to be the case though because the small winged creature immediately began to nuzzle his hand, its large eyes expressing its joy at being touched.  Harry smiled and offered a sugar cube, which was immediately licked eagerly by the small horse.
“Hélène,” he heard someone breathe out and he looked to the doorway to see Nilsson standing shocked.  He straightened up and opened his mouth but she was gone before he could call out her name.
"Harry - " she began, still not reassured.  Fortunately, Ron cut in before she could question him more.
The pictures were missing from the walls.  The rugs, the vases, the carpet – which Harry had heard had been heavily streaked with blood - were all gone.  One of the Aurors of his escort had muttered how he didn’t want to go into the house again after seeing the carpet, not noticing Harry had been standing behind him.  The other Auror had nudged the muttering Auror, jerking her head to him staring.  The Auror stopped muttering and had flushed, looking away from him.  Harry hadn’t said anything.
:: grumbled the teenager as he coughed a bit more. Groaning, he slowly sat up, his left hand clutching his head.
“Actually, yes, please,” Wainscott nodded.  Qye stared at her as Harry leaned back in confusion.  “I have Healer Smethwyck’s notes about what contributed to your physical separation and I would very much like to hear your description of it in your own words.”
Harry sighed exasperatedly as he examined the book.  The author was Kassidy Takian and it looked barely used.  The pages were still newly stiff as he turned them back and forth before settling back on the page that had the word.
Why was he even answering?  Why was he keeping up this charade that the voice was anyone other than himself?
“Threstrals,” Hermione said enviously as they walked from Hagrid’s hut to the Great Hall.  “Oh, I bet they’re fascinating creatures.  So little is known about them, given the circumstances.  You’re so lucky, Harry.”
“What?” he hissed slightly as he turned back to his potion, stirring it counter-clockwise.  He heard Malfoy sigh.
’ She continued to stare at the door.  That could perhaps explain the tingle, the only reaction she had to him.  She closed her eyes.  It wasn’t as if she would recognize him by sight anymore.  Not since Lest’s decision.
He took a deep breath and tried to calm himself. This vampire seemed to be a never-ending source of problems for him since the moment they'd met and his desire to see him bested grew more.
“Carus Noctivagus,” Verna suddenly said.  Jordan blinked and looked at the Elder.  She was looking at his cousin, an amused expression in her eyes.  “Is that not right, child?”
you can drop the root," Malfoy said irritably, turning to look at him.  He dropped the root in obediently and watched his potion turn sea green.
Over the year, several students had gathered the courage to give small things to the new teacher, their liking increasing their giving nature. Adding to the small items Professor Opacre had collected herself as she interacted with the wizarding world - a wizarding chess piece, a few pieces of jewelry, some Knuts and Sickles and Galleons, a tiny Sneakoscope - there was quite a collection.
“Remember to come back to me if you feel anything different and remember to eat some chocolate,” she said, eyeing him with critically.
Something slammed again and he whimpered, shutting his eyes and dropping his head to his knees, his fingers tightening in his hair, desperate to distract himself from the searing pain in his head. In the distance, he heard someone cry out in shock, in fear, and felt a hand fall onto his shoulder, voices shouting, noise elevating, feet pounding on the stony floor, steps growing faint, steps growing loud…
“I just don’t see why we couldn’t have taken them to St. Mungo’s,” Fudge mumbled as he jammed the bowler hat back on his head.  “All this damn secrecy and…and this!  Once word gets out of what’s happened - ”
He tried to hold onto them, tried to keep the pieces together but it was all breaking up so quickly, so largely.  In the far off distance, he could hear someone shouting for help, someone holding onto him as he collapsed, twitching and convulsing.
“Aw, cuz it’s fun to pat ickle Harrykins,” the redhead grinned as he patted Harry on the head.  Harry blushed even more and swiped at the offending hand.
He followed his best friends, hands in his pockets, watching as Hermione took the lead and began lecturing the poor first years while Ron glowered at his twin brothers who were making jokes about him.  Just before he exited the Great Hall however, he turned around to take one last look at Professor Opacre.  She was standing up and talking quietly to the Headmaster, looking very serious about something.  He looked at her for a moment.
Harry turned to Ron but before anything he could say anything, a familiar voice murmured in his ear.
“Where the hell are you today, Potter?” Malfoy snarled as he turned to the bespectacled boy after making sure the potion was stable enough.
“What’s the meaning of this, Dumbledore?” a cold voice broke through and Harry lifted his head slightly to see Lest Opacre push forward from the crowd, icy and radiating the feeling of –
It was too late now.  At least the vampire woman had always been kind to him, he figured there wouldn’t be much lasting embarrassment. He took another deep breath and continued, “Also I…I have a date.  Tomorrow.”  He firmly ignored the blush fixed on his cheeks.
The blond’s eyes widened and he turned his eyes over to him, the gray eyes sharply looking at him.  Harry said nothing, just meeting the stormy eyes of the Slytherin calmly, his hand tightening over the other’s.  Malfoy was silent, his eyes searching Harry’s.  Finally, after a long moment of just looking at each other, the blond sighed reluctantly.
Ron Weasley, his best friend since their first train ride to Hogwarts, was grumbling as he struggled to pull up the hood to his hand-me-down cloak but Harry could see him shooting worried looks at him in between tugs.  Next to him stood their best friend, Hermione Granger, who already had her hood up and was looking anxiously at him.
Harry dodged another curse from Wormtail – because it had to be Wormtail with his silver hand and how it enraged him, him and Qye, as he woke up bound and confused and found a wand aimed at him, held by the man who betrayed James and Lily Potter and sent Sirius Black to Azkaban – and tried to grab his wand from where the Death Eater had tucked it in his robe.
Sliding his hands in the pockets of his loose gray slacks, he gave one last lingering look at the slumbering boy before turning around to bid his retreat.
“You lot haven’t changed much have you?” the man asked softly, looking at them beneath his hood.  “I would have thought five years might have done something but you’re still these pathetic, sniveling, scum shit that you were before.”  Than man was silent for a moment.  “Not for your sake,” he continued, still using his soft voice, “But I really hope you’ve changed in some things.”
"Well, it doesn't matter," she continued, clearing her throat. She drew her wrist up in front of her so everyone could see the stone twirling on its thin chain, the light of the room bouncing off the brown and yellow. "I suppose I should start at the beginning," she mused. "Well, the beginning as we accept it.
Ron rolled his eyes and tugged fruitlessly at the red blankets once again.  “If I have to get up this early, then so do you, mate,” he growled, struggling to pull the covers from his friend’s bed.  For such a small boy, Harry sure had a lot of strength.
Harry snorted and kicked at the thin grass at their feet.  “Right.  And since when does the great Draco Malfoy want a date with me?”  He gave the blond a look of his own.  “And don’t dodge this, I’m actually asking.”
“I told him to trust you!” Qye howled and Harry fought desperately, cracking open his eyes, wincing at the light and subsequent ache.  “I believed you, you bloody leech!”
He blinked at his captured hand, confused.  Glancing up, he found the vampire studying him with a detached look upon his face.  He licked his dry lips and grew more uncomfortable when the dark blue eyes focused on them.
Later that night, Harry watched the stars from his bed, exhaustion making his eyes heavy.  He would have liked nothing more than to go to sleep that instant but he was still awake, listening to Ron and Neville’s snores.
“I wanted to show my brother around the castle,” the vampire woman replied irritably.  “For some unfathomable reason, the Headmaster suggested I take him to visit your classroom and so here we are.  Will you let us in now?”
“I can’t imagine it would be that hard!” an unfamiliar voice roared and he hesitated, wary and careful, but still wanting so badly to rush forward.
“Tomorrow,” Smethwyck said loudly and he felt the Healer’s hand drop on his shoulder, seeing the other on Harry’s.  “This discussion can go all night and longer I know but these two - ” he felt a slight squeeze “ – cannot and they’re going straight to bed.”
“Bloody weather,” Ron muttered, shaking the rainwater off his cloak.  “Why does it always seem to bloody rain when we return to Hogwarts?”
Throughout the entire class, he hadn’t asked one question or said one word although his friends had raised their hands at least once.  She had been subtly watching him the entire lesson and whenever someone asked her a question, a strange look appeared in his eyes.  He partly opened his mouth as if to say something but then he shook his head slightly and closed it again.  It had happened almost every single time and she made a careful note of it.
“Krista,” Marylin said coldly and Jordan moved slightly closer to his twin.  “Do not make statements like that again.  I will be seeing that you are never a representative again as you do not seem capable for the job.”  Krista looked down, red faced and ashamed.
The female vampire's eyebrows shot up, understanding sweeping her face. "Oh," she chuckled, finally dropping her arm back to her side. "No, nothing like that. How to explain this..."
Jonas had wisely stayed silent when the Pater Nosferatu made his announcement about the bond he shared with his patient, staring down at the case file in his hands.  It was only after Dumbledore had made Black settle down – and how Jonas wished he had asked Poppy for a batch of Calming Draught, if not for Black then for himself – and  given Jonas an encouraging nod that he began his spiel, all the while his mind kept track of the time, his duties as Healer ever present.
Marylin flinched.  “I…what happened was a rare occurrence.”  She threw her own harsh look at her brother.  “And not something to be repeated.”
“You know, I didn’t even really think about it,” he said, fiddling with the bracelet around his wrist.  “Not really.  You know I liked Cho last year but I can barely remember how that felt like and I’m not even interested in trying.  And I don’t know why him.  All the misery he’s put us through and all the fights. Even when we started at the beginning of the year, it was still hard.  I’m not blind or forgetful, I remember all the things he’s said and done.  But,” he said as he looked down at the ground, “it’s kind of hard to hold onto that after the summer.  When there are other things to think about.”
:: Qye began and the teenager began to worry at the unsure and reluctant tone in Qye’s voice, something he had never heard before. ::
He tugged at his hair just to feel sensation, feel a tug and knew it was on his body, not Harry’s.  He took another deep breath and opened his eyes, staring down at his hand still gripping Harry’s arm tightly.
“We’re Nosle Kids,” the young male vampire said as Reya charged forward and the two groups of vampires began to fight.
“Be that as it may,” Remus said tightly and Sirius was glad his friend’s restraint was slowly loosening, “Harry has been at Hogwarts for five years now.  And,” he exhaled a long breath, “as unfortunate as it may be, he has made several appearances in the Hospital Wing.  How is it that in all this time, not once, was there any note of…” Here Remus trailed off, frowning as he uncurled a fist and made a rough motion to the lounging vampire.
A young man jerked his head around, startled, Qye faintly registering the pointed canines in his slack jawed expression.
He wondered if he should speak up and point out the obvious stupidity of allowing those two to fight.
“Ms. Nilsson is offering support with the things the Healer cannot understand,” Marylin broke in, trying so hard to broker peace and Sirius wanted none of it.
“Harry?” Hermione questioned softly, looking at him when didn’t say anything.  “Harry, are you all right?”
He snorted and stood up, holding out his elbow for Hermione to loop her arm around.  “Right.  We better go check that they haven’t bloodied each other yet, bizarre truce or not.”
“You’re going to be here,” Remus said, voice as steady as the gaze he fixed on wild black eyes.  “You have to go tomorrow and do this because you know it’s the only way you can make sure you’re always going to be here.  And you know that’s what’s going to matter most.”
She curiously looked at him as he opened the envelope and blinked when he paused in unfolding the actual letter.
Harry looked away from the vampire as the blue eyes turned to obviously look at his own green ones.  With his now-freed hand - which shook slightly - he grabbed the next ingredient and tossed it into the potion, grasping the ladle and stirring the potion furiously.  The vampire continued to stand next to him and Harry determinedly kept his eyes away from the blue-eyed man.  ‘
Hermione also came up and tried to make Harry talk but Ron had shaken his head at her.  Harry was grateful that Ron had figured out that he didn’t want to talk about it but Hermione hadn’t looked too pleased as she closed her mouth.  She didn’t stop her mothering though, even though she couldn’t make him talk.  His bushy-haired friend forced him to go to dinner despite his lack of appetite.
Sirius dropped his gaze and caught sight of a slight trickle of blood in Remus’ fist lying between them.
His fingers tightened in his hair and he gritted his teeth as he felt another wave of rage course over him.
Qye looked up and a small mirror reflected his lost eyes, his gaunt cheeks, his pale lips pulled back to reveal painfully gritted teeth.
He tilted his head over his shoulder as he felt a faint touch on his back, seeing Draco nod over to one of the less crowded exits.
pierced his robes, the force of it pushing him down as his Auror guards started yelling and then gurgling.
It was a young man, only a few years older with red-brown hair and black eyes that looked calmly at him.
who only thinks about feeding and killing, I can control my hunger.  If the animal blood stops sustaining me, I do not immediately go looking for the nearest human to satisfy my hunger.  I can hold it long enough to get to my rooms and drink some blood that was
Marylin squeezed her nails into the palms of her hand, breathing shallowly as Lest turned so still next to her.
“We haven’t taken any more damn potions,” Qye dismissed, waving a hand.  “Well, besides that gunk Pomfrey keeps shoving down our throats.”
“And I’ll make sure to point out who started it,” the vampire said coldly.  Glancing up, Harry saw Professor Opacre shoot Draco a furious look, to which the Slytherin responded with one of his own.
“Don’t,” Draco said in a low voice, his eyes burning into Harry’s.  “I can easily slip back into my role of being an asshole, fighting and squabbling over the littlest of things.”  The hand that still grasped Harry’s arm tightened before letting go and falling to his side.  “I had rather thought you might have matured a little and would like the ceasefire, considering your situation.  But I’ll be the little nuisance if it’ll make you feel better.”  Draco tilted his head, his eyes cool.  “Is that what you want?”
The wall shifted.  He jerked his hand away and looked at the wall that his hand had rested on.  Blinking, he saw that his hand had broken into the wall.  Furrowing his brow, he moved closer.  No, he hadn’t broken it.  A piece of the wall had moved, showing a little hiding spot behind it.  He moved the panel more and peered inside.
Pre AN: Bloody hell, Lest...that's all I got to say. But then again, I’ve been saying that for years.  --; Harry and Qye, finally, find out the truth (at least, some of it).
He instinctively raised his arm, shouting as its mouth clamped down hard, breaking his skin.  He felt flecks of his blood splash across his face, wincing as the beast bit –
“'Mione, enough,” Ron interrupted, finally stopping in his glaring of the corner and looking exasperatedly at the bushy-haired girl.  “You’re scaring him.”  The redhead grinned at Harry while Hermione scowled at him.  “Have a good holiday, mate?”
"Selene gave light so that humans would not live in constant fear of the darkness, unable to discern what lay within it." A small, wry smile graced the vampire's lips. She shook her head slightly and continued. "Helene decided to give the precious stones to the humans, the stones that were the beauty of the Moon. The stones fell to the Earth and the humans ran to the falling rocks to embrace the gift of the Goddess. All were ignorant of the different ways of the Moon and Earth, particularity gravity's ways.
“I suppose that would be okay,” Hermione said hesitantly. “Harry’s by the lake and I guess he wouldn’t mind - ”
“No,” Wainscott answered calmly, putting her notebook down on her lap.  Even upside down, Qye could read ‘
“How do you think it’s going?” Marylin murmured as she looked down at her long since grown cold tea.
“Mr. Weasley and Ms. Granger sent a letter to Lupin and Snuffles yesterday,” Dumbledore said suddenly, his voice light but eyes still searching.
Qye knew him and though his face didn’t change he saw the slight swallow of his throat, the way the corners of Lest’s eyes tightened, how his neck stiffened.
“Well, I can understand that too,” Malfoy drawled, crossing his arms and leaning sideways on the same wall as him.  The taller boy smirked down – Harry’s eyebrow twitched a bit at this – at him.
Blinking again, Harry turned his head to the side and focused tired, fever-bright eyes on the blurred form of Madam Pomfrey.
“You were only meant to go to the library and back,” Snape said sharply and Remus blinked as Draco grimaced and looked away.  “I hope you haven’t made any unplanned detours.”  The Slytherin said nothing and Snape made a noise of disgust.
Harry expressed further language and rolled over on his side, smothering his pillow over his head as Qye laughed.
“Voldemort…he…” Harry swallowed and swayed slightly as he sat on the hard, freezing floor. “He…there was this man…he was wearing Muggle clothing…they…these two things…” Harry shivered and brought his knees up, laying his head down on them, his hands gripping his hair. He felt Dumbledore lay a comforting hand on his shoulder as the memory came back to him.
Qye muttered in the back of Harry’s mind, seeming to come back to himself. The presence of Professor Opacre seemed to soothe him and Harry could feel him begin to relax.
Leaning against one of the drooping trees, hidden by the shadows cast by its long branches, Lest’s eyes burned.
“If this is how you’re planning to support, Black, I really don’t see any so-called progress to be made,” came Lest’s chilly voice and Qye closed his eyes, familiar anger seeping back into him.
“I’ve nothing to say to you,” Malfoy interrupted flatly and Remus watched as Marylin took a deep breath, smile fading away.
“Well?” the taller boy finally snapped after a moment of silence. “Am I expected to stir for the Golden Boy now as well as be his personal reminder?”
“Yes, Professor Opacre?” Padma asked curiously.  Marylin grinned at them, a little sparkle fluttering around inside her.
He contemplated for a long moment about letting this go on.  But then he caught Malfoy’s gaze and saw it flicker towards the doorway.  He followed it and inwardly sighed.
There was silence for a long while and then he heard a ragged sob.  It was choked back but came softly again.
The dark blue hood fell down to reveal a smiling, pale face framed with golden hair that framed her face.  People looked curiously at her and she smiled a bit more revealing her teeth.
:: Qye asked oddly, looking out of Harry’s eyes to stare at the Irish boy as well.  Harry mentally shrugged.
"You'll be making a type of self-enhancing potion today," he snapped.  Obviously, he wasn't in a very good mood and Harry pondered for only a moment about what was bothering him before turning his attention back on hand.
“That’s it!” Hagrid shouted, looking beyond pleased.  “’Ere, some of ‘em like sugar cubes and carrots.  Makes ‘em real friend-like.”  Each student took a couple of sugar cubes and carrots and for possibly the first time in Care of Magical Creatures, the students were having fun.
“Fine,” Harry mumbled, looking up at the other boys while wincing as he felt his head.  There was going to be a bruise on it later, he was sure.
A sudden motion brought him back from his thoughts – and drove the Libidates away again – and he looked down to see
Seamus grinned and grasped his hand, laughing as he stood up. Harry felt the tension fade away as everyone laughed, a few tossing in their own half-hearted apologies. Harry grinned and sat down with Ron and Hermione, dropping his bag on the floor and not even attempting to control Hermione's serving to his own plate.
“But it removes a memory,” Ron frowned as Harry kept his eyes on the page so that Qye could review it as well.  “How can that not screw up a person’s head?”
It was his turn to be silent.  He stared at the Headmaster for a long moment, everything in him numb.  The Dursleys…his only living blood family as far as he knew…the people who mistreated him his entire life and whom he hated…
His hands clenched slightly, once again reaching out for that other part in his mind that represented the other boy in his head. And he sighed when he once again felt that flicker and unconscious rejection. Still, that refusal was better than the lack of reaction he had yesterday.
“Who’s Dumbledore?” Krista asked and Jordan shared a slightly relieved look with his brother.  It looked like they weren’t the only ones who didn’t know who this Dumbledore was.
Blinking, Harry raised his eyes from the parchment to find the pale boy looking at him with his lips quirked up into a half-smirk.
Marylin came as close as she ever did to a sneer.  “For how long?” she said, eyes flashing.  “In case you’ve forgotten, they outnumber us, ten wizards for every vampire.  And let us not forget their various ways of concealment, both in mind and body.  Oh, and the potions they brew and - ”
Getting sick on a Monday morning following a vampire’s arrival after never getting sick for four years at Hogwarts was surely an omen of bad things to come. Really.
“No, he’s just very observant,” Harry sighed, finally dropping his arm and opening his eyes as Smethwyck turned to look at him.  “He hasn’t figured out anything about the telepathy yet, just as he hasn’t figured out how to stop his telekinesis from breaking things.”
He looked over and swallowed as he realized Blaise might have had a point, their exits blocked and the vampires steady on.
Lest watched the beast died, a vicious primal instinct in him sated as he shredded the remnants of its mind before the body expired from the blood protection.  And then he felt the cold pit in his stomach as he turned back to his enemy.
Harry stared as his plate filled up with bacon, eggs and toast, swallowing something back that tasted as bad as the smell of the food was making him feel. Funny…he
Hermione's hand tightened on his arm even as the other students continued to voice their enthusiasm and support.
to avoid the flare of fire from Ron's wand. He heard his classmates exclaim - not even bothering to hide their excitement - at finally seeing
“Oh, I’m hurt, Potter,” Malfoy drawled out and he looked up, startled.  He blinked in confusion and the blond smirked.  “Does that mean you don’t love me anymore?”
“Technically,” Smethwyck said delicately, “you are still a ward of the Ministry.  They decide your treatment. But if I might make a suggestion.”  He opened his case file and looked at his notes.  “As I was saying earlier, I have a colleague who specializes in mind-healing, specifically in unorthodox cases. I’m not saying,” he continued, raising a hand against a growling protest from Qye, “that I am committing to any plan of treatment at the moment.  But I think we can all agree that these are not usual circumstances and I believe it would be beneficial to bring her onto the team to conduct an evaluation of their mental states and go from there.”  He looked around at the adults and frowned as he saw their uneasy expressions.  “Once again, none of you are technically currently in charge of treatment but I know it would be remiss of me to not take into account that all of you are in some way a factor in whatever happens moving forward.”  He rubbed at his temple, eyeing them with weariness.  “I assume we can all agree that we want what’s best?”
“Hello then,” Wainscott said peacefully, moving past Smethwyck and sitting down on the couch across from them.   His eyes followed her hand as she placed a file on the table between them, the corner of his eye twitching as he saw the label.
Qye rolled his eyes and fell back on his back as the Healer repeated the same explanation he had the first time they had to take the array of potions.  At least they were weaning down to only every six-hour doses instead of the hour ones they had started with at the beginning.
Wainscott stood from her seat, carefully closing her notebook while Harry rubbed his eyes beneath his glasses.  He tensed as he remembered what Smethwyck said about that persistent tiredness that followed the teenager still.
“Looks like this won’t be so easy after all, will it?” Dazain said, slowly twisting his sapphire Gemmus in his hand.
Sirius said nothing, breathing in deep and glaring hard, sharp pricks of pain growing in his hands as he fought the urge to leap for the vampire.
He sighed as he watched her open and firmly close the door behind her, briefly catching sight of the guard that was always present, this time the quiet young man with a short spear strapped to his back.
On the other side of the dance crowd, he saw Professor Opacre and her brother standing with a group of witches and wizards, gesturing as she talked with them.  Some of them were carefully keeping their distance while others were gesturing back animatedly, faces varied in emotion towards the vampires.
:: the voice repeated, surprised.  It didn’t seem to be affected by Harry’s anger and fear, ignoring the emotions completely.  ::
“Why so interested, Opacre?” Dazain inquired, his head tilting slightly, brown bangs brushing his sleepy black eyes.  Marylin flinched and avoided the idle gaze, careful not to give any advantage to the man.  Despite being only a couple of years younger than her, she knew all too well his telepathic strength that rivaled her brother’s.
for her liking.  Immediately, the bushy-haired Gryffindor turned her annoyed attention on the redhead, who shot a grin to Harry.  Harry grinned back, silently expressing his gratitude.
Professor McGonagall went in front of the Head Table and put the Sorting Hat on the stool already set up.  As the Sorting Hat gave its song and began to Sort the students, Harry wondered how he could have failed to realize that the Sorting had not taken place yet.  He shrugged and returned his attention to the Sorting in time to see “Nadin, Raphael!” become Ravenclaw.
Harry gave him a faint smile, dropping his hand and taking a step back.  “Didn’t realize you were taking Hermione’s role of feeding me here, Ron.”
“Well, you can’t deny they drink blood Hermione,” Dean said, raising an eyebrow.  “Isn’t that part of the definition of being a vampire?  That you have to drink blood?”
“Oh, sure, he gets respect,” he heard the woman grumble as he blinked rapidly, taking in Draco’s easy use of Harry’s name and the hint of something besides animosity when he said it.
She smiled, holding up a couple of books in her hands.  “Just checking out some books I think my brother would like to read while he’s here,” she said cheerfully.  Harry’s eyes widened and he felt some of his shock shared by Qye.
“Explain, Jeaneyl,” his cousin said.  Jordan was oddly relieved to hear it revert to its cold tone again.  He didn’t think his twin would like it if something happened to Krista.
Harry’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully as Professor Opacre set about mussing his hair with liquid from the bottle.
As much as his training was yelling at him to start firing off diagnostic spells, the instincts that made him respected at St. Mungo’s and had him called upon for the case in the first place told him he needed to get the young man to talk to him before anything else.
“I’ll speak with you later, Draco,” the blonde woman said, gritting her teeth.  Draco scowled, his dark eyes burning into hers.  The vampire met his gaze coolly and after a few moments, he dropped his eyes, glaring fiercely at the floor.  Opacre nodded satisfactorily.
:: he mumbled in his head, slightly wary now.  Whatever had happened to him, it was obviously something magical so whoever this person was had to be as well.  And the last thing he needed right now was some raving fan stuck in his head for who knew how long.
As he looked up at the board to check for this next step, he saw Snape looking nastily at him.  He froze, then sighed and wearily looked at the next step.
“Excuse you,” Draco said indignantly, straightening up in his seat.  Harry hid his smile behind a hand as he coughed, apparently not too well judging by the frown the blond gave him.
Harry raised an eyebrow at Ron.  “I didn’t realize your birth name was Harry,” he said quietly, his dull green eyes beginning to liven a bit with amusement.  “I’ll make sure to remember that next time someone calls for Harry.”  Ron just grinned.
They felt like water and he grimaced as he made himself straighten up without support and look around.
“No,” Ron broke in, giving her his own flat look.  “No,” he repeated, this time to Malfoy as he and Harry joined them.  “I didn’t…this wasn’t what…damn it all, Malfoy, what the hell, this wasn’t part of the deal!”
Harry shifted in the bed, feeling exhaustion beginning to arise once again in him.  He shoved it away, forcing himself to stay awake.  He had promised to tell the other boy.
"It's not the same thing," he replied stiffly, straightening from his slouch. He put down the make-shift pouch - ice brought by house-elf and her handkerchief - and gingerly touched the colored skin.
Draco’s arms wrapped around him and pulled him back, kissing him just as roughly.  He answered back, every harsh press met with a nip at the lips, every breathless sound chased after, holding onto the warmth and solidness of their bodies together.  There was a faint taste of chocolate and something he distantly recognized as just Draco, something warm and heated and still inviting.
“Knowing that, I think you two can go back to the Tower now,” McGonagall said firmly. Hermione and Ron opened their mouths to protest but the Deputy Headmistress gave them a stern look and they closed them reluctantly.
:: Qye asked worriedly, his voice trembling. Harry shivered and he heard the distressed boy call his name again and again. It was so much, pushing down on him and he shook with it all and –
He froze, then inwardly sighed and cursed Murphy’s Law as he dropped his hands. Maybe he could still pretend –
“Not exactly,” she said reluctantly.  Jordan knew that a gang of Dazain vampires had been the cause of her husband’s death and wasn’t surprised that she was being reluctant.  She probably wanted to drag out the war against the Dazains as long as possible for revenge.  “It’s true that most of the Dazain vampires are either in capture and awaiting execution or they’re already dead.  But - ”
“I see we’re still catching up on our necessary sleep,” Smethwyck said and Qye propped himself on his elbows as he watched the Healer make his way to the doorway.  “I would suggest both of you take advantage and rest well.  Mind-Healer Wainscott will arrive early tomorrow morning and promptly begin your evaluation.  Madam Pomfrey will make her rounds later tonight, make sure to let her know if you need anything to help get sleep tonight.”  He stopped by the doorway and glanced once more towards Harry’s bed.  “Dreamless Sleep is still on the restricted list for both of you but she has access to a melatonin tonic that should help.”
“Good morning, Headmaster,” Qye said calmly, inwardly cursing every curse he knew and shouting at every deity. “How are you?”
“Like we’ll believe you, Malfoy,” Ron sneered, moving to stand between the Slytherin and the other two Gryffindors.  The blond shrugged.
“Oi, mate!” Seamus said in alarm, holding onto the arm that held the Sneakoscope, his Irish accent thick in his worry.  “Harry, careful now!”
“The crying faces you drew,” Libby answered dryly as she took the case file from him.  “Jonas, you’re one of the best Healers I’ve ever met and you can’t draw for shit.”
She looked back down.  Flashes of the two teenagers ran through her mind, the way Qye screamed with pain and betrayal etched into his face, how quickly Harry had collapsed after stopping the fate Lest weakly resisted.
“You’re still recommending having sessions with them, though,” Lupin broke in, his voice even as he looked up, concerned.
The Harry Potter that came to Hogwarts, befriended a man who others pulled back from because of his appearance, made the choice to be a Gryffindor, cherished the friendships of Ron and Hermione and the people in his House, took up his courage and went on a date with…
:: Harry growled but before he could continue berating the other boy, a loud laugh interrupted him.  Blinking, he looked up to see a widely grinning Seamus.  He furrowed his brows in bewilderment at the Irish boy.
“I’ll be seeing you lot,” she said merrily, her light eyes twinkling as she turned and linked arms with her brother, walking towards the table.
Draco dropped his hand, an unconvinced look in his eyes. Harry couldn’t stifle his sigh of disappointment and the Slytherin’s smirk deepened, causing Harry’s blush to deepen as well. The amused expression disappeared as a stern one took its place.
Harry didn’t bother to say anything to Qye’s amused and smug emotions as he packed up, soft butterflies in his stomach he firmly attributed to his sickness and that strange warm sensation in his chest he was sure came from the heat. He honestly didn’t know if he had the right to say anything, or even if he wanted to.
Marylin patted the teenager on the shoulder.  “Unfortunately, Lest is quite taken.  Has been for some while.  And for most vampires, it is a very serious thing.”
Qye said absently. Harry started, almost forgetting about the boy in his surprise and unease of Professor Opacre's pronouncement.
“No,” Lest bit out and Marylin sighed as he pushed past her, moving quickly through the crowd and out the door before the girls could say anything.
"As to how strong we are, that depends on two things: how well we resonate with our jewel and how well we did in our Maturation.
“Any news, Moony?” he asked, looking back down as he crossed off another town they had investigated yesterday.  Remus casually inquired about possible work and spoke with people about other newcomers while Sirius kept circling around, trying to pinpoint their lead.  He remained undercover as a lone stray, sniffing out the mysterious musty scent they had discovered from one of the Death Eaters they had captured and left for the Aurors, Mad-Eye Moody concealing their traces as Shacklebolt made connections.  It had led them all over the country, to typically larger and more Muggle oriented cities to their surprise.
“All the more reason to try, Harry!” she said brightly, finally plopping him down on the chair and looming ominously with the silver eyeliner.  “You’re sure to get people to notice you and if you’ll just let me add a little more, I know you’ll have a ton of dates in no time to - ”
“Take as long as you want,” the Auror said, standing guard outside of Number Four, Privet Drive.  Four more were stationed all around the house, dressed in the uniform of Muggle police.  They had been assigned to guard him in case the murders were just a trap.  They hadn’t said anything from the trip from Hogwarts to here, instead keeping a respectful silence.  But Harry hadn’t minded the silence.  “Call me if you need me,” the Auror added as Harry ducked under the yellow tape that covered the door.
,’ he thought as his twin stood up, being the oldest of the two by five minutes and therefore eldest of their family present.  ‘
“Who the hell are you?” Sirius demanded, glaring after the vampire.  She looked over her shoulder and gave him a weak smile but said nothing else.
For instance, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Professor Opacre…despite that he had already spent almost two months in her presence, he still couldn’t figure her out.  In class, she was this semi-professional woman who taught them with an easy-going and joking manner.  Since she was a vampire, she couldn’t exactly teach them real magic but she spent a great of time on the theory of a spell.  She spent at least two days on the theory of the spell, for them to grasp the concept.  Then she assigned them the reading of the spell in the textbook.  It seemed she hadn’t been lying when she had told them that they would be using their books a lot.  By the end of the week, or when she deemed them fit enough to practice, she partnered them up and spent an entire lesson watching them practice the spell.
“Harry James Potter, is the reason you’ve been so secretive this year because you thought Ron and I would be upset with you for liking men, specifically Draco Malfoy?” Hermione asked as she placed her hands on her hips and gave him a stern look.
She saw Harry go still, a strange expression crossing his face as though seeing the wizard in front of him for the first time.  His gaze seem to alternate between focused and distant and she couldn’t check his emotions, his thoughts, for fear of leaving an opening for telepathic assault.
“That’s up for debate if you don’t hold the rest back,” Draco said coolly, tilting his head over to where the rest of their Slytherin housemates lounged by the bar area, eyeing their group.  Harry saw Pansy Parkinson scowling, surrounded by her friends, before the crowd moved again and blocked their view.
“Now,” Dumbledore said quietly, blue eyes still twinkling.  “I think you are all quite wondering who your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is going to be.  In an effort to unite all the magical creatures and people, we have an ambassador who will be staying with us this year.  I would like all of you to show her the same respect and courtesy that you would should any member of this staff and anyone who does not will be dealt with that according.”  He turned to his right and the hooded figure stood up, lifting pale hands to push down the hood.
He shivered and dropped his hands from his face, wrapping his arms tightly around his middle.  “Who?” he asked quietly, his eyes tightly closed.
“Hopefully not bringing any problems here!” the old witch huffed, glowering at him with her mouth twisted as the other passengers avoided them.  “Goodness we’ve had enough, we don’t need more people like you disrupting what little peace we have!  Have you no consideration at all?”
“A lot of people came and visited you while you were unconscious,” she said, smiling slightly.  “I think you should send some letters to Mr. Weasley and Ms. Granger when you have time soon.  They were quite worried about you.”
“That didn’t happen to me,” Qye bit out, pushing down the thought of memories of his mother that he never got to see, so caught up in learning about the wizarding world and then trying to find answers and ignoring everything else.  “And we aren’t arguing that we weren’t the same person for a while.  We just aren’t now.”
He stopped as Smethwyck pulled out his wand and carefully kept it at his side, meeting the vampire’s eyes unflinchingly.
“Hey guys,” he said, smiling weakly at them as he tried to not collapse into his chair. His smile didn’t seem to help as the redhead and brunette kept their frowns.
:: he asked, bewildered as he stared at the blue vase and flowers on top of the drawer next to the bed he was lying on.  ::
She hugged him back before gently distangling, her eyes bright as she wound one of her arms with his.
next to the lake but it quickly faded as he read the rest of the name, a puzzled look appearing on his face.
' he thought as he stared at his potion which, although it was slightly right, it was still slightly wrong.
"You would be," Ron muttered, slouching in his chair and taking a bite out of his pie.  "Only you would enjoy someone ruining your break."  Hermione shot him a dirty look and Harry watched them amusedly as he took a sip of his drink.
Qye mumbled and Harry watched as Lest narrowed his eyes, mostly in response to his own flashing green.
From an archway from the school, Marylin saw Draco Malfoy step forward, bloodied and panting, wand raised as the one who shot the spell, his face pale but hand steady.
The windows shook and the bookshelves rattled.  None of them acknowledged it, having grown used to ignoring the bursts of abrupt telekinesis Qye radiated after the end of the second day.
Okay, so maybe the fact that the normally cynical and sarcastic boy seemed so cheerful and happy might have also had a factor in tolerating this madness.
How did Harry get that name? And what had been all that about vampires and this Voldemort thing? Maybe it had something to do with that blackout.
:: he said, slinging his bag over his head.  As he walked away from his bed and towards the exit of the Infirmary, Madam Pomfrey popped out of her office.
“Stop!” he snapped.  He tried not to look directly at Lest, mindful of his burning stare and the fact that Qye still had not said anything.
::  There was a moment of silence, this time from the voice’s end, and Harry felt a slight flash of confusion from the other before it quickly vanished.  ::
Opacre was very mistaken if he thought he would stand by and let him indulge in his perversions on the green-eyed boy like he did with the others who threw themselves at him.
Ever since they met at King’s Cross, Hermione had been shooting him worried looks and probing at him, obviously trying to get him to talk.  He hadn’t sent many letters over the summer and she had obviously taken this as a sign that there was something
Ron grimaced and flicked his wand, banishing a few back, and Harry saw Lest flick his own hand in that familiar gesture. Ron's wand jerked out of his hand half way before he regained his grasp. In that small moment, a few trinkets aimed for his hand, to dislodge his grip, and his face, to distract. He managed to dodge them, his constantly shifting feet giving him extra time to move, and Harry exhaled in relief as he didn't lose his wand.
“What brought this all on?” he finally asked quietly, mind whirling and fixing his mind on one focus point that maybe he could understand and grasp, shifting his gaze from one to another.
“Qye has difficulties with trust and managing his anger,” Libby noted to the room as she watched the group absorb the information, each of them looking at the report with different expressions.  She took a moment to appreciate the Headmaster thoughtfully and methodically moving through each section, stroking his beard, wishing the rest had his quietude.  “His outbursts of anger have been reflected with the erratic use of telekinesis.  Let us also not forget that even with Harry’s exhaustion, Healer Smethwyck and Madam Pomfrey have documented the increase of strength and development of his magic over the week, as I’m sure you have all felt.  If we begin to suggest placing them in a restricted environment such as the ward – if we could even manage the logistics – even temporarily, I believe assisting them on managing their issues will be more difficult and likely less successful.”
became clear as Potter began groaning through that bloody mask, and Draco wanted nothing more than to rip it off entirely f so that he could unmistakably hear every moan of pleasure from the man as clear as day.
He had felt morose about it many times before. This time, however, he found himself wanting to grab Malfoy by the waist, push him against the wet, tiled wall, and kiss and lick every single one of those scars until the other man was writhing from his ministrations.
Or perhaps the class prior to them had brewed an Amortentia, and the residue fumes were catching up to him.
Harry frowned slightly, opening his mouth to argue before Molly came up from behind him and gave him a much nicer hug than Justin’s had been before scurrying back to the kitchen to finish up dinner, scolding Ron for touching every pan in sight with food on it.
"Um… what has this rug got to do with the house destroying all the Christmas decorations?" Harry asked.
“It looks like we have all the ingredients to create the potion now. If we meet in Slughorn’s office next week to create it, we will be done with the assignment early.”
Cho couldn’t be it either and thank Merlin for that. This year she skipped out on school, deciding to take up her uncle’s business and get on with a career of her own.
Harry barely noticed that Malfoy had forgotten to take his collection of soaps and conditioners back with him this time, and Harry could only assume he would be back again tomorrow. With a thrill at that tantalizing thought, Harry quickly left as well, after casting a quick cleaning charm on himself, then stood up on trembling legs and exited the narrow space for the night.
He truly appreciated McGonagall, but sometimes she really ground on his nerves. And with the way Ron was going on that morning at breakfast, his sentiments mirrored Harry’s own.
Before he could do much else, he couldn’t help but see Potter hadn’t finished. And if it was a thing Draco always made sure to do, was to ensure all his sexual partners are satisfied.
His eyes followed the loose-limbed man as he squeezed through his admirers to the bar, waiting patiently for a well-needed drink, by the looks of him.
He waited a good two seconds before opening the paper and felt his heart palpitating in his chest with what was written down, but more importantly, who wrote it.
Apparently satisfied, Malfoy backed up but watched Harry intently to make sure. “I don’t think you understand; I cannot have your death on my record. The Wizengamont would not be so forgiving the second go around, I’m afraid. Especially if I offed their Boy Wonder.”
Only, he had known Draco for so long now. After they dealt with their obvious tough past together—after one particular night consisting of firewhiskey and manly tears—they came out the other side realizing they had much more in common than they ever could have imagined, and had become the best of mates in the past few years.
He knew his boyfriend had a thing for the one from a few months ago that changed colors when they came (which Draco thought was weird, but whatever Harry liked, he got).
Harry groaned in approval as he sucked ever harder around the man, desperate for whatever he could give him.
“Ah yes, indeed.” Kreacher nodded again, this time slower and he looked close to tears as he spun his tale. “Kreacher tried desperately to stop Young Master from moving the ancient rug from its proper place, but Master doesn’t listen. He never listens.”
Frankly, all he wanted to do recently was lie in bed, watch the leaves fall outside his window, and listen as the words played around in his head, falling asleep to the soft melodies.
Harry somehow managed to snag his left hand before it could make it back inside the warmth, but his boyfriend’s hand was somehow even warmer than his fleece coat, which didn’t surprise him in the slightest.
But it looked like his eyes didn’t know where to go. One second they are staring at the ground, the next at Harry’s shoulder, his elbow. And at one point, Harry was sure he was staring at his arse.
He slapped him on his arse once more, relishing in the red mark left, and smirked down at the answering whine from his lover as he walked over to their closet and opened up the uppermost drawer where they kept their most prized possessions.
As his orgasm crested and trickled away, leaving only the familiar feelings of elation and serotonin, his eyes focused enough ahead of him to see the source of his outburst: Saint Potter. But this time, instead of his back toward him, he had turned around in his seat.
“Like, be together? Dating?” the Slytherin’s voice cracked on the last word, and Harry’s heart dropped into his stomach.
Look at you, such a slut for it, I should’ve known. Harry Potter, the cock-slut. Four fingers and you’re still here, begging for more.”
Malfoy held up a hand, and Harry breathed in deeply, not realizing how fast his heart had started pounding.
“I didn’t realize how kinky you were, Malfoy. Good to know, though, never know when that particular skill-set will prove useful out in the field.”
Before Harry could respond with a meager sigh, he was gone with his eager girlfriend, and Harry was left there to sit, alone, until Draco showed up after his tea with his mother.
He spent most of his time planning the mission ‘GTFB’ or ‘Get the Ferret Back’ as Seamus lovingly called it.
“So care to share with the class your research findings, Granger? On why I can’t kiss my boyfriend under the bloody mistletoe?!” Draco’s voice cracked a bit, and Hermione’s face turned a deeper red as she cleared her throat.
A new noise brought Harry out of his musings, as he watched as Malfoy ran a hand down his chest slowly, rubbing through the soapy water, on a clear path to its final destination, and Harry’s heart sped up.
Harry closed his eyes, images instantly filled his head; he groaned and opened his eyes, biting his lip in a desperate attempt to think of
Harry watched as the man’s right hand quickened over his wet cock, his eyes closed in pure pleasure.
“That’s not answering my question,” Draco replied with a sneer, his thumb circling the tip of his leaking prick, and Harry’s eyes rolled into the back of his head as his mouth went slack with the pleasure, and Draco wanted to frame him up somewhere so he could look at him anytime he wanted.
Harry then glanced up quickly back to his boyfriend, his brows furrowed. “No, I - I mean. I wouldn’t want you to want to leave me just because of the stupid mistakes I made and -”
That night, when Harry was about to sneak away to his new favorite secret spot, Ron was sitting down in the Common Room, his eyes immediately locking on the invisibility cloak in the other’s hands.
“Mate - this place is ace. I came here with Neville and Hannah just last week. I swear the bartenders here put somethin’ special in your drink that gives you that extra oomph to go on up there. You should’ve seen Neville mates, fuckin’ barmy bastard was goin’ all out on that stage. Singin’ one of those songs he found from that bloody phone music app thing Harry’s obsessed with.”
He felt more so than saw Draco freeze beside him. And Harry wanted nothing more than to cut out his tongue and glue it to his forehead. Maybe then he will finally learn to keep his mouth shut…
“It’s not my fault you are utterly inept at flirting. I was only stopping what was to be, I’m sure, a catastrophe. You should be thanking me.”
Malfoy heaved in a deep breath, his white teeth gleaming as he snarled at Harry. He looked like he was close to punching Harry in the face.
His right hand stopped as he ran his fingers lightly over a small groove in the wall further down, and Harry leaned down on his knees to look.
He immediately blushed from both the whine that came from the back of his throat and how much harder his cock got from the feeling of being held down magically. He had only done it to himself in the past, never allowing a lover or ex to do so to him.
“Fuck Harry - I always knew you’d be a slut for it. Just look at you.” He then forced the head of his cock against the back of Harry’s throat, and Harry whined at the feeling.
Draco could stare for the rest of eternity at him, but he only tightened his grip around Harry and waited for the inevitable, knowing this had to be the end.
Typically, this wasn’t Draco’s play at all. He always preferred for others to bring attention to uncomfortable truths in a conversation. But something about Potter has always made him so easy to bend his own rules.
He was too far away for Harry to see clearly, but he could tell he had to be well-seasoned if the muscles along his back were anything to go by.
He had fallen asleep with that plan in mind, but when he woke up, he found himself pretending to forget the little promise his old self made only six hours previously, as he got up and prepared for the day, feeling out of sorts and incredibly horny.
So, of course, Hermione would be all about this particular cause. Harry tucked in, wiggling around a bit in his spot on the ground, thankful for adding the bit of cushion before he joined in when he sucked in a sudden breath as he felt a hand grab his ankle.
A few more beats passed, and Harry took a few more deep breaths, obeying his boyfriend’s directives to a tee before he relaxed his body into the bed.
Not to mention Potter coming to speak at his trials, which was a whole other topic of conversation Draco hadn’t even brought up to Pansy, let alone Potter himself.
Harry came down in the same way he always did, holding onto Draco tightly, rubbing his stubbled jaw over Draco’s shaven one, keening still from Draco still pounding inside him.
Instead, he pushed further a few more times into Harry’s mouth, thighs shaking and cursing as he came for what seemed like ages, while his boyfriend swallowed and licked his come like a pro, moaning all the while like the good boy he was.
Draco must have taken his stumble as approval to continue, as he could most certainly hear the proceedings from the other side of the Floo, and ran his devilish hands further up his legs, rubbing right under his arse.
A loud crash sounded from the living room. They both jumped up from the table. Harry could just barely keep the tea-pot from slipping from his hands, when Kreacher appeared in the door.
You couldn’t call someone else on the magical phones unlike standard muggle phones, but they allowed the user to listen to music, for example.
He exhaled at a stopping point in his notes and had to re-read the last two words of the previous sentence to catch where he was.
And a sinking, sick feeling he knew exactly what was in that book she had been pushing up his arse to read all year suddenly made itself known. It added up together in his head all at once, and he desperately wanted to vomit. Or pass out.
. Harry mulled the different possible meanings in his head, his eyes closed, lying on his bed one morning before breakfast, listening intently.
At that admission, Draco’s face lit up in pink splotches, and Harry didn’t know if he wanted to pummel the man or snog the lights out of him.
“Potter, I swear to Salazar. If you don’t shut up about my heritage, I will murder you in your sleep.”
"You can call me Harry." he uttered as they made it to the room in question, and Iain handed over his key to him with a wink. Harry’s eyes widened a bit in shock at the other man’s flirty gesture but took it in stride.
The vibrations of the noises, along with the heat from his mouth, had Draco coming faster than he intended, but he wasn’t complaining.
He swallowed dryly, a feeling of dread creeping in his veins as he watched Draco nod to his boyfriend with a forced smile and leaned into a kiss.
They were, after all, both handsome blokes. What’s wrong with appreciating beauty when it appears in front of you?
Harry did stuff his phone and earbuds into his robes’ pocket and felt oddly watched once again. He looked up and saw Malfoy glancing back at him from his table in the very front, that same look he had earlier in the Great Hall plastered on his pointy face.
As if Draco could read his mind, there was an instantaneous, hot, wet tongue prodding at his furled entrance, and Harry squeaked aloud.
, Harry thought with a frown as he stared at the ceiling of his room, the song still ringing in his ears. Maybe he shouldn’t want to figure out who is sending these damned songs to him anyway if they were going to keep sending him songs like that.
"This house has never taken well to change. I suspect destroying your decorations has been a way for it to protest this particular change."
Malfoy blinked up at Harry, “Wouldn’t that be counterproductive? You could just go down to Hagrid’s to pick up the rest of the ingredients while I get the thorns, kill two birds with one stone as the Muggles say.”
Harry looked up through his eyelashes at the man and watched as Draco’s eyes were glued to him, his grey eyes glistening with arousal and other emotions swirling around that made Harry want to stay there at his feet forever and all eternity.
So, instead of thinking, Harry did the next best thing and placed his face back to the wall, lining up correctly, so his right eye had a perfect view of the scene.
“No need to look so put-out, Potter. You didn’t let me choose earlier when I was going to come during class, so I don’t believe you deserve that privilege either.”
With one last look of frustration at Malfoy and another that almost resembled longing to Harry, Iain walked off in a huff, and Harry felt Malfoy tittering with laughter beside him.
.” Draco snarled, wanting nothing more than for Jakob to arrive at the party tonight just to have the satisfaction of murdering him himself. “Especially when that someone is an atrocious, useless, vile -”
Malfoy finally turned his body around and walked down the stage away from where Harry and Smith sat, giving Harry enough time to catch the breath that had seemed to have gotten stuck somewhere in his throat.
Seamus only stuck his tongue out at the lot before continuing. “My dad loves Muggle music. I grew up with the best kind of stuff and can help you out here. But it depends on what kind of vibe you want to go with. There are
Malfoy’s lips thinned when he realized Harry wasn’t planning on dropping his eyes and backing down, finally breaking the moment between them himself, to Harry’s silent relief. A few tense seconds later, Malfoy then decided to grab his satchel and head towards the exit.
He must have decided to start masturbating in the few seconds that it took Harry to look away and then back again into the peephole.
Draco huffed, pinching Harry’s side in retribution, his smile widening at the man’s yelp. “I know. Now I do. And I you.”
He roughly brushed his teeth, made his way down early to the Great Hall, and plopped down at the Gryffindor table with a huff. He managed to find a spare second to look up from his (still songless) device to scoop some eggs onto his plate.
Draco had to hold himself back from coming just from that alone. The sight of Harry in front of him, utterly debauched, red spots all over his body, and his perfectly hard cock crying out for attention. He knew the slightest touch would have him coming.
“He’s rather good, isn’t he? Wouldn’t have suspected a former death eater of having many talents, yet here we are.”
And he twisted his head to see his snake of a boyfriend settled in on the bed, one arm behind his head as if he didn’t just fuck Harry’s brains out in the middle of an important work meeting.
Draco smiled a soft smile while Potter’s eyes were closed. It didn’t do for him to see him like that. But he couldn’t help it; the man was too perfect.
“But what if they’re a man?” Harry asked the last time Seamus had mentioned it during one game night in the common rooms.
Before Harry could punch the git in the face, he was gone, off down towards the tiki bar to harass/flirt with poor Rodrick some more.
"You should listen to your elf, Harry. He has served this family for generations and knows this house much better than you.”
Ever since...well, ever since the incident with Malfoy, Harry had been listening to this one song on repeat in hopes of a new song appearing soon. So suffice to say he knew most of the words by heart.
Harry just laughed, feeling entirely at ease for the first time in a long while, even as Malfoy pummeled him with pillow after pillow.
Harry grimaced at the starstruck expression on Romilda’s face. He was sure if he asked her to smuggle some poison from Slughorn’s secret stash and pour it down her own throat while he watched, she would comply with absolutely no questions asked.
Harry always thought that sort of thing was a bit much personally, but he was still keenly aware that it brought a soft smile to Draco’s features when his boyfriend would lean down and kiss his pale cheek.
He rolled his eyes, his foot tapping ceasing for the time being, only to take a few steps further into the room itself, clearly being nosy and taking in what a Gryffindor bedroom looks like.
Draco muttered a lubrication spell and rubbed his fingers together until it became warm, then wrapped his hand back around Potter, as his other sought Potter’s arse under his robes, circling his furled entrance.
A few seconds after the doors swung to a close Harry heard a small ding from his device, and he found that all the sudden he could breathe again, his chest feeling lighter.
Harry must have seen something in his expression, though, as he trudged up closer to where Draco stepped away. “Hey, look at me. Please?”
With a breath, he pulled Potter’s bottom lip into his mouth, biting it then running his tongue over his marks. “Am I safe to assume you and that slag are no longer an item?”
Kreacher shifted his gaze from Malfoy to Harry. Harry took a deep breath and swallowed some of his pride. "Yes, Kreacher, you may move this rug to its rightful place."
“What the hell does that even mean?” Harry muttered to himself, clearly agitated, as he stared down at the mobile in his hand. He chewed his inner cheek to smithereens in contemplation as the lyrics kept repeating in his ears, unaware of the inner turmoil they had been causing their listener for the past few hours.
“Minister? I was wondering if you wouldn’t mind if Luna and myself expounded on the research we conducted regarding the mistreatment of house-elves in the Isles?”
No, it was both, he realized as he felt his erection rub up against his trousers. The worst day to not wear pants, he decided, but he couldn’t find that he minded much. The roughness of his trousers felt nice against his cock, which was plumping up at the mere sounds coming from Potter’s mouth.
This was his first vacation, after all, well, if you don’t count that one time that Hermione dragged Ron and him to Disney World.
But, as it always was of late with him, his conscience lost the battle, and he crossed the threshold into the room, closing the door behind him and setting a privacy charm as well, just in case.
In true Malfoy fashion, he stuck his tongue out at him and flung water his way, which then ensued in a childish water fight between the two men, and Iain had to end up putting a stop to it.
Kingsley frowned his way, staring at him from his spot at the table in mild concern, but Harry cleared his throat and coughed loudly. That seemed to do the trick, as Luna finally finished her spiel.
Draco had been coming with Pansy to this club almost every Saturday for the past four years since the War. And not once has he seen Potter wandering this particular venue.
He figured he could have one more drink and sit at the bar for the next twenty minutes, then scram. After all, he already made his rounds with the essential people in his department and out, and the Minster had been on good terms with him as of recently; he wouldn’t think the man would mind if he left the festivities earlier than usual.
“Record player, turntable, whatever you fancy calling it, yes Potter, that is what people call it.” Malfoy narrowed his eyes as he finally looked up at him from his perch on the bed. “I realize your upbringing wasn’t incredibly enlightening, but you can’t honestly tell me you have never seen one before.”
Hermione had mentioned to him that this particular resort is the only one located on the entire beach, making it very desirable to everyone.
When Malfoy and himself walked into the old, dilapidated building, they were both immediately bombarded with hexes from all sides, but thankfully they made it out mostly unscathed physically. Just a few scrapes and bruises, part of the job description.
“I personally don’t understand where they are going with this, but that’s just me.” Draco droned on, his posh voice making Harry want to get on his knees then and there. “What’re your thoughts on the new mandate? Do you hope it goes into full effect by the New Year, or do you want it to be voted against?”
Once Malfoy bowed and finished, eliciting applause from most patrons, Harry found he had no other reason to stick around longer on the date and he scrambled out of the bar, ignoring Smith calling his name from behind.
Draco couldn’t hold it back anymore and swore he blacked out for a few seconds as he came in his trousers suddenly; he was barely able to sit up straight at his desk, let alone pretend he had been reading for the past twenty minutes. His right hand clumsily grasped at the side of his table for some sort of stabilization to ensure he didn’t fall right out of his seat.
But some irrational and insane part of Harry wanted this to be fate, that perhaps this song was meant to play at this moment in time to lead him to his person, finally.
After making his way over, shoes echoing in the mostly silent room, Draco stopped beside the man and looked down at him, attempting an air of indifference, as he took him in, ignoring the way his breath caught in his throat as he gazed down at the bound man below him.
Even though he had been getting them on the regular every day for the past month, his chest hurt as he considered the possibility that maybe Typhon was tired of him.
The snow began to fall as they took their first steps outside as if it had been waiting for them all this time. The wind hit their faces almost immediately, and Draco eyed his boyfriend as he pulled out that ridiculously multi-colored beanie that Molly Weasley knitted for him this year.
He figured Potter had one more round in him to go through. And that was when Draco stopped abruptly, right as Potter was leaning his head back on the pillows, and Draco just knew he was so close.
He then left to pour out the drinks for a new couple across the bar from him, and Harry smiled back at him as he did so. At least the bartender was nice, not to mention easy on the eyes as well.
“What the buggering fuck!” He almost threw his wand across the living room as his last incantation did nothing more than spout out a few sparks. The broken pieces of glass still lay there on the ground, unmoving.
He could feel Hermione’s gaze on him as he watched Malfoy disappear up to his room, but he couldn’t be bothered by it.
Harry wanted to make a snide comment about the chosen nickname, but his mouth was quicker than his head. “And to think I thought that was your end-goal, having me off. I wouldn’t blame you - I know how distracting I can be. Must have been a tough month for you, having me sitting here, working here in your room.”
There was no way Harry could disobey such an order, as he came hard inside the cock-sheath to the feeling of Malfoy’s still clothed erection rubbing off on his bare arse under the luke-warm water long forgotten in the frenzy of the moment.
Harry then realized he was nude, which generally isn’t an issue around Malfoy with their professions. But considering the circumstances, he felt like he was seventeen again, and Malfoy was here to rough him up a bit.
“Oh, you have no idea, do you Potter?” Malfoy finally got enough control of himself, his voice still a tad scratchy from the coughing. Harry tried to think of the sound as anything other than sexy.
The hand that wasn’t currently kneading Potter’s arse was clinging to the club’s wall so hard his knuckles ached.
He watched as Malfoy's eyes seemed to darken even further, as he pushed the plug further inside his mouth; his other hand reaching for his wand by the bedside table where it laid.
“That’s rich, coming from you," Harry blurted out and immediately regretted it when he saw the pained look on Malfoy's face. "I mean, what should I do about my Christmas tree? It can’t be as simple as straightening out a rug, can it?”
Draco only scoffed. “It’s not as though I do it willingly. Half of the time, it’s either a front-page article of you and your latest hairstyle or the last poor sod you took to bed. Spoiler alert on the hair; it’s always been the same. Disorderly and disruptive.”
Realizing he had shut his eyes, Draco opened them and saw Potter’s eyes raptly burning through his soul. He realized he had switched to English then.
Then again, if Draco knew of one person who would be able to defend himself no matter what odd arrangement they were in, it’s Potter.
He was sure Malfoy was still a prat, but Harry wasn’t always making sure folks around him knew about his prattishness or stalking him as he had done in years past.
He wanted to kiss Proudfoot for performing such a powerful cooling charm, as he felt like he could finally breathe again. He tried desperately not to be so apparent as he sucked in a few lungfuls of cold air.
He watched as Potter’s eyes darkened at that, his tongue poking out to lick his lips, and Draco had to hold himself back from jumping him, literally.
“Why don’t you send them a text? Ask them who they are?” Seamus shrugged as if that was the most obvious answer there was.
He muttered a quick spell, and Harry let out a shaky breath as he felt lube running down his legs, suddenly much more relaxed than before as well. “Relax Potter, you need this badly, don’t you?”
Draco and himself had gone on their long-planned trip to Switzerland with the Weasley-Parkinson clan, and Harry was damned if he had to change the dates for any ridiculous work reason. So taking a meeting during vacation was the only option he had.
She gave him a knowing look that only made Harry want the floor to open up and take him. “This is a special mistletoe,” she replied as if that was the answer to all their problems.
Better yet, it was just far enough away so the viewer could see the full form of Malfoy’s body, his lithe, pale body as the stream of water ran down him, his back muscles moving and tensing as he continued to move his right hand over the tip of his flushed cock.
To give the man...some credit...he had gotten better recently, from what Harry saw of him. But it was the only tradition for them to hate each other.
His mates all nodded as he made his leave for the night, whispering under their breath as he left. Harry could have sworn he heard Dean whisper something about ‘oblivious wanker’ on his way up to bed.
Harry remembered earlier that day in Potions, and he’d made a passing comment to Hermione about how he looked a lot less pale than he had in previous years.
Glancing about at the stone resin shower walls, Harry noticed a few differently sized shampoo bottles and picked out a random purple colored one that smelled vaguely of mint and tingled refreshingly on his scalp.
He didn’t need anyone to bring joy to his dull life. He could figure out how to bring happiness into it without anyone else’s help. And without Draco in it.
Harry jumped a good foot in the air, searching for the voice and finding Malfoy casually leaning against one of the cobblestone arches, watching him intently.
Harry couldn’t find a verbal response, his mind whirling with the knowledge that Malfoy was up in his room, hovering over him as he lay in his
What in the sodding hell. Draco truly wasn’t sure if he was actually getting off on Potter’s made-up language or if he was ultimately and utterly losing it as well.
Harry’s initial question dwindled off into space when his brain caught up with what Malfoy had just said and he closed his mouth, opened it again to say something then closed it again a few seconds later like one of those fish in the ocean.
But no, the sounds were starting up again, and Draco leaned a tad bit further in his seat to hear clearer.
“Not sure about the fourteen-year-old girl bit, but you do look a tad worse for wear, Potter. What’s got your knickers in a twist?”
Sitting on the couch here with him, Harry felt a sudden strong need to touch, kiss, and claim the man beside him in every single way in life.
Perhaps that was why he closed up anytime conversations veered into the territory of their pasts. A small part of Draco was deathly afraid that bringing up old demons buried deep between the two of them could ruin things for good.
Potter froze, and that was when Draco realized his hand still wrapped around his wrist. He let go and straightened his shirt from where it was hanging off his slender shoulder.
Instead, Malfoy gazed outwards past the courtyard, into the darkness of the night. Harry watched as his eyes seemed far away, his face hard as stone, unforgiving, the fire from before gone out.
After Hogwarts, the two of them hit it off incredibly so at the academy, much to the surprise of everyone around them. And now, here he was, showering in Malfoy’s expensive and specifically sexy shower.
It didn’t matter to him though; he could be talking about all of that, and then some, it wouldn’t stop Draco from touching Potter at this moment.
“Fine. I don’t know anything. You’re right, as per usual, Malfoy. I’ll leave you to it then. I finished my part of the assignment; all that's left are your final remarks.”
“So take heed. I trust you as eighth years not to mishandle this potion; we wouldn’t want another mishap like a few years back now, would we?”
Speaking of, Draco had now decided to saunter around the stall as if giving an indecent show to a crowd. He ran a hand through his wet, mused hair as his other kept a steady pace on his cock, as he walked around the small stall, the steam from the shower giving the man such a beautiful shine about him.
Everyone knew about Potter and his new Muggle boyfriend of six months. They graced headlines everywhere together. Potter seemingly adored the man, and vice versa, if the tabloids were to be believed.
They had got past all that pettiness long ago, yet Harry noticed it slipped out sometimes when Draco was irritated with him,  and it made his blood boil.
Draco dragged him then to his room with no more questions asked, Harry’s towel falling off at some point, and the whiskey was skipped over that night.
. I like that.” Malfoy's hand was a feather-like touch as it moved down further barely fondling him over his trunks before moving back up his body instead, pulling at his dark hair.
It was a ticket of sorts. Written on it in a sleek golden script was the name of some tropical location if the photo of moving waves and palm trees was anything to go by. Underneath, there was the name and address of a condominium, as well as check-in times.
After the first meeting, Draco must have felt more comfortable having his boyfriend around them more often, judging by the number of times Justin visited both Harry’s and Draco’s workplace.
“That answers that question.” Harry felt rather than saw the smirk on Malfoy as he nibbled up his neck before pushing him further down onto the soft coverlet, stopping his thrusting and putting his hands on his chest. He stared down at him, eyeing him like he was his meal for the evening and he hadn't eaten in days.
Harry rubbed his eyes because he can't be fully awake. But no matter how much he shakes himself, Malfoy still seemed much more jolly than Harry expected him to be after just finding out that the Gryffindor accidentally slept over in his wicker chair.
Before Draco could say anything, Potter was leaning ever so closer, their mouths only inches apart. “I didn’t have anything to show you.” Potter’s voice was like velvet, deep and soft, and Draco wanted to drown in it completely.
He walked for a bit more, pausing suddenly at what sounded like a rush of water coming through the other side of the wall to his left. Leaning to one side, he put his ear to the cold stone, but that didn’t seem to help much.
Once Draco came to himself, he looked down at the sated Harry and wanted to laugh and cuddle him all at the same time, and his heart oddly pounded in his chest.
“Erm, well yeah uh - but it’s okay! This is fine, what we did tonight and have now. We don’t have to feel the need for more. It’s
Draco felt the dildo become larger, and Harry keened even louder now without the pillows to hide his sounds.
Harry was suddenly very grateful for the incredible acoustics the bathroom had, as  Malfoy’s mouth fell open as he fisted his cock right under the head, the loveliest moan falling from his lips, sounding as if he hadn’t touched himself in weeks when in truth it was two nights ago.
Draco watched unblinkingly, infinitely pleased. His cock twitched again as he watched Potter ultimately come undone by his hands.
Hell, maybe Harry could even convince to bring out those Switzerland chocolates his mother always sends.
Malfoy started on a long, drawn-out spiel about how lovely of a gentleman the man who he had been helping was. “Those legs of his are sculpted so perfectly. But I suppose they have to be, right, Roddy?”
That erratic pounding would have been worrying but he consciously hadn’t put much effort into mulling over the fact that it wouldn’t do to get caught up in feelings for someone who would never be interested.
An indigent shout from the other man and a vice-like grip on Harry’s hand had him trying to hold back a wave of laughter. Malfoy’s expression went from relaxed to vengeful in half a second.
He did manage to convince Ron to take the food back to the common room and eat there, and Ron didn’t care or pay too much mind to Harry’s rushing, as long as he got his snacks.
As he came down from what had to be one of the best orgasms in near memory, Draco heard a debauched Potter muttering random sounds, and he realized he was still going on in Parseltongue as he came down from his high.
Draco’s eye twitched at the idea of Potter and the other git sharing a flat together but said nothing, wanting Potter to finish, his thumb rubbing against the fabric of his robe’s collar.
was years ago. But now, seeing him laid off so enticingly open and needy, his back muscles taut from where he lay, ready for whatever Draco was planning, was enough to drive him to insanity.
The bartender smirked knowingly at him, and Harry didn't really know what to make of it, as he watched the man take two different mixed drinks and began shaking them simultaneously, keeping his eyes on Harry as he did so.
As he was passing the couch, a rustling sound came out of nowhere, and Harry initially summed it up to be a side-effect from the dragon juice at first, but then a few others looked upwards at the ceiling towards where the sound was coming from as well.
Harry wasn’t sure why he said it, but he didn’t necessarily regret it, not when Malfoy didn’t automatically raise a wand to hex his bollocks off.
“I would never have imagined that Weaselbee had the bollocks to dance in front of others,” he noted under his breath so just Harry could hear, watching as Harry took an experimental sniff, eyeing the drink with unease.
Harry did laugh out loud with the rest of his friends, as Seamus pulled an uncooperative Dean up on the table to sing with him, everyone still in their dress robes. Harry felt a warm glow of contentment radiating in him at sight.
Draco only chuckled as he continued laying on top of his favorite pillow, aka his glowing, wonderfully perfect lover, and he thought to himself that he might have to send George a thank you note.
Or that he couldn’t look away from that ridiculous swim cap of his. Apparently, the chlorine in Muggle pools had him worried for its safety, which Harry found incredibly amusing.
Harry cried when Draco wrapped his hand back around him, dragging his palm up and down his leaking cock slowly, teasing him with feather-like touches.
Either option seemed entirely valid as he trudged along with Ron and Hermione to the bar for the night, his mobile clutched in his hand.
Potter whined pitifully at the sudden lack of contact, and Draco chuckled under his breath but put a hand down on his stomach, ensuring he hadn’t gone anywhere.
Ginny, on the other hand, always wanted to venture out with him in terms of sex toys. But for some reason, the idea of walking into a sex store with her and talking about what they would do with them,
His cock itself truly was rather nice, Harry thought, as his eyes decided to stare as the other man’s long-fingered hand wrapped around the girthy but long enough, reddened prick.
He suddenly imagined Malfoy watching him get off on him, literally (or at least by thinking of him), and that was enough for him to come in a hot, quaking, sticky mess all over his sheets.
The fleshlight seemed to mold even further, tighter around his cock, and Harry gasped as it began stimulating his sensitive skin right away.
Potter huffed, amused. His hair jolted with the movement, causing a piece to fall over his scar on his forehead, where his scar was, and Draco reached over, moving it back in place on top of his head.
One moment Harry was sitting on his surfboard, ready to go, and the next, he was overtaken by the wave he attempted to ride, saltwater immediately taking over all his senses.
Draco blinked at that, his mind trying to take in that new piece of information, but the man kept at it.
“What is it with everyone suddenly fancying you anyway?” She huffed. “You don’t have that much going for you. You still wear those old ruddy glasses, are clearly oblivious to anything going on, and have hardly grown much muscle from the past decade! What is there to be so obsessed about?!”
His knees started acting up from where he was kneeling, so Harry relaxed them and decided the hell with it and laid on his stomach, leaning fully on his elbows as he continued his note-taking, every so often adding his input into the pot.
“Hold that beautiful thought, gotta use the loo, be back shortly.” Smith leaned in and kissed his cheek, to Harry’s surprise and slight disgust. He gave a manly squeak in response, but Smith had already left for the restrooms.
He knew somewhere deep down there was no controlling his actions if he found himself being in close proximity to the other man.
“Bloody ridiculous, this is! Not giving us but a week in preparation!” He scowled, shoving more sausages down his throat in frustration. “I’m gonna have to owl mum to send those bloody robes from fourth year.”
Maybe that was their whole game. The boyfriend planned the scenes, and Potter followed along. Draco frowned at that; Potter never was a ‘follower,’ never had been.
He figured he wouldn’t bother Floo-ing in his whole body, Harry knew how his boss was, and if he had decided to completely and thoroughly Floo in to take a seat at the table, he wouldn’t be able to get away in time for supper that Draco was planning on cooking for them all.
These next two weeks might not be too bad after all, he mused, drifting off into a tipsy, mid-morning nap.
Harry should have known better to try and deter him, though, as his clever hands pushed at the back of his thighs, maneuvering Harry’s straight legs back into his earlier position, on his knees.
“Have you still not learned how to properly walk without running into things, Potter?” Malfoy asked, clearly unimpressed, his eyes never leaving the cauldron in front of him as he stirred the potion delicately.
He figured it was for the best all-around; he didn’t want to deal with a drunk Seamus trying to snog everyone like last year.
as dull as the last, Draco mused. He stared out at all the officials, politicians, and the like - all kissing each other’s arseholes and schmoozing as if the Minister himself would lay down and offer his job to any poor fool who spoke to him a certain way.
Strange words were shouted and he heard cries from other Ministry workers as he laid stunned on the floor, his robes growing damp with his blood.
“I notice you didn’t ask a single question during the lesson,” she said, smiling slightly as she walked towards them.  She looked slightly down at the boy and her mind tingled with something again.  ‘
There was something but it wasn’t the same and Qye’s breathing quickened, a little faster and panicky as he opened his eyes again, blinking rapidly to focus.
He wondered to himself, not for the first time, if maybe he had been slightly too hasty in accepting the case, Minister of Magic and Headmaster of Hogwarts or not.
Lest felt every moment as the group hurried to the grounds, not fast enough, senses flooding as he searched and eliminated one beast after another while the wizards sent stray students towards safety.  The moment he stepped out into the open air, he froze as he recognized the familiar presence.
“Cornelius,” Dumbledore said gently as Jonas retreated back to his work, “Healer Smethwyck and Ms. Nilsson have everything well in hand and would alert us the moment anything changes.  The best we can do is continue to support them as we have and give them their space to work.”
Hermione huffed and entered fully into his room. “Honestly, Harry, don’t be melodramatic, it doesn’t suit you. And besides, if you had listened to me when I told you to come here the first time you wouldn’t have had to stay as long as you did.” She had that ‘
The dog pawed at the ground, impatiently watching as Remus worked to secure the other bag that had loosened during the exit
“Great,” Qye muttered, slouching in his armchair and folding his arms across his stomach.  “Where do you want us to start, the beginning?”
“It’s why I told you to wait for one of the telepaths, Reya,” another voice, differently accented this time, called out from behind the group of enemy vampires.
“Harry,” the Headmaster said and he tore his eyes away from his now-bloodied hand, his body shaking slightly. He felt drained, powerless, so tired and the world blurred at the edges. Behind Dumbledore’s figure he saw a large crowd looking uneasily at him.
Draco shrugged, hooking one of his thumbs in his pocket as he looked down the pathway.  “I didn’t plan this,” he said, studying the path as Harry studied him.  “If you recall, we started out the year very similar to the others.”  He looked back at Harry.  “You kind of crept on me,” Draco said simply, his gaze straight and unflinching.  “By the time I realized what I wanted, I didn’t see any reason to fight it.  So if it feels easy to you it might be because for me, it’s been a long time coming.”
He watched somberly as the Dementors once promised to Sirius guided the lost soul away, his howls pleading for mercy, promising secrets and plans.  His eyes fell upon the hooded vampires stiffly standing next to the Aurors, their low voices whispering of prisoner exchanges and interrogations by demand of the Pater Opacre while Sirius walked, terrified yet courageous, to stand in front of the court while they reviewed the circumstances of his sentence, his escape from Azkaban, the discussion of his freedom.
He opened his mouth to deliver his scathing retort when Harry muttered, “He’s doing hell of a job showing you otherwise, isn’t he?”
“They’re ready for you now,” Smethwyck said gently, holding the door open.  He tilted his head, his brow creasing as he caught sight of Harry.  “Is he - ”
He looked at her innocently when she glared at him.  She opened her mouth, obviously intent on berating him.
After he had made a quick trip to the bathroom to retch out his final nerves and wash his face into a semblance of calmness, he had returned to the sight of Sirius Black stumbling out of Potter’s room, his face white and eyes wild, while a brown-haired man Jonas took to be Remus Lupin unsteadily led him back to the main room of the wing they had adopted as their more permanent residence for Potter’s treatment.
Not only would he have to deal with Malfoy in Potions for the entire year, now he had to deal with the arrogant git for the first quarter as well.
“So you two just decided to, what, be civil?” Harry broke in again, a flush on his cheeks making his attempt to change the subject even more obvious.  “Now?  Without the world ending?  Or bloodshed?  Or did you actually - ”
“You’re lucky I chose to hit you in the back of the head instead of the front!” his sister snapped.  “What the hell is the matter with you?!”
“Is that what you think it is?” the Slytherin asked, raising an eyebrow.  At Harry’s firm nod, he smiled a faint, bitter smile.  “Not much in giving second chances, are you, Potter?”
It was ridiculous how easy it was to slip into the savior of the wizarding world’s room undetected. Then again, he had trained himself against things with better hearing than a sleeping old nurse.
“They’re waiting for us,” Marylin smiled weakly, still playing with her fingers, playing with a bracelet on her left wrist.  “I’m sure he’ll run into them and they’ll wait for us.”
“Yes,” she replied, putting down the bottle and clasping her hands together.  Her smile grew a little brighter.  “Yes, that’s a lovely thought.”
He would be mostly alone in the Gryffindor Tower this year.  Hermione would be spending the holidays with her family in Holland and Ron was to go with his family to Romania to spend time with Charlie, the second eldest Weasley boy.  The Weasleys had invited - practically pleaded -him to come with them but he politely declined.  As much as he loved the redheaded family and saw them as his surrogate family, he wasn't actually part of their family.  He didn't want to impose on their family vacation and he finally managed to reassure them that he would be fine for the holidays by himself.
“Yes, she seemed to be doing that,” she laughed softly.  Harry relaxed and smiled a bit more at her, his bright green eyes looking at her in slight approval.  She looked down at him and in the back of her head she thought, ‘
“He wasn’t calling you Harry, Qye,” Remus broke in soothingly and Sirius stopped as he realized what happened, what he had been doing without thinking.
“I know why he - ”  Qye jerked his chin to Sirius “ – wasn’t around, he made stupid as hell decisions.”  Sirius winced but said nothing to defend himself, knowing the statement was true even though Harry had never said anything like it.  “But you?”  Distrustful eyes narrowed.  “Why didn’t you try and get custody after our parents died?”
“True.”  Draco hesitated for a moment and then nodded at him and started walking back to the main street.  Harry watched him until he disappeared from view and then sighed deeply and dropped his head to rest against a wooden post.
?” she said, a slight tone of disrespect in the title.  “What are you going to say to the old man?  Hand us over to be slaves?  Have you our collars ready?  Are you eager to be like the Dazains, following a wizard like a
“Yeah,” Sirius whispered, the wildness in his eyes settling, blinking rapidly.  “Yeah, I’m going to be here.”
“He is,” Ron muttered. “But the moron escaped after lunch and now Pomfrey’s on the rampage.” He shook his head and said mournfully, “That boy has a lot to learn about women.”
Harry closed his eyes, trying to convey his desire, hesitation, fear and hope as much as possible as he kissed him, his fingers clenching tight.  He exhaled against Draco’s lips as he began to pull back, a slight shiver running through him.
“That’s putting it simply,” Smethwyck said dryly and Qye rolled his eyes.  He heard the Healer sigh deeply.  “But yes, for simplicity’s sake that is - ”
“I’m sure you know full well of my father’s intention for power, whatever the means,” Draco said, absently toying with his silk tie.  “When his last gambit for it failed, he took to other avenues, the Ministry, the school board.  But the ties to You Know Who followed him and he needed something a little more.
He turned and left the room.  “Sure,” he murmured.  “You’re fine, Harry.”  He turned around and forced a grin.  “Come on, let’s hurry up or we’ll having Katie channeling Wood again.”
Qye felt his eyes widening as his anger was interrupted by memories of a kind smile and honey sweet fruit.
As he picked up his vial from the table, which was amazingly not broken, Harry glanced at the closed door again.  ‘
Malfoy's hand shot out from next to him, grasping his wrist and tugging it away from his potion.  He choked off a yelp, his eyes widening as he turned to stare at a furious Malfoy.
“Exactly, Ron,” Hermione said soothingly, as she stepped up next to the fuming redhead and placing a restraining hand on him.  Her brown eyes turned to glare angrily at the blond.  Raising her voice slightly, she said coolly, “Don’t you know?  No matter how hard they try to clean themselves, ferrets will always reek.  They aren’t worth the time.”
The door creaked open and he glanced up, saw Remus shake the rainwater off his ragged coat before he closed the door and hung it up.
“What the hell is going on?” Sirius interrupted, his harsh voice cutting off her murmurs.  He threw Snape a harsh look that the Potions Master returned with a sneer.  “We get a letter from Dumbledore to return as soon as possible to Hogwarts while the Prophet’s speculating the worst, bloody well find the Floo Network shut because of the attack and have to travel by fucking train and now you go revealing my identity first chance you get – ”
He heard a ragged inhale and he blinked and turned his head to see Harry staring wide and shocked at him.
He didn’t see the blue eyes of the vampire turning to look at his back as he left the Great Hall.  He didn’t see the weighing, considering look in them.
:: the person said and Harry shivered as he felt that physical-into-mental feeling in his head, telling him that they raised an eyebrow.  ::
Malfoy then muttered under his breath about needing the extra time to spend on Arthminacy, and Harry remembered then how similar he and Hermione always had been regarding school-work and their grades.
Malfoy had his back to him as he had already started cutting up the necessary ingredients for today’s potion, so Harry swallowed his pride and strutted over, attempting to ooze confidence he wasn’t feeling.
But apparently, Luna didn’t get that memo, as a sprig of a holly-looking plant appeared out of literal thin air and was now floating above a pink-faced Hermione and a pleased looking Ron on the couch.
Millicent Bulstrode was sitting behind Harry, but he figured she was probably there for her brute strength if it ever came down to that.
At a certain point, Harry realized that he might have miscalculated the time before Draco would dump him by a bit.
as they are, they sense when there are two people in a room together that want to kiss one another. And they won’t allow the two to leave until a kiss happens. Between them.”
It was becoming abundantly clear that Harry should have been less concerned about Luna and more worried about Hermione going on and on; as she started her statement for the planned meeting. Harry hadn’t realized how long he had blanked out during it until Ron sneezed, bringing back into the present.
Blaise Zabini, who Harry knew was relatively close to Malfoy, hadn’t lifted his stern gaze from Harry the entire time.
Draco knew at the end of the day, the memories of that night were sacred, and if he ever did get drunk enough to
Harry reached in his pocket, where he always kept his music player, pulled it out, and then began scrolling through until he found the song in question. He tried not to be crestfallen that there was no new song waiting for him as he checked the artist’s name and told it to Malfoy.
Draco smiled ruefully over at him, “I quite agree. However, I feel like your life needed a bit of extra pizzazz, don’t you? Granger told me you’ve been spending quite a lot of time alone at home lately.”
"You celebrated Christmas here?" Harry imagined little Draco, blond and posh in a velvet dress like Little Lord Fauntleroy. "With a tree and garlands and twinkling stars in the windows and all?"
““No! I will not shut up, you prat! I’m not even with Ginny, nor would I ever want to be with her! Not that it’s any of your business but I haven’t been with her since last year - so shut your fucking mouth!”
But his interest has struck, as he ran a hand down the smooth outside shaft of it, noticing he could barely fit his hand around the thing as he went to wrap a fist around the tip.
pretty well.” Harry didn’t mean for the statement to come out as petulantly as it did, but there was no taking it back now.
“Wicked...” Harry muttered into his coffee, looking down at the table as his foot twitching under the table against Draco’s own.
Harry had to remember how to speak, as felt the man’s erection, clearly bobbing happily and hitting Harry's thigh. He raised his leg, rubbing against him before a strong hand reached down and grabbed it, pressing it into the bed. “Uhh, oh
Harry looked up from where he still sat in front of the gramophone and found one of Malfoy’s signature unimpressed frowns directed at him, his arms crossed in front of him.
But tonight, he was too high-strung and needed release desperately. More than anything he could ever remember needing in a
He sat it on the table, secretly pleased that it looked to be a few inches smaller than himself. He then reached down and pulled his own cock out of his trousers, sighing in relief. He tugged himself gently for a few moments, but Harry shook his head, groaning from behind his gag as if he could see Draco’s current ministrations.
Draco grabbed the man’s wrists, pulling them above him against the wall, “I don’t think I told you to stop speaking in snake.”
of all people made his head spin a little too fast, and he didn’t think it was because of the new green apple scented scrub he was currently rubbing through his dead ends that Harry could smell.
Harry was still pretty out of it, but he could sense Malfoy’s jealousy, even in his current state. Something about it made him giggle into the other man’s chest, “That’s not even close to being correct,” Malfoy lightly slapped him on his arse in retribution, only making Harry snicker more.
Draco reached up towards Harry’s face; Harry expected a light caress but instead was rewarded with a pinch to his cheek. “Aw look at you Potter - er,
Harry pulled his own already rock hard cock out of his pants, already knowing he was too close to give himself a good wank without the risk of coming in seconds, with the way Malfoy was crudely going about it.
His hips stuttered at that thought as he felt his own pre-come inside the toy and groaned at the filthiness of the whole thing.
“Ah yes, Master Black. Even the other day as I was sweeping the floors upstairs, minding my own business, mind you, Master Potter came trudging through the living room completely in the nude, of all things –”
He started walking briskly away before he could finish his thought, as his mind could only hold one coherent purpose at that moment.
It’s a normal reaction, he told himself as he quickly turned over, almost like ripping off a bandaid in a way. He immediately shut his eyes, not wanting to see Malfoy’s reaction to his poorly timed erection.
But he was too busy himself attempting to kick his partner in the bollocks behind him as his hands traced up his lower back to where the Floo portal began and back down again.
He figured with all the times he’s saved his life over the past seven years, Harry could forgive him for any interesting kinks the man may have, and he bit back another snort at the simple fact of Malfoy having something so trivial hanging up where anyone could see.
Harry wrapped the towel around his damp hips and chanced a glance at his partner’s way, to see his own gaze watching him intently.
read. I just saw that list as more of...guidelines than anything else.” Draco had to bite back his smirk as the man's eyes twitched, clearly fuming before him.
A few seconds too late, he moved his other hand over his mouth to stifle any more pleasing sounds as his view was still firmly on Malfoy’s form in the peephole.
Draco swallowed back a snort, leave it to Harry to not beat around the bush regarding anything. “Oh, nothing too drastic. Just our wicked past between the two of us.”
Pansy whispered in his ear something about the woman on the other end of the dance floor, the one she’d been eyeing all night, and Draco only nodded before she skipped her way through the crowd to her red-headed pull of the night.
Not that he wasn’t sure in his sexuality, that wasn’t a question in his mind, as far as he was concerned. He knew he fancied men and women.
Yet, he was as red in the face as his Gryffindor robes, his green eyes, usually so bright and clear -- now glazed over and cloudy, as if he had been watching for longer than Draco had even realized. Watching him fall apart over
Harry sniggered into his hand as Hermione explained everything to Ron until he finally nodded in understanding. “Blimey...that is certainly something, Harry.”
Draco had to remember how to breathe at that and nodded against Harry’s sweat-sheened throat as he slowly pushed into him.
“Is he singing about a strip club?” Dean mouthed to Harry from across the table, and Harry could only shrug helplessly, his eyes glued to the scene before him.
“Alright then, Potter. I’m sure whatever your point is will be mind-blowing.” The blond smirked at him and seemed to relax a little at that, nodding his head for Harry to continue.
But the right kind -- the type of tired where all he wanted to do was go down to the beach and lay around like a useless slag.
He sauntered his way around the stage like he owned the whole establishment, and folks were getting on their feet, dancing and clapping in time to his voice and the music in the background.
He slid off him then, allowing Harry to get in position, and did he ever. His arse popped up from the mattress as he plopped over on his stomach as requested, and Draco smirked down at the display.
Malfoy eyed him up and down, crossing his arms across his chest in an attempt to intimidate. It seemed to work a bit, as he watched Potter swallow, his mouth tightening up in what looked to be discomfort.
Harry kept relatively silent for the remainder of the night as he watched his mates get progressively drunker as the evening wore on into nightfall.
“Fuck, fuck, Draco, I need— please!” Harry disjointly babbled from his position on the bed, red-faced and wet, tied up, cock ruddy and purple.
Jakob then walked past him, and Draco pulled his wand out on instinct, only to watch as walked straight on by towards Potter instead. He leaned over by the table where a box Draco didn’t see before sat, and pulled out a new gag.
lay heavy in his lap, there was a nasty crick in his neck that was going to give him issues all day, he can already tell, and for some reason, Malfoy looks almost...fond?
A loud yell came from further down the beach, closer to the water, and Harry started, quickly realizing it was two men screaming in laughter as one attempted to stand up on their wakeboard while the other helped.
"Yeah well, Head Auror Potter didn't have the same ring to it." Harry stated dryly, and almost jumped in alarm when Malfoy laughed.
“Do you realize how indecent you look tonight?” Potter asked in a scratchy voice, and Draco’s jaw dropped.
That makes sense, Harry thought mutely, before he moved back in position to see through the hole again before his brain happened to come back with a win against his cock, wouldn’t want that after all.
. I need you to -” he then jerked back, as if he did something wrong, completely caving in on himself, and Draco wrapped both arms around him.
The waves were something else, he thought dreamily, as he let them trickle up the sand to his feet before they cascaded back down into the ocean. The calming touch of the sand pushing and pulling along his feet made him want to sink into the sand permanently.
And of course, Malfoy was there, hanging out, all laid out on the largest chair as if the sod owned the whole bloody establishment. It was like Malfoy had some sort of Potter-scope on him, knowing where he was at all times.
After the initial awkwardness and silence, things didn’t seem as bad as Harry first assumed it would be.
Perhaps Potter was helping him, Draco thought, as his eyes drifted back to the man in question’s back.
Taking a deep breath, Harry came out from the shadows from the back of the stage and started singing over Malfoy's own angelic voice, most likely butchering the song in the process, but not caring in the slightest.
He immediately calmed, as he recognized the soft touch by a familiar, long-fingered hand, the hands in question slipping off his house-slippers off to rub at his bare feet.
“Do you know, I never bother cleaning it every time. I figure it’s just me; what’s a few times if I forget? You’re going to come inside that intermixed with my own come too. Do you like that Potter?”
Draco panted as his face nudged against the wall over Potter’s shoulder, he felt himself throb indecently in his trousers.
Instead of retorting back like he expected Harry to do, he only smiled a toothy grin. Merlin, Potter could easily give Draco a heart palpitation that could end his life with that look alone, and he would be alright with it.
He opened his mouth to reply that he was perfectly fine and was in no imminent danger (except for perhaps his cock coming entirely off the rest of his body thanks to Malfoy’s magical dick sheath). But at that exact moment, the sex toy tightened around the tip of his cock, and Harry cried out in pain/pleasure.
He had two fingers inside him, barely stretching him, and quickly found his prostate, then pulled out, right as Harry keens into the pillows on the bed, rutting into the silk sheets.
Harry wasn’t sure if he was relieved or offended, but McGonagall gave him a wink as they left and took it as a gift of good luck.
“Well, I never did apologize-” Malfoy uttered, taking a long drink of his wine right as the food appeared before them. Harry watched as Malfoy thanked the waiter and took a bite out of his dish, humming in approval.
He stood under the showerhead as he did so, staring at the wall opposite Harry, seemingly deep in thoughts that Harry didn’t want to try to think too hard about what they could be.
He swallowed back the swell of embarrassment he felt, as Luna and O’Brien had avid expressions as they took in every detail of his appearance, while Ron was seemingly looking at everything in the room but him.
eyes as he pulled his key out of his pocket, opening the door for Malfoy and shaking his head at the ridiculousness of this whole situation.
The dark-haired man in question only leaned forward into the Draco, rubbing one toned calve around and up behind Draco’s in response.
“Dinner. You have heard of it, I’m sure?” Malfoy eyed him with an air of disdain before relaxing into one of more nonchalance as if he knew the other man would accept. “I only thought it would be a good look for us to sit down and hash it out. What do you say?”
That last song also got Harry feeling hot under the collar so he had to stop playing it while hanging with his mates so that nobody would notice his reddened cheeks. These lyrics were the most provocative of all of them thus far.
“Is this punishment for earlier? Because I don’t think it was all my fault, per se. You didn’t have to lean so close to me and —
to. He was getting an O in Potions; that much was clear. Thankfully he has always been exceptional at the subject, so hardly any additional reading was really necessary.
His thoughts kept pulling him in different directions as images of pale, sweat-slicked skin appeared in his mind.
He narrowed down the people in his head to a final few he believed it could be. And with the way Smith had been eyeing him all year he had a good reason to invite him out just to see if Typhon could be him, even if his glances made Harry incredibly uncomfortable.
Draco claimed his mouth again, his hands letting go of his wrists, finally running down the man’s toned back.
And correct he was, Draco thought dryly. It wasn’t his fault the department would shatter without him there.
What Harry found the most maddening was the fact that most students had paired a nickname to their device, unwilling to put out their real name. McGonagall had mentioned on the first day of classes that anonymity might be a good thing anyway in the beginning as they tested out the new technology.
Harry knew the moment when his heart sank to his stomach, as Draco walked back over to his boyfriend, dragging him to the kitchen to no doubt apologize profusely and snog him senselessly to make up for making out with Harry moments prior.
Draco leaned in and touched his lips to Harry’s, a light sigh escaping his mouth as he did so without any warning. His breath tasted of that cranberry drink he had been consuming with a hint of mint, and Harry wanted to drown in it.
On that note, Harry grabbed his semi, stroking it a few times under the water with a sigh, before lining up with the fleshlight’s hole, before slowly pushing into the tight tube.
She straightened herself up and took a deep breath, clearly preparing herself for whatever it was that she was going to say.
The Singing Banshee had decided to take a break from their karaoke for the week; the workers must have been as tired of it all as they were. Instead, they had made room for a small area where their patrons could dance the night away.
“Oh, yes. The Stones were always pushing boundaries. Jagger was and is, a true Slytherin, or would be if he were a wizard,” Malfoy replied, a smirk evident in his voice.
“Did we just enter a fantastic alternate universe where Draco Malfoy can sing and has an arse for days?” Ron choked on his drink and punched Seamus in the arm as the drunken man laughed so hard, he practically fell out of his chair. “Someone pinch me!”
Harry harrumphed and nodded once, before slamming the door to his and Draco’s office closed, causing the blond to start in his seat, looking up as Harry passed by his desk, observing him, as he fell into his chair with his hands covering his face, elbows on his desk.
It seemed the opposite as Harry let out a breath of air while he thumbed his leaking cockhead and threw his head back deeper into his pillow in frustration at how hard he was.
Like earlier, when Malfoy grabbed his arm and pulled him back right as a green stream of light, almost nicked him, ripping his robes in the process, but also saving his life.
He bit his bottom lip, Gryffindor courage pumping through him, “Bloody hell Malfoy, for being a Seer, you are quite obtuse, you know that?”
“Harry! Are you alright?!” Hermione’s tone of concern caused everyone in the room to glance down at him, and Harry opened his mouth like a fish out of water, “I - I’m
Harry felt a surge of magic, and then - he realized with a sense of dread that he could no longer move his legs as they had been charmed to stay in place by his madman of a boyfriend.
“Such a good boy. You are perfect,” Draco cooed, running a hand through Harry’s unruly hair, smiling down at his boyfriend’s punchy expression.
But then he realized that the music was coming from somewhere else in the room, and Harry turned in his seat to inspect the noise.
Harry tried his damndest not to blink, as not to miss a single second. However, he didn’t find it challenging to do so as the wall’s hole was only accommodating to fit one of his eyes, not both.
Draco’s eyes rolled so far up into his skull; Harry was worried about them not being able to find their way back to Earth until the gray found his green, looking more amused than anything else.
Draco cursed himself for the amount of time he was spending thinking about Potter’s half-witted, irresponsible, thoughtless partner and downed the rest of his gin.
Hermione popped in, “A text is a Muggle message, including words. Similar to sending someone a letter via owl, but the receiver gets it instantly.”
The hole itself couldn’t be larger than the tip of his thumb, but it provided a perfect view into the specific shower stall, small enough that he didn’t need to worry about getting caught.
Knowing Draco, though, Harry imagined he had been on edge for a while now. The idea of fucking him through the Floo as he attended a work meeting was something that would get his filthy mind going haywire.
“If you don’t stop talking, I will have to murder you right here on the dance floor. Which would be rather disappointing, don’t you think?”
Ron grimaced and looked to Harry, shrugging unhelpfully. “Yeah, mate, I mean, you have to admit she has a point...” He scratched at his head, giving Harry a hopeful glance that maybe he would listen to Hermione this time.
Draco relaxed under the touch, allowing the kiss to linger for a few more moments before Harry pulled back minutely. “I mean, I want you. Every part of you all the time.”
It smelled wonderful, pine-fresh and earthy, and a bit like snow. Harry had loved bringing a bit of forest into the dusty room with its ancient rugs and overstuffed chairs and chesterfields.
The first time, Harry remembered that Ginny stopped by Grimmauld when Draco was there for lunch. She dropped off some of Molly’s famous oatmeal and berry cookies, which enraged Draco immensely.
It didn’t even matter that Harry was shit at Legilimency; he could still read Draco like an open book.
He also saw the scars that almost seemed to glow in the bathroom’s light, encapsulating across Malfoy’s whole chest. Harry watched as one of Malfoy’s hands ran a long finger down the length of one of the longer scars that ran from his sharp collarbone, down to his pointy hip bone.
Now, the tip of the tree was touching Harry's shoes. In its fall it had taken with it everything that stood in its path: the knickknacks on the mantelpiece, chairs and side-tables, a whole row of Chinese vases. And –
Harry didn’t buy it for one second. But he appeased the man and jumped into the pool, making sure to soak the blond man thoroughly with a rather large cannonball.
Without another thought, Harry slid from Draco’s lap to the floor suggestively, his eyes on a particular blushed Draco the whole time.
Harry couldn’t breathe. He just stood there like an imbecile with his cock stuck in Malfoy’s sex toy as the shower continued to rain down on himself.
Draco didn’t catch that, to both Harry’s relief and irritation. The Slytherin was more irked at his new secretary’s handwriting, which he called “atrociously undecipherable.”
As soon as he received that letter in the post last week from Potter’s boyfriend, he knew he would be in for it.
Potter shook his head at that, gasping for breath as Draco withdrew his fingers from him. Potter couldn’t seem to help but to whine, pushing back and attempting to follow his fingers, needing to maintain the sensation of being filled.
Eventually, Harry did make it out of bed and down to the shin-dig after a few more minutes of moping, thanks to Ginny’s incessant yelling at him through the door to put some pants on and join the party. He decided on a plain long-sleeved black shirt and some dark blue trousers.
If this had been a few years ago, and Harry found his arch-nemesis nude in the shower having a one-off, he would have been over the moon at the prospect of seeing him vulnerable in this position.
He eyed an album with a man with an orange lightning bolt painted on his face, and the current song changed if the small scratching sounds were anything to go by.
“He was smiling at me! Until you -” he pointed to a haughty-looking Parkinson, “- screamed at me. And then he flew away faster than a Cornish Pixie.”
His eyes widened even more at that, as the man’s cock looked so red that it might burst at any second. The metal piece Draco eyed before was tightly curved around Potter’s prick, doing its job of keeping him from coming. It reminded Draco of a snake, the way it was delicately wrapped around his cock, all the way from the leaking tip to around his swollen balls.
He did have to wonder where his oaf of a boyfriend was. He hadn’t come in with him; that much was evident unless he met him at some point after. Or perhaps he had other obligations and was planning on coming here later.
Harry watched as the blond left the Great Hall, feeling slightly itchy. Feeling like all the air left his body as if Malfoy took it all with him when he left.
Harry brooded into his own beer, playing with the condensation on the side instead of drinking it as he mulled over his and his friend’s past hour-long conversation.
“Bloody hell. Could his trousers be any tighter?” Seamus pondered aloud breathily as he feasted his eyes on Malfoy.
And isn’t that an exciting thought? Then again, he could undoubtedly picture the narcissistic bugger install in-home cameras just to re-watch himself.
“It looks like I’m not the one that sentiment applies to at the moment.” Malfoy drawled, his left foot almost touching the wet floor of the shower as he took yet another step closer.
Draco’s own under him. Harry groaned into the other’s mouth at the feeling of his long erection under him.
Potter was quiet again, this time keeping his intense, unwavering gaze at Draco. “It was you - I - I knew it was. And I know you knew I knew. I mean...of course you did.”
Harry couldn’t help but notice that the mistletoe was hovering, not between Draco and Justin, but Draco and
He wasn’t burnt down there as far as he could remember and he felt Malfoy’s hands press down a little harder where he had a few knots in his lower back. Harry bit out a groan as one of the knots loosened under Malfoy’s magical hands.
As Harry watched the man on stage he couldn’t help but wonder if Malfoy was looking for him as he eyed the crowd. He could see from his spot in the back of the bar that Malfoy’s grey eyes were scanning the people before him, all wholly enthralled by his voice as per the usual.
!” Seamus drunkenly whispered loudly, as the sounds around the bar went down a couple of notches, awaiting whatever horrible sound was going to emit from the man’s throat above them.
Harry hummed in response as he scanned one book that went over old names from centuries ago pertaining to Italian descendants in the wizarding world, with no luck finding a Typhon listed thus far.
He was standing under a massive stream of hot water, steam wafting off through the room, hands running through his posh hair with what was probably one of seven different conditioners he had on hand with him, by the looks of it.
Draco rubbed hands up and down his thighs, and Harry cleared his throat loudly in an attempt to stop the proceedings behind him. Ron only glanced his way once before finishing up the bit of his notes.
It made speaking with his friend hard, but Harry chalked it up to them being new together, and it made him feel better knowing it wasn’t going to last more than another few weeks at the most, knowing Draco.
Harry watched her expression cautiously, he already could tell that she hasn’t been the one sending him the songs. She took too long to read them and even had a look of disgust that mirrored jealousy, painting her expression the further she went into the lyrics.
Harry suddenly found it quite difficult to breathe as he watched Malfoy begin to move in an exceedingly specific
“Fuck,” Harry moaned under his breath, his voice strangled as he stroked his cock to full hardness to the same rhythm Malfoy was going at currently.
After the mission, Malfoy offered for Harry to come over to his flat to take notes from the raid before work the next day. Knowing how incredibly meticulous Kingsley had been lately regarding paperwork getting turned in on time, he figured it wouldn’t hurt to put some extra time on it and agreed to take Malfoy up on the offer.
Pausing in his stride, Malfoy stopped three feet away from the wall itself, keeping his eyes on at the crack in the wall, and suddenly his eyes became what could only be described as...mischievous.
Although, by the way, the man was squirming on the couch, he might have felt some of the aftershocks. Harry could never really control his magic, especially when he was out of his mind in need.
Harry only nodded, staring at Malfoy’s pale handwriting more notes as he spoke. “Tomorrow, I can go down to the greenhouses to gather some rose thorns.”
The loud ruckus in the background took on a more deafening crescendo as some drunk man wobbled up to the mic, breaking him from his reverie.
Potter’s expression had thoroughly gone from the calm and collected version on top of his game with Kingsley. To now, where he looked a mix between utterly nauseous and a nervous wreck. His eyes darted from Weasley to Granger, obviously trying to convey to them something or another to them silently.
“It’s quite alright. Jealousy is a completely normal feeling. Though, average and below you, if I do say so myself.”
More than a month and nothing.  No words, no letters, not even a decent argument as an outlet for his frustration.  If not for the fact that he saw Opacre’s face grow darker with a similar frustration every day, he would have thought the vampire had done something.  As it was, he still suspected something, with the way Harry seemed to avoid him as much as he did the Slytherin.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow.  “Now why would I do something like that?” he drawled, dropping his hand and leaning back in his chair, his knee propped up against the table.  “I would have no one left to torment.”
“I’ll hold you to that,” Harry smiled, trading a grin with Ron. “Pomfrey isn’t going to let me do much of anything around here.”
A long moment passed in which she gazed at the wary – and in some cases, frightened – group of teenagers.  Her clear blue eyes passed by each and every one of them and she saw many of them shift uncomfortably, most likely feeling as if their souls were being carefully examined, piece-by-piece.  She supposed they were, in a way.  The moment felt like an infinity.
:: Harry finally asked the other boy – who was still cheerfully humming the grating melody – as he left the table and Great Hall to walk down to the dungeons with the other Fifth Years..  ::
,’ Marylin silently said to herself, inwardly cheering as she watched some of the students begin to relax.  She hadn’t been lying when she had told them she wished to be friends with all of them or that being so serious wasn’t her way.  Well, mostly.  Over the years, since the beginning of the war, she had become more serious than she had usually been.  Still…that did not mean she liked being so reserved and quiet.  And she
“Leon!” she shouted as she dashed for her weapons, mind already racing and ready for a fight.  “Leon, your portkey!  Hastai, move your blasted arse!”
Voldemort chuckled.  “Is this the best of your so-called courage now?”  A mocking smile came upon his thin lips.  “If the wizarding world could only see their beloved savior as he stands in fear of true power - ”
“Wait,” Harry said, stopping, resisting Smethwyck’s insistent pulls as he turned back to the group.  “If we’re finally telling people, I want the Weasleys to know as well.  I - ”  He hesitated then stubbornly lifted his chin up.  “I want to talk to Ron and Hermione.”
“Dumbledore alerted me as to the reasons why you were to be kept from the wizarding world’s influence,” Remus said without defending himself.  The smile on his lips turned a bit rueful, a touch sardonic.  “And, of course, the Ministry informed me that it would be in everyone’s best interests to keep my distance.  They were very aware of my personal investment in you.”
“Suppose we should keep our end then, shouldn’t we?” the woman said in a bored voice.  “Although why it matters to him that we take out children, I’ll never know.”
“I don’t remember mine threatening you with unimaginable humiliation,” Draco drawled, glancing at Harry as they started to wander into the outskirts of the village.
A rush of heat filled him, the Libidates roaring in him as the long lived with ache inside him suddenly disappeared.  The soft skin, softer than feathers, silkier than anything he had ever felt made him want to moan with pleasure.  He could feel the warm blood pulsate beneath his fingers, its delicious scent surrounding him and creating a new ache inside of him, replacing the other one quickly.  Feeling the blood move beneath his fingers, the scent encompassing him…he wanted to whimper with unfulfilled desire.
“Mr. Lupin did,” Dumbledore interrupted gently, stirring his tea with his spoon.  “As I am sure you can imagine, the Ministry didn’t accept his request.”
“You can fix this,” Lest interrupted, a cold and distant look emerging on his face and Qye shook, staring in incredulity and rising rage once more because of course,
Harry watched silently as Professor Opacre said all this.  He turned his eyes to the Slytherin and he saw the other boy open his mouth, obviously not going to give his consent judging by the fury churning in his stormy eyes.  Without thinking about it, he reached over and grasped Malfoy’s hand that was resting on top of the table.
Her smile faltered and then faded. Her eyes swept over all of them and Harry thought she momentarily paused over him. He frowned and leaned forward.
"Now then," Professor Opacre said, clapping her hands together and smiling at the huddled group, some taking Neville's example and shrinking back so as to avoid being seen, "who wants to be first?"
"I was talking about you falling from your high horse," his voice smirked and Harry inwardly sighed as the vampire's eyes widened and then grew considering, lips twitching in obvious amusement.
The next night, after he was sure everyone had fallen asleep and Neville and Ron's snores were loud, he had brought everything out.  Everything had been covered in what looked to be years of dust and he had shaken the remnants of age out before settling down and looking through them.   There had been some clothes, slightly smaller than him and looking extremely old fashioned though well kept in the compartment, folded neatly.  He had only brought them out once and for some reason, he had gotten a half-uneasy, half-amused feeling from them.  He had quickly hidden them again, unnerved by the feelings the clothing caused.
“What?” he growled, glaring at the Slytherin.  He shivered slightly as a sudden gust of wind chilled the hall even more and he unconsciously stepped closer to the other boy for warmth. Harry looked down at the ivory hand holding his wrist firmly and dimly noted that despite their frigid appearance, the pale boy’s hands were actually quite warm.
“I’m sorry, I rather thought a night like this typically doesn’t include going to places considered to be fuel for nightmares,” Draco grumbled, resuming his walk and joining the black-haired teenager.
The last thing he saw before his fever claimed him was Draco Malfoy’s soft, silver eyes looking concernedly into his own and his last thought was wishing he could comfort him in his warm arms.
“I told you we shouldn’t trust any of them,” Qye scowled as he crossed his arms tightly across his chest and kicked the ground.  “It’s shit like that that goes us here in the first place.”
“Wanna go down with a fight,” Jacob grinned.  “I would’ve done the same thing if I were in their place.”  He rubbed his hands together, an eager light in his eyes.  “Fighting wizards…now that’s going to be something…”
‘Still, I better apologize for snapping at her like that,’ he thought as they entered the Entrance Hall with the other students, lowering the hoods.  ‘It wouldn’t be a good idea to get Hermione angry with me before the term has even begun.  Merlin knows I’m going to need all her help this year, with O.W.L.s and all.’  Since they were fifth-years now, at the end of the year they would have to take the Ordinary Wizarding Level exams and this year would no doubt be extremely difficult for him.
“Hey, don’t worry,” he interrupted, grinning down at the girl. “I’m sure it’s nothing, probably just need a bit more rest and everything will be alright when I get to the Infirmary, no worries.” He glanced at the silent vampires walking ahead of them and his impulses took hold once more.
“Maybe she’s finally going to take his suggestion from the beginning of the year and suck him dry?” a familiar drawling voice came from behind them. “Figures why the ickle Hufflepuffs wouldn’t say anything to him, too nice to give him the bad news.”
When she didn’t hear anything, she looked up to see her younger brother still in the same position he had been since early morning, staring blankly at the papers on his desk, his nails digging into his scalp.
Lest said nothing and Marylin probed a bit more. “Do you believe what he said? What Dumbledore said about Harry?”
Ever since Malfoy told him about Lest, things seemed to return to the way they had been before the two had formed a wary truce with each other. Though Hermione had done some minor research, proving Malfoy’s comments to be true, Harry still kept the same attitude as always with Professor Opacre.  He still wasn’t completely comfortable with her brother and thankfully only saw him at meal times, sitting next to his sister. He didn’t know why but he felt odd around the man and it wasn’t because he knew the vampire had killed wizards and vampires. It was just a strange sensation that coursed through him, oddly comforting and uncomfortable at the same time. He was beginning to consider avoiding the vampire altogether.
Once again, Harry could feel the strength of her magic and knew from the aim of her wand that the spell found its mark again. However, yet again, Lest stood in place, unmoving. The students shifted again but Hermione didn't let her shock hold her for long, moving to her next spell. Hermione's wand flicked over to where a small but heavy inkpot rested on a pushed back desk behind Lest and it flew towards him, aiming towards the back of his head.
Qye looked at the woman patiently sitting at the tea table while he slowly walked around the sitting room.  Smethwyck had taken Harry, leaving Qye as the first to have a session with the Mind-Healer.
“Please,” Harry whispered, trembling beneath Ron’s hands.  “Please, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, please don’t.”  Ron inhaled sharply as Harry abruptly fell to the floor, putting his face in his hands.  He went to one knee as Dean dashed out of the room, already calling out for Hermione.
"Maturation is a process every vampire goes through, both created and pureblood. Created vampires experience it as they turn so it's a quick thing as they inherit all their abilities during the process. For pureblood vampires, they all start it at the age of 16, during the end of their puberty. Females finish at 17 and males finish at 18." Here she paused and a smirk came onto her face, playful blue eyes glancing at her brother. "You know how guys are always late."
One of armor suits trembled and slowly lifted up.  Ron and the others flinched, warily taking a step back but instead of launching themselves towards them, the suits slowly rotated to face the vampires.
“Ron,” Hermione said urgently to him as he used his taller frame to look for the best route.  “Ron, the Point Me spell said - ”
“There’s a dance at the Three Broomsticks on Saturday,” Hermione said hurriedly, looking away from Ron and staring fixedly at Harry.  “During the last break at Hogsmeade.”
The vampires and Death Eaters stirred and even the Hogwarts wizards shifted uncomfortably as Lest snarled again, his power fluctuating around them, a heavy press against their minds, an unnerving flex against their skin.
"Fine, fine," he said absently, standing up with Ron and picking up his bag.  "Just thinking about stuff.  Sorry."  He flashed her a lopsided grin as she frowned.
“Bloody hell, why should I when I can just get someone else to do it?” muttered Ron.  Hermione narrowed her eyes even more but before she could say anything, Hagrid came over to their class.  She shot one last dirty look at Ron before sniffing and turning her full attention on Hagrid.  Ron rolled his eyes and looked at Harry in frustration.  Harry just shrugged at his friend and looked at his half-giant friend.
“Harry, Pomfrey’s right,” the brunette said worriedly. “What happens if your fever comes back and it’s worse? You should at least spend one more day there, just to make you’re really okay.”
His messy hair was still the same, the black locks falling into his face, shadowing his still-bright emerald eyes, gentle above a slender nose and a rosy, mouth curved into a natural pout.  His skin was no longer the pale cream it had once been but rather had a golden touch on it, as if he spent more time out in the open.  The boyish looks were gone, replaced with a youthful face that was growing up.  The young face, however, still retained that mature-beyond-his-years look that his boyish face had.
“Mind you manners, Draco,” she said, grinning while her light blue eyes danced.  “I can have you for PDA – public displays of adorableness.”
“I understand you are upset,” the man said mildly.  “And that you are affected by things beyond my understanding.  I will not pressure you at this moment to treatment you do not consent to but I hope you we can talk about it after Madam Pomfrey and I look you over.  My first responsibility is to your health and well-being and I would not be fulfilling that responsibility if I did not seek support for things outside my realm of my expertise.”  He raised a hand as Qye opened his mouth again.  “But we can talk about that later.  I know you have been through several ordeals, not including what has just occurred.  At least let us make sure you are physically okay.  Please.”
“’Patience is a virtue,’” Harry quoted and grinned at the glare he received for his quip. “You know, I hoped you two would visit to alleviate my boredom but this wasn’t exactly the visit I expected.”
She was looking at them from the corner of her eye as her other hand kept flicking armor at the students and the Muggle Studies teacher desperately tried to keep up.  Professor Sinistra lay unconscious as Hermione crouched over her, whispering something fervently as she helped deflect what the remaining teacher couldn’t.  He heard Professor Sprout shouting spells, saw the other adults darting to cover the other corridors, heard hisses of what could only be more beasts.
Hermione muttered and crossed her arms. “It’s stupid, they think you must’ve had a crush on him or something because you grabbed him and fell into his arms after you started screaming.” She snorted. “Honestly, these people are barely two years away from being adults…”
“I guess it kind of is the place to see around here,” Harry said, shifting on his feet.  His brows furrowed as Lest stopped right in front of him, still looking at him with that strange look in his eyes.  “Lest?”
“How did you know that, Harry?” Hermione asked him, a strange look in her eyes.  He opened his mouth to reply but froze.  Blinking, he closed his mouth.  He didn’t know how he knew.  He hadn’t really been concentrating on his answer and it just slipped out, like it was common knowledge.  But from the way everyone was looking at him, it obviously wasn’t.  He shrugged uncomfortably and looked back down at his plate.
He stopped babbling when he saw the two staring at him and Marylin raised an eyebrow as the tips of his ears turned red.
“You know,” Libby Wainscott said thoughtfully as she shrugged off her overcoat and folded it over an armchair, “when you, Abbie and I had lunch all those years ago and joked about that letter you would send in case of an unbelievable emergency when you couldn’t provide details, I never thought you would actually do it one day.”
To his surprise, Lest took the offered candy, his hand barely grazing Harry’s. The black-haired boy restrained a shiver that the contact caused and smiled cautiously at the older man.
Harry heard distant whispers of shock and confusion in the roaring of his ears, watched as Qye held his hand out stretched…
“I said I’m fine,” Harry interrupted, a bit harshly.  The brown-haired girl’s eyes widened, hurt clear in them as she leaned back in her seat.  She lowered her eyes to her plate and Harry immediately felt guilt wash over him.  Sighing, he ran a hand through his hair.  “I’m sorry,” he said quietly, looking down at his plate.  “I…I just got a headache.  I didn’t mean to snap at you.”
There was one horse, a small black one with large wings that had no one petting him.  It stood quietly, the closest near the Forest, watching the other horses with large, sad-looking eyes.  No one was even looking at it and Harry was walking towards it before he knew it.  He had seen this type of horse before.  When he had first seen the carriages again this year, he had seen them attached to this type of horse instead of being pulled by the usual invisible force that seemed to drive them.  He hadn’t thought anything about it, figuring Dumbledore must have his reasons.  The horse’s ears twitched, eyeing him as he walked closer to it.  A spark of hope seemed to fill those large, dark, sad eyes and Harry felt a twinge in him.
Lifting her head from the roll slowly, she met the eyes of the young black-haired boy.  She looked at him for a long moment, and then glanced back down at the roll sheet.
“Verna Zabar,” she said in her elderly voice, brushing her gray hair out of her brown face, her black eyes on the knitting.  “Representative of the Zabar family of vampires from South America, who are the next-in-line to be the Head family of the South American vampires.  Elder for the Zabar family of vampires, whose Heads are my son, Juan Zabar, and his wife, Maria Zabar.  Loyal to the Opacre family of vampires and on the side of the Opacres, as we will always be,” she finished, never looking up.
Watching him with searching black eyes all the while his head was killing him from Qye’s anger and Voldemort’s closeness, something trying to pry inside his head and then Voldemort had been there and after everything, the memories and fights and
Silence met his statement and he raised his eyes from his textbook to see Hermione and Ron eyeing him.  “What?” he asked bemusedly.
“Why not?” Malfoy said lazily back but Harry could hear a tinge of anger in his voice.  “He thinks about you, doesn’t he?”
“I’m going back to Hogwarts as I said,” Harry said, studying the lights and hoping Ron and Hermione wouldn’t ask any questions later.  “I’m asking you, again, to give me some space.  And if you can’t, then I think we know how this is going to go.”
," Ron snarled and water burst from his wand. Lest hissed and once again barely managed to dodge the jet, eyes flashing dangerously as he found his bearings on the now slippery floor around him.
Tapping the parchment, he watched as ink began to spread out on the yellowed parchment, the Marauder’s Map showing all of Hogwarts and the people occupying it. Shoving his hand in his pocket, he looked for the dot with a certain name next to it. A grin flashed on his face as he saw
“You’re assuming the children’s ideas about us can be changed,” Leon said quietly, looking at the cold blue eyes.  “Your whole plan revolves around people’s views about us being changed.  Do you know how unlikely that is?”
The fiery torrent continued to envelop him for a moment, shaking him down to his core.  He wanted to hurt Seamus more but…a moment later, he blinked slowly and the rage vanished.  A wave of dizziness hit him and he struggled to hide it.  Blinking again, he stared at the destruction of the anger.
The scene began to fade, began to be replaced with the picture of glided tables and sparkling chandeliers once more, the complete opposite of the place he had just been. He saw people standing, frantic, over him and found the scream coming from his own mouth begin to raise in volume once more.
The teenager stared silently at the wizard and Marylin swallowed, feeling her brother’s tension, wondering when to rush in, what to do when so much was unknown and –
"You have no wand and no knowledge of hand-to-hand combat, leaving you with no way to defend yourself," Lest said quietly, all trace of mocking and smirking gone as he looked at her. He glanced over to Professor Opacre, who was straightening from the wall she had been leaning against to watch the duel. "The duel's mine, Soror."
There was another tense moment and then Harry released another breath, easing out his anger, slumping back on the pillows.
Draco Malfoy.  He obviously detested the fact that Professor Opacre was here, his pale gray eyes watching the blond professor all the time with a hateful light in them.  In all her classes, he always made a point to drawl out a subtle insult to the blond vampire and never hesitated to try and make the other students less friendly towards the nosferatu.  Opacre often cut into the remarks before they could do any lasting-damage to her and although she took points from Slytherin House and gave him detention, he continued to antagonize the vampire.
Harry stopped playing with the bracelet.  “I think,” he said, just as quietly.  He glanced over at her and gave her a crooked smile.  “Seems I can never do anything normally, can I?”
“I wonder if the smell of Quirrell’s garlic is still around,” Seamus muttered as they took their seats in their last class of their day.  The Irish was sniffing the air hopefully and Dean rolled his eyes as he sat down next to his best friend.  Harry, however, noticed that Dean also sniffed the air when he thought no one was looking.
Harry looked back at him, studying green eyes like his, the stubbornness that matched his own will, looked into those eyes and saw that for all his certainty and determination, even with all his knowledge and experience beyond his years –
,’ he realized, eyeing the spinning globes at the ends of the beds that looked like the ones in Harry’s dormitory.  He slowly turned in place and saw dressers against the walls, a small table with two chairs beneath a high window clearly showing they were in a tower, and one door that was firmly shut.
Opening his eyes, he stared dully at the wall opposite of the bed, worry coursing through him. The other boy was still there, still in the back of his mind. He could feel him, feel that familiar close-by presence that always radiated from his mind. But…he was distant. Not distant as he was away, separated from him, but distant in consciousness. The only word that he could apply to what his state of being felt like was sleep.
’ Wincing at his intentionally mangled English, he looked around and spotted the said round glasses lying on the bedside drawer. Sliding them on, he looked satisfied as everything came in focus.
Harry kept an eye on her in every class, continually reminding himself that he hardly knew her and she might be an adversary.  Still…he couldn’t help but relaxing in her presence.  Her warm manner made him loosen up his guard and he was often at ease at her, despite his attempts to not be.  She seemed to have an interest in him, always making him stay a little bit after class to talk.  Harry flushed a little at this.  The other boys always teased about how Professor Opacre complimented his spells and how she would tousle his hair sometimes.  He was always surprised – and a little confused – as to why she did this but he said nothing.  Secretly, he kind of enjoyed the affectionate touches, strange as they were.
:: Harry said to Qye, looking at the easy features of the blond vampire.  Smiling, he looked his age rather than twice it.
His green eyes flashed but he didn't say anything to Qye - as it obviously had to be him - because it was okay, watching the vampire's face tighten.
The redhead snorted and picked up his Cleansweep, walking over to the other boy.  “I suppose I better,” he sighed exaggeratedly, wearily playing along with Harry’s charade.  “For all I know, you probably have your own hidden room somewhere in the castle just for the purpose of sleeping.”
“Gee, thanks,” he muttered, slouching in his chair.  Hermione grinned a bit and ruffled his hair.  His eyebrows shot up and he looked in surprise at her, along with Ron.  She blushed.
“Stay away from him,” Draco snarled, his wand in his hand.  He quickly strode towards them, face full of icy fury.
“I think this is something we really need to talk about,” Harry replied, as steadily as he could.  “If I’m going to listen to you, believe anything you say about the vampires I need to know you understand those types of actions are reprehensible across the board.”
:: Qye’s voice came in, like a broken record, his voice urgent and frightened and worried. Harry clung to the familiar sound, felt it draw him back to the better part of the world where he was screaming.
He spluttered for a moment, incoherently and vehemently denying anything and everything.  Unfortunately, he was unable to come up with a sensible response when an angry voice came from behind him.
“Are you really all right Harry?”  Neville asked to the right of him, his eyes looking at him nervously.  Harry sighed in frustration and rolled his eyes to the ceiling.
Harry stopped stirring, staring at the faintly amused vampire.  Inside his head, Qye chuckled softly.
’ he wondered as he stirred his potion, absently keeping count while he curiously looked towards the door.  Qye raised his attention from reading.
“So that’s what all the commotion was about this morning,” Ron grinned at Harry, his blue eyes laughing.  “I was wondering…”
Unfortunately, Hermione thought that his light moods weren’t light enough.  Ron obviously thought so too, judging from his eyebrow raise when he saw him again, but he was good enough to not say anything.  Hermione wasn’t as nice and had been pursuing him from the moment they stepped onto the Hogwarts Express, probing over how he was feeling and whether or not he wanted to talk.  Ron had tried to make her stop but had quickly given up when she gave him one of her looks.  Harry had put up with it for the entire train ride and most of the carriage ride but now it was beginning to get irritating.
“What makes you think that the wizards will help us in time of need?” the large man asked mildly, looking into the fire.  The disapproving look appeared to have disappeared but Jordan could still see traces of reluctance in his eyes.  It appeared Leon did not want there to be an alliance with wizards but was resigned to the fact that there would be one.
Pressing the palms of his hands against his eyes hard, he took in a deep shuddering breath.  His body shook and his stomach churned unpleasantly.  He swallowed back the bile that he felt in the back of his throat. ‘
do it all the time since it is rather draining to be focused on your immediate and distant environment at the same time. However, if you find yourself fighting a vampire, I suggest taking the assumption that they have the ability. Launch your physical attacks quickly so that even if they see them coming, they don't have time to react." She paused. "And I suppose that brings me to him knowing about the spell before she uttered it."
In his enhanced vision, he saw the teachers and proctors try to sort the students as a few other adults joined Dumbledore striding behind him.  He briefly felt the fear from Harry’s friends, felt their frustration at being blocked from leaving by one of the professors, heard Marylin whisper a quick reassurance before she followed Lest’s instructions.
Harry said, staring at the potion.   He glanced at the feather in his hand and slowly unclenched his hand.
Harry shook his head with his hand fidgeting on the strap of his school bag.  “No, it’s…it’s something more personal.”
The Slytherin snarled softly and grabbed Harry’s shoulder, making Harry face him.  The green-eyed boy glared at him, shoving Malfoy’s hand off.
“You feel a little hot,” she said as she dropped her hand and sat down next to him, her brown eyes full of concern. “Maybe you should’ve stayed in bed…”
but…well, the school year will be over soon.”  He smiled lightly at her.  “Who knows what that will bring?”
He looked down at his plate of scrambled eggs – which he had only taken a few bites of and was already full – and small piece of toast.  “Er…yes?” he said, confused.
Draco swallowed.  “And then they laughed,” he said hoarsely.  “They laughed because they said it was a good start.  They were just another family who got mixed up with vampires and an example of how it would work for their benefit.”  He was silent.  “They were a family and they died and my father
He gave her a look, to which to her credit she did not flinch at but merely frowned and turned away, presumably back to her own studying.
Harry walked into the Great Hall, wincing at the light and the chatter making his head throb. He tiredly made his way over to the Gryffindor Table where Ron and Hermione were already waiting for him. He just needed to eat something and everything would be alright. Qye snorted.
Lying on top of the books had been a ring with emeralds and sapphires.  The ring had looked extremely expensive and he wondered who would have just left it in the compartment.  He had looked at it often and for some reason, Professor Opacre kept popping into his mind.  The ring looked like something that would suit her and he idly thought that if she wasn't evil and bent on killing on him, he might leave it on her desk for her birthday if he couldn't find the original owner.
Draco said nothing to him as they sat in their classes, Snape watching them both sharply in every Potions class as neither spoke.
Harry didn’t say anything, looking hard at the vampire woman.  She had stopped smiling but was still talking with Dumbledore in low tones and he could almost make out her fangs when she opened her mouth.  ‘
Harry felt a strange calmness in his body, felt himself move back and watched as his hand lifted up –
Harry could hear his own heartbeat beating rapidly, matching the beating of Draco’s own beneath his fingers, echoing in his ears as he searched Draco’s eyes.  The silence rested heavily between them.
“You shouldn’t have gone through all this,” Hermione threw out fiercely and Harry turned startled eyes towards the suddenly glaring girl, her eyes still oddly bright. “If you had just listened to me and come to the Infirmary before you got that fever you wouldn’t have had such a high fever.” Harry dropped his eyes.
“Now, that’s a good welcome back,” she said cheerfully, smiling them and brushing back her long blond hair.  “Did you all have a good break from us nasty teachers?”
Qye jumped as Lest’s voice came behind him and he whirled around to see the vampire looking coolly at him.
The silence continued for another minute and when it was clear that no one else was going to speak up, the blonde rolled her eyes and crossed her arms.
Qye screamed and Harry finally opened his eyes all the way, rapidly blinked away the clinging exhaustion and forced his head to roll to the side.
Draco’s eyes shot open as well and Harry swallowed hard at the sight of his flushed cheeks and red lips, the glazed and heated look still in his silver eyes.  He wavered, disoriented, body instantly wanting to go back to that feverish haziness.
