he hissed to himself.  Fuck it, he could worry about public nudity after he wanked.  Unspooling a handful of paper, he let the memory unfold again, finding he could rewind it a bit.
Harry busied himself dusting his jeans off.  “Something like that.”
“Come with me,” he said, grazing his teeth along her neck. His strokes picked up speed as his hand rubbed her, supporting some of her weight.
She froze, back arched, and quirked an eyebrow at him.
She let out a breath she didn’t know she’d been holding and relaxed her thighs.  His mouth hovered over her collarbone while his fingers gently stroked her inner thighs.
“Bastard,” Ron mumbled.  “That’s low.”  Harry nodded, getting up for another bottle.
“Shh,
His jaw clenched, trying to stop the flood of vitriol burning in his throat. It didn’t help that she was just so close, laying under him. Gods below, how he wanted to collapse down on top of her and snuff his own tirade with her lips.
“None taken.”
She held up her mobile as evidence, not that the screen was anything but a black rectangle, but maybe it would distract them from watching her face crumple.
Of wars and men, of greed and spite
“That’s not fair,” she yawned.  “You should reapply.”
“I guess I’ll buy a cooler or something,” Harry muttered.
Harry nods dumbly and swallows hard. Draco saunters off towards the gents, catching a few writhing bodies in short embraces as he crosses the floor.
Harry drained his mug and stood.  “Then why don’t you tell me about them?  You’ve not only told Ron and Hermione, but shown them.”
She sat back and watched him, lips between her teeth.  “I want yours, too,” she said, leaning back in invitation.  “With his.”
“What’s . . ." Harry’s question evaporates as he opens the papers and sees St. Mungo’s letterhead. Terror creeps up his chest and neck in a pinprick rush. Long-ago Muggle adverts featuring emaciated gay men and a tombstone flit through his mind as his tacos threaten to purge themselves onto the rug.
————————
A hot flush rises up Harry’s neck, and his hands wrap around Draco’s hips to knead his arse. “Uhm, something wandless,” he says, clearing his throat. “Don’t bring your wand into it just yet.”
“Anywhere you
“She’s gonna be in Gryffindor,” Bryn announced, ruffling his dark brown hair through his fingers; the spitting image of his uncle Magnus.
“Yes, thank you.”  Metaxas’ hands patted his plaid suit jacket down for lack of a better purpose.  “The ICW travel sanction also applies to your Quidditch teams.  The British and Irish League will not be eligible for international matches or the Quidditch World Cup.  Not as participants, and certainly not as hosts.  Not until this… mess… is cleaned up.”
————————————
If he’d had a wall, Ron would have head-butted it.  “They were flirting, Harry. Often with you.  Think about who made all the jokes.”
“Hey, add a proper loo sometime.  Not all of us can just go outside.”
Ron perked up. “Yeah, signed on this year as the new head coach for the Bats.  Heard of him?”
He used to own limbs, but that was before Harry had slicked a condom and lube over himself and very, very,
“Oh, you did,
“Sounds like a done deal, then,” Ron said with finality.  “A couple new Weasleys.”
“There she is,” he muttered, inspecting the bite mark.
There were worse fates than a gorgeous monolith of a man who could fold him up like origami and set him on his lap, blissfully bloodbound and sedate.  That had always been rather nice, really, getting lost in the calm ebb and flow of Magnus’ mind.  And the years had been kind to Magnus Falk.
“See?  We will
“Eh, surprise me.  Did you feed Draco before you left?”
Her phone vibrated again, and she licked her lips.
This was a safety net and a soft landing.  This was the uncomfortable scrutiny of being seen with the bone-deep gratitude of being understood.  This was a laying down of the sword and collapsing into bed.
They’re so warm along his side, breathing against his ribs and his upper arm. The hand that holds them shifts to run fingers over their scales, but fur sifts between his fingers. One of the dragons sniffs his armpit, and he squirms, but holds it tight. A wet tongue flicks out to lick his armpit and earns a surprised laugh from him.
“Uhm…” Draco rubs slippery fingers against the pads of his thumbs. “It was what came to mind.”
Draco’s fist glides over the head of Harry’s cock, and Harry moans his approval. Hot, wet heat envelops his length before he realizes Draco has dropped to his knees, and he shouts in surprise.
The one that asked why the Ministry and Dumbledore had left him with the Dursleys.
He took a steadying breath to sift through the questions and cleared his throat. “Why did I leave?”
From “Writings in Exile”
“We’ve been discussing lighting this room on fire, little trickster,” Odbert replied dryly.  “That’s how little value it holds to Goblins.  In fact, you can help yourself whenever you like.  The ward will admit you.  We have better things to do.”
Draco twirled one of the extra baseball cards pinched between two fingers.  Visiting Azkaban really wasn’t a major hardship, and they knew it.  Minimum-security family visits meant it was just him and his parents at this conference table with two bored guards standing in the corners.
, you.” Harry leveled an accusatory finger at him with another one of those
.  And… you won’t see your parents again.”
Draco waited, chewing his lip, as Ron’s blue eyes flicked back and forth.  It was awkward watching someone review his unconscious mind’s thoughts.  He’d gotten used to filling Pensieve vials in front of Robards, but it had taken a few weeks for the uneasiness to fade.
“Chew toys?”
Crookshanks came running round the corner to flop pitifully in front of his food bowl.  To his dismay, she filled it with kibble and went to the front entrance to check her post box.
, Draco thought.  He’d been afraid of rejection through this whole dance.  The awkward preceding days, the tense last weeks, the contention of their youth.
Instead, Draco’s hands pulled him down against the other man’s eager mouth.  Harry’s surprised grunt melted into soft moans as Draco nipped and licked, fingers anchored solidly in his black curls.

With a lurch and roil, he high-stepped into the Wheeze’s lowest level and cast a
“Tell me about my bravery in the field, Captain Potter.”
She’d bundled up relevant memories from the phone call and leaving Harry’s, as well as a snippets of her relationship with her parents in Perth.  A good enough summary, she hoped.  It was a bit like assembling a research paper.  The Granger Family Dynamic:  A Meta-Analysis.
“What position do you want me to fuck you in?” he asked, watching her
Draco’s hips lean against Harry, and blonde hair brushes his cheek. “This arse is utterly defenseless, Auror Potter.” His hands slide down to cup Harry’s bum through his joggers. “And magnificent.”
His face fell, remembering what he’d called her before she’d said those words to him the first time.  Regretting her jibe, she lifted her hand up to his cheek.  He was so close, but now less eager.
“Don haste ye back,” she called over her shoulder, and he wondered if maybe he could get away with visiting less often.
Harry rounded the corner, wand drawn. “Bloody hell! Ron, no!”
——————————
Harry gasped as the point of view shifted.  The sudden riot of emotion and sound let Harry know that he was in Malfoy’s head for this memory, and he was uncomfortable.
“Wizards.  Vigilantes, basically,” Harry summarized.  The political factions that saw Malfoy’s death as the end or beginning of an era were a complicated lot.
Peeling his tongue from the roof of his mouth, he swung his legs out of bed.  He blinked slowly, shooting the clock a disapproving glare.
The memory abruptly cut off, and Harry frowned.  He was relieved, though.  It had been simultaneously too much and nowhere near enough.
So, I wonder as I take a bite out of the juicy pink center of a slice of watermelon, would it matter?  Would it matter if he did... if he
A hot flush of panic ran up his neck, followed by a cold sweat and goosebumps.  Harry was perfectly visible to one side, and the rest of the room to the other.  The Unspeakable was obfuscating his view of everything in front of him as it… she… stood directly in front of the table he and Harry shared.  Eerie.
Draco’s paws sink into the pillow as he turns once. Twice. And curls up into a cozy little powderpuff ball.
Ron had been following a pair of Senior Aurors who’d been called to investigate an orphanage for magical children.  He’d said the conditions were horrendous.
“Mm, that’s what I thought.”  His hand leaves my hip and presses into the mattress as he shifts, hovering over me, the duvet over his arse, like some obscene attempt at modesty.  “You don’t have to roll over, I guess.”
But Potter’s meddling was different.  It was always frustrating, and uncertain, and poorly-reasoned.
"I... I don't know where one stops."
Draco returned the grin, not certain Harry could see him. “Want a bite?”
“Fuck, fuck,” Draco chants in time with Harry’s movements.
greedy, did she care?  She shifted in her chair, arousal making itself known.
Of all the dreams Draco had shared, that one was probably her favorite, but perhaps just because it was at Hogwarts.  Or perhaps because of Draco’s patient, firm handling of the situation.  Downright judicial.

“Maybe a little.  But why
“The only proof I have is my lack of progeny and a Legilimens projection, if you want to see that.”
“Of course you didn’t,” he scolded.  “How royally, hopelessly, desperately fucked would Hermione Granger have to be to use a bloody Patronus to contact
Harry nodded, eager to get away from whatever magic this was.
No, not flashing.  Reflecting the light of Hermione’s mobile.  The hum of the phone had shook the egg into motion, and it rolled silently forward.  With a solid thud, it landed on the carpet.
She shook her head in disbelief.  “You dated
“Ah, surprisingly perceptive behind that matted mess you call a head of hair,” Odbert retorted.
——————————
Draco eyed him suspiciously and yanked his towel off, throwing it onto the bed.  “Booked solid,” he replied, cupping himself.
“Uhm, alright.  If you want to.”
“Can we have you, ‘Mione?” Ron whispered against her hair, gently grinding his hardening cock against her backside.  She leaned back into him, the solid warmth of his chest grounding her.
“Not my fault you hide behind your paper in a corner like a wanking pervert,” he said with a smirk, which earned him another swat.
Perhaps.  If they’d gone out to dinner, seen a show, maybe engaged in other activities, and had just recently gotten around to fucking and finding that egg.  And his… gift.
With a deep exhale, Harry thanked that quilt and let the section come to a close.  The next section sounded much less explicit:
Hips and shoulders,

Harry scrambled to kick the cards under the couch and cast a quick
“That’s… unorthodox, Potter.”  Shacklebolt grumbled as he waved down the approaching Aurors.  “But it
“Huh?”  Draco looked at him in soft bewilderment.  “Oh. No.  Kind of… souvenirs.  He had to leave because Granger got arrested sneaking drugs into Ministry HQ.  Something about trying to take them to Unspeakables?  I dunno.  I’m headed out to go talk to someone about it.”
A blurry form drifted between the bookcases; white on top, yellow in the middle, and black on the bottom.  Harry adjusted his glasses, which had somehow been knocked off on one side.
“In order to Potter about,” he began, hoping he could explain without offending, “one must repeatedly and casually throw themselves in front of trains with full trust that the train will stop.”
“And then they lit the Libidentia…”  Malfoy waited for her to scream at him.  “And… long story short, I would really appreciate it if he stayed under an Anti-Apparition Charm tonight.  Here.  Away from me.  Please.”
Harry nods, a weak salute half-hidden behind equally weak coffee, then freezes mid-motion. He gasps, lips against the lid, as a whip-thin line of heat lances around his elbow, just above the joint.
“Did I at least get the tail?”
his inner thigh. Warm water laps a slick line toward his groin, and he leans into it.
“A log or calendar or what have you,” he proffered, flipping pages in the book. “For a project, the Slytherins girls made a huge shared calendar in the common room. It was incredibly helpful.”
“May I add to the selections?” Draco asked, and waited for Harry’s nod of approval.
“Huh?” She turned around, and froze mouth agape. “I…”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” he exclaimed, as blue-white light drifted in through his window, coalescing into a stag.  “Potter, you utter fucking tosser!”
Tension wound tight through Draco’s hips, and Harry’s rhythm faltered. The hot breath against the back of Draco’s neck whimpered a final
The depth of his autonomy with this case was absurd, as well.  Robards had all but said Harry could walk in and kill Malfoy and not face charges.  Alternately, he could bust his ass and help Malfoy re-integrate into society, and nobody would give half a shit about that, either.
Talons locked on the railing, he settled into a comfortable roosting position. Fatigue pulled his chest down, and his eyelids drooped.
The front door of the Rookery snapped into view, and his stomach rolled.  The first muffin threatened to come up, but he forced it back down with a swallow of the second one.  His other muffin-filled hand knocked on the door.
********************************
“Definitely a wind instrument,” Draco replied, licking his other nipple.
“Fuck, ‘Mione, I do love watching that brilliant mind of yours leak down into your knickers.” He chuckled and braced himself, but she just stood next to the bed, eyes wandering up and down him.
“Well,” he said, swallowing.  “This particular mate is already rather at home in my nest.  And she’s very much in estrus, which is fun.”
Fingers gripped his lower thigh, tugging his knee up, and he let the hand raise his knee and set it back down onto something soft.  The hand, Hermione’s hand by the feel of it, did the same on the other side.  His anxiety abated slightly.
let’s not forget,
He stopped to glare at Onasis, grey eyes unblinking as the other man shrank in on himself and turned to leave.
Draco nodded, too quickly to be considered dignified.  His hole clenched with the slight movement, and he tightened his grip on the sheets.
“Oh, yes, dear,” Molly replied, moving on to the next recipe.  “Draco dropped off a rather… intoxicated and talkative Harry a few nights ago.”
He gave into the urge to mercilessly scrub his palms on his trousers.
“Better?” he asked.  He didn’t wait for a response before he slid back down to one of many pillows.  She nodded.
“It’s quite devastating, nearly a decade later,” she chided, biting her lip.  “He got
The chant in his head screeched to a painful halt.  What the
I wrap the robe back around myself and make for the kitchen.  Several plastic wrap-covered fruit plates sit on the counter, slowly suffocating to death.  They’re rather cheery, concentric quarter-rounds of various melon-slices, like dense-packed scales, but they need to go in the refrigerator.
“Draco,” he moans, but it means
“On it!” Ron barked, hopping up to open the door.
Finally locating the scissors in a bin of bric-a-brac, she froze as someone knocked on the door. Were people in Cardiff the type to introduce themselves to the new neighbor?
Harry grins and finishes his tacos and his margarita, then leans back in the booth to watch a grown man dig into a culinary inferno like a child with birthday cake. Under the music, he can hear Eric humming between bites, a tuneless, content sound that Harry wants to feel against his body. A sound that he wants to be the cause of, because Eric deserves to be this happy all the time.
“It is.”
His Mark was burning again.  It happened so often, that it was a reliable indicator that this was a dream.  Was it a dream with or without the added tattoos on his right arm?  He looked at the intricate black vines and delicate gray flowers that wound up his shoulder and extended in a fine tendril down the back of his hand.
“Famous Harry Potter!  Or should I say
Harry holds his hand out for the second potato, but avoids meeting Draco’s gaze, because it’s a heavier question than Draco likely knows. “I like not reading about it in The Prophet, for starters.”
Harry didn’t love the tone, and he looked up from his coffee to challenge Falk.  His eyes widened as Falk pinned him with the full weight of completely black irises.
“Huh,” Harry huffs, and feels a gentle tug on his ear. “That’s-“
“Mm hm.”
He smirked and knelt on the edge of the bed, water coursing enticingly down the planes of his chest, over his trim waist, and down his hips.
“And it’s incident-related,” Draco whispered, throat tightening.
“So that’s how you met Falk?”
She nodded with a grimace.  His power crackled in the air and rose the hairs on her arms.  Harry turned back to Ron.  “Drug manufacture, smuggling, controlled beast dealing.  What else Ron?  Crup-fighting?  Maybe something tame, like arson and murder, to lighten things up?”
Draco sighed, regretting his own word choice.
Neve assembled a tray and walked it over to the coffee table.  No,
“Shhh!”  Malu’s eyes grew wide, and she drew a finger across her neck, then pointed it at her twin.

“Yeah.” Draco half-sat on the ledge of the shuttered bakery window.
“Anyway, he sent them in February.  All proper,” Malfoy continued, vowing to give Granger an antique courting book, “and Narcissa slit the Thestrals' throats and-“
Don’t you dare.”

Draco dried his eyes a second time for good measure, and walked out to meet Ron, greeting him with a longer-than usual hug.
“Hey…” Ron drawled tentatively as he sat on the hearth and removed his shoes.

“Alright,” she said, putting her camera down.  “Want to lose the skivvies and wrap up?”
“Weren’t doing anything interesting you could involve yourself in, right?” Malfoy spat, letting go of Falk’s arms.  Harry was disappointed to see the color on his arms fade, especially when it was replaced with a furious glint in his grey eyes.
She glanced at her mobile while she walked, torn between investigating Cardiff’s small magic district or going back to her new flat.  It was still early, she noted with a shrug to herself.  Maybe Cardiff’s district had a good wizard pub or something.
“Why would I be interested in your proposition, anyway?” he said with a scoff.
Group projects had always been the bane of her academic existence.  Not because she minded being the one to do the whole project.  Not really.  But because she
His breath hissed in as images flooded his mind.
“I, uhm, thank you.”
“Harry, don’t-“  A loud crack cut him off.
“Alright, then,” Ron replied, leaning onto his knees.  “Mum’s got a whole list of furniture for me to take over to his… house?  We calling it a house?”
Update:  I have been persuaded to add, as an epilogue, a plot line that was cut from the original story.  I don’t have a time frame, but late 2021/early 2022.  Thank Wheezykat, and subscribe for an email notification if you’re interested.
He’d been bouncing off the walls for twenty minutes, and as hilarious as it was, she was starting to wonder if caffeine had some kind of intoxicating effect on Purebloods.  Maybe that was the logic behind the acrid red tea the Weasleys drank.
“No,” he muttered as he turned back around.  “But he’s from the Asklepion of Kos.”
“Standard parolees aren’t Death Eaters.  Confidentially, I believe the Wizengamot did not, and does not, intend for me to survive parole,” he surmised.  “I found myself out of Azkaban and wandless, Traced, homeless, and very, very unpopular.”  He gestured to the eagles circling the perimeter, who were in the midst of taking down an owl.  It thunked off the wards with a red and yellow smear.
“Want to see a trick?” he offered, hoping to wipe the pained frown from her face.
A tight whine came from Harry’s throat before he spoke. “I would.”
He nodded, eyes closed, head lax but neck tense as she stroked him.
They weren’t moving, but the bracelet burned with mad fury.
“Maybe

Draco’s arms flop to his sides, his chin tilts back, and he slowly topples over on his side, bouncing on the mattress like a felled tree. He log rolls to the edge of the bed, and stops, face-down, to groan into the sheet.
His hands hovered over her hips.  “May I?”

He caught movement and saw Potter waving one arm like a madman.  He was sitting atop a prone form with flame-colored hair.  Around Potter, the person, presumably Ron, was drenched in maroon.
Kept aloft, kept around.
“That was… fuck.” Harry rubbed his eyes behind his glasses.  “That was worse than the attack on Hogwarts,” he admitted slowly.

He was just some bloke with no sodding pants wanking in a park loo.
“Taking a nap. Apparently.” He stretches, and his jeans, possibly the same black jeans he’d worn before, slide down his arse.

The man dropped to his knees and straddled Draco’s hips. He tucked the blood-stained towel around his fist, drew a deep breath, and tensed.
“So, how’s the expansion going?” he asked, already guessing the answer.
Harry bit his lip.  “And you.”
Harry’s words come out squished and silly and perfect. “I’d love to.”
The decal of crossed wands and a red cross repeated on the other side of the handle, and on the flap of the tent. The caption around the rim read "
She sighed in concentration.  “Okay,” she said resolutely.  Harry pulled again, and saw a glint of gold between her parting folds.
———————————
“Country mouse problems,” he replied flatly.
This work started with a letter to you, and it’s only fitting it should end with one.
Harry cocked his head to look.  It wasn’t a small toy, if he had to guess the size.  But nowhere near his own girth.  Anxiety tamped his arousal down, even as Draco made some rather delicious little gasps and hummed groans.  He bit a cuticle and wondered, not for the first time, whether Draco would ever be able to slide himself onto Harry’s cock like that.  He shrugged to himself.  If not, not.
Ron concentrated very hard on the road in front of him.  “Oh.  So then you’re biased as bollocks, or maybe
“Uhm. Fire.” Harry nods toward the burning towels, eyes still on Draco’s groin.
, Harry mused, eager to get his clothes on before Basilia found an excuse to approach him.
“Well?”, he probed.
“But I want-“
“But not great,” Harry said, ruffling Felix’s hair.  The rest was unsaid, because Felix had heard it already.
Slowly, so slowly, his eyes traveled from the narrow end of the length, not noting any movement, up to the bloody stump.  Still not willing to look at even a decapitated Basilisk head, he shimmied out of his t-shirt and threw it over the end of the table with the head.
Draco’s lips were a resigned line as his head turned toward the bedroom.  “Instrumental or essential,
“I might have shown the German guys those pictures. Especially that second set. Never gonna be able to use that bat again without getting a boner on the pitch.” Brown eyes met Draco’s and he merely blinked. The man wet his hair and scrubbed his face with his hands. “They might stop by tonight for a little fun.”
Ron nodded.  “Right bit of trouble they’ll be.  Followed by a ginger menace and a very cute green-eyed hurricane.”

. Six to eight weeks in a wrist brace, or… probably five hours of being subject to a Blood magic bond with an occasionally unstable Healer with a dead sister and two insane parents,” he proposed in a rush. “I would not begrudge you if you took the Healing and flew off into the night.”
Hermione huffed, her interrogation having been firmly shot down.  It looked like maybe they were going to end up having dinner together after all.  She settled in at the table at the corner next to him and helped herself to a sandwich.
The bus stop was empty, and she settled in on a bench to look through the post she’d stuffed into her rucksack.

“Pansy, he wouldn’t.”
The stars faded, replaced by granite walls, a thick rug, and a vision of soft skin and chestnut curls.  He rolled over on her, intentionally graceless and clumsy.
The playfulness changing to regret made Harry smile.  Malfoy’s open remorse was a far cry from the self-justifying twat he’d known growing up.
, darling?  She may just say she’s getting fat.” She assessed her ragged, filthy fingernails with regal approval.
“Lovers?”  Harry offered, mentally straining to not blurt out
Ink-sodden paper gave way under the quill nib.  Letting it linger on the thick paper had given the ink just enough time to soak through a half-finished cock sketch.  Distraction abounded with an Auror in residence, and it had only been sixteen hours.  Not that he was counting.
Malfoy had a moment to assess the situation while Weasley decided whether or not to kill him on the spot. His instinct to draw from his back pocket for a duel impressed even him. Though this did end up rather silly.

“Thanks, mate.” Harry scowled.  “Like I was real thrilled with work before this crap.”
Black shoes today, and the scuffed toe of one bounces as Malfoy sits with an ankle on his knee, leaned back in his creaky wooden desk chair.  A long sigh elicits a squeak from the chair as he flips to the next page of the contract.
With pledge of me, a path to clear.

"Hm."
Ron and Harry exchanged satisfied glances as Ron’s hands crept higher under her shirt, grazing the lace of her bra.  Harry sat up to softly run his hands up the backs of her thighs, stopping just shy of her knickers.  His fingers delicately dipped below the edge of the fabric under each cheek, tracing the edge of her covered skin.
The eye simply watched him.  He tossed a small piece of Runespoor flesh, and the eye tracked it through the air as it landed in front of the Griffin.  It snapped it up awkwardly with the side of its beak and gulped it down.  The golden eye returned to him.
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.

“What position?”
“No,” Falk stated, “it’s not my place.  But you can get in touch with me if need be about the logistics of it all.”  He paused, turning to descend back to the field.  “
He sighed, a touch frustrated.  She wasn’t going to give him any straight answers about anything relevant.  How very appropriate for a conversation in the Hall of Prophecies.
The fans of the English teams wanted the Ministry to capitulate to the ICW’s demands, get the sanctions removed, and reunite the teams.  The fans of the new Scots-Irish League teams were rather alright with the new arrangement, and many of them had sided with the Malfoys today.
“Oh, I didn’t-“ Harry starts. “I should-“
He’s been hard too long already, and heavy heat builds in his groin as he moves in quick, hard strokes. Draco moans and presses Harry’s fingers against his lips. A slick, wet tongue slips between Harry’s fingers, and the tension breaks.
Draco yelps and clambers to his feet, satin still draped over his back and tail.
“I thought Harpies could use their words,” Ron chided.  “In fact, I thought they were pretty good at it.”
“How or why did you misspell both
—————————
He didn’t reply, studying his hands on the bench between them, instead. She rubbed her palms up and down his thighs, keeping his attention in the room, and in the present. Forehead softly furrowed, he looked up, grey eyes a mix of emotions.
Harry runs his hands under Draco’s jumper, under his shirt, and up his chest; ignoring the throbbing ache in his jeans.
Come home.
She stared at him in horror.  “I’m never arranging flowers again.”
,” he mumbled around another bite of oatmeal.  “I was a little concerned someone was going to get hexed in the bath.”
He leaned forward and rested his elbows on his knees. His breathing felt normal, but a fine tremor was starting in his hands.  Distant panic inched around his throat.
Hermione released his cock with a final swirl of her tongue, and he grinned down at her with a conspiratorial glance.  She turned to Harry, lips pursed, smile teasing.

“Pansy is better with hair than...” Lucius trailed off.  He flicked his hand dismissively.  “… whoever was cutting it before.”
Harry’s face fell, and he stood, shoulders slumped as he buttoned his jeans.
“I just want to get dressed, and then we can talk.”
“What are you two playing?”

was up a tree, and that was unacceptable.
”Ma biche.”
“No idea.  I should ask her that, though.  Hang on a sec.”  He tapped out a short message on his mobile.
“Oh!  I’ve seen pictures.  It looks amazing!”  Hermione swallowed the urge to hold the Portkey in both hands above her head and twirl while conjuring confetti.
The script was the same as the front of the envelope, and it gave him pause.  Where was Malfoy’s elaborate scrawling calligraphy?  And he was inviting him to a formal dinner?  Like the ones he’d seen in Magnus’ memories?
“Seer dream?”
“Bill!” Percy shouted, holding a bowl of cold stew and several bottles of Guinness.
“You got him for his tail. If they get startled, they drop their tails, and you wanted one for a new limb regeneration potion. You said the name might encourage him.”
“I’ll figure it out.”
And I'm a praise slut.
Luna’s pupils seemed to melt, the whites of her eyes receding in their wake.  She blinked glittering black eyes at him before turning her face to the ceiling.  “Oh… Rowena’s rump.”

Harry echoed his calming exhale.  He could do this.  “I want to fuck you, Dray,” he whispered, glancing up at Draco’s surprised expression.  “I mean, I want you to fuck me.  I mean, fuck.”
A split-second concern over his unmanicured nails was interrupted by her drawing her wand from the dress.  “

The wards reached their crescendo and quieted, but Harry had the distinct sensation of being enclosed underwater.  Godric, how bad was this going to be?
,” he croaked, half-begging, half-threatening, halting the game.
Draco wiggled his toes down into Harry’s crotch, ignoring a warning glare.
Draco froze and hazarded a glance at Neve, who was very obviously listening.
Harry’s face flushed, and he again questioned his decision to not stay dead.
Harry still knelt on the bed, Draco’s face lost under Harry’s ass, neck straining with his movement.  Draco’s shoulders were propped on one elbow as the other hand held the head of Harry’s cock loosely, not moving.
The Griffin whistled a middling note, and Ron decided that meant the beast agreed with his plan.  They’d been sitting in quiet companionship for a solid hour, and he’d come to the conclusion that either Griffins were much more civil than he’d been led to believe, or that this one was touched in the head.
He gasped when Harry’s hands left his hips, one to scoop under the front of his shoulder, the other to grab him by the hair and pull him up.  Pain burned from his scalp and pooled as tight arousal in his cock.
Grey eyes assessed him cooly.  “You’re on the verge of dithering yet again, Potter,” he warned.
A familiar bark of laughter cuts through the crowd from somewhere near the railing. Harry reaches over to pour the last of the wine into Eric’s glass, then lets his eyes wander the mass of people. Gringotts parties are notoriously lavish, but they’d toned it down this time. Muggle-themed slumming.
Draco hesitated behind him and whispered behind his ear.  “
“They’re chocolate,” Molly said, barely above a whisper.  She lingered in his bedroom doorway, strangely hesitant in her own home.  “I thought you could take them with you.”
—————————
His breath hissed in as she took him entirely, teasing a low groan from his throat.  “You’re in danger of being called ‘Weasley’ if you keep that up,” he said, low and hoarse.
“Yes, actually, since you’re here early, I’d love help putting a coffee table together.” Arm at the small of his back, she led him to the sofa, in front of which a flat-pack box lay like a modern Gordian knot.
Draco licked a long swath from Harry’s arse, up his balls, along the underside of his cock, and stopped to lay a chaste kiss at the tip.  Harry’s chest heaved, panting out wordless adoration.
Draco’s throat clicked when he swallowed, tight and dry. The Bludger, a human blunt instrument, stood on the other side of the thin glass door, a monolith of nude flesh.
By D.L. Malfoy
His fingers wrapped around the saffron-yellow length as he leaned forward and withdrew.  It was no small member, this one.  A rather round, blunt head, as well.
Harry’s fingers thread through the fur on his lap, and he’s not sure if he’s supposed to be sympathetic about Draco’s injuries or congratulate him on his Gringotts promotion. The entire promotion-by-combat system is beyond bonkers, despite Fleur’s wine-fueled, half-French lectures on Goblin culture.
” they both warbled.
Why spend your life in memos,
Harry had briefly forgotten Malfoy must have learned about the Russian Quidditch practices while hiding or on the run, not on some kind of international sporting tour.
“Okay, now I’m done. I think. Unless it doesn’t work.”
.  I owe this Auror some very delayed gratification, and I think you’ll like the show.”
Harry’s cock throbs at the words, and he settles in behind Draco on the rug. His body is too hard, and Harry touches him as gently as he can. His hand runs over the soft t-shirt, grateful for the barrier between his calloused fingers and Draco’s paper-thin skin stretched over bones.
The placard on the desk still had his name on it.  Perhaps if the Head Auror Floo worked, that was enough of a sign.  If he had to take the lobby Floo home, that would cinch it.
“Yet,” Burgock stated with a wink, sliding the box in front of Malfoy.
The tawny fur on the bottom half of its body was matted with blood.  The eagle feathers on the top half hid precise knife wounds.
“The drug potioneer?”
“Right. Oh, and they aren’t interchangeable.” Draco scoops the earrings out of the box and cycles through holding each one in an ear and rubbing another along his sleeve. “This one is for his left. This one for his right.”
“I think,” she mused, rubbing her chin against his shorts, “that you may have to take these divine little pants off.”
” Draco blurted, still shocked.  “
Adams practically tip-toed past Harry to step up on the hearth, and was gone in a green whoosh.  Odd reaction to authority, that werewolf.
Disbelief cascaded out of him, and he followed Harry’s laugh with his own. “Not ‘what kind of spectacularly elaborate fuck?’, but ‘what’s her Animagus form?’ I guess I expect no less from the piano swot.”
Hell, it’s what had gotten him a date tonight with a hot new Auror recruit.  He’d liked that she was bold enough to ask him out for drinks.  More accurately, she’d threatened to drink him under the table, which he found immensely more appealing than chatting and sipping lagers.

“Who’s willing to go full monty today?” Basilia oozed, licking her lips.  Gods below, Harry hated this woman.  He glared at her and stepped away from Falk and off the platform.
“You certainly do.”  Draco drew a deep breath in through Harry’s hair.  “
“So fucking tight, Harry,” he whispers.
Godric’s gonads, he should probably either go back to bed or loudly clear his throat.  Either or.  His cock was apparently voting to stay and watch, but he had no intention of releasing it for the show.
In a week, he could slide his hand into those boxers and just
“I think you already have.”
“Right,” Draco huffed, biting his lips.  “There’s more, though.  Furniture.”
A soft knock sounded through Harry’s office door, and he cringed.  Opening the door would expose a bit of a scene.
“Weird, though, right?” Ron asked, wondering if he wasn’t feeling the appropriate amount of enthusiasm.  He’d only wanked to thoughts of her for, say, most of his life.
Malfoy huffed in annoyance and tossed the box back and forth between his hands a few times.  Something solid thunked against the cardboard with each catch.  Harry watched Malfoy’s hands intently, vaguely jealous of the bakery box.
Ron sat, but eyed the man at his desk warily.  How long had he been just helping himself to the Wheeze’s bookkeeping?  And how did he get back here?
Hermione’s anger dissipated.  “What do you mean the owls never return?”
“Well,” he started with a sigh.  “There are two parts.  The one Hermione sold the Committee and Wizengamot, and then the second phase I’ll start in my last year as Head Auror.”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake.”
And I'm a praise slut.

“He may have been taken to another floor for testing. I’ll find out. Give me just a few minutes.” She nods and leaves without waiting for his response.
Harry chuckles and nods toward the ashes that used to be towels.
Gods, what a busy, wonderful, exhausting, sexually gratifying weekend.  Much more satisfying than her best bar hopping and house party prowling had been in Perth.
“How long have you lived here?” she asked, still stroking small circles with her thumbs, noting a growing erection behind the thin fabric of the shorts.
So… Close now.  Stop?
——————————————
Sliding a red and yellow knit bookmark emblazoned with her name in her page, she closed the book and stretched.  Her mother had taken up knitting a few years ago, and awkwardly-curled, never-quite-flat bookmarks had been one of her first projects.  They weren’t pretty.  And they weren’t especially functional, but they were a bit of family she could take with her.
She thought of him putting his hands on the mattress on either side of her head, and starting to move, thrusting gently at first.  And then he would drop down onto his elbows along her sides, and press her into the bed with his weight.
That would be a fun thing to work into casual conversation.  So, platonic parolee, any interesting dreams lately?  Totally normal conversation for two blokes over tea.
Draco sighed so hard, his vision swam.
“Break up?” Malfoy guessed.
“Alright, fine.  I’ll find another way to send these to the Ministry,” she flicked the letters in her hand for emphasis.  “And I’m sorry for snapping at you.  Again.”
Ron opened his mouth and closed it.  This was the vault of all vaults.  Every armoire, and there were many, was stuffed to spilling with clothing.  Every desk overflowed with ornate ink pots and rare quills.  Every square foot of the Quidditch field-sized room was covered in layers of thick rugs.
Unexpected, unwelcome intimacy warred against the desire to soothe the vulnerability in those kisses.
“I’m not going to
She pulled back, and Harry handed her a wad of toilet paper.  Accepting it with an embarrassed but grateful smile, she wiped her face and blew her nose.
“Do you know how long I’ve tried to get monkey puzzle wood!” Harry’s almost to the tree, and his fingers reach out to touch the tip of a branch.
Draco hummed noncommittally as he glanced out the window, eyes unfocused.  “No, you assumed that, Harry.  He generously omitted the right mess I’d made of myself.”
He spotted Malfoy, who appeared to be talking to a potted tree, but was actually speaking with the Goblin standing in front of the pot.  The Goblin was entirely naked, and Malfoy didn’t seem to notice.  His black shirt was still buttoned, in stark deference to Harry’s half-undone, sweat-stained shirt.  Maybe this side of the room was hotter?
Malfoy examined him, eyes coming to rest on the bracelet.   Harry’s gaze had settled on the wad of gauze between the other man’s fingers, and the small knife held casually between two fingers.  He half-expected him to bring it to his lips and take a long drag from it.
Harry’s jaw clenched.  He had thought that Malfoy not having children had been his own idea.  It had made sense the way he told it.
Harry barked a laugh and threw his mobile on the foot of the bed.  He shoved Draco onto his back and rolled on top of him.  “At least she doesn’t call me a fucking pig.”
He trusted Luna. She was his
Malfoy had grown bored and a little envious of everyone’s terribly important and busy schedules, found a box labelled “Books, A-F, 2005”, and was busily snooping. Her damn cat kept throwing himself underfoot like he

“I did.”
With a soft growl, she ground down against him and climaxed in a throaty groan that made his body tense and follow hers.  He throbbed inside her as her core gripped him, clenching and unclenching with the soft sway of her hips.
“Uh… Okay.”  Ron wasn’t sure what that implied, but the humor coming through the bond from Malfoy was unexpected.
It’s just school, be home by snow.
, Malfoy.”
Looming realization made Harry pull back from Falk’s memory.  There were so many memories of Malfoy with children. In several of them, he’d looked like Arthur at a Weasley family dinner.  At ease.  And content.
Was his not-husband blushing? Maybe. A bit. Draco licked his lips and leaned a hip against the counter. “I’ll bet you were a sore loser.”
. Anyway, I’m fixin’ to clean it up, but child, you owe me.”
And then they would come home to roost.  But then they would leave again.  They would leave and return, over and over, and he’d watch these pieces of his soul drift about the world while he waited.
“We’re open to a collaboration with the Ministry, provided their employees are willing to absorb the international transfer and currency conversion fees.  It will likely result in a significant delay and decrease in pay for Ministry employees, but if we can help, we will.”

“So, would you like to explain why you summoned me in the most urgent way possible for me to find you lounging unscathed in a park?” he drawled.
With that, Potter rose to clear the debris from the coffee table, leaving Draco alone with his thoughts; least favorite of companions.
“Yeah.  Didn’t know my Animagus spell worked till I was mid-air over the Sea of Okhotsk.  Anyway, dreams.  So, I started having dreams about eaglets.  No big deal.  I was hiding with eagles.  Made sense.  But then they started turning into humans.”  Malfoy took a deep breath and shut his eyes.  “And now they’re humans every time, and they have faces and I think they might have names, and two of them are fucking real and Firewhiskey sounds like an amazing and terrible idea.”
Harry belted a laugh and kissed Draco’s temple. He nipped at Harry’s jaw, nuzzling in. Harry’s laugh melted into an eager whimper under Draco’s lips.

Arms wrapped around his waist from behind and her face pressed against his back.  She exhaled a long sigh between his shoulder blades.
“What about it?” she asked, trying to hide her pout.  “You’re Veruca Salt and you have a golden egg to prove it?”
—————————————
“Fuck it.”
The thumb stopped, and Harry’s back tensed.  Draco held his breath, waiting.  Harry’s hand slid up behind Draco’s head as his shoulders rose.  Their lips found each other in a slow slide of warmth and soft seeking.  A quiet, tentative, giving and receiving.  A mutual respite for consideration.

The reporter lets out a mortified shriek and claps his hands over his half-exposed groin, but not fast enough for Harry to notice he’s not wearing underwear beneath his trousers. On the floor, the fox has his teeth dug into the man’s trouser cuff, and is attempting to drag the reporter down the hall.
“You have vices, at best,” Ron said conclusively.  “I’ve got like, one thing to take care of on the way out, then you wanna blow bedrock up at the Burrow?”
He kissed the top of her head, straightening up.  “Give me 30 seconds, and I’m game to try.”
Bute Park was quickly becoming her favorite place to relax in the afternoons. This August afternoon was especially lounge-worthy. An unusually warm breeze and sunny sky reminded her of Perth in May, and there was no way she could waste such rare weather.
“Makes a man resort to begging in rather short order, I’m afraid.” He clicked his tongue in mock disapproval with a soft shake of his head.
I’d love to be a martyr, for any cause but this.
He got up on his knees, dramatically wrapping it around himself like a cape.

He’d rehearsed dozens of ways this conversation could go, but had always known it was pointless to plan.  The two of them were masters of diversion and denial.
Nothing etched but date and name.
“Give us a call soon. Love you, kiddo. Mom.”
“I’m sorry, I forgot-“ she started, but he cut her off.
Robards shrugged.  “A little, yes.  But I’d have chosen you even if you weren’t photogenic,” he tried to joke.
It’s happened once, it’ll happen twice.
Slowly, Harry opened his eyes and propped his head on his hand. “I take some blame for that.”
He was either avoiding her gaze or studying her breasts.  Equally likely scenarios, really.
, might I invite you to fuck me in the near future?” Draco said carefully, as if he were reciting a tricky spell.
Standing, he slipped his phone in his pocket.  “Should be here in 20.” He turned to see her in the doorway.
Adams shrugged and took the chair at the foot of the dining table, attention on his mobile.  “So long as you don’t have an escape hatch or a wand, have at it, mate.  Granger says she’ll be Flooing in as-“
It’s an awkward angle; there’s not enough space between them. Harry pats Draco on the arse and says, “Stand up.”
” He shrugged, eyes closed.
*********************************
His cock leaves a wet imprint on his pants as Draco pulls it free and wraps his hand around him. Harry’s hips jerk forward into Draco’s grip, and Harry already knows it won’t take long.
A come-coated fingertip breached his entrance, and he groaned, low and greedy.  Her finger slicked more drops into him as he panted, cheek plastered to the leather with sweat.
Edging closer, she gripped the back of the highback chair, knuckles white.  He wondered if she was strong enough to beat him to death with it.  It was looking like a possibility.
“It’ll be more than enough.  I put so many on Bill and Fleur’s chalet that they couldn’t crack eggs for breakfast their first morning.”
Much happier I’d be.

He sits up, but he leaves his soul on the bed, breathing flower petals to counter the stench of my bullshit yet again, and my soul sinks through the floorboards.
“Anything, little trickster.  Anything.”  Odbert Vanished the entire bag with a single touch, and started toward the door.  Ron watched his back, a long-fingered hand coming up to wipe his eyes.  “We will owe your house an honor debt for generations.  What are a few instruments?”
“Oh, Merlin’s tits, Crooks!” she shouted.  “Give me those!”
He laid back down, lacing his fingers behind his head.  What if it wasn’t vigilantes?  What if it was one of the Death Eater revival groups?  Those reprobates would
Their eyes met, and they both smiled.  Him, nervously.  Her, expectantly.  She lifted her head to nip his ear and whisper, “Fuck me, Harry.”
“Why did you come here, Hermione?” he said gently, but she could hear the annoyance under his concern.  “You were in bed between men who would have done anything for you.”
Ron was still in disbelief that the exchange Harry described was real.  The Hermione he knew wouldn’t just ask for sex.

Ron chuffed a laugh and ruffled Harry’s hair.  “Slagpipe.”
Ron focused on Malfoy and felt the lie in his threat.  The man was practically euphoric having a comb running up his scalp.  Euphoria and… grief?  Ron tried to not dissect that.
“Mm hm.”

Medea’s mons, his dream had led him to a fucking crystal ball.  Or would be, once it was shined up, which Ron was already doing.  “I’m not sure.  But leave it in the wall.  I don’t think it’s supposed to come out.”
Pleasure ricocheted through her body as he angled his hips upward and gave one small thrust.  Muffling her scream against his shoulder did nothing to quiet her as her core squeezed around him and her hips ground in time with it.  Gradually, her body relaxed its hold on him and let him begin to move.
Godric.  Pregnancy?  Or… not?  She’d already memorized the schedule of the clinic close to campus.  That was the logical solution for a law student, wasn’t it?  The responsible solution?
“And masturbated in the sink.”
“About what?” Harry asked, eying the chips.
“Oh, that’s bollocks.  Why’s it got Hermione’s name on it?” Ron asked.  She didn’t give him a bracelet.  Now he wanted a bracelet, dammit.
Nonsense.
“You know, if your whole,” Draco flicked his fork in search of words, “system had been in place, you’d have been raised a Weasley.”
Potter heaved a sigh and slipped his mobile into his pocket and lingered next to the window.  Early morning light cast a long shadow across the floor that climbed the back of the sofa.  Steam from his mug shone golden as he lowered it from his lips, and Draco watched the tendrils waft up toward Harry’s jaw, only to be puffed away with his breath.  Far different from the Gala’s clouded room and golden shimmering drinks, but reminiscent.
“Why change course now?” he shot back.
She turned to look at him with a wink.  “Have at it.”
Draco’s breath hitches and leaves in a long, slow exhale, and Harry waits, panic inching up his skin in a prickling wave. A moment passes, and another, and Draco takes another breath.

Draco grinned and snatched up the knife.
“How old?”
“And here I thought you’d brought me something.  Mum’ll be thrilled.  You are her favorite son, after all.”
“Oh, I…”  He lifted up and stopped, gauging Harry’s intent.  Draco’s eyes widened in surprise.  “Oh, Potter, you wonderful sick fuck,” he chuckled.  “I fucking love you.”
, will get me out of that unscathed.
He cocked an ear toward the living room as the Floo roared back to life. Ron’s aforementioned return trip. And Harry was down in the spring, oddly quiet with no audience.
“He’s fucking left-handed,” she whispered to no one.  Merlin’s manboobs, he’d written all his coursework in right-handed fucking calligraphy, when he was actually left-handed.  And had he learned to use a wand in his non-dominant hand, too?
Harry gingerly sipped from his bottle.  Last night’s hangover was a doozy.  “Percy, how’s Level Six treating you?”
Waves of pleasure ricocheted from his ass down his cock at every motion her finger made.  The finger changed angles, stretching him slightly, and he spread his knees wider in anticipation.
“Your family is part of the world.”  He squeezed her tight and drew a long breath through her hair before releasing her.  “Go on.”
The ring of seeds in the watermelon slice is just too much damn work, so I pick up another slice and bite the heart out of it.
“I mean, I-“ he started.
“They’re already on the hearth rug, aren’t they?” Ron asked gently, looking down at the blond hair splayed out on his shirt.
With a sigh, he gave up on reading and shuffled to the kitchen to make tea.  His hands moved by memory, but his mind drifted to the twins.  The twins, and the other two children in his dreams.
Harry snorts a laugh and uncrosses his arms, hands on his hips. “Dramatic outbursts, too.”
Harry’s voice had a sleepy drawl to it when he spoke. “You had a bit of a tantrum about it, and-” He yawned and Draco did the same. “You used that curse and fucking flayed yourself in front of the DMLE administration. And me. Entire chest, and the one arm. Just… poof, nothing but one big wound.”
“I think I can kiss it all better, but you’ll have to lay very, very still,” he said sternly.  “And not come at all.  No matter what.”  He punctuated his prescription with a quick flick of his tongue up her clit.

Shacklebolt waved a hand dismissively toward the remaining Wizengamot members.  “Settle on an appropriate response.  This has gone on entirely too long.”
“Pin the tail on the wards?” Harry asked.  Ron and Malfoy shrugged, not getting the reference.
He frowned at her overly familiar use of his name.  Disinterested, he watched her work on him with some tiny spelled comb.  She was fairly attractive, really.  Bobbed blonde hair, clear blue eyes.  Pity she held all the appeal of Baba Yaga.
Harry nodded, grinning.  He’d seen Malfoy’s doodles in class, but didn’t know he’d graduated to elaborate erotic art.  It was unexpectedly funny for someone who’d always come off so uptight.
She appeared healthy, he thought.  She just looked… sad?  Bored?  Could birds feel ennui?
He never got to see a face, or many defined features.  Just silken white hair or down-covered heads racing about.
mind her group members slowing her down.  Doing five people’s worth of work was no sweat.  Doing it while having them offer worthless feedback and lie through their teeth about contributing made her break out in a clammy mess.
Draco’s fingers flexed, digging into the pillow, and he whimpered softly.  She reached down to brush his hair away from his face, and his brow furrowed, dreaming.  His fingers clenched again, and she swore the flowers in his tattoo were an iridescent silver for just a moment.
The Unspeakable was watching him this time.  He was sure of it.  The candy nudged toward him as a reminder.
He slid it back to Ron over the shiny tabletop.  It looked like it’d just been polished that day.  Draco stared blankly in Ron’s general direction, and he waved a hand in the other man’s field of vision.
Harry’s hands found Draco’s hair and tugged gently in a steadying grip.  His hips locked, and he came with a hoarse shout.  Draco’s fingers worked inside him with one hand, along his shaft with the other, pulling wave after wave from him as he swallowed Harry down.
“Thank you.”  Harry’s arm squeezed Draco’s shoulders.
“Why am I terrifying,

“…bet against the Bats.  They just signed Falk on as head coach, and he doesn’t-“
“We’ll follow you.  Never return here.  Stay with us if you choose,” he added.
Molly rolled her eyes.
The mattress dipped behind her as Ron laid himself along her back.  His arm slid under her head, and Harry felt Ron’s fingers ruffle his own sodden black curls.
Toweling off, Harry asked, “So why would your family give it up?”
“He made me do test patches on the backs of the cushions with different cleaning charms before taking care of… a bit of a mess.”  A dumb grin split his face.  “Anyway, feel free.  At least you got the Weasley breakfast spread today, though.”

Ron laughed and clapped his hand on Harry’s thigh.  “Lovers play-fighting, Harry.  How the hell did you think they ended up in the wrong ties that morning?”

“Oh… okay,” she whispered, releasing his fingers.
He became aware of her watching him as he finished licking the center out of the truffle. He finished it and quietly licked the pads of his fingers and thumb.  “Jealous?” he asked in mock innocence.

“Right! Malfoy, Owl me if you broke a tooth on that bloke.”
"Yeah.  See you, too."
Harry nodded and kissed the tip of Draco’s nose.  “Mm hm.”
“That sounds fair.”  Harry swallowed thickly and wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist.  “I- I kind of liked you in it.”
The man swore under his breath, flicked his wand, and yanked the door open. With a furtive glance around the still-sleeping street, he hustled Draco inside and up the stairs.
“Oh, okay,” she replied as she wiped tears from her eyes before they could fall.  It didn’t count as crying if she caught them before they touched anything.
“Soft,” Jensen scoffs. “They’ll just keep brewing it if the users are-“
“Perhaps…  After all… This child is a hat st-”
Draco rested his elbows on the coarse granite of the ledge.  The rough stone scraped his skin as Harry stretched him open again, faster this time.

Ron snatched the menus Hermione had left on the counter and flopped down on the futon.  “You can’t tell me you’d have known AstraNox was illegal if I’d have asked you about it.”  He poked Harry in the ribs with a shoe.  “Honestly.  Rocks, Floo powder, and a gag gift from the store?  And you know damned well I wouldn’t send ‘Mione in to take the fall.”
Smut.
To the left and right of the front of the room were boxes with dozens of glossy wooden chairs in them.  He’d assumed they were meant for juries, but one of them today had placards for the members of the Wizengamot Committee on Wizard Rights.  But he’d also assumed that only Wizengamot members were on the committee.  He was about ready to be done making assumptions.
The woman at the newsstand had started snoring in honest, and it nearly drowned out the whisper fight Luna and Pansy had started.
Good riddance.

It was enormous.  Nearly a room unto itself.  The frame was low, but nothing special.  The mattress, however, was a smooth, almost-too-hard, feather-packed expanse that curved up gently around the edges and wafted a delicate, sweet, earthy scent.  He didn’t like to admit it, but it was very reminiscent of a nest, and he suspected the feathers weren’t from ordinary birds.
Her fingers pulled out, and a third one slicked along his crack, gathering moisture.  The three tented fingertips pressed against his entrance.
? Unexpected.” A soft frown washed over his face as he brought his cut to his lips. A soft whine of Healing, and he removed it.
“So…” she led.  “What do we do about it?”
A hand waves in front of him, and he follows it to find Draco standing just to his left. His other hand has a firm grip on one of the floating trays of food, which is valiantly struggling against Draco’s grip. The hand that caught Harry’s attention busies itself by shoveling wild game into Draco’s lipsticked mouth.

“Bloody fine welcome,” Ron retorted as he felt the outside of his bag for leaks.  “No wonder the Ministry’s not sending you flowers and chocolates.”
“You really shouldn’t Apparate on

Scourgify his way to a hostile takeover of Truro, but giving him the benefit of the doubt also seemed honorable.
The blue-white orb swirling in the middle of the room surprised her.  It was much larger than she remembered.
“I didn’t miss it.”
She snorted, and he bristled at the sound.  Rude.  “What?!” She barked.  “No!  Your family would never let them take you, even if they tried.”
.”  Draco shuddered.  “I haven’t dreamt of death since Durmstrang.”  He huffed in surprise at his own admission.  It really had been that long, and he hadn’t noticed.
He pondered the implications as he climbed the stairs to the hatchery level.  A strange scent wafted down the stairwell, stronger the higher he got.  Not a bad smell, but not the usual hot metal and lizard stink.
Vaguely, he heard someone yelling.  A man was yelling his name.  Potter.
Draco glared up at him as his teeth dug into Harry’s thumb, daring him to release his grip.  Harry shook Draco’s chin gently.  “You have a filthy mouth, you know,” he whispered with a soft smile.  Draco hummed his agreement and prodded under Harry’s thumb with his tongue.  He let Draco resume sucking it, his lips replacing the hard grip of his teeth.
And it
“Me, either,” Harry said again, still looking out the window.
Draco is not happy, confronts ex.  Harry shows up and fucks things up, because of course he does.
Silver glitter covers Harry’s shirt and hands. He licks his lips and is fairly sure there’s glitter in his mouth, and if there isn’t, he wants there to be.

“They sentenced Lucius to the Kiss.  Tomorrow morning.  It was unanimous.”
“I’m going to Apparate out.  You’re sure you’re okay?”  He was still somewhat incredulous.
“Something she said has bugged for years. Something like, ‘It was safer in the dungeons. We kept our teeth.’ And that didn’t make sense till a couple weeks ago.”
Some kind of early dark wizard detection system, Draco suspected.  It would have to be relative to the war for the Minister and Wizengamot to have approved of whatever Granger had been whispering about in the courtroom.  Or something flashy.  Loud.  Explosive.
Harry looked up slowly and chewed, green gaze wary.  “You okay, Malfoy?”
A slim white file stood out amongst the other colors.  “Malfoy, D. L., Jun. 5, 1980, #58720”.
Luna hissed.
Ron looked at each of them in turn, and stood to leave the table. Harry watched him, worried Ron was jealous of his conversation with Malfoy. Ron returned with the bin and began clearing the table.
“Things are… gone.  Generally speaking,” he replied, stifling a bitter chuckle.  “And this is my last visit.”

That was surprising.  And heart-breaking.  The boy didn’t even hold the illusion of having a mother anymore.
A wry smirk graced Potter's clean-shaven face.  "A little, hm?"
“The old mines under the Manor?” Draco said, baiting Lucius.  “Odbert
“Fuck, I love you, ‘Mione.”
She hummed, whether in agreement or pleasure, he couldn’t tell.
“Oh, shit.”
“Do I want you to what, ‘Mione?”  He returned his mobile to the ledge and settled in to tease a witch.  Maybe a wizard, too, if he came in.  That would be exceptionally fun.
Perhaps by dawn, less to dwell on,
The rhythmic slide of worn leather skimming over the marble floor was the only sound in the quiet room.  Luna smiled, feet swinging.
He lays back on the bed, feet still on the floor, and stretches, like I’m tedious.  Like this is tedious.
Looking around the room, he didn’t immediately find Malfoy, which was surprising.  He was the tallest person by several feet.
But nine years in Perth with her parents.  Nine years helping them remember her, even if just a bit.  Nine years and two Masters’ degrees.
“He’s fucking huge.”
He stood first, and pulled her to her feet.  “The world needs you,

And his favorite,

is not a cute term, Harry.”  He pinched the bridge of his nose as he snuggled into a pillow, already resigned to perhaps
Malfoy lies about his lies to his parents.  They're still awful.
The watermelon slices are already getting a bit mushy around the streak of seeds through each piece, but the centers and rinds are good.  The sweet, pink center and the hard, bitter rind really have more in common than the seedy bits between them, and I really hope I didn’t offend Hermione.
“Maybe not me, precisely.  But knowing what I’ve done doesn’t help, does it?”
“Under the Vow. And we split tents after that.”
“And the other…” Cassandra scoffed, leaning back in her chair.  “Or is it others?  Plural?”  Her eyes narrowed in accusation.
Maybe Wheezes would be selling pocket-sized crystal balls this year.  On chains, as necklaces.  A whole jewelry line?  Crystal ball betrothal jewelry would sell itself.  He ripped off a corner of blank sketchbook page and found a Muggle ink pen on the counter to jot the idea down.
I don’t care if he’s sleeping, find him!
“I…” Draco started, no intention of finishing the sentence.  At least Molly had given him cake when she pinned him into this corner.
Silence, broken only by the dripping of water, filled the space.
“Jesus Christ,” Harry whispers. His fingers dig in, and it’s perfection. “Should have shown me this arse in sixth year.”
“I’m eighteen,” the man replied. He’d started making a little show of moving his hips in time with the blaring music.
A clatter of metal tools and bland almost-expletives echoed from the fireplace.  Having Percy Weasley know where he lived was bad enough, but if someone had to register the Floo, better it be an administrator who could hide the paperwork.
Ron is so full of feels.
“Yeah,” he whispered back.  “Yeah, alright.  I mean, shit.  Really, ‘Mione?”
Draco shrugged.  “His flat.”
She did wonder if it would be a position with any kind of authority or just a public relations stunt.  It didn’t matter.  She’d push it into useful operation.  They certainly needed it.
So close.  So terribly close, the both of them.  The tight, hot grip of Harry’s body around his fingers, his moans, the salty taste of him already.  So close.
The world of artifacts and tagging and meticulously-organized sites seemed like a lifetime ago.  Other than sharing those memories with him as practice, she hadn’t reminisced about them much.  It was still odd to have him ask her out loud about things he’d only seen in her head.
He waited and popped the bottom of the cone in his mouth.  He chewed slowly, working the last of the melted ice cream out of the point before crushing it.
Additional wine was probably ill-advised on an empty stomach, but it
Empty bottles filled the counter, neatly arranged, but too easily quantified for his liking. The floor was clear, if not particularly clean. And the skeletal remains of the chicken were disposed of. No bones, no crime.

And it was hilariously comfortable.  Battered recliners, watermarks on all the tables, posters of scantily clad women on the walls.  A discarded pipe and empty tobacco tin sat on a table next to playing cards.
over the graveyard, just to be safe. Molly volunteered as Secret Keeper.” Draco nodded his approval, so Harry continued.
“In a rather indecent disposition,” he added, wondering how low her fingertips were going to wander.
“Well,” she pipped.  “I believe my instructor is in the kitchen making coffee.”
With a sigh, Draco nodded.  Potter seemed to be mulling over something important.  Maybe he was actually taking the risk of a bond into consideration.  Looking

She opened her mouth slightly, not a concern whatsoever as to why.  He dug his fingers into overworked muscles between her cheekbones and ears, and an inarticulate pleased grunt leaked out of her open mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
A lime green envelope slips under the door, then floats to the middle of the room and hangs mid-air for a moment. It contorts itself into a human mouth and clears its throat in a deep rumble before speaking.
“You came here to wallow in misery?” he half-joked, looking down at her.
In one hour, he can go home. He can go, and take a quick shower, check the second batch of redwood, and on the sourdough, which should be done rising. So, in about two hours, he can be sitting on the couch with a dish of butter and a hot slice of-
Heavenly shape I’ve most-adored.
Vomit splattered in the dusty soil at the edge of the dirt road, and she spat, trying to clear the taste.
He was long and lean, like he’d been intentionally built for speed.  Not overly muscled, but plenty strong.  She could only see his back, but it was worthy of admiration.  Fit, proud, and graced with gorgeously-defined shoulders.
“As would the Seers Guild in Delphi,” she said quietly.  She looped her arm through his and they started down the aisle to the door.
I’ll pretend you’d always meant to go.
“Malfoy, why are you here?”
Narcissa screamed, hands gripping her hair.
Adams looked up and frowned.  “Racist, Granger.”

September 1st, 2021
, either?  And where had she seen this man before?  The man with Malfoy’s tattoo.
Ron turned around and huffed out a breath.  “Pretty sure you hide extra brains in that hair, ‘Mione.”
She opened her mouth, but nothing came out.  Because, yes, that was exactly what she’d expected to find when she came back.  He took the opportunity to lay a chaste kiss on her lower lip.
“The dinner party,” Harry said, hoping Malfoy would fill in the rest.  There was obviously something cooking in his kitchen.  Harry could smell it.
You can find me on
Who made a home,
She groaned, “Mm… incorrigible.” He chuckled and pulled out. Sliding her shorts up, she leaned back to plant a kiss on his chin. Or the beard covering it. “I guess I’m going to change.”
“You were moaning.  I thought it was a nightmare, but I wasn’t sure, so I looked,” he said, panic making his voice quiver.  “I’m sorry.  I shouldn’t have done that.”
“I did, apparently. And so did you?”
Full sprawl accomplished, he was surprised how firm the mattress was.  He’d expected to sink down into it, but instead, it only gave enough to cushion the prominences of his hips and shoulders.
Odd that Potter’s first question would be about where the train was going, and not why the hell there were two extra kids, or why he was embarrassing children at King’s Cross.
She shrugged.  “They would cheer me up.  I didn’t want to be cheered up.”
Silently, he was grateful she’d anchored the footstool.  The urge to lean back and offer his hips up to Harry was overwhelming.  Doing so would have resulted in a probation-violating naked tangle.
“Fuck,
I took… my… time.
“Not for a bird who flew all day. I should have thought to ask.”
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.
Every thud in the road forced him to surface to consciousness, and it was getting annoying.  He hadn’t trusted Weasley and his contraption of a Muggle car to get him home, and he’d been even more reluctant after Weasley said it ran on fucking cooking oil.  Death by fricassee.
that’s the bloody problem, Potter.”
He cast a wordless warming charm over himself.  Clothes might have been a good idea, but Luna had seen him in a lot less than knickers and muffins.
“Want me to get Mum?” Ron offered.
“Fuck,” he panted, “fuck, fuck, fuck, Hermione…”
“Breathe, Draco,” Harry whispered as he squeezed Draco’s forearm again.  He hadn’t let go from earlier, but Draco hadn’t noticed.  “I know you and Robards never intended for an audience.  Neither did I.  If you want me to, I can pull the evidence and postpone.”
Falk was clad in scandalously tiny black pants with a small scarlet Bats logo on one hip.  They left utterly nothing to the imagination.  Dark hair flowed upward from them, narrowing to a fine line before flaring out neatly across his chest.  He was rather well-proportioned for a man his height, Harry thought, neither lanky nor barrel-chested.  Well-muscled and lean, but not quite the cutting physique Harry kept.
Ron beat him to the punch, tact absent, per usual.
Sorting his hand as Ron dealt, Harry muttered, “She’s right, Ron.  You’re just going to have to burn that shirt entirely.”
The smut returneth and will only get smuttier.
—————————————
“Oh… alright,” Draco whispered.
Ron’s free hand tugged her behind him as he squared off with Harry.  “Least I don’t beat people up in bed, Harry,” he said softly.  “I stopped by Wheal Elvan.  Didn’t expect
“Can… can I ask you about your evening with Granger?”  Malfoy asked, no preamble, ample trepedation.
Potter looked up, and Draco waved his attention off from his seat on the couch.   Black hair lowered back down inside the fortress of paperwork that polluted his dining table.  Every one of those files had “Malfoy” on it.  A family history penned in liquid guilt on the skin of those less fortunate.  But Potter just sat there, like he had been all morning.  Reading, making small notes, and
“Next week, then,” she said, not looking up.  “Keep your beak clean.”
“Someone’s dithering again,” Draco said with a lazy grin and wiggle of his hips.  He pulled the collar of the sweatshirt up over his nose and took a deep breath.  “You can go first, if you’d rather.”
Harry closes his eyes and lets the sounds of the crowd mill around him. The fireworks are due to start soon, and he almost considers taking a short nap to make up for last night.
The sorrow in his words made tears burn in Draco’s eyes. “It doesn’t fit me.”
“St. Petersburg?”  Harry said, more than asked.
“I even dug up copies of the underground Knockturn Newsletter. Not a peep. ”
, this needs attention.  Possibly defense.  It’s a bit enticing, you know.”
“You do lead a fascinating life.” Draco jots something down and pauses, the feathered end of the quill flicking across his chin. “The Hogwarts winter gala?”
More bitter than sweet.
“That’s… a very genteel way of putting it, Weasley,” Malfoy said softly, chewing his lower lip.
“Still not flattering,” Harry replied, frown edging into a scowl.
Through the mist, he saw a tall figure step out onto the field and turn to face the bleachers near him.
He made his way to the Floo station.  “Ballycastle Bats Stadium.”
Oh, the tortures you’ll endure.
————————————
“MACUSA?”
“Goldilocks would have fared differently if she’d have stolen muffins,” a low voice drawled from the sofa.
“Yeah.  He thought she’d retaliate against him, not against me.  His mistake.”  Malfoy huffed and settled back against the seat, “She summoned her entire Potential Daughters-in-Law List like the nightmare bitch queen she is.”
“Hey, yourself.” Percy snorted.  “Bet you’ve been entirely too popular today.”
“People expect what?  Harry Potter, Future Head Auror, lady killer?” Ron mocked.
Harry moaned as her fingertips guided him into her slick heat, but his hips stuttered, torn between thrusting into her, and driving himself back on to Draco.
Dear gods above, the most powerful witch he’d ever met was stalking her way up his body, and all sense had fled him.  Transfixed in intimidation and arousal, he froze, panting.  He was so wonderfully and terribly close to losing control of the roiling tension in his hips.
“And a Death Eater putting his dick in them both,” Draco hissed in a sarcastic whisper.
A sigh escaped him, and he cautiously opened both eyes, body momentarily distracted enough for coherence.
She’d decided she would go visit the Burrow this afternoon.  Her coursework had been surprisingly easy thus far, and she was very disappointed.  Other than some meetings, assigned reading, and the Wizengamot summons, her internship hadn’t required much, either.  So, getting reacquainted with the Weasleys would be a good next step.
Hermione couldn’t sleep.  Her bed wasn’t big, but it

treatments in clinical trials. It all burned.”
“The Foxing Ring.” The Goblin rolls his eyes and slams a ledger shut.
“They’re related?!” Harry barked, his voice echoing around the spring. Water sloshed as he made his way to the ladder to look up at Draco in astonishment. “That actually kind of makes sense.”
Earthly shapes I’ve most-adored.
Draco’s hips pick up speed, and his fingertips dig into Harry’s pelvis as he thrusts, hard and deep.  His breath puffs against Harry’s neck, hot, desperate, and erratic as his rhythm falters.
I'M TEXTING YOU MY NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS.  YOU'LL NEED IT.
“Fuck,” he muttered, rubbing his eyes.  “Granger.”
“That was a mating howl, by the way.  Not a particularly dignified one, either.”
Fingers grasping for purchase on his sweat-slicked back, she came again in a rush.  Her legs wrapped around his hips, holding him inside while her core clenched him in waves of pleasure.  Her breath shuddered, and her hands slid back down his arms.
Is that all you’ve got?
Draco’s cock tasted faintly of latex, and Harry didn’t give a flying
“We’ve been watching you for years, ‘Erminha.  Since you Obliviated police in Perth.”
But I do want one.  A ring.  Or a blowie under the table, not that I'm not-not a screamer and unfit for public consumption.  But I'd honestly rather have the ring.  And we'll get there.  He just needs maybe another year to get over some things.  It'll happen, and Hermione's ring looks really heavy, anyway, and it's probably good she's wearing it on a thicker chain, even if it is suited more to a man.
Fantastic, he thought to himself.  An agitated Narcissa first thing in the morning.  They met, side by side, next to one of the few windows in the corridor.  The weak sunlight lit Rhoda’s hair like a furious halo.
The shaft of sunlight inside the door met with soft illumination from windows on the opposite wall.  Light gray stone composed the walls and floor, streaked with whorls of tan and black.  The walls featured what would have looked like natural protrusions and jags, had they not been at regular intervals.  Softly inclining stair-stepping ridges up the walls and pits, dips, and furrows marked the stone.  Almost deep enough to use as shelves, if he’d owned anything worth displaying.
“So it doesn’t get in our way,” he whispered.
Earnest cornflower blue eyes watched her with a gentle nod, and she let Draco’s hands ease her down to lay on his chest.  The pressure inside her shifted, and her hips wiggled to even it out.  Was this even comfortable for Draco?
, she was sure.
Matting by a mother piled,
“The… spending of her stipend on mens’ lingerie?” Draco ventured.  Harry turned to look at him, face obscured in his own shadow.  The tips of his hair caught the light and glowed like a tumbleweed on fire.
The ring was too big. Just like the trainers under the couch.
Harry’s toes reappeared, and his foot nudged around until it found Draco’s knee. The toes gripped Draco’s track pants and lamely tried to tug him forward. “The stars are out in here.”
“All successful?”  Draco asked, especially curious about the part-Veela children.  He’d always suspected the Pureblood requirement had never been true.
Headstones. Flowers. Forced moments of silence that felt like his soul was being held at gunpoint.
Draco stood and swept muffin crumbs into a tidy pile on the table, then slid them into his waiting hand.  He frowned and chastised himself.  This wasn’t really about Magnus.
But then
Draco growl-barks two syllables that sound suspiciously like mockery.
Merlin, what had that cost Malfoy?  These memories weren’t even just of students.  There were toddlers and babies in many of them.  Malfoy and Falk had clearly been a fixture in the town around Durmstrang Institute.
,” he said in an excited rush.  “I would bring them scorched ratatouille and they would gobble it down and look to me for more.”
“It’s really you, Hermione?” Luna asked suspiciously.  “I haven’t known dugbogs to text, but it would be like them.”
********************************
Ron didn’t get the TV reference, but he was preoccupied with just how incredibly wet she was, and how badly he wanted to taste her.  He turned her around to face him, backing her calves against the couch between Harry’s knees.
, though, isn’t he?”
Harry’s breath hitched at the intimate position.  Liquid dripped down from Draco’s hair, trailed down his temples and jaw, and dampened Harry’s shirt.  Malfoy’s breath was calm and even next to his ear, body close, but not pressed against Harry’s backside.
For there, before him, in full moonlit splendor, was a very naked Draco Malfoy humping a pillow on the hearth rug.
The powder was a curious thing itself.  So fine, it was nearly a liquid.  Dark, glittering, and just exceptionally clingy.  And it was the source of the scent.  He brushed his hand off on his pants, but the powder stuck in the whorls of his finger prints.

“Hm? Ah, right. You should have seen the

used to.  He pulled the plates up and rinsed them, setting them on a towel to dry.  They weren’t as nice as the ones at Wheal Elvan.  He dug around in the water for the forks, and wondered if it would be acceptable for him to steal his mug from Wheal Elvan.  Drinking coffee tomorrow morning out of one of his mugs felt… wrong.

or Discord as Vukovich.
“I always use my whole ass, don’t I?”
One of Harry’s hands gripped Draco’s hip, and the other one guided his cock to Draco’s entrance.
Harry’s soulmate mark burns like a glowing metal wire in his skin, and Draco gasps.
Draco groaned and buried his face in Harry’s hair.  It was unreal how strands so soft could manage to stand up at such angles.  “
One wolf in sheep’s clothing, and one sheep in wolf’s clothing, he mused.  And would he want them reversed?  A soft, cuddly, curvy Hermione and a shrewd, argumentative, lithe Draco?  Absolutely not.  That sounded boring on one end and scary on the other.  Best of both worlds, this way.
She nodded, feeling stupid.  How could she have thought that he was putting so much effort into joke candy and fucking Dark Farts charms?  Godric, she’d underestimated him beyond belief.
“Roll over.”
“Fine,” she huffed with a dramatic eye roll.  “But that’s way too much.  I’m saving room for dinner.”  She sat up and leaned against a small mountain of white pillows, tucking her legs up and crossing them.
Harry tripped and fell, landing ass-first on a stone floor, dick bobbing awkwardly.  His hands shifted as he tumbled, but not in time to catch him, and his shoulders crashed into a wall.  He shook his head and marveled that he hadn’t concussed himself on the floor or wall.
What would it feel like to slide his hands over that satin as it stuck to Draco’s skin?  And what would he do if he felt Harry’s hands on him?  He could do that.  Technically, he could.  But could he stop if he did?
“To start.”
Granger squints to read a description on some toy that looks like a splinched abacus.  Her ring hangs from an unfashionably thick gold chain for a woman's necklace, but then that whole practice is garish.  Women being expected to tote around a metallic stand-in for their hymens.  I've always thought that's why they're tight little rings, not wide, jangling bracelets.  Some kind of You-Break-It-You-Buy-It gold pre-pay system.

Soleil Black, aka, Father Black.  Progenitor of the Black line.  Father to more than a dozen pureblood witches and wizards.  No wonder, if he spent his free time making things like this, Ron figured.  Randy old wizard.
“Oh, no.” Robards leaned back in his chair, exhausted.  “That was just to get out ahead of the news of Adams hexing a bystander.  But it won’t hurt with this, either.”
“Honey…”
Expectation fluttered nervous feathers inside Draco's chest. "Good," he managed to whisper.
Harry waved to the waitress who’d patted his shoulder, gestured to the empty croissant plate, held up two fingers, and jerked a thumb toward the door with a nod.
He topped up his coffee and smoothed the creases in the paper, reading on.
Honey-blond hair in a low ponytail over slender, angular shoulders.  Soft brown eyes below dark, sharp eyebrows.  He had a petite, but agile build that made Harry want to jump up and help him with the boxes.  Or jump up and do… something.

of the shit you did, Draco?” The man’s voice rose as he stepped closer, and Draco let himself be cornered against the counter. “Why did you accuse me of fucking half the men in our unit? Why did you storm out of Ron’s wedding and change the locks on your flat? Why did you find every possible fucking way to hurt me?”
“Everything in the room has been stripped of gold, silver, and jewels,” Burgock said.
Harry felt himself frown in confusion as all three of them turned to look at him.
“Two days without food is more than a bit.”
, Harry."
Merlin, she was glorious to behold.  Her hips swiveled in time with his mouth.  Her hands each cupped a supple breast, one gently pinching a nipple.  Breathy, needy gasps murmured from her parted lips.  She was so close, and being so terribly patient.
Harry smiled, and he could feel the fake tightness of it as he slid his boxers off.
And I'm a praise slut.
?” Lucius asked slowly.
Which, in turn, led to yet another blistering body part, his throat, as he’d managed to steadily consume both of their koboldozers.  Malfoy had taken a sniff of his, hacked inelegantly through his nose, mumbled something derogatory about juniper, and handed his glass to Harry.
“I can’t,” the man said, turning wet eyes away from Draco.
She yanked her hand out of her jacket pocket and scrubbed it on her hip.
?!” she found herself ranting.  She was going to get a reputation in Cardiff if she kept showing up only to yell at this man.
Odbert looked up at him in shock, but he refused to look down.  Another rule.  Never look down at a Goblin.  Never, ever kneel to speak to one on eye-level.  Always assume the Goblin’s eyes are roughly at your eye-level above the Goblin’s actual head.
She lost track of time as she focused on pouring into the otter’s form, scanning it from head to tail and back again, weaving tendrils and tying knots.
———————————————
Harry leaned over and head-butted Draco’s shoulder.  “I’m supposed to go get them, right?”
“Might I invite you to spend the night?” Draco holds Harry’s face, cheeks mushed against Draco’s palms.
“Fuuuuuck,” Harry groaned. “Thanks Pers.  I’ll look into it.”  This wasn’t good.  He didn’t go to Ballycastle for fish and chips.

Flourish & Blotts, 2021
Draco’s arms ran with goosebumps at the tone.  Gods, what would Potter the plotter accomplish if he put his mind to the bedroom instead of politics?
The papers in his hands shake, and his eyes won’t focus on the words in front of him. He never should have trusted Malfoy with protection spells, especially not when they hadn’t felt like real spells.
, he thought to himself.  None of that mattered anymore.
Draco’s breath hitched, and he swallowed down a sob. The train slowed, stopped, and the man pulled him to his feet. Draco wavered on unsteady legs. The man’s arm wrapped around his waist, and he let himself be led out into the humid summer air.
Harry looked down at the plastic cutlery in his hand, Malfoy’s jibe sinking in.
Read in order, it made an apology:
“Damn you wizards and your slimy tricks, Blackblood,” the Goblin spat, jotting down a note and sending it flying out the post slot to the Curse Breakers.  “My Head Curse-Breaker is planning on retiring in two years, if your lazy Pureblood ass sees fit to work a day in its life.”
*********************************
“Sporadically, until a few years ago. We’ve just been friends since then.” Draco pulls his wand from his pocket and inspects the sweet potato. “I got busy with work. He and Pans were stricken with baby fever and utterly bed bound for the better part of last autumn. It was tragic.”
Fuck, Draco thought.  He’d severed the nerve higher than he’d originally assessed.  There was a good chance a Mungo’s-trained Healer would leave Potter with lingering weakness.
Harry released a deep sigh and looked up to find Draco watching him intently.  He nodded, but Draco didn’t move.  His mobile picked up his voice, but he spoke to Draco.
, but at least the man had the decency to acknowledge it and look guilty.
Gathering his strength, he swung his feet to the floor and sat up.  The room spun, but steadied more quickly than it had that morning.  Maybe tomorrow would find him fully amongst the living.
“I thought about making you come while I was in class.”  The tip of her tongue lapped the slit at the tip of his length, and he swore softly under his breath.
Harry nodded, lips pulled between his teeth, deliberating.  Draco watched him, wary of making premature conclusions.  How law-abiding was his Auror when no one was watching?  Did this Head Auror play by his own rules?

————————————————
Harry bit his lip and worried about what would happen if he opened the bond, too.  If it was as intense as it looked, could he trust himself not to break down the fucking door? To not touch Draco? Gods, he wanted to touch him already.
Warm, silky fur wraps around his neck, and Harry fights the urge to see if fox toes are ticklish. Draco’s doing a very good job of playing dead and keeping his head tucked under the edge of the robes. Harry stuffs his hands in the pockets of the too-long robes and lifts them as he walks around the edge of the crowd.
Hermione looked up from her ridiculous calendar.  “Right.”
At least he’d made it through a coherent conversation with Potter not noticing.  The last few hours were always dodgy; nonsense coming out between thoughts, vacant stares, twitches.  All terribly attractive and put-together.  Sexy sexy squall in a suit.
“This is officially the oddest position.  For the record.”
Falk made no move to greet him, and Harry was quietly grateful.  Maybe he could just slip out.  He stepped down, and a deep rumbling voice vibrated through the room.  “I’d like Potter to stay, if he’s willing.  Basilia,” he said, turning to stare at her chest.  “You get ten minutes.”
True love cuts twice
Hermione and the Supreme Mugwump had left the Minister’s podium after running out of either forms or steam.  They’d each returned to their seats and were busily tapping on their mobile screens.  Entirely too many similarities, Harry thought.

Her mind drifted to an octopus she’d seen release an ink cloud in the London aquarium.  She sighed and figured this was what it felt like to be the startled predator in sudden darkness.  She
“Did he just turn into a massive fuckall bird and fly away, or did one of you jinx my contacts?  Cuz I didn’t bring my glasses.” Harry asked, bewildered.
Draco is sad at home, talks to Ron.  Harry shows up and fucks things up, because of course he does.
With a crack and a lurch, he was tumbling onto his bed from several feet above.  Cool sheets assaulted his face, and he Vanished his clothes.
“I think my lazy Pureblood ass would be rather distracting to that jizz-dripping manwhore you call a husband and Treasurer,” Draco ventured, trying to hide his trepidation.
Stupefaction reigns supreme.
————————————
There it is, Harry thought.  There’s the common ground between him and Malfoy.  Snarky bastards, the both of them.  Reassured, Harry decided to dive right in to the reason they were sitting on a bench waiting for chips from a truck that probably wasn’t even supposed to be serving food yet.
“But why elves?”  She tried to keep her gaze above his shoulders and failed immediately.
The Unspeakable was right.  Draco didn’t need to be here for this.
“Another word for ‘validate’!”  Hermione shouted from the bed.
“She knows I’m an Unspeakable,” Luna said.  “Family is allowed to know, in case we go missing.  Why did you need an Unspeakable, though?”
If the price of pleasure’s pain,
Malfoys did not beg to be—  His mind blanked out as Harry moved inside him.  Too good, too fast.  Too close, too soon.  Tension coiled at the base of his cock as Harry’s length pressed against Draco’s prostate.  His jaw went slack, and an inarticulate choked cough sounded from his throat.
The lift glides to a halt and opens into a bloody greenhouse. Harry catches a glimpse of the immense glass enclosure and lush greenery before the humidity fogs his glasses. The air is thick with the scent of growing things, and he’s fairly certain he saw an actual banana tree in the corner.
Harry thought pushing Malfoy to reveal what he’d seen was probably a bad idea.  Nothing about his demeanor said he was in a sharing mood.
Her thumb scrolled through the log of calls on her mobile.  That had been the first call she’d gotten from them since she left.  Over a month ago.
The walk from the public Floo to the station had taken up a fair chunk of his morning already.  He hadn’t actually read the report beyond the location until he arrived.
“I don’t really bake,” Hermione said timidly, unsure why Molly was writing out copies of recipes for her.  “I mean, I can. I’ve only ever used Muggle appliances, though.”
Draco stood in front of the Floo, a chocolate muffin in each hand, and a brain full of fuzz.  He needed a nap.  A nap, and several more languid, lazy orgasms.  But
The sun glinted off his not-husband’s glasses, and Draco’s fingers knew how to pluck them from the bridge of his nose to get a better look at his eyes. But he stuffed his hands in his pockets and watched a drop of water fall from the faucet, instead.
“I dunno.” Harry dumps the cubed potato into the pan and shrugs. “I’m not into… feet?”
“Parkinson Pussy Palace,” he enunciated carefully.  Percy rolled his eyes, arms crossed, thoroughly unamused that anyone could have
The water gurgled down the drain, and he dried his hands and turned to the fridge for a beer.  Empty air and a dismembered Quintaped on the floor greeted him.  Right.  That.
Malfoy for suggesting he did.

“Fuck,” the man sighed. He was close enough to touch, but unlikely to appreciate it. “You know, maybe that’s intentional. Maybe you threw yourself in front of that curse because you couldn’t live with it anymore.”
Ron scowled, tone careful, meticulously smoothing the silver wire and winding it around a spool.  “Why would anyone want to own a Basilisk?”
“So long as the Aerarium and Rome’s treasury don’t fall, do we care?”
Draco sauntered over to the ladder and considered climbing down to watch Harry bathe, but decided against it. He also considered batting the glasses next to the ladder down into the hole, just to be a prat.
But, Harry realized with painful clarity,
Her hips settled against Draco’s and he slid his hands up to her waist, then her shoulder blades.  She was supposed to lay back, but the hard length inside her was immobilizing.  In a good way.  Her fingers snuck down to her clit, not surprised to find her slit wet already.
Draco rolled his eyes and adjusted his swollen cock inside his pajama bottoms for the umpteenth time.  He mentally added six months to the grudge he was planning to hold against Percy Cockblocker Weasley.
Harry watches him leave in a mess of leather, lace, and green flames, and a gust of warm, cedar-scented wind flows through the room. He shuffles up to bed and spends the rest of the night alternating between dreams of sparkling blue eyes and a churning nightmarish tangle of pale limbs that makes his soulmate mark burn.
her.  Holy hell.
“Captain,” Draco said, a touch more snidely than he’d intended.
Gods be damned, he’d been reduced to a livid sexual spectacle, and Draco would be, as well.  Not that his own throbbing erection had been addressed yet.
seen this man nude. Hopefully, more than seen. Touched, and licked, and sucked, and stroked, and held him, sweaty and eager in a dark tent.
“It’s-“ Draco started, and stopped to breath through a chuckle.  “Of

She leaned in and whispered to Draco, “He
“Just that.  Every time an owl is sent to him, from anywhere, it disappears.”  The man blinked up at her.  She had half a mind to ask him if
There, he thought.  Enough to make a hovel a home.
Scoffing, he rubbed his eyes.  Falk’s memories played out like a cinematic production, in which Draco Malfoy portrayed an entirely different human being, and Harry was starting to doubt Falk’s trustworthiness.
Hermione cackled next to him and threw a fork at Harry, who was still singing about group sex.
A bark of laughter sent a dribble of coffee down Harry’s chin, and Falk snickered.
Seeing her own tear-streaked face somehow made her sorrow real.   Her hands clapped over her mouth to quiet the lone sob that wrenched up out of her chest.
“Uhm.” Harry glances up at a very flushed Draco. “Explain?”
White-blond hair spread over the deep red velvet of the sofa arm, and Harry fought the urge to reach out and touch it.  Malfoy’s grey eyes were still slightly glazed when they opened, but studied him acutely.
Draco hesitated, not sure if that was a double-entendre or not.
Potter shuffled around his kitchen, putting seemingly random items in the rucksack.  Pot holders.  A can opener.  A handful of forks.  A corkscrew.  Tea towels.  Draco frowned.  His own kitchen was actually lacking all of those specific items.  And Harry had apparently taken inventory and made a list.  In addition to the dishes.  Those stupid, thoughtful, perfect dishes.
But she’s so niiiiiiice.
Harry lifted his head and rested his chin on Draco’s ribs.  “Are you fucking serious, Malfoy?”
It would be easier if she’d stop trying to help.  Her wiggling was encouraging, but not productive.  Really, he thought, he could ram it in with the heel of his hand, and she’d just ask for more.
You can find me on
Draco took a long breath, pen tapping against the notebook.  He’d said it like he was retelling teenage hijinks.  “And
“Hey, Ron,” Harry whispered.  Draco was out cold, and Hermione looked like she was going to join him.  Ron rolled onto his back and looked over.  “What are you going to do about this?”
“Dray, be serious.”  Harry huffed a laugh and busied himself with the kettle, not looking over.
“You really don’t have to explain, Draco,” she murmured. The shame radiating from him was suffocating. “If you like what you do with her, that’s fine. But if you don’t want to do it, don’t.”
“Yeah,” Harry says gently, resting his hands on Draco’s hips. “It’s probably one of the most famous films ever made.”
Harry very much wanted to hug Malfoy.  He looked scared and needed hugs.  Long hugs.  Malfoy would like long hugs even more with his shirt off.
“I said I wouldn’t tell anyone, but-“ Paws dig into Harry’s belly as Draco climbs on top of him and flops down. “He has
*********************************
She slid out of her bra, and stepped out of her jeans and knickers both. He slid over as she crawled up next to him on the high bed.
Her annoyance dissolved as she took in the riotous whorls of flowers and vines adorning the border of the page.  Holding it up to her nose, she could just make out individual dots of black India ink that built the pointillist design.
Harry’s fingers thread through Draco’s damp hair as it cools. Draco’s breathing slows, he sighs, then mumbles, “’N’ m’gonna fuck you to pieces.”
So… close…. Now, stop!
Draco had fallen asleep on the couch halfway through
“She shoved your come up my ass,” He blurted out as Harry walked him to the bed.  “Did you know she did that?”
He glanced back at Harry, whose chin was still on the table.  The man was studying him like a sculptor, and it was a little flattering, really.  Much better than the wide-eyed panic that had hopefully run its course.
————————————————
Draco leaned down to rest his chin on top of the chair, rocking gently side to side. “Well, last time… there was an
If they weren’t willing to cooperate, she wasn’t entirely sure what her backup plan would have been. An exclusive relationship with Ron seemed like a one-way ticket to being barefoot and pregnant in the Burrow for the next decade. That had zero appeal.
And someday, she’ll be in Madame Pomfrey’s room, sobbing because some snot-nosed little bastard broke her heart, and Madame Pomfrey will say, “Do you want me to call your mum, luv?” and Lyra will say, “Yes.  No!  Can you call Draco?”
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.
Harry panted against his forearm, frozen.
His other hand stroked down from Draco’s shoulder, over his chest, lingering on a nipple and coming to rest on his waist.  Harry’s fingers dug in as Draco moved, soft skin over firm muscle, tensing and thrusting.
Born at dawn, named after luck,
His lips finally grazed her sex through her shorts, and she whimpered. He kissed more firmly, earning a slow thrust and soft moan from her. He gently set his open mouth over her, pressed his teeth above and below her clit, and firmly exhaled a hot breath into the fabric.
“Mm hm.” Draco bends to run his lips over Harry’s nipple. “I like that you like to touch me.”
A faint content hum rose from him as he remembered a glimpse of Malfoy’s bed and all the pillows, and the big fluffy comforter, and the innate knowledge they would all be just exquisitely soft, because they were Malfoy’s.  And they would all smell like him.  And Godric, he could smell him right now from across the table.
Soft lips pressed against the nape of his neck. “Go back to sleep.”
Did Malfoy even know Harry could see him in the mirror?
An entirely nude Draco rises from behind the desk, and Harry’s eyes wander down Draco’s body, but just once. Maybe twice. Well, and a third peek, because it’s not every day that he gets to see Draco Malfoy’s dick, which is a crying shame, now that he’s gotten a good look at it.
———————————
Her head flopped back down and she reached out to trail fingers down Harry’s thigh as he watched their conversation.
“But if I-“
vague,” she said spookily.  He could practically hear her wiggling her fingers for effect.  “Time to go back.”
Harry lingered in front of the Floo in the Azkaban Head Auror office.
Slack-jawed, she stared up at Molly’s earnest face, struggling to breathe.
His fingers drifted downward, and his mouth replaced them, latching lips around her clit.  Her whole body jerked, and he suppressed a grin.  Scrabbling hands left her breasts to clutch sheets next to her hips.
Harry grins so wide it hurts his cheeks. He didn’t expect to get it right on the first try.
Hermione’s curiosity was piqued.  “Why are we afraid of the owl?” she asked gently.
With a start, he recognized the irritating hum.  It nearly matched the sound Malfoy had made while healing Ron.  Did Robards use illegal Blood Magic to ward his Ministry office?
Ron’s hands had been holding her by the waist, but now grabbed a hold of the band of her skirt, testing the stretch.
right, and bothered the hell out of him.
, delicate witch that I am?”
He flicked a weak
Draco stared straight ahead at the train and watched as a porter levitated the childrens’ trunks into the cargo hold.  He licked his lips, took a breath to speak, but shook his head.
It was time to flirt with middle-aged secretaries.  He’d repeatedly declined their invitations to whatever the hell a pottery painting night was.  Now, it was time for reconnaissance.
Draco said lecherously.
Air pressure built, popped, and his ears filled with screaming.
Why, my love, they didn’t think I’d be trouble.
“Oh! Oh, my!”
Dozens of parlors and sitting rooms from a previous life skittered through his head.  None were places he wanted to go or contained people he wanted to see.  Even fewer were inhabited by people who wanted to see
Upon inspection, Draco wasn’t under the folds of the duvet or hidden in the copious pillows, but he couldn’t have gone far.  Their sixty-foot tether meant only the living room and half the kitchen was within reach of the bed.
Blooming tears and warring loyalty hastened her out of the library as her thumb ran over the faint scar on her forearm.  Cold air greeted her outside the doors, and she took a deep, cleansing breath.
“It’s an experiment, I guess, is the best name for it. For you.”
“You are
It was going to be a dildo
Half my goddamn pile is his shit.  His socks lay on my suit jacket.  I have to get the fuck out of here.
The term made no sense to Harry.  Falk must have sensed his confusion before he could condense into a thought.
Pulling up his pants, Malfoy grinned.  “Ten-thousand foot altitudes and one-hundred and fifty mile an hour dives.  Roughly.”
A longer sob tumbled from her, nearly a moan.  Scooting closer, he watched her face.  She didn’t look upset, but nightmares could be odd.  Her cheeks were flushed, lips parted, brows relaxed.  She looked… eager?
Anything to distract from the distinct impression of being on the verge of combustion.
Her own mobile buzzed on the cot next to her, and she wiped greasy fingers on her trousers before digging around for it.
“I think,” he whispered darkly, “a certain greedy witch wants more than her poor little cunt can handle.”
“Yeah, and I did what I could, but I only know triage spells and it wasn’t enough and every time I move more blood-“ He stopped short as Malfoy held a hand up to quiet him.
Robards wanders off, probably in search of something to wash that last doughnut down with. Likely another doughnut. Jensen stuffs his hands in his pockets. His jeans stretch across narrow hips, and Harry hates that he notices. His pressed white shirt is tucked into designer denim, and his shoes are unusually fashionable for an Auror.
, you won’t scare me with the details. I’ve seen worse.”
“I’m on decent speaking terms with the Greengrasses,” Draco lied.  “And she with the Notts.  We thought discretion was wise.”
Confused, Harry shook his head as Draco crawled onto the duvet.  Hermione slid carefully off the foot of the bed, mug held reverently in both hands.  She made her way to her rucksack on the couch, tipping back the mug as she walked.  Her bum peeking out from under his shirt was adorable, and he smiled as he watched her.
“You were right, Draco,” Ron said with a nod.  “Courtship.”
Trick-trick-trick-trick-
“San Francisco.”
They were the ultimate “Till death do us part” of betrothals.  Gods, he could only ever dream of a proposal like that.  He’d squeal like only a grown ginger man can squeal.
It had been an impossible opportunity to pass up, so it would just have to work.  The Ministry had finally realized they needed better integration of Muggleborns from a legal perspective.
He wraps his arms around Draco’s chest and presses his face into his back, but it does little to muffle the howl that wrenches itself from his chest. His arm is on fire, and his eyes burn, and his throat feels scratched raw as he wails against the unresponsive body in his arms.
Experimentally, he tugged against his pinned hands.  Excitement jolted through him at the confinement.  “Gods, ‘Mione.”
The words are simple verse,
“Fuck, Dray, this is how horror movies start.  What if I do something wrong?”
Handing the note off to Hermione, Malfoy headed for the door.
“But what does that
Hermione's conflicted about spending the night with a man, but... muffins.
Draco’s lips turned down in a soft frown at Harry’s word choice, and he regretted it immediately.  It was a bit of a low blow to say he
“Fourth year, obviously.  It wasn’t a secret.”  Ron squinted, trying to remember the dumb minutia of pubertal hijinks.  ”Though I think they’d actually started in third year,”
“Jesus fucking Christ,” Jensen hisses.
“Next time,” Draco continued, waving his empty fork for emphasis, “I’ll put some space between us after Healing. That was a bit intrusive.” He wiggled sheepishly and looked at Harry. “And maybe a bit loud during work hours?”
“Uhm…” Draco looked at the ceiling, as if it held the answer. “A little over three years? But I don’t usually see her for months at a time.”
The weight of his orgasm broke through his control, and his hips thrust up against her. His hands scrabbled for purchase only to find the back of the chair.
“Well, Luna and Pansy suggested contacting you…”
“The what?” Draco whispered, even as bits of memories came rushing back to him.
“Because they’re just as racist as you, Councilwoman Granger,” he snarked lazily.  His mobile buzzed, and he sat up.  “Hey, Potter texted me back.”
“I suppose I still am.  And now you’ve provided me with a rainbow-paved path to it, and yet… you dither, Harry.”
Florian & Bots, 2021
For anything but this.
“Ordering new glasses?”  Draco asked, just above a whisper.
She winced a touch at the question.  “I didn’t really… date.  Just… sex.”
” Onasis oozed.  “Took you for dead.”
“And now
Harry and Hermione and their movies.  Harry and Hermione and their restaurants.  Harry and Hermione and their dates.  Harry and Hermione tangled together under a blanket on the couch.
“Kind of scared the shit out of me, by the way.”
, Draco. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Please- Please-” His words dissolve into begging.
,” he whispers.
“Earth to Wizengaswot…” Harry sang as he brought their hands up to his lips and grazed them along Draco’s knuckles, eyes intent on Hermione.  “
He wrestles his shirt on and pulls up his trousers before he dares to look at Malfoy. He lets his gaze wander over the rug, up Draco’s body, over his rumpled shirt to linger on his face.
Belinda’s scowl threatened to separate her chin from the rest of her face, and Draco wondered if Shacklebolt’s eyes could roll back in his head any more sarcastically.
work.
“I will!” she said triumphantly, and released Draco.
Malfoy’s attention returned to the screen, and he realized Hermione’s tracking information had disappeared, and he was looking at a conversation between Hermione and Harry. Curiosity got the better of him, and he tapped “See Previous” in the window while keeping his attention on the conversation in the room.
, you yuppie!”
Harry ran his wand down the owl, and finding nothing, moved on to the small note.  His detection spell lit up a fireworks display of sickly yellow and angry red slashes and swirls.
He shook his head, clearing the image of being bent over on that table by unseen hands.
Hermione stood at the edge of the Wheal Elvan wards, shopping bags in hand. This must look ridiculous, she thought. Standing in the middle of nowhere knocking repeatedly on a magical ward with arms full of plastic shopping bags.
“I think I missed this,” Harry says, slipping a hand down to cup him through his pants. He’s half-hard, and Harry’s fingers wander lower, until Draco’s thighs part, just slightly.
“Hm.  I do like ‘em feisty,” he said with a smirk, swinging the main door open.
Draco draws a deep breath and groans, burying his face in Harry’s armpit. “Five more minutes.”
“Yeah, good to meet you,” Jensen says, American accent entirely out of place. “I’m with MAC.”
Harry, you were just supposed to transport Draco to the Goblin Gala and back.  You were not supposed to get all fucked up on aphrodisiacs and embarrass yourself.
“No.  Security’s required to climax for most,
“You don’t say…”
The lyrics that I’d meant to bring.
His breath came easy as he climbed to the third landing and waited for the man. His shoes stuck to the linoleum, and he peeled them up warily. The air up here was stagnant and smelled of hot cardboard and dust.
“Thanks,” Ron said with a nod. “That was close.”
Harry, you need to keep it together around Malfoy's ex.
enjoyable until he started getting heirs-only invitations from his peers.  Grinning, he wondered, for the umpteenth time, how Pansy had folded napkins into genitalia for his fifteenth birthday dinner.
underpants, he noted.  Not quite as fancy as his satin ones, but nice.
“You really are a magnificent little cumslut,” Draco cooed, pressing the narrow end of the egg against her entrance.
How was he going to break this to Draco?  Adams had texted Janice that he’d gotten him back to Wheal Elvan, but he doubted Draco had any idea what was going on.  Hell, Draco might think Adams was his new parole Auror after the whole tabletop stunt.
“Fucking fuck fuck fuck,” Harry muttered, pinching the bridge of his nose.
, are you dead?
Harry crossed the room to stand uneasily on the other side of the futon, and Draco resisted the urge to run his hands up the soft black t-shirt in front of him.  He looked up to Harry’s face from just below the other man’s chest, green eyes wary.
The little barn owl’s head turns this way and that, probably looking for Harry and the scraps of food he spoils the bird with.  With a burbling screech, he drops an envelope on the counter and hops back out the window.
“Ohh…”  Harry drawled, pieces clicking into place.  “That’s sneaky.”
“Thanks, ‘Mione,” he mumbled, wrapping his arms around her shoulders from behind her stool.
“No complaints,” Harry lied.  He actually had many varied and colorful complaints.  “I can’t officially say, but there might be some changes in senior administration next year.”
He settled his elbows on his knees, chin in his hands as she went bush to bush, examining the closed buds. An early frost had knocked the petals off most of the open blooms the night before, so she’d be lucky to find anything worth picking. As if to spite him, she flicked her wand to cut off a large bud, and swirled it above the tight curl of petals.
“Uhm,” she muttered, flush creeping up her chest.  “The four of us?”
Fuck Dragon Fire…
Draco nods, and Harry tries to not stare at a set of sealed needles laid out on a gleaming tray next to a reclined chair.
“Nope,” Draco says with a pop. “Fists and feet. And teeth and claws if you’ve got them.”
She wandered to the kitchen to check the time.  Six o’clock.  Six o’clock on a Friday evening, and she was preparing to… what?  Heat up some soup and dig into a family law text?
She gasped and pulled back in horror. “
No, anything but that
Asking her to leave it a little longer had been enough to make her leave in a huff, and a house elf came in to finish.  That may have been the last time she touched him for more than presentation or punishment, he thought.
Harry frowned and opened his eyes to look at Falk, who had almost finished his chips.  Falk shrugged, not having anything else to add to his statement.
He plucked out a packet, examined it, ripped it open, and rolled it on with practiced ease.  Harry’s head cocked to the side as he watched the rather expert move.

“And as to your other concern, no.  I don’t plan on pursuing any other men.”  He took a fortifying breath.  “If you want to date other men, we can discuss it.”
“Yeah,” Harry says solidly. “That was fast.”
Bending at the waist, she leaned her ass back closer to Harry as she inched the fabric down her hips, letting it peel inside out, clinging to her damp pussy.  With a small tug, it fell loose, skating the rest of the way down her thighs to the floor.  She held eye contact with Ron while she listened to Harry’s breath quicken.
Ron!  Griffins are not pets!
Water followed his hand, and a cool wet line traced down her forehead, between her eyebrows, and down her nose.  An obnoxious dangling drop of water tickled her nostrils and made her open her eyes.  She hadn’t realized she’d closed them.  Or that she’d had him in her mouth long enough for him to be hard again.
Draco took a shuddering breath and fought the self-conscious panic in his chest.  It had never been important to him?  In retrospect, though, how many times had Magnus actually initiated sex?  Rarely, now that he thought about it.  But more often than once a month.  That seemed untenable.
(See the end of the chapter for
Long fingers coax something tiny from Draco’s hip pocket, and Draco slips it in his own mouth. “We can’t have the Golden Boy getting rusty,” he murmurs in Harry’s ear. His fingertips rest on Harry’s thigh, precariously close to his groin.
Harry picked at the crumbs stuck to his wrapper and avoided looking at him.  It was unlike him to only ask once, Draco thought.  Also unlike him to not at least smile a tiny bit upon hearing the words.  It felt like Harry was trying to taste a lie in his words.
Four is tart, and eight much sweeter.
Harry shifted his hips, bending his far knee.  “Ron and Hermione didn’t notice the rings?”
“Really?!” Harry abandons his seat at the idle lathe and follows Draco to the door. “What’s your Ani-”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut and tried to ignore the man’s hard length pressed against him, and his own body’s response.
