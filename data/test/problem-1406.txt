The boy was watching Evans out of the corner of his eye, and his expression could only be described as… goofy. If Draco’s instincts were reliable—and they always were when a Potter was involved—this boy was head over heels for Evans.
When the Dememtors moved away from his cell, and he finally had a moment to think without being forced to relive his worst experiences, Draco only could think one thing: I deserve to be here. I deserve to rot in Azkaban. I’m a death eater. I attacked the Boy Who Lived for years. I served the Dark Lord. I did nothing to stop all of the evil that happened around me. I deserve to be here….
“Of course you’ll get back home,” she interrupted. “You will when you learn whatever it is you need to learn in this place.”
After what seemed like an eternity, they arrived on solid ground. Draco had his back to the island, but he didn’t want to turn around. He didn’t want to see the tower looming behind him.
What an annoying voice. I was probably his mother. Or Theo, trying to get him up in time for breakfast. But he didn’t want to wake up just yet. All he wanted was to be back in Diagon Alley, enjoying his mint ice cream without a care in the world.
“No,” he said out loud even though he was fairly sure the voice was inside his head. “It’s time for you to get me out of here and bring me back home.”
The determination in Harry’s face didn’t falter. On the contrary—it turned into a hopeful smile that made Draco’s insides tremble.
“You’ve been brave.” Dorcas let her hand fall at her side, and Draco regained control over his racing mind. And then he realised an image of a determined, intense, green stare had plagued his thoughts without his permission. “Going to Dumbledore’s office like that. I know you were scared.”
His mother pulled at him, and that time Draco followed. They arrived at a corner of the Great Hall, where his father was curled on the ground, and they sat down beside him. Draco had barely processed the fact that Harry Potter had just killed the Dark Lord, but now he had to think about his family. His father was wounded, his mother was crying, and Draco was soon enveloped in a hug. It was the first one that Lucius had given in many, many years.
“Potter?” Draco spluttered. This girl knew Potter? And referred to him by his surname? And what was that about a toilet lid prank? Draco was sure he would’ve been the first to find out if Potter had gotten in trouble again. He always was.
How many months had passed since the Battle of Hogwarts? Since his father had been taken away from him, his mother locked up in the Manor that had become the stage for all of Draco’s nightmares?
“Shut up, Will,” said the woman. “Lucius, Narcisa, and Draco Malfoy: you have the right to a disciplinary audience that will occur in the Ministry of Magic. Until your trial, you’ll be considered suspects of colluding with You Know Who and will remain in the magical prison of Azkaban. Do you have any questions?”
TW: feelings of anxiety, vomiting, and mentions of gore scenes that take place in the Deathly Hallows.
Ever since he’d returned to Hogwarts for his Eighth Year, none of his Slytherin friends had wanted to hear what Draco had to say about Potter. It was always,
“That makes no sense,” he retorted. “Tell me what you know. Will I get back home? What year is it? Why—”
At some point that afternoon, three trays of food magically appeared next to the door of the cell, and Draco, who still had the remnants of bile in his mouth, launched himself at the closest one to rid himself of the bad taste and fill his stomach. While he gobbled the food directly off the tray, sitting on the floor, a childish thought crossed his mind: “no one will ever know that a Malfoy has eaten on the floor.”
Draco was wearing a skirt. He could feel a breeze between his legs. And he had… he glanced down and, horrified, confirmed his suspicion. He had
“Worse than everything that’s already gone wrong between us? I don’t think that’s possible,” Harry said, and his eyes fell to Draco’s chest for a moment. “I think it’s time for better things to happen between us.”
Draco examined Lily’s expression carefully for any signs of disdain, of disgust. His heart raced when a moment passed, and then another, and the girl didn’t purse her lips, didn’t tell Potter where he could stuff his feelings for her.
What did it matter? The fact of the matter was he shouldn’t have been thinking about Potter to begin with. He shouldn’t even be here still. Up until that moment, every time he’d finished witnessing the interactions between Lily and James he’d left the scene and reappeared in a different time and place. Yet nothing was happening anymore and he was still standing in the deserted hallway.
he thought desperately. But when he felt the floor under his feet again he was still in Dumbledore’s office. Except they weren’t dressed in their Hogwarts uniforms anymore, and Dorcas wasn’t by his side, but opposite him at the other side of the room. Their wands were raised and Dumbledore was observing them as they attempted the Patronus charm.
Unable to hold back any longer, Draco grasped Harry’s hand in his, feeling, for the first time in months, that perhaps it wouldn’t be so bad to find out what the school year had in store for him.
The Gryffindor frowned, and Draco panicked. Had she noticed? What would happen to him if anyone found him out? Would he return to his body, or would he be stranded here, forced to give an explanation that he was completely in the dark about?
“I do,” Lily’s voice reverberated around them, so sure and so filled with happiness Draco couldn’t look away.
Draco considered standing up and walking right out, but held back. Maybe if he stayed he’d be able to figure out how things had come to this; how the girl that had once passionately hated James Potter had ended up at the altar with him, looking at him with an expression that could only be described as
Why had he laughed at Potter for fainting at the sight of the Dementors in third year? Stuck in that cell, Draco was barely able to get to his feet or speak. Sometimes, he was unable to contain his screams.
“Lower your voice, they can still hear you!” she giggled. “Although now I think about it, it would be hilarious if they did…”
Draco snickered and mentally prepared himself for the sharp reply he’d come to expect from the Potter he knew.
The first thing he felt was an immense relief. Then came the confusion, followed closely by harrowing terror when his memories flooded him at once: the months of insomnia and hopelessness. The emptiness within his chest, so profound it hurt to breathe. His drawer filled with potions.
She rolled her eyes. A set of stairs came to a halt before them, and Draco allowed himself to be guided toward the Gryffindor tower.
A new thought—a disturbing, illogical thought—crossed Draco’s mind, then. What if the girl was Potter and Ginny Weasley’s daughter? She had his eyes, and she was a redhead, even if her hair was several shades darker than Weasley’s. Had he travelled to the future and possessed the body of one of Potter’s daughter’s friends? What year was it? How the fuck had this happened? And
“After you Transfigured every single seat in the Slytherin dorms into a toilet lid? Oh, but of course.
Potter continued talking, and told them how he himself had disarmed Draco, being, therefore, the true owner of the most powerful wand that had ever existed.
“Smile, asshole,” one of the men on his father said to him, at the same time that the other pulled out a camera and took his father’s photo. Only then did Draco realise that his father had been given a plaque with a number. A second later he was given one as well. When they took his photo, he could barely lift his gaze to the camera before pinning it to the floor, a chill running through his body.
“That I’m in the past. Dumbledore is recruiting Hogwarts students for the first Order of the Phoenix.”
Potter appeared from behind the sinks. He was wearing his pyjamas, and his hair was pointing in every direction. The bags under his eyes were a perfect reflection of the ones Draco had seen in the mirror just a few minutes before.
The hallway was deserted save for Potter and Lily, who were standing in front of the statue that led to Dumbledore’s office. They must’ve left together with Marlene and Dorcas, and Marlene must’ve then scurried behind the column Draco was now spying their conversation from.
When they arrived at the doors of the tower, which were metallic and appeared heavy, two of the aurors went forward in order to open them.
Draco barely had time to get out of the bed and peek out between the bars alongside his parents when an abysmal and chilling despair hit him, and he fell to his knees, beginning to yell.
It seemed as though the wavelengths of its sound reverberated in the vacuum when the voice spoke again.
He lifted his head again, feeling the acid burning his throat and mouth, and he shrunk back at the sight of Azkaban’s front walls. It was a metallic colour, and so tall that the highest part was obscured by a thick layer of fog, eliciting a feeling of emptiness and dread that made his blood run cold.
Draco swallowed, feeling weird all over. He wanted to run away, but this was so unexpected he was paralysed, and the only thing he could do while the girl touched his face and looked him in the eye was focus on his breathing. He had to stay calm. He was in another time and place. In a dream. Everything would come to nothing when he woke up, so he had nothing to worry about.
The ice cream cone he was holding vanished along with the rest of Diagon Alley, and Draco came to for a moment, not quite waking up. The voice was almost intangible, and Draco’s first instinct was to fight it. But it was too late. He was floating in a sea of nothingness, and a pull within his chest, similar to that of Apparition, was trying to drag him somewhere.
Everyone’s attention shifted to the people standing under an arch of brightly coloured flowers. He recognised Potter and Evans, of course, as well as a young and radiant Sirius Black. They were dressed with what he guessed must be fancy Muggle robes.
was the only thing that Draco had time to think before he saw the body of the Dark Lord falling, dead, to the ground.
He’d been sleeping; he’d been dreaming about ice cream, and he could vaguely recall setting his alarm the previous night in his Eighth Year dorm. And… he recalled having a bad day. He’d argued with Goyle about Crabbe, and professor Vector had chastised him for falling behind in her classes. Draco had grimaced back at her; yes, he might’ve been distracted in this morning’s class particularly, but that was just because he’d received a letter from his father during breakfast.
Draco took a distracted step towards Evans, but was physically unable to look away from this… this Potter that wasn’t his Potter.
He couldn’t remember what he’d been thinking a moment before. The harder he tried, the more the thought escaped him.
And how long had it been since Hogwarts had felt like home, and not like the place where he’d become a killer?
“And what about his hair?” said Draco. No, he wouldn’t be like the rest of them. He wouldn’t worship the git for something he was clearly desperate to forget. “Has no one taught him what a hairbrush is?”
The boy that he had envied for years for his fame; the boy that had left his body full of scars, the boy that had just saved his life in the Room of Requirement, was gone. The war was over and Voldemort would rule.
Draco had approached him simply because he seemed like the kind of person who’d be willing to sell him an easy way out of his misery. And he’d walked away with nothing but a small vial whose goal couldn’t have been further away from what he’d been looking for.
That voice. Salazar, Draco hadn’t realised just how much he’d missed that voice. His dad’s had been quite similar, yeah, but… there was
Like they were heedless to the fact Potter had become a shadow of himself. Like it wasn’t obvious that Potter carried ghosts within his eyes.
There was no one else nearby, so the girl, whoever on Earth she was, was talking to him. Draco stared back, hoping the panic simmering in his veins wasn’t reflected on the face of the girl whose body he seemed to have possessed—Marlene.
Something was wrong; very, very wrong. Draco could feel his body, and when his nausea receded he found he could control his movements, too. He was aware of his breathing, and he could clench his fists, wiggle his fingers and change his weight from one leg to the other. So he wasn't dreaming.
He wasn’t lying on his bed, but in the middle of… the Hogwarts grounds? How the hell had he gotten there? A ray of sun blinded him momentarily, but his body didn’t move with him when a wave of nausea made him shiver.
Draco grunted in agreement. Salazar, but getting all that off of his chest felt good. He hadn’t the slightest clue who this girl was, but he liked her.
Malfoy Manor, Hogwarts, his parents, the Slytherin common room. The thoughts came hastily, and with them came, too, a feeling of being watched; of being used for evil.
He saw Crabbe, conjuring the fiendfyre and then his howls of agony while he was burned alive. He felt the heat of the flames surrounding him, coming closer and closer to him to consume him, while he clung as hard as he could to Goyle.
“Not entirely; at least not yet. Even so, it’s crucial that every member of the Order be capable of conjuring a
“Dump those three in cell 844. We’re going to need the space,” she said, her voice dripping with disdain.
Dorcas looked him in the eye, thumbed at his cheek again, and walked away, leaving behind a wide-eyed, befuddled Draco, who was unable to do anything but bring the tips of his fingers to his lips and wonder what the fuck had just happened.
“Seriously? I think they make a great couple,” Dorcas interrupted his train of thought. She was smiling like a lunatic; like this whole situation caused her immense joy. “Not as great as you and I, though, if you want my opinion.”
He had no idea who the lady was, but something about her face reminded him of Lily. Her mother, perhaps?
Draco sat down on the ground in the corner and immediately pulled his knees up to his chest. His mother sat by his side and made an attempt to hug him, but he didn’t return it. His father, on the other hand, began to pace from one side of the cell to the other.
The boat ride was unpleasant. Even though none of them had any intention of escaping, the aurors kept a hold on them the whole time in order to ensure that they didn't disapparated. Draco, who’d never traveled by boat before, discovered that he got sea sick easily and had to press his forehead against his knees so as not to vomit. The boat was propelled by magic, clearly, but did they really have to go so fast?
Draco called in his mind, eyes fixed on the boy, following every one of his movements as if his life depended on it.
A mop of black hair caught his eye, and Draco’s heart skipped a beat. He tried desperately not to think too hard about it as he turned, in time with the redhead, to face...
No. Draco would’ve loved for that to be the explanation, but knew he’d be lying to himself if he believed it. It’d been Dorcas. Something about her had caught the attention of that dark, deep part of Draco’s mind that was reserved only for Potter. Maybe it was the Gryffindor scarf, or the determination in her eyes...
Draco stepped back instinctively, and Potter’s expression turned distraught. As though Draco had slapped him in the face.
As quickly as the feeling had taken over, it vanished, and Draco fell, turning and turning, and, again, opened his eyes in a body that wasn’t his.
“Of course! I know I’ve gotten older since the last time we saw each other, but I didn’t think it was that grave!”
“Yeah, I think so. It… It was quite shocking to find out in front of my friends and the Headmaster, I won’t lie.”
Dumbledore was sitting behind his desk. One glance in his direction was enough for Draco to want to cry, and a second one made him want to run away. But he kept his composure. That was one of his specialities, after all.
Evans left the room, quickly followed by that strange version of Potter, whom the teacher had called as well. They were back merely a moment afterwards, and Draco did what he guessed was appropriate for a close friend to do:
The thought came by without his permission, and Draco grew hot. His damn dress was so tight he couldn’t breathe—couldn’t even think straight.
“Yeah, Potter,” she said, glancing at him. “Rumpled hair, never wears his tie properly, severe tendency to break each and every Hogwarts rule… Are you sure you’re feeling all right?”
He found his balance faster than the previous time, his body not following his movements until he’d settled within it.
He ran toward the entrance hall and, in the middle of the screams of agony and the spells and the curses cast around him, he could pick out the voices of his parents calling to him from the Great Hall. He headed there and ran inside, but what he saw left him paralysed only a few steps from the door: his aunt Bellatrix falling on her back, dead, and the Dark Lord yelling. An instant later, Harry Potter appeared out of thin air, in the middle of the Great Hall, taking off his invisibility cloak, and threw up a shield charm. Draco let out a gasp of surprise, felt his hope return. Potter was alive!
“What do you think?” Myrtle crooned. Draco huffed and kept walking. “Just out of curiosity, how much have you figured out already?”
And the most stupid part of it was he’d felt butterflies in his stomach, which made no sense, because, long as it had taken him to realise, he’d known for years he wasn’t into girls. At all. He’d never understood that bizarre boob-obsession phase Blaise and Theo had undergone at fifteen, and he’d not felt any interest in Pansy when she’d confessed her feelings for him at sixteen. Although the last fact had a good reason behind it—his life had crumbled down during his Sixth Year, and he’d been too busy following Voldemort’s orders and avoiding Potter to even consider dating.
That had probably been the worst part of his day, even if his father hadn’t said anything especially awful in it. He’d just updated Draco on his life, telling him they’d taken away his cell-mate and that he’d heard and Auror say the Holyhead Harpies had won the latest match. That he missed him and his mother.
It was a gut-wrenching sound, and it made him understand the instant that he heard it that it was true. His gaze returned, once again, to the bundle in Hagrid’s arms, and then everything happening around him seemed to explode. Potter’s friends were also yelling, and the Dark Lord advanced until he came to a stop in the middle of the circle that had formed in the exterior of the castle. But none of that mattered.
Suddenly, it all seemed too big for him. He wanted to go back to the beginning. He wanted Potter to go back to being the famous kid that had refused his friendship. He wanted his mother to send him sweets every morning. He wanted…
With the same expression Draco had once seen on his parents’ faces whenever they looked at each other.
His mother held him tighter by the arm, and a second, more intense chill ran through his body. He'd just heard the Dark Lord say that he was going to kill him. In that moment, Draco hoped more than ever that Harry Potter really was the Chosen One. It was his only chance.
A knot formed in his throat. Or maybe it wasn’t a knot, but rather a serpent that coiled inside his body. The pressure extended toward his stomach, flooding his lungs, and, for a moment, he forgot to breathe.
What’s that you wanted to tell me? Whatever it is, please hurry—the reek coming from your trousers is more revolting than I can bear.”
His trip to Knockturn Alley in search of a stronger beverage; of something that would wipe out everything that was wrong inside him, even if it would mean wiping out his own self along the way.
And when her expression broke into a smile, Draco took a step back, horrified. Where was the girl he’d shared one of the best moments of his year with? The girl who’d ranted on and on about how insufferable Potter was?
Dorcas threw herself into the woman’s embrace, enveloping her in a giant hug. Mrs Evans held her tightly, looking at Draco fondly over her shoulder.
A chill crept down his back when he heard Potter say his name. He felt people's gazes on him, but he didn’t care, because he was busy trying to understand everything that Potter was saying.
This Potter was far more serious than the one he’d met a few minutes ago. He looked several years older, too, as did Evans. Curiously enough, it wasn’t his height that gave out the difference in years, but rather the severe expression on his face. If there was one thing Draco was good at, it was recognising the weight of war in a Potter’s expression, and it was painfully obvious that the one in front of him knew pain and fear intimately.
*”But what does this matter?” Voldemort answered him. “Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to me and you.” Draco clenched his jaw when he heard him say the boy's last name. “You no longer have the phoenix wand: we duel on skill alone...and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy.”*
His parents began to walk again, escorted by the aurors, but he remained frozen. He couldn’t keep going. His legs began to shake, a yell formed in his throat, and for a moment he thought that he was going to cry.
Draco was crouched low, trying to escape through the main doors of the school without alerting the witches and wizards that ran through the hallways, tending the wounded. His parents were in the Forbidden Forest with the Dark Lord, Crabbe was dead, Goyle was still unconscious in front of the Room of Requirement, and he didn’t have his wand.
“Yes,” Evans said. “Professor Dumbledore, I’m sorry to have disregarded your orders, but I am positive Marlene and Dorcas will be very useful additions to the Order.”
“Yeah, but I don’t get why they bother. They should leave ‘em in here. They definitely could,” the one taking him laughed.
“There’s nothing to worry about, Miss Evans.” Predictably, Dumbledore smiled at the girl as though her lack of discipline was a cause for great pride. “I was perfectly aware you’d bring your friends with you when I asked you to come.”
When he pulled the door open, Myrtle was floating before him, her expression a mixture of puzzlement and curiosity. This wasn’t even her bathroom, and Draco, taken by surprise, came to a halt. At least, he did until she spoke.
During the next two months, the Malfoys were locked in their past. Draco barely spoke to his parents, so he didn’t know what they were forced to remember. He barely ate. He hardly slept. But he did drink all the water that he could, because he couldn’t stop crying.
The auror that had brought him twisted his arm to force him up. Draco got to his feet and left the boat, but the abrupt movement made his head spin. He’d barely gotten to the sand when he turned his head to the side and vomited.
Draco nodded, tense. He didn’t have time to reply; a moment later, they were walking into the office.
He shook himself. The girl that stood before him looked nothing like Potter. She wasn’t wearing glasses, and her hair wasn’t black; it was an intense shade of copper, matching her coarse eyebrows, and her skin was pale with a pinkish undertone. Her only resemblance with Potter save for those impossibly green eyes was the Gryffindor tie that hung around her neck.
They walked up the stairs in silence. Draco, realising his hands were shaking, tucked them in his pockets.
“I hope McGonagall gives Potter a month’s worth of detention for the toilet lid prank,” the girl said as they walked. “If she doesn’t I’m gonna have to visit her office to complain.”
The pain that had taken over Draco’s stomach as he read those words hit him again. Luckily, he’d just reached the statue where Evans, Not-Quite-Potter and a girl who must’ve been Dorcas were waiting for him.
Draco could’ve sworn the stag materialised before Potter had finished the incantation. Suffused in blinding white light, Evans and Potter watched as both animals tilted their heads down and pressed their foreheads together. It was such a familiar gesture, so tender and serene, that the world around them seemed to come to a halt.
Draco didn’t reply. Didn’t have any words. Potter touched his hand again in an all-too-familiar way.
The first thing he noticed when he came to again was that he was… trapped. It was the only way he had of describing it. Trapped in a colourful dress so constricted it perfectly showed the outline of a body that wasn’t his. His hair must’ve been styled in some way, too, going by the painful pull at his temples.
Following Millicent’s lead through the masses of foolishly optimistic young witches and wizards, Draco kept his head determinedly down. He hadn’t glanced anyone from his year yet but he couldn’t help the shame that bubbled up in him at the prospect; the losses of the previous year were still too raw for his presence not to feel like an aberration. Millicent looped a protective arm round his shoulder, pulling him into her side as if reading his thoughts. Draco almost wanted to laugh; at school, Milly had always been the bodyguard to his queen bee.
Fucking hell, that was advanced magic. Draco had to hand it to her. Copies were passed around the room and everyone’s interested seemed to have been piqued.
Since the funeral. That subdued, ill-attended affair. Attending the wake of a Death Eater’s son felt like something akin to drinking in a speakeasy during Prohibition. If anything, it made Draco thank Merlin that the Slytherin’s hadn’t fought; he wouldn’t be caught dead at his own funeral if was as drab as that.
“Thank you, Miss Granger,” McGonagall returned to the stage with the Sorting Hat resting on a wobbly stool. “Without further ado, come up and be Sorted when your name is called.”
They boarded the rickety little boats in twos and Draco was reminded of his first year, when he fit in one boat with Blaise, the Patil twins and Lavender Brown. The place they were now would have seemed unthinkable; Lavender dead, the twins mourning, and Draco left trying to catch a breath whilst picking up the pieces of his old life. Sitting alone with Pansy, he yearned for that budding optimism he felt before the future fell into place.
Shrugging off the silence, he asked, “where are Greg and Theo?”. Millicent suddenly found something very interesting out of the window. Please; Draco had only asked about Theodore Nott for Milly’s sake, that great lumbering git with eyebrows like fat slugs.
Potter sat down gently, placing the old hat on his head. Barely had it touched his hair when it opened its mouth to answer. Here we go, Draco thought.
“…well, I modified it to create a yearbook of sorts!” Hermione continued brightly. “You can write whatever you’d like in your copy, and everyone else will see it in theirs for a one-day period.”
A few whoops came from the Gryffindor crowd. “Future Minister for Magic, right there,” Weasley remarked hotly as the Student President, a title which the seventh year Head Girl was reportedly furious about, made her way up the steps.
Shocked gasps and noises of protest echoed around the room. Draco’s hand’s balled into nervous fists. Somewhere across the room, Mandy Brocklehurst of Ravenclaw started crying.
Ah. Here they were then. Draco thought it quite impressive how Blaise Zabini’s voice managed to carry his signature haughtiness even when muffled. Millicent caught his eye with a slight smirk, then slid open the carriage door.
“Parkinson, Pansy,” was called, and thank Merlin for small miracles, she came back a Slytherin. He smiled at her with relief as Theodore Nott was sorted into Gryffindor. Could the Hat be bribed, Draco wondered?
“Goyle’s, er, not doing so great,” Pansy replied cautiously. The unarticulated agreement to avoid mentioning Vincent at all costs felt dense in the air, trapping words behind Draco’s teeth. “I doubt he’s going to turn up. I haven’t spoken to him since-”
Draco hummed irritably. “Do you really want to spend a whole year repenting? It’s not like us to just lie down and play dead.” He was met with half-hearted noises of acquiescent.
“Eighth years, this way! Yeh won’ be going by carriage this year, get yer selves on the boats with the first years!”
Draco was grateful for the confines of the train’s aisle when Millicent had finally hauled his on board with a quick, “our lot are waiting in the usual carriage”. His luggage was noticeably lighter than years past; he had not thought it quite appropriate to outshine the other students with his collection of superfluous silk robes given the current climate. Oh well, he would find another superficial trait on which to stake his pride and identity, he was sure.
Soon, dinner was to begin and a new year was to be marked. Millicent’s attempts to rejoin them on the way in were repeatedly rebuffed by McGonagall; eventually, she relented and left Draco with an elbow to ribs and a promise of death “if you ever leave me alone in the common room with Sally-Anne Perks.” Parvarti separated from them as they cascaded through the Great Hall entrance way for the feast, the thought of which had reawakened Draco’s stomach. Presumably, she was going to chaperone Potter.
“A friend of my fathers’ who knows Flitwick,” Blaise leaned forward conspiratorially, “tells me that we’re going be re-Sorted this year”.
“Representatives?” Blaise snorted under his breath, receiving a sharp glance from Potter that Draco could sense without even turning around. “More like Potter’s cronies and one token Ravenclaw.”
A delicate laugh from just outside made Draco’s blood ice over. “I told you, Ron, that’s the clock your dad was tinkering with yesterday.”
“Not likely,” Blaise grimaced. “That same friend mentioned something about penalties for students involved in the Dark Arts.”
“You’ve got no right to talk, Zabini,” hissed Potter in a barely contained whisper. Draco suppressed an eye roll. Why does he always have to be so bloody impassioned?
“He stayed over last night, actually.” Remus paused, looking as though he had something he wanted to say. He frowned to himself, resting a hand on the box, then smiled at me quickly. “What’s in the box?” Remus asked.
” Remus exclaimed, and then burst into loud, uncontrollable laughter. “He's single! He and Luna are just close friends!" I blushed deeper, running a hand through my hair and looking away.
“I’m fine.” I insisted before he could get to lecturing me. I pinned my hair and reached down for the kettle, stumbling when I stood up again. My ears rang for a moment, my vision blurring. I shut my eyes tightly and ignored Remus’ muffled voice whispering urgently at me.
“Harry!” He replied in kind, folding the front cover over to keep his page. “How are you?” He looked me over, a small crease appearing between his eyebrows. “You look a bit pale.” I smiled sheepishly, rubbing my head nervously.
“Yes. I didn’t finish the book by the time I was back at work, but you finished it on your own.” That I remembered. I still loved those books.
“I want to.” I insisted. “Come on, we’ll grab a bite to eat.” We stopped in a little pastry store, and I bought us both a hot meat pie, which we ate to keep us warm as we headed to Harry’s house.
books like that, where you get so lost that nothing else exists, nothing but you and the story. I stood up and stretched, groaning quietly and picking up my empty cup. Maybe I’d get a refill for my walk home. It was still pretty chilly out there. I followed my nose over to Harry’s coffee counter, pointedly ignoring Remus winking at me. Good god, what did he say while I was in the zone? Harry straightened up from his little oven, a tray of cinnamon buns in his gloved hands.
on my legs. A week after, they appeared on my upper arms. A month later, they were on my forearms. Remus saw them when they made it to my wrists, when I handed him a cup of tea.
“You try some.” I ripped off a chunk and offered it to him, surprised when he leaned forward and bit it out of my hand.
“You transferred this year, right? How do you like it here? I just moved here for high school myself.”
“People don’t like me at school. They think I’m strange, and they tell stories.” I huffed. Fucking bullies.
I startled when I felt his hand press into mine, gripping my hand lightly. His palm was warm where it pressed against mine. I turned to look at him sharply, surprised and pleasantly so. Harry was looking forward, the slightest blush on his cheeks. I bit back my questions, my heart pounding, and his hand squeezed mine when I faced forward again, a question.
I tuned out while Neville sheepishly went through our introductions, watching Draco watch his friends. He lit up in a different way with his old friends. It was more familiar, less hesitant. I was struck once again with how effortlessly beautiful he was.
but whatever it was about me that caught Hermione’s attention- Oh, bloody fuck. Maybe she was trying to set me up with the Weasley girl. I groaned, hitting my head against the nearest bookshelf.
“Oh, I forgot to tell you!” Harry said suddenly, making me look up as we entered the loft. Only the lamps in the livingroom were on, the rest of the flat being lit by various candles around the room. I could see the kitchen table had been dragged from its usual spot, a frayed tablecloth laid over it, with more candles set out, and a meal for two already plated up. “Er… surprise! We have the place to ourselves for the night.” I looked back to Harry, who was standing by the stairs looking hopeful and bashful. He twisted his hands, gesturing limply to the table, then towards the staircase. “Have a seat, I’ll put the candles on the stairs out.”
“Er, yes…” She was beginning to irritate me, and was moving from innocently curious to pure nosiness.
“It’s…” Sirius dragged out the ‘s’ and skipped across the apartment, Marshy comfortably draped across his shoulders again. “Nine-fifty. You should go down soon.” I wolfed down the last bit of what I was eating, getting to my feet and placing the plate in the sink. Sirius enveloped me in a big hug when I turned around, and I let myself be held, resting my head on his chest. I missed hugs. I missed being here. “I know you don’t want to hear this, Harry,” Sirius whispered.
“No, Draco. You’re going to tell me about this boy. I don’t know anything about him except for that you fancy him!”
After stuttering pathetically, I grabbed a random book and held it up, grinning and mumbling, "Yep, that's the one... Ah, yep. Just gonna open those pages and turn the book. Gonna- yup." Before shuffling past the green-eyed, messy haired god before me. He was seriously gorgeous. I was blushing while I brought the book up to the counter, looking away quickly when Remus smirked at me.
I might actually have a chance! I hadn’t dated anyone since Theo and I tried and failed at a relationship. Sure, there had been attraction between us, but we didn’t connect emotionally any further than friends. I found the author I was looking for originally and picked a book, feeling hopeful and happy. I heard the bell to the shop ring in the distance and made my way over to the counter, placing the book down gently.
I left the store quickly, biting the inside of my cheek to quell my disappointment. Why did I think it would be so easy?
“Keep it as a tip.” I insisted, closing the shop door behind me. As I passed the windows, I looked back to see Harry smiling to himself, putting the change in a cup beside his cash till.
I suffered a panic attack one day during school when our class was shown videos to encourage students against drunk driving. I was so out of it, caught up in memories and grief that the school had to call my aunt and uncle, and when they couldn’t calm me, Remus had to come. Everyone avoided me after that, rumors of schizophrenia and other mental illnesses spreading quickly. The stigma made me into a disease. Luna and Neville were my cure.
“Thanks.” I laughed, going to rub my head before moving my hands to my pockets again. Draco smiled up at me and set his drink down, holding his new book up.
"Hey, Harry. Why don't you go help him out?" Remus suggested quietly. I snapped to attention, nodding at my boss. I crept quietly over to him, not wanting to interrupt.
“It’s different.” I admitted. “I went to a private school before. Things are a bit more relaxed here.”
“I would have been late.” I argued. “I really need this week.” I looked pleadingly at Remus, and he searched my face, frowning. I knew I looked bad. I had been more focused this week, spending more time with medication and therapy than on taking care of myself. I needed to do it though, it was important.
“Your nipples are so tiny,” I couldn’t stop myself from giggling. Harry covered his chest with his hands, grinning.
I was tired by the time I got to Remus and Siri’s apartment, and had to lean against the wall to catch my breath and try not to fall over.
In which we meet Remus and Sirius, get a peek into Harry's life and Draco and Harry become friends for real?
“It’s a long story. Not for winter weather.” He waved dismissively. I realised we had been standing in the cold for a while, and Harry was trembling all over. I nodded in front of us, and we started walking again, Harry nudging me with his shoulder. “I wonder why the kids at your school didn’t see how good you are.” I wrinkled my nose.
“Yes, definitely.” I leaned against his counter, laughing when he shooed me away to wipe it down. “You should get some bar stools here so people can sit and chat.” Harry looked up at me slyly.
I had managed to escape the accident with a broken elbow, broken pelvis and stitches, with only a scar on my forehead and sometimes soreness if I stood too much as a reminder.
“Well.” Remus said, a smile creeping over his face. “Draco, would you like to come upstairs for a moment while Harry makes himself presentable?” I held in a chuckle, feeling an endeared blush come to my cheeks.
“Y-yeah, in the living room.” I pointed in their direction, Harry shooting me a smile and walking over to see them. “Harry...”
“That’s fine, I’ll help you out.” We stared at each other a moment, just grinning, happy. “Yeah, awesome. Cool... See you soon, then?”
“No, it's not bad.” Luna focused on my cheek for a moment. “You know, maybe Draco is right. Maybe we've been hurting you by not talking about it rather than helping you. I never wanted to hurt you, Harry. I hope you know that.” I swallowed the lump growing back in my throat.
“Really, it’s not a big deal,” I supplied, trying to catch Harry’s eye, “we can go when it’s not so cold. Maybe when Neville and Luna are free, too?” Harry finally looked up at me, putting a tiny, false smile on his face.
My heart lurched at the suggestion behind his words- both at the hint that my parents had something to be protective about that was beyond friendship, and at the identifying his godparents as his current parents. I searched his eyes carefully, trying my hardest to ignore the swell and bruise. I realised how close we were standing, truly alone together in the same room for the first time. I felt my hands clam up with sudden nerves, tension flickering between us. I wet my lips, unable to stop myself from stepping closer. Say something charming, I hissed at myself.
“I don’t know how.” He admitted softly. I stopped in front of him, smiling down at his green eyes. The sleeves of his uniform covered his hands, and he pulled them tighter, putting his hands in his coat pockets.
“Sounds good.” I agreed, pulling the door open for Harry. He grinned and stepped out onto the sidewalk.
“Can I ask why?” I wondered politely. Harry froze while pouring the water for my tea, his free hand clenching on the counter.
“Good morning,” The man greeted, rushing forward to shake my hand as Remus and I entered the living room. “You must be Draco. Harry has told us so much about you.”
“No, I know that.” I cut her off, biting my lip. “I think he’s straight.” My mother was quiet a moment, not quite used to these problems either.
“Hey guys.” He greeted them like everything was normal. Neville looked up first, his jaw tightening, but not saying anything except for a polite hello. Luna didn’t even look at him, just holding his hand when he sat next to her, keeping her eyes on the telly. I watched them in shock.
“I know. I just- I don’t really want to talk about it right now, okay?” Sirius pressed his lips together and passed me Marshy, moving over to the small kitchen and pulling a few things out of the fridge.
"Have a good day." The older man laughed. I noticed a long white scar then went from just under his eye to his jawbone when he smiled, feeling a rush of guilt for staring.
It turns out the book I had bought was a romantic drama about a boy who was accepting his sexuality. It was a huge change from the books I usually got, but I related really well to the character and the ending left a fuzzy feeling behind. It wasn't quite as satisfying as an action adventure novel, but I still really liked it. I found myself back in the little shop three days later, browsing the fiction section once again for something similar.
“I hope you enjoy it.” I said sincerely, softly. Draco smiled wider and went back to reading. I bit my lip and stopped myself from squeezing his shoulder, not sure if he was the kind of friend who liked physical affection. Neville and Luna were, allowing hugs and pats when they were especially content. I liked it too, but mostly just with family. I sighed and pulled out the ingredients for my first batch of biscuits, washing my hands and getting started without really thinking about it. My mind wandered, thinking about dinner tonight, how I needed to stop by the grocery and pick up eggs… Maybe some granola bars to keep myself on my feet during the day. The bells startled me and I smiled up at the customer that wandered in, washing my hands so they were free to make their coffee.
“Yeah. Neville and Luna I don’t really understand. Neville is pretty ‘normal’, if not shy. Although Luna has her quirks, she really is lovely... As for me, well, I sort of brought it on myself.” I cocked my head to the side.
Draco was still sitting and reading when I walked downstairs, that little crease between his eyebrows again. I wanted to press my thumb against it and smooth it out. My hands were shoved in my pockets to quell the urge. I slipped by quietly, knowing his type, like Remus, didn’t like to be disturbed while reading. Remus smiled at me when I passed the front counter, and I returned it shyly, putting the kettle on to boil. I made Draco’s usual latte, one sugar and some mint syrup at the bottom. He told me he liked the icy shock at the end the first time I made it for him. I used cream to make a quick feather design on top that I was rather proud of. He looked up quickly when I brought it to him, setting it beside him on the little table.
Remus insisted I see a therapist, something that Draco seemed especially proud and supportive of. Having someone outside my situation to talk to, someone who had seen and heard so much, who was qualified to tell me I shouldn’t feel guilty, changed my whole perspective. My self harm scars healed, and I rarely added more, though the temptation always remained. But having settled into my new little family, it was easy to ask for help on those days, to ask for a distraction. There was no need to hide when I was hurting when I was surrounded by people who loved me.
“No, I’m fine. Just give me a minute to wake up properly.” My mother worried her lip, then composed herself and smiled at me.
I followed Remus up the staircase, allowing myself a smile. At the top of the stairs was a small landing with a door that opened into a homey living room area, with a small couch sitting on one side, and a simple TV stand on the other. Between the two was an ornate rug, and a round coffee table littered with papers and what looked like small animal toys. On the other side of the couch was a small kitchen, cramped, with a dining table and a handful of chairs. There was a lean, if a bit scruffy man standing in the kitchen with a colourful bird perched on top of unruly black curls. He reminded me of Harry, but his eyes were elegantly slanted, and his face peppered with 5 o'clock shadow.
“Okay.” He repeated. “Thanks, Draco.” I smiled and pulled out the money for my earlier latte, along with enough for a refill and the cinnamon bun.
I found myself at a quiet Lunar Cafe on a Friday evening, utterly charmed by the line of tealights I could see from outside, leading up the stairs to the apartment. Harry pulled the door open with a shy smile on his face, placing several small kisses on my lips as greeting.
I woke with a start, rolling over as my mother shook my shoulder. She looked at me with raised eyebrows and a concerned curve to her mouth.
We reached Luna’s house and dropped her off, making our way to Neville’s house. They lived in the older part of Leicester, where the houses looked warm and lived in. After Neville went inside, it was just Harry and I, Harry skipping in front of me and kicking the snow, smiling brightly.
“If they’ve done their job, then I suppose you should.” He looked up into my eyes, smiling easily at me. “I can’t wait to be threatened by your parents.”
“Should go to my bed.” He continued, tilting his head back further and offering his neck to me. I smiled before kissing it again. “Should have way less clothing on.”
“Well, he’s an adult.” Harry chuckled. “Very formal. It comes with his job.” I received a nod of understanding, and I couldn’t look away once I peered down at those green eyes. “We look quite similar, actually, but his hair is longer.”
. That night, curled up on the floor beside my bed, a pair of scissors in my hand, I made ragged lines of
Heh, heh... So hey. I'm alive. I'm also not going to bore you with excuses :) This one feels short, so sorry for that, but hopefully it satisfies.
“Draco...” My father sighed. “I’ve been reading up on homosexuality for months now. I bring it up whenever I can, and never in a negative way. I’ve told you over and over that I don’t mind-“
“It was so stupid.” He murmured, his voice tight and choked. “I was only doing laundry. He was upset because I m-mixed our clothes so I didn’t waste water! Now you had to find out like this, and I’ve ruined everything!” A fresh wave of sobs took over, Harry grabbing my shirt in a violently strong grip. “I’m s-sorry, Draco…” My heart broke at his tone, at the desperation and loss in his voice.
“Is that cheese souffle?” I asked Harry as he returned to the loft, slightly out of breath from going up and down the stairs. He shoved his hands into his pockets, grinning with a shrug.
“No, it's okay. Normal doesn’t really have any meaning, does it?” He forced a smile. “But, if anything gets worse, we need to do something, okay? I don’t want you to have to live like that, however it is. But I’m glad you can open up to me.”
“Actually, my mother is dragging me out of town tomorrow to visit my friends from my old school for the weekend.” Harry’s face fell for a moment, but he quickly smiled at me.
I hadn't noticed before how much taller than me Draco was. It wasn't a huge difference, but enough that if I stood closer, I had to tilt my head back a bit to look at him. God, I wanted to kiss him. But he didn’t want my messed up problems. The fear in his eyes when he saw my bruise... No, I couldn’t do that to him. I didn’t deserve it. I didn’t deserve him.
. I had never seen eyes that that before, and they were… Well, they were beautiful. I suddenly remembered what Luna had told me, the words echoing in my head familiarly.
“So,” I broke the silence that fell over us for a few moments. “If you want to, you, Neville and Luna can come to my flat sometime over the hols to hang out.” I munched on my food and watched his reaction. I knew he would be nervous. Harry bit his lip and put his sandwich down for a moment to pull up his sleeves.
I tried. I really, really tried. When I returned to school a year after the accident, I was a shadow of my former self. My dad’s funeral had been one of the most painful experiences of my life. My shoulder ached with phantom pains for days afterward with the feeling of Siri’s hand clamped on my shoulder. I went through rehab and physiotherapy so I could walk and write again, all paid for by the drunkard who decided he was fine to drive home from the pub before his wife got back from work. The kids at school couldn’t look at me, forget talk to me, and I wore thick jumpers to keep the chill of loss out of my bones, to hide the scars from my surgery. My mum was allowed home after being kept at the hospital for a while, hooked to machines that kept her alive but not living, and me sleepless night after night. I was moved to Vernon and Petunia’s place once we found out mum and dad’s wills clashed; Mum’s asking for me to live with her sister, and dad’s asking for me to live with Remus and Sirius. It was decided that I follow my mum’s wishes, and when she passed, then I would live with Remus and Siri.
I quickly finished it, and fiercely wanted the sequel, where the couple was planning on adopting. It was one day after that that I finally got the courage to return to Lunar Café.
“Hello, Mrs. Malfoy. You have a lovely flat.” Luna breezed over to my mother, taking her hand gently. My mother straightened up proudly at the compliment. “And Mr. Malfoy, your tie goes with your suit perfectly.” My father looked down at himself in surprise, expecting Luna to be afraid. I grinned, trying not to laugh.
“I want to.” he interrupted me, shaking his head. He licked his lip before biting it. “Do you?” He had a wide-eyed, hopeful look on his face. I sighed, captivated by his softness, then laughed, feeling excited in more ways than one.
“Harry and I are planning on going ice skating, and he said he had never been, so I brought some spare skates for him.” I scratched the back of my head sheepishly, “I mean, I didn’t want him to have to deal with gross rental ones, so…”
“I know.” I mumbled. “I know you wanted me to find a wife and have a family, and I know I’ve disappointed you. I tried really hard to be straight, but it’s not who I am. I can’t help it.” I looked away from my father, tucking my hands under my thighs so I wouldn’t fiddle with them. He hated when I did that. It was silent for a moment, and I winced, regretting my words.
“Is it noticeable?” I touched my cheek self-consciously. Luna batted my hand away and started applying more makeup to my face, hiding the bruise from Blaise, Pansy and Theodore. Draco agreed not to tell his friends, saying it was my choice whether I wanted to share or not. Before we went to get them, he helped me apply some ice to the sore spot and a bit of Luna's makeup to hide the darkened skin.
“I know what you mean.” I told him. “I was bullied a lot at my old school, and no matter what I did, I couldn’t stop it.” I shrugged. “I’ve had a lot of pressures put on me, things I was expected to do that I couldn’t...” Harry looked upset, so I trailed off. I hated it when he was sad.
“Hello there,” I laughed, looking at the little candles as Harry dragged me inside. “Did you lose power or something?”
When the floodgates shut, I caught my breath, the familiar smell of my father’s cologne calming me further. My breathing jumped in the aftermath of emotion, but I ignored it to reach for a tissue, wiping my face.
“We always end up snogging in the kitchen,” Harry giggled, fingers locked in my belt loops, hips arched towards me. “We should-” he cut himself off by sighing when I sucked lightly at his neck, leaving a pink mark behind.
“I’ll try.” She threw one, which I caught, and another one directly afterward, which I barely managed to get in my mouth. All three of them burst into cheers, Harry grabbing my arm while he laughed. A shock of warmth went through me where he touched me, and I felt myself blush, looking down while I laughed with them.
“Uh,” I was distracted by his eyes, so green and wide and beautiful against his pale skin and dark hair. “Uh, I don’t think I have a type yet. I’ve only been out since last year. I dated one boy at my old school, but we were better off as friends.” I shrugged, grinning at the memory of my boisterous friend.
“Draco, I don’t think I tell you enough that I love you.” I held myself back from rolling my eyes, my stomach lurching. The last time he told me he loved me was four years ago, at my grandmother’s funeral, when he addressed my mother and I by saying he ‘loved his family’. My father wasn’t very affectionate, to say the least. “I understand that you are a teenage boy, and you’re going to start having thoughts and urges-” I turned to face my father in shock.
“You disgust me.” I told her. “I bet you hardly know him.” I stood, brushing my arm where she touched me, and collected my things. Their group was staring at me with various looks of shock on their faces. “I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.” I nodded in their general direction, and made my way to the cafeteria doors. Harry smiled at me when he saw me, looking a bit scared and very out of place.
“You’re handsome, smart and very charming, Draco. Trust me when I say you will find someone when the time is right.” She squeezed my shoulder and stood up, pausing at my door again. “There are some leftovers in the fridge for you if you get hungry later on. Don’t stay up too late, okay?” I nodded, playing with my sheets absently. My mother sighed and closed the door behind her.
“This is quite a change from your usual.” He commented, clearing his counter to ring it through. I felt myself flush.
“Hey, Siri.” I smiled weakly, flopping down on the floor beside him. “Who’s this?” I moved closer to look at the little guy, who was mostly white with brown patches.
Harry didn’t deserve that. I had seen his sadness. It lingered over him like a fog, dimmed his smiles and weighed him down. He didn’t need anything else to hurt him. I never wanted
“Yeah, in Chelsea.” He looked surprised, his eyes widening behind his glasses. “My father works in the government.” I explained vaguely. “You seem to lack a Leicester accent.” I pointed out. I found the accent rather entertaining, some of them living up to their nickname- Chizzets.
“Oh… Well, he still could have told me. I’m not about to burst into flames because he has a thing for a boy. He knows I don’t care!”
“And tell Luna that I don’t care what the bastards say; if she wants to sit with me at lunch then she damn well can.” He let out a short laugh, nodding again.
been proud of you.” I swallowed around the lump in my throat. “Maybe it’s because I have issues expressing my emotions and thoughts, or maybe it’s because I’m not home as much as other fathers, but whatever it is that’s made you think you aren’t good enough, it needs to stop now.” I felt my lip tremble and bit harshly at it. “I feel like I haven’t seen who you really are in years. Even now, you’re holding your own emotions back.” He moved closer, and I clenched my fists to hold myself still. “I’ve never been more proud of you, Draco. Especially now that you’ve accepted yourself and stood up for yourself. I know how hard that is, Draco. I’ve seen you struggle.” I sucked in a breath, feeling myself tremble.
“Thank you, lovely.” Luna danced forward to kiss my cheek. “Harry is coming soon; he just had to do something for his aunt before he could leave.” I nodded and ushered them out of the front hall, taking their coats and hanging them up for them. My parents had me well trained. My mother came out of my parent’s bedroom, my father trailing her silently.
“Cheers,” he said, lifting his glass towards me, “to being young and beautiful.” I snorted, but gently clinked our glasses together. I was used to the taste of wine, even enjoyed it, as my parents let me have a splash with supper here and there. Harry swallowed his with a pained expression, coughing afterwards. The sight nearly made me spit, and I saved it by laughing into my glass.
“That tie really does look nice, Lucius.” My mother’s voice floated out into the hall, making me grin. I shut the door behind them and faced my friends, grinning.
Thank you so much, everyone, for the supportive comments on my last chapter. It was scary opening up, even to strangers online, but I'm really glad I did. I was furiously writing for days, editing and building on to the half written Chapter Six I made years ago, and pounded out this chapter for everyone, already working on the next. Really, thank you for encouraging my renewed spark of passion for writing. I hope you all enjoy!
“Alright, fine. You’ve got me.” She laughed lightly, a happy sound that made me smile. We sat in comfortable silence before I admitted quietly, “And you may have been right about the other things, too.” Harry’s girlfriend or not, I still really liked her. She was kind and refreshing, and although she seemed a little wacky, she was good company. I wasn’t any less jealous, however, and the fact that she was lovely didn’t help at all.
“Yeah, I can taste it. That’ll taste good if the buns aren’t too sweet.” Harry looked comforted, turning back to the cinnamon buns.
Harry came back from a hallway off the living room, dressed in jeans and a black sweater. I couldn’t help myself from quickly looking him up and down, though I ripped my eyes from him as soon as I could, afraid of being caught by the two older men. Harry picked at his sweater, smiling at me. I got a closer look at his eye, which had darkened considerably since last night, and looked swollen and painful.
"Can I help you find anything?" I jumped and turned quickly, coming face to face with wide green eyes framed by round black glasses.
“Oh, really? Are you worried about your father, dear? He loves you very much and you know he has no issue with your sexuality.”
We met up with Draco’s friend group in some chain cafe, taking up the store’s large circular booth. There was Blaise Zabini; olive toned, darked haired and gorgeous. Then Theodore Nott; tall, wispy, with chestnut curls and shy hazel eyes. And of course Pansy Parkinson; short and curvy, with pale skin and contrasting pitch black hair. We spent some time listening to the three new people fill Draco in on how things were at his old school. Neville sipped away at his drink, politely paying attention. Luna seemed particularly drawn to Pansy’s intense energy. The four chatted away before Theodore slyly mentioned,
“Hey there.” He greeted, smiling. “I thought we lost you. You were pretty deeply into that book.” I flushed, and shrugged.
“Can I bug you for a refill?” I asked, handing him my cup. Harry grinned and took my cup, filling it up the way I liked it, his face going smooth and serious as he made the design on top with cream and a toothpick. He handed it to me with the lid off, a pleased smile on his lips. This time it was a tree, the leaves intricate swirls. I grinned up at him, and he laughed softly, looking away with pink cheeks. I gently lidded my drink and left the money on the counter. “Sit with me tomorrow?” I asked eagerly. He sighed again, nibbling his lip, but nodded slightly. I smiled and did up my coat, slinging my bag over my shoulder. “See you tomorrow, then.”
“Yes.” He said surely, wiggling his fingers above him. He stared up at the sky, his arms falling to his sides. “Let’s go. Just you and me.” A little shudder went through him, his voice going quiet. “It’s so far away...” I started walking again, touching his elbow gently.
"Hello, Harry." A dreamy voice floated out of the shop I was standing near. I looked up to meet the eyes of my friend Luna, who was bringing the flowers from outside back into the store. Why they were outside in the first place was beyond me- they were covered in frost already. She worked in the curio shop, owned by the local fortune teller Madame Trelawney. I panted and raised a hand in a wave. "You're late again, huh? How's your mother?"
“Do you remember when I slipped on ice one year and threw my back out?” He asked me suddenly. I nervously glanced at my father, shook my head. “You were six years old, in second year of primary school. Since I had to take time off to heal, I could spend more time with you than before. I used to read a book to you every night to get you to fall asleep. Do you remember?” I thought back, through fuzzy memories of sing-along-songs and wobbly-drawn pictures hung on the fridge.
“We’re closed to- Oh, Draco.” Remus stood up from his desk at the front. “Well, I’m glad I didn’t lock the front door now.” I smiled sheepishly, adjusting my grip on the box.
“Sorry.” I mumbled. “Thanks for the sandwich. I’ll see you later.” He followed me to the door, his face drawn with sorrow.
“Don’t...” He murmured. Even his resistance seemed tired, unenthusiastic, like he didn’t really want to say no to being taken care of.
“How do I look?” I asked Sirius. He looked at me for a long while, a sad sort of smile meeting his lips.
"No, just looking." I pursed my lips and looked straight ahead to hide my ridiculous grin. Harry eyed me suspiciously, but let it go. We walked in silence, our hands brushing every now and then.
“Thank you.” She exited my room, throwing me a strange look, and then closed the door behind her. As soon as her footsteps faded, I threw off my blankets and looked down at my lap dejectedly. “What are you doing?” I chided myself. “That’s completely inappropriate!” My length strained back at me, rebelling against my conscience. I know it was a natural part of being a teenager, but that didn’t make it any less embarrassing! Harry would be horrified if he knew I went around getting stiff from thinking about him! I groaned in humiliation, swinging my legs out of bed and standing up. I had no time to wank this morning, I was already behind. With one last glare at my crotch, I picked up my bundle of clothes for the day and headed towards the bathroom.
“We’ll go to the moon then.” I agreed. “And have tea with the stars.” Harry looked at me, a little frown on his lips, before trying a sad little smile.
I was sitting by myself at a table in the school’s cafeteria with a book in my hand, just the way I liked it, when someone plopped themselves into the chair across from me. I looked up, my best scowl on my face, which I almost lost when I realized who it was.
“I’ve known him barely a month. I still don’t even know for sure if he likes boys.” I glanced at my father, blushing at the expression on his face. I finished making my tea, forgetting about letting it steep, and went to leave the room. “I think I’ll go to my room for the night.”
I closed the door gently behind me and walked to the kitchen. I grabbed my bag off the floor, glaring at Dudley as I grabbed one of my apples from the counter. He had stolen one yesterday, and I was still angry.
“It’s a good book. You work here; surely you get absorbed in books sometimes?” I defended myself. Harry scratched behind his head when he pulled his oven mitt off, a regular habit of his.
“She’s not doing well, then?” I shook my head. Sirius rubbed my knee, squeezing the knobby joint. I let him comfort me and murmur to the ferret while I ate, trying to stop the shaking in my hands.
“I- well, I’ve never had a pet, really. But I do love them, of course. My father has an allergy.” I felt the need to explain.
more for you.” He started shaking his head, pulling back to look up at me. Tears clung to his eyelashes, and he wiped them away impatiently, his nose pink and eyes red-rimmed.
Harry was a fantastic cook, and I didn’t shy from telling him so, humming with pleasure as I ate. We talked, the topics going off course as the wine set in and I felt my face flaming up. He finished the meal by unceremoniously setting our dishes in the sink and returning with another full glass for me, his with white wine to try out.
"Remus, I'm so sorry I'm late!" He said, his face softened with apology. My angle gave me a perfect view of bright green eyes. That boy was bloody cute. The man at the counter softened, sighing at the boy.
“Oh, it’s confusing. Here, let me...” I turned the telly on and handed her the remote, letting her change it to a cooking show.
We both startled at the sound of footsteps coming down from the upstairs apartment. Harry padded down the stairs, looking cute with socked feet and baggy sweatpants.
“There’s a sandwich shop down the street- bye, Remus.” Harry interrupted himself to wave at his godfather, who smiled at us and nodded, returning to his paperwork. “I heard they’re good.”
“I’m Luna Lovegood. You must be Draco Malfoy. Harry told me about you.” No hand was extended towards me; just her gray eyes looking into my own. I bit the inside of my cheek and buried my face in my book.
I made a tumblr, there's not much on it right now, I don't go on tumblr a lot, but I'm hoping it will help me stay consistent with my posting, so if you're interested, it's
I managed a polite reply as Harry dragged me back toward the stairs, firmly shutting the door behind us. We walked down into the main bookstore, Harry’s hand still lightly clamped on my arm.
to hurt him. Asking me not to say anything if something was hurting Harry was like asking a honeybee not to make honey. Neville and Luna stared at me solemnly, and I huffed, nodding. Fine, I would try not to. But if something bad was happening, then I was going to step in. That was just who I was. Our serious moment was broken by the sound of the door being softly knocked on. Luna and Neville scurried back into the living room, and I turned to open the door.
“Because it’s with another boy?” I called back, feeling uncomfortable with myself for a moment. As much as my father said he was okay with my sexuality, I know he still wished I was straight.
“I recommend the White Chai, but you look like an Earl Gray kind of man.” He considered me while he washed his hands. “Let me guess… A splash of milk and barely a teaspoon of sugar. You like it strong.” I blinked, very impressed.
“Sirius, don't be embarrassing.” Remus chastised softly. He smiled warmly at the man, then at me. “This is my partner, Sirius. And his feathered friend is Honey- just a visitor.”
There was a girl with long blonde hair at the coffee counter, wearing a denim skirt and bright neon leggings, bundled up in an orange coat. She was talking quietly to Harry.
Even on my bad days, when my therapy appointments ran into our date night, and we spent the time pulling the pieces of my heart back together instead of snogging in the back of the cinema. Or when I found myself lashing out at him, an ugly jealousy rearing its head when he cancelled on our plans to help his parents out. He surprised me time and time again, giving me the time and space I needed to gather myself to apologise. He surprised me by always forgiving me, with gentle smiles and accepting my gifts, instead of anger and ultimatums. He surprised me by loving me so fiercely, and gently, and fully. He surprised me by allowing me to love him back.
“Alright, dear. Don’t forget to take a shower. I’ll have breakfast ready for you before your father leaves.” I smiled back at my mother, albeit more strained than her smile.
“Before,” he said, eyes darting around my face as he spoke, “When I was with my parents, before everything happened, I used to feel so anxious all the time. Like, I had anything I could have wanted, and it could be taken from me at any time.” Harry touched my cheek with gentle hands. I let him speak. “And then it was. And I thought I would break.” His voice cracked, and he swallowed tightly, pressing his lips together. “Maybe…” he breathed, looking down at my lips. “I think I did, actually.”
“Yeah, okay. Let’s go.” I left a tip on the table, tugging my coat on along with Harry, who looked distracted. We started back towards the cafe in an awkward silence. I poked his arm and stuck my tongue out at him when he looked at me. Harry gave me a weird look and looked forward again, a smile coming to his lips. That’s what I wanted. I poked him again, making a ridiculous face at him when he looked back at me. “What the-? Stop!” Harry laughed and bumped into me on purpose, shoving me to the side playfully. I grinned like a demon and pushed him back, Harry taking his hands out of his pockets and pushing me again, staying close to me as we continued walking. I smiled at a girl that walked by, my hand brushing against Harry's. I looked over at him, but he was looking away. It seemed like he hadn't even noticed. I brushed my hand against his again, longer and on purpose, but he didn't even blink. I grinned at him. He was so handsome... I had been thinking about that a lot, how handsome he was. Harry turned those green eyes on me and I felt myself melt...
I sat down, trying to contain the smile on my face. I was pleasantly surprised to find a french inspired meal- my favourite style of food. There was a healthy serving of ratatouille, a nicely seared steak to accompany it, and what looked like-
“Yeah, but I’m going upstairs to get a bite to eat before I start. Uh, want to come with me?” Draco looked surprised, and a bit pleased, but he shook his head no. “Okay. See you in a bit.” I waved shyly and walked up the stairs, catching Draco looking at me before he went back to his book. Draco was really handsome, and his eyes were brilliant. It was kind of distracting. He had taken to hanging out with me while I worked, and though I really enjoyed having him around, I felt a bit guilty. I felt like I was taking time out of what was really important. But I couldn’t- didn’t want to stop.
“I’m sorry; I’m not laughing at you.” He assured me. “I don’t have a problem with it. You looked so worried though, I had to diffuse the tension.”
So what do you guys think, anyone who still follows this story and is interested to see where it goes? I still have a rough skeleton of where this was meant to go… should I try to pick this up from where I ended? I would love to rewrite the nearly the whole thing at some point, even. Please let me know in the comments if anyone is interested in more Lunar Cafe. I think I'll be able to get even deeper into the complexity of this subject matter with all the growing I've done.
“No, father. May I be excused?” I asked, avoiding the question. My father nodded his head and I cleared my plate, scraping the remains into the trash before retiring to my room. It wasn’t long before my mother followed me, sitting beside me where I laid on my bed.
“If you’re getting involved with my godson, you’ll take good care of him.” Sirius interrupted. I met his intense gaze, blinking under the scrutiny. “Harry is one of the best things that’s ever happened to us. He doesn’t realise how much he means to us. You’ll be good to him.”
“Your father is the breadwinner of your family, and puts a lot of pressure on you in terms of your future.” I considered this, but still didn’t buy it.
him like nothing else in the world, and though it sounded really cheesy and adolescent, it was true. We had gotten really close, but I just wanted more. I wanted to hold his hand, or lean over and kiss him when he was being particularly cute. I wanted him to smile and stop pressing on his stomach and stop frowning at the mention of family. I wanted him to
“Lu, what are we doing?” I asked once the bathroom door was shut behind us. Luna smiled and pulled a powder compact out of her sweater pocket.
“Oh, hello! We meant to be out of your way before you arrived, sorry.” My mother apologised. I rolled my eyes.
“Yeah, yeah. Harry’s just-” She cut herself off, looking down at her hands. “Well, it’s more his aunt-” She paused again, shaking her head. “Not really, it’s actually his uncle... ” I raised my eyebrows expectantly. “It’s just not a good sign when he has to be late.” She finished vaguely, Neville crossing the living room to join us.
“Look what Remus suggested for me.” I took the book, careful to keep his place. “It’s about immortals and a war with giant bugs. How cool is that?” I smiled and looked down at Draco’s bright eyes. I loved that look. I loved that kind of look on anyone. Knowing someone had something that made them happy made me happy. Whether it was through a book, or a coffee, I always wanted to give people that look in their eyes. That’s what Lunar Café was about. That’s what I was about. Making people happy. I handed Draco his book back, my heart sinking when I thought of my mother.
“Oh,” Pansy said suggestively, watching Luna and I approach, “The lovers return.” Luna and I laughed together, and Neville hid a smirk.
“I’ve looked for you.” I said quietly, not wanting Remus to overhear us. Harry paused, looking over at me. A bit of his hair fell from where he pinned it back and I wanted to tuck it back. I slipped my hands beneath my thighs. “I… Are we friends?” He looked surprised.
“I know.” Luna pulled away and put her makeup back in her pocket, holding my hand and kissing my knuckles.
“Excuse me.” A voice startled me out if my staring, a girl with curly brown hair brushing past me and reaching for a book.
.” I swiped at my eyes, rubbing away tears. “I... Siri and Remus say I should think about-” I cleared my throat, a lump suddenly appearing and blocking my words. “That it’s time to let you go. I don’t want to, but Vernon keeps saying how expensive it’s getting, and Dr. Inoue- er, Makoto, she told me you might not be waking up... since it’s been over two years...” I sat up, looking down at my lap. “Mum, if you’re still in there, I really need you to wake up.” My voice wobbled, and I fought to control it. “I know you can do it. I s-still have hope. Please...”
“Draco, I really don’t think that Harry is straight. I love my godson, and I keep his secrets, but it’s really not a secret.” He sighed, leaning forward on one hand. “He tries to be straight because he wants to have one thing that makes him normal, but I can almost guarantee that he’s as straight as you are.” So, maybe I
“I’m a veterinarian at the animal shelter,” Sirius explained briefly, “And I have a few stowaways almost constantly. Do you like animals, Draco?”
“So when you want to kiss me, you can. And if you want to spend more time together, just the two of us, you can tell me.” Harry kept his eyes locked on mine, eyebrows twisting up with a hint of guilt. “I know I’ve been through a lot, but I want you to be happy just as much as you want me to.” He smiled then, a suggestive twist of his lips followed by his teeth catching his lip. “And I want to fool around with you just as much as I hope you want to.”
I liked my new friends. They were all quite different people, which made hanging out with them new and exciting, and entertaining each time. Luna was... herself. She always wore cool or strange jewelry and was quite affectionate towards Harry and Neville. She also liked to read tarot cards for all of us and ask us if she was right the next day, which she often was. Neville was a bit awkward, though not as much as I was, and had a talent for taking care of plants. He and Harry met while working at the café and have been friends ever since. He was a bit shy, but opened up quickly once he got used to me. I didn’t understand why no one else at the school wanted to hang out with them. They were all very kind and hilarious, and loyal towards each other. They were both especially protective of Harry, which is probably why they tagged along on our not-really-date night.
“Hey!” He cried out, mock outraged. I saw his scars, then. From his shoulders down to his wrists. Some were white from age, and some still pink and healing. I felt my mouth open a bit, but somehow I wasn’t as shocked as I thought I would be. “You okay?” he asked tentatively when he saw my face, his hands dropping from his chest. I looked up and was struck by how beautiful his eyes looked in the low light. They were such a pure, glowing emerald, with only one fleck of brown near his right pupil. I reached for him, and he climbed onto my lap, holding my face between his hands.
“See that boy at the doors? That’s the kind you want to stay away from. He and Luna are total freaks. Not the sort of people you want to be seen with.” She smiled at me, like she was doing me a favour.
“It might be rough next week, but it’ll be fine after that.” I dropped my voice down to a whisper when Siri joined me, his bare feet padding against the floor. “I just want to be with mum.” I swallowed when my voice cracked. “Just for the last bit.” Siri sucked in a breath, sitting down beside me with his legs crossed. He traded me my sandwich for the ferret, rolling it over on his lap and rubbing its belly.
“I just...” He breathed deeply, letting out a long sigh. “I’m trying really hard, Draco.” He sounded exhausted, refusing to meet my eyes. “I want to be strong and together, but I just...” He looked away, biting his lip as his eyes watered. “I
“Actually, the ones I was buying before were a change from my usual. I have a thing for fantasy and adventure. I like the action.” Remus nodded thoughtfully.
I can't believe Lunar Cafe is finally finished! Thank you so much to everyone who stuck by my inconsistent uploads and continually inspired me to start writing again. This story has been there as my outlet years ago and healed me to write and finish. Thank you so much guys- I hope you find happiness wherever you are, because you deserve it.
“Yes, I’m actually quite horny these days,” he said, a giggle escaping his lips. I felt my own face break into a smile, a tense leap of interest in my stomach nearly making me gasp.
“I…” I paused, chewing my lip hesitantly. This was my mother, though. I could tell her anything. “I feel lonely.” I whispered. My mother’s hand paused in my hair, but continued to my shoulder, where she rubbed soothingly.
“I miss you.” I whispered to my mum, “You and dad.” My breath caught in my throat, and I coughed so I could breathe again. “It’s kind of bad here right now. I just-” A sob tore its way out of my chest. “I just miss how much you loved me, and how much I loved you. I miss being
“Whatever you're thinking,” he said, “You're wrong. You've got that self-deprecating look on again.”
“Quite.” He murmured, and stood up, leading me to the fiction section. “You may enjoy this one.” He pulled a fair sized book out of the shelf and handed it to me. I looked down at the cover, touching its spine.
A peek into Harry's home life, movie night with the group and Draco has a talk with his father. Enjoy!
My parents and I had moved to Leicester just a month ago, making ourselves comfortable in our large apartment. The move took a long time, with me still completing my first term and my father wrapping up his affairs in London. I jumped into school just after first term, after the Holidays, and I missed being on break already. I walked past the book shop/coffee shop twice a day five times a week; when I walked to and from my school. Lunar Café. It looked cozy and welcoming, and I just couldn't resist anymore.
“What are you talking about? Your ex boyfriend Theo is what?” Neville asked. He smiled at me, waiting for me to continue. Luna raised her eyebrows, grinning. They didn’t care. Didn’t even miss a beat. I smiled widely, sitting straighter in my seat.
“I know, mother.” I couldn’t help the next part, which just leapt out of my mouth before I could stop it. “But he’s so sweet…” She smiled knowingly.
Luna didn’t approach me anymore after the one day we sat together, and I think it had to do with how Hermione told me I didn’t want to be seen with ‘Loony’ Luna Lovegood. Of course, I ignored her. Popularity meant nothing to me. It was all rather childish if you ask me, and I never approved of any kind of bullying, especially after what I went through. I never saw Harry in school, even though I kept my eyes open for him every day, looking between classes and at lunch. Wherever he hid, I wanted in. It must be peaceful.
I cried for the nights I spent as a child waiting for Father to come home and read me my story. I cried for sleepless nights, bouts of panic and anxiety I had throughout secondary school over grades I didn’t think were good enough. I cried for the years I spent through puberty hating myself every time I watched a boy walk by me, for feelings I stifled, repressed and abhorred. I
“Yeah, that’d be great.” Neville blushed and smirked at me, and I went into my kitchen to grab the snacks and a few cans of pop. I returned after a moment, finding Luna struggling with the TV remote and Neville face-palming beside her.
“I saw you the other day at the shop, but we didn’t get to speak. Harry has been having a hard time lately, but of course, it isn’t my place to speak of Harry’s business.” I slowly let my book rest on the tabletop. No gossip? No rumors? Miss Lovegood wasn’t like the other teenagers here. It was almost… refreshing. “You don’t have to guard yourself with me. I’m very open-minded.” I blinked.
I brushed snow off my shoulder and stomped my feet before entering the shop, tugging my coat off and making my way to the coffee counter. I didn’t have the energy to greet Remus, whose worried look I could feel at the back of my head. I felt dizzy and shaky, bracing myself against the counter after I straightened up from getting my apron.
“Okay.” I agreed easily. Harry attempted a smile, and I flung an arm around his shoulders. “I won’t force you to talk about it, but if something’s bugging you then you know you can talk to me, right?” Harry smiled again, this time with his eyes as well.
