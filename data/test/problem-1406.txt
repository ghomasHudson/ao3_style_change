“What other way would you propose learning it?” McGonagall responded, but she was holding back a small smile. “Is this something you would be interested in, then?”
Other teams only won by catching the Snitch before them.”
Something in his expression must have given him away because Hermione’s warm smile faded and she regarded him with a question in her face.
Draco had always been drawn to Potter, there was no denying that. And this year, as the animosity between them had somehow melted away and an unlikely friendship had bloomed, Draco had been very careful in how he acted around Potter. Potter had this strange ability to make Draco open up, to make him feel comfortable in sharing his feelings and his past. He was a good listener, and he was inherently trustworthy, but more than that—Draco
Yes, it was just so incredibly lucky that he was to spend another year at Hogwarts with Harry bloody Potter.
“Not really. Quidditch season doesn’t start for another month. You?”
and Draco had the mad, fleeting thought that he should’ve
While he was here, Draco decided he may as well have some tea, starting the kettle with a swish of his wand and settling into one of the comfortable armchairs. After the busy day he had had, he felt he had earned it, though he couldn’t really complain of good business.
The tone of her voice made it clear this was not a suggestion.
Potter didn’t speak, only kept breathing hard and fast, and then it dawned on Draco. He was hyperventilating. It seemed so obvious, but Draco would never have expected it of
While it
Ron nodded emphatically. “Nadine Bellemore tried to confront Ginny about it. Threw a hex at her and everything.”
Ashworth and Waya had been delighted when Harry had reported that Draco had managed to cast a corporeal Patronus. Waya also gave him a knowing look at Harry’s use of Draco’s given name, and he didn’t quite know what to make of that.
weren’t they? They had to be better at spotting details than this.
“I hate my job,” he said. “I know I should be grateful, because no one wants to hire a Death Eater, and the Ministry only allowed me to have this job so they could keep an eye on me or whatever, but it’s been years. My boss hates me, he’s never going to promote me, so I’m stuck in this mid-level position forever, and it’s
“If you want, you can just ask her, you know. I’m sure she wouldn’t mind making some.”
“Just since we got back, I think. But they’ve clearly liked each other for a while now.”
“Yes,” Draco replied, already prepared for her to make a ‘Loony’ Lovegood joke, and knowing full well he couldn’t be defensive, as he’d said far worse about the Ravenclaw in the past himself.
“There’s Marcus Flint, I suppose, but he’s horrible. Ernie Macmillan, arguably even worse. Theo, of course. Longbottom’s a war hero now, he might be considered desirable from a reputational standpoint, perhaps.”
“Come sit,” Ollivander beckoned him, and Draco obediently went to sit in the chair across from the old wandmaker, placing the wand—the wand
He had finally acknowledged that it was possible Muggles were far smarter than he ever gave them credit for. He allowed himself to be impressed by Muggle innovations and even found himself agreeing with some of Violet’s ideas for the further integration of Squibs into Wizarding culture.
Draco almost snapped at him to make himself useful and help him and Granger with their research, but he doubted Potter would prove to be particularly helpful in this situation.
So he walked over and plopped his bag down, taking a seat across from Theo, who looked up at the sound.
Slughorn flicked his wand and words began to appear on the board.
He found that he wanted to trust Potter. Everyone did. Potter was the trustworthy type. The kind of man people confessed their secrets to, the kind of man people left their children with, the kind of man everyone was somewhat in love with, the kind of man who saved the world and didn’t even want to be thanked for it.
“Pardon me, but you didn’t even seem capable of
“Hi Draco!” she said, cheerily. “Looking for Theo?”
Polkey, one of the two remaining Malfoy house elves, had found him and managed to pry the knife away from him. She had then immediately tried to punish herself with the knife and Draco had had to yell at her to get her to stop. He then made her promise not to tell his mother, and had her make herself a cup of tea to calm down.
But the feeling of fear that he associated with the war hadn’t left him. He still woke up in cold sweats from nightmares featuring snakelike eyes and green light. He kept expecting to wake up and find himself in the Manor under Voldemort’s control, as if this unusual post-war world had all been a strange dream.
Draco looked up at him.
“I don’t know. I thought I would have more to do, planning for my classes and all, but I won’t have as many as I thought.”
“I thought that, instead, I would have it announce me as your mentor,” McGonagall continued. “If anyone asks, you can tell them you’re undertaking a Transfiguration apprenticeship. I will, of course, go along with this story.”
A wisp of silvery mist shot out of his want, twisting and spinning. Draco watched it, transfixed, as it danced around him before slowly fading away.
Harry didn’t really want to think about where his year was going to stay. He wanted to stay in Gryffindor Tower. He knew it was hard-headed and selfish of him, but all he wanted was to stuff himself full of treacle tart, crawl into his old four-poster, and sleep for the next few days.
“He’s without his mother though,” Draco said, as the adolescent Thestral sat beside him and rested his head in his usual position in Draco’s lap.
“Afraid we’re out of treacle tart, we mainly only make it on Mondays and Wednesdays, but I hope you enjoy this,” she gestured to the Manchester tart in front of Harry, which—he had to admit—looked delicious.
Day by day, he became more comfortable there. He walked into a few shops, and was even tempted to buy an elegant blue shirt before he remembered that with the time loop, he wouldn’t be able to keep it. He ate at a Muggle restaurant for lunch one day, and found that he even preferred how they cooked their meat.
Malfoy sighed, focusing back on the potion, but answered, in a low voice.
Neville flinched, but held his wand steady.
When she had first moved in, Harry was still in a rather low place, attending sessions with Irving Locke and working as a trainee at Keswary School of Magic, but not feeling up to much else. Hermione hadn’t told him off the way he had expected, but rather suggested they try to redecorate the place, and continue the work of going through and getting rid of a lot of the remaining dark artefacts. It had taken a long time, but eventually, together they managed to make it feel more like a home. Harry felt a slight pang of longing, wishing Sirius had been there to see it, but for the most part, it helped him feel a bit lighter and he knew he wouldn’t have even thought to do it without Hermione.
“It varies over time. And of course, rates only include those who openly discuss the experience with survey-takers. It seems to be less common these days, somewhere around six or seven percent.”
Potter groaned.
“Teaching.”
“That wand went on to defeat He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,” Ollivander continued, a sombre look crossing his face. Draco felt his stomach drop. The conversation had arrived, as many did these days, at the war.
Draco stared at her, and he felt oddly touched. Violet didn’t need to give him an explanation. Quite frankly, he didn’t deserve one. And yet, she had trusted him—a Death Eater—enough to tell him that her little sister was a Squib. She didn’t think him a bad person—which was more than he could say for most people.
Harry looked at him. It was a strange thing to say.
“When you’re told something your whole life, over and over, it becomes reality,” he said, trying to sound more sure of himself than he felt. “It’s ingrained in you. It’s a part of you. You almost become blind to anything that contrasts it or outside of it, because the tunnel vision can get so strong. When all of a sudden, the belief—that purpose—vanishes, it can leave you feeling lost. Even if it was…horrible and wrong and something you’re glad to be rid of, you can still feel like it’s missing from you, like you need to search for it. Like it’s just around the corner waiting for you.”
“I’ll ask her,” she said.
“I had just been taught some spells early,” he said.
to me?”
“Are you asking me out on a
“Why did you do it? Take the Dark Mark, I mean?”
“What is it, Potter?” Draco asked, raising his eyebrows at him as they reached the top of the stairs on the fourth floor.
Draco looked at Potter’s hand around his wrist and then up at Potter’s face. He was so
He looked somewhat put off, and Harry weighed the benefits of asking more questions. His friendship with Draco was still rather fresh, and he didn’t know where the lines were, how much he was allowed to ask. Draco was a remarkably private person, always pausing and looking like it took incredible effort to reveal any information about himself.
“Alright, then,” Draco said, walking over and taking the other seat at the table, smoothing down his robes as he sat.
Draco, to his own horror, felt himself flush as Slughorn’s eyes fell on him.
“Erm, up and a bit to the left, almost like you’re watching a Quidditch match.”
Draco didn’t want to admit that frankly, no, he didn’t understand.
“Are you doing alright?” he asked.
make everything difficult, Potter? Me? Tell me what potion we’re making. Go on,” Draco slammed the textbook shut as Potter’s eyes automatically moved to it. “That’s what I thought. Tell me the main difference between using pomegranate juice and lavender water as a base. The effect ginger root has in potions. How to withdraw a lionfish spine without spilling its venom. Can’t answer any, can you? But that’s fine, because
to take the Dark Mark. That was the narrative that all the Death Eaters pushed, that only those who proved their loyalty and devotion to Voldemort were
He was glad to see the pint of knotgrass mead put in front of him—it was still too early for Firewhisky, at least for him. Seamus and Ron had gone ahead and started with the hard liquor, but then, they were probably the ones who could handle it most.
Hermione gave him a little smile.
“Er, then why did you write to him?” asked Ron.
He narrowed his eyes.
“Photoshoots?” he asked, wavering.
Something about this trip on the Hogwarts Express wasn’t sitting right with Harry. If he were to voice this thought, he was sure Hermione would respond with something about it having been longer than a year since they made their last trip, or perhaps something to do with how Hogwarts has forever changed in their minds after the Battle. Both were valid points, but they weren’t what was sticking out to Harry.
“I’m well,” Draco said, his voice distant and polite and sounding nothing like the Draco from Hogwarts—before or after the war.
“You don’t think so?” he asked.
Ginny had noticed, and managed to catch his eye. She furrowed her eyebrows at him and mouthed something like, “You alright?”
Draco’s eyes widened. He was constantly taken aback at how he had never noticed Violet until this year when she was possibly the most Slytherin of them all.
not to,” Violet was saying, more to the room at large than directly to Draco. “I bet none of them even know that the Americans have been to the moon.”
“What do white tulips symbolize, Malfoy?” Potter asked, in a calm and steady voice.
“You alright?”
“I only argue when I’m right,” Draco responded easily, looking up at Nott and smiling back at him. “Here you are.”
Harry didn’t understand Malfoy’s sudden change in demeanour. He was suddenly quieter, more withdrawn. He had pulled his hand back and away from the table.
Harry sighed. He didn’t really want to deal with Malfoy’s sarcasm today.
“I dunno, Hermione,” he’d said, honestly. “It wouldn’t be the same, would it?”
Draco was once again sitting beside Potter in the Quidditch stands, watching as Ravenclaw and Gryffindor battled it out in the pitch. The two Houses were neck-and-neck in the race for the Quidditch Cup, making it a rather intense game.
“That’s very kind of you,” he said. “But I must decline. Christmas is a time for family, I wouldn’t want to intrude.”
a little voice in his head chimed in, unhelpfully.

When he tugged on Potter’s hair, he remembered washing it under the warm spray of the showerhead. When he kissed across Potter’s face, he remembered the splattering of blood across his cheeks, the blank look on Potter’s face as he shook from head to toe. When he wrapped his arms around Potter to pull him closer, he thought of falling asleep with Potter in his arms.
“Are you daydreaming again, Potter?” Malfoy’s voice brought Harry back to the present, and Harry blinked rapidly and looked at him, trying to pretend he had been paying attention. Malfoy snorted, clearly not fooled.
“You know, I think I might just go now,” he said.
Kreacher was an odd elf, and Harry frequently could not understand his behaviour, but once in a while, he would just do something
He supposed it was for the best, since Malfoy clearly had a better handle on what they were doing. He let Harry prepare some of the ingredients, like sifting through the iguana blood or dicing the pixieweed. Sometimes he’d criticize him for how he was doing it, but Harry came to realize it wasn’t out of malice, but rather a side effect of how perfectionistic Malfoy really was. Sometimes he’d even be…
“No,” Harry admitted.
“Yes, yes,” Draco said, rummaging in his desk drawer until he found a Knut to put in the owl’s pouch. “Here’s your Knut.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, grinning. “Yeah, I am. Are you saying yes?”
For several loops now, he was journeying into Muggle London. The first day had been stressful; he had been hyper-conscious of himself, unsure what to do with his hands without the large comfortable pockets of his robes. Thankfully, Muggle fashion had somewhat gone into style in the Wizarding world, so he was at least used to the trousers and button-up he fished out of the back of his wardrobe. It had been a while since he had had a reason to wear it, a while since he had gone out anywhere besides work.
Malfoy snorted, derisively, taking a swig out of his jar.
no better or worse than Draco, and not particularly different—beyond the knowledge of and ability to perform magic.
“It is a facet of wandlore that is particularly difficult to study and thus, difficult to understand. Magic can be fickle at the best of times, and since wands are imbued with a special form of magic, but are not sentient beings, what can cause a wand to bend its allegiance is not always clear or constant. As you know, certain wand woods are more faithful than others, and generations of wandmakers have tried to understand why that it. When purchasing a new wand, it is largely a matter of trial and error, testing wands until one chooses to yield its allegiance. Where it gets more tricky is when wands are won or inherited. Wands form strong bonds with their original owners and these bonds are not given up on easily. Even when wands are won, there is no guarantee that it has been completely mastered. Wands have different personalities, and many have various conditions that must be fulfilled before their allegiance will switch over.”
“I do stupid things, Ron!” exclaimed Harry.
but somehow, it just wouldn’t
Draco wanted to refuse it all. He wanted to send any of Potter’s forthcoming owls back without opening them, the way he did all those years ago when he had felt his heart breaking. But he couldn’t help it, he wanted to know what Potter was up to, what was going on in his life. He had managed to keep his curiosity at bay all these years, keeping it satiated through his meticulous scanning of the Prophet for any mention of Potter, and—admittedly—occasionally caving and asking Luna for news, consistently failing to seem nonchalant. Luna could see through him like glass. Closing off Potter the first time had been hard enough, he wasn’t sure he had it in him to do it again. Potter just waltzed back into his life and Draco knew he wouldn’t be able to shut him out this time.
Draco met his eyes with a deadpan expression.
To add to Draco’s shock, Dumbledore was smiling at him, his eyes crinkling as they regarded him.
“Do I think she would mind if Harry Potter expressed interest in supporting her proposal? Of course not, Potter, she would be chuffed to bits.”
“Mainly for all the times he called me a Mudblood. He also told me he was always jealous that I did better than him in classes. He went rather red at that.”
“Yes, I need to get some new parchment and ink. Are you?”
Hermione’s eyes flashed back to him in an instant.
The prospect of going to work again, of those same exact court documents staring him in the face…it was too much. Even as he dressed, he felt himself protesting the action. What was the point? He had enough trouble convincing himself his work mattered on a regular day.
“It’s still strange,” Draco insisted, as Potter cheered when Slytherin Chaser Angela Hawkins managed to snatch the Quaffle from the much larger Daniel Alcott.
Harry did his best to follow that advice, but he was somehow sure something terrible would happen if he unclenched his jaw. Draco moved away to stand beside him, a step behind, leaning with his back against the benches, and casually draping his hand onto Harry’s shoulder.
“You hate your job, too,” said Draco.
had a choice. Lucius Malfoy had been disgraced after the fiasco in the Department of Mysteries, and Harry knew that the task of killing Dumbledore had been given as penance, as no one had believed Malfoy was truly capable of it.
“Draco,” Harry said, hesitantly, and finally, Draco looked up at him.
“Thanks, Hermione.”
Draco almost couldn’t believe the way Potter nearly collapsed into his arms, his grip tightening and his hand finding a place on the back of Draco’s neck.
“Not for
“But it isn’t!” Potter insisted. He then said, conspiratorially, “I almost was a Slytherin, you know.”
“When did you get so wise, Potter?”
“If you’re desperate to know, Potter, I’m apprenticing in Transfiguration and there’s no one more skilled in the field than Minerva McGonagall. Next time you feel the urge to poke your nose into other people’s business, however, kindly do so on your own time and leave me out of it.”
Harry grimaced slightly, because Rhiannon knew the answer to that. Still, she had said it was important to keep asking, because he had to acknowledge his own motivations before he could begin to try and change them.
Harry chuckled. Simone Wexler was rather intimidating—beyond just her formidable skills on the pitch, she had wild and curly auburn hair and dark eyes that could make anyone squirm under their gaze.
get used to such a thing. Potter was always thrilling, his kisses always burning, his touch hot and addictive. When Draco got his hand into Potter’s trousers, he reluctantly pulled out of the kiss. It was worth it to see Potter’s face, to see how his pupils dilated as Draco gripped him, how his mouth fell open as Draco twisted his wrist and tugged. Nothing compared to having Potter look at him like that, knowing that he was the one making Potter feel good like that.
“The creek is just outside of the Manor’s grounds, it runs through the forest a few miles away. Father never let me play there because he said I would get all muddy, which was ‘unbecoming’ for a proper young man. But I’d
A girl was sitting on the floor, just barely tucked into an alcove in the wall, her knees pulled towards her chest and her face buried against them as she cried softly.
Robards has us on it right away, you know that, Harry.”
It didn’t matter how many times Potter ended up in his bed, Draco couldn’t get used to it. He couldn’t imagine how one
Harry, not the way McGonagall did. And though Harry respected McGonagall more than anyone else—probably even more than he had Dumbledore—there was a big part of him that was afraid of disappointing her.
“I’m glad to hear it,” the wandmaker said. “I was hoping you would accompany me at the store come July, as that is when I find myself busiest, in preparation for the new Hogwarts students who will be needing their first wands.”
“Each major magical school has a variation of this; in Hogwarts, it’s called the Book of Admittance, written by the Quill of Acceptance. It records every time a witch or wizard in Britain or Ireland first exhibits sufficient signs of magic, which is usually before the child turns three, though in rare occasions it can take longer than that. That’s how they know who to send Hogwarts letters to. And typically the Headmaster or someone in his place will go to explain the situation to Muggleborns’ families, but if they know their names from such a young age, there’s no reason why we can’t introduce it to them far earlier.”
Harry raised his hand in the air, and watched as more hands steadily began to rise. Only a few people kept their heads down—Ernie, the Ravenclaw girl Lisa, the Patil twins, a Hufflepuff girl, Seamus, and…Ron.
The Gryffindor girl didn’t seem to mind though; she just grinned widely, showing off teeth so dazzlingly white they would put Gilderoy Lockhart to shame.
Draco leaned back with a sigh, allowing his speeding heart to slow down and catching his breath. The whole encounter couldn’t have taken more than a minute, and yet Draco felt as if he’d run a mile. Potter was quickly regaining colour in his face and as soon as he sat up, Draco fixed him with a glare.
Potter had been there that night, Draco had found that out this year during one of their sessions. He had felt a familiar anger surge through him at the thought. Of course Potter had been there. He was
Harry paused for a minute, absorbing this. He wasn’t sure what Ginny meant about the feelings she had, the ones she said she thought everyone had. What kind of feelings were they? He didn’t exactly have much of a frame of reference when it came to romance. The brief, disastrous relationship he had with Cho didn’t include a lot of romance, and when he thought of his relationship with Ginny, the feelings he remembered most were jealousy, and desperation, and fear, and sometimes, a sweet relief, when he held her in his arms and felt warm and content and safe.
When he had been forced to do it, he’d tried to pretend he was fine with it. He would talk himself down, telling himself he was being a self-righteous Gryffindor and to just get it over with.
“Pardon me, as a former Death Eater, then,” Pansy still had that look on her face, that wicked twinkle in her eyes. She always knew how to get what she wanted.
“Lean back a bit,” said Draco, gently pushing at Harry’s shoulder with two fingers. It was barely any pressure, but Harry felt himself following the direction and leaning back against the upper row of benches.
“Er, Malfoy,” said Potter. “This is a broom closet.”
“It should all work out perfectly, in fact. Mr Smith and Mr Lynch, you two can be partners,”—Harry saw Zacharias Smith and another seventh year Hufflepuff boy sitting in the front look rather satisfied—“Miss Wilkins and Miss Bellmore, the two of you can work together,”—Nadine Bellmore, a Gryffindor girl Harry only knew of as being one of Romilda Vane’s friends, looked far less happy with this arrangement, looking with disdain over at Ella Wilkins, a Slytherin girl very small in stature—"Mr Zabini and Mr Nott, you’ll partner with one another,”—Harry looked at the back, where Zabini, Nott, and Malfoy all sat at one table. Zabini and Nott looked at Malfoy with apologetic expressions, but Malfoy barely even shrugged.
“What are you brewing?” Draco asked, curiously trying to catch a glimpse of the contents of the cauldron.
He had the poor bloke’s blood and viscera and intestines all over his robes. I’d take garlic breath any day.”
“Harry?” Hermione was looking at him, expression becoming worried again.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows.
“Experimenting with cores is a vital part of your education in wandmaking. Were you thinking of any in particular?” Ollivander turned his wide, silvery gaze to Draco.
“As if you’d ever let me forget,” he responded, feeling himself slip slightly into the old rhythm of their conversations, the awkwardness melting away.
Another caw escaped Harry as the owl hooted and released him. As the talons relaxed their grip, Harry felt a fresh wave of pain hit him. How strange it felt to have pain that his brain couldn’t adequately understand.
“Well, not that she’d show it,” acquiesced Blaise. “But she said something about having offended you somehow.”
Several hands shot into the air. Her eyebrows raised, McGonagall called on Ernie Macmillan.
“The Sacred Twenty-Eight is dying out,” Draco said. “Avery, Carrow, Lestrange, Rowle, and Travers are all in Azkaban. Ollivander has no descendants. Burke is ancient and Slughorn is…well, I don’t even want to think about that. Hardly anyone’s left.”
Draco had sufficiently partied himself into exhaustion. Every morning, he continued to wake up feeling unrested, but it seemed like his body was conscious of time passing, even if the rest of the world around him wasn’t. The morning after his encounter with Will, he had stayed in bed and, loathe as he was to admit it, had cried. It hadn’t been particularly meaningful or romantic, but he hadn’t realised how long it had been since someone had looked at him with desire in their eyes, had touched him with kindness, with affection.
Sometimes he thought about running circles around Finchley—Merlin knew he wasn’t the smartest fellow, and showing him up would be extremely satisfying—but he knew he never could. He was lucky to have the job he did, and he couldn’t do anything to risk it.
“It was okay, I suppose. Not as good as mine. The spells weren’t as powerful.”
But I didn’t hunt down and kill Voldemort because it was the right thing to do. I did it because I had no other choice.”
Ashworth barked out a laugh.
Suddenly everyone was laughing—genuine and absolutely strange laughter. Even Draco couldn’t help but fall into it as Blaise chuckled by his side.
“Hang on, Malfoy,” said Harry, his voice sounding slightly rough from lack of use. Malfoy stopped, but didn’t turn around.
A screech owl landed heavily in front of Theo, dropping a rather large package by his plate. Theo looked quite amused and gave the owl a bit of toast before sending it off.
“Ah-ah!” Draco raised a finger. “She didn’t go to Hogwarts, so it doesn’t count. She very well
“I went to a Quidditch match with Malfoy yesterday,” he said, a hint of surprise in his voice. Saying it out loud really made him realize how utterly surreal it was.
this Malfoy, sweet and talkative and…
Potter mimed locking his lips and throwing away the key. Only then did Draco continue.
” he murmured, seemingly more to himself than to Draco, before his voice returned to its normal volume. “There was one I never quite understood, though. All of the others she quoted, they spoke about love as an act of togetherness. Lovers were in love, always together, always two. And so, it didn’t make sense to me, that one. ‘
“Well, wake yourself up, because Slughorn is coming this way,” Malfoy said, his eyes back on the potion they were making. Or rather, that he was making.
“I guess I’ll go,” Seamus said, standing. “If Ron can go through a war and a madman trying to kill everyone and still fear spiders the most, I think I’ll be fine.”
“Oi, Malfoy!”
“I’m not sure,” Harry shrugged. “Hermione’s schedule changes like the weather, so she can’t plan ahead as much as she’d like to.”
And so Draco had hated him. Emphatically. Insistently. Almost obsessively.
The room erupted, with Molly practically shrieking with excitement and rushing over to envelop her son in an embrace, Ginny and Hermione hurrying forward to grasp Fleur’s hands, George and Ron shouting out loud, Charlie clapping his hand on Percy’s shoulder so hard that he actually stumbled forward. Harry felt frozen for a moment, as though unsure what to do with himself, before almost automatically rising from his seat and heading forward to shake Bill’s hand.
“I’m sorry, it just—”
“Have a seat, Malfoy,” she said, gesturing to an unoccupied armchair.
Time was a mysterious business, and he had no interest in playing with it. In his darkest moments, perhaps, he had wished for a Time-Turner, a way to go back and change some of his decisions. During his time at Azkaban, he dreamt of it, of being able to relive his sixth year, his fifth, his third, his first. Of being able to make a better impression on the Hogwarts Express, of realising his father was not perfect or infallible just a little bit earlier.
Violet’s face morphed into something almost sad.
‘Mione?”
Harry knew that the “something” Malfoy alluded to meant the Dark Magic that now inhabited the Forest. Looking around him at the sun shining down on the grass and flowers, Harry wasn’t sure if this was something Dark Magic could do.
“You didn’t have to,” she replied. “You’re forgetting that I know you.”
“I was just eating breakfast, and then I started having these…these
“It is shameful behaviour,” said McGonagall, her stern voice carrying through the silence of the Great Hall. “And I expected better of you all.”
Sophie had officially become a Mediwitch this year, and her life was as hectic and as ever. She was still studying to be a Healer, and now had to balance her studies along with her work, which was an incredible challenge. Harry often wondered if he and Ron even got to spend any time together other than just sharing a bed, since they were both so busy all the time. Sophie had taken to carrying her books around with her everywhere, taking every free minute she could to study.
“I’m teasing. Well, sort of,” he gave a sort of long-suffering sigh and leaned back on his elbows. “Honestly, it was mostly because Hagrid had sort of told me it was the bad House. And that Voldemort had been in it. He said,
Chapter 11
The blonde eyed him for a moment before he said "good night" and turned back to his book.
Malfoy removed the covers off of Harry and stared down at him for what Harry could tell was an hour or so. Harry had covered himself with the smallest piece of his robes, which he assumed was the hand, and looked up at Malfoy's huge head hovering over him.
Harry walked to bed and put the box Hermione gave him in the drawer along with her letter from earlier. He got in bed and covered himself with the blanket, falling asleep almost immediately, Hermione's words playing in the back of his head.
Harry walked the distance between the foot of the bed, where he was situated, and Malfoy's head, and it took him a while.
"Apparation starts at a quarter to one…so I have some time off now" Malfoy said and Harry uttered without thinking "I thought you would spend your free time with your friends or something"
Malfoy drew nearer to Harry, his eyebrow arched, a smirk plastered on his face, his eyes raking over him. Harry blinked, repeatedly, growing more nervous by the second.
What on earth was Potter blabbing about?
"No" he simply said.
He didn't realize he had fallen asleep on the Slytherin's shoulder until Malfoy woke him up the next morning groggily mumbling "cozying up to me, huh Potter?"
Changes: Draco's POV
"No, Potter, this isn't a test!" Malfoy retorted "if mother asks you questions, you're supposed to know me…I'm supposed to know you" Malfoy pointed at him.
"Potter..." Snape said with a compassionate tone Harry had never heard from him before "you will not have to suffer for long, I think this will be over in two weeks" he added with a little smile before he raised his eyes to Malfoy, who had been standing behind the desk on which Harry was placed. Malfoy seemed to understand something unspoken between them since he grabbed Harry gently, leaving the office and heading back to their room.
“This was nice,” Potter said, a bit awkwardly. “We won’t…mention this to anyone, right?”
“You’re welcome to come and have Christmas dinner with us,” she said. “Laurel will be back for the holidays as well.”
The students did as they were told, rising from their seats and walking over to the Ravenclaw table. Harry, once seated, was glad to see some familiar faces. Susan Bones, whose long red hair had been cut and now stopped just short of her shoulders, gave him a warm smile when they made eye contact. Padma Patil had scurried over to sit beside her sister. But on the other side of Parvati, Lavender Brown was noticeably missing.
It was all his mother’s fault, really.
“Is this new?” he asked, gesturing to their intertwined hands.
BECAUSE IT'S DONE!! Here is the final chapter to The Wand That Chose Two Wizards! AGH. It's taken me a year and a half to write this story and I'm so, so, so happy that people are reading it and that people like it and ugh, it's 2:48 am and I'm getting emotional. Anyway, enough about that.
Harry stared at him.
“You’re a little too big to be snake prey, Malfoy, relax. It’s mostly rats and rabbits she wants anyway. I’m going to ask her if she’d be willing to come to the Ministry with us. I’m sure the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures will be willing to supply her all the rabbits she wants if she lets them study her.”
“What the—? Where are we?” Potter exclaimed into the sudden darkness around them.
“Race you to the shower,” said Harry, and the two began to run up the stairs.
Harry nodded.
Harry tossed the Prophet onto Draco’s desk and went back to join him in bed.
“It was no trouble,” Draco said, with a wave of his hand. “I work nearby.”
Harry sat on the sofa with both of his hands wrapped around a mug of tea, observing the room with a slight sense of detachment, as though it were all background noise occurring around him. He only realised he had somewhat checked out when Ginny threw herself onto the sofa next to him, causing him to jolt slightly, and hold on to his tea so it wouldn’t spill.
“No argument here,” Ron said, with an easy grin. “But what exactly are you talking about right now?”
Blaise and Theo looked at him for a second—and then both fell into their own smiles.
“Yeah, I suppose,” shrugged Harry.
“Is this…” he sounded hesitant. “Is this about…about what I told you at the Quidditch game?”
“What were you told of this wand?” he finally asked.
Which made it all the more important that he
It was only when Potter’s arm came to wrap around his waist that any semblance of thought returned to his brain.
“Don’t worry, Ginny,” she said, warmly. “I’m sure you’ll still make time for each other.”
“Sorry,” he said, suddenly looking abashed. “That makes sense. I just don’t get why people do this kind of stuff.”
“If it’s my
have expected it. How was he supposed to make this funny? There was nothing funny about this! He didn’t even know what it meant! How was he his own worst fear? Was he afraid of getting older? Afraid of getting married? Afraid of being an Auror, of getting injured on the job? Afraid of the future?
“Yes, one would think so,” Ollivander’s pale, silvery eyes were looking somewhere faraway. “But when he won that wand from you, he also gained ownership of the Elder Wand, which had also previously held allegiance to you, though you were, of course, unaware of that fact. However, Mr Potter chose to put the Elder Wand in hiding, using it to repair his old wand instead. That would lead us to believe that Mr Potter holds the allegiances of three wands—his holly wand, the Elder wand, and the hawthorn wand.”
“But how do you know which kids are magical if their parents are Muggles?” Potter asked.
When they arrived in the classroom, Waya Boxturtle was standing at the front, leaning against his deck and waiting for the room to fill up. Seamus, Dean, and Neville were already seated and Ron automatically steered to sit near them. Harry followed, but he couldn’t help from thinking about the events of the night before.
Harry’s mind supplied for him, but he didn’t say the words.
“Redwood, sir. Redwood and kneazle hair, fifteen inches. He said it was lucky,” Draco recited, finding himself once again mentally cursing the wandmaker that had sold it to him. To his surprise, Ollivander let out a bark-like laugh. Draco stared at him.
“Look, you can just say it, Harry. I know you don’t want to be together.”
“What did you just say?” he asked, his voice suddenly quiet.
At two minutes after noon, once Finchley had vanished from the office, Draco made his way to the canteen. He wrinkled his nose as he looked at the menu; it appeared they were recycling yesterday’s shepherd’s pie and tomato soup. Nevertheless, he took both onto his tray and sat at his usual table, awaiting the appearance of the Aurors.
“I found this book,” he said, withdrawing it from his bag and placing it on the table. “And I can’t understand it. It’s exasperating.”
“Er, I mean, yes, I was, but—” Harry stumbled over his words, and Hawk cut in.
“Do you mean Clarence?” Potter continued. Claudia nodded frantically.
Harry looked desperately towards Hermione, who grimaced slightly and spoke gently and cautiously.
“Does it matter? You were friends, or maybe even…something,” she trailed off rather faintly at the fiery look Harry shot her. She gave a slight sigh and set her fork down to give him a serious look.
“She was a bully,” Draco said. “Like me. We were both cruel and petty and vindictive and while I made a habit of only picking on Gryffindors, Pansy didn’t have the same House loyalty, shall we say.”
The important people were all up at the front. On the dais, of course, was the Minister. Next to him, the Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, Percy Weasley, sitting so upright that Draco felt his own back aching. Beside Weasley sat Granger, who—at twenty-three—was already in charge of the newly formed Muggle Relations Committee. To the left of Granger was an empty chair, previously occupied by Potter.
There was that one moment, when Potter slid inside of him and the shock of it made Draco’s breath catch in his throat. Potter was looking down at him, his green eyes dark and intense, and Draco had never felt so
He didn’t like cursing people without wands. He was taught proper duelling techniques growing up, taught its importance in ancient pureblood tradition. Attacking someone who didn’t have a wand to defend themselves didn’t feel

Finally, Malfoy came to a stop, and Harry abruptly did the same, scared of accidentally running into him. They were surrounded by thick-trunked trees, tall and foreboding, blocking out nearly all light from the sky.
of risks involved, especially for you, Harry, if you’re insisting on doing this outside of the law.”
“Nightmares, right?” Malfoy finally said, in a quiet tone, and now it was Harry’s turn to be surprised.
he complained. “Don’t you want me to know?”
“When did you…how…?”

“What?” asked Blaise. “To whom?”
“Laurence Pickering, sir,” piped up the boy, who had shaggy brown hair that reminded Harry somewhat of his own in that it seemed to be falling all over the place. “Sorry, sir, but what is Uagadou?”
“I did it,” Draco said, still somewhat in shock, turning to look at Potter, who nodded slowly, still looking at the spot where Draco’s Patronus had been.
“Where have you taught before?” she asked. Harry thought it sounded almost like an interrogation, but Ashworth seemed quite relaxed.
Draco’s heart thrummed against his chest.
They rarely crossed paths, but that was largely due to the fact that Draco went out of his way to avoid doing so. They worked on the same floor, after all, and the W.A.S. often had to request witness statements, reports, or confirmation of court appearance from the Aurors.

But this year, Draco had found people. He had found violet, who he trusted more than anyone else. She was highly unusual, with almost everything she believed in going against what Draco had been taught as a child, but she was passionate and determined, and a fiercely good friend to Draco, even though he often felt he didn’t deserve it. And there was Luna—eccentric, odd Luna—who was ready to march off into the Forbidden Forest with a man who had assisted in holding her hostage. Luna, who took him to see the baby Thestrals and inked beautiful flowers around his horrendous Dark Mark, and who always seemed to just
Slughorn actually looked at him now, his eyebrows raised.

Harry sighed in relief. The last thing he wanted was to be the reason people began attacking his friends again.
Harry snorted.
“Combination of pixie cotton, bamboo fibre, and brittlebrush silk,” Demelza said, before Harry could ask. “Absorbent, breathable, waterproof, long-lasting.

“That is correct.”
to help, even offering to stir, but Malfoy had slapped his hand away dismissively.
He was being polite, but giving the absolute bare minimum, and Harry could practically feel how he was just waiting for the conversation to finish.
Rhiannon gave him a warm smile.
Time magic is incredibly delicate! There’s a reason it's handled by the Department of Mysteries.”
“I want to,” Ella insisted, wringing her hands in her lap. “This year was really hard and I know it would’ve been impossible to get through if you hadn’t helped me as much as you did.”
At this, Harry looked at her.
“What? Nothing!” Potter replied, already looking defensive.
Granger quickly refocused, laughing lightly.
the Elder Wand and the hawthorn wand, however, I must say that I am not certain.”
“Malfoy, what are you doing?” asked Harry, slightly alarmed now.
She had declared it her personal mission to cleanse and purge Malfoy Manor, and she had become unstoppable. Even the remaining house elves—only two, Polkey and Cobby—hadn’t been able to slow her down, and Merlin knows they’d tried, working through the night sometimes, but she had been determined to do much of the dirty work herself. Eventually, Draco had quietly told them not to punish themselves when they saw her hard at work, that she wanted to be doing it. He had had no idea
“He was the striker to the blacksmith; you know the one, by the fountain on Carkitt Market,” at Pansy’s nod, Draco continued, “and I used to always see him on my way to work.”
“May I inquire why you wish to pursue Potions?”
What was
He entered Hogwarts this year focused. Now was not a time for lounging about and enjoying himself, it was for hard work and study and for keeping his head down and being as non-threatening and non-combative as possible. He knew people would be looking for excuses to get him in trouble and he was determined not to give them any.
“Why aren’t you doing a Potions apprenticeship?” Harry continued.
“He’s decent,” Draco allowed. “I think he’d make a better Chaser. He’s got the body for it.”
“What about you?” he asked. “How’s your apprenticeship going?”
Potter looked at him like he was crazy.
“I tried to remove it, you know,” he heard himself saying, almost involuntarily.
smile it is, too.”
“Where’s Clarence?” Potter asked, shortly. “Was he here?”
Draco raised his glass to his lips again, hoping the blue wine would numb his tongue. Maybe he could use that as an excuse for not replying.
Certainly not when he was growing up—the Dursleys barely ever acknowledged it and if they did, their gifts were often more insulting than receiving none at all—and though the Weasleys were kind enough to make him a lovely cake and attempt a party for his seventeenth, it had been slightly marred, of course, by the war and the heavy responsibility weighing on Harry’s shoulders.
“You’re different, you know,” he said, softly, after Potter had finished laughing, “when you speak Parseltongue.”
And, well, yes, Draco had done that, admittedly. But Potter had been just as prickly back, refusing to share his thoughts on cases with Draco, and purposefully leaving their shared office a mess in order to irritate him, and leaving him all of the paperwork.
“Also from our friends across the pond, Professor Waya Boxturtle joins us as Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.”
He knew it wouldn’t have been a typical Christmas like the ones he’d had as a child, what without Lucius at the head of the table and only two elves left to prepare the meal, but nonetheless, Draco felt down at the prospect of missing it. He had never spent Christmas at Hogwarts—in fact, he had mercilessly mocked the students that did, loudly proclaiming that they had had no one who wanted them back home.
The door swung open and Draco entered, trying not to be overwhelmed by the many different patterns assaulting his eyes all at once. Slughorn had sofas and carpets and lamps everywhere, all of varying styles and materials, and all aggressively vibrant in colour.
—who will never get to do that again.”
could make him forget the moment Potter leaned over him on the sofa and sloppily pressed their lips together.
“You’re welcome, Ella,” said Violet.
“Excellent work, as always,” Slughorn said, approvingly as he passed by their table. “And you used a gold cauldron! Ah, Harry, my boy, you remind me of your mother. Take ten points for Gryffindor.”
Draco looked back in front of him, at the small parcel and letter that sat by his plate. He reached for the envelope, wanting to read his mother’s letter first.
“I’ve never heard of it happening before! I have to ask Ollivander,” he trailed off, his eyes still wide and sparkling.
There were other things about Potter that were like that—a very clear and often loud part of his personality. His fierce and unwavering loyalty to his friends was one of them. He would never speak ill of them behind their backs, even in a joking manner, and he would stand up for them in front of anyone, even his supervisors. At first, Draco had thought this somewhat foolish, and haughtily thought that Potter thought he could talk back to whoever he liked since he was the Chosen One and all that rot, but over time he realised that Potter lacked the sense of superiority that Draco had always accused him of having. Pansy said he was projecting and when he turned up his nose at her, she just cackled and insisted he’d just proven her point.
The man seemed to be in the middle of reading the article, and Harry waited with bated breath, hoping beyond hope that the time wouldn’t run out before he found out whether the man realised it was him.
Harry liked to keep busy. He liked to be productive, he liked to know he was helping, he was contributing, he was
Hermione went somewhat quiet.
He knew Draco must be busy, so he didn’t want to
Draco rolled his eyes and cast the paper aside.
“Come now, Draco, are you really going to hex your dear old friend?”
Still, Draco couldn’t help but feel the keen sting of being such an embarrassing secret that Potter couldn’t even trust it with his closest friends, friends he told everything to. It was a difficult position to be in, knowing that what he had with Potter was already far more than he deserved, and still constantly, desperately wanting more.
Malfoy looked at him, and Harry was pleased to see he looked more confused than angry.
of Apparition.
He paused, wondering how to best explain his though process.
“Ginny!” Ron looked rather surprised. “What are you doing here?”
Harry stared at her, feeling incredibly stupid. How had he not thought of that? He hadn’t even considered what would happen to the Manor after the war. It had been Voldemort’s headquarters, of
Ron Weasley, Potter’s partner in the Aurors, sat in the front, along with his sister and several others from Hogwarts—Longbottom, Lovegood, Finnigan, Thomas.

who had died. But as quickly as that relief had come, it had been forced away, shoved back into the corners of Draco’s mind, because there were far more important things to focus on now. The Dark Lord had returned and was none too pleased with Lucius and the other Death Eaters that had supposedly abandoned him. Once school had resumed, Potter was treated as a pariah, and Draco had felt a vindictive pleasure in having power over him for the first time. It was almost as if the realisation of the attraction he had towards Potter had made him more hateful towards him, more cruel.
Chapter Nine: The Library
“Yes! I would love that!” She stood up and brushed off her dress. She had just chosen a simple and flowy navy number and flats for the evening, and was now wishing she had chosen something a little more... fun.
“He is NOT my boyfriend! And I have no problem competing against him! I just have a problem with losing!”
She reached over and intertwined their fingers, grabbing her bag in her left hand. Ron grinned at her and grabbed his.
Iris found her book first, and plopped down on the couch next to Pansy, and rested her head on her lap as if it was a pillow. Pansy read the title and raised a taunting eyebrow, and Iris scowled up at her defensively. “What!? This author is actually really good! Romance is quite good literature sometimes!” Pansy smirked down at her as if to say ‘sure,’ and Iris rolled her eyes and opened the book to the first page.

They all had so much fun that lunch seemed to fly by; the bell ringing much too soon. They said their goodbyes and rushed off to their classes, surprised and delighted that they all got along so well.
Thanks again to @TallGourami15 for beta-ing for me! They are the best and you should go check them out!
Draco and Harry are confronted by their friends.
“Well I’m not! It’s been driving me crazy!”
Harry grimaced. “It’s alright. We had agreed that it would be most believable, and I know you don’t really mean it, it’s just those wounds are still a little fresh, you know?”
༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄
Harry was confused for a moment, but then understood. “Are you sure?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“We weren’t—“ Harry said, but looked down embarrassed nonetheless.

There was a distinct smell of green apples, but underneath that was vanilla, fresh laundry, and... a (cucumber?) bath product of some kind, broomsticks, something slightly musky, and something sweet, maybe treacle.

“What’s got your knickers in a twist?” Penny asked good-naturedly.
“You good Harry?” Ron asked, as Harry was usually practically skipping to get the delicious breakfast that the house elves prepared, but this morning he was acting like he would rather not go at all, which he did not.
It was so full of feeling, and sent pleasant electricity all down Harry’s spine. It was so much more than what he felt when he kissed Ginny, and much more than whatever he had with Cho. It felt so different, so, 𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑑. So right, like where he was supposed to be.
“Why didn’t you say anything?”
Draco rubbed his lips together in a small circle. The movement seemed familiar to Harry, almost as if he had watched this occur a million times—
Classes that day went by much too fast for Harry’s liking. Before he knew it, he was in the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione, too nervous to eat more than a few mouthfuls of dinner.
“Excellent!”
Iris tried to focus back on her book as well, but she was simply too anxious for Pansy’s response to register the plot at all, the words blurring on the page.
Ron continued to chuckle as he dipped his quill in his ink and wrote his name sloppily on the paper. Harry found his potions book, slid it out of his bag, and began to read the page on the effects of different obscure ingredients.
“What’s wrong?”
They grinned at each other for a long while before Draco tapped her shoulder.
"Oh. Yeah, I guess." Harry said, and shrugged.
He was walking with Ron and Hermione to a place in the shade, near enough to the Black Lake that they could feel the refreshing spray of the cool water. They were all so eager to get into the sunshine that they just grabbed a few pieces of fruit to share while watching the rippling water.
She looked at Iris, brows furrowed, to find the same expression across her face. They started walking towards it, both of them quite curious. 𝑊ℎ𝑜 𝑤𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑑 𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑙 𝑏𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝐻𝑜𝑔𝑠𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑒? 𝑊𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑦 ℎ𝑢𝑟𝑡?
She wrinkled her nose in disgust as she got to the bottom of the trunk, broken quills and spilled ink and shards of who-knows-what and unnameable slimy things.
Hermione laughed. “Yeah, I guess!”
Harry stood up and grabbed Ron’s arm, yanking him off the couch. Ron scowled and shook his arm off, but walked a few steps toward Hermione and intertwined their fingers. “Let’s get on with it then.” He said begrudgingly.
He didn’t know quite what it was, but as he watched Harry bite into the crisp apple, everything seemed to go in slow motion.
“They were betting on us!?” Harry chuckled.
They were training for the first match of the season, and unluckily this time it was with Slytherin.
“Me too.” Was all Pansy could get out. She turned to look at Iris, and up into her big beautiful eyes. Iris was normally a few inches shorter than Pansy, but her heels made her a bit taller than Pansy now. It made Pansy feel slightly uncomfortable and small.
Harry’s eyes swept the class, looking around for Draco reluctantly, but was startled by a drawl behind him.
“Why is it more now than usual?” She gasped. “Harry! No! Really?”
Draco and Harry sat down and adjusted until they were most comfortable, leaning against each other and gazing out at the beautiful colors.
Over the next few weeks, the six of them became quite good friends. Hermione and Iris had bonded quite quickly, sharing book recommendations, studying techniques, and other things that Harry found quite boring.
Harry started to scramble away from Draco at the sight of them. “Agh! It’s Josh and Chris and... I don’t know her name!” Draco said, annoyed; probably by Harry’s moving away from him.
Slughorn clapped and said, “Now document the appearance of your potions, and everything you smell!”
Then Hermione and Pansy got it, and a while later a Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw pair.
“Who is it?” Asked Ron. “Is she pretty?” He winked.
He sighed, resigned, and gave her a slow nod.
He soared up and up, the fast wind making his eyes and pushing his glasses to his face.
He rolled his eyes at her but silently thought that that might actually be nice.
Pansy looked very uncomfortable. “He’s just not really my type!” She whisper-yelled.
He was so nervous, it would be so awkward, there would probably be fighting, he had no idea how he was supposed to talk casually to Draco, of all people, it would be a mess. He was dreading it, but also strangely excited.
“Demelza with the quaffle, but oh no! The keeper blocks it!”
༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄
Harry groaned again and gave them a jokingly disgusted look. But secretly, he wanted nothing more than that to be him.
“Who?”
It was the trio, but Granger and Weasley seemed to fade into the background as his eyes landed on Harry.
On the second sheet, she wrote an invitation to Hermione. She tied both letters to Hermes, feeling slightly bad about the extra weight, but he flew up a few inches without any difficulty. She told him the instructions and watched him fly back out of the window.
Again.
Pansy shrieked. “Aaahhh!!! Draco! He smelled YOU! He likes you back!!!”
He hurried off to Defense Against the Dark Arts, still a necessary course, though Draco couldn’t see why those who had fought in the battle, especially Harry, needed it.
Harry was surprised to hear Neville's voice from two beds over. "I have a tie that would go nicely with that."
She sniggered and said, “I did see you making eyes at each other the whole match.” She winked. “What exactly did Potter say to make you stop racing for the snitch? It had to have been quite something, cost us the whole match!”

༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄
"Perfect! Well I'll see you three tomorrow at eight."
“You need your strength!” Pansy said. “For your 𝑏𝑖𝑔 𝑔𝑎𝑚𝑒 against your 𝑏𝑜𝑦-𝑦-𝑓𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑑!“ She poked him in the side playfully, and reached out to pinch his check, when he smacked her hand away, hard.
Hermione smirked affectionately at him and said, “I’ll look over it when you’re done.”
Draco bent down and sniffed the potion, and was overwhelmed by the AMAZING aroma. It was so good smelling! He tried to decipher the individual scents.
Draco dropped his voice down to a whisper. “The hot one! Josh!”
Harry was grateful when the bell rang and it was time for dinner, he was starved. He, Ron, and Hermione made their way to the Great Hall.
“Umm...yes?”
"Pansy! I don't think that's such a good idea-" But she couldn't hear him. He groaned and walked back down the stairs, sinking into a poofy dark green couch. He would rather not watch.
Hermione narrowed her eyes like she was about to object, but seemed to rethink that and looked back down at her book.
"OH MY GOD HARRY!" Hermione shouted. "You didn't! That's amazing!"
“The Chosen One and the Malfoy Heir, gay and together? I wonder what the whole school will say about that...” The leader of the group sneered at them.
Draco was getting closer and closer, because Potter was walking so slow and Draco was taller. (And very gay)
Harry even got Draco to smirk and look at the ground once, and he would not let him hear the end of it.
Hermione smacked his arm. "What were you thinking?"
The sunlight felt so good, warming him from the outside in, making him feel like his worries were behind him. He was often shunned because of the mark on his forearm, and his family’s allegiance to the defeated Dark Lord.
“WHAT! No!” Ron said, incredulous. Then his face turned quizzical. “But now that I think about it... how long have you liked him Harry?”
Tonight she was wearing a white floral blouse tucked into a denim miniskirt. Her hair was curled loosely, shining slightly in the light. The blouse was feminine and loose, but somehow still clung to every curve. The skirt was torturously short, showing off her long legs.
The bell rang and while gathering their things and standing up, the boys brushed arms.
He got distracted in their depths for just a second, but snapped out of it and managed to get out, “Oh. Sorry. I’ll get those now.”
They fell into comfortable conversation, tongues becoming looser with every sip of Firewhiskey and gulp of Butterbeer.
They broke apart, and looked at each other like they couldn’t look away. Looking into the other’s eyes, it seemed like the moment would last forever.
It all turned to buzzing as he put his head in his hands, sighing.
“Can you hand me three and a half rose petals?” He asked, glad he refrained from using ‘please’.
Hermione grabbed a small handbag and Harry gave her a few galleons to put in it for his drink. Ron just looked at her and grinned hopefully. She rolled her eyes at him irritatedly, but nodded. He grinned wider.
DADA- with Potter
Pansy heard whispers from inside. Eventually the portrait swung open to reveal a common room decked in appalling amounts of red and gold. She cringed almost imperceptibly, much preferring the more sophisticated and elegant green and silver decorations of the Slytherins.
Pansy chuckled and nodded. “Then I would like a Firewhiskey too.”
Harry turned to meet Draco’s worried gaze. “What are we going to do?”
Hermione nodded and said, "Thanks!" And pulled their curtains back together.
"No..." Ron said, narrowing his eyes.
“But the day is so gorgeous!” Pansy whined.
"Well good luck, Harry." Hermione said kindly, and smiled at Ron.
She raised her eyebrow but didn’t inquire further. They finished lunch, packed up their bags, and headed off towards transfiguration.
“Snap OUT of it!” Yelled Pansy. She took a deep breath, and sat down on the bed. “Draco, please tell me what it is. I’m worried! Can we just talk it out? Please Draco?” She made sad puppy dog eyes and an exaggerated pouted lip.
𝑊ℎ𝑎𝑡! 𝑁𝑜! Harry thought. Crap. He didn’t respond. He had to show him that he liked him back! Without thinking, he ran up to Draco, swiveled him around and pulled him in by the tie.
Potter rolled his eyes.
Draco merely grumbled, picking out a case of sugared butterfly wings, some chocoballs, and tub of pink coconut ice to bring over to the counter.
certain. As he walked towards the door, however, Potter’s hand reached out and grabbed his arm, his fingers wrapping right around where, under his robes, Draco’s Dark Mark was.
“I wouldn’t mind,” said Harry, softly.
“Did you…” Potter spoke in a hushed tone. “Did you to that just to make me feel better?”
“Yes, yes, I’ve let everyone down, truly the Boy who Lived to Disappoint,” he joked, trying to ignore the unpleasant voice in his head that was telling him there was more truth to the joke than he let on.
“What about yourself?” asked the dark-haired Tabitha Hawk, watching him carefully with her light eyes.
“Yes, I have,” he answered. “Have you?”
“Er, barely,” said Potter. “We were a little busy at the time.”
“Well, hey, at least you’re on a winning streak, right?”
Draco didn’t fulfil that promise right away. Instead, he took a different piece of Pansy’s advice, and tried something new.
“An Acromantula,” it came out rather slowly, as if Ron was reluctant to even say it aloud.
Ollivander was seated in a low chair, his frail-looking hands delicately turning a wand over as he examined it. At the sound of the door opening, he looked up and a small smile crossed his face when he saw Draco.
“No!” said Draco, shaking his head madly. “I mean—you don’t remember…all the times I came to see you and you don’t—you don’t
Looking at Violet excitedly gushing across the table from him, his best friend with a passion for combining Wizarding and Muggle culture, he thought to himself:
“It’s considered to be the largest viper in the U.K., having been brought here illegally by wizards from Sri Lanka as part of a magical breeding scheme. They were breeding Muggle snakes with magic and trying to pass them off as newly discovered species. The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office and the Improper Use of Magic Office were working on it last year.”
“Are you a coffee or a tea man?”
“Er…what exactly, sir?” Harry asked, confused.
Draco felt a flush rise up in his neck, remembering the embarrassing experience of having to ask Granger about it in front of both Potter and Weasley.
Robards sighed, rubbing a palm across his forehead.
“Hey, don’t blame Aquila! Hunting is in her nature. Not her fault you got yourself stuck in your Animagus form. Are you even
going on? He still couldn’t be sure he wasn’t having some sort of complex and detailed hallucination.
“I’ve only been able to do it, well, in battle,” he said. “Out of desperation, I suppose.”
“I told her we need to access the dungeon,” Potter said, eye contact with the snake never breaking. “She said she cannot let anyone past. I asked her why. She said her master will punish her. I’m going to tell her we have everyone in custody.”
Narcissa herself had had quite enough of it once her year of house arrest was through, having been confined within its walls as she served her sentence, and she had wheedled Draco into taking a lengthy vacation with her on the Isle of Skye. Upon their return, she had settled into a nice routine and grew to enjoy the Manor again, now that it was a home instead of a prison.
“Madam Rosmerta,” he began in a low tone, having absolutely no idea where he was going with this. “I am so…I really must…” he floundered.
Neville and Justin Finch-Fletchley were both apprenticing with Professor Sprout, which came as no surprise, and Ernie Macmillan, Harry saw with a healthy amount of disappointment, was apprenticing under Remington Armistead, the associate editor of the Daily Prophet. It was when he reached McGonagall’s name that he paused.

“Oh,” he murmured, pulling his arm back and looking down at it.
“I understand,” he said, cautiously, unsure if he actually did. His fear hadn’t left him, but Potter couldn’t really be
“How was it?” Harry prodded.
“Better than what?”
“Hi,” he said, offering a small smile, and walking over to the table. They hovered awkwardly for a moment, seemingly debating whether to shake hands or not.
“How can she do that?” he asked, his voice so low he could barely hear himself. “How can she just…forgive me?”
“Er, aren’t we doing that now?”
“Hear, hear!” cried Seamus, raising his glass. “Let’s have a toast, yeah?”
“Alright, you’ve convinced me. I’m going to have Hermione check the contract before I sign it though.”
“Ah,” said Draco, feeling disappointed. “Yes, normally I send Eleanor, as I tend to be quite busy. Not to worry, Potter, she’ll be fetching them next time.”
“…didn’t I think of that?” Hermione’s voice mumbled as she and Sophie walked back to their table, and Harry smiled to himself—of course Hermione would be beating herself up about that.
“How dare they,” said Draco, unable to stop grinning now. “Do they know it’s the Saviour of the Wizarding World they’re making fun of?”
Harry sighed. She was right; he knew she was right, but there wasn’t much to be done about it anymore. Malfoy had been a lot easier to work with recently, but that wasn’t any sort of guarantee that he would be responsive to Harry’s instruction. In Potions, he had the upper hand, since he was the one who knew what he would be doing. This would be different, and Harry knew Malfoy wasn’t going to be an easy student.
Draco had
“Can one even study wandlore?” he asked, his voice hushed.
Potter stared at him. It was a few seconds until it started to feel quite strange to Draco and he was just about to ask what the prat was doing when suddenly, Potter started laughing. It was Draco’s turn to stare, as Potter threw his head back and guffawed, loudly.
Draco turned his head, his body already tense, ready to be jinxed at any moment. He found himself almost face-to-face with Seamus Finnigan, who looked apoplectic.
“Why is that?” McGonagall pressed.
Harry didn’t know what to say to this. He was tempted to go onto the offensive and demand why he did then, but Malfoy seemed to be steeling himself to say something.
A sad smile pulled at Draco’s lips as he read through Violet’s letter and he felt a rush of affection for his best friend. He was so grateful to have Violet in his life—and Daphne as well. He Summoned a glass vial from his shelf, one of the ones he usually used for ingredients, filled it with an Aguamenti, and placed the chrysanthemum in it, setting it by the top left corner of his writing table. Daphne had been right, he knew what it meant. White was typical for a sympathy flower, and chrysanthemums symbolised longevity and optimism, which Draco knew Ollivander would have appreciated.
“Malfoy,” Granger replied, sounding like she was ready to ask him a thousand questions.
“She seemed to be upset about you, Draco,” said Blaise.
He watches the Aurors line up and get their lunch; Finnigan playfully jostling Weasley, Corner fruitlessly trying to chat up Patil.
It was partially his fault for rising to the bait, Draco thought morosely, fidgeting in the spindly chair across the headmistress’s desk, but Potter had always known how to get under his skin, and no matter how much calmer and more reserved Draco had been this year so far, he still had his breaking point.
“You’ll have to thank the Chosen Prat for that, not me.”
“I’ll go now,” Draco interrupted, rising to his feet. “Thank you, sir.”

“I’ve never heard of anyone breaking it before.”
saying something that wasn’t an insult or grandiose statement. But as Harry looked at him, he did
Professor Ashworth just raised his eyebrows.
He never would escape them, he knew it, but being reminded of it was a blow all the same.
It was down a hidden set of steep and uneven stairs—Draco taking careful steps and catching Potter every time he nearly tripped—that they finally found the entrance to the dungeons, and the worsening of the rancid smell did nothing to boost Draco’s confidence. A turn of the corner at the bottom of the stairs and even Draco couldn’t pretend that his sharp intake of breath was anything but a terrified gasp.
“I had a day off,” he said. She looked at him doubtfully.
“Honestly, this is getting ridiculous,” Hermione commented at dinner, regarding the latest rumour that Ginny had cheated on Harry during the war. Ron nodded emphatically.

“Money, which I know you don’t care about,” she said, rolling her eyes. “Basically, you’d represent them and advertise for them by wearing their clothing and using their equipment, which they will give you for free. The original contract is for a year, but depending on how happy you are with them and vice versa, they might extend it. If you end up staying with them long term, you might even have a say in your own line of gear.”
Life, and hope, and growth, and rejuvenation.
“I have to say, gentlemen, I expected better of you.”
near the potion.”
But this time, Harry didn’t find Malfoy skulking around in corridors or crying in bathrooms. In fact, the only thing that appeared unusual was that he seemed to be struggling in his classes far more than usual. He had always been one of the top students, typically only narrowly edged out from the top by Hermione. But in Transfiguration, he was one of the only ones who hadn’t been able to fully transfigure his head into that of a big cat. Instead of looking angry, like Harry would have expected, Malfoy just sighed and unclenched his jaw, muttering to himself under his breath.
“There has to be someone that can help.”
Draco nodded, feeling like his insides were being flattened.
Thinking back, he couldn’t even remember how it had started, because they didn’t seem to go through that awkward stage of starting to go out and warming up around each other. It had been as sudden as Apparition, as scorching as Fiendfyre, Harry had become tangled up in her like Devil’s Snare before he even realized what was happening. It had almost been easy, taking all that energy that he’d been putting into his work and channelling it into his relationship instead. It was easier than focusing on himself, than on trying to identify his negative thought patterns and self-destructive habits.
“Oh, yes,” said Luna. “I’ll be with Dad, and then we’re both going to the Burrow for Christmas dinner.”
And everyone else seems to be acting like it is, but for me, it isn’t. It doesn’t feel
“Exactly,” Draco felt a rush of triumph swell up inside him. It may have been small and insignificant, but he had just won an argument against Potter, and it felt
“I’ll do my best,” Harry grinned.
“Do you like it?” she asked, and for the first time ever, Draco could sense a bit of uncertainty in her voice.
“Pretty much,” said Harry. “Unless you count the Prophet photographers following me around Diagon Alley.”
—for Ladies, one would assume—embedded into it.
Hermione nodded.
Potter had gone silent, and Draco wasn’t sure if he was expecting a response, but he spoke nonetheless.
“Oh,” said Ron, and he had the decency to go a little red in the ears. “Sorry.”
“I cannot believe that you walked into the Ministry Atrium with a nine-foot long viper draped over your shoulders,” Potter said, for the umpteenth time, chuckling before taking a long gulp from his pint.
“Macmillan,” he said, as politely as he could, turning to face him. Ernie Macmillan, in comparison to Dean Thomas, was a far less tolerable employee of The Daily Prophet. He had been working there as long as Draco had been at Ollivander’s, but he was still merely an intern, and he was one of the most persistent people Draco had the displeasure of knowing.
said someone up front; Granger, it sounded like.
“Is she on call every weekend?” Harry asked, remembering how she had to leave lunch early last weekend as well.
“You’re right, Harry,” Hermione went on, giving him a warm smile. “He’s changed.”
Hermione simply sat there, hands crossed in his lap, waiting patiently for him to finish talking.
The media had exploded, of course—the Queen of Quidditch and the Chosen One, it was clearly a match made in heaven. They were plastered on every front page and the crazy part was that Harry didn’t even
He nodded, somewhat baffled.
“My Mind Healer suggested it.”
“Harry, are you asking me if it’s okay to be friends with Malfoy?” she asked. Harry stared at her. That wasn’t at all what he was thinking.
“I think that’s it,” said Dennis, pausing to flip back through the last few shots. “You just need to talk to each other, that’s the most relaxed Harry’s looked all day.”
“Oh, just sit down before you hurt yourself,” said Malfoy, scooting over on his cloak as if to make room.
“My ninth birthday.”
He hadn’t exactly found his footing, after the war. He did the rounds, attended the trials and went back to Hogwarts to help rebuild. But there was a point in time where it seemed like everyone was starting to move on, and somehow, Harry never felt like he quite got there.

“Don’t
Birthdays were a big deal.
“No, no, not like that. Drat, I’m not explaining this very well, am I? Honestly, I’m not the best person to talk to about this. I don’t exactly have the best Muggle education,” she frowned and looked off at nothing, chewing on her lip in thought.
“You’re stuck. Merlin, you’re stuck in your Animagus form and my owl nearly ate you. Swear you won’t have me arrested when you’re back as a human?”
Ella supplied a weak smile at this, the white-pink scar tissue wrinkling on her cheek, and then bid them a quick goodbye before taking off. The three of them watched her go, a sombre sort of air remaining even after she disappeared from view.
Violet wrung her hands and looked away.
There was hurt in Potter’s eyes, and Draco ignored the sharp pulling sensation in his stomach, focusing instead on the heat of the anger, the anger that was rising in him like bubbles in a boiling cauldron.
“Er…you’re welcome, Draco.”
“Noted,” said Harry. “Can you please put a shirt on now? You’re being very distracting.”
She sat, delicately laying her book down beside her and smoothing down her robes. Draco waited, but she was silent, her brow furrowed as she folded her hands in her lap and stared down at them. Draco didn’t speak, but simply sat there, waiting for Daphne to work herself up to say what she wanted to say.
“You want this, right?” he asked. “I’m not overstepping? You’re not just…I don’t know, going along because you don’t want to say no?”
“It’s a good base subject,” he said, truthfully. “I know it’s not as specialized, but it lets me keep my options open. I just couldn’t see myself as a Potioneer, no matter how much I enjoy brewing.”
“It looks like her,” Potter replied. It did, she had the same heart-shaped lips, the same delicate, curly brown hair. She seemed to be asleep in the portrait, her hands folded in her lap, and her chest moving slowly as she breathed.
“You were young,” he said, like it was that simple, and Draco couldn’t help but feel slightly incensed.
3.) I am currently writing this story, it isn't a completed fic that I'll be periodically uploading chapters to. I'll try to update as frequently as I can, but I'm going to go ahead and apologize in advance for any long stretches between chapters.
“You spoke at his trial, Harry,” she continued, in that gentle tone.
Draco clenched his spoon in his hand, his stomach starting to turn with how nervous he was.
Draco stared at him. He was sure that Potter was aware, too, as he wasn’t being subtle, but Potter’s eyes remained on the pitch.
“Yeah, mate, and it…well, ‘Mione says it was like an experiment, right? We had feelings for each other, so we gave it a go and…well, it didn’t work out the way we thought.”
“What’s it to you, Potter?” Draco shot back, with none of the old bite he used to have. Potter shrugged, like he couldn’t possibly care less.
Draco felt something inside him go cold.
“We should go flying,” he said, impulsively.
And then it didn’t matter how many doors Draco had built up in his mind, how hard he stabbed his palms with his fingernails, how hard he swallowed, how tight and tense he kept his muscles, none of it mattered, because here was Potter, looking at him with those terrible green eyes, and he folded into himself and he wept.
“Says you, Mr I-Only-Date-Quidditch-Players,” countered Ron, eyebrows raised.
Harry strolled over to the cabinet, where several other students were also gathering their ingredients. Hermione, who had her arms full and was about to walk off, stopped to give Harry a concerned look.
“You only say that because you love to argue,” Nott said, with a wide smile on his face. Harry, who had never seen Nott so much as smirk, was rather taken aback.
“Yeah. We can stand five feet apart and glare at each other occasionally if it makes you feel better.”
Ron was far more laidback, of course, but even he was rather stressed, having a host of exams to study for. Sophie had also buried herself in her studies, though perhaps not nearly as crazed as Hermione when she did.
“I was already planning on taking N.E.W.T.s in Arithmancy and Ancient Runes, but I want to have all my bases covered, so I’ve added back Care of Magical Creatures, and I
“Fisticuffs!” she exclaimed. “I am truly at a loss for words. I am quite familiar with the many differences you boys have had over the years,”
“I know you have no reason to believe me, and I don’t particularly care if you do, but I had to tell you because I cannot keep this up. The Occlumency shields are too much to maintain all day, and I simply do not have the energy for them anymore. I have to care for my mother, as you already know.”
Potter just continued to gape at him, so Draco continued.
“You’re not like that anymore,” he said, instead, in a comforting voice.
“As long as you keep catching the Snitch and participate in interviews at the same rate as your teammates, I’m happy,” she’d say.
“Alright, alright, at least we should all go out together sometime. Bring Violet and Daphne, they’re good fun.”
She had arrived at the office overwhelmingly cheerful one day a little over a year ago.
“I beg your pardon?”
“Nah, I don’t think he will,” came Ron’s voice, bringing Harry back to the present. “His mum’s on house arrest and Lucius is in Azkaban, he’s got to be there to take care of her.”
Harry Potter? It wasn’t like he could just get old members of the D.A. either, they had already learned what he had to teach them.
Draco remained silent, waiting with baited breath.
Five years since he left Hogwarts and he was definitely making steps in the right direction, but it was slow progress.
When he reached the door of the classroom at the end of the hall, he paused and closed his eyes for a moment. He thought of Luna in the dungeons, her smile after he had healed her, and the way Ollivander had looked at him, with a curious expression in his bright eyes. Draco took a deep breath and opened the door.
It was nice, getting together every two weeks or so, catching up with Dean and Seamus and Neville and occasionally other old classmates who would drop by when they got the chance.
Theo’s face was achingly sympathetic.
Violet nodded and turned her head away. Draco could swear she was hiding tears.
“Warn me about what?”
He’d been captured by an owl.
“Here you go,” Potter said, returning with the files.
There wasn’t really much opportunity for lounging, though, not while living in the same quarters as the other Houses. Draco found himself constantly on alert, scanning his surroundings at all times, making sure he always knew who was around him.
“Well, figure it out!” she said, reaching over to smack him on the arm. “Narcissa is sitting in that enormous Manor with a library nearly as big as Hogwarts’. Go do some bloody research and figure out what this is.”
Once he felt his breathing go back to normal, he reached out for the menu sitting at the centre of the table, in the form of a square shaped book. He flipped through it, barely registering their extensive collection of teas and pastries, still feeling like his heart rate was slowing down to its usual tempo.
“How did the Americans walk on the moon?” He let it all out in one quick breath, trying to get it over with as quickly as possible.
“Regulus Black,” he murmured to himself.
He hadn’t known she had died. He had never even
“Yeah,” Harry confirmed, unsure whether Draco would see this as a good or bad thing. His expression was unreadable and he remained silent, as though appraising Harry for a moment.
about Muggles?” he said it with such disbelief that Draco was unsure whether to be offended or not. Then he remembered the countless times he had called Granger a ‘Mudblood’ and decided he didn’t have the right.
“By you,” he added. “I want you to touch me.”
He supposed she had come to check on him after Ron had told her he wasn’t going to come to pub night. He opened the door, ready for Hermione to rush in and fuss.
The elf let out a pitiful cry as she exploded into tears.
“I don’t—why do you ask?”
“How much have you had to drink?” he asked.
“Already? That’s impressive.”
“Yes, sir,” he said.
“Draco, you’re old enough to know what Dark Magic does when it’s left to fester. Cleaning this house will take more than simply washing windows,” she’d said briskly, and returned to her work.
Maybe it was because Theo was a friend. Or maybe he had been spending too much time with Luna, and her blunt honesty was rubbing off on him. Or maybe—most likely—since he had lied so much in the past and it had all ended rather catastrophically, his subconscious was deciding not to let him do it anymore.
“Club is a nice word for it,” he said. “It wasn’t exactly allowed.”
behind you! On your
He had sat down with a cup of tea after his somewhat explosive resignation in an attempt to calm himself down. If anything, this dreaded time loop was showing him how pathetic his life had become. He tried not to worry about waking up the next morning jobless, but by avoiding that particular train of thought, his brain inevitably landed back on Potter’s face, on that amused expression. What was so
Only a few days into classes and already Draco was in half a mind to write a desperate letter to his mother, pleading to let him return to the Manor. He restrained himself—barely—purely because he pictured the Malfoy matriarch sweeping through the Manor in her long robes, the elves trailing after her and attempting to expel as much Dark Magic from the walls as possible, and he knew she wouldn’t spare much mercy for Draco lounging around in Hogwarts.
Come Monday, Draco was determined to speak with Potter regarding what had happened at Clarence Price’s house. It wasn’t just a matter of curiosity, Potter was his
Harry bit at his lip, wishing desperately, for the first time ever, that the man could hear
Draco didn’t fully understand everything Violet told him about her apprenticeship, but he knew she was studying under a Squib, Peter Duncan—which was a surprise in and of itself, because Draco hadn’t known Squibs could even see Hogwarts—who worked for the Wizard-Muggle Relations office in the Ministry, and that she wanted to create more opportunities for Squib integration into Wizarding society.
“Potter.”
Pansy looked somewhat disappointed, as though this story hadn’t been nearly as gossip-worthy as she had hoped. Draco felt like he was bouncing between two versions of himself, Pansy’s friend and Nathaniel’s love. Neither of them felt like him anymore.
For now, however, he had to worry about finding someone to tutor.

“I guess not,” he replied. “But it’s normal to want to know that kind of stuff about somebody you care about. Whether you’re together or not, you care about her, right?”
“Wrong dragon,” he said. “We need a Czech Snakesnout’s claws, not a Chinese Fireball’s.”
“Hermione,” Harry said, pulling on Hermione’s sleeve like a lost child. “Please reassure me that this is a good idea.”
“Just don’t see a reason to be glaring at flowers.”
That year had been one of restoration, of recovery. It had been about healing from the war, talking through all the dark and destructive feelings that seemed impossible to talk about.
“They’re the big pureblood families, right?”
“Ah, yes. I found it very interesting how those two Houses have retained the famous enmity their respective founders had for each other.”
Theo was looking at him, his dark eyes wide and questioning, and Draco looked away, his heart beating rather quickly.
“Sorry to bother yeh, Headmistress,” said Hagrid. “Only Professor Slughorn said to tell yeh there’s a problem in the dungeons.”
She shoved the last of her sandwich in her mouth, pulled herself out of the booth, and smacked her mouth down on Ron’s head before dashing off with a quick, “See you later!” thrown over her shoulder.
“I’ll have you know I am often right,” Draco said, in his usual haughty voice, now that the conversation was shifting back to some semblance of normal—although Draco doubted that speaking to Potter would ever feel normal to him. “Besides, I thought I was Draco now?”
“She says that she’ll come with us to the Ministry if you…carry her.”
“Hmm,” Hermione seemed to think this over. “Honestly, Harry, I think you might need to just go with your gut here.”
“How many survived?” Harry replied, earning him a reprimanding look from Hermione, who turned to answer Neville as if Harry hadn’t spoken.
Draco nodded, thinking about how satisfying it was to tell Finchley to shove it, though not in those exact words, of course.
“Flowers,” she repeated, a smile forming on her face as she withdrew her finger from his skin at last. “You seem like someone who appreciates flowers.”
That shut Ron up rather promptly.
he croaked and watched his future self transform into a giant novelty Harry Potter bobblehead.
Draco, is that a Muggle book?”
Perhaps that had also been part of why he had been so motivated about becoming an Animagus. Besides being something to do, it was something more to connect him to Sirius and to his father. Maybe he would understand what Sirius felt like, spending all of that time in his Animagus form.
him back…it almost made this whole time loop fiasco worth it.
“No special someone in your life?”
“Right,” Harry nodded. “That’s what you said that night, that the wand belonged to both of us.”
“No. The Ashwinder eggs need to steep in the rosewater for exactly thirty days, which is why the process usually takes that long, but Slughorn’s already done that for us.”
“How about you?” he asked. “How is France?”
“Anything you want to say to Hermione, you can say in front of us,” Weasley puffed out his chest and crossed his arms, an air of finality in his voice.
Not the sarcasm and digs about being the “Saviour,” no, that was classic Malfoy. But Harry hadn’t expected to be confronted about missing Potions. After all, like Malfoy said, Harry wasn’t exactly much help with brewing, so why would he care if Harry missed class?
“My future? Mother, I
Harry didn’t know what to make of him. On the one hand, he knew that to Malfoy, he was just an injured bird, and it would be an entirely different story if Harry in human form had tumbled through his window. But on the other hand, he had to wonder—how many sides of Malfoy were there? Harry had never known him to be capable of kindness—even to a bird. He liked it, he
“Oh, he’s a seventh year in my Herbology class. He’s really interested in underwater Herbology, and he knows a lot about it because the Slytherin common room is right under the lake.”
“Of course I do,” replied Draco, neatly cutting a tiny potato in half. “The elves at the Manor always prepare an enormous feast.”
It was all rather confusing. He could look at Oliver and see how Hermione could be attracted to him, but that was all. So that solved it, didn’t it? But then he’d be leaving the Quidditch pitch after watching a game with Ron, and see rugged Dominic Armstrong, Captain and Seeker of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team, shaking his head like a dog to rid his dark hair of sweat, and he thought,
Draco stared at her, and Daphne’s cheeks went furiously red. When it was clear Draco was unable to speak, Daphne launched into nervous speech.
Harry thought to himself. He took a deep breath, not bothering to mention that dandelions weren’t technically an herb and that he had never cooked with them before and had no idea what to do with them.
” Potter said, looking at Granger with a horrified expression.
He was then introduced to the other three recruiters of the group—Chester Vogel, a slightly hefty man with thick black eyebrows and a matching moustache who worked for the Montrose Magpies; Ruth Merriweather, a relatively young woman with long auburn hair falling down to her hips who was here for the Holyhead Harpies; a Keegan Hitchens, a fair-skinned man with broad shoulders and a friendly-looking face, who represented the Kenmare Kestrels.
The first thing he was struck by was how soft they were, in comparison to the dry, tough skin of his hands and arms. The second thing he was struck by was how
in fifth year, Draco had been careful not to get trapped alone in a room with Theo. He made sure there was always someone else there as a buffer—it used to be Crabbe and Goyle, sometimes it was Pansy or Blaise. He knew it was safer that way, that way nothing could
“Ah, if only she knew what’s yet to come,” Dean said, devilishly.
Potter, how it kills something inside of you forever and—”
Merlin knew he could use a little luck these days.
“Really,” she said, firmly. “You’re the best friend I ever had. I love you.”
“You can’t catch up on weeks of lost sleep overnight, Potter.”
Penelope narrowed her eyes at him.
Potter’s voice seemed to hitch and Draco watched as his fists clenched and unclenched.
There was a great scraping of wooden benches against the stone floor as students got to their feet and headed towards the large double doors of the Great Hall. It took several minutes for everyone to leave, and when the doors banged shut again, what looked like less than thirty people remained, scattered around the enormous room at their respective House tables. The staff had all dispersed as well, all except McGonagall and the Heads of Houses.
They had once tried to institute a ‘no work talk’ rule for when they got together, but for people who worked as many hours as they did, it was an almost impossible task.
He, of course, had not dealt with it later, and now he was faced with a host of anxious questions eating away at his mind. Was he even going to be allowed back? Did McGonagall really mean to sent the letter to him, or did it just go out to everyone from his year—everyone who’d survived the war, that is? Would she refuse him at the door and insist he return to the Manor? Would any other Slytherins be returning?
Draco sighed.
“Yeah!”
“Not really. That was mostly an old wives’ tale. It worked on the scorpions though. Moreover, it
Despite all the horrific things he had done during the war, he still felt a deep sense of shame and anger at himself for how he had behaved during his fifth year. For the spite that had driven him to align himself with someone as vile and despicable as Dolores Umbridge. But of course, it had only gotten worse from there. After his father was caught at the Ministry and imprisoned, his brain had sufficiently forced whatever feelings of desire or attraction he had for Potter into one of the drawers he kept in his mind and locked it shut. All there remained room for was fear and hatred.
“The zinnia…means a lot of things. Endurance. Remembrance. Affection. The memory or lost loved ones, absent friends,” he didn’t know how much more he could say, he felt hot all over and his insides were twisting inside of him uncomfortably. He coughed in an attempt to clear his throat and when the thought of Crabbe attacked his mind, he quickly moved on.
Dennis moved him around into various positions, but Harry still felt stiff and posed.
Draco woke to a familiar tapping sound. Sighing heavily and feeling distinctly unrested, he squeezed his eyes shut before opening them, the light of morning bright and distressing.
A look crossed over Ginny’s face, a familiar one. It was similar to the look Fred and George would get when they hatched a new plan to cause trouble.
be if you flew for them,” Draco retorted. Harry laughed again. It was much easier to find Draco’s snark funny when there was a distinct lack of malice behind it.
The Daily Prophet had had a field day when they found out that Harry and Hermione were living together, without Ron. There had been countless articles about how Harry had betrayed Ron by shacking up with his ex-girlfriend or about how Hermione had always been in love with Harry and had only dated Ron because Harry had been with Ginny and she’d wanted to make him jealous. It was all rubbish, and thankfully, Ron had taken it with good humour, mockingly admonishing Harry for dating both his sister and his ex-girlfriend and warning him off of Sophie. Eventually the articles died down, because of course, nothing ever happened between Harry and Hermione, and people slowly got bored of the same old rumours being recycled.
Luckily, Draco didn’t bristle at this, as his attention was still on the wand in his hand.
. Draco had a lot of difficulty wrapping his head around that, however when he considered how drastically his life had changed this year, he knew he simply had to accept it. His friendship with Luna and Violet had been unexpected as well, and while his history with Potter was far more volatile, he supposed he had to stop being surprised when strange things like this happened.
hi guys, sorry for the late update, hope you enjoy it; it was one of my favorite chapters to write :)
She was right, of course, but it couldn’t be helped. This year had been a relief in countless ways, all of which were undeniably related to the fact that the war was over, but it had also been full of challenges. Draco found that changing one’s opinion didn’t come without an internal fight every time, and he had spent much of his time this year agonizing over what he really thought, and trying to form answers to questions he hadn’t even known he’d had. His life had become even stranger, if that was possible, and he often felt like he’d lost his sense of identity somewhere.
As it turned out, Oliver Rivers
He hadn’t really understood at the time what was happening, because the first thing that happened was that he fell ill. He thought he must have just caught something from one of the kids at the school, and tried to push through. But soon he discovered he could barely get out of bed in the morning. He felt weak and fatigued; his head pounded, his body ached, his stomach tossed. Hermione had tried to help care for him, but she had been drowning in her own work as well. Finally, in a session with Rhiannon that he’d had to drag himself to, she’d set him straight.
“Doesn’t this sound familiar?” Potter asked, as soon as Draco stopped speaking. “I swear, I’ve heard
possibly be interested in another ma—
He hadn’t told Violet, or anyone really, for fear that he would be too afraid to go through with it and then have to take it back. However, he had used the Muggle flower book from the library for some inspiration. Madam Pince had given him a suspicious look, as it was his fourth time checking it out, but he always returned it in perfect condition, so she didn’t have anything to tell him off for.
Harry started feeling claustrophobic, Draco on one side and Dennis hovering over his other side, his comfortable Quidditch robes suddenly feeling hot and constricting.
Waya’s stern expression didn’t change, but Ashworth gave a small chuckle.
“Merlin, this is insane,” said Malfoy, finishing up at the bottom of the page. “Alright, spell something out for me.”
“Yes.”
“Was,” Harry found himself unconsciously correcting.
“Earth to Potter,” suddenly Malfoy’s fingers were right in front of his face, snapping quickly. “Merlin, I knew you were slow, but even Goyle was quicker than this.”
“As much as I hate to say it, sometimes your gut is right. You’re an intuitive person, Harry. I know it’s difficult and I know you’re nervous, but I think if you’re open and honest, you’ll be fine. You and Draco overcame years of enmity to become friends. I think you can handle this.”
was the last subject he should be bringing up around Harry bloody Potter, but Potter didn’t tense up or storm off the way he’d been seen doing when the war was brought up.
For Harry. To sit. On Malfoy’s cloak.
were not permitted to conduct this experiment on unsuspecting citizens!” Granger exclaimed.
“Sure,” Harry replied, re-reading his lesson plans for the hundredth time. At this point, he had it all nearly memorised.
“And Professor Slughorn—well, he—I mean, I don’t think—he wasn't—” Draco cursed himself for being so impetuous; here he had been trying so hard to keep his head down, to stay invisible, to go unnoticed, and he had to go storming off to the Headmistress just because he felt Slughorn wasn’t taking his future seriously enough. Did it even matter? Whether he got his N.E.W.T.s or not, Draco’s future had been stamped out the minute he’d taken the Dark Mark.
Draco had just looked at her, barely sitting up from his horizontal position on the bed.
Draco nodded slightly, remembering feeling that way for a brief moment as well, before reality came crashing back in.
Harry stared at her, and even Ron seemed somewhat surprised.
“She looks rather young, doesn’t she?” Hermione said, sounding somewhere between worried and judgmental.
“Yes,” he said, letting out a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding. “I do.”
Potter didn’t come out to him because he was his friend, he did it to
“Never let people know more about you than absolutely necessary,” she had always said.
He wondered if one day he would be able to remember every want he ever sold the way Ollivander did, but just in case his memory was not up to Ollivander’s level, for the time being he kept a log. In his first year, he had sold exactly sixty-three wands. He had worried that that wasn’t enough perhaps, despite how busy he had been, but Ollivander had been encouraging, saying it was a very impressive number for his first year.
“What? Oh, er, yeah,” Harry attempted a smile. “I’ll think about it.”
“It’s your decision, Harry,” said Hermione, which was a nice way of saying she disapproved of it.
“Only teasing, Jones. Besides, you know I didn’t ask for that. It was a group effort, it always is.”
, he didn’t know how he got when it came to Malfoy, but Hermione’s expression kept him at bay.
, he was so wrapped up in Simone that it was like he had blinders on to the rest of the world.
“You can block me out for the next ten minutes if you want, as you very well know.”
He could barely make it out in the soft blue light of Potter’s
Draco looked into his eyes, desperately wishing he could tell what Potter was thinking. His heart thumped manically against his chest.
“Only
“Oh,” said Draco, unable to articulate anything else. Mentally, he cursed himself for being so ineloquent, but aloud he just said, “Well.”
“What, now?”
“You’d think, at twenty-two, I wouldn’t write to my mother three times a week,” Malfoy said. “I don’t think she expected me to move out so soon. She’s all alone in that big house, it must be difficult. After my father went to prison…”
“Why not?”
like blokes too, in case you’ve forgotten. And
So he allowed himself twenty minutes to relax before going to his bedroom and changing into a different set of robes appropriate for dinner. He did enjoy dinners with Narcissa, even when they were after a long day of work. He had always adored his mother, but they had grown even closer the past few years, as he had developed a different relationship with her as an adult. He had admired her as a child, of course, but he had been a daddy’s boy growing up, idolizing Lucius while slightly fearing him as well. But as an adult, he saw how truly impressive his mother was, how capable and strong she was, with at true tactician’s mind and none of the volatile temper Lucius exhibited. He enjoyed spending time with her and was grateful for how their relationship had grown and developed.
“Great, now you’re
him, he reminded himself—to try and transform. Hopefully if he was in a nest or something, the branch would be able to support him, or at least he wouldn’t fall from such a great height.
Several of the portraits were looking at him now and when Draco dared to look up at Dumbledore, he was surprised to see that the old man looked rather amused.
“I don’t think it’ll be forever, Harry. Like I said, it is tiring. The shield will probably falter now and again. Maybe he’s just nervous now, the article’s only just come out. Give it a bit of time.”
She had been harassed at Hogwarts that last year by the boys in her grade, for being a Slytherin. Harry and Draco had stumbled upon her crying in a corridor once.
“He brings the girls here. He makes me watch.”
to hurt anyone. She was afraid of being hurt herself, we all were. It was just…”
A few tears escaped from Ella’s eyes, but she nodded.
“Cool,” Potter said, sounding relieved. “See you around, then.”
Draco didn’t quite know the answer to that.
She didn’t come every time, claiming she didn’t want to impose, no matter how many times Violet and Daphne insisted she was more than welcome, but Draco still saw her often enough due to the proximity of their workplaces.
He wanted to think that Potter had something to do with his invitation, but Potter had been surprised when Draco told him he was coming. He was a terrible liar too, so Draco knew the shock had been genuine.
He glanced at his book, making sure he was retrieving the right items from the cabinet. Once his arms were quite full, he returned back to where Malfoy was seated.
“I think maybe…I’m just not used to seeing her with a girl?”
“You heard me. You said it yourself, I’m doing you a favour here. So, I let you teach me, and then you’ll owe me.”
Head Unspeakable Jamison was a frightening looking man, tall and imposing with his face set in a permanent frown. At the sight of Granger and Potter, he simply looked exasperated, but on seeing Draco following behind them, his frown deepened.
“You did well, Harry,” she said, clearly sensing his nervousness. “I know you don’t like that they used the word ‘soulmate,’ but, well, it’s the Prophet. They have to sensationalise things somehow.”
Harry just nodded, withdrawing the vial from his robes, letting a drop fall into his pumpkin juice and then gulping it all down in one swallow.
“Come off it,” Potter snorted. “I just wanted to get a drink in peace. Can’t do that on Diagon.”
Weasley’s face looked rather constipated, but he stuck out a freckled hand nonetheless. Still completely bewildered at what was happening, Draco shook it.
What had really changed was that he was trying to trust people more. After Crabbe had died and Goyle had left, Draco had had the heart-wrenching realization of how lonely he truly was. He felt so much pent up anxiety and stress and no one he felt like he could talk to about it. He had never been good at making friends, and his parents had never taught him. He was a bratty kid and felt very self-important, as he had spent his childhood hearing how esteemed the Malfoy name was, and how inferior non-pureblood wizarding families were. He quickly learned that no one really wanted to be friends with someone who thought they were better than everyone else.
about?” Potter exclaimed. “Are you
“Milk or lemon?”
“I don’t think anyone thinks what he did was right, Harry. I don’t even think he does anymore.”
Violet was looking at him with a smile on her face and an expression that Draco could only understand as proud.
“Have you been going to the Quidditch games?”
Granger nodded and began to read, “‘
He could sympathise with Daphne. He was certain she had agreed to the pact, especially considering the Greengrass name would die out with Daphne and Astoria, since there were no male heirs. She had a responsibility to maintain the Greengrass reputation, to keep the line pure despite the name dying out.
Harry had never thought about it quite like that, but she was right. He remembered kissing Ginny in the Burrow before Fleur and Bill’s wedding, how everything had just disappeared around them, how nothing in the world mattered but her, for those few blissful seconds.
“Of course they did,” she said, reaching for the newspaper where Harry had set it down on the table and unfolding it, her eyes moving rapidly as she skimmed across the article. “What rubbish.”
“My mother used to talk about love all the time,” said Nathaniel. “She was such a romantic. She had all these poems memorised, and she would quote them to me as though it were a normal part of any conversation.
“I am not disappointed, Draco,” Snape reassured him. “Merely surprised. You are a man of many talents and I am sure you will prosper, as you did in my class.”
Now he had to hope that the man would want to reach out to him. He had put his intent out into the world, now the Quaffle was in the other man’s field.
“Harry?
Draco’s wand was in his hand in an instant, his left arm flying out to push his mother behind him. He didn’t even think, his reaction was automatic, an instinctual movement.
Potter’s eyes finally met his, and he offered a sad sort of smile.
“No, I’m serious,” said Pansy, but she was smiling. “You know how it is, you must get it even worse than I do. Everyone looking down at us. We’re forever going to be judged by the decisions we made as sixteen and seventeen-year-olds. I’d tell everyone who stares and whispers when I’m just going to Breadsmith for a bloody coffee to fuck right off.”
Draco didn’t even flinch at the words, but he felt them settle uncomfortably in his gut, twisting around with the wine—Death Eater. He never would escape them, he knew it, but being reminded of it was a blow all the same.
Harry’s mind was racing, mostly through memories with the D.A. The image of Hermione’s face when she first saw the form of her Patronus. The astounded gasps when Ginny cast a perfect
“What? Why?” he asked.
Filch and Mrs Norris continued to patrol the halls at night in hopes of finding a student to punish; Hagrid would be raising some strange and likely horrific animal down by his hut; students would sneak off to the Astronomy Tower to snog after hours; and Ron would continue to have seconds at every meal.
“Wait, but can that even happen?” Harry asked. Somewhere in Draco’s explanation, he found himself interested.
, you dolt, watch your—oh, bloody hell, they got the Quaffle.”
“Oh, Harry,” she reached out and stroked his face gently with her hand. It was clearly a gesture of kindness, but Harry couldn’t help feeling like it was somewhat condescending.
“I get to make the final approval,” he said, a decision he had made with Hermione’s advice, something that made sure there would be nothing printed against his will.
“Not my blood,” Potter mumbled. “Bad case.”
“That’s nice,” he said, pathetically, withdrawing his fingers from his left forearm.
her clothes staining red at an alarmingly rapid pace. Ollivander had been trying to help, fruitlessly, pushing rags onto wounds in an effort to stop the blood, but it had been coming from too many places.
Laurel often said things like that, in somewhat of a self-deprecating way. The first few times she had, it had been met with immense awkwardness and nothing but the scraping sound of silverware against ceramic.
“Hello, Potter,” Draco greeted him politely, standing from his seat. Harry felt as though his hands might start shaking at any moment.
him, especially not this genuinely, and about something so serious.
Draco looked at Armstrong, the Ravenclaw Seeker who shared a name with his favourite Thestral, who was circling above the pitch, chest pressed down onto his broom as his eyes searched for a glint of gold.
Harry considered this, and thought of Malfoy. He had always been, to Harry at least, the
“Fair point,” Ron grinned. It seemed a simple jab at Malfoy was enough to prove to Ron that Harry had not in fact lost his marbles. Harry looked over to Hermione, who had been suspiciously silent.
“Oh, yes, that’s the Prophet, give him a Knut, would you?” Hermione said, stacking up her folders at the end of the table.
“Oh, sweetheart, you’re in bad shape, aren’t you?” said Malfoy, softly. “Listen to me, the more you flap your wings, the more you’re going to tear at the wound. I know you’re scared, but I’m only trying to help you.”
“We wanted different things,” he said. He felt itchy, the bite of the wine scratching at him from the inside, the guilt over Nathaniel making him want to claw at his skin. “But he was very dear to me, he always will be.”
Pansy looked at him curiously.
“To be honest, I did need Hermione’s help figuring it out. And Ginny’s.”

But now, Blaise just laughed.
“Is she on call every weekend?” Harry asked, remembering how she had to leave lunch early last weekend as well.
“You’re arguing again, Potter,” Draco reminded him, keeping his eyes on the players.
“I followed your trial in the papers,” she said quietly, so that only Draco could hear. “Are you back in school then?”
“Draco,” he tried, and his voice softened without him even realising it. Malfoy looked at him wildly. “What happened to your mother? Are you alright? Is there anything I can do? I want to help.”
Ollivander’s store being right across from The Daily Prophet headquarters had been a daunting prospect for Draco when he started working there. Even while under Ollivander’s tutelage, there had always been the odd reporter hanging around outside with a camera, reading to snap a picture of Draco doing something untoward. Only after months of Draco living his typical, not particularly interesting life did they finally let up and more or less leave him alone.
“Oh? Who else have you had your eye on?” asked Chester Vogel, with a grin on his face.
In a different time, Draco would’ve already had his wand out and would be midway through casting the nastiest hex he knew. Now, however, he settled for clenching his jaw tightly and curling his fists at his sides.
Draco, who’d been able to see them in his sixth year, didn’t give them much notice, but that was more due to the fact that the gaunt, winged horses still made him feel rather uncomfortable.
“I’m—er…I didn’t—I mean—I’m…I’m sorry,” he stuttered out and Draco gave him a disbelieving look.
“What are we talking about?” Ginny slid in to sit beside Harry, stealing a piece of bacon off of his plate.
you daft Gryffindork. Flowers are a way of communicating. They have a language.”
“Seeing you again.”
“I’ll do my best to arrange that.”
At this, Draco could no longer stay silent.­
“When have you ever known me to have purely selfless intentions, Potter?”
“Oh,” Harry said. He didn’t know what to think. It was beautiful, the clearing, and Harry could see why Malfoy would enjoy his lunches out here. He just…had never really thought about Malfoy that way. As someone who…enjoyed picnics and the sun and nice flowers, like a normal person.
Hermione blinked at him, slowly.
Draco couldn’t help but feel slightly confused.
Malfoy didn’t seem to realise he had been ranting until he ran out of steam and he finished by choking on a breath.
always having to take everything from Draco, it was about Potter always winning, Potter always coming out on top.
“And you’ve been stuffing yourself on Molly’s cooking ever since we got back,” Hermione continued, and Harry was about to tune them out when McGonagall rose from her seat again, and the Great Hall fell silent once more.
"because it's not…" he began as he raised his hands to Draco's chest in an attempt to push him away "appropriate" he finished, failing to detach himself from the grip that tightened around his waist.
"Wingardium Leviosa" Malfoy muttered and raised their luggage to the carriage before they got in as well.
"I'm going down to the common room for a bit" he had said, looking somewhat accusingly at Harry "don't make any unnecessary noises" he continued with a raised eyebrow.
Harry's eyes widened as he took in the Slytherin in front of him. He knew he was staring at the blonde, but he couldn't look away.
Malfoy must have realized what was going on because, finally, he moved Nott away from him with a gentle push and stared at him.
"Thank God" Harry let out a sigh.
Harry could feel his body shaking. He glared at Malfoy, and before he could check himself, he blurted "but you pushed him away before!"
"Yes, Blaise" Malfoy said as they went in. "You've said that a million times. It's not my choice, you know. It's something I have to do. Anyway, you can come visit, as will I" Harry heard and felt Zabini sit down on Malfoy's bed.
“no…no…no!” Harry repeated, more firmly the last time “not doing that again”
P.S there's a spell with the letter than can transport you here to the dorms. Come at midnight. Ron and I will be waiting.
Recognition dawned on Malfoy's face "you do want to go out with me"
“this might help” Malfoy walked towards him with what looked like a small vial. When Harry raised his brow in question, Malfoy added “shrinking solution”
"Hermione…" Harry said, his voice but a whisper "you're choking me"
"Oh, Harry! Don't be silly! Come on, let's go outside for a while before I have to go to class" she said, and got up to leave, Harry, Ron and Ginny following behind.
"It will take more than a few days" he finally muttered, while looking at Harry with a weird expression "a large amount of the potion seeped through your skin, and it will take about a month in his calculations to get it out of your system" he said "sorry" and he looked sorry. Harry gaped at him. His mouth, he realized, had been open for some time. He didn't know what to say or how to react.
He used a spell to levitate himself and, upon reaching the door, unlocked and opened it with alohomora. It was much simpler to navigate with the help of magic. He tried to go unnoticed by the students walking in the corridors by levitating close to the ceiling. Once he got near the Great Hall though, he noticed both his friends sitting on a bench near the entrance.
Malfoy didn't come back till late that night. Harry had levitated himself to the couch and sat there waiting for him. He must have fallen asleep because as he opened his eyes, he saw Malfoy carrying him to bed.
"is that why you left class?" Harry asked Malfoy, who seemed like he was still deep in thought.
Chapter 12
"Did you finish?" asked Malfoy as he leaned against the wall behind him.
Finally, Draco decided it's time to go in "Pot…Harry, here you are" he feigned surprise as he walked towards them. Potter sat straight and cleared his throat "yeah, sorry"
"Slytherins don't play fair, Potter, I thought you knew that by now" said Malfoy with a twisted smile.
"Head Boy?" the voice was saying, sounding quite shocked.
Taken aback, Malfoy arched his eyebrow as he stared back at Harry in surprise.
"A month?!" he finally said, a shocked expression plastered on his face.
"Stay here" he ordered, and before Harry could say anything, he left the room. Harry looked around as if he were visiting a completely new place. He was so little, and so short! He looked at his enormous robes on the ground beneath him, at the legs of the chair and desk, and noticed the cauldron that had spelt its content all over him. He inched closer and stared at the green liquid inside. There wasn't much. He looked down at himself to check his colour. He looked just fine. Harry wasn't so freaked out yet, because he knew in half an hour or so he'd be back to normal. The potion just lasted a certain time, he might as well enjoy being so little. He heard the door open, and saw two pair of feet coming his way. He looked up and was met with Snape's drawling face, and sneering mouth, but that sneer suddenly changed upon seeing Harry to what seemed like a smile.
"Harry, we need to talk to both of you" Hermione said in a tone Harry knew very well. Something was wrong. Malfoy probably noticed that Harry was just standing there startled, because he gestured for them to sit on the couch. Harry and Malfoy sat across from them on the edge of the bed.
"I don't know...on the Quidditch field?"
Harry tried to pretend like he wasn't hurt to hear the scene repeated again and tried to focus on finding out the rest "and what happened next?" he tried to sound as calm as possible.
"what's going on?" Harry asked, a bit taken aback as the three of them walked further into the room, Malfoy walking behind them.
"Er…" said Harry. He remembered the password to the room he shared with Malfoy but couldn't remember this one. He stood there for a while, pondering what it might be.
"y…you…all of that…before" Harry stuttered finding it quite embarrassing to talk about what they were doing.
"Care to tell me what I just explained?" Snape asked, looking a bit smug. Harry, of course, had no idea what the Professor said at all. Well, if Snape asked him about how many hairs there were on Malfoy's neck, he'd tell him.
Harry went under the blankets and closed his eyes. He lay there for what felt like an hour before he heard Malfoy move from the couch to the bathroom.
"Now you answer some questions my mother will definitely ask you" Harry gestured for him to go on.
"Mr. Potter, I do hope you take your lessons seriously" he began, looking at Harry with an intense glare "especially Potions" he continued "you may go"
"Mr. Malfoy may not be our direct lead" said Dumbledore "but Lucius" he stopped for a moment as if to weigh what he was about to tell Harry "Lucius cares a lot about his power and his reputation, Harry, and while we know he is not helping the Death Eaters, he will not cooperate with us in any way. That's where you come in" Harry raised an eyebrow as Dumbledore's eyes twinkled.
Ron turned around in his chair to face Harry and said, “Is it the homework? This essay on the effects of knotwood is so frustrating! I feel ya mate.”
Draco nodded.
"Come ON guys, right now?" Harry groaned.
“Sure.” Ron and Hermione said simultaneously, rolling their eyes identically.

She’s walking over. 𝑆ℎ𝑒. 𝐼𝑠. 𝑊𝑎𝑙𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔. 𝑇𝑜𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑠. 𝑀𝑒. Oh my God.
“Um, Pansy? Hello?”
He felt so comfortable with his arms wrapped around his ferret, his head resting on the chest of the person he couldn’t imagine himself not being with, listening to his steady heartbeat. It wasn’t long before Harry felt himself drifting off to sleep...
He looked to his left and to his great dismay, Potter was also racing toward it.
“What, am I just that hot?” Harry said, winking.
It was a beautiful sunny Saturday morning, and everyone was glad not to have too much homework. Some students like Hermione tried to study, but between the warmth of the sun and the laughter and sounds of everyone else having fun it was impossible.
"Perfect!" Pansy exclaimed, and burst past them into the common room.
Dean was much too tall for his clothes to fit Harry, and while Harry's legs were longer then Seamus's, their torsos were around the same size.
He was far above everyone now, eyes scanning the stadium for a tiny golden sparkle.
ℙ𝕒𝕟𝕤𝕪 𝕡𝕠𝕧
“Do you like him?” Harry asked. Hermione looked between Harry and Pansy, as if she was pondering something.
He chatted with them for a few minutes before asking timidly, “Hey, can I bring my girlfriend over?”
She stopped abruptly at his words and icy glare, coughed, wiped away her tears, and sat back up on the bed.
༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄
“And it wasn’t just one sent about him, either. I smelled his chapstick, his hair gel, his robes, his cologne, HIM, what he had for breakfast... it’s ridiculous Hermione!”
𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑧𝑎𝑟 𝑤𝑒 𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑠𝑜 𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒 thought Draco, looking up at the chalkboard and trying to force back the slight flush on his own cheeks.
ℍ𝕒𝕣𝕣𝕪 ℙ𝕆𝕍
“Ohh! A guy!” She exclaimed.
“You two really need to grow up! Eighteen years old, full adults, you would have thought the racing to breakfast would have been long past, but noooo...”
Draco found his book last, sliding a sleek black book from the shelf. He cracked it open to the middle, his pale finger following the words he was reading for a few lines, brows furrowed in concentration, until he apparently decided it was acceptable and snapped it shut, striding over to the loveseat Harry was occupying, and sitting next to him.
Harry kicked off from the ground forcefully, the soft ground giving slightly under his shoes.
Hermione kept patting his shoulder and reassuring him quietly, and Ron would not stop complaining that he did not want to go.
They moved on to the deserts and Harry grabbed a treacle tart.
"Yes you are. Now for a sufficient top..." She said, scanning the room. Her eyes landed on Dean's empty bed and Seamus's drawn curtains. She started marching over.
“Hey Pans! What’s up?” Iris said cheerfully.
Draco turned around and started walking away, scowling in disappointment.
He could practically hear the pleasant crunch. Smell the heavenly aroma. See the colors erupt in his head whenever he ate one. Taste the sweet, tart juice. Feel the apple between his teeth as he chewed.
The Great Hall was chaos, people shouting and chattering, houses mixing in a mass of people; it was hard to hear anything over the ruckus.
He dashed out of there as fast as his legs could carry him.
Harry grinned, so happy for them. Ginny seemed to enjoy being with Luna much more than she enjoyed being with him, but Harry and Ginny had shared something special nonetheless.
He sighed, and yielded. “Fine, 𝑀𝑜𝑚.” He said sarcastically. Rolling his eyes at her.
Dean motioned with his head to Pansy. “I’m doing pretty well!” Pansy said cheerfully.
“It’s Potter, Pansy! I can’t stand it, his stupidly perfect glasses, his annoying unruly hair that I just want to run my hands through, everything! And then on top of all that, I smelled him Amortentia today! Ugh Pansy, you know what that means!” He looked down and ran his hands through his hair, groaning.
She pulled his hand away from his mouth and her nose scrunched up, giggling louder. "Y-you—kissed—Potter!" She gasped out between bouts of laughter.
