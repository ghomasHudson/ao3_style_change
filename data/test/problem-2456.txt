Drawing herself up, she says, “This had better not be one of your nasty deceits, villain.” Still, the hope of freedom is too much for her and wins out over her caution.
“Eh. Was wondering where you ran off to,” Draco says as he sidles up beside Harry.
“Thanks.”
Harry finds himself drawing closer to Dracon, hands hovering a good meter above his legs. “But you’ll get a permanent limp that way!”
“Finally, he must have done something because, suddenly, the thing just outright explodes, knocking him clear out the window.” Justin says, “You’re pretty much privy to the rest.”
He glances to the smoking building behind her. “Fight, of course.”
As he adjusted to a new weightlessness about him, he glanced around the ballroom, taking in the pale haze that coated every wall and piece of furniture and the hollow shadows that lurked in crevices he hadn’t noticed earlier. Harry blinked against the golden hue radiating off Ron and Hermione as they adjusted Harry’s prone body on the lounge. At first, he hadn’t recognized it as his body because of the dark shadows swirling around it, as though death was shocked to find a body empty of its host without express permission.
Ron growls deep in his chest, and Harry yanks him backwards.
“Draco?”
of hire he would be. Hopefully, while hired staff would think him a new henchman, any villains would take him to be hired staff.
“Don’t think you can distract me by changing the subje—”
The limited range of motion provided by the tux had prompted Harry to take the more traveled ways of transport, a mixture of bus rides and walking—which led to his run-in with the boat lady from last night.
A smirk grew on Malfoy’s face, devilish at the corners, and he leaned in toward Harry. “Why, yes,
“Yeah, I did too.”
“Ugh, I can’t believe you live like that.”
“. . . Anyway—” Dracon lifts the note up again “—I still don’t understand. Why ‘Izulu’? Certainly was hard to look up.”
“Plus the way Hermione was acting, you’d think you were out longer than just an hour—”
“Nice meeting you.” Potter gives a half-wave that he aborts partway through. Then he turns back to Draco. “All set, then?”

“Oh!” Hermione’s hand lifts to her mouth. “I’d forgotten. Westminster would have

After what feels like an eternity, the door opens behind Harry, and several professional heroes walk inside. He doesn’t recognize a few of them, but Mad-Eye and

Ron chuckles a bit. “Quite a way to make an impression on an old crush, eh, mate?”
“But surely Mad-Eye will figure out how they did it and how to counteract their tactics?”
With care and great precision, she removed three cloth bundles from her night-robe pocket and laid them out on the grass side by side. “For you, my sweet,” she whispered. Then she unraveled the bundles and revealed three Dark Marks.
Dracon’s drawling voice comes from the darkness now bathing them. “Where were you planning on taking me, then?”
The kids visibly consider the offer before they all agree to it. On the walk home to their two houses, the children badger Harry about his most recent adventures, and Harry tells them about the old lady who misplaced her boat. (“How could she misplace a
“Yes, but . . . this all started because I-I felt bad for him. And it turns out, I really shouldn’t have felt anything at all.”
Potter chuckles darkly and leans back against the wall. “You’d think. That’s what I thought too. But when I was alone after walking out, thinking I needed to collect myself... I just didn’t—need to. I thought the tears wanted to come then, but even after hearing their stories, their experiences, they still didn’t. And, Merlin, I remember standing in Ms. Adams’ loo with dry eyes and an empty reflection wondering if my compassion had dried up.” His gaze turns to the ceiling. “What if that vampire sucked more out of me than just my blood?”
He catches the slightest of movements ahead. “Hello?”
“Can’t. Too busy preventing hell from coming here.”
“From what I could track down.”
Suddenly, the noise of stone bashing against stone permeates the air a thousand times over. Harry darts a glance toward the Palace again to see the last of the stone gargoyles crash into the concrete as the source of their flight loses its power. He relaxes. “Great job, De—”
Potter walks close enough now that Draco could probably talk to him. If he wanted. About anything. But what could Draco say that wouldn’t bring bad blood to the surface?
“Your nephew,” Harry says.
They turn to stare at him.
“When’d you do this?” He shouts to Paper Dracon.
“Didn’t really notice that last one. Guess it comes with the territory of having ghosts constantly passing through them. Since I’m not doing that one on purpose, I can't really make that go away.” Malfoy shrugged. “But fine, I’ll stop with the shower visits—though, here, I thought you enjoyed our little shared showers.”
’s worries, in particular.”
Potter glances at Draco, eyes giving away nothing, but his anxious lip nibbling certainly does. “If you think it’ll lead us somewhere...”
It’s a possibility, considering he had attempted to pull himself together in front of Harry. But he hadn’t been very convincing. Harry doubts another villain wouldn’t have noticed his state either. The way Dracon had carried himself also suggests the fight had been more than just a scuffle.
“Didn’t they take enough already?!”
Harry gave a short laugh. “Wasn’t all me. I mean, you gave as good as you got.”
Withdrawing his fingers, he pulls out a small, green serpent-shape. He flings it at the stairs where Voldemort has descended to at least halfway down. As the paper creature falls through the air, it grows twice, thrice—ten times its original size! From the many scales covering its “skin,” Harry could easily claim this is by far the most complex of Dracon’s work.
and Cho had to destroy it.”
Not having to be told twice, Harry gathers his electricity to his fingertips. Then he shoots nearly everything he has at the paper bird.
Harry is jarred from his trance when he gets painfully knocked to the floor.
Since their little moment on the roof, Harry has seen Cho twice. Both times, they awkwardly greet one another before shuffling away. Still, it’s an improvement from their frostier relations over the past few weeks.
“They better not still be giving you grief,” Ron says, his eyes turning flinty.
!”  Ron’s voice sounds rough from inhaling the tainted air as he shouts Hermione’s hero name. “They’re getting away!”
He rubs the side of his nose, picks at a scab, and flicks the head away. “Sorry, mate. Tha’s confidential.”
“Do you want to come back to the observation room with me? You can . . . get used to being back while
Dracon hovers in the doorway, waiting for Harry’s reply.
“Well?” comes Dracon’s ragged drawl.
However, upon trying to end the life of a hero before it could begin, dear old Moldy Wart had been in for a shock.
seems to be coming around on the floor. They’re outnumbered, and Harry’s pinned.
“It’s not,” Potter says. “I meant sorry that I kept you waiting.”
“Perhaps you would not make the best Auror after all.”
After a moment, she huffs, grabs the bottle, and pours Harry the first shot.
“Okay. Fine. Keep your hand ready to blast me if it looks like I’m going to attack you.”
His gaze flicks from Draco’s face to Draco’s upturned palm and back again.
He’s sprinting when the building comes into view. The inconspicuous office building is ablaze even in the pouring rain, which tells Harry that it’s being kept alive through unnatural means.
Pride wells in Harry’s chest even as he’s carried up the stone stairs like deadweight.
Harry hedges his bets and writes for the room to see:
Mr. Hendricks sighs and rolls his eyes. “If you’re asking me if I attacked those two, my answer is I don’t know.”
“I mean, you were—you were distraught in your own way, though...” His brow scrunches while his mind flips through the memories of the past couple weeks. “You were great talking with the other victims
Ron blows out a gust of air. “Can’t be helped. No time.”
Her tone chilled him, as though her words pulled him into the hollowness in her eyes, and the empty void inside was frigid with the warmth of loving another person snuffed out.
Paper Dracon starts laughing like Harry had said something funny.
“If I was saving everyone on the bus, why wouldn’t I pull you out?”
“Yes, Mrs. Malfoy?”
“And that black eye?”
“Oh, Ron, I was just a little worried that Harry hadn’t made it back yet is all.”
“Okay,” Harry says. A niggling at the back of his brain says there’s something here he’s missing, a feeling that what Blaizing Fire is telling him is much larger than the flippant attitude suggests. But Harry is already so tired from his walk from the medical ward and from using his powers despite not having fully recovered, that he lets it go for now. Instead, Harry places the deck of cards on the table.
“Oh. I-I woke him up.”
“Like what?”
,” Luna says, making roughly the fiftieth circuit of her spoon in her tea.
Tracey looks at him with watery eyes.
He doesn’t know what to say that, really. He’s hardly had to deal with this kind of pain himself. Yet as he thinks on it, Harry knows he would readily die for Ron and Hermione—as they would for him. The mixture of love and despair that blooms in his chest at the thought is nearly enough to crush him. “But you’d have died for him, right?”
“Not with your shop, my good man. Rather with a tenant of yours.” Draco flashes the warrant he has, whipping it out from within his pocket. “If you’d be so kind as to show us the way.”
Paper Dracon flinches. “Better.” He swings it stiffly in the air. A pause. “How’s the head?”
With Lily’s Control over Sound and James’s Control over Wind, they became Sonic Boom and Twirlblast. They both wore full-body spandex suits—as was the fashion back then—and masks that covered their heads. Lily had pink and red circles and ringlets spotting her uniform on a light blue background while James had white and grey swirls decorating his mauve background.
If Harry were to take him to the hospital, Dracon would get treated—however, the guy would no doubt be arrested the second he regains consciousness. As much as Harry wants the villain to face justice, he also has plenty of questions crowding his mind. And Harry doesn’t doubt for a second—especially considering the most recent incident—that law enforcement would not make him privy to any of their interviews with Paper Dracon.
“Wha—what the
“Do you reckon he’s feeling a little anxious?” Harry gestures at the glass.
.....................................................
After a while, the life residue started affecting Harry’s eyesight, and, by the retching coming from further ahead, it was affecting Draco in a similarly detrimental way. Fighting off the cloying sense of claustrophobia, Harry floated back above the trees again, trying to search out his prey.
“But again, he wasn’t home at the time. Why ambush an empty house? It could very well have been a hit and run or coincidental robbery attempt.”
Harry took a vital few seconds to catch his breath before realizing he didn’t need to. Draco, already familiar with ghost-hood, had taken the lead.
“Wait!”
“Allow me to help you get that.” Harry reaches out and pulls the coat tighter around her frail frame. “It's getting nippier out now that Autumn’s here.”
Potter’s eyes take on a shifty light as he breaks eye contact to stare at a point beside Draco’s head.
asking, even if it is a little late into it.”
While not an uncomfortable silence, the two of them finish off their ice cream in silence nonetheless.
“Hmm, I suppose that makes sense.”
With respect to this, Draco keeps his voice low. “I said it’d be an uncomfortable situation that involves being around other people.”
“I don’t know if you noticed or not,” Ginny yells, “but while you were having your little rendezvous, we were all outnumbered by pro-Supervillains.”
The devilish smirk from when Draco first informed Harry of his intent to haunt him reappeared. “Let’s get to it then.” And he released the Snitch which bolted up for the skies.
Harry wants to argue, but the growing ache throughout his limbs convinces him to concede.
Moody gestures at all of Harry. “Not like that. All that electricity jumping off of ya’s bound to mess with the tech in the rooms. I’m surprised someone hasn’t flagged you down about this yet.”
“More vague answers, I see,” Voldemort says. “We’ve tried my extensive interrogation and torture techniques—albeit, I admit they’re not what they once were since that . . . incident. We’ve tried solitary confinement, and now we even let your father speak to you. Yet, you refuse to yield any further information regarding this beloved hero of yours.” He sighs as though in disappointment. “That’s quite all right. We’ll probably kill that hero eventually.
“Oh,” Draco said, looking around and flickering in and out in the evening sunlight. “I...”
“I hope you didn’t get into a fight,” Hermione says.
Potter just shrugs and follows Draco along as they weave their way back to Diagon Alley. “Are you really going to try to catch Mr. Dawkins at home today?”
“I beg your pardon?”
Blaizing Fire taps the fingers of one hand against the tabletop. “Like I said, villains know how to handle themselves in a bad situation.”
Beneath the glass lies a mechanical, grey, skeletal arm, two of its fingers twisted together to appear as though they’re crossed for good luck. Two of the other fingers have been decapitated at the knuckles, and the thumb’s detached entirely—it has been placed next to the hand. The detailed mechanical wiring flows down from its exposed point in the hand under some protective plaiting starting at the wrist that continues to the elbow. From that joint, a new set of plaiting begins that cuts off where the arm had been detached from the body, ending in a cluster of frayed wiring and jagged metal. Additional holes and slits along the protective armor suggest more damage to the machine. Within these damage points, Harry can see flashes of cut wiring, little white bits, and cog-like machinery—particularly at the joints.
Harry winces and swallows thickly. “Yes, well . . . . It’s a possibility, isn’t it? One that every hero accepts each time they put on their Supersuit. Any one of those times might be the last. I’m sure you’re aware of that.”
“Why not . . . ?” This time, when Dracon burst into laughter, he collapses on the ground, bringing the rubbish bin crashing with him. “Re-really? Me? A hero? Ahaha
“I thought you’d know that adaptation is a necessity in our lines of work.”
Harry snorts. “So that's where all of this is coming from.”
ing noises as her thumb taps the screen.
This one’s different from the rest. For one, he’s wearing a pearly white dragon skull mask, its mouth open in a snarl, the pupils of its eyes slit wide so that the wearer can see, and two horns arch out on either side of the face from the forehead. For another, he’s striding with too much swagger in his step to be a mere henchman.
“...Excuse me?”
“Say, how d’you reckon GarGoyle got those things to fly? Those rain spouts barely have any wings at all, from what I remember of them. Or at least
Harry scans his memories for some kind of family resemblance.
“My vampire’s not here.”
“As long as you’re sure...” Hermione gave a final counter-clockwise turn and the potion settled from midnight blue to cerulean with silver shot through. “The potion’s ready.”
“Uh, yeah. That’s what I said.”
Harry’s free from the wall by the time the guard and MPs leave the room. He frowns. Something’s still not sitting quite right with him. He just can’t place his finger on it.
If Harry’s not mistaken, he’d say they were thousands upon thousands of paper cranes.
He waits until Harry sits on the bed after closing the door. “Well, I’m here right now because they don’t expect tomorrow’s decision to go over well for me. Or at least, not as well as Blaise’s,” he says, apparently noticing Harry’s concerned expression. “After all, he’s not facing charges of three accounts involuntary manslaughter.”
Truthfully, Harry had been aiming for a hug. What he got was a wide-eyed Draco locking lips with an equally startled Harry.Their shock lasted mere seconds while their kiss lasted much longer, both of them surrendering to the embrace of the other—a surrender far more gentle and kind than the surrendering of their souls from their bodies.
“Yes, Potter. Why wouldn’t he share his daughter’s favourite meal?”
“Never mind.” Several more minutes pass before another thought occurs to Harry. “Wait, then why are you hanging around me?”
Standing in the wreckage, Ron had seemed unsure. But Harry had waved off his concern and allowed him to be swallowed up by the family’s demands for attention from “
“I say, since they’re all so keen to know our identities, we might as well get our shot at knowing theirs.”
He shifts his gaze from the building but can’t seem to spot the pyro-powered people responsible for maintaining the blaze. Instead, he makes out a dozen backlit figures clashing with one another. He recognizes the work of some heroes’ powers, like Cho clearly taking advantage of the rainfall or the flurry of bats swarming different figures at the behest of
“All right, I’ll tell you what you need to know. Come closer.”
“Partly. But won’t they kill you when they realize—”
“And a bubble bath,” Hermione mumbles.
Potter follows him over, slowly sitting in the seat across from Draco. “I still don’t get why you’re doing this.”
Mr. Park stares at Draco, eyes wary. “I don’t think I know what you’re trying to imply.”
ing of heels on tiled floor echo from down the corridor. Yet they don’t sound quite right.
“Complete extraction process is often fatal—particularly with the newer, more advanced models. Earlier versions could only stand so much power before overheating, so extractions would occur in groups of them. But Voldemort found diluting the power across multiple robots to be wasteful. If you’re exposed to any version of it, though,” Dracon says as the two of them head back toward the mansion, “your powers could be on the blink for days, weeks, or even months. But it really depends on how long you were exposed, to what intensity, and how powerful your abilities were in the first place.”
Toying with his empty cup, Ron asks, “D’you think it was poisoned? The blade tip?”
—I could’ve—You’d—”
This alley is slightly wider than its counterpart, but appears just as devoid of evidence of the criminal’s escape route. Stuffing his hands in his suit’s pockets, Harry’s almost out into the street again—ready to head home with this trip as a marked failure – when some debris near the mouth of the alleyway kicks up in the breeze.
“Why did
“Got a nice tear in the leg of my suit at the first one and had a pleasant chat with the police at the second one.”
Hermione has stationed herself so she’s at eye-level, her nose almost pressed to the glass. “The officers who dropped it off—what did they say about it?”
Ron raises his arm toward Harry.
Ron’s eyes flick past the villain and catch onto Harry’s through his mask; then they flit in the direction of Harry’s sparking hand. He lifts the hand not holding off the villain’s powers in Harry’s direction. The second Ron drops the arm locked on the villain, Harry’s world explodes.
The horse crashes right into Harry, and Richard adds another slice along Ron’s back with his sword.
“Uh.” Harry mentally shakes himself. “No. No, I’m fine.”
“Yes, Mr. Eeylops. My partner and I are here on official business for the Ministry.”
he thinks.
Once inside, chaos erupts. Everyone—all the Weasleys and Potter’s two best friends—try to swarm him, however Mrs. Weasley plants herself between them and Potter. It’s tense; unspoken grievances linger in the air. But gradually, as conversation carries on, the tension fades.
“No. No, I suppose not.”
“Why must you be so difficult?” Paper Dracon mutters.
Snorting, he says, “That’s a way to put it. Fear-Near demanded we move them to my flat. I’d felt uneasy about it, but I did it.” He lets out a shaky breath. “Then Fear-Near comes in with a new
thinks slacking off would mean I’d do it for him.”
“You have something else to do?”
“Just a little more background on the attack and your attacker, if you would.”
“You’re afraid what happened to Ce—your partner—will happen to the other heroes.”
She nods. “And what will you do?”
Draco looked up at Harry, some of the hairline fractures reappearing along his face. “What if I don’t want to be?”
will come back! Thinking I see it every time I so much as
A shout rings out in the alleyway as Harry reopens the break. Quickly, Harry re-aligns the bone properly. With one hand, he tugs open the first aid kit he left lying on the ground. Taking out a rail-thin piece of wood, he lines it up against the side of Dracon’s leg. “Hold that in place, would you?”
She scowls. “Yes, I know we knew that. Just that I don’t believe we really took the whole thought on the matter to its logical conclusion of a complete takeover of Britain by the Villain Agency.”
“Remember when I was seven, Father, and I went to plug in that battle simulator when the power surged, and I got zapped? It was like that. Sudden, overwhelming, thrilling, and over way too fast to have been real."
“Yeah.”
“Eh? Uh . . . .” He lowers his head as though in thought. “It’s getting there.”
What Harry’s looking for is relatively easy and quick for him to spot—a giant, gaping hole in the wall located a few meters down the corridor from the staircase they’d just ascended. Despite having his two arms braced across the shoulders of two different heroes, he manages to convey his point to the heroine in charge by loudly clearing his throat to get her attention and gesturing with his head in the hole’s direction.
Harry arrives back at the Weasley household, and it’s more boisterous than he remembers it being for weeks on end. He grabs Ginny’s arm as she goes to pass him in the hall. “What’s going on?”
A grin stretches across Ron’s face, and he jumps off the bed to throw an arm around Harry. “Okay, then that at least is settled.”
“But you are you.” And Draco sounds too breathless, and Potter will
Harry drops the bit back into the box, puts the lid back on, and replaces it in the drawer. Exhaustion hits as he reaches the top of the stairs. But as he re-enters the home full of wounded heroes, Harry remembers exactly what’s at stake.
“Yeah, I suppose.”
The scattered remains of the mechanical arm are in a box in the third drawer from the floor. He lifts it from out of the drawer and takes the lid off. To get a closer look, he brings the box under the closest light overhead.
Draco startles when Weasley’s large hand claps onto his shoulder.
“Sounds spooky enough to have been made by the Villain Agency,” Ron says.
Draco starts walking before he realises Potter isn’t beside him. Turning around he spots him standing in the shade of a shop overhang. He clucks his tongue on the roof of his mouth, waves his wand, and casts an umbrella charm. Another whispered spell and the translucent shield sprouting from his wand tip becomes opaque.
On the one hand, Draco is thrilled at the prospect of Potter—and the other victims—finally getting some closure. However, on the other, more selfish hand, Draco is disappointed that his excuse to see Potter every so often is coming to an end. He brings the first to the forefront of his mind and shoves the other one down deep.
After an eternity, Paper Dracon shrugs it off and waves a beckoning hand at Harry. “Well, come on then.”
“So, you fought a wounded man?”
Ron crosses his hands behind his head and tilts his gaze up toward the ceiling. “That’s rough.”
Harry wonders. “I mean, what other possibility would there be if he wasn’t in our custody?”
Harry turns to face him. “Yes.”
“Ah, is that true, Izulu?”
“Come on.” Dracon stands up and grabs hold of Harry’s upper arm. If he gets shocked doing so, Paper Dracon ignores the pain of it.
“Sorry you didn’t do it yourself?” He brought his hands behind his back and stalked towards Harry. “I mean, you did give it a good go in Sixth Year.”
So Harry waits there with
“B-but, the
Alpha Bee echoes the sentiment and leaves after Cho.
When they landed, Draco cleared his throat, shuffled his feet, and started pulling his hand away. Having none of that, Harry leveraged his hold on Draco’s hand to yank him closer.
embroidered in gold on the front—slides up beside them. Well, she appeared suddenly more than slid into the mist, meaning to Harry that she had likely been there the entire time—she’d just written herself unnoticeable.
“Does it have something to do with the machine you got into a spat and blew up a bunch of flats with the night I found you in a ditch?”
He stares at the entrance for longer than he would like to admit. It’s only the brisk wind cutting through his costume that finally spurs him into action.
Draco’s never really enjoyed this part of the job, which is why, he imagines, the higher ups in his department continue to give it to him.
He makes a move to head inside the building when an arm jolts out in front of him.
“Okay, okay. Easy. Stop shouting.” He knows he should feel more fear with the angry villain so close, but, Lord, if his head wouldn’t split open from more of that shouting. “That’s not what I meant, and you know it.”
“Yes, you bested me, hero.” Scorn drips from his tone. He crosses his legs at the ankle. “Now what?”
Feeling his anger melt away his astonishment, Harry powers up and lets loose a shock that has Dracon inhaling a sharp breath and releasing Harry.
Flashing Draco a smirk, Potter leans in again.
Harry can’t help but grin a little as he lets the two masks fall to the ground. Slowly, he internally reaches out for his electricity. He finds it, though it feels much weaker than it normally does when he goes to power up. But that’s fine; there’s enough.
Harry collects his thoughts and interrupts her mid-sentence. “Do you know why they would take it? The boat, I mean.”
Inside the envelope is a single sheet of paper that reads:
Harry leans his elbows on his knees, and his hands come together in a praying position. “Do you know why they would . . . go after your nephew?”
Shrugging, Harry shuffles the deck and sets up a game of solitaire. “Why did you give me your rendezvous point with Paper Dracon?”
! Izulu!” They shout.
“Do we know it’s the Villain Agency, though? That’s doing all the attacks, I mean?” Ron nibbles at his thumb nail. “Like, they could just be selling the information on the heroes to the highest bidder and that’s why it’s taken so long for these attacks to come.”
Wincing slightly, Harry goes for a reassuring pat on his bicep.
“I was at m’usual pub. Not the Leaky but a Muggle one—the Red Lion. They had this new bartender—quite the lovely one. I tried chatting ‘em up almost every time I went. And one day, the bartender... not exactly chatted me up right back, but offered to help me out of the bar when some of the other drunkards started getting handsy. We were out the back entrance and—” Ms. Adams’ hands tighten against the fabric of her robes.
“My help,” Potter says. “You want
Harry wiped the grass off his robes as he stood, now as eager to get this excursion over with as Ron.
Dracon stands up, and Harry doesn’t miss the shake in his hands as he hides them behind his back.
Keeping one eye on the
“Hmm, well . . . . Its mast is made from some rare metal.” She thinks a moment. “Acromium, I believe.”
“Excuse me?” Paper Dracon hops off the ledge and stalks closer to Harry. “I don’t think I heard you right. ‘Cause if I’m deadweight, what does that make you? Huh, hero? I took you down without my powers!”
Hermione starts lightly twisting a dark curl with her index finger.  “Well, to be fair, you are his enemy.”
In the following sullen silence from Harry, Hermione pressed the importance of Draco’s spirit finding peace. That Harry was being selfish for keeping him in a world he no longer belonged.
Snow had been on the forecast for today, but so far, the sky remains overcast and empty of flakes. For at least a little while, his flowers will remain untouched by the frost as he lays the bouquet down before his parents’ joint grave. He kneels before them and tells them all that has passed since his last visit two months ago, including how his heroics have been going, the recent hard cases, and his mixed emotions about it all. As he does, he wonders aloud what they would have done in his stead and begs for their guidance.
“Why not?” Tonks reaches a hand across the desk as though to grab Harry’s, but he doesn’t respond to her movements. “Don’t you trust us to watch out for anyone bad coming in? No one’s going to try to hurt you here.”
—” here Hermione tilts her head in Harry’s direction “—tries to talk to Blaizing Fire again.”

The thing
Ron runs a hand through his hair. “Well, you did have us quite worried for a little bit there, not knowing what was keeping you.” He shoves the dishes in the sink. “Hermione wanted to head out right at 11:20, but I wanted to wait and see. I mean, I know you can handle yourself, so I figured it'd only be something you’d need our help with if you weren’t home by midnight.”
“Okay.” Nothing felt ‘okay.’ “Okay, I’ll come back.”
Hermione and Ron have come out into the corridor. They stop as they take in the scene before them.
This time, the villain’s laugh comes out bitter. “Oh, I might be beginning to see why Blaise cracked. Anything to shut you up.”
“No. Yes? Kind of.” Hermione sighs and pulls her hands from her face. “She lost her partner on a failed mission.”
Harry really should put him under arrest—if only so they could have another person to interrogate.
When Draco finds himself on a couch in Potter’s sitting room, he still hardly believes his luck. He had been certain when he’d been summarily dismissed last time that he would never see the inside of this house again except as a painted head on a tapestry.

“Well, I see you’re still getting over the last one. Not seen a Healer for it, then?” Weasley taps at his own eye that mirrors the one on Draco’s face with the nearly vanished bruise.
“Fair and—!” Harry whipped his head around to face Draco, bringing them nose to nose. Almost like old times. “They’re
She shakes him a little, and Harry feels the urge to laugh at the irony—mere hours before, Dracon had been in his current position. “Do you even know what kind of important information we could have extracted from him? How could you let that slip through your fingers?” She lets go of him, and he leans against the wall and slides to the floor. “If any heroes die because of what the Villain Agency knows, that blood will be on your hands just as much as theirs.”
“I know that,” Paper Dracon snaps. However, he doesn’t move away from Harry’s sudden close proximity.
Flummoxed as to what this gift could be, Harry stares up at Draco, hands sweating at his sides. “. . . All right.”
“Yup. As well as what he stole.”
With confidence providing new life to his tired step, Harry strides towards the Supervillains. “Are you lot ready to surrender?”
A sizzling sound can be heard as his power strikes. Then a thrumming noise starts up as the current catches on and heats the graphite, making the lightning bird glow.
“Well, for one, you not only deaden people’s powers, but you can also
“Is that so?”
..............................................
With a deep feral growl, Dracon digs into more of his pockets, searching out more attacks to send Harry’s way. As he takes a step forward, forgetting in his rage about his broken leg, his good leg gives out from under him. His hands trapped in his pockets, Dracon’s unable to break his fall.
this apparent rift between the Agency and Paper Dracon.”
Harry looks beneath his arm so the guy’s back in his sight range.
“Er . . . Sorry about that.” He takes a breath and, as he slowly releases it, tries to bring the level of energy pumping through him down alongside his heartbeat. When he looks back at the sleeve, Harry feels a spark of pride at how much calmer the electrical jumps appear. “First time in a while I’ve been powered up without my hero suit.”
She turns her head to look at him.
“Then what are you suggesting it was, then?”
“Cheers, mate.” Ron raises his hand in farewell as the two of them exit the medical ward.
With care, Harry lifts his hand in the direction of Paper Dracon, closes his eyes, and feels for any energy radiating from the body like he did earlier at the explosion site. A light crackling pulse answers him, fainter than he’d like, but present nonetheless.
to you? You didn’t...?”
Harry’s not sure if he’s entirely ready for this kind of conversation at ten o’clock at night on a Wednesday. “Er, well, for starters, yours is temporary, ain’t it? Soon as you move your hand away from pointing at people, their powers come back, right? It’s been over a month, and Justin’s reportedly haven’t.”
He tries the first three doors to the left of him and finds a ballroom, a loo, and a closet. Upon opening the door to the ballroom, a maid catches him and asks what he’s doing. Prepared, Harry removes the note in his other pocket that reads:
“I hope so too.” Harry places a smile on his face that doesn’t reach his eyes behind his mask. “What are you doing nowadays, since you’re discharged from the hospital?”
“Pa—Actually . . . .” Her face scrunches up in thought. “It—would be . . . dangerous . . . for me to do so.”
There’s the other option of waking him up and just asking, but Harry suspects that whatever caused the severe injuries Paper Dracon’s sporting would have him on edge. Waking up to see a hero he hated would just serve as icing on whatever shit cake Dracon’s already eaten. He'd probably attack Harry on sight and agitate his wounds in the process.
’s image as well . . . I wouldn’t mind.”
At the sound of Harry’s wheezing breath and the tail end of his shout, Dracon turns around with his under-mask back in place. “Please! Can you save returning the gift until after I see you again? That way, whatever happens tomorrow, I’ll have something to look forward to.”
She sighed in frustration. “I haven’t got all night, so back up. I need room to—”
Ron looks around for a guard or policeman nearby and swears. “They must all be inside.”
steps forward, head held high. She looks down her nose at Harry in a way that makes him feel guilty—despite the fact that he’s a hero come to help. In a Scottish brogue, she says, “I’ll go with you.”
Malfoy tugged at his tattered left robe-sleeve. “I don’t know how I did it.”
Harry prides himself for remaining still except for the hand braced against the wall unnoticeably clenching. He stays silent as the officer continues past him, down the hall.
Draco’s an observer to it all, ignored for the most part in favour of Potter—though he gets a hug from Mrs. Weasley, a handshake from Mr. Weasley, and a stilted nod from Potter’s ex-girlfriend, Ginny. The brief interaction he has with Granger and Ron Weasley is notably less icy than last time, though.
As the Superhero group with Harry and Paper Dracon debates which direction is their best bet to go for escape, Harry glances around their immediate area. That location signal hadn’t just been so that the Hero Order didn’t accidentally blast Harry.
“I meant it! You need help.”
heart jack-rabbits in his chest.
“Uh-huh,” Harry says warily, uncertain as to where Ron’s headed with this.
, this should be of particular interest to you. You were the one involved with that kidnapping-turned-murder incident, correct?”
“And just where do you think you’re headed off to?”
I didn't apply hover text to every single alias every time it appears. However, a good bet on whether an alias has hover text would be when it appears for the first time in the narrative or chapter (beyond Chapter 2), it hasn't appeared in awhile, or there aren't sufficient enough context clues for the reader to infer who it is. For more obvious aliases (Like Paper Dracon, for example), hover text is applied only once—the first time their alias appears in the text beyond this point.
“Then afterward, I...” His smile fades as his hand brushes over his robe pocket. “Made it more dangerous. For you.”
“Ah, yes! In the basement. But they’re kept under lock and key, so I suggest grabbing the key-ring from the lowest drawer in the loo.”
“But you haven’t heard the stakes yet.”
There’s a boy and girl who both look roughly his age and have equally flaming red hair. They wear citizen fare. They're not heroes come to help him. Unfortunate.
Plopping in the chair, Harry locks his gaze onto the white eye patches of the villain’s under-mask. “So . . . . How’re you?” He didn’t really expect an answer to the question and is therefore unsurprised by Fire’s continued silence. “I actually came to ask a few follow-up questions, if you don’t mind.”
Creeping his way to the front of the warehouse, he peers around the edge to see Hermione and Ron—along with the younger heroes they brought for backup—losing a fight with the gathered Agency villains. He spots enough veteran villains to know the Agency isn’t playing around with this ambush.
Harry sits up straighter.
“Hey! Don’t go running off like that!”
Potter stands up, turning his back on Draco, and lets out a hollow laugh. “Merlin, it’s so funny, isn’t it?" Abruptly, he swivels around to face Draco again, one hand covering his mouth. "All this—this entire time, we’ve been tracking—he’s not—” He cuts himself off and starts pacing again. “God, there’s something wrong with me. I mean, truly—and you’d know, too, wouldn’t you, Malfoy? You’ve always liked to point out the things that’re wrong with me. So, you must’ve noticed.”
“Hey.” Harry claps Justin on the shoulder. “Just because it’s an odd power doesn’t mean you can’t make it work for Superheroing. You’d just have to be a little more creative.”
“Do you really think the older heroes would just accept that, mate? I mean, would you?”
the peachick hopped down onto Malfoy’s lap, leaving a hole the size of Harry’s fist, if that fist were larger and crueler, where Malfoy’s heart should be.
“I got a better look at it when he took it off. Seemed to be a white, snarling dragon skull.”
Harry understands his strange hand motion to mean “attack on the Hero Order.”
“Yeah. Not bad, Malfoy.” And those were the last words spoken between them that night. Granger and Weasley quietly move on after that, keeping their distance from Draco once the obligatory acknowledgement of existence was over.
Potter pulls back but not entirely away from Draco, and his face isn’t closed off or twisting in disgust or— “Malfoy, I’d like to kiss you.”
Harry scribbles:
, Ms. Davis?”
Ron jolts backwards from where he’s glaring a hole into the villain’s under-mask. “What? I thought we were going to ask him what the hell he and his mates were doing yesterday?!”
“S-sorry.” He ducks his head and rubs the back of his neck. He stepped right into this one. “I didn’t mean to follow you-er-well. I mean, I meant to follow the person who left, but I didn’t know it was you. I wouldn’t have. Uh, if I did, that is.”
“Actually, it’s probably more about my misery than yours.” Draco feels a grimace flit across his face before he can suppress it. “My supervisors are less than fond of me. They’re aware of our history enough that I would probably be the best choice for you, but you’d be the worst choice for me—out of the other available cases, that is.”
“Yes,
The group throws more questions Harry’s way, but Harry cannot answer without giving his identity away. He dodges as one of them throws a blow at him, and he waves his arms frantically in front of himself. Then he makes a writing motion on his palm.
“How do you mean?”
—it would destroy her. I’ve hurt her enough with all of this.”
Ron has a point, but Harry isn’t about to give it to him.
“M’kay.” She pulls out of Harry’s arms and attempts to stand straight.
Instead of snapping back at him like Harry expected, Malfoy drew more into himself.
“I—I don’t know, Potter! You sure your Astral Projection didn’t infect me with—” Draco cut off as the light died down and, instead of his last baby peachick, a ghostly Silver Snitch beat its wings against the edges of his chest hole. When he lifted a hand toward it, the little thing popped out and nestled itself into his palm. “Huh.”
“You say you saw the vampire in daylight?”
Finally, Blaizing Fire says, “No. They didn’t.”
Harry’s so floored by the willing admission that he only realizes he’s been staring blankly at the place Dracon stood only after he fled—again.
A shudder goes through Harry as he continues to walk forward.
“Come now, Potter. You know the question here is really what
Harry pretends to consider it, before he leans in and gives Draco a chaste kiss. “Okay, hero.”
“But we’ve always hurt each other. Why wouldn’t I—?”
“Yeesh. You’re jumpy today, aren’t you?” Dracon’s sigh is loud in the stillness of the building. “No, I don’t plan to shove you off.”
’s star-covered coat. “Please, don’t interrogate him without us.” He sucks in a breath. “Whoever he is, we worked just as hard to bring about his capture. We’re owed an explanation for why we had to fight all those villains today.”
that should reveal a character's true name after their alias if I applied hover text to it. (Understandably, this could make reading confusing. So for mobile or tablet readers, feel free to make a copy of of the Super character legend found in the
Instead, Harry shifts his attention to the manacles keeping Dracon’s pale wrists bound and chained.
........................................
Harry coughs when he goes to answer, throat stinging from all the smoke he inhaled. Even so, having someone thank him for his help is a new feeling, and he doesn’t know quite how to handle it.
“Says me, who can still freely move around and who is powered up as we speak.”
“Honestly,” comes a voice just beyond the growing fog, “what would you boys do without me?”
The elf snaps his fingers, and Draco finds himself in the outside square, alone but for the rain and his thoughts.
Hermione says, “Try asking him what he wanted you to do, if you were really set on helping him. Or maybe asked him how you could have helped, if you wanted to lead the conversation in that direction.”
“Do you think I’d be having the same conversation with Ced? If he were here instead?”
He turns away from Draco, then, arms wrapped around his middle. “You saw him in there. That monster—that man...”
“Good,” Ron said. He still stood in the same spot where he’d arrived, wand tapping in an awkward staccato against his leg. Harry had forgotten he was even there; the world had narrowed down to just him and Malfoy and Malfoy’s breaking expression. “Right, then. I don’t really think it’ll do us any good to stay here longer than we should. Malfoy, if you’d show us where...?”
“Well, you can’t—” Harry was saying. And then he blinked and found himself standing in a lush, overgrown garden, Ron and Draco by his side. “What the—”
Latching onto the fabric covering Paper Dracon’s chest, Harry pins him to the alley wall, their masks nearly touching. “I know exactly who I’m talking to. Someone who has information we need to prevent unnecessary deaths.”
.  And I never will be.”
’s unsteady walk again, heading in their direction. While he knows he and Dracon have to move before they get back in its range, curiosity compels him through his exhaustion to tug out the key Voldemort gave him and try shoving it in the lock. Its teeth are too big to fit.
Unfortunately for Harry, he’s the only hero on call tonight for this section of London.
Draco kept blinking at him, as if the next time he opened his eyes, this vision of Harry would either be different or gone. “For magic like that... there has to be some consequences, Potter.”
“Huh?” Harry says with a distracted air. “In a warehouse?”
So, Harry consented, if only so that Malfoy might stop his skulking. Later in the week, Harry confronted him with the plan, and to Harry’s surprise, Malfoy agreed.
Harry wonders.
Harry wonders if it’s because he’s realized how much it hurts to move in his state. He swings his legs out from their crossed position and over the edge of the ditch, idly kicking the dirt with his heels. “Rough night?”
The door opens behind him, and two sets of hands grab his arms.
“What’re mates for?”
“Yes, my boy.”
“Oh,” Potter breathes out and takes a step toward Draco.
“You probably agitated what injuries he—W-what do you mean ‘
“Did you go along with the plan to lure him to the ambush site so as to curry his favor by letting him go? Were you hoping to ingratiate yourself with him? Maybe see for yourself what it’s like to play hero?” The hissing voice pauses. “Did you think you could escape what you are? Do you honestly believe that when that hero looks at you, he could see anything more than a villain?”
“A mother never asks a question she doesn’t already know the answer to.” She gave him a wan smile. “Despite your belief to the contrary, I was a good mother.”
Draco leans in to meet him halfway when a sensation under his hand causes him to stop. “Potter—”
He could just try opening different doors and see what happens. While that tactic would increase his likelihood of running into villains, this had been why he’d come in his disguise. And even if his under-mask were to be ripped away, he might still be in the clear. Without his electricity running through him, he hardly looks like the Superhero Izulu. His hair is down, and only the scar on his forehead remains after not powering up all day.
“Yeah, mate,” Ron says as all of them are steadily lifted in the air by bats. “How did you get out?”
Harry laughs because it’s true. “So, you got your book, then?” He asks as Hermione—dressed in her violet, full-body spandex costume with a giant
“All right,” Draco says at the same time one of the Aurors in the room says, “You sure?” Draco sends the man a withering glare.
“You’re going to be like this the whole time, aren’t you?” Draco asked as they floated towards the Veil.
“The Villain Agency.” Harry watches as her face turns ashen.
The Villain’s sharp laugh interrupts Harry. “Like hell I’d agree to that.”
Snorting, Draco muttered, “Only you...”
“C’mon,
“Well, we already knew that, Hermione,” Ron adds.
Adrenaline spiking in his veins, Harry takes the jump to the next roof over without fully measuring the gap. As a result, he falls short, his hands sliding on the rain-slicked bricks of the building wall.  Uselessly, he powers up in his sudden panic—his electricity won’t break his fall. He descends for a good half a meter before his fingers catch at a window ledge, his wild electricity reverberating off the glass of the window so hard that it shatters.
As Harry stumbles backwards, an explosion echoes outside the barrier. He pulls some of the lightning Hermione created to himself, sending a small shock to Dracon’s hand when he goes to release more paper puppets.
is not happy to find out the both of them have been out of bed. She lectures Harry and Cho about how she doesn’t have the time to re-heal them if they exacerbate their conditions. Considering Cho is dealing with burn wounds while Harry handles a concussion, Poppy spends an extra five minutes warning Harry about the dangers of too much light hurting him.
Malfoy let his hand drop. “Wasn’t alone then, too.”
“Thought I’d have removed it?” Dracon hums lightly under his breath. “I suppose that would have been the thing to do.”
The confidence he’s been lacking since first appearing in the square outside Grimmauld Place returns to him then.
“I doubt that’s all it is, mate.”
“But I have it under control now!”
Harry fiddles with the cuff-link on Blaizing Fire’s outer coat. Steeling himself, he first removes the flame-red identification mask, and then he takes off the under-mask.
She readjusts her gold
As he heads out of the hospital, Harry thinks about how the cop told him one worthwhile detail—however unintentionally he may have done so. The police are stationed to watch over the survivors of the hostage situation. Which means they have reason to suspect the culprit to come after them—that it wasn’t a circumstantial kidnapping-turned-murder after all.
“Try describing them anyway.”
Harry’s smirk fades off his face.
He hears Dracon’s breath stutter out of him despite the crackling going on around them.
Draco spares a moment to feel grateful for his mother’s connection to this family; undoubtedly this part of his task would have been more difficult otherwise. Once inside, Draco shucks his cloak onto the coat-rack by the door. “Where can I find—”
Draco’s heart sinks into his stomach.
Alpha Bee grabs onto her shoulders and spins her to face him. “I know you’re upset, but you need to get a hold of yourself.”
“Hmmm, okay. I had been taking a walk in the local park with some friends—Hannah and Ernie.” He looks at Harry for recognition. “You know, the other two you pulled out of the building that night?”
For once, Draco is fine letting Potter be the center of attention, and not just because that was the entire reason for bringing Potter here. No, Draco’s more than fine being a wallflower because he gets to watch as Potter unwinds more than he has in days—likely weeks. As the night wears on, Potter loses more and more of his layered clothing, until he finally reveals his face to the people he considers family.
Harry clutches the piece he’s gathered, even as a corner of his mind tells him he’s trying to rationalize his actions. While he’s investigated crime scenes both before and after law enforcement has, he’s never done so in the midst of their examinations. But, really, it’s hardly all that different from gathering evidence while at a crime scene before law enforcement becomes involved.
She does.
“Hmm . . . I say he might have the right idea not trusting anyone. Prolly not easy, what ya do. Always gotta watch your back.”
If at any time beyond this point you have difficulty keeping track of who's who regarding Hero Aliases, or you forget which alias belongs to which person, you can hover your mouse over the alias in question for character clarification if you're reading on a desktop or laptop.
are in here. He recognizes some heroes like the pair that went missing up north, while others, he does not know. Scanning the group of masked faces, Harry does not see anyone wearing a costume or set of masks similar to Paper Dracon’s.
“Oh, is that how you feel?” Harry pauses in his dealing. “What if I told you we were going to play poker?”
“That must have been really frightening.”
And he was ‘getting on it’ when the explosion from outside the West End shopping district of London shook the very street he stood upon at precisely 7:30 pm. After making his excuses to the
And then Ron asked, “Have you asked the git where his body is?”
“Hah! Not even if you wished it, Malfoy.”
“And did you catch any?” Hermione’s eyelids keep fluttering behind her mask like they want to remain closed. “Of the villains, I mean. They did end up running away.”
Harry watches him shuffle paperwork on the desk.
“Hey! Easy. I thought we were friends?” Harry told the peachick.
Mrs. Figg takes a step forward, finger still raised. “Don’t go slacking off. Get going!”
“Oh.”
Harry nods.
~~*~~
Hermione hadn’t been near Malfoy Manor since their Snatching and her subsequent torture at the hands of Bellatrix LeStrange. Harry felt the sin of the offer that was not his to make slither from the tip of his tongue down into his stomach where it writhed like a parasite.
“Er . . . I can show myself out.”
Potter doesn’t let go, though there is uncertainty in his step as he follows Draco—who’s walking slowly backwards.
With a light tread, Harry makes his way across the container until he’s beside Dracon. He stares down at the motionless villain, checking for any sleight of hand or sign of cheap tricks. When he finds none, Harry slowly levers himself down until his legs run parallel with Dracon’s down the container’s side.
The guard had shielded the two MPs still on the floor, and, by his twitching, Harry guesses he received a zap as well. Harry winces.
wasn’t about to wait the whole time you were out. But second helpings are a must. It’s Mum’s food.”
Harry wonders.
to even be a part of all this—
“Look,” Harry said, swiping a hand through his hair. “Having been around his pompous, petulant arse for the last year has actually been fulfilling for me. In ways that I’d tried and failed at finding after Voldemort fell. I know you’re worried, but I think this’ll not only make Draco happy, but... I think it’ll make me happy too.”
“I thought you got him!” Harry picks his head up from the ground.
Ron’s tackled to the ground, the monster bird’s beak lunging towards his face. He dodges and the creature bashes its paper beak into the cement, scrunching it up almost immediately.
Harry’s stomach drops. “They—they didn’t . . . remove it. Did they?”
Facing back toward the stairway, he swallows back the tears that threaten to fall and compromise the visibility of his lenses.
“Not always.” As Harry says this, he notes the uncomfortable tone in Dracon’s voice.
“Shhh.” Potter runs a hand down Draco’s back and slides the other into his hair. “It’s okay. It’s all right, Malfoy.”
“Oh, Mr. Fortescue, we couldn’t—” Potter starts.
“Are too,” Ron said. “Letting the sod mope about your home for over half a year.”
. I’ve not cried once this whole time, not even during the attack,” Potter says while he sounds like he may very well cry right now. “I don’t even know if I can, anymore. I just feel—hollow. Empty. Dried up. And you saw all of them, right? This isn’t normal. Even—even that vampire that bit Ms. Adams and Mr. Park and that other victim that was too
“So, does that mean you’ll tell me what I need to know?”
Boldly, Draco maintains what he suspects is eye contact. He really did do a good job on those shades.
Despite the somewhat flippant attitude, Harry can see the flush creeping up Draco’s neck from under his dress suit’s collar and the way his hands tug at his shirt sleeves.
Draco had the same idea because he rose above the trees moments later, a scowl reminiscent of their school days twisting the joy off his face.
“There’s the rub of it though, isn’t it? The potion might
One of them asks him to play a round of football with them. The goal posts consist of a knocked-over fruit stand and the mouth of an alleyway with fishnet stretched across it.
“Yeah, see, the only reading I do for a hobby consists of sports mags, and we already get those in the post.”
A cluster of crushed paper birds lie under the remains of the broken stone statue.
Out of the corner of Harry’s eye as he twists slightly to look towards him, he sees Ron raise himself up as if pushing toward the surface from underwater. His hand lifts a second later, aiming for something beyond the pew, seemingly as equally as slow to Harry.
Crouching down, Fire hands Harry the items and, in a hard voice, asks him why he’s here.
The two of them are nearly mask to mask before Harry feels a tug on his costume that brings him jolting back into his seat, Cho likewise.
He blinks, and Potter’s wand really
“I-I see.”
“Hang on, how’s Malfoy supposed to come with us?” Harry asked.
“Why? It happened; it’s over. There’s no real undoing it or anything.”
Reaching out his right arm, Draco repeats, “Take my hand, Potter.”
“When else would a vampire attack?”
concerned. But he doesn’t kid himself about the dangers of revealing that to an enemy. “We’d never send one of ours out in your condition.”
“All right,” Draco says, calmly picking up a leaflet that dropped to the floor. “Then could you elaborate on the incident? The statement that you gave us indicated you were attacked after dark—”
A gloved hand shifts the scarf around until Potter has a mouth-hole. “Diagon?”
Three days later, a tawny owl drops a small missive on his desk at the Ministry.
Concern flashes in Potter’s eyes. “Malfoy—”
“Well,” he says, twisting the paper between his fingers, “I haven’t really run into you during your patrols since the—”
“Huh. What could my friends and I—or any of the other hostages—have that people like that would want?”
Harry, stunned, wonders if Dracon realizes what he’s just implied.
Something snaps in Draco then—likely his restraint—and his head lunges forward. A whine tears through his throat as his lips crash against Harry’s.
“Doubtful.” Harry plops himself on the bed beside Ron. “Out with it.”
“Why?” Blaizing Fire still sounds amused. “We’re enemies. What other reason could there be?”
and see what he says.”
Alpha Bee sets a hand on Harry’s shoulder, and his eyes twinkle at Harry beneath his slim mask. “Oh,
Three weeks into the manhunt, Narcissa Malfoy returned to England from whatever hidey-hole she’d snuck off to when Voldemort’s reign fell apart. Aurors had to escort her raving form from Ministry premises, calling out for her son. Evidently, the Aurors couldn’t turn over Draco’s remains for family burial rites because they were needed for the upcoming case against his murderers once they were caught and taken into custody.
will kill him!”
“You’ve made my afterlife worthwhile,” Draco said like Harry’s words ripped it out of him.
Their prisoner keeps his silence and his stillness. The only indication he even lives are the sounds of subtle breaths he takes.
, Harry would prefer not to find out.
The swan crumples, lifeless on the concrete.
Instead of an acerbic reply like Harry expected, Malfoy just gave her a tight nod and moved back against a hedge that lined the drive. By the flush in her cheeks, Harry surmised that Hermione was surprised too.
“I wish we could play one out with an actual Golden Snitch, but I suppose you didn’t get one to astral project along with you?”
“Could you tell if that was aimed at the robot or his colleague?”
Holding the folder out to the three young heroes, Alpha Bee patiently waits until Hermione grabs it before speaking. “What you have in your hands is quite delicate information. Rather deadly, I’m afraid, in the wrong set of hands.”  He folds his arms behind his back and watches Hermione open the folder.
The Hero Order had decided to throw a celebration for Draco filling in his hero application papers and for Blaise having his papers approved.
“Bugger off, Potter. I’m winning this, you’ll see.”
Rushing through the halls of Parliament, they enter the House of Lords, now looking quite destitute with the amount of wreckage the room received from the villains’ attack. A gaping hole is blown through the roof, and most of the lights and the front rows of red felted seats have been additional casualties.
Hermione hops off her bar stool and hovers in front of Harry and Ron. “Do you want us to pass the information along to the other heroes involved in the case?”
Mouth suddenly dry, Harry says, “W-well—I, uh, treated . . . .” He coughs into his hand again, and the other hand fiddles with the back of his mask. “I set it in a splint.”
Ron grumbles a bit while they walk out into the street. “Fine. Whatever. Let’s see if we can find law enforcement around to take the villains inside into custody.”
Blaizing Fire leans across the table, a cat prepared to jump an injured bird. In a voice several octaves lower, he says, “Deal.”
“You could say that,” Harry says. “Though, I was hoping you might be able to enlighten me about something as well. May I come in?”
“Woah, you mean they were Agency villains that kidnapped us?”
Harry’s lips press together while he watches Ron raise his hand again. He doesn’t offer a protest this time. Having his power shut off from such a high point of use feels a lot like coming to a sudden stop in a car after flooring the gas pedal.
Dracon chuckles.
“Funny. That’s what I had been planning to ask you. So, you have no idea?”
“You’re saying that as if you haven’t been haunting Harry for months.” Ron crossed his arms. “Or as if we’re not going to get you some justice, despite you being a giant wanker.”
Dracon’s only answer is a whine of pain that sounds like it fights its way out of him.
Hermione glares as she sets down her plate.
“Oh, like I’m going to take a threat from heroes seriously. What my lot would do to me if I said anything’s guaranteed to be worse.”
Unhappy with the scant information and believing Harry knows more, the cop continues interrogating him.
“’A little worried’? Mate, she was dead set on dragging me out to scour the ci-Ow!” Ron glares as Hermione innocently stares at her plate.
Harry has to agree, and, from the way the Supervillain drew back in his chair after having not moved a millimeter since Harry’d first laid eyes on him, he also feels floored by the request.
“Wha—”
A numb sensation washes over him. His mind races with so many thoughts that he feels as though he’s hardly thinking at all.
hurls more scissors, and even a pocket knife, their way. However, instead of clattering against the wall uselessly like last time, the sharp objects curve as they pass over the pew. The pair has to dodge again as the blades skewer the seating from the back.
The rest of the time Harry spends fixing up the break site is spent in silence. When he’s done all he can do, Harry stands back up and helps Dracon to his feet.  “Well, that’s it. I recommend you go see a professional, though. What I did won’t hold for as long as that needs to heal. Plus, you need to think about the possibilities of infection and—”
With a sigh, Malfoy sank back down beside his chair, though refused to take it again. “It’s not really about
Potter’s jaw ticks as his eyes narrow at the motion. “Out with it, Malfoy. What’s so important, you nab me before breakfast?”
Part of Harry had expected Malfoy to escalate his malignant behaviour in a haunting blitz after the bruising his ego took, so he had ferreted away anything of remote personal value to him at The Burrow. However, in the following months, Malfoy’s crusade against Harry seemed to crawl to a standstill, wherein he just started occupying space in Harry’s flat without being much of a bother. On the other hand, Harry’s moving of personal items to The Burrow led to a flurry of questions from the Weasleys wondering if he planned to sell his London flat and move in. Harry dismissed the prodding inquiries with the explanation of having “a pest problem.”
and I told you about playing out in the street?”
Taking that as all the invitation he’ll get, Draco boldly climbs fully into the attic, his head nearly brushing the ceiling when he stands at his full height.
The heroes’ attention shifts to the left as Hermione’s carefully constructed haze barrier blows away due to another barrage of explosions.
Fisting both hands into the front of Harry’s silver robes, Draco shoved him up, bright eyes scanning Harry’s face with growing panic. “Wha—Harry? What
Roughly ten minutes later, he and Ron get split up when Ron has to handle a drunk driver that nearly smashes through a family’s sitting room. At first, they both thought that this was the event they had been waiting for, but it soon became clear it had been a regular DUI case. Harry tells Ron to handle the incident and that he’d be fine on his own for a while.
Harry pulls back at her outburst.
! It doesn’t make sense.”
Fire’s knees buckle, and he collapses, lighter fluid dropping out of his hands.
According to Ron, she’s been like this with most of the recovering heroes in her house when she runs into them. Hermione seems to believe Mrs. Weasley is relieved that at least some of her guests are getting better—the luck with healing the poison victims has been dicey at best. Though, both admit that Harry has always been a favourite of Mrs. Weasley.
“Potter,” Draco says again, this time with his hands placed in front of himself in a placating gesture.
“Thanks,” Draco says as Mr. Park sets the kettle on the stove-top. He slides into one of the chairs, peripherally watching Potter pick one that’s two away from him.
Spinning on his heel, Draco starts to trek down Diagon Alley, hoping Potter excused the colour spots in Draco’s cheeks as coming from the cold.
“Oh, we’re so sorry! I can’t believe we thought we could handle an ambush!” Hermione yells as thousands of Ginny’s bats descend and latch onto the heroes’ costumes while they run.
“I meant about having you wait several days before my answer. It would’ve been sent sooner, but Kreacher was reluctant to fetch me an owl. You made a poor impression, apparently.”
They sit beside one another on her couch, piping tea placed on the little table before them. After adding two lumps of sugar to his cup, he turns back to Tracey who continues to eye him warily.
“It was definitely an all-black get-up. I could definitely see why it had been hard to see him in the shadows of the room. But he stopped retreated before the angle of the light could shine on his head.
Harry swallows while Blaizing Fire shakes his head.
as he rises from behind a pew of his own, large cloaked arms lifting like a bat’s and releasing four butcher’s knives from his fingers.
Through what sounds like clenched teeth, he says, “Break it again. So it can be reset and heal properly.”
His Department may have actually caught the vampire. They just need to bring in the victims to identify their attacker in a line-up. So, those still involved are called in later that same day.
Ron doesn’t wait around to be told twice, and Harry’s right on his heels, ducking as the two groups of gargoyles form into one that dives for them both as they bolt out the door. They both take the stairs two at a time, breath rushing in their ears.
“And what d’you expect me to tell Mum? ‘Ginny frolicked off to find her own little adventure by the Thames and injured a gang member’?”
“Looks like your mate there’s about to give out.” Dracon’s voice becomes malicious. “Then what will you do?”
“And second—why would you, a hero, pick a legend associated with evil?”
“I heard you were concussed. I didn’t know it was bad enough to make you babble.”
“Yes!” Harry shouts, already feeling himself lose grip on the electricity flowing through the hammerkop. “Please, hurry!”
“Don’t forget,” Harry says. “It’s not really us who faces the most danger here. The Agency doesn’t have our identities. Maybe the burden of patrolling the city should go to us younger heroes while the older ones lie low.”
However, he did feel the roiling dizziness he associated with falling off a broom and plunging hundreds of feet to the Earth. Slamming into the ground, in this scenario, felt a lot like bursting out of an ocean for air after having been drowning for so long. This resurrection from the depths of life had Harry bolting up out of his skin. He gasped in air that no longer felt real in the most freeing of ways.
Now Ron’s snorting into his shoulder. “Okay, yeah, a Supervillain. But they’ve stripped him of his suit.” His mouth takes a serious turn. “Though, I suppose, depending on who it is . . . he may still be dangerous.”
“And you did zap him first,” Ron adds.
summoning assistance. He prays Moony isn’t fighting that evil woman alone.
“Er, not that I’m saying no, but why do you need us?” Harry asks.
Harry nods. “And do you know how the other survivors are holding up?”
“—and she said that maybe Paper Dracon as a person hasn’t really changed. Rather how you saw him. Like, for the most part, you’ve just viewed him as another enemy. But the night you found him in that ditch badly injured, you started empathizing with him. And because of that, you changed how you behaved towards him, which in turn, has changed what side of himself he shows you.”
Harry bites the inside of his cheek, and then lets out a sigh as he lightly rakes a hand across his hair. “Don’t you think I want to know, too? Yeah, they took a lot of heroes’ true identities, and are planning who knows what with them. But . . . it’s just—it’s wrong to just tear off someone’s mask like that. I’d feel wrong. It’d be breaking the Super Code.”
Sudden concern lances through Draco. “Potter—”
No doubt he’s already in the warehouse somewhere, waiting for Harry to show. To trap or to talk to him, Harry still doesn’t know. Part of him doesn’t want to find out, but an even larger part tells him to just rip the bandage off and be done with it.
He’s still thinking of a rebuttal when the clack of shoes on the linoleum unmistakably comes from down the hall. Turning his head slightly, the officer that gave him a difficult time last night enters Harry’s line of sight.
“For you, of course! We’ve covered mostly all your final regrets, except we’ve never managed to get that Seekers’ game right. I mean, what, with you bribing the Snidgets and all. Now, though, them cheating for you is going to be just a bit harder.”
As Harry begins falling through the rubbish chute, he latches onto Dracon’s retreating hand with one of his own. His heels catch on the ground as the rest of his body hovers over the gaping hole. “Wait! Why not go through with it? Isn’t this a betrayal of your organization?”
Twilight reflects off the glass windows of the shops and businesses in the financial district, painting everything a purpling pink with dashes of golden orange. The street lamps start to turn on in the gathering dusk, prepared to replace the dying light with electrical radiance. In this type of setting, Harry loves to just soak in the sense of being connected to the bridge between natural and man-made wonders. His electricity is both a power of nature and power of man, and here he stands, living proof of that. It’s enough to make him breathless.
Paper Dracon doesn’t apologize, and Harry didn’t expect him to. But he does still his movements. “I’m not weak.”
For Paper Dracon, unfortunately, it comes to light that he had been an accomplice in involuntary manslaughter, paired with the abduction of at least six individuals the previous Autumn.
She stares him down for several more moments before relenting and patting the patch of roof beside her. “All right, then.”
“Hmm . . . I remember feeling really tired, but again it was quite the stressful situation.”
Potter’s eyes flash at the challenge, and they’re not kids anymore, but Draco can still get under his skin—and a sick part of him is so
that?! New Boy—” he points at Harry then to himself “—Professional. The difference between you and me,
Harry dodges as Paper Dracon flings some of his paper cranes at Harry. They tilt off course, so Harry doesn’t have to work too hard.
“And I said that’s dangerous! So, you shouldn’t be running anywhere on your own. And especially not to face him alone.”
He doesn’t even turn around. “And why not, officer?”
They stop just outside the viewing range of the mirror hanging on the wall, Potter halting their progress. “What’re you doing, Malfoy?”
There, they found Malfoy pacing like a caged hippogriff—overly proud, yet dignified in agitation. He rounded on them as they stepped from the shadows. “Took you long enough, Po—oh. Hello, Granger.”
Harry hates how gentle her voice sounds. “Yeah, I’m sure. I’m also sure that I now know why he looked so banged up that night I found him.”
“I think you know exactly what.”
“I hear you. It’s just—” Even though the event in question is a month in the past, before any of the other more recent interactions have taken place, Harry can’t help but feel disappointed. “And to top everything off, Justin Finch-Fletchley claims he’s been unable to use his powers since the incident, and whatever happened in that flat’s probably the cause.”
“Oh.” She pulls away and looks down a moment. Then, clasping her hands, Hermione looks up at them with wide eyes. “Don’t wanna wait in line by m’self.”
“I sure hope your day job isn’t as a comedian.”
Harry’s eyes flutter open, and, at first, they don’t recognize what they’re seeing. But after a moment or two adjusting, he realizes he’s looking through what must be eye slits in a mask. And just what his eyes see on the other side of the mask takes his breath away.
Her head cocks at the unfamiliar alias.
“Where are we going? What’s going on?”
“Everyone’s out,” she tells Harry. “Unfortunately, we would all be a hindrance to those fighting. So we’ll hang around the perimeter of the property for one of the Order to escort us out—”
Biting off the protestations on his tongue, Harry allows her to lead him out of the house.
“Insufferable.”
Once Ginny’s collected herself, she puts her arms underneath her brother’s body and works to pull him up.
Draco’s stomach rolls over, and he swallows back the bile. Merlin, does he hate vampires like this. “And did you?” He asks, because apparently his mouth had to sick up something.
Four heroes break off from the group and pair off to heft Harry and Dracon to their feet. Their respective pairs lift Harry and Dracon’s arms across their backs.
“If you died at the Manor, how are you here, Draco?”
Draco lets out a breathless laugh. “Not bad? Well, hopefully you’ll show me the ropes in the months to come.”
“Well, if you’re certain . . . .”
“I know you didn’t mean to, Harry, but you mentioning his hero name to her probably left her really upset. I mean, she must have taken it hard to have been gone for almost three years.”
Their laughter echoed around the trees even after they crossed through the Veil, hand-in-hand, like a memory giving its last haunting whispers before quietly fading away.
“Yes.” The word hisses out from between her lips.
shouldn’t allow flight at all.”
“Wha—” His head whips around to see the
When it became clear Malfoy would add nothing more, Harry felt his right eye twitch. Then an idea struck him. “Wow, Draco. You died in the
He nods vigorously, further agitating his headache.
Then Potter’s standing right there, a hair’s breadth away from Draco. Their chests brush when they breathe, and Draco can
Harry’s eyes rake over his face, taking everything in. From the blond hair to the pointed nose and chin to the little scar on his cheek right below his left grey eye.
“Doesn’t matter now.” Hermione shrugs and appears to focus on the villains before them. “Cover for me.”
Harry walked up to her and laid a bracing hand on her arm. “I’m sure, Hermione. As long as it works as intended.”
“Come with me.” He lowers the hand held to his face and holds it out to Harry instead.
He lifts a gloved hand. “It’s stopped raining.” Shifting his attention to the battlefield below, Dracon stuffs a hand in one of his pockets. “It’s been real fun, hero. But villain duty calls.”
“Is that why you haven’t asked after Dracon?”
Peeking above the wall lining the roof’s edge, Harry can see the three figures much better, and he’s certain that they are the ones maintaining the fire. Even if the three of them hadn’t had their arms raised in the Hero Order’s direction, Blaizing Fire’s mask would have been a dead giveaway.
Finally, Mr. Hendricks moves his gaze from the one-way glass to the old Auror. “My, what happened to you?” Then he blinks at hearing the rough quality in his own voice. He glances down at himself and must see the change in his hands which grip the chair arms they’re chained to—their off-colour tone and long, claw-like nails. “Ah.”
“What was that, Mr. Sulky Sad Ghost?”
“Oh, so sorry, hero, for not
Draco cocks his head and fixes his gaze on a point in the dark, his best guess for where Potter’s eyes would be. “Well,
taking up Harry’s suggestion of taking the older professional heroes off of patrol duty. Now all the younger heroes need to pick up the weekday shifts. Since Harry already missed so much school, the other younger heroes are taking days off for the morning and afternoon patrols—but that leaves Harry his typical night patrols during the only time he has to complete his schoolwork. By Thursday, he has fallen further behind.
sitting up on the trolley and throwing off the sheet.
holding that over my head that I took that threat off the table myself.” The stiff way the villain holds his shoulders tells Harry that decision had been less simple than that.
away from here,” Harry said, pocketing his wand and sinking into the seat vacated by the void-ghost. Considering that ghost had freaked Harry out the most, he was doing a piss poor job of convincing himself his seating choice wasn’t a calculated move of dominance.
“—all bets now placed!” Malfoy was saying as Harry walked in. “Show your cards!”
Alpha Bee, who keeps his mask a simple felt one that wraps around his eyes like a headband, blinks at Harry. “I’m afraid you’ll have to get a little more specific than that, my boy.”
“Would you care to elaborate?” Hermione asks.
Not sure. But if it’s remotely what we suspect it to be, it’ll find us.”
“Now we probably won’t get anything else out of him!”
-have to find out w-what he knows before-before . . . .”
“Yeah.” Harry darts a quick look at the three people on the other side of him, now holding one another. “And preferably before we get anyone near us injured.”
She starts fiddling at the sleeve-cuffs of her Superhero costume. “I don’t know. I hope it doesn’t relate to what we just let slip through our fingers.”
“Ah! Yes, and you all did so well, too.”
After breakfast, Harry'd opened his duffel and took stock of the damage. The puddle water had stained the red fabric and was particularly noticeable on the light gold lightning pattern that spiderwebs its way across the suit. Additionally, He could see many more rips on the uniform in the sunlight than he could in a back alleyway. He’d tossed it in the washer, making a mental note to purchase red and gold thread on his way home so Madam Malkin could fix it when he drops it off. His mask hadn’t been in as bad a shape as the rest of the outfit, despite it needing its own mending; it could still be worn.
“It’s a ghost thing. It’s not really for the living to understand.”
“But I had to see what all that noise was about. And it looked like that boy was really being hur—”
“You’re right on that one. I don’t think we can handle these villains on our own anymore.”
“I’m already disadvantaged because I can’t fly without a broom—”
claps his hands. “Well, I suppose that’s enough for today. I don’t think we’ll be getting anything more from this session. How do you all feel about fish and chips for lunch?”
I’m saying exactly that.”
“Uh-huh. So, he’s of South African descent?”
“So . . .
Together, the three of them Apparated to the gates and snuck into Malfoy Manor like they were precocious twelve-year olds again up to a spot of mischief. They chose the ballroom with tall windows overlooking the grounds and with furniture draped in white cloth as if affirming the manor was now a home only for ghosts. With care, Hermione selected the comfiest chaise lounge of the lot and, with Ron’s assistance, levitated it over to the windows.
“Move!” Harry yells the same time that Ron shouts, “Shit!”
A pink tongue swipes the seam along Potter’s lips. “You know, I may have been thirsty in a different way.”
Laughing lightly at Harry’s grimace, Dracon pulls out the desk chair and sits down. “Now, would you mind closing your eyes for me?”
The sun has completely set, and now Harry only has the light from the streetlamp trickling into the alleyway and his own electrical glow to see what he’s doing. Even so, just slightly feeling the leg causes his stomach to turn.
model. While I’d heard about it, I never really saw one in person. Once Fear-Near started to explain to me what it was after he turned it on and focused its attention on the people I captured . . . I got into an argument with him.”
Harry and Hermione nod, and Ron mumbles a reluctant, “Right.”
“Come along, then.” He waves Harry towards him.
Even though the dragon mask covers his face completely, Harry swears he can feel the sharp glare Dracon sends his way. “Piss off.” He tries again to extricate himself from the rubbish bin, but the strong static pull on his sleeve tugs him right back. “You did this, you prick.”
He blinks behind his lenses.
—or at least
Harry nods, even against the bludgeoning ache in his skull.
True to form, this Snitch wanted a show, and thus revealed itself by rocketing upward right at the epicenter of the circle Harry and Draco made stalking above the gardens. And up it kept climbing as Harry and Draco rushed after it, creating concave curves of ascent for them both.
“I wasn't here. I should have been. Or maybe I should have pressed him harder to come with me when I left.”
“That’s what it sounds like.”
—” she winks at him as she says his Superhero name “—would be returning to patrol next week.”
Cho sucks in a deep breath as she draws back in her chair to fold her arms across her chest. “I still don’t see what this has to do with you letting him go
Hermione sighs and strokes the back of Ron’s head, brown fingers curling in the red tufts. “We know. And the Order. And after three years of working to the bone, a good portion of London, too. Storming down to the station will do us more harm than good.”
Harry pulls back, rage concentrating sparks to his fingertips, even through gloves not made for him. “Will you quit whatever game you’re playing at? People are counting on me to come through with this, and you’re not helping!”
“Well, that was some nice bird walking there. How about we get back to the topic at hand.”
“Thanks. For the help, I mean.” Ginny doesn’t take her eyes from the flickering firelight.
Malfoy, worryingly, didn’t answer right away, just pretended to scuff his shoe along in the dirt.
“Only if you make me.”
Harry reflexively clenches his fist, and one of the remaining lights overhead shatters.
“Is that—” Potter moves his head to squint a bit at Draco. “Is that enough? Information, I mean. It all seemed to come out vague—”
Harry waves her off. “It’s fine. I can do it myself.”
“Well, then what I am I supposed to do? Run home and get my hero costume?”
As he walks down the road, contemplating which bus he should catch to Shoreditch, he eyes the cloth in his hand. It feels sturdy to the touch, but its frayed ends display its vulnerability. If this had been worn by someone while the hostage situation occurred, Harry figures that having Hermione analyze it under a microscope would reveal a bloodstain too dark to see with the naked eye on the black fabric.
After Harry catches his breath, he says, “Let’s head outside anyway. Most of the people have managed to evacuate. No need to stay closed in like this.”
Draco files that information away and tries not to analyse it too hard. At least, not right now—not when they have to spend the next several hours together.
“You think I should go around by
Malfoy rose back up, appearing not altogether there.
“You’re probably right to feel the way you do—because, today, I realized I am. In a way, at least.” Harry releases a breath, and it fogs the air in front of him. “After knocking out the Supervillains maintaining the fire on headquarters, I ran into that villain again. The one I kept letting get away from me. He gave me this, by the way.” Harry lifts a hand to pat at the bandage around his head. “The concussion, I mean. Not the wrap.”
“Then we just have to wait until they’re discharged, which shouldn’t be too long, now—it’s been over two weeks.”
The hoarse bark of laughter that fills the alleyway causes Harry’s hands to twitch. “Please! I control paper—there’s no way I’d just
With renewed vigor in his step, Harry heads for the explosion site.
“Then just get on with it, hero. Please.”
“Damn.” The pocket knife manages to graze Harry on the leg. “Just got this all sewn up last week. Now that’s two rips.” He can tell Ron’s wincing from behind his mask just by the set of his mouth.
Memories and images crowd Harry’s brain, but now he has an idea of how he’s come to be where he is and . . . .
His head turned away from the direction of Dracon’s voice, Harry shuffles back over to the trolley. He lifts the sheet enough to see Paper Dracon’s costume, under-mask, and dragon skull mask on the bottom shelf. Yeah, he was right to assume Dracon stands exposed behind him.
Harry feels split on the matter. He knows they can’t keep being sitting ducks, but just like Hermione had pointed out when the trio discussed the option together, taking such an action without quality information could lead to mutual destruction of both organizations.
“Apparently, he can’t leave,” Ron said.
..........................................
“I believe it was Granger that filed the paperwork, but I’m not sure. I wasn’t in the office when it happened. And,” Draco says with an involuntary twitch of his jaw, “before you get your knickers in a twist, they didn’t exactly
Sighing, Harry says, “I don’t think it matters if we like it or not.”
Looking up Justin’s address is much easier than Harry thinks it should be, considering Finch-Fletchley is an attempted murder victim in a currently open case. But that’s something that
With how Draco’s mood seemed to spiral in the following days, Harry approached his best friends with a dangerous idea—a positively Gryffindorian idea.
There are three flats above the shop—two for tenants and one for the owner. Mr. Eeylops leaves them off at the one on the far end, slipping in more bright-eyed pleasantries before departing.
The hum of the electricity in Harry’s ears is so loud, and he’s closed his eyes at some point to try to block out the blinding light surrounding him. That’s probably why he doesn’t hear Ron again until he’s much closer to Harry than is considered safe.
“Or you’ll ether them again. Yes, I’ve got the message loud and clear, Potty. Are we done here?”
Harry’s pleased to have found the final ace in the deck, and he places it in its fourth separate pile. “But, really, he seemed kind of upset that you gave me your rendezvous point. Got into a whole tussle over it. He’s still injured, by the way. You wouldn’t happen to know who gave those to him? Or that broken leg?”
But Harry surges forward and grabs onto
GarGoyle barks out a laugh.
“Got scared—likely. ‘nd I get it—scary, goin’ ‘gainst someone who’s hurt you, someone who still could. Hap-pens sometimes. Figured th’news could use a pick-me-up—‘membered Ms. Wheeze-ley offered after Wheeze-el punched me, likely outta polite-ness.”
“But at what price,” Harry says before he can stop himself. Since he’s already put his foot into it, he decides to forge ahead. “We’re supposed to be heroes. And while I know there’s some grey area involved where we’ll harm criminals to protect the public or stop their crime, that grey area has to end somewhere before treading into bad territory.”
He raises his hands before himself. “I know. I know how you must be feeling hearing that, but I—”
“Luckily, I figured out it was vulnerable under the metal plating. So, I sent small pieces into the spacing at the joints, cutting the internal wiring. Unfortunately . . . doing so made it explode. I was blown out of the building, and, as hurt as I was, I knew I couldn’t stay there. Fear-Near was nowhere in sight. So, I decided to try for the nearest base up north.”
Ron kicks aside one of the larger stone pieces wriggling on the floor and starts scanning the pews.
Harry sends a lightning strike at Blaizing Fire, but the villain only uses the energy to create a fire shield that cuts the heroes off from the other Supervillains.
Harry attempts to get to his feet but his knees give out halfway.
“First of all, don’t say that with so much contempt,” Harry says, thinking of Neville who works at the local shopping center across from their secondary school to support himself and his Gran. “It's not right to devalue others' work. And second of all, who says you’d need to 'waste your skills'?”
“If you ever interrupt me again, I’ll kill
Despite the chill, Harry still manages to sweat in his hero costume waiting out on the stoop after ringing the bell. He had debated with himself whether he should dress more conspicuously to avoid drawing attention to Finch-Fletchley, but then figured that would be pointless since any enemies Justin had would already know his easily-found address.
Harry waves off her concern. “What happened after? I mean after I passed out? To the arm and our ongoing cases.”
and the young heroes comes to the forefront of Harry’s mind. But as he stares at Dracon’s white mask and his shaking hands, he can’t honestly say it’s to extort information out of him. The odd feeling fluttering in Harry’s chest that’s so familiar brings the truth to his lips. “I care.”
“I don’t know what to think until we get there. But by the force of that mini-earthquake we felt at the bookstore, I’m betting it isn’t going to be pretty.”
“I can’t believe you let him get away!” Hermione paces in front of Harry in the observation room. “After Blaizing Fire actually gave you a lead!”
“Yeah, well, we should probably plan for if it turns out to be one.”
“But it wasn’t one
“Ron!”
With more willpower than should be necessary, Harry pries his gaze from the villain’s shadowed eye slits and starts a painful crawl toward Ginny.
“Say . . . .” The man’s not looking at Harry when he twists around to face him. “Are you really a hero?”
He was rewarded by a small smile from Draco. “Yeah. Right, then,” Draco said. “Ready to get your arse kicked, Potter?”
“Come on. We have to get out of here. It’ll only get worse the longer we stay.” Dracon takes a step forward and stumbles.
Gaining a second wind, Alpha Bee bounces on the balls of his feet and steeples his fingers below his chin. “I’m glad you asked,
Even so, most of the heroes agree this game cannot continue the way it has, where only one side plays the cat and the other the mouse. Alpha Bee has been steadily trying to calm a rising revolt in the ranks of the heroes who want to take direct action against the Villain Agency the way in which the Agency has targeted the Hero Order.
“Well, I heard they brought him in while he was still unconscious,” Hermione says from Harry’s other side. “So, it’s doubtful he even knows what part of London he’s in.”
“And where was his partner during all of this?”
“So then, doesn’t that mean he would have to work regardless of his state?”
’s fingers are steepled beneath his chin. “You really should have brought him in.”
Hermione nods, a frown on her face.
......................................................
As Harry positioned himself to do the same, his hand, braced against the ground, touched where Draco had been moments before. He nearly yanked his hand back in shock as he found the ground completely dry. Ice flooded Harry’s veins and caused his bones to ache at the realization that, dead as Draco was, the living world no longer felt the imprint of his soul. That some truth lay in the claim that Draco no longer belonged here.
“Maybe. If they were searching for a body.”
However, just as he gets a view of the interrogation table’s far corner, a hero steps in his path. “Wotcher,
“You should be careful not to confuse the two.”
Mrs. Weasley is delighted to have him sitting at her kitchen table rather than holed up in one of her guest rooms, not allowed visitors. She hums and coos over him, muttering about how “the poor dear’s gone through so much,” and “what a poor little sausage, getting a concussion!”
If he noticed Draco’s hungry gaze, he’s mercifully silent as Draco slips away.
Caught up as he is by his own thoughts, it’s hard to miss the sound of the door opening and closing. Deciding that tailing the person who just left makes for better use of his time than tormenting himself with his regrets, Harry slides out of bed and sneaks out after them. In the dim light of the hallway, he catches a glimpse of a bare foot heading up the stairs to the roof. Wrapping his blanket tighter around himself, Harry follows.
“Of the case?” Potter’s words sound like they’re punched out of him.
“You call it shite.”
Potter’s Adam’s Apple bobs as he swallows.
They crowd around and are shocked to discover an encasement of glass separates their curious hands and the evidence. But none of them need to touch it—at least not yet. Its appearance speaks enough for itself.
Something twists in Harry’s gut, but he should have learned by now that distraction this close to an enemy is a deadly mistake. He’s not prepared for the flurry of little paper cranes Dracon sends his way, and Harry’s close enough that when they catch on fire, he still has to work to dodge the flames.
“C’mon, Harry.” Ron held up the bag of remains. “Got to get this to the Ministry for proper inspection.”
Harry walked over to him and drew him into a hug. “Yeah, I am.”
He finally looks at Harry, peering at him through narrow eyes. “But
down to two. Those would have been worse.”
to try to start something with him now? Part of Harry thinks it’s unfair that Draco came to him today to do this; though, in a way he understands it’s his way of building up courage for tomorrow.
It’s been four days since he lost the card match against Blaizing Fire. The more Harry thinks back on the game, the more he’s certain the cheating bastard had somehow pinched some cards up the white sleeves of his borrowed shirt when he’d leaned over the table. There’s no other way he would have had one full house, two royal flushes, and three four-of-a-kind like he got. If Harry had been more himself, he might have been able to catch him in the act.
Cautiously, Draco probed at the spot, wonder flickering across his face as his chest didn’t give way to his ministrations. “Thank you,” he said into the stillness around them. “Thank you, Harry.”
on his back and like heaven in his hair, and Potter
afterlife worthwhile.”
Since Harry has managed to identify most of the Supers on the battleground, that just leaves two conspicuous figures having at it on the last crumbling staircase. He leads Dracon towards the two people having the strangest battle—one keeps flopping to the ground or against the railing, while the other will occasionally claw at his own throat.
. Despite nearly three years having passed since Harry’s hero debut, he still recognizes that lettering.
The glass awning entrance of Whittington Hospital comes into view, and Harry drops down from the house roof. Looking both ways, he crosses the street and strides across the cobbled entryway, passing the wall with “Whittington Health” embossed on its surface.
in a mirror and not myself—never myself—”
“Maybe they’re not in,” Potter says from his perch several steps down.
Stroking his beard,
“What the
“Yeah, plus helping out a villain?” Ron snorts. “I’m a hero myself, and I hardly believe that one. Couldn’t’ve expected
hero.”
Harry freezes.
Walking over to Dracon, who is bent over with hands on his knees, Harry pats him on the back and quietly thanks him for his help. The two of them speculate on who should go over and check for a pulse. As much as they wanted to defeat Voldemort, they hadn’t aimed to kill him. The high voltage but low current rate throughout the bird declared as much.
When Dracon reaches for his arm again, Harry doesn’t pull away. Instead, he allows the villain to lead him along the crate to its edge where they both hop on a paper swan Dracon pulls from his pocket.
Ron snorts, but it’s not as joyful as Harry’s used to hearing from his friend.
Gathering Fire’s coat tighter around him, Harry walks back out into the hallway, whips out the notepad and pen in his pocket, and, against the wall, scribbles:
“Every choice we make determines who we are.” He starts to wonder if holding the fabric too tightly would result in new rips and loosens his hold a little more. “I mean, come on. Haven’t you ever had a dream? Something to strive for that’s different from where you’re at? Something to prove everyone else wrong about? What keeps you going every day?”
Instead, Harry decides to face Voldemort who stands closest to the door.
“Why, we haven’t seen you around here in forever and a day. We were starting to think you’d forgotten about this Hospital. Isn’t that right, Alastor?”
As he hears what Harry says, the muscles in the villain’s arms and legs do an odd, twitchy spasm, disrupting his preening pose. “I beg your pardon?” Now, he shifts so that his hands are placed on his hips and he leans toward Harry.
Dracon tugs his good leg up to his chest and wraps his arms around it. “Have at it.”
“Yes. It reminds me to be grateful I’m dead so I don’t have to taste it in full.”
“Don’t go losing sleep over your enemy, hero.”
After extracting himself from his friends’ embrace, Harry sat down on the chaise, taking in the sweeping gaze of the moon as the shifting clouds in the sky broadened its touch on the gardens. When Hermione handed Harry a vial of the cerulean liquid, he wondered over how his friends had only asked him if he was sure and not whether he was afraid. But perhaps, unlike the countless fans that asked for his autograph or fawned over the idea of him, they actually knew the answer. He spared them both a final glance before returning his focus to the sprawl of trees beyond the window and downed the whole vial in a single gulp.
“He’s not—we’re not—”
Draco just watches him, not writing anything down.

“I mean, you sure you want me to do it?”
“Er, not really. See, I took Her-
Potter grabs hold of his other wrist. Then they stand there for an undetermined amount of time, just staring at their linked limbs. And Potter’s still so far away.
The villain lifts the note and reads it as Harry pulls the two masks over his own head—the copy under-mask Hermione made having dissolved when
“Sorry,” Draco says, taking a step back. In the dim light of the attic, he watches the wand stay trained on him for the next long stretch of silence before finally lowering.
“—fair,” Harry interrupts. “I’ll be sure to put a good word in when I’m called to testify.”
Hardly believing his luck, Harry merely holds the first aid kit aloft.
Luna and Ginny appear to be handling their battle against
you both came with me!”
“How about you continue thinking on it, and I’ll get back to you when I’m next on patrol here?”
Harry’s hands itch. He squeezes them into fists and tears his gaze away from the figure—back toward Alpha Bee, who is lifting a folder from its place on the counter that stretches the length of the glass.
“Ah, thank you.” She blows Ron a kiss, pats Harry on the shoulder, and heads outside the kitchen.

“Well, good work, anyway, mate.” Ron strides forward and pats Harry on the back. “You got some good information.”
“Mostly grazed me and a few of the others. But that must have been when one or two of the other hostages died.”
“I don’t know.” Hermione’s hands squeeze together in her lap atop her book. “We’ll have to wait and see what kind of counter plan Alpha Bee or the other older heroes come up with.”
“Come again?”
well enough.
For their part, Potter and Draco get their share of wary looks—Draco for his history with Dark Arts and Potter for his unsettling attire. At least the two of them are less likely of getting jumped than Potter seems to fear.
“All right. Okay. Stopping.”

.” Never did Draco anticipate this conversation veering into a semantics lesson with Potter. “Since you never really reported the incident yourself, we don’t even know if your... experience reflects any other incidents we have on file—whether this is a new vampiric perpetrator or any of the other serial biter cases we’ve been working on. For that, we would
Harry takes the villain up on the offer and tracks Dracon’s gloved hand as it withdraws the flat square piece.
“Not quite,” Harry says. “Just as he was leaving today, he basically told me he attempted petty theft so as to pay for treatment for the broken leg. Which also means he openly admitted that the Agency isn’t helping him out either. Or that he’s somehow got knocked off the payment rosters or had his accounts frozen so that he couldn’t pay with what money he already has.”
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked as they began their long freefall back to Earth. “This was supposed to be your last regret. Should I have let you win? Did I do this all wrong?”
Once out in the corridor, he stands before the entrance to the interrogation room, key clutched in one hand and the pack of cards in the other. The sense of déjà vu nearly makes him dizzy.

“Well, he didn’t come in after us to help his mates, did he?” Ron scratches his chin. “Maybe a policeman got him.”
now?”
But the villains start to mumble and shout in alarm too.
“Looks can be deceiving,” Draco mutters under his breath. Especially in the magical world.
“How in the hell did you manage to throw a car at us?” Ron’s stalling—Harry knows this and tries to angle himself better.
The villain’s head lolls back on his shoulders. “A useless villain makes for a dead pawn.”
can’t—do something like that and still claim to be on the side of justice. Even if this is a villain, Harry can’t seem to shake the spark of shame that mingles with the excitement and anticipation at the idea of seeing the face behind the mask. Even if, by chance, the Supervillain before them is Paper Dracon.
Little wonder such a beautiful place had not been suspected for harboring some of the most dangerous criminals Britain has ever seen.
The hole made by the explosion is smaller than one would have thought, given the amount of smoke that had billowed out last night. It only takes up three flats in width, and, lengthwise, the damage seems contained relatively to one level of flats, with the exception of parts of the flats above and below having gotten caught up in the chaos.
“I wanted some ice cream, Potter, just as anyone who’d spent their childhood begging by the window would. Stop overanalysing it, could you?” Draco takes a scoopful and shoves it in his mouth, his eyes fluttering shut. When he opens them a few seconds later, Potter still hasn’t touched his. “Like I said, it was a stressful day for both of us. Overwhelming at times. We both deserve a treat to unwind, all right?”
“No.”
“Of course! It’s just . . . . We were together to aid one another. Keep one another alive. He kept me alive, but I couldn’t . . . .” Moonlight trickles into the slits in her mask and Harry can see close her eyes. “I never wanted him to die for me.”
“No bringing other people into the fun? I suppose I can cope with that. But, Potter, give up your cooking? Why, I’d die again without it!” He batted his lashes at Harry.
Nurse Tonks blinks. “Like a voice enhancer? The kind they use in anonymous interviews?”
Ron makes to rush the table, but Harry catches hold of his sleeve, remembering to lower his voltage upon doing so to prevent Ron from shocked.
Harry’s skin prickles while he collects the articles into his arms, certain that he can feel a set of eyes riveted to his back.
Shaking himself from his stupor, Draco takes the opportunity to create a sketch of the suspected bartender. He uses his Ministry-allocated Swift Sketch Quill to draft as accurate an image as possible to the one Ms. Adams describes.
“Ah, I do, do I?” Harry taps at his chin. “Then to repay her ladyship and her lovely comrades, please,” he ducks his head again, “allow me to walk you home.”
“Why? Because he was involved in the kind of activity he has participated in for the entirety of your acquaintanceship?” Ron flops down onto his back. “Look. Hermione and I have been talking this whole thing over—”
"So, you found where the thieves were hiding out?"
, really. And, it would be... irresponsible? Of me as an Auror in-training to just, let that—that monster go after someone else.”
He’s turning his teacup full of cold tea around its saucer for the fiftieth time when Potter’s shadow in the doorway cuts out the light from the hall. Before Draco can fully take him in, Potter waves his wand and snuffs out most of the candles in the room, only leaving a few lit.
“Well, you didn’t bring him into the police either,
“Didn’t quite catch that, mate.”
’s poisoned dart feathers. All of them had struck him directly. He’d died instantly.
“It’s fine. Harry and I’ve got this. You’ve waited all week, and probably longer, for this book,” Ron says.
With speed, Potter ducks away before she can put her arms around him and holds his hands up in a warding-off position.
“Er-What?”
Her cell makes little
and places it on Fire’s bare chest laced with its own scars.
“About time.” Harry holds out the cracked dragon skull mask to him.
“Woke him up?”
When it’s Harry’s turn to go, the two heroes aiding him release Harry's arms. He still sways on his feet, but he doesn’t fall. A part of him says that he should be one of the last ones out considering this is his rescue mission to see through; however, another part argues to go now, since Paper Dracon already went and is out there. Plus, from the looks of it, the heroine that took charge of the group seems set to be the last one out. He can respect that.
Harry smirks, but doesn’t try talking in his breathless state.
At Harry’s silence, Hermione said, “Oh, Harry. I know you’re attached to him—”
“Poppy, his was one of the identities stolen. How else would they know which house to attack?”
in the torso with it.
Regardless, Harry can feel his suit beginning to give way under the barrage—not to mention the little bits scraping along inside his mouth.
Opening his eyes once again, Harry sits down cross-legged and considers the prone body.
“That’s rough, mate. Can’t imagine how twitchy you must be getting while everything happens.”
Harry gives a hesitant nod. “Sort of. It gives a robot-like feel to my voice, yeah?”
Harry gathers together the pieces he finds, careful not to actually touch any more than the one caught in his hand. They barely amount to a handful, but, even as he sits there analyzing them, another piece flutters by his head.
Draco shook his head, his hand rippling against the invisible barrier that kept him trapped. “I know.”
He takes it and moves to affix it in place on his head over the under-mask. “I don’t know why you’d help me. Or why you’d risk Voldemort’s ire. You’re either incredibly daft, or you’re barking. Haven’t figured out which, yet.”
But that’s not all that Hermione’s page of words has provided. Little jolts of electricity jump through the moisturized air, easy enough for Harry to just reach out and grab hold of them with his power should he have the need. He feels his tensed shoulders relax at not having to expend much more energy from his own body.
“You . . . You don’t have to explain it to me. If the memory’s too painful.”
He gives the old hero a weak smile.
The door swings open in three minutes, Tracey Davis standing there in jeans and a Wimbleton pullover. “Who are you, really? Who do you work for?”
It’s not like Harry can complain, either. This was his idea. Or at least part of it. Hermione had been the one to suggest temporary contacts that make his eyes itch instead of wearing glasses that could easily fall off and blind him. (“They’re not attached to your head, Harry, like the tinted lenses on your mask!”) Of course, Harry had asked why not add a pair to the mask’s design like she had the time he impersonated Blaizing Fire, to which she’d said that it would be too dangerous to alter the design of the under-mask without the identification mask covering it.
Even with his powers blocked out by Ron, Vice-Net still throws the objects in Ron’s direction. They’re not as accurate as they would be if he still had his powers, but they come close enough to Ron that he has to dodge and drop his hand.
“Yup.” The officer rocks on his feet. “Best to not keep wasting your time here. Or do. Doesn’t matter to me. But know you’re not getting in to see those patients.”
Mr. Park looks down. “So?”
There were a number of things to say crowding at the tip of Harry’s tongue, but a greeting wasn’t one of them. Instead, Harry settled for: “Where the fuck did
“Fuck,” Harry and Malfoy swore simultaneously, but Malfoy more vehemently. His two peachicks
Draco lets his hand drop. “Yes. Happy Christmas to you.”
“Hmm... felt bad, I guess. About you being dead.”
“Oh, yes, a vampire victim would be out and about during—” Draco bites his tongue. He doesn’t need to turn around or for Potter to uncover himself in order to
Harry glances down, eyeing the long, jagged, washed-out scars crisscrossing his dark skin. They stretch down his whole body—fingers, toes, and all—from the source scar marring his forehead. By the time he wakes in the morning, they’ll have receded until nothing but the original remains. They’ll stay away until the next time he calls on his power—which would very likely be tomorrow’s patrol.

The childish urge to call out “it’s mine!” died on Harry’s lips as he locked eyes with Draco’s overbright ones.
, having summoned plenty of wolves to help him out beforehand.
“I know, Hermione.” He finally shifts his eyes toward her, his hazel meeting her brown ones. “Don’t you think I want to be out on patrol, too, instead of staying in here, taking forever to recuperate?”
Harry bobs his head, tucking into his treacle tart.
Hermione sniffs and glances away. “We should probably wait until
—of person the vampire went after.”
Dracon’s voice startles Harry back to his senses—or the most they can be in this hazy daze.
Draco hesitates before his drunk brain makes a sudden decision. He reaches out to Potter, holding off long enough for Potter to pull away, before latching onto his robe sleeve. Then he tugs Potter along to the sitting room—which, to his surprise, is empty. Though, a glance at the clock on the wall explains the family's absence as it’s well into the early hours of Christmas Day. When the pair enter the room, the music coming from the Wireless becomes more audible, and Draco realises it's not even Christmas music playing.
“And you passed out?” Ron asks.
The moisture from the mist seeps into the paper birds flitting around Harry and Ron.
She floods one robot’s internal circuits after another with water spouting from a burst pipe. Against the mechanical monsters that seem to be playing tug-of-war with her over control of the water, she takes them down next. One by one, she causes them to explode. Evidently, whatever upgrades the Agency gave the robots, they certainly didn’t make them Cho-proof.
“Sorry, Harry. You’ll have to do that on your own. I
Ron’s busy wrestling off his hero costume, having just come in from evening patrol. “Well, go on ahead and open it, already. I didn’t go out of my way to sneak it up here for you to just ogle it.”
Harry bites the inside of his cheek and fights off the helpless feeling rising in his gut. “Stop you, of course.”
“You probably didn’t know that.”
Paper Dracon’s hand freezes in the air. “What do you mean by ‘what do I mean’?”
“Oh, I imagine. He was probably hoping to trade in one potential informant for another.”
“Pop some bubbly?”
“Yes. I hope you’ve been recovering well from the incident from almost a month ago?”
purses her equally pink-painted lips. “I don’t know, Izulu. Didn’t you already give it a go with your mates and not have much luck? And you don’t seem to be in a good condition to be interrogating anyone since you haven’t got your breath back from your walk here.”
“Let me in to see the villain.”
The woman that accepted Harry’s note leads them.  She takes a few seconds to glance around—ostensibly for any guards—and spots the two of the them collapsed on the floor. Snapping her fingers twice, she then points at Harry and Dracon.
The nurse with the brown hair looks up from her computer when she hears his approach. “
Crackling echoes around him as every last bit of whatever Dracon had attacked him with either turns to dust or catches fire. Harry’s eyes shoot open to see the last flurries of paper scraps burn in front of him.
Finally, Harry breathes out, “Ron and I’ll go check it out. You can stay here in line.”
Ron chuckles a little. “We know, Hermione. You’ve only told us the entire morning.”
Refocusing back on the conversation, Harry realizes he’s been lost in thought for more time than he’d thought.
