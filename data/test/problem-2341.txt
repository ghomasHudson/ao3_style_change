Draco gestured at Potter’s head with his glass, trying not to grin. “Like that. The way you tilt your head to the side when you’re talking.”
“So, was Mr Hunter your last relationship?” he asked instead, once more picking up his quill and pulling his folder towards himself. He wasn’t sure how much longer he could handle this line of questioning. Draco knew he was a part of Harry's history, but the knowledge that he wasn't the
“You know how I feel about small talk, Potter,” Draco mumbled, smirking at him from behind his mug. “But yes, it’s bloody freezing.”
Draco hummed lazily in response. His arse did feel a little sore, but it wasn’t anything close to unbearable. “Worth it.”
“I don’t think I ever said I had low self-esteem, Malfoy,” Harry argued. “Just a shitty upbringing."
“And why, pray tell, should I be civil to the arsehole who fought against me in a war, held me prisoner in his house, and called my fiancee a mudblood?” Ron spat.
“Harry,” Draco said, briefly gripping Harry’s stubbly chin in his fingers. “I love so many things about you, but one of my favorites is that you’re a completely horrible liar.”
“Mmm, yes, more Draco time,” Harry murmured. “I’ll stop at home first tomorrow, then, and grab some clothes and things.”
“You were a couple?” Harry demanded. He knew his voice sounded too quiet to be casual. “You and that fucking thug?”
“And what else do you think, Harry?” he asked, covering his full mouth with his hand as he spoke. Damn, that was a bloody delicious cheese toastie.
What was wrong with him? Why did Potter make him feel so erratic? In a matter of hours he had experienced more emotions than he had in the past three years put together; his head was spinning with them, and he didn’t know what to do anymore. All he knew was that, though distance was probably the wisest choice, he didn’t want distance. He wanted Harry beside him, on top of him, underneath him, inside him. Draco still couldn’t fathom how he could feel so strongly about his former enemy in a matter of hours. It made him feel intoxicated.
“Well, you’ve obviously changed,” she told him, running her fingers lazily through Rose’s ginger hair. “Perhaps people see that.”
“If you wanted to give it a go right now, I can leave the room,” Harry joked, guzzling down the tail end of his butterbeer with a grin.
Harry walked through the kitchen doorway, hair still wet, wearing the same pair of fitted jeans he had worn all night… and nothing else. The jeans hung low on his hips, as he had forgone the belt he’d worn the previous night. Draco knew his mouth was gaping but he didn’t care. A shirtless Potter was a force to be reckoned with.
“I thought I heard you two chattering in here,” she said with a smile. “Was it getting too cold outside?”
For a minute, Draco allowed Harry some time to pace back and forth and stew in his anger. While Draco was moved (and slightly aroused, if he was honest) by Harry's protectiveness, there was something rather fascinating about his silence, as well. Draco had always enjoyed trying to decipher what he was saying when he didn’t use words, and at that moment, his body was screaming as loudly as ever.
Harry pulled Draco forward by his arms so that he was sitting up, and suddenly Harry was yanking his jumper up. Draco happily let him, shimmying his wrists out of the sleeves and automatically, out of habit, running a hand over his hair to tame it once Harry had removed his jumper.
There was a slight weariness in Potter’s green eyes, as if the years of continual trauma had finally taken its toll on him. He had an aggressive five o’clock shadow and a slight suspicion in his features. Somehow all of this, to Draco’s dismay, only made his face all the more engrossing.
Harry nodded. “Different, in a really good way, where it counts. But you’re still very much Draco, in all the other ways.”
More than just physically, though, Harry became someone different up here, someone self-assured and commanding. Granted, Draco loved that Harry wasn’t always assertive and confident, that he was modest and a little bit unsure; it was part of what made him so utterly charming and easy to be around. But he also liked seeing Harry like this, like he owned the world. It brought him back to simpler times, when things were black and white. And, frankly, it was a bit of a turn-on.
“That’s not what I’m suggesting,” Harry said, chuckling softly. He buried his lips in Draco’s hair and kissed his head again and again.
He’d missed that smile. He’d missed all of him, really, even the longsuffering sighs, the eye rolls, the snide remarks… every single part. Now that they were in the same space again, all Harry wanted to do was watch him.
Draco felt those familiar snitches in his throat. Really, they were taking over his entire body. It would never do.
“Harry said that as well,” Draco murmured absently. “Called you his brother, that is. Just last night.”
“The Healers explained how fortunate it was that I’d been admitted so soon, as a cephalia curse needs to be treated within a few minutes. If it’s not, the symptoms can be quite severe. In extreme cases, it results in a prolonged coma.”
“Oh fuck you,” Harry grumbled, fighting off a laugh. “Of course you’re going to hold the other night against me.”
Draco’s entire right side was still buzzing when he turned around at last and made his way back to the kitchen table. He avoided Harry’s gaze, but he could feel it like fire on his skin.
“And flirting as well, that’s still fine,” Draco murmured. “I mean, I like it. Not that I’m much good at it, obviously.”
“Fucking jerk me off, Potter, I’m begging you,” Draco grunted out, and Harry’s hand was on his cock, wrapped around him in a tight and glorious grasp.
Draco lifted his eyebrows in surprise. Potter was notoriously private these days, almost to the point of being reclusive, and a full-blown interview was an incredibly rare occurrence. In fact, as far as Draco was aware, he’d only given two in his whole life.
Harry just shook his head, looking more than a little dazed, and moved his hands so that they rested on Draco’s thighs.
“Because your boyfriend is hungry,” Harry responded bluntly, pulling away with a smile and walking over to the fridge.
“Webster?” Malfoy repeated, confusion written plainly in his sharp features. “Frankly, now I’m not only questioning who on earth you are, I’m also questioning your sanity.”
He made his way into the warm kitchen, his body numb and stiff, and Harry followed close behind him, radiating tension. Draco began shuffling through Harry’s cupboards in a daze, using his wand to fix himself a cup of tea. Harry plopped himself down on a kitchen chair, nonplussed, watching him. At least his silence made it slightly easier for Draco to keep calm... just as long as he avoided Harry’s bewildered, searching gaze.
Draco huffed. “Look, I apologize for what I said. You’re right, I was being a knob, and I know it. I’m sorry.”
Harry went still for a moment, and Draco felt Harry’s arms stiffen a little around his waist, as if he was afraid he had overstepped and might scare Draco off. After all, Draco had, admittedly, been a little up and down with his feelings last night. But only a little, of course.
Harry grinned. It was easier to make light of the situation than to delve into things this soon. “Since you asked me to dinner.”
“I’m sorry, Harry, let me try again,” Draco said softly. “Sometimes I’m wholly unprepared for how wonderful you are. And, honestly, I was a little distracted by the mention of you with no clothes on.”
. How had he never appreciated those striking green eyes before? Not that it made any difference, of course. He was still Harry Potter.
Draco wasn’t terribly surprised at his impulse to touch Harry just then, to go over to him and sit beside him and comfort him, but he resisted in the name of keeping his feelings under control. Merlin, he hated to see Harry so upset.
“On the other hand, no lawsuits would make for a hell of a lot less paperwork on my part,” she said with a shrug.
“We are,” she agreed. “It’s not all sunshine and rainbows, of course, but the challenges are what bring us closer together, I think.”
Harry picked up his wand once the questions had ceased for a moment and levitated the tea pot over to the table, pouring Draco another cup without being asked. Draco tapped the end of his quill against his bottom lip and surveyed his plentiful notes.
“Would you like me to put a shirt on?” Harry asked, smiling over his shoulder at Draco as he placed several pieces of toast onto each plate.
Harry took off his glasses and wearily pinched the bridge of his nose. “Is it weird that I never talk about him?”
“He also told me he couldn’t be as candid as we wanted him to,” Rosalind continued, “unless it was with someone with whom he already had a history.”
“It’s certainly not my fault that you parade yourself around like a peacock for all the world to ogle at!” Draco spat, blushing furiously now.
“Right,” he said, and he made his way through the newsroom once again, an unfamiliar and altogether pleasant spring in his step. He was sure people glared at him, but he hardly noticed.
Harry didn’t exactly have a clear answer to that question, but he supposed he knew the most obvious reason.
They were silent for a moment when Draco noticed that a glass of firewhiskey sat before him. He fought back a smirk and unclenched his fist to pick it up.
“Use a napkin, you bloody heathen,” Draco said, grabbing one and placing it thoughtlessly into Harry’s hand, curling Harry’s fingers around the napkin as if he was a child. Draco was embarrassed by this oddly possessive display, but when he looked up at Harry, he was smiling like a sunrise.
Merlin... he was so close that Harry's head was spinning. Harry breathed out something that sounded like a laugh and leaned in even closer.
“Fine. Productive,” Draco replied, stepping into the house with steady grace. “I trust you had a pleasant trip to Wales?”
“Must’ve happened within the last couple of weeks; I just overheard them mentioning it." He fiddled with his wand and sighed again. "It’s a secret.”
“No, it’s fine,” Harry said with a smile, because somehow, it was. “The name itself really doesn’t mean anything, either, so that’s not much of a clue, on its own. Maybe you’re right that I was only named for my out-of-control hair. That’d be pretty funny, I reckon.”
“And you’re arrogant and self-involved,” Harry teased, “but something about you… leaves an impression.”
What was Harry? Of all the many things they had said to each other yesterday, they hadn’t really asked that question, let alone come up with a clear-cut answer to it.
Harry looked up at him incredulously. “Are we really about to have the relationship talk right now?”
Harry finally graced him with the smallest of smiles, and Draco felt a weight flying off his shoulders. Maybe this would turn out alright.
Harry just kept smiling expectantly at him, and when Draco remained silent, his cocky expression suddenly turned into bashfulness. When Harry began chewing his lip, Draco instantly disregarded every single reason why he shouldn’t answer him.
“I guess I’ll be going, then,” Harry said, mustering up a gallant smile that Draco knew he didn’t deserve.
Draco stared at him for a long time, and then he nodded. He tapped his quill against his lip--fuck, it was so distracting when he did that. Draco had the nicest lips.
“Well… We slept together exactly twice, but apparently that was enough to warrant giving Witch Weekly a few very telling comments about me, and our sex life, most of which were blatantly made up.”
“It’s gonna be weird not seeing you all week,” Harry said. Draco could tell he was trying to say it casually, but it came out exceedingly soft, and Draco’s heart was instantly in shambles.
“You’re my problem, Potter, as usual!” Draco spouted, leaning forward as well, bizarrely overjoyed that Potter had taken the bait. Arguing with him was at least something Draco could make sense of. “I would appreciate it if you’d be respectful enough to show up on time for our meetings from here on in, if that’s not too much to demand of the Chosen One!”
. The way he felt, gazing into Harry’s green eyes as the fire danced against his cheek… Draco couldn’t for the life of him remember how it felt
Draco lifted his eyebrow dubiously, fighting to remain in control of himself, even though hearing Harry say ‘on my best behavior’ was enough to reactivate all of Draco’s kinkiest fantasies.
Again Draco felt himself shifting further towards him, a bit startled that Harry had pegged his thoughts so easily. “Yes, you are.”
“I was admittedly a little prat with a lot of deeply ingrained insecurities, alright?” Draco murmured.
“A pretty genius,” Harry said under his breath, twirling his wand distractedly in his hand, and Draco’s face split open in a grin. Is that what Harry thought of him? He could certainly live with that.
Draco smiled to himself at the concern in Harry’s voice and leaned over to kiss his nipple. “I feel much better than okay. You?”
Harry felt his heart melting a little inside his chest. He could tell that Draco found it difficult to admit that; his eyes remained glued to his portfolio.
With one last deep breath, Draco approached the front door, which opened wide. Draco stepped inside and looked down to see one of the house elves, Grimby, apparently waiting for him.
“Oh,” Harry said. Obviously not information about their pregnancy, though, Harry thought sullenly. “Right.”
“Because I want you to be my husband,” he explained matter-of-factly. “And I really want to be your husband, too.”
Draco gave him a tight smile and straightened his tie once again. “If you must know, this morning I was listening to that unusual muggle band that you like so much. Research purposes, of course. Roger Waters was still floating around my mind, I suppose.”
“But whatever this is,” Harry continued softly, “it was never going to just be a one-and-done for me. You mean more to me than that now, and I know this is all so, so,
“Yeah, I owled them this morning,” Harry said. “While you were styling your hair. Could’ve written them a novel.”
The words hit their intended target, and Draco cringed in humiliation, pain seeping through him like poison. But, with plenty of practice on his side, he successfully avoided taking the bait. He had precious few allies in this office (which had more than its fair share of insufferable gits), but, luckily for Draco, it was universally agreed upon that Alex in particular was an awful prick. Draco certainly knew that better than anyone. Quarelling with him simply wasn’t worth it. He shook off the momentary degradation and walked to his cubicle with all the dignity he could muster.
When the lift opened at precisely noon and the first thing Harry saw was Draco’s angelic halo of blonde hair, he practically swooned.
he wanted to scream. Before either of them could say anything else, however, Hermione stepped through the Floo, smiling widely as she shook out her curly hair.
Harry had taken two steps before he noticed Draco had stopped walking, and he turned around to stare at Draco uncertainly.
“Hey, you wanna hold her for a bit?” he asked Draco, though he was already setting her down carefully in Draco’s lap.
Draco sighed. Evidently, Harry became extra flirtatious when he was tired, and Draco made a mental note of that. For no reason, obviously.
“Torture him, Draco,” he had said, his icy voice sending chills through Draco’s veins. “It’s what you’re best at.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, blushing slightly. “I take lots of long walks, think a lot, write in my journal, observe the world around me. I like to just kind of… be. It’s nice not to have an end goal sometimes for a change. I know, very unlike me.”
messy,” Draco muttered, more to himself than to Harry. He conjured a glass and filled it with water, placing it on the nightstand before he took a step backwards.
He didn’t dare look over at Draco, but Harry could hear his breath shortening, feel the warmth of him through his jeans. Harry cleared his throat, his mouth dry once again, and allowed himself to surrender to the feeling. He leaned ever so slightly closer, needing to be nearer to Draco, as near as he could. When their shoulders touched, Harry was convinced that he would never move again.
“I knew she would be the easier of the two, of course,” Draco muttered. “Father merely disowned me on the spot and left the room. I didn’t see him again afterward. Well, I suppose he did make it quite easy, all things considered; he could have smashed things and screamed, as you said.”
And with that, Draco spun on his heel, stomped into the kitchen, flung open the back door, and trod down the short pathway into his tiny garden. He kept walking until he was at the very end of the yard, with nowhere to go but headlong into the hedgerow.
“Look sharp, Draco,” Dumbledore had said, blue eyes twinkling behind those half-moon spectacles. “Someone’s here to see you.”
Harry leaned back and watched him for a moment as he slowly traced a finger over the lion on his teacup. He could almost feel Draco’s confidence waning, and Harry was surprised to find that he hated to see it go.
“Long story,” Harry explained, nudging Draco’s arm, this time not bothering to be subtle about it. Draco smiled at him; maybe they really were teammates.
Anyway, side note, please be patient with me over the next few weeks, because struggling through this chapter made me realize that I need to ignore my posting schedule and just write at a less stressful pace, because I am burning out fast. I want to make sure that I put enough time and effort into the last couple chapters and not rush things, y’know? So if the posts come later than you’re expecting, please don’t curse my name or wish me ill lol. I promise I am still going to be working on this daily. And fyi, there probably won’t be any more dramatic cliffhangers either haha. (Again, sorry! :S)
Harry smiled gently, his face still full of sleep, and he immediately touched Draco’s face, conveniently with the hand that was still on the pillow, rather than the one on Draco’s… well.
Draco forced himself to take a calming breath as he remembered the way he had observed Potter in school. Everything he did, everything he said, every mannerism, every habit. Draco’s friends had all quickly grown tired of what they called his “Potter Obsession,” but Draco could not help himself. Something about Potter had always drawn him in.
Reality was still seeping in in bits and pieces like the sunlight streaming through the window. Draco’s smile grew, a warmth spreading up through his belly as he realized, in this instance at least, that he quite preferred reality to dreams. He counted to five and breathed deeply to the beat of Harry’s snores before gingerly turning from his left side to his right.
Well, with any luck, Malfoy would take his coffee to go, and Harry would have the place to himself again. But then, Harry had no luck, so it really shouldn’t have taken him by surprise to see a shadow falling across the table a minute later.
Ron nodded. “And you didn’t… coerce him or something? No potions, no spells, no evil luring? You swear?”
Harry stood up when his beer was finished and took the two steps across the room to where Draco was sitting. He patiently waited for Draco to finish as well, raising an eyebrow teasingly. When Draco was done, he held the empty bottle out to Harry’s outstretched hand.
Harry looked as if he was pondering things deeply. He took his hand off of Draco’s face and absentmindedly played with Draco’s hair instead.
“Sometimes I wonder about you, Draco Malfoy,” Harry said, holding his arm out for Draco to side-along.
“That… well, that it’s been ten years since all of this ended, and no matter how much has changed, people still despise me this much… enough to attack me.”
“Reckon I’ve been displaying my staggering athleticism for about three weeks now,” Harry quipped with a grin, poking his head through the bedroom door as he shimmied his jeans on.
“For the record, I don’t hate you anymore either, Potter,” Draco admitted a moment later. “I might even be starting to like you a little.”
“It’s morning now,” Harry explained. “That no-shagging line I drew last night has officially expired and I want to celebrate by sucking your cock.”
Much as he loved lying close to Harry and absorbing his warmth, after a few more lazy minutes, Draco’s bladder couldn’t take it any longer. He stealthily sat up in bed and manoeuvred his legs over the edge, hoping he hadn’t woken Harry with his movement.
She narrowed her eyes skeptically. “Well, let’s not reach for the stars here. I know you’re a perfectly competent writer, and I’ve never had to worry about your work before, but this is a whole different quidditch game. You’ve never written a feature for us, let alone such an important one; you have less experience than almost all of my staff, who will be out for your blood once word gets out that you’re the one who got this story, by the way; and to top it all off… you’re a fucking Malfoy.”
Draco leaned back against his pillow and moaned as Harry worked his cock with his tongue, over every inch, quickly getting Draco harder.
“I’m thinking that I’ve never wanted to fuck anyone as badly as I want to fuck you right now,” Draco heard himself whisper.
Harry looked at him more kindly than he was prepared for, and before Draco knew it, his heart was hammering.
“Look, it’s nothing,” Harry asserted once more, but he knew he wasn’t at all convincing. “I just think he’s kind of cool.”
“On the contrary,” Draco sniffed. “I wouldn’t be caught dead in that monstrosity, regardless of the season.”
And when he looked down at Draco’s expression, he knew kissing his cheek had been exactly the right thing to do.
“I’ve never not been honest with you, you know,” Draco said after a pause. “I do tend to be brutally honest with most people, but I’m only truly unguarded with you. Even when we were at school, I never really filtered myself around you. And I think, as a result, you know me better than anyone.”
Harry simply released one of his long-drawn-out groans, and Draco tried his best to tell himself that it didn't turn him on.
Before he could decide what to say next, or whether he needed to say anything at all, a whistle echoed from above them.
“I’m a little surprised that you’re a cuddler, Malfoy, but I have to say I’m really, really happy about it,” Harry murmured a minute later.
Harry chuckled. “But if I died of dehydration, you could spin your story into a gripping obituary. Think how popular you’d be.”
“I love you, my little flower,” he murmured into her hair. She smelled fresh and clean after her bath.
Despite having to navigate Harry’s busy work schedule all week, they had managed to squeeze in two shorter interview sessions since their first one on Sunday, both of which had taken place in the privacy of Potter’s home. Although Draco was glad to have booked the whole of Saturday with Potter to get some serious work done, he was a little apprehensive to be starting the afternoon off on a broomstick. He rarely flew for enjoyment these days, and it would be hard to stomach when Harry Potter inevitably slaughtered him on the quidditch pitch all these years later.
“Oh, I see, you can’t move because you’re so positively worn out by the sexual prowess of yours truly?”
, Draco,” Harry stated firmly. “And I would appreciate it if you didn’t question my feelings for you again.”
“You know you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do, Harry, or reveal anything that you don’t want known,” Draco assured him. “You don’t owe anyone a damn thing. I hope you know that.”
A nugget of guilt crept into Harry’s stomach as Draco massaged his forehead with his long, thin fingers. Harry recalled him mentioning that he’d had a rough couple of months, back at the cafe. Damn, tormenting Draco Malfoy seemed to be his lot in life, whether he wanted to do so or not.
“If you’re trying to keep me here longer, it’s definitely working,” Harry said, as he resumed kissing Draco’s neck.
Draco slid the papers across the table but got up from his seat before Harry could even reach for them.
“You yelled at me just this morning for taking too long styling my hair,” Draco pointed out, inhaling a shaky breath and resting his head against Harry’s. “Decidedly not a compliment.”
“I’ll never hurt you, you know,” Harry said against his lips, speaking his thoughts out of nowhere, as he so often did.
Draco had never been in here before last night, Harry realized, and the somewhat fuzzy memory of it made him shiver. Harry inhaled deeply and swore he could still smell him in the air. When Draco had fled the room the night before, Harry had tried hard to put his finger on exactly what notes constituted Draco’s fairytale scent; his drunken brain had managed to come up with bergamot and cedar before he promptly passed out. Harry took another deep breath… yes, bergamot and cedar, there was definitely still a hint of it there. It was like waking up in heaven, or it would’ve been, had his mind not been overrun with a long list of all the idiotic decisions he’d made the night before…
“Yes,” Draco said, hardly believing it himself all these years later. “Let’s call it a failed experiment that served no purpose but to act as further proof of my homosexuality.”
She sighed and gestured wordlessly for him to come in. Draco grimaced and entered, perching himself cautiously on the chair across from her.
Harry just smiled at him seductively, and then he brought his marmalade-covered thumb to his lips and licked it. Those green eyes were sinful. Draco felt his prick twitch.
Draco lowered his head to cede the point. “True. But I did know that you were a Hogwarts student, about my age, that I had never met, and I wanted to talk to you because I thought it would be nice to try my hand at meeting a friend that my father hadn’t introduced me to at birth, for once. You, however, seemed rather disinclined to talk to me.”
“Proffice,” Draco muttered under his breath as he shook his head. “You are, without a doubt, the most ridiculous man on earth.”
“Well, if you’re not, then why else might you have lost your nerve tonight?” Draco asked, staring at his knees again.
Draco kept his eyes closed and soaked in the warmth of Harry’s body, relishing the feel of Harry’s lips against his skin. He let out a long, contented sigh.
“We’ve already established that we’re not strangers,” Draco replied, “though that certainly puts me at a disadvantage. I feel as if I’m losing a game somehow, and I do hate losing.”
The sound of it thrashed into Draco like a lightning bolt. He let his body take over, planting small kisses on Harry’s shoulder, on his neck, on the skin behind his ear. He let his tongue dart out and skim the shell of Harry’s ear, pushing his hips outward and feeling Harry, terrifically stiff against him. One of Draco’s hands twisted through Harry’s hair and the other tightened its grasp on Harry’s neck and shoulders, wanting him to come even closer still. Harry took the hint immediately and pulled Draco by the waist, tight against his body, and Draco gasped sharply when Harry rutted his hardness against Draco’s thigh.
“He’s had a few too many,” Draco explained, even though he was just as mystified by Harry’s behavior as his mates appeared to be. “Don’t worry, I’ll check in on him and make sure he’s alright.”
Draco smiled and muttered, "I’m afraid that kissing you is either going to be an extremely disappointing anticlimax to weeks of sexual tension, or… fucking life-changing."
“I mean I was always sort of the odd man out, so to speak,” Harry mumbled. “But now that they’re a real couple, that feeling is magnified. A lot, at times.”
it: Draco Malfoy was the surest thing he’d ever known. Harry closed his eyes and let the feeling whisper over him like a sunrise.
Harry had to roll his eyes at that, even though he was suddenly so turned on that it was becoming an issue. “I’m definitely aware of that.”
“Yeah, that’s why I didn’t,” Harry told him with a disarmingly sweet grin and languid green eyes, running his hands through his dark hair. Draco was a mess.
Harry swallowed thickly, his wide eyes glued to Draco’s. Draco pulled his hand away quickly and folded his hands in his lap again, heart racing. Why on earth had he done that? And how on earth was Potter’s hair so bloody soft?!
Draco was truly speechless now. He couldn’t even breathe, let alone sift any coherent words from the completely vulgar thoughts that suddenly flooded his mind.
“Oh,” Draco said, shifting forward as he placed two steadying hands gently around her chubby little body. “Hello, sweet Rose.”
Draco growled under his breath. When Harry reached the top of the staircase, Draco followed him along the upstairs hallway.
“I was too lazy,” Harry muttered. “And you looked too good. I didn’t want to stop looking at you for a whole ten minutes.”
The two of them flew to their hearts’ content, showing off for each other like teenagers, until finally they took a short break.
“Shut the fuck up, you overdramatic arse,” Harry said, standing up. “I’m going back there right now and I’m going to tell them that we’re dating, that I love you, that you love me, and that we’re going to marry each other and have at least one ridiculously pale child and grow old together and that’s just the way it is.”
And before Harry could protest, Draco took off for the other end of the pitch, laughing the whole way.
“As if you gave me any choice. But lucky for you, I’ve obviously perfected my grooming spells over the years,” Draco told him smugly as he found a comfortable position on the broom from the safety of the ground. “Wind-blown hair is an easy fix.”
“It was. Always presume that everything I say to you is a compliment,” Harry stated, licking his way across Draco’s collarbone and pulling him in closer, grinding their hips together.
“You obviously drink too much of the stuff anyway,” Harry insisted, ignoring his disturbing thoughts. “Tea is healthier.”
“You realize you’ve put me in an enormously stressful position, being the one to cover such an important story,” he said quietly.
“I know what I feel, too,” Draco said softly. “But I am also a realist, unlike you, Harry. I know that feelings aren’t permanent. You see the very best in people and situations, and I love that about you. You see how much you care for me, but you don’t see that someday maybe those feelings will change.”
“You kicked them off of you and they flew in there,” Draco replied, smirking again. “Do I really have to remind you that they got stuck on your ankle, which then led to you cursing at them to, and I quote, ‘go fucking die in a hole’? It was truly a marvellous and graceful display of your staggering athleticism.”
Draco merely continued to stroke his cock and stared back at Harry, who still hadn’t moved from the doorway.
And this was exactly what he hadn’t wanted. Potter coming into his house, making himself comfortable, and then leaving, and Draco all the while sitting in his fear, and being left.
“Ouch!” He clutched his chest and squeezed his eyes shut in jest. Draco grinned at his antics, even though he was irrationally furious with himself for finding this silly man so bloody adorable.
He was dressed casually, no surprise there, but his jeans were sort of nice, all things considered. They certainly fit him well, at least. The t-shirt itself was ghastly, but the color almost matched his eyes.
“There’s that word again,” Harry said, a mischievous smirk on his face. He took the plate Draco handed to him and began filling it with food. “I don’t need eggs.”
There was a long pause, the radio still playing softly in the background, and Draco once again fiddled with his wand, feeling Harry’s eyes on him. Suddenly he was a ball of nerves.
“That’s my card,” Draco began, and his voice sounded so formal that it made Harry smile. “I know you know I’m Draco Malfoy, but I work under a different name, which is the one listed there. There’s nothing sinister about it, I just… well, it makes things a little easier. For everyone. I’m sure you can understand. The joys of being a former Death Eater, and whatnot.”
“Say everything,” Harry encouraged him, reaching forward and playfully clutching Draco’s chin in his hand.
Draco led them up the cobbled front path and unlocked the door with a quick spell. Promptly he scanned the room and, to his relief, saw nothing that would invite any obvious criticism from Harry. Aside from being, as he had already stated, vaguely Hufflepuff.
Draco smiled. He thought he would do anything in the world if it meant seeing Harry wear that expression. His hand drifted up as if it had a mind of its own and affectionately stroked Harry’s stubbled cheek.
Harry sighed once more. “Anyway, gay men who stay with their wives out of loyalty can’t be the ones who love wrong. I think you’d be good at it. At love. I think you’d be great.”
But he had to admit it stung a little all the same, knowing that Potter didn’t immediately hear his posh drawl, for example, or spot the way his mouth drew down at the corners. It was further proof of Harry’s total lack of interest in him. Or perhaps Draco had just changed in the last few years. Everyone he knew seemed to think so.
Draco looked at him curiously for a moment. Did he hate Weasley? Certainly he had at one time, vehemently. But now?
good enough for Harry? Well, he already knew he wasn’t. But what if Harry really did wake up one day and realize it for himself?
Harry lifted another finger, and another, so that they were laced up in Draco’s, moving, touching, exploring. Draco mirrored his actions, rubbing his velvet-soft fingers slowly and gently against Harry’s. The gesture should’ve been harmless and playful, and it was, in a way; but at the same time, Harry wanted to scream with the pleasure of it. Were fingers an erogenous zone? Merlin
For a moment Harry looked like he’d been slapped, and Draco consequently wanted to slap himself. He’d seen those wide, wounded eyes all too often, and each time, they were harder and harder to stomach.
“Oi, watch it!” A loud voice bellowed from behind the counter as the children ran past. A petite witch in bright magenta robes glared at them before turning to smile brightly at him. “Sorry about that, sir! Too many chocolate frogs for those two, methinks! Anything I can help you with?”
Draco wordlessly sat down and picked up his wand, vanishing the spilled tea from the coffee table. When the surface was dry and Draco could no longer avoid Harry’s eyes, he slowly shifted in his seat, turning his body to the side so that he was sitting cross-legged on the couch, completely facing Harry.
“Please, Draco,” Harry whispered, and when the sheets fluttered briefly around his hip, Draco knew he had just grasped his prick. “Please tell me.”
feature--Alex had been increasingly aggressive with his remarks. I suppose he might’ve been jealous, perhaps, that I was given the assignment over him.”
“Do you know, Harry, I’ve been considering it all night, and I wonder if it’s not a bad idea after all.”
“Your eyes are so pretty,” Draco said sweetly, smiling at him. “And I like it when you call me that.”
“I usually just relax, do some gardening, listen to music, read,” Draco said in answer to his question. “I don’t go out a lot. I’ve become rather reclusive in my old age, it seems.”
Draco was lost in every memory until the whistle of the kettle nudged him back to the present. He spent a few lazy minutes moving about the kitchen, using his wand at intervals to gather some supplies for breakfast. All the while, he thought of Harry. All the while, he smiled.
“Well, the things we’re saying now are certainly a lot nicer than they were at school, at least,” Harry pointed out, and Draco smirked at him.
“Don’t stop,” Draco heard himself say, in a throaty whisper, barely aware of what he was saying as he kept pushing his hardness up against Harry.
Harry sighed back. “Yeah, I know what you’re trying to say, as usual. You want to do your job and not feel like you’re crossing any lines.”
“Do you often attempt to lure prospective lovers in coffee shops?” Draco asked, grinning down at his notes before taking a long sip of tea.
“Well, if you don’t have any further questions or concerns, I’m heading home,” she said abruptly. “It’s absolutely appalling that I’m here on a bloody Sunday.”
“It’s fine,” Draco replied. “Do you think your feelings are stemming from jealousy alone? Or is there something else bothering you?”
A few moments passed. Draco tried to pull himself together, but the tears on his cheeks were flowing freely.
But things were bound to come up during questioning, things that Harry wouldn’t like. Even if it ran contrary to everything he knew about Harry, Draco’s body was screaming in fear that Harry was going to abandon him once he knew everything.
Draco felt himself blushing. Harry wanted to have sex with him? He had guessed as much, but it was nice to have it said aloud. Harry wanted to have sex with him.
“There,” Harry said finally, smiling at Draco as he hovered the tea tray slowly to the table. “Watch your hands."
Harry shrugged, his body tensing with adrenaline as he steeled his courage. “I think you’re decent looking. I think you’re relatively interesting. I’m single, you’re single. And you’ve obviously become less of an unbearable arsehole in the last decade. So, yeah, of course I was flirting. Is that a crime?”
When Draco took his usual glance around the office upon his arrival, there were already enough reporters present for him to veer off to the side and take the long way to his cubicle. Halfway there, however, Draco felt a crumpled ball of paper hit his cheek, and he glared over his shoulder.
“Well, it’s very interesting that you became a reporter,” Hermione said conversationally. “How long have you been writing for the Prophet?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Don’t look so damn shocked, Malfoy. I know it, you know it, my family might as well know it too. And if it’s too much for them to handle, then I really, really hope they can eventually come around to it, because you’re mine, forever, and I’m not going to give you up just because it might make some people uncomfortable.”
“Fucking hell,” Harry panted when Draco pulled away a minute later, and when Draco looked down at him, Harry was gazing back at him like Draco was his whole universe.
“--was it, mate, ten galleons?” Harry heard Ron ask him in the back of his mind. Thankfully, Ron only glanced back at him for half a second, so he failed to notice that both his and Draco’s hands were suspiciously out of sight.
Draco suddenly felt his stomach twisting. He was hurled back to Hogwarts all over again at the sight of
“You can admit it,” Harry pressed. “You miss flirting with me, too. And I think you’re kind of turned on right now.”
Draco took a sip of tea in preparation and poised his quill, bracing himself for the worst. “Whenever you’re ready.”
“Resilient. Independent,” Draco continued, enjoying himself. “Exemplary quidditch player. Classically handsome.”
"Draco--" Harry tried to sound authoritative, but he knew it was a useless effort. His mouth had gone dry.
Harry’s fingers stilled against his arm and Draco turned his head to look up at him. Harry was looking down at him with wonder in his eyes.
“Half your questions are too,” Harry said. “And we’re taking a break, remember? This isn’t work anymore, it’s just two blokes having a conversation.”
The most odious of the usual culprits, Alex Morris, stood at the wall of a normally unoccupied cubicle, his arms folded over top of it and a cocky smirk on his face.
Harry leaned in for a kiss and Draco kissed him back, as deeply as he could, though it didn’t ever feel deep enough.
“What’s your favorite word?” Harry asked, avoiding his question. If anyone on earth had a favorite word, it would be Draco.
Harry couldn’t help but bashfully smile back. He felt suddenly envious of that immutable Malfoy confidence. Envious of it, but also really, really… into it.
“Harry,” he’d called out, but to his frustration, it came out no louder than the faintest whisper. “Harry!”
“I’m sorry you have to work with such a tosser,” Harry countered, taking a calming breath. “Also, where on earth did you get Roger?”
“Well to hell with them,” Harry muttered, sounding a little petty to Draco’s ears. “I say you paid your price and then some.”
“Draco?” his mother whispered. She reached for his hand from across the table and he took hers without pause. His eyes filled with anxious tears as he waited for her to say something.
“Did you sleep as well?” Draco asked, closing his eyes again and burrowing even further backwards, as close as he could get to Harry.
Draco nearly laughed, but he felt Harry wrap a hand around his erection and instantly lost thought of all else. Harry moved his hips and positioned himself and Draco in place, and slowly, slowly, slowly, Draco sank down onto Harry’s cock.
Harry snorted out a laugh. “I have no problem showering you with lovely words, Draco Malfoy, because
Vaguely, he wondered whether Malfoy would still be interested if he had known who he was flirting with.
“Fine,” Harry muttered grudgingly, flopping back down again. “But you have to promise that you’ll answer them truthfully, and no filter this time.”
anything,” Harry declared vehemently for the fourth time, pulling at his hair in frustration. The muscles in his arms flexed deliciously when he did so, and Draco forced himself not to stare.
“Just please stay still,” Harry insisted, squirming as he willed his cock to stop twitching. “I don’t want you to hurt yourself even more.”
“You are not a death eater anymore,” Harry began. Every word sounded angry. “You’ve paid your dues for the mistakes you made. You’re a good man. You are the very best man. And I love you. And I will always, always, always love you.”
Only a few seconds later, Harry cried out, and Draco saw patches of wetness beginning to blossom on the sheet. He looked up, and oh god, the ecstasy on Harry’s face…
Once he and Harry were alone, Draco felt nervous once again, and suddenly all he could think about were Harry’s rough fingers touching his own underneath the table. He could feel the tension crackling between them like a spell, and he couldn’t look at Harry again.
Draco woke with a sharp gasp the next morning, having been jolted awake from a particularly chilling nightmare. He kept his eyes closed as he tried to focus on the sound of light rain tapping melodically against his window. His toes were cold. No, his entire body was cold.
Draco breathed out against his neck. “What on earth would ever cause you to think that you’ll lose me?”
“Already have some made, sir,” Harry joked, swooning a little at the commanding tone of his voice, and that bloody perfect walk. “I love it when you treat me like a house elf.”
“I’m always serious, Potter,” Draco said, once again picking up his quill and pretending to write so as to avoid Harry’s probing eyes.
“Thank god,” Harry said, tossing himself onto his side so he was lying down and facing Draco, an affable grin lighting up his face and ah, Draco was lost.
Harry deepened the kiss, and Draco responded in kind, pulling Harry’s body flush against his own. Harry melted into him, wrapping his arms over Draco’s shoulders.
“Of course, I have nothing further that I wish to discuss. And again, I do apologize, Ms Peters,” Draco muttered guiltily. “I can’t tell you how much I appreciate you meeting with me today.”
Draco heard himself squeak in protest. Harry clapped a hand over his mouth to stop himself from laughing, but Draco saw that his eyes were twinkling.
“Do it for me?” Harry requested through a yawn, his face still burrowed into the overstuffed white pillow. “You do everything so good.”
He glanced over at Draco, who had inconspicuously occupied the kitchen chair beside Hermione’s and was observing them in silence. He was gazing back at Harry, his quill poised an inch over the page, and the look on his face shook Harry to the core. Surely he had never seen that particular smile before; he would’ve remembered it. Harry shyly smiled back at him, feeling a little bit vulnerable.
Harry was flabbergasted at how sincere Draco sounded, particularly when saying something so sweet. He nodded, strangely unable to speak.
“I like when you rub off on me, Potter,” Draco said cheekily. “Especially when I’ve first woken up.”
Suffice it to say, masturbating next to someone was an entirely new experience for him, and the fact that all he could see was Harry’s handsome face somehow made it all that much more erotic.
He was wearing shabby jeans and trainers: the standard Potter uniform. But underneath the ghastly red jumper was an unexpectedly fitted white t-shirt, hugging an unexpectedly fit body. Draco didn’t remember him being quite so… masculine. Or so fucking
No, of course Harry wouldn’t have left after saying that he would stay. Harry didn’t break promises in the way that Draco was used to people in his life breaking promises. Harry was different. And Harry was his.
Draco’s hands had drifted downward, now settled against Harry’s hard chest, holding him at not-quite-arm’s length.
“On the contrary,” Draco said. “I’m quite content not to be dressed as if I’m perpetually on my way to a Quidditch match.”
He took a deep breath and slowly pulled the door open. Harry stood there, looking up at him with bemused concern.
He fished through his sparse cupboards and found a half-eaten packet of crisps, as well as a tin of store-bought biscuits. Based on what he had observed at Hogwarts, Draco knew Potter had a sweet tooth.
Harry was, as always, an unstoppable force on a broomstick, and Draco could hardly keep his eyes off him. He reluctantly accepted that he had grown steadily more fond of Harry over their first three interview sessions, a fact that young Draco would’ve shuddered at. And for all Draco’s claims of appearances being unimportant, it was hard to avoid being attracted to him physically as well, particularly when he was flying. Harry’s rugged good looks were somehow enhanced when he was on his broom: he filled out his quidditch robes better than anyone in history, and that wayward mop of hair seemed only to improve the more it was abused by the wind. Draco thought all of this was very unfair, though undeniably appealing.
Draco didn’t think he would ever stop feeling the flutter of snitches in his stomach when he heard those words on Harry’s captivating lips. Growing up in a household where ‘I love you’s were used sparingly gave the words all the more power when they were spoken. To Draco, ‘I love you’ was like a potent healing spell, like the most restorative of potions.
He winced when he saw Rosalind through the open door of her office, rubbing her temples, a large whiskey and an even larger tea sitting on the desk in front of her. Double-fisting at nine in the morning: that certainly didn’t bode well. Draco knocked softly and braced himself for the worst.
He breathed in and out as heavily as if he had just completed a marathon. Everything was cocked up again. He’d only managed to hold onto the love of his life for three measly weeks, and now it was all over. But he should have known it. Nothing good stayed in his life. Inevitably, the good things realized that he was a barren wasteland of a human being, and they moved on. Harry, the best of them all, had lasted far longer than Draco ever hoped.
Harry’s smile was everything good in the world, and Draco decided that he needed several doses of it every day from now until the end of time. Harry took a step towards him, and another, and Draco instinctively held his arms open. Harry fell into his embrace and they hugged each other close. Draco couldn’t tell if the racing heartbeat he felt was his or Harry’s.
“You don’t want to stop now,” Harry replied. His voice was almost pleading, and needier than Draco had ever heard it sound before, and it made him want to toss the coffee table out of the way and lunge at Harry from across the room.
Before he could blink, Potter was flinging a blanket-like cloak around both of their shoulders, and Draco heard a gasp of surprise coming from his own lips. He knew that this had to be Potter’s famed Invisibility Cloak, but he resisted the impulse to ask. He looked down at his hand instead and felt his stomach lurch--he was indeed invisible.
Harry didn’t trust himself to answer, so he merely smiled, entranced, as Draco left the coffee shop. For a moment Harry sat still, clutching his mug and staring at the door of the cafe. And then his brain stuttered back to life.
“Fuck, I don’t care, Harry, I won’t either… I want you to come, I’m going to, too…” Draco hardly registered saying these things; all he could think about was the feeling of Harry against him, Harry’s breath on his neck, Harry’s slick sweat on his face, Harry’s cock nestled against his, both of them leaking and rock hard, Harry’s fingers wrapped around them both, Harry everywhere…
“But I’m also a damn good writer,” he argued, somewhat weakly. Potter had said so, anyway. He squared his shoulders and gathered his wits about him. “I work hard and I do everything to the best of my ability. You know I’m here twice as many hours as I’m required to be, and most weekends as well.”
“I’m sorry.” It came out in a whisper, despite his body shaking from the effort of forcing it from his lips. Two words, two pathetic words, to make up for his mountain of guilt… All Draco could think about were the dozens of times he had fallen short in his life, and how ashamed he was that this was another one.
“I’m still not sure why you’re so nice to me, Potter,” he muttered, softly stroking Harry’s cheek. “I’m certain I’ve done nothing to earn your kindness.”
Draco was desperate for Harry to return to him. He wanted to feel Harry’s arms around his body, watch the look of determined concentration in his green eyes as he unbuttoned Draco’s dress shirt, taste Harry’s kisses on his mouth.
“Are you fucking kidding me?!” Harry gestured at Draco’s bare chest. “Fine! You look at me and hate yourself, but I look at you and I’m reminded of what I did!”
She smiled at him. “Thank you. I wholeheartedly agree with you. Although, I have to be honest, she’s behaved far better today than average. You know how to charm visitors, don’t you, darling?”
“But… surely he’ll change his mind once he realizes who I really am,” Draco protested. “He hates me.”
Draco numbly stared over the short hedge into the darkness of the night and realized with a huff that Potter had just driven him out of his own house. It was further evidence of the amount of power Potter had over him, and he hated it, hated it, hated it…
“Not that I’m revelling in your sorrow,” Draco said after a beat, “but I must say it’s a little comforting to have you join me in my desolation for once. You’re usually the picture of cheer. The blazing sun to my dark night, lighting up all of my cobwebbed corners.”
Harry grinned, because he knew Draco was only teasing him, and also because their knees were touching. “You always make me sound so completely stupid.”
“Your eyes are obviously interesting, that’s all,” he said. Understatement of the century. “Now a personality trait.”
“I’m going to toss some stale bread in a sandwich bag so you don’t starve until lunch,” Draco corrected, smiling over at him.
about him. When he made his morning tea at the hotel kitchenette, there was Draco sipping it primly at the table across from him. When he joked around with Andrea, he thought about which of Draco’s smiles the joke would’ve elicited. And when he wanked at night (and in the morning, if he was honest), he thought of Draco, always Draco,
When Draco had been gone for over two hours, Harry knew he couldn’t just be caught up at the Prophet, and he started to worry about him in earnest. He tried to remember exactly what he’d said, whether there had been some kind of miscommunication, but he was sure Draco had told him he wouldn’t be gone long. He desperately fought against the final, nagging possibility that perhaps Draco was just being Malfoy; perhaps he had simply ditched him.
Draco merely straightened his tie. The past weeks had been the best of his life, as a matter of fact, but saying so would be horribly melodramatic.
Before Draco got out of bed, a slip of paper on the pillow next to him caught his eye. He smiled as picked it up and read:
“What do you do for work then?” Harry asked him.  “You’re obviously on your feet all day, or else you wouldn’t be complaining about walking like an old man.”
Draco positively quivered. He had to stop rubbing his cock for a moment for fear that he would come too soon.
Draco didn’t break the eye contact, and this time neither did Harry. He felt the bustling pub suddenly go oddly quiet and hazy, almost as if everything surrounding Harry had turned into a soft, abstract painting. Draco felt warmth spread up over him from his toes to the top of his head, and he knew he was smiling back, and he suddenly had to look away.
“Tell me you like my hair,” Harry suggested. “Or my eyes. Or my scruffy face. Really, anything above the waist is fair game.”
“Oh, is that what I’m doing?” Harry asked, dodging the question but smiling at Malfoy’s familiar cockiness.
Ron and Hermione exchanged a significant look, and as much as Draco wanted to ignore it, his curiosity got the better of him.
“Ow, fuck,” Harry grumbled, straightening his glasses. “How is your arm still so good? You almost never play quidditch anymore.”
“Just call a spade a spade, Potter,” Draco said with a smile, leaning into Harry’s chest and resting his arms on top of Harry’s. “We both know you were right the first time.”
“Well, be sure to pop by tonight for a brief but extensive recapitulation of how it went,” Draco said. “I’ll be up late now that I’m free from work for the summer, so any time is fine.”
“I love your chest hair,” Draco said honestly. Best not to elaborate for now. He was a little embarrassed to feel his cheeks warming.
Draco laughed, uninhibited, and Harry just watched him. “Precisely like that, yes. And what could be a more contentious topic than love, the supposed solution to all contention? Irony at its finest.”
Draco pulled out of his embrace and fixed him with a glare, refusing to acknowledge any of the dozens of emotions that now buzzed inside of him.
Harry absently stroked his thumb and pointer finger across his prickly face and stared out the window. “I had to give my account of things just after the Battle, obviously, just so people would know what happened, and all that. But… no, I’ve never really discussed it with anyone since then. Certainly never on a personal level.”
“I used to know your face so well,” Harry elaborated shyly, “except it’s changed now. Sometimes you give me a look that I can’t immediately read, like I used to be able to do for all your expressions. Makes me weirdly anxious, because I know you’re not going to explain it, or tell me what you’re thinking. Actually, it kind of makes me feel like we’re back in sixth year.”
“Yeah, sure, good for them,” Ron agreed with another snort. “Not so good for their children, many of whom are missing the free babysitting services.”
He thought about him so much that he felt as if he was at Hogwarts all over again, back when he would leer at Harry over his potions homework, hating him with a passion, but simultaneously wishing he was also gay so that they could figure it all out together.
He tucked Harry’s worn-out trainers neatly under the nightstand, spelled his dirty glasses clean, and bent the arms of them inward so that they were folded up properly. He then stood up (staring once again at Harry’s backside), swiftly levitated Harry’s jumper into the wardrobe, and spelled the drapes closed.
Breathing heavily with his eyes closed, Draco sighed deeply and rested his arm on top of his head. Before he could even form a coherent thought, he felt Harry’s tongue on his stomach and his eyes snapped open.
“But I like knowing what you’re thinking,” Harry said thoughtfully. “Even if it can come off as harsh.”
“Let me bury myself in you,” Harry growled, staring into his eyes with a yearning Draco hadn’t seen before. Draco was instantly hard. “I need you, Draco. I need to fill you. Please...”
When Draco reached Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, he took another deep breath and counted to five, nervously straightening his black robes and keeping his hand closed firmly around the wand in his pocket. He stepped up to the door and ventured inside the warm shop.
Draco straightened his tie and then started to tap two fingers against his hip. Two nervous habits in one go… Now Harry knew something was wrong.
But something stopped him, an oddly calm voice in his head, something that sounded a lot like Harry and felt a lot like love. That voice told him not to walk away. No, he’d walked away enough; now was the time to stay. Harry hadn’t left yesterday. Draco wouldn’t leave today.
Finally, they were a few steps in front of the questioning room, and Harry impulsively grabbed Draco’s wrist to stop him before he took him inside.
It was just two words, but to Draco, they were two painfully insufficient words, ones that could never repay what he knew he owed. But somehow, he also knew they would be enough for Potter. “Thank you.”
“And you’re sort of right,” Draco agreed, “you do have to decide eventually, one way or the other. But there’s time. You can keep me informed.”
“Dammit, I’m just trying to keep things professional, alright?!” he bellowed, his pale eyes flashing towards the entrance of his cubicle as he darted around Harry and back to the other side of the tiny space. “This is my place of work!”
Draco couldn’t help it anymore, he burst out laughing. It all struck him as just so typically Potter: bringing him to the brink of coming in his pants one moment, only to make it all a hilarious and endearing joke a minute later. Harry was the perfect storm of overpowering sexual tension and incredibly charming likeability. Draco had never met someone who married the two characteristics so seamlessly. Merlin, he wanted to both fuck Harry senseless and also cuddle him into the ground, and the two intense desires colliding inside of him felt far too close to love.
Harry exhaled deeply and wrapped both arms tightly around Draco’s waist. “Do I fit the bill then?” His voice sounded a little calmer now.
“Did they say who would be conducting the questioning?” Draco asked suspiciously. He had one wild guess.
“I won’t say another word,” he finally managed to say through his fingers. “Let’s just...move on, okay?”
“Why?” Harry asked, stroking his arm. “People have pointed that out to me before, but they seem to be more annoyed by it than anything.”
The words were nonsensical, but Draco wanted to take a bath in them. Harry reached over and cupped his hands around Draco’s calves, probably for balance, but the touch electrified him. Draco was fairly certain that no one had ever touched his calves before, and it felt unexpectedly lovely. He wasn’t sure if it was the newness of the touch, or the fact that it was Harry touching him, but he wasn’t sure if he cared.
“Fine,” Harry said quietly. “You want me to be honest? You’re right. I was flirting with you the other night.”
Harry sat back in his chair and took a sip of his tea, thinking that maybe Draco’s eyes were stars instead of diamonds.
“Hermione doesn’t really hate anyone,” Harry responded, using his wand to heat the water in the kettle and then taking three colorful tea cups out of the cupboard.
“Yes,” Draco continued. “He had asked me to meet with him at the Leaky Cauldron so he could return my wand to me.”
Harry grinned at him and took another bite, crumbs falling all over his chest. Draco felt blissfully happy watching him, mess and all.
“I’m a blithering idiot, as you said, and you’re proper and polite. I leap first, you look. I’m brown and you’re paper white.”
Harry looked up at Draco shyly as he tucked his wand back in his pocket, then he grinned, and he moved in for a kiss, a lazy, sloppy, seemingly never-ending one. Draco couldn’t get enough of him. He wanted to fuse himself to Harry so they could never leave each other’s sides. Every kiss felt like coming home.
He headed home in the early evening with just enough time to change his clothing and style his hair, and as he did so, his anxiety became more and more pervasive. Every time he paid a visit to Malfoy Manor he felt this way, inundated with the nightmarish memories of everything the house represented.
“One of my favorites, if you remember me telling you,” Harry told Draco as he levitated the tea tray and their empty tea cups towards the kitchen sink. “And Ron’s is the best.”
“That wasn’t exactly a smooth change of subject, Potter,” Draco said, taking a bite of his breakfast. The bacon was cooked to perfection, if he did say so himself, but Harry had, of course, given him more than half of the food, and he knew he would never finish it all.
“I like that we’re comfortable discussing our perverse fantasies with each other, Potter,” Draco said with a smirk.
“And now I’ve finished all your tea,” he said lazily. “Maybe you’ll be the one to die of dehydration tonight.”
Draco gently nudged Harry backwards after too short a kiss, and Harry took the hint again, breaking away and taking a small step back. Draco’s hands left Harry’s hair and rested instead on Harry’s shoulders. Draco let himself absorb the feeling of the hard muscle under his fingers, and the way Harry was still clutching his middle like he was a life preserver. They stared at each other, still breathing heavily.
“I like your hair like that,” Harry blurted out. Well, he couldn’t be too upset; at least his mental filter had overruled ‘you wanna boff later?’ in favor of this slightly more appropriate remark.
“Of course I’m serious,” Harry said. “I’m going to apparate directly into Ron and Hermione’s house, and even if they’re midway through a shag, I am going to shout at them that I’m in love with Draco Malfoy and that that will never change.”
“They only bother me because they’re reminders of the fact that I hurt you,” he said, barely audible. “And I can’t
As Ron finished up with dinner and Hermione helped Rose eat her food rather than play with it, Draco began asking casual questions, his tone engaging and mild. Harry rubbed a comforting hand along Rose’s back as he listened to the conversation swirling around him, perfectly content to watch Draco fitting himself into Harry’s life.
Finally, Ron finished with his cooking and wiped his hands on the tea towel as he came over to the table.
“Well, if I’m totally honest, I suppose I did have a little thing for you, as well, though I probably wasn’t even aware that it was attraction. You were my type, after all.”
Showing admirable strength of will, and more than a little Slytherin determination, Draco leaned back and shimmied himself off of Harry. Kneeling between his legs, Draco slowly unbuckled Harry’s brown leather belt, holding his gaze as he did so.
Without warning (or a snarky retort), Harry wrapped both of his hands tightly around Draco’s oversized coffee mug. To be fair, Draco had set it almost directly in front of him, since the table was hardly big enough to hold everything he’d laid on it. Nevertheless, Draco reached over and smacked him on the wrist.
Draco snorted at him as he tugged his borrowed track bottoms back into place beneath the covers. “You haven’t seen the half of it, Potter.”
“Only if it’s done wrong,” Draco replied, before he could filter himself. What was it about Harry that made him want to say everything in his head at any given moment?
Harry stared at him, a strange melancholy in his emerald green eyes. “Life beats all of us down in some way, doesn’t it?”
“Indeed,” he replied. “Obviously it doesn’t necessarily impact my life in quite the same way, as a homosexual, but… Anyway, regardless, I wanted a child, too. And not just an heir.”
Lucius’ three years in Azkaban after the war had changed him irreparably, and Draco knew his mother had suffered as a result, both mentally and socially. He felt a pang of guilt that he hadn’t spent more time with her while his father was in prison, but it had taken him months and months to be able to return to the house at all without experiencing a panic attack. Now that his father was back at the Manor once more, they were all still adjusting to their lives as disgraced members of the Dark Lord’s inner circle.
“It sounds like a load of bollocks to me,” Draco muttered. “I’d rather have a boyfriend who would tell me I was a snarky bastard. At least then I’d know he was honest.”
Draco bit his lip. “I don’t know if I can believe it, Harry. It’s all too weird. It’s weird that you didn’t tell your best mates that you’re in love. So fucking weird.”
“I dunno,” Harry concluded with a shrug. “I like when you’re around. You improve my life. I think you even improve
“Sure you won’t.” Harry didn’t trust him as far as he could throw him. “I told him around half-five, so he’ll be here then. He’s always exactly on time.”
“Stating a fact… that you don’t like blondes,” Harry surmised, still grinning. "Even though you don't think a person's looks matter. Right?"
“What time is it?” Draco asked, before turning around and checking the grandfather clock to answer his own question. “Just before eight.”
As ever, he could not say no to Harry. Draco hastily unclasped his own flies and quickly shoved his trousers down and kicked them off his legs, pulling desperately at his now-free cock as he wrapped his lips around Harry’s length. He pushed his head down slowly, allowing Harry to fill his mouth.
Harry sighed deeply and shook his head, as if Draco had just told him some tragic news. “Seems to be done wrong all too often.”
Draco nodded curtly at her and took a step forward, jumping slightly as a display of screaming yo-yo’s to his right bellowed out a lively chorus of shrieks. Honestly, this place was the very definition of a sensory overload. He took another deep breath and stepped up to the counter.
“I don’t know how you can be so calm about it,” Harry finally muttered. “Every time you bring up the shitty reality of your situation, you sound so resigned to it all.”
“Maybe that means we met in another life,” Harry said, unsure where on earth that had come from. He took a sip of his mocha in order to center himself.
“Please, let’s not talk about the weather,” Draco mumbled in disgust, draping his jacket over the back of what had become his usual chair at the kitchen table. Harry adored watching him make himself at home. “You know how I detest small talk.”
“I did,” Harry replied proudly, tucking his broomstick under his arm and running his hands through his thick hair. As always, it was an adequate distraction, and Draco’s stomach twisted with pleasure at the sight.
Harry let out a nervous laugh and ran his hands through his hair. “I have no idea what you’re doing, Draco.”
“Harry, I don’t give a fuck that you gave them to me,” Draco said honestly. “I told you yesterday, it’s water under the bridge, and I meant that. They don’t hurt me, they don’t bother me, I barely even notice them anymore. But…”
“You’ve given me a lot to work with thus far,” Draco told Harry, ignoring his question. “I actually feel as if I know you quite well already.”
“I’m as surprised as you,” she agreed. “And ordinarily this would be wonderful news for the Prophet.”
Draco rolled his eyes, but his heart fluttered unhelpfully. “No, Potter. Honey. Flavored. The bean, for goodness’ sake, you ridiculous reprobate of a human.”
“I’m making an exception,” he decided. “Three of your invasive questions, in exchange for my being a knob.”
Draco snorted. “I would be, but I know that the only reason you haven’t asked is because you can’t decipher my notes anyway.”
Harry studied him and Draco could see that he was finally seeing reason. Draco felt a blanket of resignation sweeping over him.
“Plenty,” Malfoy smirked. “Faintly irksome and highly ill-mannered, for example; but above all, incredibly intriguing.”
“Because you scare the shit out of me, Potter.” It was the truth, but Draco was still embarrassed to have said it.
Draco lifted his espresso and shook his head with an embarrassed grin. “Sorry, I’ve been at the pub all evening, and I fear I’m still slightly inebriated. Can’t quite put two and two together now. Feel free to stop me from sounding a fool any time, by the way.”
Draco nodded back; that was a relief. The man was vile, but he was also smart: Draco didn’t believe that Alex would sacrifice his own arse just to take him down. Well, as long as he didn’t misuse any information that might harm Harry, they wouldn’t have any problems.
“I hate that you have so much power over me, Potter,” he said, but his eyes told Harry the opposite.
Harry lifted his hand and gently touched it to Draco’s, the one still on Harry’s chest. Draco felt his fingers predictably go up in flames, and so he yanked them away from Potter’s chest as quickly as possible. He turned, embarrassed, and retreated back into the sitting room. He felt Harry following close behind him.
“Because… this is happening very quickly. And I don’t know if… I don’t know exactly how I feel about that, I suppose.”
“She moved to France a few months ago,” he continued. “She’d been looking for a change of scenery, as I said. I know she’ll be happy, anyway.”
Harry considered his response. “I’m alright with it. I’m actually sort of selfishly happy about it. And I’m more than a little curious about who you’ve snogged now, but you don’t need to tell me if you don’t want to. And I guess on the whole I’m just more than a little surprised.”
Draco had to look away from that lovely stubbled face before he lost all sense of decorum. “Harry then.”
“Well, considering my lovely family disinherited, disowned, and entirely shunned my Aunt Andromeda for simply marrying a muggleborn, you can imagine they weren’t terribly keen to let Nym… Tonks and I become the closest of cousins. I never even met her.”
“Harry?” Draco asked, brushing a hand through Harry’s slightly sweaty black hair. “I’m sorry, should I not have done that?”
Draco awoke the following day with a slight headache as the bright morning sun streamed through the window from an unusual angle. When he gradually opened his eyes, he realized why it seemed different: this wasn’t his bedroom. That wasn’t his antique grandfather clock, those weren’t his sheer white drapes. That most certainly was not his crude mug on this vaguely familiar nightstand.
“Least I can do, knowing you’re not suing our arses,” she said with a snort. “I’m sure they’re going to ask you if you have any ideas about his motives, or his whereabouts, so give that a bit of thought before you head over.”
“Because you were flirting with me four days ago,” Harry said boldly. “And you seemed like you didn’t hate it.”
“I am sorry, though, Draco, and not just for wasting your time,” Harry said, feeling shy and embarrassed. “I know I was a little… a little forward last night. I guess I can be kind of… erm, flirtatious when I’m drinking. So… sorry. If that made you uncomfortable at all, I mean.”
He turned on the spot and was gone. As shamefully sentimental as it was, Draco immediately felt bereft.
“I agree with what you’re saying, actually,” Draco said. “Something about being your rival always had a way of making me feel sort of… alive.”
“I think you mean, ‘I’m Draco Malfoy, I call the shots,’” Harry amended with a chuckle. “You like being in control.”
Draco huffed, shifting in his seat. “No, I’m not going to sue him either. Merlin’s beard. Why do you ask?”
“Some days I can’t imagine a more perfect person ever existing, and then on other days, I’m positively cursing his name,” she added, and Draco snickered. “But, yes, we’re very happy.”
Ron threw back a swig of butterbeer before he responded, “I was merely reminding Harry how utterly fetching you are, love.”
“Honestly,” she muttered, “I’m not sure why you’re so surprised. He said you spoke the other day, something about a late-night coffee? Surely he wasn’t lying?”
“Well, as far as relationship history…” Draco looked up at him timidly. “I’ve never really been with anyone. I’ve gone on two dates in my life, to be honest, neither of whom were very interested in anything serious with a Death Eater… former or not. And you’re the first person with whom I’ve really done anything physical, beyond kissing.”
Because of course Potter would check on him. Of course Potter would see him at his absolute worst, as he always had. Of course Potter wouldn’t leave him to rot on the bathroom floor, clutching the toilet for dear life. Of course Potter would use his given name at a time like this, and of course it would sound like a siren’s song on his lips.
Draco filed through his mind for any safe topics of conversation, though he knew he was spinelessly avoiding the one topic he needed to raise. He had always avoided bringing up work, as his parents failed to understand the concept of teaching in a muggle school as proper employment, and there never seemed to be much else for Draco to talk about.
Draco bent his head down and groaned into Harry’s shoulder before slowly pulling away, and Harry watched him take two deliberate steps back.
“Well, you make me happier,” he replied, before realizing that his statement carried a lot more weight than Harry’s did.
“And then there was Natalie Halstadt,” Harry went on after a short pause. “I met her at the pub on my twentieth birthday. She had these really light blue eyes, damn they were pretty. And she was so funny, but like, in a quiet way. Smart. Really cool girl.”
They couldn’t cross any more boundaries. They couldn’t… Because Draco knew that if he touched Harry again, he wouldn’t stop. He'd forget why he needed to set boundaries at all.
“Oh, well, you don’t have to, of course, since I’m sure you’d be more comfortable at home, but I was thinking… you’re more than welcome to stay here for a while tomorrow,” Harry said, feeling shy. “Actually, I can probably leave work for a bit and come cook for you. If you want.”
Harry was still sitting on his armrest, looking positively bewildered. “Why, are you cold or something?”
And Draco let him do it, because he knew he belonged there. He let himself lose control, let his hot tears soak Harry’s ratty old t-shirt, because he knew it would be okay. He belonged there. He melted into Harry’s body, and Harry stroked his back, and Draco shivered against him, partly because he was afraid, partly because he wasn’t. He belonged there. He belonged in Harry’s arms.
you pick him up. Don’t wait until afterwards, because you’ll start playing with him and then you’ll get distracted and forget, and then the poor thing will be waiting for fresh bedding when he’s worn out and ready to sleep.”
“I mean when you have sex, you’re passionate,” he ventured, trying to keep up with his own mouth, but it (along with his cock) held the reins. His imagination was painting vivid images: sucking on Harry’s neck, biting at his nipple, worshipping his prick, Harry softly moaning his name with
Draco retrieved a handful of pellets from a small ceramic pot he kept by the window and held them out in front of the owl’s beak. Eagerly his little guest bent down, and Draco let the owl eat from his hand as he stroked its soft brown and white feathers. Once the owl had eaten its fill, it sat perched on the sill cleaning its wings, and Draco watched it for a moment, sipping his tea.
“How many times do I have to remind you that I’m not used to being told no?” Draco asked, feeling mysteriously riled up. He picked up his quill and started to write.
“Are you annoyed because you’re inebriated, or because I’m telling you things you don’t want to hear?” Draco challenged.
“It was at the Yule Ball,” Draco said. “Pansy had always shown interest, and I was a confused but randy teenager, so when she went in for the kill, I just went along with it.”
“You’re late,” Draco murmured, lifting his coffee to his lips and tapping his quill on the edge of his leather portfolio.
“Faults?” Draco asked, bewildered. “Harry, I’m a Malfoy. For one thing, my family has always treated the Weasleys like vermin.”
Harry was rewarded with a rare expression of shock, and he felt giddy to know that he had finally affected the ever-impassive Draco. But Harry thought he could read something else in his face, too… Surely he wasn’t blushing? Their eyes met, until Draco’s tongue darted out briefly over his pink lips, and Harry’s gaze was drawn to his mouth like a magnet.
“Life never really got better,” Draco concluded. “Once it finally stopped getting worse, it just stayed there at the bottom.”
Draco smiled, because it was so very like Harry to offer an apology for something that didn’t require one.
“As for your other witness, Richards: he, too, saw a single curse being fired, and he also stated that he saw Morris fleeing your cubicle in a state of agitation,” Rosalind went on. “That, along with the fact that Morris is currently MIA, is basically as much proof as the Aurors needed of his guilt.”
What Draco needed was a coffee: extra large, extra everything. No, what Draco needed was tea. Harry’s tea. No… what Draco needed was
“You should know by now that I like weird, Potter,” Draco murmured. “I want to hear everything that you think about. Every disgusting, depraved detail.”
“Sorry, I don’t mean to be loud,” Draco croaked, even as he moaned again. “I can’t really control it.”
