Bill immediately grabbed the letter, and shouted, “It’s from Ron and Hermione!”
of what seeing his torturer would do to Harry.
was the secret to Dumbledore’s power — his wand. Sure, the man must be skillful, but this wand
At the end of the lesson, Harry got his first Outstanding since he’d had Snape’s book.
His mouth had gone dry at the sight of the expanse of skin - he’d never fully registered it before, but Draco, for all his pointiness, was graceful and willowy - long, delicate limbs, slim but covered with a layer of muscle. He was embarrassed when Draco had asked if he was “enjoying the view” because he, well, was. He’d dutifully healed the bruises on Draco’s legs, and finally asked Draco who’d done it. Not because he didn’t know - he’d committed the names he’d seen on the map to memory - but because he wanted to know what Draco thought. He was back to his old self - despite only being in his underwear, he had his head held high and his back was straight. He hadn’t said their names, claiming he didn’t know - which was viable, since Harry hadn’t known either - and he’d gone to sit on the bed, put his head in his hands. This was no time for Draco to have a hero complex. Harry wasn’t going to go after them, if Draco didn’t want him to.
and generally just not capable of movement.
Harry didn’t feel like he could get enough of this - of
Harry looked around the common room. It was similar to the Gryffindor one, if a little smaller - comfy armchairs scattered around a rectangular room, rather than circular, with a different colour scheme - probably so all the houses felt equally uncomfortable. The room was monotone with purple accents. It should have looked cold, but the fire was burning cheerfully and cast comforting shadows around the room. Harry didn’t feel at home, exactly, but he was...comfortable. He really wanted to go into his room and stare at the grey canopy above his bed, but with the feast that wasn’t an option.
“We’ll see you in the morning, Malfoy. Professor, you can sleep in this room over here…”
Malfoy deposited Harry on the bed surprisingly gently, before wrinkling his nose and waving his wand in a wide sweep and muttering under his breath, causing the room to suddenly smell of lavender. A glance to his right confirmed to Ron that Hermione was itching to ask Malfoy what the spell was, but Ron gently shook his head and muttered “tomorrow.”
It was an awkward trip to the classroom - Harry wasn’t quite sure whether to walk beside Malfoy or behind him. He ended up in a mixture of both, on Malfoy’s left and about a pace behind him. He watched how Malfoy walked - gracefully, his arms loose by his side, shoulders squared and head held high. Harry, next to him, looked even shorter, shoulders curled inwards and generally facing the floor.
Everyone was dying, these days. Harry must think that Remus had abandoned him — but then again, the poor boy was probably used to it. Remus couldn’t do him any good, anyway.
“Are you sure you want to actually go to dinner, Potter? I’m not carrying you down the stairs like a bloody princess,” Draco said for the fifth time, watching Harry with narrowed eyes as Harry put on his shoes.
“I’m so proud of you, my son,” he said, reaching up with one frail hand to cup Draco’s face. Draco carefully schooled his face into a neutral expression, not sure what he felt towards his father. Love, of course, but only the kind that was expected between family. Hatred, at what he’d forced Draco into. Disgust, at the unfounded beliefs he’d drilled into Draco. Draco carefully turned the corners of his mouth upwards into a small smile, forcing his eyes to soften at the edges.
They watched Home Alone, one of James’ favourites (which concerned Harry slightly since he was named after James and Sirius, who were infamous for pulling pranks, and he was Harry’s son, who hadn’t exactly been the most well-behaved student in school) before Draco and Harry had to carry the boys upstairs despite their protests that they could go to the Weasley’s in their pyjamas. Harry went into the bathroom as Draco insisted he could dress the boys, relishing the hot water on his skin before changing into jeans and a hoodie. Draco would be dressed a lot more formally, likely in trousers and a jumper, but at the Weasley’s you dress how you want. Harry emerged still tying his shoulder length hair back in a bun, to see James and Scorpius in miniature versions of his own outfit, and Draco was wearing...jeans.
— give him a hug, maybe? — but Draco vigorously shook his head ‘no’ and she rolled her eyes, straightening.
“It’s a
Malfoy rolled his eyes and snatched the flask from Snape, uncorking it and, surprisingly gently, pouring it’s contents down Harry’s throat.
Or had he?
“Was he awake? You look far too not-hexed for him to have been awake.” Blaise raised an eyebrow.
“Probably live under Dean’s bed at uni.”
Draco shuddered and nodded his assent. Harry quickly returned with two tumblers, each with two fingers of dark caramel coloured liquid.
After the footsteps of everyone had gone up the stairs, Narcissa sat at the table. Before she could say anything, Harry jumped in.
ways of the Slytherins he’s chosen to surround himself with in his youth, but it also tended to catch him off–guard.
- across his back. Harry dutifully started making dinner, burning his hands and wrists a few times. Draco grabbed his wand, ready to heal them, before realising that he couldn’t do anything but watch. He stood next to a large metal box, which Harry had produced food from, watching Harry frantically sprint back and forth between another metal box which he put bread in and the pans on the hob. As Draco watched, the panic calmed, settling into something more along the lines of dread - as if he knew how this was going to play out.
,” scrambling for a foothold in the conversation. He felt malicious glee spread through him as the boy writhed on the floor at his feet. Afterwards, he lay unmoving, his chest barely moving.
He sat there for what seemed like an age, listening to Hermione’s screams, until Wormtail came down. But this time, his hand didn’t strangle him. He grasped Harry’s arm in a painful grip, and dragged him up the stairs.
They knocked out the goblins, and quickly passed the dragon with the clankers. Thanks to Millicent’s knowledge of how the vaults were protected, they didn’t set off the gemino curse, and quickly grabbed the goblet.
Now, he had information that there was to be a Weasley wedding, and that the mudblood was staying at the shack that the Weasleys all lived in. Hopefully there wouldn’t be many people there, but if Voldemort sent all of his followers there, they would be severely outnumbered. Now it was three days since the school term had finished, and a week and a half until the wedding, which meant that they would definitely be there, but no guests would have arrived yet.

Draco was pretty sure words came out of his mouth, because his brain was very much short-circuiting. Throughout the conversation they had been turned towards each other, but Potter had turned a little more, so that his knee was pressed right up against Draco’s. He’d all but ignored Draco’s little jab - it was all harmless teasing at this point, the two of them were friends - of sorts - and had continued to talk about his plans for the weekend. Draco wasn’t listening to any of it; his world had centered to that one point of contact between them. He adamantly refused to look at it, instead softening his gaze and staring into those green eyes, which seemed close enough for Draco to fall into. They weren’t a solid green - the outer ring was a couple of shades lighter, and when the light caught them at just the right angle - like now - they glowed. Between the beautiful eyes and Harry’s unguarded, joyous expression, Draco had no idea how long he could keep up his careless facade.
they’d been talking about beastiality evaded Harry.
Harry and Draco nodded their farewells, gladly accepting when Ron offered to take the basket of leftovers back to the elves and fleeing to their rooms. Harry launched himself onto the far side of his bed, Draco joining him on the other side soon after.
Harry took a couple of steps forward, raising a hand to cup Draco’s jaw. He stood there for an agonisingly long time, Draco remaining perfectly still until he couldn’t bear the tension anymore. Their lips crashed together, and Draco groaned - there was nothing better than this.
“Debatable,” Severus muttered.
“Are we talking today, or over the course of Hogwarts?” Harry found himself feeling increasingly reckless regarding information he revealed about the past, as he grew more comfortable around Draco.
“He might have. We should ask Draco—”
they followed the Dark Lord willingly, after he did this to them on a regular basis, she would never understand.
“Is that all that’s going on? How’s the research going?” Harry asked.
However, she had no idea where Draco and Severus were — and until she did, staying here could probably result in her gaining valuable information for them. Even so, she packed a bag with everything she’d want if she had to leave in a hurry. No need to be unprepared.
Harry didn’t know how long they were duelling before, but eventually he ended up sending
everyone.
He opened it, surprised to see one Remus Lupin collapsed on the floor. He sighed, shook his head and levitated the unconscious man onto the sofa, before shouting for the girls to come downstairs. The twins continued to work at the shop during the day, despite the Ministry having fallen — then again, with their products surrounding them, there was likely nowhere safer. Ron and Hermione said they were somewhere safe, but couldn’t visit at the moment, but while he worried, Bill trusted them. Charlie had gone to Romania for reinforcements, whatever that meant. Fleur’s parents had gone back to France, since they weren’t fighters, and the rest of the order had scattered.
He hadn’t planned for Draco to see his scars, but it hadn’t been as bad as expected. Draco hadn’t expected anything from him - even when Harry had offered, he hadn’t asked anything.
Not until he’d just passed them, and heard a whispered tripping jinx. He fell in an undignified heap, and was then petrified and levitated into an empty classroom.
“Harry, you can walk the halls of this castle despite the war.” He flinched at her harsh tone, but this boy needed it - Draco had been spoiling him, clearly. Not that she could blame him. “I think you can deal with seeing Draco after something that
“That’ll be never, then. Is there any way to get rid of the bond?” Harry asked.
They both crossed their arms, and said “No.” in identical tones.
Everyone nodded, and disappeared to their bedrooms.
“Okay...why don’t you want to go to the Weasley’s?”
During the night, the nightmares seemed to be better as well - they spoke to each other through the bond, knowing that the other was there, which made the entire situation not enjoyable, exactly, but a lot better. Neither of them got an unbroken night’s sleep, but they often fell asleep draped over each other after waking up from the nightmare. Neither of them discussed this, in fear of forcing their own feelings upon the other.
“Mine.”
that handwriting?”
“Fuck off,” Potter spat, his green eyes burning with fury.
They always sat together at the back of the classroom, talking through their bond and not really drawing attention to themselves. Draco was doing one more NEWT than Harry (he wasn’t doing runes at all, it turned out, just very complex arithmancy), so Harry generally spent that time in their room, harassing Draco through the bond with questions his homework or whining
“There’s one I can do which shows the state of a person’s magical core, which will be needed since Potter spent at least six weeks in a cell that drained his magic.”
Since Sirius had died, he hadn’t really spoken to any members of the Order other than Moody for reports. He preferred to live with the wolves, and it wasn’t
shirt he was putting on.
Harry smirked, bringing up those feelings of competitiveness he’d lost - or abandoned - in sixth year. “Scared, Malfoy?”
Draco almost jumped with excitement, having harboured a crush on Potter since seeing those bright green eyes, before coming to his senses.
He took a deep breath, trying to remember what Death had taught him, in the final moments before he’d come back.
On the train, Hermione didn’t really say much, no matter how much Ron tried to coax a conversation out of her. She just couldn’t shake the feeling that something was
, but…
He hadn’t felt anything akin to that for...a while.
Severus nodded thoughtfully. “That’s something to consider. Anyway, around a week after Regulus voiced these second thoughts, he ended up dead. I hadn’t thought anything of it — perhaps he said something to the wrong person. Certainly I mourned, but I thought it was an ordinary death. Apparently I was wrong.”
“Sure.” Draco thrashed Severus in game after game, revelling in the small window of normalcy from their everyday life.
Severus did so, and Remus wasted no time in starting the spell, moving his wand in a series of loops over the mark, his wand leaving a pale purple shimmer in the air in a diamond–like shape, while murmuring under his breath.
Malfoy sighed again. “I suppose.”
“I’ve asked you not to call me Master, Kreacher, and today is just a sad day and I don’t want to be around people. Could I have a bit of food? I don’t want to disrupt anything so I can sit for a bit if you need.”
Once in their room, they stood around awkwardly for about twenty seconds. After dragging Harry back so eagerly, Draco wasn’t sure what he wanted to do.
Voldemort gritted his teeth against the pain, ready for it this time — it felt like his skin was burning, but this was more important. He watched as the boy obsessed over Lucius’ boy — Draco — and tried to convince himself that he loved some red–headed girl. It was a form of occlumency, Voldemort guessed — giving him useless pieces of information to keep the important things hidden. Voldemort tore through the flimsy memories, searching — and here he was with Dumbledore, looking at memories — was that his mother? Never mind that — and here the boy was telling some others — Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger — and the pain was now overwhelming. Voldemort almost pulled out from his mind — but there, in the corner there was a piece of darkness that screamed “home.” Voldemort shot towards it, relishing in the comfort it provided. Then he frowned. Why would one specific part of Potter’s mind be painless, when the rest wasn’t?
The potion flew out of his hand, the cork slipping out as the flask hit Draco square in the chest, the potion splashing on his uniform.
He could barely raise his head as the door creaked open. He heard a thud and a clink, as a bucket and a plate were placed on the floor.
“What do I have to do?” Harry knew, and was pretty sure Voldemort knew too, that Harry would to anything to save his friends. No reason to hide that.
Harry had, surprisingly, enjoyed sitting next to Draco yesterday. He hadn’t realised how much he missed sarcasm until talking to him. Not to mention, despite the fact that they’d barely even talked, he’d felt more like a part of a conversation than he ever did with Ron and Hermione.
at the youngest child without a glance. Draco flinched backwards, trying to think of a way to end the unforgivable without actually attacking Lucius. The most humane thing Draco could think of was killing the girl — but he couldn’t do that. Could he?
TW: some death (I.e. recap of Dumbles’ death from the first chapter, and another description by someone. Not too gory, though).
“You promised.”
“Yes.” The first word Malfoy said since coming into the house was laced with defiance, his stance shifting into something slightly more hostile, even as most of his weight was still on Snape.
Kingsley and his most trusted aurors had gathered in one group, and the Hogwarts Professors had gathered in another, along with Snape. The Weasleys sat around Remus — Draco had once again stayed behind with Harry, who was improving considerably. He still hadn’t gone downstairs, but he often went outside onto a balcony, which had appeared after Harry had wandered down the corridor, and sat on a rickety chair for an hour while watching the busy London street.
“If you could stop gloating for a second…” Hermione glared at Ron, who shut up and made a ‘go on’ gesture at her.
“Lovely ending, that.” Harry shivered.
Severus rolled his eyes, and headed to the kitchen.
Not seeing any reason to beat around the bush, Draco took a deep breath, “Does Potter like me…romantically?”
“Traitor.” Draco ruffled Scorpius’ hair, putting him on the ground to toddle to the house. Even after all these years, all the Weasleys and Harry congregated at the Burrow every other Sunday for lunch if they could.
“Freak.” The fat man spat at Harry, sliding the belt through the loops on his trousers without even cleaning it. He went back into the house with a smile on his face, saying something - Draco couldn’t hear - and the family happily left, leaving Harry on the floor. His eyes were glassy, staring at nothing, his back bled freely and a feeling of hopelessness engulfed Draco, as he tried one more time to go to Harry, to comfort him,
Naricissa raised an eyebrow. “Well, have you checked the bank ledgers?”
He’d hurriedly pulled on a pair of dark blue jeans that were scuffed, but not quite ripped (yet) and a dark grey hoodie. He then pulled on a pair of odd socks - one was bright blue with a snitch pattern, and the other was Chudley Cannons orange - both clearly presents from Ron.
Harry rolled his eyes and got to his feet, determinedly hiding the slight sway as blood rushed from his head. He was quite sure Draco noticed anyway, but he headed to the door, glaring at Draco, who was standing next to it. “I’m going downstairs.”
to slipping off Draco’s left shoulder, exposing all of his left collarbone and most of his right one, and all Harry could think about was running his tongue along it, leaving little bit marks as he went-
“Wait,” Hermione said. “If Ron gives you a piece of paper with the address for Grimmauld, you’ll all be able to stay here. The house is huge, and Kreacher has been really good lately — he’d be able to sort out a few rooms for everyone.”
“You weren’t supposed to

catastrophe. Hermione could bring him his work, and teach him - she’d probably jump at the chance to learn the work better anyway.
Nagini was a few seconds away from striking.
Hermione peered at Harry. “Did you hit your head while fighting Voldemort? Brain damage sounds like a real possibility.”
Just as the aurors thawed, Bill and Percy disappeared, appearing into the middle of chaos.
Rubbing his arm — apparently she’d elbowed harder than Draco had noticed — he sighed and said, “I guess I forgive you too. The apology was very much appreciated though.” He turned around and opened a cupboard, pulling out a bag of flour.
Harry turned onto his back, and cried out in pain as a wound, or many wounds, split open from the movement. Harry sat up, whimpering at the pain, feeling blood trickle down his back, arms flying out in every direction.
TW: killing people, graphic description of Harry being tortured (so the usual amiright)
“I did not.” Draco continued looking down his nose at Harry.
I’ve got all the paperwork from the ministry — you can officially enter the property.”
“Did I sleepwalk here?”
“You’re doing my glamours every morning from now on.”
“We’re — almost — there,” Severus replied. “Open the gate!”
“The Dark Lord preferred to keep me out of operations, but I do know the basic goals — gain control of the Ministry, which he’s done. Through that, he’ll gain control of Hogwarts, and then use Ministry documents and resources to hunt down muggleborns, before enslaving or exterminating the muggles.”
“Ron!” Harry jumped up and hugged Ron. “Are all of you okay?”
Draco sent down the bond, not having to fully occlude this time.
Draco whined into Harry’s head, leaning back on his chair and staring up on the ceiling as he did so.
Everyone got in easily enough, and went around their daily jobs. Albert Runcorn was knocked out using the twins’ fainting fancies, and against popular opinion (“obliviate him and send him on a one–way portkey to Argentina”, suggested by Ron, had been most popular by a landslide), would be released back into London after the mission was completed. Snape went to Runcorn’s office and had a snoop around, but didn’t find anything other than a disturbing amount of anti–muggleborn propaganda, and some homosexual erotic magazines. Interesting information, but not useful for the mission.
“I think so,” Harry said, taking the flask. He put a finger to his temple and thought very hard about the cave, immersing himself in the memory — the scent of mildew and stale water, the dampness of the cave that made his palms sweaty, the sound of the water gently lapping against the rocks, the dim, green light, seemingly appearing from nowhere, that bathed everything in a sickly light. Quickly running through the events — swimming to the cave, Dumbledore opening the entrance, the boat ride, the potion, Dumbledore’s death, Voldemort’s arrival, all the way through to the stupefy, Harry gently pulled the silvery thread from his head, frowning at it before depositing it in the flask.
“No idea. You know you’re going to go down to the Hall at some point, your friends are worried.”
“Well wear this then.” Draco walked off, and Harry sat on his bed, eyes following him curiously as he crouched down next to his bed, seeker reflexes catching a green shirt hurled at him over Draco’s shoulder.
“We’re here!”
Remus breathed in the fresh air, deliberately ignoring the memories of coming down to the beach with Sirius, back when everything was okay. Well, as okay as it
This chapter contains graphic descriptions of self-harm. From Draco’s point of view, it starts at “Shaking, he looked at his arm” and finishes at “Thank Merlin Harry was still alive.” From Harry’s point of view, it starts at “He panicked again when he saw the empty bed, the open trunk” through to the end. All of these phrases are in bold, and there will be a brief description in the notes at the end of what happened.
did he freeze? He’d just figured out that he liked Draco, and now he’s scared him away for good. He walked the route to the Slytherin common room under his invisibility cloak, but unless Draco casts one hell of a disillusionment charm he must have ran all the way down.
“Are you telling the truth?”
Voldemort straightened and snarled. “I can beat you regardless.”
Draco glanced between the two men and the book. Deciding the expressions Severus was trying to hide were much more interesting than a book he could read later, he watched his godfather.
After taking account of his surroundings, he’d realised that he must have been feeling this through the bond. The pain was mediocre for Harry at worst, but it was clearly an echo of what Draco was feeling, and getting worse - Draco definitely had some broken bones.
Draco didn’t quite pull away, allowing Harry to make the next move. Harry didn’t hesitate, surging upwards, his arms wrapping around Draco and his fingers digging into the soft material of the jumper that started it all, their mouths clashing together with fiery passion, and Harry knew all in the moment that this was what was meant to be.
Harry snorted softly, grabbing a third piece of toast and slathering it with what Draco would call “too much jam”.
Despite giving Bellatrix and Fenrir access to the door, only Lucius had been delivering his food. Likely a punishment by Voldemort.
at him, and reopened the two matching cuts on his cheeks — Bellatrix really had gone all out. In fact, now that he knew the boy wouldn’t die, she could go back down and let off some steam. Fenrir too.
“Very. And call me Harry, you prat.”
“Little shit.” Lucius sneered one last time before sweeping up the stone stairs. Harry rolled his eyes, shivering violently as the obtrusive prickle of magic left, leaving him with a bone deep chill despite it being the height of summer.
He had to get home.
“A bit difficult to do that while on the run from...everybody.” Potter shook his head, his hair flopping everywhere, then ran a hand through it, making it messier. He hadn’t picked up that habit until fifth year, Draco had noted, and always been rather confused since he knew that hadn’t been Potter’s best year. Maybe it was a nervous habit? But then why on Earth would he bite his nails…
her, but I think she was the one who hid it. Then Nagini is one—”
“What are you getting at, Luna?”
Draco shouted at Harry down the bond.
“Those ones over there are the Lestrange vaults, and these ones are the Black ones. If we work together, it would only take a few hours.”
Draco took Wea- Ron’s hand, shaking it once before saying to the couple:
“Yes, ‘that bloody snake’. The last one is at Hogwarts, but I’m not sure where.”
Harry sighed - he didn’t want to have to order Kreacher to do anything he didn’t want to, and Kreacher enjoyed calling Harry ‘Master’ to spite him so he tolerated it. “That’s fine, Kreacher.” Harry leaned against the wall, a glass of pumpkin juice in hand (it had floated right to him straight after his and Kreacher’s conversation) and let his mind drift again. No sooner had he zoned out than the door opened, revealing Draco, who was clearly trying to hide how out of breath he was by taking overly slow, deep ones. However, the blush on his pale cheeks betrayed his exertion.
Harry deflated, as if he’d been expecting this. He went and sat on his bed, head in his hands. Draco went and sat next to him, and rather daringly, he thought, put his hand on Harry’s back, rubbing small circles into it.
So Harry gets woken up by Vernon Dursley, pretty much a similar drill to the start of the Philisopher’s Stone (Harry is forced to make them breakfast). Because he’s so small, he burns his hand and wrists on the hob, and despite rushing around and trying to make everything perfect it burns anyway. The scene ends with him being whipped by Vernon, being spat on and called a freak. During this, he thinks he sees Draco, but dismisses it as his imagination. The scene is also described from Draco’s POV, who was actually there but viewing it similarly to a pensive memory in that people in the memory couldn’t see him and he couldn’t manipulate the situation in any way.
“Neither are you.”
Overall, Draco and Hermione had apparently found that the meal a great success for everyone involved, and started dragging Harry to at least one meal a day, often two. Harry found that he was referring to ‘Draco and Hermione’ an unnerving amount in regards to his friends - the pair had found a person to talk to about academic…
, Ronald, we could
Once they were at the common room, everyone collapsed in the chairs closest to the fire in a large circle. Harry looked at the large gathering of people - it was one thing on the tables in the dining room, where he could only see three or four people at a time, but the large circle, that many eyes on him if he talked - his blood started pounding in his ears and he started sweating.
“I wanted to do a muggle degree in art, but I’m not sure how to get in with wizarding qualifications” Dean looked contemplative rather than down heartened at the obstacle.

“Oh come on, get on with it.” Harry rolled his eyes as Draco’s gaze flicked from his face, and back to the cut, still not making any move to do the spell. “Scared, Malfoy?”

That was one thing that was good about Draco leaving — he wouldn’t
Draco sneered, the tips of his ears turning pink. “As if you don’t know how I have my toast.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Kreacher, describe the locket to me, please.”

wasn’t happening; he was back with his old, yew wand, which did serve him better, even if it made his magic feel weaker, after Dumbledore’s wand. A quick flick of his wand had the inferi he’d hidden pouring out into the hallway, which was too narrow for any sort of fire to be used without the risk of hurting allies. He ordered them to attack all but him and Potter — Potter was
Voldemort coughed as he walked into a dusty room. “Don’t use this room often, do we?”
Hermione hummed, gazing at the wall.
“Would you like to have a little bit of fun?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry looked over his shoulder a couple of times, as if to check if Draco was still there, before striding into the common room, Draco following three steps behind.
“No you don’t. You could just stay here with us.” Conan put a hand on Remus’ shoulder, and he almost melted into the touch — he didn’t like Conan romantically; — he didn’t like
Draco was greeted by closed drapes. He sighed and put the food on the bedside table - Harry had taken a muffin, which was good - vanishing the food from the night before and taking a piece of bread for himself.
Ron stumbled through the door, bracing a hand against the doorway to stop himself from being flung into the dining table. “What’s this about a bloody trap? Tell us what happened!”
However, the first weekend of October, Harry had another nightmare which affected him as badly as the one with the Dursley’s.
“Be glad that I remembered to put it on,” Harry muttered, sliding the tie under his collar and tying it.
“Half an hour, my Lord.”
Hermione grimaced. “I suppose you have a point.”
Harry knew it was bad to rely on Draco so heavily - but while he was getting better, it couldn’t hurt, could it?
Harry continued, probably not oblivious to Draco’s reaction but talking anyway. “You were there, and
After about 30 seconds of very hard concentration (and a small amount of Occlumency to spare him from other distractions) he successfully filled the glass. Now that he had the technique, it wasn’t very difficult to vanish it.
Harry’s neck cracked as he lifted his head, blinking blearily at the figures outside his cell. There were two - one of them was probably Lucius, to open the door.
Otters made of fire sprung out of her wand, and engulfed the small bag. Ron thought he heard screaming, and tightened his grip on Hermione’s hand, but didn’t apparate them away.
“Of course, darling,” she said, running a hand down his back.
Hermione smiled at Ron, before turning back to the family. “I think, at the very least, we should send a letter to Harry. Just to find out what’s going on. We can put concealment spells on the owl and the letter to stop it from being seen, and finally get word because it’s driving me out of my mind.”
- to Harriet, for putting up with me ignoring you on our discord calls and my delusional rambling.  I love you very much and you’d better fucking know.
Just before she left, Harry pulled Luna aside.
That Friday night, the situation was indeed revealed to be too good to be true, to mini-Snape-in-Harry’s-head’s satisfaction.
Harry huffed and rolled his eyes, looking sideways at his classmates. Indeed, a few of them were staring at him with narrowed eyes, the most worrying of which being Hermione.
Ron quickly scribbled down the address on a piece of paper, and handed it to Narcissa, who hurried outside.
Draco joined them for dinner, nobody looking particularly surprised, integrating Draco into their conversations quite easily. Once, Harry was asked a question he didn’t have an answer to, and he felt his heart rate rising, his palms sweating. He needn’t have worried, however, as Draco smoothly inserted himself into the conversation and drawing the focus away from Harry, nudging Harry slightly with his knee as he did so. Harry would have thought it accidental except he knew Draco calculated his every move in public - there weren’t huge differences, but to Harry, Draco was clearly different here compared to how he was in the dorm.
After a week, the Carrows had caught onto their ‘games’ and were ordering the Slytherins to physically beat people in detention. Getting three broken ribs healed in the hospital wing, courtesy of Goyle, Ginny decided that it was time to do…
Sitting there, grinning like a loon at Draco while stuffing half a sausage in his mouth, Harry felt...free. To be himself.
, the
She walked upstairs on silent feet as they were dismissed, and considered leaving then and there. Without Draco coming back, there was nothing keeping her tied here.
“I’d have to agree - I’ve never been much of a social butterfly, never mind what my father tried to forge me into.”
“Hey guys,” Harry said, and promptly fainted.
His front was littered with scars, not as many as his back but still more than an eighteen-year-old should have. Over his heart, there was a second, white, lightning-bolt scar. Draco took another step forward, so he was a foot away from Harry.
He walked to the dining room, clipping his heels on the floor as he went. No reason to sneak in, considering that since Lucius had fucked up Snape was now the Dark Lord’s prized possession.
“Oh yes, honey, we just want to talk. Come out, come out!”
, and gasped — he hadn’t put very much power into it, but the lumos had glowed brighter than he could have expected. So
“Or water, I suppose.” Pansy had taken her hands off her hips to pick at her nails.
Leaving them in the wall, she produced two more knives, stepping closer to Harry. He didn’t flinch, staring deep into those unnervingly emotionless eyes.
One of the corners of Harry’s mouth twitched. “How lovely.”
Maybe he was a freak after all.
Hermione had clearly been listening, but Ron saw that she still found it difficult to tear her gaze away from Harry. Ron wasn’t surprised — he’d expected him to look bad, but he was covered in dried blood, his clothes were dirty and torn, his hair was limp and greasy and his face was hollow. His clothes were even baggier than normal, hanging limply off his skinny frame, and Ron shuddered to think of what damage had been done underneath.
“Shut up Pansy, I’m hungry.”
, the spell revealing no one else. Next she called Kreacher, summoning Harry’s letter from her bag — he grumbled, but Harry had apparently phrased it correctly as he obeyed her orders to tell her about the wards on the townhouse.
He insulted Potter, so that he didn’t betray his true feelings, but was shocked when instead of a snarky comment, Potter's croaky voice, not unlike that of his elf, simply told him the truth. Since when had they become such good friends? Draco decided he must be delirious from a lack of food all day, as he hadn’t been to any meals and Draco hadn’t seen the other two thirds of the golden trio not-so-subtly sneaking out food.
“Hello Draco. Harry.”
“Out with it, Hermione.”
A huge grin plastered on his face, Draco practically skipped to the Slytherin table, almost knocking Pansy off her seat with his newfound energy.
Hermione looked at Harry with wide, earnest eyes. “We thought you were off with Dumbledore at the time, but then with everything we must have just
“Harry?” Draco tried to keep how hurt he was inside, to not portray any emotions on his face.
The meal, while cut short, had really inspired Harry, who decided to take a running leap into ‘normal’ life. The day after the meal, he found a wand from
Kreacher appeared with a
“Tut, tut, tut, boy, practically giving away your position with that racket…”
Bill glanced at Fleur, who nodded, and wiped his eyes. “Be our secret keeper. For — for Shell Cottage?”
“It’s a good idea, but…would you guys be okay with it? And the twins, where would they stay?” Remus asked.
“They can make a miraculous comeback!”), and Ron wasn’t glaring at Draco at all, which was more than Harry could have ever hoped for.
Despite his annoyance at Draco’s attitude, he obeyed his orders, retrieving an untarnished silver cauldron from the back of the classroom (he was terrible at potions but he

Harry flooed into Hogwarts at quarter to six - he wouldn’t be the first one there but would still have time to adjust.

Harry was livid.

members of the Order, so I figured they should be updated on…current events.” She shot an unsubtle glance at Draco and Severus.
The group wandered down to Hogsmeade, spending a large amount of time in Zonko’s, by request of Ginny and Seamus, and then Hogsmeade, where Ron bought half of the shop and Harry, Ginny, Seamus and Dean split the other half. Sucking on sparkling sherbets (“They make your eyes sparkle for a few hours, depending on the colour apparently - the closer they are to a precious metal or mineral the longer they sparkle.” Neville had read off the packet), the group then jogged down to The Three Broomsticks with their jackets held over their heads in the drizzle.
I hope everyone's staying safe! <33
Voldemort gazed at his old wand, for a moment. It had served him well — allowed him to get this far. And it had been the first thing he’d gotten from the wizarding world — the first physical sign he was special. But he’d always
“I agree, but there’s nothing we can do, for now.” Severus sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose and glaring at the floor, his mind whirling with possibilities. He could easily fight his way out, especially with Draco by his side, who wasn’t bad at duelling; but dragging Potter along with them would be difficult. At the very least…
Draco frantically stuffed clothes into a magically expanded bag, scooping them out of his wardrobe and stuffing them into the opening. He’d already added all of his books, shoes, and everything that he wanted, leaving his room disconcertingly bare. He cringed as he thought of the creases —
The toll the cell was taking on his magic was becoming steadily obvious — Harry found that, when he was awake, he could feel the magic of whoever come down the stars - it stung against his skin, like a thousand tiny needles.
After a quick breakfast, they ran back up to the dorms as neither of the boys had thought to bring down their money (“Honestly, I don’t know how you’re going to pass your NEWTs with this level of organisation.”
A heavy silence settled around the table.
Draco felt a boot literally kick him up the backside. Then they were coming from all angles - on his legs, his ribs, his face.
“Firstly, I don’t do stealthy. And secondly...shut up, Draco.”
Harry pulled back into his own mind, looking into concerned, blue eyes. “H–he knows. We need to hurry.”
A flicker of hope went through the bond, as Harry made eye contact with Draco - and Draco shouted, screamed Harry’s name, hoping he could hear - but the green eyes just moved away, and after one final lash he collapsed, his back bleeding out onto the pavement.
“Yeah, a Portkey — give me your hand.”
“No, no thank you. I think I’m going to head off to bed. Thank you,” he added, as Remus turned to leave, “I — I genuinely cannot express my gratitude enough.”
“Better, Harry?” Draco asked gently, and Harry sat up, surprised. Draco’s hand stopped moving, in fear — maybe he shouldn’t have talked? Harry needed to heal, and being paranoid about Draco’s weirdness wasn’t going to help—
“I’m gonna call Sev — we should look at your core while you’re awake. Do
“‘E’s go’ a poin’. Loo’ a’ all ‘is foo’!” Ron said, mouth already full of roast beef and potatoes. Harry loaded his plate with small amounts of everything, extra bread and a few little packets of butter. Why the elves served butter in little packets Harry didn’t know, but he wasn’t complaining now.
Draco was floating on a cloud.
Harry dried his eyes, sighed and lifted his head up, re-casting his glamour. He hadn’t talked to Malfoy since charms this morning - not that he’d been planning to. He cancelled the silencing charm and opened his drapes. “Yes?”
Okay, a few things:
Ron watched in horror as Ginny tripped over a tree root, and time slowed.
Bill nodded and passed his bag to Remus. “See you in a bit.” Then he ran out, as the other six touched their portkeys and disappeared from the room.
They appeared a couple of seconds later in a flurry of sand. Severus glanced down and saw little granules at the bottom of his robes, so he cast a quick
“That
The hand on his shoulder gently squeezed. It was exactly what Harry needed; it was a reminder, that Draco was here for him.
Harry grimaced, already feeling the potion working its magic, once again shivering as he fell into a restless sleep.
Voldemort hissed.
“Well one’s soulmate almost dying can do wonders for one’s sleep schedule, I’ve heard.”

, because he is a Malfoy.
“I mean, it is found in a book of children’s stories.”
“How can you come up with stuff like this, and yet be so terrible at chess?” Ron asked, earning him a kick in the shin from Hermione, and Ginny to snicker beside her.
charms on their shoes before trudging down the muddy track.
“I’ll go tomorrow.”
Sighing, he looked over at Draco. They were both doing homework at their respective desks - Harry on the second half of his transfiguration essay, cursing his past self for not finishing it before, and Draco on his arithmancy (probably - there were a lot of numbers, but there were also some odd symbols that could be runes). Harry had almost finished, just a conclusion to do, but Draco seemed engrossed in his work, furiously scribbling, his cramped, scruffy handwriting nothing like the calligraphy Harry had noticed before. White teeth nibbled on his lower lip, which was slowly turning red, and his eyes narrowed in concentration as he reached a particularly difficult sum (translation? Harry genuinely had no idea).
Harry nodded in agreement, jumping slightly as Draco’s knee knocked against his own under the table as he sat down.
Voldemort grimaced as he exited the cold water, glad that none of his followers saw his swimming. He dried himself with a flick of his wand — originally, the anti-apparation wards had
Nothing particularly eventful had happened in Arithmancy - he’d sat alone, in the corner, and taken notes, not really contributing, not drawing any negative attention. The usual.

“I take it you two had the same idea as me?” Draco asked, gesturing to the eggs and sugar on the table.
Draco out of the Hall.
“Because those are the fucking rules, Ron!”
“I require use of the library.”
Harry watched the colours undulate for a few seconds, before noticing a thin, white thread trailing off. He frowned, his eyes trailing along it, only to find out that it led to Malfoy, who was staring at it in horror.
wasn’t going to test on anyone else — the idea of harming anyone in the house made him shudder. Even Ron, to his surprise.
“That’s fine - he’ll know where to get them. You’re dismissed - I’ll call you afterwards.”
Despite being prepared, Harry jumped when Draco walked in, and was even more surprised when Draco appeared to be unharmed. “Why don’t you look hurt? I felt -“
He’d been hexed on the way to breakfast, charms, and was currently suffering a stinging hex in an
— but it wasn’t there, or there was something blocking him — a veil, a film that kept him from escaping. He pushed against it harder, as Bellatrix came around the corner, knives already in hand throwing them as she walked towards Harry. They all struck true — in his arms, his legs, his abdomen. As he curled in on himself, he was suddenly hoisted up by ropes, a canvas ready for Bellatrix’s knives, warm blood already pouring down his body through open wounds that slowly widened as his arms were pulled away from his body.
After eating his fill (one muffin and half of a piece of bread) Harry closed his draped and resumed his vigil of staring at the wall.
The diary…he should never have been so
“I can’t apparate.” Harry sighed, before looking at Malfoy, who looked oddly pensive. “Any ideas, Malfoy?”
“Of course not. How’s Ron?”

Draco pulled Harry into his side and pressed a kiss to his temple. “For you, always.”
“You said ministry documents — so if we destroyed those, we could slow him down?” Ron asked hopefully.
The letter was from Ginny, who assured them that she was in hiding with

Harry took three deep breaths while counting to ten. As he watched, no stray hexes came near him - no one so much as looked at him. In his mind, he retreated to the edge of his mind, where the bond left, bathing in the warm emotions Draco radiated, not particularly registering them but just revelling in the fact that they were

Ron grinned. “That was easy. At this rate, we’ll be finished by Christmas.”

do. We need a silver one, preferably untarnished, though it won’t affect it much if it has a bit of tarnish.”
He curled up in the corner, on his bed, which was a lot harder than he’d remembered. He flinched as the door shut, leaving him in a tiny, lightless box. He shut his eyes as tightly as possible, rocking back and forth, wishing frantically for someone,
he did, since he couldn’t see him — and Harry’s body was hoisted over Severus’s shoulder as they started to run up the stone stairs, their heavy footsteps and breathing no longer hidden by the muffling charms. They tore through the entrance hall, Draco almost falling down the steps outside of the door. He thought he just might make it, before he heard a loud screech.
“We need to — we can’t stay here all day.” Ron’s words barely penetrated the heavy silence.
“And you won’t, because I’ve been taught how to duel, and I’ll just stay in the Room anyway. I just need to close all the loopholes, I’ll be fine.”
Harry had sent down the bond
“Yeah.” Ron nodded. “And
the blood from the floor, the knife, and the rest of Draco’s body.
Shaking himself out of his stupor, Weasley also stuck out his hand, and said “Same sentiment. Call me Ron.”
Fleur’s parents arrived two days later, listening to their daughter’s story in rapid fire french and consoling her. The presence of her parents rejuvenated Fleur, who cleaned the house like a demon. This in turn made the other inhabitants guiltily help out, the wedding preparations coming along surprisingly well.
Narcissa inclined her head. “Hello, Kreacher. It is nice to see you in good spirits.”
Bill chuckled weakly, passing the letter to Ginny, who had been holding her hand out expectantly.
He’d grown up on fairy tales about soulmates - they always started with some made-up artefact, or spell which decidedly didn’t work, but it wasn’t those that had enraptured Draco. It had been the relationships - he’d always been a romantic (and always tried to hide it), and he’d always dreamed of having a soulmate. In his head it was a whirlwind romance - a brief, pure blood courtship, filled with flowers and presents, confirmed by a kiss under the stars. As he’d aged, he’d dreamed of being swept into Potter - no, Harry’s arms - Harry protecting him from Slytherin’s monster, from Black, being swept into Harry’s arms after one of his tasks in fourth year.
“You won’t
Then he turned his gaze on Draco. He was bent over a piece of parchment covered in numbers, his hair turning golden much like it did in the light of the potions classroom. The normally harsh angles of his cheekbones, chin and jaw were softened in the peach-coloured light, and his grey eyes were warm as they stared at the parchment. His pink lips, sucking gently on the raven-feather quill, looked inviting, begging to be-
“No, no, do continue your rant,” Harry said, smirking.
Draco sat on a rock, watching the sun set behind the Forbidden Forest. He loved the image of black silhouettes on a sunset background - there was something about the crisp lines and block colour over a gradient that appealed to him. When the sky was mostly a dark blue-grey, surprisingly not revealing many stars, Draco headed back up to the school, shivering slightly. He walked quickly through the common room - now, rather than glaring at him, everyone ignored him, which Draco preferred - and walked into their room. The drapes around Potter’s bed were tightly closed, and there was a strong silencing charm around them.
“You can
He sunk into the bath, wincing as hot water bit at his wounds. It wasn’t too bad though; he’d

Satisfied they were safe, she cast two discrete

His glamours had fallen, and Potter looked…
Draco was now staring at him with wide, grey eyes, which shone like quicksilver in the flickering light of the torches. His head was tilted slightly as he ran his tongue along his lower lip, and any chance of Harry answering like a
The Weasel was looking extremely guilty as well.
Hermione narrowed her eyes, clearly noticing the topic change but likely just happy that Harry wasn’t obsessing over Malfoy like he did in sixth year.
Still, it could have been a lot worse — he got to do what he loved most, and nobody actively hated him; not even Ron and Ginny, who were quickly warming up to him, even if neither initiated conversations.
He followed Granger and the Weasel out of the common room - the redhead was whining about food, while Granger fondly shook her head. At least, if he was following them, he wouldn’t have to worry about people noticing the door opening randomly.
. It was a bit longer, and had odd knots, with runes carved in it towards the bottom.
“VOLDEMORT IS COMING!”

“Well there are apprenticeships to become a master of herbology that I’ve been looking into. I’ve applied to a couple that go to the rainforest in South America.” Neville glowed at the idea.
Draco wrapped an arm around Harry’s waist. “Of course.”

“Sure. Now
“Are you sure M–Draco and Harry will be okay?” Ron asked.
“Alright, let’s do this then. I need a knife.” Malfoy held out his hand expectantly.
“He gave Potter his magic using the

Draco had raised his wand again, and Harry nearly sagged in relief, before he saw his stare of horror and realised that he was being controlled similar to how Harry was. Harry tried his best to make it easy for Draco, trying his best not to flinch at the green light, but in his last moments of consciousness as he fell he couldn’t help but worry about Draco - what would happen to him, what would Voldemort do, knowing that he’d had to control Draco?
“Maybe we should let him go up.” Theo said, looking at them from over the top of his book.
Harry sighed, slumping further. “I know. I just...don’t want to be there. I don’t want to talk to anyone.”
“We’ll go for a drink in the Three Broomsticks, you two have your date.” Harry grinned as the pair smiled in relief and made a beeline for the little pink cafe.
Voldemort quickly repeated the same process with the mudblood, pleased to hear that she hadn’t told anyone else. And since Potter hadn’t told anyone, and Dumbledore was dead...his secret was safe. Slughorn may suspect, but that idiot wouldn’t say anything, at the very least due to his Slytherin self-preservation instincts. If he even remembered.
A small funeral was held the next day in the back garden of the Burrow, where Tonks’ body was lain in fresh earth. Several people delivered moving eulogies, but no one had really gotten over their grief when they had to get to work.
would. Malfoy was his nemesis, a boy who was nothing but sneers and mean comments. Draco wouldn’t tell anyone. Not Draco who was crying on Harry’s shoulder, not Draco who had sat with Harry for half an hour, until he calmed down.
“Ever the Gryffindor. You can’t do anything, you’re in a cell.”
He woke up again when painful magic — three sources of them — entered the room. His mind was still foggy, but he tried to keep still as they settled at the end of his bed, the magic pricking his mind like thorns. He tried to focus on the warmth of the nice magic, the magic that allowed him to feel more relaxed than he had in weeks. Regardless of how much pain the other magics caused him, he was in a much better place than before.
Harry could have sworn he saw a flicker of blonde hair, out of the corner of his eye, and a flicker of hope lit in his chest. He turned his head - maybe they were just out of his line of vision, maybe if Vernon saw them he would stop.
“With stupid amounts of raspberry jam and no butter,” Harry immediately replied, feeling his face grow warm under Draco’s triumphant gaze.
“No need to be embarrassed, Ron, I
They stood like that for a little while, watching Harry run between the basin and Dumbledore. They watched him keel over, Hermione making a small noise and burying her face into Ron’s shoulder. They watched as Harry bent down to check — and dropped his wand, the git. A flash of light illuminated the cave, and Ron and Hermione almost lost their footing when they spun around.
Potter, Draco finally did a diagnosis spell to see Potter’s physical injuries. They were terrible — not only were there several broken ribs and fractures in his tibula, he had several very deep cuts that weren’t going to heal easily, and evidence of very old injuries. Sure, he knew that Potter hadn’t had the
Severus refrained from sighing, before turning to the Dark Lord and saying in a low voice “my Lord, I know he was less than useless on the raid, but he may have...other uses.”
Harry raised an eyebrow, saying “jeans? When did hell freeze over?”
The end of Draco’s wand glowed a faint green, but the spider didn’t even flinch. Just sat there in its web, taunting him.
“Odds on there being inferi?” Ron muttered.
“It seems a shame to destroy it — it
Kreacher had been very helpful - he always seemed to know what Harry had needed, whether it be a cup of chamomile tea (it tasted disgusting, but always calmed him down), a hot meal, or something to blow up. Harry had especially enjoyed blasting the wall which Walburga Black’s portrait had been on, and Kreacher had been surprisingly amicable to Harry destroying some Black family heirlooms. Of course, he insisted on keeping some, but there were many even Kreacher had found distasteful - the first things to go had been the decapitated house elf heads that had once lined the stairs.
(Let’s not focus on Draco’s much quieter, much more excited crisis, dispelling any fantasies he might have had not involving Potter.)
Ron suddenly burst through the door, holding a tarnished, silver pensieve. “Could probably use a couple of polishing spells, but should be fine to use — there was no dark magic around it, or anything.”

He killed them too.
crush on Harry — maybe something more — based on the longing looks when Harry’s head was turned, how he encouraged Harry to eat a few more bites, how his gaze flickered down and back up again, sometimes. Harry was just as bad, and Severus found it
They made quick work of the food, eating in silence, before Bill and Fleur side–alonged Ginny and Remus, who didn’t know the location.
“I can look after myself—” Fleur started, but Bill cut her off.
He leaned back against his headboard, staring at the photo with him on a broomstick, at the life he could have had. A life full of happiness and unconditional love.
“You–Know–Who was after me and ‘Mione.” He lifted his chin, and even as tears lined his eyes, his voice held steady. “They polyjuiced into us and sacrificed their lives instead, because me and Hermione have information that can defeat him.”
“Give me that invisibility cloak of yours - I know you have it - and I’ll get you some food from the kitchen.” Potter rolled his eyes, but clearly knew when he was beat, and gestured towards his bag. Draco pulled out the silken material, wrapped it around himself, and said “I’ll be back soon. I can’t believe you’re making me do this. Git.”
“I’ve got to go.” Harry sprinted out of the room, all the way to the dorms. A couple of people yelled at him as he sprinted through the common room, but he ignored them in favour of locking himself in his bathroom, casting a hasty silencing charm and hurling his guts out into  a toilet.
Emotion...this was human. He’d read that while emotion could be imitated by magic, it couldn’t be properly rendered by anything that wasn’t living. And Draco certainly wasn’t bonded to an animal.
, and Bill winced as he looked at Percy, who was wearing a cold smile.
As a purple spell from Fleur barely missed Ginny’s ear — she’d promised not to use anything lethal, but she was also getting increasingly angrier as Ginny kept slipping away, her Veela powers flaring in a silvery glow, and Remus was getting concerned — Remus stepped in, casting two shield charms. “I think that’s enough for today.”
“Well I haven’t had much to eat over the past six weeks. One slice feels like plenty, now.” Harry shrugged.
Blaise had taken forty minutes to get ready, meaning they would arrive at the peak breakfast time.
Ginny’s grin had a wicked edge as Bill sighed in defeat behind her.
to break into Gringotts, so any aspiring, reckless Gryffindor could likely break in as well. The diadem — well, there was nowhere safer than that undiscovered room, and he doubted anyone would notice it, never mind realise what it actually was. Everyone who knew about the Horcruxes was either incapacitated, or dead, and yet Voldemort couldn’t shake the feeling that he would have to look after them better. Well, he had Nagini, and would soon have the cup in the Manor with him. He’d have to take down the Ministry first — then he would be able to do what he wanted.
“How?” Ginny asked, looking up with watery, brown eyes.
Afterwards they headed up to the room, Harry in the middle of a large throng of Gryffindors. He hadn’t been approached by anyone who wasn’t his friend yet, but based on what happened on the one outing to Diagon Alley that Harry went on it wouldn’t be long before the crowds got braver. Harry decided to enjoy the peace as much as he could, while it lasted.
“Penny for your thoughts?” Severus drawled after several moments.
“Harry — need — Kreacher — locket — nest—”
Harry. The
“I just want to see him, make sure he’s okay—”
I’m going to spend the next week writing headcanons and short fics on tumblr, so if you have any requests please send them :)
Harry reached up to wipe his mouth, immediately staring at his arm in surprise. “That’s fast acting.” He grinned — his voice was by no means back to normal, but it was ten times better than before. It suddenly occurred to him that he’d just been rescued by the two people he’d hated most at Hogwarts. Other than Umbridge. And Crouch Junior. And Quirrell. Still quite high up.
Once, something warm settled against his skin — something like home. He’d cautiously ventured forwards out of his mind, looking out of eyes that didn’t feel like his own — but no one was there. Shying away from the pain, he retreated.
“Narcissa! What are you doing here?” Severus asked. Narcissa started to respond, but was cut off by Remus.
“Brilliant. How do I tell you? Do I point at it? Do I just say ‘Shell Cottage?’”
the pensieve liquid — I didn’t even know that was
“I do, my lord.”
Draco pulled back, looking into those bloodshot green eyes, and while he was pretty sure he knew the answer, he asked “lunch?”
Maybe he heard the whisper of quiet footsteps. Maybe not.
“Do you want some more sleep? There are a load of spare bedrooms now.”

plan!” Draco protested.
“Yes you can. You’re going to sit with me and tolerate all of Flitwick’s eccentricities.”
“I refuse to call someone by their first name when their tie isn’t even tied.” Draco wrinkled his nose at Harry’s collar, where his tie was slung loosely around his neck.
That was, until the owl came.
“What was that?” Ginny yelled from upstairs, failing to hide the tremble in her voice.
“Nobody. I don’t know their names.”
Wait. He
Malfoy knocked on the door, waiting for Flitwick. The tiny professor opened the door, and looked delighted, saying “Come in, come in, I don’t have a lesson or any marking and am rather bored…”
Draco presented the plan, Harry supported it, and Hermione rolled her eyes before saying “he is only one man, after all; what could he possibly do?”
Harry thought, ignoring the

“No — I definitely saw Bellatrix in the vision. We’ll consider that a last resort.”
wasn’t because the jumper was a lot softer than he’d expect it to be, and clearly had temperature-regulation charms woven in, and smelled of cedar, and smoke, and Harry - that odd mixture of smells he got a whiff of every time Harry leaned over him to get something. He just wanted to bury his face in the fabric, to inhale it and wrap his arms around himself. This really wasn’t proper behaviour for a Malfoy, but anyway.
“I don’t take advice well. Just do the bloody spell.”
Harry had no idea how long he had dozed for - not fully falling asleep in fear of nightmares, not fully awake in fear of reality. He cast a tempus - it was ten minutes into dinner, but Harry panicked at the idea of spending another meal with his housemates. They were rowdy enough to cover how quiet he was, but sooner or later they’d want him to join in the conversation, and they’d been back for twenty-four hours. The idea of all those eyes on him, expecting the old Harry back, laughing and joking with them...Harry shook his head. They wouldn’t expect that of him if he wasn’t there.
Draco had got in response wasn’t what he wanted to hear. Had they shared nothing, in the past twenty-four hours? One conversation with the other two Gryffindors and Harry remembered who he really was - Harry Potter, Saviour of the wizarding world, outgoing, reckless Gryffindor.
“Well either you’re shagging Malfoy or you’ve got the Snape’s seventh year book, which seems unlikely since we went to Diagon Alley to get all our books together. You haven’t been this good at potions since sixth year, and since you’re not coming to me for help the only other person who’s any good at potions is Malfoy - not to mention that you’ve been sitting next to him in classes and you’re calling him Draco.”
randomly burst in, Harry started to take of his clothes, grimacing at the state of them. They’d been cleaned with various charms, but they were still torn, with some bloodstains that couldn’t be removed. Stepping out of his briefs, Harry stared in the mirror, hardly recognising the man who stood before him. He had loads of scabbed cuts all over his body, the most noticeable of which being the two cuts on his face, and one deep gash going around his side, parallel to his rib cage. He had more across his torso, criss–crossing over skin patchy with old scars from the Dursley’s. He knew, if he turned around, there would be even more cuts and scars. He adamantly refused to look at his left arm, where he knew a skull and a snake was carved in excruciating detail. His skin was sallow, his bones stuck out everywhere, his arms and legs were unbelievably thin, and his once bright green eyes had dulled, his hair stringy and matted above them.
Bill bit his lip, before counting on his fingers as he listed people. “Well, there’s everyone in this room other than Ginny, who’s still underage,” Ginny glared at him, “some aurors — Kingsley will know who isn’t under the imperius. Some Hogwarts Professors — McGonagall, Flitwick, Sprout, Hooch, and so on. There’s also the people in hiding or on the run — the Tonks family, Moody, Diggle, Doge, Podmore, Fletcher…” Severus sneered at the name. Mundungus Fletcher was useful, sure, but he was also a lying, stealing
“We’ll bear that in mind.” Bill nodded.
. That wouldn’t bother him, but manual locks could be enchanted, and were just more satisfying.
Harry’s was...something different. Draco could see the silhouettes of trees, and a river lazily winding inwards. Harry’s mind must be at the end of the river - indeed, that’s where the rope seemed to go. No wonder Voldemort could have penetrated his mind so easily - it was as simple as following the river.
Draco was shaking Potter’s shoulders, yelling at him to wake up, and could have sobbed with relief when those green eyes snapped open, staring directly into his. Potter was still shaking, but at least he was awake.
what happened in Godric’s Hollow?” Draco stared at Harry with wide eyes.
Draco reached up tentatively, delicately wrapping his hands around Harry’s wrists, as if he was scared Harry would disappear. “Harry?”
high ranking that they’d be significantly out of place in the archives. They’d decided on Umbridge, Albert Runcorn, who was heading up the immigration and muggleborn registration committee, three people who worked down in the archives, and a couple of the aurors would go as themselves. They would take small pins with disillusionment charms as their portkeys, with charms on so only they could use them, and they’d put a temporary fidelius around a large shed near the Burrow, which would be close enough to provide aid from the Burrow without placing a fidelius around the actual building, which would negate the anti–dark mark wards, while the Portkeys would go to a forest around fifty miles away — close enough to apparate, not so close that the Ministry would be able to figure out where they were going.
“Well you’ve managed what Molly didn’t, which is impressive. You’d better go check on him though.”
. He grabbed Potter’s shoulders — they still felt so fragile, despite the weight he’d put on — and shook him gently, hissing
“So you know how the death eaters were supposed to invade Hogwarts tonight?” Draco sunk into one of the plush armchairs in the living room.
Ron was

Harry’s lips thinned, but he didn’t say anything.
He was alone.
Harry nodded, turning around to face Draco. He waited until Draco looked him in the eye, before saying, “Thank you.”

Hermione sighed, muttering something about “irresponsible boys” and “going to get himself pregnant”.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Thank you. And goodnight.”

looking after. She wasn’t as determined as Potter, which was a relief - she only talked to him when the class was required to pair up, which wasn’t often. On top of that, he had somehow managed to find Draco’s nook in the library where nobody harassed him.
which means she needs to be kept at a temperature of at least twenty–five degrees. It’s around five degrees here, so it shows up on the charm — and there’s a random ball of warmth up that way.”
“You should not,” Fleur said sternly, her Veela powers flaring as she glared at Remus until he sat down.
“You had to drink the potion again?” Hermione asked quietly, but Kreacher vigorously shook his head, tears flowing freely.
“Just one fire whiskey each, okay? I don’t want to stumble across McGonagall when I’m drunk.”
, Potter, what were you expecting me to do?”) and started waving his wand in an elaborate celtic knot, murmuring the incantation. Harry noted in a delirious state — he was probably going to faint in a minute — the stark difference in colour between Malfoy’s pale hand and his own coffee–coloured skin, with the words “

“So were you, Millie.” Draco turned, glad for the change in topic.

“Too overwhelming?” Draco had asked as they approached the kitchens.
“But that wasn’t the only thing wrong with you, you stubborn bastard.”
Voldemort opened the first cell door. The Weasley boy.
Draco sighed, and said “Put your hand on my shoulder — no, that’s my
But still, the full moons had been getting gradually worse. There were two in that month of July, and the second one was truly a killer — his very bones ached in a way they hadn’t since he’d been trapped in a cage as a youth. At least, during those awful years after James and Lily died, he could take advantage of enchanted forests. The ambient magic lessened the energy needed to transform, which made the post–moon energy crash much more bearable.
Hermione and Ron took three steps to the door, but were quickly petrified. Arthur plucked hairs from each of their heads, and put them in the two potions. Ron’s turned a fiery orange–red, a little darker than his hair, and Hermione’s turned a rich purple. Arthur then levitated the two teenagers back to the other side of the dining table, away from the door, and removed the charm.
“Evidently,” Draco said, in a stronger voice now. It was light out, so he grabbed a wand and checked the time. “It’s 7:30, we should probably get moving.”
“You’re calling me Ronald in this state?”
He sighed as his stomach grumbled - Draco couldn’t even let him finish his meal before distracting him with those damn
“No it isn’t you idiot, we learned the charms to take out various liquids and foods from clothes after the great gravy incident of fourth year.” Indeed, Blaise already had his wand out and was siphoning away the last of the juice. “My problem, on the other hand, is much more significant - I won’t be able to get a pulpless glass of pumpkin juice!”
Draco snapped out of his daydream as Slughorn dismissed them - he’d only got away with daydreaming as he had finished his potion early and had already bottled it. He took the bottle to the front of the room first, and left quickly, avoiding eye contact with the rest of the class. He was normally the only person alone on a bench, but was perfectly capable, and Slughorn didn’t want any extra trouble so he didn’t say anything. Draco was used to being ignored anyway.
“Of course you can, Harry. Isn’t this house fascinating? There are so many different breeds of Nargles inhabiting the walls — likely due to the age of the furniture…”
He hadn’t allowed the skin of his wrist to breathe since he’d left the Manor, wrapping a bandage around the ugly mark at the first opportunity and spelling it to repel all liquids and dirt so that he wouldn’t have to take it off. But today, he would finally remove it.
Draco almost laughed —
Harry had to visit Hagrid sometime this week as well.
as he drained the last of his tea. Quarter to five. He dragged himself back upstairs, and put his trunk in the middle of his room, open and empty. He levitated the books that he’d owl-ordered into the bottom, before piling clothes on top - school robes, old, baggy t-shirts of Dudleys that he used as pyjamas and underwear, mostly. He also packed his going-out jeans and joggers for the common room. Then he put in the snitch Dumbledore left him, the Marauder’s Map, his dad’s old cloak and other various personal items. Then stuff required for school - potions ingredients, spare quills, ink and parchment. After he’d finished packing, nothing of his own remained in his room, except his Firebolt in the corner. He stared at it for a couple of minutes, but felt none of the emotions he’d felt before seventh year - the freedom a broom provided him with, the happiness he’d associated with being up in the air. Nothing. He shrunk it and tucked it into his trunk anyway - he didn’t want to be on the quidditch team, and didn’t think they’d be allowed anyway, but it was an escape plan at the very least. The thought made him feel a bit better.
“He...the dream…”
Harry rolled his eyes and slumped back on his bed. “Bloody brilliant. Shall we go to Flitwick then?”
Sadly, neither Severus nor Draco had any immediate suggestions for how to remove the horcrux, since it would require killing Harry, and according to a prophecy, Harry had to kill Voldemort. It seemed like Voldemort had made the perfect situation that surpassed the prophecy entirely. Hermione remained optimistic, maintaining a bright bead of hope in the house, as she marched Ron and Draco into the library. However, she refused to let Harry go in, telling him to “practise his spells.”
. It hadn’t done anything when Voldemort picked it up, so it was probably safe to use. He cast a
afterwards.
“I—” Remus began, but Ginny smiled softly — sadly — and shook her head.
Draco knew his ideal way to be woken up, after sharing a bed with someone.
“That’s another thing - why can you use any body part except your hands?”
Severus looked down at his lap. “I’m sorry. They were good people.”
idiot.
Harry was sitting upright on his bed, and gave Draco a weak smile. Draco gave him a full one in return, taking long strides across the room and practically launching himself onto Harry’s bed.
And now someone was going to
Firstly, I’m not completely happy about this chapter, but I couldn’t really find a way to break up that massive section into smaller portions.

A silver mask dangled from Draco’s left hand. Which meant that
Narcissa kept her bag, ready to leave, on her at all times. It was only small, with an undetectable extension charm, so it was easily hidden under her robes.
He’d also lost any use of his right leg, the pain of the infection steadily moving upwards. His heartbeat was erratic, fluttering —
“I killed Voldemort, being seen with you isn’t going to ‘tarnish my reputation’ or anything. And also, I do not care.” Harry crossed his arms - he wasn’t leaving without Draco.
“I don’t care.”
“There are such things as nutrient potions, Hermione.”
He didn’t know what to think about the blonde-haired man who creeped into his dreams that night, nor the pale hand tilting his chin upwards to meet soft, smirking lips, nor the grey eyes staring into his own.
“Harry, love, what’s wrong?” Draco rubbed soothing circles into Harry’s back.
Harry asked Draco why he wasn’t angry, and the blonde hadn’t replied, just rubbed comforting circles into Harry’s back. When Harry looked up, into Draco’s eyes, they’d flickered, just for a second. He’d temporarily shifted into the Draco who had been hidden behind the glamour when he first walked in - and Harry knew. Knew how Draco felt, knew why, but he also knew that Draco was wrong. He hadn’t had a choice, since his parents had been threatened. He hadn’t had the choice, at the start of the battle, to give himself up for everyone else. For Fred. For Colin. For Tonks and Remus.
” Draco said more forcefully, faltering at the end at the look in the muggle’s eyes. He wouldn’t be able to do this, he knew it. And clearly, his father knew too.
Remus felt a stab of guilt at the fact that he hadn’t thought of the kids that weren’t in the nearby vicinity, but Bill shook his head at him.
“But if I hadn’t come back…”
He scanned the titles, making a new pile with a flick of his wand that consisted of eight books. He could have gotten more, but these would do, for now.
“Because I’m smarter than you, and you couldn’t be arsed to do the bloody research.”
Harry nodded, and walked over to Draco’s trunk, unlocked with a wave from Draco’s wand. Draco walked over to the mirror, and fixed his nose, before removing his robes, jumper and shirt, grunting at the pain from moving his arms. He fixed his ribs, before turning, about to ask Harry what was taking so long. Harry had been staring at his back, and was now staring at Draco’s face, and torso, looking at his various injuries, bruises already blooming.
“My Lord.” Draco’s father swept into a low bow - an image that still made Draco feel nauseated — but he followed suit, a whisper of silk telling him that his mother had done the same.
“Yes, although a better course of action to take would be to steal them. Then we could save the muggleborns, or at the very least warn them. We’re too small to face the Dark Lord’s forces alone, but we can help others evade them.”
Then again, Draco would give Harry the world and everything in it if it made Harry happy.
Harry grinned in satisfaction, eating his daily slice of bread. Hopefully, he’d be dead within two weeks.
Hermione looked at Malfoy in surprise. “Your magic is compatible with Harry’s?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “So Mrs. Malfoy—”
“I brought you some bread and butter,” Harry said, looking sheepishly at Draco from under his lashes while levitating over a plate with food on it. Draco smiled - he had brought food for him. Maybe he cared a little.
“Mr. Potter’s core looks far too small for someone who causes that many accidents in potions. Don’t look at me like that — having a larger core means it’s harder to control,” he added, as Harry glared at him.
“Harry!” Hermione threw her arms around his shoulders, obscuring his view with her bushy hair. “What are you doing down here?”

. It’ll take care of those cuts.”
Draco had walked over to Harry’s bed, drawing open the curtains, and his eyes met terrified, green eyes.
” Ron and Draco both whined.
To Harry’s dismay, after that the main focus of the lessons for him was learning how to do finicky, intricate spells that were about slowly channelling his magic. This resulted in many large explosions, and frustrating moments, but slowly, Harry improved, being able to hold his own in duels for longer periods of time.
“Thank you.” Remus said, before walking away. Just for a little while.
have information. What if they don’t?” Remus asked.
Remus stood in front, with his hand outstretched — he had done his research — and Fleur took it, frowning slightly before she started chanting in Latin. Bill steadily kept his hand on her shoulder, not flinching even as her silvery–blonde hair started to fan out, floating on an invisible wind, despite the wind actually flowing in the same direction that she was facing. Remus winced as he felt the magic flow from him, but as a werewolf, his magic was rather strong just after the full moon — once the exhaustion wore off, that is.  He wouldn’t be this strong again until twenty–four hours before the full moon, so really, this was the perfect time. He took a deep breath and relaxed, allowing the magic to flow out of him — and before he knew it, the spell was finished. He took a step and stumbled slightly, but could already feel his core refilling.
Draco thought. He hadn’t wanted to be hexed, but handing Potter his cloak in front of this many people would spark all sorts of rumours.
“Can’t we only have butterbeer in here?”
At the beginning of the last week of term, Hermione had sent her parents an owl telling them to go into hiding, having magically enlarged her trunk to bring almost everything she owned to Hogwarts so she could go straight to the Burrow at the end of term. Hermione was quite sure that they were going somewhere in Europe, although she hoped they would go further. As they were both sensible and dentists with a hefty salary, they had more than enough money to move to another country, and good qualifications to get jobs.
“I can’t—” Harry coughed, trying to clear his throat and make it a little less croaky. “I can’t pick it up.” The cough didn’t work, he still sounded
. Much more accurate.”
“But that’s the thing, mate. It
, which forms a transparent shield around him, before power walking back to the library, since he didn’t have a lesson for another hour and had no intention of running into Potter. He managed not to get hexed, and settled in a window seat in the farthest corner of the library, opened a book and began to read.
Draco was convinced he’d heard a chuckle as he walked out the room, and a warmth from the other end of the bond that usually eminanted emptiness.
Which was why he was caught completely unawares when he rounded a corner in a relatively silent corridor to stumble ungracefully into Potter.
“So…we’re all alive?”
“You’ll be in for a grilling when you come downstairs,” Severus said, sweeping out of the room before Draco could reply.
“I don’t
person not vying to obliviate him and set him loose in the woods. “Severus, looking as dramatic as ever, I see.”
At this point, there was a cacophony of noise behind Draco as the Gryffindor table, plus Abbot and Lovegood (who was an honorary Gryffindor at this point) removed their silencing charm to exit the pub. As Draco looked out of the corner of his eye, he noted that Thomas and the Weasel were still arguing about something or the other, with Granger rolling her eyes and Finnigan looking regretful that he didn’t bring popcorn. The other two couples were being all...coupley, and Potter, although it wouldn’t be obvious to the casual observer, was on the outside of it all and deep in thought (those emerald eyes still sparkling away -
“A little experiment of mine,” Lucius tried to purr — his voice was still dry and croaky from Azkaban, but he got his point across. “It leaches the magic from the wizard inside. Not enough to kill them, probably, but enough to weaken them considerably. And the door can only be opened by someone of Malfoy blood.”
“Fuck off.”
Harry shrugged. “Neither did I.”
Draco nodded stiffly at Potter, only just remembering the etiquette that his mother had drilled in to him. Potter nodded back, raising a single eyebrow, before shoving his hands in his pockets and walking off.
When Flitwick had pronounced them soulmates, Draco had felt numb - all of dreams had literally come true. The panic that had set in from the other end of the bond had crushed any elation Draco might have felt.
When he’d seen how skinny Harry had been, he hadn’t registered the other emotion he’d felt at the time. But now, thinking about it - he felt protective of the Gryffindor. He hadn’t wanted anything to happen to him before, but hadn’t been opposed to the occasional hex. Now? He felt ill at the
“Why would Dumbledore remove the Fidelius? I mean I know Sirius wasn’t living here anymore so the Order weren’t using it as a base but I mean really.” Hermione grumbled, opening one of several dusty tomes.
“You have a house elf?” Draco exclaimed in surprise. Harry had barely nodded before Kreacher was at Draco’s feet,
“Yeah, actually that would be really helpful. Could I come by, say, tomorrow morning?”
“We’ll be better-“
“Couldn’t be arsed. I got food from the kitchens yesterday, and it’s been enough to last me until now,” Harry said, dismissing the concern with a shrug.
“Spoilsport,” Ginny muttered, before smiling at Remus. “I’d like to learn the worst ones possible.”
“Food!” Scorpius exclaimed - he wasn’t quite talking in full sentences, but food was one of his favourite things. He almost ate as much as James.
“How do you know this?” Of
“No. There has to be another explanation.” Malfoy looked pissed off at the professor’s excitement.
“Would you be willing to surrender, perchance?” Harry asked.
A hearty cheer echoed around the room, and the kids behind Remus snickered slightly.
much, he’d never get any work done.
“You’ll be fine. Kreacher, can you fetch the locket and the cup, please? The evil ones.” Kreacher nodded without even muttering a slur. He really had come far.
Harry eagerly kissed back, opening his mouth slightly to suck on Draco’s lower lip, running his hands up Draco’s back and feeling all the toned muscle, before pulling him close until Draco was all he could feel, all he was.
(It was all Draco could do to not start squealing like the newest member of the I heart Potter club.)
“I’m so proud of you,” Ron whispered, pressing a soft kiss to her temple. “Wanna go back now?”
He carefully pulled the last thread of magic, smiling as the rest of the wards fell, and reached into the drawer to pull out the wand.
He didn’t lie there for long before being dragged down into a dream, remembering that he’d forgotten to occlude a moment too late.
“We are in a war, Mr Weasley; and I am very knowledgeable in the area of defence against the dark arts, and could teach yourselves.” Ron blanched as Severus continued. “Also, I don’t know what the Order is up to, so we should probably organise a meeting.”
“You can’t do that, Fleur.”
Severus jumped — internally, of course — as a high pitched squeal and a thump sounded from the corridor.
tired.
?” Hermione squeaked.
Malfoy huffed and sneered at him, and Ron rolled his eyes and walked out. Malfoy was a Slytherin, and Slytherins would do anything to save their won hide…and after betraying You–Know–Who, he probably knows that the Order is his only option. At least until he gets some money, and can run away.
Harry rushed forward, ignoring the lingering pulse of pain and anger in his mind as he pulled the chain, sighing in relief as a boat appeared.
Everyone in the group’s heads turned back and forth as if watching a tennis match, as the two boys, while almost standing, were on opposite sides of the table. Harry sneaked a glance at the Slytherins, who were deep in their own conversation and not listening to the shouting match - likely due to the
Ron could practically hear her sigh, before she apparated to him. “Ron, that doesn’t matter. This is a memory, remember?”
Harry woke up on the dreary Saturday morning close to pushing Draco out of the bed. He wasn’t even surprised when they woke up in the same bed anymore.
startled Harry, who would have flinched had he had an inch to move. He was thrown roughly into a room, hitting the wall with a thud and falling to the ground. The murmuring started again, and then Harry’s ties were removed.
“I didn’t know you could do that wandless,” Hermione said.
Remus downed the potion, relaxing slightly as it took effect. “So what’s been happening? Moody doesn’t tell me shit.”
“Next time — next time,
Harry sighed and raised the Elder Wand — that was a no.
“Well, Hermione can use fiendfyre now,” Ron said proudly.
Harry felt all the blood drain from his face, and a glance to the side confirmed that the same had happened to Malfoy. “And what does that
“They’re death eaters - surely they won’t stick to their deal?” Fred — or George, Hermione wasn’t sure — raised one eyebrow, growing considerably more pale by the second.
“Try to cut half of my arm out?” Harry nodded, grimacing. Draco grimaced too, imagining the scene Harry must have walked in on - there were a lot of vital blood vessels there, so there would have been ridiculous amounts of blood. Draco considered whether or not to tell Harry about his nightmare...but how would he explain how badly being forced to kill Harry affected him?
Draco sighed and shuffled over, his movements at odds with his stiffly straight spine and expressionless face.
Back in their room, Harry turned to Draco. “
“How did you even get
“Molly and Arthur?” Severus looked openly shocked.
“Polyjuice. The twins made a special one that lasts longer — if we assaulted some high ranking members of the ministry, people could easily get the documents we need.”
Harry and Draco followed the sprinting kids at a more leisurely pace, holding hands. They entered the chaotic house, Harry barely even flinching at the wall of noise that greeted them. Children from ages two to eight (Teddy also came during holidays, but was currently in his second year of Hogwarts and at school for another week) ran around their legs, and Harry and Draco were greeted with hearty claps to the shoulder and hugs from various people.
Draco pulled up his covers, and murmured “goodnight, Harry”, the words Harry had screamed while dreaming echoing around his head louder than whatever Harry replied.
He didn’t
Draco heaved a sigh and rolled his eyes, but didn’t deny it. He just sat on the bed, occasionally stroking Harry’s hair.
“I’m freezing. Can we go back now?” Draco was shivering under Harry’s hands. He cast an umbrella charm over both of them, before casting a drying charm over their clothes. The
“Well,” McGonagall said, “it looks as if Miss Weasley has the same idea as myself. Don’t put yourself in too much danger, as we will all be looking out for everyone as well, but if you could spread the word, it would be appreciated.”
“Who did it? You’re welcome, but I shouldn’t have had to do that.”
It felt like an eternity had passed by the time it was over, though Ron knew the spell only lasted around five minutes. Hermione collapsed as soon as she finished chanting, but Ron caught her easily even as his muscles shook with exhaustion and his legs threatened to give way.
I’ve finally finished writing this, just need to edit the next three chapters :)
He stiffly stood up, testing his joints. He could walk well enough. He got his wand - miraculously not snapped - and cast some glamours over his face and body, that would make it appear that he was walking normally, before making his way to the dorms. There was no one in the common room, so he hastily walked into his room, almost colliding into Harry, who was pacing.
staying in that cold, dark corner of his mind, but if it helped Draco sleep, he’d do it. He’d woken up to Draco having a nightmare a couple of times, but Harry didn’t mind, and in any case, that was different; Draco wasn’t depending on Harry
“You’re right.”
Harry snuck a glance at Draco, who had been silent throughout the conversation. His face was paler than usual, and completely devoid of any emotion; it broke Harry’s heart. But he’d meant what he’d said last night — this was bigger than both of them. He couldn’t let his feelings get in the way when they were this close.
“Harry…” Draco almost whispered. Harry didn’t notice the water trickling down his face, or his robes steadily getting damper. He watched a drop of water travel from beside Draco’s eyes into the corner of his mouth, which was slightly parted. He dragged his gaze back up to Draco’s eyes, which flickered down to Harry’s lips in return.
One useful thing that had come out of their research was a spell to remove marks infused with dark magic. Hermione and Ron had immediately sprinted down to Severus, whose face had lit up in a rare show of positive emotion. Remus had walked in, looked at the spell and immediately volunteered to do the spell. He’d estimated five days, just to be sure, since he wouldn’t get any practice rounds.
Snape’s lip curled, and he almost —
Harry bit his lip. “I’m gay. Or maybe bisexual. I haven’t come out to anyone yet - not even Ron and Hermione.”
- and Draco was kissing him back, with lips softer and more inviting than Ginny’s ever were, hands first cupping Harry’s face, then clutching his shoulders, then his long, slender fingers were running through Harry’s hair.
than in his dream. At least there, it had been neutral. Here, it felt like the dark magic had seeped into the very bones of the castle.
“What’s wrong, Ronald?” Hermione said, reaching the top of the stairs. “Brilliant, Harry’s out of bed. Dinner?”
Draco dragged himself up to his room, first immersing himself in transfiguration homework and then ancient runes, determinedly ignoring the pulses of content from the other end of the bond.
He quickly got changed, brushed his teeth, went to the toilet and got into bed. It was a different sort of tired than his usual clubbing that made him forgo reading before sleeping - stressing about coming back all day, stressing under keeping his put-together image under the stares of everyone else, it all drew on Draco’s energy reserves. He sank into the plush mattress, facing the wall and feeling at peace with only the sound of his own breathing to keep him company. He occluded before he went to sleep, focusing on the blankness in front of him.
“But I’m not—” Harry’s protest was cut off by a yawn, after which he scowled that his body seemed to be insistent that Draco always be right.
to have a jumper in your bag.” Draco pulled the jumper over his head, the muscles in his back shifting, his grumbling muffled by the soft material.
here? There’s a fidelius over the entire building!” Ron frowned.
Harry woke up feeling rejuvenated, after the best night’s sleep he could remember getting...ever.
Harry weakly punched him in the arm. “Don’t call me that. This isn’t really a dark mark, anyway — it’s
(See the end of the chapter for
They sighed and each grabbed a stack of documents. Harry grabbed another, as did Narcissa, Remus and Severus.
“We’re not going to be late, we have ten minutes to get downstairs. You coming Harry?” She added, looking over at Harry, who hadn’t moved from his seat, wondering whether there was any excuse for him not to go.
“You need better healing potions.” Voldemort turned on his heel, striding out of the dungeon. Lucius could bring food later. Neither Bellatrix nor Fenrir could be trusted to not kill him, anyhow.
“I think I’m just going to lie here for a while.”
Right so...this entire chapter is centred around child abuse. I’m sorry. If you don’t want to read the actual graphic abuse, it starts at ‘Harry woke up to complete darkness’ and finished at ‘Draco was finally pulled out of the dream as Harry lost consciousness.’ I’ve put sentences in bold.
“I brought chicken and sweetcorn soup, Potter. I know it’s your favourite.” Draco said, before shoving Potter again.
Harry pulled back to look at Remus with one raised eyebrow.
It wasn’t a large nook - there was a bookshelf behind and in front, with a window on the side, and a desk pushed up against one bookshelf with two chairs (one of which used to be for Draco’s bag, before Potter arrived and unceremoniously demoted it to the floor). Potter always cornered Draco in, since Draco refused to move from his window seat, and always seemed to be wearing some sort of pine-scented aftershave, which always set Draco on edge. More often than not he ended up staring out of the window to avoid being caught staring outright at Potter, as that would be rather hard to explain.
It sounded oddly like Snape’s voice, which Harry decided to ignore. That little voice kept him alive during the last year, and while there wasn’t a need for it, Harry found himself suddenly on edge at the weirdest of times - while they were sitting in the common room, in the middle of an impromptu test from McGonagall. Normally, Draco was on hand to ‘casually’ rest his hand on Harry’s shoulder or knee. These casual, public touches meant that most of the student body was convinced that the pair were secretly dating. The people who didn’t think so were Ginny, who was in denial about Harry being gay, mainly due to him not coming out or explicitly breaking up with her - Ron, who still secretly harboured hostile feelings towards the Malfoy heir - Terry Boot, who wanted Harry for himself - and Zacharias Smith, who was oblivious to anything that didn’t explicitly involve him. There were also various bets in the teaching body about how long it would take for the pair to come out, with McGonagall betting by Easter, Hagrid betting by the end of the year, and Flitwick who said by the end of November, to name a few.
Draco.
Draco thought, gingerly lying back down as Harry snuggled into his side. Now his arm was draped over Draco’s stomach, his face buried in the sleeve of Draco’s jumper. Draco sighed, waving his wand to close the curtains of the window and closing his eyes, since there wasn’t much else to do.
Fleur and most of the Order — everyone who wasn’t inhabiting Grimmauld Place, Shell Cottage, or who’s cover wasn’t blown in the Ministry — were tasked with getting muggleborns out of the country. Safehouses were already set up in northern France, and Charlie was doing further negotiations to get them safe transport to places further from Britain. The muggleborns were instructed not to assume that they were returning anytime soon.
“Apparently so. We might as well work together — make the cake quicker, then we can go back to sleep.” Hermione smiled hopefully, but Ron scowled and muttered something in Hermione’s ear. “Not anymore,” she said out of the corner of her mouth, and Draco’s heart sank.
Then Harry turned Draco around so he was staring at his reflection in the mirror while Harry rubbed salve into his back. He was taller than Harry, so he couldn’t stare at the other boy through the mirror. His front was completely flawless - Harry had evidently applied dittany to the cut on his cheek while Draco was staring at him.
“Because Fred...and there’ll be too many people...and you won’t be there…” Harry stiffened at the last statement, but relaxed again as Draco moved his thumb against Harry’s arm.
Draco spared a sidelong glance at Harry, who’s brow was already furrowed in concentration. Draco conjured a glass (with words muttered under his breath) before thinking the words

He followed the couple back to the common room, grabbing all the supplies he needed for the lessons and shoving them in his bag before walking up to defence with them. It was a small-ish class - about twenty students, but a mix of all four houses. Harry noted Malfoy was there, and being given a wide berth by everyone; not that he seemed to care. He had his head held high, scanning over everyone that walked past. But there was something different in the way he held himself, Harry noted - he seemed looser, but more elegant. More grounded, and therefore free to move without fear of being lost to the currents.
he saw something emerge from the lake for a split second towards the back of the lake. Ron moved towards the bank, trying to see what had splashed in the eerily–still lake. However, the water didn’t move, so Ron went back to watching Harry and Dumbledore. He held out the chain to Harry, mumbling something about his hand. Harry took the chain without question, even as the pain he was feeling, likely from his episode, was written across his face. Ron figured that it was probably best for Harry to be doing the heavy lifting — Dumbledore’s hand
“Yes, I’d have to agree. I’m going to get you some food and potions and stuff, and,” he paused to delicately sniff at the air, “run you a bath. You need to get out of this bloody bed.”
“But why would he go to all these lengths to keep them alive…and use such archaic magic?. The only
Draco was on the floor, in a huge pool of blood, and his skin was as white as paper. He had deep scratches across his face, and bite marks all down his arms and torso, huge chunks of skin ripped out to reveal muscle and bone, spurts of blood squirting rhythmically, weaker than they should have been. “Draco, you
This continued for another week. Harry’s schoolwork improved significantly, to the delight of teachers, mostly due to Harry being able to ask Draco questions through the bond.

on the silk items — but he could just use ironing charms once they were out. Severus said he had a hideout which could be used until Potter could take them somewhere safer — his godfather had likely left him somewhere with loads of wards, since he would have been the last living Black who had access to areas. There was a building which Draco knew existed, but not its name or whereabouts — probably under a Fidelius. Hopefully, Potter could get them in.

Ron raised an eyebrow. “What did that do?”

“No, Dumbledore couldn’t

Harry snorted softly and nodded.
. Severus shuddered — he knew what their favourite pastimes were. Harry needed to be out immediately.
Remus woke with the summer sun — which was ridiculously early, because whoever invented daylight savings was a terrible person. He yawned and stretched, shuffling to the kitchen to make a pot of tea. Around halfway through boiling the water, he was overcome by a sudden fear of Molly storming down the stairs because he was in her kitchen, before realising;
room, more than the one at the manor had ever been. He sighed, pulling the corners of his mouth into a neutral expression and cast one last look around the room. The green drapes, the ripples of cyan light the lake sent across the room - Draco would miss it all. He’d even miss the initial spurt of cold water from the showers, the chills that rippled through his body when the fire went out.
Draco felt a spike of proudness through the bond.
Bellatrix sneered at Harry’s lack of reaction, removing the knife and dragging it along his collarbone. The sensation of knife against bone was jarring, and Harry tried even harder to not be there. He kept his mind blank, not even allowing thoughts of pain to drift across, until he suddenly just…
Unless
Tearing his eyes away from Draco, he finally lined up the cork and the hole and started to walk towards the classroom’s centre aisle, taking all of one step before tripping over his bag.
Just as Harry was about to doze off, his eyes slowly closing, something caught his eye. He blinked. And blinked again.
“Who’s doing the spell?” Remus asked, gazing at the little home. It was adorably quaint — probably three bedrooms, single pane windows that somehow added character, vines climbing up trellises and a humble fence that contrasted with the golden sand — a feature that was a rarity in Britain — and a green, glittering sea.
“You told me not to go.”
The people who had arrived were Kingsley, Hestia, Remus, and the aurors. They’d arrived just in time for the area to light up with green light, followed by a loud
“What do you mean
“Well, when you phrase it like that…” Draco raised an eyebrow, before stalking out of the room. Harry followed close behind, for once not worrying about anything other than how much homework Flitwick was going to set.

“That's not equivalent to nagging, Ron.” Harry rolled his eyes. “Library, then?”
“I — yeah:
“So how do we get into the ministry…” Bill trailed off, and silence hung around the table before Hermione spoke.
After what seemed like an aeon, Harry stopped moving. He tried to take note of his surroundings as best as he could, being tied up and blindfolded — it was cold, and the air smelled of mildew. He heard some murmuring, before a loud
“Nonsense, Hermione. You’re part of the family.”
“Why were you on a mission?”

conversation. It was a real shame that his father had indoctrinated him with such ridiculous views.
“Don’t eat with your mouth full, Potter” Draco replied, avoiding the question. He really didn’t know, other than Potter had looked so pathetic on the bathroom floor, and at the thought of the darkness at the end of the bond, Draco hadn’t had the heart, or lack of, to insult him. “Perhaps I’m ill, I’ll be back to normal tomorrow.”

Severus had to say, though, he’d never had a friend like Remus. Sure, Lily had always been there for him, but there had always been a clear division between them; their bond was more fragile than either of them (at least, Severus
“I can’t.” Harry rolled his eyes, sitting up as the blood started rushing to his head.

He yelled “Draco?”, already moving to the bathroom. He pounded on the door, and tried to open it to no avail - he tried an
But after feeling a distinct kick to the nose that set his eyes watering, Harry realised someone was beating up Draco. Many someone’s, if the rate of the kicks was any indication.
“It does seem quite good. Better than carrying plates, since these pose a lower risk of spillage.” Harry looked at Draco as if his head had inflated and floated off his shoulders, spouting fortune cookie predictions. “I’m not my father, you know.”
Potter groaned again and sat up, looking as bad as before, except that his hair was worse. “If I eat will you fuck off?”
“No, my left hand occasionally gets in on the action!”
Harry took a deep breath, and opened the door.
“Well of course it didn’t taste the same when ordered by the Weasel - an order from the
“I don’t know, it sounds like standard Potter stupidity to me,” Draco replied. Harry glared at him over his shoulder.
After about thirty seconds of sitting there with James squirming between them, Draco drawled “So are we getting food or not?”
He stopped for a moment at the point where he’d dropped the resurrection stone. He could see a little bump in the leaves where it must be. Resisting the temptation to disturb his parents one last time, he levitated it, and the surrounding leaves so he wouldn’t have to look at it, and forcefully buried it about two metres off the path, before smoothing the earth over the top so there was no evidence.
the Boy–Who–Lived. At the very least, they could split the potion between the two of them so they were both weakened, but not to a horrendous amount. Then he remembered what he’d turned around to do.
Harry turned back to his friends, a smile lighting his still-sparkling eyes.
“So the bond did go wrong in charms, but not in the way I thought. We did get bonded, and we’re still,” Malfoy grimaced, “bonded.”
Ginny raised her eyebrows, impressed. “Well, let’s go kill us a snake.”
and setting it hovering above his head, illuminating the pages of the book he’d picked up. Looking at the cover, he realised it was one he’d read before, so he opened it at a random page, reading the same sentence over and over as he listened for the door to open.
At least, as a spirit, he couldn’t feel the pain of
Although, in a way, these were his new family — the Weasleys seemed to have a habit of taking in strays. Harry and Hermione, himself, even the Slytherins had been accepted, and they moved around each other as if they’d been side by side for years.
Although perhaps, Severus noted, Draco made sure Harry ate. He clearly had a
Harry was surprised, again. “I’ve never slept in for that long before.”
Indeed, the common room sofas were looking quite inviting, but Harry didn’t feel anything towards the idea of having to room with Malfoy. “He isn’t a threat, and maybe he’ll just leave me alone.”

She turned back at the doorway to see that Harry’s face had drained of blood, and he was shivering.
Draco straightened and looked haughtily down at Harry. “I can,” he said indignantly, taking all of one step before swaying again.
“Can you take us now? I know it's late, but we don't have much time to lose.”
“Because you’re not hungry, or because you don’t want to see anyone?”
“S-sure.” Harry looked at Draco - he never stuttered. Of course, the prat had forgotten his cloak and was shivering.
“Yesterday, after we finished the research. They
“Come on, we’ve got lunch at the Weasley’s.”
They spent an hour combing through the archives, shrinking any documents that seemed vaguely useful and shoving them into bags. As they finished, an alarm was raised, the ear–splitting sound echoing around the room.
“And what was stopping you during the summer?”
Harry declined his offer, going into the bathroom with some pyjamas he’d picked off his bed. Draco sighed, waving his wand to get rid of the light before putting the book on the side, not bothering to mark his page, closing the drapes and lying down, staring at the canopy over his bed.
Comments and kudos always appreciated ❤️
Harry fed Dumbledore the penultimate cup full, not noticing an immediate change in his condition. Harry drew his wand — he didn’t know how long he had until Voldemort appeared, but figured that he may have to hold him off temporarily while Dumbledore recovers.
He grinned like a lunatic as he went through the portrait whole, resulting in knowing smiles from Hermione and Ron. “Just had a good shag, mate?”
Remus frowned. “And how do they get out? It would be a bit difficult to smuggle massive piles of paper out, and in the case of an emergency, they’d need an extraction plan.”
“Sleep in here w’me? You’re tire’ too.”
Harry thought, before closing the distance between them and kissing Draco. It was hardly more than a brush of lips, but Harry felt it all through his body, sparks dancing down his spine at the contact.
Draco covered his shock with a smirk; since when did Potter call him Draco? No matter - he could still talk. He thought, anyway. “And why would I do that? My voice is much nicer than yours; and I make such good points.”
“And what, exactly, was that purple spell going to do?” Remus asked tiredly.
“Why not?” Harry asked.
Draco sniffed delicately at his, saying “and people drink this for fun?”
“Do tell!”

Kingsley and Moody were the only two full members of the Order remaining in the Ministry. Everyone else had been fired or was in hiding. There were a few neutral aurors that were willing to help for something in exchange — usually time off — which allowed Kingsley to quietly thwart the death eaters efforts to catch muggleborns — when he heard about them. More and more often, they took it upon themselves to scour the country themselves, calling themselves ‘Snatchers’ and reaping the rewards when they brought some helpless unregistered witch or wizard into the Ministry. That was all it took to get arrested these days — if you weren’t on the official registers, you were immediately assumed to be muggleborn and arrested.
Harry sent an image of himself pulling a face through the bond - cross-eyed and sticking his tongue out. Draco sent one in return of him rolling his eyes.
“You shouldn’t.”
“My parents sacrificed themselves.” Ron finished in a low voice, Hermione looking at him in surprise. “Bill, Fleur and the twins are in it, and Charlie helps out when he can.”
“Harry. You idiot,” she scolded, sitting down next to his bed. “You shouldn’t suffer in silence.”
Granger sounded a little choked up herself as she said “how — what potion is it?”
— ideas.” Harry never thought he’d live to see the day he and Snape would agree on anything.
Draco loosed a shaky breath before continuing to Ancient Runes, stomach churning for the entire lesson as his mind was taken up by caramel skin and curved lips and electrifyingly green eyes.
Potter continued to shake his head, adamantly responding that he was “fine”. After about thirty seconds, Draco reached the end of his tether.
than that.
Harry had been lying in bed, staring at the wall, when he’d felt a shooting pain at the top of his thigh.
The elves were a bit wary of Draco when he arrived but Kreacher (“of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black”) greeted him with a smile, very much at odds with what Draco remembered of the elf. He was wearing a snowy, white towel and a polished, green locket with a serpentine S. He also greeted Draco as “Master Malfoy”, and then “Master Draco”, after Draco told him that “Master Malfoy” reminded him too much of his father.
“Can’t.” Potter shrugged and swung his legs out of bed. Draco didn’t know what to say to that, so he watched Potter pull on his shoes, and his robe. “Go back to sleep, Malfoy. I’ll see you later.”
that this would go smoothly.
Draco anxiously ran a hand through his hair. The death eaters were supposed to be here by now - they said two in the morning, and now it was five past. He didn’t
“Rise, both of you. I need you to make this potion.” Voldemort slammed a book on the table, making them both flinch, and opening it to a seemingly random page. He moved backwards so the pair could look.
Eventually, after he’d been passed around for
Harry felt the warm magic wrap around him and kept still, not wanting to be removed from this dream. He hadn’t had a dream in weeks, to his knowledge, and this was wonderful — the magic gently caressed his skin, chasing away the chill of the dungeon and soothing the cuts. It might have even stopped the bleeding.
“Narcissa, we need something. We don’t know what it is, but Bellatrix has it, somewhere. We think.”
Then, hand in hand, Molly and Arthur walked outside.
new passages, all leading to the seventh floor. She’d agreed to spread the word to the rest of the portraits to let any kids running from someone know about them, and Ginny told all of the Gryffindors, with Neville by her side, about the plan. Most of them would still have to go to lessons, and the teachers would protect them as best as they could, but if too many people skipped defence and muggle studies it would likely result in teachers being fired. However, if they could all spread the word to the other houses, that would be good, because everyone needed to stick together.
He went to his room, where he opened a book, looking for spells that he could use that would kill without him having to perform an unforgivable. The cutting curses were a strong choice — he could easily sever a major artery. He could just not look at the pools of blood. Never mind the fact that he was extremely squeamish. And the sound of muggles choking on their own blood — Draco sighed. He’d just have to learn how to cast a killing curse in — he cast a tempus — twelve minutes.
Harry
“No.”
Harry —
Harry scoffed, running his eyes concernedly over Draco’s figure. Draco rolled his eyes, saying “I’m fine, get out, I need to go to the toilet!”
“Thank you, for…you know. Saving me and stuff.” As the sudden burst of energy receded, Harry found himself overcome to climb into a bed — preferable a soft one, with a thick duvet, and maybe a hot water bottle — and sleep for a week.
He wasn’t particularly shocked at the idea, but pulled back into his own mind. Harry smelled of freshly cut grass and leather, on the surface, but underneath there was the faint scent of cinnamon. Draco inhaled it, falling asleep with Harry in his arms.
Tired from the relief from the stress of the day, Draco ignored his friends as he walked into the common room and fell into bed, barely sparing enough time to strip down to his briefs and cast a teeth-brushing charm. He dreamed of hugging and comforting Potter in the kitchens that night - something he regretted not doing earlier.
