Harry closed his eyes, took a deep breath, then opened them again. He copy and pasted the link to his first (and only) public show into an email, and sent it to Draco.
Maybe it was selfish to say yes. Draco wasn’t sure. He knew that Clarence loved him, and he didn’t think it would, realistically, get better than that. He made Clarence happy, he knew that— or he made Clarence look good at parties, which amounted to more or less the same thing, for Clarence.
Perhaps in an attempt to scandalise Draco’s new church friends, Adelaide showed up at the restaurant in her most punk rock attire. Hair flaming pink—was that a nose ring?—heavy black boots, a leather skirt, eyes raccoonish with eyeliner.
“He wants to sleep with me,” Draco told his mother. His hair was sticking up; he kept running his hands through it, and his pupils were wide and black.
“I’m not going to kill myself,” said Draco, before remembering that that wasn’t actually why Potter guarded him, “or anyone else,” he added. “So you can go.”
“You’re in for a bad time,” said Hermione, getting to her feet. “I’ll come check on you as soon as I can. I’ll set you up a Ministry safe house, but that’ll take about a week. You’ll have to stay here until then.”
“Blaise! Good of you to patronise us with your gracious presence,” said Pansy, when they went into the sitting room. She and Blaise looked at each other a fraction too long, then Pansy turned proudly away.
Harry smiled. Their noses were touching, and then their lips were touching, because Lamorak was kissing him. Lamorak! Lamorak had kissed him! Harry kissed hungrily back, but it was over long before Harry was ready.
“Maybe you only like me when I’m unhappy. I was happy at Hogwarts, until sixth year, anyway, and you never liked me then.”
“So are you just going to be kitten-Draco forever now?” asked Harry. The kitten licked at the end of his tail. “Draco. That is not a real option.”
At Harry’s expression, he ploughed on. “Hey! Look, I haven’t said anything about you being in love with him or whatever. But just because
“I’ll be back soon. We need to talk to Hermione, and you’re not in a state come with me. Are you okay? You’re not in pain?”
He didn’t tell himself that this was for Ron and Seamus’ embarrass-Malfoy plan. It was so clearly nothing to do with that. Even Harry couldn’t delude himself to that extent.
L said nothing for a moment. He made Harry’s bed and laughed a little when he found Harry’s toothbrush under the pillow.
He managed to listen to what Cookie and Archie said through lunch just enough so that he wasn’t actually rude, all the while eavesdropping on Sebastian and Adelaide. Sebastian, thank God, was playing hard to get.
Adelaide gave a watery sort of laugh, then covered her face with her hands. Draco turned his head back to the ceiling to give her privacy.
“I don’t like that name for us,” Harry had protested. Anyway, Seamus only wanted to go because Dean would be there. Harry and Pansy both knew that, and didn’t know what to do about it.
“Sitting! Yes! What an excellent idea—ha, ha,” (the same laugh again, where he seemed to say the words rather than do the deed). “Isn’t this strange? Can I touch your hair? You tried to kill me.”
To Harry’s mingled joy and horror, Draco napping on him became a regular part of their life together. As did Draco listening to him with that calm, comforting expression in the evenings, when Harry talked about the war or his childhood. And Draco and Ginny becoming thick as thieves, actually improving Harry’s post-break-up relationship with her.
The redhead sneered “I wanted to know if Harry Potter was on the train but obviously, he isn’t, the Harry I heard about wouldn’t be rude like you.” Glaring at the git for yet again believing everything he’s told, finally was the last straw. “Well I don’t have the pleasure of knowing your name mister.” Harry said trying to keep a calm voice knowing for sure this was a Weasley. “My name is Ron Weasley.” Ron said sounding proud “Well Mister Weasley, my name is Harry Potter-Snape and everything you might have read or been told about me is nothing but lies, an old goat wanting to control me has been spreading.” Harry said with such malice it felt like the compartment was frigid. “My mom said you would be confused and not really know who you are after living with the Malfoy and Snapes, but Harry those men aren’t your parents. Your mom would be ashamed of how these people are stomping on their memory.” Ron said sounding very confident, until he was push back by such a strong force. “DON’T YOU DARE SPEAK ABOUT MY MUM IN SUCH AWAY!! YOU AND YOUR FAMILY NO NOTHING ABOUT HER OR ABOUT MYSELF, SO LEAVE ME AND MY FAMILY ALONE GOT IT!” Harry said standing in the doorway before slamming the door and locking it.
Love Potion- Albus Dumbledore- to himself to get Severus to marry him for the prince seats (last given 6 years ago)
Memory Block 100%- Albus Dumbledore- to forget about loving lily more than just a sister and not hating James
It had been four years to the day that the Potter Riddle Snape Family and Malfoys had the purge done and even with the law suit that Dumbledore went through with the goblins, he was still in office as head warlock as well as headmaster of Hogwarts. “Tom, I am still not sure if we should let Harry go to Hogwarts, I don’t want to run the risk of Dumbledore trying anything.” Severus said knowing that Dumbledore would do everything possible to get Harry away from them. “We can’t keep him hidden and having him go to a different school than his bonded will hurt them both magically.” Tom said ever since the day of Dumbledore’s first visit Harry and Draco’s bond has been anything but normal, both could convey their thoughts, feelings and give each other magic when needed. Even though Harry was technically 12 medical history puts him as only 11 so he was starting Hogwarts the same year as Draco. “We’ve tested how far they can be away from one another before it starts to cause problems, having Harry at a different school shouldn’t do any harm.” Severus said but knowing that they couldn’t be apart more than a week before it started to drain them, Severus knew his argument wasn’t going to be won that Harry had to go to Hogwarts. Severus knew there was only one way for Harry to be safe and he would only do it for his family. “Sev, you know that we can’t keep them apart we have to let them go…. Sev what are you thinking?” Tom said looking at his husband knowing that Severus was planning something that he wasn’t liking but was determined to do. “I’m going to take Lucius up on his offer, and I think you should to.” Severus said looking unhappy about doing this but knew it would be a sure way to keep Harry away from Dumbledore. Tom looked at his husband surprised at the lengths he would go for his family, this was Dumbledore the man would do anything to have the world run the way he wanted it to be ran. “Sev, are you sure? I don’t want you doing this if its going to make you unhappy.” Tom said as he took his husbands hand looking concerned “I will be unhappy but if this helps keep Harry safe, I will do everything to make it happen.” Severus said with such determination that even Tom couldn’t stop him. “Very well I will take Lucius up on his offer too, no point in not having both of us there.” Tom said with a smile oh Dumbledore was not going to be happy with the board of governors, Tom had been trying to get the defense post for years and because they could never keep a professor more than a year it was finally his chance that he could finally take that curse away and stay at Hogwarts for the 8 years that Harry was there. Severus just smiled knowing that the curse on the defense post was going to be lifted and no one would be the wiser. “Well let’s go tell Lucius the good news.” Severus said smiling knowing that his family will be there made taking the Potions position a little more bearable.
Just as he thought those words a loud crackling noise happened around the house. “I wonder what that was, can’t be good for me though I’m sure to be beaten for this.” Harry thought just as his cupboard door opened to the face of his Uncle Vernon.
Harry and Tom both passed out from crying, both just laid in the bed. Severus was on cloud nine Harry remembered them, all anyone could do was watch as they slept both looked at peace. Severus and Cissa left them to rest while they got things ready for Harry’s new room, well Cissa got Harry’s room ready Severus finished the potions they would need for the next six months. The next couple of hours we peaceful, Tom had woken up for the need to use the loo was extreme as he was only gone a couple of minutes, he heard the screaming. “NO UNCLE, PLEASE DON’T IT HURTS I PROMISE TO BE GOOD DON’T STICK IT IN THERE PLEASE. I’LL BE GOOD, I WON’T BURN THE FOOD AGAIN PLEASE STOP.” Harry screamed Tom rushed into the room and saw bottles and medical supplies flying around the room he did his best not to get hit as he tried to get to Harry. When he got to the bed Tom grabbed Harry’s hand “Harry its ok, your safe he can’t hurt you anymore I promise you are safe Harry please wake up.” Tom said in hysterics but saw that Harry was slowing waking up, then bright emerald eyes looked up at him and Harry started to sob “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt you please don’t leave me I am such a freak, but I will behave I promise.” Harry said heavily breathing that’s what Severus heard as he ran in with Cissa and both of their hearts broke for the child. “Harry I won’t ever leave you not again, and you are not a freak you are loved and wanted you are special and beautiful. Nothing those people said to you is true, you are not I repeat not a freak.” Tom said through sobs as his heart broke for the boy he held. Harry started to calm down with those words and just held Tom feeling comfort once again he closed his eyes told him self “They are dead, they are dead, they can’t hurt me anymore.” He repeated this in his head as he looked up at Tom “Thank you, I am sorry for breaking anything I will help clean them up.” Harry started to move but Cissa said no that what happened was all part of the healing process and that it was her fault for not giving him the potion to block out bad dreams.
I can’t allow you boys to be together you are not good for Harry just like his so-called parents.” Dumbledore said getting angry about the turn of events. “Allow! You think, you have any say on who anyone ends up with?” Harry said getting equally angry of the stupidity of the old goat. “I am Albus Dumbledore, I have more power than you have in your finger boy.” Dumbledore said letting his true power show but looked confused when Harry started laughing.
I've updated the first chapter let me know what you all think the second chapter is being rewritten as we speak
“I do wish we didn’t have to kill them so quickly; he has a long recovery from this even after the 6 months are up on the Nutrition potions, he going to have to take them at least once a day for the next few years just to get him back to where he is supposed to be,” Severus said trying to calm himself down, he was so angry but not just at those horrible people but also the ministry as well as Dumbledore.
Harry started to cry and said “He was supposed to protect us, why did he lie? Why did he come that night and kill them I hadn’t done anything? Why? All my mom could do was beg for him to spare me, but he wouldn’t listen. Then Tom Tom showed up to late, but he showed up and fought with him, but his spell missed Dumble, and hit me by accident but it was enough to knock Tom out and as well as me then I woke up on the door step of the Dursleys with no memory.” Harry said between sobs at that moment Tom walked into the door looking confused at what was going on until he continued to move towards the bed and was being hugged by Harry. “I know you tried TomTom, I don’t blame you.” Harry said in hysterics all Tom could do was hold him and sob feeling his heart feel lighter than it has in years.  “Harry oh gods I am so sorry I didn’t get there faster, I had only just heard your voice scream but I was to late to save anyone.” Tom said in sobs all anyone in the room could do was watch as the boy and Tom heal each other in understanding.
“It’s okay, Harry, my name is Cissa; you are safe now, and you are in my home,” Cissa said, looking into those bright green eyes for the first time.
The next day Harry woke up and just knew today wasn’t going to go well. x “Morning Har, is everything okay?” x Draco asked through the bong looking concerned. * “It’s not going to be a good day Drayk, I can feel it.” * Harry said back looking at Draco with equal concern. Walking up to Harry, Draco hugged his bonded giving him the comfort both of them needed at that moment.
Smiling, Cissa chuckled, “He wore himself out with that little attack; Sev, he will be just fine.” She said, walking back over to her desk to finish the report.
Cissa grabbed the parchment after it was done. What she saw caused her stomach to roll. “Severus, please tell me they suffered,” Cissa said; on the verge of tears, she handed him Harry’s medical report.
“Harry, are you okay? I felt your energy all the way in my class.” Tom said coming into the quarters after setting things up for class in the morning. “Yes, I would like to know what caused this to happen as well” Severus said though he had a feeling he already knew see as it hadn’t been long since the meeting with the old goat.
“That is exactly who this is Cissa, his relatives were horrible to him, Lucius might have saved him enough by fixing his lungs, but he’s still in terrible shape,” Severus said as he put Harry down on the bed and got him to undress so Cissa could assess the situation.
They spent three wonderful days, roaming around the parks laughing, taking pictures having nothing but pure enjoyment. When it was time to leave everyone put on their masks to not show their emotions in front of Harry, who in the past three days had finally come out of his shell and had bonded with everyone especially Severus and Tom who seem to have taken on a parental role for Harry. “Are you ready to go Harry?” Severus asked as he came into the room to make sure everything was packed up then he saw something was wrong with Harry, he was still asleep, but he was tossing around, and it looked like he was screaming but Severus couldn’t hear anything. That was until he got closer to the bed and the wave of the silence charm passed through him, what he heard coming out of Harry made his blood grow cold. “NO!! LEAVE THEM ALONE! THEY DIDN’T DO ANYTHING WRONG. LET THEM GO PLEASE I’LL GO WITH YOU JUST LEAVE THEM ALONE!! NO, NO DRACO!” Harry Screamed but nothing he did would let him out of this nightmare, Severus did the only thing he could think of he let his mind open into Harry’s and what he saw sent him over the rail.
After that the rest of the train ride was quite and no one else interrupted the boys. They finally arrived at Hogwarts. Having got dressed 10 minutes early Harry and his friends left the train to go to the boats. “First Yrs follow meh. First yrs over herr.” A Giant looking man said gathering everyone to the boats.
September 1st was just a week away and the boys had just got their letters, “I wonder why our letters are so late?” Harry asked looking as his fathers after four years learning that James Potter was just his adopted dad Harry had gotten used to Severus and Tom but deep down knew that there had been something more than just an Uncle type bond between them how else would Harry have been able to communicate with Severus if he weren’t blood related. “Professor McGonagall must be behind on paper work, which means Diagon Alley is going to be packed.” Severus said groaning he hated crowds almost as much as Harry did who still has a hard time being around new people. “Well we could go today, with everyone just now getting their letters it shouldn’t be too packed.” Tom suggested hoping that it was true he also didn’t like crowds and the last time it was hard on Harry to not have a full-blown panic attack. “Can we go dad? I would like to get it done so Draco and I can relax the rest of the week before having to deal with Dumble and his nonstop attempt to compel me.” Harry said with distaste whenever Dumbledore is mentioned, he hated the fact that his school years were going to be anything but nice and relaxing as a student should be. “Of course, Harry we can go, why don’t you and Draco get dressed and let Uncle Lucy and Aunt Cissy know.” Severus said smiling at the fact that Harry hated Dumbledore as much as they did probably more since it was Dumbledore that killed his mom.
Remus Lupin I know James left you something but because this is my will you have to take it, I leave vault 585 which has a few chests in it. Sirius Black, I leave you vault 690 don’t talk James into anything crazy please. I wish to let it be known that Peter Pettigrew is the secret keeper for our house in Godrics Hollow; Albus was the binder if anything happens to us there, look to those two. Albus Dumbledore leave my husband and son alone we already told you, that we withdrew ourselves from the Order and from this war, that prophecy is fishy and should be investigated.
“Yes, Harry, it really happened; you no longer have to worry about your aunt or uncle. Your cousin is in the hospital getting the help he needs but has no memory of you or his parents.” Severus explained, praying that Harry was going to be alright.
“Severus, who is this little child? When you said you found him, I thought you meant Harry.” Cissa said, looking over at the child, who was no bigger than a three-year-old.
"I wasn't going to say anything," Harry continues. He's unable to stop a gentle smile from lifting the corners of his lips. "Not when you're notorious for, you know, your flings. But since you said it first..."
Malfoy takes a sip of his tea and gazes contemplatively into the distance. Harry takes the opportunity to shove a rather large forkful of treacle tart into his mouth and regrets it immediately when crumbs start to rain down onto his robes. He brushes them aside hastily, hoping Malfoy didn’t see.
they friends?—it'll be fun to have Malfoy owe him one, it's just one night of bodyguarding his favorite rival in the world, what could possibly go wrong—but they all quiet down when Malfoy flashes him a smile. A genuine, truly happy smile. It's gone almost as soon as Harry sees it, but it's branded into his memory.
When Harry lifts his head from the table, Malfoy is already half way across the cafeteria. When the blond hears Harry’s deep sigh of resignation, he turns around and offers an echoey, “don’t be late!” and disappears.
It's like he's been hit with a brick wall, not unlike the one he and Ron crashed into their second-year at Platform Nine and Three Quarters. It takes him a second for his ears to stop ringing and another few seconds to remember to breathe.
As Malfoy directs them to what Harry presumes is his bedroom, Harry takes in the flat; there’s a kitchen that looks like it came straight out of a interior design magazine, and a sitting room with chairs probably worth more than his racing broom collection combined. But Malfoy’s bedroom is plainly decorated—still classy, of course, but stark compared to the rooms where guests were welcome. Before he can analyze this, however, Harry’s attention falls on the plush four poster bed pushed against a wall and his fingers falter on his belt buckle.
"Look." Malfoy turns and focuses on picking at his cuticles, a forced air of casual disinterest. "I only hex people because I don't want to deal with them again. Good lay, bad fuck, it doesn't matter—the people I sleep with are one-time visitors because I want them to be, and they usually refuse to leave unless I force them to. They seem to think one night together implies I'm interested in pursuing anything longer than a quick fuck. So they get clingy. And I hex them when they don't take 'no' for an answer."
Malfoy sighs impatiently. “If that’s how you need to phrase it for your primitive brain to understand it, fine,” he says with an air of grandeur that makes Harry feel rather stupid.
“Right,” Harry says, his cheeks ablaze. He chooses to Apparate to his bedroom because the last thing he needs is to give Malfoy a view of his ass while he runs (plus his hands are busy covering other parts of him) and slams the door closed. Through the wood floor he can hear Malfoy chuckle and the flipping of a page. Under other circumstances, he would be mortified but as the scene replays in his mind, Harry can’t help but focus on the glimmer of interest in Malfoy’s eyes when he first turned towards him.
“You’ll meet someone, Harry,” Hermione had told him when he first expressed the feeling of loneliness, “you just need to get out there more.” But the only problem was he didn’t want to find a stranger; the few dates he’d gone on had ended rather poorly after the other party admitted their awe at being in the presence of The Harry Potter, and they always admitted that. But he’s happy for his friends, he reminds himself, and so when Ron grabs his cloak to leave, Harry wishes him a restful lunch break and promises that yes, he’ll make sure to eat something later.
Harry clicks his tongue impatiently. “That’s not the point,” he interrupts huffily, but Malfoy only grins wider at his petulance. “I’m trying to say that you’re all charm and no substance—”
The wizard stops moving, but doesn’t detach himself. “Who’re you?” the man asks without showing his face.
“I’m sorry, Mr. Potter, but your name isn’t on the list,” the man says apologetically. “I can speak with the host—”
The first wizard takes one look at Malfoy and turns red. He marches up to him to do Merlin knows what, but is distracted by a passing server carrying slices of chocolate cake. Harry takes that opportunity to drag Malfoy through a crowd of dancers to the opposite side of the tent.
They stare at each other again; with each silent moment that passes, Harry tries to read Malfoy's eyes. He'd always thought gray eyes were intriguing (although now that he thinks about it, maybe he's always just thought Malfoy's eyes were—are—intriguing) and now, he's even more confident that gray is the most beautiful color eyes could be.
“Because you’re a stubborn prat.” Malfoy emphasizes each word with a thrust of his hips, leaving Harry both indignant and more turned on than ever. “Stop talking and come on.”
Harry snaps his gaze to Malfoy's face, embarrassed, just in time to see Malfoy's eyes hurriedly snap upwards. He registers a faint blotchy blush on Malfoy's cheeks though, and the sight of it wears down his guard just a tad. "I could say the same to you, Malfoy," he teases affectionately.
Aforementioned brain is having a hard time thinking of coherent thoughts. The only thought that Harry can retain is the observation that Malfoy is so close to him that their chests are nearly pressed together. “Er—”
“Welcome, everyone, to the annual St. Mungo’s Charity Ball,” she calls with a voice magnified to echo around the room. She’s greeted with enthusiastic applause and cheers and she beams at the fanfare. “Thank you, thank you… May I introduce tonight’s distinguished guest”—Harry’s heart leaps to his throat; she wasn’t going to call out his name, was she?—“the Head of Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes…”
“So,” Malfoy says conspiratorially as he leans forward again, “I see it as this: I know you’ve still got that savior complex in there somewhere, which means you like saving people. Whether it’s because you actually like doing it or because the moral high ground gets you off is still up for debate, but the fact of the matter is you do. However, as we're considering this hypothetical situation, you like being the hero"—he holds up a hand when Harry opens his mouth to object—"but you don't like doing it on other people's terms."
Malfoy scoffs. “Right. That’s why I always see you alone—walking alone, working alone, eating alone… Where’s Weasley gone?”
"Keep this up and I'm leaving," Harry threatens, though he knows he's in no state to leave. Not when Malfoy is laid out so beautifully against the mattress, not when his gray eyes are blown wide with lust; Malfoy's a siren illuminated by the purest rays of sun, beckoning to him from across dark murky waters with songs of pleasure and Harry is the weathered sailor who knows of the dangers and yet can't stop himself from drawing closer, diving deeper...
They’re just talking like two friends, he notes. He can’t really tell how Malfoy’s reacting except for the steadily darkening blush—whether it was from the glass in his hand, the warmth of the tent, or the heat of the wizard’s words Harry wasn’t sure. Wandering closer, Harry strains to make out any bit of the conversation.
The wizard lifts his head from where it was tucked into Malfoy’s neck, still not looking at Harry. “You didn’t tell me you came with someone,” he accuses.
Harry grits his teeth. The wizard and Malfoy are practically intertwined, bodies pressed as tightly as possible without shedding their clothes. No, this wouldn’t be good for the Malfoy image at all, and Harry can only imagine the Howler he’d get from Malfoy if he let this end up on the front page. So, with a deep breath to calm himself down, he strolls up to the pair, noting idly that the wizard has a leg pressed between Malfoy’s thighs and that they’re both undulating their hips ever so slightly. Harry blinks hard, and has to remind himself what he’s doing.
Malfoy rolls his eyes as he rolls up the sleeves of his robes. “No judgement here, Potter,” he says. “Under other circumstances I would be trying to pull myself…” His gray eyes dart around the tent, and Harry notices his gaze linger on a dark-skinned wizard across the room. (He ignores the uncomfortable churning in his stomach). “But you,” Malfoy continues. “You have a job to do.”
Harry crosses the room, feeling everyone’s eyes on him. He sighs inwardly; it’s been nearly five years since the war and despite Hermione explaining to him over and over that people were still going to treat him like a hero, he doesn’t understand it. Whenever someone brings up what he did, he politely points out that he was only seventeen at the time, and shouldn’t have had to do what he did—he always takes a small bit of pride as the other person’s smile sours. But he can’t exactly point that out to an entire room full of high ranking officials, now can he? Instead he puts a professional look on his face and forges onward, to where Kingsley is standing with various directors he vaguely recognizes.
Ron clicks his tongue in sympathy. “Sorry mate,” he says, digging around his cluttered desk for a quill. When he finds one, he scribbles something onto a piece of parchment and, with a flourish of his wand, it folds itself into a bird and flies through the open door.
“Clearly, seeing as you’ve told me I’m both handsome and charming.” With a knowing look, the blond glances around the room. They’re situated at the edge of the tent across from where Malfoy had run into his latest ex-lover. The lights shining onto the middle of the dance floor barely touch this part of the venue. Even the servers, ubiquitous as they are, don’t wander this way.
Everyone else hears his name too, and out of the corner of his eye Harry sees the wizard in murky green robes turn and stare at him, giving Malfoy just enough time to slip away. Before he does though, his gray eyes slide over to Harry’s and Malfoy gives him the slightest nod before disappearing into the crowd of black cloaks around the edge of the room.
Harry’s about to go cross-eyed trying to keep eye contact with Malfoy as he continues to lean closer. The more mutinous half of Harry urges him to meet Malfoy halfway while the rational half screams to take a step back. Frozen with indecision, Harry can only swallow thickly and muster, “and what would that be?”
“Dinner will be served soon, so keep it down will you? I brought you along to diffuse tension, not to draw attention.” Malfoy faces the witch and wizard with a politely disinterested expression.
“Go on then, Potter,” Malfoy says with a lazy wave of his hand and an equally lazy smirk. “I assume you’re civilized enough to have purchased your dress robes in advance. I’ll just be here.” He perches on the sitting room couch and conjures a magazine to flip through.
It was then, just as he noticed the loner, that someone walks past his office muttering, “I can’t believe they kept me here so late,” and reminds Harry to check his watch.
“I mean,” Malfoy continues, his eyes shamelessly tracking up and down Harry’s exposed body, “I’m not complaining. But I think others might.”
Harry ignores the jab—Malfoy's cheeks are now bright red and his barbs have no real heat in them. It's almost like... Harry's chest tightens when he realizes—Malfoy's being open. Genuine.
The secretary at the end of the hallway gives him a bright smile, which he returns with what he hopes isn’t as grimace-like as it feels, and grabs a pinch of Floo powder from the urn beside the fireplace. “Auror Department,” he declares before stepping into the flames.
“Thank you kindly,” Malfoy says with a shark-like grin as he takes his band from the man’s hand. Harry notices that he lets his fingers linger on the man’s palm longer than necessary.
He sees Malfoy swallow and puff out his chest, posture stiff and tense. "Got a problem with that?" he asks, and despite his cool exterior Harry can tell that his response will have consequences—whether good ones or bad ones all depend on what he says next.
This is apparently what Malfoy was hoping he’d say, because his eyes narrow in victory. “Oh come on,” Malfoy drawls in an innocent tone. “Use that brain of yours, Potter. Or is the blood going elsewhere?”
It’s not that Harry isn’t happy for his two best friends; he was delighted when they finally announced that they were together and he even told them it was about time. But sometimes he can’t help the empty hole that opens inside of him when Ron and Hermione do the things that he one day hoped to do with someone special—years ago he had wanted that person to be Ginny, and now he was just lost.
With his long legs, Malfoy reaches the table at the front of the tent first. Harry’s only a few steps behind him, which allows him to overhear the conversation the he’s having with the wizard seated at the table.
“This isn’t my place,” he manages breathily, words punctuated by moans as Malfoy sucks at the skin under his jaw.
“Apologies for calling you away from your work, Auror Potter,” Kingsley says. Harry wants to tell him it’s no problem, he wasn’t really doing his work anyway (unless you count enchanting folded parchment animals to parade around your desk), but decides to keep that bit to himself. “But I believe that your Head of Department informed you of several appearances we’d like for you to make over the next fortnight?”
The man’s sneer turns into a snarl. “I’d watch your mouth if I were you,” he growls, rising menacingly to his feet and slamming a finger into Malfoy’s chest. To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy stands his ground; to Harry’s alarm, he can see the man’s wand in his hand, mere inches from the blond.
“It’s as good as it gets,” Harry tries to explain before he realizes he’s arguing with a sentient mirror while Malfoy's waiting—impatiently, judging by the tempo of his shoes tapping against the floor—downstairs.
"No," he says, and even Harry’s surprised at how earnest the truth sounds coming from his own mouth.
The man jerks like he’s been stung with a Stinging Jinx. He whirls around and stares at Harry, like he can’t believe his eyes. (Although, now that Harry thinks about it, he probably doesn’t—it’s not often the wizarding world sees Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy attending the same event and arriving at the same time). “S-sorry, Mr. Potter, right away,” the man stammers. Harry returns Malfoy’s pointed stare as the man rifles through the sheets of parchment in front of him.
The moment Harry touches Malfoy’s elbow, he feels a tugging sensation at the back of his navel and his sight becomes blurred with streaks of warm yellow, a dark blue, and black. He can feel his stomach complaining as his vision becomes incoherent, but before he can even think to throw up, his roaring in his ears disappears.
Of course, Harry sees Malfoy most commonly in the cafeteria, though the blond is usually surrounded by a select few coworkers and friends, one of whom Harry recognizes as former Slytherin Millicent Bullstrode, who sported a badge on her robes indicating she worked for the Floo Network Authority. Now, however, Malfoy is sitting alone and ignoring him (not that he expected a hug, but not even a nod of acknowledgement?), and on top of everything else that’s happened today Harry decides it’s been a bad enough day to warrant eating his favorite treacle tart for lunch.
“Depends.” Malfoy stoops until his lips are right next to Harry’s ear. With a sharp nip to Harry’s earlobe, he whispers, “would you rather fuck me in your bed or mine?”
“You mean like, all the shit we got up to at Hogwarts?” Ron grins and Harry can’t help the small smile that creeps onto his face. “I hardly recall Dumbledore telling you to take your cloak and sneak into Hogsmeade.”
Any other interactions with Malfoy were limited to polite nods and brief conversation while waiting for tea from the cafe in the atrium of the Ministry. The first time Harry saw the mop of blonde hair standing in line he’d nearly tripped over his own feet. Turns out Malfoy had recently been hired in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes as a member of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad—“if you spent enough time around Crabbe and Goyle, you’d be good at reversing accidents too,” he once told Harry under his breath—and occupied his days with researching the dangerousness of various rare ingredients. Harry had only been to Level 3 a couple times, mostly to check up on suspects who’d somehow been Obliviated, but he had never once seen Malfoy in any of the AMRS offices.
When they’re out of earshot, Malfoy lets out a delighted whoop. “The look on his face,” he cries delightedly. “Oh, Merlin, that was priceless. See?” Malfoy punches Harry jovially in the arm. “I told you, Potter, no one would dare touch me with you around.”
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “I don’t care about those words,” he says airily. “I’m almost speechless that you think I’m handsome and charming. I’m flattered, really, I didn’t think you could pick out someone with good taste even if he were standing naked in front of you.”
“I know what I said,” Malfoy interrupts grumpily. He pauses for a beat then groans. “Merlin knows how you managed to save the world with no capacity for intelligent thought.” He purses his lips. “Then again, Granger was always the brains of the operation—“
“What! No,” Harry sputters. “I am not hitting on you—I’m saying you have a handsome face and that’s it!“
“Piss off,” Harry mutters, looking around to see if any of the people at their table had overheard. Based on their relatively not-that-scandalized expressions, he breathes a sigh of relief.
"Should I write a letter of recommendation to the Minister, Potter? You should be promoted with this intellect of yours."
? A charged silence fills the room as the two men gaze at each other, though Malfoy seems unaware of the inner turmoil in Harry's mind.
“I said,” Harry over-articulates, straightening and looking Malfoy in the eye. (He realizes too late that it’s a bad idea, but he’s already committed and he’s nothing if not a stubborn Gryffindor to boot). “I can’t believe I have to explain sarcasm to you. I’m calling you a handsome face because that’s all you are.”
Harry blinks. “You’re being forced to attend this ‘event’ and you’re afraid of getting hexed?” he translates.
Harry opens his mouth to protest—honestly, how dare Malfoy insinuate he didn’t know how to read a clock—but the blond is already walking through the grass to the entrance of the tent. With a sigh, Harry follows.
It's a lovely venue in the countryside. They’ve Apparated on the outskirts of a field surrounded by trees, in the middle of which stands a warmly lit tent. Inside he can see people dancing on a vast dance floor, as well as servers dressed sharply in black and white dress robes, roaming around with platters of food.
Ron is at his side as soon as he steps onto the familiar rug in front of the Auror Department’s non-emergency fireplace.
“Who says I’m limited to witches?” Harry retorts without thinking. His own words register in his brain a second before it does in Malfoy’s, and by the time the blond turns to stare inquisitively at him, he’s got a bright red blush covering his cheeks. “Er…”
"A variety of reasons," Malfoy says airily. He picks up his tea and starts to swirl it around in the cup. "Wives, concubines, mothers, sometimes..."
Harry gets about twenty minutes of peace, during which he downs two goblets of Firewhiskey and a glass of elf-made wine, before the third ex-lover appears. This one doesn’t look angry, nor does he sneer at Malfoy, but Harry watches uneasily from a distance anyway. The wizard saunters up to Malfoy, who’s leaning against a tent post, and the two start talking in quiet whispers. Harry can see Malfoy’s left eyebrow rise towards his hairline, and the faintest blush dusting his cheeks—
"Old habits," Harry admits. "When someone tells me they have a habit of hexing people out of their apartment and I find myself in that exact predicament, I can't help but be a bit wary."
The next morning, Harry awakes with a desperate pressure on his bladder. Cursing under his breath, he stands up so fast that his head spins and his heart pounds—and no, that has nothing to do with the sleeping figure of Draco Malfoy, arm still outstretched like it was still draped over Harry’s waist. Thoughts of the previous night are whirling in his mind as he stumbles into the bathroom. He glances at himself in the mirror while he relieves himself—bruised, scratched, satisfied.
Not the time, he hisses at himself. He grabs his dress robes from his closet—they’re a couple of years old, but he hasn’t worn these in a while so they’ll have to do—and runs his wand over the garment. The wrinkles disappear immediately, leaving smooth green velvet in its place. (He ignores the smoke rising from the seam where he'd waved his wand a bit too vigorously at it). In a few minutes, Harry examines himself in his mirror.
Harry snorts. His stomach chooses that moment to growl loudly enough that Malfoy shoots him a displeased look. “I haven’t eaten all day,” he hisses in defense.
Harry nearly spits crumbs onto the table. Surely Malfoy is joking… But the longer Harry stares at him, the more certain he is that somehow, Malfoy isn’t joking. Finally, Harry frowns.
He looks up from his musings to see Malfoy examining him with a raised brow. "Have you had enough time to think it through that slow brain of yours?" he asks.
The man doesn’t look away from Malfoy, but his wand does suddenly disappear back into his sleeve. “Can I help you?” he spits.
That gets a reaction. Malfoy spins so fast that the sheets become further entangled around his body, wrapping him up in a cocoon of soft cotton. With his back to Harry, body wound so tightly into a ball, he huffs a bitter laugh. "Congratulations, Harry fucking Potter solves yet another mystery."
“Must I remind you that you’re here to make sure I don’t die a horrible death, not to seduce a helpless girl?”
“Hermione,” he says, and in retrospect it should’ve been obvious. “We’re going out for lunch today, and she’s just told me where.”
There, they run into the second one: this time a haughty looking witch with electric blue hair who, upon catching sight of Malfoy, smiles toothily, giving them both a top dollar view of her teeth turning into dagger-like fangs. Harry whisks Malfoy away as fast as he can, the blond happily telling him how fun it was to bed a Metamorphmagus.
"Well," he says after a tense pause. His voice cracks but he pushes on. "It's only fair I answer your question."
Instantaneously Malfoy's shoulders drop from their hunched position by his neck. He turns and stares incredulously with unreadable eyes.
Malfoy smiles thinly. “Charming as ever, aren’t you? And yet you continue to wonder why I kicked you out my front door the morning after.”
Was this a trap? What if Malfoy got him comfortable and proceeded to hex the living hell out of him? Harry’s wand is across the room in the pocket of his dress robes from last night—if it came down to it, surely Malfoy would get to his wand first before Harry could get to his.
“Dunno,” Harry grumbles. He pulls out his wand and waves it at the locked door of the office he shares with Ron and steps inside once the door swings open. Ron returns to his desk across the room while Harry collapses into his chair. He watches a folded parchment elephant lumber across a stack of case files, trampling a parchment frog in its haste.
Malfoy's head twitches like he wants to turn back and look at Harry, but his face remains out of sight.
A promise which he promptly forgets, and by the time he looks up again it’s been at least an hour and Ron’s probably on his way back. With a groan, Harry gathers his cloak and heads to the cafeteria lest Ron come back and lecture him about the importance of three hearty meals a day.
“He’s annoying and whiney, but he’s got a quick tongue on him.” Malfoy sends him a sly wink and Harry blushes. He blames the liquor. “Plus,” Malfoy continues. “I’m bored. The Charity Ball is a pitiful excuse for a social calling and I needed a little something to wake me up.”
He’s just about to summon the most recent issue of Seeker Weekly to read over his lunch when the chair across from him is suddenly occupied.
He's definitely using Legilimency, Harry thinks, because wasn't it just a few minutes ago he had been hoping for a chance to do something because he wanted to, not because someone else had told him to?
Malfoy gives him a look. "Just because I'm potentially interested in seeing you again doesn't guarantee a relationship."
Harry smirks. “That’s one sexy bed,” he says, barely suppressing a grin when Malfoy frowns and looks between his own naked body and the bed. To hide his smile, Harry tosses his dress robes casually over the back of a chair while Malfoy sputters.
As it’s later in the afternoon, the cafeteria is nearly empty when Harry arrives, except for one table in the far corner where a man with shocking blond hair sits with perfect posture as he wandlessly stirs his tea. Harry’s so busy staring at Malfoy that he walks right into a chair, its metal legs screeching against the marble floor. Malfoy looks up, makes eye contact with Harry, and rolls his eyes before returning to his tea. Harry scoffs, though any irritation he might have felt doesn’t rise up in him.
Harry frowns, seconds away from retorting when realizes he’s probably right. “Then why’d you give me a—ah,
“What? I’m not—” Harry turns back to the server but she’s already disappeared. “Malfoy! What the hell?”
? The Charity Ball? Oh, bollocks," he moans, because of course it's the Charity Ball, of course it's the one event where the attendees consist of the richest, most influential wizards and witches who all care about status and networking and—he groans as the puzzle clicks in his head. Of course Malfoy wants him there; with Harry as his escort, no wizard in their right mind would dare approach him with their wand drawn. Merlin, what had he gotten himself into?
. Not really thinking it through, Harry grabs another glass of wine and takes a gulp, just so his hands can have something to do while he watches Malfoy and the wizard interact.
The man grits his teeth. “You’re welcome,” he manages, turning so red that Harry’s worried he might burst. Harry grabs Malfoy’s arm and leads him away from the doorman before spells go flying.
"Hard to say. One stops keeping count after a while." Malfoy is very nonchalant about the prospect of leaving the venue with boils, bat-bogeys, jelly-legs, or whatever else these people might throw at him. Harry is slightly impressed.
Harry swallows. He can’t admit it to Malfoy—Malfoy, of all people—but he’s right. And, judging by the smirk that’s growing ever smugger, Malfoy knows he’s right. But Harry won’t back down that easily. “All right,” he says gruffly. “Suppose, hypothetically, that I don’t necessarily enjoy these outings that Kingsley sends me on. So what?”
Ron frowns, tapping his quill—the wrong end; the splotch of ink is growing and Harry can’t bring himself to tell him—against his chin. “You mean like taking on sponsorships? Or collaborations?”
“For once in my life I’d like to do something because I want to, not because someone else told me to. Is that too much to ask?”
They’ve been cordial, which is still strange for Harry to think about. He helped the Malfoys during their trial, gladly clearing Narcissa of all charges and—somewhat reluctantly—reducing Lucius’s Azkaban sentence by a few years. Draco Malfoy had gotten off lightly, as he’d been young and Harry, remembering the terror in his eyes that night on the Astronomy tower, had spoken on his behalf. A few days after the trial, he’d received an owl asking if he’d be willing to meet up in person, and after a long discussion with Ron and Hermione in which Ron was convinced Malfoy would ambush him and Hermione urged him to go, he decided that even if Malfoy attacked him, his reflexes were probably faster. Plus, his curiosity got the best of him.
“I sincerely hope you’re not planning on attending the Charity Ball in…that,” comes the haughty drawl.
He feels everyone’s eyes on him as he crosses the room to leave, and only when he’s three steps from the door does he let an annoyed scowl slide onto his face. Harry can hear Hermione’s voice in his ear, chastising him for being ungrateful that he has the opportunity to use his platform to speak up against injustices, but Harry only grits his teeth harder. He’s been doing that his whole life, hasn’t he? Harry pushes through the door and lets it slam closed behind him. The resounding bang is louder than he expects and he winces, but doesn’t turn around to apologize.
“He’s making up absolute nonsense,” Malfoy informs him. “I heard him practicing his speech in his office the other day. I liked the other version much better, much more entertaining to hear him swear every time he forgot his lines, which, might I add, was quite often.”
"Let me see if I have this right." Harry shifts so that he's facing Malfoy, though the blond still refuses to look him in the eye. He tries to keep his tone gentle and kind, like the one he'd use to speak with the children at the scene of a crime. "You've neither hexed nor forced me out because I'm not being clingy?"
Malfoy waves his hands dismissively. “Sure, sure,” he says. “Whatever you say, Potter. I’m sure you wouldn’t be out here taking home witches anyway, am I right?”
“Perfect,” Malfoy says brightly. “With that look on your face no one would dare come after me. Especially not with the illustrious Harry Potter as my escort—”
He's never been in this situation before; years of schooling and Auror training have never prepared him for a case like this. Looking at Malfoy's back—covered in scratches and red marks—Harry's mind whirls with possible next steps. The last thing he wants to do is offend him or make him regret opening up, so he decides to equal the playing field.
By the time Harry steps out of the bathroom, Malfoy is awake. Eyes still closed, the blond stretches languidly, reminding Harry of a cat. Malfoy’s wand is still on the nightstand so Harry decides it’s safe to approach, though he does so warily just in case Malfoy tries to hex him out of the flat like he does with everyone else.
Malfoy swallows. "Not quite," he mutters. Like he can't control it, Malfoy's limbs begin to wrap around himself until he's sitting with his knees hugged tightly into his chest. Harry's seen this before—it's a defensive position for someone's who sharing something uncomfortable; he's seen this plenty of times when questioning witnesses.
No really—he’s put that savior life behind him, no matter how much Ron and Hermione would like to disagree. Or, perhaps more accurately, it’s not like he did it on purpose; all he did was walk into a room full of high ranking Ministry officials, and just as he notices a particularly uptight Malfoy with a cold smile and dagger-throwing eyes being verbally accosted by someone in murky green robes, he hears his name from across the room.
Malfoy smacks him on the shoulder. “Speak up,” he snarks. “I can’t hear you with those giant hands covering your mouth.”
“Not my fault you’re unobservant,” Malfoy tells him. He pushes off the tent pole and walks towards Harry, who can’t seem to look him in the eyes without replaying the memory of Malfoy’s narrow hips pressing against his own—
"Very smooth, Potter." Malfoy smirks at him from below, his hair mused and ruffled from Harry's impatient fingers. "Keep this up and maybe I'll come by tomorrow morning."
“What was that all about, mate?” he asks, falling into step with Harry as he heads back to his office.
"No, no, you misunderstand. I'm not judging—don't think I've any right to judge, anyway—I'm merely surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't run an exclusive on you and your latest gentleman caller."
Despite the compromising position he’s in, Malfoy still scoffs haughtily. “You’re a wizard, aren’t you?” he taunts, the shakiness in his voice the only indication that he’s not as composed as he seems.
With a shrug, Malfoy lifts the wizard off and straightens out his robes. For someone in a rather compromising position two seconds ago, he looks annoyingly put together. The other man, on the other hand, is showcasing swollen red lips and a chest that’s heaving for air.
When he Apparates to the sitting room, Malfoy doesn’t even react. He finishes the sentence he’s on, Banishes the magazine, and opens his mouth to say something (probably something about how Harry was late) when his eyes land on Harry. His mouth closes. Opens again, and closes again.
“It’s open,” he calls, so overwhelmed with all that he needs to do before Malfoy gets here—need to put on clothes, he thinks as his naked body shivers, need to shower, probably comb my hair—that he fails to notice Malfoy stepping through his front door.
"What?" Harry knows Malfoy enjoys the fine things in life—only the best food, women, and wine—but to that degree? Merlin. He can only gape at him.
"Okay. Now will you finally come here? I don't get to lie in very often and you've already deprived me of a good portion of one."
It’s not his fault—a case he had been stuck on finally made some forward progress thanks to a brilliant insight from Ron (“Hold on, Harry, what if he didn’t leave the scene once we arrived? How many Aurors were dispatched in total and how many returned to the Ministry, do the numbers match up?”) and because they were so excited to have some semblance of movement in the case, Harry dedicated his entire rest of the day to confirming the identities of every Auror who worked that day. He’d gotten all of the pictures of the crime scene from the photographer and spent an hour just figuring out who was who. In the end, he’d put a name to each moving black and white face—except for the figure sulking in the corner, trying to stay out of frame.
“You certainly couldn’t stop watching my mouth that night,” Malfoy says in a tauntingly calm tone. It’s like he doesn’t even notice or care that he’s three seconds away from being jinxed.
Harry squirms under Malfoy's intense analysis. How did he know? He's beginning to regret not paying more attention when he was learning Occlumency.
“Fuck, Malfoy!” Harry whirls around, his hands flying to keep some semblance of modesty. Despite his inner chaos, Harry doesn’t fail to notice that the blond is impeccably dressed in silver dress robes that compliment his eyes nicely.
With a soft laugh, Harry raises both hands in mock surrender. "Fine, fine. No matter. I'm just glad I forced you to say anything at all."
Malfoy leans closer. “I already told you,” he whispers, his warm breath tickling the bridge of Harry’s nose. He smells of Firewhiskey and cologne, and it’s intoxicating. “The threat of hexes don’t do it for me anymore. But there’s something else that will…”
"Lovely," the blond says. With a flick of his wand, he sends the tea zooming back to the cafeteria's counter and rises to his feet. "The St. Mungo's Charity Ball is on—"
A whole evening with Malfoy at this mysterious event of his. Five years ago Harry would have laughed in his face and left, but now he's not afraid to admit he's at least a little bit curious. It's been so long since he's gotten to attend something as a normal guest and not the guest of honor; plus, he really wants to know who wants to hex Malfoy, why they want to do it, and what it’d take to get in that line.
The blond leads him to what he presumes is their table, and immediately two servers appear at their side.
"—when the sound of a fork on glass echoes throughout the tent and their attentions are drawn to the middle of the tent, where a wizard in shimmering golden robes is striding onto the dance floor. Beside him, a witch in a bright pink dress—Harry almost mistakes her for Umbridge, Merlin forbid—points her wand to her throat, whispers “
After a few moments of blissful silence Malfoy lets out a long exhale, though his eyes remain shut. “Are you just going to stare at me, Potter, or were you planning on getting back in bed?”
“Right.” Malfoy crosses his arms and shifts his weight over one leg, his hip jutting out deliciously. “And how is that not hitting on me?”
“Morning,” Harry says slowly, cautiously. He watches as Malfoy stills and tilts his head toward the sound of Harry’s voice. Merlin, his hair is a halo splayed out across the pillow, almost glowing in the few rays of sunlight that pass through the clouds. Harry doesn’t dare move, for fear of startling him.
“Minister,” he greets when he arrives at Kingsley’s side. The Minister’s dark blue robes are charmed to glisten with faraway stars whenever he moves, and Harry witnesses the sight firsthand when Kingsley raises an arm to shake his hand. All around him, conversations resume and the directors step away to give them some privacy, though some of the nosier ones stay in eyeshot.
“Misters Malfoy and Potter,” they greet with a slight bow. Harry blushes—the way they grouped their names makes it sound like they’re together—but Malfoy merely hands one of the servers his outer robes. Harry hastens to do the same, laying his cloak over the other’s forearm with a smile. The server smiles at him, her eyes bright with awe, and he offers her a quick quirk of his lips in return.
Harry licks his lips absently, trying to gather his thoughts, and is promptly distracted by Malfoy’s gaze flicking down to his mouth. Merlin, he’s never getting out of here alive. “Where to?” he finally manages to croak.
“I don’t even know,” Harry laments. “Twinings told me the other day but I was hardly paying any attention. Suppose it’s the same as always, just wave at the crowd and read something off the prompter.”
It takes Harry a moment to process what's been laid down in front of him. “Him?” he echoes rather intelligently.
Yes, Harry wants to say. “No,” he says instead. “Not if you’re going to curse me the second I close my eyes.”
Harry’s lust-muddled brain takes nearly two minutes to register that he is not in Grimmauld Place. It’s the soft plush carpet around his feet that finally gives it away. Detaching himself from Malfoy, who promptly starts marking his neck with nips and bites, Harry looks around.
“Looking sharp,” his mirror tells him proudly. Then, dejectedly, “shame there’s nothing we can do about the hair though.”
"You'd asked me if I was interested in anything longer than a one-time lay?" Harry reminds him. "My honest answer is yes."
“You prick!“ The wizard turns to yell after Malfoy. His eyes land on Harry and widen. “No,” the wizard says with an incredulous laugh. “Potter? You actually came here with Potter? Draco, you’ve got to be kidding me!”
“What,” Harry says shortly. He doesn’t have the patience to deal with Malfoy’s usual jabs about his appearance, not when he’s moved mountains to get ready so quickly. For Merlin’s sake, he was still in the office just ten minutes ago!
“Oh,” he hears one witch squeal vindictively, “Melody is going to be so upset she ditched me at the last second!”
"Then"—Harry's heart beats harder, because if it isn't his first theory, then it can only be his second theory (or his third, but he tries not to get his hopes up)—"you haven't kicked me out or hexed me because I haven't implied that I'm interested in anything longer than a one-time lay?"
“My apologies, it must’ve been a while since you tried to use your head,” Malfoy murmurs, rapping Harry sharply on the side of his skull. “I mean this one, of course. Allow me to spell it out for you then: I’m bored and I’d like to leave.”
“Maybe,” Harry says, but those don’t feel quite right. He’s suddenly annoyed again when he can’t come up with the right words to describe how he feels, and he buries himself in his paperwork, angrily brushing his paper zoo into the bin. Ron thankfully gets the message and starts scribbling on various forms, only pausing when a neatly folded paper bird soars onto his desk.
Now that Harry’s nearer, he notices how closely they’re standing. Their hips are practically joined, like the wizard is purposefully pushing Malfoy against the tent post—and Malfoy is letting him. The blond has a smug smirk hanging from his lips as the wizard leans in to whisper something into his ear and even as Harry watches, Malfoy's breath hitches and his pale lips part in a quiet gasp.
He doesn’t like the grin that’s lifting the corners of Malfoy’s lips. He almost looks predatory as he leans closer to Harry, resting his chin in his hands in an innocent gesture. “Oh?” Malfoy murmurs. “Pray tell, is the famous Harry Potter
Malfoy breaks the silence first. "If I promise not to hex you, will you relax? Not everyone's trying to kill you, you know."
“I’m rather used to it,” Malfoy says with a grin. Now that they’re out of the crowd again, he gestures grandly at himself in his silver robes with both hands, an obligatory twirl sending his robes spiraling elegantly around his thin frame. “Keeps me in high demand, you know. Everyone’s always looking for a handsome face, regardless of whatever false rumors follow him.”
A couple of days after the visit that left two boys bonded Cissa and the other thought it was time for the wills of Harry’s parents to be read as well as ask the goblins to do a purge and an inheritance test. “Think we should talk to Harry first about the wills, he agreed to the purge but doesn’t understand why we want to do an inheritance test on him.” Severus Said after talking to Harry last night about what the purge and inheritance do Severus wasn’t sure on why Cissa is wanting the test done but it seems that when she was doing a health screen on Harry something was a little different than things should be. “I am fine with the wills, I just don’t understand the inheritance test so I will make a suggestion if my parents wills state I should have one done I will get one does that work?” Harry said as he walked into the library looking concerned that they would be mad about him eavesdropping. Severus smiled the boy always seemed to have the right answer to the most serious of situations, they agreed to the suggestion and all of them agreed to have the wills read that the Ministry in front of the court a couple of days after Harry’s seventh birthday.
Harry fell asleep in Draco’s arms, which was not very comfortable, but Draco didn’t seem to mind if they had been in a bed rather than the couch. “Here Draco, I will take him into the bedroom and you both can rest for the day.” Tom said looking a little amused that Draco was more than willing to stay in that position all night for Harry. They both walked into the bedroom and got Harry dressed for bed then laid him in the queen sized bed that Tom and Severus brought from home, “Draco, I want you to try and enter the Garden with Harry see if Lily has any ideas on how to deal with Dumbledore and those lions.” Tom said as he kissed his son on the forehead and wished Draco a good night. “Of course, Uncle Tom, I want to help in anyway I can.” Draco said sliding into bed with Harry pulling him close and let his mind drift towards the Garden.
“Mom and Dad, I didn’t expect you guys to be here until this weekend.” Draco said going over to his mom and giving her a hug. “We thought with everything that is about to happen today, we should probably show up sooner rather than later.” Lucius said smiling at his son, then smirking at his god-son “Nice hair there Harry the braid is very nice.” Lucius winked. “Draco helped me do it, I get tired of just putting it in a basic ponytail. That and it also gave him the excuse to play with my hair.” Harry said smiling over at Draco who blushed a little, as he sat down at the table. “So, what did you guys come up with to help with the situation we are dealing with?” Draco said trying to get off the topic of his obsession with Harry’s hair. “On the day of the purge, Lady Hogwarts gave me a very ancient ward that prevents anyone putting tracking spells, port-keys and really bad curses on anyone, not even Dumbledore knows about it.” Severus said looking at his son who had a very shocked look on his face. “Why didn’t I think of that sooner, but wouldn’t that give away our hand?” Harry asked his dad knowing that was what they were trying to avoid. “No, not if you play as if its all part of the blessing Lady Magic gave you when you two bonded.” Severus said smiling at his son who then laughed. “How very Slytherin of you Dad, that would work perfectly with what mom told me I could do to make it so they couldn’t harm anyone anymore.” Harry said seeing the confusion around the room except for Draco’s. “What do you mean Harry, what did Lilly suggest?” Tom asked feeling hope about todays events for the first time. “After Dumbledore tries to kidnap Draco, and if fails I will invoke my right to a fair judgement.” Harry said letting his words sink in knowing the adults in the room would understand at once. “Your mother is still one of the most brilliant witches, I ever got the pleasure of knowing.” Tom said smiling brightly at what Lilly had suggested to Harry. “I agree, that is a brilliant idea and it would work to she would be fair with the punishment for all parties involved.” Severus said also smiling at the fact that his best friend is still helping them even if its from the mind of his son. After all the plans were set, Severus sat next to Draco and started the warding spell which luckily with Lady Hogwarts help it wasn’t to be taxing on Severus’s magic. “You are now the most protected eleven-year old’s in all of the UK.” Severus said smiling at Harry’s shocked look. “Did I forget to mention that if I placed the ward one of a true bonded pair that both of them were protected by that ward?” Severus said smiling knowing he did it on purpose wanting to see the look on Harry’s face. “Lady Hogwarts, also said that if one of us had a port-key placed on us without our consent that it would just transport us to each other is that correct?” Harry asked making sure he had all the plans correct before Draco and he went down to the Great Hall. “Yes, you are correct. Now just to let the events unfold they way they need to unfold.” Tom said looking nervous now for his son, walking over to him and giving him a hug.
Just then, the door opened, and in walked Severus, “Harry, I need you to calm down. Can you please do that for me? I will tell you what you want to know, but you have a panic attack, and that’s not good for your health.” Severus said, having heard what was going on outside in the hall.
So, it had been decided that they would fly to the United States Harry not liking crowded areas only agreed because Lucius had a private plane. “We will arrive in about 45 minutes the hotel is booked in the Disney World resort and we have all day passes to both sides of the park as well as an all-day pass to Universal.” Lucius said amused that Cissa had gotten them all to agree to take Harry away from their world for a little while. It was a good idea because he could tell that the stress was not only getting to Harry but to Draco as well. Once they arrived to their resort the boys were in awe, at how beautiful a fictional castle could look, the boys could have got whiplash with how fast their heads were turn back and forth trying to see everything. Laughing the family finally got to their suite and got ready for the day, when they left London it was ten in the morning and it took them nine hours to get to Florida but because of the Time difference they arrived at noon on July 31st, 1987. “Uncle Lucy, what can we do first today?” Harry asked practically bouncing from excitement, he really did hate that nickname, but he knew Harry has given everyone one, so he smiled. “What do you want to do it is as they say your day.” Lucius said chuckling when Harry looked shocked but then saddened when he saw shame in Harry’s eyes. “Har, why don’t we go to out to lunch at one of the places we saw, when we came in, I’m sure hungry and the plane ride kind of wore me out a bit.” Draco said grabbing Harry’s hand smiling hoping he got that hurt look out of Harry’s face. “Okay Drayk, we can go eat because I agree the plane ride did ware me out a bit, and I am hungry too.” Harry said smiling brightly to Draco, Harry knew that he was the only one right now who could bring a true smile to his face, something inside of Harry seem to want to be happy with Draco.
Gailak walked over to Harry and handed him the test looking at the woman, how dare she try and hurt the young lord in his bank. Once Harry showed the stupid woman his inheritance as well as the Will of his mother, she looked ready to have a heart attack. “You’re a Creature!!! You’re not even fully human how can they let you into Hogwarts!!! This is outrageous!! I don’t believe you!! If this was true, then you wouldn’t be attending the school.” The woman shrieked looking around seeing that even her family was looking ashamed of her performance. Just as she was say all of this Harry’s magic lashed out letting everyone see his true form, Ears, eyes and his long Hair. “I am the king of the light and dark elves you pathetic woman and I will not allow you speak such treachery about my people, or any others is that understood? You will stop this outrageous outburst and either go about your business with the bank or leave I am done speaking and you will leave me and my family alone.” Harry yelled with such authority that the woman’s family bowed their heads in shame, changing back into his human form and walking back to his family while he waited for Gailak to take him to his vault. “This way my young lord, lets get you the money you need for your school things, so you don’t have to be in Diagon Alley any longer than you need to.” Gailak said looking back at the family who just got their goblin to take them to their own vault.
Harry smiled then blushed when is stomach growled “Harry what do you want for breakfast?” Cissa asked looking at Harry with a soft smile. “Can I have porridge toast and some fruit.” Harry asked hoping that wasn’t too much he didn’t want to seem greedy. Cissa looked at Harry understanding that Harry was holding back the mental damage those vile people did caused him to believe he didn’t deserve to eat. “Of course, Harry, you can eat whatever you want we need to start to get some weight on you. Your health is very bad, so we need to get you to a healthy weight so it’s less likely for you to get sick.” She said as she was talking, she smiled when Harry looked shocked. “Dobby.” Cissa called out with a pop a small elf like creature appeared into the room “Yes mistress Cissa, What can dos for you…. Master Harry! Oh, master Harry Dobby as missed you lots.” Dobby squeaked with tears running down his face Harry smiled in excitement and jumped off the bed running to the Elf. “Dobbies, I have missed you too.” Harry said as he cradled the elf both crying and giggling with excitement. “What can Dobby do your Master Harry.” Asked Dobby smiling at his long-lost Master whom he loved so much. “Dobby can you get me some breakfast please, its been a long while since I’ve eaten.” Harry said with tears still in his eyes looking at his first friend as a baby. “Of course, Master Harry anything for you, Dobby wills be rights back don’t goes anywheres.” Dobby said firmly before popping away to get breakfast for Harry giggling Harry got up and walked over to the table that was brought in when he was ready to eat. Seeing the way Harry interacted with Dobby shocked everyone but they were more shocked to hear him giggling. Harry sat down as Dobby returned with Harry’s favorite breakfast Porridge with bananas and cream wheat toast with dragon berry jam, a side of sliced apples and pumpkin juice was set at the table and all Harry could do was smile at the elf for remembering what Harry liked. Harry could only eat about half of the food because of his malnutrition his stomach couldn’t handle a full meal. After he got done eating Cissa gave him his potions and then laid Harry down in the bed to sleep a while. Harry was well enough that they could go ahead and talk with the elves about James and Lily’s wills as well as doing a purge of Harry’s system of any bad spells or blocks and a inheritance test.
It had been three weeks since Harry had been found and he was feeling better than he had in the years he had been alive. In the time he’s been in his new place of living he had met Severus, Cissy, Draco and Lucius there was another person in the house, but Severus wasn’t sure if Harry should meet him just yet incase his memories were bad. Harry understood but he wanted to know why he would have bad memories of a person he hadn’t met yet. Harry kept it to himself until he got frustrated that they hadn’t told him more about the other memories of them that kept coming back each day.
Harry looked around realizing someone must have put him into bed, rather than keep him on the couch. “See you are awake.” Draco said smiling over at Harry’s hair with amusement. “Who moved me last night?” Harry asked Draco rolling his eyes as he tried to get his hair under control it being long it was easier than when he had it short. “Your father, he didn’t think we would be very comfortable on the couch all night the way that we were sitting.” Draco said helping Harry braid his hair into one long braid, it also gave Draco an excuse to play with his hair. “Well I guess we better get dressed and see what my parents have come up with for todays event.” Harry said giving Draco a hug of thanks for the braid. After they got ready, they walked into the living area of the quarter finding not only Tom and Severus but also Draco’s parents.
As everyone started to arrive Blaise and Theo quickly took the seats next to Draco and Harry blocking anyone from getting to them. Ron and Hermione walked into class and sat behind Harry and Draco, talking loudly. “I can’t believe they allow gay people in to this school, let alone teach students, they should be arrested for be disgusting.” Hermione said looking at Harry with such anger. “I agree, with you Hermione, though maybe just recondition, is a better idea because I believe at one point the Headmaster was gay.” Ron said smiling at how uncomfortable the class shifted
“A PRISON! BOY you have it easy here if you think this place is a prison.” Vernon yelled as he through Harry onto the bed in the spare room. “Now get undressed I have need for you and you are going to comply.” Vernon said with a ugly smile.
That bastard was inside of Harry’s mind, showing him what would happen if he didn’t release himself over to him. What Dumbledore didn’t expect was Severus joining the dream, he wasn’t a match for Severus, he never was and stopped what he was doing looking smugly at him. “If you do not give me back Harry what you just saw will happen to your family Severus, can you honestly say that the boy is worth all of that?” Dumbledore asked thinking he had Severus where he wanted him, little did he know that Severus would sacrifice everything for Harry. “You goat, of course Harry is worth it he will always be worth it, I love Harry and nothing you do will ever stop that. I don’t expect you to know what love truly is since you killed the only person who ever loved you.” Severus said with a smirk knowing that would get the goats attention, he looked at Harry who was rocking back and forth. “Harry, this is your mind not his you can kick him out and make this dream into anything you wish it to be don’t this goat destroy everything you have worked so hard to get back.” Severus said as he bent down holding onto Harry, but the words seemed to have done the trick because the next second all you could hear was the ugliest scream of pain and terror. Severus looked at where Dumbledore had been but all that was left was ash, then the scene changed and they were in a field of Lilies, looking around Severus nearly passed out because standing staring at them with nothing but smiles where Lily and James. “We are so proud of you honey, hello Sev thank you so much for helping Harry find his way to this place.” Lily said smiling at the shocked look Severus had on his face, but that’s not why he was shocked how was Lily able to talk to him? “I’m confused, how can you both be here? How am I able to talk with you?” He asked with such shock that he didn’t notice that Harry was laughing, he didn’t get what was going on. “Sev, I performed the ritual in time before Dumbledore killed me.” Lily said knowing that Severus would understand once she said that. “So, it worked both you and James have a piece of your soul inside Harry?” Severus said excited hoping maybe there was away to extract it and bring them back. “Yes, it worked but the price was that we were stuck in here, we can never leave.” She said pointing to Harry’s head with a sad smile, wishing there had been another way but at least she could be there for her son. “Severus, Harry I want you both to get the purge and Harry I want you to get the inheritance test done, but have our wills read at the Ministry first then go to the goblins it has already been care of anyone who wants a purge or inheritance done in fear that Dumbledore did something to them the goblins agreed to do it for free, they have always loved Harry who was friends with the prince of goblins when he was little.” Lily stated making sure Severus understood that Harry has the allegiance of the goblins and would soon find out that he also had the wolves, vampires, and his own kind the Elves allegiance. “Okay, but Lily will you always be here? Will Harry be able to talk with you both if he feels he needs the comfort?” Severus asked concerned that this was a one-time interaction for Harry and didn’t want that for him. “Yes, we will always be here, and Harry is able to bring anyone into his mindscape that wants the chance to speak to us.” Lily said smiling knowing when they found Sirius and Remus that Harry would know they would want to talk to us. “Harry, I think its time that you wake up honey you don’t want to miss your plane.” Lily said wishing she could be there when he wakes up but smiled down at Harry who looked so happy that he could still talk to them whenever he wanted. “Okay mum, I love you both so much and I will be back to talk to you more.” Harry said before waking up, looking around he saw Severus still in shock at what had happened, and all Harry could do was smile.
Harry and Draco walked to his fathers chambers, just as his dad was returning from the Great Hall as well. “Harry, are you okay son?” Severus asked looking concerned for his child. “I’m fine, but can Drayk and I get a quick bite to eat in here? I really don’t want to go back into the lions den.” Harry said with a sign as he slumped down on to the sofa. “Of course, Dobby? Please get Harry and Draco their favorite breakfast please.” Severus said as the young house elf popped in to the chambers. “Oh yes master Severus anything for Harry and young master Draco.” Dobby squeaked as he popped away.
After the dream both man and child hurried to get everything packed, then met everyone at the entrance to the hotel getting into a van that would take them back to their plane. “What took you guys so long.” Tom asked looking concerned at how pale Severus looked he also looked to be in shock. “It’s okay TomTom, Severus just found out the ritual my mom planned to do worked after he found me in a nightmare because of the goat. I was able to finally get rid of him by going into my mindscape and that’s where we saw mum and dad.” Harry laughed at the looks he was getting all of them shocked that Lily pulled it off, then seeing the look in Harry’s eyes all they could do was smile. They all left the hotel and headed to the plane, but everyone was in a better mood knowing that Harry could speak with his parents whenever he needed them.
A bushy haired girl with big teeth walked in, “has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville lost one.” She stated then got super excited gasping she pushed Draco out of the way. “Your Harry Potter! I read about you in the famous witches and wizards of the 19
If for some reason James and I both do not survive then guardianship until 25 are in order, seeing as Harry’s creature inheritance doesn’t mature until then. First Severus Tobias Snape and His husband Tom Marvollo Riddle both of you get a purge and get Harry an inheritance test. Second Lucius Malfoy and his wife Narcissa Black Malfoy, Cissa I know you will look after Harry and I will miss you so very much. Third Sirius Black and his husband Remus Lupin look after him and each other we love you both so much. Under no circumstances is my son to live with my sister and her husband.

After about a week, Cissa took the spell keeping Harry in a coma and played the waiting game for him to wake up on his own. Cissa wrote down Harry’s progress when she heard a moan coming from the bed.
“Oh, thank merlin… I kept praying to either die or get saved. I’m glad it’s the other option.” Harry said, smiling for the first time in what seems like his whole life. Yawning, he laid back down and was out like a light again.
A couple of days later, it was time for the reading of the wills but Harry made it known that Dumbledore was not to be there or he would have the wills read with the goblins, Harry told the Minister this was his one and only chance to show that he could be trusted. Everyone put on their best clothes and robes to enter the Ministry, Harry was nervous because this would be the first time the wizarding world would see him. “Alright, everyone are we ready to go and watch the Minister make a fool of himself?” Lucius said knowing some how Dumbledore would show up saying the wills couldn’t be read with out his legal guardians present, little did Albus know was that Tom and Severus got granted that by Magical Child Services three weeks ago. “Sev, make sure you have the documents stating you are now Harry's guardianship over Harry.” Lucius said but got a look like he was dumb from Severus like he would forget such an important document. They all gathered around and decided to use a portkey rather than the floo network the grabbed onto the book and were teleported into the Ministry. They all started walking towards the court room 12 when who shows his face? None other than the old goat himself, looking smug that he would get his way finally. They all ignored him and walked into the court room, before they could even speak guards were on either side grabbing everyone trying to pull them away from Harry. “THAT IS IT! MINISTER I GAVE YOU A CHANCE! UNHAND MY GUARDIANS THIS INSTANT OR YOU WILL FIND JUST HOW MUCH POWER I HAVE OF THE PEOPLE.” Harry projected his voice which stopped the guards at once looking at the Minister wondering what happened, Harry was glaring at everyone in the room as it started to get cold. “Harry, they aren’t your guardians I am I have the documents to prove it.” Dumbledore said with a smile the brat was his but as soon as he brought the documents out had they been true nothing could destroy them, and Harry snapped his fingers and the documents burst into flames and ash. “I suggest, you old goat think twice before you speak again, or don’t you remember what ashes feel like.” Harry said with such malice that the whole room shivered, how could a seven-year-old have such control and power, looking around he grabbed his family and walked up to the stands of the court room. “I Harry James Potter hold here the true documents of my guardianship in my had, and I demand my parents wills are read I have a rather busy day and don’t want to be in this room longer than I have to.” Harry said glaring at the Minister who swallowed and looked like he was sweating nodding they brought the wills out and started the process.
My last suggestion is to all of you in this room right now listening, if you have ever been in the presence that means drank or eaten anything with Albus Dumbledore being there get yourselves to the goblins everything is in order there you don’t have to pay them, get a purge done as well as an inheritance test you might be surprised. This is just a suggestion you don’t have to do so, this ends my last will and testament so mote it be.
As they walked into Gringotts Griphook walked up to Harry “Harry! How are you? Is it really time for your first year of Hogwarts already?” the goblin asked smiling up at his friend “Grippy! I am doing great, and yes its time for my first year, I need your dad to take me to my vault so I can get money for my things.” Harry said smiling back happy that he got to stay friends with Griphook. Just as he was asking for the goblins father someone shouted out his name. “Harry!? Harry Potter is that really you?” Asked the voice he didn’t recognize Harry turned around to see nothing but red. Molly Weasley and her family had just walked into Gringotts to get the little money they had for the kids school things when she saw a boy speaking to a goblin with such ease, she then recognized the boy and couldn’t have been more excited. Harry not knowing who this woman or the other redheads where backed up slightly to get some distance. “Yes, my name is Harry but its not just Potter.” He said glaring just a little, he really hated when people didn’t use his real name. “Of course, its Potter you’re the boy who lived.” The woman said looking like she knew who he was, not even seeing who he was with. “I am sorry Madam, but my name is Hariad Argulus Severus Potter Riddle Snape so yes its not just Potter.” Harry said glaring more this time after being told he was wrong. “Oh, Harry your just confused your parents would be ashamed of you for changing your name and letting yourself be adopted by these two.” The woman said looking at Severus and Tom like they were the plaque, then had the notion that she could take Harry’s hand and guide him towards the front of Gringotts.
“I think Tom is right. We need to speak to the goblins, see if there is anything they can do to stop the ministry from getting their hands on Harry.” Cissa said, trying to get both men to focus on something else. “It’s going to be a few days until he wakes up, Sev why don’t you start stocking up on the potions. Tom, why don’t you firecall the goblins and set up an appointment with them. Then after dinner, we will rebreak the bones, and we should be all set for a few days.” Cissa said, giving them the direction of things to do for a while.
“I will keep him under for two days, so we will have to do the rebreaking tonight and give him Skele-o-grow as well as all the other potions he will need to be on,” Cissa said, walking over to her little desk to get out a parchment to start writing out the potions. Once she was done, she handed it to Severus.
Just as Harry and his friends walked into the Defense class he was stopped again. “It’s quite rude to leave someone who wasn’t done speaking to you Mr. Potter.” Dumbledore said looking slightly angry. “Again Professor, I am sorry but unless my parents are here, I don’t have to say another word to you.” Harry said starting to get angry at the look that the Old Goat was giving him. “My son is right unless myself or Severus are present you won’t be alone with Harry, Albus sorry it’s what we advised Harry to tell you or any teacher.” Tom said coming up behind Dumbledore.
“Cissa, I wish they would have suffered more, but unfortunately, we had to be quick due to Harry’s injuries,” Severus said, wishing he could have tortured those muggles more for what they did to Harry.
Both men nodded in agreement and headed out to do their tasks, giving Cissa time to process everything that happened to her godson. “You poor child, I know you can’t hear me but know this, we never stopped looking for you after they took you from us. You now have your true family back, and we won’t be letting you go again.” Cissa said, brushing Harry’s hair out of his face.

“I have had enough, I want to know why I remember these things even though I couldn’t have been more than a year old in these memories.” Harry finally said with such angry that the glass that Cissa was holding shattered. Severus held up his hands in surrendered “Okay Harry I will tell you, but I don’t want you to interrupt until I am done okay?” Severus said looking at Harry with a strained look like this was going to be difficult, but Harry didn’t care he was tired of being left in the dark. Harry nodded his head and laid back against his pillow waiting for Severus to begin Harry maybe six, but he was never an average six-year-old he had been through to much in his life already to anything but abnormal.
A couple of weeks later Harry and Draco were sitting at the family table when a ringing noise came from the fire place. “I wonder who, that is calling this early.” Lucius said as we walked over to the mantle a voice spoke “Mr. Malfoy may I please come through I have urgent matters to discuss with you.” The voice was none other than the Minister of magic looking at Harry Lucius pointed for them to hide, not having to be told twice Harry and Draco ran for the quite room as Lucius let the Minister through. “Well hello Minister what can I do…” as soon as the Minister came through so did the one and only Albus Dumbledore. “Well this is a surprise Gentlemen what can I do for you today?” Lucius said put up his mask to hide the distaste of having to look at the man who almost got his godson killed. “I am sorry to have called on you so early, Lucius but I just receive news that the family that was caring for Harry Potter, well sad to say they were found dead and your godson and well as his cousin have been found missing.” The Minister said looking distraught and concerned that Voldemort was behind this. “So, after all your, babble about how Harry would be safer with this family rather than his godparents you lost not only him but is cousin?” Lucius said with malice though he knew Harry and his cousin were safe that didn’t mean he wasn’t still pissed about what happened with Harry. “Lucius be reasonable how could we have known that Voldemort would be able to find Harry? Though why he took his cousin as well is beyond me.” The Minister said as he was saying that Severus and Tom both walked into the dining room.
Shocked at what just happened the Minister knew that vow was unbreakable, and he couldn’t afford Harry’s godfather dying if Harry was found he was sure to lose any respect from the public. “Now Severus you can’t be serious what if Harry is dead then we have lost all hope of defeating Voldemort.” Albus said though he wasn’t worried if Harry died, he could take over with ease. Just as that thought crossed his mind him and the minister were flown into the wall and held there, not know what was going on until a door to right in front of them opened did they understand the ramifications of what was said. Harry stood in the door looking anything but calm his magic was swirling around him like mad and his eyes went from Emerald Green to a solid Purple. “YOU WILL NOT GET ANYTHING FROM ME!! I WILL NOT HELP YOU, I WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE, AND THAT IS WHAT YOU WILL DO! YOU LEFT ME WITH AN ABUSIVE AUNT AND An UNCLE YOU SEXUALLY DID THINGS TO ME THAT MY INNOCENCE IS GONE! WHO EVER KILLED THEM I WOULD SHAKE THEIR HAND BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY DESERVED. MY COUSIN IS KNOWN OF YOUR CONCERN HE IS SAFE AND I WILL KEEP IT THAT WHY IF I WERE YOU. NOW GET OUT AND DO NOT RETURN, AND I MEAN IT LEAVE ME AND MY FAMILY ALONE ALL OF MY FAMILY.” Harry said as he dropped them back to the ground pointed to the fire which lite and called out Ministry of Magic Ministers Office looking at the men and forced them into the fire. Once they were gone Harry collapsed onto the floor.
Harry turned around to look at the person who thought they could cast an unforgivable on him. “I’m a half-elf mind curses don’t work on me, and I do believe I warned both of you to leave me alone.” Harry said finally unleashing his full elf form. “Tell us the truth what have you done to the Harry Potter I read about?” Hermione asked looking slightly frightened at Harry’s appearance. “Maybe, if you stopped believing everything you read you would see what’s right in front of your face.” Harry glared taking a small step towards them. “Why would your mother carry a baby for that ugly bat, she was pretty and brilliant, how did she even know someone like him?” Ron asked sweating as he said those words.
Harry and Draco found a compartment with Blaise Zabini and Theodore Notts. “Draco, Harry how was your summer?” Blaise asked knowing their trip to Diagon Alley hadn’t gone as smooth as the family would have liked. “The summer was great Blaise, Draco and I got to go to the world cup again and then of course the ministry still trying to claim that “Voldemort” was coming back”. Harry said sounding like he could strangle anyone who says the “Dark Lord” was returning. “When are they going to give up on that? I mean the so called “Dark Lord” hasn’t been seen in over 11 years.” Theo said getting annoyed that the ministry kept trying to scare their people. Just then the compartment opened.
“NO! I must get out of here now; please let me go… Wait, what happened to my studder? What have you done to me?” Harry said, sounding angry
After leaving Gringotts and asking Griphook to come over for dinner later, Severus, Lucius and the boys walked over to the robe shop while Tom and Cissa went to get their books and school supplies. Walking into the shop they saw that they weren’t going to be lucky on not seeing that woman again. “More Hogwarts students?” The shop owner said, “Right over on the platform and I will get you measured then you can let me know what you’ll need.” She said again noticing how tense the air got as soon as they walked in. “They both need thick winter, and Spring Cloaks and Robes as well as Dress robes shoes and boots.” Severus said luckily the boys had just gone shopping for regular clothes a couple of days ago, so they were good on everything else. Once they were measured and chose the materials they liked, they paid and had it made out to be owl to them later that night not wanting to be in the store longer than they had too. “Now that is over with all we need is your trunks and both of you need to pick out a familiar and then we can go to Olivanders and get your wand.” Lucius said looking back at the shop pray that was the last they saw of the Weasleys, he could sense that Harry was getting anxious. “Harry? Are you ok? You’ve been quite since Gringotts” Draco said with the bond it was easier to talk this way than try to whisper it. “Yeah, I’m fine Drayk I am just tired of all the drama my name brings.” Harry said looking at Draco with such sadness in his eyes. “Oh, Har I knew this was going to be hard, but I never expected this.” Draco said waving his hand towards the robe shop walking over to harry and hugging him. “As long as I have you with me Drayk I can get through these long days ahead.” Harry said hugging him back smiling. They walked towards the book shop as Tom and Cissa came out holding bags with books, quills, ink, parchment and their potions supplies plus extra. “Everything okay?” Tom said seeing that Harry looked drained hoping nothing went wrong “Yeah, just got done with our robes, now we need our trunks and we can then place all over our things in their while we pick out a familiar.” Harry said perking up when he thought about getting a pet.
It took no time at all to get to the bank and sent to a waiting room for the goblin in charge of the Potter accounts. “Ah, Mister Potter how good to see you again.” Gailak said as he walked in and took his seat a crossed from the young lord, he was pleased to see Harry again he would have to summon Griphook before the young lord left today. “Hello Master Gailak, I wish to full fill my parents wish and get an inheritance test done as well as a purge on myself and everyone in the room.” The young lord said looking nervous but determined, while they had been waiting Sirius and Remus joined them after Siri got new clothes and a shower. “That has been arranged and the ritual room is being set up as we speak, it will only be another few minutes I will come get you when it is time.” Gailak said as he walked to the door to make sure everything was in order. Mean while Sirius was in tears about see Harry again and how much he had grown. “Harry you have gotten so big, well not as big as you should be but bigger than you were.” Sirius said between sobs angry that he had missed all of this for his time in Azkaban. “Siri its going to be ok now, you are here and that’s all the matters.” Harry said as he walked over to Sirius and hugged him and smiled. “Mister Potter they are ready for you, if you will follow me.” Gailak came back into the room happy that Harry had his family back.
Once Tom was sure the boys were asleep, he looked at Severus and dragged him to the fireplace to call Lucius. “Do you think it wise to do this, Lucius will probably want to drag Dumbledore out of the castle after hearing what was said.” Severus said looking at his husband who seemed to already have his mind made up. “This needs to be done Sev, Draco is Lucius’s son and even though he is in our care while he is here this isn’t a matter with school, this is about his life.” Tom said making it known this is how it had to be. “Well let’s try to be slightly gentle about this, we can’t just beat around the bush, but we also can’t be super blunt.” Severus said looking at Tom who looked a little offended but at the same time amused. “Of course, oh sweet and sensitive husband, I will be gentle for the sake of Draco as well as our ears.” Tom said trying to keep the mood light. Tom tossed floo powder into the fire place and said, “Malfoy Manor, London.” Both Severus and Tom walked into the kitchen of the Manor.
“Colouring, Greg? That’s pretty advanced stuff,” said Draco, before he could stop himself. Greg dropped his pencil and cracked his knuckles, looking murderous.
“I’m sorry,” said Hermione again. “I literally can’t. It’s a tongue-tying spell. Like the Mysteries charm.”
Malfoy was still chained to the chair. He tried to get up, could not, and began to writhe, gasping, in what was clearly agony.
“Okay,” said Pansy. Her voice sounded fine. So did his. He could feel her tears where they landed wetly on his scalp.
Draco had been too upset earlier. He had spoken thoughtlessly, carelessly, he might have spoiled everything. But now he was cool. He thought through options. He had just settled on something reasonable and gracious, when he turned to look at Harry.
“I was eighteen! I was working through war trauma! Obviously I wouldn’t bring up his father during sex
“We’ve had a few reports, yes. I seem to remember one from Mr. Malfoy, five or six years ago. Nothing since.”
At Lavender’s birthday party, Draco sat, pale and silent, next to Clarence. Draco wore an expensive silk tie. Harry knew it was expensive, because Clarence several times picked up the end of it and showed it to people, telling them how much it cost. Draco looked the other way when he did this. It made him seem like a prisoner in chains, being paraded through Rome.
He went to Anna’s local park. That was when he caught it: a portkey trace. It was advanced magic. They didn’t teach portkey tracing to aurors yet; the spells were too new. But Harry sensed it when he ran his charms: the portkey magic mixing with Anna’s. It was only too easy to locate where it had gone and apparate there.
Draco started talking more about everything, after Harry called him by his real name. He talked about his university classes (“as far as I can tell, all women in the Middle Ages were completely mad. Have you ever read Margery Kempe?”), about his work outs (“This is going to sound like I’m showing off, but I’m telling you, when you’re this in shape you have to conceive of increasingly ridiculous ways to
“How eloquent,” said Harry. “When we get home, you’re going to spend twenty minutes in your room by yourself.”
Harry had him wait outside the Police Station as he blagged his way in, using more spells than was technically legal. It was similar enough to the Auror department that he was able to find the files without too much difficulty. He located Sam Barker’s file, looked at the picture, checked the age. It matched up with everything Adelaide’s friends had said.
“I’m not brave,” said Draco, moving his head back to look Harry in the face. His eyeliner was smudged, and his expression was confused, rather helpless.
Harry pulled him inside by the lapels, shut the door behind him, pressed Malfoy up against the wood, and kissed him. Malfoy was stiff for an instant, then kissed back just as hungrily, as if he, too, hadn’t been able to think of anything else all week.
“Yes,” said Draco. “But I agree with Harry. It’s nonsense, and people only believe in it because they’re ignorant and insecure.”
Draco glanced at him. Harry looked so real, standing in the snow next to Hermione’s ridiculous sleigh.
“Yeah, just waiting for my ship to come in.” He frowned, then straightened up. “Listen, time’s up. Seriously, you did the right thing, breaking up with Jill. I can’t tell you how many of my clients are in relationships that make them unhappy; it’s really great to see someone actually act on it. You should be proud of yourself.”
“Yes, that’ll happen when you touch the Bird’s Prey keychain, like a twat,” said Harry. “Take him to St Mungo’s.”
Once, Draco thought he saw a bruise on Adelaide’s wrist, but she pulled down her sleeve and climbed into Tertius’ lap and it had probably just been the lighting.
“And then he was a dick to you because he thought you didn’t mean it, and it hurt his feelings!” said Ginny.
“I have to go,” said Draco. Seven helped him stand. “I may not see you again.” He bowed his head. “This is hard. I didn’t expect it all to be so hard.”
“No, just—I mean, always. You weren’t hurting me,” said Draco. He had felt, while Potter observed his hand, that he was on the verge of passing some sort of judgment, and Draco wanted badly to know the verdict. But Potter did not touch him again. He still had that confused-or-scornful expression.
But Harry completely forgot to get Draco after his Defence Against the Dark Arts class, and it was only twenty minutes later, when Hermione asked “Where’s Draco?” that he remembered. It had felt so normal to be in class with the Gryffindors, so pleasantly comfortable, that he had gone to the library with Hermione just as he usually would have, without thinking.
“What happened?” Padma asked Parvati, who came over to where Harry was putting away his textbooks very slowly so that he could hear what Parvati had to say.
I review books on instagram at @let_them_eat_books if you're interested in that! Thank you for reading, everyone! Your comments were so lovely and encouraging.
“Fine,” he said. “We’re going to my local coffee shop. Around the corner from here. I’m not going anywhere near…your part of town.”
“Harry told us about the way you sometimes ‘get lost in your own head.’ Could you describe what he means by that?”
“I read somewhere that that’s how cats say ‘I love you’,” said Draco, then did it again. And Harry did it back, which made Draco smile.
The first thing Harry noticed was that Hermione stood next to the Chief: she was code name Badger. He suddenly could remember seeing her around, recognising her for a milli-second at a time, and then losing the memory.
“Zoe and I practiced. We watched this film where the heroine sneezed all cutely and we were determined to learn how.”
With Harry, he started prolonging the sex. He didn’t laugh as much. He was distracted when Harry asked him personal questions.
“Only the best mystery series that’s ever been written,” said Malfoy. “Thrilling adventure. Daring misdeeds. Reluctant heroes— you’ll like that, I imagine. All set in the world of the International Quidditch League. You
do it.” Harry stared at Draco, whose head had drooped so that it rested on the edge of the fireplace. He thought of the resigned way Draco had answered him at the breakfast table, of the look of heartbreak in his eyes when Ginny said she was disappointed in him, of his refusal to answer a simple question, choosing to be tortured instead. It didn’t add up.
“When was the last time you were alone for two hours?” he asked Draco. They were in the supermarket. Draco would never go by himself. If Harry was busy, he enlisted someone else.
It was just a series of memories in which Draco had looked down from some great height. The astronomy tower, with Dumbledore; escaping the Fiendfire, looking down from the manor roof, the drop from the alcove window to the Cloisters…
“I know it’s soon,” he said. He was down on one knee on the ice skating rink on the Eiffel Tower. They had just eaten at the Jules Verne again, because Draco had once mentioned it was his favourite.
Draco nodded curtly and turned away, then turned back, looking as if he were doing it despite himself.
“Yes. It is,” said Hermione. They were at their local pub, a muggle one where they were never disturbed.
His auror partner was a woman named Bianca Rosenthal. She stared at Harry when he asked her about patrol shifts.
“Cool,” said Harry, biting his lip and smiling with his whole face. That was how he smiled, with every muscle. Draco felt slightly dazed.
“He’s all right, actually,” he said, when Harry asked him about it. “Mental ideas about quidditch, but yeah, he’s okay.”
Harry ran his hand through his hair. He had just remembered that this was Malfoy’s last night with Scorpius, and the thought saddened him for a variety of reasons.
make the argument that the intended invitee is the one for whom the gala is a meaningful war memorial, not a coveted chance to see-and-be-seen,” said Draco.
“A chauvinistic pig,” said Ellie. She had retrieved a plastic box of grapes from the fridge and was picking through to find the good ones.
Harry felt as if his thoughts were trudging through thick mud. Horror and guilt clung to him as he tried to find words.
… and then Draco becoming cold and morbid as he came back to himself… it had all served to highlight the impossibility of Harry’s crush. He had liked Draco leaning on him. A lot. Too much. He couldn’t trust himself not to be weird about it. And he was uncomfortably aware that Draco felt he owed Harry something. The idea that he might feel
“What’s the plan, saviour? Did your psychic scar get wind of a cat stuck up a tree?” he asked, once they were outside. Potter was walking them to the quidditch pitch.
“Cassie’s scared that you’re ashamed of her,” he said. “I’ve always tried to convince her you’re not, but until recently the facts weren’t exactly on my side.”
The wasp sting picture arrived on Harry’s phone seconds later, a miserable, swollen-faced Draco staring off into the distance.
“Well, this Malfoy you're referring to can't have been at a ministry gala in 1999. The only Malfoys I’m aware of are hospitalised, dead, or disgraced. You’ll admit, I’m sure, that none of those states are conducive to receiving invitations to political functions.”
Was this what it had felt like when he ordered Draco through the bond, he wondered? Harry couldn’t move an inch, because he had to do what Draco told him. He had to, because Draco was reaching forward to touch him, and if Harry moved at all, he might stop, and Harry would implode.
to apologise, almost like taking advantage, and he was selfish, so deeply, innately, genetically selfish…
Harry left them to it for twenty minutes. When he finally went to the kitchen, Draco was speaking in a low, earnest voice, and Timothy was nodding, his eyes on the floor, his arms crossed. Draco had one hand on Timothy’s shoulder.
But when Draco came on the screen, it was immediately apparent that none of that was going to happen.
Ginny started sitting with them more often, after that. She was impatient with Draco’s silences and prodded him with a pencil whenever he thought too hard.
“Sorry,” said Harry. “For not being him, or whatever.” When Seamus didn’t respond, or even move, Harry spoke again. “I get it. It’s lonely sleeping with someone when you’re in love with someone else.”
The first picture was in a silver frame, and it was clearly their wedding day. Harry was staring at Draco as if he couldn’t believe his luck, as if he was slightly dazed, still. It was the winning-the-quidditch-cup expression, times a hundred. Draco, meanwhile, was looking in another direction, smiling so hard he looked almost deranged, showing far too many teeth. It actually made him look much less handsome, because his eyes were crinkled shut and his face had creased practically in half to accommodate his enormous grin. Yet that was the one they had chosen to frame, despite the fact that Harry knew there were other, more flattering photographs of their wedding day— he had spotted one once at the Burrow, before Mrs. Weasley had hastened to put it away.
“I see. Well, since you’re planning on staying, would you mind not taking up three quarters of the bed? I am the invalid here, you know.”
“You look beautiful,” said Astoria, moving a curl on Mirth’s head with a reverence that Draco was quite certain she would never feel about him.
“Oh, that reminds me, they were in Witch Weekly,” said Hermione, pulling out a copy from the pile of magazines on the coffee table and flicking through it. “Here.” She handed it to Harry and Ron.
“You’re going to be just fine. None of that stuff that happened to you, none of it can stop you.” He swallowed. “It wasn’t your fault, and that’s a pretty good position to be in. Innocence.”
“I know!” Dean leant back on the garden bench, breathing heavily. “I know.” He looked at Harry. “Three years sober?”
“Cuddling without me, boys?” said Draco, sliding between them on the bench and giving Neville a quick peck on the mouth.
“My God, Potter,” said Malfoy, and then left it at that, as if he couldn’t bring himself to explain the depths of Harry’s depravity.
Draco closed his mouth. Steven looked intensely rattled. He ran his hands through his hair, took several deep breaths, then smiled.
“I wasn’t trying to shame you,” said Harry. “I was extremely confused, but I wasn’t messing you around. I promise.”
“—I think most people in our era and context would agree that, generally speaking, it’s worse to lock up a teenage girl for a year than to sleep with someone else’s boyfriend.”
“Mmnnghh,” said Draco. Adelaide’s features relaxed into her usual sneer. She sat back on her haunches.
So he just nodded, and they moved on to other, less fraught subjects, and Harry resolved never to mention Malfoy again.
Which Harry gladly did. With a strange lack of surprise, he realised he was glad to do almost anything for Draco, these days.
When they got to Malfoy’s flat, he fumbled through Malfoy’s pockets for his keys and dragged him inside.
“No, no,” said Harry, making himself comfortable against his pillows. “What’s going on? Are you okay?”
It never worked on him when Adelaide told him to chill, and certainly didn’t work on Potter. His wand was suddenly in Draco’s face.
Draco started walking again. Potter had already apologised for nearly killing him. Sort of. At the time, when it happened. Draco didn’t expect, or need, another apology.
“Okay,” said Harry, as though talking to a spooked horse. “Okay. I think I have some in my study. Wait here.”
“I’m going to go paint,” she said. She climbed over Harry and was out of the room before either of them could say anything.
