This chapter is kind of a mess but that was mostly intentional. Thoughts are messy. the mind is messy. teenagers are messy. unreliable narrators are messy. apologies minus apologies!
“Impertinent brat.” She sassed back and breathed a sigh of relief when Harry leaned back, snuggling into her with an unrepentant grin.
The unfamiliar nature of sharing a bed was mildly discombobulating to Luna. Not that she couldn’t share or did not want to, just that she was very aware of how vulnerable her position was. She was struggling to accept this since she had strived so hard to avoid being subject to her Ravenclaw roommates whims. It was easier and safer to stay apart from the rest of her peers. They refused to accept or understand her and she was not going to make them. So avoidance was the key to thwarting the repercussions of her differences.
“We have got to work on your expectations, Potter. If you think that was smooth.”
Fred, silent and grim, picked Harry up off the ground while George tossed the cloak to Draco. In a move that surprise all of them but one, Draco laid a hard quick kiss to Harry’s open mouth. The whole room was stunned into silence.
“Indeed Miss. Granger.” Narcissa said kindly. “Now,” she pulled Harry into another quick hug before setting him on his own. “We must not linger. Harry, take this. Have everyone ready in the morning. The portkey will activate at 7 a.m. and will bring you directly outside the Manor.”
“Oh! Harry!” Hermione turned to the newcomer ignoring the rest of the boys and forgetting for a moment that her very dear friend was injured. She sprinted to him for a hug only to come up short by the broad (when had that happened? Draco was skinny, right?) chest of Harry’s new self-appointed bodyguard. “Ooomph.” Hermione bounced off Draco and would have fallen on her bum if one of the twins had not caught her.
” He continued as he unbuttoned Harry’s oversized trousers, yanking the pants down with gentle force until both boys stood in their underthings. Harry had stopped resisting, suddenly finding the Herringbone inlay fascinating while trying to make himself small.
“And what day did we do the thing with the toads in Charms?” He asked absentmindedly, fiddling with his fork, and refusing to look up.
“How very Slytherin of you.” Draco interrupted. “We do not have time for this sentimentality.”
“It’s clear.” Luna whispered as she shouldered Harry’s weight. He tried to shrug her off, to lead her to the Room of Requirement. Luna would have none of it showing a rare sign of impatience when she firmly draped his arm over her shoulders. “Sometimes, its ok to let someone else carry the burden.” Luna’s voice strong and full of authority. She sounded entirely too much like Hermione. Harry said as much. “She is the
“Finally!” cried out Fred.
Near dawn, Draco quit his pacing. A calm settled over his turbulent thoughts momentarily. The day had started. "A new beginning" as his mother had said every day during the summer. He liked this philosophy. Each day starting over.
“And you cannot trade out?” he asked, at this point, a little desperate.
“You cannot blame yourself, Granger.” Draco told her in a way that brook no argument. “You may be bright,” he admitted, “but you are not omniscient. Plus, Harry is by far the most reticent Gryffindor to exist.”
“You will have the Malfoy name behind you.” Draco promised so sincerely. Pansy flipped her hair and lifted her unconventionally cute nose in the air to hide her watering eyes and skepticism. Draco forged on, “Think of it this way… if you are disinherited, you won’t have to marry Goyle.”
The three barely dared to breathe during their stealthy walk up to the seventh floor. An eternity passed until finally, they found Barnabus and his dancing trolls. Hermione nearly wept with relief once they were inside the Room of Requirement.
Fred and George were both in agreement with Draco.
boy with the pretty violet eyes. Blaise noticed her looking and nodded to Pansy. She nodded back just as calm as she could manage.
I typed this chapter to the song "Happy if you are happy" which was a weird mood. Hope you like!
“Hurry.” Hermione was told. This time she was quicker on her feet. She grabbed her bag and the quill before being shrouded by Harry’s fabulously invisible cloak. It was cramped beneath the fabric with two overgrown Weasleys and one Granger but, they made do. Hermione did her best not to panic when one had his hand on her hip and the other’s back was smushing her nose. This was nothing like her previous trips beneath the cloak. Harry was always conscious of personal space and Ron instinctively copied him. The twins had no such manners.
Spoils of War:
to believe Draco Malfoy.
“Ok.” Harry said meekly. “I know. You’re right. What do I have to do?”
Harry could do nothing but obey her even as the very thought of food churned his belly like one of the Weasley’s Puking Pastilles. Harry politely nibbled on a piece of cheese, snatching it from under the hot glare of Draco. Mouselike, quick and cautious in his movements.
“Silly boy.” She teased. “I was in the library.”
“You are taking too many chances!” Draco Malfoy, disheveled, red-faced, and slightly sweaty, was standing at his fullest height in front of the fireplace. The Room of Requirement had given them little. The blazing fire to protect against the winter chill emanating from the grey castle stone. The portrait of the ethereal girl, whom, stood guard to the tunnel to Hogsmead. A threadbare rug centered invitingly before the fire. There was no furniture. No training equipment. No mirror or pictures of the original Order of the Phoenix. The Room was empty, a place to wait. A safe place to hide. Exactly what they needed. And nothing more.
Harry enjoys his dinner then is confronted by Ron
Severus did not regret his insult. A despondent teary-eyed waif was proving to be more than Severus could handle. He’d rather feel the flame of hatred in those verdant eyes than witness the defeated desolation and despair he had walked into. Plus, riling up Narcissa was a perk all by itself. Severus had never appreciated her form more than when she was standing guard with indignation coloring her cheeks and a loose tendril of blonde hair waving in the wind of her barely restrained power.
He wasn’t sleepy and he wasn’t hungry having never eaten so much in his life, and consuming the heavy Nutrient Potions faithfully to appease both Malfoys and the absent Professor Snape, his stomach felt uncomfortably bloated again for a whole hour after lunch. He tried to read but his eyes hurt too much to continue. And he missed Draco. Harry tried to wait. To be patient. To be good and stay in bed.
“Will dissolve.” Draco said firmly. “You will no longer be a Parkinson.” He half whispered her greatest desire. “Please, Pansy, I need you.”
In the Library, Narcissa sipped her tea watching Hermione Granger speak eloquently and with animated hands to Draco. Her frowning son was not upset as far as Narcissa could tell. Rather, he seemed intent on concentrating on whatever Miss Granger was explaining. The two, once school rivalries were rendered moot, had found common ground. Their interest in politics were dangerously similar to one another and the discussions had ranged from seriously somber to outright shouting matches as both students were intelligent and stubborn, neither one wanting to admit the other was right. Narcissa suppressed a shudder. Politics, Policies and Negotiations were not her forte. Too esoteric for her tastes.
“Uh…” Harry snatched his hand off the table casting furtive glances to the head table to see if Umbridge had joined the other professors. Only Snape and a bleary-eyed Trelawney worshipping a steaming cup of coffee sat at the table. Both clearly wishing they were elsewhere.
“Who says I like him now.” Snape’s black eyebrows were raised to his widow’s peak just as a smirk fluttered at his lips. Draco countered with a full blown smile, knowing full well everything had changed yesterday. “Fine.” Snape sighed dramatically. “He isn’t entirely insufferable.” Snape acknowledged. “You did seem pretty cozy with the brat at dinner.”
During her confinement, heavily pregnant with many difficulties, Narcissa had know very little of Lucius’s proclivities and inclinations. Her midwife had kept a tight lid on anything outside of the nursery during the difficult pregnancy. It was after, with Draco only weeks old, Narcissa had learned of the terrible plans set into place regarding Harry Potter and his parents. Distraught, Narcissa began planning to leave. Then, on a rain fill colicky night, Lucius had made his promise to protect their son. To keep him safe, to keep him alive. Narcissa made the promise binding, and they held hands as the sun rose on the peaceful chest of young Draco.
“And she won’t.”
Draco caught up quickly, lengthening his stride to catch up. Harry’s pulse quickened as the other boy approached from behind. Instead of outpacing him, Draco stayed by his side all the way to the Great Hall.
&&&&&
Thank you to everyone who has kudoed or commented. As I live and breathe, they sustain me in this mad world.
“Are you ready?” Draco asked brusquely. The tall dark boy sitting at their desk looked startled for a moment after their door opened on its own. The look was quickly hid behind a blank handsome facade. Draco wasted no time revealing himself. He investigated his side of the room and was please to find Blaise had taken care of packing all his belongings.
A brush of fabric, a shimmering of air, and there stood two identical saviors. “Duck Dovey,” one of them said while the other yelled:
“I can do it.” Harry groused at him, reaching up for the potion. Hermione made an unusual squeaking sound, grabbing Harry’s attention. He squinted at her as he swallowed the cool liquid. Harry was not sure what was going through her brain. He was not sure he even wanted to know. Her cheeks were as red as he had ever seen them, and she was refusing to make eye contact.
his new body and mind of the self-inflicted insanity causing Voldemort to remember what it meant to be the Dark Lord full of purpose instead of madness. To be Tom Riddle when he was bursting with ideals for a better and safer future. Of implementation which he failed. Spectacularly.
“Tell us, ickle Harrikins, did our dear brother have anything to do with your new apparel?” George questioned with bright yet narrowed hazel eyes as he pointedly examined the bandaged hand from across the table. His smile was suspiciously close to a sneer and his voice was absolutely foreign to anyone who had known the Weasley Twins for long.
Snape had never given the boy any reason to
“Of course not.” George snorted while Fred agreed with a full mouth. Hermione harrumphed, crossing her arms. She was completely fed up with their lack of manners. This time Harry grinned at her until she relaxed into a laugh when George unrepentantly stole a blueberry off her plate.
The other teenagers made their introductions to the Lady of the House while Draco got his bearings. Harry was still in his grasp and again, the Slytherin was loath to let him go.
either. Not even when Pansy had hovered after dinner on the second day, telling him (read: ordering) to get better so Draco would stop being “such a pain in the ass worry wart” and Blaise, who had waited for her at the door was nodding his head in emphatic agreement.
“Yes.” Hermione answered through clenched teeth. “And your sanity.”
“I see, I see.” She nodded solemnly, “I’m afraid I cannot let you in, Handsome.”
he could not fend off an attack. Not at the moment. Not physically or magically. He was weak. Like a child. Like a
. Like I need any more problems.”
“Mr. Malfoy.” Snape drawled his usual droll greeting. “To what do I owe this pleasure?” he sneered, “At 6 in the morning?”
Narcissa Black Malfoy wrapped her fur lined cloak tighter about her slim body. She suppressed the shivers threatening to wrack her calm patience. Already her fingertips were numb, despite the thickness of the pearl white leather gloves and the multitude of warming charms. Her nerves, spurred on by worry and spontaneity, were colder than the icicles dangling in the bitter Highland cold. My, how she hated waiting. Fortunately, it was not long before she heard the shuffling of frozen feet in snow, the crunch of the crystalized top layer and the loudly chattering teeth.
“Yeah Ron, I have not idea what’s that is like.” Harry snarked. “You only just kick me out when I’m having a nightmare. And then you treat me like a crazy person for being upset.”
“You’ll get tired of me.” Harry said, small and sure.
The Slytherin caught him with ease, taking his time to make sure Harry was steady on his feet. “You’re up.” Draco said with a pleased little smile. “Take this.” He brought the blue vial to Harry’s vision. “Snape said only half this time.” He warned. Draco looked upset. “I would’ve gotten it to you sooner…”
“I got out of my father’s shadow.” Draco confessed without explaining anything. His reluctance was clear.
They only walked a few more feet before Hermione began to second guess the situation. “Harry, wait. This is ridiculous. I can’t just leave the school in the middle of the night.” She refused to move forward when he tugged on her hand impatiently.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Draco.” Narcissa said with an air of nonchalance to dispel any notion that she was suddenly absolutely furious. “Would you give us the room?”
“Draco did not come to me with any allegations, Lucius.” She was hastily losing her patience with her husband and his mercurial moods. “It was Severus who spoke of your little conversation. He stumbled upon it during an occlumency lesson. I believe you set those up without consulting me.”
The end of the sixth part. The seventh part will take a while to get out but forewarning… there will be smut.
“It’s not consistent.” Harry explained with that same urge that pushed him all evening. Hermione would want to know. Hermione would understand. “I think it has something to do with if I
“You have plenty of time to tell me all about it while we get the manner ready. Hold on tight.” Narcissa once again lifted her arm to make room for the younger woman to step into. Hermione obediently let Lady Malfoy wrap an arm around her waist. Then, with a crack, they were gone from the empty streets of a frozen midnight Hogsmead.
And this boy had defeated him with just a touch, sending him out into the world wraithlike once more. Voldemort had to question… was it worth it? Did he really want to spend years of his life in rage and despair and desperation with no support or followers and no influence besides a legacy of pain and fear and oppression. Where he could watch as they
she contemplated silently. “Come in.” Narcissa instructed, giving them both a pleased smile when they complied.
she reasoned. Hermione squared her shoulders. Running away was not an option. It was just detention. Her first in many years. Dolores Umbridge had no reason to punish her in the same manner as Harry. Hermione was an excellent student. She did not cause a ruckus in class. Her exemplary record was her shield. Her determination did not last long.
“Very well,” Snape acknowledged, letting the younger man into his sitting room. “Sit down. I’ll be a few moments.”
Severus Snape arrived just after sunset on the crisp cold winter day. The Floo Receiving Room of Malfoy Manor was empty and chilled without a fire. A lone light flickered from the sconce on the wall by the door leading into the hallway. Severus wasted no time shivering in the chill. His body barely acknowledged the lack of warm having become accustomed to a lower temperature while brewing. He did, however, shudder with unease leaving the children unguarded and unchaperoned in the halls of Hogwarts. They were perfectly safe for the moment, with Umbridge distracted by her search. Instead of dwelling on the impossible act of being two places at once, Severus went in search of Narcissa. He found her in the first place he looked. Unfortunately, she was not alone.
how uncomfortable it made Harry. Who had only ever known abuse and neglect.
“Wha’ for?” Ron demanded to know as he was cradling his stinging cheek.
“You look rested.” Narcissa said, hiding her smile behind her teacup when he whipped his dark head around in surprise.
“I’d rather you did not.” Draco said quietly and heartfelt. For the first time Harry saw him humbled. It was a powerful thing to witness. Beautiful. The proud ponce Malfoy turned sincere and… kind to him. Harry swayed with the heady feeling.
The Dark Lord, formally known as Voldemort, was going to make a comeback as Tom Riddle. No matter how much he hated carrying his father’s name, it would serve him now and that was all that matter if he was going to thrive. That is to say: after he acquired his missing pieces. The loss of the one was manageable. Potter’s blood had healed most of the damage. The return of his remaining soul pieces would make him better, stronger, less vulnerable. He would find another way to defeat death.
No matter how wonderful it was to laze away the evening in the warm dark womb of Draco’s room, it was not to be. A house elf appeared with their signature pop, rousing the two boys from their cuddling.
Narcissa put her musings aside once the two witches reached the West Library. Inside, a fire had already been lit with a little table laden with tea and biscuits. Minsy was always quick and competent. Ms. Granger eyed the tea service speculatively while removing her school cloak. Narcissa showed her where to hang it near the fire to hasten drying. Lady Malfoy added her own cloak to the second hook.
"Now now Drakey-poo, come out of the closet."
I suppose I could ask McGonagall for another room, but I didn't really feel like whining unnecessarily to her, especially since she already had a lot on her plate trying to restart Hogwarts after all that has happened. I considered charming another room for three people, but then I remembered that most people were coupling up, and I internally grimaced at the thought of having to either endure the sexual tension, or trying to sleep while they shag. I sighed in resignation as I realised that my best option was just staying with Malfoy.
“Ew. Gross.”
“Still doesn’t tell me who you are.”
“Well that’s not fair, isn’t it? We’ve been kissing for a while now, and that’s fine, but I can get that anywhere.” Theo said, holding Blaise’s face in one hand. Blaise laughed lightly.
"No F-Father."
They both started yelling at each other, Narcissa obviously winning the argument. Octavia tugged at Draco's sleeve.
She found this old blue cloak she kept at the bottom of her trunk and turned it inside out so the inner black velvet was showing. The hood was always a bit long on her, so she’d use it to her horror advantage.
glad I managed to not humiliate myself. Even with your best efforts Blaise!” The group got up and began walking to the dungeons.
Draco Malfoy.
“A thing we have in common then.” It was her turn to eye him.
“Here we go.” He muttered before clearing his throat. “WAKE UP YOU SPECCY GIT!” He yelled into Potter’s face and smirked as the boy jolted awake with shock.
"He looks really grumpy." Granger says, looking at another poster.
As for my Big Blue House: I am focusing all of my energy into Double Trouble because it’s what I’m feeling more, but as soon as I am done with the first book of that, I will be rewriting a Big Blue House to be better because I think it could improve.
“A girl’s involvement? Interesting...” Octavia said, much to further Draco’s chagrin.
“But-but-but that’s not fair! H-he made you do it! He made you draw the mark! W-weren’t there w-witnesses?”
On the sofa, Luna looked like she was nearly done with a red beanie, slightly less deformed than mine. And Malfoy...I think he was asleep on Luna's shoulder, with Virgo hissing quietly on the top of his head. I went to sit next to the sleeping boy, and ever so carefully removed Virgo's coiled state from atop his head. She focused her unblinking beady eyes on me and curled up my hand to my forearm, where she rested like her owner. I looked over to Malfoy and Luna, and saw that Luna was struggling to lift her arm to knit because of his sleeping form leaning on top of her.
“Aww, poor baby!” Pansy held him to her tightly and stroked his hair lightly. He smiled a bit and let her do so for another thirty seconds before he struggled.
Draco looked up to the sky above and his stomach dropped. He heard Octavia mutter behind him "shit," but he didn't tell her off for language this time.
“That’s you.” He told him and Potter scowled.
“I feel sick.”
At the entrance he looked across at Potter.
There was an awkward silence after Malfoy had finished explaining his non law abiding scheme to Hermione. We were all staring at him with a mixture of wonder, confusion, and fear. He finally noticed our expressions and shrugged.
“I ain’t afraid of no ghosts!” One third year from the back added, causing the group to giggle. Draco raised an eyebrow confusedly.
“You do realise what that book is about, right?” He prods.
She went in a boat with three others, two boys and a girl. There was a muggleborn boy called Danny Keett, and a pair of half blood twins, Martha Robinson and Felix Robinson.  She ignored them for the most part, and kept up a standoffish front. She could make friends later, once her house was sorted.
“I just told you, they’re incomplete.” He defended while placing both of his hands over the box.
“I-I’m sorry Auntie, I didn’t mean it-“
I sat up with a scream caught in my throat and my heart beating wildly, my breath escaping me and I couldn't breath and everything was blurry so I couldn't see and I'm useless I can't even see or breath properly I let them all down they're better off without me I shouldn't be here but I am and I'm suffocating on my bed while Malfoy's talking to me but I can't do anything right-wait Malfoy?
Draco shrugged. "I'm more interested in being a spectator than anything. Don't have a great urge to be entered into a death tournament. Besides, what would you do if I was gone?" He pinched Octavia's cheek, causing her to scratch at him like a cat.
“I thought you were at least twenty or something,” Draco smiled slightly, “or that you just looked young for your age,” his smile dropped. “How did you perform such strong wandless magic? What kind of training does she have you under?” He neared the shield slightly and Draco leaned away a bit.
“Mmkay.” Draco tightened his arms and relaxed as Blaise’s arms relaxed round him as well.
Potter started shifting again and
He continued to stare at the door. Then at the list. Then back to door. He had a small talk with a portrait that rested on the wall above the stairs he sat on, but then his gaze went back to that door.
“It’s probably just because he’s your favourite celebrity and you don’t like Granger.” She shrugs the situation off. “You probably came off as really mature and cool to leave them be. Like a great friend to Krum.” She tried to make him feel better.
Blaise is good at advice sometimes. But he’s also a gross flirt. It depends on the weather.
“I am tired. Too tired. Drakeyyyy...”
“Snrk, your hair-“ then he began laughing.
Aunt Bella then walked over to Draco and held his face while cooing.
"I needed to get Via out of there. She doesn't deserve to get interrogated by Aurors, she's twelve."
“It won’t hurt to ask. If anything, she’s probably curious about Bulgaria.” Draco got to his feet. “I should probably head back to the dorms anyway. To check the older years haven’t died of alcohol poisoning. Might be grim.” He made up an excuse with a smile. He nodded supportively. “Go and ask her.”
Potter pretended to think for a moment. “Well you could convince the entire school that I’m not trying to be the Hogwarts champion and don’t want to be in the spotlight.” Potter offers sarcastically. “Maybe even convince Beauxbatons and Durmstrang while you’re at it.”
"Uh...bye?"  He closed the door behind him.
Pansy continued to talk to the closet until I stepped in.
" - Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves?  He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost - I say, what are you all doing here?" A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had noticed the first years. Draco looked up at him with a gasp.
"That isn't a high bar we're setting."
"The stupid looking one is Weasley, the nosy looking one is Granger, and the Harry Potter looking one is Potter. And we are leaving." He took her hand and tried to drag her away but she resisted.
“Goodbye Krum.” Draco bid him goodbye.
"Really Potter? Not even going to properly put your new clothes away? Or change clothes?" Malfoy started whining. I made an incomprehensible noise into my pillow, which roughly meant in my head "fuck off". He sighed and I could hear some mutterings of what sounded like, "Vestitulo, Vestitulo, Vestitulo," and I could hear my drawers opening and closing.
“I hadn’t really seen what that was. I just thought it was something embarrassing. I thought that’s why Malfoy reacted the way he did.” He admitted. Octavia sighed.
"How dare you! My Mother is not a loony and she is not an alcoholic! She is perfectly fine and is the greatest person in the world! Maybe the reason she doesn't go outside a lot is because she'll end up meeting awful people like you!" He yelled at Ron furiously.
Snape's eyebrows rose. "You must have not crushed the snake fangs enough," he said without a hint of remorse. "10 points from Hufflepuff." Michael's eyes widened in shock at his Professor's ruthlessness. Draco saw Michael think.
“Yes, but the thing about that is at least I was transfigured back, but no, you will always be a filthy little rodent from a family of the same. Disgusting little-“
"Could I have one scoop of chocolate please? I'll see you in ten minutes, meet me outside the robe shop." He directed her, giving a quick kiss to her cheek. He felt like a parent but that was fine. It made him feel responsible.
She saw Blaise soon enough. Not under preferred circumstances though.
This kid was the bloody worst.
He had been kidnapped.
“I’m going to go down to the common room. Everyone’s
“I’ll keep that in mind.”
After the introductory Herbology lesson, it was time for Charms. The Herbology lesson had only been focused on the greenhouse rules and what they'd be studying that year. Draco had never been the most fond of Herbology, but that was only because his tutor had been a harsh man who took the fun out of everything. Draco had hated him, especially since he'd tried flirting with Narcissa on more than one occasion. To no avail, thank goodness.
"Well then, now that I hope you've made it to a more private area, let's talk Draco," Lucius' controlled voice echoed around the room. "I got the oddest letter from that disgusting half-breed 'Professor' Flitwick. Do you know what it said Draco?" Draco clenched his fists and kept his head down. The letter floated above him, talking down to him. "It said that you displayed a great show of magic. That you lifted a desk with 'Wingardium Leviosa' on the first try, instead of a feather. It said that the half-breed would like to personally tutor you in charms. To use your 'potential'. But you know what the most horrific thing that goblin told me?"
“Well, um, thank you. You look older as well.” Draco smiled up at the star quidditch player with well hidden glee. Viktor smiled back.
“Did he get you?” The crazy man asked Potter.
"See you tomorrow Via!" They all called to her, before going in the direction of their dormitories. She followed one of the other first years to where she'd be sleeping.
“You? Aleksander, you can barely throw a curse!” Viktor told him and Aleksander smirked.
“But thats not fair!”
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
“No no no, it is not that, I just thought it’d be nice to have a pet, like a normal child-“ that was the wrong thing to say, that was the wrong thing to say-
"Oh do shut up."
"My heart!" Michael sank onto his knees dramatically in front of the door, clutching his chest.
"Ha! I wish I could do that with one look! I'm glad you think I'm persuasive though, that's how I'll become Prime Minister," she laughed.
“What time is it?” He asked the group.
"Gah! Stop it!" She yelled at them, not being able to swat them away as her hands were full.
“Who are you being nice to?” Pansy asked groggily from right next to him.
“What the fresh fuck is wrong with you?!” Sirius roared, causing Draco to clutch Cushion a bit tighter. The cat mewed. “How to hell did you get your wand back?!” He abandoned his shoes which were still stuck to the floor and walked over to the bubble, pounding on it a bit. The magic wavered, but stayed strong under pressure.
“What do you think I was planning for the party, a slow dance?”
And that makes the moment last a big longer.
None more than Pansy it seemed, as she brawled and scratched her way through the crowd for a glass of whiskey. This was especially entertaining due to her barely 5’2 height and everyone’s immense fear of her. Draco chuckled softly.
“Magic.”
End of.
Where they truly got to excel though, was when muggle elec-torn-iks became part of the party, with the films and music. It confused so many people, and Octavia felt special to have Danny to explain things to her personally. It was very interesting and complex and only made her feel all the smarter.
“I pay attention to them!” This time I’ve Blaise raised an eyebrow.
"So, Harry, what were you doing today?" Oh crap.
Halfway through the lesson, the cauldron began to make a sizzling noise as the horned slugs were added. Draco thought it quite nice, but apparently Terry disagreed.
Her smiled politely as Neville and then turned her eyes onto me. Her gaze was strong and piercing and made me want to shuffle in my skin. My lowered her eyelids and grinned predatorially.
"But Draaaaaaaccoooooooo!" Octavia whined. "I'm booooorrreeeeeeed! And you know I can't go off by myself! Just chaperone me for ten minutes! Pleeeeeaaaaase?" She looked up at her big brother with puppy dog eyes.
Bagman swore loudly, much to Draco's chagrin. "Damn them!" And without another word, he Disapparated.
Potter rolled his eyes. “Don’t let it got to your head.”
There was a staircase to the left of him, and he presumed someone was walking down it. He turned his body around as much as he could and spat the wand into one hand to hide it quickly.
Pansy and Blaise unlocked their arms with Potter when they entered the great hall, but Potter continued to walk and talk with them until they got to the Slytherin table.
“I can’t help it if the universe is against me Via!”
A flash of green.
"It's actually Diagon Alley," Draco corrected quickly, mentally writing up the boy's answers. "And I'm not an elf. I'm a human." The witches were done with both of their robes by then and were gently shoving them towards the front of the shop.
“Where did you get them?”
They continued walking for another seven or so minutes before the circling passageway opened up to a wider area with a large wooden door. The door was damp and rotting slightly, the carvings on it worn with age so much that Octavia could scarcely make out what they were as she shone her Lumos over them.
"Merci! Au revoir!" The Malfoy siblings said in unison, bidding farewell to the girl. They turned back around to the surprised faces of the golden trio.
“I’m not a bleeding Malfoy! And I’m not very sure why you’re here. If you don’t want to be, then I implore you to leave.” The past part was drawled out slowly, as if talking to a toddler. This fucking kid.
“But, Draco, that doesn’t answer why you would lie to us.” Octavia said with a mischievous grin.
“FOREVER’S GONNA START TONIGHT-“
"Uh, hi! How are you?" The other boy asked, struggling to push his packed trolley along.
“Who is that?” Viktor asked, pointing ahead of him. Draco turned round to search for the target. His eyebrows raised in shock when he saw them.
Malfoy grimaced and gagged. "Ugh, never needed that mental picture Potter, I really, truly, didn't." I laughed at his discomfort.
He was almost too perfect for her.
"There he is, poor little guy."
“Ugh. I hate it when people do puppy dog eyes. It’s so annoying and prays on the inner empath. Disturbingly manipulative tactic that people who don’t deserve those tactics get.”
She waved him off. “Of course you will, just not as soon. And I said,you’ll hardly want to. The real world is full of disgusting muggles and awful half breeds and blood traitors. You’ll have the purest of pureblood right here in our house!”
"I can't even be disgusted at this point, I'm just relieved. They've been dancing around each other for years and I'm the unlucky sod who's had to put up with all their denial and bickering."
"In a concise way, yeah pretty much. I'm not very good at knowing about romance and stuff like that." I shrugged. "But it's be kind of nice to date someone who's your foil yet compliments you at the same time, you know? A whole Yin and Yang type of deal."
Draco spluttered.
Terry flushed slightly. "I think it's because I'm autistic."
“That’s enough. We had a truce.” Draco rolled his eyes as far as they would go and crossed his arms.
Once the train stopped, the younger years would be separated from the older years, the first years taking the boat before being sorted. Draco wished Octavia luck, and before she went off told her something to calm her nerves.
“Do you like it?” Danny’s voice asked from behind. Martha, who was in a similar position to Octavia, ran over to Danny and shook him slightly.
From farther away, you could hardly tell the school had been damaged at all, which put me at a greater ease than I thought it would. Getting to learn in Hogwarts without the threat of Voldemort or the reminder of the losses faced hanging over my head was far too appealing to me. I believe that over the summer, Mcgonagall along with some other staff members and volunteers had set to work with repairment spells, and I'd heard from Neville and Luna, who'd helped with the rebuilding, that the castle practically built itself back up. Luna had compared it to a large puzzle that you only needed the pieces for and the castle helped with the rest. They hadn't mentioned anything about the room of requirement so I'd figured it really had been destroyed by Crabbe's fiendfyre, which was a grand shame because I had a feeling I'd need a place to go to be alone this year.
"And what do we do with biased oppressors who hurt our friends?" It was really a wonder Snape himself hadn't hurt this uprising at this point.
* I’m Too Sexy - Right Said Fred
"I'm not, it's just...I don't know, it's weird to see him so excited. And so happy...you know...without being mean to someone." Potter's replied. Draco continued peering over the box obliviously.
"Not when it includes exams I studied for months getting cancelled, a new DADA teacher every year, and a literal murderer on the loose inside the castle!" He blurted out
"B-b-because she w-wanted t-to a-a-a-and..."
What a bane of his existence she was, always getting grades just slightly higher than his, always being the slightest bit better pupil, always having teacher’s fawn over her more. He frowned.
Draco looked scandalised. “I thought you didn’t actually read it!” He hissed. “That’s a grown up book!”
“You don’t deserve to speak of Aunt Bella that way! Blood traitor.” He hissed. “And if you’re quite done with talking about me as if I’m not right here, maybe you can go through this lovely introduction again with the weird perverts on the stairs.” He pointed behind the two idiots to a large gathering of gingers, all watching them with interest and confusion.
Draco glared at Blaise. “What is with you and Pansy lately? Why are you so obsessed with Potter?”
“You guys can watch films here? How did you get the equipment?”
Their was an incredible Wronski Feint performed by Krum that Draco cheered for, even though Irish player Lynch hit the ground with a thud.
After more peaceful Transfiguration lesson, there was a couple of hours before dinner. All of the study group (except Harry who said that he'd have to go with Ron, much to Draco's chagrin) slipped their matchstick-needles into their pockets to practice with in the library. All against Hermione's better judgement and fear that they'd get in trouble for stealing. Draco rebutted that they'd already stolen the feathers, and what was a couple of little matchstick?
“Oh.” He said intelligently.
Blaise blushed, a rare occurrence. “I told you, he doesn’t want to be open yet.”
Harry cleared his throat and focused on the feather, his eyes darting to Draco nervously. "Wingardium Leviosa!" The feather moved slightly, but stayed still on the desk. Harry frowned deeply.

It had been just over two hours and the kid wasn’t budging in his old vow of silence. Sirius had been trying to interrogate Draco about anything, but his mouth was a steal trap. The only things he would say were about having to torture the information out of him, but Sirius wasn’t in that kind of mood today.
“Fine. You do your hero job and I’ll owe you a favour.” She offered a hand for him to shake.
So try me on and I will tell you
"I'm Draco." He said, straightening his back. "Are you going to Hogwarts as well?" The boy blinked up at him through dirty glasses.
"Oh please, you were practically popping a blood vessel with the effort. Face it, charms just isn't your thing."
He’d figure something out.
Draco lead Blaise to their shared dorm and still held his hand as he collapsed backwards onto his bed. He closed his eyes.
“Will you now tell me who you’re dressed as?” Draco asked to which Blaise smirked.
“Trust me, I’m not very desperate to shake your slimy Mudblood hand either.” He said, flinching as Potter gasped next to him.
“Yeah,  guess so. Still not my favourite teacher.” He clenched his satchel strap tighter.
“I’m glad you haven’t. Because I wanna kiss you.”
What a World Cup.
"What!?" I yelled at him. "No way, you helped me enough, you don't need to pay for anything, this is my wardrobe. Besides, didn't the ministry take a load out of the Malfoy vaults?" I asked, remembering one of the punishments dealt out during the trail.
"Well shucks, I'm awful sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable at all, especially when you're being so nice to me, tryin' to make me look all presentable and whatnot."
“You mentioned Weasley. I’d think he’d be on your side about this.”
The four Ravenclaw boys walked back up the castle together. Michael seemed very into Herbology, especially the medical properties, and would not stop talking about it.
"This is the entrance the Ravenclaw common rooms. Right here," she gestured to the knocker, "is your way in. The eagle will ask you a riddle, and if you answer correctly, it will let you in. If not, you have to wait for another person to come along." There was a look of panic that spread across the first year's faces. Meredith smiled at them cheekily. "You want to know a secret about the real way to get in?" The all nodded eagerly, especially Draco, who was ready for any Hogwarts secrets he could get. "You don't actually need to know about the answer that was intended for the riddle. As long as it fits the criteria, and you can defend your answer, the eagle will let you through. We Ravenclaws don't have time to be stuck outside our common room for five minutes trying to find out the meaning of life. 'If the answer is technically true, the eagle will always let you through.' Like this." She gave the knocker three sharp knocks.
“Well neither did I! Just my luck I get stuck with an annoying little sister to boot!”
"Well...what's your name?" He already knew, but he just wanted to carry on the conversation.
“I-I’m not lying, Pansy, I-I just w-went for a walk!”
“Draco hung out with Potter!” Draco stared at her in bewilderment. As did everyone else.
“Whatever Blaise. One day your perverted nature and sex addiction will come cost you greatly.” He bopped Blaise on the head again (this time with the book) to drive in the point.
She peaked her head round a corner and witnessed a scene she’d rather not have.
Mr Ollivander bowed them from his shop.
“Draco, it’s fine. You kind of got turned into a ferret and broke your leg, you can be excused. Besides, we have all year, its okay.” He still looked disappointed and took another bite out of his sugar quill.
“Vell you could ‘ave fooled me, beau-tee-ful.” A different boy with a deep added, grinning. Draco’s cheeks continued to warm up.
“As long as the ickle firsties, second years and third years leave eventually so we can do stuff, that’s fine.”
A comfortable silence. Harry stood up with Draco and grabbed two bags.
“Well, you were here riding a broom alone at night! What’s your excuse?” He crossed his arms in a terrible attempt to look intimidating. He just looked stupid.
"Oh yes, eel-ek-trik-sity. Muggles are so odd."
“I was looking for those books.”
“It’s not a joke, I’m a legit SNACK.” Blaise yelled and covered his face with a hand. “A goddamn P.Y.T.” He mumbled tearfully.
"I know right..."
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m going to, ah, go. To the common room. Now.” He told the group before grabbing his bag and leaving.
“It’s just your ‘air is extremely light...yellow, and your skin is very pale. It looks very...
Once I made it into the Great Hall I nearly made my way over to the Gryffindor table, before remembering the new Eighth year table. I walked over to it and scanned it for anyone to sit next to. I could see Seamus and Dean, wo were thankfully not being too lovey dovey, Seamus nearly falling asleep on Dean's lap, so I deemed it un-romantic enough not to be a third wheel. Once I sat down next to Dean, he turned to greet me.
“What’s that?”
Something odd is going on.
“As I said before, I’m fine. And why do you care anyway, Potter?” He walked over to the upended broom that was stuck in the dirt.
One girl raised a large wooden board. “We were trying to see if he’d respond to this!” At a closer look, it had the alphabet on it, paired with a ‘no’ and a ‘yes’ at the top. It looked odd.
“What did you think of Moody’s lesson?” Potter asked him.
“No you’re not-“
Draco thought a moment. "Well, I've only ever seen it in illustrations and pictures, but it's supposed to be a large castle surrounded by grounds and a lake." Harry focused onto Draco, wonder in his eyes, urging him to continue. "It  has large towers and turrets, as well as dungeons, and it's apparently supposed to be chock full of secret passageways! I learnt all about them from my book, The Many Mysteries of Hogwarts Castle!" Draco boasted proudly, before getting self conscious. As his father always said, liking books is a sign of being educated, but talking about said books is a sign of blabbermouth tendencies. Still, the green eyed boy, Harry, continued to look enthralled with what he was saying.
Because in the sky above them in all it's disgusting glory lay-
“You rem-em-berr my name!” He said in awe “It is nice to see you again Drako, how is your mor-neeng?” He asked politely. Draco’s grin smoothened out properly.
“It glows better in the dark, but this looks cooler anyway. If its dark enough it can glow through your skin.” Some of the other first years gathered round Via as she stared at the glowing fangs.
“Whatever.” She yawned again and closed her eyes. “Thanks for the party.”
“Oh that is so perfect! Let me go and get my glitter!” She click clacked away.
"I turned 11 last month, June 5th 1991." He told her while leaping up onto a tall chair that stood next to the island.
“Core! My old books have been reused. I’d forgotten all about them. They got me in a lot of trouble, they did. Mum hated them. Now enough talking about me.” Sirius stood up and the binds disappeared from around him. Draco froze. He’d gotten distracted!
“Was that supposed to convince me that you weren’t a bigot?” Granger glared at him.
“That’s all? Because in the rumours I heard, Blaise punched Weasley in the face, which caused a big fight where Draco and Potter had to pull the boys off of each other, leading to Potter insulting Draco, and Draco casting Meltifo Impertinsa on him. Then Moody stepped in and transfigured you all into a different animal, before Octavia threatened to kill him.” She explained as Octavia’s eyes widened.
While Draco could definitely always go for some Timothy Doodad and Weird Sisters, he still needed a minute. Some people had begun singing to the songs while on the stage, each holding a mic and reading the words off of a black box.
"You've lost piggy back privileges."
"I think I can tell the who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks."
Nah, it was subtextual.
“As a matter of fact, I would want a dragon for a pet. They’re incredible creatures and highly intelligent. They can also breath fire,” he added as another thought. “And how are these Blast-Ended Skrewts useful, Granger? I don’t know the proper use they display and what we’ll get out of farming them, and since all they’ve done is injure a student, I believe I’m free to judge as I see fit. And these are horrid and ugly and dangerous.” He finished with a nod to his Skrewt.
Once he made it back to Neville's carriage, he saw that Hermione was in there as well, looking to be chatting his poor ear off.
He measured her for the wand she needed, before offering her a  twelve inch birch wood wand with a unicorn hair core. She gave it  a wave, and had it snatched back by Ollivander almost immediately. She was then offered a seven inch ebony wand with a phoenix feather core. She gave it another wave, and had the same thing happen again. Draco squeezed her hand reassuringly.
“Did you see what was drawn on his arm?” She asked gravely. Potter blanched.
Draco wet a bit closer to her. “Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me.” He looked at her with half lidded eyes and a smirk, overcome with sudden confidence. “You know what I want, and I got what you need.” He gestured to his body.
Draco gave his hand a quick squeeze as he walked past him, and Neville gave a grateful smile in return. He walked over to the stool a bit more confidently and put on the sorting hat.
After five painful seconds they immediately broke away from each other and gagged in disgust.
The next moment, Ludo Bagman charged into the box.
“So you’re in?”
We had a surprisingly peaceful lunch at The Three Broomsticks, with only two people recognising me and subsequently asking for an autograph. Which I then floundered at to the realisation that I don't really have a signature, and gave them each a pathetic scribble of my name. Malfoy was very amused. We'd had a discussion about calling him Tom, and he agreed to let me drop it as long as we weren't talking with someone else while in Hogsmeade.
"You will be reciting the Pureblood laws backwards while I do this. Stutter or fail to do so. and you will face the consequences." Lucius raised his cane at the ready. The boy nodded.
“Do I have to? Can’t we just hold hands. That’s fun. Don’t Leopold and Kristina do that?” He tried to bargain.
"Just what you wanted! Peaches and Apricots!" He'd asked for chocolate. He put on a smile and thanked her.
A smarter hat than me.
Harry and Draco go to buy some cosmetics and have some conversations.
Once Cedric exited the room into the chamber and the ruckus had calmed down, Dumbledore looked ready to speak again.
“Very well.” Severus intoned, unamused and droll. Draco’s mother rolled her eyes at the long-time family friend and his deplorable manners.
“For now,” Severus spoke before Harry, or Draco for that matter, could get worked up. “Let’s say… for a week.”
.” And did his best not to smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
“She likes to spoil me.”
“It wasn’t safe.” Harry said. And to his relief, no one said anything else about the matter. Except himself. “It hasn’t been safe since Cedric…” Harry explained. “The dreams, you see, and I haven’t perfected the silencing charm. I can’t get it to hold during…” He trailed off too choked up to continue. “Ron kicks me out if I get too loud, so I read in the common room until breakfast.”
“Drink.” Hermione was bright eyed and inches from his face, bent over his prone position on the couch. “I know you are not feeling well, Harry, but you need to sit up and drink.” Her smile was weak, concern poking through her furrowed brow. Harry slowly, with her help, sat upright. He gratefully took the cannister, his mouth feeling as if he bit the sand at the bottom of the Quidditch field. Again.
“You should sleep, Little One.” Draco groaned again, softly this time, and lay back down. “Come here.” He demanded in that imperious way of his sending shivers down Harry’s skin. With gentle but firm hands, Draco moved Harry into a position where Draco was flush against his back and that petting hand back in place on his chest.
. Narcissa was only slightly put out when her spell did not work. She took a moment to be impressed before impatience won out prompted by a full body shiver after a particularly lusty gust of wind.
Draco’s room was dimly lit with the heavy brocade curtains already drawn closed. The Malfoy Heir shut the heavy oak door with a firm snick and took little time to shuck his clothing, leaving it strewn across the floor in a trail to the bed. Harry watched with wide eyed wonderment until Draco moved to help him out of his own clothing. He protested with yelps and weak pushes at Draco’s hands.
. How else was she going to be useful if she did not have every facet of information?
“I cannot leave the school, Draco, I won’t say it again.” Severus’s sigh was heavy with frustration. Draco accepted his annoyance with practiced ease.
The future Lord Malfoy chose carefully. The idea of
“What you need… is rest. And a calm environment so your core can replenish itself. It will be boring, not being able to rush off into idiotic behavior, but it should be painless. I understand this will be hard for you to acknowledge any… vulnerability,” Severus spat the word knowing full well he would also be hellbent to do such a thing. “but… your pride can surely be put aside if you want to Retain Your Magic.” Snape was yelling as he clipped out the words.
“Um…” Harry had no idea how to warn her about being inadvertently truth serum-ed. “Do you know of the Unburdening Potion? I think Sn… Professor Snape created it. I’ve had a dose. There are some unusual side effects. Are you familiar?” He lifted up his hand and twirled it slow.
“Harry, darling, there is no way to pinpoint an exact length of time.” Draco’s mother said. “Magic regenerates differently from wizard to wizard. And there is no telling how fast you will recover or how much damage there actually is. It might be a few days. Or…” she paused looking distressed. “… a few months. That woman… stole… what is essentially your life force.”
“Yeah.” He pulled back, studying her face. “You are not running away ‘Mione.”
exactly what he was thing. Harry returned her smile, his own weak and sickly. He just could not find it in himself to smile. Or do anything but admire his plate filled with Treacle Tart. The desert was downright tantalizing and if it weren’t for the pit in his stomach, he was sure it would be the best he’d ever had.
“She’s ammaaaazing.” Harry drawled out slowly, half asleep already. He wiggled again, completely unaware of the effect he was having on Draco.
“I’m the arsehole? You are the one who ignored me all day and sat with fucking Malfoy! He’s the enemy Harry. Remember!”
“Focillo” Narcissa whispered aiming the spell toward the teenagers. Twin sighs of relief blessed the winter night. The temporary warming ceasing the worst of their shivers. “Come Miss Granger.” Narcissa commanded, opening her arm in invitation.
“I know that ma’am.” Still, Harry waited until she reclaimed her seat before getting closer. “You have questions, Lady Malfoy?”
Severus frowned at them both. “Perhaps it would be best if you gave the updated, Lady Malfoy.” Harry Potter was back to being uncooperative and stubborn. Merlin forbid he change his behavior.
“Mother,” Draco addressed her coolly, trying not to coo down at the boy in his arms, who was sniffling softly. “What has happened here?”
but no one made him feel like a
“Two shawls please.” She requested.
she thought. For the life of her only child, removing Lucius was necessary. And, as it turned out, for the life of the-boy-who-lived.
“Oh Harry, how are you such a sweet boy?” She asked with a watery laugh against his unruly hair.
Harry barely made it through the meal before he started nodding off. Warm. Full. And secluded with Draco at the table, Harry felt his muscles relax, his head nod forward, his eyes sliding shut only to jerk awake, panicked.
With that in mind, Harry tried to calm his frantic thoughts. He concentrated on Lady Malfoy. The way she smelled, soft and light. The way her arms were like bands around his shoulders, keeping him in place but also, not letting him fall to pieces. He subconsciously matched his intake and outtake of breath to hers. Harry shuddered when a hot tear rolled down his cheeks and dropped onto the skirt of her pretty dress. Soon he realized she was crooning a wizards lullaby and petting his hair with one hand. Slowly and calmly like one would an animal. It brought flags of color to his cheeks and under his embarrassment he reveled in the contact.
When the pain came, with his mind clear and hope blooming in his breast for
“In the future, I want to hear you to say that again. For an entirely different reason.” Draco said seductively dark, leaning down so no one else could hear. His slim body was positively rigid. Harry turned his attention to the Slytherin, snuggling in closer for as long as he was allowed.
And now… well now… he had a second chance. And a clear mind. All thanks to Harry Potter’s blood.
(See the end of the chapter for
Pansy tried to willfully ignore Luna as she shook Granger awake. The bushy haired girl immediately grabbed her wand and Pansy could not help but be impressed by her quickness.
“They cannot, my Dragon.” She smiled at Draco with all teeth, more as a response to the ineptitude of the Ministry of Magic than her son’s question. “Accidental magic tends to leave witnesses. I do remember hearing about a ballooned muggle over South London. I take it, that was you?” She turned back to Harry with a much sweeter smile.
“Indeed.” Said Fred gravely, diligently trying to gain her attention.
“Excellent.” Hermione said gathering her wherewithal. “What’s the plan?”
“Not on your life.” Harry squeezed her into a laughing yelp. “We should have done this ages ago.”
Three Slytherins under one cloak, magic though it may be, were suffocating with awkwardness. Pansy wanted to lead without knowing which direction to travel. Zambini refused to stay in the back, trying to circle around the other two, under the cloak, without exposure or making noise. And Draco was struggling with over-protectiveness and possessiveness since the cloak was Harry’s and Harry, essentially (read: unofficially), was
“I’m glad.” Harry blurted out without thinking. A distraction. “That you don’t share your bed. With anyone else.” He explained blushing bright red and thankful for the dark.
The seventh-floor corridor was the only empty hallway in the castle, foreboding with its blank wall. Neville had to help Harry up the last few steps then propped him up against the wall to pace back and forth and back until the door appeared. The action was reckless, but Harry was too winded to protest. He had to gather his strength prepared take off running once Neville was safely inside. Harry caught a glimpse of Draco’s furious face searching the hallway through the open doorway. A longing welled up in Harry. He wished he could join the Slytherin. To lean on him. To depend on him. However, Harry knew he could not do any of those things. Ron’s betrayal was too fresh, and this truce was too new. Harry could not trust it.
Inside the tower, Harry broke out into a sweat. This was absolutely the last place he wanted to be. As he climbed the stairs to his dorm, Harry dreaded every step knowing once he was in the room, there was little he could do to escape Ron. If Ron had not decided to ignore him again. Sure enough, Ron was already there, waiting on Harry’s bed, jaw set with determination. Harry did his best to avoid him. Ron was not playing along.
With as much control as he could muster, Harry spoke softly. “You’ve also ignored me. Every summer. When the Dursley’s were at their worst. You have doubted my sanity. Called me a Liar. Too many times to count. Or, and honestly this is kicker,” he laughed humorlessly. “ended our friendship because you thought I put my name in the goblet of fire. I could have forgiven you. Was already there, until I heard you with the guys yesterday.”
“I see.” She said in response, pulling her hand back slowly. She smiled crinkling up the corners of her eyes. “I have heard you are quite… capable,” she tilted her coifed head towards her son. Draco had gone back to his book, pretending to read. He would have been convincing if he were not blatantly squinting suspiciously at the two of them.
“Wheezing!” Harry exposed his head with a scowl.
The hours passed like molasses in the homey confines of the Gryffindor common room. Slowly the students filtered out until Harry was left alone on the small sofa in front of the fireplace. He sat quietly in the dark until the fire burned itself down to embers and soot, smoldering in the chilly night. The room was decidedly colder without the hoard of warm bodies crowding around. Harry was glad for this. The cold air helped him concentrate on his breathing. On keeping his eyes open when they begged to slide shut and rest against his flushed cheeks. Harry must stay awake, stay aware, so no one could sneak up on him. Harry liked to stay aware of his surroundings having been surprised so very often. If he sat very still and did not get lost in his thoughts, he could get some form of rest. A meditative state in which no one could sneak up on him.
“Perfectly understandable,” Draco lied smoothly. It was a shame the House rivalries existed. Without them, there would be no need for security. No need to fear pranks or worse. No need to be defined for arbitrary and sometimes overlapping personality traits.
Draco did not waste any time. “Potter’s Unburdening will be wearing off soon.” He announced coolly. He registered his professor’s surprise and wondered at it.
“Why does it even matter.” The boy was back to slumping, already defeated by the idea of sharing pertinent information. His body language was closed off, small, as if he was willing himself to disappear. It was fitting the boy inherited an invisibility cloak. The two adults watched as he backed away to sit on the sofa. A step up from the floor.
“She’s nice.” He admitted. “So was Snape.”
Harry flinched hard enough to fall on the stone floor, not prepared for the blinding spike of pain shooting through his skull. Ron stood over him panting, though he had hardly moved and for the first time, Harry felt fear akin to the fear he felt for the Dursleys. And this toward his best mate, his first friend. Infuriated to be brought to such a place, Harry jumped back to his feet, ignoring the twinge of his ribs, the throb of his hand.
“No, Ma’am.” Harry denied. “It’s not that I don’t ‘believe’ you.” He qualified. “You don’t have to protect me. I can take care of myself.” He said with conviction. A memory of Cedric Diggory's cold dead stare haunting him still.
“Harry!” Except, it seemed, Hermione.
while his mother and Harry had a discussion. Rude.
“Oh Hermione, don’t.” Harry pleaded softly. He flung his cloak into the snow, wrapping his arms around his friend. “I’ll see you first thing.” He promised into her neck. Hermione let out one quiet sob and nodded in agreement.
“Yes Draco?” Harry inquired when Draco did not say anything else. He was hesitant to lift his head. The stares had been few but piercing. Their little tableau had drawn much attention. Harry could not find it in himself to care as long as he kept his head down. Draco was too busy trying to convince Harry to eat the oatmeal since there were a disturbing lack of pancakes. And Hermione was diligently reading the tiny print of the ingredients on the nutrient potions Snape had provided.
“It’s a really good secret...” Blaise looked interested. And a bit amused. Draco didn’t know why.
Draco smiled hesitantly. He and Terry sat opposite the rambunctious boys, eating breakfast, hurrying to get their schedules from Professor Flitwick. The post had already come from the people with family owls. There wasn't a whole lot of it, but once the last owl had come, Draco breathed a large sigh of relief. And so he'd spent the majority of breakfast looking over to the Gryffindor table longingly. Harry and the Weasley were talking, as well as Hermione and Neville. It seemed he'd been completely forgotten.
"We do have Transfiguration together...and Charms! And Astronomy! Does that say at midnight on Wednesdays? We probably won't have time to talk then...we do have the daytime lessons though." As they were doing this Neville walked over to them.
"Yeah, their brand has really gone downhill since Potter joined. Well, since Voldemort went there I guess, but I blame Potter for most of the Hogwarts drama."
“What was it...tickle the pear?” He asked himself aloud. He tried it uncertainly, but was pleasantly surprised when the portrait swung open to reveal the kitchens.
"We'll be the best power couple Hogwarts has ever seen, Drakey-poo!" Draco gagged.
“I’m hungover? I drank alcohol?!” Potter began to sound a bit panicked. “Hermione’s gonna kill me, I’m far too young. So is McGonagall...maybe even Sirius...oh fuck I’m dead.”
“Whatever. Bye.” He allowed himself to put up a middle finger at them even though it was COMPLETELY out of order for a pureblood.
"Thought I'd tell you how to do it, it's not as if you Gryffindors would use it for evil."
Things weren't okay. Things were far from okay. Things were never okay, and Draco wondered when he'd get used to that.
“-which then made Patricia throw a stapler at him, as if he didn’t see that coming. It hit him square between the eyes and he was out cold. But that wasn’t before Patricia’s ex-boyfriend Mike went and-“
“You ask too many questions.” Draco said a
"My name's Harry, Harry Potter." Ron's face went paler.
“I know right.”
“Tell Posy and Mother that.” She held his hand and squeezed it.
I hope you enjoyed that chapter even will all its drama. I mostly used this chapter t set up some arcs that might continue, and the next chapter will either have the badge’s response, possible Ron moments, or even the first task! (Don’t rely on the last one)
He opened heavy book again, and tilted it away from Potter slightly, before opening the smaller one inside so it couldn’t be seen. He wasn’t going to let Potter interrupt his reading.
“Just cover it up with a shirt, we can deal with it later.” Draco obeyed and covered himself with the rest of his uniform. He looked into a mirror on the wall with a grimace.
"And where was your mother?" Oh no.
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome, kindly welcome - the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team! I give you - Dimitrov!"
"Who?" He asked. He then looked to where she was looking. He grimaced. "Oh please tell me you don't mean Weasley, Granger and Potter."
As soon as he did so a house elf appeared.
“Good to see you! Did you find Madame Maxime in the end?”
When we got back to the castle, Malfoy said it was 4 o'clock. We'd been out for over five hours. We walked through the castle to the Eighth year dorms, looking forward to when I could finally put down all this luggage and rest my poor noodle arms. We made it into the common room and I collapsed onto a sofa, finally letting the bags drop to the floor. Malfoy collapsed beside me, the fatigue catching up with him as he let his bags drop down in a pile.
“Good lie. Now tell me the truth.” He shook Vince’s shoulder a bit to try and get the boy to open up, even though it was historically difficult.
The students began to file into the great hall for dinner, so Octavia bid Martha (and Danny) goodbye. She pushed her way through the students to the Slytherin fourth years and managed to manoeuvre herself between Greg and Vince. At the lack of attention she was getting, Octavia raised her head and immediately came face to face with Viktor Krum. He looked at her with one large eyebrow raised.
Eventually he’d woken everyone up to the point where the only person left was...
"Huh." Draco thought for a moment. "That's interesting." A new source on information. Neurodevelopmental disorders and mental illnesses were topics buried well in the library and archives. He'd heard of the shunning that occurred if any baby showed signs that it was 'lesser' in any way. Usually a mercy kill. Quick and easy. Even if it were an ancient practice, it was proficient, because that is how a Malfoy should be. Those were usually the stories that he got if he ever asked his father for a bedtime story. Nightmare fuel with a vaguely threatening message, the message usually being 'if you mess up, you're next on the chopping block'.
"I'd like to check out the Ravenclaw library first, but I'll see you guys up there." They waved to each other as the three other three went up the stairs, and Draco went through the door that was in the middle of the niche of books.
“I-I um, no I’m n-not part Veela.” Draco smiled awkwardly. The Durmstrang boy smirked widely.
“Just get to the point.”
"Ferret face."
"An awful lot of green in here. What are you, a Slytherin?" He joked, lifting up a green shirt, hoodie and pair of jeans. I laughed awkwardly, making grabby hands back to get my clothing away from any more scrutiny. But that doesn't stop him from going to the other bag from Dervish and Banges. Before I could stop him, he'd picked out the bottle of Cheryl Sheelar's Sherbert Scented Shampoo. He was looking at it with a sort of confused horror. He turned it to me and asked "What the fuck is this then?"
Hagrid looked stumped so Draco elaborated.
To achieve their ends.
"Hey, why do they bother with key locks when we can all just Alohomora it open?" He considered this a moment.
Narcissa continued to switch round the different tubes, using a thin one to create rose petals, another to make a smiley face. Draco loved this part of cake baking. Mother was focused and careful and quiet. She was like she always was. Before everything changed. Draco loved watching his mother when she was focused on her craft. It was theraputic and peaceful and he didn't need to be a Malfoy. Rule Number 1; A Pureblood is always perfect.
“Sirius, I feel like now is definitely the time to explain everything.” Potter said, begging the other man. Draco sat back down, keeping an eye firmly on Potter.
“Oh you are so sweet and lovely my little Death Eater in training, but there will be no need. Will you be okay all by yourself with Kreacher?” Draco immediately grew tired to think of spending any time alone with Kreacher. He nodded nonetheless.
“But then I’d be indebted to you Potter, and nothing would cause me more grief than that. I’m not going to be another person you save out of the goodness of your Gryffindor heart. I’ve been taught that every good deed comes with a price, so what’s yours?”
“Is that vhat the girl vith the large hair is called? Granger?” He asked.
“I made them up. I actually had a pretty boring summer, so I wanted to make up something to sound more interesting...so I lied.” Blaise stared intently at his lap. Draco cocked his head.
"Pureblood, doesn't that mean pure wizard? Like magic from all sides of the family?" She asked.
"U-uh, w-w-well, um, a wizard's mental state is a big part of magic, like Occlumency. Motivation is important, and uh, yours was messed up." Draco explained.
“I don’t care about my mother.”
“Do you ‘appen to be part Veela?” The boy asked, the ‘V’ very pronounced. Draco blinked.
"Harry?" Through the crowd of muggles the messy haired boy from the shop pushed his large trolley through. A snowy white owl sat in a cage on top of it. It made Draco jealous. He had wanted his own owl but the manor already had plenty and his father said that he could use their's. He didn't get a pet either, not even one of the baby peacocks to look after for the year. And he'd just started reading about how to care for them.
“Well it is usually started by you.”
Draco loved this story. It was not as badass as the underdog story of Pluto the dragon tamer, but it was happier. He knew that if Lucius were to find it in the book he would burn the lovely pages, so he kept them as pristine and dog-ear-less as possible so as not to draw attention to them.
“Wait a minute! Pansy, you’d ask Draco?” Blaise asked her lifting his head slightly.
"I...guess that would be...fine..." Granger replied hesitantly, ignoring Weasley's anger. "Look! It doesn't matter if you go with us or not, I just want to start moving!" Potter nodded and so
“Ah vell, I vill see you Drako.”
“Guilty as charged my friend. We’ve also got to plan some games.”
“Draco, are you okay?” Octavia asked him.
, it was just getting boring. Draco had run out of things to do inside, and nothing could console him. He had read every book in the library (even the ones he knew he wasn’t supposed to), had practiced every spell to near perfection, had charted very star in the sky, and had brewed every possible potion.
"Malfoy didn't do anything! None of us did!" Potter defends, ever the knight in shining armour.
"Draco, look!" She yelled, tugging on his sleeve and pointing to where the referee was. He looked to be trying to flirt with the Veela, to everyone in the stadium's amusement. Draco saw this and threw his head back to laugh.
"But aw gee, Mr Malfoy, that ain't a nice thing to do to your makeover guinea pig."
"Meh meh meh meh meh," Michael imitated Anthony. Anthony just laughed. Draco felt out of the loop. "Hey, uh, blondie?" Draco peeked his head over the bunk in response. "What's your name again?"
"Where did you learn language like that?" He teased, grinning at her, nose wrinkled awkwardly.
“The story’s about Nathan and Katrina, a pureblood and half blood respectively. Katrina’s family used to work for Nathan’s family’s estate, and they met at the estate’s lake when they were children. They met each other as often as they could and eventually...fell in love.” He glanced up at Potter. He nodded encouragingly. “They want to marry each other desperately, but Nathan is already engaged to Miss Davinton. He can’t call the marriage off, or else Miss Davinton will be wed to a peasant , and he doesn’t want her life on his hands. But he can’t just break up with Katrina, he loves her. So I think he’s going to get Miss Davinton to flee to France with him and Katrina for a new life, where she won’t get married off and Katrina and Nathan can elope. Or at least I hope that’s what happens, because Lord Pevilso is attempting to court Katrina, and she’ll be unable to refuse since her courtship with Nathan isn’t public or proven.” He explained in greater depth, getting quite passionate.
“You’d think it, wouldn’t you?!” Potter exclaimed and sighed. “I have no idea why he’s acting like an arse about it.” He complained defeatedly.
“Thanks Draco.”
"You may recite them from where I stopped you, Rule Number 16. And another thing..." Lucius grabbed the boy's sweaty hand from where they were held behind his back and forced them straight out in front of him. His hands were small and dainty, the nails looking manicured. Lucius continued to use force to shove the boy's sleeves up to his forearms, revealing harsh red lines littering them, elbow to wrist. The boy looked straight forward.
Draco leapt to her defence immediately, despite the mudblood looking like a fourth year, and fired many face shaping hexes.
Blaise snickered again.
“I’ll charm them after the first two lessons, but this is too good an opportunity to miss,” she cackled and Draco scowled.
The got up from the docks, though Octavia hardly remembered sitting down, and headed their separate ways once they went inside.
He was then tapped on the shoulder.
Draco opened his eyes and sure enough, he was on the other side of the room. His bed was neater than this one. And his bed didn’t have a Blaise Zabini lying in it.
Sirius snorted. “Alright then. Just Draco here was living in Grimmauld Place, a house which he has never left.” Potter’s eyes widened and Draco crossed his arms. When you said it out loud of course it sounded a bit odd.
“It’s adorable.”
"So you could be an emergency light source?"
They giggled with each other.
* Promiscuous - Nelly Furtado, Timbaland
He took out a tub of dittany and spread it over the gashes lightly, hissing at the sting of it. There wasn't a lot, and it and it wasn't fresh or dried, so the scar would still be quite prominent. He still figured that it was better than nothing. He then took out a  roll of bandages and tied them round his arms. There. He tied them round his hands as well. Now he was like a warrior. Or a pirate. Someone who had cuts and blisters on their hands and arms from sword-fighting. That was way cooler. The boy packed away the medical supplies back into the wooden box and hid it back under the sink.
"She'll be fine." He told himself, before heading to the robe shop.
“Okay, you’re still drunk.” Draco’s giggled calmed down and he tried to scowl. He didn’t think he was very intimidating. The other boy was smirking.
Once she had changed clothes, some other girls from the dorm came rushing into the room excitedly, gathering around Martha for makeup help. Octavia edged away from them all a bit, not wanting to cramp Martha further. Martha met her eyes and smiled.
“Draco used to use so much gel it permanently altered his hair. He wanted to look like Father...” she trailed off a bit. Martha coughed awkwardly.
"Yes." Terry nodded sadly.
“I...don’t...really know...I don’t know! It was night and I was tired and filled with adrenaline and sugar and I don’t know! Maybe because I have too much to do? Maybe because I’m sick of getting hurt one way or another? Maybe I’ve had enough of losing? Or maybe I’ve grown bored of egging Potter to do something stupid. Maybe I’ve gotten sick of Potter all together. I don’t know.” Draco shakes Blaise off his shoulder as he sat up and hugged the pillow to his chest uncertainly.
"Wingardium Leviosa!" Anthony yelled from the floor. He lifted a schoolbag and dropped it onto Hermione's head.
He was confused. Lucius had told him time and time again that he'd be in Slytherin. It was in his blood. All his ancestors had been, so why hadn't he? He considered whether his mother could've had an affair, but knew it wasn't true. He shared an awful resemblance with his father.
in her brother. They all looked at him quite curiously when he spoke, probably due to his practiced eloquent speech pattern, or the plummy voice Octavia knew she also possessed.
"Well mine WAS 2 meters above the ground! So at least now you've admitted I'm the best chair lifter!"
“Promiscuous boy, you're one and the same. So we don't gotta play games no more.” Her eyes darted to his lips. He nearly froze and died on the spot.
“He calls me Pans Park.” She told Potter in a gossipy way.
Dean and Seamus exchange a look, and with a nod, they face him again.
Draco glanced around the group to try distract himself. It seemed that alcohol only made his internal monologue worse to deal with.
“Mini Malfoy.” He addressed her and she scowled.
“Then pick a line. Why would you want to attend the party when from what I’ve heard there’s a perfectly good one being held in Gryffindor tower.”
Everything hurts.
"I don't care about it!" I defended quickly, "I just thought it'd be kind of odd being in Hogwarts without him being a prat, tha's all."
She was unfortunately shot down immediately by Moody.
"He was always kind to me. He brought us food and water, and managed to sneak down a couple blankets, even at the risk of torture. He'd keep me company, and was a great conversationalist. Good at listening. And talking." She trailed off quietly, looking into her mug. It was quiet for a couple of seconds before she shook her head. "We met properly at Hogwarts after the battle, when McGonagall was deciding on his parole. He cleaned at Hogwarts with me for a little while, and we became friends. I was allowed to take him out sometimes when he was living in the muggle world. He had to be with someone at all times when he went out, so he chose me to keep watch."
Many were already gathered in the common room, but not to go to breakfast and fawn over the tournament. He spotted the three half muggle half wizard siblings, fifth year Leo, fourth year Abi, and second year Ross, (he thought their last name was Kimberly..?) dressing up all of Slytherin. They’d brought along many Halloween decorations, and although it was a far cry from the Samhain celebrations the manor used to throw, it did look kind of....fun. If hideously muggle.
“We are no longer in need of your presence. Begone.” The house elf Apparated away obediently.
"So do I!" Draco says happily. Sure, the only reason he got the Child's Potions Lab was because of Lucius' need for Draco to be the best at each subject, but his mother got him the subscription to the magazine. He'd griped about wanting one absentmindedly while plaiting her hair, and he supposed she'd taken it into her own impulsive hands. She had an odd habit of getting Draco gifts behind both his and Lucius' backs.
This did exclude non-purebloods from the party a bit, as Martha nearly got laughed out when she expressed how she didn’t grow up in a manor or mansion. Danny didn’t even try...though that was probably for the best. Octavia couldn’t imagine what awful place he might have come from as a fully muggleborn.
"I like your sass mini Malfoy! Malfoy, is this what you would you would have been like if you were a girl?" One of them asked Draco. He scowled at them and looked away. "Ah classic Malfoy!"
“You were meant to!”
“They better not be in your fuckin’ pockets.” Potter grumbled and Draco laughed again.
After all of the whispers were done with, Dumbledore cleared his throat.
“I am not obsessed.” He hissed.
“Sorry!” The boy yelled.

on the loose and
He seemed hesitant to walk in at first, seeing a couple of people inside, seeming to have forgotten that he had a strong glamour on. I rolled my eyes and practically had to push him inside to continue the day. He dug his heels into the ground on impulse but I continued pushing him until we were at the back of the shop where copious amount of "muggle" clothing were held, seeming to be untouched.
“It’s my mother’s side of the family. The Black family is and always has been a French one. Not only that, but the Malfoy family has french roots.” He explained boredly.
"A-a-a-and what Draco?" Lucius mocked. "How stupid can you be?" He slammed another book on the boy's head. "You know she shouldn't leave the grounds!" Another book. "What were you thinking?!" Another. "She could've gotten hurt," this book was heavier, "or taken advantage of," the books were piling up precariously, "she could've had one of her fits right in public Draco!" The book was used to batter his forearm before it went on top of his head. "Do you realise what could have gone wrong?! Stupid boy!" This book was thinner, but still hurt as it was used to slap Draco across the face. Not a single book fell from the violent assault of their carrier.
“Yes it is Malfoy, Potter, and he wants you to get the hell up.” Draco said as if he was talking to a toddler. When Potter still didn’t wake up he rolled his eyes.
“Oh, see! Drako also remembers my name! You are not special Borislav!” The jock ruffled the shorter boy’s hair.
"And here I was thinking you were going to get dolled up just for me." I batted my eyelashes at him jokingly and he smirked.
“...oui.”
The Malfoy siblings argue, Blaise and Martha get talking, and the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students come to Hogwarts.
“You are only fourth year?” Viktor sounded surprised, and Draco flushed happily. “You look more mature than many.”
"Sorry!" Anthony and Michael called back in unison as they grinned at each other. Draco exchanged a look with Terry. What can you do? Draco looked up from the table and saw Hermione waving at him. He smiled and waved back, and she gestured to the doors, a motion that meant 'can we talk a second?'
"Okay Potter, we've sorted your wardrobe, Now to deal with...the rest of it." He gestured to my face vaguely. I rolled my eyes but pulled down a lock of my hair over my eyes, grimacing at what a mess it was.
Draco wasn't really focusing as he walked with his sister, hands in pockets, kicking up grass. He was lost in his thoughts until an utterly loathsome voice decided to interrupt them.
She clenches her fists. “Probably because you purebloods have held greater political power than muggleborns for as many decades as you’ve been using the word. It’s pretty difficult to ‘put up a fuss’ when you’re constantly being put at a disadvantage.” She sniffs. “But I pity you Malfoy.”
"Here's your bag," He handed him one. Draco smiled.
“Isn’t it? And I have such a positive attitude!” Potter snickered at that.
Dean Thomas was first, not lasting long at all before hopping around the room singing the national anthem like a loon. Draco hoped he wouldn’t have to do something so humiliating, but didn’t hold his breath. Him and Moody already didn’t have the best history when it comes to public humiliation.
“Magic.” Draco answered shortly, causing Potter to snort. “And it’s my turn to ask the questions. Why are you here?”
He keeps them safe just in case.
Getting sick of only seeing things through a sack, he awkwardly twisted himself to tear the sack off using his feet. Cushion the cat jumped on his lap as he contorted himself. After a minute off struggling it was torn off and he was greeted to his surroundings.
“Fine.” He stood up and walked in front of her. He put one hand on her shoulder awkwardly, and the other on her waist, as if they were about to dance. He glanced up at her face again before a focused look overtook him. He then determinedly leaned forward and pressed his lips to hers.
"I. Am. Tired." He dragged the last word. Harry nodded again.
“What’s this then?” Potter waved it in front of Draco while Draco desperately tried to get it back. “
"Draco, that was incredible!" Hermione said to him, eyes shining. "That was the most impressive magic I've ever seen! You were only suppose to lift the feather, but you lifted the desk! And no one got hurt at all!"
"If it's any condolence, it was really annoying for me at the time. Really drove it in that Potter Stinks. I did like the support for Cedric though," he smiled at me halfheartedly. "You were a pretty great arch rival though. A good distraction from everything that was going on. And you put in so much effort to continue our rival, it just convinced me that it was more real. It helped me get my anger out, because I could pin it all on you and your stupid glittery blonde hair." He rolled his eyes and snickered.
"What's going on in here?" Pansy faced me, her face flushed pink from breathlessness. She calmed herself quickly, using a hand in front of her face, which she dragged down to drain her face of emotion. It looked like a well practiced tactic to look neutral, and was creepily effective.
“Well there aren’t a lot of Black family members left anyway.” Draco pointed out, albeit a bit fearfully. “So it doesn’t matter for now.” Kreacher grinned.
They exited the room together and took separate paths. They waved goodbye to each other.
“Oh I see, you just want to wear out your poor old brother when he’s trying to be nice. How cruel.”
“I was. I let Vince have him. And that’s why I get you.” She prodded him in the chest. “Time for our song.” She pulled him closer to whisper in his ear. “Let’s act.” This made him smirk.
Draco made a gimme motion. “Give them here then. Prove it.”
At the end of the group was Draco and Terry. Terry dropped Draco's hand for a moment to pet the eagle thoughtfully. "Thank you Bernie," he thanked the knocker just as Meredith did. They followed after the group.
“You mean after you wiped the floor with us and stole fifty galleons, 20 sugar quills and 30 chocolate frogs from everyone?” Theo corrected, recalling the gambling hour.
The silence was broken by Octavia. “Don’t do that, you’re hurting him!”
“I’d rather be a weasel than a ferret!”
Blaise scoffs. “This coming from Mr Pretty Boy Perfect Hair himself? You’re such a hypocrite.” Draco yawned.
"I just brushed it guys, seriously," I mumbled into the table. I heard a clink in front of me and raised my head to see a balanced breakfast stacked on a plate, courtesy of Dean. God bless dad friends. I started tucking in.
“I’m also tired. We can continue bad talking Diggory in the morning.” Draco pushed Blaise out of the bed.
"Yeah! Screw Snape! But uh, quick question; what is handflapping?" Michael added, quite unhelpfully.
"Set up our tent. Be careful with the material, some of it is silk. Everything is kept in this," he gestured to the case. "And just tether the peacocks to the entrance, as a decoration of sort." This earned him a smack to the back of the head from Narcissa. The children gasped and looked at each other mirthfully.
“Drako, we ‘eard that you were ‘aving a party with...Sly-the-reen. For the ‘Alloween? No?” Aleksander asked. Draco’s eyes darted to the trio. Granger was looking at him with slight judgement, Weasley with amusement, and Potter with anger. Or, not anger at Draco. At...Dobromir?
“It wouldn’t be as fun if I told you.” He held the badge up to his eyeline. “Support CEDRIC DIGGORY - the REAL Hogwarts Champion.” He read out, raising an eyebrow. “Didn’t know you cared that much about Diggory. Or the tournament for that matter.” Draco snatched the badge away.
If you don't know about my other fanfic, It's Easier Than Hating, then please check that out, it's an Eighth year fic, and as of know it's on a hiatus (sorry) until I can sort myself out. Your support means the world to me so I hope you have a great day and a great life! Catch you later, BisexualGurrl! xoxo
Except he didn't.
Narcissa didn't want her to leave the manor yet, so all of her and Draco's school supplies were delivered by owl. Octavia had read through her school material and decided to ask Draco what other books she should take from the Mansion's library. He recommended any that he regretted not taking in first year, as well as reminding her about the strict 'NO DARK ARTS' policy that was held at Hogwarts, so if she was going to take some books featuring it, she'd have to be secretive. She decided she wouldn't risk it anyway, admittedly still pretty shaken by what had happened that night in the woods as well.
“Hey Drakey Drakey Drake!” Pansy came bounding up to him. “You look quite lost in your thoughts my darling.” She looped an arm with his. He raised a brow.
She flicked though it again.
"Gah!" Neville yelled out suddenly as a toad flew past Draco and into his face. "Trevor! Don't run - or I guess hop - off again! I couldn't find you for forever! How did you get out of your box?" Neville scolded the toad on his face. Draco nearly snickered at the display, but kept it in.
“You’re forbidden from my room for forever.”
“Oh mon Dieu! Are you ze Harry Potter?!” Juliette shrieked excitedly, rushing over to the twat to fawn. The others followed suit, one of them even brushing his hair over his forehead to reveal that Merlin-for-shaken lightning bolt scar.
They were woken up in the middle of the night by Narcissa.
Potter claps politely for him.
“We’re going to make charmed badges for Diggory, against you, and maybe make some cash as well.” Potter kept staring. “What? Might as well capitalise on the hatred towards you. I was the first one to hate you.”
“As long as I get to attend the party.”
"I'll have you know it's a very prestigious career!" The closet yelled back.
“That isn’t an answer. Do you think muggleborns are lesser wizards and witches?”
Well that would make for a great story, there’s only one problem.
"Hahahah! You've got to teach me some of those really wizard swears someday, seriously. The worst I've ever heard being said was 'Merlin'." Draco scowled at him jokingly.
“Pfft, rude.”
But there was an evil witch! And she had kidnapped him as a baby! She was just...his aunt...
"You are such a git."
"Yeah, but come on Potter. Following a bloke into the bathroom randomly with no context? You were lucky I was crying Potter, what if I walked into the bathroom to just take a piss, or worse, wank? You would have followed me in regardless." I didn't know if it was possible to blush harder when Malfoy mentioned wanking. I don't know why, but the mention of sex and the like just makes me really uncomfortable.
Draco looked...bad.
A couple of hours more on the stairs he started to drift off, head leaning on the wall. He was about to lose consciousness when he heard a click.
He picked out two large books from under his mattress. One was an extensive reading on astronomy, astrology, mythology and legends, a 1st edition. It was his mother's favourite. She loved his name and how he was named  after a constellation. She made learning about his family fun, because when talking about them he'd get to learn about their name and origins.
“Realised you’re in the snake pit?” He teased, popping the ‘p’. Potter looked at him furiously.
Potter nodded before throwing his head back and downing it. He grimaced again before it must’ve taken effect, as he smiled in ease.
Then it was Blaise’s turn, who Draco guesses was cursed to go in front of the class and dance ridiculously. It started off with funny show tune moves, all the dramatics of the stage, but eventually wore into more...um...suggestive dance moves. It was about this point that Draco realised it.
"Yes, but if there was such a task, you couldn't deny my brilliance at it!"
Blaise blushed faintly. Or Draco thought he did. You couldn’t really see it because of his skin tone. Draco was jealous. You could always tell when Draco turned pink. He was pale as parchment and twice as white. Or something.
“That’s why we’ve got to try harder.”
“Can you two NOT in front of my sister? Or worse, in front of me?”
"Well I should probably get to class. I have Potions with Snape first thing." Draco fake gagged.
"Oh look, we're here!"
"Here you go Potter," Malfoy handed me two large Gladrags Wizardwear shopping bags full of clothes with a big smirk. I scowled at him and snatched the bags away from him. "That's it Potter, accept some good old fashion help. How do you like it when people are nice to you for no good reason?" I have to admit that it's odd and I'm slightly thrown off. I stumble a little, the bags weighing down on my arms. "Come along, lets get out of here already, we've been in here for 2 hours. Let's go get some lunch." He grabbed my forearm and dragged me out of the doors, laughing a little as me and the bags got stuck on the way out.
asked him. Draco raised his signature eyebrow.
"Well that's not fair. Who says we have to listen to him. I want to see Andy! Who is he to stop me? We should go and see her!" Oh no. She always switched between child and adult, and now she was going to have a tantrum.
Until next time beautifuls! Please stay safe in this trying time and WEAR A GOSH DARN MASK! It's common sense! Luv ya <3 xxxx
“Who’s there?” He tried to ask in his confident voice. No answer. He glared at the shoe that peeked round the cobble. “If you don’t show yourself now, I will curse you, I will.” He tried to threaten. No answer. Draco sighed and stared some more at the shoe, trying to recognise. It was incredibly scuffed, ad it looked pretty muggle-made. The laces were in tatters, and the left side was falling off. He wondered who it belonged-
"I-I'm sorry, here let me..." He struggled to maneuver his trolley out of the way. As soon as he did the oldest boy marched towards the wall and went through. Draco blinked twice. Huh. Seamless.
“I’ll probably help them. Bye.” He kissed her on the cheek before getting up and leaving with as much grace as he could handle.
“Et le mein!”
“She’s a cat. Obviously.” Potter raised an eyebrow. “You better not mention whatever you’re thinking to her unless you want her heel up your arse.” Draco warned the other boy. Potter’s eyes widened slightly in fear. Draco smirked.
"That's right sir."
Draco filled his satchel with his half of the care package, including a newspaper he elected to read later. He pulled out a couple of sugar quills to pop in his pocket. Those would keep his boredom at bay, as he saw that his first two lessons were Arithmancy and Care of Magical Creatures.
“Calm down Drake, the dorms are that way.” Blaise pointed him in the opposite direction that he was going. He was so helpful. Draco held onto his hand tightly. So helpful...
He made a clicking sound with his mouth and Cushion responded by jumping onto his lap. He craned his neck towards them.
I’m sorry if I haven’t picked your prompts, just keep commenting to remind me rip I am sorry 😭 I will get round to them eventually. I hope you have a nice day and stay tuned for the next chapter of Double Trouble!
“Padfoot! How was the house? Do you think it’s good for an operations base?” Harry bombarded him before reaching over the bike to hug him. Sirius returned the hug gladly.
“A girl? There wasn’t a girl!”
“Promiscuous boy, I'm callin' your name. But you're driving me crazy, the way you're making me wait.” Pansy went closer to his and grabbed the front of his shirt, making him internally panic and short circuit for 0.3 seconds.
"Fine, I digress. Humanity is what's weird. It just keeps on finding new ways to decide who's better or not, when what should decide it is how good a person you are. The only problem is, the people who decide what decides the hierarchy are usually the racist jerks, so they do what it takes to stay on top. They're also probably rich." He felt a slight guilt rise in him as he thought about his father and his wealth.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I...have also never kissed anyone...”
"I, uh, suppose I am. Do you know anything about it?" Ah. So the scrawny boy was a muggleborn then. Must be a shock for him. Draco stared at the boy curiously. A source of new information.
The champions are chosen and the Halloween party is planned.
“Oh nothing...” Blaise said in a sing-song voice. Draco scowled.
“Professor, he’s crying.” Pansy’s faint voice returned. She sounded sad and angry. He couldn’t bring himself to care.
"I had EXTREMELY curly hair. I had ringlets and curls and it made me look like a doll. A girl doll." At the sudden image of Malfoy with curly hair, I couldn't have stopped myself from bursting out laughing even if I wanted to. He grinned at me. "I know! It was the curliest and frizziest thing when I was younger. Then when I turned nine, Lucius told me I looked too feminine to be his son, so I started wearing product in it. But since my hair was so curly, it took practically half a jar of hair gel each time, so I had to buy it in bulk. When I reached Fourth year I managed to learn a straightening charm that could hold for twelve hours at a time. After a couple years it just kind of became permanent. I haven't had curly hair in almost a decade." He tugged down a lock of his dyed black hair with a wistful smile. He then turned back in front of us.
"But it's only 8 o'clock." Terry pointed to the blue clock hanging under one of the lanterns.
“Hehe, thanks. Depends what I’m doing on Christmas to be honest.” Potter replied vaguely and Draco snorted. “And I admit, I didn’t take Slytherin for very pro-muggle.”
As they began brainstorming where it could be, Draco whispered to Octavia. "The supposed greatest wizard in Britain. Behold him, in all his clumsiness," and Octavia began giggling.
"Draco? Octavia?" She sees them. "Draco! Octavia!" She's nearly crying. She embraces them both. "I couldn't find you anywhere, I was scared to death! We're going back to the Manor. I'm Apparating the both of you right now!"
We walked the rest of the way back to Hogwarts silently, lost in our thoughts. It was a comfortable quiet, on that I sank into until my thoughts turned static. It was rare that I'd get a chance to shut off my brain, so I wasn't going to pass it up.
"You've caught me Weasley. First step; accidentally lifting desks. Next step; world domination." Hermione chuckled.
“Forgive me for trying to be nice before asking something of you, I’m so sorry for having manners!” Draco rose his brow higher. “Fine . The thing is that I’m kind of in charge of organising the booze, but right now I sort of have my karaoke slot, and it’s definitely going to take a while so I was sort of wondering if you would...”
“Don’t try and pull the dull card you’re better than that-“
“Greg and Vince ‘give’ me a headache. They want to see people put their names in the goblet, and they thought I’d care enough to join them far too early on the weekend.”
Those cunning folks use any means
“Just like that?” Greg asked.

"Malfoy?! Out of the way Arthur!" ordered a cold, curt voice. He felt his Stupefy being lifted, but before he could enjoy being able to move, he was dragged upward by his pajama top by none other than a Mr Crouch. Draco froze in fear. "A Malfoy, huh? I don't suppose you know anything about the Dark Mark that appeared here, do you?" Draco grimaced and stayed silent. "DO YOU?!" He was shaken by the shoulders and yelped at the painful grip.
“He’s cute.” Martha whispered to Octavia and they had a giggle. Their giggling stopped as the carriage door opened to reveal the largest women Octavia had ever seen. She’d had to have been a half breed of some kind, there was no natural way for a wizard to grow that tall. She kind of reminded Octavia of Professor Hagrid.
"Precisely! That's why when I'm older, I plan to become Prime Minister!" She announced.
And his scar isn’t even that interesting or cool! Draco has a cooler one on his knee from when he was seven and fell off his broom, but you don’t see anyone running to the Prophet about that, now do you?
guilty. It wasn’t
The rain dribbled down the window of the train, the glass fogging up in the cold. Hermione and Ron sat across from me, Ron having his head in her lap and Hermione having a book in one hand and Ron's hair in the other. I smiled at the domestic air of the scene, albeit a bit disgusted at it at the same time. If Ginny had come back for another year then that could've also been us. I frowned at the reminder that I was once again single and looked back out of the window of the train, losing myself in the constant pitter pattering of raindrops.
, and his hair wasn’t long and flowing. It
“I won’t tell a member of staff as long as I can attend the party.” He poked a bottle Draco was holding. Draco pulled he bottles he could closer to his chest.
After Kreacher let him be, he waited another twenty minutes on the chair to allow the spell to wear off enough. He walked up to his room and immediately crossed towards the dresser. He shakily opened one of the drawers that held his most important books and pulled out the one on healing spells.
"Draco." The letter said in quieter tone, snapping Draco back to attention with the whiplash. "I want you to know how lucky you are. If we had another child, if we had another heir, you would be disowned. If Narcissa wasn't in her state right now, we would have another child, and you'd be living in muggle London on the side of the road with nothing. So count your luck. Trust a boy like you to gain something from your mother's pain." Draco flinched harshly at the repulsion in his voice. "You are just like the traitors from the Black family. I suppose it's good that you're a Ravenclaw instead of a Hufflepuff or a...ugh, Gryffindor. It's shame you took after those in the Black family instead of your Aunt Bella." Draco shivered at the nickname Aunt Bella. His 'Aunt Bella' had been the Dark Lord's right hand, and had gotten pleasure from torturing people.
"What about this?"
"Don't say his name you stupid git!" He hissed, and his hands clenched and Potter's eye roll.
“Yeah, exactly. Because we’re best friends...” Vince looked oddly sad at saying so. And then it hit Draco.
He exited the cart and closed the door behind him. He turned to Draco, and Draco noticed at close proximity that he was taller than Potter. He hid his smirk.
“What?” He spat, mostly confused than anything. Potter shrugged with a small smirk.
So all of them would have to deal with it the old fashion way. With sunglasses, water and mild pain numbing charms. Though you had to be careful with this charm, as if you used it too frequently, it would numb your brain as well.
“It’s a girl. And this-“ he pointed upwards, referencing the music, “is Michael Jackson! AKA me!” He shimmied his shoulders. “Billie Jean- is not my lover! She’s just a gi-irl, who thinks that I- am the one!” He sung out slightly off-key. He continued to dance like a dork while Draco watched. After the song fazed out, another one began, starting with some rhythmic drumming and weird noises. It had really aggressive singing. So of course Blaise loved it.
"Same as usual then?"
“And yet you still said it. A normal child!” She scoffed again. “Notions as such should be punished.” Draco’s eyes widened.
"Better than your mop, Potter. At least my 'glittery blonde hair' was clean."
She was glad that Draco was getting a life away from her, one where he wasn’t constantly trying to meddle, but she needed Pansy and Blaise and Greg and Vince.
