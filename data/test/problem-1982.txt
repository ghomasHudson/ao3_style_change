“Malfoy! That was excellent! Did you see him bleeding? What made you think to strike him physically? Is Potter in trouble for trying to kill you?” Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini were suddenly at his side, bursting with questions.
the name of the ancestral house of Black, but couldn’t quite recall it. He didn’t think he’d been Obliviated recently. Which left one explanation.
be scared. This is a very serious matter that we are entrusting you with.” Draco said in his serious voice. “And…I mean it when I say you should tell no one.
Draco barely dodged it, finding the prospect of bodily harm curiously undaunting as the heavy thing loomed over him for that moment before he stumbled to the side, his robes gusting around him with the whoosh of air as the falling thing slammed into the ground inches from where he knelt.
. Unscrupulous, well that was a given, of course. But the Lord of Malfoy was certainly the most worthy suitor wizarding Britain could hope to offer.
be responsible for bringing three Heirs into the world and raising them to their proper heritage. I assume you wouldn’t want
“Just a few hours, with that potion.” Draco said, not mentioning that the high-powered healing potion he’d bought for this purpose was also Dark, as it required skin flayed from a prepubescent vampire. Usually willingly, actually. A prepubescent vampire might still be over a century old, after all, and vampires as a group had a very different view on pain than humans did.
“It needs no claiming. What is Malfoy, is Malfoy. If I did not respect your continued use of this place while you have need of it, the grounds would have expelled what they viewed an invader from the premises.”
In the doorway was a tall, lanky man with dark greasy hair, wand trained on him and a very dangerous look on his face.
“You arrive at a fortuitous time, Lucius. I look forward to your counsel on the strategies I have put into place to profit our family in the war. I expect you will be impressed by the lofty end I have set.”
Draco snatched up his robe and threw it on before moving to the head-bag and removing the glamour of blood from the outside of it. He brought it over to where Voldemort lay, wheezing for breath, his body blackened and burnt from the exposure to such powerful Love magic.
“Oh, that! Well, that was a Horcrux. What’s left in you isn’t a Horcrux, my boy. It’s a purified soul, so its magic is strengthened by Love, of course. And since little Scorpius was conceived in love, and young Tom here latched onto him so he could have someone to love, well, that’s all the magic he really needed to manifest in solid form. Voldemort never did understand the power of Love, but this new Tom Riddle clearly does. With Love comes the power to heal, the power to create life, and sadly the power to hurt us as well. My poor, poor Gellert, how I miss him so…”
“I’ve no interest in your filthy Muggle nonsense.” Draco cut it off coldly, though in fact the idea of such free and easy shopping interested him quite a bit indeed. Still, he recognized a distraction when he heard it. His mother would be quite happy to investigate the matter of the credit stone at a later date. “I’ve come to move my accounts, and I’ll not be dissuaded so easily.”
“Sorry, ‘Mione just wouldn’t give up on my hair.” Potter gasped, sliding into the seat across from Draco.
“A pig-tail is a cute word for when little girls tie their hair back. Sometimes when a little boy likes a girl, but doesn’t know what to do about it, he expresses it by being mean.” He explained.
Moments later a freshly-sorted Cloud sat himself gracefully on the bench beside Tom amidst polite applause, and the two boys shared a small grin between them as the Welcome Feast began.
“Yes, he is certainly all that Malfoy can hope for in a powerful young scion.” Lucius backtracked carefully. “You have done extremely well for the family, Draco. I would never complain.”
“So long as they’re also specific enough the boy can’t squirm out of telling the truth we need to know.”
“Child. The girl’s been raised by Muggles, basic logic and analyticial thinking have to be impressed from birth.”
“So…you’re telling me there are a whole population of people who are capable of projecting a Gnossic waveform? And that’s where all the mythology of magic comes from. But a Gnossic waveform only has application to a few…”
“Draco. What the hell are you doing?” Harry asked, watching his panicked self-inspection with some bewilderment.
Then he gave one more hard thrust and Draco felt the universe disappear, sound sucked out of the world like a massive Silencio as Harry’s face moved back in slow motion to make eye contact, those big, impossibly green eyes widening as Harry’s body trembled with the force of his orgasm, his length expanding and jerking inside Draco as Harry’s seed and Harry’s magic spewed from his member deep into Draco. Magic exploding around them as they both shuddered and silently screamed their climax.
“I mentioned the wisdom of reuniting the Black blood and title.” Draco said, nodding towards Jamie. “He was very offended at the idea of marrying for any purpose other than personal attraction.”
“Now then, let’s see the damage.” In moments, the old man reversed the warding on the door and ushered Professor Snape inside.
“I haven’t made any conclusions. I’ve just noted the fact that he hasn’t bothered with a very basic obligation on every blooded Heir to reproduce.”
And the Hufflepuffs…Draco forced himself to look at that table, because it wasn’t wise to blind oneself even to distasteful sights, but quickly turned away in horror. The Hufflepuffs were…

“Well, very well then, let’s just be off then.” Molly said, eyes narrowed in suspicion at the subtle retreat. “I won’t have any of your silly notions of-”
tool for a prefect, if anything! Why, if Draco had had the use of such a device back in his Hogwarts days he could have single-handedly put an end to all those late-night wanderers and troublemakers that seemed to trouble the student population so.)
“Potter, what sort of potions-making do these Muggles use for their shampoos?” Draco asked urgently, “I thought Muggles couldn’t do potions! They never even managed to make the most basic age-regression potions because they couldn’t work with the magical properties of-”
Regulus frowned consideringly. He supposed it wouldn’t hurt for Longbottom to tag along from time to time. Longbottom probably couldn’t keep up with the twins, but he might fit in as a sort of stooge and a willing target for their pranks.
“In light of your vows, by the powers vested in me, I pronounce you husband, and husband. You may now kiss as a token of your sealed union before all these witnesses.”
“Is there somewhere…less crowded, that we could do that?” Draco asked. He was starting to feel the weight of the combined Weasley glares, not to mention the room was dreadfully claustrophobic.
The itch was only the superficial symptom. The Occlumens could, within his own mind, see how the connection between the stained flesh and his magical core had reactivated. Only a week ago it had been a mere sliver of a thread, its many roots retracted, starved into withering once the Dark Lord no longer used it to siphon magic. Such a transfer had not yet resumed, but that thread was sending out tendrils, once again seeking out those connections.
“Even the Weasleys have still managed to remain pure. Though they do tend to take on new blood directly instead of waiting a generation, they’re not
“Yes, options. I expect I’ll be getting what I want in the next week.” Draco said, with a smug look affixing itself to his own face.
surprised when, upon linking to Godric Gryffindor, a gold inheritance line started trickling its way down until it connected with Potter’s portrait, and a look at the symbol supplied him with it’s proper name.
And, it was furthermore quite odd that Potter, who expressed at every turn his disdain for the importance of blood-connections, would be so strongly affected by such a tenuous familial relationship to Draco, whom he personally disliked, that he would reduce himself to
“Draco?” Potter asked, unbelieviningly, his eyes staring up at Draco with complete betrayal in them.
Tom repressed a grin. Harry had counseled him and James about the wizarding world’s instinctive terror of Parselmouths. James had bragged that he wouldn’t stand for coddling a bunch of scaredy-cats, but Tom intended to
“You would think it very old fashioned, I am sure. In the last few hours I have had to adjust to much – we still use gold as a currency, owls as letter carriers, quills to write with, and our government structure is most analogous to your House of Lords, which I understand is largely considered an anachronism. I saw an automobile at close range for the first time only this morning, and I will confess it to be a most terrifying encounter. At the same time, we have amenities that would equally shock you. I mentioned apparition, we also have a network of portals for live communication or transport that operates in our fireplaces. The popular sport is Quidditch, which I have been told is a very fast, three dimensional version of rugby that is played on flying broomsticks – quite dangerous by your standards. But, nearly any injury that is not instantly fatal can be entirely fixed within hours by a competent Healer.”
Nevertheless, he easily moved with Potter, letting the slight flexing of Potter’s hips under his muscles guide his own movements so that they stayed together. Potter was breathing rather quickly, considering the sedate pace they were taking.
“And at Godrics Hollow, too.” Draco reminded him, tightening the hug a bit, still murmering into the shell of his ear. “And you won, every time. Lucius has always spoken of you with disdain, because a Malfoy should never admit to intimidation. Things are different now.”
“Oh! I recognize this phrase! It’s Heirloom, Magic, Blood! Harry, that’s the most prestigious wizarding courtship ritual in existence, it’s strictly for royalty!” Hermione gasped.
“I…well, this is all my life, so I will not claim to understand your upset. But…I have seen my view of the world turned upside down before. Twice. I can sympathize. I will wait, and answer whatever questions you have for me.”
“Well…yes, I’ve always thought so. The difference between what most of the students here do and what Professor Snape does is that they’re just following directions, while he
There was a light scuffing sound, like a shoe being scraped uncertainly against a stone floor, and then the door opened the rest of the way…a gasp as the boy obviously caught sight of the distractingly beautiful setting at the Head Table.
“Potter did not die from the Curse, due to some ancient protection I don’t understand, and neither did you, because you are powerful enough to be immortal. As a result, your souls remain connected – you will have passed all your magical inheritances on to him as your heir, through his soul, as most of us receive this through our blood. Potter
Draco suddenly felt foolish standing there next to the sitting boy. He walked back and resumed his own seat.
His godfather raised an eyebrow and opened the door wider to let Draco in. He took his time composing himself in the straight-backed chair.
The scar appeared briefly, exaggerated and incredibly ugly. The glasses were suddenly huge and clunky on his face. And…there was a strange visible energy sizzling around him, making him look…freakish. Draco reached out towards the picture and…a lightning bolt flashed out, searing pain registering in Draco’s senses as a small bit of skin on his hand was actually burnt to ash.
Draco stopped pounding the fallen bureau and huddled on the floor, another low moan of anguish escaping his lips.
which are ever so much more powerful! If a similar breakthrough in magical properties could be achieved-”
The icon, when Draco had stared at it, had flooded him with feelings: desperate longing, mixed with bitterness and pain and, yes, self-
“Oh! Cloud I apologize, I hadn’t intended to monopolize your new friend.” Mr. Zabini agreed, placing a hand on Cloud’s shoulder. “Do well and make me even prouder, son. I’ll be looking forward to break.”
“I…I would like to go to Hogwarts.” He looked over at Scorpius, who was burbling happily at magical fireflies that kept evading his grasp. “But I don’t think I can be too far from Scorpius.”
Draco had partially chosen the Sceptre as a message to the headmaster. The Crystal Sceptre was, as he had told Potter, originally created to serve the Light. A long-ago Malfoy had slaughtered an entire temple full of Light priests in order to obtain it, and twisted it to possibly the most vile purpose imaginable.
you did.” Moody sneered, and with a quick word had slashed his sleeve from his robes…taking a bit of his skin with it. Draco gasped and cradled his bleeding arm. The Aurors had seen the unmarked skin, however.
Harry gave a small, slightly embarrassed wave and quirked a crooked grin at the students. Then…there was uproar.
Harry was looking at him now, and Draco felt the pain and distrust in them stabbing into him more painfully than he’d ever imagined.
"That's not enough." Scrimgeour interjected. "The boy is a known Dark Wizard and the son of You-Know-Who's right hand man. He should be in custody."
our blood with his contaminated blood? And Gryffindor? Have you any idea what would happen to our line if our descendants were influenced by the Gryffindor magic?” Lucius spat.
In the basement, the two faced off and cast at the same time. As Voldemort’s wand rewound through its long history of murders, Harry was almost disappointed that his parents and Cedric Diggory were missing from the litany.
The old man reached for his wand with incredible swiftness, and cast a very forceful Expelliarmus at them, only to see a few sparks emit from his wand.
His breath condensed like a heavy fog above the luminescent liquid, and Draco staggered backwards, his lungs burning.
Potter hesitated only a second before stepping swiftly to his right, Draco’s left, pivoting clockwise. Draco moved smoothly with him so that their fields of vision were perfectly aligned in opposite directions during the entire move, barely an inch of space coming between their bodies during the entire procedure.
“I think it had something to do with becoming immortal. I…I guess I used to be part of him.” He said slowly.
Lord Voldemort was…very, very powerful. And paranoid on top of it. The number and complexity of the protection and countering charms and various other assorted magical preparations outstripped even Dumbledore’s.
With some difficulty he continued to swirl the wine in his mouth until he had his throat muscles under control, then swallowed. Then he answered calmly.
“True, but if I recall James avoided attempts to give jewelry until Lily had agreed to escort him on a date to Hogsmeade, at which point he gave her a small jade comb. I think you should avoid jewelry for now. The rose seems a powerful enough symbol. The meaning behind the intent should be expressed separately, however. Through smaller, practical and most importantly
“Fuck. That’s not all.” Draco said. “The second explosion hasn’t gone off yet. If they’re inside, wait, what are you doing?”
“His mood? Oh! I mean, I don’t see why you think Harry’d be attracted to you, since you’re a boy. He’s shown no sign of being…homosexual.” Granger said. “Are…are you saying you’re going to defy your father, and not be a Death Eater?”
The two barristers looked at each other fearfully. Clearly, wondering which side of the war they were on outside this office. The binding spell segregated their thoughts, they could only consider the matter of Malfoy, or of their own lives, but not at the same moment and never in reference to each other.
subtle at all, you know. I smelled it the second I got under that Invisibility Cloak with you. What are you wearing?”
“Narcissa. Exquisite as always. Yes, that would be most welcome.” Professor Snape gave a slight bow of the head to the lady of the house, then cast a rather sullen look in Draco’s direction.
“That they did, and the both of them are still unable to live without the other. In any case, you’re not your uncles.”
“Virginity is serious business for magical bonds. Very valuable. Chastity spells were invented for situations where the arranged suitors become so infatuated that they become rebellious. Punishing them with a day’s separation gives incentive to keep to the boundaries the next time.”
Draco considered the phrase. After seeing in the scroll how Potter agonized over the pains of his friends, he knew the Sceptre was the perfect gift for the Gryffindor.
“And wasn’t he?” Draco said conversationally. “I wouldn’t know, I wasn’t present when he got himself killed. Potter?”
“I can apparate from here to my home in the blink of an eye. I can transfigure this piece of nickel into a statue of silver. If one of your colleagues takes this revelation badly I’m sure Aurors are waiting to stun them and erase their memory. Anything you can imagine can likely be accomplished, with the right spell."
“Uh…they argue sometimes. And when Harry gets mad the air starts crackling and sometimes there’s wind and spontaneous levitation. I haven’t seen them hex each other or do any…you know, sex stuff.” Tom made a face.
Draco moved down farther and rested his face on the soft bulge that was Harry’s manhood resting between his legs.
“Now don’t be upset, young man. Many a set of twins has gone through these halls and not too many have ended up in the same house together.”
“There are all sorts of magic, young Tom. I could have done the same with a candle and some string. Mind you, that would be more difficult – the wand on the bottom would have to be tied in exactly the opposite way. Magic is a complicated thing. It can work through puns and word choice in Transfiguration, it can make the imagination into reality in Illusion and Occulmency, it can do incredible things when motivated by strong emotions as I’m sure you’ve been told by Harry and Draco here, it can take advantage of tricks of perception like I’ve shown you here. And of course there is also physical magic like you will learn in Potions – and which I often use to make wands. A well-rounded wizard is a powerful wizard, remember that and keep your mind open.”
This was no place for a baby. Wherever the train would go, perhaps there would at least be food there.
a Slytherin. But we can establish some basic level of trust necessary to complete our negotiations and…enable the bond.” He whispered the last part.
Draco held his breath as the door to the Great Hall slowly creaked open, the entry appearing to be empty.
“Bad?” Draco said sharply. She cringed, and Draco had to soften his voice. “Merlin, no! Jamie. ‘The Ancient and Noble House of Black’. Jamie, you are like wizarding royalty.”
The world shrunk around Draco and he looked over to meet green eyes, Harry also fully restored next to him.
“This will be our home away from home. The place we go when the children are visiting their grandparents, or at school. This is our own little love nest away from it all. Welcome to Mount Erised, Harry.”
“Go ahead and write the Headmaster, then.” He turned to the three boys. “You two, try to keep out of trouble for a few hours.” He dismissed the young heirs with a wave, then considered Tom.
Bellatrix giggled from somewhere behind Draco and he cast an irritated glance at her, then a blurring charm at Potter’s genitals. He’d be damned if the Death Eaters were going to ogle what was his.
Blaise handed the paper to Draco, who took another bite of his toast before glancing at the headline.
“Well no, it wouldn’t be. The Ministry took her at birth, Sirius never even knew of her. She showed up at Hogwarts to be sorted this Fall. I have, of course, begun teaching her proper pureblood culture, which she has been denied by her upbringing.”
…well, Rita didn’t know it was him she was talking about, of course. But he still bristled at the ludicrous implication that he might be
Lysander didn’t seem to mind that Regulus was still holding his, or her, hand – but grimaced at the question, folding to sit Indian style at Regulus’ feet as if it was the most natural thing in the world, and continued chattering in that bizarre style.
He followed Dumbledore, Potter, and Ron out of the Room of Requirement, then then down several staircases, but snagged Potter’s arm before he could head towards Gryffindor Tower.
“Ever the thirst for knowledge, eh, Tom? I suppose some things will never change! Hopefully this time you’ll bend your considerable talents to better goals, I hope?”
each other. He said every year Draco would spend all his free time coming up with ways to ruin Potter, they’d hex at each other in the halls and once they got so mad they were trying to kill each other
Draco sighed, feeling inexplicably guilty for taking advantage of Potter’s state to finish the spell…perhaps it would have been more sporting to do it from behind when Potter was in his right mind. Oh well. Time to set Potter to rights before those innocent eyes accused him any more.
“I will try to give you the muggle fantasies you’ve grown up with. Mixed with the proper wizarding protocols, of course.” Draco sniffed. “All
“I guess combinations are the only real way to fight anybody who knows anything.” Harry said slowly.
“A doubled wand. Very unusual. I’ve never actually seen it for myself.” He reached for both wands and laid them side-by-side.
Carefully, he snaked his arms around the fragile bundle, lifting it up and cradling it gently against his own thin chest.
All things that they would lose the ability to do, once they got their wand, and then after many years of study, learn again to do intentionally, on a more focused scale.
His voice was on edge, his entire body tensed and straining in anticipation of where Draco’s lips would touch next.
Ron was beet red at this point, and several of the Gryffindors were now poking each other and giggling over both having a pet Fuzzywuggum at the age of five,
Not quite fast enough, Draco noted. The green jet of the curse from Potter’s wand was halfway to Draco already.
“I’m her nearest living male relative,” Draco reminded him. “so you’ll be mostly dealing with her through me.”
Sniffing at their clumsy attempts at self-punishment, the Lord Draco Malfoy mounted the grand stairs, the massive double-doors swinging wide before him as he entered his domain.
James looked at his brother, puzzled, but Regulus only shrugged, already immune to Lysander’s random left turns.
am doing, but not the content of either side of our negotiation. We’ll phrase the Vow to keep it that way.” Draco said smoothly.
“You lead the way, Potter.” Draco whispered at the back of his neck…this time allowing his lips to graze against the skin, enjoying how that made the powerful wizard in his arms shiver with desire. A strange static energy was surging up Draco’s arms from where his hands contacted Potter’s hips…a powerful
“Harry?” The Weasley could clearly see Potter on the floor in the washroom. “What did you do to him, ferret!”
Potter’s hand suddenly covered his mouth, Potter’s face turned towards something coming up the corridor. Draco turned his head to look, ignoring the fact that Potter’s hand had tracked the movement.
Draco suddenly had an image of himself lying in wait for Harry Potter, grabbing hold of his robes and yanking him back behind a random statue, those green eyes widening with shock as Draco plunged his tongue into the Gryffindor’s mouth…
Draco entered a…well…a library. Of sorts. In place of bookshelves, the walls were lined with a latticework of pigeon holes, stacked closely together from floor to ceiling. Draco could see that each hole contained a scroll, and bore a label inscribed on small plates of either brightly polished silver, a tarnished bronze, or a very utilitarian-looking steel.
Harry suddenly seemed to notice the entire Hall was looking at him and blushed crimson, turning his attention to his plate. In moments, the Ravenclaws resumed their debates, the Gryffindors their boasting, and the Hufflepuffs their…cooing.
“You know as well as I, Potter will never be punished for what happens during a Quidditch game. And you
But the level of simple magical strength was likewise staggering. And this with a magical inheritance only from his mother. Harry, with his Potter father, his Mudblood mother, and the Dark Lord as a third magical benefactor, would far outstrip even this glowing assessment.
“And are you not a passable Occlumens, to go before him with the family secrets in your mind all these years?”
So Draco was reviewing the facts about Potter as he knew them, looking for some possible way that this Potter could somehow be feeling love for a Malfoy.
Harry! This receptacle has been in my family for centuries.” Draco cautioned him when it looked like the Gryffindor was going to take a flying leap over the side.
“And the father called Harry ssssaw you, and ssssayssss you look like a memory of the evil wizard when he was in an orphanage at your age.”
The blood plant continued growing, splitting in two and then joining together to form a wreath, and then again inside that to form a shield, and then one tendril wound itself inside the shield to carefully depict a coiled snake…gasps sounded all around as the plant soon clearly depicted the Slytherin Crest.
“I’ll be honest, Tom. I don’t know. The other Horcrux that manifested like you, did so by sucking the life out of my friend Ginny. I don’t think you want to do that to Scorpius.” Harry said.
“Well. Magic is more or less loose energy unless it’s focused. That’s what the wand core does. There are examples of wizards and witches so immensely powerful that they themselves could be classified as a magical creature. Then, their own bones could replace the function of a wand core. Still very imprecise, you understand. Not nearly as good as a real wand. The Headmaster has done so, on a few occasions.”
Draco congratulated himself on stunning the normally irrepressible witch to silence twice in ten minutes.
The Common Room was abuzz with plotting Slytherins. From first year to seventh, every one of them was in that house because they were natural schemers with a flair for the intricacies of the higher branches of wizarding politics – not the public politics of who was running for Minister, but the more subtle intricacies of who was indebted to whom. Or allied with, influenced by, held influence over, was related to, in feud against, or as in this case, negotiating with…
On a more fun note, WWW products had been added to their trunks by Harry, then removed by Draco, then different products replaced there by Draco and removed by Harry to be replaced by still others which were surreptitiously removed by Draco…until eventually a negotiated settlement of assorted pranks had been ceremonially placed into the trunk by both parents and warded with alarms to prevent future tampering by either. Draco and Harry had then each (on separate occasions) quietly slipped other products into robe pockets with a quiet word not to tell the other. The three youngsters had, of course, agreed.
“Very good Weasley. Now. I came to find you so we could arrange a meeting to negotiate the exchange.”
Harry led the way to a deserted classroom and locked them in with an assortment of anti-eavesdropping charms that made Draco raise his eyebrows.
“Fine then. But don’t think I’m going to sit around and wait for Dumbledore’s timetable. I have plans of my own and
“The Lord Harry Potter is being courted by none other than…” Draco paused dramatically, “The Lord Draco Malfoy.”
Draco felt the stinging of a cleansing charm on his hands before a steaming bowl of stew was smacked down onto the table before him, sloshing over the side a bit.
Harry just looked at him closely for a moment, eyes clear and penetrating behind those spectacles, then nodded. Just…nodded.
“Then listen, Potter. There’s a reason for rituals like this. For blood-soaked royal marriages. Power like yours wants to be used. Until you are very old you will never have complete control over it. And anyone who is not of similar power cannot even see the effects of your power, let alone counter it. And when they get close to you, they will come under your influence, and find themselves acting out your wishes.”
“Oh, they abandoned those kinds of things.” Potter said. “They have a completely different branch of potions, using the natural, non-magical properties of ingredients. Hermione says that their understanding of the subject is far more advanced than the magical worlds’ except that they’re just ignorant about the magical part of things. Uh…actually…when you were talking about all the reactions and…stuff…this morning, you reminded me of her lectures.”
father since that inheritance is through the soul rather than through blood. After our marriage, the future Malfoy line will benefit from the combined gifts of the two most powerful Founders, never before combined. The Potter line will benefit from the refinement of our blood, which should calm some of the wild magic they are prone to, and the Black line will have the benefit of both.”
contracts preventing you from discussing any of your work here with anyone who isn’t similarly bound. The prefects will check off your name once you’ve signed and you’ll be clear to continue orientation, so please be quick and efficient about it. Thank you.”
“At the same time, you should consider the, perhaps irreversible, effect of your relations with the boy thus far. Such an immensely powerful wizard is not an enemy one should permit to develop.” Severus backtracked smoothly.
Draco nodded shortly and followed the Headmaster to his office, feeling Moody’s strange eye on him the whole while.
of course – give them enough information so that both their separate strategies would end up mutually beneficial if so inclined, but not enough to invite betrayal if they ended up on opposing sides.
“He said all of that, and I said, “I swear, as soon Malfoy is represented in my generation, I will challenge them to a duel and reap equivalent payment.”
“Very. She was the one who reminded me of…um…how much I liked you when we met in Madame Malkins, you know.” Draco said.
Under “Ritual Gifts” were “Flowers, (roses appear to be the most common)”, “Chocolate candies (apparently there is a ritually significant packaging that is highly important), “Jewelry (a pattern appears to progress from non-wearable artifacts, to earings or necklaces, with the most advanced such item being a locket, and finally a ring, which is symbolic of the actual marriage proposal).
…and then Harry was on him, rough fingers clutching around Draco’s waist and pulling him forward and Draco felt the silky heat of Harry’s penis pressing into the crease between thigh and groin and his own painful erection was rubbing against Harry’s soft, soft skin as the raw energy burned and burned and
the best way to deal with humiliation, and Draco had to quite agree. But first, he’d get what he came for.
HAVE TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU HAD BETTER BE WASHING BEHIND YOUR EARS AND YOUR ARMPITS AS WELL, EVERY NIGHT, RONALD WEASLEY!
Feeling suddenly sick with dread, Lucius quickly excused himself and strode quickly into a restroom.
“Hmm, yes you do…until a moment ago you could have easily gone to Ravenclaw, but I think now that you have felt threatened you can only be…SLYTHERIN!”
“Lord Voldemort, I think the time for the marriage is drawing near. We should make appropriate plans.”
The bulge stirred, pressing back against Draco’s cheekbone as he rubbed his face against the crotch of Harry’s pajama pants.
“No you don’t. I’m dead tired and should see my godfather about my wand-hand, so keep yours to yourself, pervert.”
!” Draco hissed sharply. “And stupid ideas like that are exactly why your kind will never understand
Draco reached forward and gently, carefully, put his hand under Potter’s chin. Tears wetting his palm as he softly stroked his cheek with his fingers.
“Your Weasley twins. They sell plenty of proximity-triggered hexes, now that I’m a friend of the family it was easy to have a combination made to order.”
“Shut up boy. You’re not going to have your little slick-tongued barrister here to talk you out of this.” Moody growled.
Draco started. He had been very careful, covering his tracks, sneering at all the right times, even staging altercations in the hallways to keep the rumor mill churning with news of who had hexed who.
ingredients together the way we do in potions, and only had limited success until they broke them down into their elements, and then they started creating
“You’re fucking insane! You could have killed me you stupid crazy Gryffindor!” Draco heard himself screaming as he grabbed Potter around the throat and slammed his head into the grass.
In under a second, James was by his side, watching the door. The soft glow under the crack was false moonlight – real enough to give the room beyond a soothing nocturnal illumination but not real enough to give his namesake any trouble.
The goblin wrung its hands woefully. The Malfoy accounts were a significant bulk of the Gringotts holdings, and the strength of the goblins form of magic was connected somehow to the extent of the riches squirreled away in their vaults.
Draco watched fascinated as vines began to grow upwards from Potter’s portrait. Noted with interest Potter’s inheritance of an Invisibility Cloak and something called the Marauder’s Map, which was also linked to the Black coat of arms, as well as the printed names Lupin and Pettigrew.
of this family now, father. And much wiser to recognize that I would never make nice with Potter if it were not a benefit to our family!”
Handing a lemon drop to the boy, and popping a second into his own mouth, Dumbledore puckered his mouth at the sour taste as he explained.
Draco felt himself suddenly rock hard under his robes, and tried vainly to buck up to press it against Harry’s heat above him.
The resentful awe would take time to transmute to genuine respect, but he could work with it for now.
The Headmaster’s eyes narrowed carefully for a moment, assessing him before the eyes twinkled knowingly.
Of course. Most of the castle would assume Draco was still off engaging in nefarious plots with Lucius, it was a perfect time for pinning down the finer details of the contract.
Lucius nodded in realization. Once again, his old instincts to raise the wards and strike down any threat were proven to be the lesser of his ambitious son’s genius for co-opting the opposition.
such plans had succeeded. Evil laughter, or any of the other popular variants, such as dancing upon tombstones, taking out large loans for purchases whose payment depended on the success of the scheme, or, Merlin forbid, actually
if we were separated, and couldn’t survive each other’s death! Like the most profound soulmates, where we can’t survive without each other.” Harry said dreamily.
Mr. Weasley was silent for a long time, apparently listening to quite a speech from the other phantom.
Draco moved forward again, ghosting the tip of his nose at Potter’s balls, up the length of his now very excited manhood, until his lips hovered just over the end of it, magic crackling dangerously between their skin.
The young man’s eyes jerked to meet hers at that, startled awareness showing in them before they swiftly pinned themselves back to the other boy, some nameless struggle behind them as he watched his friend’s carefree behavior.
“This is another wizarding courtship tradition, that is used when the parties negotiating a marriage contract both happen to be Lords of their bloodlines. Extremely rare, of course, I found it in a very obscure volume in the family library.”
“Massster Jamesss and his nessstmate Regulussss are like two ssssnakesss with only one head.” The Dreamer said.
These were knotwork charms, set in every single twine of yarn around another…not at all a standard weave, Draco realized. The entire structure of the thing was a masterpiece of knotwork magic, Molly Weasley must have used a knotwork-hook extension for her wand and knitted
“Of course not. But the nature of this task will give you a strong hint, before the fact, that I am courting Potter. And even outside this room you would know that Malfoys are always very clever about choosing the winning side.”
“Tempurature raised by…uh…fourteen degrees Celsius, the waveform would disperse when no longer in contact with the nitrogen. Oh holy Jesus.”
Tom studied the boy, it was a dangerous situation for a father, however bitter, to put his only heir in.
“What you said at Grimmauld reminded me…and…I should have held firm. I…I shouldn’t have given in to your Muggle romanticism.
Mrs. Weasley somehow had the spoon in her hand again, and gestured with it right under Draco’s nose. Damn her. Draco’s mouth started watering again.
“Yeah, Father is like that with people while he’s married. Once I tried to tell him it’s gross to stick his tongue in someone else’s mouth, but then he started telling me all these other horrible
Potter. Perhaps the memory was from last year. But then that brought up another problem. Jaimie only just showed up scant months ago, which meant at the time of utterance, Potter had only known that he was
Thomas Marvelo Riddle, an aging but nonetheless handsome wizard, stood on a pedestal with his advisors clustered around him. Draco noticed Lucius at his right hand. The members of the Wizengamut, and a throng of people stood below the pedestal listening eagerly to whatever he was saying.
Potter stood atop the same hill, but there was no Voldemort’s body, or any others. Only a quaint little cottage. And, stepping out of the cottage door was none other than Draco, sneaking up behind Potter, covering his eyes from behind and whispering in his ear, Potter turning around in his arms and they were kissing-”
“Um…there’s a wand above the water and only one wand in the water…that doesn’t make sense…what happened to the mirror?”
Three months later, a very tired Harry Potter-Malfoy closed his eyes and let his husband apparate them to the place Draco had prepared for them to spend the last few weeks of summer together.
Dumbledore recoiled backwards, his chair rocking with the impact. Draco noted his eyes were suddenly bloodshot.
“Did you think my father would let me get away without a repertoire of handy quotes to impress adults with?” Cloud smirked.
environment! I realize the two of you are quite full of hormones at this point, but I’ll have to insist you go somewhere else to satisfy your adolescent urges!”
“Yeah but he’s your brother, you didn’t get to pick him, you just got born with him. So he’s different from a
He’d first seemed interested on Draco’s reference to Harry as his heir, but did that count as being truly “pleased”? Draco didn’t think so. He’d been somewhat angry that Lucius and the others hadn’t noticed that fact, but not one of the towering rages Draco had heard whispers about.
Draco ground his teeth. He knew very well the Lord Lucius Malfoy and his father were two very different people. Nobody else, except perhaps his mother, was likely to agree with him on that, though.
The other boys leaned in, holding their breath as James paused his narration for dramatic effect, looking them each deep in the eyes, one at a time as they waited for what would happen next. And…waited…
Regulus felt as a harsh blow the moment when his brother bowed to the inevitable, his regretful eyes slowly turning away from their mournful contact, and directing themselves at a housemate who asked him some stupid childish question.
“Now science has caught up to that discredited set of theories, as most of you know. We know that reality is not based on the obvious mechanisms of Newtonian physics but is subject to forces that are both subtle and powerful in their application. We named this college Merlin’s College because what you will be doing, ladies and gentlemen, is no less than what the average person would describe as pure magic! This very cutting-edge of technology has proven that there
“I hope so. He will need your guidance, too, Severus.” Draco told his godfather, who nodded in acceptance.
, breeding. Breeding is like the difference between wild magic and having a wand and spells. Over generations, magical traits are reinforced, made stronger, and the ancestral stores of magic are added to with each new magical birth, until they form a reservoir of magic that is unique and intelligent and
His father looked up at him, some resentment still in his eyes. The man’s emotional shields were paper-thin, Draco saw, and decided to give him the dignity of
“Romancing Real Life”...looked like a possibility at first, but quickly turned out to be a guide for maintaining the marital relationship during the hubbub of grinding daily life as a muggle, which Draco and Potter would most certainly not be dealing with
in public, Potter! All the teachers have noticed, didn’t you know? It’s only a matter of time before the rumors start. Potter,
“But it has the advantage of using unpurified elements, since any element that isn’t part of the base-six-plus-two framework won’t be reactive.”
Draco had taken it literally, as a precaution against allowing Potter to grow powerful enough to eventually take revenge for years of antagonism. But now the phrase had a backhanded double-meaning.
“They have really long hairy arms and their pillows are really big and hard!” Frankie informed him, gravely.
As if to prove his point, there was suddenly a much louder explosion, much nearer, and the teachers could be heard chanting counterspells and curses in return.
Draco smirked, pulling the little bundle out and doing a quick scourgify to remove the offending substance.
“I didn’t say anything, but he just called me in, told me that his password was “Twizzlers”, and then offered me some.”
Draco leaned down, his words urgent. He knew his husband was humoring him for now, but it was only a matter of time before Harry’s innate Gryffindor-ness inspired him to be horrified at the insidious seeds of self-preservation Draco was planting in their youngest son.
Lucius Malfoy approached the younger witch with his most purposeful stride, carefully hiding the completely inappropriate pangs of hesitance that pricked awkwardly at the edges of his psyche.
“Draco…you just bumped the on-button for that old vacuum cleaner. If you don’t want to fool around here, I know this part of the house is creepy. I guess I’ve gotten used to it-”
“Well. We can certainly have a snog. Probably should do it in front of someone so they can interrupt us if it get’s too heated.”
“I will admit such an optimistic theory bears investigation, however I cannot say it sets my mind at ease.” Severus complained. “How would we test such a thing?”
there are things I still can’t speak of. Not even to you. Not because I wouldn’t want to but because they aren’t my secrets to tell.”
“Well here, I’m sorry for scaring you, maybe you could give Phillip some nice reptile treats on me.”
“Well. Yes. If it works, if it’s profitable, of course.” Draco said shortly. “And further…I think you would be the ideal witch to head up the team.”
And…yes…there were red-heads everywhere. Beyond the Weasley matriarch, the two fearsome twins who had pounced on Draco moments after he landed outside the fireplace were standing on either side of him, cracking their knuckles ominously. The dragon-handling Weasley was perched on the counter…
“Excuse me? You mean…wait…are you trying to say that they have to practice ‘safe-sex’?” Granger asked incredulously.
Draco sighed again. After twelve years of Muggle indoctrination, there was only so much he could do in the time he’d had.
“Well. I guess most of that’s true. Their main activity is usually pranks, and they do get into trouble a lot. The current set of Marauders does some other things though. In first year we prevented Voldemort from getting his hands on the Philosopher’s Stone.”
James wasn’t there, he was in Hufflepuff, making new friends, making people faint with his casual brandishing of Hissyfit and slipping easily in and out of Parseltongue, and then making them immediately forgive them with his big smile and easygoing ways.
is it? Well, I suppose he is unfortunately named Heir. And being courted by my grand-nephew, how bizarre. Be careful with that one, my dear. He is still a Potter and a Gryffindor and marked for death by the Dark Lord, as soon as he can produce an Heir for our line.”
“And do you also swear that you will never use the content or implications following from the memories provided to you by Severus Snape in any strategy or tactic in the war, on behalf of or to the detriment of either side, or of any member of either side, except with the full approval of Severus Snape?”
Draco was suddenly quite unsure how to go about asking her something like this. Finally he decided to be completely bold. She couldn’t tell anyone anything, after all.
“I didn’t come here to discuss Potter’s attributes, Granger!” Draco snapped. Perhaps a bit defensively.
Harry’s mouth opened and closed a few times, before he moved his hand into Draco’s free hand, nodding furiously.
Satisfied with the fate of the two Gryffindors, Draco began chanting the ritual that would cleanse the core of his wand in anticipation of the next ritual he would need to perform that night.
Draco signed his name with a flourish, then placed the parchment in an envelope and sealed it with his ring. A quick charm insured anyone besides Potter who tried to break the seal would die painfully, then he handed it to Goyle.
The teasing look on the Gryffindor’s face died away instantly and Draco felt a spark of that lustful magic snapping at his hand.
Draco found that his own hands had been busy with Harry’s robe, and they were both somehow naked, Harry poised to enter him, the blunt end of his manhood pressing impatiently at his opening and the dribbling liquid burning like fire where it dripped on his thigh.
“Ah ha!” Harry called out from the doorway. Draco turned to look and felt something warm stirring between his legs as he took in Harry’s naked torso stretching up out of the narrow waist of his pajama pants.
But that low ranking irritated Draco to no end. Still, at least he was more important an enemy than Severus Snape.
Then Draco’s vision was dimming as he slumped to his knees, registering that Harry’s face was so close and sweet up close as he was grasped by the shoulders, panicked voices raised as he slipped into unconsciousness.
Draco groaned in frustration. His fiancé was completely oblivious to some of the more dangerous parts of magic that didn’t involve a quick A.K.
Suppressing a snort, Draco took their distraction as the opportunity he needed. Placing a hand on the scroll in his pocket, he held his wand carefully in his lap, pointed at Potter under the table.
“Take it, Harry! For Merlin’s sake, take the thing so it’ll shut up!” Weasley begged, his face crimson.
“Which in this case, would release an unusually potent alihotsy-scarab bomb. Which would have been prevented from exploding properly for quite a while, due to the thickness of the Glumbumble coating. And would therefore have continued to meld with the
“Come back…please? It’s not when we’re like this. Just when we’re sexual. And I like it, anyways. It’s like this massive flood of power barely holding itself back from consuming me.”
“You’re a good wizard, Headmaster. But you’ve got too soft a heart. First Riddle, this one’s just the same kind. Black a wizard as they come, and if he isn’t a Death Eater now he’ll be one later, that I’ll promise you.”
again! Where should she be then? Where else would she have met the youngest Weasley? Mudbloods have to be controlled and their magic reclaimed into the proper bloodlines or we’ll all die out, Daphne. It’s one of those distasteful things you just have to endure.” Blaise said, annoyed.
Then the traditional message in the hand of the current Lord of the Suitor Family, identifying the gift as a family heirloom and an offer of alliance between the families.
The small crowd of Slytherins stared from Tom to the bloody plant growing from Ignatius Flint’s hand with a strange assortment of resentful awe and stunned disbelief.
But what to do about it? The parents clearly hadn’t been thrilled to learn of their son’s protector. The two little thugs who’d woken the child had been downright hostile, in fact.
The odd thing was, it was true. The supposed savior of the wizarding world smelled of stale sweat. Draco’s eyes narrowed, taking in his rival. Harry Potter looked…neat and clean and entirely un-Potter.
“Good. I want you to go lock yourself into your dorm room. There will be some violence before the bonding and you will not be involved. Understand?”
“Very well. I am sure he intends to continue your training as schedules permit. I hope you will also take advantage of your House mates for the same purpose. As the newly revealed heir of Slytherin
“I’m telling you Ron, that’s despicable! How could you even contemplate something like that? It’s almost like a bond of slavery!”
“Thank you, but I’ve already found my brother. As long as those others don’t disturb his rest, I want nothing to do with them.” Tom said politely.
In smaller script, most of the Slytherins were listed, along with a long collection of random wizards and witches Draco didn’t know, obviously the ones who didn’t like Potter and made it known to him, but didn’t much matter.
Draco pondered, wondering whether he had it in him to speak a death sentence in the Dark Lord’s ear.
“You are…wiser than me, I think, Draco. I am glad that I have at least this to boast of as I catalogue my debts.” He told his son.
“Draco, I’m a little concerned about his son and Thomas. This little ‘family hobby’ of the Zabini’s is not healthy for those close to them.”
“The ritual is powered by a wizard’s blood, breath, tears, flesh, bile, and seed. My hand…was the flesh.”
The water was still quiet, Potter’s hand was still only lightly caressing himself, and Draco felt a sudden need to be a part of what was happening.
Draco hesitated, then touched the symbol. The dancing portrait shrunk considerably, leaving room for a dizzying array of glowing lines encircling the portrait.
It was quite clear that Draco’s second suggestion at dinner at been better received than Potter had let on. Quite Slytherin of Potter, actually, to let Draco think he was rejecting the idea of a marriage alliance out of hand. If he hadn’t finished the scroll, Draco would likely have continued to make better and better offers, eventually offering himself as a desperate alternative to avoid having to offer his own mother, since Jaimie was apparently unacceptable due to her age. And half the Malfoy fortune as a dowry, no doubt.
That caught Draco’s attention, and he found himself gazing at the giggling Hufflepuffs speculatively. Perhaps their orgies
Draco sat back. The message was clear that as Lord he was demanding Lucius withdraw his loyalty to the Dark Lord. And of course, Lucius had no choice. Not unless he would disown himself from the family entirely. And Draco knew his father well enough to know that Lucius was first a Malfoy, and a Death Eater as a far distant second.
In the center of the room was a single table, upon which three scrolls appeared to have been placed with great care.
“Indeed, it has been many years since we last met, my boy. From your clothing I would guess, since the day I left you at King’s Cross Station, so many years ago.”
Regulus shrugged ambiguously at his newly-acquired well-wishers and sycophants, watching his twin across the room, waiting patiently for him to join him at the Gryffindor table.
“Jonas, you may call me Lucius. I’ve been to Boston on business, it’s an absolutely charming town I must say.”
NOW, to get this going after all these years (I really am sorry for leaving this so long), I figured I'd break myself back in the habit of writing in the form of the accidentally-hilarious voices of my characters by starting out with a character I've been wanting to sink my teeth into!
“Malfoy.” Potter spat hatefully, a spark of something finally coming into those lifeless eyes. “What do you want?” The boy’s fists clenched, looking at Draco’s pointed wand then pointedly ignoring it, raising his chin defiantly. Beaten but not quite broken, clearly.
“You’re a very clever witch, Granger. I’m sure you can figure it out. Oh, and of course there’d be a very generous stipend for yourself, and you and your team together would hold fifty percent interest in any intellectual property you generate.”
“Well, I don’t know much about the curse. He put it on me right before I was supposed to go to Hogwarts, and I guess I was sort of in limbo for a really long time. But for me it’s just like I was about to go to Hogwarts for the first time and then Harry and Draco were rescuing me.”
Draco picked up, what was as far as he could see, his best hope for a logical and precise analysis of the situation. There was one muggle book he’d ever read that made even a modicum of sense, and fortunately, it was part of a series.
Jamie waited expectantly. It was a tactic he’d taught her. Don’t even ask, let the other person answer the question they imagine you want answered.
“Mr. Ollivander, I’m so sorry to trouble you with this. There was…a complication with the ritual that banished Voldemort. Only the evil part of him is gone and Tom is…well…what’s left.” He told him in a low voice.
“Potter. Just who I wanted to see. Jamie expressed an interest in speaking to you about her father.”
And now he sat curled up pathetically on the floor, his broken possessions scattered around him, debilitated by a pain he had never contemplated, never learned to resist, never dreamed of facing.
At that, Blaise turned his head and met Draco’s eyes, shock and terror in his eyes. Draco gave him a tiny solemn nod. Blaise would have to choose soon.
“Let me see the note.” Granger said, then read it aloud. “For the very pretty boy in Madame Malkins, with the big green eyes…what?”
Well, this explained why Potter hadn’t accepted the proposal of a marriage to Jamie. Draco would have to keep tabs on this pathetic little crush, hopefully Potter would lose his fixation and be more amenable in the future.
Draco closed his eyes and concentrated on the events starting only after he’d cast the Escribamens spell. He opened his eyes.
that. We’re working on it. And you’ll be ready sooner than you think. But first I have to get these things in working order.”
He found her deep in animated conversation with a nervous-looking fellow wearing thick glasses and waving his hands around as he talked. He tapped her firmly on the shoulder.
“So we need a fourteenth the mass of the nickel, that amount of the fourteenth element. Funny how that works out.”
Moony! You’re encouraging them, give me a fighting chance you crazy monster!” the teen protested loudly, green eyes dancing in a way that belied his complaints.
“Could he have attracted followers so quickly? Children that age are impressionable, could something like that make the Marks react? We don’t know nearly enough about how they work.” Hermione said.
“Dinner is in ten minutes.” The old woman informed him quietly, giving a small gesture in the direction of the romping children as she turned to reenter the guesthouse.
have three heirs to three different legacies to produce. I think each should be born and weaned in the appropriate house. So, since Black is most urgent, with the need for a blooded Heir, and Potter has only one living generation, Malfoy would be the last. And then after all three are born and weaned, we can decide as a family where to make our chief residence.”
“I, I have so many questions about your family, but that would be so improper! But, the other thing is, how did you come to be with them?”
He realized he was wearing an extremely undignified grin on his face, and quickly corrected the oversight before anyone noticed.
“Yes, exactly. Infants are very fragile, but holding and feeding a baby is an experience you won’t forget.”
…with magic, is a small thing. Just a few spells and a trip to the joke shop in London. And reading through some really dreadful Muggle literature, let me tell you.”
“Gryffindor...” the woman said in a hushed, horrified voice. “Well I hope you’ll be training her properly, even a Potter can be manipulated by a deft hand.”
Draco leaned close to his father. Perhaps it was time to draw him in, again. Lucius needed a reason to live again, something to work towards. The telling of a secret might be the start.
Harry sighed and sat down on the edge of the bed, conjuring a comfortable rocking-chair for Tom to sit on across from them.
“My opinions and his will slowly merge to a centrepoint between us, weighted by the strength of our convictions. He has only even known of magic for a few years, and his experiences with muggles have been very unpleasant.”
Draco thought frantically. Under Veritaserum he might reveal his knowledge of the Horcruxes! He met the Headmasters eye.
at him, and very dizzy from the potion Potter had apparently bathed in, the smell of which was filling the small space.
Inside a book, magically held inside a picture in a page, was the silver bonding knife he’d startled his father with.
The idea of combining effects without losing potency was…worth further study. Draco resolved to commission another research project on that subject as well.
“Hush, Ronald. I’m sure he has some ulterior motive, but we won’t find out what it is unless Harry goes there. I’m sure even Malfoy won’t try to kill him right in public, and in front of a first-year.”
A summation of the family assets. Twenty-four Gringott’s vaults. Shares in innumerable businesses in England and around the world. A very nice flat in London proper, and another in Knockturn Alley, vacation homes in France, Italy, Spain, Greece, and several others scattered across the preferred vacation spots of the world for the past twelve centuries. Safehouses in every reasonably-sized human population area in Europe. Four choices of bolthole, where the Malfoy family could live secretly and in style for a few generations, if necessary, to wait out troubles.
“I know!” he said, trembling. Tom nodded. A deathbed promise was a deathbed promise. Magic could be harsh when a death acted as a bond.
“Potter, I’ve discovered, is much more powerful than he appears. It’s very likely Lucius chose the wrong side in this war.” He said.
Merlin’s ball, she’d actually come out and said “magic” to a bunch of Muggles! Was the witch insane?
“Well, let’s just say I used a few Slytherin tricks to get you free from your normal duties to help me out with something a lot more important.”
Draco gave Potter one last smirk before he shrugged out of the robe, his own manhood hanging heavy and semi-erect in anticipation.
“Well, if her father was one of the creators, then I’d say Jamie has at least an equal claim on it to yours.” Draco argued, hoping to at least learn more about the powerful artifact.
Tom looked nervous as he lowered the baby into the bassinet. He stood over the child for a moment, watching him sleep.
The Malfoy line had never been exposed to young magic with less than three intervening generations of cultivation. Theirs was some of the most delicate, intricate generational magic that existed, excluding perhaps the Eouvalons of the Light side.
There, on the tracks, a long train stood, its massive body crowding the familiar space of the platform.
“I wanted to let you know I’m planning to bond with Potter tonight.” Draco informed him. “I hope you have your portkey?”
His father’s jaw clenched, his face white with a momentary flash of rage, all but invisible to the observer, and then the moment of crisis was over. Decision made.
As he was just turning away, Draco caught a small movement of Harry’s hand, a flash of the top end of a scroll of parchment…a sly wink.
Finally, the robes were in a small puddle at Harry’s feet, and Draco almost groaned in frustration as he saw the Gryffindor was wearing full muggle regalia underneath. The shirt slipped effortlessly over Harry’s touseled head, baring tawny skin stretched richly across a lean musculature. Draco eyed the smooth tan skin for a moment while Harry tugged futilely at his trousers.
Draco thought back to the self-loathing that was mixed in with the feelings of lust and love, when he’d found that item on the Conditions chart. Not to mention Potter crying in despair after wanking himself silly over Draco.
“NOT in my hospital ward!” Madame Pomfrey scolded, popping back around the corner without warning. “There are impressionable
Harry watched the too boys walk away together, feeling a sudden rush of his own memories of childhood introductions on this very platform.
“I suppose…I should be very sure about the security of the new locations before moving my gold there. That would be, perhaps…rash.”
“Your father is going to prime the memory for us, and then we will all dip our faces into the bowl.” Draco coached them.
Tom frowned as he watched his adopted brothers suffer forced separation for the first time he had ever witnessed.
“Harry. Even if you weren’t the Lord of two of the wealthiest estates in Britain, and I the Lord of another, you’re fucking
“But…I thought the swans were much more romantic! If you’re not going to use them, you should give it to him yourself! You know, you haven’t even spoken to Harry once since you started all this!”
He immediately darkened his scowl at the inappropriate display and with a jab from Granger, Harry quickly changed his expression to a noncommittal frown.
“He is the Dark Lord’s twin brother. The Dark Lord had…imprisoned him at a young age. You are aware of how the Dark Lord liked to take souvenirs from those he conquered.” Draco said in a very low voice.
Because good and miraculous things did not just happen to Severus Snape. They were certainly not accidentally gifted to him as a byproduct of another’s master plan.
Draco smirked. He knew very well that Harry’s lips were swollen from swapping something a bit different from furballs…and certainly not with the half-Kneazle.
The three pairs of eyes swiveled to take, what Draco was sure they must have thought was a surreptitious look at the Slytherin table. Draco made a point to sneer back at them. They quickly averted their eyes and went into a huddle, whispering furiously…then gradually growing louder…
Draco snapped the book shut and slid it into a pocket of his robes. He smoothed the page of the book under it to check his cover story…oh…it was the much more conventional book on pureblood-mudblood sexual unions he’d been perusing earlier.
most certainly would be weird. The most powerful wizard since Merlin must be indulged his eccentricities, of course, but this odd taste for the flesh of family members was a bit hard to deal with.
“Oh, and you can all call me Harry, in these rooms. Out there or in the classroom I guess it has to be Professor, but in the Common Room just call me Harry. Except for you.” Harry pointed at his son with a smirk.
“He’s here!” Potter whispered furiously to him, half crouched, pulling backwards, trying to turn around.
“Yes, well. I have my own plans to deal with it. I have a special mission for you, unique to your status as the Black house elf. This is very important, but you can’t tell anyone about it. Including these people.”
The scroll was the older project. Fitting to view it in it’s completion first. Then the peak into the darkest recess of Potter’s mind, for the details the scroll was sure to miss, he decided.
And…undoubtedly, the overwhelming nature of the magical exchange would ensure that Potter was the dominant partner, at least that time.
Draco smirked as Cloud’s eyebrow rose at being presented to the infant first. To his credit, the boy played along, gracefully bowing low at the waist and doffing and imaginary hat while raising a finger for Scorpius to latch on to.
It conceded. Draco knew it was only agreeing to the term out of obedience. The family magics were connected to the Records division of the Ministry. If Lucius Malfoy was imprisoned for life, he couldn’t handle the affairs of the family. Which meant he wasn’t the Lord Malfoy anymore. And therefore couldn’t re-enter his office. As far as the hereditary magics were concerned, the Lord Lucius Malfoy was dead.
“Oh that's right! You can’t hear them! Awesome!” James brightened immediately. He looked across at Edgar, who was still trembling, eyes fixed on the snake.
“Royal weddings are always on battlefields, Harry. They’re too important to be draped in flowers and lace.”
“The Seeker is the key to the game. But his friends are the key to that particular Seeker.” Draco explained.
He kicked sideways at the amorous mop, knocking it away, but it returned quickly, now joined by an enchanted scrub brush which unfortunately had the ability to magically hover, enabling it to slide its bristles suggestively up the inside of his thigh.
wizards who refuse to even entertain marriage contracts from men but I haven’t heard any hint of that from Potter. I am quite positive the physical attraction, at least, is mutual.”
“They kept insisting that the sweater wouldn’t be an issue! Then they’d just burst out laughing! It was so frustrating!”
“I would suggest the Chastity Spell, or, if the participants wish to be daring, the Protector of the Veil charm. Or some other variant to similar purpose.” Draco suggested.
The slight falter in his father’s step was barely discernable, and Draco realized the Dementors had somewhat thinned the man’s implacable will. Still, Draco didn’t allow his dismay at that thought keep him from driving the final blow, by sitting behind the massive desk and leaving his father a seat before it.
“Well then. I have a meeting to attend mother. Thank you for your concern.” Draco said, moving towards the Floo, powder in hand.
Grabbing the boy by the scruff of the neck, he flicked his wand to open the washroom door and tossed him inside.
“You were just in the right place at the right time to help me help you save the world, my dear Gryffindor.”
. That settled it. If being the heir of the Dark Lord, and through him of Slytherin, and through James Potter, of Gryffindor, hadn’t been enough, the Boy-Who-Lived had…well…“lived”. Bounced the Killing Curse off his forehead. With accidental magic. Killed the most powerful dark wizard of the age
“Fifty points from Gryffindor for endangering of a fellow student! And you both have detention with me
cabinet. This is bulk-stuff. The regular potions Dumbledore makes him put out by the bucketful, and that he sells off for money to get ingredients.”
“I took the trouble of looking it up to be sure. An exiled pureblood born to one of the Greater lines. Jamie has a right to her parentage. If Black were still in Azkaban I could bring suit on her behalf against the Ministry, for the privilege of his paternal attentions. They’d have to allow regular visits to ensure she was effectively brought up as a member of the Black family.
“Yeah, I’d better introduce you and make sure Thomas keeps the claws in. He’s very territorial with him.”
think the Ministry or the Board would want a bunch of horny teenagers to know that they could have the most amazing orgasms of their lives, if they could lower their scruples enough to torture a few of the more intelligent animals? And that that feeling would be intensified a hundred-fold by using, say, one of the younger students?”
“So for this generation, at least, the House of Black is…crippled. Have you been to Gr-, Grim, Gr-, what the hell?”
“It is exceedingly rare. A child can perform it accidentally, as random discharges. After gaining a wand, however…the energy is channeled through the core and such random discharges only occur when an especially powerful wizard loses control of his magic. Very dangerous.” Severus told him carefully.
reflection because the wand in the air is brighter, and it’s reflection blots out the light from under the surface.” Ollivander said.
“Not at all sir, I would have done the same. Thank you for your aid, I doubt Mr. Archer would have taken my explanation seriously if you had not intervened.”
He was fairly certain Potter was at the top of what must be a rather extensive list on the same section of his own scroll. But to Potter, the enmity with Draco was…just a little harmless school rivalry, apparently. Barely more important than intra-familial tensions. Obviously, logically, quite insignificant next to the greater struggle of the war.
“Oh, but with great deference to the Lord Malfoy, this is simply not true! Gringotts employ the very best experts with wards and curses in the world! Private resources available for a price may seem impressive, but I beg the Lord Malfoy not to be taken in by those…those tricksters with their…their…

"We aren't asking. As Minister of Magic, I've issuedan executive order that all necessary steps be taken to investigate the breakout and recover the prisoners, particularly Lucius Malfoy." Scrimgeour said, purposely loud enough for everyone to hear. Obviously he was here to generate headlines.
“It’s been a week since I gave you the Pensieve.” Draco said neutrally, leaning against a wall. He carefully slipped the scroll back into his pocket, keeping his wand out but lowered.
Draco dropped him, going suddenly cold. He pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and calmly wiped the spittle from his cheek.
Draco ate. In fact, he ate three servings. There were no appetizers, no entrees, no salads, just an endless amount of the same stew. It was
The magic sealing the room collapsed suddenly into their mutually clenched fist, insuring that their blood mingled together before being forced back into the wounds.
“Now now, Harry, I can’t have you ruining my perfectly lovely trap with unpleasant curses. Don’t you appreciate all the effort I’ve gone to?” Draco gestured at the lovely scene he’d spent so much time creating.
“Draco Malfoy. I know Harry looks up to you as almost a father-figure, I’m pleased to meet you as well. During the day. I…don’t do well around werewolves. Fenrir-”
Harry’s eyes suddenly caught him, swallowing him in their intensity as the magic responded to Harry’s sudden lust, burning him and making him forget everything but wondering…was Harry as hard as he was? Was his beautiful manhood rising under those robes, up and down with every beat of his pulse, pointed at Draco, hot and hard and
“A civil war! That’s…terrible. With the things you’ve mentioned, all the possibilities, I could see that getting pretty horrible with the weapons that must be available to that kind of conflict in your world!”
the best ward-worker Hogwarts has produced. In more generations than we have to be concerned about. I’m confident my trust is well placed.”
“I so swear.” The final loop settled into place, and the three sunk invisibly into Professor Snape’s skin.
“No, Draco.” Potter said firmly. “You’ll just have to wait until I’m strong enough, and defeat the Dark Lord. Things like this are just…you
Jamina looked up at him sharply, then looked down. Draco reached out quickly and put a finger under her chin, pulling her eyes upwards.
“I would love to accompany to observe the fruits of our project, Potter.” Draco cut him off mercifully.
Lucius’ eyes hardened at Draco’s casual mention of their respective roles as decider and advisor, but nodded, the resentment bitten back in the bitter knowledge that this was proper.
“Harry. We’ve done this the wizarding way, but some Muggle traditions have their sentimental value too.”
in here! More children! Where are they?” he demanded eagerly, licking his lips as he cast about trying to locate the scent of Ron and Hermione.
“You know what I mean. Potter might have better blood, and even be a rival for power, or much more powerful if he comes of age. But who do you think will really win? Can you even really make a prediction?”
The next part of the scroll was more or less useless to Draco, but it was only fitting the scroll would immortalize Potter as having a broken nose. Especially one from Draco.
Ollivander used his wand to levitate Voldemort’s wand out of the receptacle so that it hovered just above the surface.
“Most rash indeed, Lord Malfoy! Perhaps instead I could interest you in a new invention we have stolen from the Muggle world. It is called a credit stone, most of the more expensive shops now have the means to deduct an amount directly from your account simply by you placing your official Gringotts credit stone on their counter and tapping it with your wand!” the goblin hurried on excitedly.
…to a somewhat reasonable size, hopefully, Finch-Fletchley?” Draco raised an inquiring eyebrow at the blushing Hufflepuff.
perhaps Potter’s friends would know him well enough to be aware of the rituals that were proper to his status and bloodlines.
“I think you have a few of these already, why don’t you check off the ones we don’t need to bother with?”
Tom felt upset that someone had apparently been spreading rumors about him being an evil dark wizard, and now the fathers of his new brother believed the lies and would surely try to take Scorpius away from him.
Hermione Granger-Weasley was an attractive, enthusiastic woman in a fashionable power suit and an abundance of long, shiny ringlets of brown hair.
The Dark Lord seemed to think so, when he killed off Potter’s ally in the Triwizard Tournament. Potter blamed himself for Diggory’s death even now. And now Sirius Black. If the Dark Lord got his hands on Weasley or the Muggleborn…
“It’s nice enough. They have a lovely restaurant there, which we’ll be taking advantage of. I think it’s about time you were exposed to the sort of establishments a Black deserves.”
Lucius paused at that. To admit surprise would reveal the level of his own exclusion within his own house. On the other hand, a second heir to Slytherin was a strategic development that was not necessarily a positive one.
of things!” a star-struck third-year pointed at where James and Regulus stood with the other first years, waiting to be sorted.
“So, the thing is, scarab and alihotsy if aligned together remain intact inside a potion, and over time, they meld to create an acid that explodes on contact with new ingredients. Remember that Potter, it can be a devastating kind of time bomb.” Draco continued.
a ssssymbol, young Lord Malfoy. Ssssymbols cannot be ssssimply ignored! Essspecially one that, to the average fool, ssseeems to offer hope of my defeat!”
“Why thank you, Mr. Malfoy! Oh my, I never thought I’d see the day…go! Go on, the two of you, end this horrid feud foolishness now!”
Dumbledore had stepped back slightly, where Professor Snape couldn’t see him, and was quietly countering the Potion’s Masters’ attempts to dispel the locks on the door.
“I still think it has to be the Gloryflowers. They’re the most prestigious Light family besides Dumbledore, and they’d be using one of the Greek rituals at their age.” Pansy was saying.
“Potter.” Draco said curtly. “And to think I’d presumed it was a problem in the washroom. Just because your filthy Muggles won’t bathe doesn’t mean you’ve an excuse for contaminating the magical world with your stink.”
“He’s dead. Your fault, I believe. All that’s left of his paternal attentions are the ones he squandered on
“Yeah.” Potter said breathlessly. He vanished the cushion, and then carefully huddled together on the stone floor as Draco surgically vanished the transfigured tent-frame, leaving them once again in close contact under the Cloak.
“And which one of my sons’ names starts with a ‘D’, Draco? I started making this the same day you came to our house and made peace with Arthur. The knots are attuned for you, use it.”
It was to be the child’s own description of their proposed future spouse, upon first setting eyes on them.
“Tom, why don’t you bring Scorpius over here into this part of the suite, it will be a bit less crowded in the sitting room.” Harry suggested.
“This year the war has been officially declared, so the pressure from both sides will be especially harsh. If you feel that your situation needs help from someone higher up, you should speak with our Head of House, Professor Snape. I expect you will treat him with the respect he deserves.”
“So it seems your Daddy thinks he’s taught you how to make me do what you want, eh? Well we’ll just see about that.” The Hat mused. “Hmm, yes you do have a taste for adventure and mischief, very clever about it too…with that and your talent with snakes you could very well go into Slytherin like your father.”
would such a marriage be contracted? And would Potter be marrying beneath himself, as a royal marrying non-royal…or should he be considered marrying beyond his station, since he was a half-blood? The debate ranged on…
Draco sighed, allowing himself to enjoy the feel of Harry’s eyelash fluttering next to his thumb for a moment before recovering his hand once again.
it had standard protocol charms on it. And it was from Malfoy, it could have been a lot worse. Don’t you ever even think first?” Granger chided.
“Muggles don’t know that stuff.” Arthur said. “They don’t know a lot of things that are supposed to be impossible. Take a look at this thing over here. It’s a model of a much larger artifact, the size of a building, that converts the energy of a river into electricity…a sort of fire.”
There was a silence for a moment as Draco looked over his essay. His godfather had to be repayed for this, of course. How to do so without being obvious about it, or reducing his Potions grade, or possibly casting the blame on Potter.
Draco considered the boy before him. He wasn’t going to get much enjoyment torturing Potter as this pathetic figure. Someone had been beating on Potter, and it hadn’t been him, and for some reason that pissed the Lord Malfoy off.
need? There isss never ssssuch need! Our Massster Jamesssss hasssss long appreciated the sssssoothing sssssweetnesssss of ssssslumber! I demand thissss Other retract his vile accusssssationssss immediately!” the Dreamer hissed sharply.
“Delicious. I’ll have to look in on him once we’ve settled in, it’s been a while since we matched wits outside of a committee meeting.”
“Well, I really hate to say it but when we were staking out the Potions room the other night I suddenly noticed Potter is bloody gorgeous.” Draco said reluctantly. “And, he’s cleverer than I thought. And he’s…well…”
And well-done, too. Dizzy was holding the handle about a foot from the end, her small hands poised down at knee-level, snapping the brass pan up towards her face with admirable precision.
The swear jar, originally created for the boys, had lain fallow and unused for many years, because Draco’s considerable efforts at raising sophisticated young scions had resulted in sophisticated young demons far too clever to get caught using words that had been actively prohibited (or for that matter, ever heard before in living memory).
On consummation, the magic in Potter’s core would rush into Draco like a burning tide of pure alcohol, while Potter devoured Draco’s own magic that was like a fine wine.
Harry, of course we didn’t. You would have obsessed over it, don’t you try to tell me you wouldn’t. Draco took care of things like a reasonable person. You would have been afraid of it and afraid of yourself because that’s always been your impulse.” Hermione said briskly.
“So, in about ten hours, one-seventh of the scarab and alihotsy will start to meld. Which of course, will mean that the glumbumble will start to react to the dragons blood because it will no longer be dampened by the alihotsy. And of course, the magical energy of the dragonsblood will also no longer be expended on inverting the effects of a full one-seventh of the scarab, leaving us with a dragonsblood-glumbumble pressure system.” Draco explained.
Harry won’t mind! Well you handle Ron and I’ll handle Harry. Yes, yes, anything is better than that horrid pub. Alright, I’ll see you later on this afternoon then, thanks again.”
no boundaries to what we can do, it’s just a matter of manipulating the right force in the right direction and anything is possible.”
At that moment, Draco’s distinctive Eagle Owl glided into the Great Hall, circling momentarily before landing before a stunned Trio.
done all sorts of evil things…to the other kids and even some adults at the orphanage, but those weren’t wizard evil things, just normal kid pranks.
Harry nodded, but still watched the twins. They squirmed nervously under their gaze. Somehow, their Daddy seemed to see right through most of their schemes.
go to Gryffindor, but that may not be best. You and your brother are very close…it might be good to separate you for a bit so you can learn to be your own persons, don’t you think?”
“It’s for the best, mate. You’ve been moping ever since he died, you know,” Ron Weasley was saying, “Thinking it’s all your fault. Maybe you’ll feel better when you don’t rememb--”
taste like something Archimedes would have cooked up in his legendary lab, labeled “poison” and hidden away, cackling that his ambrosia would never be used except by a man who had lost all will to live, and most needed it.
In the center was Albus Dumbledore, looking quite a bit younger, far younger than his father could have possibly known him. The man was…dancing. He was horrible at it too, but seemed unaware of this. Eyes twinkled merrily as he started kicking his knee up, then kicking the leg out in the opposite direction. Left knee up. Left leg out and to the right. Right knee up, then the entire leg. Draco stared, open-mouthed.
Then Potter let out a sudden yell, and stumbled in Draco’s arms, hissing in pain, a hand clamped to his forehead.
“I don’t…I don’t understand. Why didn’t you tell me there was a seventh Horcrux if you knew? Why didn’t Dumbledore?”
“Oh Lord Malfoy, I’m horrified to have you in my house in it’s current state! That cursed mutt that used to be my son named a Halfblood as Heir! A
Regulus and James both focused on Tommy, interested at the prospect of a tale of magical daring-do. Their fathers had told them very dry, matter-of-fact stories of their adventures that tended to suck all the fun out of them.
The young Lord Draco Malfoy stepped out of the ornate carriage and strode towards the main entrance of his home with every ounce of pomp he’d been taught growing up.
Draco started to feel a low burn from Harry’s hard body behind him as the topic got them both thinking in that direction. Draco ignored the stirring under his robes and pushed the conversation back to topic.
helpful to your family at all! Surely you don’t think Harry should start the same thing right now! Especially since he’s the
Unfortunately, a few less prestigious pureblood wizards of every generation had to be sacrificed to such a fate in order to channel that unfocused power into the long-term generational magic that was the foundation of the powerful collective wardings that kept the wizarding world protected.
“Ssssee? Thissss I have told you again and again! And even Jamessss has ssssaid it many timessss, but issss only punissssshed!”
“You think…oh love you don’t need to worry about that! If you’ll recall, Pansy is still very much alive and having a gay old time with her lover in Budapest now.”
Severus inclined his head in thought. While a young Harry, with the heart-rending green depths of Lily’s eyes set in the exact visage of his tormenter, had most certainly triggered a wash of old impotent loss and rage, he had deliberately channeled those feelings to improve his cover at the time.
Finally Harry seemed satisfied with his efforts, and turned to Draco. His eyes looked troubled and…afraid.
“One we have heard of before, a grave threat to the fatherssss when they were nessssstlingsssss.” The Planner said.
The chunk of nickel slowly turned over inside the mixture, and began to sink. Through the base of the aluminum pan.
“Life-Debts” (Of course, this would be inappropriate, since calling in a life-debt during a marriage negotiation indicates a form of slavery rather than an alliance)
“Oh yes.” Draco said smugly. “Potter is more affected by the loss of his parents than he has made public. He longs desperately for a family, and this is what I have offered him. The protection of a strong wizard, not the powerful father-figure you may one day represent to him, in the more distant future, but it is a symbol of what might be. He cares little for its Darkness.”
“My dear, there are simply things you do not yet understand. Do try not to get yourself too attached. Your father made the same mistake with James Potter, I’m afraid, and it quite ruined him.”
“Mr. Malfoy! Come in, come in my boy!” The Headmaster’s eyes twinkled that infuriating all-knowing twinkle at him as he came to sit. Draco had no doubt the Headmaster knew why he was here. Even if Potter had not told him, the history of the Crystal Sceptre was something the man would be intimately aware of, since his grandfather had used it in Grindelwald’s service.
Harry Potter had his back to him as he removed the last of his clothing, the pale globes of his un-tanned bottom flashing briefly before Potter slipped into the water, grunting as the scalding water enveloped him.
Draco, recovering quickly from the pure horror of Molly Weasley speculating out loud and in public about he and Harry’s sexual acts, looked up just in time to see the Golden Trio rushing out the doors of the Great Hall.
“Dumbledore likes to know everything in the castle.” Harry said, casting obscuring charms on each wall, then the ceiling, then causing the floor to become an insubstantial blur beneath their feet.
“It is odd.” Dumbledore admitted. “But the Sorting Hat is quite reliable. Miss Black. Can you tell me why you’ve been sorted into Slytherin?”
And Draco had already betrayed to him that he was having doubts about joining the Dark Lord. The Escribamens spell
Severus Snape gingerly replaced the Porta-Floo in its cradle on his desk, freezing in his withdrawal and pressing his hand back onto the device.
In his dorm, Draco held the silvery vial in one hand, and Potter’s scroll in the other. Which to examine first?
His godfather’s expression was somewhere between disgust and admiration…Draco knew the man recognized the Sceptre, even if Dumbledore didn’t fill him in. He’d know where it came from, and probably was surprised that Draco had taken his advice...and used his stolen memory…in such an extreme way.
“Your soul left Harry’s body with Scorpius, you’re probably magically tethered to him. Have you been far from his side?”
“Well yeah, it’s kind of standard…you can’t even buy a bottle of shampoo these days that hasn’t got some sort of girly scent mixed into it. Not to mention most stuff has dyes and stuff in it too, so the stuff even
Potter looked back at Draco, something akin to respect dawning in his eyes. Draco ignored the long-sought-for regard from his rival and concentrated on looking deadly and determined.
But perhaps it was not until Draco had told him the prophecy? But if Harry had heard the altered prophecy, he wouldn’t be looking at Draco with wounded betrayal in his eyes…so it was either after the prophecy, or just before it.
Harry shifted, not sure what to do. He looked at his son, who shrugged with similar bafflement. Harry extricated his hand, letting it fall to his side.
“So what kind of curse did the Dark Lord have you under, and why?” Cloud interrogated him once they had found an empty compartment.
“You say that, but people thought he was dead last time, too. Harry killed him in first year, even! And then another version of him in Second, who knows how many copies of him there are?”
Moody was mumbling something about faulty Veritaserum and Shacklebolt was just staring at Draco, shocked at the revelation.
“I have made mistakes, you see?” He tapped his irritated forearm demonstratively. “Mistakes which expose a certain weakness of character. I once envisioned myself a kind of heroic figure, in the reality I allowed to be constructed for me in my own mind. It turns out, I was not. I was a villain all along. So…I leave this business to those whose character and ability I have the utmost faith in.”
Harry leaned over and kissed Draco shyly on the cheek and Draco scowled at him as he felt his face warming. Harry giggled at him and hopped nimbly to the floor. Draco followed suit, following him to the door of the Great Hall where Harry turned to him with a serious look on his face.
“It’s an old traditions, three specific kinds of gift…all of them priceless and chosen especially for the prince or princess being courted.”
“Well, Orpheus, when Draco defeated Voldemort, he disrupted some of the pieces of magic that he had created. And one of those was imprisoning me. And because Draco and Harry were going all over Britain hunting down Voldemort’s pieces of magic, they found where I was, and did a ritual to get me out. Only, Harry was pregnant with Scorpius and they didn’t know I was in there, so I got soul bonded to Scion Scorpius Malfoy. So since my mother died and Voldemort killed my father, they adopted me into the family.”
“But dragon blood is volatile, of course, so it has to be countered by the sopohorus, which also slows the brain, and glumbumble bile, which of course is also counterbalanced with alihotsy to increase the befuddlement part of the potion.” Draco explained.
“‘For my family I dedicate all my spirit, my magic, my seed. The family before all.’ It is a promise young boys of certain families make daily to their fathers.” He explained, a fervent light in his eyes for a moment.
“James, you can’t give candy to a turtle! It’s gastrointestinal tract can’t handle sugar or glucose!”
treasure chests, Lord Malfoy. After the first chest there is the matter of a quantity order, which involves additional fees, which I’m sure will not be a problem for one such as yourself-”
Long, almost girlish blonde hair, tall, slim, but definitely a young man. His posture fully erect, standing perfectly still on the edge of the porch, a marble statue but for the blowing hair. Pointy features on white skin…all made indefinably pretty by the soft lingering smile as he watched the crowd of children. Or, perhaps, watched one of them.
Draco just sniffed loudly to express his outrage and swirled his robe around him as he stalked away, steadfastly ignoring Harry’s ringing chuckles behind him.
He surveyed the rest of the spots. A multitude of moments, and all of them seemed to be people. People…doing what? Dying for Potter? No, only a few of those. What then? Maybe, being willing to? But Granger didn’t show that…but she certainly had to work hard to brew Polyjuice Potion at that age.
Jonas looked at the nickel in his hands, at the several sheets of paper covered in mathematical formula.
“Durm-, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft of Wizardry.” Draco said, the lie twisting in his mouth to the correct answer.
There were more than one reasons Harry needed to keep his eyes closed, Draco thought, tugging on the boy’s arm to help him sidestep a rose petal. Just a few more steps and they’d be there.
And below that, in microscopic print, a seemingly endless list of, apparently, most of the wizarding world.
“Godrics Hollow was reportedly a very charming cottage in the country, perhaps it would do well as a habitual weekend and summer home?” he offered.
“Think of it as dancing. You always face the direction I’m not facing, watch my back and I watch yours. So when I do this-”
“Oh wait, you’re right. If every element is reactive we have no neutrals and can’t find a safe vessel. Okay, what else can you work with in liquid form. Nitrogen?”
“Yet, the Dark Lord failed to kill him. Yet, he killed the Dark Lord as an infant. By accident. Yet, he took the Killing Curse and walks to this day.” Draco said in a monotone voice.
“We’ll have a lifetime for you to learn how to be a better Slytherin. For now, I’ll be the Slytherin for both of us. Because you
“Yeah.” Tom said, feeling edgy from the separation even though he could feel warm vibes of contentment from several cars back. He guessed Harry was feeding him. Good. Harry didn’t tend to be as good with schedules as Draco was.
At the same time, Rose certainly took after his godmother and would fit exactly into the role she had played.
Draco raised his wand and cast a glamour, then a notice-me-not charm on the bag before turning to leave the room.
Draco held him firm, a strong hand on his wand arm. And then Draco reached out…and took Potter’s wand out of his hand.
“Poetry” (Absolutely not. As demonstrated by reaction to the Weasley girl’s attempt, this is clearly not something Potter appreciates.)
“I guess she’s got me wrapped around her finger, all right! But you didn’t come all the way to Egypt to talk about my engagement! Ol’ Grup was in an awful state and just told me to do what you say no matter how dangerous, then went off muttering about how dangerous and unreliable human-made wards are. Care to enlighten?”
are very right that dreaming and sleep is important and shouldn’t be interrupted. If I never got any sleep, I’m sure I’d go quite mad.” Tom said to the Dreamer.
The twins paused and glanced guiltily up at the balcony to see if their father had witnessed their dreadful
The Dark Lord laughed his horrible, hissing laugh again and Draco looked up at the snake-like figure.
“Fine. Give this to Harry. And here, give him these too.” Draco handed her a small scroll and another long-stemmed rose. “Mind the thorns.”
Lacewing? But…surely not…she couldn’t have been more than a first or second year, maybe third! Polyjuice was a NEWT potion!
of all people about the sexual side-effects of intercourse with a being as powerful as Potter!” Draco snapped.
“Sounds like a particularly debilitating form of co-dependence, if you ask me.” Granger snapped. “And certainly not healthy!”
Draco was on his knees, trying to catch his breath, his body feeling weak and useless with the magic that had sustained him his entire life suddenly stripped away entirely.
, is not the man doing those things, but the man who regrets that he has done such things. And that man, even with that guilty conscience, seems like someone I could call a friend. If you’re willing to be friends with, how did you say it? With a Muggle.”
“Yes. He has yet to understand its potential use, of course. And his Magic gift was a powerful Dark talisman soaked in my own blood, which will grant him some measure of protection from hexes.”
Potter’s parents were fortunate to be safely dead and, hopefully, no longer sexually attractive to him.
What a strange place to draw memories from. People died. Or worse, betrayed you. Better to choose something immovable to draw from. Like an idea. Or the past.
Harry willingly relinquished his dominating position over Draco and gave him a hand up from the floor.
hand. The reason the ritual’s illegal is because it’s more common to force others to donate the parts.” He chuckled.
“New students are sorted according to their character into one of four houses. In another life, you were Slytherin. So was I, by the way.”
Someone had to come eventually. They would. If he was good, if he scrubbed his face, if he smiled big and bright when they came, someone would be here for him and take him away. He’d been waiting before he arrived here, he’d continue to wait here.
“A Protective Charm linked to your own magical core can be quite dangerous for you, Lord Malfoy.” Murdoch cautioned.
“We…accidentally…overheard sssssome detailsssss while we were sssssleeping amongssssst the booksssss.” The Dreamer admitted.
Ah. Two weeks and Harry was still poring through his proposal contract. No doubt, Granger was invaluable to him there, Draco thought enviously. If only Pansy or Blaise had her organizational skills. He wondered idly what Granger would make of the anti-incest clauses in the agreement. He hoped the vague boilerplate language his barristers had constructed would be sufficiently discreet to avoid embarrassing Harry.
“But, the question is, what can we do about it? And, can we just assume it’s because of Tom the Marks are reacting? They didn’t when he manifested, after all. What’s changed?”
Draco glared at the list. Each of the items seemed to make sense, even if a twisted sort of muggle-sense. But only individually. As a list…none of the items were consistent in every account of a courtship, and no predictable pattern was obvious to Draco.
“Well I’m sure we can come up with a star that suits you. It’s important to stick to the naming conventions, my dear. The family magic could hesitate before recognizing you as Black, for example. Your blood runs true, dear, but names have magical significance and are easily ascertained.”
At that moment, his interrogation was interrupted by the entrance of the massive flock of owls. Draco rescued his toast as the Daily Prophet dropped down in front of him.
Draco could see him, in all his glory, naked and flushed and anger and terror and concern flashing across his face as he hovered anxiously over Draco, snapping his fingers in front of eyes that were frozen, staring upwards at the ceiling.
“Mr. Malfoy, it seems your potion has had an unusually powerful effect. Mind telling me what you changed from the original recipe?” Professor Snape sounded amused.
Draco rolled over on top of him, holding himself up on his elbows so he could look down at his husband.
“Thisss is something you shhhould have been alert for, Luciussss! I keep you at my sssside to take note of detailssss I have no time to ponder! Crucio!”
“Oh!” Potter’s face suddenly lit up with realization. “Yeah I guess I understand what you’re saying. People tell me I look just like my father. I guess that must be important with old, really famous families like this, and-”
“I don’t trust the ferret, Harry.” Weasley was saying, grabbing the envelope from an outstretched talon. Helios nearly overbalanced, feathers ruffling as he flapped his wings in protest of the rough treatment.
for herself?” Draco asked reasonably. “The dowry would, of course, reflect the value of your patience.”
Albus put a hand on his shoulder “into his hands you placed it, my boy, and I am sorry for my part in pushing you to that place. But it is not this Tom’s fault that he still holds it.”
“I would like that. Jonas. It… I have made errors in the past, that have made me cautious, and… it will take some time for me, you understand. But, I would like that. As shocking as it is, I would like to be your friend.”
their Papa called them, and their Dad would get a very upset look on his face like it hurt him to talk about things.
Draco jerked his hands back from the scroll. Not something he was ready to deal with. Fine then. Albus Dumbledore.
“I’m sorry Jamie. I suppose I shouldn’t have tried to open negotiations right in front of you like that. It was indiscreet of me.”
“I see.” Dumbledore gazed at him sharply. He’d caught the ‘my nature’ as a clear reference to his status as a Light or Dark wizard.
Potter’s hungry eyes suddenly turned to some other emotion, Draco couldn’t tell what it was, but Potter raised his hands to reach towards Draco, his face straining with the effort to concentrate despite the sensations below his waist and the anger and the
Jonas started to smirk, then his eyes narrowed as the nitrogen began to froth and emit a slight glow.
“In conclusion of our ritual, I offer you the Blood gift – my wand shall ever serve to bring about the deaths of the enemies of your house, be they wizard, muggle, or squib.”
my father got his insane ideas about your family but he left out the fact that your wife’s cooking should be illegal!”
“How can he be fully manifested if he’s just a fragment of a fragment of a soul? The one in the diary tried to build a body using Ginny.” Harry prompted.
Regulus felt some bit of tension in his back soften as his brother sat down and put on the hat. There was something indefinably wrong about his brother being out of arms reach – he felt as if he couldn’t quite interact properly with others without the twin-dynamic playing its role.
“Come now, Granger, this is a boarding school.” Draco said reasonably. “Adolescents live here, grow up here together, away from their parents. Of course a good deal of experimentation will be going on. Best we control the location and make sure certain the children don’t accidentally give away something they don’t hold title to.”
Carefully, the twins crept forward and flattened themselves on either side of the door, conferring in harsh whispers.
“There’s really only one way to fix it. For the future, of course. You’ll have to produce the next Black heir, and we’ll have to make sure
“Well, if you didn’t like them, Hufflepuff is probably not the house for you, then.” Draco surmised. “And you’re sitting here with nothing to do, yet not reading. So definitely not a Ravenclaw.”
“Thomas is as unlike the Dark Lord as one might expect from one so young. I do not think I will have that difficulty, if his behavior does not stray in directions that cause concern.” He assured.
Harry’s eyes lit up, childlike, behind those glasses, and Draco suppressed the urge to remove them and snog him properly. Instead he stood up, giving his boyfriend a hand up and pushing him onto the couch between Fred and George, sparing a stern glance for each of them.
“I suppose it’s the same sort of thing. Only…hopelessly disgusting. Only a Muggle would think of carving their own flesh like that.” Draco shuddered.
“Very true. Which makes it very fortunate that the Dark Lord was so kind as to make Harry Potter his magical heir.” Draco said idly.
And Mrs. Weasley was beaming at Draco, clearly very pleased with the amount of food he’d put away. No doubt, she presumed this food would one day be put to great work creating a vast multitude of little blond children…
that machine, anyways? And why was it, and the other cleaning equipment, getting off on what should be a very private and intimate moment between Harry and Draco?
