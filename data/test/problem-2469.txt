"Nothing, nothing. Just you and your inner Gryffindor." Harry rolled his eyes and snickered at the boy before furthering his story.
"What," Draco's voice cracked, but he felt it too, the excitement and nervousness and pure joy knowing they finally made it this far, that they had the honor of accepting each other in the most intimate way.
"Potter—"
Harry smiled widely, and then Draco shoved another box in his direction.
"Take it as experimenting," Blaise patted his shoulder and Draco flinched at the touch, pushing it away. "Maybe you'll like his strong arms holding you tight before you fall asleep together."
Harry swallowed. "We'll cross that bridge when we get there." And then he furrowed his brows. "I'll get to defend you in honesty. As it should be. It was hard enough dancing around it during your hearing. It'll be okay. You fought for the good side. I'll get to prove it now." Draco took a deep breath. "I told you when we were fifteen. I'm not embarrassed of you and I'm not afraid to be in love with you either. They're all just noise. They're all looking for something to be interested in because they're bored with their own lives. I've always only been their entertainment. The second I bore them is the second that I don't matter to them anymore. The news cycle will pass, something else more exciting will come up."
"It doesn't matter. I'm going to get you out of here. But he's going to do that to me when he comes. When he knows it's you, he's going to do that to me because he wants you to suffer." He whispered, "I need you to be strong enough to leave me here. You have to get out. Remember what we talked about."
"Not fair. It's our anniversary! I want to kiss you."
"How long is that?"
"We talk more than we kiss, thankfully in this case." He let out a nervous laugh.
Draco just about stepped back, ready to make a break for it. They wanted identification. He’d done it so many times before. Idiot Death Eaters would think they had him, except they would bring in those with brown eyes and tan hair and pretend that the muggle or halfblood had used polyjuice. Those were the easy ones to get rid of. His mother helped him act more that of a Death Eater: how to talk and what to say, how to sneer properly, how to make those in question feel worthless and useless- it helped with interrogation.
“I was just following orders,” Draco said coolly. Draco reached up with his neck and kissed Harry before the gryffindor pulled away.
"What are they saying?" Draco whispered.
“As long as you aren’t going to choke on me,” Harry laughed.
"What is going on," Draco demanded, kneeling next to Harry's bed, worry shown over his brow, but he was ignored.
————————————————
"Harry," Harry emphasized.
he wanted to remain constant until he died, was the latter.
"I'm not sure."
"Yeah. You were. I admired you. You were brave and kind and thoughtful."
"You don't know how terrifying it is when you reach a little too far, when your sleeve clips your bag, when your boyfriend wants to hold your hands and play with your wrists-- fuck! You don't know how sick you feel. You don't know anything!" His entire body was sweating all over. "You don't know what it's like to making him angry by blocking your mind to him, so he doesn't see what you've done, who you're talking to, what you're saying, because it's scarier when he doesn't know. Then he uses you and feels you near me and ah!"
"Please just stop doing this to yourself," Draco sat up and kneeled next to Harry, their hands still together. "Listen, I'm sorry, okay? I am. I don't know what happened and I don't know why it did, but I can't help it. And I don't know why it hurts seeing you like this. As much as I wish I could remember just for you to shut up, I can't. I have no idea to begin with how you even fell in love with me if you really did-"
"You can't just hide behind that lamp, no fair—"
"Like the song Potter? Wrote it myself." Harry approached the boastful snake giving a true intimidating stare.
"I know."
With one last spell, the wall exploded into shambles, revealing. Harry and his friends, and a large room.
"That's the worse thing you could possibly do," he shouted. "You hate being alone!"
Everything would be okay now. This reality wouldn't be his anymore.
"Yeah, the cup you stole it from us," Blaise looked intimidatingly at them, but they Gryffindors wouldn't budge. "Kiss ups."
Harry looked at the six bottles on the sink ledge. Draco worked each one of them into Harry's skin for him, softly massaging and then making him rinse. He gave gentle pats and kisses with his fingers as Harry stood there, keep himself from falling apart at Draco's generosity, his affection. He didn't deserve it.
"I am," he said. "Please go, Harry. I-I don't want you here."
"You could always date me," she smiled, trying to lighten the mood, obviously failing at it. Anger was a thick cloud surrounding the whole house, and Harry was the storm.
"I take that as a compliment." Malfoy playfully looked up at him. Then he showed Harry his own hand. "How's this?"
Her eyes widened and the book she was carrying fell from her arms.
me! You made my home with you and then you set it on fire with me inside of it. I thought the world of you. We were amazing together! We were... we could have taken on the world together! I loved you and you fucking abused me.
at the Yule Ball that he overheard me and of course, reacted in the most logical way."
"Noted," Draco put it in his pocket. "Okay, call me crazy, but it smells
“Because these last three weeks without you have been a nightmare,” Draco answered truthfully. He couldn’t work on the cabinet, he was heartbroken, and he had nightmares.
"Oh yeah," he agreed, "Must be awful. She wasn't much, but she wasn't horrible, I've had worse baby sitters, but anyway, sometimes she was very poetic, and it would be out of no where. I kept wondering where she got it from, until one day, one of the last days I should say, she put this moldy, dusty box in front of me, and inside were letters from her husband."
They leaned in again, and the second their lips met, Harry started laughing again. "I'm sorry! I can't help it!"
"That's bollocks, you love me! And you've told me so. You are absolutely, hopelessly in love with me!"
"Well this is exciting isn't it!"
. Stupid Potter. As if Draco couldn't stop thinking about him.
Harry just smiled. He loved his friends knowing. Pumblechook and Astoria, not so much. He just couldn't trust them.
"I read your letters," Harry tried to interject, but he kept babbling like an idiot, and although it hurt Harry to see him standing where he was standing, it made his abused heart swoon. He thought he was the only one who wasn't over their relationship.
"It's more than that, Potter.. And I mean it when I say he can't find out about this. If he even knew if I was talking to you right now..."
"I just don't understand," Harry said after quite some time of Draco flipping through spells.
"I'm sorry about that," Harry said. Draco kissed him.
Draco's cheeks turned red. Draco was failing. "No. Bloody Prick hates my family, probably."
The note read:
Harry kissed his cheek, and moved his hips backwards a bit, and the burn came back, however bearable. He moved cautiously a few times, and then they set a faster rhythm, and Harry pressed feather kisses along his neck.
"That's the point! He played it off well!"
Draco untangled them and went to the floor, reaching under his bed. He brought out several boxes, all wrapped in shiny paper, and a final cake stand covered in a dome. He lifted it as Harry sat up, revealing a chocolate birthday cake. It read
"More or less these days."
Pumblechook leant back in his chair as he thought. He licked his lips as he held back a smirk. "It all makes more sense now. I couldn't figure out why you suddenly showed up at his trial. You understand if Kingsley knew, it would be a conflict of interest and the ruling would be overturned."
"I know. I just don't want to put you in a position where you feel rushed or forced or anything. Please tell me no if I go too far. I'll stop. I don't want you uncomfortable."
"If you did, you wouldn't be doing this to him!"
"We could have been so happy," Draco smiled, standing and stepping towards him, before frowning. "But you ruined it."
The poor kid was so frustrated on the Triwizard Tournament, he thought he would explode.
"You didn't have a hunch? He kept telling me you were suspicious."
Draco went into a deep thought again before speaking again, an idea hammering his brain. “What about October 31st?”
They walked past the Great Hall, hearing the booming music coming from it, but Harry didn't stop there, and set for the forest.
"No."
"A nightmare really," Draco whispered and Harry's smile dropped. He furrowed his eyebrows. "I lost you."
“Eat more. That’s not enough.”
They both stood there in silence before Harry said. "I'm sorry, too. What do we do now?"
"Your.. Your eyes. They're a different shade than normal."
"This place is incredible," he said genuinely, more to himself. Thanks to Harry and the value of the Manor being haunted by memories, he actually grew to like the Burrow. It was closed, yes, but cozy, and it made him want to snuggle up with Harry by the fire. He walked over to the staircase and just looked up to see the marvelous structure.
"Ron," Harry out his hand on his shoulder and patted it, "she'll understand at Christmas, don't beat yourself up about it."
Harry took his hand once more, leading him to the unstable pile of rocks. The Slytherin began to climb when Harry held him back. Instead he climbed forward instead and got a firm grip, asking Draco for his hand.
"Why's that?"
But Harry's different.
"Thanks," he turned on his heel, going back to his bed. "He really is great. I hope one day you get to meet him. Properly."
"You're joking."
"I would kill the ferret and then I would kill you! A dog if anything but we aren't."
Harry's mouth dropped under the bed, and he had to bite his fist down so he couldn't make a sound.
"What if I ever called you Drackiepoo," Harry giggled as he sat up on the couch.
"That's okay. That's totally okay." Harry kissed his cheek and then his jaw and then his lips. His skin had goosebumps and his eyes were watering. "This is all I could ever want, oh my God."
“Then what are you feeling?”
Hermione breathed deeply for a bit, letting Harry walk it out, and then suggested, "Maybe you could get back in the dating field. You said you don't really know your sexuality. Maybe you could find out. Are you attracted to anyone?"
“So he chased me around the entire damned castle,” Draco said, rolling his eyes, acting as though he was visibly annoyed.
Draco took Harry's hands and played with them loosely, tears welling up in his eyes. "It's always been you hasn't it?"
"I guess so. We were letting out our anger of our break up, I suppose. We are both two hot heads under a flame."
"I want us to stay like this. Always like this."
"It's on file with the Ministry. When you got me out of Azkaban, part of the terms of me staying out is to follow through with the marriage. If I don't marry her, then I'm back in Azkaban."
The next night, Harry shuffled through his entire wardrobe in a frenzy. He didn't have date clothes. He didn't have nice things like Malfoy did. Beyond his uniform, all of his clothes were Dudley's.
"Yeah, but. There might be danger—"
"Yes, I didn't know what to do and I just wanted to wake you somehow-"
"Harry," he clenched. He gripped his head, squeezing his hair. Harry grabbed his hand.
That was their turning point.
Draco moved his hand and stroked behind Harry's ear, and that made Harry angry, because none of them would be able to be held like this, to be cared for in such a way. Harry didn't move though. He just breathed, and that too made him so ridiculously angry, because fuck, it was such a privilege that he didn't deserve because all those people died for him.
"The pleasure is mine," Draco smiled.
"I could lie."
"To hold it against you in an argument."
"Why am I not in them," he repeated just a bit louder.
Most of the things they would pull on other houses were just friendly pranks.... maybe take out the friendly, in fact they were most certainly not friendly, rather certain tomfoolery could land you in the hospital wing for weeks.
"But Draco's do. And you love it. And you love screaming, and yes, I have made you scream, and yes, it's probably the best sound I've ever heard. And yes, my goal is to make you scream right now. So snitch is our safe word. If you want to stop, tell me."
“Dad, were you nervous telling father,” Scorpius asked.
"Oh, I guess because the Gryffindors talk about it in one room, you know. At night we talk about..."
"Hey," Draco put up a fake smile.
"You're sure?"
"I'm not leaving him," Harry shrieked, looking as far as the eye could see.
Draco reached out and rubbed his pointy knee. "I never want you to feel so unloved again."
"Your life is yours now. You own it. This is the only one you have. You have an opportunity right now to change it, to build something you want. And I want you to have as many resources available to you as possible."
“Draco, “ Harry nudged into him, “I’m so sorry.”
"Their house is in ruins but no one got hurt." And then Harry looked him up and down. "You look like shit. Sorry. I mean, I didn't get a good look at you before. Worse than before we left."
“One, two, three, go,” Harry started the countdown and they started blowing until Draco’s popped early. “Ha! I win.”
Harmonia nectera passus
Harry opened his mouth and then closed it. "Let's just open this bloody can of worms while we're at it."
"And then when we're done, we can have very hot make-up sex, right?"
"You know it would be a shame if someone just," Draco trailed off playfully, sticking his fingers right next to Harry's stomach, inevitably causing the boy's eyes to widen.
“Is it Parkinson? I’ll kill her. Just you wait, I’ll destroy her-“
The difficult part was actually finding the cabinet. He only had a small clue on what it looked like, and the amount of items in there was barbaric. Could not being able to locate the tool be a good excuse? 'Not bloody likely' Draco answered his own thought.
"I didn't, I promise! You murdered me. I can't believe it."
"Stuff like what," Harry raised his head and kissed his earlobe, sucking it. Draco felt a wave of pleasure go through him and a small, almost undetectable moan surfaced.
“’There’s a dark feel whenever they walk into my classroom,’ the professor said, ‘there is a possibility that Mr. Potter could be under the imperious curse. Another scenario I discovered is that Mr. Potter could be against the Wizarding World in question. My thoughts consist of Mr. Potter pulling a goody-goody act until he is at power, and there is evidence he plans to overthrow the ministry.’”
"And I enjoy messing with you."
TW: Emotional abuse; suicidal ideation
Harry burst out laughing, face red, and a few did too in sheer confusion, but Harry was the loudest and Hermione ended up kicking his leg under the table.
"Draco, what are you," Harry started but realized that Draco wasn't wrapped in his arms, rather behind him. "Draco?"
"Three."
Everything had gone back to normal.
Draco didn't say anything at first, rather swallowed and allowed Harry to take a moment. He didn't judge him, didn't laugh at him, just wanted him. "Are you-"
"What," Draco mumbled, turning to Harry.
"Harry, that was over a year ago. If I still hated you for it, I wouldn't be here. And it's not like I was a saint either. I was going to use an unforgivable on you," he cried. "Imagine how that would have been!"
"You snore," Harry kissed the top of his forehead.
"We've worked so hard," she scoffed, "Me and Blaise, to get you to be a normal person. You've finally broken out of your shell-"
"You're right. I have that fear," Harry said. "But it's going away slowly but surely."
"The vanishing cabinet In the room of requirement. I've been mending it all year." It all seemed to make sense to Harry now.
"Good, I hope she's dead. I hope he took her to the middle of the woods and killed her. That better be where he is." Draco stopped, his hands formed into fists so hard, his knuckles turned white. "Did you see her slap him? She laid a finger on my Harry! The
"Want to bet?"
Draco could barely swallow. "Er, yeah. I think... I... Yes," he gulped. "I did." Fucking liar. Harry dashed up the stairs, but Draco caught his arm. "What are you saying?"
"Doubt it! We aren't that inhabitable!"
"Because you're sick! You haven't slept properly in Merlin know's how long! No. You're sleeping in my arms."
"Don't," Harry said between heavy breaths, "touch," he was gasping and the cold air didn't help his raw, closing lungs, "me!"
"Does it matter?" Draco furrowed his eyebrow. Harry, offended, completely forgot Draco forgot, again. His heart wasn't with the situation, and it was too cold to change its mind.
"Pardon," Pumblechook questioned, wondering whether or not he was trying to be disrespectful.
Draco posed in his robe, the Slytherin colors complimenting him well. "Ready?"
Ron opened his mouth to argue, but then several loud bangs echoed throughout the room.
." Potter didn't break eye contact at all. "I'm not going to up and leave because you're not this stupid perfect image you hold yourself up to. I like your flaws, too. I like when you're goofy. I love your laugh."
Finally he was guided to a mirror who's edges were blackened and glass was dirty with ashes. Harry looked in the Mirror of Erised to see himself on one knee with a ring in his hand, Draco in front of him. Mirror-Draco nodded before jumping on Mirror-Harry and kissing him oh so deeply.
"The bad news..." Hermione bit her lip.
"Did you even think of the consequences of casting magic outside of school? How bloody stupid it is? You know you're not allowed, and you did it anyway! Showing off to your muggle family?"
"It's probably in the Room of Requirement still."
Draco stared at their hands and chills went down his spine. He swallowed, letting Harry continue his story in a curious silence, turning back to look at the blackening atmosphere.
look like? His
Snorting, Harry took Draco's hand playfully before letting it go. "We're lucky my friends don't know I'm gay. If they did, you'd be the dead giveaway."
"What are we going to do?"
"Thanks these bags are designer." Draco pointed to his lower eyes.
“What was that,” he bit.
"Yeah, well, he shouldn't be killing kids."
"So Potter, please do tell me what your point is. Trying to win me so you can force your tongue down my throat at all hours and we can raise little death eater children together? It won't work," Draco spoke, still smiling at the thought of that small man dancing.
"Who?" Harry's hands were shaking. He hid them behind his back so Draco wouldn't see.
"But accidental magic is vital to a growing wizard."
"No, she er... she already committed to a family friend before we started dating and she said it'd be hard for her to back out. Her family is strict. They wouldn't want her to be hanging around me, especially right now."
"I'm trying to make sense of your behavior! That's the only thing that could cause you to act like this!"
Harry nodded, grabbed his notes for his first lesson. "Ready."
Draco gripped the edge of the table. "Frankly, er, because I'm... really fucking gay."
"Would any of you like to volunteer to help me give these to him?"
Draco's face bent in question and fear. "What about the basilisk? Aren't there monsters?"
Draco shifted. "You know what you're getting into?"
"You're not forced to take it," Kingsley said.
Draco gripped the rail so hard his muscles burned, and he didn't even notice it.
"It wasn't a date," Harry argued, "I was seeing whether or not I liked the girl and I kinda did."
"What do you think of me? The truth," Harry asked.
"Take it if you must. Paying you off would be easy enough."
"I told you, it's a gift."
“Want to make a break for it?”
"It is. I'm safe. I feel safe. No one is going to hurt you or me or anyone. Katie was in Hogsmeade. Anyone could have done that to her. It probably was just a stray. I'm sure that Higgins is fine. We're going to be okay." Harry did his best to remain supportive and calm.
"That will come with time," Hermione said. "Everyone's first date is awkward."
"It... feel weird... everywhere. And it's only you.. It's been only you."
"Yeah, she is." Harry kissed Draco's forehead and continued rubbing his shoulders, arms, and back.
"Do tell," Harry said before putting his tongue inside again, trying not to think about how weird it was. It was a new experience for sure, but it was gratifying Draco and that's all that mattered.
"I told you, I want a proper proposal."
“I hate you,” Draco played as he splashed Harry, gasping for air, “bribing me and such.”
Harry nodded and accepted all of his apologies.
"Okay, I'll just say bye to everyone then."
Draco shook his head. He was actually enjoying this. "The superior ice cream flavor?"
Draco lifted his body and groaned as he did so due to his intense soreness; Harry kissed his abdomen, pulling the sweats up and over his arse and along his waist. Draco reached out and stroked his hair, which was almost dry and stuck out everywhere.
"I'm fine," he interjected with a much higher voice, blushing even worse, "Ignore me."
"You gave him your coat?"
in a cursive, poised handwriting, and the silver read
"You have a visitor," she said. "Mr. Malfoy claims to be with you."
"How did you think I went on the date with you after I got attacked by a dragon? You thought your cute attempts during our potions project sparked it? Really Draco?
"You read it when you were dating me." Harry looked back at him with a smirk.
"So you're just going to stay stuck here in the middle ground? And one day you're going to snap?"
"Ah! Yes! Fuck, Draco," Harry moaned, each throb an octave higher than the last. "Yes! Draco, Draco! I'm gonna- OH!" The blond gripped Harry's cock, him already so close to orgasm, it only took three thrusts for Harry to scream, uncontrollably, and cum. "AH!" His face is what caused Draco to go over the edge, like a wave, like a tsunami, and he too, orgasmed inside of him.
"Hm?" Draco turned and looked at him.
"But it's—"
"I won't turn you in or anything. Tell anyone about whatever happened if you don't want me to."
"7:20! Where have you two been?"
He was met with shaking heads. "Harry. The war is over. You cannot kill yourself over this. It's not romantic. It's not going to change him back. And even if it did, he'd live a life without you."
Draco smiled and uncontrollable elation sweeping over him. He laughed and wiped a tear from his eye, and held onto the grass for quite some time, thinking,
At breakfast just a little bit later, Draco was nibbling on a piece of toast peacefully when a tawny school owl perched itself right in front of his breakfast. It dropped a tiny roll of parchment precisely onto his plate, it’s feathers slapping his face once. He just smiled at the action and look up at Harry who was holding back a small giggle, instead of the predicted scoff.
“You are so whipped Harry,” Ron groaned.
"Yeah, sounds great." As he limped towards the door, Draco grabbed his shoulder. "Can you say it again?"
Draco cut through having to torture families as well, and Harry snuggled closer to him. They were full on cuddling now.
"Oh, but I do! I always have. I know I should have told you, but I wanted to make it special."
"Of course Hermione. I've had it for her since third year."
"Mr. Malfoy, you said you were convicted into being a death eater at 16."
But Draco held firm. "I'm not talking to you about this right now. You're not in the right frame of mind."
Harry didn't answer right away, and that said more than anything verbal. "It's not that simple of a question. There are other things, factors. Was he forced? Who was there? What has he done? Did he want to—Hermione, he's not. He wouldn't... My boyfriend of a year and eight months wouldn't be a Death Eater. A Death Eater couldn't just lay next to me after Sirius was murdered, after the Triwizard Tournament and be as scared as I was." But a Death Eater could lie to him all the time. Or so could an insecure or traumatized boyfriend. "There's something else."
Draco chuckled.
Draco couldn't explain his discomfort. It was so scary, hearing the words he'd begged to hear for years. It was almost too much to handle. "Don't beat yourself up, I would have gotten it, eventually."
Well... Not-Death-Eater Draco would take off all his clothes and have his way with him because
————————————————
Harry smiled. "Indeed. He really has changed though. With the memory loss, it was the worst pain either of us have ever felt, though, and this is the first time we've been apart since. He has this irrational fear that one day I'm going to realize that I'm going to find, how did he put it, 'a Swedish underwear model,' that is so much better than he is."
“Why would you do that, father,” Scorpius asked.
“Did he torture you?”
"I went to get you breakfast and I wanted to surprise you-"
Draco creased his eyebrows and went silent, the quiet biting at Harry. His lip quivered enough for Harry to see, and he stepped closer, begging the blonde to say something, anything. It was like sitting on knives waiting for words. The back of Harry's eyes watered, and the pure sight of his love standing in front of him was making it worse.
Lack of control comes from when your body forces you to feel it. That's why people numb it. The weight is too much to bear when you're not willing to feel it.
When done with their desserts, they moved to another room where they sat by the fire and told stories until midnight when Draco and Harry finally went to sleep on his pillow-top bed, draped over each other.
He'd never imagined—no, he doesn't have that. She was blowing this way out of proportion.
"I didn't do it because I felt sorry for you. Don't feel guilty. It's just clothes."
"Oh.. right," Draco looked at the floor," I.. I was a prat. I'm sorry about that."
"What," he laughed. "No, I mean about you."
The door opened and a quill was shoved against his chest, before it shut again, leaving Draco to turn to the staring students, and cheekily smile.
"So lucky to have you," Draco said, equally in awe.
"Well, I don't care because I'm the birthday boy and I get what I want on my birthday and I want to hang out with you."
Harry grabbed two spoons and gave one to Draco, and he put one full in his mouth, sucking on it, but even his throat burned, too. They licked the spoons, which reminded them of something else they'd done, and they couldn't help but giggle.
"Me either." Draco broke out into a smile, and stroked Harry's back, causing him to lie his head down with a sweet grin. Draco's heart fluttered at the sight of it. "Really." They looked into each others eyes for seconds more before Draco decided to tell him one of the many things that had happen to him over the past year. "Harry, do you remember the Mirror of Erised? How I saw you?"
"Oh shit," Dean shouted, and the room erupted in noise as the two got lost in each other. Harry wrapped his arms around his neck, Draco around his waist.  He gripped him harder, moving their hips together.
Harry put a hand on Draco's hip, doing nothing more than dragging kind fingers over the skin on his bone, around his arse, and down this thigh. Draco shivered to it again, reaching to stroke hair behind Harry's ear.
"My dear, who would want to attack children," Umbridge squeaked back, and Harry's jaw clenched, too.
The next morning, Draco banged his hand on Harry's door, only for Harry to answer it in his underwear, trying to put his trousers on.
Ron and Hermione turned back to find Harry gone. "Harry?"
Harry didn't answer, blushing, but he smiled to himself and found a pair of grey sweatpants and threw it at him, along with a red shirt.
“You’ve done your best, Harry. We practice all the time.”
Harry figured out that he never cared so much for Malfoy, the feeling was not from his charm or from his talk, but from the attention itself. The looks and his personality were just accessories to the real prize, and Harry fell in love with the person that wanted to get to know him, just as Malfoy planned.
“Because I have my Harry back. And I love him. And sometimes I love him so much it hurts.”
"Shove off, Malfoy," Harry sneered. "Just leave her alone." Insulting Draco had become a foreign affair. Since they planned everything out in time, they didn't need fast, just they needed quantity, and their limit of practice turn Harry slow and ineffective.
"There you are," Hermione scolded during lunch. "You can't just live in here."
"That doesn't make me stupid. And this person would be the literal worst nightmare I could imagine. We don't get along. We hate each other. He's... the reason I've suffered. It would be inappropriate and atrocious and... a betrayal to my family and to the side I fou—I think I fought for."
Potter looked down at his lips, and Draco thought that he was going to lean in. Draco's eyes fell closed, but he didn't feel anything right away.
"Study? I never thought I'd live to see the day where those words would come out of that mouth," Draco tapped him on the lips with a stray finger. "And to be the ferret I am, midnight would be tomorrow. Not tonight."
"What do you want Blaise?"
Draco blinked as he tried to wrap his head around it. "Wait, he's actually a rat?"
"Thank-yous are only permitted in a four-day period. No refunds, returns or exhanges."
"I don't need this right now okay! Just leave me alone!" Draco turned the door handle only to have it ripped away from him as Harry mustered all his strength and shoved him against the wall. "Harry!"
Harry rolled his eyes.
At the end of the path was a curtain made of thick vines that looked like rope.
"Funny, he says the same thing. See, you have some things in common already."
Draco swallowed, unsure if he should divulge such an advantage, but frankly, he couldn't care about anything anymore. His soulmate almost murdered him. What was the point in anything? "My Dark Mark tells me. Like your scar when The Dark Lord is near you. It's the same magic. You can't hide from me. Ever." He tried to pull a smirk but couldn't.
Draco nodded, his heart racing. Did he mess something up?
"Great, you too, now." A voice hissed—
"No, not yet."
“Alright, er- I thought he was the most selfish bastard I’d ever seen to be honest with you,” Harry bared his teeth.
And they couldn't wait to see each other.
"It might be a mess," Harry considered.
Harry nodded. "I know." And then there was silence for a while as they held each other. "I want to adopt Teddy one day. Andromeda said she wants me to wait, but if it was my choice..."
, Potter!"
"I'll meet you in the courtyard," Draco asked.
The blonde started laughing at his outrage silently, and then continued smiling at the thought of how in love with him he was. He felt a tear along his face and he wiped it away cheerfully before letting out a few, small sobs. "I-It's afternoon, Harry, not night," he glowed. In his head, Harry told him to fuck off. "God, I've missed you."
He waited for him at their special place, because he might as well get it done and over with.
"He knew all along I was supposed to die. Does that seem off to you?"
"Don't go making another promise you can't keep."
Harry just stood there wished he would return until Hermione snapped him out of it.
"I'm not saying yet," Harry smiled to himself and continued eating. He heard a groan coming from his friend's mouths.
Draco got an idea. A sinister one. "No, actually."
"How did you know you were gay?"
And then he exhaled as his body came down from it, Harry beneath him breathing heavily and moaning as his finished. Pleasure still filled them in the afterglow and Harry cast a wandless cleaning charm as Draco pulled out of him and crawled next to him, slinging an arm around him as they shared a sloppy, spark-filled, loving kiss.
"Dumbledore," Harry finished without second thought. "It was interesting. Nothing to really talk about, but interesting none the less. How was whatever you did?"
"You're not pushing me, I choose it," Harry said, but his voice cracked and it was easy to tell that it wasn't something Harry was up for right now. "I'm literally a piece of shit in every aspect of my life. Let me at least be adequate at something. Let me at least give you some form of pleasure—"
The room rang empty and silent, surprisingly, it being a Saturday. He couldn't tell what time of day it was. He lived in a dungeon with no sense of time. He could always check his watch, however he felt it be too much effort.
Draco snorted, "That's helpful." He disconnected himself slowly from Harry and searched, finding it on the floor by the door. He crawled off the bed, stumbling on the floor, his legs shaking due to his apprehension. He found his old wand cold and distant from him, but like home at the exact same time.
Harry stood. "This has been a great pep talk, really."
"You don't pay attention in charms do you," Blaise shook his head.
Because it made him hate Malfoy more.
"How was your day?"
"Got it."
"He likes clouds."
Harry just laughed. And Draco
"You sleep in silk pajamas?"
Draco winced. "Where's the cutlery?"
"With Harry Potter," Harry added in that bit.
Harry licked his lips. "Do you think my dad would accept Draco?"
"Er..." Harry blinked. "No. Sorry. I-I... I don't do autographs."
"Shut up," they both shouted simultaneously. Draco turned back to Harry.
"Harry, sleep. I'll probably fall asleep when you do."
"It was a really tough day. The outside world is so strange. There's celebration, but there's a lot of misery, too. Like Ron and Hermione. They're mourning Fred, but they're also dating. It's like this weird dichotomy of joy and horror everywhere."
"I think that those are his parents," Draco whispered into his ear.
It was soft and sweet. Harry was conscious of him and how much Draco was moving, and eventually put his hand on his chest, gripping his shirt.
February was drawing to a close, it was still a bit cold and snow barely fell. Of course Draco over packed, taking two jackets and a scarf as he stepped into the air, small flakes falling on his hood.
Harry leaned in towards Draco's mouth but Draco turned so Harry kissed his cheek instead, and rather than letting go, he moved down to his neck and kissed it lightly.
"Sometime sounds about right." Then Harry reached in his bag and pulled out his invisibility cloak. "Take it."
Harry nodded and made his way to his parent's headstone, his heart sinking as he did.
"Why not," Harry whined.
"No," she looked up at him with wide eyes. "Not at all. And I was pretty... stunned, you could say. At first I thought you were friends... but then, yeah... you're more."
"I want you naked," Draco shot up from his lips a second time. "I want you naked right now."
Potter took the package and ripped the paper, immediately grinning. "Snitch socks! And they're red! Thank you! These are amazing." Potter threw his arms around him and squeezed him tight. It was suffocating. "I'm absolutely going to wear these to the ball."
"Regardless if this is healthy or not for you," she continued, "if you don't want to be here, it won't work. Therapy is for people who want to work on themselves. And it takes work. In the meantime, I want to make sure you're still safe with yourself."
"Come on, you can make it though it," Harry called, kissing his hand. "I believe in you! Please Draco, please, I love you."
"It was great for its time, but there are better love stories out there. When you look at it from our time, Romeo was just an impatient moron who could have waited at his home for another ten minutes and cried there so he would have gotten the letter and it would have been okay. And besides, killing yourself over a three-day love affair is foolish. They could have easily found different loves and gotten married after having two conversations with someone else. How would they ever know if they truly loved each other? There are much better romances."
"Don't get me wrong, he loves you for taking care of me, but he's a bit afraid you'll beat him up for everything he's done wrong to this family. He doesn't want to be judged by his name rather who he is," Harry told. "And since you are my family, he's already nervous to meet you in general."
"Go find him. Please. I'll be okay." Hermione wiped her tears and half smiled.
Harry then drank the hot chocolate and had a few bites of the pumpkin pasty. It took effort to allow himself to enjoy this, but he did it. Because he should enjoy this. It was one of the first things that brought him joy in quite a while. "How was your day?"
"Probably. I told him one. I don't want to tell him anything else. He's probably feeding everything onto Weasley and Granger. Arse."
And Draco's hope rose for the first time in months. Could he really have a chance? "If I'm going to do this, I need him to fall back in love with me first. I've treated him like poorly for five months. I can't just run to him and be like, hey, let's get married. When do you think you can get the contract?"
Harry's mouth felt intensely sour ever since that day, as if he needed to scrub it with soap hundreds of times. Ever since he told Draco the terrible lie, everything had been at a constant. He constantly felt the sting of tears in his eyes he refused to fall. He constantly felt his throat closing up, and he rather didn't talk anyway. He constantly felt his heart burn with regret and sorrow, but something else that was constant, was the insults and bruises received from one, Draco Malfoy.
"—l will not have it that you be with this disgusting, Mudblood-loving tramp! I told you, I will do everything in my power to ensure that you two will never be together.
All of a sudden Harry flew upwards at a 90 degree angle and the woo's coming from Draco's mouth were now penetrating shrieks replaced by the wind. They went so high that if they looked down they could see the tip of the top of the highest tower.
Out of breath, Draco let go, but kissed down his jaw and his neck and he sucked on it as his hands let go and moved to his hips. His fingers found their way to the skin of Harry's abdomen, untucking  Harry's shirt, but he stopped when Harry kept talking. "Is that what it's like to kiss Astoria? Is that what it's like to love her?"
"I don't know! And I don't care! He's making this so hard on me. I'm trying to forget him and he's making it physically impossible!"
“Fine, I’ll write to her,” Draco finally spoke. Harry smiled and kissed his cheek. “Ah ah ah, don’t you think I should get more than that?”
"Yeah, I do."
"So I'm not supposed to tell people you asked me out?"
The two decided to continue to walk until a table familiar to Draco's memory appeared. The same trinkets lay there untouched, waiting to be played with.
Harry nodded.
"Merlin, get a room, you two," he joked as he shed the cloak.
“To do what,” Draco asked, raising a suggestive eyebrow.
"What? That's not possible!" Draco shoved Harry off of him as fast as he could. He must have been seeing fear. That's why his eyes changed..right? It definitely couldn't be because of the non exist any crush on Harry. Fear. That's what Draco told himself.
"Don't you dare start this. Why didn't you tell us he was poisoning your head again?" She crossed her arms.
However, in the two weeks they had together, there was a turning point. I wasn't completely awful, being together again.
"GO!"
"Excitement?" Potter shook his head. "Really?"
"Oh she's worse that awful! She's pure evil! I don't even think I have to worry about going home this summer; stupid Umbridge'll already prepare me for Voldemort! Ugh! I swear I'm going to kill her!" He kicked his wardrobe, causing the wood to dent, although it's not like he cared. Suddenly it got quiet. "What," he bit.
"You know Potter, I assumed you were above it all," Draco said calmly, and Harry had never been so repelled in his life, "Never thought you'd want some mudblood tongue."
"What about me?"
"Harry that's not... Harry, just forget what I said."
"Alright, before Christmas we had one last date before we had to go home and I told him I loved him, and he said he thought he loved me back," Harry raised an eyebrow, turning back to Draco.
"I said I want you to marry me," he said much much calmer, but his lip quivered.
"You know you love it."
Harry let out a dry laugh. "Right. You know, I thought that would have been the worst pain in my life, knowing you were a death eater, or seeing every father figure die right before my eyes, or even losing the most important people in my life to a bloody snake... nah... that's like a paper cut compared to this."
Harry nodded. "I'm so sorry. I do. I love you."
No, he wasn't excited to see Potter. Are you crazy? Potter's a pest.
"We were celebrating a win! I hugged everyone!"
"Of course."
So close.
"Draco," Harry's voice cracked, and his eyes stung.
Draco hadn't even begun to process his own trauma or grief or
They both blushed. "We haven't."
“No! There has to be a reason! Marry me, damn it!”
"You don't think you're attractive?"
"He's supposed to be protecting you-"
"Absolutely. And even if he did, he wouldn't understand it. That's his disadvantage."
“I lie.”
"We should give each other massages tonight. Like we used to," Harry said.
"We want to keep it a se-"
"Good idea," Harry said.
"I've got to say, Draco, you're pretty sluggish tonight... or maybe it's just that- how did you put it- your inerudite recuperation skills are that of an ignoramus."
"I-I could've guessed that on my own."
"Thank you," Arthur answered. "So Draco, how have you been? You were visiting your mother?"
"You can stay here, I'll deal with Walburga."
"Not after you lie to me about failing your Herbology test!"
Harry wondered why he never even acknowledged him, but then reminded himself it was a disclosed relationship and if he did, suspicions could rise. Anything to act as if they hated each other.
“Thank you, Professor,” Draco said.
"Yeah?"
"Actually I'm heading to the library," Harry said bringing his fingers through his hair, slowly.
"Did you break into my Manor?"
"Ha, yeah I did, and I got away with it too," Draco snickered and Harry laughed. "I'm sorry. I had to tell him this. I didn't know how else to keep him from going after your friends or you during the summer."
"Someone has to tell Harry," he tried to get up, but every limb in his body was screaming. "Someone has to tell the Order. I need to help—"
It took a bit to get used to.
"I was fine, Draco, really!"
"Stop trying to change the subject!"
Draco frowned. "No."
Draco didn’t say anything, his heart heavy. And he had a bad feeling. “I’m sorry. It was stupid.”
Harry looked up to see the rest of the family amused as his cheeks flushed. Hermione continued. Percy, Bill and Fleur, along with Charlie all walked in and sat quietly.
"What if you don't have the stamina? The strength to wait."
"You're really picking him over me?"
"I want you," Harry's eyes dilated. "So much."
Harry and Draco sat across from each other, legs criss crossed on the floor near the fire place, chatting about their week and how things were going before exchanging gifts. There was a plate of tarts, pasties, and treats laying on the table next to them, complimented by two cups of hot chocolate.
"Save him," she corrected. "You have to look at it that way."
Then he rushed to his bed and shoved his face into his pillow, hugging it tightly.
"Are those your own words?" Draco raised an eyebrow.
"That is a secret!"
Blaise snickered, and Snape acted as though it was Draco.
Fuck. "Gladly."
. Ron and Hermione might die, too.
"I didn't see him in the hall at all," he lied.
"Do you want to?"
"Don't stop," he moaned, throwing his head back, grasping onto Draco's hand harder. "Faster! Please, harder... faster!"
A few days after their time spent in the Chamber of Secrets, Harry had a realization that paralyzed him. It was in the middle of potions. His skin turned pale, his face showed his haunts more than he would have liked them to.
"I don't want to hear the words 'potions' 'defense' 'charms' 'transfiguration'—We're not talking about school anymore." Draco gave an exhausted laugh and threw his notes to the side. He crawled next to Harry and planted a kiss on his cheek and then on his lips. "I want to do something fun."
"It's how we met," Harry clarified, "and how we fell in love. I know we told you that we didn't know each other at all during our years at Hogwarts and met when we came back to take our NEWTS."
Harry nodded. "Same with Nigel. He's just a kid, but he did great."
." Draco's eyes narrowed.
“Absolutely,” Hermione said, “That and considering the fact that the bathroom is in here, we’ll have to play it off that he didn’t go see him.”
“Oh Merlin, I don’t want to know,” Pansy heaved as if she wanted to throw up and covered her ears, running away with Blaise hand in hand. The almost-newlyweds just chuckled.
They shared a bed together before Christmas. Harry slept next to that man. Harry remembered his hand in his hair, next to his neck. His neck. Draco could have choked him, suffocated him with a pillow. He could have used Avada Kedavra- had Draco ever used an unforgivable?
Can't wait to see you. Missing you.
Molly came to the door and Arthur saw that the rest of their family was on the couch. It was getting dark, and was probably late.
"Y-you're amazing, Harry," Draco gasped into the kiss, his hand on Harry's arse, squeezing it.
"Are you thinking about it right now?"
"Mr. Potter-"
"Just listen, will you," Draco started up again, "We felt like it would be better if we kept if from you until you both were older."
"Nine steps?"
"I miss our special place in the forest. I haven't gone back, because I just know I can't handle it. I miss our competitions and exchanging gifts at Christmas time. I miss reading the time wrong just to piss you off. I miss our picnics and swimming even though we only did that like once and you ran away half way though because you saw a grindylow.
"You haven't failed yet. He's just stubborn and confused. And the old Malfoy would never ask for help. He'd just sulk."
"I'm a liar," Draco wept into his neck. "I'm fake, I'm a liar, and I'm lying! I can't let you go." He grabbed Harry's chin and spoke into his eyes. "You're amazing and charming and you're the only thing I care about. You make me happy, Harry, you make me so happy!"
"Thank you, Professor, I will," Harry beamed back at him before pulling Draco out of them room.
"Ehh... It depends on the day," Harry laughed, and Draco grabbed his hand. Harry's was sweaty, but the soft sweaty, the nice sweat. His arms heated. There was an awkward silence. They'd had a few of those, unsure as to what the other was to say, unsure if they should fill the silence. But sometimes that was reassuring, that everything wasn't perfect. It made it mundane, and Harry liked mundane in the words of human. For once he felt normal, and maybe that was why his heart was racing.
"I'll tell you about it later," Harry frowned. He really didn't want to talk about. He didn't want to talk about the dementors or about Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia or Dudley or Dudley's rotten friends or his nightmares or Lord Voldemort any other thing that made his life a living hell. He just wanted Draco.
It was like a miracle.
He kissed his forehead and Harry woke, though he didn't want to. He had sleepy eyes as he leant up and pecked Draco. "Morning, Ferret."
Harry curled into a ball. "I'm not going," he whimpered. His hands were shaking.
“Awesome, I’ll go tell Angelina,” and with that Ron left with excitement swimming in the air.
“Maybe… So when are you going to propose to me for real?” The girl grew ridiculously excited and it made Draco want to spell her face off. Draco took a long deep breath. He knew the contract was in place and he had to follow it all he could until he walked to their parents. Although, if Astoria agreed, there was a possibility he could extend it.
"Fine."
————————————————
"You can't go anywhere near Malfoy Manor. They have the radius of it filled with nature, for at least fifty kilometers."
"Nope." Harry added enfaces on the p. "You need to get up yourself." Draco rolled his eyes and grabbed the edge of the bed, helping himself up.
!" More tears fell from Draco's eyes.
And Draco wasn't here to help calm him down.
"Hm? Sleep overs? Do tell."
"If anyone's a pest, it's you, Malfoy," Harry responded, still feeling resented anger from the Yule Ball. The Gryffindor gazed into Draco's eyes as he looked back up at him. Harry could practically smell Draco's nerves since they were so on fire.
"What?"
"What," Pansy's eyes widened. "Your father knows about him?" Her heart raced and she sat up in anticipation, leaning her elbows on her knees. "You're still alive?"
Harry didn't say anything. He froze. With a pale face and quivering lips, he stared at him, to afraid to move, but he did anyway, and a hand reached out to his cheek, and he saw that Draco was crying. "What?"
Draco nodded. "I swear it was one. It was hard to see, but he's been really smiley the past few days and I saw him scratch his neck and pull his collar back... it was there and we caught eyes with each other and he got up and went to the bathroom. I think he healed it."
Harry mouthed it again, Draco the same reaction. Harry rolled his eyes before grabbing a quill from his bag, scribbling on the back of the note. He mouthed, “Potions,” leaving Draco to wait impatiently for the reply. Merlin, he’d been screwing up.
Draco looked back up at Harry as if it was the first sunrise he’d ever seen, wonder within his irises. “Okay,” he said before leaning back on his shoulder, only to kiss it first.
"No," Draco said, "Because I'm with you." He swallowed. "I'm anxious. Not scared."
It was two a.m. when the demons were hunting and stalking, he felt Harry shift and a squeak escaped his throat. The boy opened his eyes and Draco watched him do so. Harry, upon looking at him, smiled immediately.
A wave of nausea spread over Draco.
It was the first time Harry had taken a look in his own dorm. The initials on the door matched Harry and Ron's names in gold letters. Hermione was in the room next to them, and two doors down, Draco's and Blaise's.
"He has?"
With shaking hands, he pulled off his sweater vest and threw it to the side, only to collapse onto the stone sink with tears uncontrollably falling down his face.
"Got you," he smiled. Draco was smiling at Harry's smile and looked into his eyes but Harry was far too occupied and had his eyes on Draco's lips. Their heavy breathing calmed down in large huffs. "May I kiss you?"
Draco smirked at this. "And what exactly will we be saying tonight?"
“Would you stop beating yourself up about it, that was the point,” Harry looked into Draco’s troubled eyes for a long while.
As Harry searched for ink and a quill, Draco furrowed his eyebrow curiously and roamed the halls. Once Harry found one, he stared at blank paper for several moments, and in his thought, the sudden sound of music rooms down made his heart swell.
"So 'let's just go try it out on Draco Malfoy next time I see him, since I absolutely hate him and want him gone,' sounds right.."
She went in first, and Draco waited several minutes to make sure that no one went in or out. Then he slithered inside.
He spread out all his books and papers neatly, a quill and parchment in the middle of it all. He picked the book on top and began to read about the properties of gillyweed, quill in his left hand and his right hand was holding down the paper loosely, he began to copy down notes.
Harry couldn't physically answer that question. When he opened his mouth, his lips quivered so much he couldn't even speak, and he held up four fingers. Harry broke down; he couldn't help it, and Draco rushed to his side, hugging him.
He looked over at the emerald box. It withheld a red bow and a silver tag with golden handwriting.
"Yup. Just good luck swimming in my bloodstream," he shrugged his shoulders. "I have a life expectancy of negative fourteen considering I was to supposed die about five times already." Draco laughed and laughed hard, throwing his head back so Harry could see the lines of his throat. He was mesmerized by them. Harry decided he liked Draco's laugh... a lot. "What's so funny?"
"I would very much like to see that, too, dear old mate," Harry smiled warmly at him and took out his wand from under his robe.
"Thank you for that," Harry continued smiling. "That was... really great. I had no idea you were so talented."
“Harry, I can feel it,” Draco refused to leave their deadlock stare.
Although smiling, Harry sniffed as Draco's eyes flashed colors numerously.
"Then tell me," Draco mumbled back, letting go of him.
————————————————
"Now what was that you wanted to ask me?" Draco's platinum hair teased and tickled Harry's forehead.
“It does,” Harry smiled, bumping into him. “And since it does, we should make a bet out of it.”
"SHUT UP!" That hit a nerve, and Harry could only smirk, ready to test further but was interrupted by a droning, yet scolding, voice from behind him.
"The whole thing?"
They met up with Hermione, who'd finished her Ancient Runes exam before anyone else. Ron told her the story of Trelawney and Malfoy laughing, but Harry was too happy to pay attention. He lagged several feet behind them, strolling instead of matching their rushed pace to get to food first.
"Harry, it's fine," Draco pulled him along to the next room, which was the Drawing Room. "Now if some of our guests do remember, this is where I was called upon to identify the notorious and big headed Harry Potter. I, in fact, lied to my lunatic Aunt who then went on an undomesticated rampage before I knew it, I had lost my boyfriend once again, it being the first time I'd seen him in a year."
"Not too much," Draco sat up and crossed his legs, leaving Harry wanting to put his head in Draco's lap, so he did. At first, Draco was startled, however he adjusted to the touch and he absently stroked Harry's hair, the light autumn breeze just waving in. Leaves ruffled as white noise and the smell of grass sprang fresh in the air. Small waves crashed on the bank. "Normally my mother stresses out about it and I can hear something crashing in the kitchen or my parents arguing. I try and go back to sleep though."
"Red," Draco cried. "Red's bad, isn't it?"
I'm a murderer! I'm a
The small woman healer came out with a look of heartbreak on her face. She couldn’t speak. Draco’s lips quivers and he lifted himself up from the floor shakily. He didn’t even know how he was walking, but he was.
"Oh my Merlin, Potter—" Draco threw down his quill and began to stare at Harry, and Harry did the same, "it's not my fault I'm left-handed!"
"Oi, that's not mine. It was in your spot." Blaise shoved it back.
"Rugby, Cricket, Futball. But they're all on the ground, and they use their feet or their arms. It's similar."
, Draco thought.
Harry's eyebrows raised as high as they could go. "Really?"
“What did you do?”
"No." Draco kissed his nose.
Fuck, this was the stupid part of Pansy's scheme.
"Harry, please, why are we here," Draco looked terrified again.
"Sirius isn't! He's dead, Draco! Bellatrix killed him!" He broke down in a sob again, tightening his grip around his waist. Draco grew more and more angry at the fact his aunt was the one to put Harry through this pain, to end the life of an innocent man. He let Harry end his round of waterworks patiently, however it was in a sour silence. "He should be here right now!"
He winced, hiding under the covers, as if the only way to keep everyone from hearing his thoughts was to hide under his pillow.
It was hard. It was all so fucking hard.
Wiping water drops off his face furiously, a hand covered his eyes and another pulled him back behind an alcove.
He did his best to stay calm and normal, but Harry's heart accelerated and his face had gone pale. Draco could tell by his breathing. "It's okay, we're okay."
"Think of it as if you are helping him and in the long run it will work out."
But Harry didn't want them to answer because he already knew it. Maybe because they were never supposed to be together in the first place.
"Since you won't tell me. If it's really nothing, then we just forget about it. But, if I catch what you and your friend are doing by spring, then I win, and if I don't, you win."
"Harry, I could never judge you about you being starved. You can always talk to me about this. I'll be on your shoulder. I'll never judge you."
"Hey you slipped on one too!" Harry took a pillow from the bed a whacked him with it, and to be honest, Draco didn't know what was coming!
"I learned some sort of lubricant charm in 6th year. I just don't have a wand," Draco said.
"Don't you want to see what they were like? Look, it probably was some stupid ball or something."
"Yes, they do!"
"Cosmetologist?"
. Harry wrote it four times throughout the book, and it broke Draco's heart. It must've been so hard for Harry to write these things, let alone give them to Draco. If Harry knew the type of thoughts Draco was having... he would have been mortified.
Harry took only one bite of his egg sandwich in the hope that if he ate a smaller amount that the universe would balance out and Draco would remember him sooner. He threw on some clothes. When he rushed through the halls with Ron, he did his best to think about First, Second, and Third Year when he was excited about going to class. When it was a normal thing. He held on to the memories and excitement so tight his knuckles turned white. It was the only thing keeping him from seeing dead bodies on the floor.
Harry smiled but shuttered so bad his teeth clattered. Draco tried rubbing his arms to generate some heat. Then, he let go of Harry carefully and cast another heating charm. "Better."
Harry had to stay at the Weasley's. Because in between panic attacks and bouts of deep, icy depression, Harry could see the ghosts of their past selves, spinning around corners and laughing in the kitchen, sharing kisses and too many hugs to count, giving each other such superlative pleasure. He could still smell Draco in the sheets until he couldn't. He could feel his hands over his skin until he couldn't. He could remember the comfort Draco's touch gave him until he couldn't.
"Wait," Draco shouted almost too fast for himself to comprehend. Harry just paused and stared at the blonde for what seemed like centuries. This way he could examine Draco's features. They were tense: his eye brows furrowed, his lips turned in, and his eyes shrunk and small. They were a stunning silver, his eyes, and could melt even the coldest of chocolate, and Harry found himself turning to cocoa.
"Only if you wanted to. I don't want to make you uncomfortable."
------------------------------------
"Harry," Draco stopped him.
"If you go with me I never will say one word to you after it's over. Never. Not one."
Harry furrowed his eyebrow but then just relaxed about it, "Probably in his room getting ready. He said he'd meet me in Transfiguration."
"Good. I have to warn you," she addressed Harry, "there's an adjustment period for being back at Hogwarts. How's your mental health?"
Draco dove forward, and they flew through the cloud, their stomach flipping at the sudden drop. And Potter laughed in his ear.
As the room emptied, Voldemort stood. "Bellatrix. Get him ready."
He swallowed, his stomach burning again. He suppressed the urge to puke. How fucking silly of Harry. Of course they would. "I just can't believe we've lasted so long."
"I absolutely loathe her, Longbottom," Draco looked him in the eye as if he respected him for once.
"Why not?"
He immediately smiled and put his head on his arm. "Me either. Have you found anything," he asked as he drew hearts over his choice.
"And yours?"
"You're interesting."
"No, Potter! You let go of me." Harry tightened his grip and used his other hand to take away Draco's that was covering his face.
"So?" She whacked him with the copy she had in her hand. "What!?"
"He'll be thrilled to see me," Draco argued. "You have no idea who we are together!"
"I didn't cheat on you! She kissed me for ten seconds--"
Draco forced himself.
"I'm excited for my life with you." He thought of the plans they had stored in their trunks, plans of the orphanage, plans of the house they were going to scope out to buy and renovate. "And I know I'll be back. But yeah... who am I without this place?"
"Don't do anything stupid," Blaise said, and they left.
Harry immediately shot up and finally looked him in the eyes, his own tears waiting to be freed blocking his view.
"Because you're doing it wrong," Draco equaled his tone, stirring it the proper way. "You're not tanking my grade if I can help it."
"He said I could turn it in tonight."
"Missed me much," Harry smiled while Draco buried his nose in his neck.
Then, a sudden crack, and the sound of the floor moving: the stone in the middle spread and up came a cage, similar to Igor Karkaroff when Harry watched his trial during Dumbledore's dream in Fourth Year.
“Not letting that happen,” Draco yelled before taking off searching again.
want to hit my boyfriend. But it was like I... I couldn't stop, I..." He shook his head, his eyes glossy. "I don't know what's going on with me."
"Are you okay," Pansy asked and Draco turned his head towards her.
"Harry!"
Harry nodded.
Draco's heart beat faster than it ever had before, but Harry's frantic gasps woke him from his trance. "You need to get to the hospital. Here," Draco picked him up bridal style, and Harry howled.
"Really?"
There was a tightness in his throat. "Because you're not just my boyfriend, you're my friend and I want you to be happy. If you're not happy—"
And then Harry fell to his knees because he wanted Draco
"He's having flashbacks from the war," Hermione answered before the professional even had a chance to speak.
"Did you ever think that I deserved Azkaban? After everything I did?"
"Completely. What do I have to lose?"
"Yeah. And visualizing it as Umbridge helps. But I'm just sick of this voice constantly there. It's exhausting. It never goes away. It's smaller but... still annoying."
There was another row with things like
"You can't marry her," he whispered, his voice shaky. "You don't love her. You love me."
They were silent a bit, looking out into the sunset, and then they turned to look at each other, thinking the exact same thing.
Harry could hear, but couldn't see, for his eyes were droopy and it was a war to keep them open. He was so far from consciousness he felt like he was falling. He barely moved his head and the second he did, Madam Pomfrey ran to her supply cabinet, grabbing multiple vials of liquid. From what they could speculate, about half were for sleep, and a few tonics to calm him down.
They took him back to Mrs. Weasley. "I think its time you went into Kingsley's Restorative Program."
He tried to envision him hold hands with Malfoy, looking into his beaut- cold silver eyes..... did he just almost say beautiful? No no no, he did not!
Potter was looking at Diggory. Not Draco.
"Draco, talk to me. What's on your mind," Harry asked. He took Draco's hand. "I could never hurt you."
Draco bit his lip and pulled his knees to his chest. For once, he truly hated being a Malfoy, but by doing so, he felt lost. For once, he didn't agree with his family choices. For once, he absolutely felt isolated from himself.
"He was a great guy, and he was a reason worth fighting for."
It was raw but welcoming; new but familiar; protective but calamitous and amorous and wholehearted.
"Age?"
"I'm fine," he bit, just wishing Harry would show up. Draco sat there again, taking a stick from his overgrown shrub and playing with it. When the clock stroke 1:30 from inside, he could hear it, but not see Harry at the gates. He sat up a bit, and five minutes later still no Harry. The door opened behind him but he still stared at the gate waiting for Harry to get there.
Draco paused. His cheeks were flushed. Frankly, he didn't know how far Harry would let him go. This was beyond any expectations he had. "Damn it. No."
Harry grew jealous of the way that Draco walked. He seemed to float whilst Harry stepped like a baboon.
"No thanks, I'm good," Ron strained.
They spoke of Quidditch the rest of the night, but Harry couldn't keep his mind on it. Instead, he kept wondering, why would Draco go to the Room of Requirement?
"You," Draco said. "You're good with Nott. I'm sure you'll do just as good with Potter."
"Would you move your arm?"
It was still darkness that covered the land. The candles had been blown out, probably by Draco, the table was gone, everything but the blanket he was just laying on. It truely was a beautiful place. The stars were burning out yet again, the moon was relfected on the water and was slowly saying goodbye, the grass was.. well, grass, the leaves dead, ready to be reborn, just as Harry wished he could be.
He took his pulse. "Congestive heart failure. Mr. Malfoy, I need you to go to St. Mungo's and find Dr. Williams."
"Each of you will write an essay on why violence is prohibited and what you will do to ensure that you will never behave this way again. It must be two rolls of parchment with standard margins." She ignored their huffs. "After you complete it, you will clean the floors and the desks by hand, no magic allowed. I'll be taking both your wands."
Draco snorted and looked him up and down. "Most powerful wizard alive. Aren't you in a hospital because you can't even eat properly? Can't most toddlers do that?"
"This is a nice place to think," Harry said quietly as they made their way through piles and piles of knacks and toys and furniture.
This wasn't discipline. This was harmful.
"You right. Goodnight," Harry said kissing Draco's forehead and rolling over onto his side of the bed, facing away.
"Probably just the wind,"  he said, and Harry turned back to Draco. It would be horrific for the plan to end now. Things were going so well. "I didn't know your eyes were green."
. Oh my God, remember the Cho Chang incident and you held me up against the wall because you were jealous."
It wasn't just strange; it was
"I'm sorry. I tried to get out of it, but Umbridge made me."
"I'm fine, why? Why the hell am I on the floor," he said, completely ignorant to the event that just occurred.
Draco took a sip of tea, the warmth helping him a bit. "I worry all the time. About everything. I just wish I knew if this was going to work out in the end."
"Oh my God."
————————————————
The boy continued talking as Draco went for his wand, grabbing it loosely in his hand he cried out "redikkulus!" The horrid Harry twisted itself back inside the false cabinet, shutting the door on its way in.
"You've lost your parents. So many people, Harry. You know what it feels like."
Then Harry kissed a sensitive part on his neck and bit it.
"Leave it, it looks cute like that."
"Whatever you say," Harry replied, rolling his eyes.
Damn, was Harry's voice bloody hot when he was angry, Draco concluded. He sat away from him, enjoying all of it. "That's my boyfriend," he said under his breath.
Harry raised an eyebrow before hissing, "
"Sorry," Harry smiled, looking at his neck. "I was just admiring the ones I gave you."
"Why!"
"I didn't know she gave that to you."
"For the last time, you'll be fine," Draco reassured, leaning back and kissing Harry softly.
----------------------------
"Well, that could be," Harry pointed to a weird circle which really didn't look like a circle, "a whale."
The bell rang on the door, and Harry looked up to see Draco walking in. The room got quieter and few dirty looks were given. Draco ducked his head and went straight for counter, Harry watched him basically the whole time as he talked to the clerk.
"If you need to spend less time with me," Draco offered innocently. "I'd be sad to not see you, though."
"You're not. You're going to go back home right now!"
Draco smirked down at him and then kissed him on the lips. You'd think after all the kisses they'd shared, they'd be desensitized to it, but no. It still felt so amazing. Dizzying.
"What? Cupboard? What," Draco hissed.
"Oh, this one is a good one, but you might not like it. It's kind of mean."
“You pay so much attention to detail, this is going to take years,” Harry teased, earning a whack of the back of Draco’s hand on his chest.
"We were just coming to check on you," Neville spoke.
There was a box sitting on the locker room bench, wrapped in a bow. Harry smiled and unwrapped it, revealing brand new Quidditch gloves and a note that read six more days.
"Can't wait," Draco grinned and kissed the top of his forehead. They shared a sweet but empty silence.
In the morning, he woke to Draco nuzzling him from behind, his nose on the nape of his neck and an arm wrapped around him.
They read the first stanza silently before Draco interrupted.
"You are," Draco sighed, catching his breath, "remotely. I loved my birthday present by the way. I didn't know you could be such an amazing poet." Harry smiled, biting his lip with a blush, and walked towards the lake with his hands in his pocket. Draco followed him, wrapping his arms around him from behind. "You should be a professional," he said.
"Can you get me a towel?"
"I was going to tell you we were soulmates in that letter, but then..."
"See, that's it. That's all we have to do."
"Well, that wasn't as bad as I thought. Good match, Potter."
He eventually backed away, rubbing the snot from his nose on his sleeve before scrunching it and showing her his arm.
"Yes. Now can you please write my essay for me," Harry bared his teeth.
That was an easy one.
But then they rushed out, knowing Narcissa must've been watching them.
"Yeah," he bit his lip. Silence came again.
"What? We just explained the whole thing," Draco rolled his eyes.
He kissed down his neck, bit down hard on his sweet spot, and sucked. Draco made a noise that went straight to Harry’s groin, and his body reacted… well, his body did not react smoothly. He jerks his hips against Harrys, and Harry shoved a leg in between his, so the friction of their thighs rubbing together could drive them both crazy.
Draco picked one up from off the ground, hit him with it again, unrolled it, and shoved it in front of him. Harry's own face was scrunched and bent. The moving picture showed him leaving his trial. "I've waited two months to see you. I laid as low as possible. I kept out of trouble. I was excited every. single. night. thinking about seeing you again. Beyond anything I've ever felt. This is how you repay me? An expulsion trial!"
He knew he had to get Draco back the entire time during his memory loss, but he'd forgotten how much fun it was to be with him, and it'd been so long since he'd smiled about it.
"It was more than a slap, it was like being hit with an unforgivable."
"Show me?"
“Draco, no!”
"What?" Draco turned and grabbed the parchment out of his hand. Instead of "
It had to have been! Hermione didn't know about Draco in real life—this was it! This was the flaw in the nightmare. He'd wake up and everything would be okay!
He was so excited that everyone else was excited to start the DA—he couldn't help but want to invite Draco. Draco would love it.
Harry would hate him, just as much as he hated himself—and that was a fucking terrifying thought.
Draco rubbed his face. "What?" Then, Draco realized what he was doing, looking at himself in the mirror. "I wasn't thinking that at all."
"Could you teach me?"
And it was horrible.
------------------
Draco nodded. "Let's go over it again."
"Anyway," Harry started again, "although we were together there was still a lot of conflict. Since Draco was a Malfoy and had the mark, he was wanted for askaban. We decided to run away together because there was no way in hell I was letting him go again. Before the night we wanted to leave, I decided to say goodbye to the Weasley's since they were my second family. Well at the same time, Minister Shacklebolt wanted to offer me a job and talk to me."
"You're not going stay? What if he..."
That was four years ago.
Draco kicked off the bed and ran to the kitchen, Harry's voice echoing through the halls as he grabbed the biggest pot he could find and cast an
"They've cut off the grounds," Granger said. "looks like they're building a maze if you look from the North Tower. You don't know what you're going to face in there, you need to prepare for the worst."
Harry started flipping through the pages of the diary, figuring he should make sure there weren't any spare pictures hiding in the bidding. The loose piece fell out as he did.
"No, it's just..." Harry went weak at Draco kissing his neck and loosening his grip slightly so that he was embracing him instead of struggling with him.
“By the power of your love and commitment, and the power vested in me,” Kingsley smiled, “I now pronounce you husband and husband! You may now… keep making out with each other…”
"Yes, my Lord." Lucius's voice was raspy and weak.
"I feel uncomfortable now."
"That was pathetic," he snorted, his arms crossed. Potter jumped, having to put his hand against the rail to keep from slipping on the snowy steps. Then Potter smiled.
It set Draco's cheeks red.
When he opened it, he was forced back due to an unseen force, and dust was thrown everywhere, forcing him to shield his eyes. He started coughing and he stood, only to find Harry standing above him when he opened his eyes.
“You call a rough patch not speaking to each other, not seeing each other, not even being able to think about each other without getting angry.”
"We are-"
"Thanks, Draco, that's a boost of self esteem," Harry said with a glint of humor. "It's probably because you're not used to it."
It wasn't fair. Harry got to be himself. He had less invested in this.
As for Harry, he refused to even look any direction towards the ferret. His plan went well and now he was on the road of recovery to back to hating Draco, and even with his feelings still slightly present, it was a smooth drive.
Draco was holding him. And he wasn't sure why that was such a revolutionary thing, but it was.
Harry's head fell back but his eyes remained fixed on Draco, enjoying his body, the slight smile on his face in unison with pleasure. Fuck, they were so happy to be able to do this again.
Harry felt if he were to throw up right there.
"But I like seeing your face," Harry said. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco before Draco even asked him to, and snuggled up to him, making Draco's heart shiver. Harry's body so close to him felt comfortable and right and like home more than Hogwarts or his own bedroom at the Manor.
"Draco," Potter said, backing off of him just enough so they could see each other. The sheer use of his own name coming out of Potter's mouth did something to Draco that he couldn't understand. "You're not weak because you feel. You're not weak because you laugh or you smile. I promise. There's nothing wrong with you for doing any of those things. He's wrong."
"It's you?"
"Ron," Hermione spoke in a tone as if to say
Harry was silent a bit and just stared into those deep mercury eyes, swimming in them. His throat burned and eyes watered. "I mean if that's what you want. It's not like I'm going to keep you in a relationship you aren't happy in."
, he thought. But he didn't want to ruin the surprise, though this would have been a perfect moment. No, he had a thousand roses already being shipped. The time will come. But he thought it in his head,
"You know," he said in a dark, heated voice, "what they say about albino cobras, Potter?"
"Why not?"
He only rolled over when he heard the door open from his bathroom.
"Nervous at all," Remus asked.
"You're not alone. I'm here."
"Yeah, sure," Draco bit his lip with an attitude. "It's just... I've never done this stuff before."
"Oh Merlin, a Gryffindork! I'm falling for a damned Gryffindork!"
"Black eye? She must be strong then! Does she play quidditch?"
Harry's eyes automatically trailed to his left arm which was still hidden.
If Harry was here, he would know what to do right? What if that was Harry?
"Apparently not," Draco answered for him. Harry took his hand under the table and squeezed it. Draco knew he was smiling under that damned cloak, and the thought almost made him smile, but a girl walked up to him and the overwhelming urge to vomit came back.
"Hey you," Harry said back, walking over to him. He put his bleeding hand behind his back out of habit.
"No," Draco's voice broke.
"H-How does that happen?"
"You did."
Harry, in attempts to hide his face, buried it in Draco's neck until he felt the heat dissipate slightly. He bit his lip when he asked, "Last night happened?"
"What," she spun on her heels with wide eyes to find Draco standing, his arms crossed. "He said
"Listen, I don't know what you're up to with Harry, but it's not right. I know you poisoned him somehow. Why? Fame? His fortune?"
Because he realized how much he'd changed for Harry, and how much he opened up to the idea of romance and caring and friendship. Harry was the center point for all of those things; he didn't have anyone else in the world that he cared for besides Harry.
But Draco didn't know that Harry wanted to tell him that soon. There was a difference between taking small steps (ex. We should all get along and tolerate each other, and revealing sexuality in a room of people who were accepting) versus telling them an almost four year long, complicated relationship during a war where Draco had to torture people while be in love with Harry when most of the people in this room actually hated Draco because they were victims of his bullying and eventual torture. Especially when Harry was still navigating his treatment and his disorder.
"I always thought I was until I came here, to Hogwarts."
Draco's face fell. "S-someone kissed you," he spoke very quietly. Harry bit his lip watching the pain creep up onto Draco's face as pictures of Harry kissing someone else haunted his thoughts. "Someone kissed you. Someone who wasn't me."
"Oh please," Draco snorted, "Like I would ever cheat my bloody soulmate, even if I was a Slytherin, which is the house our kids are going to end up in."
"It's you?"
"Thank you very much. Now you need to supply food. You need to take care of him and make him feel good. I knew you were too selfish to do that so I got a picnic basket for you an-"
"They expire... well, I don't know the date but they're getting old. I don't know how much they'll hold up. It says February 28th on the tin—"
"I wouldn't say a lot-"
"How much I just—
When they reached the Room of Hidden Things in silence and unnoticed to the empty hall, Draco put him down, walked three paces, picked him back up, and took him inside.
"Stop lying to me. Your eyes are different color. That must mean-"
Draco ran his right hand through his hair, wiping his face. The comment made his stomach boil. He didn't know whether to be happy Harry made it or not. Harry stood as well, Draco realizing how close to naked he was. His briefs were soaked and clung to his skin and--
"Really?"
“Do you want to wear each other’s ties? You know, to make it…cute,” Harry wondered.
"I'll take them," Draco smiled up at him, grabbing Harry by his neck and opening his own to his lips. Draco bumped his nose with him as Harry climbed on top of him. "Ow," Draco hissed, reaching for Harry's zipper. "Get your denim off!"
"Nothing. I'm fine. It was stupid. I shouldn't have said anything."
She nodded and was quiet a bit before speaking again. "Thank you."
“I love you too, ferret.”
A few days later, Draco thrashed and kicked in his sleep.
When Neville arrived, he brought a tray filled with two pies. One in case the winner (cough cough Ron cough) missed. They were almost done, and the odds could go either way, but when there was "Checkmate," the whole world went quiet.
“TELL ME YOU UNDERSTAND,” Draco erupted. He felt betray that Harry could even think that Draco would do this on purpose. His hands were shaking and eyes teared up. “Harry, I could never,” he broke down into a cracked whisper, “I could never want to do this to you, especially after what we went through with war.”
"Hey it's fine, don't worry about it." Harry was completely honest, he didn't really care. Harry threw the towels he used in a trash can and picked up a fresh warm one. Finishing his business, he looked up to see Draco with a deep frown on his face.
"Oh," she laughed. "This is great. You're in for it." Then, he hit his forehead up against his knee. "By the way, you should probably wear steel toe shoes in case Potter gets angry with you."
Harry grinned, and then thought out loud. "I'm glad we waited."
"Okay okay, I'm nervous too," Harry admitted, scooting closer to Draco so their legs were touching, and Draco put a leg though Harry's warm ones, tangling them. "I just didn't think this day would come, you know? I mean I've been thinking about this since- what?- sixth year?"
"Congratulations," Narcissa smiled again. "I can't believe my son is getting married to the Great Savior."
"You know you find me irresistible," Harry cocked his head.
"Yes, just say it like that. 'My love,'" Harry said hotly, and he pushed Draco on his back and ripped off his trousers and briefs. "Fuck, I want to destroy you. I want to wreak you," he dived on him, kissing his fiercely and passionately and aggressively. "I want to spend the rest of my life with you."
Blood spilled from his nose onto the floor which distracted Draco. He felt his stomach twist and heart burn. Draco stared down at the pool, not noticing the fist connecting to his nose.
"And I'm not surprised that you're still a prat," Harry laughed, taking off again, this time with Draco following him. They flew together indefinitely, until the weather bit at them and they both inhabited wind burn on their cheeks. Landing at the stone circle, they smiled continuously, the only form of light within outdoors illuminating their faces.
Merlin, and he thought his father finding out, would be a problem. Throw You-Know-Who in the mix... "He's not going to. We're not going to let him. This is contained to Pansy, Blaise, you, me—"
“I don’t want to go back,” Draco admitted.
Blood was everywhere: all along the length of Draco's body and on his clothes and on Harry's clothes and Harry's hands and it was in Harry's hair for when he put his hands through it; Draco's blood pooled down his sides and in the water surrounding them.
"I never got to thank you properly for saving my life during the war!"
"Now, what is it you want us to be?"
"Hm?"
Then Harry trailed to his waistband and hooked a finger in it. "I wanted to give it to you for your birthday. Would you be interested?"
Draco mounted his broom and kicked off from it. They looked at each other and then zoomed away, searching for the glimmer of the snitch.
"No, it's not a sleeping potion," he cringed. "Just, lets go lay together and you'll be in my arms and we can talk it all out."
Draco stayed silent.
Draco couldn't look at him in the eyes. "If you don't want this, I understand."
"Follows me around? We're alone right now."
Draco grabbed his collar. "You don't own me,
"Draco, if you don't want this," Harry started but was caught off by Draco grabbing him by his shirt and ripping it apart, buttons going everywhere in the grass. "Draco?"
The evening was beautifully painted with pink clouds and an auburn sky. At the top of the earth, stars formed while the night took over. It was around 7:00 p.m, and the grass was dancing as the wind blew across the field between the castle and the Quidditch pitch.
"I need to talk to you." McGonagall stood at the front of her classroom, holding a cup in one hand and her wand in the other. She blinked in shock for several seconds as every first year in the room turned and gasped at Harry, entertained by his fame. Harry didn't care. "Right now."
He couldn't say anything else because he was cut off by Draco kissing him, hard. Draco dived into Harrys neck and began sucking violently. Harry was determined not to let any sound escape his throat and Draco knew that. That's why he avoided Harry's favorite spot until the very end.
“I see you have your priorities straight,” Draco snorted.
Sectumsempra.
“That would be disgusting,” Draco cringed, but then grew back into a smirk. “Unless of course you would want to join.”
"I know there is something going on between you two. I'm going to find out, and I intend to make your life a living hell once I do."
"I'm glad you are," Draco snorted at the inital audacity of his stuttering. Harry smiled, as if a large wieght was lifted off of his chest. Draco held out his arm once again, just as he did the night before, and Harry took it.
"What's your other favorite present?"
"Your mum could catch us at any moment," Harry spoke, before sucking on his neck.
"Well, being in the Owlery, I figured it was the best place to start this new hobby I've got."
"Years. I feel so embarrassed to even tell you that. But I just hate... sitting in this silence. Hating how you look is exhausting, and it makes you feel so alone. And you wouldn't even know that because you're so gorgeous."
"Harry--"
The dustpan in Draco's hand slipped through his loose fingers, clattering to the floor, and the noise was loud enough to make them both jump. Harry looked towards the door, thinking it was someone spying, but no one was there. When he turned back, Draco grabbed his face, and hesitated just for their eyes to meet. There was a shared connection between the two, that they were both nervous and scared and unsure, but also enthralled, entertained, and eager to prove the other wrong.
"And I believed you," he said in cold blood.
"You could have at least told me," he argued.
And with that Harry fell asleep in the boys arm, exhaustion taking over. His only dreamless sleep.
"Because if I look at you, I know I'll have to take you regardless of how sore we are."
"Used to? Doesn't he look at me now?"
"Get out," Draco snarled. He was surprised he even managed that.
“I will kiss you good morning every day. I will make you breakfast, whatever you like, in bed, out of bed, you can eat off my back if you want to. I will make love to you whenever you like. I will make you laugh, and I will fight you, and I will love you until forever. Will you do one thing, and marry me?”
"I know you do."
"Harry-"
“Hey, shh,” Draco held. “You’re okay now.”
And then Draco realized he'd felt strength when he was with Potter. When they flew together, laughed together. When they had
"Draco."
"You know, one day we're going to have to thank McGonagall for leaving us alone that day," Harry looked at him.
"But-... That's weird!"
Snape flicked their wand and a force split apart, but they immediately tried to run after each other, but it was as if there was a force field, two of the same magnets pushing up against each other.
"I want it," Harry said certainly. "I'm trying to keep myself from finishing without even touching you. I knew it, you're a closeted kinky bastard just like me. Hearing it all now, full force... it's a lot all at once but I don't want it to stop."
Draco reached forward, wrapping his arms around him and enjoying the sheer nakedness of each other. Naked in skin and in soul.
"Yes. Most certainly."
"Did she say anything about Draco?" Harry furrowed his brows. "Is he okay?"
Which meant Draco and Potter had to
"This is getting out of hand," Harry stroked his back.
Then, they stood and found their briefs and joggers, putting them on.
Draco pulled away abruptly just as Harry closed his eyes, waiting for his wishes to be granted, Draco's scent so close he could almost taste it. The raven haired boy opened his eyes to find the presence not there and seeing the back of Draco's Slytherin robes walking away behind one of the many trees bordering the field.
They would then fight over whatever was on their minds that day. Harry loved it, fighting with him. It was almost addicting and he couldn't even understand why. It was like his own sick way of fun with him. Maybe it was because he was too afraid of laughing with him, because then somehow that could be taken from him as well. And he knew what it was like to have Draco taken from him. He wasn't about to have it happen again.
Harry's look of shock turned to one of disgust. Pure hatred and disgust. Draco didn't know he could pull such a face. "What the fuck are you saying?"
"Er... we don't have to wear heavy robes in the summer."
"No, all my friends will be too protective of me. Term ends in only 5 days. I'm sure they want to spend as much time with me as possible,"
"We'll do it today then," Pansy stated, unusually excited while piling some chicken and green beans on her plate for lunch.
"Were you forced to get the Dark Mark?"
Draco Malfoy had a crush.
“I couldn’t help it! It was so sweet. And you made my mouth hurt from it,” Harry massaged his cheeks.
"Fine," Harry replied before launching himself at the blonde with so much force that they rolled over and over until the both fell off the bed, taking the blankets and pillows with them. Harry smashed their lips together and put his hands in his silky hair before releasing. "Good morning," he smiled.
Draco just readjusted his neck, which craned down into Harry's. "Times like this I wish you were taller."
"Probably killing him," Hermione answered before a snarky slytherin could even say a word.
"I hope that's soon," Draco said. "Maybe he'll fall off a cliff or something."
Graphic panic attacks: because I have suffered panic attacks, I do not take that term lightly and therefore chose to write them true to my experience. Meaning, they are graphic depictions.
“Saturday?”
"Lily," Harry shouted.
Still Potter shook his head, blocking the door.
"Not all of them," Harry clarified. "But the ones I've been around... yeah." He swallowed. "So you're not angry."
The silent room poisoned with Draco's sobs stood absent of anything sentimental, and Draco blinked through his tears and looked in the mirror to find Harry's sad reflection staring at him in hatred. It felt as though someone had ripped out his heart with bare hands and chopped it into little tiny pieces.
Five minutes later, another note flew by. ‘Draco,’ was scribbled on it, and nothing else.
"It's great," Harry said.
Harry covered his mouth as tears rolled down his face. "I don't want to go." He staggered backwards to the wall and slid down it. And then he sobbed. "Please don't make me—I don't want to die. I-I'm sorry."
And the realization brought him to his knees. His boggart wasn't a childish fear; it was a crystal ball.
"Boyfriends."
"Oh good," she said, half joking, half not. "I'm glad you're figuring everything out." She took another bite, eyeing Harry, who was somewhat entertained by all this banter, and yet also terrified. "Planning your lives together. It wouldn't be hard at all, since you seem two seem to know each other so well."
His bed rested in the corner, wearing a green, silk duvet and black sheets. "Much classier, isn't it? Better than stupid red." Harry rolled his eyes as he sat on the edge of it.
"Take me there," Draco held out his hand for Harry to grab. Harry smiled brightly, the brightest he'd done in a while. He took his hand firmly, lacing their fingers together, and pulled him to the right rather the left, bones crunching beneath their feet. "Although this place is brilliant... are these bones are actually very terrifying."
"Thanks."
"I'll eat tomorrow, then. Stop wasting time!" Harry jumped on him, pushing him to the ground and straddling him. He proceeded to kiss down his neck tenderly; Draco felt something he'd never felt before. He didn't know it was possible to kiss another human being so softly.
"No, Harry, please don't tell me..."
"No. I..." he thought back to it. "But now you mention it, the way my father kept talking. He didn't give a single detail, I didn't even know he was a part of it." He licked his lips. "He made me go home after the match because he wanted us to go to France the next day and didn't want to worry about leaving as all the crowds did. He said he'd meet me back at the Manor after saying bye to Fudge and I left. But if you're saying he was in the graveyard tonight... he had to be a part of that too." Draco had to put his hand on the edge of a bed to keep himself steady. "Where'd you go? Who all was there?"
Draco's heart skipped a beat. "You have?"
"I guess we'll have to see, won't we. Good day."
"Let's do it," Draco said after a bit. "But no consequence, just embarrassment."
Still, Harry tried. He unhooked a leg, and reached forward, grabbing hold on the handle to try to steady himself. "Harry, stop it," his voice was pure panic, "You're going to get hurt."
"Nothing insanely nice. We're not talking diamond jewelry or fancy clothes or anything. There's this bakery outside Kings Cross, and the Dursley's used to take Dudley there all the time. It's world famous and I never got to try it because, you know, Dursley's being who they were, so I thought that we could try it together." Harry jumped off the sink, nearly knocking Draco over, and grabbed a lumpy paper pouch from his waistband that crinkled loudly as he dug in it.
"What date? How come he didn't tell me he had a date? With who," Ron pushed, feeling left out.
"If not expelled, his hand will fall off from being tortured. I don't even think he remembers the bet. I'm the one who always thought about it. I always have to win, and look, now I've lost. He was trying to help people."
Fuck. That did nothing. That helped nothing. Because Harry would have to know they were soulmates for the bond to break. Or, to get to the point he would break it, he would have to make Harry hate him first, and then Draco himself would have to purely hate Harry.

He honestly, completely had no idea.
"I should have known it was fake but I just... I felt that you liked me."
“It would be a great time to do it,” he agreed.
"Well, we lasted seven."
Draco backed up a bit so he could stoke Harry's cock, and Harry cried out, the feeling too much for him to bear.
"You'll learn Occlumency. We'll be okay. Just don't end this. I don't want you to end this." Draco hugged him again.
Harry didn't quite care about the last part. All he cared about was Draco's name. "Do you think he's going to recover?"
"No," she said. Bless that woman for keeping a professional stance.
Draco shot from his bed, angry. What an absurd. stupid.
“I’ll tell her soon.”
Pansy, as well as everyone else, appeared to be simply amused. "You seriously forgot? Thought that you of all of us would want to see him in distress."
“Stop asking and-“
"Goodnight."
“Why can’t we just catch a break,” he spoke alone. He took Harry’s ring and felt its warmth, knowing Harry was wearing it seconds ago. He thought back to when Harry got really upset over Astoria when an idea popped in his head. He knew exactly how to make Harry mad.
That was the first time Draco... did his homework.
"I was not able."
"I am," Harry smiled genuinely.
"It's complicated," Harry spoke, "I don't hate him, and I don't think you should either."
"Oh- erm.. I'm fine with whenever you're free. I can make time."
Harry continued on with his shower and filled his head with shampoo when two hands started scrubbing his head for him. He immediately jumped and turned to find Draco, naked, with a malicious grin on his face. "Showers are always better with two."
"... we let each other win, Scorpius" Draco choked before hiding in his shirt, giggling. Harry slapped his arm. Lily laughed too.
Draco smiled. "Okay."
"A while. It doesn't bother you?"
"Hey," Draco shouted, but Harry cut him off.
"But-"
"Leave me! Leave me alone and never talk to me again." He slammed the door shut and fell to the ground again, his head in his knees, arms around his legs.
