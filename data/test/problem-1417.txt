“So you mean to tell me that what I’m pregnant?” Harry asked trying to be certain he understood what she was telling him.
The bucket topples over, and with a loud crash, Harry falls and crashes into the shelves before falling flat on his back.
Behind him Harry could heard Draco crying quietly but kept his full attention on Lucius.
“Where is this sudden talk of children coming from?” Ron asked blushing himelf.
“You know son maybe I was a little to hasty with you, having  a child with a random boy would possibly shame our family but, a having a child with the famous Harry Potter might actually help our image. You might actually be brilliant after all..”
Sucking in his breath he knew better than to be late, Snape would be furious and would dock hundreds of points from Gryffindor if he was even one minute late, or worse would extend his detention with Malfoy to be twice as long.
“Harry that was way to much money for you to spend on us.” Hermione breathed.
“Hey Draco what brings you up here?”
Ron gives Harry a sympathetic look.
Harry pulls out his wand and summons the lube from his dresser to appear into his hands. It was a simple spell he’d learned that was much more efficient and discreet then the accio spell.
Potions class goes by without much of a hitch, when Harry gets up to follow his classmates he noticed Snape motioning to him.
Harry shoulders his bag and headed out the door and to his next class. The rest of his day went smoothly as he went from one class to another trying to pretend that nothing was going on between him and Draco, avoiding eye contact as much as possible.
Harry could hear Draco making a sound almost as if in pain. But then Harry heard Draco stand up to his father.
Ron’s eyes slowly opened as he stretched, and blinks at Harry, before his eyes wander down and the situation suddenly dawned on the ginger.
Harry smiled “That I am sir.”
Harry’s stomach growls in response to Draco’s words, making them both laugh. The two of them quietly got dressed and went down stairs. The fact that they had managed to skip lunch, making them hungrier then usual.
Snape stops in front of them and sneers
There was two tubs of ice cream, a bowl of candied cherrys, there was chocolate syrup, sprinkles and a can of whipped cream sitting there.
“Just give us a few days to gather all our stuff together and everything and we’ll be there.” Ron tells Harry.
Harry was in pure bliss as he kissed with all the love and longing in his heart giving the kiss his all.
Harry nodded to Draco when he felt ready.
Harry sighed wishing he could stay at Hogwarts forever and never leave. Hogwarts had always been the place he’d considered home for the last seven years. It was going to be hard next summer when he would for the first time in his life not be leaving on the train for school.
Harry was bewildered and wondered what Snape meant by altering chromosomes, but without going into details Snape had already left the room to go do something else.
“Well hello there Mr. Potter, what may I help you with?”
As they talk Harry finds himself telling Draco all about his life living with the Dursley’s and how they treated him.
He watched Ron give him a toothy grin.
“Yeah me too.” Ron agreed.
“Well, I know I like you Harry, a lot, I have feelings for you, and I want to explore this and see where it goes.”
He circled each of the ones that caught his attention and fell under his price range. By the time of his release he had about five of them circled so he could show them to Draco.
Harry shivered and shook in his sleep, as sweat soaked his sheets with each dream that passed through his mind.
Draco starts to move against Harry’s hands, causing the Gryffindor to smile, and increase the speed before slipping in a second finger.
He found Draco standing there in just his briefs looking nervously around every corner, as if afraid of being seen there.
Ron and Hermione looked at him in shock as the transaction happened.
Instead he was going to honor his Godfather, and make the house Sirius gave him into a home. Now that he was officially a full fledged wizard, he was going to stop the Order of The Phoenix's ability to use the house for their meetings.
They have fun the rest of the day as they pick out strollers, baby carriers, baby toys, magical monitors for the room. And a device for singing them to sleep.
Approaching the picture on the wall of Mrs.Black he used a spell he’d found in the restricted section to remove it from the wall. The moment it is removed she starts screaming horrible insults at him, cursing at him. But Harry just boxed it up and sent it to the wizard world’s junk yard. Surely someone would want it eventually.
Harry followed him inside then asked
“Draco we need to talk about this..I need to know fully where things between us stand..”
He’s at a playground watching a little girl with dark hair and blue eyes,
Ron and Hermione glanced at each other.
The witch gently clapped Harry’s shoulders.
While Harry stretches on the bed, Draco grabs first the bucket of ice cubes, and pours the whole bucket on top of Harry.
“That’s not going to happen Draco, we’ll figure this out Draco.”
After awhile Pomphrey streightens up and says
“Tell me Draco, tell me what you need, what you need from me, I need to hear you say it.” Harry whispers into his ears.
His eyes jump over to Hermione.
Ron brought Harry a bagel and cream cheese and flask of pumpkin juice upstairs. Harry gratefully ate them and together he, Ron and Hermione headed down towards the train.
Harry bows his head.
“You have no idea how badly I want you.” Harry whispers as the scent of Draco’s cologne washed over his nose again, once again causing his briefs to feel two sizes too small.
Draco looks over at Harry teasingly wiggling his eyebrows at him.
When Ron and Hermione joined Harry in the kitchen they took one look at breakfast and laughed.
“Well it appears your arm is broken in several places and one of those bones is fractured, I can heal up those broken bones magically but with the fractures that can be dangerous, so I’ll need to do it the muggle way, then let it heal on its own. As for the nasty cut on your forehead that should heal up in a jiffy.”
Harry sighed.
Harry stood and told Ron and Hermione, he’d catch them later before walking as calmly as he could out of the room.
Harry wondered if Draco really would soon be carrying his child. If he was how would they each handle it since they were still both in school? And with the threat of Voldemort in their lives. Would Voldemort find out that He was the other parent? Would he kill them to get to him? The questions follow Harry all the way up to bed and even into his dreams turning into horrible nightmares, causing him to toss and turn in his sleep the whole night. One terrible time he was sitting in a room with Draco and a little wanders in bleeding and ended up dying in his arms, from some spell that Voldemort had placed on him.
But then the realization that someone could come around a corner at any time and see what only Harry felt only he should be allowed to see crossed Harry’s mind, and Harry gave off a slight growl of possessiveness.
“Eww. But to each their own, if you like him, then I guess that’s awesome at least.” Ron giggles.
“You? You mean to tell me, that my son was not only had sex with another boy, but with the famous Harry Potter?” Lucius sputtered.
“Harry!” Ron yells excitedly as soon as he opened the front door.
Promprey looked Harry over and found he had a few bumps and bruises but was otherwise fine. Leaving the bruises to heal on their own she sent Harry upstairs to bed with a clean bill of health.
“I know everyone is worried about me, but I’m not going back to them. I have a new place to call home now. I’m going to Appearate there.”
Instead of going to the village with everyone else, they decided to stay in the Room of Requirements to cuddle, and spend time with each other, getting to know each in between having sex as often as their bodies would allow them too.
“Don’t forget to send me an owl.” Harry reminded them once the train arrives at Kings Cross Station.
“Yes, Mrs. Weasley, I think now that in the wizarding world I am considered of age, I’m going to honor Sirius’s memory . He left me that house and I realized I’d be dishonoring his memory to not use it, I’m going to go and gutt it out and fix it up. Now that I can use magic outside school I’m going to use it to my advantage to make Grimwauld much more livable.”
Harry briefly wondered if he should avoid telling Draco about what Snape had told him, but decided he could not consciously go into this with dishonesty. He knew he needed to be honest.
Just as he got accustomed to his finger, Draco added a second finger, easing both fingers in and out slowly, until Harry is moaning in pleasure, at that point Draco increases the speed and depth.
The Minister walks over to Lucius with anger in his eyes “Mr. Malfoy you are hear by sentenced to Azkaban for attacking a student, and trying to use an unforgivable on another student.”
“Potter, get out of my way!” Lucius snarled.
Boldly Harry stands up, dusts himself off and marches up to Draco and presses his lips up against his.
Harry blushed.
His mind thinks quickly of all the many rooms inside his house, Grimwauld did have like tweleve rooms in it.
It took a few days before Harry was allowed to leave the Hospital wing wearing a cast over his arm. Harry had used the time in the Hospital Wing to do the homework that Draco would bring him from all the classes he missed.
Both boys moan deeply.
As they sat down to eat, Harry shared with Hermione about his earlier dream.
He watched Snape think carefully for a moment.
“I went up to the roof top to look out at the stars tonight. And a guy I’ve had a crush on since start of term came to me and told me that he had one on me, but that his parents were expecting him to go through with a marriage they had arranged for him..He wanted us to have sex, so we could experience it at at least once before he married a girl he had no feelings for. And I went along with it.”
“We remembered you saying that the guy was going to marry someone else after being with you that night, and when we say the paper we kinda just knew this had to be the guy you were with. I’m so sorry Harry. But the idea of staying with you at your place, being able to see you everyday just like when we were in school sounds like a lovely idea. You can be our baby’s Godfather, Harry.”
Harry’s heart felt like it was dancing at hearing his words. Only then did he take in what Draco had been placing on the nightstand beside the bed.
Harry watched Draco’s face finally reach the point of a smile and he shakes himself. “Harry, if it happens..if I am carrying your..if we are expecting..then we will deal with it when the time comes. Even if it happens that won’t be enough to make me run away from this.”
“see this room is perfect for a double nursery. And on the other end over there, that door leads to my room, making this perfect for us to share.”
Turning to Draco he growled.
Harry could see him calculating somethings.
“Yes, Harry. You are Mine! And I am Yours. And the baby I carry is Ours.”
Harry shook his head a bit, then glanced at the bag.
And then he felt a small pressure at his opening. His eyes fly open as Draco slides a slippery finger inside him. It was cold, wet and dripping with lube as it slid in to the hilt. Harry gasped at the uncomfortable feeling, but then Draco’s mouth was on his neck, kissing and suckling on the folds of the skin, as Draco starts to move the finger in and out of him slowly.
“mean what?” Draco asked perplexed
“That dream child was soo cute.” Harry gushed.
Harry groans himself, and then Draco pulls away from the kiss and whispers into Harry’s ear.
MgGonagall gave him the assignments and Draco hurried on to all the other classes to collect them, all that was left was Potions and that one Draco could just get an extra one for him when he attended himself.
After a few weeks of them acting like that, Harry finally cornered Ron demanding to know why. Ron looked steadily uncomfortable in his presence until finally Ron blurted out the truth.
“Well one of those potions was a truth potion, but the other one..Snape told me the side effects that can come of it..”
Harry glanced over at Draco for a moment before shaking his head.
Harry shrugged.
It wasn’t long before Ron and Hermione joined him on the bed looking at him with expectant eyes. He knew they were looking for an explanation of where he had been for so long.
He made his way to the dormitory, and found that Ron and Hermione were sitting by the fire in the same chair, dead asleep. To Harry’s mortification he could see a portion of Ron’s butt cheek sticking out from under the blankets.
Harry quietly rattled off the symptoms he’d been experiencing lately. From throwing up, headaches, increased appetite, and pain in lower regions.
Harry felt himself almost panicking if Snape saw him hanging here instead of going to Transfiguration, would he punish him?
“Keep an eye on him Harry, I have a bad feeling about what he might be about to do.” Snape says to Harry.
“And with you two getting married, you two may end up with some of your own.” Harry added.
His green eyes fill with instant Lust.
Harry could hear footsteps making their way towards the dungeon, a voices accompanying it.
Using the spoon Draco spreads the ice cream he’d put on Harry’s stomach over his chest, arms, stomach, and places a nice chunk of the ice cream all around Harry’s cock. He then grabs the chocolate syrup and pours a trail all over Harry where the ice cream covered him from his arms, to his chest, to his stomach, up and down Harry’s legs and then he pours a big glob over Harry’s manly bits.
Harry glanced from them to Draco as he starts to realize what Draco had in mind.
“Draco, I’ve come to have a lot of feelings for you, but I also understand if you have to comply with your parent’s wishes. But why are you telling me this now?” Harry asked.
Hermione and Ron looked around with pure awe in the face.
Both of the cribs they had asked for are rung up and Harry pays for both and has them magically sent to the house.
Harry grins.
In another bucket were a bunch of ice cubes.
Harry and Draco glance at each other a bit worried as Snape stops and sniffs the air a moment. Both of the boys could still catch a small whiff of sex in the air, and were almost sure Snape could smell it too. But since both boys were hard at work at their assignments and that the other two were already done, they also knew Snape had no grounds of proof that anything happened.
He watched as Draco’s briefs hit the floor.
Harry knew he probably shouldn’t be trusting him like this but Harry really liked him, really wanted to be with Draco, and something in the blonde’s tone told Harry to just trust him anyway.
“I don’t mind, it’s a gift to my future godchild.” Harry responded.
“No! I’m not letting you kill him, nor are touching my child.” Harry growls.
Ron and Hermione did the same but by the time they return Harry’s already locked up in his room.
The boys continue to sit and talk about the things they did and didn’t like. Time flew by pretty quick and when Draco checked a time piece he had in his pocket he realized it was close to dinner and had been up there since after breakfast.
‘Shut up potter’ Harry mentally tells himself as he starts to panic inwardly. ‘Don't give Malfoy a chance to hurt you’ Harry continued to berate himself for what he’s saying. But try as he might he couldn’t stop himself from spilling the truths he kept hidden.
Draco nods trying to calm down as best he could.
Draco looks at Harry stunned.
Harry didn’t want to lie to Ron, so he decided to tell Ron everything that actually happened, worried Ron would be pissed at him for having a crush on Malfoy.
“My, my it seems you boys have been busy with more than just potions in here. I should be pissed about this and take points, but at the same time..you two are finally getting along for once. I’m not exactly sure right now if I should be pleased that detention worked to make you get along or if I should punish you for taking the idea a bit too literally.”
What if it had all been a joke to him? What if he had just been playing some sick mind game? Harry wondered. Harry let his eyes fall back to his untouched plate, wondering if he should tell him about what Severus had told him about the broken potion, Harry was unsure of how to best explain the possibility to him, what if he got mad at him? What if he blamed him for the issue?
“Harry, you being gay I kinda guessed. Although it’s rare that you might be one. In the wizarding world with gay couples, almost always one of them is the metrowizard. I just wasn’t sure if it was you or the other wizard.”
“Since you choose to keep this child and you choose to continue to be gay, or tell me who fathered the child, then not only am I disowning you but I’m afraid this means I am also going to have to kill you to keep you from disgracing this family’s name.”
Looking him in the eye Harry says “did you mean it Draco?”
Harry relaxed more at his words.
“Come on in Harry, I got news to share with you.” Ron says animatedly.
They were getting close, Harry could feel it, he didn’t want it to end, not like this, but Snape would be back soon.
The next morning Harry wandered down to breakfast, and his eyes wander over the Slytherin table looking for the blonde. His eyes soon spot him sitting with Crabbe and Goyle. Their eyes meet, and his heart flutters with anxiety as he was concerned that even after the events of last night, Draco’s attitude towards would not have changed at all.
Harry then went looking for Ron and Hermione to talk them about cribs, and found Hermione already in the furniture department looking at a pair Phoenix colored cribs that was made of a special goblin made material. Each of them was a different flame color. One had greens and blues in the paint and phoenix feathers on one end flowing like a tail. The other was a red and orange colored one.
When he came to he heard a voice calling to him from the doorway.
Harry stood up abandoning his uneaten plate.
Harry wandered upstairs took a swig of the potion Snape gave him and went to sleep.
Harry sighed as he hears Draco voice his very own fears.
In a huff he grabbed his bags and disappearated on the spot and went home.
Harry nods.
“yes sir.” Harry responded quickly.
Tiny Wizard Tots
Draco goes quiet for a moment before biting his lips.
Draco helps Harry to his feet.
Draco finally got to Harry’s cock and says “And look, I found the banana.” Just as he covers it with his mouth, licking up and down the base, slurping up the melting ice cream that covered him.
“When you called me Your Harry.” He responded
With a single thrust he pushed his way into Draco, driving his hard pulsing cock as far into the boy as he could.
The next several weeks went by with Harry and Draco going to classes and meeting in secret for a cuddle, a kiss, a quick date and on Hogsmaed weekend would have sex as much as they could until it was time for everyone in Hogsmaede to come back to the castle.
Hermione steered Harry into a store that had a sign that read
Neither boy speaks to the other.
“Your going to Grimwauld aren’t you?” Molly guessed softly.
“Ron, it’s good to see you.” Harry greeted.
Laughing Harry remembered undoing and redoing the cloaking spell on the house so nobody would see the house unless he let them in on where it was. He’d done this to keep Mungdungus from getting back in to steal stuff anymore.
“As do you Mrs. Weasley.” Harry responds.
Harry swallowed glancing at Molly, before turning his gaze back to his two friends.
Snape grimaced “I just wonder if he’ll end up Slytherin or Griffyndor since it’ll probably have a bit of both of their personalities.”
Turning to look at the wizard that had spoken and smiled at the blonde.
“The only thing in my favor right now is that nobody knows it’s yours.” Draco says softly.
Harry gave a soft cry at the momentary pain. Draco remained as still as he could to give him a chance to adjust.
Harry was now shivering and shaking with the cold from the combination of the ice, and the ice cream. His teeth were starting to chatter.
Harry felt his mind settle on the only decision he knew he wanted to make. He’d rather experience it once and watch him walk away then to never have known the arms of real love.
When Draco was finally done putting all the things he had all over Harry, he starts trailing his tongue over Harry’s arms licking up the mess.
Standing Harry signed out and decided instead of going home right off he would go to the Burrow and chat with Ron for a bit. With what he just heard he needed to talk to his best friends. He new he would need a support system.
Harry and Draco parted ways before they reached the Great Hall so nobody would notice that the two of them had been hanging out together.
Harry wandered into the kitchen to fix breakfast, Eggs, bacon and fully loaded french toast with the butter, syrup and the powdered sugar, and he put a couple scoops of vanilla ice cream on top of the french toast. Then sprinkled chocolate syrup over it.
Harry sat on the bed wallowing in his bruised heart, wondering how he could bare to see Draco in the morning at breakfast after what they had done and knowing that Draco would now have to go marry someone else.
Harry’s hand went to the sore on his head, only to grimace at the moment of his arm.
“Well then why Don’t you stay with me, I have this job that I only work during the summer, the boss there and I worked it out, he knows I go to school most of the time, and always has a position for me during the summer, and I’ve been saving up the muggle money in my gringotts vault so that my aunt and uncle won’t know I have it, it pays well, and I’ve been working with them since I was tweleve. And I reckon that I should have enough by now to get us something small, where we can raise our child together.” Harry suggested.
“So young Malfoy is pregnant and Harry is the father?” Albus says thoughtfully.
Harry looks up and pain clouded his heart in the moment.
“Talk to me what is it Draco? What ever it is we’ll deal with it.”
“Okay Draco, but before we go further I need to talk to about a conversation I had with Snape after you left last night, so we can decide how best to handle things, I don’t want to go into anything with you by not telling you.”
“Yes, Sir, Professor.” both boys sound of as Snape leaves the room, locking the door behind him.
But Snape’s gaze fell upon something in front of the storeroom door. Harry watched with a pounding heart as Snape picked up the object and held it up for inspection. To Harry’s embarrassment, Harry realizes it was the small tube of lube. The item had someone fallen from his pocket during their hurry to redress and look like they’d been working on their assignment.
Morning came quickly , Ron and Hermione went down for breakfast while Harry finished packing his bags and even finished packing Ron’s bag for him.
Harry was finally done listening to him. So he stood up threw away his trash and says
“Flipendo!”
Harry thought for a moment “Where are you hoping for this to go?” he asked carefully.
Harry felt himself starting to wither and moan under him, at that moment Draco pulled his fingers out, positioned himself at Harry’s opening, and Harry felt Draco sliding into him.
Harry nods.
“I’m betting mine will have the Weasley famous red hair, freckles and I’m hoping he and I don’t end up with our own pack of seven children.” she jokes.
Any and everything was running through his mind. Harry was almost absolute certain he was about to get his heart ripped to shreds and was trying to mentally prepare himself. When he reached the room of requirements.
“Advra kada..” Lucius starts in-canting
The next after Harry was heading to defense class from the Great Hall when he watched Snape lead Draco down the hall.
“Because, I’m with you, and I didn’t want to do anything that would look anything like I was seeing someone else behind your back.”
‘Meet me outside the room of requirements.’
Harry went and spent time with Hagrid for a bit after class, waiting for their to be a moment when he could sneak off with Malfoy without everyone noticing them.
After food, Hermione suggests a shopping trip so the three of them walked outside and stick up their wand hands to call upon the knight bus.
One day while Harry was having lunch, he was chatting with Ron and Hermione when a note landed in front of Harry.
Harry blushing tells Draco exactly what Snape had said the potion was made to do. When Harry was finished he watched the Slytherin’s face change from one expression to another as he’s trying to consider how he actually felt about the news.
Harry is surprised that Snape had overheard what he’d told Ron and had actually given Harry something to help. Since when did Snape care? Harry wondered.
After cleaning up and hiding the broken glass,so that Snape would never find the evidence of the incident. They grabbed the ingredients that Harry had been trying to grab early, and quickly fell back to work to try and finish the last potion Snape had asked them to do.
Harry unable to handle it much more and blurts out
Harry strips out of all of his clothes so that he was completely bare butt naked and then climbs onto the bed.
Harry mind races as he wondered in his mind if he ought. Should he or shouldn’t he? Could his heart handle touching the man he loved when he knew he would be forced to leave his arms for another person forever?
Harry lay still on the ground, a large would on his forehead bleeding heavily, one of his arms was looking pretty odd.
“Yes, once again you are right Harry this set up would in fact be perfect.” Ron whispered.
After awhile he hurries up to the Room of Requirements to meet Draco.
What if Draco wanted Harry to forget that yesterday ever happened? What if Draco had thought about the event and was now pissed? What if Snape had told him all about the possibility that he could be carrying Harry’s child and wanted to chew him out in private?
What perplexed Harry, was Ron and Hermione. They were acting very strangely towards him lately, it was like they never wanted to sit near him anymore. When ever he’d approach them they suddenly have something they had to do elsewhere.
Harry noticed Draco breath a sigh of relief when he finally spots him.
This house was located in muggle London, not far from Diagon Alley. The house on the pamphlet was perfect, it showed the inside and out. It was fully furnished, and had three bedrooms in it, there as the Master Bedroom, a guest Bedroom, and an already furnished nursery.
Harry nods “what ever happens I plan to be there for Draco every step of the way.”
“No we won’t Harry. Some one in the hospital wing overheard Madam Pomphrey talking to me about the pregnancy and then gave me crap about it, and he sent a letter to my dad.” Draco says shaking.
But Harry swallowed it back and says
Harry glanced at Draco about to deny they did anything, but between the smell in the room and the bottle Snape found, Harry knew there was no way in hell, he was going to be able to lie his way out of this one all he could do was sit there in embarrassment and wait for Snape to punish Gryffindor for this. Snape was always looking for reasons to take points and Harry was sure even if he didn’t punish Draco he’d more than likely punish him. Harry was trying his damndest to think of a way to explain to his housemates how he’d lost the points..when Snape starts talking again.
Ron pulls on Harry’s arm to join them at the table.
The two of them read the board and work in silence to make the potion.
“No! I’m not going anywhere, I’m pregnant yes, and I’m keeping it! Wither it be a boy, a girl or what ever I’m going to raise this child, I’m not going to let anyone take it from me.” Draco snapped.
Snape hands Harry a small vial of some kind of potion.
“Harry, I just saw the Hospital wing today and I. I’m pregnant. I know you told me this could happen, and I said we’d handle it then, but now that it’s happened, now that it’s real..I’m scared Harry. What are we going to do? If You Know Who finds out it’s yours he might just kill me, or kill the child or kill us both. Or he’ll take the child and try and turn it into a loyal death eater.”
Up in the Hospital wing Draco sits by the bed while Madam Pomphrey takes care of Harry. Draco who had been trying to stay strong during the whole ordeal finally breaks into tears.
Harry shrugged.
Over time though fixing up the house started to take longer as Harry felt himself starting to feel sick. Harry was a little worried as to why he was getting sick. But he brushed it aside as he continued to finish fixing up the house. He wanted it to be done before he allowed what ever the sickness was to make him stay in bed.
The inside of the store was much bigger on the inside then the outside suggested it would be. The three of them separate in three different directions. Harry went looking at baby clothes, he found a cute onesie that said Little Bludger on it and had a picture of a bludger ball, another one that said I’m a Keeper, that had a goalie on it, Harry found a bunch of little onesies with Quidditch as the theme, he threw a bunch of these over his arms, and grabbed a pack of diapers that had little racing brooms on it and a snitch on the front.
Standing up he took the letter and smiled it was Ron, asking him to come help them find the house, saying they were just outside but couldn’t see the actual house.
“Come on guys lets go home.”
Severus was leading Draco into the Dungeon, so Harry stayed just outside where he could hear what was being said.
But Harry was scared that the moment the sex ended, things between him and Draco would just go back to the way it had been, with them ignoring the others existance and pretending nothing happened. What if when it was all over Draco decided he regretted it? What ifs kept running through Harry’s mind even as his body betrays him and all too soon, feels his body cums hard in perfect sync with Draco.
Harry choose Sirius old room for his own and put up four portraits, one of Sirius, one of Remus, one of Lily, and one of James Potter. He smiled as each of them moved around, and loved watching them visit each other’s portraits.
“Oh that’s perfect.” Harry breathed as he eyes them to. He looks for a price tag. Then turns to the store owner.
“Maybe we can go baby shopping together, we don’t want the Malfoy’s to find out about you knowing Narcissa she’d take the baby away from you and try to raise it the Malfoy way.” Hermione suggested.
But all to soon the boys gave off one last groan and came hard. Their bodies stilled and they waited a moment to give themselves time to catch their breath. Finally reluctantly Draco pulls out and stood up. Draco doesn’t even glance back at Harry as he redresses himself and walks through the doors to head back down to his dorm.
“Me to.”Harry admitted.
“Once, but only once experimentally.” Draco responded.
Harry was perplexed by Ron’s reaction but was pleased that there was no anger anywhere present in his tone or expression. He just thought it was funny, and congratulated Harry on finally having sex for the first time.
Harry grinned halfheartedly “Thanks Ron.”
“Do you remember when I fell yesterday and knocked a couple potion bottles off the shelf?” Harry asked nervously.
Now it was Harry’s turn to gap at Draco. He didn’t know why his tongue suddenly started betraying him tonight but suddenly Harry was starting to wonder if it was actually doing him a favor.
Draco goes and gets the cauldron and Harry goes into the storeroom to find ingredients for the potion.
Harry looks down at his plate unable to erase the look off his own face.
Harry wanders over expecting another detention.
Harry walked into the house and sees Ginny, Hermione, and Molly at the table. Harry quickly made his way to Mrs. Weasley and gives her a hug.
“Good. That's why I’m being a bit more nicer to you than normal. That’s my Godson your with, so since he is now possibly carrying your child, then I’m going to do everything I can to help you. But make no mention of it around other people, I can’t have anyone else knowing that I’m being Nice to you.” Snape growls.
Everyone had wanted Harry to return to the Dursley’s one last time, until he turned eighteen in case anymore of Voldemort’s goons were to come looking for him. But Harry had other plans. He would never set food on private drive again if he could help it.
“Finally! Finally he admits it! Mate your crush on Malfoy has been obvious from the git go honestly, I was just waiting for you two to finally admit it to each other.”
When I got my letter and the world found out the you were coming to Hogwarts to my Dad urged me to try and make friends with you, so that if You Know Who would come back, we would be able to just hand you over to him. But you were smarter than that, and chose the Weasley boy instead. Which I’m glad you did, cause now if my dad ever tried to hand you over to that Wizard now, I don’t know what I’d do..”
“It’s just the other father is with someone else.” Harry whispered softly.
“And you guys can be my baby’s godparents.” Harry responds softly.
Draco nods.
By the time Harry gets through telling him the story, Draco’s trying to hide moistened eyes. “Damn muggles, they sound terrible.”
Harry, unable to wait a moment longer, stopped and lined himself up with Draco’s opening.
Draco seems to think about it. “That sounds like a great idea, you and me getting our own place away from our abusive families.”
“Well you see, my parents want to subject me to an arranged marriage and I honestly have no feeling for the girl and they’re threatening to disown me if I don’t comply. Well the thing is, I’m gay and I’ve had a crush on you for the longest.”
Harry woke the next morning to an owl sitting on his bed post preening itself waiting for him to get up and see the mail it brought him.
“Professor, Harry’s in the hospital wing, and I thought I might could help by going to the classes he missed and seeing if I could collect the homework assignments for him so he can get caught up.” Draco explains.
giggling to herself.
Draco finished telling the story or the parts he wanted to share and Harry hugged him.
“I just don’t know how I’m going to get through breakfast in the morning, seeing him after what happened and knowing I can’t change his mind.”
“That's crazy, I mean you’re only sixteen and you’re already fathering one.”
“When I was born, my mom was happy but my dad only seen me as being in the way, so he hired Dobby the house elf, and made him raise me, while he and my mom went out to do what ever it was they did. My mom would always come in and cuddle me, and spoil me with sweets and the latest new toys. But my dad..he was strict.
They could hear the loud sobs coming from Harry’s room.
He hated that Draco had  been with another guy when Harry himself was still a virgin. What if he screwed up? What if he didn’t measure up to the other boy that Draco had experimented with?
Harry was numb as the witch handed him a folder with tons of booklets and papers inside to help Harry know what to do and not to do while pregnant the foods to avoid and the foods that are really encouraged to eat, and prescribed Harry a prenatal potion.
Snape glanced sideways before responding “that is going to be one interesting combination of a child.”
Both boys shiver and moan softly at the sensation of finally becoming one.
“We still got awhile before Professor Snape comes back, and Harry, I want, I need you..”
A couple vials of already made potion being kept in the storeroom falls from the shelf he’d crashed into and breaks over his face.
“You know we should probably get dressed and go down to dinner, after the um work out we’ve done I’m starving, and I’m sure you are too.”
“Thanks Professor.:” Then when everyone else was gone he looks at Snape and says “It’s just ever since learning what those potions that broke were, I keep dreaming of all these terrible scenarios that can happen if Draco really is..carrying a child, and I can’t stop thinking about what can happen if Voldemort finds out about it.” Harry admits.
It was a beautiful night, Harry mused as he sat on the roof looking out at the stars. He couldn’t believe that night would be the very last night he’d spend at Hogwarts. Tomorrow morning every student at Hogwarts would return home for the summer. But this year Harry was a seventh year student which meant this time there would be no coming back.
My mom kept trying to stop him, but it was no use, he would just shove her away and continue his beatings.
The continue to hold each other for awhile, until Draco calms down enough that they could head back down stairs.
“If you were going to meet me dressed like this why didn’t you just wait inside and have me meet you inside the room?”
The spell hits Harry and throws him into a wall across the room, just as Snape comes into the room with Albus Dumbledore and the Minister Of Magic in tow.
“Where’s your family?”
Hermione laughs “yes we are, in fact Ron and I are already looking for a house for us.”
“Harry! Hermione and I are getting married in a few months.” Ron blurts out excitedly.
Snape turns his eyes upon the boys before clearing his throat.
Harry then replaced the wall paper with a more vibrant blue color, and in the spot where the Black portrait had stood Harry put up a picture of Albus Dumbledore instead.
Harry grumbled the whole time he was getting ready for the journey to the dungeons. Harry really didn’t wanna be in close quarters with Draco. Harry didn’t really hate the boy, he just hated him because he had a crush on him but knew Draco could never be for him, and so he chose to take his frustrations out on the blonde.
“You're joking? You think I’m hot? Dude did you hit your head? Usually you can't stand to be within twenty feet of me and suddenly I’m hot?” Draco asked raising his brow.
“And here I thought you were passed this prick attitude of yours.”
Draco still had bouts were he’d sit and look sad over the situation with his parents but the moment Harry would hug him and remind him that he was there for him, the blonde would smile again, and relax.
Draco starts riding Harry going hard and fast. Harry reached up and runs his hands over Draco’s chest thrusting up against Draco, meeting him thrust for thrust.
Reaching the room, he finds Draco pacing back in forth his face paler then pale.
“Mmm. A Potter Banana split, I think this is the best desert ever.” Draco purred as he continues to run his tongue over Harry’s body.
Harry, feeling lucky at the moment at not getting in trouble for once, starts to leave behind Draco when Snape who was inspecting his storeroom stops him.
Exhausted from the stuff that happened that night, Harry falls asleep the moment his head hit the pillow once he got upstairs and under the covers.
“Come on Potter lets get inside before someone sees us.” Draco says in a hurried tone.
“I didn’t go to the village, I decided to stay here and lend my attention to something a bit more entertaining.”
“If you want we can go somewhere after class and talk about it..” Ron suggested.
“I went to Saint Mongos today, and well I found out about something unexpected something I never knew about myself.. I am what they call a metrowizard, and remember when I told you about what happened up on the roof the night before we left Hogwarts? Well it turns out I’m pregnant.” Harry admits.
The kitchen Harry replaced everything from the floors, the walls, the counters and even the appliances to more modern muggle like ones.
Writing the address on a slip of paper he goes outside to find his friends. Approaching them he stuck the paper with the writing in front of their faces.
“I’ve known for awhile that you felt the same way Harry and I was wondering if since Tonight is probably the last night we’ll be together under the same roof, if maybe you’d be interested in having sex for just this one night, basically one last fling before we move on with our own lives?” Draco asked quietly.
“Mr. Potter when I left I had ten vials sitting in here, and now I’m seeing two are missing, what happened to them?”
Something seemed off about the expression on his face, so deciding to risk getting in trouble, he followed them both, as quietly as he could.
“Class would work so much better if you could just pay attention.”
Draco paused as he had been pulling things from his bag and placing them on a nightstand beside the bed.
“Take this dreamless sleep potion. Take just one small sip each night before bed, and it’ll stop the nightmares.” Snape tells him.
“Hello, Harry dear, you look well.” Molly greets.
Harry took a deep breath.
Harry couldn’t believe the sounds coming from his throat making him glad that Draco had cast a silencing spell so that no matter how loud they got nobody would hear what was happening.
“Hey Harry?” A voice spoke up behind him pulling Harry from his thoughts.
“Oh yeah, just like we were.” Ron and Hermione chime in.
Surprisingly Snape was very cool about the missed lessons and with homework assignments requiring a potion to be made, Snape allowed Harry to just write a paper on how to do the potion instead.
Lucius Malfoy’s wand flies out of his hand causing the spell to miss fire.
Ron tries to ask Harry about a thousand questions about detention trying to gauge how bad it was.
Draco quickly made Harry’s robes fall to the ground. The air from the outside air kissed over Harry’s naked skin making him shiver as Draco slowly removes his own robes.
Molly looked at him affectionately.
“So you were fucking him?” Ron asked Harry.
Harry’s senses were tingling as the boy withers under Draco’s tongue. When he finally trails the tongue over Harry’s stomach eating the bits of ice cream, chocolate whipped cream and cherries off of him, nice and slowly.
“It’s fine Ron, I can deal with it.” Harry responds.
Besides now that Voldemort was gone, Harry saw no reason for the Order to continue to meet there anyways.
Snape spotting Harry there, slides out through a crack, so that Lucius wouldn’t notice him, but leaves the door open a smidge and puts a hand to his mouth to shush him.
Ron was going to go knock on the door, but Hermione quietly led him to their room and they took themselves to bed, deciding to let Harry have his privacy for a bit.
Arms weight down with several bags they leave the shop and head over to the new restaurant that had opened up and ordered lunch.
Draco shakes his head “Never, I know I’ve been known to bully people, I know I’ve even teased you and picked on you, but I would never play when it comes to matters of the heart.”
“This baby is going to get what ever it wants that I can give it. I’ll deny it nothing.”
He was looking for a place to hide, when the door opened taking the opportunity away from him.
Draco was ushered out of the room while the surgery was performed. Draco decided to do something constructive with his time and took Harry’s class schedule from his bag, and went looking for MgGonagall.
Harry leaned over so that only Ron and Hermione could hear and explains.
“Yes, Mrs. Potter.”
He smiled even though his head was still spinning.
“Oh, Harry could you maybe turn around a moment...or wait for us in our room?” Ron asked blushing scarlet red, his face now horribly clashing with his red hair.
He watched Lucius eyes widen at the knowledge,
Even as the questions went through his mind, his fingers continue to increase speed as he tries his best, letting the sounds Draco made guide him as to what he liked.
Harry was surprised.
Glancing at Harry’s face Hermione laughs.
“You’re right, she would do something like that, and Lucius still has enough influence to do it.” Harry agreed.
Draco walks over to Harry and dipped his head down capturing the wizard’s lips with his own. Harry moans softly into his mouth and kisses the blonde back with lips full of hunger and greed. Draco’s hand slide over Harry’s arms and down to his waist, snaking up his shirt to caress the small hair that was slowly starting to grow on Harry’s chest.
In another dream a little girl came in to his room after having visited her grandparents and was sporting the dark mark on his wrist, and had turned her wand upon first Draco and then Harry using the unforgivable curses killing them both.
The two were happy once their plans were set in place, the next order of business was to get Snape to help them make the new house unplottable, so that Voldemort wouldn’t be able to find it.
“It’s Draco’s isn’t it?” Ron inquired.
Harry eats his dinner with vigor, as he had definitely worked up an appetite.
The blonde walks over to Harry and kisses him “Stop worrying Harry, I want to be with you, isn’t that all that matters right now? Lets just see where things can go and get to know each other.”
The fall had caused Harry to fall momentarily unconscious as it had knocked the wind out of him.
Harry was laughing with Ron and Hermione and eating dessert when a couple wanders over to their table.
“you don’t have to. You wait up here, and I’ll bring something up here for you. You don’t have to see him if you don’t want to.”
Gazing into the blonde’s eyes, he gives one more slow thrust before letting go of his self control. He starts pounding Draco hard, fast, almost savagely into the floor. Soon the room was filled with the sounds of their moans and cries as the storeroom starts to become filled with the strong scent of good sweaty sex.
“Good Evening, Albus.”
This they used to go to Diagon Alley.
Harry sighs relieved. Harry hadn’t really wanted to change how he spent time with his friends, but hadn’t wanted Draco to think he was cheating or anything.
Harry with his good hand touched him, giving him  a gentle squeeze to his hand.
This last part he had said after taking the Wizards wand and extracting the most recently used spells from the wand.
“I can’t stand being around you, because I’ve always had a crush on you, and it frustrates me and I guess I just wanted to hate what I couldn’t have.” Harry admits.
Inwardly Harry was groaning as working together made it necessary to be really close to Draco causing the blonde’s cologne to waft past his nose, causing Harry’s pants to harden. He smelled so good, Harry longed to reach over, grab the insufferable boy and kiss him. But Harry tries to endure in silence.
Harry’s moans were music to Draco’s ears as his tongue continues to roam over Harry’s body.
“Bloody hell, you feel so good.” Draco cries out as they both start to get close to their climax.
Laying in his bed he allowed his brain to think about the child inside him. He wondered briefly if it would be a boy or a girl. Though he felt very strongly that it was probably going to be a boy.
Pulling back out Harry quickly thrusts back into the hilt, moaning as he does, loving the sound of Draco’s own loud groans mixing in with his.
Harry sat down with Ron and Hermione.
Draco pulls Harry close to him and wraps his arms around him, holding him as they fall into a sex induced sleep, thankful that it was a weekend and that most people were going to Hogsmade today.
Harry noticed Draco’s eyes travel over the bags they carried.
When she nodded, Harry felt tears form in his eyes.
She’s swinging herself on the swing,
“I want you to fuck me Harry, I need your rod buried in my ass.” Draco growled frustrated at Harry for not getting it.
Harry then placed himself in front of Draco and points a wand at Lucius.
Not a moment too soon either, as soon as they had resumed their places at the cauldron cutting and measuring ingredients and stirring their potion again, Snape walked back in earlier than expected.
Harry unfurled it and with a pounding heart read
Draco then grabs the can of whipped cream and sprays in along the same path ways as everything else making sure to put extra on Harry’s cock.
“Kids?” Hermione whispers then blushes
Once the house became visible to them, they entered the house carrying their suitcases. He watched as Ron and Hermione took in the newly remodeled house.
“I was actually in the room of requirements hanging out with Draco.”
“Have you done this before?” Harry asked softly even as his fingers continue to fuck Draco.
Harry giggled a moment before he hurried to the room he shared with the other seventh years that had returned to finish their classes.
As I got older it was my job to maintain the house while they were gone, my job to learn what ever my dad wanted me to learn, one time my mom talked my dad into letting me go to the park to play for a bit cause it was good for my complexion, when we got there I started playing with another kid there building sandcastles and things.
Harry sighed relieved. Leave it to Hermione to know everything, even things like that.
Finally the boys had just finished the second potion and had two more hours to spare before Snape was due back.
Harry went back to work, cleaning out the old clutter, and replacing it with the things Sirius loved. He threw out the black family tree and replaced it with an Evans/Potter family tree instead.
The house was dark and there was spider webs everywhere he walked in. Harry pulls out his wand and got to work.
Draco shrugs.
Ron gave Harry a look of pure sympathy.
Harry fixed his eyes on Draco, and to his own surprise spills out words he’d never have considered saying, but can't seem to stop himself from saying anyway..
Albus strokes his beard.
Harry looks at the mediwitch is surprise.
Ron made a disgusted face before it was replaced by one of amusement.
“I Mean if I’m going to be forced to be with someone I don’t love It would be nice to experience being with the man I do love at least once.” Draco quickly adds.
After one last hug from Molly he pulled away and walks over to a spot and pulled up a picture of Grimwauld place in his head, and was there quickly.
Harry strode inside hiding his feelings about tonight's detention as best he could. No reason to give either of them the satisfaction of knowing how  badly Harry was going to hate this.
“Now that both of you are here, I will tell you your assignment for tonight.”  Snape started drawing out the words slowly acid clearly dripping from his tongue.
He glanced through the gap in the door and sees Lucius pull out a wand and point it at his son. Harry felt fear grip his chest as he heard Lucius utter the next words.
Harry doesn’t stop.
Finally after some minutes Draco responds “There was never any reason for you to hide how you felt Harry, cause you see if you had told me this a long time ago you’d have found that I feel exactly the same about you, but I never said anything cause you acted like you hated me so I never saw the point.”
Harry nods
Snape went acted like he was going on a business trip and put up the unplottable spell, and made himself the secret keeper. Being a master at protecting his mind from Voldemort made him perfect as a secret keeper.
“I hope” Harry whispers.
Harry felt hot tears fall down his face as he finished getting back into robes and headed downstairs. He wished with all his heart that for once Draco would chose himself instead of what his family wanted of him.
“Good evening, Mr. Potter.” The Portrait spoke.
He leads them to the room he was suggesting for them. Opening the door he let them walk in first. Then follows them pointing out the other doors inside.
First thing he did was clear out the spider webs, and fix the lights in the house. He then magically changes the flooring into beautiful tile floors.
“Hi Draco, how’s it going?”
Draco cuts it off and says
Harry felt his heart catch in his chest, as he noticed that Draco carried a plastic bag in his hands with things hidden inside. Harry took a moment to take in the sight of Draco in such a vulnerable state, and felt himself fall just little more in love with this blonde Slytherin.
Harry walked up to him and pulls him into his arms.
Harry shook his head.
“Fine, you two can leave, I won’t punish y’all this time, but I will stress next time y’all decide you want to have sex, try to be more discreet and don’t use my storeroom or classroom to do it.”
Harry shrugged. “I didn’t really sleep last night, I was plagued with nightmares.”
When the Weasley’s noticed there was no car there to get Harry they looked at Harry questioningly.
“Meet Me at the Room of Requirements, we need to talk.”
Double checking that the door to the roof top was fully locked and putting up wards to keep anyone from thinking about coming up there.
Draco shakily pulls away from Harry.
“No. After what you tried to just do, I no longer want any part of you, You are no longer my father, nor will you ever have a part in our child’s life. My Harry is not a Pawn for helping Your image, My Harry is my boyfriend, and the father of my Child, And I will do everything in my power to protect him and my child. For now on, You are Dead to me.”
Harry pulls out of Molly’s embrace.
One was a truth potion, and the other was one nobody had gone over yet. Harry decided he’d look it up to see what it was later.
“See, that door there leads to your own private bathroom, and that one leads to what I was thinking would be the nursery.”
“Mr. Malfoy, what pray do I owe for such a visit?” She asked sternly.
Draco points to Harry’s clothes.
Harry instead of going back to the dinning room to eat heads up to the Gryffindor common room. Going to Ron he tells him what Draco had just told him.
“It’s all going good, Daphne and I are just out shopping for her dress and me a tux for our upcoming wedding next summer. We figured it’s never to late to start getting fitted for that custom made one of a kind wedding outfit.” Draco responds smiling looking happy.
Harry just nods “Yeah, and if anyone finds out he could be killed along with the child.”
Draco was more important than food. The words looked like it had been written with a shaking hand. It was enough for Harry to be concerned enough to not even stop to eat.
But finally when he woke up throwing up again for what seemed to be the millionth time he finally appearated himself to Saint Mongos to get checked out.
Lucius looks at Draco trying to withdraw his earlier words and actions but then Draco responds
Neither one of Hermione were acting the least bit like they were weirded out by what Harry had said to them.
Breathing heavily he stayed still for a moment to catch his breath before pulling out of him, fear of what was next now filling his mind.
“I’m sure you two will figure out a way to keep each other safe.”
When a Metrowizard has sex with a witch, a sperm is then released and the girl gets pregnant, but when a metrowizard has sex with a wizard then an egg is released instead and the metrowizard is the one that gets pregnant. But unlike a woman, a metro’s birth canal is located near the anus.”
The whole wizarding world is officially invited to book the date and attend this Huge Malfoy Wedding.
“Are you going to be okay Mr. Potter?”
“I agree, I pity the poor professors that have to teach that kid in another eleven years.”
“yeah.” Draco responded.
But Ron only starts laughing.
Draco’s resulting moan, encourages Harry to deepen the kiss, pulling the blonde closer. Harry’s hands start to lightly explore Draco’s chest as Draco’s groans continue to grace his ears. The sound was like music to Harry’s ears, and everything inside Harry desired to keep Draco making these noises for him.
As the fire danced over their naked skin they decide to chat for a bit to give their bodies a chance to recuperate for a bit after the third time of doing it.
But he knew that it was wishful thinking. Part of him almost wished he hadn’t agreed to have sex with him, but deep down he knew that having it once, was better then never having it at all.
Harry walks over and opens the door to the soon to be Nursery.
“You guys can have the second master bedroom if y'all want it. Just like my room it is attached to a nice large room that would make an excellent nursery room. Both of our rooms have a door that leds into that one. We can share it for both our babies, between the three of us we can help each other with the babies.” Hermione’s eyes lit up at the idea.
Draco drops down to his knees using his hands to push Harry’s legs further apart before leaning further down and dragging his tongue from the sack of Harry’s balls to the base of the tip, and even flirted his tongue over the small slit of Harry’s cock.
“And for now we’ll try to make sure it stays that way.” Harry assures him.
Draco laughs.
Lucius eyes darkens with Anger and he points his wand at Harry!
Harry felt a lump form in his throat he does his best to try and swallow past it. He wanted to cry as he read the headline. Draco would be marrying Daphne not long after Harry would be giving birth to his child.
Harry paused a moment then responds
Harry watched Snape glance at the time and clearly looked disappointed to find that Harry had actually managed to be on time, giving Snape no ammo with which to take points.
“I have no idea what I’m going to do when Summer comes, where am I supposed to raise this child, I can’t go back to Malfoy Manor so now what?”
“We’ll take two Phoenix Tear Cribs, please.” Harry tells them.
“You say your story wasn’t anything like mine, but honestly yours sounds much worse.” Harry tells him softly.
It took weeks for Harry to finish fixing up the house. But he enjoyed watching the house slowly start to become a home rather than the dim, boring way it had looked before.
The mediwitch runs several tests before returning to the room smiling.“Mr..Potter, your not just an ordinary wizard, you are what some call metrowizard. Metrowizards are a bit rare, Metrowizards are born with slightly different arrangements in their bodies. Metrowizards are always male, but are born with both a uterus, and a penis both.
“I bet our children will become best friends.” Harry laughs.
“That actually does look good though.”
Hermione hugged Harry.
In front of Harry landed a piece of paper.
“I’m fine, I think I fell and it knocked the wind out of me, sorry for staring, It’s just your so hot..” Harry pours almost drooling.
“I saw you talking to Ron during class, and I saw him ask you if you wanted to talk somewhere, and then I heard you tell him no, I’m just curious as to how come?”
Draco who was accompanied by Daphne looks between the three of them
“It’ll be interesting to see which of yall’s features the baby will have more of.” Hermione responded with thoughtfulness.
The two share a kiss again before they went there separate ways to dinner and to bed.
Harry had already sent a letter to Vernon to tell him they didn’t have to come get him this year, that he was no longer going to be living with them.
Harry looked at Ron in surprise that he’d guessed it when Ron slid a copy of the daily prophet in front of him.
Draco blushed
My dad came over and drug me away and beat me with his cane, shouting the whole time that Pure-Bloods do not associate with muggles or even Muggle-born wizards. He kept shouting that they were beneath us and I shouldn’t even talk to them much less be building castles with them.
