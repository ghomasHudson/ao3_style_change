She recorded the fever, malnutrition and slight infection on a piece of parchment and, using her Patronus, sent the results to both Neville and Madam Pomfrey. When Madam Pomfey’s Patronus came back with hers, Hermione knew she’d made the right choice to tell her.
There were other students he recognized, of course, and other friends of his as well. Hannah Abbott, Brogan Crowley, Tracey Davis, Seamus Finnigan, Daphne Greengrass, Sally-Anne Perks, and Genevieve Parkinson. Fay, Ginny and Felix were all Odins too.
"Uh uh." Ginny shook her head and pointed at Harry with her fork. "No, I know how you get on a case, and I'm aware that this case has been harder than most. This isn't that. So, instead of lying about it or being vague....why don't you just talk to me?"
"Well of course he doesn't owe me anything!" Harry pushed away from the table and stood. "I don't....I don't know if I'm strong enough to face the part where he doesn't understand or feels threatened or something."
"Alright, everybody, gather around. The Chief has been very clear on what he wants to do, in regards to current cases and this new one," Assistant Chief Nexwell addressed Harry and Draco's team.
Severus nodded and walked away, back to the window he’d been staring out of only a few minutes before. He had a lot to think about, and a great deal to figure out.
When Hermione put an exam and pen in front of him, she leaned forward. “I was chosen over the summer and couldn’t tell anyone. We’re the Head Squad. We’ve each been chosen to carry out certain duties, as Head Students. We’ve been vetted and given parameters and we’re also in charge of the Prefects. It’s all a little wild. I’ve got to go, I’ll tell you more later,” she said in a rush as she moved to put exams in front of other students.
“I wanted my priests and anyone who worked in my temples to be holy and reverent, honest and good. People who would counsel those among them with only light and truth in their hearts. It’s what my ritual is for,” Opishanata explained.
“Yeah, thankfully. Tallie, Camilla and Rupert all wound up separated across the other houses. Luna was very quick to gleefully tell me that,” came Neville’s reply.
They'd been partners for three years, but they'd managed to become friends only a few years before that. Because of their long history, and how hard they had each worked to become friends and work-partners, Draco wasn't about to let Harry put himself or others in danger because of whatever was going on.
Astoria sat down on the sofa. She waved her wand, a little lazily, and her patronus appeared. Her butterfly patronus flew around the room for a few seconds before vanishing.
“If you lot will stop talking, please,” a man at the front of the room said, addressing the room and not just Harry and Neville.
Hermione watched as Harry slipped into sleep right in front of her and then she got to work. Diagnostic spells worked best when the patient was awake, but they still worked -- regardless.
“I could not be here,” Ru said solemnly. “It was not entirely my fault, but I am sorry that it was as if I had taken a lot away from you.”
“‘Mione, you know they gear up for back to school in August. It’s August. We have to make do,” Harry replied.
Hagrid’s hut had been redesigned into a large gatehouse (one of two); which was fine because he hadn’t been back to the castle since the end of Harry’s fifth year. It was now the only entrance in or out of the Forbidden Forest from Hogwarts.
“So, the killer found her in Leeds and brought her here to kill her?” Draco asked as he made notes in a little notebook he kept in his jacket pocket.
"I don't want to jeopardize the friendships involved -- mine and Draco's, Al's and Scorpius. I don't want to mess anything up. I can't have him hating me while we work together and I don't want either of us to have to transfer," Harry explained.
By the gods, he’d thought this summer -- the very last he had to spend with them -- would be better. But it wasn’t. It wasn’t even close to better. In some ways, it was much, much worse.
Petunia was determined to be moved out of 4 Privet Drive by the third week, and she’d set upon Harry the task of helping her pack up the whole house and secure the furniture.
Harry put the dollar-sized trunk into his pocket and slipped on his backpack. He grasped the small key in his hands and did as he had been instructed.
“Oh, Ru,” Harry said. “You didn’t. I know you needed help. I would have helped you if I could. It’s just been such a lonely couple of months.”
“Don’t be rude at my dinner table, young man,” Lady Longbottom said as she thumped a hand on the table.
Alice is Neville and George's daughter. (Yes, Mpreg, because MAGIC). She's Lily's same age and named after Neville's mum. They also have Fred (eldest) and Roxanne (middle).
That night, however, Harry’s friends descended on Longbottom Manor -- to the disapproval of Lady Longbottom, who hadn’t wanted to open her wards to anyone else. Luckily, it was Neville’s home too and he overrode her.
Neville rushed in a few minutes later. “I’m sorry I wasn’t here. Here, help me move him into his room -- we’ll get him well again.”
Harry sighed. He knew they’d get to it eventually. Resigned, he nodded. “Yeah. Let’s talk about it.”
The group hurried to buy their supplies and then left the shop and joined Molly and Arthur. Harry was very concerned about what Draco had said, but it wasn't like her could ask him about it -- Draco had gone so suddenly, Harry barely believed he'd even been there.
There were about twenty questions, almost all of which asked for introspection and the evaluation of self. Some of them asked about his hobbies, and a couple of the questions were about being given choices between two things and which path would he take.
Before lunch, Harry would find himself in the family parlour. He’d sit with Neville’s grandmother and talk. They’d talk for an hour, sometimes more.
"Harry, just tell him you're in love with him, for Merlin's sake. You'll feel a lot better once it's out in the open and you don't have to brood about it anymore."
Harry nodded and then gathered his things and left. He needed some time alone -- or somewhat alone, actually, because he fully intended to go to his room and talk it all through with his cluster.
“Today, we will be sorting you into your houses,” she said. “There are new Hogwarts Houses and Slytherin House no longer exists. Every single student will be re-sorted. If you choose not to re-sort, you will be asked to leave. Additionally, for the remainder of the year, each and every one of you will be randomly tested for the Dark Mark. If, at any point, you refuse to be tested for Riddle’s Mark, you will be asked to leave. If, at any point, you become Marked, you will be arrested.”
Delphinium laughed. “It’s not a rude question, Gusta. I think it’s valid that he asked it, and I’m happy to answer.”
“Severus needed some of the herbs that Neville grows,” Augusta explained. “It was a simple matter to find out. Now, what about the states? Any news from the packs there?”
The case board was already laid out and the members of their team were ready and waiting. Evidence bags, though there were few, were laid out on a table that was pushed against the wall. At the back of the room was a strip of counter with a sink, electric kettle and a coffee pot. There was a cold-cupboard at one end as well. The smell of freshly brewed coffee filled the room.
Draco shook his head. “You’ll have tried. Our lab team can’t figure it out. I thought you’d have a better time. If you can’t, you can’t. It’s not a big deal, Friedrich.”
Draco sat on top of the desk in the middle of the room, though there was also one at the back that he much preferred. "You've been in a funk for the last three weeks. I don't know what's going on, but you're going to tell me. This case that we're about to introduce to half of our team could prove to be very dangerous. You'll put us all in jeopardy if you keep living in your head the way you've been doing. Tell me what's wrong and how I can help."
“Luna sees him regularly. Cloestra is busy with Declan and her job. Eve is dealing with the situation with Draco. None of us have the time, right now, to bring Harry up to speed. We’ve all been blocking him, you as well, you know,” Severus said.
Harry scrubbed a hand over his face. “We do have a latent print. It took over two weeks to process. I swear to you, Dray, if we don’t get this person within the next month? We’re done. They won’t resurface for another two years.”
The main (ground) floor had the kitchen, living room, play room, powder room and dining room. The basement held his office, a small potions lab and a storage room that they mostly kept sports equipment in. They also had a large back garden with a garden shed that he'd turned into a greenhouse. The front garden was very small and only really big enough for a bench and a couple of flower beds.
Al and Scorpius left the living room, with Al nodding solemnly to Harry and Scorpius giving him a smile.
Draco pushed Harry forward. “Remember, you have to face it. Whatever it is. If you don’t, the price is very high -- magically.”
The movers arrived the last morning and took away every single stitch of furniture, as well as all the heavier boxes.
Severus nodded. “Yes. It didn’t take them long to secure the portkey. Romania isn’t strict, as you well know.”
“Yes, and I think Evelyn will be here later. I’m so sorry we’ve put you in the dark, Harry. We love you a great deal and didn’t mean to abandon you, I swear,” Cloestra said.
“I think you’ll find that you’ll fit in fine, Harry. You were one of them from birth, after all -- even if you weren’t raised that way.”
Ron grumbled and mumbled for the rest of the day, whenever they spoke about school or Harry's other friends, or about the war. By the end, Harry'd had enough.
As he wondered where to go once he got to the landing, a door to the right of the long hallway swung open and a House Elf wandered out.
“Lilt is happy to show you to the lift,” Lilt said as she led Harry down the hallway to the right, a little ways.
“I know. I know. I don’t want to give up on you, on us. This is just….it’s already so hard and we’ve only been apart for a few months.”
"Kerr, Pye, Andrews, you'll finish working your burglary case -- when you're ready to arrest, just make sure you let one of your Captains know before you proceed. Dune, Emil, Fitzpatrick, you will all be on duty for whatever Captains Potter and Malfoy need during the entirety of their new case. They'll fill you in," Nexwell explained.
“So, what you’re saying is that...we’ll do the whole ritual with a few minor changes which will lead us to the culprit?” Harry asked, confused.
"I honestly don't care one way or the other, Ron, but I want you to make up your mind and stop complaining about it," said Hermione.
His intention to apparate to London and take a room at the Leaky was interrupted with a swift, loud knock on the front door.
Harry stepped back and leaned against the wall as Draco took the spotlight and couldn't help but stare, with his peripheral vision, at his partner. Draco was best in front of their team, way better at communicating and directing than Harry -- though Harry was excellent at demonstration as he had been since his 5th year at Hogwarts. It was thrilling to see Draco in action -- either in front of their team or in the field. It was definitely one of the things that had opened Harry's eyes to how attracted to Draco he was, though, of course, not the only thing.
"What if he hates me? What if he's disgusted and freaked out that...that I've loved him for years? What if he doesn't want to be work partners anymore? What if...?" Harry trailed off and Ginny could clearly see the tears in his eyes.
He liked his job. He felt useful and knowledgeable and he was still very dedicated to the work -- though he worked less often than he once had. He wasn't sure he wanted to give up the actual work to aid in overseeing a department -- which would be the next rung in the ladder, if he decided to go for it. Currently, he and Draco reported directly to Assistant Chief Nexwell, but they also ran a team of Aurors to help them in case-solving. Any unsolved cases moved to the Cold Case Department and they would, occasionally, be consulted.
Soon enough, it was Harry’s birthday. The day passed quietly, with Neville occupied in one of the greenhouses and Harry holed up in his room -- completing holiday work, resting and practicing magick.
The group began moving through the tables and giving a piece of parchment and an inked quill-pen to each student.
with him. There was a lot that they knew about each other that they hadn't known as kids and it'd helped to mend things between them. Harry had been pretty obsessed with Draco throughout school (he could admit it now) and he'd kept tabs on him after their 8th Year and during Draco's four years at University. He'd lost track of him after that, for a while, but they'd gotten to know each other again just after Draco had married Astoria.
“You need to tell him you’re in love with him. You need to just say it, to get it all out in the open and put it on the table, as the muggles say. It’s doing you more harm than good to keep it inside and to pretend you aren’t madly in love with your best friend.”
"Ron! If you're so scared, why don't you just stay home and take your NEWTS when the war is over!" Harry yelled. They were in Ron's room, looking through their new school books. Hermione was sitting at Ron's desk, but Harry had been sitting on the floor, leaning against Ron's bed.
Considering it was the renovated and remodeled home in Godric's Hollow, the one he'd lived in as an infant, Harry was really proud of the home he'd created here and he was even fairly impressed with the amount of space they'd been able to carve out. The contractors had outdone themselves -- especially considering Harry hadn't wanted to use any wizard-space (though, of course, he'd been fine using magic).
"Oh Harry, no. There's nothing to forgive. You can't help how you feel. And....it isn't selfish to tell him. If he's indifferent to you, then you can begin to move on. Besides....you don't tell him like you expect anything back. You tell him it's a gift and that you have no expectations but that you thought he should know. You tell him in a way that is gentle and kind and not as if he owes you anything," Ginny said.
“It’s just Zach’s mother. According to Zach, his father had other business. Daphne's aunt is one of the Heads too.”
Dudley had panicked when he’d realised that Harry wasn’t going with them. The exchange -- Dudley’s real worry and fear for Harry -- had repaired a lot that had been damaged between them over the years.
“My grandson has the East wing. You’ll find him on the fourth floor, fourth door on your right. Have a care, the stairs are a mountain,” she said before she moved swiftly through an archway on the left and out of sight.
Harry loved Draco. He'd loved him for a long time, but it was only the last few weeks that he'd realized he was
There was a long table at one end filled with food and beverages. At the other end, a record player played the latest, top 40 Wixen world songs. There were a handful of squishy armchairs and a couple of couches for people to lounge upon.
“They seem very couple-y,” Hermione replied. She inspected him closely for a moment before dropping into the chair next to him. “Are you alright, Harry? Everyone’s been so worried. No one’s heard from you in weeks.”
“I’m staying in a room down the hall. I had no idea that Neville’s family were this well-off or that they had a home this huge. Did you know?” Hermione asked in her usual firing-questions way.
Harry finished showering and dressing and then put on his gear -- the Elder wand in a holster on his right hip, his normal wand (the holly and phoenix feather) in a holster on his wand arm, his invisibility cloak was in a a pouch on his left hip, and he wore a magic-proof vest under his shirt and his Captain's badge was secured on his breast-pocket.
“Good, good.” She pointed her wand swiftly at his trunk and shrunk it. She handed him a small key. “Focus on that. Get the feel for it, feel its magick, and think of my grandson. Then apparate. It’ll get you where you need to go.”
“Little Ru found out the hard way. Her father overreacted about the cluster and had her locked up in some sort of Asylum,” Cloestra explained. “I know we’ve left you out of it, but it wasn’t just you, I promise. We left Draco out as well. And we would have left Luna out of things too, if we could have -- but her connection with Ru, and her gift, well...these things wouldn’t let us.”
Harry, Neville and the rest of the Odin House followed Master Peverell up to the seventh floor and off to the left, through a set of double doors, and into a large common room.
“Draco, I get being a shut-in...or being agoraphobic, but we might need him to testify to his discovery, so that we can prove why we need a warrant and why we have cause,” Harry said.
In the basement of his home on the outskirts of London, Draco smashed the small potions bottle against the mirror.
“I dunno. A year, maybe? I’m not sure they ever defined it that way, though.” Harry shifted uncomfortably on the chair. By the gods, his body hurt. He was having trouble hanging onto the conversation with Hermione.
Harry took a few sips of tea and then set the cup back down. He shrugged. "No, it's nothing. You know I get like this on a hard case. It's just the case, Gin, that's all."
“You should have let the hat place you in Slytherin,” said his reflection. “We would have done better, there. Formed ties that bind, rather than these weak, familial feelings you have for Ronald and Hermione. When was the last time you heard from them, exactly? He lives in your house, for Merlin’s sake. And she...purports to be your best friend does she?”
Harry raced to the mirror. A grey and pearly white mist swirled in the reflection. When the mirror began to vibrate, they heard a voice.
“I don’t think we really understood how lost and abandoned you felt, even though Luna tried to tell us,” Draco said.
Harry hated to admit it, but he was really struggling. The first three weeks of the summer holidays spent with the Dursleys were just brutal.
Harry stayed on at Neville’s, but he’d join Hermione at the Weasleys', in the room he had there, in a couple of weeks.
“Harry, you must understand. You were at your relatives, where it isn’t safe to do magick, let alone be part of our cluster. We were trying to keep you safe. It’s not as though Luna didn’t keep us aware of what was going on,” Cloestra tried to explain.
She slipped into the en-suite washroom, with its bath and shower connected by a different door, to get ready for the day. When she was bathed, brushed and dressed she headed downstairs.
“Why didn’t you just say that? Why go on about a tracking spell?” Harry’s voice was exasperated, but not angry.
Severus stood in front of a large window in the living room. He wore a gray shirt with the sleeves rolled up and dark green trousers. The marking on his left forearm was stark in the bright room, but it didn’t bother her -- she knew that the allegiance he’d once had to Riddle was long, long ago.
He was happy Luna had come in for the day, instead of staying in Romania, because without her he wouldn’t feel connected to his family at all. He desperately missed Draco, Evelyn, Cloestra, Ru, Severus and Charlie. He wondered, not for the first time, what was going on that was keeping them away.
Vernon had shoved Harry, snarled at him not to do any damage to what had once been their home and told him he better defeat that man.
"He loves Astoria, Gin. They only divorced because she was worried he wouldn't move on with his life, but....he still loves her. He's....he's unravelling about her health, and you saw them today -- they seemed so close and so in sync. He'll never feel that way about me and how can I be so selfish as to tell him I'm in love with him when his world is clearly still wrapped around her? It's selfish and I can't do that. Not to everyone involved. They'll never forgive me," Harry explained.
“Okay, good.” He checked the time. “Scorpius is asleep and he doesn’t have school tomorrow, but I should be back in only a few hours. If you need me, use your patronus. It...you’re still able to cast that one, right?”
“You have rarely asked for my help over the years. Even when you should have,” said Friedrich, though his voice held none of the coolness Draco would have perhaps expected.
“Viktor, good to see you,” Harry said casually. He couldn’t figure out why Viktor was there, but he hadn’t lied -- it was good to see him.
“And your friends?” said his reflection. “Let’s please talk about your choices there. They take hideous advantage of you and always have.”
The tears dried and Harry smiled over at Severus. “Now, would someone please fill me in on what, exactly, happened?”
Draco frowned. He shoved Harry off of his desk and grabbed the bag. He turned the vial this way and that, underneath a brightly lit desk-lamp.
“This is the only real birthday party I’ve ever had,” Harry said quietly to Neville. “I’m so grateful, Nev. Really. I can’t thank you enough.”
Harry was relieved by the room-assignments. He’d been worried that the rooms would be markedly different from previous years, but he was wrong. It was just the same as Gryffindor -- the 7th Year boys, minus Neville, would all share a room. The 7th year girls, minus Sally-Anne, would also all room together.
"I dunno," said Harry. "It's hard, not being able to see him. It's harder, knowing that most people think we're on different sides of the war."
Classroom B was a large room that was set up a lot like a classroom but with adult-sized desks and evidence-gathering and briefing materials. There were other rooms like it on other floors of the Law Enforcement Department (which was a building separate from the Ministry building), but this one was specific to Harry and Draco's team. They used it during every case.
“He’s not kidding, mate,” Ron said as he flew to the ground and hopped off his broom. “Come on, everyone, we’re done here. Not enough people for a proper game anyway.”
Neville grinned down at Harry. “Luna will be over later, too. You were busy in your room, so I came out here and got roped into playing Quidditch.”
"I'm worried." Ron said. He jumped off of his bed and began shouting. "I have a younger sister, I have parents, I want to have a life! I don't want to die young and I certainly don't want to go to school for a year, looking over my shoulder every minute!" He stomped his feet. "You've got less to worry about! And you've got stronger magick!"
The next morning, Ron, Ginny, Harry, Hermione, Molly and Arthur, went to Diagon Alley. They weren’t so late as to be in crowds and crowds of people, but they were late enough that Hermione complained about the lack of variety in supplies.
“Well, you could have just asked me,” said Harry. “I’ll do just about anything to catch this guy. He’ll go to ground soon and we’ll have to wait another two years!”
“We’re not what I would call friends, but...I’ve known him most of my life. He’ll be able to figure this out and we both know how important that could be,” Draco responded.
Harry’s eyes widened. Japan? Did Remus have news of Hikaru? It was only his training with his cluster that kept him from blurting it out.
Draco gave a genuine smile. “No. He’s a valuable member of the Masters League. He’s a Potions Master, but that isn't all he is. All the judge will need, all the Head will need for that matter, is the report. They’ll run with whatever he’s said in the report, trust me.”
“Yes. I mean, I’ll have to be in and out, because, you know...I’m on the run, a bit,” Draco said. “But, yes.”
“You may call me Master Peverell. Our house is named after the Norse god Odin. My office hours are posted on the notice board in this classroom, as are the rules and expectations. You will report to this classroom after breakfast each morning, except for weekends. Please follow me up to the dormitory. Prefects will hand out further instructions when we get there.”
“Are you the new head of the Order, Augusta?” Remus asked. “And is this really a safe conversation to be having in front of Lady Greengrass and Mr. Quartermain?”
“I must caution you that there are two new mandatory classes. You will also receive an abbreviated map of your classes in the morning, as things have changed. Please fill out your sorting examination and then turn it in. Breakfast will begin in forty minutes.”
"He isn't a Death Eater," Harry said quietly. "But it's safer for you all to think that then the truth."
Friedrich nodded and turned, towards the kitchen. “I’ll be back in a moment and you can tell me what this is about. As long as it doesn’t require me to come to London, I’m sure I can help.”
"Lieutenants Dune, Emil and Fitzpatrick," Draco said. "We'll meet you in Classroom B for the briefing. Lieutenants Kerr, Pye and Andrews, you've got your orders. When your case is finished, Captain Potter and I would very much like you to join in with the rest of the team and we'll brief you at that time."
“Did you always want to play?” Harry asked, directing his question to Neville and completely avoiding what Ron had asked.
Harry nodded and looked around more carefully. “So, what were you doing alone in what appears to be Neville’s room?”
Harry wrote letters to his friends and his cluster, but he only sent off the few messages to his friends. He felt confused and lost over the lack of his cluster -- only Luna was checking in regularly.
“I’ve been in the States,” Remus said. “I gather that we’ll discuss it over dinner, for I’m certain it’s part of the reason Augusta invited me. I don’t typically fit in with her lot, as you might guess.”
Harry flopped down on his bed. There were tears pressing against his eyes, but there was no way he was going to give in to them.
The mirror, which stood against the wall, was old, gold and a family heirloom. It had been enchanted, long ago, by one of his mother’s clan (of Veela).
Harry felt afraid. He knew what the truth would be and he struggled, for a moment, to look upon his own reflection in the mirror.
“They can’t figure out what it is,” Harry said simply. “It’s one of our only pieces of evidence and they have no idea what it is.”
Harry turned from where he'd been standing at the sink, staring out at the falling snow. "Thanks for taking care of that, Gin."
They were distracted then by being asked to sit and once they’d taken their places, two empty seats apart, the first course was served.
“Hermione hasn’t,” Harry argued honestly. “She always wants me to be my best self and to do things right -- even if that’s always code for what she thinks is right. And I have, in the past, done stuff her way to avoid an argument or worse. I’m not ashamed of that. I love her, she’s my family.”
"I know I can trust you, Potter. I'm here, if you need me. As always," Draco replied and then they left their office and went into Classroom B.
“I imagine not, but, still, you have. As has Charlie and everyone else. Luna talks to him a lot, but she hasn’t told him what’s going on and I know...I can feel….he is confused and sad and hurt and angry that we’ve abandoned him. It is not without grief of my own that I have left him alone these past weeks.”
Harry relied on Draco for adult conversation, funny stories, working on cases, companionship and overall friendship. They had a really good working relationship and, at this point, a really good friendship. Al and Scorpius were good friends and looked forward to going to Hogwarts together. Draco and Scorpius were even coming for Christmas and Boxing Day later this month. He didn't want to ruin things with his feelings -- feelings he wasn't sure that Draco returned.
Draco frowned. “Uh, no. It mirrors you. Shows you into yourself and you have to be willing to be honest and face yourself. It’s why it can kill -- and be used to kill, depending, but I think we’ll discover all of that once we catch the perpetrator. I think it’ll come up, during trial, what he was after and how he used this to kill people.”
Once done with breakfast, the students began leaving the tables to find the classroom they’d been instructed to go to.
Draco nodded and brushed a hand over the small satchel that he wore in a cross-body position. “I think he can help with the case. I’m a little nervous. It’s been a few years since the last time I saw him. Will you be okay, you and Scorpius, while I’m gone?”
He also really loved spending time with the older man -- their relationship was simple and mostly physical, though there was a great deal of friendship and respect on both sides. Their long and somewhat complicated history never seemed to get in the way of their bond. It always put Draco at ease, and in better sorts, to spend a few hours by Friedrich’s side.
Harry winced. "I really wish people wouldn't call them that. It's a horrible moniker, but, also, giving these people these glorified Serial Killer Names makes everything far too attractive to people who want to seek the lime-light."
"The worst thing that could happen, Harry, is that he simply doesn't return your feelings. Do you really think anything else -- anything else bad -- would come of telling him how you feel?"
They sat at a small table in front of the window, with the sunlight coming in and a view of the back garden and the pasture. Draco could see the horses in the distance -- Deacon and Marie.
Harry sighed and got up from the sofa. He'd been sitting in his home-office for the last few hours, just thinking about everything and remembering his and Draco's long history. Now, though, he needed to get ready for work. According to the missive he'd received, Chief Rabastan had a new case for them.
Harry glared at her. He didn’t care if it made him seem childish. None of this was fair. Why had he been cut off while everyone else saw each other?
It wasn’t a permanent or dedicated relationship, by any means -- Draco was still committed to his (ex)wife and their child. If he was honest with himself, Draco couldn’t see himself being in a relationship with anyone else anyway, especially considering that he was, and always had been, in love with Harry Potter.
They walked into the circle. Draco closed it, with a chalk line, a scatter of herbs and a few words, behind them.
He stepped back through the portal and hoped that the work he’d done, and what he’d discovered, would help Harry and Draco to track down the culprit.
“Probably. Right? I guess my gran is going to be here too, to teach a class and provide security back-up, but she won’t live in the castle.”
Draco sighed. “No. He’s a bit of a recluse and he doesn’t know you. Regardless of you being...you know, who you are...he spooks easily.”
As Harry walked into the second classroom on the left, on the fourth floor, he felt the absence of Draco most keenly. As if he’d conjured him, Draco appeared next to him.
She waved that away. "It's probably not. I mean, I see it and so does Hermione, maybe Neville. Possibly Luna. But I'm 99% certain no one else knows or sees."
"For Merlin's sake, Ronald," Hermione interrupted. "No, he's not saying that. He's saying that you have the choice. You could not go. It would be okay. Harry doesn't have the luxury of choosing to stay home. But, you do. So, if you're worried and scared and if you feel like you can't make it through the year, then stay home!"
Harry recognized her right away -- he’d seen her at a distance before, at the train station, but he also recognized her clothing from the Defense class with Lupin and Neville’s boggart.
Master Peverell nodded at Theodore before disappearing through a door at the right side of the room.
When he stepped out of the portal, he was greeted by a cat. The cat was striped orange and white and had very pointy ears and a very bushy tail.
"Okay, tell me about it," Ginny said as she got up to refresh the teapot. "You wouldn't talk about it last time and I know part of that was because, at the time, we were estranged. But...we're better now, fixed I'd say, so....tell me. I can help you with your perspective."
The mirror absorbed the potion and the glass turned into a swirling, purple vortex. He was about to step through when Astoria walked carefully into the room.
They were each given a set of dark gray pajamas for the night and a set of robes for the morning and told to settle in.
“Work a little on your anxiety. I can practically see it rolling off you in waves. Trust me, Harry. If we do everything right, tomorrow night, we will solve this case -- once and for all.”
“Yeah, just the usual. I’m fine, Moony,” Harry replied and then he changed the subject. “Where have you been? I haven’t seen you since...since...uh, since you took Hermione to school last year.”
“I…” Harry began gently. “I should have let the Sorting Hat put me in Slytherin. I won’t deny that. It’s part of who I am and part of my history -- the choices that I made. It would have been hard and different and I wasn’t ready. I wanted Ron to like me. I didn’t...I didn’t want to be like Dudley. I didn’t want to be like...like Draco, at the time, either.”
Severus followed after her and said nothing until she’d sat down and served herself some food and tea.
Harry stepped away from his body, in the sensate-style of a kind of astral projection. He appeared at Luna’s side.
As soon as the ward-checking was done and it seemed like their teams had split off into their separate groups, Draco pulled Harry into their shared, private office.
“What in the name of Merlin are you lot doing?” Harry said, using the sonorus charm to amplify his voice.
“I’m learning to play Quidditch, for reasons that escape me,” Hermione replied as she flew down to hover near him.
They were in the Japanese countryside in a home that had a much more English style. The house wasn’t large, but it was homey and lovely. She didn’t know if Severus owned it or if he was renting it just to take care of her, but she was grateful either way.
Over the next few days, after being declared well and fit, he often joined Neville for a couple of hours in the greenhouses every morning before breakfast.
He went up the stairs to the ground-floor and into the kitchen for a cup of coffee before he needed to shower and change into his Auror gear. He picked up a few stray toys in the living room and deposited them in the correct bins in the playroom before heading up the stairs. On the top floor, he turned into his bedroom, with its en-suite bath and walk-in closet. Andromeda's rooms were across from his. The floor below him was where the bedrooms for his kids and Teddy were -- James and Albus shared a Jack-and-Jill style bathroom, but Lily had a bathroom of her own. Teddy also had a bathroom of his own.
“My family and the Greengrasses have been long-time friends and in some cases business partners. I have known Delphi, and her siblings, since they were in their infancy. My connections, Mr. Potter, could greatly aid you in the war,” Lady Longbottom said.
Really, Harry was tired. Both sides were judgmental and bigoted. One thought that muggles and muggleborns were not worthy of having magic, the other side thought most purebloods and all Slytherins were all evil and potential future Dark Lords. At one point they even hated Harry, ‘symbol of the light’, just because he talked with a snake!
Someone should have probably taken a photo of Professors’ Snape reaction after that question. His eyes widened and his face became as pale as inhumanly possible, his mouth slightly open in shock. The surprise lasted only a few seconds, before anger took over.
The next chapter may come after Christmas... so in the meantime Happy Christmas! Stay safe ya'all :)
He couldn’t believe it. It couldn’t be right. But he had done the spell five times and each time delivered the same result: that damned white light.
Him and Draco finally devised a plan to get detentions with Snape long enough that he could quit the Quidditch team. The plan was to be caught stealing Dreamless Sleep from Snape personal reserves. Everyone in Gryffindor, and many of the other houses knew of Harry’s violent nightmares, so they would not be surprised if he wanted a higher dose than prescribed. Draco warned the professor in advance of their plan, and after acknowledging it was the safest way, they planned for it to happen the day before the next team practice. After that, there were only two weeks until the last game, so two weeks of detention would be enough of an excuse to quit.
“We are going to help you. Of course, we are going to do whatever it takes to protect the blob” Sirius said after he released them.
This chapter was a rollercoaster of emotions and was very difficult to write. Snape is very difficult to describe as a character... but I hope it was not too OCC.
And if swallowing his pride and asking for help to the man who despised him ever since the day they met, was the only way to make sure his baby was safe… he would do it.
“Harry, calm down. Listen to me. We need someone to trust in the castle, he is the only adult I trust here.”
“I had stuff to do” he chose to reply shortly and headed quickly to the showers to avoid more questioning. He took his time under the water, basking in the warmth of the hot water splashing on his body. He tried to relax his body as much as possible, knowing that sleeping in the dorms was going to be hard for the next two days.
The nausea and morning sickness continued, but Harry finally found a few ‘safe foods’ that he could ingest, so he at least didn’t starve, the house elves in the kitchen helped a lot too.
Draco had helped a lot during the hard times of realizations that came one after another. First his professors, deaf and blind to what was actually happening in school, then the Headmaster, and finally his friends, one after another, that kept disappointing him.
“Professor… those spells you did earlier… do they tell if the baby is alright? I’ve been flying and-” he fiddled with his hands and looked at the ground, he felt his face heat up “-and we’ve… we’ve been intimate…” the last bit was told almost as a strangled whisper.
Draco interrupted him with a kiss. “Harry. Look at me. We’re in this together. I know as much as you do, we’re young and we have time to learn everything step by step.”
The two boys spent the whole weekend in the Room of Requirement, talking about the future, about the change in attitude of Professor Snape, cuddling and just being there for the other. Sometimes they laughed, sometimes they cried, but they both knew, as long as they were together it would be alright.
“Of course, why else do you think we are looking at wards stronger than those at Grimmauld? We are even considering the
After thanking the professor once more, promising to be careful and arranging for a reason to get detentions to have an excuse to avoid flying and having more time to talk and think for solutions about the summer and next year, Harry once more hid under his cloak and headed out. Draco lingered for a few more minutes, whispering hurriedly with his godfather and finally hugging him before rushing out to catch up with his boyfriend.
Since the big fight with his friends, Harry had suddenly found himself with more free time, which he chose to dedicate to Draco.
Draco sighed and moved a strand of hair behind his ear. He kept it long to appease his father, but in reality, he despised the long hair and thought it was really uncomfortable.
Draco, who was blushing madly at the beginning of his godfather’s rant, suddenly paled and looked at Harry with panicked eyes.
Harry was startled out of his thoughts when he heard the Room give access to someone. He turned sharply towards the door. Draco was there, paler than ever and with a worried expression, his breath was ragged, as if he had run the entire way from the dungeons till there. He probably had.
“Draco, of course you’re included in the offer. Wherever we choose to go there will be a room for you” Remus added.
Draco’s cool hands firmly guided the vial to Harry’s lips, and slowly guided the trembling boy to the couch in the room behind the office, the professor following them silently and closing the door with a few muttered spells.
“Hi cub” they also hugged and when they let go Remus had a confused expression “you smell different”.
“My baby is having a baby” Sirius sobbed “He’s all grown up” and he proceeded to hug both boys with a death grip.
Harry decided that it was useless continuing to discuss. He locked is things in his trunk, took his wand and closed the curtains with a locking spell, and added a silencing spell for good measure.
The ‘Dark Side’ wanted him dead. Obviously. And they also wanted Draco dead, ever since he refused to take the Mark during the last summer. He had run away to seek refuge with the Order of the Phoenix, but he was not given a warm welcome. Dumbledore was glad to give him a chance, Snape always supported him, and Sirius and Remus were happy (Sirius was
Harry scoffed “Please, Sirius loves you, but I’m not talking about the baby, I’m talking about the fact that I have to go into hiding as soon as he is free… looks like we are not destined to live together… he will be so disappointed” his voice broke on the last sentence.
"He is not here at the moment. I'm his mother, I'm sure I can pass on your message when he next visits." It was a well-practiced lie, one smoothly repeated to each new boy that came to her door looking for her son. The son she barely saw anymore.
Right. Well. Harry supposed he should think of a way to get rid of the problem, at least momentarily.
Just the fact Potter was already getting all friendly and calling him by his given name for the first time in all the years they'd known each other was a lot for Draco to keep processing, especially considering they hadn't really talked about anything that happened in the past. Sure, Draco did apologize and Potter did accept it, but Draco was under the impression they'd have to have more conversations about it. Yet, they hadn't really and even despite that things seemed to be going smoothly.
"Wait. You both are okay with this? Harry, you didn't think this was pertinent information to write us about?"
They grabbed a butterbeer each, and mingled around. Pansy had let Hermione take the reigns through this ball—just followed her lead and played her part.
"Sure, mate. I'll go get you one, you keep Draco company." The ginger smiled as innocently as he was able, and hurried out of the kitchen, smug as could be.
When Harry made his way downstairs, he overheard voices drifting from the kitchen. He recognized the grating, bullfrog lilt as Kreacher's and assumed the other person must have been Malfoy.
Currently, Harry was doing his usual of reading through the numerous requests they received. He picked up the newest one, an elegant thick envelope sealed with a vaguely familiar seal, though Harry didn't bother placing it. He cracked it and pulled out the folded parchment to read the letter.
"Draco." Harry's voice broke the whispers and murmurs, solemn and gentle as it was. He needed to break through to Malfoy, needed Malfoy to focus only on him so that he could start settling him down. He'd only ever experienced two situations where he had to console an extremely stressed Veela in his time as a CMC agent—but it had never been quite this bad before. "It's Harry—Potter."
He'd gotten himself back on track. He spoke to Harry every day, about his day and how he was. Harry always responded in kind. He slammed doors when Draco had told him a coworker attempted to flirt with him, which made Draco inordinately happy to see, that Harry still loved him enough to get jealous. He rumbled and shook the entire house when Draco had come home happy because he'd gotten a promotion, to the point that he knocked Draco over in his quaking.
"Gin told me they have to undo it." Astoria quickly slipped into their wing and put up their usual wards.
Now they were at King's cross, waiting for the Hogwarts express. Harry felt a giddy sense of anticipation, as he scanned the crowd. He knew Ron and Hermione planned to return by today, so they could all sit together on the train.
"Sit in front and steer towards the Manor. I'm fairly certain your parents don't have much time to spare." Harry directed and Malfoy paled another shade before getting on the broom in front of Harry and kicking off high. "Make sure no Muggles see us, I'm not going to Azkaban for breaking the Statute of Secrecy." Harry scolded, just for something scornful to say. He felt as if he
"How do I stop it then?" They bloody well couldn't live here if every time Malfoy suffered night terrors the entire house would start to fall apart.
It was an experience Harry really did not want to repeat. The pale splashes of skin among his own on his right arm still itched sometimes.
"Not in a two guys kind of odd, just...these two specific guys kind of odd. The Savior of the Wizarding World and....a Death Eater."
Then Harry realized that that really wasn't supposed to be his first concern in the situation. He was strangely okay with the position they were in though.
Harry briefly considered lying to him, but then what would be the point of that? If they were going to start actually acknowledging each other, then they might as well start off without lies.
Pansy had a bit of a crush, nothing of it. She was pretty sure it was reciprocated anyways, so she wasn't too bothered.
Hermione whipped around and stared at the woman, unable to believe it for a moment before the words filtered through and she acquiesced.
"It was probably Justin and a few others—It's the same thing we did to Malfoy and—and they told me it was just a prank! That they'd lift it after a day, maybe two—I had no clue they would do it to you too Harry—"
Hermione's tone was pleading, eyes painfully hopeful, but all Harry could do was put his toast down uneaten and sheepishly gape at her.
"You are not the first that has come seeking Draco here, nor will you be the last, I suspect." If her tone was bitter, well, that bitterness was well-earned.
Draco carefully felt along the wall to find the doorway, and lead Ron to it. The ginger knelt down and jammed a hairpin into the lock, fiddled with it until a soft click gave way.
He couldn't even bloody apologize either—It would mean explaining he'd lied and then Draco would undoubtedly ask for the truth.
"Adorable, man. It's adorable." Zach filled in, rubbing his neck awkwardly but offering a small smile of support either way.
He startled and lifted his head slowly to study her features. There was a furrow in his brow—doubt in his eyes.
"Where's his office?" He asked and Ron, who looked just as flabbergasted as the rest of them, pointed it out with an unsteady hand.
"So—beautiful—" Harry kissed the words into Draco's neck, nipping at the skin and leaving a mottled bruise.
"Harry, you're look peaked. Are you okay?" Hermione leaned closer from Harry's left side, her face arranged into worry.
"Kreacher is not harmed." Kreacher confirmed. "Master Black told Kreacher not to tell Master Harry how he could barely sleep or eat. Master Black told Kreacher not to tell Master Harry about the nightmares. Kreacher is now telling Master Harry this because Kreacher's house was almost destroyed because of Master Black's nightmares."
"As far as I'm aware, there is—an old ritual that was used by individuals that wanted to take more power than they were due." Her voice sharpened. "It never ends well. Though I suppose we'd be using it for a rather different purpose."
Ron slapped him on the back far more forcefully than was strictly necessary and grinned wide at a bewildered Pansy:
"Would be nice to see them again..." Ginny trailed off quietly, pathetic hope dripping through her voice.
"What are we going to do?" He asked helplessly instead, because for all his cunning he didn't know how to evade death.
"What do you mean—" Lucius geared up, but Ginny seemed to catch onto Harry's ruse and come to the rescue:
He had to rut into the bed to keep from going stir crazy with lust, so determined to take his time with Harry.
Draco only then belatedly realized that he must've been snarling and yelling in rage without consciously deciding to.
"Nothing. Kingsley called me in a week after the trials concluded, told me Draco's magic was unstable and he had to have someone to monitor him or they'd toss him back into Azkaban. Of course I agreed."
When Harry pulled away, he found Draco staring at him with wide, feverish eyes and swallowing heavily. He shakily nodded, then stepped around Harry and steeled his features as he marched straight into the Ancestral wing, not looking back.
Draco had stepped even further into Harry’s space now, smirking. “Leather’s a new look for you,” he commented. “Trying to be a bad boy, then?”
“He’d definitely love you for it, but Narcissa and Andromeda might not. He’s a handful when he’s got too much sugar in his system.”
“Hmm.” Draco turned to face him, sliding one hand up his arm as he moved closer. “That’s enough history for one evening, don’t you think?”
“Ah. It’s probably for the best that you didn’t pursue that plan; you might have passed out in a much more awkward position.”
Capulet and Montague exchanged a tense handshake, and the teams were off. The game was fast and brutal, both teams toeing the line on potential fouls so frequently that Lee Jordan, who was serving as referee, was kept constantly on the move as he tried to monitor the madness. Harry soared above the melee, trying to block out the worst of it so that he could concentrate on finding the Snitch. As the score got tighter and the fouls escalated from ‘toeing the line’ to ‘sprinting past it whilst flipping the bird,’ however, Smith evidently got tired of trying (and failing) to score and took to tailing Harry instead, keeping up a constant stream of vitriol in a desperate attempt to distract him.
“Darling!” Narcissa pulled Draco into a hug as soon as she pulled open the front door, not even allowing him to set down his luggage. Draco tolerated the embrace as long as he could, but soon made a noise of protest as his arms began to ache where they still clutched his bags. He had managed to make it to Hogsmeade station and through the town to the house without incident, but he was feeling distinctly travel-worn.
“We were on the Gryffindor team together for six years, of course we’re friends,” she said dismissively. Greg looked like he was trying extremely hard not to laugh. Apparently, Draco wasn’t the only Wasp who was over this contrived feud.
Harry huffed out a laugh, bringing his hand up to rub Draco’s back. “Trust me, I’m not any happier about this than you are. Not that I don’t love Teddy, obviously. But timing-wise…” He trailed off before kissing Draco’s temple and pulling back, forcing Draco upright. “I’m really, really sorry.”
Teddy groused, and, rolling her eyes, Andromeda gave him permission to begin distributing the gifts.
They chatted about this and that—rumored Quidditch trades for the new season, the hideous art that Harry was now burdened with after his brief stint as a figure model (which Harry assured Draco was very much a one time thing, no matter how much Draco teased him that perhaps he’d finally found his calling), and Pansy and Ginny’s upcoming nuptials, which managed to lead back into why Harry was here in the first place.
He also had, unfortunately, a significant amount of guilt about leaving his mother alone in Wiltshire, even after his father had died last summer—a fact which she had, finally, decided to use to her favor. After a year and a half of settling accounts and apportioning off property and, finally, selling the Manor (with Draco’s full approval; good riddance to bad rubbish, in his opinion) she had now moved into a new home on the outskirts of Hogsmeade with her sister Andromeda and her grand-nephew Teddy, and she wanted him home for the holidays. And by the holidays, she meant the entirety of December. And Draco… well, after eight years abroad with only two brief Christmas visits in his first years away and one short trip home for his father’s funeral, Draco didn’t feel that he could say no.
“Hi, Malfoy. Do you have a minute? I wanted to talk to you about something.” Ron’s cheeks were pink from the cold air, and he looked serious, and perhaps slightly apprehensive, but not upset.
After poking around the boathouse a bit more and examining the pier, Harry, Hermione, and Luna headed back toward the house. Greg and Ron opted to stay behind and take out the canoe.
Over the course of the evening, he learned that Sadiyah was a modern dancer and dance instructor and hadn’t attended magic school in order to pursue her passion; that Owen and Rose had been friends back in school and that Rose was also a friend of Luna’s; and that Sullivan was not, in fact, a fitness model, but
“Of course, that isn’t an issue with Muggle whiskies,” she explained, “but the makeup of the firewhisky has led to a number of regrettable combustion events over the years.”
Harry stared, trying to keep a straight face. Leela had not been exaggerating. The canvas was made up of splotches of vivid colors arranged into a sort of… well. He couldn’t come up with anything, actually. It reminded him a bit of Dobby’s portrait of him from his school days, in that he had no clue which parts of it were supposed to be him.
“Perfectly alright,” Draco said stiltedly, still feeling like an interloper. So Harry was still with his own Weasley, then. He wondered why she hadn’t come along when Harry had taken Teddy into London.
"Better that he's not, really," Ginny said. She dropped her voice to a whisper. "Blaise will be there, but he's pretty worried."
James, Lily, Al and Scorpius were playing on the floor while Andromeda watched over them from the big chair by the window.
After lunch, he would take a walk through the grounds while Neville attended to family business, magickal study and the business of helping to run the home.
Madam Pomfrey’s polar bear nodded her great head and then opened her mouth. “Fever Reducer for the Fever, obviously. I’ll be sending along a few nutrition potions. I’ll send them through the floo, as that’s quickest. Tell Mr. Longbottom to be expecting them tomorrow. In the meantime, the Antibiotic Agent should work as a kind of cure-all -- if you have that available. If not, you might try
"You've seemed off all day. Don't get me wrong, you've been there and it was a really fun party. Lily had such a good time. But something's been off, Harry," Ginny said.
"We don't know if this killer is a man, Ginny. But yes, they are back. If we don't catch them this time, it'll probably be another two years before we get the chance again."
Harry went around their outer-office (much like a muggle police office) checking on the wards and ward-objects. Some wards could be put up in a more permanent fashion but others, like eavesdropping wards, had to be secured to an object and would, over time, wear thin and need to be renewed.
Harry gathered a small tray and the slices of lemon-drizzle cake he kept just for Ginny's visits -- it was her favourite. He grabbed the biscuit tin too. As he moved to place them on the kitchen table, she filled the kettle with water and gathered the cups and prepared the teapot.
. He needs rest and food -- start with a good, strong broth. If he’s holding that down well, a light, well-rounded meal would be fine.”
“Now, Mr. Lupin, please tell us of your trip to the states and what you were doing on-leave in Japan for the past few days?” Augusta said.
On the other side of the hill stood a house and a few outbuildings. The outbuildings comprised a shed, a chicken coop, a small paddock and a tiny horse stable.
Draco went inside, followed closely by the cat, who ran off into another room as soon as the door was closed behind them. The house was dim, cool and neat as a pin.
“It’s all set up. Just follow me, into the circle, and I’ll close it behind us. We can’t leave the circle until the ritual is complete, Harry. And it might be tough. It will bring up anything you’ve been suppressing and the same is true for me, okay?”
Neville shook his head. “No idea. I think...since the Headmistress mentioned there’d been a lot of changes and new courses…. I think it has to do with that.”
They had both (Harry and Draco) worked so hard to get here -- top marks in all of their training courses and they had worked hard in the three years of training too. They'd each gone through a wide range of partners in the fifteen years since the Final Battle of Hogwarts. What they had now was a stable camaraderie that Harry depended on. He didn't know if he could risk this -- the friendship and working relationship he'd learned to lean on. It was Draco, after all, who had been there for him when his marriage to Ginny had broken up -- Ron hadn't been happy about the initial separation, four years earlier, and he'd stopped speaking to Harry; they'd only just reconnected in the last year.
"Now, Ron," Arthur interjected as he stopped in front of Flourish and Blotts. "I've only just overheard Hermione, but your friend has a point. We should all be more willing to open our minds to each other. Not all Slytherins go dark, and if you don't believe me, just look at our family. Your grandfather, my father, Septimus was a Slytherin and he was the nicest man you could meet."
“Related to Daphne?” Harry asked Lady Greengrass from across the table where she sat closer to Augusta.
It was fifteen years after the war and even though Harry was only thirty-three, he already felt as though he'd lived two lives, maybe three. He didn't know how to start over now, or if he even wanted to.  His children were still pretty young and even though he and Ginny had been divorced for three full years, he didn't want to shake up their lives anymore than necessary.
Harry grinned, but then shook his head and pointed at the bag. Inside was a vial of shiny, silvery-white powder.
“Harry, me, you, Gin, Neville, Viktor,” Hermione counted out. “We’ll have enough for an abbreviated version, once Luna gets here. We just have to remove a couple of players and not play against each other, but, rather, just play to make goals.”
“It won’t get fouled up, I promise,” Draco said and then he changed the subject. “So, you’ll need to come to my house...I can’t tonight, but...tomorrow?”
From Harry’s view, its faded red brick, dozens of windows and large, white columns looked like something out of a different century.
Harry glanced around too. “Let’s hurry up and get back to Molly and Arthur. Ron’s right, this feels weird.”
Harry stared at the wide, grand staircase. The steps were huge and they seemed to go up for a very long time before he could see a landing. He took a deep breath and headed up the stairs.
“Right. Well. There’s the small matter of what might happen once we start. After we complete the ritual, the magic will take care of the rest and we’ll get a trail of crumbs, so to speak, to follow which will lead us to the murderer,” Draco explained.
"Draco and I have been having little fights, spats, I guess," Harry offered. He looked up at the backs of Ron's parents and dropped his head. He really hoped they hadn't heard him.
Harry nodded. The hat thing was one truth he could handle -- he’d thought about it often over the years. The things about his friends, though, wow. Not so easy to take, that.
As he left, it occurred to him that Scorpius really fit right in with his family. He wished Draco would too, but he knew it was a waste of a wish.
"I'm not ready to talk about it. When I can, I will. For now, I promise my head will be in the game, on the case -- I won't put anyone in jeopardy. I promise," said Harry.
“I know, but it’s a bit difficult…” Draco trailed off and then pointed to the mirror he had set up at once side of the room, with the ritual items. “See, it’s literally a mirror. So, the ritual mirrors you. It shows you…”
Reflection-Harry in the mirror nodded and then said. “I find myself satisfied with those answers, but I do think there’s a great deal more with which you should come to terms. Shall we discuss the real secret here?”
“My brother is the head of the family as the only male heir and takes care of all of the business matters of Greengrass Horticultural Society. I head up the greenhouses, they’re my purview and the plants and flowers were always the thing that most interested me. My sway is light and always has been, regardless of my sorting,” she explained. “I have no desire to bow to the Dark Lord, and my friendship with Augusta goes back a long way -- before I started at Hogwarts.”
He hadn't meant to fall in love with Draco Malfoy, of all people. But, he had. And now that it was real to him, real for him, he didn't know what to do about it.
Luna was in Neville’s room, cuddled up together on the sofa by the window. She looked up in surprise when Harry appeared.
“The one I met at dinner?” At Neville’s nod, Harry continued. “Is that why your grandmother wanted me to meet her?”
"Love, we're magical. We, as a whole community of witches and wizards, have a very open minded view on same-sex relationships and things -- even in Pureblood circles. Because we have magic. I mean, you've seen Neville and George and you've been with them out and about....you know they're accepted, as are their kids. This isn't quite the crisis situation you've made it up to be in your head. I promise, it'll be fine -- on that score. Sure, he might be a little freaked out and he may not return your feelings but.....everyone likes knowing they're loved, Harry," Ginny said.
It was during the fifth detention, more than a week after the first interaction with the professor, that they really talked.
The professor seemed startled by the sudden declaration, and awkwardly coughed. “Potter. I don’t hate you. Sure, I never liked you either, given my history with your father, but you have to realize that the main reason why I behave the way I do in classroom is because of my involvement as a spy. The school is full of Death Eater’s children ready to report to their parents of anything I do.”
Professor Snape sighed “You are most definitely pregnant. If I’m not wrong about 9 or 10 weeks pregnant. So you’re between your second and third month. Male pregnancies usually result in premature labour due to the fact that the male body is not as accommodating as the female one, so your delivery date could be estimated around the beginning of November. Since you are on the thin side it could even be the end of October, but to guess more accurately we will have to watch how the next months go.”
“And a male pregnancy is hard to hide with muggles all over, as soon as you start showing you would have to hide inside the house all the time or use glamour spells that might be too taxing on your magic”.
He slept in the dorms only a few times and spent the rest of his nights in the Room of Requirement. Draco would be there with him most of the time too, as Snape now promised to warn him every time the Slytherin dorms would be checked. Every morning the Room would provide a huge mirror on the wall next to the bed, and Harry would raise his shirt and turn right, then left, then right again, looking for any sign of swelling, for a sign that the baby was really there.
Well… Apparently, wizards could get pregnant. According to the books they had found in the library, not every wizard had that ability. It was usually an ability inherited by pureblood wizards that descended from families that survived the Witch Huntings in medieval times. So many witches were killed during those persecutions (especially the red haired ones), that wizards had to find ways to maintain the spices. Those spells and rituals to make it possible for men to get pregnant were now lost, but the muted genes were inherited generation after generation by pureblood wizards of ancient lines.
The door of Professor’s Snape office opened as soon as Draco’s hand had left the dark wood of the door. Harry was still under the invisibility cloak, and he tried to make his steps as light as possible following inside the room, his fingers tightly locked on the end of Draco’s school robe.
Harry did as instructed and nervously watched as professor Snape waved his wand all over his body, small coloured lights erupted from it. Throughout the whole process, the professor was frowning, the lines on his forehead deepening as he continued the process. After he was done he quickly excused himself and disappeared in the fireplace after shouting ‘Hogwarts’ infirmary’.
“If you trust Severus, then so do we.” Sirius declared. Harry was so proud of his godfather for this.
Draco paled and widened his arms, shifting so that he was completely covering his boyfriend, he looked warily at the wand still pointed towards them and spoke quickly, voice trembling “Severus, I’m sorry. It’s not a prank. I swear. It’s not an emergency, but it is important. Very, very important. So important that no one can know Harry is here and this was the quickest way to get into your office, and-”
“Draco is not pregnant, professor. I am.” Harry took a step forward, and Draco wrapped his arm around his waist.
in the arms of his beloved. He always wanted children, ever since he saw how happy the Weasley family was despite their money problems. He craved that happiness like a drowning man craved air.
“I merely made copies of a few records for my little first year snakes. The matron knows I take care of my snakelings.” He smirked “I may or may have not taken the liberty to make a copy of Potter’s record in the meantime”.
“I have no idea… Maybe we should read those books some more today, learn more about all this.” Harry sighed.
Harry froze on his tracks, he straightened his back and listened in silence as two pair of footsteps made their way towards them.
Professor Snape was sitting at the desk, surrounded by papers and books. He looked up from the parchment he was scowling at (probably a badly written essay) and raised a brow at the teenager in front of him.
Worried about the silence, Harry continued “We know that we are too young and that it’s dangerous, but we’re really happy about the baby, and we are going to do whatever it takes to make sure he or she is safe and healthy”.
“They are not healers and Sirius is still on house arrest waiting for his trial.” Draco raised an eyebrow; he knew he was winning the argument.
“Draco.” The professor once again had their attention, even though Harry was still not totally lucid.
“Then who-” Harry stopped in the middle of the sentence and suddenly shoot up from the bed, looking wide-eyed at his boyfriend “No.”
Then, Draco patiently explained the history and the reasons behind the gene, and how the test worked. They passed the rest of the evening reading through every book Draco brought from the Library. All the symptoms were explained, and the papers were clear: Harry could be pregnant.
Together with the morning mail, Harry finally received a letter from Sirius. He hid it in his robes, and after asking Neville to cover for him he got up and went into an empty classroom to read without interruptions.
Draco stroked Harry’s hair, which was as messy as ever and murmured “I love you too. I love you both”.
“I know… I’m sorry” Harry was looking at his feet. He could not stand the piercing gaze of the other boy. “I felt that if I met your eyes, I would break down there in front of everyone” he whispered, his lips trembling.
Harry paled and shot Draco a panicked look. The other boy chose to catch the awkward moment to make his presence known.
His beathing was quickening, his fingers tingling, the tell-tale signs of a full-blown panic attack, when a vial of clear blue liquid made his way in his trembling hands.
“I-I don’t know…?” he stuttered “I don’t know anything about pregnancy… would it hurt the baby?” he stared at his lover with frightened eyes.
“Professor… I grew up with muggles. Until two days ago I didn’t even know it was possible for men to get pregnant. No one ever told me.” Harry’s tone was bitter.
“Why, thank you for the compliment, Potter”. The professor’s face was impassable, but for the first time in forever, his tone when talking to Harry was not condescending.
Draco leant down and kissed the other tenderly. At first, slow and sensual, then he seeked for entrance and soon they were enveloped with passion, tongues dancing with each other. Each time Draco sucked on Harry’s bottom lip he moaned and responded by sucking on the other’s top lip. It was like a little ritual of theirs.
“Which goes super well with our plan to buy a house!” Sirius exclaimed, thrusting his hands in the air.
When Harry officially hit 11 weeks of pregnancy, a little bump started to be noticeable (that, only if Harry was naked and you knew where to look) and both fathers were so proud and
Harry shot a worried glance at Draco. They still had one more month until school would be over, by then he would be 14 weeks pregnant, and showing. He thanked the heavens their school robes are very large and could hide the bump. And he still had Dudley’s old jumpers that could hide him when he was not in class. The problem would be changing in the dorms or taking showers with the other boys.
Harry was so scared when he started to realise he liked Draco as more than a friend, and that on top of the stress for the Triwizard Tournament had almost killed him. At the time he wasn’t speaking with his friends, the whole school had shunned him and belittled him and his budding relationship with Draco had been a secret for a year. Plus, the adults weren’t helping at all in that situation, and he was sure someone was trying to kill him. It was too much stress for a 14-year-old boy.
“Thank you, sir. I know you hate me, and this must not have been easy… for what matters… I’m sorry this happened but I’m not going to regret it. I love Draco and- and I think I already care a lot for this baby. I will to anything to protect it… and if you want to be involved… as Draco’s remaining family, I-I will be okay with it”.
Draco posture suddenly went rigid, but he looked at his godfather with all the seriousness he could master, given the situation “We’re keeping it. Him or her… they’re our child. It is a little too early than I imagined… but I’ve known for years that this is what I wanted. A family with Harry is all I ever wanted for my future”.
When Sirius had fire-called him to talk about the tournament, he had collapsed in tears in front of the fireplace, begging Sirius to take him out of the school and go on the run with him. Because anywhere would have been better than there, even running for his life with Dementors at his heels.
Ron was still a child. And Harry had to grow up fast, he never had time to think about childish things, and he found that other than Quidditch, he really had nothing in common with his friend.
“Harry!” Draco shouted in surprise, his expression was horrified, their faces were now mirror images of embarrassment and shame.
They continue to work in silence at their respective works, until the end of the detention. Before letting him go, the professor told him he would look into hiding places and asked if he would be alright to hide amongst muggles.
Thank you to everyone reading and keeping up with my slow updates... every comment and your support just keeps motivating me to continue this story :3 I have already many ideas for the next chapters... the baby's name has already been decided!
In the end they decided to drop all the options in the city and were left with two houses that were quite isolated in the countryside, with a wide space for both the wards and a big space around the house to fly, play and enjoy some freedom, since they were going to spend quite a bit of time coped up inside.
Harry arrived at the Shrieking Shack over one hour before the time agreed with Sirius. Draco was with him, and he was sitting on a dusty chair while he warily watched his boyfriend walk up and down the small room. Even though outside was sunny, inside the shack it was still quite cold, so every now and then he would shudder and use a warming spell on both of them.
Draco frowned. “No… I meant… how many months? Weeks old? How do we measure when it- no, he or she will come out?”
“Women usually start showing between 12 and 16 weeks, depending on their body type. Males usually start showing earlier, due to the lack of space for the foetus to grow, and you are on the thinner side, so you could be showing anytime now.”
“What if you need help before the end of term? What if you start showing while we are still in school?” Draco’s voice was getting louder and louder with each remark.
“I-I d-don’t know” Harry sobbed, his arms unconsciously wrapping around his abdomen “Is it going to harm the baby? Oh god… I’m already doing this all wrong!”
Crazy. Everything was crazy. And in a few hours he was sure he was going to regret making this decision, but he trusted Draco with his life… and the baby’s. So, he decided to take the leap, hoping that he would land safely.
“Now, let’s be honest. Potter, your school record has only the injuries you sustained after your stupid Gryffindor acts. There is no record of health checks in first year, and no sign of either vaccinations or blood tests.” He sighed and looked at a few of the parchments with weird look before continuing “This could be blamed on simple neglect to remember that you grew up with muggles, or could be intentional. I still can’t understand which of the two it is… but I will need to take your blood and see what we can do about the vaccinations.”
Sirius was the first to enter the room, his face visibly lightened up as he noticed that Harry had already arrived. He didn’t hesitate to give his godson a fierce hug, while Remus stood by the entrance, smiling.
house, you once told me you would do your best to be what my father never was for me. I need that. No,
“Why else would he start hanging out with you, then?” Ron shouted. The other boys in the room hurried to hide behind their bed curtains. After a year they learned when to take cover.
Draco nodded “Yes, we will not be returning to school next year… we need to find somewhere to go into hiding until it’s safe, or at least until the baby is born and Harry is no longer vulnerable.” He said.
“We know it will be dangerous, but frankly, professor… I don’t think I want to keep fighting anymore, I lost too much and now that I have more to lose… I would not survive losing Draco or the baby. I don’t want to be a tool anymore, the only thing I ever wanted was just being Harry. And I am able to be that person only in front of Draco. I can’t keep the façade for much more.”
Draco was the first to speak up “So… what was the result?” he was so nervous he kept licking his lips and wrangling the ends the sleeves of his robes.
“I, Severus Tobias Snape, swear on my magic that I will not tell anyone what shall be told in this chamber until either Draco Malfoy or Harry Potter tell me otherwise, and no harm will be done to Harry Potter by my wand or words as long as he does the same.” The tip of his wand glowed gold for a second before the professor turned to the boys “Well? What did you do?”.
But lingering on the “what ifs” was useless. After a while, Harry had cleared his voice and smiled at his friend “You know, ever since I was little… I always wanted a brother. I guess having a godbrother could be just as good.”
The adults headed to the door, not before giving a few more recommendations, some more congratulations, and a few more hugs.
“I was joking. Ron. Listen, I appreciate that you guys are worried about me, but it’s not necessary. I trust Draco. And if you really were my friend, you would trust me on this”.
Draco picked up the pace and started moving his hand together with his mouth, taking as much as he could of his length.
Harry was starting to panic. Now you couldn’t tell the difference, but in a few months his stomach would start to grow… what was going to happen to his body? Did he even know how to take care of a baby? What would they do?
Sure, he had Sirius and Remus, they were amazing uncles and he saw them as father-figures. But it was not the same as having a
He could not help but doubt every adult figure in his life. Every adult he knew had let him down in some way or another. Even Sirius had made mistakes, and even if it was due to a rash decision which led to his unjust imprisonment, Harry could not help but wander sometimes what would have happened if his godfather had been more mature or clear headed at the time. Following that, then the Dursleys, then McGonagall not listening to him. Even Dumbledore had been deaf to his cries for help and never actively tried to be on his side, despite all the times he tried to be a ‘friendly grandfather’ by calling him “my boy”, Harry had come to understand that in reality, he was only a tool for the war and the old Headmaster never really cared about
“Well then, move over” the professor stood up “Potter, I need you to lay on the couch and stay still. I will use a few diagnostic spells to check your health status.”
Ron avoided him, sitting with Hermione in every class and ignoring him during mealtimes in the Great Hall. Harry avoided him just as much, sitting with Neville in class and with either Luna, Neville or Katie in the Great Hall. The rest of his time was all dedicated to Draco in the Room of Requirement.
Realization flickered in the other boy’s eyes, then he gulped “I will be in more trouble than you are, I’m the one that knocked you up.”
Harry appreciated that the professor was not forcing for more details. He was giving Harry the power of controlling the pace of the conversation. It was something no other adult had aver done with him, not even Sirius.
The second day was better, and by the third, Harry no longer dreaded going to the dungeons. The professor was still quite cold, but the silence was almost a relief after the hours spent around shouting teenagers in the halls. Harry was horrified by some of the discoveries he made reading the books, and the professor was as professional as ever responding to his questions.
Katie cornered him after the meeting, asking if he was alright. Harry smiled and shrugged, telling her the half-truth that his sleep deprivation was taking a toll on his body anyway, and he would not have been able to play at his best anyway. She smiled sadly and hugged him tight, telling him it was alright, and he was forgiven. If she saw his eyes glinting with unshed tears, she pretended not to see anything.
They had a big fight in the common room and ever since the ‘Draco is a Death Eater’ topic was dropped, but their relationship had become strained. He knew they were still whispering about the topic behind his back. Harry really could not find it in himself to trust them as much as before. At least, not until they proved to grow up a little and stop being bigoted.
Class went just as usual. Snape took points from Gryffindor because Ron and Dean talked instead of revising the material, and after dismissing the class, he asked Draco to stay behind.
Hermione was the more rational of the trio, but she was also very firm of her beliefs. Harry had seen her defend fiercely her opinion and try to convince others that the only way to think was hers. And he had heard her snide remarks when Dean and Seamus were seen kissing once in the common room. It was not a pretty sight. What would she say if she found out he got pregnant at 16, while still in school and at the beginning of a war? She would become insufferable.
Remus laughed and proceeded to also hug the boys “You better give up, when your mother was pregnant, he also called you that, and let me tell you, she hated it. James, on the other hand, he thought it was funny”.
The question was thrown at him as soon as Harry returned to the sixth years male dorm in Gryffindor tower.
“They want me to be part of your family” Draco was equally moved, his eyes shining with unshed tears.
Draco kissed his cheek and sighed “I know you aren’t. But the baby is. He or she is so small, they still can’t defend themselves… you have to take care of your body to protect them.” Then Draco turned to speak once again with his godfather “which is another reason why we need your help. We don’t trust Madame Pomphrey to keep this a secret from Dumbledore and we don’t trust the headmaster. You are the only adult in the castle that I trust, and you have enough medical knowledge to be a Medi-healer.… ”
Harry also stated to notice more changes in his body. His skin never looked better, and his moods were changing unpredictably. He was more conscious of every movement of his body, and during class he was always on high alert in case something went wrong with stray spells or pranks.
That was a conversation he really wanted to avoid. Being the one that got pregnant would give the professor enough hints about their sex life, and he really didn’t want him to know
Draco pulled the covers over them and embraced the other boy, making sure his head was snuggled against his shoulder. “Everything will be okay. I promise.”
“Draco, I remember telling you to use that pattern only in case of emergency. Emergency as in imminent death or-” the professor squinted for a second and slowly raised is wand.
“I can guess from this little outburst, that the reason you need my medical expertise is not for an abortion. Am I right?”
with the idea of him being a Death Eater on a secret mission. She thought there was some kind of conspiracy. Things got out of hand when she tried to get Ron’s help to go trough Harry’s things and steal the Marauders’ Map.
To tell the first detention with Snape was awkward, it would be an understatement. The professor made him sit on the sofa in the office and gave him a stack of books on pregnancy and child rearing, that he would only be permitted to read in the safety of his heavily warded office. They talked very little, and the tension was palpable, but at least neither of them insulted the other. It was a first.
Harry suddenly realized that while he was egoistically thinking of himself and avoiding everyone today, Draco must have gone crazy with worry. He felt a pang in his heart for the other boy. He stood from where he was sitting on the couch and made his way towards his lover.
He even avoided Draco’s eyes in class and during lunch break, because he didn’t trust in his ability to pretend nothing was wrong.
Harry nodded “They never liked me for what I was. I grew up thinking I was a freak” he shook his head, as if to get rid of the bad memories “I don’t want Draco to see that”.
Harry was having a small freak out of his own in the meantime. In the last few days, he hadn’t thought of Voldemort at all. Not a single thought about the murderer on his tail, for the first time in almost six years. Voldemort was after him, and if he didn’t stop in front of Harry when he was a one-year-old baby, what could stop the monster from harming their unborn one? A strong surge of protectiveness erupted in Harry’s chest.
“Oh” Draco was at a loss at what to say but moved towards the other boy and hugged him. They stayed like that for a moment and then Harry continued. “I think we should involve him. I trust him with my life, and he will love the baby… I’m sure.”
Harry slowly took off the cloak and tried smiling sheepishly at the professor, but he was sure his face muscles were showing more of a painful grimace than a smile at the moment.
Harry smiled “He must not have been happy. But then, I don’t think he knows how to be happy. Do you think he needs to get laid? That would explain why he’s always grumpy.”
And once again the white light shot from his wand, creating a warm and soothing sensation around his stomach.
“Be careful and be ready for when we will take you away, and please warn Severus that we will approach him soon”.
“Yeah… about that… there is something we need to tell you before you make a decision for this summer” Harry started, getting the attention of the two men away from the papers.
Ron and Ginny were easily influenced by their mother’s view of the world. Especially Ron, he was jealous and judgmental, he was used to judge people, and Slytherins in particular, depending on the colour of their tie. What would he do if he found out that his best friend was gay? It would be for sure a repeat of what happened in fourth year. Harry knew this was not how friendships worked, but Ron and the Weasleys were the only ‘family’ he had other than Sirius.
on your hair all through Hogwarts?” he asked as the full meaning of what Harry had just said sunk in. Harry shrugged, and Draco shook his head. “That explains so much,” he muttered. Harry elbowed him in retaliation, and the somber mood that had threatened to descend was dispelled before it could properly take hold. They teased and poked at each other as they brushed their teeth, and, eventually, made their way back to Harry’s bed, where Draco spooned up behind Harry and quickly fell asleep.
“Well, I was due to start the year after the Triwizard Tournament. I know a lot of people didn’t believe you right off, when… well, you know.”
Sadiyah quirked him a sad half smile. “Well, we were all around when the elves went to collect his things, and the crew are terrible gossips. Usually it’s a bit fun, but…”
“This is bizarre,” he told Draco, who was seated to his left on one of the long, cushy benches along the side of the boat.
that Harry had feelings for him as well—the things he said sometimes and the looks Draco occasionally caught on his face indicated that he did—but it was a lot to gamble on. What if he stayed, and Harry ended things, and it really
half an hour ago. Merlin. I meant that you don’t see it when people…” He closed his eyes, looking pained. “The crew don’t talk about
ed another chair from across the room for herself. “Yes, not bad at all, Potter. Your posture could use some work, and you could enunciate more, but overall I think we’ll be able to put together a good episode.”
“Sorry, Blaise, but I think I’m going to keep my thoughts to myself for now.” Harry grinned cheekily.
She leaned against the table, stretching her long legs out in front of her and smiling wryly. “Teaching. Young ballerinas might look delicate, but they can cause complete chaos without proper guidance. I’ve perfected my ‘pay attention, class’ voice.”
Something lurched in his stomach. For some reason, it had never occurred to him that Teddy would care that he was leaving.
“You had two different Muggleborn stepfathers, though,” Draco pointed out. “That does provide you with a bit more literacy in non-wizarding
“Oh, don’t worry, nothing will hurt me,” she reassured him with a smile before veering off the path and into the trees.
“Yes, well, I really am becoming quite famous, you know. I’m sure my name could help quite a bit in all that charity work you spend so much time on. And, of course,” he added as what sounded like an afterthought, “having you associated with my brand wouldn’t hurt my own business, either.”
“I could get used to freshly baked soufflé in bed,” Draco decided after letting another delectable bite dissolve on his tongue.
Gonna be super honest: I write these a few days in advance and normally I reread them one last time for errors before posting, but I slept literally one hour last night and am so tired I might be sick, and I didn't want to miss a day, so it is what it is.
“I assume your little stunt was spoiled, then?” he asked cooly. Lucius glared at Draco’s tone, but before he could say anything, they were all distracted by a commotion in the hall.
As though summoned by Harry’s despondency, there was a knock at the door. “Harry?” came Draco’s voice.
The trail was wide enough to walk two or three abreast and was comprised of packed dirt and flat rocks that were used as sort of makeshift steps along the way. Fir and spruce grew in abundance on both sides, interspersed with graceful birch trees, all towering above them and shading the path, letting through beams of golden sun that glinted off the drifting pollen before patterning the ground ahead of them. The forest floor was carpeted in moss and scattered with seedlings and fallen branches. The air was cool and damp, and the spicy pine smell that Harry had noticed around their cabin was more intense, almost sharp as he breathed it in.
Shaking his head, Harry lugged his own bag into his room, dropping it heavily onto the floor and looking around appreciatively. The room itself was simple, most of the space taken up by a massive king-sized bed (which Harry grudgingly had to admit
Some time later, Draco flopped onto his back with an exhausted groan. “Fucking hell, my whole body is shaking.” He looked over at Harry and stretched his arms with a wince. “Kayaking was a terrible choice. Next time, you’re doing all the work.”
“We—” Narcissa started, and Draco saw a very familiar glint in her eye that he knew did not bode well for him, “—are planning a party.”
Harry was tempted to go check on Draco, but he managed to push down the urge. Malfoy was an adult; he could take care of himself. He probably didn’t want Harry hovering or babying him over something as commonplace as motion sickness. With effort, he managed to turn away from the house.
Draco retrieved the glasses and spelled the bottle open, pouring them each a glass. “I’ll let it pass this time. But only because I’m getting soufflé out of it.”
Because that was the thing, when it came down to it. He’d been harsh, but he hadn’t been lying; he and Max had been
Draco’s Sunday lasted at least three days, he was sure. He was wired from the night before, unable to stop thinking about their kiss and wondering when he might hear from Harry about their dinner. He wanked three times before noon, eventually giving up and Flooing Pansy to invite her out for a mimosa-drenched brunch. The alcohol and the company helped take the edge off for a while, but he still went to bed feeling jittery in a way he hadn’t in more years than he could remember.
“And then your career would never get back on track,” Draco said sagely, his eyes falling closed. “I don’t believe they allow the dead in the professional league.” His hands reached the bottom of Harry’s shirt and slid beneath the hem, seeking skin.
There was a miniature wooden world in the window. A model train traveled around tiny tracks. There were buildings up and down a little street, with doors and windows swinging open and closed, people peeking out. Tiny, intricately detailed people were hanging baubles on an equally-small Christmas tree in a town square. It reminded Draco of the clockwork models he’d seen in Muggle displays, but everything moved more smoothly, the magic flowing through it giving it life. As Draco took in the details, he realized, with a start, that the street was a model of Diagon Alley itself.
Harry laughed. “Glad to be of service.” His face turned sheepish. “I wanted to apologize for yesterday, and say thank you for getting me to bed. I didn’t mean to be such an awful date.”
Blaise smirked and looked down at him, obviously relishing the moment. “He isn’t interested in fashion, I’m not interested in quidditch, and neither of us are interested in bottoming.”
