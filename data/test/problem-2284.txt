Harry cleared his throat. “I was hoping. I was hoping we could talk. If you have a minute. And if. If you’ll speak to me.” He looked nervous.
When Harry hadn’t come back by midnight, he firecalled Ron and Hermione. Hermione answered, hair pulled back, in sweats and ready for bed. Draco was frantic. He knew something was wrong. Harry wouldn’t just leave. Hermione called for Ron, waved Draco through. Ron caught him when he stumbled into their living room.
He met Dai at the opening reception. In a wizarding hotel right on the beach, with tiled floors, sapphire and bone. He was interested in the American with his California accent, his long hair tied back in a ponytail. Dai was casual in shorts and a ratty t-shirt, clavicle exposed, inky black flowers trailing up his neck.
Draco shut his mouth and slumped over. Pansy was right, and he knew it. He just didn’t know how to get out of his habits, his rituals. Part of him didn’t want to let them go. It meant letting Harry go. It meant moving on from the pain, the dull ache in his chest. It was a wound that never fully scabbed over; he kept picking at it. Moving on meant Draco had to forgive.
Draco opened his mouth to thank him, but instead, he found himself saying, “You know, you wounded me terribly on the Hogwarts Express our first year. I wanted to be your friend. But you rejected me in favor of Weasley.” He smiled, a little sadly. “I suppose it was better for everyone that you did, knowing what a little bastard I was back then, and how I’d do almost anything to please my father. You were right to stay far away.” He paused, twirled his biro. “Especially after what he did to Weasley’s sister second year. I’m not sure he knew that Riddle’s diary would try to murder a little girl, but Lucius was always good at feigning ignorance.” Draco tried for a small smile, but it felt more like a grimace.
He lifted his head and looked at his therapist. Dr. Ducharme was terribly chic for a mind healer, tall and willowy; blond hair pulled back into a chignon at her neck, black layered skirts draped over legs elegantly crossed. A notebook and biro held loosely in her hands.
"Are you good?," Draco asked quietly, running his hands up Harry's back, sending shivers down his spine.
Harry hadn’t realized he needed to touch someone so much. Draco never seemed to mind, leaned into him, traced his jaw, Harry’s eyebrows, his lips. Begged for more when Harry touched him back. Just one word from Draco, a soft
Harry did smile now. Draco always acted like these assessments were going to take forever, like he was putting the department behind by taking two or three weeks to identify a potion they hadn't been able to for months, sometimes years. Draco had no idea how slow bureaucracy moved. Harry found it charming.
Harry looked down at the network of white scars that marked Draco's torso. Traced a few of the silvery lines with his fingertips, paused when Draco inhaled, looked back up at him, his heart in his throat.
Harry smiled and looked down at Draco, pale head resting on Harry's shoulder; arm flung across his chest. He squeezed Draco a little tighter, kissed the top of his head. He liked how Draco slept, loose-limbed and relaxed, worry lines smoothed on his forehead. He looked so young when he was asleep.
He walked into the living room, and his breath hitched.  Draco was at the liquor cabinet, his movements graceful and efficient as he pulled out glasses, conjured ice. He was wearing a black cashmere jumper and finely pressed grey trousers, and, as always, cheeky socks; today’s were purple with green dragons circling his ankles, puffing smoke. Harry couldn’t help but stare at Draco’s sharp profile, black glasses perched on his Aquiline nose, his full lips. He felt undone.
He had known he hurt Draco. Hearing about it stung, though. And he didn’t like the idea of someone else having Draco. His Draco. God, he was still so beautiful. But Harry could breathe around him. Didn’t feel like he was drowning, pulled into the raging blue. Took it as a good sign.
“Yes, well. Seeing as how we are…not colleagues, exactly, but that we both work in the same area, I thought it would be best if I apologized to you in person.” He paused and thought,
“It’s here, Harry!” Draco was staring at the set in front of him, on the mantlepiece. Where he assumed Harry had put it, hoping to avoid the exact situation they were in right now.
Harry nodded. Bit his lip. "I promise I won't make this a thing. But. Can I… can I look?," Harry asked softly.
It was a history of them, a history of Harry’s family. It was Sirius, Remus, his parents. It was Ron and Hermione, Rose. It was Andromeda and Teddy. Hedwig.
He pushed the door open, and the bell chimed. Draco came out of the backroom, quickly. In a navy pinstripe suit today, with a pale blue shirt. His waistcoat was unbuttoned; there were dark circles under his swollen eyes. So he’d been crying quite a lot then. Harry felt his heart clench. He wanted to take Draco’s pain away. Knew he couldn’t.
Harry took a deep breath and touched his hand to the door, silently hoping that the locking charms still recognized him. He felt the door click, and he smiled softly.
Draco felt a hand on his shoulder, winced, physically jerked. He stood up quickly, Harry’s hand fell from his shoulder. Draco pulled his glasses back down and walked away from Harry, to the other side of the room, his back to him.
“Stop it. I know what you’re going to say. The very best Aurors, in both Britain and abroad, looked for him for months. For
"I chose Sirius. Even though I never got to live with him, I would have. I wanted to live with him and Remus. And I chose Ron and Hermione. But I suppose I chose them because I chose Gryffindor."
Harry apparated them into his bedroom at Grimmauld Place, lips still on Draco's, arms wrapped around him. Jesus Christ, he had no idea that kissing someone could be like this, could consume him so thoroughly. Harry needed all of Draco, needed him right now. He pulled back, smiled at Draco again, took in his messy blond hair, his flushed cheeks, his plump lips wet and parted. Stared into his gray eyes, noticed the blue in there, the flecks of gold. Lifted Draco's hand to his mouth again and kissed it, rubbed his thumb along Draco's long fingers, strong and sure from years of preparing potions ingredients, taking notes, twirling biros.
Draco tore his eyes away from the line of Dai’s throat. “Bugger, you distracted me. Go over there right now,” he pointed across the table as he stood up. He only had fifteen seconds before he needed to add the daisy root essence. He concentrated on stirring and, when the timer chimed, he added it. The potion turned bright yellow, precisely what he hoped would happen. He turned the heat down and watched it bubble softly. Draco looked at his notes, marked down the steps, the reaction. Reset the tempus for another hour and cast a protective shield over the cauldron.
“How can you tell that something’s wrong?,” Draco asked, setting his chin on Dai’s shoulder. “I’m behind you.”
"How do you do that? How do you let it go?," he asked. Draco knew he had trouble forgiving himself. He didn’t even know how to try.
"Just lamenting the fact that I've gone my whole life without drenching my chips in vinegar. All of those wasted chips. A tragedy," Draco smiled back.
Teddy smiled at him again, polished off the beer. Harry put his arm around his godson. They surveyed the garden, the party still in full swing.
Draco rolled his eyes, “I couldn’t possibly know why.” He turned on his heels, and Harry followed him into the back room. Contempt was good. He could deal with a little contempt.
“Yeah, you bloody well did, but I reckon we all were just teenagers who didn’t know our arse from a tea kettle either. Fuck. I hated you so much.” He rubbed his hands over his face. “Now it seems so pointless.” He paused. “Hermione had me read the letter you sent her, you know.”
“Now, on a personal matter, I believe I’m, well. I’m years overdue on an apology for every stupid and dangerous thing I did to you and yours whilst at Hogwarts. Beginning with apologizing for the relatively tame—in comparison to what I did later—bullying and goading in our first few years. And then later for...For taking up with my father’s ideals, for taking the Mark. For allowing Death Eaters into Hogwarts, for hurting Ron, and Katie Bell, and Ron’s brother. For fighting on the wrong side. For,” he stumbled here. He always stumbled here. “For Dumbledore. For chasing you into the Room of Requirement and for…for Vince setting that awful fire. Thank you for saving us. I’m not sure I ever managed to do that, either. Say thank you.
"Do you ever think about what it would have been like? If we had been friends the whole time?," Harry asked quietly, still tracing Draco's hip. "I think about it sometimes."
Draco put his hand over Harry's, lifted it, and kissed his knuckles. Harry’s breath caught. Draco made eye contact as he kissed each of Harry's fingers, touched his lips to the dips in between, turned his hand over, kissed his palm. Harry could hardly breathe when Draco lifted his hand to his face, pressed Harry's palm to his cheek.
Draco looked up from his glass of wine into Pansy’s concerned brown eyes. He knew he worried her. He worried everyone. He worried himself. He knew that holding onto Harry this hard, the routines that had become rigid and unfixed, his little rituals, were unhealthy. He knew it. He didn’t know how to stop.
Draco didn’t want to leave him. It had only been a week, but he knew. Dai was someone worth holding on to. Draco knew how precious time was, now. Knew how important it was to tell people how you felt about them. He didn’t think about it.
After that first visit, Harry got the spooks to stop using the house elves as potions testers. He'd told Hermione about it, and she'd gone ballistic. It had taken two weeks.
"Good." He paused. "Now, can you start calling me Auror Potter again? I like it when you call me that." Harry's eyes twinkled.
“Wait, I want in on this,” Ron joined them, wrapped his arms around the three of them as best he could. They broke apart, smiling. Hermione and Harry’s eyes were bright, like they both were on the verge of tears.
Dai pushed himself up on his forearms, leaned over, and kissed Draco slowly, with intent. Draco inhaled as Dai pulled back; he smelled like lime and basil, rain and grass. Like spring, Draco thought. Dai had told him that his name meant "shining treasure" in Japanese, which suited him. He was Draco’s bit of gold, of light.
The bell over the shop door chimed. Draco put a statis spell over the batch of a calming draught he was developing, took off his dragonhide gloves and apron, and removed his goggles. He slipped his waistcoat back on over his shirt, buttoning it as he made his way to the front of the shop. He looked up. Drew up short.
Draco flopped back on the bed; the duvet pushed down below his hips. Harry was getting distracted. "I cannot believe you chose your house."
The owl dropped off the scroll, took the mouse treat Harry offered and left. It was addressed to Harry, but he didn’t recognize the seal. He hoped it wasn’t a piece of errant fan mail that had gotten through his system.
Harry stared at the ceiling in the bedroom, arms behind his head, eyes tracing the marks that they’d left; an enthusiastic
Draco walked behind the table, put it between them. Picked up a biro and started to twirl it in his hand. Saw Harry smile at the familiar habit. Made himself stop. Forced himself to make eye contact with Harry, with those familiar green eyes, the ones he’d looked into so often. He felt his heart clench.
Harry took the handkerchief, wiped his eyes under his glasses, nodded. It was good news. But Harry felt so off-balance, so unmoored. He barely knew why he was crying. His stomach roiled as his eyes leaked.
at the table, reducing it to splinters. Blind with fury, he made his way through the ground floor, slashed lines across the walls with his wand, ripped art off the walls, smashed picture frames. He stormed upstairs to their room, shredded the bed, the pillows, the curtains.
Forgiving Harry was easy. Breaking up with Dai was hard. More difficult than when he’d left for California. Almost as hard as when Harry had left.
Harry stared up at the cracked ceiling in his bedroom, traced the lines in the plaster with his eyes, one arm folded under his head, cigarette in his free hand. Took a long drag, blew it out, watched the blue-grey smoke dissipate in the early golden light; sunlight slanting through the shutters, Vespas humming, voices drifting up.
“Yes, ah, you see, Draco. Your father wanted you to befriend Harry when you were a child. You did not manage that because, at the time, Harry did not wish to be friends. Then you, as you say, antagonized him through your young teen years. Then, at sixteen, you joined this fascist organization, officially, yes?” She paused, and Draco nodded. “Yes, OK. And you stopped antagonizing Harry after this?”
Harry lurked around Asclepius. He brought Draco coffees and hovered, asked questions, getting underfoot, the same way he had years before. When they’d become friends. Draco tried to keep him away at first. But Harry just kept coming round.
“And don’t get me wrong. I missed you, after you left. And then after you sent that Patronus, I hated you. But it got me to a mind healer, finally. And she helped me see that we were both just kids making the best choices we knew how to at the time. And I learned to have compassion for teenage Draco, even though he was an arsehole. And to see that he was scared and alone, and that he did the best he could. I started to forgive him.” Draco paused, sighed.
Harry studied him for a few moments. Finally, he nodded. “OK, Draco, I’ll leave. But I’ll be back tomorrow. I need you...I need to explain to you.”
“I just realized that you’ve been responsible for feeding me lately. I’m sorry, that isn’t your job. I’ll be better about it,” Draco mumbled.
The bell over the shop door chimed. He had a customer. He sighed and stood up, checked his appearance in the mirror above the fireplace. He was red-faced, blotchy, his eyes shiny. He cast a cosmetic charm. It helped some of the redness, but he still looked like he’d been through something. He supposed it would have to do. He pulled his glasses down, set them back on his nose. Smoothed his hair, walked to the front of the shop, and fixed the buttons on his waistcoat. It was black today to match his mood. He was finishing the top button as he walked into the front of the shop. Took a breath, put a smile on his face, and looked up.
me if I wasn’t doing a good enough job at torture for him. He always let me know that he’d hurt my mother if I didn’t do what he said,” Draco finished, sighed.
He looked back at his painting, the long limbs;  twisted, abstract. But you could still see the grey eyes, pale hair—the scars. The composition was different, but it was still him.
Draco latched on to one part. “A successful relationship? You do realize that my boyfriend, the most famous wizard of all time, did choose to leave me by going out for takeaway curry and never coming home again, right?”
“Want to see something?,” Harry asked. He hadn’t told anyone what he had planned for later tonight, after he and Draco were home again. He wanted to let someone in on his plans, and he couldn’t think of anyone better to confide in than his godson.
“OK, OK, old man. Let me up.” Draco struggled to move the toddler off him and sit up so he could get his wand out of his back pocket. He aimed it at Hugo, said “Levicorpus.” The boy rose steadily in the air, his hands out in front of him, pretending to be the Muggle superhero. Draco stood up and floated Hugo out of the bedroom, down the stairs, back to the party. It was Rose’s eighth birthday, superhero-themed. Harry had introduced them to the Muggle movies.
Dai leaned into him, sighed. “Dinner. Well, for you, it’s probably lunch and dinner. I know how you get when you’re working on something,” he smiled.
“So you began dating at twenty-five, then? And you were together for three years, until you were twenty-eight, is that correct?”
“Yes. Well. Thank you. I will. I will consider that. I’ll leave you to your business now, and I’ll be on my way. I…I hope to say hello should we pass each other on the street going forward. Since we occupy the same—”
Draco sighed. “Well, he and his friends were captured at one point, and were brought to my house. Everyone knew that Harry, Ron, and Hermione were on the run together and, by sheer luck, the death eaters captured them. But Harry was disfigured when they brought him in; his face was swollen, almost unrecognizable. Hermione had hexed him, to try to alter his appearance to protect him. So my aunt wanted me to identify that it was him, that we’d captured Harry Potter, before she called lord fuckface.” He pushed his glasses up, pressed his fingers to his eyes.
Somewhere, underneath how much Harry loved Draco, how much he wanted him, he felt unsettled, like embers burning, a fire in his bones. He looked back at the ceiling.
“And, as you can see, I’m fully recovered from that poisoned wine or whatever the fuck it was, although the real person responsible for saving my sorry arse that day was Harry. One of about fifty times he’s done so. So. Yeah. OK. Thank you for acknowledging…harm done. I reckon you did quite a bit of that.” He let out another breath. “Didn’t seem like your heart was in it at the end, though, yeah?” Ron raised an eyebrow.
Draco just stared at him. He was sorry? That’s it? He pushed his glasses up on his head, pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Good one, Uncle Harry!,” Teddy yelled when Harry made a triple play, exploding several cards at once. Harry may or may not have boosted the explosion with a wordless firecracker charm.
He thought about Sirius. About how he’d told Harry he was going to ask Remus to marry him, the year they lived together at Grimmauld with the Order. He’d sent Harry a letter, excited and nervous, ink blotchy.
Draco sat up, too, faced him. Put a hand to Dai’s cheek and traced his jawline. “I mean it. Come home with me. I want…I want you. I haven’t wanted anything for a long time. And this week has been brilliant. You’re brilliant. And I want to see what this—us—could look like, for real. And I don’t want to be coy, or act like I don’t have feelings for you. I’ve learned that nothing’s guaranteed. So I want to be honest with the people in my life. And I want to get to know you. Not from a distance, together.”
“Draco, I. God, I’m so sorry. And I don’t expect you to forgive me. An apology is an acknowledgment of harm, right? And I can’t. I can’t begin to fathom the harm I’ve caused you. And Ron and Hermione, Rose. Andy and Teddy. Everyone. And I know I have so much work to do. To even try to make it up to any of you. But. I need you, I need you most of all, to know. To know why I left. As best as I can explain it.” He bounced his leg, bit his lip.
Harry had fallen for Draco, so hard and so fast, he hadn’t ever stopped to think about it. He had seen someone trying to better himself, had seen this person he hated so much, who had done so much damage, take Harry’s advice, and honestly try to live by it every day. Draco was a walking embodiment of all the things Harry had hoped for after the war: a new start, a way forward, a life full of choices. But, for Harry, Draco had also felt inevitable. Like their mirrored histories were, in fact, two halves of the same coin. Like Harry hadn’t had a choice at all. And Draco was going to ask a question he’d have to answer.
They fell back in the hotel bed, wrapped themselves up in each other, whispered hopes, and made plans. Moved together until they came undone, a promise of something new instead of a good-bye.
“I do. I don’t care. Come home with me. You can work with me at Asclepius. You can research Western European herb and plant variations. I’ll take you everywhere; Scotland, Ireland, France. We can go wherever you want. Come home and work with me.” Draco knew it was too fast, too much. He didn’t care.
Draco sighed deeply. “He was famous. He had defeated the Dark Lord as a baby, and everyone knew he would be in my year at Hogwarts. Lucius—my father—wanted me to try to befriend him. Thought that it would be good for the family to have an in with ‘The Boy Who Lived,’” he mimed air quotes. “So I tried to make friends with him on the train to school and, inevitably, fucked it up by making fun of his friend—who, ironically, also became my friend after Harry and I started dating—and he refused to shake my hand. Was a bit of a shit about it, too, frankly, but I rather respect him for it now. He made the right call.”
Dr. Ducharme pursed her lips. “Hmmm, yes. Well, then, you were given a terrible and impossible task, so you didn’t focus on Harry anymore. It was after this that you both saved each other?”
Florence was a city of delights. Harry was happy. He pushed aside thoughts of silver skies and mist, grey eyes, a pale torso—a dim bed, a pale throat that smelled of lemon and thyme, clove and mint. Ottavia smelled like charcoal and tobacco, roses and smoke. She was dark and comfortable, and Harry could lose himself in her hair, her soft body, the way she gasped “non fermarti,”
Draco smiled, and Harry’s heart skipped another beat. Would he ever get used to it? “You don’t have to. We could get it delivered.”
Dr. Ducharme continued. “When it came down to it, you couldn’t knowingly hurt someone without being directly threatened. You didn’t kill your headmaster. You didn’t turn over Harry, and you didn’t let your friends try to hurt or kill Harry either. Our work here is for you to learn how to accept that you did your best, to stop torturing yourself, and to forgive yourself, oui?”
Harry smiled and looked down at the figure sprawled next to him. Soft limbs tangled in white sheets, hair the color of mahogany fanned out across the pillow, halfway down her back, one sleepy dark eye looking up at him.
He hadn’t expected the mere start of a lecture before Draco practically begged him to leave, on the verge of tears. He looked like he had been crying when he first came out of the backroom. And what had he said? He’d already had his heart broken once today? Harry felt his stomach clench again, jealousy rising like bile. Did Draco have a boyfriend? A...no. He couldn’t let himself go there.
It was late afternoon, still early in the season, a little bit too cold for many people to be out. Harry had insisted they get fish and chips, since Draco had never had them, either. Harry drowned his in malt vinegar and urged Draco to do the same. Draco was horrified, but Harry persisted and, well. Harry was right. Malt vinegar was a revelation. Draco’s mouth was numb from the salt and vinegar; his cheeks were numb from the ocean wind. But Draco was warm, holding hands with Harry.
“Well. My friend, he wanted to kill Harry, but I said we couldn’t because Voldemort wanted him alive. But I didn’t know if that was true; I just said it. I didn’t want anyone else—Harry—to get hurt. I just wanted my wand back. And then my friend—he was my friend, his name was Vince. He unleashed a deadly fire, and my other friend, Greg, passed out. The fire was eating everything in its path; we were going to die. And then Harry saved me. On a broom, he flew me out of the room, away from the fire. And Ron and Hermione saved my other friend, Greg. I never did get my wand back, that day.” Draco rubbed his hands over his thighs, trying not to fidget. This was hard.
"You could have portkeyed me to a graveyard and used my blood to help you regenerate yourself into human form. That was probably the worst way to get my attention," Harry joked.
He supposed yesterday could have gone worse. But Draco hadn’t seemed like himself. Not that Harry knew who Draco was anymore. But he’d barely had any fight in him. Harry had been prepared for a strop. Yelling. Throwing hexes, even.
He went back to his flat in Shadwell. He liked being there; it's muggle roots. He painted every room a different shade of blue. Charmed the walls and the ceilings with clouds; birds and stars. He wanted to feel like he was in the sky.
Watched the pile of socks ignite, spreading to the rug. The flames leaped up as Draco concentrated on holding the spell. He was sweating now, his face orange and red, but he didn't stop. He didn’t stop until the ring melted, until it was just a hunk of molten silver.
“Hermione. Please.” Draco’s eyes filled, and his throat closed. He put his hand over hers, willing her to look at him. He couldn’t say anything else without breaking down. She finally met his gaze. Her eyes were wet, and she took a deep breath. She lifted her mug to take a sip of tea, pulling her hands from his.
as in these potions previously did not exist—since you've been here. You’ve also improved the side effects of current healing potions, where other people couldn’t. I also learned that you share your work with international potioneers, for free, so they can use your recipes and adapt them based on the materials and ingredients native to their region. I want your help. Not Iraklidis’.”
Harry hopped up and wrapped his arms around both of them, trapping Teddy between him and Draco. Whispered in Draco’s ear, “It went OK, then?”
“Draco,” the stern tone was edging back into Pansy’s voice. “I know you thought that Harry loving you was some sort of path to redemption. That if Harry could forgive you, it meant that you wouldn’t have to do it yourself. You need to forgive yourself. For you. He couldn’t save you. And he can’t destroy you. You are better than this, Draco. You are a fucking dragon. Get your shit together.”
Draco sat up and put a hand on Harry's chest to still him. "See, you great bloody twit, this is exactly what I didn't want to happen. Having a meltdown about scars that are almost a decade old isn't sexy, Potter. Pull yourself together," he said softly, his tone gentle.
Wrung out and helpless, he shuffled back downstairs to the fireplace. Flooed to Pansy’s. She ran out of the bedroom, in a t-shirt and knickers. Draco promptly burst into angry, awful tears and fell into her arms.
Draco looked over at the sleeping form next to him, straight black hair and smooth skin. Studied the planes of his face, dark eyebrows over closed eyes, framed by long black lashes. Sharp cheekbones, pointed chin. Draco reached out to brush some of the silky hair off his forehead, and was greeted with a sleepy smile as black eyes opened slowly.
“Si, Harry. The person you see when you draw your portraits. When you paint. In your heart, it is only one person, this nessuno, you tell me. He is not nessuno. He is someone in your heart. If he is in your heart, how can I be there too?”
Harry walked up to his room slowly. He cast a wandless tempus and saw that it was after eight here, which meant it was after seven back home. He should have been back a half-hour ago. He didn’t want Draco to worry. Harry considered sending a Patronus, letting Draco he was OK; he’d be back soon. But he couldn’t. He was still on fire, deep in his bones. He went into his room and laid down heavily on the bed. Tried to think about what, exactly, it was that he was doing here. Here, as in Florence.
Slowly, Draco found himself looking forward to his visits, his coffees, his questions. The same as he had, before.
Potter walked over to the counter and pulled a vial out of his ridiculously attractive coat. A shiny liquid swirled inside.
"Harry," Draco whispered. "Harry, can I?," he tugged at the collar of Harry's leather jacket, the one that had been Sirius's. Harry nodded, and Draco slipped it off his shoulders. Harry reached out and gently pulled at Draco's tan trench coat, letting it fall to the floor. Smiled as he pulled off his own black t-shirt, tossed it to the side. Harry walked Draco back to the bed until his thighs bumped up against it. He cupped Draco's face in his hands again, brought him in for another slow, deep kiss, hissed when Draco traced lines across his back, down his sides, slipped his hands into his waistband again. Everywhere Draco touched lit on fire. Harry was so incredibly, thoroughly turned on. How had he spent so many years without Draco's hands on his body, without his mouth on Harry's? Harry shivered at the thought of more contact, more skin, more. He kissed down Draco's neck, licked across his pulse, down his Adam's apple. Draco tasted sharp, like grey salt, and warm, like honey.
Draco snorted. “No. He had a huge fucking snake that followed him everywhere, and he’d feed people to her. I told you he was fucking dramatic.”
Dai was gorgeous. He was thoughtful, careful with his words, a good listener. He was also an exceedingly talented potioneer. They were complementary; Dai was at the forefront of growing new hybrid ingredients, using Muggle cross-pollination methods to evolve plants' effectiveness in potions, while Draco’s brewing methods were cutting-edge. They exchanged notes after sessions while sipping vodkas with lemon soda at the hotel bar. Draco hadn’t realized what it could be like, to connect with who someone shared your life's work, your passion.
Dai pulled out of Draco’s arms, turned to face him. Took Draco’s face in his hands and kissed him, slowly, sweetly. “I know how you are. I know how hard you work. It makes me happy to feed you,” he pushed Draco’s hair off his forehead. Kissed him again.
“I know, Draco. I’m sorry I left. I didn’t know what else to do. Being here, without your father, it was too much. It was too hard.” She looked down at the table, wrung her hands a bit.
"Merlin, could you imagine what Lucius would have done? I'm not sure who he would have gone after first—me, the hat, or Dumbledore," Draco laughed. The duvet slipped down even farther. Harry stared at his sharp hip bone, smooth and pale. Felt himself getting aroused.
“Nine years of space, Narcissa?,” Harry spat from across the room. He pushed off from the counter and stalked over. “You lied to Voldemort just to find out if Draco was still alive. You risked your life for him, and you saved me so I could finally kill that noseless fuck. Why the hell would you do all of that just to leave him?” Harry stood next to Draco, looming over both of them, seething.
Draco raised an eyebrow, feigned innocence. “Really? I guess I’m just working through a potions problem.” The lie slipped out.
“Not because I didn’t want to marry you. I did. Too much, I think. You just. I don’t think you ever knew what you did to me, physically, I mean. And not just in bed,” he attempted a cheeky smile, but Draco was still frowning, so he kept going, “but all the time. I felt. I felt like I could never catch my breath around you. Like I was always on the edge of something, a precipice. Always in danger of falling. Not in love with you. I was always in love with you. Loving you was easy. But I don’t think I knew how to be myself.”
Draco missed Angelos, missed having someone to talk to about his work. Since Angelos had retired, he worked alone. No one stopped by Asclepius anymore, dropping off confiscated potions, pestering him with questions. After—after everything, Draco stopped consulting for the DMLE. He couldn't. He didn't want to.
So he didn't. He moved down the length of Draco; slowly, he took his time. Kissed every one of the scars he'd put there. Worshipped them. Worshipped Draco. Took his wrist and kissed the mark on his forearm, too, for good measure. Made his way back up to Draco’s mouth, kissed the crook of his elbow, his shoulder, his neck. He looked down into Draco's stormy eyes, like the Atlantic in the winter.
fuck, Andromeda?,” Harry asked again. Draco appreciated Harry’s commitment to thoroughly antagonizing his aunt, who, it seemed, had invited Narcissa here to torture Draco.
Draco pursed his lips. “Yes, well. I was told to leave all wards open to you, in case you showed up hurt or dead. And then, by the time you sent your stupid stag, I’d forgotten about them.”
“I’d like to apologize to you, Weas- ah, Ron. If I may call you Ron...” Draco hesitated, but Weasley’s eyes just narrowed further, so he plowed on. “I understand that my actions toward you in school were abhorrent, and I want to apologize for goading you, and making fun of your family, and for generally being a little prick. Until the time I went from prick to full cult initiate, when I escalated my behavior from terrible to dangerous. I’d also like to apologize for you getting hurt during my rather pathetic attempt to, ah,” he stumbled a bit. “Dumbledore. And for letting Death Eaters into Hogwarts, and for my part in your brother getting hurt that night.
She studied him. Stood up and put her coffee on the stool. Walked over to him, invaded his space, pressed her hands to his chest, looked up at him.
“Pleasant bloke, eh,” Potter said darkly, eyes narrowed as he followed the attorney’s retreating form.
Harry took the wine glass out of Ottavia’s hand and led her to his bed. He could answer any questions she asked him there. He couldn’t answer anything else.
“I knew it was him. But I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t hand him over. I had seen enough. So I just said I couldn’t be sure. I didn’t say no; it wasn’t him. I didn't try to protect him or his friends, really. My aunt tortured Hermione shortly after I said I didn’t know if Harry was, well, Harry. I couldn’t protect her. And I couldn’t protect the people—other students, an old man, a goblin. The people he held in our basement. Locked up. I couldn’t help anyone.” Draco paused, took another deep breath, ran his hands over his face.
Draco felt his stomach rumble. Dai was right; he had completely let the time get away from him. He hadn’t eaten anything since the toast he’d had for breakfast. That Dai had made him. He’d also brought him food yesterday. Was Dai currently responsible for feeding Draco? He frowned.
Draco smiled and pulled Harry closer. The duvet slipped, leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination anymore.
“Teddy is Harry’s godson, Narcissa. And we’re in a relationship. And, before this stunt, Andy was my aunt who I used to like spending time with.” Draco shot Andromeda a look across the kitchen, and she gave him a small shrug. Harry glowered behind her, arms crossed, in full fuck-you-I’m-Harry-Potter mode. It felt like the wrong moment for Draco to observe that a pissed-off Harry was an incredibly hot Harry. He turned back to his mother.
"May I?," Harry asked as he reached up and tapped Draco's glasses. He nodded, and Harry gently removed the black frames, folded the arms. Took Draco's hand and tugged him toward the bed. Harry set Draco's glasses down on his nightstand, placed his own wire-frame pair next to them. He liked how their glasses looked next to each other. It looked domestic, like a tableau of comfort, of home. Of partnership, maybe love. Of family. It was too much to think about.
“What was the point of you saving Harry, and of him saving you, if you refuse to forgive yourself? You’ve been a productive member of society; you had a very successful relationship. You can’t live a fulfilling life while still punishing yourself.”
“He shouldn’t have shown you the bloody thing, let alone told you it was charmed. I cannot believe the unprofessionalism…,” Draco was still grumbling.
She was smaller than he remembered, her pale hair pulled back in a braid, her high cheekbones stood out. She fixed her blue eyes on him.
“Yes,” Harry breathed. “Yes. I’m staying. But I haven’t seen anyone else. I needed to see you first.”
"So, Draco, if I understand this correctly, you and your partner had been on opposite sides in the war. You were on the wrong side. And he was destined to defeat evil, to win the war, and save everyone. Before that, though, you had both hated each other in school and antagonized one another—"
His eyes wandered over the imperfections in plaster, the places where the midnight paint had dripped, where the charmed stars sparkled, periwinkle and platinum. He liked this ceiling. It wasn't perfect, but it wasn’t marked with magic gone awry, with a history of—nevermind.
Harry laughed. “Yeah, she can.” He passed Teddy his beer bottle. “Here. Don’t let your grandmother or your aunt see.”
Harry took a deep breath and nodded. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you. I’m...I’m happy you have someone.” He hoped it sounded sincere.
"Hey, Malfoy," Harry said, softening his voice a bit. "It's OK if you're not interested. I like being around you, working with you. Well, watching you work. And I wondered if maybe I'd like being around you, I don't know. All the time." He shrugged.
"I can't possibly be the first person who's asked you out on a date, Malfoy. Tell me you understand what a date is." Draco looked like he was about to jump out of his navy three-piece suit. Harry was enjoying this.
Pansy pulled Draco’s hand from his wine glass and held it in her soft, small one. “Darling. Look at me.” Her voice was softer now. Draco looked up. “I know how much you loved him. And I know that him leaving, with no word, worrying you like he did, I know that’s devastating. I know. But I also know that you can’t keep living like this. In his house. With all his things. He’s gone, and you’re still stuck here, in your old relationship but alone. You need to mourn him, to get angry, to hate him. You need to move on.”
Art had been a refuge. Harry didn’t think he was particularly good at it, but he liked the mess you had to make when creating something. How you had to keep working at it, how you had to make things that were terrible to be able to make something beautiful. How you could change your mind halfway through; start over, make something new. How you could feel something, deep inside you, and make other people see it too.
“Draco, I’m your mother, and I’d appreciate it if you’d address me as such. I don’t want anything other than to see you. It’s been too long.”
“Oh dear,” Knowlton said, and he conjured a handkerchief, white and smooth, without a wand. “I’m so sorry you found out this way. It is good news, though, is it not?”
"Might I inquire as to why, exactly, you'd like to go on a date? With me?" Harry was pretty sure Draco had been aiming for sounding dignified, but it came off almost shy.
and stopped Harry from harping on it, practically in the same breath. How he’d agreed with Harry; the Department of Mysteries was unethical in its treatment of house elves.
) or a new sighting, somewhere on the continent. Black hair. A scar. It never amounted to anything. It was only ghosts.
“Draco!,” Teddy jumped up and ran into his arms. Draco engulfed him in a big hug and ruffled Teddy’s blue hair, which was rapidly changing to platinum, to match Draco. Harry’s heart caught, every time he saw his godson and boyfriend together. They were two peas in a pod.
He felt the air move next to him, felt the heat of Harry’s body near his. Could smell him; he smelled different, smoke and charcoal.
He was on a walkway next to a river, lazy and brown, shallow in the dying summer light. He looked to his right and saw a bridge; multicoloured buildings piled two stories high, some dangling over the water precariously. Almost as if they'd been haphazardly stuck there with magic. Which, Harry knew, they had been.
Draco loved California. The brown hills, the bright sun. It was a marvel. Dai brought Draco into the vineyards, the fields, showed him new plants and herbs, new irrigation and harvesting techniques. Drove Draco to the beach in his old Jeep, the top off. The Pacific endless and grey, churning. Draco had never seen anything so significant.
“Wondered where my fucking nine-inch apologia was, eh? Felt a bit left out.” Ron offered a half-smile, and Draco took it.
“Coffee?,” Harry held up one of the cups. The one with cream, no sugar. “Looks like you might need it.”
“Well, he certainly saved me. I’m not so sure I saved him, and it was after I had already used two Unforgivable Curses on people—”
“I do not know, Harry. I’m here with you. I sleep with you. I make love to you. But you never tell me who you think about all the time.”
Draco had initially been wary when Harry kept appearing, hanging around while he worked, pestering him with questions. But once Draco started to relax around him, he found he looked forward to Harry’s visits.
Draco nodded. "I saw one a few times, as part of my probation. He helped me with breathing exercises for when I got too overwhelmed, to calm down again. Centering yourself, he said."
Draco was incandescent. He felt his magic pulse through his veins, bubbling and hot, like lava and fire. He yanked his sock drawer out, dumped the contents on the floor. Found what he was looking for, wrapped in a pair of red socks with lions, a joke gift. Ripped the socks off and held it up: a wooden box, with a stag and doe carved on the lid. Out of breath and losing steam, he ripped it open and took out the ring. Felt the fire in his arm, in his hand. Threw the ring on the floor and cast an
Draco stared at her. She stared back, face politely blank and a little expectant. Fuck, why had he agreed with Pansy?
"Yes," Draco sighed. "Yes, it's very much OK. It's just. I don't want you to have a...crisis of conscience, or whatever. I don't want you to feel bad when you—," Draco trailed off, motioning to his torso, still covered by his shirt. Harry had only managed to get two buttons undone before Draco had stopped him.
Harry shoved his hands in his pockets, rocked on his heels. "I want to take you out on a date because I like you, you great bloody twit, and I want to get to know you better outside of your place of work. And I want to talk to you about something other than work, probably over dinner. And you're fit, and I wouldn't mind seeing what's under all your three-piece suits, if I'm honest. I can wait on that, though. Dinner and a drink first, yeah? Maybe a good night kiss if you're lucky." Harry waggled his eyebrows suggestively. He hoped.
“Do you.” He hesitated. Inhaled, held, exhaled. “Do you think it was me? Did he leave because of me?” He looked at Hermione again, knowing that she could see his agony.
"Ah, yes, OK, you wanted his attention, and you got it by antagonizing him. And then he hurt you in a bathroom, but then you possibly saved him. He saved you, both in a fire during the battle and from a stricter sentence after the war. Then he came to you for professional help. And you started working together, and you became friends, then started dating. You fell in love. You moved in with him. You were going to propose, but then he disappeared—"
“Hey there, bud. How’s it going?,” Harry smiled. Fought the urge to ruffle his hair. It was red and gold today. Harry thought it was odd that Ted had been sporting Gryffindor colors, but he’d been informed, with a teenaged sigh, that they were Iron Man colors, and he had done it for Rose, since it was her birthday and he was her favorite superhero. Harry thought Teddy might have also rolled his eyes while explained it. Harry chose to ignore that.
“You were the one who left. If you recall, I was legally prohibited from leaving the country for five years,” he sniffed.
Harry twirled his wand while Draco pored over a giant textbook. He had a vial of violent blue potion in one hand, his regular black-framed glasses perched on his nose, and the X-Ray specs pushed up on his head. He looked like a bloody mad scientist. Harry tried to breathe evenly.
He looked away from Harry, sat back on his stool, pulled his glasses back down, and continued his examination. Harry was silent, and Draco didn’t prod him.
Draco stared at the ceiling, head resting on the back of the wingback chair in his workroom at Asclepius. Tears leaked out of his eyes, and he wiped them half-heartedly as he stared at the beams that crossed the ceiling, paying particular attention to every place they met. Where they joined, touched.
“And now well. Well, maybe you made the best decision you knew how to at the time. When you left, it was a shit decision, and you hurt a lot of people. But maybe you did the best you could with the information you had at the time,” he sighed again, leaned back. Closed his eyes for a moment.
After six months of searching, the consensus was that Harry had left. Didn’t want to be found. Ron kept mulling it over like it was a problem he could solve, but, to Draco’s surprise, Hermione had been...resigned. Almost as if she knew something like this was going to happen. She stopped researching. She let it go. She let him go.
“Oh. Hi.” He smiled up at Draco. He couldn’t help it. Draco made his heart skip a beat every time. It never failed, not even after three years.
We’re pleased to inform you that your order is ready for collection. To confirm, our artisans have created a platinum band, size nine, with custom engraving. After the initial deposit of two thousand galleons, the remaining balance is four thousand galleons. Please feel free to come by at your leisure. We look forward to your visit.
Draco sat in one of the wingback chairs by the fire. Crossed his legs, plucked at the crease. Held his hand out and accepted the cup from Harry. Took a sip and glared at him, clearly annoyed Harry remembered how he took his coffee. Harry smiled to himself as he took a sip of his own, black and sweet.
He’d been grateful when Draco decided to give him, them, another chance. When Draco went to California, Harry was sure he’d lost him. He’d been sick with it, knew that it was his fault. Hoped anyway.
The shop was a riot of color and whimsy, orange and purple, things puffing and smoking. Different dioramas were charmed to show what each product did: a puking child, a flash of absolute dark, an enlarged tongue. Draco noticed they’d removed the immense love potion display. The Wizangamot had finally classified all love potions as Class Alpha restricted because they removed consent.
"Or things your aunt did," Harry smiled. "As much as might feel like it sometimes, it wasn't your fault.”
“I don’t know, Draco,” she said, hands wrapped around a mug of tea, stared at the scarred butcher block table in her kitchen. Ron was abroad, looking at premises in Germany for a Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes expansion. Their daughter, Rose, was in bed. She wouldn’t meet his eyes.
“My dear Mr. Malfoy, welcome, welcome, come in,” the short, slightly rotund, and balding man ushered him in. He had a thick Greek accent, and the shop smelled like cloves and honey, and the air was warm and dry.
It had been so long. He couldn’t hold on to the resentment anymore. Not when she was sitting in front of him, saying things that, while they hurt, Draco could empathize with.
“You berk,” Harry smiled as they pulled out of the kiss, and grabbed a handful of floo powder. “You go first.”
He frowned.  Faced her fully, wanted to see what this was about. “Sí, completamenter,” he answered, carefully.
Draco thought about the ring that was upstairs, hidden at the back of his sock drawer. Thought about the words he’d had engraved on it.
"Yes, another thing we have in common. We both seemed to have outlived our life expectancies," Draco answered drily.
“Jesus Christ, Malfoy. That’s bloody difficult charm work, yeah? I’ve never heard of such a thing.” Harry’s eyebrows drew together; he still rocked on his feet.
Draco smoothed his waistcoat down and stood up straighter. Good posture had been bred into him, quite literally. He walked to the counter and gripped the edge, hoping it would stop his hands from shaking. He tried to say hello. His voice didn’t cooperate.
Draco approached the counter, and Weasley crossed his arms. Perhaps he pushed out his biceps a bit, Draco noted.
He found Morgana and Fae Fine Jewelers at Diagon Alley's end, past Gringotts and the owl post office. It was a small shop, elegantly appointed, with glass cases adorned with colorful jewels, bright metals gleaming in the soft light. The carpet was royal blue with silver stars, so thick that Harry’s shoes sunk into it. A small man with puffy white hair and tiny glasses emerged from a concealed door.
he'd cast wandlessly last night, after they'd accidentally broken the headboard. He thought about casting scourgify on the mark to remove it, but Harry liked thinking about how they’d damaged the headboard. It had been rather fun; he wouldn't mind trying to break it again.
Harry lifted the lid and, nestled in midnight velvet, was a breathtaking, blinding ring. So bright it was almost white and imprinted with intricate, swirling patterns. He lifted the ring and rolled it in his fingers; it was heavy and solid, warm to the touch. He inspected it and realized the carved patterns moved, twisting around the band. Dragon scales, hawthorn branches, holly leaves; a snitch fluttered. The engravings collapsed in on themselves, reformed, in black and silver, white and smoke. As he turned the ring, constellations sparked and faded, the moon phased, a galaxy spun, a broom sped by, lilies bloomed. The flash of a snowy feather, a chess piece, runes, a rosebud, a toy Quidditch player.
"But you hated me when we were in school. You especially hated me when we were fourteen; you made all those 'Potter Stinks' badges when I was in the Triwizard tournament. Thanks again for that, by the way. Not like a bloody madman was pulling the strings on that whole fiasco for an entire year,” Harry said, pulling on Draco’s hand.
And that was it. All it took was that great, bloody, beautiful stag to jolt him out of his endless sadness and into a blind, all-encompassing rage. He pulled plates out of the cupboards, heaved glasses against the wall. Yanked drawers off their tracks, dumped their contents. Broke chairs, cast a
Draco forced his mouth to form words. “Thank you, Potter. It’s not mine. I work for Mr. Iraklidis, but he’s on a buying trip right now. Might I be of service?” He gripped the edge of the counter, knuckles turning white.
"I see a mind healer. Hermione thought I had PTSD after the war. I didn't know what she meant, so I took an online quiz and answered positively to almost all the questions. I had nightmares; I was jumpy and couldn't relax. I'd hear a door slam, and I'd jump a million feet in the air, wand out. I was always on guard and couldn't sleep. Could barely eat. Ginny and I started dating again, and I thought it would help, but she had nightmares too, and mine made hers worse. My magic started to get unstable, and I had a hard time controlling it. I'd accidentally set papers or curtains on fire if I got angry or had an emotional outburst. So Hermione helped me find a mind healer who is a witch, who’s also familiar with Muggle psychiatry and PTSD treatments. She helped treat soldiers who came home from Afghanistan. She helped me. She still helps me." Harry looked at Draco.
He swirled the potion back and forth, lifting and lowering the different loupes along the way, making notes on a piece of parchment with a fine felt tip Sharpie. How wizards still used quills and ink when Muggles had so many different and lovely kinds of writing implements, Draco would never understand. Sometimes wizards made things more difficult for no reason. He supposed it had something to do with how easy magic made almost everything.
“Come in, my dear boy, let’s go in the back and have a nice chat. Tea?,” he asked as he bustled through a doorway behind the counter.
To her credit, Dr. Ducharme barely raised an eyebrow at this information. Draco was starting to like her. Even if he felt like he was going to jump out of his skin.
"Harry, I know you’re quite observant, you are an Auror for Merlin's sake, and you did manage to defeat a dark lord at seventeen. Please, please tell me you are not surprised by finding out that yes, I fancied you. Quite a bit." Draco blushed.
“And then, when you had new information, and you perhaps knew that you were on the wrong side, you still had awful choices. So you made the best ones you could. The ones you thought would keep you and your mother alive. Were they good choices? Not particularly. But you didn’t know what the outcome of your actions would be, and you were just doing your best.” She stopped, and Draco stared at this lap. He couldn’t think of anything to say.
Ottavia wandered in, dressed in only an oversized grey t-shirt, ripped at the hem, and her knickers, a flash of pink as she walked. Hair piled on top of her head, feet bare, she carried two demitasse cups of coffee. Balanced one on Harry’s rolling art supply cart. Stood just behind him, took a sip of her own coffee.
“And, for the love of Circe, tell the goddamn spooks to stop using their house elves as guinea pigs for dangerous potions. They won’t be affected the same way because their magical cores are biologically different from witches and wizards, so it’s not only a wildly unethical practice, it’s also completely useless. Just how stupid is everyone who works at the Ministry?”
He heard the bell chime over the door. Damn. This was the worst time for a customer. He was about to shout that he just needed a few minutes (three minutes and fifty-three seconds, to be exact) when he heard Dai call, “Don’t stop what you’re doing, love, it’s just me!”
He needed to know. To know what it would be like, with Harry. Without the weight of expectations, of fulfilled destinies. To be together as they were. Flawed. Trying their best. Loving each other, despite their bad choices. Because of them.
Draco nodded and swallowed. He had sent Granger an apology a few weeks ago. He wanted to apologize to Weasley in person, but he needed to write out Granger’s. She always flustered him. She wrote him back, thanking him for his honesty and straightforwardness, and politely but pointedly stating that he had some other people to address as well. She helpfully provided a list, though he hadn’t needed it.
“Draco, what happened?,” he heard Harry ask behind him. He had taken a few steps toward Draco but, blessedly, kept his distance.
Harry was…he was Harry. He was curious and annoying and poked fun at Draco in a way that made his stomach flutter. He moved all the time, twirled his wand, bounced on the balls of his feet. He was intelligent and observant.
Dai rubbed a thumb over his forehead, as if he was trying to smooth the lines there. “Where are you?,” he asked. “Where did you go?”
Potter was still silent, and Draco hazarded a glance in his direction. He had a grim expression on his face, bordering on a scowl. But as a person with a semi-permanent frown, Draco knew that Harry could just be thinking. He figured he’d find out either way, regardless.
Good to his word, Harry stayed. He officially quit the Auror department. Not that they’d been keen to have him back after he’d wasted their resources for months by disappearing. He moved back into Grimmauld Place. He turned one of the sitting rooms on the first floor into a studio. He painted full-time and sold his art under a different name, mostly in Muggle galleries. He wanted people to buy his art for him, not because he was Harry Potter.
He wiped his paintbrush off and dropped it in a cup of water. Finally picked up the coffee and took a sip, black as night and sweet as love.
“Yes, well, Dobby always was rather meddlesome. He did sneak me sweets, though, when I was being punished. Had to knock his head against the hearth to do it, and I never asked him to, but he always brought a treat to cheer me up.” Draco smiled sadly and looked down at the potion.
Draco muttered to himself as he ran his fingers down the book, licking his fingertips every time he turned a page. Harry's breath hitched every time Draco licked his thumb, rubbed it against his pointer and middle fingers, pulled at the corner of the page. He forced himself to look away. Felt his eyes drift back, involuntarily, to Draco’s sharp jaw, flushed cheeks, pale neck. Draco's competence, his interest in his work, his dedication to solving a problem—all of it was a huge turn-on.
“You know it’s up to you now, right Malfoy?” Harry eyed Draco, and Draco tilted his head, questioning. “You don’t have to be the same person. Someone once told me that we’ve all got light and dark in us, but what matters is what we choose. Our choices make us who we are.”
"What?!," Draco yelped as he sat up. "You told the bloody Sorting Hat—an ancient sentient magical artefact—which house to put you in?"
Harry stood outside the door of Asclepius, two coffees in his hands. It was nine o’clock on the dot. If Draco still kept the same habits, he had been at the shop since 8:30, at his worktable in the back. The shop didn’t open for customers until eleven, so Harry hoped they’d have some time to talk. If Draco would talk to him today. He hoped.
“Yes, thank you,” Draco replied as he followed Mr. Iraklidis to the back room. It had a small sitting area in front of a cheerful fireplace on one side and a work area on the other. There was a long table covered in bubbling cauldrons—gold, silver, pewter—and large glass distilling kits, dripping and puffing. Mr. Iraklidis motioned for Draco to sit in one of the wingback chairs by the fire. He poured green tea from a silver teapot into a small glass cup. Draco accepted the glass as he sat and took a sip. It was mint.
“You are an artist, Harry. Your art, it is heartbreaking. This ex-lover of yours, he is beautiful. But you need to paint something else. You need to make room in your heart and your mind for something else.” She tapped his scar, the same as Draco. “For someone else.” She stood on tiptoe and kissed the corner of his mouth. “Dipingi qualcun altro. Per favore.”
Harry met Ottavia in his life drawing class. She sat next to him, caught his eye, and made a joke about nudity being next to godliness or something like that. He hadn’t followed the story very well; his Italian had still been shit. But she laughed easily, her dark eyes shone, and her hair swung while she drew. He found himself staring at soft curves, the way her black t-shirt stretched over her breasts, how her long aquiline nose scrunched when she didn’t like something. He liked her immediately.
After a few more breaths, Ron looked up at him and exhaled fully. His eyes were bright. “Merlin bloody
“What’s in the bag?,” he asked, trailing kisses across the bare skin, just above the collar of his t-shirt.
He reread it. A ring? A six thousand galleon ring? Harry hadn’t ordered a ring. The jeweler had made a mistake. They should be more careful, he thought. What a terrible way to ruin a surprise. Someone should let them know.
So he went to work. He walked to the Leaky from his flat every morning. Ignored the looks he got as he made his way through Diagon Alley. He worked with Angelos, learned how to source high-quality ingredients. The best doxy eggs came from Israel; the most potent fanged geraniums were grown in Botswana. At Angelos’ insistence, he serviced customers in-person, tolerated their glares. At some point, the glares lessened, until they stopped. Draco had a knack for brewing complicated healing potions, ones that even Angelos had a hard time perfecting. Asclepius developed a reputation as one of the better apothecaries in Britain. Draco started a successful mail-order program. He loved working there, and he loved Angelos.
“Hey, there, big man! Got Draco to fly you like Superman again? He’s a big old softie, isn’t he, Hugo?” Hugo giggled and kicked out of Ron’s arms. Ron set him down, and Hugo ran into the garden.
Harry was grateful. He was so grateful, every day, that his family, the family he’d created when he’d had none, had forgiven him. He knew now that those relationships were forever; they were unbreakable.
him. How was Harry ever meant to live his whole life with Draco, without being able to breathe, with needing him so much all the damn time?
“Yeah, yeah, Malfoy, we can say hello as we pass each other in the halls like bloody first-years. Get out of my shop, now,” he said, although there was no venom behind it.
"Well, I was trying to think of things I'd actively chosen. My life...My life was predestined for a long time. I didn't have a lot of choices. I could only come up with three things. Well, four. But I never got to have the fourth thing."
“Ah, I see. At what age did you join the, as you say, ‘fascist cult’?,” Dr. Ducharme paused in her note-taking to study him.
Draco took a breath. "Fair point," he said, trying to keep his voice light. "But Harry, you know, I am sorry about what happened that night. In the graveyard. I know...I know Lucius was there. I heard him talking about it that summer. And I know you saw Cedric get killed. And I. I'm sorry. About Lucius."
Harry was in his studio painting a large-scale portrait of a figure, disjointed and abstract. He’d found he liked building frames, stretching the canvas, prepping it. Blending the paint on his palette, rinsing the brushes in muddy water. He liked how it smelled, the turpentine and oil, heavy and sharp. His dirty jeans hung low on his hips, his bare chest covered with paint splotches.
“So you had no time to antagonize Harry, then. Because you were forced to join a hate group as a sixteen-year-old and then also told to kill your headmaster. Did he threaten you? Coerce you in some way?,” Dr. Ducharme asked.
But Teddy had grown up knowing love. Harry still felt guilty about leaving his godson. Like he’d let Remus and Tonks down. It was fading, but he felt awful about missing so much time. He owled Ted at Hogwarts once a week, now. Even if Teddy didn’t owl him back all the time. He was a teenager, Harry understood. Harry just wanted to let him know he was still here. No matter what.
Dr. Ducharme leveled another look at Draco. “A relationship’s success is not dependent on its length. Just because it ended doesn’t mean it failed.”
"Think about it, though. We could have been tiny Gryffindors together. You would have shared a dorm with us, and we would have had all our classes together. You and Hermione are both such swots; you'd probably have spent all your time studying together." Harry let his hand drift down towards Draco's hip, traced the skin at the edge of the duvet.
"Yes, because one spends hours and hours charming badges with someone's face on them because they hate them. Not because they have a crush on them and only know how to get that person's attention in the worst way possible," Draco said, smiling a little.
Harry’s persistence hadn’t changed, but he was different. More thoughtful. Calmer. He was still an incorrigible flirt, still funny and wry.
“Yes,” Draco said. “I’m not sure what an exact timeline really has to do with this…” he trailed off.
He studied the man in front of him. He certainly looked like Harry, but he wasn’t the Harry he knew, the one he saw in his dreams. The one who appeared in his memories before he could push them away.
"Well, next time, maybe don't fight me so much on the finer points of street food, yeah?" Harry's eyes were sparkling behind his glasses, and he tugged Draco closer.
Harry turned to go. “One more thing, Mr. Potter.” He paused. “The ring. It’s charmed to update. As you grow, as your family grows. The images evolve with you. Mr. Malfoy was quite insistent that it do this. He said something to the effect of ‘you create your family.’”
Harry turned his palm over, pressed a kiss in the center, placed Draco’s hand on Harry's cheek. They stared into each other's eyes, so close Draco could feel Harry's breath on his cheeks. He smelled like burnt sugar and tea, cedar and cinnamon. Draco lost himself in Harry's eyes; he couldn't look away even if he wanted to. Everything else faded into the background; the sound of the ocean, the wind nipping at them, the few tourists on the pier.
An arm slipped around Draco’s waist. He turned to Hermione, drew her in. She leaned her head on his shoulder.
So he stayed. He tried not to think about what he was doing to Draco. To Ron and Hermione, and little Rose. To Teddy and Andromeda. The Weasleys, Ginny; Luna and Neville. He was pleasantly surprised to discover he didn't much give a fuck about what he was doing to his colleagues at the DMLE. Or to Kingsley, for that matter. He knew they’d probably sent out search parties for him. But he also knew they wouldn’t find him. Italian wizards were nothing if not discreet. Too much time hiding in plain sight from the Catholics had given them a particular perspicacity for blending in.
“Like everything you say is interesting to him. Like he’d never get tired of listening to you talk. Like he thinks you’re something precious. Something you need to be careful with.”
Harry would have done anything to protect Draco, even from Narcissa. Harry knew Draco’s moods, his feelings; he’d do anything to make sure he was OK. Narcissa had saved Harry for Draco. But now Harry would save Draco from everyone. His fierce need to protect Draco, to make him safe, it was overwhelming. It needed air. Harry didn’t have any to give it.
“Now, back to this potion, Potter, what kind of nitwits do you have working for you at the DMLE? This is very much a transmutation potion, trickier to brew than polyjuice but more effective. You don’t need a bit of organic material of the person you want to disguise yourself as; you merely have to have an image of the visage you wish to mimic. Lasts longer than polyjuice too. No wonder it’s Class Alpha Major restricted.” He handed the vial back to Potter.
Maybe it wasn’t a failure. Maybe it was just over.  He nodded stiffly. “OK, then. Forgiving myself. How do we do that?”
“You know, I wasn’t half as cheeky as you when I was your age.” Harry traded the ring pouch for the beer again.
Draco pulled him into a kiss, long and slow. Slipped his tongue into Harry’s mouth, sighed into it. He pulled back and smiled.
"Please," Draco whispered back, and then everything shrunk; the only thing that existed was Harry's mouth on his. He tasted like salt and vinegar, too, like the ocean and something else, something uniquely Harry. Draco lost himself, tucked his fingers in Harry's waistband, stroked the smooth skin at his waist, and pulled him even closer. Harry gasped, wrapped Draco in his arms, parted his lips, and licked into Draco's mouth. Draco moaned as their tongues slid against each other, as he pulled at Harry's bottom lip with his teeth. As the kiss deepened, their glasses clinked together. They both smiled into each other's mouths, drew back at the same time.
“No, no, it’s OK, I could do with the walk. Curry OK? Chicken vindaloo?” Harry had to get this cleared up. He set his glass down on the coffee table and shoved the scroll in his pocket.
, a cleaning charm, a mistake. Marks made in love. Harry liked Draco in bed, slightly mussed and undone, snoring lightly in his sleep. Or shaking with pleasure, wrapped in his arms, covering Harry’s lips with his own, breaths mingling. Harry had been so surprised by Draco, by his quiet need to make the right choice, his need to face things head-on. He had fallen in love with Draco too easily; it was almost as if he hadn’t had a choice at all.
Ottavia was from Bologna, which had a long wizarding history, particularly in food. Muggles didn’t invent prosciutto and parmesan; tortellini and bolognese. She had a northern accent and a bit of a chip on her shoulder. He liked that about her too, her need to prove herself as worldly as the other students. He also liked that she liked him. And she liked other people. And sometimes she liked him with other people.
Draco felt cornered. He wasn’t at his best when he felt cornered. “Oh yes, terribly sorry,” his voice thick with his poshest accent, dripping with sarcasm, “I did rather quite forget to mention that the evil despot did, in fact, tell me that if I failed in murdering my headmaster who, by the by, was the greatest wizard who had ever lived, he would kill my mother and make me watch. And then I believe he was going to kill me after. Said he’d feed me to his quite large snake, as it were.” Draco met her gaze evenly for a few seconds, then dropped his head, abashed.
“Well, then. How about second chances? And call me Angelos.” Mr. Iraklidis had raised his glass, dark eyes sparkling.
on the headboard they’d enthusiastically broken. The spell had gone wild, scarring the moulding. A faded brown starburst when Draco had overdone a cleaning charm on the sheets. A pale line from a wand grabbed during a nightmare, aimed upward at the last minute. Draco had caught him, held him close. A history of them. Marks made in love, now faded to almost nothing.
Draco tried very hard not to gape. Not only was Potter standing here, in Asclepius and looking very fit, but he was here to ask for Draco’s help on an illegal potions case. One the DMLE and the Department of Mysteries hadn’t been able to solve. Well, it didn’t sound as if the Department of Mysteries had tried to figure anything out, except lend a couple of house elves as test subjects which, Draco agreed, was entirely unethical. And cruel. He thought of Dobby, and Drizzy and Metulo, the other house elves at the Manor. He had loved them, even if it had been unbefitting for a Malfoy. Draco composed himself.
“Yes, well. That ring, Draco. It was stunning. It was...it was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen. It was thoughtful and perfect. And then. And then the jeweler told me that it was charmed to evolve with us, with our family. And it took my breath away. It broke my heart.”
Draco squared his shoulders. Harry knew he did this when he was gearing up to give a speech, when he needed to compose himself. He liked that he knew something about Draco, something he’d observed himself.
Harry leaned back again; Draco rubbed his hands down Harry's chest, through the dark hair. Smiled at him, sly. "I thought you said I wouldn't have to stand anymore."
Draco glanced over at Harry, drank in his skin that glowed in the sunset, his messy black hair blowing in the wind, his full lips. They were walking hand-in-hand down the Brighton pier. Draco mentioned how he'd never been, that his parents had thought it low class, and Harry had insisted they go there, today, right now, for their date. Harry had apparated them, just like that. Like it was nothing to be spontaneous, to do something for someone else. He envied Harry for it.
Draco nodded and turned to leave. He was about to open the door when Weasley called after him. “Harry doesn’t have it in him to hold a grudge, Malfoy. He saved you. He spoke for you. You don’t need to prove anything to him.” Draco hesitated, hand on the doorknob. He nodded at Weasley and left.
Draco stood up from the chair in the courtroom, breathing heavy and shaking. It was finally over. He had been sentenced to five years probation, given a small stipend from the depleted Malfoy vaults to find a flat, and directed to find employment and to “make himself a useful member of both Wizarding and Muggle society.” Whatever that meant.
Draco flexed his fingers on the counter and pushed off, ran his hands through his hair, rubbed his face under his glasses. Potter wasn’t wrong; Draco had done all of those things. But they hadn’t seemed quite so impressive while he was doing them. He just tried to help people rather than hurt them.
Harry lost himself in Draco. His long, pale limbs wrapped around him, the way they fit together, the way they moved. Draco's mouth, his hands left him trembling and weak, wanting more. Harry felt like he'd never be able to get enough of him. And he sunk into Draco, gave himself over, let Draco take up more of his breath, his heart, his head.
Draco went to shove him playfully in his chest, chuckling, and Harry caught his hand. He raised it to his lips, gently kissed his fingers, his knuckles, the spaces between, just as Draco had. He could barely breathe, could barely think. There was only Harry, his black hair, the scar that sliced down his forehead, his glasses, his green eyes. Clear brown skin. His mouth on Draco's hand, his soft lips. It was the single most erotic moment of Draco's life.
He wasn’t surprised the jeweler recognized him. Harry nodded and held out the letter. “I received this from you earlier this evening. I believe it’s a mistake. I didn’t order a ring.”
He turned back to Draco, ran a hand through his hair. He had wondered how Draco's hair would feel; it was soft and smooth, with a tiny bit of texture.
Harry tugged at his hand. "Have you thought about going again? I could get you the name of someone. Not my mind healer, that might be a bit weird, but someone she recommends?"
Draco smiled. He loved having a partner in the shop again. It made the days pass quickly, and Dai was an excellent potioneer, knowledgeable in areas that were Draco’s weak spots. He pushed Draco to learn more, do more.
Draco barely spoke to his mother anymore. Usually twice a year, once on his birthday and once on hers. Perfunctory Christmas gifts were owled. They hadn’t seen each other since she’d left the country after their trials. At first, because he couldn’t leave based on the conditions of his parole. Later, because he didn’t want to.
Harry took a deep breath. Finally took his hands out of his pockets. “I saw the ring,” he said, softly.
“Draco, hear me out. It was spectacular, it was thoughtful and meaningful, and I cried when I saw it. I knew how much thought went into it, and I was humbled. Grateful. I was so thankful you wanted to marry me. And I knew. I knew I’d say yes. To you. With or without that bloody amazing ring. And I just. Couldn’t.” Draco’s face fell again, and Harry rushed on.
He knew he was a hypocrite. He’d had his own relationship with Ottavia. She’d known, though. She’d known better than he had, that a part of his heart, a part of himself, was still in England. Maybe most of himself. It wasn’t just Draco he’d left.
They met at a potions conference in Morocco six months ago. Angelos had retired before—before, everything. He moved back to Morocco, a place he considered home far more than Greece or England. Draco hadn’t been abroad since—well, since.
“Thank you,” Draco said, trying to convey how grateful he was without saying more. He was afraid he might cry.
Draco hadn’t been able to keep him away, but he kept Harry at arm’s length. He was still dating Dai, even though Dai was half a world away. And Draco loved Dai. He took a month off, went to visit Dai in Santa Barbara, to do research. He operated Asclepius remotely, fulfilling only mail orders.
He stopped, eyed Draco warily. Draco wasn’t crying or frowning or scowling or smiling. He wasn’t doing much of anything. Harry waited. Draco took a sip of coffee. Put his cup on the table between them, pushed up his glasses, and leaned over, elbows on knees, face in hands.
Draco liked working with Harry. The potions Harry brought him were always tricky, sometimes dangerous. He liked isolating the ingredients, defining the potion's magical properties, working backward to see what had stumped the (rather ineffective, in Draco's opinion) potions masters at the DMLE. He'd felt proud that Harry had chosen him, had made him an official consultant.
Harry took a sip of his drink as he rolled up the parchment and shook his head. “Sorry, love, I didn’t. What were you saying?”
Dai smiled at Draco every morning like it was an easy thing to do. Draco supposed that, for Dai, it was. He let his fingers card through Dai's hair, trail down his back, playfully tap the dimples right above his arse.
“Yes, but I was still here. You left me here. Alone.” Draco felt himself getting choked up. Dammit. He wouldn’t cry in front of her. Not after all this time.
Draco's hand stilled, tilted his head. "What do you mean you 'chose Gryffindor'? The hat sorted you into Gryffindor."
Harry made his way through the winding streets, trying to pick out landmarks that he recognized from the book. Occasionally, he stopped to ask someone to set himself to rights. Florence was flooded with international students and tourists, so most people spoke a little English, and Harry knew enough to say, “Scusci, mi dispiace, conosco solo un po d’italiano, parle inglese?,” even if he butchered the accent.
Dai covered Draco’s hand with his own. He took it, kissed his knuckles. Draco inhaled sharply, tried to forget, to concentrate on what was happening right now, in front of him. Not Brighton, or Grimmauld, or a thousand other places in England. Here.
Back at the house, trainers left in the foyer. To the kitchen for coffee—tea was for the afternoon, coffee was for the morning—and toast, buttered with jam. His seat at the table, warm wood with light polish, pockmarks and stains. Each mark, another story. Sometimes he’d go through each one here too, a history of them. Most days he didn’t anymore.
“Ah, yes, traditional mint tea from Morocco. I lived there for a bit and developed a habit. It’s also hospitable to offer it to your guest and, as you are my guest, it is only right. Cheers.” Mr. Iraklidis lifted his glass and took a sip. He seemed content to sit and drink tea, disinclined to further the conversation.
“You do that, you know. Disappear sometimes. I can see you drift off. What are you thinking about when you do that?,” Dai asked.
Dai was patient. He let Draco work it out, didn’t ask questions, or demand any more physical contact. Draco thought it through. Thought about how he grieved, even though he wasn't dead. Dr. Ducharme had said that Draco wasn't responsible for anyone's happiness except his own. And happiness wasn't a constant state, that it was our life's work to learn how to live with all emotions, to embrace every one.
Malfoy.” He huffed out another breath. “OK, first, no, you may not call me Ron; that is way too weird. And two, you’re right—I do not forgive you. But mostly because it’s not my place, and yeah, what good would it even do. Three, and seriously fuck me, Malfoy, I cannot believe I’m going to say this to you, but,” another deep breath, “thank you for your condolences about Fred. We miss him every day. And Bill is OK, thank you. Somehow looks even more bloody fit with those scars Greyback gave him, the wanker.” He gave a tiny smile.
Draco shook his head, remembered the X-ray specs were still on it, and set them down on the counter. "Not yet. I have to do some more tests, try to reverse engineer the ingredients to see what's in it. It's nasty stuff; I can tell you that."
Draco had held him close this morning, taking in the lines of his nose, his neck, his back. Breathed him in.
Draco looked down at his hands, felt himself shrink, and the familiar, sullen feeling of his childhood settled over him. “He wouldn’t shake my hand.”
"Yes, just two former enemies, standing here in front of each other and somehow, against everyone's best guesses, still alive. And at the beach. On a date. Who would have thought?" Harry was still smiling.
Draco passed Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes twice a day, every day, for over a year before he worked up the courage to go in. He took a late lunch and hoped that the store would be quiet, since all the school-aged children were still at Hogwarts. He knew that George, the surviving twin, still ran the place. But he wanted to speak to Ron.
He had scheduled check-ins with a parole officer from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement every two weeks. All in all, Draco was grateful. He could have done much worse. And would have.
"You keep calling me Auror Potter, and I'll bring you anywhere you want." Harry raised an eyebrow. Merlin, he was a flirt.
“Draco,” Dr. Ducharme said. "I know it's difficult to think about. But we should perhaps talk about it, oui?"
“Yes, I’d rather say it was.” Draco looked back up, a bit taken aback. She was smiling. He tried to smile a little, too.
“When you left. When you left, Harry. God, that was awful. We all thought you had been taken or were dead. But then. When we realized you weren’t. There seemed to be a consensus. Just among Hermione and Pansy, mind you, too bloody insightful for their own good. Hermione accepted that you left on your own, far too quickly. Thought it had to do with me. And Pansy, well. Pansy thought that I never forgave myself because you did it for me.” Draco’s brow furrowed.
Ottavia was a Regolare, a regular, what the Italians called Muggles. They went to school with both wizards and Regolari—there was no separation here, and interacting with magical society was typical for Italians. To Ottavia, Harry was just a wizard, which didn’t mean all that much to her. He wasn’t The Chosen One; he wasn’t anyone exceptional.
He took a deep breath, mustered up what little courage he had left, and chose to tell Dr. Ducharme the whole sordid tale. She took notes as she listened. He cried. He banged his fist against the armchair. He finally got it all out. And, when he was done, he felt lighter. Waited for her to respond.
Dai looked into his eyes, the way he always did when he was working through something, formulating a response.
He remembered that the entrance to the wizarding area, Piazza della Cerchio, was outside the Uffizi, but couldn’t remember how you got in. He doubted it mattered very much, though; he vaguely remembered that lines defining Muggle and Wizarding society were less rigid in Italy. A Muggle hotel near the Piazza, then.
He started to open his mouth, to protest, to say that Harry could have been taken forcibly, that something could be wrong, but she stilled him with a raised hand, oxblood nails flashing.
Draco pulled back and looked into Harry’s eyes. Harry could drown in those pools of grey, deep as an ocean.
Draco turned back to his mother. “I do believe Harry asked a relevant question. I’d be quite interested in hearing the answer. Mother.”
Narcissa insisted on making excuses for his father, encouraging Draco to forgive him, to write to him in Azkaban. Draco could never deny the force of her love for very long, so he had. It had been...as expected. Long, vitriolic screeds, listing the ways how Draco had disgraced the Malfoy name, his ancestors. How he’d neglected his duty during the war. How he was a nasty poof who didn’t belong in a pureblood family. Draco sent the letter to his mother, hopeful she would finally see that he needed to let Lucius go.
He tried new things. Went to Pizza Express and Nando’s. He found out that he didn’t like white pizza. He did like chicken thighs with hot sauce and peri-peri fries. He learned about football and went to the movies. He thought Arsenal was a bit shit, but he liked The Matrix. He bought clothes from H&M. He used his small trust and got a Muggle apartment in Shadwell, just outside Diagon Alley.
“Draco!,” a small voice screamed as a tiny red-headed body flung itself across Draco’s chest, practically knocking the wind out of him.
“OK, just needed a break from Victoire for a minute. She can talk. A lot,” Teddy gave a short laugh.
Draco inhaled for four, held, exhaled for four. He squared his shoulders, stood up straight. Squeezed Harry’s hand and moved past him. He felt Harry move behind him, over towards Andy, heard him whisper furiously,
“I love you, DL,” she said. He smiled at her nickname for him, his initials. They said, “I love you,” all the time, now. Now that they knew how much they could lose; their friendship, their family.
“Hello.” Draco smiled back and handed him his firewhiskey. “Did you hear anything I said, dear?,” he asked as he sat down in the armchair across from Harry’s.
"You are a bloody idiot, Harry," Draco said softly, and Harry's heart jumped at hearing him say his name. "Of course, I'll go out with you."
Draco puffed out a breath. "You incorrigible flirt," he smiled into Harry's cheek, rubbed his lips on Harry's stubble.
“I know there’s nothing I can do to atone for my terrible choices and actions fully, and I know I’m not deserving of your forgiveness. I do think apologies are an acknowl—”
"Don't start something you're not ready to finish, Malfoy," Harry nearly growled, and he planted a quick kiss on Draco's neck, behind his ear, sending a shiver down his spine.
Rose and their cousins were playing, their aunts and uncles keeping an eye on things. Bill and Fleur were there with George, Percy and Audrey, Charlie and his boyfriend, Lamar. Ginny was up on a broom, tossing charmed balloons in the air, exploding them into showers of sparks. Her girlfriend, Rex, was helping. Neville and Luna were by the drinks table, Luna heavily pregnant. Molly and Arthur were at a picnic table, sipping on pink lemonade and vodka sours with Andromeda and Narcissa.
Draco was unmoored. His mother had fled to France, which was best for everyone, and Lucius was serving a ten-year sentence in Azkaban, which was also best for everyone. Draco suspected Lucius wouldn’t make it out of there alive, not this time, but he couldn’t muster caring one way or another, really. He knew he should have an emotion about his parents, but it took everything he had just to put one foot in front of the other. It was Harry’s words that he heard in his head, like a drumbeat. Your choices define you. It’s not so black and white.
He’d done either the wrong thing or, even worse, nothing at all for most of his life. Draco had ignored his intuition for years, tried to survive. Tried to keep his parents alive. Never thought about right or wrong. He had learned how to ignore the most intrinsic part of himself. He didn’t know how to trust himself. That snake-faced arsehole and his aunt had made sure of that.
But then Sirius had died, and Harry had never told anyone about the letter. And Remus had married Tonks, and Harry had been happy for them, too, even as he mourned Sirius. How he’d never had his chance. But they had Teddy, and Harry was endlessly grateful, even if it still hurt sometimes.
"I do not want to hear it, Harry,” he said, still soft but firm. “I do not. What I want is for you to take ten more seconds to have your meltdown, and then I'm going to take this shirt off, and then we are going to spend the next twenty-four hours in this bed. Do you hear me? I've finally got a glimpse of you under that Auror coat, and I was right, you are bloody fit, and I plan on having my way with you. So. Ten seconds," Draco smiled and kissed his neck.
Becoming an Auror had been the easiest and most obvious thing to do after the war, but Harry hadn't really thought about it when he joined. He did it because it was easy, and it felt like... like he owed it to people. He had picked the potions cold cases, after the first one, because of Draco. So it came back to Draco. Sometimes it felt like it always came back to Draco.
Harry inhaled. He needed to be honest. “But then I fell in love with Florence. I enrolled in art school. And things were simple, for the first time, ever. I was doing something new, somewhere new. I wasn’t Harry Potter, the Saviour. And the Italians don’t give a fuck about all that. Frankly, they give so few fucks that I never had to hide at all, and they never told anyone I was there. And I missed you. I missed all of you so much. But I also got to be...not who I was to all of you. I got to be me.” He stopped again, took another breath.
Harry Potter stood in front of him. It took his brain a moment to work it out. Harry Potter was here. In Asclepius. Messy black hair, glasses, green eyes. In a grey Auror coat with red piping and brass buttons. The last time Draco had seen him was after his trial, six years ago. Potter had been skinny, drowning in too large Muggle suits. The Potter in front of him looked like, well…he looked like a man. He was broader through the shoulders, and his hair had grown out a bit. He had stubble on his chin, and he carried an air of authority that had always been there, but now seemed calmer. More settled.
“You seem to be placing an adult-level amount of blame on the shoulders of your teenage self. I know it’s quite hard, with hindsight, not to re-examine every bad thing we’ve ever done, to go over how we could have known better, done better, or made better choices. But each of us typically does the best we can with the information we have at the time. Did you make some bad choices? Yes. Were you surrounded by adults who were also making bad choices and encouraging you to do the same? It seems so.” She paused. Draco fidgeted.
“I just wanted to know,” Harry said as he blotted his face more. “I didn’t know if it was what I thought. But, it is, and now I know, so. Well.” He took a deep breath. “It seems as though your assistant is a bit shit at their job.”
Draco breathed in for four, held, out for four. “I was. Voldemort gave me a task. My fath—Lucius was in prison; he had failed. The dark lord was angry with my—Lucius, for his failure, and he demanded that I join the Death Eaters as his replacement. So then, when I went back to school, Voldemort… he… he demanded that I kill the headmaster of our school. Before the end of the school year. So. I had to….figure out how to do that,” he trailed off again, the familiar shame creeping.
“It’s none of your business. Please. I’m begging you. For the last shred of my sanity. I need you to leave.” Draco started to choke up, his anger dissipating. Pressed his knuckles to his mouth.
“Well, I imperiused the bar owner as a part of the plan I had to mur—to take care of the headmaster. And I was forced to
Draco talked to Hermione about him, once, about a month after the searches had stopped. It became clear that, in Harry’s absence, the friendship that had developed between Draco and Ron and Hermione had its limits. He had taken part of Draco with him, but he’d also taken parts of his two best friends. Draco knew there were depths to Harry’s relationship with Ron and Hermione that were unknowable to him. He went to her.
He hadn’t thought about where he was going when he disapparated. Harry was lucky he hadn’t splinched himself. But here he was, staring at the magical buildings on a magical bridge in an ancient magical city. Harry could practically feel the magic, old and heavy, like carmine and ochre paint, like molten gold, incense, and cypress rising from the banks of the Arno. It settled around him like a heavy blanket, and he felt the bands around his chest loosen.
Draco broke the kiss, pulled back a little. “Thank you,” he whispered. Thought about the last time someone else had gone to get dinner. He started to push the thought away, but remembered his work with Dr. Ducharme, to embrace all emotions. He tried to lean into it, into the pain of the memory—the fear and anger. The deep sadness, when he had realized what happened.
“Ah, yes. I would like to…well, you see, he gave me a bit of advice when he returned my wand after the trial, and I’ve been trying to take it. I’m not sure how well I’m doing, so I was planning on waiting to offer Har—Potter— my apologies until I…until I felt as though I was in a better place. After having followed his advice.” Draco shifted uncomfortably.
Harry couldn't help it. He started to laugh. "Draco, Jesus. You sound like Robards, handing out orders." He flopped back down on the bed, rubbed his hands over his face.
“Because I was an arrogant, condescending, imperious child who ordered my friends around, idolized my father—who held some deeply problematic views on blood supremacy—and I eventually became part of his fascist cult. I was also incredibly mean-spirited and quite creative in my methods of antagonization. I went for the low blow, every time. I made fun of Harry for being an orphan, for his—our—friend Ron, for his family being poor. I called his—our—other friend, Hermione, a racist slur because she was Muggle-born. I was hateful. I didn’t deserve his friendship, even before I joined the fascist cult.”
Draco stilled, felt as if he moved at all, if he even breathed, he would cease to exist. It was a trick of the mind. He was sad about Dai, and he somehow conjured an image. This was his magic gone awry. It wasn’t real.
Draco stared at the ceiling, arms behind his head, white sheets pushed down to his hips, torso bare and still scarred. He didn't startle awake anymore, didn't need to count the spell marks on the ceiling, or complete any of his other rituals. Well, except running. He still ran. Dr. Ducharme, his mind healer, said the exercise was good for him. But he took days off now.
“I’m sorry, Potter, my mentor isn’t in right now, as I’ve said. I’d be happy to have him look at this when he returns. I’m not sure if you’d be able to—”
Draco snorted and shoved his hands in his trousers. He spun around to face Harry. “Well, for starters, my boyfriend went out for dinner three years ago and never came home,” he spat.
“Acknowledgement of harm,” Potter interrupted. “I do speak to Ron and Hermione, you know,” he said, pointedly.
Before he could think, Harry nodded. Knowlton disappeared through the wall again, and Harry mopped up his face, blew his nose. He was a mess. Draco wanted to marry him. Merlin, Godric, and Salazar too. Draco wanted to
He picked up the vial and headed to the back room. He looked over his shoulder and saw Potter still standing in the center of the shop, hands in his pockets, coat shoved behind his arms.
Draco cleared his throat. “Yes, well, anyway. I would like to apologize. And. Well. And to let you know that I heard you, when you gave me my wand back. That our choices determine who we are. I heard you. And I’ve been trying to make better choices. I just wanted to...I wanted to say all of that before we really get started here, with the potion. I needed to say it,” he finished, lamely.
Draco had never apologized to him. He tried a few times. Wrote letters and tore them up. Draco could make better choices when it came to almost everything, except Potter. He had no idea how to thank him, for saving him from the fire, for the trial, his mother, his wand. Harry’s curse still scarred his chest. It was impossible.
Ron snorted. “Don’t I bloody half well know it. OK, Malfoy, you’ve said your piece to me. Who’s next on your apology world tour, eh? Let me give you a clue: if it’s not Harry, it better fucking well be.”
Do you think that if something happened to him, they wouldn’t have found him? He left, Draco. Of his own accord. You need to let him go.”
Teddy was lounging on the lawn with Victoire. They were on summer holiday from Hogwarts, both teenagers now, and significantly above it all. They grew up together, hung around with the same crowd at school, so they usually retreated when faced with the younger kids—lamented that they couldn’t perform magic at home.
They had sprung into action, easily, as if it was an old cloak they knew how to wear. They’d gotten the DMLE involved, MACUSA. Contingents from Asia and Australia, Africa's confederations, and South American governments. Every agency had searched the underground networks, the leftover Death Eater factions. Muggle terrorist networks, the Dark Web, even. There was no trace of him.
Harry needed to let the proprietor of the shop know about the mix-up. He could apparate over to the jewelers quickly; they could still be open. Then he could grab dinner and be back. It would hardly take any time. If they were closed, he’d know that he had at least tried, and he could go back again tomorrow.
Six months after his trial ended, he got an owl. A potioneer, Angelos Iraklidis, asked if Draco wanted to apprentice with him. Draco was suspicious. Who would possibly want to employ him? His shop, Asclepius Apothecary, was at the far end of Diagon Alley. It wasn’t terribly promising, but Draco needed a job.
Dr. Ducharme set her notebook aside. “Draco, it seems to me like you were raised a certain way. And you had certain prejudices and were perhaps a bit antagonistic towards Harry when you were young. Then you were inducted into this order, this group of fascists, and you were trying to stay alive and trying to protect your mother, all while only sixteen. So you left Harry alone. And then, when you saw him next, you did your best to protect him, even if you don’t feel like it was enough. And then you tried to save him again, in the hidden room. And then he and his friends saved you. So, it seems to me that, when your lives were literally on the line, you both chose to protect each other in the best ways you could.”
Draco stared at the ceiling, looking for a mark, an imperfection, anything to focus on. It was perfectly smooth and featureless—how Draco felt. His head was tilted back, resting uncomfortably on the back of the overstuffed chair.
Draco always fascinated him. Harry had wanted an excuse to see him, to confront him. Had jumped when presented with one. Hadn’t meant for it to be anything more than just satisfying his curiosity. He’d fallen in love anyway. Never stopped to think about it.
So he found a flat near Il Duomo. He enrolled in the Florence Academy of Fine Arts. He was the Saviour of the Wizarding World, an ex-Auror, and had abandoned everyone he ever loved. Everyone who had ever loved him.
She was taking notes, her biro flying across the notebook. “Yes, and when you started working together, when he came and asked for your help. How old were you then?”
"Well, Potter, seeing as I do have an actual job, and I'm not merely the DMLE's plaything, I'd say two weeks? Maybe three?,” Draco huffed, crossed his arms.
Draco sank down onto his stool, put his head in his hands. “I don’t want to understand. I’ve already had my heart broken once today. I cannot stand this. I can’t,” he said through his fingers as he pressed them to his eyes.
Narcissa cleared her throat. “Yes. Well. I suppose I thought it was better for you to have a fresh start without me. I know I didn’t do enough to protect you. I did try. I would like to think you know I did. But I should have gotten us out of there. Never let Voldemort give you the Mark. Never let your father allow them in our house, with us still there. I felt like you might have a better time making your way without me. I was so guilty. I didn’t trust myself. I wanted you to try to forgive your father, but I didn’t think I could ask the same of you. For you to forgive me.”
Mr. Iraklidis smiled. “Ah, yes. You see, I was once in a spot of trouble as a young man, and someone gave me a second chance. I read about your trial, and Mr. Potter’s testimony. I was reminded of my own poor choices and of the person who helped me. I thought that, perhaps, it was my time to pay it forward. I also heard that you were quite a good potions student at Hogwarts, so it seems as if it is moíra.”
He knew, somewhere deep inside, that Harry’s forgiveness had been Draco’s absolution. If he was honest, he liked it. He liked knowing that he somehow had saved the last part of Draco, even as he’d admired him. Harry pushed his glasses up on his forehead, rubbed his face. Crossed the room, sat in the window, lit a cigarette. Filthy habit. He loved it anyway.
Draco cleared his throat. “Yes, well. Hello. I’m not sure if you know this, but I, ah, I work in Asclepius Apothecary down the street, and well, I had hoped to perhaps talk to you if you had a moment.” Draco paused. “And if you were agreeable to a conversation.”
“Yeah, I’ve seen you around,” Ron answered gruffly. “I don’t see how we could possibly have anything to talk about, though, Malfoy, so why don’t you just tell me why you’re here. The sooner I know what you want, the sooner I can tell you to bugger off, yeah?”
Dai had gone home. He’d known it was coming; they’d agreed that Dai couldn’t turn down the opportunity he’d received. He’d been offered the position of Lead Potioneer at a prestigious potions Academy in Santa Barbara, in the Santa Ynez mountains, where potions ingredients grew spectacularly among the pinot grapes.
Draco walked over to a clean spot on the worktable and exchanged his black-framed glasses for a different pair, ones with different coloured loupes attached, sticking out at all angles. He examined the swirling potion through them. It had medium viscosity but moved on its own, shimmering different colors as it undulated, red and green, gold and purple. Draco hadn’t seen anything like it and, as he held it up to the light, he began lowering the loupes in front of the glasses, in different combinations, studying it carefully.
). Scanned the day’s paper. He was looking, as always, for a sign. Anything. An offhand sentence in a political story. A letter to the editor. An ad in the back.
He found a small hotel, Casa del Garbo. He checked in, using his terrible Italian and a muggle credit card he kept on him for emergencies. And, well. A beautiful, perfect, terrifying ring counted as an emergency.
He got up, went to the bathroom, took a slash, brushed his teeth with a stupid Muggle toothbrush, two full minutes, for what. Got his running kit on. He needed to run every day, no matter the weather. Forty minutes, four miles, no exceptions. It helped clear his head, get rid of the ghosts. As much he ever really could.
“You never sleep,” she said, smiling, as she reached out to trace his scar. She was the only person he had let do that since…since Draco. Harry pushed the thought aside.
He was here on official DMLE business again. He'd been consulting with Draco a couple of times a month for almost a year. Somewhere along the way, Harry had stopped thinking of Draco as Malfoy. He was just Draco. Not that Draco knew that.
“I have to admit, I rather expected a letter or request for a meeting years ago, after you reached out to Ron and Hermione and apologized to them. I was in a bit of a state about it, for a while.” He took his hands out of his pockets, ran them through his hair. “Jesus, Malfoy. You always could get under my skin. I wondered why you apologized to them and not to me. Not after I bloody well testified for you at your trial and gave you your wand back, not to mention saving your sorry arse from that fire. I deserved an apology too. I wanted it. I tried to figure out why you didn’t want to acknowledge the harm done to me, but you could to my best mates,” he huffed.
