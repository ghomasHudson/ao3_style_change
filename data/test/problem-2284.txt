Harry heaves his body once again and shifts to his other side. It’s sometime between midnight and sunrise and he simply can
“Of course.”
Harry sighs. “Well, there’s a silver lining in the media shitstorm that will follow our coming out.”
The addition was more than Harry had initially envisioned, but it would suit their family well. Downstairs, they’re adding a den for relaxing and entertaining — a combination of playroom and game room — another bathroom, a library, plus a new mudroom with extra storage. Upstairs, they had opted to add two more bathrooms and four more bedrooms, one of which will be set up as a “study” for the children for now, complete with a desk and workspace for each.
“I am; I think I’d really like it.” His eyes turn downward as his expression falls slightly. “I’m still concerned I’m not smart enough, though.”
“Dinner will be another half hour or so. We can go get started?”
Harry pulls out a loaf of Italian bread and lays it on the counter. If he’s going to have potentially eventually romantic company for dinner, he’d better dress it up a bit; at least with some salad and bread. Turning back to the cutting board, Harry forces himself to focus on the task at hand.
A single finger massages gently around Harry’s opening and he forces himself to relax. Draco looks up to his face and he nods.
“I think that sounds wonderful.” Draco kisses him back. “When were you thinking?”
“So what should we tell James? This is so much for two teenage boys to have to navigate.” Harry doesn’t know how to tell a child who was always accepted how to watch his boyfriend navigate a potential parental rejection. “James never had to have some big ‘coming out.’ The kids grew up knowing I’m bi and that they’d be accepted no matter their sexuality. James got his first crush on a boy when he was like…seven? Eight maybe?”
Harry’s heart is suddenly full to bursting and he's grinning so hard his face is splitting in two and the poor pillow is being gently pounded with excitement. “I’d like that. Quite a lot, actually.”
“We know you’ll probably keep sharing a bed with James — we’re not delusional — but we also want you to have your own space if you need to get away or be alone.”
“We can ask her if there’s anything else to be done.”
Harry watches as Draco strips off his clothes and joins him in the bed. He snuggles into Draco’s side as an arm comes around him.
Harry groans softly as his sleep-addled brain starts slotting everything into place. It’s Halloween. CRMM is closed for Halloween and the day after, which happens to be a Thursday and Friday this year, to allow their employees to attend the festivities. But the holiday holds a much darker meaning for Harry.
Healer Powell moves quietly out of the room, followed by the Mediwizards, and then Draco’s lips are on Harry’s forehead.
Harry swallows. “That’d be great; I’ll just pop this in the player.” Harry puts the wine down on the table and busies himself with the DVD player while Draco shelves the movies.
to grow a healthy baby.
“I’ll be right back with your water and a basin. We’ll get some more sleep and maybe things will look better in a couple of hours.”
Wands working diligently, old furniture is shrunk and put into a guest room, painting charms are set loose on the walls, and the new furniture is resized and put into place. Draco carefully uses sticking charms to hang their new decor, and Harry fits their new sheets and duvet to the bed.
Harry looks to James and Matthew, who are standing hand-in-hand on Harry's side of the bed.
The dildo stops, buried deep inside him, and Harry hears a moan behind him, combined with the sound of Draco taking himself in his lubed hand at a frantic speed. Before long, Harry feels a hot splash against his arse as Draco cums on him.
“I love you.”
“Regulus Etamin Potter.” Draco rolls the name over his tongue, words thick with emotion. “You certainly are our brightest star.”
“Why in Merlin’s name would you call your electronics shop the same thing as an Indian dish?” Draco chuckles. “Muggles are weird.”
“It’s ok. You were working.” Draco doesn’t sound at all irritated and Harry is hopeful that Draco isn’t upset. “Does something sound good for dinner?”
Harry cracks open an eye.
“Arms up,” Draco says softly and Harry immediately obeys. He hears his shirt softly fall to the floor and stares up as Draco removes his own. Merlin, he cannot get enough of looking at this man. He takes in Draco’s pale, muscled torso. He’s not broad, but he’s solid and Harry finds him absolutely gorgeous.
“I love you, too. And I’ll take that bed now.”
“I’ve got more energy this week. Healer Carr said it happens in the second trimester sometimes. I’m thankful for it. I’m really tired of being exhausted.”
Harry feels himself sway as the world inverts and an arm is immediately tight around his waist. He finds himself leaning on James’ shoulder.
Draco’s hand slides over Harry’s abdomen and almost immediately, there’s another flutter.
Harry carefully picks up the ring and slides it onto Draco’s finger, feeling their magic pulsate through it.
“I feel like if I don’t, I’m just prolonging the inevitable. It’s what we both want. and I’m not planning to be away from you overnight any time soon.” Draco hands Harry the last of the dishes. “It’ll be trickier over the holiday with the kids.”
Healer Powell waves his wand and two oddly shaped supports appear on either side of the bed. Harry knows from his reading that he’s expected to put his calves in them, basically spreading his arse for display. They’re different than the ones for witches, in order to tip his pelvis for a better exit path for the baby.
“Thanks, Dad.” James hugs Harry tightly and then, after just a moment of hesitation, wraps his arms around Draco and hugs him, too. “Thanks, Draco.”
“Yes. Merlin, yes.”
“That’s a bit of an understatement.” Harry chuckles again.
He turns to find Draco standing at the top of the stairs, looking immaculate in his deep ruby dress robes and Harry momentarily forgets to breathe.
Draco is completely enraged and swiftly lifts his wand, murmuring a summoning spell.
Harry drifts into consciousness and stretches one arm to the other side of the bed, eyes still closed. His hand finds a warm thigh and there’s a gentle chuckle. Since Monday, he and Draco haven’t spent a night apart. Nothing has been said since that first night Harry asked him to stay — it's just become how it is.
“My concern is about tuition.” Matthew is staring at the bedcovers, obviously uncomfortable. “I’d like to get a job this summer so I can start saving, but I’m not sure two summers worth of work will be enough. I might have to take a gap year to work and save more.”
“That gives us three days. I’m sure we can get some wedding robes tailored by then.”
“Fuck.” Draco voices what both of them are thinking.
“Merlin’s balls!” James shouts, then Harry’s arms are full of his eldest son and he’s being squeezed in a bone-crushing hug.
“That sounds like a good idea to me.”
“Maybe it is.”
In that moment, Harry is sure he’ll never find something as much of a turn on as Draco’s heated gaze and his gentle prompting for consent.
“No. I work with very intricate magical imaging and I’ve never had an issue.”
“The nausea from this will pass. It’s just your womb displacing your other organs.”
“Good morning, Mr Malfoy. Hello, Mr Potter. Welcome to CRMM. Mr Mason is ready for you; right this way.”
“I’ll be happy to do that for you. What’s on your mind?”
He realises he’s through three chapters with no sign of Draco. Deciding he probably shouldn’t leave Draco to the wolves that are their inquisitive children, he sets his book aside and throws back the blankets.
They’ll all head back to Hogwarts in two days’ time and Harry knows he’ll miss the noise and the life the five of them bring to the house. It really won’t be terribly long before they’re home for the summer, though.
“I am really not looking forward to going back to work tomorrow,” Draco says as he organises his sweaters in his new dresser.
“I’m fine,” Harry states firmly, even though he knows his voice clearly says the opposite. He shoots another glare at the clerk over Draco’s shoulder.
Draco huffs a laugh. Harry turns his head to the side and opens one eye to look at Draco, who is sitting to Harry’s side, one hand on the small of Harry’s back.
“You’re okay now?” James is still studying him carefully. “Why don’t you sit down?”
“Mina let me borrow a movie! She said it’s really good!”
“Well aren’t you a pretty one.” Harry lifts the tag attached to the owl’s leather harness before turning his attention to the parchment tied to the beautiful owl’s leg. “Hello there, Pyxis. What have you got for me?”
And when it finally does, he squints into the bright lights that assault his regained vision until a figure obstructs the light. Draco. That platinum blond couldn’t belong to anyone else.
“Everything preliminary looks good. Shall we do some imaging, then?” Healer Carr spreads the imaging potion over Harry’s belly and conjures her bubble. As soon as her wand touches his abdomen, there’s a tiny, wiggly baby visible.
“It seems so surreal that we’re doing this. Like I’m living some kind of dream.” Harry looks over the large section of furniture. “Do you see anything you like?”
Harry immediately flops onto the couch after they land at home late that afternoon.
“Yeah,” Harry agrees, “I was wanting to talk to you about that. I think we might need to find Al a Mind Healer. His anxiety is getting worse, and I think we’re at the point where he may need a potion. It’s not fair for him to be that upset all the time.”
Harry surveys the room from where he’s curled up with Draco on the couch. Matthew and James are on the other couch, also wrapped up in each other as they watch the movie. Lily is sprawled in the overstuffed armchair, texting with Mina. Scorp and Al are laying on the floor, playing wizard’s chess.
Draco helps him shift, sitting behind him as a support, and Harry lays against him, legs in the supports, splayed open. Healer Powell slides his hand in and it takes all Harry’s self-control not to kick the man in the face. Everything is already so tender, so sore, he has no idea how he will manage to push a baby out.
Silver eyes are suddenly mostly black with arousal and Harry catches Draco’s whispered “fuck” before he answers.
“Shit, Draco. I’m sorry.” Harry locks the lab and touches Draco’s hip gently as they turn for the elevators. He hadn’t meant to make Draco wait on him; he’d just been so focused on his work, he hadn’t wanted to quit.
“Hermione…”
“I thought he was going home,” Lily asserts, sounding confused.
“Have you started doing any research on male pregnancy?” Hermione leans forward eagerly and Harry shakes his head.
Harry shifts uncomfortably in his seat. “I’ve never really gone into detail about it with the kids. They were four and two when it happened. Albus has no memories of the Weasleys or his mum. James has a few spotty memories of them, but he knows that there was a disagreement and we went separate ways.” Harry feels Malfoy’s concerned eyes watching him as he fiddles with his cup. “If they asked, I’d explain further. If they expressed a desire to see them, we would discuss it. I don’t want to add that emotional weight to what they already handle. The kids and I, we have a very open relationship and talk pretty freely about everything, but I also don’t see the need to put that burden on them.”
The scene on the kitchen table is based on this brilliant art by anokaba.
Harry laughs. Even before he was pregnant, Draco was incredibly protective and more than a little jealous of anyone else who tried to win his affections.
“Okay, son. Matthew is here for the remainder of these two weeks, at the very least. He
“Somewhere Muggle. We both decided we don’t want to get papped on our first proper date.” Harry rolls his eyes. Hermione mutters something about stupid beetles and nosy reporters as she begins rifling through Harry’s clothes.
“Do you think you can get this down?” Draco’s voice is close and Harry opens an eye to find him right there. Anti-nausea potions are, on the whole, disgusting in taste, and he’s not sure he can swallow it and make it stay put. “It’s not as vile as store-bought. I brewed it myself.”
Draco nods and kisses Harry’s forehead before heading down the stairs. No sooner has Harry undressed and slipped under the covers again than Healer Carr bustles in.
“Yeah.” James looks up at his dad and a smile quirks at the corners of his mouth. “It’s just different to see you with a man.”
to course through Draco’s. He wants to be bonded to him in every possible manner.
“You should see some of it abate when you’re spending more time laying down and reclining. You can also use some of the mild pain potions in the Pregnancy Potions Manual I gave Mr Malfoy. No more than four doses a day.”
“Oh, thank Merlin.” Draco’s voice is barely a whisper and laced with a mix of relief and fear.
There’s a hand on Harry’s back and he turns to see Albus, with Scorpius just behind already wrapped in Draco’s arms. Harry draws his younger son into a tight hug.
“Al, I want to talk to you about your worrying.”
“You absolutely do not!” Draco sinks back into the chair. “I’m sorry, Harry. I know it’s going to be hard for you.”
Draco scoffs. “I am
Harry unties the parchment from Cupcake’s leg, retrieves some owl treats, and makes sure there’s water in the bowl by the perch. Sliding his empty dinner plate aside, Harry unfurls the parchment to see Lily’s favourite glitter ink scrawled across the page.
“You’re not misinterpreting.”
Hermione snorts. “Did she actually say that?”
“I love you, too, Harry.”
“Maybe?” Draco runs his hands down the page to Leo, studying the stars within. “What about Regulus? ‘The star that stands at the lion’s breast.’ The heart of the lion, brightest star in Leo.”
“Nice and clear.” Healer Powell’s voice penetrates the fog of pain. Someone must have vanished the fluid because the bed beneath him is suddenly dry again.
“He’s a great kid. Scorpius said he was really upset. I thought maybe he was being overly dramatic, but you do seem quite disconcerted.” Malfoy scrutinizes Harry, eyes intense.
“You okay?” Draco murmurs in his ear.
Once in the bedroom, Harry turns to Draco and smiles ruefully. “I feel ridiculous. I want you here, but I’m so nervous. And I don’t even know why.”
Harry looks at Malfoy’s face. His remorse is evident, but Harry can’t decide if he should disclose the situation with the Weasleys. He’d worked tirelessly to keep it out of the press in that year after Ginny had died. No one knew beyond himself, the Weasleys, and Hermione.
The two men find their arms full of all four of their kids.
Matthew’s eyes grow to the size of dinner plates.
Harry smoothes his ruby red dress robes over his abdomen and looks himself over in the mirror. Even heavily pregnant, the robes fit him perfectly. Of course, they do. As if Draco would have had ill-fitting robes for their wedding, no matter how small.
as Draco opens a phial of potion.
“I’m going to assume you know more about where to find good furniture than I do.” Harry has no idea what would be best and Draco clearly has an eye for the finer things in life. “Hermione helped me pick out what I have now.”
“Excellent. I’ll open the Floo for you. I’ll be out as soon as I’m ready.” Draco flashes another smile and moves to stand up.
“Fuck.”
He tips over the edge and everything happens at once. His cock spurts thick white streams on the sheets, his ears are ringing, he feels like he’s free-falling, and he’s shouting Draco’s name. The dildo keeps going, wrenching every bit of Harry’s orgasm from him.
Harry beams at the letter through the twisting of his heart. His sweet Lily is a Gryffindor. His last baby is at Hogwarts. He won’t have a child at home year-round ever again. He shakes his head at the request for her sparkle quills, though, knowing it is much more likely that Lily couldn’t
“I’m so glad.” Harry is flooded with relief, knowing exactly what Al’s cryptic bit of communication means. They’ll talk about it more at home, of course. He passes them both to Draco, who wraps his arms around both boys.
“I’m not going to last very long,” he whispers into Draco’s neck.
“I’m ready to be happy again. To share my life with someone. Maybe even to be loved by someone again.” Harry watches Hermione’s eyes spill over, and one lone tear rolls down each cheek. “And since I think Draco might be that someone, I really don’t want to fuck this up.”
“People like all kinds of things, I suppose.” Harry shrugs. “Do you have preferences for penetration?”
Hermione rolls her eyes. “Well aren’t you two just sickeningly sweet.”
All four kids nod dutifully. Harry’s kids are used to the press by this point and know the drill.
Draco snaps Harry from his reverie. “Is that a pitch down the hill?”
Harry stares at Malfoy, baffled. Why in Merlin’s name would Draco Malfoy want to have tea with
Harry blindly offers his hand to the Mediwizard next to him, who guides his hand between his legs, placing it on something warm and wet and sticky.
“Good afternoon, gentlemen.” Healer Carr greets them and immediately conjures her table and begins to unpack. “How are you feeling, Mr Potter?”
Harry groans as he lifts a leg, but at this point, he doesn’t even care if the Healer sticks a whole hand in. He’s just uncomfortable and wants to know if Regulus is okay and if they can make the pain lessen. Healer Carr’s fingers press and twist inside, her other hand moving to apply pressure in various places.
“You’ll get there. Don’t be in a hurry.”
“That was five hours ago. You can have more.” Draco’s hands still against his back. “What about a warm bath? You can take a dose and we can get in the tub and see if the water helps.”
Draco complies and Harry slides his arms between Draco’s legs, carefully cradling a thigh in each elbow. Draco stretches out on the tabletop, reaching for the far side of the table and Harry lifts Draco’s knees onto the polished wood surface. He kisses down the curve of Draco’s perfect arse, trying to settle both his nerves and his excitement. Draco takes a deep breath, wrapping his hands around the far edge of the table and pushing his arse gently against Harry’s lips.
“You certainly showed your knowledge, James. Are you thinking more about Healer Training?”
“Sometimes Hermione pops by to check on me on Halloween. And…well…”
Harry’s actually a little relieved. He honestly figured it had been more by this point, but he still wants to make sure that James is remembering what he’s been told before, regarding comfort and consent.
“Me either!” James’ eyes are wide. “Dad, I don’t want to have a baby. Not for a long time. I guess I just sort of…pretended it couldn’t happen, but then you’re pregnant and…”
“I’m going to be fine, love. Can you go get Martin and Warren from the Curse-Breaking team next to my lab? And my blue notebook from my lab station. And some of your binding potion.”
“It was fine,” Scorpius reports with a smile.
“Oh.” Well, at least he wasn’t wrong about the contact thing. Although, Draco’s words still leave more questions than answers. “I wonder what she wants, then.”
“Thank you for coming in, Harry,” Mr Mason says enthusiastically. “I look forward to having you on our team. I’ll see you next week.”
“Draco?” he calls softly.
“I’ve seen it before, and honestly I was kind of on edge. I was trying to figure out how he feels and I just couldn’t be sure.” Harry puts his elbows on the table with a dull thud and his head in his hands once again. “I feel like I’m sixteen again, Hermione. This is ridiculous.”
“They are. I’m glad they’re good for you, too. You’ll come talk to me if that changes, yeah?”
“A king-size bed and two nightstands to start with.” Harry pauses to think. “Either one large dresser or two small ones. And two wizarding wardrobes with good extension charms.” Harry looks to Draco. “Is there anything else you think we need, love?”
Harry is suddenly wrapped in Draco’s arms and they’re chest to chest and Draco is kissing him deeply. “Fuck, Harry,” he breathes, pulling back just enough to speak. “This feels like a dream.”
Draco sinks to his knees and wraps hands around Harry’s hips, turning him around to face the tiled wall. Harry rests his head against the tile as Draco nudges his legs further apart. His hands slide to the globes of Harry’s arse and squeeze just hard enough to make him jump.
“I wouldn’t do that to him, Dad.”
“Place this ring on the fourth finger of his left hand and repeat after me: Please accept this ring as an outward symbol of our bond. With this ring, I thee wed.”
“That suits me just fine.” Matthew smiles at James. Harry knows they’re only sixteen, but he really does hope their happiness lasts. They seem very much in love and in a mature relationship.
They’ve spent the last five days with the CRMM team and the St Mungo’s staff, putting together a plan to try to remove the malevolent magic from Harry’s core without harming him or the baby. There have been many hours in the simulation lab running through the procedure. Tomorrow — well, later this morning — they’re set to perform the procedure on Harry.
“Vultures. All of them,” Harry mutters, re-evaluating his stance on the hexing. Draco snorts and they make their way down the sidewalk to the Apothecary. Harry again wishes that he could just enjoy his life without this madness. But he’s determined not to let the press and the public steal their happiness, so he leans close into Draco and focuses instead on enjoying a day out with the man he loves.
Harry turns to lead Draco into the house. “It has to be. Even twenty years on from the war, there are still people who want to find my house, or me, or my kids. Some for completely harmless purposes, but others…”
Harry watches Malfoy’s face go from surprise to comprehension to something Harry can’t quite identify.
Harry’s own throat catches and instead of trying to form words, he simply kisses Draco. Slow and lazy, they drink each other in, both relieved to be home with their baby safe.
“Thank you. That was really neat!” James grins at the Healer, then at Harry and Draco.
“All right, come sit for a minute and then we’ll figure out what kind of takeaway we want for dinner.”
Draco helps Harry into his jacket and kisses him on the cheek. “Are you ready to go home?”
“I agree.” Draco reaches out and touches Harry’s cheek. “Would you like to take a walk? Maybe ride the Eye?”
“You were the first person I thought of when my boss mentioned they were ready to hire in a hybrid of Dark Magic experts and Curse-Breakers,” Draco says, making warmth pool in Harry’s belly. Knowing Draco thinks that highly of him is a little shocking. “I just wasn’t sure if you’d be interested until you mentioned working with Dark Magic today.”
“Of course. Do you want to come through?” Draco gestures to his sitting room, “I’ll need to make myself presentable, but I can be ready to go in about twenty minutes.”
The adoring look in Draco’s eyes nearly melts him. “You want me to stay?”
“We also talked about the kids and about how I’m trying to figure out what to do with myself, now that Lily has gone to Hogwarts.” Harry frowns slightly, thinking about his empty house. “He encouraged me to find something that gives me purpose and he didn’t push me towards what people would expect. I appreciated that.”
Rolling his eyes at himself, he picks up his quill and begins to write.
“He came over here?” Hermione’s voice is back to carefully controlled. She reaches over and gently tugs at one of his arms, urging him to look at her and stop pulling at his curls, now speckled with grey.
“I’m actually feeling pretty good. Less pain after a couple of days taking it easy.”
“Yeah?” He smiles down at Draco, who looks quite excited.
He doesn’t open them again until he hears the doorknob turn. He pushes himself up to sitting as all four kids are ushered in in front of Draco.
“Al’s crying — like, really crying — in his room. He wouldn’t let me in.”
James slips into the room and shuts the door before climbing onto the end of the bed.
“I guess we are.” Harry shrugs with a smirk. His face sobers as he looks at Draco. “Do you not want to stay?”
“I love you, too.” Harry watches Draco cross the room and slip out the door before burrowing down into his pillow and closing his eyes.
“No, Harry. You really don’t look good. I can take the kids; it will be fine.” Draco’s voice is sympathetic but firm, and Harry knows he’s right. There’s no way he could handle Apparating right now, and he’s not entirely sure he could stand on the platform long enough to see them off.
“Fuck!” Draco shouts and Harry pulls back, startled and wondering what could be wrong. Draco hisses at the loss of contact. “Salazar, don’t stop!”
“I went back to sleep until the potion wore off and it immediately started again. It’s like being hit by a bludger.”
Harry nods in agreement. “I’m glad we’re here now.”
“Have you had successful trials?”
“I’m happy, too. Happier than I even thought I’d be, romantically speaking.”
“Perfect.” Harry curses his pregnancy hormones as his eyes well up. “It’s perfect.”
“I still miss him— the old him,” Harry confesses. “I’ve thought about reaching out now that the kids are all off at Hogwarts. Just to see if he wants to talk.”
“Absolutely.”
“Any other questions?” Draco prompts.
“Are you really going to be okay? You and the baby?”
“Is that a benefit or a liability for your mother?”
“Show off,” Draco teases.
Hands spread his arse wide, and Draco’s tongue moves in short, rough strokes around his entrance. Nonsense falls from Harry’s lips. He’s not sure if it’s because it’s been a month since Draco has touched him like this or heightened sensitivity from being pregnant, but every lap of Draco’s tongue sets his body on fire. He keens when short strokes are exchanged for long firm ones, coaxing his hole to open.
“Let’s go, then.” Draco tugs Harry’s hand, helping him up from the couch. Once he’s on his feet, Draco affectionately holds his bump on both sides.
And then there’s another wave of discomfort rushing over him as his back protests having Regulus’ weight suspended from his spine.
“He won’t think of me any differently, and it’s nice to have someone at school to talk to about it.” Al moves to set his potions case on his bedside table. “I know I’ve written to you several times, but it helps to have Scorpius.”
“Ok, let me tell you what’s going on and then you can ask any questions. I’ll be as honest as I can with you, as always.” Harry glances over at Draco. “I know the four of you know that Draco and I got to know each other better after you all headed off to Hogwarts. What you don’t know is that we’ve found that we enjoy each others’ company romantically, as well, and that we’re in a relationship.” Harry watches the children's eyes go wide as he reaches over and squeezes Draco’s hand. He can’t help but chuckle a little at Lily, who is bouncing excitedly. Clearly she is not upset by this development.
Harry places his hand over the spot he’d shown Draco earlier.
“I love you, too. I’ll stay until you’re asleep, and I’ll be with you before they wake you up, ok?”
“But he did this thing when I asked him to taste the sauce. Instead of just taking the spoon, he put his hand over mine and then put the spoon in his mouth.” Harry feels his face flush and he can’t keep the smile off his face. “He said it was perfect and that he wouldn’t change a thing, but the way he said it, I’m not sure if he meant the sauce or
“…yes,” Harry breathes and the dam breaks and the words just tumble out. “I understand if you don’t feel the same way. It’s been a long time since I had to deal with this kind of situation and sometimes I think you might reciprocate those feelings, but I can never quite tell and I was afraid I might be misinterpreting and—“
“Scorp and I wondered if it might happen,” Al confesses. “You seemed like you might go well together. I’m ok with it.”
“That, too.”
“They better stay back. I will hex anyone that touches you.” Draco glowers through the window at the masses.
“First off, we know he’s a carrier, and he’s in his first serious relationship. I’m pretty sure he and Matthew are going to be having penetrative sex soon if they aren’t already. He’s going to find out his dad is unintentionally pregnant. Teenage boys don’t usually have to worry about getting pregnant. I want to make sure he knows how to prevent pregnancy until he’s ready.” Harry shakes his head. “He’s also gay and about to find out way more about his father’s bedroom preferences with men than he probably wants to know.”
“Come around here, James.” James scrambles off the bed as Healer Carr smiles and siphons the potion off Harry’s belly.
“You’ve expressed your desire to be a Potter in name. Is that still your choice?” Harry asks.
“No, it hasn’t. It’s always been pretty high.” Harry’s been told, repeatedly, that he has abnormally high magic levels. “There are records with the Ministry Healers from when I was an Auror.”
Draco’s eyes have turned bright with what Harry suspects is unshed tears. Harry places his free hand over the top of Draco’s hand. “I know. You couldn’t have known. It just kind of hit me like a bludger when I put it all together.” Harry is torn between being angry at Voldemort and his endless cruelty and wanting to forge ahead and make sure no one else suffers the same fate as Ginny.
Draco places a knee on either side of Harry’s hips and leans forward, leaving a trail of kisses from behind his ear and down his throat. Firm hands stroke down over his soft t-shirt and dip under, sliding it up. Lips gently suck in the curve of his neck, and Harry jumps when Draco softly pinches and rolls his nipples beneath his shirt.
“Harry? Is something wrong?”
Lily extends her hand and Harry places it low on the small swell of his abdomen. “Okay, press down lightly.” He feels her push softly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, someday. Matthew and I were talking, and he said that was one of the hardest parts of coming to terms with his sexuality. He realised he couldn’t have biological kids with his partner because he’s gay. Not a lot of wizards can carry and not many of the ones who can are gay. I’m lucky. I can have a family with my partner, and I want that someday.”
Hermione’s face finally gives way to a smile. “I think it’s wonderful. Congratulations!”
“Well, no. We took a walk down to the pitch when dinner was in the oven. I gave him a locker and he said we should play a Seekers’ game next time. Turns out he’s a Puddlemere supporter, too.” Harry chuckles again. “And we chatted over dinner. He’s quite easy to talk to. He truly understands what it’s like being a single father. I’ve never had someone who really gets that, you know?”
“Oh, it’ll fit in the space I want to put it, all right” Draco mutters quietly, eyes glimmering mischievously.
Forty-five minutes later, Harry shakes Mr Mason’s hand at the door to his office.
Hermione rolls her eyes as Harry wordlessly summons the pumpkin juice from the cooling cupboard. They sit in easy silence as they both fill their plates, Hermione smothering her pancakes in berries and Harry drowning his in syrup.
“How are the four of you feeling about this?”
“I thought I was being met by the new Department Head?” Harry lilts his statement into a question.
“They are.” His voice is unsteady, and James puts an arm around his waist in support.
“We’ve literally known less than four hours. We really only know what Healer Carr has told us.”
Harry sighs and moves back again. “I’m happy to help,” he states, trying to put a note of finality in his voice. He eases himself back in the direction of his own station when Claire reaches out and puts her hand on his arm.
Harry guides Draco to the bed and turns down the duvet and sheets. They slide in from either side and meet in the middle, immediately becoming a tangle of tongues and arms and legs. Draco moans softly into Harry’s mouth and Harry is lost to the kiss. The only thing he’s aware of is Draco’s skin against his and the hardness of Draco’s erection when it brushes against his hip.
“She’s fine with the kids coming Friday.”
“I don’t suppose it will.” Harry reaches up on the back of the couch and grabs the blanket he keeps there. Spreading it over them, Harry settles against Draco’s chest and closes his eyes as Draco’s strong arms slide around to hold him. He can’t remember the last time he felt this content.
Thrusts become erratic and Harry watches his fiancé’s mouth open in a silent scream as his cock jerks and spurts and fills him. The weight of Draco’s body against him grounds him as they both come down from their high.
“I think we should bring all four kids back here,” Draco says slowly. “Scorpius is already familiar with you and the house, and this is where we’re planning to spend the break.”
“You’re quite welcome. And if you think I look good, you should see Matthew. Dad, he looks amazing.”
“You’re already our brother,” Al assures him. “It’ll be great to have you as a Potter, too.”
Harry watches as Draco pulls out sandwiches and crisps and fruit and slowly becomes more lost for words. Everything — down to the flavour of crisps — is something Harry’s eaten in front of Draco before.
“I’m not.”
“Of course we are!” James laughs. “Did you think we’d be upset?”
offer to take your co-workers to lunch for giving you a second opinion on a spell?” Draco quirks an eyebrow at Harry. There’s clearly something here Harry is missing.
When Harry can’t walk through the pain anymore, they return to the house. Draco’s soft hands and smooth voice never waiver, supporting his husband through every pain. He feels like he’s literally being ripped in half every time a contraction hits, but he clings to Draco — to his voice, to his touch — to help him through.
“You don’t do magic at home?”
“But it worked!”
“I’ll see what she says.”
One fingertip slides in and Harry's mind goes back to the recollection of Draco's slender digit nudging inside him in his dream. Harry moves his finger in sync with his imagined lover's, pulling back out just to move in deeper again.
“Well, whilst I was helping the two boys put together Scorp’s new room, Scorp informed me that he and Al both think our relationship is great and that they like that we’re together.”
They walk around the pitch, simply making laps, and pause when Healer Carr arrives for a check. Harry again feels ridiculous, with her reaching under his gown there in the outdoors, but he’s progressed and that’s what really matters.
“We are,” Draco chuckles, pushing himself to stand and offering Harry his hand. Harry reaches up and takes the proffered hand and is pulled to his feet. He’s immediately engulfed in a tight hug and for several long moments, they just stand there, pressed together, basking in the knowledge that their forever officially begins tonight.
“If you’re not ready, it’s—“
“I think I’d like that.” Harry’s heart flutters picturing a ring like that on his finger. He knows that everyone will be aware of their relationship after today, but some part of him is anxious for the world to know that this is serious, and not the fling the papers will surely paint it as.
Harry groans loudly and puts his head in his hands again. “I don’t remember how to do this. How do you do this as an actual adult?! How do
“Everything there looks good, gentlemen. This appears to be a healthy and viable pregnancy. You’re due around 22 August.” The potion is siphoned off Harry’s abdomen. “You have the option to terminate for about six more weeks. Am I correct in my assumption that you wish to decline that option?”
“Not everyone is okay with people being gay. Or bi, for that matter. Some people believe that it’s a choice, not just how someone is.”
“Who?” Harry asks, confused.
“Soon. We want it over with before the kids come home for Easter. I’m pretty close to not being able to hide it, even in robes. I’m already having to be selective in what I wear if we go out.” Harry sighs. “I do wish we could just have our family business be
Harry drifts halfway into consciousness the next morning and his sleep-addled brain wonders, blearily, which of the kids had climbed into his bed last night. He cracks his eyes open and the blond head next to him certainly doesn’t belong to any of the kids. As the haze of sleep lifts fully from him, the previous night comes flooding back and he smiles contentedly
“I know. But you’re happy, right?”
“Oh, Harry, don’t be silly. You’re very experienced with Dark Magic.” Claire puts her hand on Harry’s shoulder and gazes at him.
“Nothing in particular; I’ve just gotten a little spoiled this weekend with the
Hermione is seated in the living room, surrounded by all five kids.
Harry looks over to see Scorpius cradling Regulus in his arms. He looks fit to burst, grinning down at his baby brother.
“Ask away, Lil. I’ll be as honest as I can.”
Harry reaches into the cooling cupboard and hands James a bag of grapes.
“That’s the goal.” Harry smiles. Maybe he
Draco emerges from the pantry with a case of butterbeer just as Hermione steps through the flames. Harry winks at him before he moves to hug Hermione hello.
“Draco, you don’t have to…”
“That’s fair. Anything we try, Draco, you can say no to. I want you to feel good.”
“I am so glad they’re home. I love having our house full of our kids, all of us together.”
Harry pulls back and watches Draco’s face.
“Can I talk to you?” He pauses. “And Draco? Alone?”
“Did you pressure him to come out?” Draco asks, voice carefully level.
“Let’s just wait for them to notice.” Draco grins and waves his left hand in front of Harry’s face.
“Then Draco and I will support you and your partner through making some difficult decisions.” Harry knows he will always support their kids, all five of them, but thinking about James getting pregnant makes his gut twist. “But I would really rather not end up there.”
“Get pregnant?” Draco clarifies.
Draco reaches for a parchment containing a diagram of the Potter family tree. “Let’s see what’s in your family.”
! Faster!” he begs, nearly sobbing as the dildo pounds his prostate with every stroke.
A bizarre look crosses Hermione’s face and Harry looks at her askance. She shakes her head almost imperceptibly and Harry narrows his eyebrows in return before raising them expectantly. Hermione huffs.
.” Disbelief laces the statement.
“Mmm,” Draco hums in satisfaction. “There it is.”
“Give him a moment, James. The world will steady itself and he’ll be right as rain,” Draco says softly.
“Harry and Draco, I cannot express what a privilege it is to bond the two of you as husbands. While you’ve chosen a simple ceremony, the bond you have chosen is strong. It will entwine your magic, your souls, and your love for the rest of eternity.
“Yes. It doesn’t last long but it’s awful.” Harry straightens and takes Draco’s hand. “Lunch?”
“I’m so glad we found our way to each other, Draco.”
“How long was I out?”
Harry notices that Blaise has eased himself away as the train is pulling in and he’s grateful for that bit of privacy. This will be nerve-wracking enough without an additional audience.
“Hurts!” he hisses.
“With me?”
“But they’re still both okay?” Draco’s concern hasn’t abated much.
“Do you want to go back?” Draco’s tone is carefully controlled, and Harry knows that means he’s not happy about the prospect.
“He’s stable now.”
“I think seeing what we like is a fine idea.”
Suddenly there’s a weight in his lap, and he lifts his head to find Lily curling up there. She’s always been his snugglebug, and he’s missed holding her. She’s the only one of his children that still sits on his lap. He wraps his arms around her and holds her for a moment before he breaks the silence.
Harry wraps a leg around Draco and gently urges him to keep pressing in. Harry has never felt so full and he carefully schools his face to keep the discomfort from being obvious. Draco slowly rocks, just a little at a time, and inches forward. Harry can focus on nothing but Draco’s tongue in his mouth and his cock splitting him in two. He finally feels the brush of Draco’s balls against his arse.
Harry moves in front of Draco and takes both of Draco’s hands in his own, eyes locked on to Draco’s beautiful silver orbs.
“You have nothing to be sorry for,” Draco says firmly, “but I’d be very happy if I'd never have to see you that shade of white again.”
“Looks like an ugly tree stump. Has thorn-covered vines hidden inside. Never handle alone, always with two or more people. Pulsating pods are about the size of a grapefruit.”
Both older men hug Matthew, and Harry notices Draco speaking softly into his ear.
“Yeah.” Al’s voice is strained. Harry opens the door to find his son sitting cross-legged in the middle of the bed, eyes red and face streaked with tears.
to hide their budding relationship. Sometimes it really sucks being Harry Potter.
“And was Matthew?”
Healer Carr freezes the image in the bubble with a view of Regulus’ whole body.
Lily reaches him first, arms outstretched for a hug.
“I think you’re right. He’s written to me four times in the three days I’ve been home.” Harry knows his son worries, but Al’s been particularly anxious over Harry recently. All the kids know right now is that Harry has been ill and admitted to St Mungo’s for a week. He can’t decide if it will be better or worse once Al knows he’s pregnant. “Next weekend, then?”
“No, she’s a Ravenclaw, like her mum.” Blaise shakes his head. “She’s very bright, but she doesn’t have a cunning bone in her body.”
“Thank you.” James looks incredibly relieved at Draco’s words.
“Come in!” Draco calls, and the door bursts open, their children spilling into the room. Lily gasps the instant she spots Regulus.
“That’s something you definitely have lacked, someone who can relate to that intimately.” She smiles supportively. “Go on.”
“He did, Lil. But Matthew decided it was time to tell his parents that he’s gay, and it did not go well.”
Harry pillows his head on his arms, face to the mirror, and watches. Watches Draco’s finger disappear into his body. Watches one finger become two. Watches them scissor and stretch and press deeper. Watches Draco’s neglected cock twitch and leak.
“Yeah. I’m still tired and feel a little gross, but I’m not nauseated.”
Draco’s smirk is absolutely lascivious.
“With a cock?” Draco clarifies.
“Are you hungry?” Draco gestures to the counter. “There’s plenty.”
to put a label on it?”
“Believe me, I’ve thought about it.”
“Yeah.” Harry looks around, taking in the empty platform. How long had he been standing there, gazing at the spot where Lily had been waving before the train pulled away? “Are we the only ones left?”
“Tell me about what you like?” Harry asks, cuddling closer to Draco and feeling Draco hold him just a little bit tighter.
“Let’s see where you are before the next one comes,” Healer Powell encourages gently.
“Oh, that’s their Hogwarts Houses. Black means they went elsewhere, but otherwise, colours correspond to their sorted House.”
Harry’s hands wander from Draco’s hips to under his t-shirt, and he slides it up over Draco’s head before Draco shrugs the rest of the way out of it. Harry takes in Draco’s chest up close, tracing one finger down the single thin white scar from just below Draco’s right collar bone across to his left nipple. It’s nearly invisible unless you’re up close, but it’s there, and Harry can’t help but feel ashamed that he’s the one responsible for marring Draco’s body.
“Hello, Matthew.” Harry smiles at the young man who looks rather nervous. “I hope we’ll see you over the holiday?”
“I’ll Apparate to my flat, get what I need, and pick up some dinner.” Draco looks Harry over as they step into the elevator.
Draco is suddenly right next to him and far more alert. “What’s wrong? Are you nauseous again?”
“Of course,” Bernice smiles.
“Why can’t you Side-Along?” Al asks.
“Not necessarily.” Harry shakes his head. “You’ll have trouble using it in magic spaces if it’s not, but magic won’t hurt it. They’re much easier to ward than a telly, though. I warded mine and the boys’ myself after Hermione showed me how.”
Harry runs his hands through his hair. “I’m sorry. I’m fine. It’s just…” Harry trails off.
“Is it serious?”
“Pardon?” Healer Powell looks blindsided. Harry sees Draco sit up in horror, obviously having caught on to Harry’s train of thought.
“Ready, gentlemen?”
“Are you really going to be all right?” Hermione’s concerned look tugs at his emotions. She’s seen him through a lot of shite and has been the only one to worry about him for a long time. He’s oddly glad to have her concern now.
Both boys nod.
“At what, exactly?” Harry settles closer to Draco’s chest and laces his fingers through Draco’s hand.
“I love you, too, son.” Harry watches the door snick closed behind James and sighs.
“Hmmm,” Draco intones thoughtfully. Several moments of silence pass before he speaks again. “Would you consider working at CRMM?”
“Have you
bedroom.
“Is she still coming this morning?”
and begins leafing through the pages. In an effort to combat the boredom from not working, he’s been searching for baby name ideas that are just right for this child that is a combination of the two of them. Something celestial would certainly honour Draco as a parent.
“Agreed, and not just because he’s James’ boyfriend.”
Fuck, he’s never watched like this, watched Draco’s cock sink into his arse. He moans from both the feeling of being filled and from seeing it happen. Draco’s balls brush his arse and hands come around to hold his swollen belly.
The kids and Draco head for the door. “James,” Harry calls softly, “come here for a minute.”
“I have. I never got to travel as a child, so it’s been an adventure for all of us. It’s also brought us closer together,” Harry smiles at the memories. “As I said over dinner, we’re close and have a really open relationship. My kids all know they can talk to me about anything, and I want it to stay that way.”
Harry smiles. He knows that’s partially for his benefit so he won’t be lonely, and partially for Draco’s benefit, so he can see that Harry is okay.
He reaches for his mobile.
Harry shifts again. “Is that what causes the pressure?”
“Draco?” Harry speaks softly into his fiancé’s ear.
“More, Draco.
Draco’s eyes are bright, and Harry feels his own eyes well up. Draco drops one of Harry’s hands and cups his cheek tenderly. He is nearly overwhelmed by the emotion in those beautiful grey eyes.
“Scorp?” Harry questions.
Midway through turning a page, he gasps.
“Oh, Harry.” She shakes her head. “You’ve really worked yourself into a state, haven’t you?”
“What do you think, little one?” Draco puts his hands on Harry’s hips, speaking to the bump. “Would you like to be Regulus Etamin? The brightest spot for both your daddies in a very long time?”
Draco relieves the owl of its paper and hands it over to Harry before joining him back in bed. The Sunday morning Prophet does not disappoint. Under the headline “Potter and Malfoy to Wed!” is a full-colour picture of them exiting
“I’m sure Hermione will help decorate a little place out here in the garden. Maybe an arch and some flowers.”
“We’re having a son,” Harry whispers, turning to accept a quick kiss from Draco. “Can you go back to his face? Just for a moment?”
Anticipation builds in his belly, his cock swelling as he waits for Draco’s touch.
Draco’s laughter joins his own.
you intend to do now that you’ve got all three kids off to Hogwarts?” Draco inquires.
“He’s helping Scorpius finish getting ready.” She looks him over again and pulls him in for a hug. “You look fantastic. Are you ready to be a married man?”
“I love you, Harry.”
Both men nod.
“When I asked you to check in on my dad, this wasn’t exactly what I had in mind, you know!” Al’s voice has a teasing tone.
“Wear the charcoal trousers and the green jumper. Will you get too warm if you wear a dress shirt under it?”
Harry is setting a heaping plate of pancakes on the table when he hears the Floo activate. “In the kitchen,” he calls, summoning the syrup and a bowl of fresh berries.
“Minerva, I’m afraid I need to take this one home. He needs to rest. He’s had it rather rough the last couple of months.”
“That would be lovely, thank you,” Draco says.
Forgoing individual plates, Draco just lays everything out so they can eat as they please. He settles next to Harry on the blanket and offers him a sandwich before taking one for himself.
“If you are having sex while you’re here, we should probably put a one-way silencing charm on your room. I don’t need your brother whining that he can hear you.” Harry can’t help but laugh at the look of mortification on both boys’ faces at the thought of being overheard by Albus.
“Oh, thank you!” Claire gushes with far more enthusiasm than necessary, moving closer to Harry again. “I just wanted to be sure, you know.” She tips her head and reaches up to push her hair behind her ear.
“Good morning, Harry. I wasn’t expecting to see you in the fire.”
Harry presses out against Draco’s cock, waiting for the burning to settle and allow the pleasure to overtake the discomfort. Draco’s eyes are closed and Harry can’t tell if he’s trying not to cum or resisting the urge to move.
“We’re getting married,” Harry states, trying to keep his face straight.
“Push, Harry! Push hard!” Healer Powell’s voice urges. Harry pushes,
“No, but let’s go anyway.” Harry feels Draco turn and the twist behind his navel sends his head swirling.
“It won’t be long.”
Instead of loosening his hold, Draco’s covering hand guides Harry’s gently down until their fingers can lace together. “Is this all right?” he asks gently.
Harry settles against Draco’s chest and drifts off.
“Of course.” James is up and out of the bathroom immediately.
James eyes both men and Harry can’t quite interpret the look on his face. “I’m fine with it. It’s just…different.”
“Not right now.” Draco chuckles. “Probably in the future, but we haven’t got a concrete timeline for that kind of thing.”
“Everything all right?” Harry’s heart hurts for his son.
“I can understand that. And they were rather invasive,” Harry agrees. “At any rate, my bedroom before I went to Hogwarts was a cupboard under the stairs.”
“Push gently for me, Mr Potter. Like you were having a bowel movement, until I tell you to stop, please.”
“It’s not the worst thing I’ve gone through.” Harry shrugs. “I’d rather like to think life owes me something spectacularly good for a while after an awful lot of crap.” Harry’s worked hard not to stay bitter about his life circumstances after Ginny’s death. A lot of time with his Mind-Healer means he’s been mostly successful, but he does still hold hope that there are good things in his future.
“When?!?” Al demands.
“Yes, love?” Draco pokes a finger gently into Harry’s belly again and Regulus kicks back. This is their father and son game, and it never fails to delight both daddies when their son responds.
“Push, then, love!”
Harry leans gently into Draco’s strong hand. “Sounds brilliant.”
“Ahem.”
“Hi, Regulus! I’m your favourite sister!”
“Middle name, though, I think,” Draco muses. “It’s not really able to be turned into anything that is more typical.”
“Draco, it’s not your fault!” Harry sighs, hating that his fiancé feels guilty over his illness. “I mean, yes, it’s because I’m pregnant, but it’s not like you did something malicious. And the potion you brewed is helping. The nausea just keeps getting worse.”
“Care to dance?”
“We can find a Mind Healer for you that specialises in Anxiety. They can figure out if there’s a chemical imbalance in your brain that is making this worse. There are potions you can take to fix the balance, and they can help you figure out how to cope when it gets bad.”
conversation. I’m sure James and Matthew’s relationship will be all over the news. That’s not going to be easy at fifteen.”
The shirt falls to the floor and Draco’s hand roams over Harry’s swollen abdomen.
the thing I’m most sure about, all in one. I just don’t want to fuck it up.”
James nods.
“Mr Potter!”
“It’s from Matthew. He’s heard back from his parents.”
When this position is no more comfortable than the one prior, he shifts again, this time onto his hands and knees, belly hanging below him, desperate for anything that takes away that painful pressure he’s been battling in his lower back. He drops down to his elbows and groans softly. This at least helps the pain in his hips.
“I know it’s a worthwhile endeavour. It doesn’t mean I enjoy lying around.”
“Yes. I’ve been trying to make myself eat more, but sometimes it just doesn’t stay put.” Harry makes a face. The amount of vomiting he has been doing is both astounding and disgusting. He’s even been retching when the anti-nausea potions should be helping.
Draco furrows his brow thoughtfully. “Maybe a mirror? The one in the en-suite is fine, but it might be nice to have one in the bedroom. We have plenty of room in there.”
“Potter?”
“Matthew?” Draco’s tone is caring but carefully controlled, and Harry realises he must be feeling the same way.
Harry laughs. “
“Well, let’s take advantage of it today.” Draco offers an arm and Harry takes it. “Ready?”
“You both know basic protection charms, right?” Draco knows they do; Harry told him, but he figures Draco is using it as a good entry point for contraception.
“I can tell you from experience that he
“That day with you at the coffee shop.” This time Harry allows his laugh to escape.
“Oh?” She slides each man a cup of tea, placing the sugar and cream between them.
Harry shifts uncomfortably. That doesn’t sound at all enjoyable — the birthing
“Matthew? Are your parents meeting you outside the station?”
“That’s
“Of course.” Harry musters a smile.
“Yes.” Draco’s refined accent has taken on an even crisper air than normal. “We’d like to look at engagement rings. Perhaps some wedding bands, also.”
“You didn’t answer me, Harry. I’m inclined to think you’re turning me down.”
“Well that’s something,” she says with some satisfaction. She waves her hand in a rolling, dismissive gesture. “
“It’s over. You did great. Everything went perfect.” There’s a strained joy in Draco’s voice, and Harry can’t imagine how hard it must have been for him to sit and wait for news. He reaches for his stomach.
“I’ll pick you up at seven. Dress Muggle; I don’t want to be papped on our first proper date.” Draco says drolly.
The boys obediently follow Bernice, and Harry turns inquiringly to Draco.
Harry’s heart swells. He really wants Draco to be just as happy as he is and so far, it seems that he is. Harry’s always had a hard time accepting good things when they happen to him because they’re so often ripped away, but he’s trying — hoping — to see that Draco can be his
“If something happens, I will take care of the kids. I promise.” Draco’s voice holds no room for doubt and Harry clings to that reassurance.
“We’re not ready yet, I know that. We talk about it.”
After Hermione’s gone home, Harry spreads several large books and sheets of parchment out over the bed in front of himself and Draco. They’ve decided to use the rest of the evening to try to find a name for their son.
“He’s moving. I can feel him moving.”
“You’re welcome, Harry. I hope you feel better.”
“It’s another thing I never thought I’d have a chance at.”
“Ah,” Draco nods, “that makes sense. If you tell Al today, he’ll be a complete disaster by Friday. Scorpius may strangle us both if we leave him to deal with a worked up Albus that long.”
“I am,” Harry smirks. “I’m quite enjoying the view.”
“It’ll all be worth it.” Harry rubs his belly and then pokes softly, smiling when their son responds in kind. “Regulus is our bright little star, and he’s worth all the discomfort and bedrest in the world.”
“Are you getting married?” Lily blurts, still looking absolutely giddy.
been in a relationship like this. It scares the shit out of me. But it’s wonderful and I want it to last and I want
Harry stands with a rough groan, pushing his own pants over his hips and grasping his aching cock. He tugs once…twice…three times and then he’s spilling onto Draco’s arse. He looks down to see Draco’s head craned around, watching him cum. He sees nothing but satiation and satisfaction written in those warm grey eyes.
Draco drops elegantly to the ground onto one knee in front of Harry. Harry’s eyes blur with tears, and he’s forced to blink rapidly to bring Draco back into focus. When he can see clearly again, Draco is offering up a ring between them.
Harry snorts and a ghost of a smile touches the corners of his mouth. “This—” Harry gestures between them, “—makes a bit more sense now, knowing that Al’s been meddling in things.”
He eyes the picture critically. They’d ended up in robes for dinner when Harry discovered that none of his nice trousers would button comfortably anymore. Draco looks fabulous in his deep plum robes, but he’s more worried about his own midsection.
Draco immediately guides his legs off the bed and offers his body to Harry for support, shouldering his weight with no complaint. Standing helps, and so do Draco’s hands squeezing his hips together and their bodies swaying slowly back and forth.
“If I move, I’m afraid I’ll vomit again,” Harry murmurs.
One hand releases its hold and there’s a pause before Harry gasps as the pad of a finger touches his hole. Draco’s tender circular motions are surely meant to help him relax, but in reality, they only make Harry more aware of how badly he wants Draco’s fingers inside him.
want, tell us. We want to make sure what you get is of good quality and safe.”
“Love!” Harry calls. “Hermione’s on her way!”
“I love you, too.”
“Dad! Draco! Over here!”
“I know we’ve already had this discussion, but I’m going to say it again. I haven’t had sex in twelve years, Draco. It’s going to be like the first time for both of us all over again and I’m ok with that. But I want this because I want this with
Harry looks up to see five pairs of eyes fixed on him and Draco.
“Your membrane is beginning to thin just a little bit, Mr Potter, which is actually a good sign right now. It means your body is preparing for birth. If you go into labour at this point, I wouldn’t attempt to stop it.”
“Wanker,” Harry retorts as they set off down the sidewalk. Draco's subsequent laughter is music to his ears.
“Congratulations to you both! Healer Carr sent her notes, but if we can get your husband into the bed, we’ll check him over and see where we are.”
“All right.” Draco comes down the stairs and looks over the room. “Are you ready?”
“Matthew.” Draco’s voice is followed by scuffled shuffling noises, and Harry is sure Draco’s just wrapped the boy in a hug. There’s an uptick in Matthews sobs again and he can hear quiet murmuring from Draco that can’t be understood over the phone.
Harry is helping Draco set the pasta out on the island when footsteps come flying down the stairs. James rushes into the kitchen, tears falling down his face, phone pressed to his ear.
“You and Dad are coming, aren’t you?” Albus asks.
Hermione’s silence rings in his ears.
“Lily, sweetheart, I don’t understand either.” Draco’s voice is gentle. “Nothing any of you kids could ever do would make your dad or me want you to leave. Certainly not the gender of the person you’re attracted to.”
Al and Scorpius are clearly discussing Quidditch as there are cookies, salt and pepper shakers, and pieces of napkin between them being moved around as they speak quietly, but intensely. Scorpius’ face is so like Draco’s when he’s passionate about something. Albus, always his emotional and empathetic one, is clearly trying to keep himself from getting more worked up than a Quidditch conversation warrants.
“How do you want to spend today? What will make it easier on you?”
“Here we go.” Draco pushes open the door and guides Harry through. A cacophony of questions begins flying immediately.
Being cradled against Draco’s firm chest anchors him, and being held by his husband’s strong but gentle hands reminds him that this baby, this product of his and Draco’s love, is making his way into the world and into their family.
Harry nods and turns towards Draco to reach for the basil. “And their cleaning. And their yard work. And anything else they didn’t want to do.” He shrugs. “My childhood was pretty much crap. As a parent, I’ve basically tried to do the absolute opposite of everything done to me growing up.”
James keeps his hand in place and turns. “Babe, come here,” he beckons Matthew, who comes to his side. He takes his boyfriend’s hand and gently places it over the spot the baby has been kicking, putting his own hand on top and helping Matthew to press softly.
Harry tightens his hold on Draco for just a moment, hoping the squeeze expresses the comfort he’s trying to provide.
Harry moves his hands from Draco’s arse to his hips.
“That was brilliant,” Draco mumbles. Harry laughs softly as Draco heaves in a breath and opens his eyes completely, staring straight into Harry’s. “You make me feel so good.”
“Fingers?”
“Yes?”
“Currys?” Draco asks with a deep frown.
“Albus! Let me finish,” Harry sighs. He has no idea what scenarios are playing out in Al’s head, but he’s certain they’re all catastrophic. “I’m still ill, but I’ve been seeing a Healer, and I will be fine eventually, but—”
“Hello, Hermione.” Draco’s voice holds none of the trepidation Hermione’s face had expressed, and Harry’s sure he’s trying to make this an easier transition. “Are you going to join us this evening?”
“I haven’t had to worry about a new romantic situation in almost twenty years, Hermione.” Harry’s hands are in his hair as he tries to sort his emotions. “I’m not sure I remember how to do this. And I don’t even know if he’s actually interested in me, or if he’s just being kind. Which is a whole new kind of weird to deal with!”
Draco laughs with something akin to relief. “I’m glad it’s not just me. I was pacing my living room before I left and I felt ridiculous.”
“Sure. Where did you want to start?”
“Harry James Potter!” Hermione cuts off Draco’s greeting and grabs Harry’s left hand, looking to the shiny band and stones gleaming there.
James nods slowly, staring intently at the bed instead of looking at either adult. “We’ve kissed. Handjobs. Blowjobs. And he’s put fingers in me.”
“I’m fine.” Harry chastises himself for panicking and schools his features into what he hopes is a calm smile as he heads for the door, wine in hand. “Let’s go, then. What have you chosen for us?”
“Now that you've brought this, hopefully he can stop throwing up long enough for us to figure that out.”
“Why don’t you go and get your things, love? We can settle our stuff in together. Do you want me to come with you?”
“Agreed,” Harry smiles. “Would you like to Side-Along, or would you rather walk?”
easy on the eyes. He’s definitely Harry’s type of man in the looks department.
“Exhausted. I can’t even explain to you how worn out I am.”
“But you’re still tired, Harry.”
“Scorpius kills Orion in mythology.” Draco shakes his head.
. And I can’t tell you why I’m nervous, but I am.”
“You likely laboured through a lot of the night, so I would say probably so. For wizards, it usually tends to be slow at the beginning, then much quicker towards the end.” She stands and gathers her bag. “I’ll be back in an hour or so.”
When Draco is fully inside him, arms wrap around his waist and Draco’s mouth is next to his ear.
“You’ve lost another four pounds in addition to the two and a half you lost last week, and you’re anaemic. You need to eat more to keep you and the baby nourished.” She continues her spell work. “You’re not feeling faint?”
“I still can’t believe he’s here.” Draco’s fingers trace Regulus’ small features. “I’m so proud of you, Harry. You fought so hard to birth him. You handled it all so well.”
Harry shrugs into his leather jacket as Draco pulls his own jacket from the coat closet. “There’s an Apparition point not too far from Currys.”
“At the risk of sounding completely crass…I’d very much like your cock in my arse.”
“Of course!” Hermione’s grin lights up her face. “Oh, this is exciting! What do the kids think?”
“Furniture is the first thing we’re picking out.” Harry squeezes Draco’s hand. “We can paint and match bedding and decor accordingly.”
“He’s coming upstairs.”
Her fingers slide out and she and Draco help Harry to return to sitting against his husband.
“That’s what the Healer said.” Harry finds himself unable to hold back his tears and they spill over, rolling down his cheeks. Draco draws him close again and wraps warm arms around him.
Draco laughs softly with him, and Harry feels it against his back. “Can I ask a bold question?”
“Obviously, I had to discuss some of it further before he left for Hogwarts. The war is covered in History of Magic and our name is affiliated with Voldemort. I wanted to make sure he knew that’s not who we are now.” Malfoy shakes off the unease and looks back to Harry. “But anyhow, no grandparents in our situation, either.”
“That’s all right.” Harry shifts to lie flat and lifts his hips, pressing his joggers and pants down his legs under the blankets before kicking them off.
a label, but I’m not opposed to one,” Draco says, voice sounding much more relaxed to Harry’s ears. “I just…I feel like it’s more than ‘I’m dating someone’, but boyfriend sounds so…Hogwarts.” Harry doesn’t even have to look at Draco to know his nose is wrinkled at the thought. Harry snickers.
A slow, steady rhythm soon has Draco’s finger sliding fully in and out of Harry’s arse. Harry gasps as Draco crooks that finger to brush his prostate.
The ring has a sleek, modern design and a curved grooving that swirls from either side of a single ruby stone. Harry smiles. It looks like something Draco would wear and he can easily picture it on Draco’s finger.
Scorpius’ only response is a hiccough and a sob. Rubbing his back gently, Harry looks to Draco. “Do you suppose we should tell the others?”
Harry gathers his wand, wallet, and mobile before dashing to the loo for a final check in the mirror. He can’t remember the last time he thought
“Ok, you can stop.” She withdraws her fingers. “Your membrane is still fully in place, but it is beginning to bulge. It’s quite normal in a male pregnancy, but we also don’t want to put any extra pressure on it, because we don’t want a premature birth.”
“Is it bad?” Draco hands over the requested wand.
After two cups of coffee and some food, Draco is much more coherent and awake. He grabs Harry’s plate as well as his own and carries them to the sink.
Slowly stroking his cock, he pulls one knee up and reaches behind himself. He rubs one lubed finger over his entrance and gasps at the sensation. He’s not done this in a very long time and had forgotten just how good it feels.
“You absolute cheat!” Draco’s laughing voice booms. Harry hears the slap of Draco’s feet as he hurtles after him.
“Why so long, dad?” Lily finally pipes up. Harry reaches for her hand with his free one and squeezes it gently.
Several minutes later, his cock is leaking and he has two fingers pressing inside himself, and it’s
“I’m so proud of you, son,” Harry says softly in his son’s ear. He releases James and looks to Matthew.
“Are you going to tell her that?” Harry cuddles closer to Draco. He doesn’t doubt Draco or his commitment, but it is always nice to hear it affirmed out loud.
“That makes sense.” Draco still sounds a bit hesitant. “That’s never been something I’ve had to worry about. With Astoria there was…no sexual attraction. It was something I had to do. And my other partners were…at the risk of sounding vulgar, just a shag.”
“Right, so, pregnancy food it is,” Draco teases, heading for the kitchen to leaf through the takeaway menus. All Harry has craved the last three weeks has been bread and pasta and carby food and cheese. Any kind of cheese. Draco ends up ordering multiple giant pans of pasta and chicken in various sauces with several orders of cheese-covered garlic bread from FlooFood to be delivered at dinner time. There’s also going to be salad, but that’s really not relevant to Harry’s pregnant self.
in the span of one summer?” He throws up his hands. “Plus, everything else you’ve read, which you’re clearly retaining, based on your ability to converse with Healer Carr today about
Harry gestures to Healer Powell. “Now look.”
Draco gathers his wand and his mobile and is off with a pop.
He sets the dildo and the lube on his nightstand, spells his bed and himself clean with a wave of his hand, and gives in to sleep on the waves of his post-orgasmic euphoria.
Harry gathers his courage and asks a question he knows both he and Draco want the answer to.
“Draco?”
“Well, evidently she doesn’t know you’re pregnant yet.” Draco gives a devilish chuckle. “Perhaps I shall write back and let her know.”
“You’re full of shite, you know.”
“We can at least make sure Matthew has some support if it goes poorly,” Harry says firmly. “He won’t be left alone like you were.”
Draco accepts the cases from Harry and looks through them, “
“All right, Mr Potter. I have some questions.” Healer Carr eyes them both with a look Harry can’t quite interpret. Harry nods, seeing Draco do the same.
“Oh, bloody hell.” Draco pinches the bridge of his nose. “That’ll be Euripides.”
“Romantically?” Draco sounds almost hopeful, but Harry can’t decide if that’s what he wants to hear or if that’s what Draco is really conveying.
“Hello, Matthew.” Harry smiles at him as James kisses him in greeting. “I don’t think you’ve met my partner before. This is Draco Malfoy.”
Harry moans and lays back on the bed. It’s not like he hasn’t wanked in the eleven years he’s been alone, but he hasn’t done it like this — with someone in mind. He envisions running his hands down the hard planes of Draco’s chest and pushing his fingers through Draco’s gorgeous blond hair, kissing Draco’s smirking lips. He moves his hand faster over his cock, swiping across his head and gathering the beads of precum already leaking there.
Regulus answers with a press against Harry’s skin. He seems to know Draco and his voice.
“Oh hell,” Draco mutters. “I hadn’t considered that.”
“Well, so far, it’s been a bit miserable.” Harry opts for brutal honesty. The physical part of this pregnancy has actually sucked. “I’ve been pretty sick, James. Lots of nausea and throwing up, and I’ve been really tired. But seeing the baby in the imaging bubble is amazing, and knowing that I’m having a baby with someone I love is very exciting.”
They both startle at Scorpius’ gasp.
Draco stifles a laugh. “Come on, let me take you to lunch.”
James cracks a smile. “I do think that serious partner might be Matthew, Dad. We’ve been friends since first year and things have been great between us since he decided to come out at school.”
“Does that mean we can go shopping for the nursery today?”
“Should we give my solicitor a heads up?” Draco reaches over and takes Harry’s hand, tracing gentle patterns up and down his fingers, but even Draco’s touch isn’t enough to quell his increasing irritation over dealing with the press. “He can at least have something prepared to send out to any publications that cross the line, especially regarding the kids.”
“There you go. Go on and pack it in your bag. We’ll be leaving soon.”
Draco hums softly and Harry pauses to let him speak. “Handjobs are good. I’ve actually never had anyone else play with my balls, but I’m not put off at the thought.”
“Oh?” Draco sounds sincerely surprised. Maybe Harry hadn’t been as obvious as he thought.
Fingers dip into the waistband of Harry’s trousers, sliding under his belly and working them slowly down over his hips. Harry watches intently in the mirror as Draco sinks to his knees, helping Harry to step out of his trousers.
“No, we didn’t,” Harry confirms and waits for what feels like a lifetime before James speaks up again.
“So you’re not sure if he has any romantic intentions because Scorpius asked him to check on you?” Hermione’s expression turns pensive, clearly suspecting she’s missing something. Her fingers drum lightly on the table as she mulls over this new information.
“Lil!” Harry shakes his head and then sighs. Lily’s face holds no shame.
They chorus their goodnights before following Draco out the door.
The soft smile on Draco’s lips sets the pixies to dancing with renewed vigour and Harry busies himself assembling the pasta, sauce, and chicken, before covering it with cheese and sliding it in the oven.
“I do.”
Harry’s eyes fly open. Panting hard, he turns his head slowly and looks to the other side of his bed. Empty.
He stares at the mirror, his pregnant belly fat with the child of the man who is driving into him. He wraps a hand around his own cock and gasps as it only takes a few pulls before he’s spurting white ropes onto the chair, arse pulsating around Draco.
“We can have a big wedding or a party to celebrate later if we want to,” Harry shrugs. That part really isn’t important to him. What he cares about is being bonded, eternally, to the man next to him. “But I want to have this baby with you as my bonded husband.”
“Nothing is wrong,” Harry says calmly, rubbing Al’s back. “We’ll talk about what’s going on as soon as everyone is in here, okay?”
Harry groans. Apparating on his own is no longer doable, because of how incredibly dizzy and nauseous he gets on arrival. The Floo is only slightly better, and he’s never been graceful exiting a fireplace.
Harry glances at Draco. “He looks positively terrified.”
Harry turns to his stomach and adjusts himself comfortably, face down on top of his forearms. He hears the button on Draco’s jeans pop open and the soft purr as the zipper falls, then the soft rustle of fabric as Draco divests himself of his clothes. He feels Draco straddle his body and then settle on his arse.
“Well, yeah.” Harry feels his face heat. “I’m rather hoping you’d like to come fly sometime, if that’s all right?.”
“Merlin, I wish I’d had someone to do that for me,” Draco chuckles.
“Yeah, but then he just sat back down and—” Harry flings his hands open “—nothing.”
He’s just given Draco’s arse a firm squeeze when he hears Scorpius’ voice.
“What we have together. A happy relationship. Fabulous sex. Being in love.” Draco’s hand rubs gentle circles on Harry’s back.
“I’ll get it.” Draco’s touch and subsequent easy smile give Harry butterflies in his stomach. “You’re helping me out today.”
“I’m going to go start a brew of that pregnancy-safe pain potion for you. Why don’t you have a nap and by the time you wake up, it should be about done?”
“I’d like to perform a more thorough exam, if Mr Potter is comfortable with that. We’ll know more about your specific situation with that information.”
“Do those have to be warded, as well?” Draco hands Harry’s device back.
“Scorp has something he’d like to discuss with you.”
Twelve days later, Harry stands on an empty Platform 9 ¾, gazing at the place where the train had been, his five children waving as they pulled away, heading back to Hogwarts. The house will not be so quiet without them this year, though. A soft coo comes from the infant in his arms, and he smiles down at Regulus, who stares back at him with wide eyes.
“Can I use both?”
One finger is placed under Harry’s chin, and Draco gently lifts until Harry looks at him. “I told you it was there, Harry. It’s the only spot that scarred. And you can’t even see it unless you know to look.” Draco’s sincerity is written all over his face and in his eyes. “I forgave you a long time ago, just like you forgave me for breaking your nose. It’s not who we are now.”
An hour later, they’re sending Woody back into the night with a letter on board.
“I think I do, actually.”
“I think it’s better if we write.” Harry knows Minerva will ask them through if he Floos, and he doesn’t want her to know he’s expecting before the children do. “Maybe we can see the kids back to the castle, and talk to her then.”
“What are you thinking?”
Harry can’t resist the urge to tease Draco, just a little. “How about a snookums?”
“Well, that’s quicker than I anticipated,” Harry sighs. “At least we might figure out what’s going on.”
“My partner. Draco is my partner.”
“You’re welcome.” Harry grins back. “We better get back up to the house. Dinner should be about ready.”
“No. I don’t even remember the last time I used my wand. Maybe over the holiday, when we were decorating for Christmas?”
“Harry?” Draco’s voice startles him. “Are you all right?”
Reaching with his other hand, he drags a firm knuckle along his perineum before cupping his balls. Harry groans and adds a twist to even faster pulls, hips lifting as he fucks into his own hand. A slight tug on his balls later, Harry cries out, cumming embarrassingly quickly.
Harry dares a glance at Draco’s face, only to discover an evil smirk.
“I find I’m quite enjoying it myself.” Harry is sure he looks ridiculous with the sappy smile he can’t wipe off his face. He kisses Draco gently on the lips. “I could get used to this.”
“I am.” Draco strides quickly to Harry and gives him a quick kiss. “I’m sorry I’m late. We’re working on that stabilising potion for your study so we can get it to the Curse-Breakers this week and I had a breakthrough.”
The tugging on Harry’s hair intensifies, and he flicks his eyes up to Draco’s face.
“Are you upset?”
Harry works his way around Draco’s opening, tongue coaxing him to loosen up with short firm licks. Draco is no longer using words, but his body speaks for him, pressing back against Harry’s face, moaning without restraint.
“I already set the parcel from Wand and Wood up there. It’s ready when you are.”
He closes his eyes and drifts back to sleep.
“These rings are an outward symbol of the love between you. Like the magic that binds your souls, these rings have no beginning and no end.”
“I know. I can’t believe he’ll be here, in our arms.”
Lilly nods vigorously.
“I am. And my boyfriend and I hope to have children someday.”
He steps out of his denims and Draco rises, running his hands back up Harry’s body to settle on his hips. “You’re absolutely gorgeous, Harry,” he says, voice raspy. “I hope you know that.”
A moment later, he pulls off his glasses and lays them on the sink. Pulling his wand from his back pocket, he carefully spells his eyes to clear his vision and shudders.
“Why…wait, what?!” Draco sounds completely caught off guard and Harry rushes to elaborate.
“Member of the mustard family. Used in Polyjuice, but only if you pick it at the full moon.”
“We really don’t know yet. I spoke to them briefly when I went to get Matthew. They are quite upset and were very insistent that his ‘lifestyle choice’ wasn’t acceptable in their home.” Draco sighs. “After I told them that I was James’ dad’s fiancé, they didn’t seem too keen on me being there, either, so I went upstairs, packed Matthew’s things, and we came here. We’ll try talking to them again later, once they’ve had time to deal with their emotions.”
he whispers, needing a moment to adjust. His own breathing is startlingly loud as he moves slightly, pushing against the dildo as he wishes fervently it was Draco’s cock instead. He rocks back and forth just a little, the discomfort slowly giving way to the blissful feeling of being completely filled. “
“I am not sure this is typical pregnancy-associated nausea. We found a few abnormalities in your scans that we’d like to follow up on. You’ll be here for a couple of days at any rate.”
Hermione steps back from their embrace and smiles past Harry.
“We’re going to run some more tests over the next couple of days. You’re also going to get a constant dose of nutrients, iron, and anti-nausea medication along with fluids.” He gestures to Harry’s right arm, where a thin tube disappears into his skin. “Nothing appears severe or life-threatening, but given the strain on your body from the pregnancy, we want to be safe, not sorry.”
“We appreciate your willingness to come so quickly.”
“Hey there, girl,” Harry says, running his hand affectionately over the owl’s back. “You and Lily made it all right, then?”
“Why don’t you try to sleep it off if you can? We’ll see if you feel better in the morning. I’ll get you some water and a basin, just in case.”
A medical cart rattles through the door with Healer Powell in tow.
“Do you think I look pregnant?”
“Mr Potter,” Headmistress McGonagall greets him. “It’s so good to see you.”
Draco snorts. “Isn’t that the truth?”
He watches as Albus processes this information and relief washes over him as Al cracks a tiny smile.
“Wow!” she gasps, eyes dancing. “That’s so cool!”
“I’ve never been so ready for anything in my life.”
“Love you, too, Harry! Have fun. I hope it goes well!” She withdraws her head from the Floo and closes the connection.
“Feel that hard ball?”
“I’m excited, too. I know we didn’t plan this, and we hadn’t planned on starting parenthood over again at 40, but I wouldn’t change it for anything.”
It’s Draco. Of course, it’s Draco.
“But you did marry and have a son.”
Harry reaches across the table and covers one of Hermione’s hands with his own. “Do you still miss Ron?”
“Why’s that?”
“Merlin, Harry. I’m falling hard, too. And I’ve…fuck.” Draco pauses and closes his eyes. Harry runs his thumb gently along Draco’s finger and gives him the time he needs. “I’ve
“I don’t particularly want to be pregnant.” Harry feels Draco tense beside him. “But I very much want the baby we’ll be getting at the end of it.”
Dead silence.
“Is there anything else you want to talk about?”
.” Harry’s stomach knots as he watches Draco’s expression turn thoughtful and disapproving.
“I will.” James heads for the door.
Draco cries out as Harry’s arse pulses around him and then he’s moving faster and deeper and harder until his thrusts become erratic.
“I’ll make sure you have more of both before you go back. Do you need anything else for the bedroom?”
“Hi, Hermione.”
Once upstairs with all three of them settled on the bed, Harry takes a deep breath. He’s committed to an open and honest discussion with his kids, but he’s pretty sure this is going to be a very personal discussion with James, and it’s not going to be comfortable, however necessary it may be.
Minerva draws her wand, pulling a silver tendril of magic from Draco’s left hand, looping it around their hands before settling her wand on Harry’s right.
“Astoria and I had an arranged marriage for the purpose of supplying me with an heir,” Malfoy states with a very matter-of-fact tone. “She had no desire to be a mother. She fulfilled her obligation and when Scorpius was six months old, she weaned him and signed away parental rights. She was given a substantial alimony payment upon our divorce and left the country shortly after.” Malfoy’s features soften slightly. “I believe she still lives in France.”
“And your family?”
The bubble fills with the hazy dark image Harry now knows is his womb. Healer Carr freezes the image at several points to take and notate measurements as she goes. Finally, the tiny white shape of the baby appears.
“So, what assistance do you require?”
“Thank you, love.” Harry shoots Draco a grateful look and a smile before turning back to Hermione. “Come on through when you’re ready?”
handle figuring things out?” Harry fixes his eyes on Hermione.
“Fuck,” he mutters. “Draco, can you get my wand?”
“Harry, do you accept Draco’s gift of love in body, magic, and soul?”
“You’d…you’ll really just
“He can see us in an hour. He understands the urgency.” Draco stands and brushes himself off.
Draco’s cheeks pink and he runs his fingers lightly up and down Harry’s cock. Harry moans at the touch. He’s fine with anything Draco wants to give him.
“Sounds perfect.” Draco kisses Harry softly and takes his hand, leading him upstairs to the shower.
“Don’t hex anyone, Draco. I’ll be fine.” Harry loves Draco’s protective side, but he also has no desire to deal with the ramifications of his fiancé hexing the public.
“We’re married,” he whispers.
“No.” Harry shakes his head.
Harry knows what his own back yard looks like and is gazing at Draco instead. The setting sun makes his white-blond hair glisten like gold and gives his pale skin an almost ethereal glow. Harry’s breath catches in his throat.
“So how do we stop that?” Draco sounds alarmed.
“I’m still quite ill when the potion wears off. I’m also even more exhausted than last week.”
Draco takes the letter from Harry, scanning it before setting it aside.
“Are you eating well?”
“The kids know.” Draco sounds relieved.
Draco is again standing before him and rushes to kiss him deeply.
“Yeah, I—“ Harry pauses as footsteps come down the stairs. James and Matthew turn into the kitchen, hand in hand. They both still look like they’ve been crying, but they also look rather sated, and Harry isn’t quite sure he wants to know how they’ve worked off their feelings to get to that state.
“I did, but then I divorced my wife and continued to live as openly gay, which evidently was reasonably acceptable, or at least acceptable enough not to cause the social drama of disowning me.” Draco rolls his eyes. “I’m assuming the most unacceptable part of my current relationship is that it’s with you.”
“Give me about fifteen minutes and I’ll be there.” Hermione shifts to back out of the fire. “I’ll see you soon!”
“Tired, Scorp?” Draco asks.
“Let’s start walking. I’d like to get this show on the road, so to speak.”
“Daddy!!!” Lily immediately dashes for her dad when she and Draco appear in the living room. Draco smiles as Harry wraps his arms around his daughter.
Now they’re only two days from putting the children on the Hogwarts Express, and Harry can acutely feel their time as a family running short. At least they’re spending New Year’s Eve all together, relaxing at Potter Cottage. Matthew has come over to see James, and all five kids are currently on their brooms, flying around under the lights of the Quidditch pitch. Harry and Draco are snuggled together under a blanket on the patio chaise longue, watching the wild game of 5-person “Catch the Snitch” in the distance.
“So something
into him than Draco is into Harry, or
Healer Carr spreads the potion across Harry’s abdomen and conjures a bubble.
Harry’s nerves stir again as Draco shifts slightly over him. It’s been a long time since he’s done anything but fly solo for his sexual pleasure, and even longer since he’s been with another man.
He’s found himself there quite often, usually with books on male pregnancy or raising children in a blended family. Today, he finds himself with a book of a different kind. He opens
Harry bolts from bed and dashes for the loo, making it just in time to empty the contents of his stomach into the toilet. Even after there’s nothing left, he continues to retch, stomach still churning.
“Do you think they mean me specifically? Or just in general?”
“Can we talk?”
“They told him he needed to leave, yes.” Harry is trying to be matter of fact, but it’s getting harder. This isn’t a cut and dry, easy-to-understand situation.
“Still want that nap?” Draco asks.
“Some of them.”
“He is.” Harry shrinks all three trunks and casts a featherweight charm over them before Draco scoops them up and pockets them.
“Do you think you can eat?” Draco’s hand smooths his hair.
“Do you love him?”
“The Committee for Wizarding Welfare meeting was fine. When we tried to meet with the Wizengamot members to talk about making actual changes, though, everything went sideways.” An exasperated sigh punctuates her plating of the food. “They’re fine with the ideas, but they refuse to put any money behind it. I don’t know how they expect us to make life better for people without any money.”
“I unshrank the trunks and levitated them to everyone’s room. Told them to put things away before they came back down.”
His son grins. “Pregnancy hazard?”
Harry’s heart sinks at the thought of not being able to take his kids to the train. “Maybe I can—”
“Pain?”
“No Potter males have a recorded history of being carriers. My aunt and uncle never had me tested, but our family Healer told me it was highly unlikely that I could carry.”
“I’m fine with it as long as Healer Carr doesn’t mind.” Harry looks to the Healer and nods.
“Kind of. Lily also said something that sort of hit me hard. She said I’ve smiled more since they’ve been home than I did the entire month before they left. She said she and James are glad to finally see me happy.”
“I went for something less traditional than a typical first date,” Draco says, a hint of uncertainty in his voice. “I really just wanted to be able to spend some time with you without the weird
“And you went?” Hermione asks leadingly.
“Harry!” Draco calls, “Someone’s in the Floo!”
“Great. Draco just got home from work.” Harry gestures behind him to where Draco has disappeared up the stairs. ”We were wondering if you wanted to come through for dinner. I just put chicken and potatoes in the oven.”
Draco chuckles. “I spent the entire time between our tea at the coffee shop and that night trying to sort out my feelings. But I knew the minute you opened the front door that I wanted to be much more than your friend.”
“That should work. If we send Edgar off tonight, we should hear back by tomorrow.” Draco’s fingers trace patterns on Harry’s belly. “Provided they can come, I think we should tell them Friday night and give them the weekend to ask questions.”
“I’ve really been enjoying all the time we have been spending together,” Harry begins, hesitating as he pieces together his next words.
“Probably?”
“Snargaluff Pods.”
Harry looks past Lily to Scorpius. “We’re not sure yet, but no matter what, we’ll make sure that Matthew is safe, has a place where he is accepted and loved, and has the things he needs. For now, that’s with us and we are happy to have him stay, but a lot of this will be Matthew’s decisions, not ours.”
“Ready, then?”
Harry lifts a hand to Draco’s face.
Dressed and ready, Harry surveys himself in the mirror again.
“I’ll also take you to Muggle London tomorrow and we’ll get your mobile put on our family’s plan.”
interested in the job Draco described, and Draco really does seem to think Harry would be capable of doing it.
Harry’s eyes swim with tears.
“Scorpius has been asking for one for years at this point. He claims it will help him keep in touch with me, even though they’re not permitted at Hogwarts.” Draco rolls his eyes. “I have some co-workers who use them often, as well.”
“You might say that.” Harry smiles up at Draco before looking back to Hermione. “I’m pregnant.”
“I was catching up with Blaise. He’s just gone. But yes. The train left nearly half an hour ago.”
“Have you made any progress on figuring out how you’d like to fill your time?” Draco asks as they cross the street.
having a baby with a Gryffindor!” Harry retorts.
James finally appears at the top of the stairs. He’s clearly put some effort into his appearance and Harry smiles. All six of them are headed into wizarding London for a nice Sunday brunch and some Christmas shopping. Not only is it the first outing with Harry and Draco publicly involved as a couple, but Matthew is also meeting them in London to spend the day with James.
“I’m glad to have you home. And we’ll figure out how you can see Mina. Draco will have to take you, though. Or Aunt Hermione.”
“Buttercup?”
“It’s not a her,” Harry confesses, averting his eyes for just a moment before looking back at his best friend.
“James, your mobile is in Draco’s jacket pocket. I was running a bit warm and didn’t want to wear mine.”
“And you will be older and have had more schooling, James,” Harry reasons. “Your Aunt Hermione says exactly what Draco says, and you know full well she wouldn’t say it if she didn’t mean it.”
Harry scratches the Floo address and Apparition coordinates for Potter Cottage at the bottom, as well as the wording needed to allow Draco through the Fidelius Charm. He rolls up the parchment, seals it with a gentle spell, and sends Pyxis off with the reply. Resting his forehead against the cool glass of the now-closed window, he can’t decide if dinner with Draco is a brilliant idea or a terrifying one.
“I was worried about that. My parents said as long as I refuse to ‘behave appropriately’, I can forget about anything they do for me. They do pay my phone bill.”
Harry lays his head against the back of the couch. He doesn’t know how to say this other than bluntly, and he doesn’t know how Draco is going to respond. Having not dealt with a fresh romantic situation in almost twenty years is making him second-guess everything.
Harry shifts and pushes himself into wakefulness. “I’m sorry, love. I didn’t realise I was so tired.”
“So much vomiting,” Draco mutters.
Harry smirks briefly and then sobers. “We probably need to make some time for James to be alone with us before they go back. He may have questions he’s not comfortable asking in front of the others.”
Draco raises an eyebrow. “What might that be?”
. I hate having our happiness evaluated by the public for validity.”
“Love?” Harry calls in the general direction of the pantry.
Harry eases back from the kiss and runs his fingertips down Draco’s cheek. He hopes, fervently, that Draco loves him as well, or will soon.
Harry stands from the oven and slides the door shut again just in time to see a weary Woody swooping to the perch. Draco hands him James’ letter and he opens it.
“Nnnnngh.” Harry’s moan bounces off the tile as the firm press of Draco’s tongue traces a path from the back of his balls, past his hole and to his spine. “Fuck, Draco!”
“Matthew decided he had to come out to his parents because we started having sex. He knew for sure after that there was no way he’d ever be with anyone other than a man and wanted to be able to be himself, even at home.”
He watches them clamour down the stairs before turning back to Minerva. The look on her face is difficult to interpret. Something akin to pride, perhaps.
“He has, but nothing is wrong,” Harry smiles. “He had something important to discuss with me, and he’d like to share it with the rest of you. Go on, Scorp.”
specifically for the chapter on deep cleaning.
James scoots a bit down the bed to better see the bubble. Healer Carr very patiently talks James through every feature of Regulus’ tiny body, his umbilical cord, and measuring the fluid in his amniotic sac, and patiently answers each of his many questions. Harry loves seeing Regulus— but today, he thinks he might be enjoying watching James’ fascination with the medical side of things even more.
“Of course.” Draco pads across the room and strong arms help Harry to sit upright. He reaches up and puts his arms around his husband’s neck and heaves himself to stand. Balance has become an issue in the last week or so as Regulus has gotten so much bigger and every bit of the weight is out in front.
Draco seems just a little disappointed. “I know that will come later, but I wish I could feel it now.”
Another wave of nausea slams into him and Harry is retching again. There’s nothing left to come up but his body seems unaware of this particular fact and it takes several minutes before he manages to stop again.
Draco turns to Erwin. “Can this be done in other metals?”
“I can think of better ways to keep warm,” Draco says suggestively. Harry’s cheeks heat as he recalls all the ways he’s imagined Draco helping him
“I do.”
“Soon. But we should get to
“I didn’t tell them I have a boyfriend or anything. I just told them I’m gay, that I am attracted to men and only men. They blew up. My dad told me that I’m disgusting. Mom said she blames the magical world for putting such awful ideas in my head.
“Write if you need us, or ask the Headmistress to Floo.” Draco’s hand rests on Harry’s back and Harry can feel the tension radiating from him. He’s not ready to let them go, either. “Go on, then.”
“Well, that’s good to know. I’ve come close to just throwing caution to the wind several times and being more assertive, but I didn’t want to upset you.”
Harry approaches the two men and is careful to leave distance between himself and Draco. He’d like nothing better than to hold Draco’s hand right now and if he gets too close, he’s afraid he might do it, appropriate or not.
Draco stands, offering Harry his hand. Harry looks up into sparkling grey eyes and grins, placing his hand into Draco’s outstretched one. Tugging Harry to his feet, Draco gathers him close and they sway gently together. Harry can’t imagine feeling happier and more content than he does in Draco’s arms.
“Is that better?” Draco inquires, expression bemused.
“That’s good. I’ve felt better this week even without pain potion.” Harry is always relieved when the way he’s feeling matches the testing.
“I want to be a Potter,” he blurts and looks at Draco, who nods encouragingly. “I want both of us — all of us — to be Potters. We should leave the Malfoy name and the awful things it stood for where they all belong — in the past.”
“Is it safe in a pregnancy?”
“Nope. My aunt and uncle never took me anywhere as a child unless they had to.” Harry shrugs. “I had to stay in my cupboard if they went out somewhere fun with my cousin.”
Harry keeps his eyes closed as he downs the potion and feels his body adjust. He cracks open his eyes and pulls off the glasses he no longer needs. Draco still has his eyes screwed tightly shut and the face that is no longer his looks pained.
“It will. I’m so ready to finally see the baby that I’ve watched grow from the outside. I didn’t get to see Scorpius being born, I’m so glad I’ll get to be with you for Regulus’ birth.”
“Pants off, Malfoy.”
“I’ll be ok alone. I don’t need Hermione. You’ll be back before this round wears off, right?”
to balance out everything that’s happened. And all this has been such a whirlwind, but everything just feels
“Since about seven.” Draco reaches to the bedside table and offers Harry a to-go cup from Costa and a paper bag from his favourite bakery. “I’ve been out and come back already.”
Though Draco seems sure that Narcissa will disapprove of them, Harry still hopes somewhere deep inside that she might eventually accept her son and his future husband, and maybe even their son. He can’t imagine ever rejecting any of their children the way she and the McLellands have rejected their sons. Draco is clearly happy with their life, and so is he, but he suspects his fiancé would be glad for his mother’s approval, should she offer it.
“Are you ready for this?”
“Draco proposed on New Year’s Eve. We’re—
By the time Hermione heads home that evening, there’s a tailor coming in the morning with a selection of robes, early afternoon has a jeweller scheduled to pick out wedding bands, and there’s a rough sketch done of the arch under which they will be married, which Hermione is taking care of. The younger kids have taken on the task of tidying up the garden, and James and Matthew have volunteered to contact several photographers so they can have pictures.
Harry steadfastly ignores the shouted questions and continues walking. Draco squeezes his hand.
Four heads nod and James rolls his eyes. “The press is ridiculous.”
Malfoy nods in understanding and observes Harry with a look of gentle expectation. Harry lets his eyes fall closed briefly as he sorts his emotions from the basic facts about the situation. He still rages when he lets it get the better of him, but this is neither the time nor place for that.
The noise Draco makes is something akin to a whimper as he slicks his cock and positions himself behind Harry. Harry murmurs a sticking charm on the chair as Draco’s blunt head presses against his hole. Pressing back, he stretches wide as the thick cock slides inside.
“Turn over,” Draco requests.
“We should be home in a couple of days. And I should finally not be nauseous.”
Staring intensely at the mirror, Harry watches each button of his shirt pop open under Draco’s skilful fingers. As the final button comes free of its hole, soft hands push his shirt open, putting his rounded belly on display.
“Hello, Harry,” she grins back, apparently feeling the same. “How are things going?”
She holds Harry’s wedding band flat in her palm, offering it to Draco.
“Do you think Scorpius will be ok with that?” Harry isn’t sure how his kids would feel spending their holiday away from home.
On Healer Carr’s fourth visit, she tells them that his membrane is nearly fully dilated, and his anal opening has started to soften. “This means contractions are going to get worse, but it also means you’re turning towards the home stretch. If your water breaks before I come back, take your Portkey to St Mungo’s. It could be any time.”
“We can certainly do that when the time comes. It would allow you more privacy and keep your father and I from knowing more than we’d rather.” Draco’s face looks exactly like Harry feels. He’d rather not know any more than he already does about his son’s bedroom preferences. “In the meantime, if there’s something you
“Albus and James both got one the summer after their first year. They use them to keep in touch with school friends over holidays.” Harry thinks for a moment. “I’ll probably get Lily one at Christmas.”
“I know. But let’s get home and get settled, yeah? That way, when he calls, you can give whatever support necessary.” Harry puts an arm around James’ shoulder. “I’m proud of you, son. You’re being a good partner to Matthew at a time he really needs it.”
“What’s going on?” Lily’s voice comes from the living room.
Draco withdraws from the kiss sooner than either of them would like, and they exchange places with Minerva.
“I’m quite worried, Harry. You seemed fine last night.”
“Thank you,” Matthew says, quietly.
“Yes. You and Al both can, actually.”
“I’m sorry.” Guilt tugs at Harry’s gut. He hadn’t meant to frighten his partner, but his body doesn’t always cooperate anymore.
“No.” Harry’s voice is firm. Absolutely nothing that could exit the Healer’s mouth would make him want to go through this without Draco. He squeezes Draco’s hand tightly and feels the returning pressure, finding it comforting. “Draco is my partner and my fiancé; I would prefer he be with me.”
“The fuckers didn’t even sign it Mom and Dad,” Draco spits venomously as he shakes his head. “I’m not at all surprised; this is exactly the kind of thing they were saying when I went to pick him up. For some reason, I held out hope that they would calm down, but clearly I was mistaken.”
“It’ll be fine once it’s all out there.” Draco rubs his back.
“Good luck. You’ll be fantastic. We’ll talk later, all right?”
“What?! No!” Draco seems almost offended by the suggestion. His voice is filled with shock when he continues. “Harry. You’re pregnant.”
“That’s quite normal during pregnancy, Al.” Harry tries to sound as reassuring as possible. “Exhaustion and vomiting are pretty much par for the course for the first 15 weeks or so, especially in male pregnancy. I’ve had a good deal of both.”
“When I made the decision to marry Astoria, I really thought I was giving that up.”
“Yeah. Like the summer before last when James waltzed in while I was cooking dinner and asked for detailed explanations of gay sex.”
“Or fingers, or tongues, or toys…” Harry laughs softly. “Or anything else that strikes your fancy, I guess.”
Harry nods. “Agreed.” He can’t believe how domestic this feels, and one glance at Draco’s dancing eyes tells him he’s feeling the same.
“That would be excellent. I do miss them.”
Scorpius snorts as the two boys move to stand beside Lily, both smiling down at Regulus.
“What’s going to happen to Matthew?” There are tears forming in Lily’s eyes and Harry moves to sit next to her, putting an arm around her slim frame. Lily has always been James’ little sidekick, and she adores Matthew just like she adores her big brother.
“Well, that can be remedied if you wish,” Harry laughs. Draco nods and Harry sets about popping the button and lowering the zipper before pushing Draco’s trousers over his tight arse and to the floor. Draco steps out of the puddle of fabric and Harry unashamedly takes all of Draco in.
“Neither did I,” Harry mumbles darkly.
“That’s a long time, Dad!” Al is clearly distraught at this timeframe. Harry takes a breath to explain but—
“We can start with the celestial name and see what fits?”
“Of course.”
“Of course.” James pauses at the door. “I love you, Dad.”
There’s a heavy silence before Draco’s voice continues.
“Maybe — someday — when we’re both ready, we can do it together?” Harry suggests hopefully.
“But then what?”
“No, actually,” Draco says carefully. “I thought they were rather horrible for invading your life like that, but I didn’t read them. I didn’t read much from the wizarding world at that point, honestly.”
“Oh Merlin, Draco, you feel so good inside me,” he murmurs. An uttered “
Harry feels the magic of the potion wash through him and finally opens his eyes. Concerned grey eyes meet his.
A triumphant scream has them both looking towards the pitch. Albus is holding his closed fist aloft, apparently having won their game.
“Yes. And we are both fairly certain we did well on our O.W.L.s. But if we want to study at the university level, we need to take some pretty stringent N.E.W.T.s.” James glances at Matthew. “I’m less worried about him, he’s brilliant, but I may need some extra help in Arithmancy. Maybe Herbology, too.”
the tea.” He uses the offered hand to pull himself off the couch and wraps his arms around Draco’s middle, dropping his head onto the man’s shoulder. “I may have a nap after we’re done with this checkup.”
She reaches into her bag once more and withdraws the imaging potion.
“I see.” Healer Carr’s attention returns to Harry. “You use mostly wandless magic?”
“Harry, please accept this ring as an outward symbol of our bond. With this ring, I thee wed.”
“Of course.” Harry traces his thumb over the soft skin of Draco’s hand. “I’m not one for holding back, Draco. I have extremely open communication with my kids and my friends and I’d like to continue that with you through…” Harry squeezes Draco’s hand and glances back at him.“…this.”
“Are we packing everything in this room?”
“There’s plenty.” Harry studies Draco’s face. Hermione hasn’t come over since Draco officially moved in. She knows, of course, and is supportive, but she’s not actually been to the house. “Would you be ok with her joining us?”
Harry’s internal monologue continues its raucous war inside his head. One side says to tell Malfoy, to let it out after eleven years. The other says to shove it back down in the dark corner of his soul inhabited by all the other losses he has endured; his parents, Sirius, victims of the war, Ginny. Telling someone — having someone besides Hermione who would know he really is completely alone now — is so tempting to Harry’s battered and lonely soul. And Malfoy has always been discreet enough with anything involving Albus.
“You’re growing a baby, Harry. It’s not fat.” Draco shakes his head. “Once the kids know, we can call a tailor.”
. “Or something involving protection against Dark Magic that doesn’t put me in danger; something different than the Aurors.”
“Then be glad your dad is a wizard and silencing charms are a thing. You won’t have to hear anything that may or may not be happening.”
Harry takes a moment to gather his thoughts. He really
“Any gemstones can be used,” Erwin assures them.
. Harry smiles to himself at the thought.
Harry hears movement behind him and then the slick blunt head of Draco’s cock is pressing at his entrance as hands steady his hips. The slow slide as he’s filled is burning, and pleasure, and like being whole again.
“Yes?” James answers.
“Evil motherfucker couldn’t even leave me alone after he died.” Harry snarls darkly.
“Morning,” Draco mumbles, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder. Harry chuckles. Draco is nearly non-functional before caffeine if he doesn’t get enough sleep, and they’d been up late the night before. Harry reaches over and plucks a mug of coffee from the countertop and presses it into Draco’s hands.
Draco smiles and kisses him. He stoops to the box on the floor and Harry watches as he withdraws a tiny glider chair. Setting it on the floor, he resizes it and levitates it to sit next to the window.
“Are you two ready?”
“The kids know,” Harry echoes. “I really do feel better now.”
Slow, steady thrusts of Harry’s tongue inside Draco’s arse set him to writhing under Harry’s ministrations. Emboldened, Harry works deeper, until Draco’s arse is dripping wet from Harry’s tongue and he is bucking back against Harry’s face. Enveloping Draco’s hard swollen cock in one fist, he begins to stroke it in time with the thrusts of his tongue.
want to hear us. I told her we would use silencing charms.”
“I think that sounds brilliant!”
“I don’t mind. You’re known to be a carrier, aren’t you, James?”
The thrilled smile on Draco’s face tells Harry everything he needs to know. The doors open and they make their way to the Apparition area. Harry wants to kiss Draco before they part, but even though the lobby seems empty, that’s just not a good idea. He smiles warmly at Draco. “I’ll see you soon.”
“We should have enough time for our walkthrough, then we can head in. Did you want to go to Wand and Wood for nursery furniture? Or someplace more baby-oriented?”
“Okay, so the spells that are running are checking your dad’s blood pressure and heart rate, the baby’s heart rate, and both of their stress levels.” She points out each spell and notates the results on her parchment. “Everything here looks well, and I’m pleased that your blood pressure is still down. The stress on your body remains lower, Mr Potter, so that’s also good.”
All three men turn at the sound of a train whistle which seems to signal Harry’s heart to begin racing even faster than before. He’s quite ready to see his children. Even with Draco as a distraction, he has missed them terribly.
?” Draco is clearly confused.
“You’re so much nicer than Woody,” he praises as she immediately lets him remove the parchment.
“I’m sorry?” Harry tries, desperately working to school his features into something that might pass for remorse.
“I’m right here. I’ll hold you together. You’re doing such a brilliant job, Harry. You’re so strong.”
“Do you think they’ll come around?”
“Yes, Harry,” Draco chuckles. “A date.”
Hermione lifts her beaded bag, which Harry is sure contains all their shrunken and lightened trunks.
Harry finally lifts his chin to look at Hermione, who has her eyebrows raised with a very amused smirk on her face.
Harry is unprepared for the full-faced smile that lights up Malfoy’s face. “Honestly, Potter, you have no idea what hearing that means to me. I was so misguided in my childhood.” Malfoy breathes a laugh, “I was a right spoiled little blood purist brat, honestly.”
“We can decide what we want to do as we go, then.”
