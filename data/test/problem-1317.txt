Blaise turned and walked straight through the purple fire.
"Oh, sorry, Zabini, didn't see you there. "
She had started to pin Draco's robe when a black haired girl came in.
Gringotts goblins insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied that same day.
Tom sighed softly, as he looked at his son peacefully asleep. As much as he wanted Salem to stay a kid while he still can, he knew it was inevitable with the war he planned to start with Dumbledore. It'll be dishonoring the wishes of his wife, Aelinor, forcing Salem to grow up faster than he should...
"Why's Bane so angry?" he asked. "What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?"
"Don't be stupid," said Blaise
To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:
Lord Voldemort paced outside of his bedroom door as he waited for his Elven wife to give birth to their son, Salem Salazar Riddle if it was a boy or Syndra Salazar Riddle if it was a girl, they agreed to call the babe.
" Yes, Father.." Salem responded and headed upstairs, back to his room. Tears were ready to fall out of his eyes at any given moment.
"Stop saying the name!" said Blaise in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Grindelwald could hear them.
Salem went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Crabbe was snoring loudly, but Salem couldn't sleep. He tried to empty his mind — he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours.
Blaise went speeding in the direction that Salem was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.
Spells
"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you," she said, once they were all gathered around her. Salem noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to Wood. Salem thought Wood looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Riddle for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.
A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. The group made for the counter.
Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Salem had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Blaise and Draco didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Salem. The idea of Grindelwald certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.
"Salem, you need your strength," said Adrian Pucey, a fifth year. "Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team. "
"I don't know... sounds like wings to me."
" Oh, I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't he? "
"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lack. Perched atop a mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.
Salem had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Slytherins in the lead. He'd done it.
"I think I'll leave it somewhere for Bulstrode to find — how about — up a tree?"
Salem nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this,Draco said, "That's just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one."
"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell," said Severus, taking a step toward him.
Salem shook his head, he closed his eyes the tears falling out of his eyes, he was soon embraced in a hug.
"I thought you weren't speaking to us?" said Salem.
He took a step forward towards Pansy.
Welp, there you have it.
"Good luck, Salem Riddle," said Firenze. "The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times. "
"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen."
Owls fly in from open windows, swooping down to their respective owner to deliver mail.  Salem's snow owl dropped the
"Quick, go, before it wears off."
"Dumbledore?" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Howell was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.
But leaving Pansy lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.
As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them.
"So light a fire!" Salem choked.
Salem's smirk widened. He paid the fourteen Galleons for his and Draco's wand. The group leaves to shop.
Salem got up from the couch and threw the letter in the fire before sitting back down and starting on his homework.
"You drink first," said Salem.
Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.
" Malfoy, Draco "
" M-mom?! "
He held them both close to his chest.
, he thought,
" Hold out your preferred arm. That's it. " He measured Salem from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to the floor, knee to armpit, and round his head. As he measured, he said, " Every Ollivander wand has a core of powerful magical substance, Mr. Riddle. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstring of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are the quite the same. And of course you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand. "
"I'm going to be a knight," said Draco.
" They're dead, " she said shortly. As if she didn't feel like going into the matter with the boy.
" Is there something wrong with our baby?"
But as they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.
" Indeed we are, Gringuss."
" I'd take you any time on my own, " said Weasley. " Tonight, if you want. Wizard's Duel. Wands only — no contact. What's the matter? Never heard of a wizard's duel before, mudblood?"
- Parseltongue
Friday was an important day for Salem and his group. They finally managed to find their way to the Great Hall without getting lost once.
"Salem? Hey, just look at me... Breathe."
Quirrell rounded on Salem.
He raised his wand.
Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.
" Yes Father?"
The father and son duo had appareted to
Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.
"Yes," said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. "He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, when I had Lord Grindelwald on my side..."
Said book is made by J.K. Rowling, I recommend reading the series.
"Oh, I thought we'd keep this private," said Severus, his voice icy. "Students aren't supposed to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after all. "
Salem had spotted Lucius waiting in a dark corner of the Station and wished all his Slytherin friends a great summer prior to heading over to Lucius with Draco. While the passed, Salem happened to hear other Slytherin students, even a few Ravenclaws gossiping to their parents about the Son of their Lord in Hogwarts, or even in their year.
Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, "The forest hides many secrets. "
"Firenze!" Bane thundered. "What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?"
Before it could reach Goyle's hand, Scabbers was stopped in mid-air.
The newly glamoured Tom had green eyes, black with a blue hue hair, and a chiseled jawline.
Weasley, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.
The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. Roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.
They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.
I had noticed that I hadn't really like the name Ebony when I was going back to edit my pieces of work. So I decide that it'll be best if I completely change the name Ebony completely with a name that I actually like. I hope you can like the name just as much as I do.
Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Salem turned to the other two.
"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!"
"Here I come," he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.
As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Rubeus Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.
Severus was sitting on his couch writing in a leather-bound journal that Salem had gotten him when he was nine. He was alarmed through magic when Salem and Draco had entered and tensed, on high alert, but as soon as he recognized their magical signature he relaxed, having them join him on the couch.
"Come back here, girl!" she shouted, but Millicent was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet. Salem saw her scared white face look down at the ground falling, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and  — WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Millicent lay face down on the grass in a heap. Her broom was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.
" Very well," He said. ( section deleted) " I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!"
"The forest?" he repeated, and he didn't sound quite as cool as usual. "We can't go in there at night — there's all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I heard. "
He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Quirrell, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.
They talked about their summer, and joked around. Salem took this time to think about what adventure his Father will put him through at Hogwarts, seeing as his Father's nemesis, Albus Dumbledore, is currently the headmaster there.
Salem read the paper several times. Then he walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to himself and pointing at them. At last, he clapped his hands.
" No, I don't know Malfoy."
" But do, be careful!"
"Stay there!" Draco said, and he sprinted up the stairs to the boys' dormitories. Salem and Blaise barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in his arms.
"Rubbish," said Severus, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. "Why would Quirrell do something like that?"
" Draco!" said Blaise suddenly, "Salem—"
"I'm worth twelve of you, Weasley," she sneered.
"Yes, yes, that's right," said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Salem. "Professor Snape told me all about the special circumstances, Riddle. And what model is it?"
" I did not. I'm not mad nor am I disappointed in you. " Tom glanced at Lucius, sending the silent message for he, Draco, and Severus to leave the room. Lucius gives a short nod at him, taking Draco's hand and leading the two others out of the room.
Salem saw that Hagrid looked very worried.
"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?"
"I know," Blaise snapped. "Don't nag. "
"Yes -- of course -- but there's no wood!" Draco cried, wringing his hands.
It was mid-afternoon when Salem and his friends had decided to go back to the dorms. But, Salem had something else different in mind...
After a short while, they heard panting from Lily as the baby was finally out of her stomach, but they didn't hear the baby..
" Yess, yes, yes. I tried to kill you. Your friend Mr. Malfoy accidentally knocked Filtwick over as he rushed to set fire to my robes at that Quidditch match. He broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd have got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you."
«-(¯'v'¯)-« σcтσвεя 31, 1981 »-(¯'v'¯)-»
It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Salem tried to turn back toward the Slytherin goal-posts -- he had half a mind to ask Flint to call time-out -- and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn't turn it. He couldn't direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.
She gasped. So did the people around her. About twenty ghost has streamed through the back wall. Pearly white, and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk saying: " Forgive and Forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance —"
____________________
He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco was shouting at Salem at how this was a Gryffindor move, and how he didn't want Salem to go after the Remembrall.
" I shall return when we are ready for you, " said Professor McGonagall. " Please wait quietly."
Salem had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered. . . Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Salem, Weasley, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.
"You want to watch out for Peeves," said Marcus. "The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects. though he usually leaves us Slytherins alone.Here we are." ( Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone- pgs 108-130)
Blaise couldn't get worked up, it was too hot.
Salem and Draco  went back to the common room, Salem had just said, "At least Blaise's on Snape's tail," when the portrait of the Snake swung open and Blaine came in.
Blaise's eyes were wide.
He ran back down to the common room.
" Trevor!" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up onto a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.
" Maple, and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try — "
"I bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you, eh?" he said, leering at them. "Oh yes. . . hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me. . . It's just a pity they let the old punishments die out. . . hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed. . . Right, off we go, and don't think of running off, now, it'll be worse for you if you do. "
"Not arguing, I hope, boys?" he squeaked.
Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet.
"He's doing something — jinxing the broom," said Draco.
A pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment pause —
"Well, it's true," Salem chortled as they reached the bottom
"I'm fine," said Salem, hardly knowing what he was saying. "The unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there. "
"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death."
"Use the boy... Use the boy..."
" I think I can tell who's the wrong sort are for myself, thanks, " She said coldly.
Salem Riddle and his friends sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling out names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they held none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold, empty and made you think of dark tunnels.
"Mom?" he whispered. "Dad?"
He softly kissed Salem's forehead, biding him a farewell, before taking his leave.
Draco shushed him, they could hear the doors of the Hospital wing slam open, an irritated Voldemort walking in, Severus and Lucius in heel.
"Go on then, try and hit me!" said Pansy, raising her fists. "I'm ready!"
"Riddle's been sent a broomstick, Professor," said Weasley quickly.
"Right, here's what we've got to do," he whispered urgently. "One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it.Blaise, you'd better do that."
"Yes, don't stop now," said Draco, "it's doing us so much good. "
" My Father's next door buying my books and Mother's up the street looking for wands. " said the boy, he had a bored, drawling voice. " Then I'm going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don't see why First years cant have their own. I think I'll bully Father into buying me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow."
He held his head up high, daring anyone to question his power as he walked up to his father, sitting on his throne with his head also held high, ready to curse any of his death eaters if need be.
"Looks like a harp," said Draco. "Snape must have left it there."
"Tom... Tom... he- he took—"
"We won! You won! We won!" shouted Draco, thumping Salem on the back. "And I gave Weasley a black eye, and Pansy tried to take on Finnigan and Dean single-handed! She's still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says she'll be all right -- talk about showing Gryffindor! I've waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, Howell and Fletcher stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens. "
"See?" said Draco, when Blaise had finished. "The dog must be guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!"
An owl hooted loudly, and Salem nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Severus say, " — your little bit of hocus-pocus. I'm waiting. "
____________________
The Great Hall was bursting with activity as all the students of Hogwarts filed in, sitting at their respective table. One student, in particular, sat at the Slytherin table, eating his bacon peacefully. Although that peace will not last long. This student's name was Salem Riddle, son of Lord Voldemort and Lady Elvira.
"Not if I can help it," said Draco grimly. "Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They're not throwing me out after that."
"Of course," said Quirrell coolly. "Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it again. Funny, really... he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular... and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you tonight."
Pansy's arms snapped to her sides. Her legs sprang together. Her whole body rigid, she swayed where she stood and then fell flat on her face, stiff as a board.
" But we don't feel like leaving, do we boys? We've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some. "
Salem knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Draco and Blaise were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Salem hardly heard a word of Flint's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest.Salem's victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure's prowling walk. Severus, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on?
The rest of the team landed next to Fletcher to cheer, too.
"That's your problem, isn't it?" said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. "Should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn't you?"
" I say, look at that man! " said the boy suddenly, nodding towards the front window, a giant man was standing there, grinning at the girl and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.
Salem grabbed his broom. He was afraid that he had gotten a little rusty,
Draco had gone first and, after going through a couple of different wands, gotten a 10" precisely, Hawthorn wood and with a  dragon heartstrings core. Now it was Salem's turn.
Blaise turned to Salem.
And he scooted off.
" The Violet Potter?"
" Mind telling me what the bloody hell that was?" Salem's voice was rather calm but held a strain on it.
"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,
" Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here."
Something happened that made Violet jump about a foot in the air — serval people behind her screamed.
- Parseltongue
¾ early so Salem and his group of friends can get a good compartment.
Salem slid off his back.
Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.
— lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed. "
Salem sat down, a house-elf appeared and laid his plate of food in front of him. A couple of minutes later he finishes.
"The whole school's out there!" said Howell Owler, peering out of the door. "Even — blimey —  Dumblefuck's come to watch!"
The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way towards the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Salem inwardly laughed at the other first years, not at his group of course, that shivered in the cold night air, having already a heating charm on his robes as well as on his groups' robes. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students (section deleted).
Salem pushed the door open.
Dumbledore sighs and pulls his wand out, Tom and Aelinor apparates before Dumbledore could do anything.
____________________
" Idiot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. " I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?
"B-but I d-d-don't--"
"I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid," said Filch coldly, they're here to be punished, after all. "
At last he found what he was looking for.
Today was the day where Tom and Aelinor would get their baby back from the Potter's nasty hands.
He turned his broomstick sharply to face Weasley in midair. Weasley looked stunned.
Salem recognized her as the girl from Madam Malkin's.
"Nicolas Flamel," he whispered dramatically, "is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone!"
"Wonder how long Riddle's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Zabini?"
"Say, Draco. We were at Diagon Alley on the 31 of July, correct?"
"But will it cover all three of us?" said Blaise.
Draco jumped to his feet. He hadn't looked so excited ever since his Father had told him where he was going for the break.
"The what?" said Blaise.
Words- Storyline
" Heads down!" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff, they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto the rocks and pebbles.
Salem, Draco, and Blaise were just walking around innocently before Blaise — although he wouldn't admit it — got them lost. They had heard Filch and his cat, Mrs. Norris coming around the corner.
With some interesting stuff,
It was as Salem dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He'd never felt anything like that.
Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.
The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Draco had already jumped. He landed on Salem's other side.
Your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight.
Before Blaise could say another word, Draco had disappeared. Blaise turned the binoculars back on Salem. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Beaters flew up to try and pull Salem safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good - every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Oliver Wood seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.
" It's either very valuable or really dangerous, " said Draco.
But Pansy was clearly steeling herself to do something desperate.
Draco and Blaise, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Pansy, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Salem know that Draco and Blaise had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They were ready to use it on Quirrell if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Salem.
"Do you mean," Salem croaked, "that was Grin-"
Salem headed on the scarlet train billowing smoke. He soon found the perfect compartment with Draco, Pansy Parkinson, Daphne Greengrass, Blaise Zabini, Gregory Goyle, and Vincent Crabbe already there.
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Salem and the rest of the team were changing into their green Quidditch robes (Gryffindor would be playing in scarlett).
"Who's there?" Hagrid called. "Show yerself -- I'm armed!"
"Salem... You may be my son, but that doesn't mean you need to be brave all the time, especially around me, or the peers you may trust along your journey." Tom vocalized.
Salem pushed it open.
"This way," said Salem, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took role call, When he reached Salem's name he gave a terrified squeak and toppled out of sight.
Salem stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.
"You're right Salem," said Draco in a small voice.
James Potter held Lily Potter's hand as she tried her best to push the baby out.
I recommend reading the series.
"Do you think it's a ghost?"
Words- Storyline
" It's alright Sal. You're going to be okay. . ."
"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts," said Hagrid fiercely. "Yeh've done wrong an' now yeh've got ter pay fer it. "
Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.
"Give it here," Salem called. "or I'll knock you off that broom!"
They landed quickly, and Salem ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned - it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.
No worries, this is not an April Fools
He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Salem saw the ghost of the Fat Friar wave merrily at her.
Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on the 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards and witches unknown.
" Hmm," said a small voice in his ear said. "Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, A my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting.... So where shall I put you?"
They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was —
At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Weasley, Blaise, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Weasley, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Blaise and grabbed him as a joke. Blaise had panicked and sent up the sparks.
He took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.
Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Salem to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Salem's question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Salem thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.
"NEVER!"
The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Salem would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Slytherin won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.
"We're not offended," said Salem quickly. "Just tell us what to do."
"Well, Salem, you take the place of that bishop, and Blaise, you next to him instead of that castle."
"Not Harry. . . not Violet, please no, take me, kill me instead —"
you  — might have broken your neck  —"
Draco was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.
"Don't play," said Blaise at once.
"Wow," Draco sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread.
Harry looked at the tiny bottle.
Salem blushed at the compliment.
No sooner were they out of earshot than Weasley burst into laughter.
" You two might as well get your uniforms at Madam Malkin's." Lucius pointed out.
"Snape wants the stone for Grindelwald. . . and Grindelwald's waiting in the forest. . . and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to betray my Father. . . "
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.
Salem turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he'd walk into a nightmare  — this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.
" No one here to save your sorry neck, Weasel. " Salem sneered.
"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?" Salem asked.
Weasley was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.
" My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not not even a ghost — I say, what are you all doing here?"
" Of course we're not, " said Salem, continuing to eat his breakfast. " I'll tell Severus later. "
Snape had soon let the first years go to their dorms after a " few words, " that became a speech to them.
Blaise followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Salem.
"I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought Severus was threatening you..."
(Section deleted)
Salem glares at Ron.
"What are you doing?" said a voice from the corner of the room. Pansy appeared from behind an armchair.
Draco dived, Blaise rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Salem streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Salem leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Draco and Blaise's cheers echoed around the high chamber.
"We're nearly there," he muttered suddenly. "Let me think — let me think..."
The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.
"Stop moving!" Draco ordered them. "I know what this is — it's Devil's Snare!"
Blaise couldn't resist.
" Thought you would have open a bool before coming, eh, Potter?"
Words- Storyline
"Thanks, Adrian," said Salem, watching Adrian pile ketchup on his sausages.
" Not really. "
" You tried to kill me!"
"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help," snarled Blaise, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. "Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!" said Draco.
" You're burning up."
"I'll be back at dawn," said Filch, "for what's left of them," he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.
"It's okay!" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, "it's a soft landing, you can jump!"
There was no alternative.
Draco started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Salem's knees were trembling. What if they lost?
By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.
"How?" said Blaise nervously.
Or young with scabby knees,
"You don't understand," said Salem, "this is important."
He glared at them all as if to say, "Or else. "
" Stick out your right hand over your broom," called Madam Hooch at the front, "and say 'Up!'"
At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Pansy in the common room and went down to the entrance hall. Filch was already there — and so was Weasley.
As the owls flooded into the Great Hall, as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.  Salem was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel,  and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl had dropped a letter on top of the parcel.
" Now we need to hurry to Ollivanders, Salem, your father already left he says he has important business that he needs to tend to now. " Lucius claims.
Salem grunts in agreement. They were making their way to the flat lawn opposite of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.
"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted Section. "
"It must wake up the moment you stop playing," said Salem. "Well, here goes..."
" My apologies, " said Salem. " but
"GRYFFINDOR!" shouted the hat.
"I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone first."
Weasley stopped dead in his tracks.
"What's this stuff?" were his first words.
"Professor Snape's refereeing?" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. "When's he ever refereed a Quidditch match? "
"Pretend to break your leg,"  Draco suggested.
They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.
Salem turned to the others.
one."
" Oh, yes. 20 points for bringing this to my attention, Salem."
"Come here," Quirrell repeated. "Look in the mirror and tell me what you see."
" Nothing. "
They had reached another door.
" Who are you and why are you here?"
Salem felt like he was floating in water, his eyes hard to open. When he finally did, he saw pitch black.
Salem looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn't afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.
The boys nod. She tells them to stand on the stool, and to put a long black robe on, which they complied.
" Just feel a bit under the weather. "
And learn until our brains all rot.
" Boot, Terry!"
She was a very pretty woman. She had bright blond hair and her eyes —
Professor McGonagall was again different. Salem had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.
"We're coming," said Draco.
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Wood and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Slytherin. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.
Draco grabbed the binoculars. Quirrell was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Salem and was muttering nonstop under his breath.
Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dusty colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'll whisk you off to Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghost. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.
" New students!" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. " About to be Sorted, I suppose?"
Draco now turned to Hagrid.
"Not fast enough," said Hagrid. "It's not easy ter catch a unicorn, they're powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before. "
Salem handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Draco began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.
- Parseltongue
Said book is owned by J.K. Rowling, I recommend reading the series.
"Yeah," said Blaise, "and lucky Salem doesn't lose his head in a crisis — 'there's no wood,' honestly."
just do your best, we'll do the rest,
"You're doing great, Lils." He said, but his word was drowned out by Lily screams.
"What if he's — ?"
- Parseltongue
He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Salem fell off. Salem got slowly to his feet.
Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.
" Boys, We must hurry your Father is waiting for you, Salem. "
(See the end of the chapter for
Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Salem, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face —
"Just a bit of toast," wheedled Blaise.
____________________
" Good, go do that then. " Voldemort's face disappears.
Salem leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Severus interrupted him.
A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.
" Not Harry, not Violet, please not Harry!"
" Do not call me your boy, I am and never will be your boy, there is no Harry Potter, this is my heir, not the Potter's." Tom sneered.
They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Salem, Draco and Blaise shivered slightly - the towering white chessmen had no faces.
After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Slytherins had anything to say to Salem, wanting their Lord's son to have some peace. Draco was skimming through all his notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Salem and Blaise didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.
Salem growled, " Enough! Malfoy, you and I need a serious talk. " With a flick of his left wrist, Scabbers hit the window. Salem stormed out, followed by an even paler Draco, Crabbe and Goyle.
"Oh, right!" said Draco, and he whipped out his wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of bluebell flames. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.
"Come on, Salem!" Blaise screamed, leaping onto his seat to watch as Salem sped straight at Severus — he didn't even notice Weasley and Draco rolling around under his seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Pansy, Finnigan, and Dean.
The ringing in his ears and his blurred vision had stopped at once, although the throbbing in his head remained.
" Double Potions with Gryffindor, " said Salem " Have mercy on Sevy's soul, he's going to go insane with Potter around. " Salem chuckles.
Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,
"Well, what are you all waiting for?" She barked. "Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up."
" James.. My baby... Where's my baby..?" Lily panted.
Salem got the message he was trying to send to Potter, he wants her and her little group to travel to he third-floor corridor on the right-hand side.
An hour later the train had started moving, Draco, Goyle, Crabbe and Salem all had gotten up to stretch their legs. While they walked down the train they heard excited whispers about Violet Potter being in the second compartment. Draco had suggested they go see if it true or not.
Millicent, her face tear-streaked, clutching her wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around her.
"Yes, but not to us," said Blaise in exasperation. " Pansy, you don't know what you're doing."
- Spells
"I'm sorry, Salem!" he wailed. "Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I've only just got away, I don't know where Snape went."
"Not Gryffindor or Hufflepuff, eh?" said the small voice. "Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Gryffindor will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you're sure -- better be SLYTHERIN!"
Spells
Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.
Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.
" I know, I know.. "
"Erm--"
Salem took it upon himself, opened a door and shoved everyone inside.
Draco ignored him, " Have
"You know what this means?" he finished breathlessly. "He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween. That's where he was going when we saw him — he's after whatever it's guarding. And I'd bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion."
Salem's eyelids felt heavy, he laid back on the pillow and fell slowly into unconsciousness.
The ghost didn't help, either. It was alway a nasty shock when one of them glided through a door you were trying to open. The Bloody Baron made sure Peeves stayed away from the First Years, he even pointed them in the right direction of a class when asked. But the Slytherins happened to see what Peeves were doing to the other First years in other Houses; drop wastepaper baskets on their heads, pull rugs from under their feet, pelt them with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind them, invisible, grab their nose, and screech, " GOT YOUR CONK!"
"What about you?"
There will be a five-chapter short story in between each of the main books. If you ever have suggestions on what they should contain please feel free to email or comment on one of the chapters!
If anyone is confused with the ending let me explain it. Salem's mom, Aelinor, was hit with an elvish spell named Hilfaquna, it's a sleeping spell that induces comas.
- Parseltongue
Draco clutched the sleeve of Salem's robe.
"Well?" said Quirrell impatiently. "What do you see?"
" Tom, my boy, put Harry Potter down, let us talk about this." A voice came from behind them, they turned to see who it was.
The Lord goes into the room where his elven wife, Aelinor, sat on the bed holding a baby boy. She smiles weakly at him.
Once Weasley had left, Daphne looks at Draco and Salem. " Please tell me you aren't going to go through with it. "
, Blaise! " For Blaise had been tugging on the sleeve of Salem's robe for the last minute. "
"Sometimes," he said, "I find it hard to follow my master's instructions — he is a great wizard and I am weak—"
A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.
"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried Dumbledore.Salem noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed.
" He thinks this door is locked,"  Salem whispered. " I think we'll be okay — get
"Of course not," said Draco briskly. "How do you think you'd get to the Stone without us? I'd better go and took through my books, there might be something useful..."
"Fluffy ?"
"Yes?" said Salem eagerly.
It was very difficult (for most). They all swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Finnigan got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.
Salem groans, putting away the mirror. Before heading off
- Spells
Draco had managed to free himself before the plant got a firm grip on him. Now he watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.
"Daphne, you can look!" Blaise said. Daphne had been sobbing into Blaise's robe for the last five minutes.
- Parseltongue
They walked past a mossy tree stump. Salem could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.
" RAVENCLAW!"
"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.
Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat. Salem and his group was shaking with laughter.
" Yes," said Violet, she was looking at Crabbe, who was standing beside Salem, and Goyle who was standing beside Draco.
Salem's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Draco's broom had also jumped straight into his hand, so did Potter's. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Idiots. A broom, like horses, can tell when you are afraid. Thought Salem; there was a quiver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.
" Potter!" said Snape suddenly. " What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
Draco and Salem always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Blaise said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. Daphne and Pansy were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. "No more studying," Blaise sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. "You could look more cheerful,Salem, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet."
Behind the white pieces they could see another door.
" Where on earth have you all been?" Daphne asked, looking at their robes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.
"Aha, Salem. The manor has been quite lonely without you here. So I must ask if you plan to come home for Yule?"
" I think he's brilliant," she said coldly.
Salem felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Quirrell who replied, "The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them. "
"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?" said Blaise.
He stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.
Lord Voldemort soon finished the meeting with his death eaters, he walked to the Living room where Salem, Draco Malfoy, Lucius Malfoy, Narcissa Malfoy, and Bellatrix Lestrange were quietly talking, waiting for him.
The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.
"Good evening to you, Hagrid," said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. "Were you going to shoot me?"
I do not own Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
"He is with me wherever I go," said Quirrell quietly. "I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Grindelwald showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me." Quirrell shivered suddenly. "He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me..."
Salem was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick — he hit the field on all fours — coughed — and something gold fell into his hand.
"So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone," Salem went on feverishly, "then Grindelwald will be able to come and finish me off. . . Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy. "
"We've heard," said Hagrid grumpily. "Well, if either of you do see anythin', let me know, won't yeh? We'll be off, then. "
"Do we — er — have to join you to get across?" The black knight nodded. Draco turned to the other two.
Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,
"I knew it," he murmured. "There's summat in here that shouldn' be. "
"Give me a minute."
Salem got off the stool and took the hat off his head, leaving the hat on the stool he walked over to the Slytherin table with pride, his chin still up, the Slytherin's above him bowed their heads as he past, recognizing him as Voldemort's son, those who dared not to bow their head would get a Crucio by his father.
" Im glad to see you are giving some worthy — advice, Flint. " A voice drawled from the shadows, causing few to jump.
And to Salem's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.
It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.
"Right. It's time. Good luck, all of you. "
" He's the gamekeeper. " Said the girl. She was liking the boy less and less every second.
(section deleted)
"All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward," said Hagrid. "So me, Salem, an' Draco'll go one way an' Ron, Blaise, an' Fang'll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an' practice now -- that's it -- an' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh -- so, be careful -- let's go. "
"Don't you call me an idiot!" said Pansy. " I don't think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!"
His mom... But his mom isn't alive... He felt something wet on his face, his hand went to touch it...
"Yes... " said Draco softly, "It's the only way... I've got to be taken."
" Or both, " said Salem.
He held out his hand to shake Violet's, but Violet didn't take it.
Our heads could do with filling
For now they're bare and full of air,
A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly notice the first years.
"Leave it to me. "
He looked in the mirror again. An elf-like woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air - she and the others existed only in the mirror.
"Dray—"
Griphook was yet another goblin,(section deleted) the group followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.
"  You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you. " said Salem coldly. There was nothing little about Finnigan and Thomas but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.
" Father..? W-what's wrong with Mother..? " Salem hesitantly ask, fearing the worst has happened.
The man, who is identified by James Potter, picked up the crying baby, he looks behind him and seeing a livid Tom Riddle, he apparates away before Tom could do anything.
" When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted," she said. " Abbott, Hannah! "
"Peeves," he said, in a hoarse whisper, "the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible."
"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it," Wood was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan wasn't happily shouting the results — Slytherin had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Salem heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Snape's chamber, with Draco and Blaise.
Salem jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn't believe it. He'd done it — the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Slytherins came spilling onto the field, he saw Severus land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped.
"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.
The group heads into Magical Menagerie. Salem instantly sees a snake that catches his interest. He identified it as a Black Mamba. Salem felt a special connection with him, he opens the cage, the snake slithering onto his arm instantly.
sαℓεм ιs ησω 6
"They're not birds!" Salem said suddenly. "They're keys! Winged keys — look carefully. So that must mean... " he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. "... yes — look! Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!"
I do not own Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.
"What can you see?" Blaise said anxiously.
"Okay, men," he said. "This is the best team Slytherin's had in years. We're going to win. I know it. "
Draco took a different view of things. He was torn between horror at the idea of Salem being out of bed ("If Filch had caught you!"), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.
Draco went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.
" Mama? Papa? " Salem spoke.
At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a serpent.
____________________
Salem had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.
" Typical," Said Draco darkly. " That they would place Gryffindor and Slytherin together. It's almost like they beg for a fight to break out, but I would like to see that Weasel make a fool of himself on a broomstick. "
" That's Hagrid, "  Said the girl, pleased to know something that the boy didn't. " He works at Hogwarts. "
" Ooh, sticking up for Bulstrode? " Said Seamus Finnigan. " Never thought you'd like fat little babies, Zabini."
The high voice spoke again.
"That one!" he called to the others. "That big one — there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side."
"Do you want to stop Snape or not?"
"These birds... they can't be here just for decoration," said Draco.
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.
" Sit down, " He snapped at Hermione. " Riddle, care to answer my questions. "
Weasley smiled nastily.
" The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can as you are waiting."
Before leaving his room, he slipped a black mask on as well as Slytherin green robes.
Hardly anyone had seen Salem play because Flint had decided that, as their secret weapon, Salem should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and  Salem didn't know which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.
If I'm being honest I don't know who wrote it now
"You are the Lord's so," he said. "You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time — especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.
And Salem let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and —
" What have we got today? " Draco asked Salem as he poured sugar on his porridge.
"Go to Madam Pomfrey," Draco suggested.
Madam Hooch was bending over Millicent, her face as white as her's.
Salem's elf ears had perked up but he decides to leave it alone, heading to the library before going back to the Slytherin common room.
WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Slytherin below — Oliver Wood had blocked Salem on purpose, and Salem's broom spun off course, Salem holding on for dear life.
They marched off across the dark grounds.  Salem wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted.
"We've got to close in on it!" Salem called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. " Draco, you come at it from above Blaise, stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it. Right, NOW!"
"Yeah, but I was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid. "So yeh haven't noticed anythin' strange?"
into Salem's lap. He picks it up flips through the pages, soon finding an intriguing article.
It was only then that Salem realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.
Madam Malkin had rushed her onto a stool, she had slipped a long black robe over her head just like the two other boys.
" Yes. "said the girl.
Salem did have his own an owl hat he barely used, but his Father did. His snowy owl dropped a letter in his lap and accepted a piece of toast before flying away. On the front of the letter it said not to open the letter until he was alone. Salem knew it was from his Father it was in his neat scripted handwriting.
He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.
Slytherins cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Gryffindors.
There was a tap at the window that Salem decided to ignore. The tapping had grown intense causing Salem to finally look at the window. It was a barn owl holding a letter within their beak. Salem heads to the window and opens it, he took the letter and inspects it.
"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!" said Blaise. "No wonder Quirrell's after it! Anyone would want it. "
"I knew it! I knew it!"
The Gryffindor table bursted into the loudest cheers, shouting; " We got Potter! We got Potter! "
Salem, Draco and Blaise headed downstairs, smothering their laughter at Weasley's obvious rage and confusion.
"No, I don't!"
Salem had never believed he would meet someone he would utterly hate,  but that was before he met Violet Potter. Still, first-year Slytherins only had Potions with Gryffindors, so they wouldn't have to put up with Potter much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Slytherin common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday — and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.
Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Salem had to grab his shoulders to stay on.
Mr. Ollivander fixed Salem with his pale stare.
" Say that again, " Ron said, his face as red as his hair.
Salem and Draco now stood in the boy's bathroom, Draco was cowering against the wall as Salem glared and sneered at him.
Blaise was wide-eyed as Salem began to tell him and Draco what had happened in the forest.
Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.
— in all my time at Hogwarts  — "
"I'm warning you, Weasley —one more word—"
There weren't many people left now. "Moon" "Nott" "Parkinson" then a pair of twin girls, "Patil" and "Patil" then "Perks, Sally-Anne" and then, at last -- "Potter, Violet"
Later
"Mount your brooms, please. "
got your own broom?"
" Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My Father told me that all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children then they can afford. "
"JORDAN!"
"Snape's," said Salem. "What do we have to do?"
" That's a broomstick," he said, throwing it back to Salem with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. " You'll be in it for this time, Riddle, first years aren't allowed them."
Sometimes, Salem noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. "Finnigan, Seamus," the sandy-haired boy next to Salem in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.
A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.
" This is Crabbe, and this is Goyle. " Said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Violet was looking. " I'm Malfoy, Draco Malfoy. "
But  Millicent, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips.
Salem lied in his bed thinking about it, his heart fluttering when he pictured Draco.
As the match drew nearer, however, Salem became more and more nervous, whatever he told  Blaise and Draco. The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either. The idea of keeping the house championship was wonderful. Hopefully Severus would help them cheat into it.
Salem listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.
" Firs' years! Firs' years over here! All right there, Violet? "
"Very nice," said Flint, his eyes glinting. "I see what Snape meant. . . you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week. "
"I'm not ill," said Salem. "I think it's a warning... it means danger's coming..."
Salem couldn't stop himself from rolling his eyes.
Salem tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it,  too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.
"What? Where?"
"Good evening," said Ronan. "Students, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?"
Salem was mad at both Draco and Blaise, they had gotten them all detention by sneaking into the kitchens that night. But to Draco's pleasure, Weasley had gotten detention too.
" Broken wrist," Salem heard her mutter. " Come  on, girl — it's alright, up you get."
" Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember. . . . I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Riddle. . . . After all. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things, terrible, yes,  but great." (- Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone pgs. 71-85 )
." He casually passes him the letter. Tom inspects the letter seeing the Hogwarts crest and sneering.
"He'll be all right," said Salem, trying to convince himself. "What do you reckon's next?"
"Why me?"
Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,
" Shut up, Weasel. "  snapped Blaise.
The duo traveled to the dungeons of Hogwarts, soon getting to Snape's chambers. McGonagall knocks on the door before hearing Snape's voice call out for them to come in.
The boys had given up sooner than expected. No one had came to the third corridor.
"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. "Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest. "
"See you in a minute, I hope..."
"Nothing — just black — there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop."
"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch," Flint had said. "We don't want you attacked before you have to be. "
". . . d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus. . . "
" Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?" Malfoy sneered.
He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down... down... down...
And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smoothed as glass. Most was silent, staring up at the great castle ahead. It toward over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.
"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone," Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. "Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this... but he's in London... I'll be far away by the time he gets back..."
Before the girl could answer, Madam Malkin said, " That's you done, my dears. " The boys hopped down from the barstool.
" My Lord, " The goblin had lowered his head in a bow.
"You let the troll in, during Halloween?"
"No —but it's like ice."
She was blasted back to the wall hitting the floor with a thud, blood gushing out of her stomach.

"Don't want to pressure you, Riddle, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it's now. "

Draco had fought his way across to the stand where Quirrell stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; he didn't even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Flitwick headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Quirrell, he crouched down, pulled out his wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from his wand onto the hem of Quirrell's robes.
Unfortunately, my laptop has completely died from a shot battery. Although this has happen I will try my best to get the last chapter out to you guys, this could delay when I planned to post it. So please, I ask you to remain patience and not to give up on this book. Until then.
Salem sat bored in his room, still pouting that he couldn't go to the raid with his father and mother. Draco Malfoy was also there, but there was nothing for the two adolescent boys to do.
" The password is Salazar. " said Marcus, the portrait swung open to reveal a passageway in the wall. They went through it — and they found themselves in the Slytherin common room. It was a large room sporting a several shades of green and adorned with portraits of serpents.
Snape's lips curled into a sneer.
" Your Mother was hit with a spell that I do not know of, yet, Salem. For now, you need to go back to your room. "
But he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn't moving his lips.
"We'd noticed," said Salem faintly.
" Now, form a line," Professor McGonagall told the fist years, " and follow me."
" Give that here, Weasley." said Salem quietly, his voice louder than a whisper. Everyone stopped talking to watch.
Dead flies and bits of fluff,
" —lem? Salem! " A voice had called out.
Draco slid the compartment door open. There was a girl — Violet Potter — and a Weasley sitting opposite from each other.
"Don't be a fool," snarled the face. "Better save your own life and join me... or you'll meet the same end as your mother and soon your father... He will die, begging me for mercy..."
"Mars is bright tonight," Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. "Unusually bright. "
"Are you all right?" said the centaur, pulling Salem to his feet.
"—tell yer that's how it is at Hogwarts," Hagrid growled. "Copyin' lines! What good's that ter anyone? Yeh'll do summat useful or yeh'll get out. If yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an' pack. Go on. "
Salem took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought is swishing down through the dust air and a stream of green and sliver sparks shot from the end forming the shape of a snake, throwing dancing spots of light onto the walls. The adults and Draco politely clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried out, " Oh bravo! Yes, indeed, oh very good. Well, well, well. . . how curious, how very curious. . . "
Salem had found his dorm he was paired with Draco, Theodore Nott, and Blaise. Entering the dorm room, he found the room full of his, and roommates articles.  He plopped his entire body down on the bed, feeling the day's exhaustion catch up on him.  Asmodeus slithered in next to him, coiling.
" Tut, tut— fame clearly isn't everything. "
" Hogwarts, dear?"  she said. (section deleted)
" Good morning, Father. " Salem greeted, his father was reading the Daily Prophet, sipping his coffee.
Before Weasley
He sat back down. Everybody — except the Slytherin's — clapped and cheered. Salem sneered quietly.
"Oh, let's kick her, just this once," Blaise whispered in Salem's ear, but Salem shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything.
" The only good thing is that Sevy is refereeing." Salem had said.
Suddenly, people were pointing up at Salem all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped.  Salem's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.
"There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang," said Hagrid. "An' keep ter the path. Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night at least. "
Fletcher Grace really did fall off his broom at these words.
(See the end of the chapter for
Salem suddenly realized  that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.
" You did great Minny, I must applaud you on your performance." Salem praises.
" Oh, yeah?" said Weasley, trying to sneer, but looking worried.  Salem leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot towards Weasley like a javelin. Weasley only just got out of the way in time; Salem made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady.  A few people clapped below.
" Salem... My son... " A voice called out through the silence.
"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?" Salem gasped.
"Now what do we do?" Salem whispered.
"I won't let you do it," she said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait. "I'll —I'll fight you!"
____________________
Salem was soon done and let go, she pulled her bra and her shirt up. Aelinor put him inside of his crib, not before kissing him on the forehead.
"Sorry, Professor. "
The Dark Lord and Lady walked up to the house of the Potters in Godric's Hollow. Tom blasted the door away.
"I don't understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?"
Salem rolled his eyes, " As always. " he drawled out.
Salem didn't have a clue what was going on.
"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Draco," said Salem as he joined him by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.
So Salem set off into the heart of the forest with Weasley and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Salem thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Salem could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.
Salem and Blaise stayed quiet, watching Draco think. Finally he said, "Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess--"
" Mr. and Mrs. Potter, a word please?" A healer said.
Salem was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.
The door swung open at once. A tall, black haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Salem instantly knew that he had to get on her good side, as this witch was not someone to cross.
Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Draco noticed, too.
" The firs' year, Professor McGonagall, " said Hagrid.
Tom sits on the side of the bed, his right-hand rests itself on Salem's forehead, trying to sense temperature. Salem's eyes widen, this was the first time that Tom had shown his fatherly side ever since they lost his mother.
" Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts," she said. " Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned. "
He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.
Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.
Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Severus, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell was there, too. Salem couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Salem strained to catch what they were saying.
Salem felt terrible. In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field.
"Which one will get me back through the purple flames?"
Instead of the brown-haired and hazel-eyed male answering with words he cast a spell on her, "
Lee was still commentating.
" HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.
Nobody answered.
" Actually, Father, that is exactly why I called you. To ask if I am wanted at the Manor. "
Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.
He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next — but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.
"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?"
He burst into the Great Hall, where his Father currently resided, with his Outer Circle.
As the group of our favorite Slytherins climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Salem's mind was racing and his spirits were high. He'd gained 20 points for Slytherin in his very first week — Snape really does love him.
And Quirrell, though pinning Salem to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms —Salem could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
"I don't want anything. "
They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.
"Look!" Blaise seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Salem looked over her shoulder to read it:
"Can't have," Draco said, his voice shaking. "Can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand. "
Salem had spent hours upon hours in Riddle Manor's library for Yule break, and he had found nothing. Complaining to Draco the whole train ride back to Hogwarts. Salem had also talked to his Father about the mirror of erised. He had banned him from going back to it. Salem wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents killing in a flash of green light, while their voices cackled with laughter.
"I'm not going in that forest," he said, and Salem agreed with him.
Salem let out a great sigh and Blaise, amazed, saw that he was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.
"Are we allowed to speak yet?" said Blasie grumpily. Draco ignored him.
They laugh. Just then, the mail arrived. Salem had gotten use to the sound by now, but it had given him quite a headache on the first morning, when a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall, making he noise even louder.
" I don't know, sir, " said Violet.
" Yeah. What about it?"
Salem had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Blasie stood up, as  Salem streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
"Do you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?" said Salem.
" Salem, before we leave to the Platform, I have a— gift for you."
Salem walked toward him.
"You two wait here!" Hagrid shouted. "Stay on the path, I'll come back for yeh!"
"It's obvious, isn't it?" said Draco. "We've got to play our way across the room."
" Well now — Mr. Riddle. Let me see. " He pulled out a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. " Which is your wand arm? "
"Always the innocent are the first victims," he said. "So it has been for ages past, so it is now. "
The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Salem and Draco were still discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one.
There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Salem looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?
" She cast on the other baby. The spell rebounded and came after Aelinor, who blocked said curse with powerful Elfish magic, leaving the baby unconscious and nothing but a lightning bolt scar on her forehead.
" Yes, exactly. I heard he's sort of a
"Yes  — he's Hagrid's — bought him off a Greek chappie he met in the pub last year — He lent him to Dumbledore to guard the—"
"All right?" Salem whispered.
Not for nothing, though, was Salem the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.
UPDATES 6/7/20 (7/6/20)
"Ready?" Draco called, his face pale but determined. "Here I go — now, don't hang around once you've won."
"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too."
Potions lesson took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder her than up in the main castle, — luck enough, Salem already had the heating charm on his robes and his friends — and would have been creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
Tom goes over to Aelinor and uses Parseltongue to heal Aelinor.
"Lucky this plant thing's here, really," said Blaise.
" I must say, Weasley, there's no pleasure in seeing you.  "
"I've never seen Severus look so mean," he told Draco. "Look — they're off. Ouch!"
Aelinor turned around when she felt a presence, that wasn't Tom's, his scent smelt like chocolate this one smelt like roasted nuts , behind her.
We're almost at the end. There will be a five-chapter side book between the main books.
Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously. "  — how
Salem woke up at the crack of dawn on September 1. He smartens himself up with a dark forest green robe with silver fastenings. As soon as he finished he headed downstairs into the Dining Hall.
At these words, Blaise seized Draco's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Salem, he started looking frantically at the crowd.
The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them, Salem, Draco, and Blaise, were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Quirrell crossed the yard. Salem noticed at once that Quirrell was limping.
A few minutes later, Salem heard the wards go off. He got up and left the room going down the stairs he saw his Father carrying his Mother, who appeared to be passed out, or even worse dead...
But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;
" Oy, you there! Is this your toad?" Said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.
Salem guess was correct, she is a Half-blood, living with Muggles, and haven't known a single think about the Magical World until now.
He pushed the book toward them, and Blaise read:
Salem was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Flint's game plan.
Quirrell's voice trailed away. Salem was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley — maybe he had seen Quirrell there..?
вσυη∂ε∂тяι∂εηт
"I have strength enough... for this..."
" Of course you can, Salem! You're the smartest wizard of our age! You're better than most of the 7th years! " Blaise gushed.
Flint was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. Pucey had complained that Flint was becoming a fanatic, but Salem was on Flint's side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would win the house championship again for the eighth. Quite apart from wanting to win, Salem found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.
"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it likes the dark and the damp."
Salem never dropped his Pure-Blood etiquette while they walked into the Great Hall. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets.At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candle-light. Dotted here and there among there students, the ghost shone misty sliver. But even with hundreds of faces staring at him, Salem did not drop his etiquette. Although he heard a girl whisper, with his ears it was impossible for people to have their own privacy while he was around, seeing as his mother was never around to teach him to block it out, " It's bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in
Keep Reading to find out if she wakes or not!
There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.
Salem hadn't noticed, he felt cold. He looked up at his dad...
." he whispers, pointing it at Pansy.
He sat next to Draco and Pansy, at the end of their table.
