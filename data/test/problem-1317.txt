Harry closed his eyes. He expected this from Hermione, sure. From Ron, a bit. From Molly Weasley. But from Draco bloody Malfoy? "Well, maybe you should brew better potions."
"You need to keep better track of the time. What if this happens while you're -- while you're driving?"
"For providing me with the chance to demonstrate my answer, by giving you detention. Just you, no one else."
The cane with which she emerged was, to Harry’s total delight, ordinary-looking in the extreme. It was just a very nice wooden cane with a flattish, downward-curving handle and a sensible rubber tip – not much different, in fact, than the one he had stowed away in his bedroom at Hogwarts, though this one was clearly made of nicer wood. When he looked closely he could see that the grain swirled and glowed beneath the unobtrusive matte finish.
“I’m not the one who can’t sit up under his own steam,” Draco pointed out, pulling a chair up to the side of the couch and sinking into it gracefully. There was something strange about his appearance and it took Harry a moment to realize that someone had put him in an oversized hooded sportsball sweatshirt, so different from his usual carefully-chosen clothing that Harry couldn’t help but smile.
At least one thing hadn't changed from his time at Hogwarts, he thought, stretching his leg out and digging his hand into the tight muscles around his hip. Hormones.
"Thirty diamond-plated vials worth," Harry said, and mustered up enough energy to try a grin at Malfoy, who did not grin back, though he didn't scowl, either. "Sorry about that, by the way, I didn't know."
He could see from Neville’s anxious face that he wasn’t putting on the best show, but sod it, he was so tired of performing day in and day out. Let Neville worry for an evening; it wouldn’t kill him.
"Okay and so what you're looking for is a cane that can conceal your wand in its handle, right? With some kind of mechanism for easy access, that's what Draco told me."
Come Monday the rain had stopped and, thank Merlin, the pain had loosened its grip somewhat. He took a double-dose of potion to get through his classes and while his shoulder was still worse than usual, his fingers were a little more responsive and his leg held his weight well enough that he didn’t have to Lock it.
At the door, he knocked out a bright rhythm and arranged a sheepish smile on his face; he was a Muggle motorist, out of petrol, he was harmless, he was friendly, he was absolutely under no circumstances a famously hotheaded wizard come to destroy anyone who got between himself and Draco Malfoy.
Well, fine. He could do without until he figured out what to do. Was it ideal, no, it wasn't ideal. Did this current batch of poorly-made potion have an absolute nightmare of withdrawal, yes, it did. Maybe the smartest thing to do would be cancel his classes tomorrow, take a sick day, and stop taking this batch as soon as possible. Get the effects out of his system so he'd just be normally-in-pain by the following day. Yes: that was exactly what he'd do.
Instantly he was awake, wand at the ready. Someone was coming through the little path in the trees, someone in blue shorts, their pale legs long and lean, with a white shirt and pale white face. Draco Malfoy, a red towel slung around his neck, pulled up short when he saw Harry.
"That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me," Harry said. The rain was falling more thickly now, big fat drops that slid down the back of Harry's coat and made him shiver. They were standing outside the Three Broomsticks and he could hear laughter coming from inside, could anticipate the warmth and the smoky smell and the taste of mead, and how good it would be to see Ron and Hermione and Rosie. But despite all that, despite the rain, he found that he was in no hurry.
"Ron," Harry pleaded, but the man was already standing up -- and up, and up. He was very tall, very muscled, very bearded, and he was scowling down at Harry.
Harry stared, then broke out laughing. "You know, I'd forgotten it was even a possibility. You get used to going without, at Hogwarts. Where's Hermione?"
“I didn’t know that was still happening to him,” Neville said unhappily. “Poor bloke. D’you really think you can figure out who’s been sending them?”
married name of the Squib formerly called Lizzie Goyle. Her Muggle husband must be – no, had to be – Dougie Debs, who owned this bar. As Harry had told Neville earlier, there was no such thing as a coincidence.
He fixed Draco’s face firmly in his mind: the sardonic eyebrows, those ice-blue eyes, the mouth that could be sneering or sweet. He had to be all right. If he wasn’t, Harry would tear the world apart.
It was so good to see Draco that Harry had managed to forget how very not-good everything else felt, and he tried again to sit upright but stopped, grunting a little in pain. He fell back against the cushions, fighting a wave of panic.
Phil slumped unconscious, and Harry rolled off him just as the bartender vaulted over the bar. “Stupefy!” Harry said again, and the barkeep froze mid-leap and collapsed – right on Harry’s bad leg. His vision went grey for a second, then re-racked. “Levicorpus,” he gritted out, and as soon as the bartender’s heavy body had lifted, he dragged himself out from under and let the man fall again. Craig, lying beneath the fallen lamp, seemed very much down for the count, but just in case, Harry aimed his wand and stupefied him as well. He didn’t trust a lamp to do a wand’s job.
Gibson Ackley, pureblood, Voldemort champion, had lost his fortune in the war and never gotten over it. He'd been one of three wizards who'd devised the meticulous, years-in-the-making plan to capture Harry, torture him, cripple him, and obliviate him so thoroughly he'd be left mindless and broken. They'd fully succeeded at the first two jobs; gotten halfway through the third; and failed the fourth. Harry, wandless and barely conscious, had exploded Gibson Ackley's head.
"D’you think McGonagall would let me go down this weekend?” Harry said. It was an infuriating part of the job that the professors were not only teachers, but de facto guardians, and getting leave to abandon their charges was a long, tedious, and often unsuccessful process.
Malfoy looked surprised and caught-out, and Harry gave him a cheeky grin as he made his way back to the Floo. It cheered him a bit to think of elegant Malfoy swooping about with a whistle.
"Hullo, Professor," she said. "I only wanted -- to give you --" She darted forward and put the card on his bed, then turned to flee.
"Actually, no," said Harry. "Believe me, I wish I could sit here and happily tell you how awful he is, but... he's been decidedly... not."
"Right," Harry said, when Malfoy's hilarity (and Neville's trembles) had wound down. "Er, Neville, maybe you ought to open the door."
On Monday, Harry had the delightful experience of making an entire classroom of first years scream when he staggered out of the new Floo system in the classroom's hitherto unused fireplace. He patted soot from his robes and limped to his desk, moving carefully, not eager to fall again anytime soon. But Malfoy's potion was so far proving excellent; he had more range of motion in his hip and was able to lift his arm higher than he had in recent memory.
"Ignore him, Professor," Hanna said, poking Jacob's prone body with a toe. "He's just very excitable."
“I’m not waiting an hour and half,” Harry said. “Malfoy could be – it could be too late by then. It might be too late now.”
The day was hot, the air still, the lake serene. Harry felt himself getting drowsy and he dropped his quill so he could pick up his wand, guiding the earth beneath him to lower him down into a more supine position. Perfect white fluffy clouds drifted sheeplike across the sky. He felt sleepy and comfortable and just this side of too-hot in jeans and a button-up shirt, and he'd taken off his shoes to feel the soft grass beneath his feet. He'd just nodded off when he heard someone humming.
He hadn't taken dinner in the Great Hall since the first week, too tired and achy by the end of the day to want to be around people. But he felt not bad at the moment, actually, potion still going strong, so why not?
“What about this?” Neville said, holding open a file so Harry could see it. It was labeled “In Search Of” and appeared to be a list of rare supplies and what they might be used for. Sure enough, near the top of the list was “Finicky Rattler Venom: eyelash growth; teeth strengthening; resistance to sunburn; flexibility (HP?)”
Malfoy was indeed making his way towards them, looking as put-together as always but with a bit of a tired blue shadow under his eyes, and Harry found himself grinning. They'd made a rather sizeable dent in the bottle of that catnip whiskey and had ended up in the library at 3am trying to find a book to settle a bet about the origins of the "accio" charm. Harry knew they'd figured it out eventually but he couldn't remember who'd won.
"I haven't had any yet," he said -- which was a lie, there was a slice half-eaten on his plate. Had he been trying to save Harry the awkwardness of magicking what anyone else would simply have taken? Was this his way of trying to make up the argument they'd had the other day about his arm? And since when did Malfoy try and make it up to anyone, for anything?
But neither of them did. Instead, they rode back to the castle in silence. Together, apart, they stared out the windows into the velvet, star-streaked night.
“Oh, sod off, all of you,” Harry muttered. He blinked at the Dracos who were sauntering over, four arms crossed over two ridiculous Muggle sweatshirts, two black eyes, two nose studs on two perfect noses. Dizzy, Harry shut his eye again and squinted up. Draco was singular again. “Are you all right?”
"No," McGonagall said with dignity. "I mean, yes, I'd prefer a more civilized discourse in general, but -- I'm not going to sack you."
ever was, at least not in this sense. I had all sorts of questions about Dumbledore, of course, but neither his nor McGonagall’s nor
Malfoy didn't say anything, and Harry tried to catch his breath, tried to calm down. They were nearly to the castle now and he was limping so badly he knocked into Malfoy every time he pulled weight off his bad leg.
Neville pressed a big hand to Harry's forehead. "I don't think you have a fever, though you are a bit sweaty. Should I call -- someone? Hermione?"
Malfoy seemed encouraged by his silence and said, "If it interests you, you could make an appointment with Betsy in Hogsmeade this weekend. I just thought, since we'll be going anyway..."
"What," he said, looking around at them, "are you fighting, already? Why aren't you chattering to one another?"
Malfoy was nearly smiling when he handed back the picture. "Granger's genes seem to be fighting a losing battle."
Malfoy was still laughing when Neville, who clearly -- and reasonably -- seemed not amused but properly terrified, yanked them back and slammed the door.
And lastly, well, pain... it was personal. It permeated everything Harry did, it dictated how he lived his days, he spent an inordinate amount of time trying to cater to his pain, and even though anyone who looked at him could probably see his pain, it still felt oddly private. He wanted to keep it to himself, he wanted to hide it. The Healers at St. Mungo's were professionals, they were impersonal -- but Malfoy? With Malfoy, it'd be personal.
Harry nearly protested -- if it really was an obstacle course, he'd have liked to give it a go! -- but then realized how much more ammunition he'd be giving Malfoy if he admitted to this, and kept a dignified silence instead.
“Healer Kevari,” Draco said, sitting upright on his chair. His voice was perfectly even, perfectly mannered, and he wiped his chin neatly with his sleeve, like a gentleman at dinner. “How nice to see you.”
Harry felt a great rush of rage and envy and sadness pouring up from his chest and belly and lodging in his throat like a stone. He looked away from the faraway Seeker -- it was too much like looking into the sun, beautiful and blinding. The walk was taking its toll on him and he was getting tired, the worst of his pain kept at bay by Malfoy's potion but only just, and he could feel his limp growing heavier with each step, as if the sight of the Seeker had robbed him of precious stamina.
He woke up on Wednesday morning of his third week of classes with one potion remaining, and knew his time was up. He had to break into the Potions office that very night or suffer the consequences, which would require a bit of reconnaissance work, which would require going into the Potions office during daylight hours, which would require talking to Draco Malfoy, which was another reason Harry'd put this off for so long.
On Monday of that week, Harry received an owl from Betsy informing him that his new cane was ready. It also informed him that she'd eaten cake for breakfast, that she was thinking of making a violin that played bird songs, and that she'd recently read an excellent Muggle novel about a Black woman who'd traveled back in time and been forced to reckon with both the legacy of American slavery and her white slave-owning ancestors, and did Harry think it was possible the author had gotten her hands on a time-turner?
“You’ll want to limit it as much as possible, I’m afraid; it may keep you up but it’s putting undue strain on your hip, which’ll sideline you in the long run. But that’s a conversation for another time. For today, we’ll use a variation on that same Locking charm for your shoulder, but it’s absolutely imperative to have it in the right position before you Lock it, so pay close attention, all right?”
“Well, thanks,” Harry said, trying to put on a smile and failing. He was so sick of being so grumpy, but he couldn’t seem to help himself sometimes. It was a ruthless combination of being in pain and tired from being in pain – compounded by his hopeless attraction to the co-worker and former enemy who was right now buttering a piece of bread, totally innocent to the fact that even watching him do this stupid, simple, everyday task was making Harry feel like he was about to explode from frustrated desire.
Neville looked at him. "I've told you, he's not like he was, Harry. I think he's put in a lot of work to leave that part of his life behind."
Hanna was at the back of the group, her arms folded and eyes rolling like she was above whatever nonsense was being performed, and he looked to her pleadingly. She gave him a small shrug: you're on your own.
“All this –” Neville flapped his hands “—this Healer nonsense about – about Draco only caring about you because you’re – whatever awful thing you said – a
"It's not a point, it's just an idea. But you could commission someone to put your wand inside a cane."
They had another round of drinks and played another game, Harry and Neville again against Malfoy, and again they were soundly trounced.
Malfoy's eyes flashed. "I'm not insulting your masculinity, Potter, I'm asking a purely physical question about what's keeping you from standing. Pain? Or weakness?"
"I didn't know you were a real person," said Timmy defensively. "I mean, I knew, but -- but I didn't
"I was hoping we'd have more time before the Start-of-Term feast," she said, starting off down the hall with no fanfare, "but we've little under an hour so your tour will have to be quick."
"Also," Malfoy went on, as if determined to get something out, "I haven't forgotten that you saved my life. In the Room of Requirement. So -- I owe you my life. I wouldn't try and take yours."
He put his hand in his pocket for his wand, feeling around in the fabric, fingers groping, searching, and the truth was so extremely bad, so ludicrously unlucky, that it took him a very long time to accept it.
Harry's potion worked perfectly -- for just over one hour. And there were so many, many hours in a day and night.
“I’m a fully-grown man,” Harry interrupted, “and I’m sitting right here, you needn’t talk over me. Or
They were walking along the grounds to the greenhouse so Harry could admire Neville’s new crop of Cute Snailwort, so-named, apparently, because they looked like very cute snails, which Harry was having trouble picturing. It was chilly and bright and smelled like turning leaves.
"Ooooh, you should've seen him when I told him you were hurt," she said gleefully. "He dropped an entire cauldron of StoneRot potion, they still haven't figured out how to patch the hole in the floor."
"The Ministry made me go to counseling," Harry said. Malfoy was tilting the bottle at him and he pushed his glass forward, nodding. "A few times when I was an Auror. I used to -- I'd get very angry, sometimes, and it wasn't productive. They made me go for that. And then, once or twice after I'd been injured. Not this injury; others, smaller ones. I got accused of, er, self-destructive recklessness."
Whether the conversation had helped or not remained to be seen, but he propped her card up at his bedside and hoped it had brought her a modicum of relief.
The bartender tilted his head, considering, then turned to one of the only other two people at the bar, a man with a thick blond mustache. “Oy, Phil,” he said. “This bloke look familiar?”
"George reckons she's the ugliest toddler he's ever seen," Ron said with some satisfaction, "but still he's got pictures of her all over his office. Here." He deposited Rosie unceremoniously into Harry's lap and Harry buried his face gladly in her chubby neck. "What'll you have?"
"Or you could come with me," Harry said. "If you wanted to, I mean. If that's interesting to you. Or not."
"Nearly getting ourselves killed at every turn, yeah, I think I recall." Neville sipped his wine. "You were the mastermind back then, Harry, so go on -- suggest something."
“I think he wishes he were,” Harry said. “He’s never told me why he left off but I get the sense he misses it, and I don’t want him taking his career regrets out on me, just because I happen to be close by. Thanks, I’m all right now.”
The Dark Mark was still branded on his arm, looking brand-new and almost inflamed, the skin around it pink and swollen. Harry couldn't hide how the sight affected him: his whole body went rigid, the old fury sweeping through his veins.
McGonagall was rising from the table now, napkin dropping from her lap. When she spoke, her voice was calm, but Harry knew her well enough to see that she was worried. “Should we alert someone?”
"Total?" Harry had said. Jacob had nodded eagerly. "I don't know, actually. There's a public one on every floor, and then one in the Great Hall, and this one here in my classroom..."
Harry debated telling Malfoy about what Hanna had admitted. He even practiced how he'd say it, lightly, with great good humour, a silly joke, kids these days! But somehow he couldn't manage it and he decided that there was no need, it would only be awkward. Still, when Draco let him into his office for their meeting the next afternoon, he couldn't help but blush at the sight of him.
"Outstanding," Harry pronounced. "Where did you get it? I need one. No, I need two, in case one ever breaks."
Everyone began clapping and Harry clapped too, and then McGonagall stood and made a speech and Harry gritted his teeth and tried to smile, hungry and tired and a bit groggy from pain, and then suddenly McGonagall was staring at him -- and so was Neville, and so was everyone, and hadn't he once had a nightmare exactly like this, only naked?
Ron glanced at the curled, swollen fingers of his left hand, then at the white-knuckled grip the right had on his cane. “I don’t like this, mate.”
His favorite staircase was on the other side of the sixth floor, a narrow, little-used wooden thing that wound down through its own stone passage, sturdy banisters on both sides and a convenient landing with a windowseat halfway down where he often stopped to rest. He thumped down the hallway towards it, trying desperately to remember his lesson plan for the morning and feeling more like Moody than ever, wild-eyed, jumpy, mental. If he got downstairs within ten minutes he'd only be fifteen minutes late, and that wasn't so bad, was it? It wasn't a fireable offense, right? Would his students wait for him or would they take his lateness as an excuse for a free period?
“Poetic,” said Draco. He leaned to the side to pick up the kettle sitting by the coffeemaker. “I’m going to make some tea. Who knows how long Betsy will be out there chatting.”
McGonagall made a small moue of disapproval, but Harry was already halfway down the stairs, Neville hot on his heels. They crowded into the Floo together and went to the fifth floor, and Neville stood by as Harry took a deep breath, urging himself towards a patience he didn’t feel. He popped his wand out of his cane and stepped away from its magical upright rigidity, feeling out the wards carefully. Malfoy had changed and increased them since Harry’d first broken into his office, and Harry couldn’t help but feel small flicker of amusement through his worry as he pictured Malfoy’s frustrated indignance at how easy Harry still found it to break in.
Even through his embarrassment, Harry felt a strange pang when he heard Malfoy call Neville by his first name. Neville rushed over with the chair and Malfoy lowered Harry down into it. To Harry's horror, a crowd of students was gathering at the foot of the shallow steps, drawn like sharks to blood by the smell of drama, and one of them called, "Is Professor Potter all right?"
1) In order to make his own potions, he'd have to break into Malfoy's office, steal the supplies, then go into the Potions room in the dead of night and brew them as quickly as he could.
“A Muggle!” Harry said, laughing, brain working overtime to process what she was saying. A Squib? Were all of these people Squibs, then? “Merlin, no. Squib all the way through.”
"All right, we'll start with attendance. If I say your name wrong or if you'd like to be called something else, let me know. And --" He tried to recall what Hermione had told him about ice-breaking exercises, "Tell the class -- er -- tell us what you dressed as for Halloween last year."
Negasi wasn’t here either, which meant he either hadn’t gotten Harry’s message yet or was busy with something else – though Harry felt certain he’d have sent someone in his place, if the latter were the case. Probably he would be here soon. Meanwhile Harry went to the bar and cleared his throat so the bartender, a heavyset young man in a sportsball t-shirt who was polishing a wine glass, turned around.
"I've portioned out this dose myself," Malfoy said. "Too little is useless; too much could kill you right here. I have complete faith in my own skill and believe I've portioned it perfectly, but I understand if you don't share that belief and choose not to take it. I give you my absolute word as a Healer that I have only your best interest in mind, despite whatever... whatever lies between us."
Harry flushed, thinking of Jacob’s comments about his eyes. “No, actually. I wear it because Hermione’s always told me to, and I trust her more on these matters than myself -- but give me a cool, arctic blue any day.” Like Draco’s own eyes. “Like the lake right before it starts to freeze.”
The door flew open. Malfoy was behind his desk, as he always was, looking like someone had posed him for a portrait: Still Life of Young Professor with Lilies.
“Er,” Harry said. “Professional tip, it’s mostly baddies who arrange, you know, attacks and kidnappings.”
"I agree," Malfoy said, "but I think that, compounded by actual grief for her father, she's feeling a lot of guilt. Especially where you're concerned. You're the savior of the wizarding world, and she's the child of a man who tried very hard to kill you."
“Now, for the good stuff,” said Betsy. “Here, gimme that for a sec. Okay so if you’re holding it like this –” she demonstrated, wrapping her beringed fingers around the handle “—then right here you’ll feel a little raised knot in the wood. Go on, try it. Feel it? That’s what you’ll be pressing to release your wand – and I haven’t set the enchantment yet, because I needed you here to activate it, we’ll do it in a minute, but anyway it’ll only pop out for you, okay? No one else’ll be able to get it out. It’ll take some practice before it feels totally natural but you strike me as pretty persistent so I bet you’ll have it down by the end of the week, and I swear it’ll actually be quicker in the long run than snatching it out of your pocket. I put a charm on the cane that’ll register intention, too, so if you accidentally press the knot you don’t have to worry about your wand popping out whenever you’re just like walking around the school or whatever. Got all that?”
Ron looked up, then, and waved, and Harry turned to see Hermione rushing towards them, holding a glass of wine and looking rather chic in an ankle-length trench coat and silk scarf. She was on them in an instant, swooping down to kiss Harry and then Rosie.
"Bit tame," said Harry, but he was already going inside to explore. Malfoy looked deeply pleased with himself and went immediately behind the bar.
Her expression softened and he felt guilty playing the invalid card the one night he actually didn't need it. He gave up on his fork and swapped it for his wand, performing a neat little charm that cut his entire plate of food into bite sized pieces -- including, unfortunately, the napkin that got caught in the crossfire. Little bits of linen flew everywhere.
Harry clenched his jaw. "Malfoy, where's this going? Just tell me so I can yell at you now and save us both time."
"If you --" She seemed mobile enough, but you never could tell "-- If you're having your own trouble getting to class, we could talk to Headmistress McGonagall and --"
He should've let Snape teach him something, those years ago. He'd always thought potions were time-consuming, finicky bits of magic, slow and subtle where Harry preferred fast and effective -- but he'd never expected to rely so heavily on that slow subtlety.
Ron got the smug look he got when he was about to say something disagreeable. “Has it occurred to you that he might actually just be picking up some venom, perfectly safe?”
"All right," Harry relented. "If you don't mind just helping me up some stairs? I'm sorry about this, I mistimed my pain potion, stupid mistake. I promise you won't have to be looking after me all the time."
She set her jaw determinedly and began to cross the last few stairs towards him. "I can help you, let me --"
"Right now, everything's sore," Harry said. He'd suddenly lost all energy for argument. There was a stone bench a few paces away and he glanced at it and said, "I need to sit down for a bit. I guess I'll see you at dinner."
“Merlin, your students were right,” Ron said, jiggling Rosie mechanically as she began to whimper. “You really do like him, don’t you?”
Ron came back into the room, Rosie draped over his shoulder, to find them both bent double, weeping with hilarity. He looked at them indulgently. "What's got you two so giddy?"
Harry had noticed that Malfoy in particular had been touching him a fair amount – a hand on his shoulder or chest, a knee beneath the table – but like the watching, that could be explained by Malfoy’s Healer instincts.
There was a chair in front of Malfoy's desk, and Harry would have very much liked to sit in it. But Malfoy didn't offer it and so he stayed standing. He eased his weight onto his right leg, trying to make the movement look casual, and trying, too, to look like he wasn't casing the room. Glass cabinets of visible biological ingredients: feathers, beaks, feet, eyes, etc. Wooden cabinets of who knew what. Filing cabinets, probably of files.
"It's only now occurring to me," she said, "that I didn't think to -- that is, it was foolish not to have considered -- well, your room's on the sixth floor and your classroom's on the first."
"I've tweaked the St. Mungo's recipe and made you a new potion," Malfoy said shortly. "It has the same curse-dampening power but it also targets pain of the joints, and it's a twelve-hour formula that doesn't need food as a binder, so you won't have to plan everything around snack time anymore. Here's a week's supply, test it out and we'll arrange a meeting next week to discuss it. I ask that you keep a detailed record of your reaction to it, both positive and negative, all right? It should be more effective, but it also might have some new side effects, and I need to know what they are."
Harry let the Healer manhandle his shoulder into place, breathing shallowly while Kevari explained what he was doing and why, and though he tried to pay attention, he really did, the pain was distracting. And so was the thought of Draco’s lips on his, Draco’s hand in his hair, the breadth of his shoulders looming over Harry’s body…
It was the same wildness that had brought them together wasn’t it?  The way those eyes had always pinned Harry down, always sought him out, those were the eyes that always remained unchanged for Harry. And after the war, they were exactly what Harry had needed.
It wasn’t like both of them were clueless when it came to children. Yes, dealing with a real-life baby did prove to be ten times harder than it did when they had to care for a plastic doll in that baby class, but they were managing quite spectacularly if they had to say, even if they did, in time to time,
Eight years down their relationship and three years into their marriage, Harry still wasn’t used to that damning smile of the blond man, and every day spent with Draco seemed to unravel a whole new side of him. Draco was a book with endless pages, filled with unknown stories Harry had yet to read of. And adding Olivia into the mix had only added a completely new chapter to the man he had come to love helplessly. And goddamn if Harry wasn’t mesmerized by it.
Potter's sudden offhand comment made all the blood rush towards his face once more, making him sputter while the man smiled at him.
"I promised to never lie to you, Harry. The moment you came into my life, I promised to never lie to you. And you needed to hear the truth in the end. I was dying, living a life like that.
"With eyesight like yours, shouldn’t you be staying indoors, Potter? We wouldn’t want the boy who lived to fall into the Great Lake."
The coat Draco made for Harry was moss green in colour. It felt fluffy on his skin while looking like it was made out of leather, and the carefully sewn patterns on it only showed themselves when the sun hit it just right.
"But now, little Olive is going to finally spend a whole day with her daddies! And by the end of the day, she will undoubtedly declare
"I wish things were different too," Draco spoke with a horace voice of his own, finally letting the emotions slip out of him, giving Harry a watery smile, "we were both bloody idiots back then."
"I wanted to see you. Saw on the paper that you were back," Draco admitted with a small smile, a hint of pride coloring his voice, "I had to catch you before you left again."
Molly only started bathing her in the tub two weeks ago, and after copious amounts of reassuring and insisting, both of them had managed to convince her that they both could do it themselves.
! Reality wasn’t me cowering away from everything and settling for a ministry job that made me more miserable. And we did that for
"Alright okay, okay," she said, finally backing down, "you know how I am, darling. I worry too much! I'm sure It'll be alright." she smiled at him. "I'll drop by in the evening, yeah?"

"This is worse than deja-vu," Draco muttered as he straightened his robes and got his breathing back to normal. Potter kept on smiling at him the whole time.
it was you, Malfoy," Potter said in his usual carefree drawl. The bastard surely had some sort of face fetish, Draco was sure of it. The way he was leaning over Draco suggested nothing but that. It had to be that.
"I said no such thing!" Draco sputtered, his chest hammering wildly again at their close proximity. They were in
"Are you both sure you can do this?" Molly questioned for the tenth time through the fire call, and Draco had to keep himself from rolling his eyes too severely from the couch he sat on, lest he had a headache.
he conducted, still trying his best to recover. What in the name of Merlin was he doing, thinking of Potter's eyes like that in his presence? Those were strictly his personal night time thoughts that had no right to come out in daylight. He must still be in shock from the surprise Potter gave him. Yes, that must be it.
specky git, Draco decided to take the longer, more subdued way towards the library. The school wasn’t yet used to his or any of the other handful of returning Slytherins' presence in the castle, so Draco mostly avoided crowded areas whenever he could. He would prefer to
"What are you doing here?" Draco enquired, turning his face away; focusing his attention towards the falling leaves around them. If he let himself look too closely at the current position he was in, things would get
The crowded ballroom room seemed like a haze; fluttering in and out from his vision like those awful muggle traffic lights that always hurt his eyes, making him irritated. It was the third function he attended this week, the last two being for work, and this one, god knows why he came.
Potter's hand slowly crept up to his neck as the man moved even closer, now almost tipping Draco over the sink, kissing him thoroughly as he went.
"W-why are you here?" Harry couldn’t help but ask again. He needed to make sense of their whole conversation. He was supposed to be shouting. They were both supposed to be shouting at each other. Wasn’t that what exes do?
Draco enquired while trying to gather his sanity, which had no doubt fallen out of him the second this shitshow had started; his face still aflame from their recent....
"Let's get you all cleaned up O-love-ya!" he cooed, "put a towel on the bottom of the tub will you, love? We don't want her to slip."
a bit of assistance. It was a bit daunting having to wake up at arse a clock at night by her crying to be fed or held, but both of them managed. She was chaos, yes. But she was their chaos and they wouldn’t have her in any other way.
What in Godric's hell do you think you're doing?!" Draco hissed as he yanked himself away from his grip, stepping sideways to get himself out of the inappropriate position as gracefully as he could muster.
"I just want to talk, Harry," Draco said softly while eying the empty glass in Harry's hand, his brows slightly crooking. He never liked it when Harry drank too much.
"I — yeah," hearing this, Harry stumbled with his words, "I'm leaving next week. Have to attend a seminar in Milan."
Getting a new place to move around in, Olivia let out a joyous gurgle, which was quickly followed by a loud yelp from Draco as the first splash of water landed on his arms, completely drenching him in seconds.
"You know how I always wanted to..." he trailed off, his voice growing smaller by the second. And Harry
was still something the blonde wasn't quite used to, even if it had been months since Potter had started doing it.
It's been six weeks since they had Olivia, and it was the first time he and Draco will be trying to give her a full baby tub bath.
"So, Hogsmeade tomorrow ?" he asked him once more as he looked at Draco with a shy smile. Potter looked thoroughly kissed; with swollen lips and messy raven hair. There was a drabble of spit running down the side of his chin that Draco couldn’t help but wipe away with his thumb.
Draco questioned, sounding equally confused and scandalized at the prospect. "You do realise Lovegood is a
He had also taken to asking Pansy for help, because if anyone knew about the latest gossip surrounding Boy Wonder, she would be the one. And as it turned out, there were no rumours floating about the castle that Potter had smashed his face up with some miserable cow's. It was only Draco. Only him.
"I'll  have you know that she is still too young to declare anything," Harry pointed out, slowly moving them side to side, still locked in an embrace.
Draco, again being too lost in his inner monologue, missed the way Potter stumbled forward while talking, steading himself with a hand on Draco's shoulder at the last minute.
?" the last bit of control he was holding slipped through Harry's fingers as he snarled at the man beside him, pouring every inch of anger he felt into his words.
"It's just a little water, darling," he kept cooing when Olivia made little noises of distress, stopping every now and then when she got too squirmy.
"We were never good at talking, were we?" the gray eyed man said as he ran a hand over his face. "We always get caught up in —" he paused, giving Harry a helpless look, "What I am trying to say is, you must've seen what we were doing to each other, Harry. You must've. We — we were
"Hold her tightly?" Draco asked while moving to grab the small bottle of liquid baby cleanser potion they purchased a month ago. While it was unsafe to use soap on newborns, the potion worked as the perfect substitute as a cleanser, causing no harm to baby skin. He took out the washcloth and drizzled some of it on it, slowly rubbing it together until it foamed.
at the prospect, some of us like their personal space, Potter," he sniffed, looking away from the man.
Olivia gurgled in Draco's lap while Harry placed the towel, and the blond man preened, giving Harry a pleased look.
"You couldn’t tell if it was me, yes. I had gathered as much the last time." Draco finished for him in irritation.
They knew she needed a sponge bath twice a week before she was ready for a baby tub, and with how insisted Draco had been about taking classes on child care before she arrived, both of them were perfectly knowledgeable about how to get on with it.
, Potter. What is it? This is the third time it has happened. Surely you couldn’t have made the same mistake three times in
The Draco he saw now around Olivia was every part of the man Harry had fallen in love with. With his over the top monologues and dry humour that even their six-week old daughter seemed to enjoy, Draco was in his element as always. But now, along with all the things that made him Draco, he had this whole dimension of softness to him, this whole new side that oozed out fatherly love Harry never knew he had in him, putting Draco in a new light in Harry's eyes. At the time when they talked about having a baby, a part of Harry was scared that Draco wasn't ready for the responsibility of it all. The process of finding a mother who was ready to have them as the adoptive parents were messy, and as the due date got closer and closer, the panic that filled Draco terrified him, keeping him up at night at the thought of Draco crumbling under the pressure and just,
"Long night?" a flutter of voice broke through his chain of thoughts, and without turning around, Harry knew who it belonged to. He had heard that voice mumble far too many things on the nape of his neck to know every volume, every pitch it could take, he had listened to it a hundred times over late night cigarettes to pick up on it even in a crowded room.
"In life, when you give up your dreams, you only get stuck with a love that is repetitive and faded. Because the fire you had inside you, always,
"Po—" the words turned into mush in his mouth as the searing panic replaced itself with a blazing blush that ran through his body, and in the dark he was sure he saw a smirk graze Potter's lips. He could feel Potter's breath on his chin.
"Yes, Molly don't worry," Harry insisted once more, turning around and giving Draco an exasperated look from the floor in front of the fireplace "We got this."
. It was a critical test on his nerves; dealing with the continuous babbling of the raven haired man while concentrating on the work at hand, but Draco managed. He had begrudgingly admitted to himself after a point that, when Potter was not being a total nuisance, he could be somewhat
"That's it, baby girl," Harry cooed when the last of her sniffles went away, and he lifted her to get a look at her face. With her huge doe brown eyes, Olivia stared back at both of them, her hair and head still full of the foam that was beginning to dry, wailing finally forgotten.
, so confident and, so blindingly loving, devoted entirely to the whims of a baby who was just born.
Molly's face gleamed with unexpressed concern just as bright as the fire, but she reluctantly stopped with her prodding.
," Potter explained while staring at him with the same stupid smile, "I lost my glasses, you see," he said pointing at his face. And it was only then that Draco noticed the absence of the hideous round framed disgrace on top of Potter's nose.
"What do you think of this one, Draco?" Potter said flashing him a devastating smile while sporting a thick square looking frame on top of his nose. And as much as Draco liked the sodding bastard, he scoffed.
"Did daddy hurt you my angel?" he kept on talking, "daddy is very sorry darling, I didn’t mean to. Please stop crying baby, it's all done now. No more soap I promise, okay?  That's it darling don't cry," the words poured out of both of them like rain, and little by little Oiliva started to calm down, her wail turning into little sniffles.
. Draco didn’t understand why he needed to do such a thing in the first place, with the whole school being half in love with his golden ass after the war. If he so much as asked, little Sluggy would've given him a free period without even blinking. Potter was an

the blonde declared happily while moving their daughter side to side in a motion of slow dance; his feet moving gracefully around the kitchen while Harry watched on with a soft smile playing at his lips, leaning against the dining table.
, of course. And he knew Draco had done the same for him. Dreams were put on the shelf when life took over. And after that, things just never were the same.
After watching them for a few minutes, Harry pushed himself up and walked closer to his husband, who kept rattling on about how they

to something. After their second proximity incident, Draco had taken special care to note the specky git's whereabouts and behaviour; watching him with the corner of his eye whenever he could. And in his observation, he had noticed that while Potter did fumble around like a blind fool without his glasses, not once,
. He watched dumbfounded as the green eyes squinted back at him, as if Draco had some sort of dirt on his face that needed to be examined further  — which was highly
And now, there he stood, right in front of Harry with those same eyes and that devil like smile that always made Harry's knees go weak, looking like everything that had happened between them hadn’t affected him at all. As if ten years ago Draco hadn’t walked into Harry's life, hadn't single-handedly consumed every inch of Harry's world, right before leaving him in pieces once more.
Their house was now constantly filled with friends, everyone coming in whenever they felt like it, eager to spend time with the newest member of the family. And while they did love how taken everyone was with Oliva, Harry would be lying if he said he didn’t crave a little alone time with just the three of them. It was only at the wee hours of the night when they ever got to spend some time alone, and even if it had been just three days —
The rest of her bath went on without trouble. With the little episode concerning the potion being over, getting Olivia into the water wasn’t all that hard, and they let her splash about happily while both of them got the rest of the foams off of her body, swiftly pulling her out and wrapping her in a warm blanket once she was cleaned.
"She's going to cause all kinds of terror growing up, isn’t she?" Draco muttered, looking at her sleeping face, and dropped his head on top of Harry's.
Harry let his misty eyes turn towards the man in question to find his pale gray orbs staring right back at him, and the longing that crawled up to his throat made him want to whimper.
"I would've, but Hogsmeade weekend is still 6 days away. I was thinking about getting a new frame, you know. Change up the look a bit," Potter conversed while motioning towards his face. It wasn’t like they were still on the bitter nemesis phase — the war did change that between them — but watching Potter talk to him like Draco was his
smashing them across a hard surface," he stated irritatingly as a new blush found its way to his cheeks, remembering the position they were in a couple of seconds ago. His back was sure to bruise.
"Who are you?" Potter inquired just as before while taking a dangerous step towards him, flushing their bodies together from chest to toe. This was not good.
When Harry eyed him in question Draco pressed on, his tone low. "The one I want you to have it's, it's not in the collection." he said looking at his lap.
After a second, or an hour — Draco couldn't be bothered to tell — Potter finally seemed to have enough of him; stepping away from Draco with one final smooch on his lips, the sound of it echoing throughout the bathroom as he gave Draco a rather pleased look.

the professor in helping the rest of the class. He was tired of trying to deal with the same sets of mistakes made by everyone, everytime — Longbottom had yet to understand that fluttering his pretty eyelashes apologetically at his ruined cauldron
She was finally here. Draco found himself silently crying into the crook of Harry's neck once more at the sight of it all, and just as the day before, Harry held onto him tightly, his own eyes glistening under the afternoon sun.
After another thirteen hours of utter madness filled with tears, paperwork and bittersweet goodbyes, she was finally theirs.
Draco fed her a bottle of water while Harry got onto rubbing the baby oil on her, and soon she was sound asleep in her clean dry clothes without a care, while both of the men stood beside the crib looking like they came from war.
They were at a muggle inspired spectacles shop that sold all sorts of magically enhanced glasses; the rave of such things starting after Potter became the poster boy of the wizarding world. Sight enhancing potions were put on the back shelves as the fashion world ate up the whole
"See that!? She likes me better!" he said while dropping a kiss on her head, "Isn't that right, Olive?
Among all their friends and family, it was Molly who was taken the most with Olivia.  Even while having three sets of grandchildren from Ron, Percy and Charlie, Olivia struck a very special place in her heart. And both of them couldn’t have asked for a better overprotective grandmother than her.
When Harry didn’t respond, Draco tried again. "You look good," he spoke in a casual way, and the tone reminded Harry of the past when Draco used to lay in his arms in quiet mornings; when he used to look at his sleep tousled hair and unshaven face, saying the exact same words to him, over and over with a smile.
"Yes, okay," Molly said, equally part unsure. "Check the water temperature before sitting her down on the tub, okay?"
If anyone asked Draco, he would say that Potter was only looking for an excuse to skip classes, and when the opportunity struck, the git grabbed it with
child," Draco had muttered to him in bed that night, Olivia sleeping soundly on her crib just a foot away from them.
Like cold water to his body, the airy tone sent shivers down his spine, and even in the state he was in, Harry still clung to it like a helpless traveller. He had missed that voice. He had missed
But now with the glasses gone and the git refusing any sort of temporary sight enhancing potions or spells given to him — saying
"I do, but what's the fun in that?" Potter shrugged again, "I want to go when everyone else is going."
It's funny what heartbreak could do to a man. Funny how sometimes it built people up before breaking them down completely. And Draco knew that all along didn’t he? He knew that it was a heartbreak that both of them needed. And not wanting to burden Harry with the knife, he took the stabbing upon himself.
Just as he was in the middle of a serious game of peek-a-boo, Draco's voice called him, and Harry gently hoisted Olive into his arms before walking into the bathroom.
"Ohh," Potter said as if he had just realised he was pressed against Draco to the wall, taking a reluctant step back. "Sorry, Malfoy."
"Well if you insist on picking out the worst possible choices, then surely we will. None of these suit you!" Draco countered, before looking away stiffly. "Maybe you should just, stick to the old pair you had," he mumbled as he eyed the simple black wired rims on the shelves, his face turning a soft shade of pink when he caught on to the devilish smirk spreading on Potter's lips.
"Hush hush baby girl!" Draco dropped the washcloth altogether as he scrambled forward, hand instantly going to his hair out of habit.
The night had turned into a nightmare the second his eyes landed on that face, anyway. He should've stayed in his flat. He should've stayed
"You better not," Draco said coolly, before going back to his sunny self, "Let's get you all soaped up now, Olive," he kept talking while taking a hold of her hand, and with big doe eyes Olivia kept watching as Draco slowly began to rub the foam all over her little fingers and arms, his rambles never stopping.
God, how many times had he lost himself in those sinful eyes? He knew every shade of emotions they could hold, every single unsaid word they could express. The gray in those eyes were wild; untamed, and Harry loved that about them.
failed miserably to stumble away from the bastard. He was pinned to a fucking window. And Potter had also somehow gotten his hand around Draco's neck without him noticing and was refusing to let
After five long hours of anxiously pacing around the hall and ripping most of their hairs apart, the news of their daughter being born had felt like a dream. The image of how both of them had tumbled onto the floor in a mess of crying and laughing, eyes gleaming with wild untamed happiness still circled his mind in all its vividness.
, seemed to be completely unaffected by the whole situation; shrugging halfheartedly at Draco's comment, "I tried. They never showed up."
"I'm trying!" Harry said, shifting his arms to hold her more securely, "the potion made her slippery."
Draco noticed that the righteous bastard actually had long, long lashes that framed his green orbs rather beautifully. With every flutter, the eyelashes seemed to skim over the top of his cheeks, casting a thin shadow that made hi —
"I said, can I come with you? To the library?" Potter asked again, his hands now nestled deep in his pockets.
"I brought you along to help me pick a pair of glasses, Malfoy. Not to reject every single one I try!"
. Because up this close, Harry could smell the faint hint of cologne coming from his skin. It was a mix of citrus, petrichor and Draco's musk; a smell that Harry once devoured, worshiped whenever he got the chance. It was all too
really! He kept his person neat and clean, thank you very much — before moving in even closer; just a couple more inches and they would be kissing for Sala —
"I know, I didn’t think this would happen a third time either but, well, here we are," Potter said with a shrug of his shoulder.
"Baby, don't cry like that," Draco cooed while crawling behind Harry, trying to get a peek at her face that was tucked into Harry's neck.
"Alright alright!" Harry chuckled, clutching him closer still, smiling into Draco's foam soaked neck.
His thoughts were cut off as Potter's teeth sunk softly on his bottom lip, and Draco couldn’t help the pleased whimper that escaped his mouth at the sensation. And judging by the humming sound Potter made at the noise, he was quite pleased as well.
he wailed dramatically while hugging her close to his face, "you’ve missed your daddy, haven’t you, my angel? Yes you did, yes yes yes!" he kept at his cooing while Olivia watched on with bright eyes.
"We got this, Molly!" Harry said in exasperation, cutting her off with a fond smile. "I know you are worried but we got this. Really!" he insisted, trying to reassure her.
He supposed he should've said a thank you to Potter as well, with an apology alongside it. But Draco's pride could only take so much after everything. And besides, Potter was alright with him not saying anything. The git already had his flock of fans showering him with gratitude wherever he went. He didn’t need Draco's thank you's or apologies. He didn’t.
"I don't know how you remember your childhood Malfoy" Harry went on, "but an angel was not what I'd describe you as back then."
"What are you doing here, Draco?" the words slurred in his mouth, and Harry tried his best not to sound too hurt, too broken and angered. His anger never worked on Draco. And hurt, well, Draco wouldn’t have hurt him if he cared in the first place.
Harry would be a fool if he said that he was content with his job as an auror. He would be a fool if he said he didn’t hate every second of going to the ministry when both of them were together. But the pay of an auror was steady and travelling and leaving things behind was hard. So he had settled for the safer option, for
"When you are done laughing at my misery, a little help would be much appreciated!" he gritted through his teeth, trying his best to save his face from the splashes their daughter was descending upon him, and in turn, Harry sniggered some more, before finally taking pity on him. With the jumper rolled up to his arm, he moved swiftly between Draco's, taking a hold of Olivia with a winning grin.
Draco closed his eyes. He could feel the emotion building up in his throat and the tears welling up in his eyes. He’d already been crying in the shower and the barrier had been broken. He gulped down hard and nodded. “I’ll be there in a minute. I need to send Blaise a note.”
“Civility is about respect. Doing the right thing doesn’t always match up with society’s expectations of right and wrong.”
Pansy nodded, “Yes and you weren’t there. It wasn’t an emergency so we went to Spell Damage and saw Patil.” Pansy’s lips curved into a devious smirk. “She asked me how I thought you were settling in…”
“Hmm,” Harry stalled and tried not to think about how intimate his name sounded coming out of Malfoy’s mouth. “I’m not sure,
Draco stayed busy completing paperwork and charts, taking trips to the cantina for various snacks and coffees, and completely missed Potter’s second check-in. He rushed to his hospital room but stopped just outside the door when he heard a slightly raised voice echo into the hallway.
“Shh,” she said softly and rubbed his back. “You don’t have to forgive someone to miss them.” She pushed him away ever so slightly so she could look him in the eyes. “And there is nothing wrong with loving someone that you can’t forgive.”
Pansy pouted. “Draco, how could you move back and not tell us? Oh, Greg will be so pleased when he finds out.” She stared down at the open logbook. “Your first day and you’re already up to your elbows in paperwork!”
Draco has an idea of what he’ll see when he steps through but still isn’t prepared for the shock of seeing Harry Potter staring at the unfinished painting of himself and the slew of sketches and smaller paintings hung on the wall behind it. Harry’s facing away from him, and Draco’s immobilised with an amount of fear he hadn’t known possible.
“I really enjoyed this,” he says, and his voice is low. He’s quite close to Draco. “Us. Having dinner together.”
“I’m going to leave now,” Draco said and finished packing up his bag. “Hopefully with this information, I can start a solid treatment plan and Potter can come home within twenty-four hours. Perhaps you should finish cleaning up.” Draco walked to the doorway. He added over his shoulder, “And if there were, say, some bottles and things broken in the bathroom during the course of his episode, well, no one will fault you for tossing them without a second look.”
Draco looked at the floor and sighed, briefly reliving the moment his eyes had locked on Lucius’; or the times the smell of soot on a burn victim took him back to the Room of Requirement; or the only werewolf attack that he’d seen in his entire career that had left him wondering if a victim of Greyback had done it. He saw it every day: things that triggered memories. The war was always going to haunt him. But he had learned how to cope with it. And maybe that was the one key difference between Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter.
When he stepped out onto the cobblestone and headed toward Knockturn Alley, Draco was surprised by the number of people crowding the street. For a Tuesday afternoon, it seemed rather odd for there to be so many, but he figured there must’ve been some sort of event or festival going on. He decided against visiting Borgin and Burkes with so many people around and headed toward the Trade Quarter to meet Blaise.
Harry took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He was turned on and out of his mind with lust but this was still Malfoy and it was still the H.U.M.P. office at the bloody Ministry of Magic—anyone could walk in. He couldn’t bring himself to deny what he was feeling for Malfoy, but he could at least acknowledge that the H.U.M.P. office was definitely not the place to explore those recent revelations.
“You’re delusional,” Draco waves his hand at Potter. It’s the other man’s last ditch effort to defend Oliver Wood’s Arrows with some obscure fact. “But I’d expect nothing less from you.”
Scraping his nails down Draco’s sides, Potter kneads and then cups Draco’s arse, hoisting him up only to throw him down on his back. Draco wants to protest the change of position, but before he can blink, Potter’s mouth finds one of his nipples. He becomes a moaning mess of euphoria, arching up into Potter’s hot mouth. When he starts kissing down Draco’s abdomen, all Draco can do is try to keep his eyes open.
Blaise eyed Draco’s neck and cast an advanced Glamour without pause and the scars became invisible. “Alright, mate?”
In the second week, Draco begins to lose track of time. One afternoon turns into evening and before he’s realised it, Harry cooks for him. Just as Draco walks into the kitchen to let him know he’s on his way out, he catches Harry uncorking a bottle of wine. Draco stills at the sight of Harry’s sleeves rolled up to his elbows, his muscular arms tan and taut and struggling with the cork.
after the war. He’d certainly had to fight his way through the darkness of his own issues. His nightmares had been so vivid and haunting, for Salazar’s sake, that he’d formulated an illegal potion just to escape them! He had
“Sometimes,” Draco says, “it still feels like it was yesterday. But other days…” He stares at Harry. “It feels as if we were completely different people.”
“Is that what this is?” Draco puts his hands on Potter’s shoulders and pushes him away. “You think you have to shove my cock in your mouth as thanks for being a decent human being?”
Draco scoffed. “You know there isn’t!” He clenched his jaw and willed himself be unaffected by her taunts. “We’re...possibly...friends who are also enemies?”
“Draco,” Potter steps forward. He rests his palms against the counter on either side of Draco’s hips. He’s close, closer than Draco can ever remember him being. He thinks back to the last few times Potter’s said his name, but he’s sure he never said it like that. No one has ever said it the way Potter just did: like it was a prayer of devotion. A promise.
Draco got two fingers in the air for that and couldn’t help but laugh. “I can give you a numbing agent and cast a stasis on it before we Apparate to St Mungo’s.”
Draco stills, quite shocked, questioning his memory of that particular painting and its private sale to an anonymous buyer. “Perhaps, your view of what
Draco eyed them both. “It’s late, let me see if…” He stared down the hallway and wracked his brain for a way to calm and comfort them. He needed to put them at ease, and he had no idea why he felt so obligated to do so. “I think Padma is still here. Why don’t I have her bring you two some coffee? The good stuff, not the shite in the cantina.”
“Even when it’s with themselves?” He grins, teasing, and Draco thinks the warmth of it will melt him on the spot. Potter ignores Draco’s silence and walks into the room. He points to his bag. “I came to get this." He eyes Draco. “Might need it later.”
“Still, how you had time to do all this after you—” Thomas swipes a hand over Finnigan’s mouth and cuts him off.
As Malfoy prattled on about the apprehension of the Pentacle Pirates off the coast of the Isle of Skye, Harry couldn’t help but map out the long, dark lashes around his prideful eyes, how they touched and lingered on the fine skin underneath, stark and pale by comparison.
He sat back, stared at his desk, his mouth open and his eyes unfocused. He could barely comprehend what he’d just read. Those levels of power were unprecedented. But then again, so was everything else relating to Harry Potter. It was too much to fathom and yet—the thought of that amount of power, the sheer strength Potter must’ve possessed to contain it—Draco sat there unravelling at the thought of it, practically panting in awe and speculation and desire. Did anyone else know? Or was he the only one? He liked the idea of being one of the few people with such knowledge.
Patil’s posture stiffened. “I should probably apologise,” she said slowly, “but I won’t. Being honest and blunt was something my Mind Healer encouraged me to do after the War.”
Mr Burke wrapped up the silver and the Faberge jewellery boxes in protective brown paper before tying them up in string with the flick of his wand. After Draco settled the account and Burke thanked him for the Malfoy’s business, Draco couldn’t help but inquire about Potter’s presence. “Mister Burke, do you get a lot of Aurors in here?”
So it is with resignation that he starts his next painting which quickly becomes his latest attempt at portraying Harry Potter’s truth. Draco uses the sketch of Harry uncorking the wine bottle as inspiration to create a figure portrait of him looking determined in his Auror robes. He hangs up his previous attempts, the various depictions of Harry’s green eyes, the sketches of him from past events, the darker and more disfiguring works from an earlier time before he’d known what Harry had truly meant to him.
Weasley stared at the bathroom and Draco knew he was thinking about confiscating the Dragon Tamer’s Potion. “If anyone found out he had that…”
and the warmth of it gave him the strength to stand up and walk out. Less than ten minutes later, she met him outside the door and handed him a takeaway bag.
Vacations alone were out of his comfort zone, Harry supposed. His friends were all busy with their own lives and he didn’t really have anyone else. It wasn't as if he was dating anyone.
Blaise is smirking. Draco begins to panic. He agrees with his best friend but wants to smack him nonetheless. The more he stares at Potter’s chest, the more he regrets the night he and Blaise got pissed, and Draco admitted aloud that he wanks to thoughts of Potter. He knows he shouldn’t do it. Draco knows Potter’s unavailable, but once he started, he couldn’t stop. Only Potter stirs his blood in such a tantalising way. No one else can make Draco peak with just the thought of their brilliant eyes or perfect lips.
Draco stopped and stared as the clerks turned back to what they’d been doing and ignored him. The shoppe had floor to ceiling shelves full of oddities. Some were spinning, making noises, or flashing brightly-coloured text in an effort to be noticed. Draco smiled slightly, remembering his rather juvenile efforts at creating the
“Where are you going?” Potter asks, still suffering from a steady line of steam coming out his ears.
A ruckus erupted in the foyer from the Main Floo and Draco immediately bolted up and rushed to investigate. Why was it when he always felt the most alone, that damned Floo spit someone out to prove him wrong? He expected to see his mother, or Lucius, or even Pansy or Blaise, perhaps come to steal him away to that terrible nightclub. What he didn’t expect to see was Harry Potter, soaked head to toe, clutching his left arm and panting like he’d run a dozen laps around the Quidditch pitch.
He tossed his bag on a nearby bench and headed toward her voice. “Had a long surgery,” he said as he entered the kitchen and smelled bacon. His mother was standing over the stove in an apron, still in her pyjamas. It was still a pleasant shock to see her so domestic, as the memories he retained from childhood clashed with the image before him. He approached her and smiled, leaning down to leave a soft kiss on her cheek. “I left after my Post-Op check-in.”
“You’re obviously fine now,” Draco says. He walks over to the window and recovers his discarded book. “I was in the middle of something when your friends left you to catch your death.”
He slowed his pace as he realised Teddy was fine and the figure on the ground was an adult male. As he reached them, the man’s face became visible and Draco stopped.
Weasley frowned. “I thought you worked at Mungo’s?” He shook his head and grabbed his chin. “Harry said something about you being Healer-in-Charge?”
“Do you know what this does to a person’s muscles?” Draco shouted. “Do you know what it can do to their brain?”
When Draco returned to the hospital, he realised he and Weasley had been gone almost three hours. Before anything else, he immediately tasked Intern Masker with getting the analysis done on the Muggle substances. Draco used the excuse of changing back into his Healer’s robes to lock himself in his office and have a few moments to process everything he’d just seen.
Weasley steps aside and motions Draco forward. A refusal to help would seem suspicious. It’s not as if he has a reason not to help Harry Potter. He wants to help him. He wants...a lot of things, actually, where Potter is concerned.
Of course, Harry Potter lives his life, a life full of friendships, relationships, celebrations, and like everyone, the occasional setback. Draco watches these events from afar. He sees Harry a few times a year at various fundraisers, auctions, charity events, or Ministry galas. They acknowledge each other with the simplest of nods, a cursory greeting that in no way could ever convey the breadth of their past relations.
Potter licks his lips and grins, and Draco’s certain he’s never been able to stop time before but that moment lasts forever. Potter bracing himself with one hand on Draco’s side, the other guiding his cock to his entrance. He’s biting his lip and pressing slowly, tearing his gaze away from it to stare into Draco’s eyes.
“Unbelievable,” Harry shook his head. Not only was Malfoy still flirting with him in the office, but he was
“It could be,” Draco tries to stay on point. “You could have Alterniton’s Syndrome or a charm sickness, no one knows what that lake water could have done to you.”
“I can’t be sure,” Draco said. The mention of the Dark Lord caught him off guard. “Is there a way to tell the difference?”
Blaise stands and brushes his hands over his knees. “Harry needs body heat, Draco. Body heat and liquids.”
He made for the door and every step was a rush of relief, another breath of clarity washing over him. There was a tangle of what felt like infinite emotions inside him, and he didn’t have the patience or the energy to figure out what they were. He didn’t know if he wanted to. As Draco was about to step out of the kitchen, he remembered why Potter had been there in the first place. He turned back to find confusion etched all over Potter’s face.
If Draco believed in some cosmic collective irony, or karma, or wisdom nonsense, perhaps it would be mildly entertaining—fitting even—that he, Draco Malfoy, couldn’t prevail without that scarheaded buffoon making an appearance. But that line of negative thinking—he chastised himself for even allowing such thoughts to cloud his mind—was childish and not at all who Draco had become. His first patient had been a critically injured Harry Potter; the hardest case he could get was behind him.
“Your paintings aren’t as dark and morose as they used to be,” Andromeda remarks one Easter after their luncheon. “I saw your recent
“Draco, you feel so good,” he says, and Draco thinks his eyes have gone totally black with desire. “Let me make you feel good.”
“Undoubtedly,” Draco smiled. “Now, I’ve cleaned the wound, do you consent to a treatment plan of inducing bone regeneration and wrapping the leg in a backslab?”
him. It had shaken him; it had put a crack in his foundation of control. A part of Draco had always known the moment would come when he would have to face his father, when he’d have to accept the choices Lucius had made and what those actions had done to him and their family. As he sipped his wine and finished the rest of his dinner, he stopped to ask himself if eleven years had been long enough—if there was any amount of time that would change the way he resented the man who’d shaped almost half his life into something
Earlier that morning, Draco rolled over on his thick comforter and asked, “Who goes to Norway and picnics?” He eyed Blaise, dressed for a wintery trek, as he stood tall in the doorway that connected their rooms.
at him, sending him flying backward as invisible soft ropes wrapped around his body. Harry fell to his knees and struggled against the bindings that wove themselves around his chest, wrists, thighs, and ankles.
Blaise made space for Draco and ushered him to take a seat. Once seated on the edge of the booth, Draco glanced to where Theo had pointed and froze.
Finally, it hits Draco. He glances down, unable to stop his gasp when he sees Potter’s erection tenting in his trousers. His memory flashes to Potter earlier that day, naked in the water—then three days before to the sight of him sprawled out on the sofa. Draco pictures his perfect cock and shudders.
“Let me do a quick assessment,” Draco offered and stepped to Potter’s left. He cast the spell and examined the area around the lung that he’d drained and repaired. Everything appeared to be doing well, and that fact somewhat startled him. “It’s looking good,” he said slowly. “Too good.”
“Merlin,” Draco ducks his head down to hide how much he laughs. He forgets the evening was supposed to be tiresome with poor company as the wine and conversation flow, and before Draco realises it, he’s having more fun than he’s had in ages.
It’s their third and final day and night at the cabin, and Draco’s not sure he’s ever felt simultaneously so relaxed and horny. He’s had to deal with Blaise’s hookups with Longbottom and Ginevra, and he’s certain everyone—including Potter—is trying to torture him into spontaneous sexual combustion.
Weasley clenched and unclenched his jaw several times as he stared at the bottle. Draco noticed the man’s hands were shaking. “He knows someone,” Weasley finally said. “On a dragon preserve.”
Potter launches into a defense of his friends, which leads to his passionate support for Ron’s Quidditch prowess. Draco practically dies inside when they start arguing about the Appleby Arrows’ last season, and while Potter knows his Quidditch statistics, he can’t analyze them for all the money in his Gringotts vault. His gift was always raw ability on the field and a talent for putting together a good team and motivating them, never strategy and analysis of the other teams' weaknesses. Maybe that was the difference between the Gryffindor and Slytherin approaches to the game.
Draco and Narcissa had stepped through the front doors of the Manor on a Thursday afternoon and by Saturday morning most of the West Wing had been reopened, cleaned, and was relatively acceptable for daily living.
Draco and Blaise finished their drinks at about the same time, and Blaise asked to be let out of the booth to use the loo. Draco decided to accompany him.
When Patil saw him the next morning, she clapped him on the back and told him he looked exactly how she thought he would. “Did you even sleep last night?” she asked, her tone carrying a mild edge of concern.
Potter frowns, his red lips swollen and indecently perfect. Draco hates himself for stopping Potter from wrapping those perfect lips around his cock, even if it would only ever be once, but he can’t let him pity fuck him.
“I—I do,” Draco nodded. When he met her thoughtful gaze, his ability to hold back his feelings broke down even further. “But not because he’s my patient.”
“You know we can help you with the Manor,” Pansy said. “I work with Theo and Alicia in Curse-breaking and half the time we’re called out to help with people like you.”
Draco could hardly believe that Harry Potter had bought one of his works — twelve-hundred Galleons! — and one layered with so many personal touches.
Draco shakes his head. He grabs Potter’s spectacles, folding them neatly and placing them on the side table. He fingers the bottom of the jumper, takes a breath, and prepares himself. He pulls the grey jumper up and over Potter’s head and casts it aside.
“N-no,” Potter’s voice cracked. He cleared his throat. “I’ve just never seen anyone drink wine that way.” He raised his right hand and scratched the back of his head. “Is that a...
He first caught sight of his mother, her figure sliding into the chair facing in his direction. And then his eyes rose to the man behind her, the tall familiar figure helping her push her chair in.
He lifted his glass to try the wine for himself. But he hadn’t learned about wine in France, he’d learned from his parents. “Actually, I—” he started to say but faltered when his eyes locked onto the figures taking their seats at the table beside them.
Weasley busts in with his back to the cabin, gripping Potter’s arms and hoisting him against his chest while Blaise follows close behind. With his arms wrapped around Potter’s legs, Blaise sends Draco a look of mild concern. Draco stares at them, shocked, and only realises there’s water pooling on the floor under Potter’s prone form when he steps in it.
“This is helpful,” Draco said, suddenly certain that morphine had been the unidentified compound. “I think we found what we needed.” He took one of the vials and put the other two back on the table.
and pointed to the nearest pallet of boxes. They shrunk it down to fit inside Draco’s pocket and Blaise grabbed the invoice and packing lists.
Except that Draco’s known every inch of that face since his first year at Hogwarts, and shamefully must admit that there were few things he knew better than the details and figure of Harry’s form.
Draco swallowed and kept his jaw clenched shut. Weasley’s words resonated with him and rang painfully and unexpectedly true. His first instinct was to abruptly contradict them and to let the record show that Draco Malfoy had never been
He made his way through Diagon without a wayward glance and Apparated home where he dropped the packages on a table in the foyer and headed straight for the library. He sought his crystal decanter of firewhisky; surely once he’d calmed his nerves, Draco would be able to see it all more clearly.
Draco briefly fixated on his lips which were parted in shock. Breaking his gaze, Draco turned to his bag and ignored Potter’s question. “Yes, you’re absolutely right,” he said as he grabbed the numbing elixir. “
Draco shook his head, blushing. “These are just—I was supposed to be out with Blaise but he had to work.”
Toward the beginning of his medical education, Draco quickly realised how little choice humans actually had in the things that they were—genetics,
Draco paused mid-step. “No. I only need one to sample it and confirm that this is what’s in his system.”
Blinking, Weasley took a deep, shaky breath and nodded his head. “Yeah, Malfoy, I am.” He turned his blue eyes to Draco. “And that’s the point.” He waved his hands in the air. “I’m alright! Hermione’s alright! Everybody else seems to manage, even you.” He took a breath and ran a shaky hand through his hair. “So why is it always Harry that has to fight the demons? Why is it like this?”
“It is what it is.” Blaise’s shoulders fell. He sat back in his chair and crossed his arms. “Say, could you—” He sat back up, a hopeful expression on his face. “Would you make a delivery for me?”
Pansy quickly distracted him with her disappointment at Draco's refusal to let his hair down and tousle it. He opted instead to leave it tied back at the nape of his neck.
“Did he?” Draco sighed, too distracted to be carrying on a conversation with his mother. “I didn’t ask.” He bit his lip and wiped his hands over his face. “Forgive me, I’m exhausted, I’m going to turn in early.”
Draco turns around to start unbuttoning his shirt. He closes his eyes, unable to stop the string of images he’s savored from the last time Potter was naked in front of him. Draco gulps and disrobes. By the time he gets to his pants, he’s heard the splash of Potter lowering himself into the water.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says again. He takes a step forward and gulps. “I’ve made you uncomfortable. I can explain.”
“Just checking,” he smirked and took a sip. The hospital brew was notorious for its bitter stale taste, but he was pleasantly surprised by the rich flavour that struck his palate. It must have shown on his face because Patil laughed.
“Don’t be so certain,” she said, picking up her toast. “The reckless ones take the biggest risks and have the greatest falls.”
“I could list all those useless charities you let yourself get talked into supporting, not to mention the people you take under your wing, the donations, the parties, the children’s events, but we’d be here all day.” Draco can’t hide the slight hint of admiration in his tone which bothers him. It was supposed to be snide. “And don’t get me started on—what are you doing?” Draco stops as Potter swims toward him.
He opens the doors to everyone else’s rooms in turn and mutters, “Accio Pepper up!” In the second to last bedroom, someone’s bag finally flaps open, and a small bundle of toiletries flies into Draco’s outstretched hand.
for the following two days before ultimately finishing off a bottle of Odgen’s and flipping to the Art and Leisure section. He was certain it would be the end of his career as an artist.
The conversation turned to other things, restaurants and Ministry happenings. Pansy, Theo and the unnamed man entered into a heated discussion over new Auror dress code policies just as Daphne and Greg got up and headed to the dancefloor.
I stick out my tongue like I'm eleven again, and I don't even care. After a minute, I muse, "I don't think they'll be able to come in here without removing the wards. The magic they did is probably preventing anything in or out, including them."
Hands down the most bizarre thing Harry had ever seen on her—and Harry had once seen her wear his face.
Harry runs into his bedroom and grabs the letter from his desk, folding it so they won't see any of his message. "Got it," he says, coming back out.
“Auror Malfoy.” Robards stood. “For five years, you came to work wearing appropriate clothing. The day after the Ministry instituted a new dress code, you show up wearing clothes that, it is clear, were chosen
Harry scooted his chair around the table with a loud scrape, closer to Draco. He threaded his fingers in Draco's hair. "I don't think I'm the only person who can save the world. I know that the things that made me special are long moot. But I do have a particular place in our society—and if I can use that to accomplish good things, I
Harry could only stare at him. After a moment, he added, "I would've thought pure-bloods had better sex euphemisms than that."
There was a long pause, then Lavender's hand flew up to her mouth. She looked like she hadn't heard anything this exciting in years.
"I strongly object." Draco took the shoe, holding it somewhat gingerly, and handed Harry his own shoe, a handsome brown brogue. In his drunk state, Harry was tempted to put Draco's shoe on and affect a little play-acted Draco impersonation.
"Don't think you have to say it back, but you need to hear it, my friend." She smiles. "You know what Aunt Peggy said?"
Something in Draco's voice must've got Harry's attention, because he turned with a look of concern he usually reserved for the kids. "What's wrong?"
A warm hand fell on Harry's shoulder; he jumped. Draco. Draco had stepped forward, standing directly behind him. No doubt this hand-on-shoulder thing was meant to tell Harry to calm the fuck down.
. If it didn’t work, they’d probably need to find a surrogate or adopt an older child, which would be fine, but also very difficult. They didn’t want to adopt a Muggle baby because it seemed cruel to bring a non-magical child into a magical world, home, and family. Why bring a child into a place where they would feel like they didn’t belong, on top of not being a blood relative? It was all such a mess, and all Harry wanted was to be through it, and to have a grandbaby on the other end. And bring them to the zoo.
That made Draco laugh even harder. It was a good five minutes before they each stopped randomly bursting into renewed laughter.
"There's lots of drinks that turn your mouth green," Ron said. "Witches Brew. Frog Fanta. Crocodile Cider. Burbling Sludge."
know—that, at the time, I had no idea the extent of the evil of that nefarious little…what did she call it? Team? Clique? Posse?"
"Hmm," Draco said, reaching the vending cabinet and touching his wand to a pack of biscuits that Scorpius liked. "What will they want?"
It was delicious—and more so because it was decadent and over-the-top and completely unnecessary, and bought just for him by someone else. For a moment, he was suffused with a sensation of warmth he was not at all used to.
Malfoy sighed. "Alright." He pushed his plate away and stood, ignoring the stares as they walked out of the Great Hall and Harry led them onto the grounds. It was cloudy, and seemed to have just stopped raining. The ground felt moist—squishy—under the soles of his trainers.
Once they were all seated and Lorraine had served the tea and (to Lavender's delight) the petit fours, Draco assumed a comportment that suggested getting down to business.
"It's roughly as you'd expect, I reckon," Wilhelm informed. "Vance is upset because he thinks they'll lose funding."
. I made the decision I had to make at the time, and I don't regret it. I have enjoyed my work, well enough. Is it the thing I should have done, if I didn't have any constraints on my life and my choices? No. Do I want anyone in the next generation to make that choice for constrained reasons like I did? No."
Harry found he was glad Draco was there. It wasn't that Rump intimidated him, exactly—Harry had faced much greater threats than this buffoon—but that his toxicity made it difficult to function. Harry, though, could feel Draco's presence behind him, and refused to cower before the pacing, red-faced fascist.
Harry huffed out a laugh. “Isn’t the entire purpose of the institution of marriage to force people to have babies? I’m not sure holding off until after forty really goes along with that goal.”
Draco smiles. "But you're Harry Potter. Forgiveness comes easy to you. I'll owl you later, okay? Want to come over and work on that Magimanities assignment?"
tea cups, they have cheap, comic-adorned mugs. "Have a cup of tea, love. I brought Hermione this old tea set that belonged to my parents, her grandparents. It was sitting in the cupboard, unused, so I figured I should bring it, let it serve the next generation, right? No sense having things if you don't use them, I say."
"Have you seen today's paper?" Draco asked, pushing it towards him. "Rump is admonishing people for using spells on the Taboo list. I give him another week before he cracks and stops the Taboo altogether. Bless Albus and Scorpius's resistance. Has it been a real headache for the DMLE?"
Draco threw his head back and laughed. "I don't even care. I mean, obviously, they're right. The binary is a piece of devilry. But a baby girl! I could dance."
," Ginny scolds, sticking a finger out towards him. "You know as well as I do that there is a way, so don't say
"Oh, please. The bill merely says that a business owner can't be held responsible if an employee engages in Dark Arts without their knowledge."
"Let me ask you this," Malfoy started to say, but his sparkling grey eyes were piercing into Harry's so intently that Harry, convinced Malfoy was about to cast
"Uncle Harry's here!" Bill enthused, clapping Harry on the shoulder and doling out toast. Bill looked exhausted.
There was a pause, and for the first time, Harry thought about last night. He'd wanted to wake up still tangled up with Draco. He'd wanted to start a mumbling discussion about their relationship in the half-awake haze of morning. This seemed more awkward, somehow, but needs must. "Draco, I—"
The room grew noticeably quiet. Harry's stomach was in knots—the kids were going to realise. They were going to realise that Harry didn't really want to ever get married again, that it was too fast, that he and Draco could never love each other like this. They'd put two and two together and they'd realise that this was a calculated decision designed to garner votes, not a moment of love and celebration. He almost wanted to open his mouth to deny it—to claim Draco was joking before the kids blew the whole thing open—
Harry sighed. He'd been looking for almost an hour. Well, no. He kept getting interrupted. He'd had a call from James, asking how to repair a problem with his wards. Then he'd been Flooed by Jorgen about an important memo that had landed on Harry's desk (on a bloody Saturday morning). Then Lily'd had a question about broom insurance. Harry wouldn't say no to his child, despite the fact that there was little he hated more than insurance paperwork.
“You sitting here with me,” Malfoy said seriously, and Harry noticed how stormy his grey eyes looked.
"Sorry," I say, in a tone that fails to connote contrition, "I'm stuck in a cellar with a corpse, about to die. One must take one's jollies where one can."
"Are you ready for this?" Draco asked, one leg crossed over the other, foot tapping in the air distractedly.
"Yeah!" Harry said, trying to reassure either Draco or himself not to worry. "Well, no. I mean, she's fine. But, she has a lot of pain, so it's not
“Maybe you should get a pet flamingo and feed it food without that pink coloring, so you could have an albino flamingo,” Harry suggested, watching as a little one tripped on a rock. “One-up your parents.”
