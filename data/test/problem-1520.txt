Now that he was here, it was difficult to believe anywhere else in the world had a sun so warm and vivid as this place. Also, he couldn’t bring himself to contradict the kid, though he wouldn’t admit it under a death threat.
now. So close to achieving an extraordinary result. To healing people, and making up for his faults—those committed during the war. Mostly. To proving that he was
Potter that he could accomplish anything he set his mind to.
Caipora asked, her sentence flexing in a question by the end, Draco noticed. Her voice a low growling sound near Lua.
He was ready to beg for it again if needed. But he
“I don’t… I don’t remember,” Harry started weakly, confusion in his features, eyes unfocused. “I was talking to Tai and then…”
The mark. The Dark Mark tainted his pale skin. It was proof of who he was: a snobbish, elitist, prejudiced wizard. He would never change. He would always be—
! Merlin, I thought you…” Potter’s voice was frayed, anxious. His calloused fingers rubbed the scratches on Draco’s face, healing them almost immediately. His eyes darted overt Draco’s entire body, probably looking for a more pressing wound. “I was so fucking worried. I looked everywhere for you, and when I couldn’t find you I thought…” Potter’s hands held his hips now, voice growing darker, more urgent. “I tried tracking Caipora down, but that damn woman was no help at all. I shouldn’t have left you alone, I’m so sorry. Are you… are you okay?”
“Great. This is simply great,” he huffed, rolling his eyes. His body was cooling down; the adrenaline ebbed away, doubts about his precipitated reaction assaulted his senses. “I’m lost in the very forest they told me not to brave alone. And whose fault is this? Potter, obviously. It had to be Potter,” he whinged, pushing his body off the tree and revelling in the way his knees didn’t falter. Talking made his throat hurt, but it kept his mind from wandering off too much. “Of course Potter had to be perfect on the other side of the fucking Atlantic Ocean; of course, everyone would rather be friends with Potter and think I—
“I don’t feel good. I think I’m going to be sick again…” Draco mumbled, and there he was again, throwing up. On Harry’s shoes.
Draco nodded, fear growing in his gut. He gulped it down with a shaky grin.
Of course, he still took that day to cool off and just laze around the place while he was alone.
The climb was steep, almost completely vertical, but Harry had been right when he had said those trees were heavily charmed. The one time Draco’s hand slipped, a strong root grabbed him by the wrist and waist, smoothly keeping him from falling.
Draco pursed his lips, very sure the reasons for Harry’s ashen pallor back whenever it had been had less to do with ‘London not having sun’ than with his state of mind. “Well,” he started, hesitantly, and then shrugged. “Not like here, there isn’t.”
He smiled, laughed, and then gave in and yelled with joy. Potter followed suit, their cries startling the closer birds, who sang in tandem with them.
All alone. Yes, sure. To transform something that should be romantic into an isolation. “I’ll come with,” Draco blurted.
Draco gave her a wan smile, still unsure how he felt about the girl. He should be thankful, though, with all the help she had given him so freely.
“Stop! Just stop!” Draco shouted, and added because he had manners, “Please.”
Draco tried to make out their words, and he was sure he had heard some of them before, but he couldn’t place them in his memories. Not with his heart hammering so hard in his chest. He doubted they couldn’t hear it, so when he revealed himself, stepping purposefully on a tiny branch, it was only the unavoidable result of that meeting.
Potter turned off the TV, and a soft song started playing somewhere in the house.
Draco wasn’t trying to avoid the inevitable—fixing everything and finally talking to Harry—when delaying talking to Lua. It was just that the woman, beyond hating him to no end, was also one of the creatures Draco had very much betrayed, albeit not on purpose. He did not know Lua’s capabilities, and she already looked scary as hell without him knowing what she could do to him.
“How many people did you tell I was coming, Potter?” Draco asked, after a third group of students interrupted their journey again.
Potter vanished with a gush of air, just like Francisca had done. This time, Draco kept his cool while watching the scene—however enthralling it still was.
“So, your name is a star as well,” Draco asked, covering a yawn with his hand.
It was larger now. And it had only been a few minutes. Draco couldn’t even see Harry or Tainara anymore, both hidden behind the curtain of Jurupari’s magic.
The new information had certainly piqued his curiosity, but he stored the knowledge for later once his eyes caught the sight of the thousands of books and scrolls piling up in front of him.
“Just stop. Listen…” Harry said softly, fingers lowering to touch Draco’s hand, leaving a warm trail on his skin. “Can you feel it?”
Draco was fine. He just had to survive a few days of it.
At first, Draco had thought he stumbled into a wizarding shop by accident, so strange were the myriad of knickknacks on the shelves, bright and enthralling. It wasn’t, but it felt comfortable enough that after three strolls down aisles full of treasures, he had calmed down.
He was honestly wondering if his legs would be able to carry him those last few steps when warm hands cupped his face.
!” she cried, trying very hard to keep a straight face. It didn’t work, and she was soon bending over the counter with laughter.
Then, he saw Machado, and he knew it was real, as the bird’s body absorbed every single tendril of light that came out of Draco.
.” The way Potter said it sounded like the word itself had some kind of hidden magic in it, and Draco believed him.
But it was too late.
Her eyes were bright again. “We go to the forest and pray she’ll meet with us.”
They’d done only a few rounds around the property before Potter took back the wheel, claiming Draco would hit a tree if he wasn’t more careful—both knew it wasn’t happening since he had charmed the car lock, stock, and barrel. But Potter was faster, and after he took control of the direction, it only took them about half an hour to reach the nearest town.
“Go on.”
“Yeah, why?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He liked it. Draco liked the taste of flying aimlessly, of flying beside Harry. He could get used to it.
“Say… no?” Draco repeated, just to be sure that wasn’t making sense to either of them. “To this dark you mentioned? I have to say no, is that it?”
Maybe Curupira had been right. Perhaps it was all about
Draco raised his head, took a deep breath.
And Draco… Well, he felt like he was being constantly watched. It wasn’t paranoia; it had been true in London after the war. It was true now. People stared at him from the corner of their eyes, averting their gazes whenever Draco noticed them.
“I think it likes you,” Potter said, sniggering.
Harry cried, body stiff and eyes unfocused. Until they found Draco’s, and he mouthed a muted, “Please,” before his greens were indistinguishable again.
Draco had asked about spirits, believing that surely a school as old as Castelobruxo—Homunin, he ought to remember that—carried deaths in its veins. Despite having read about shamanic magic before Portkeying to Brazil, he wasn’t really familiarised with it to understand its concepts. According to his superficial studying, though, shamans could establish connections with the spiritual world. Allegedly not every wizard was a shaman, but every shaman had to be a wizard. Potter added still that Homunin’s magic was focused on the subconscious and subjective, and that spirits roamed freely, but people weren’t able to see them unless they were properly and actively trying to make contact. Sometimes, during rituals or dances, they’d make collective contact, and if Draco was lucky, he’d be there for the next one.
“What?!” Potter cried, but he came to a halt.
But he wouldn’t! Because it was not the reason for his trip to Brazil.
“Okay?” That seemed to cool him down. Potter smiled, pointing with his head in the direction they had come from. “Let’s go for now, yeah?”
,” he said, approaching them in quick steps. “The Fire of Iaké went out. Everybody is going crazy.”
What?
Potter, the git, gave him that crooked smile again and shrugged. “Just a few.”
Draco suspected he was still shut out of the Dark Greenhouse, but he argued he didn’t really need to go in (for now), ignoring the bitterness spreading in his chest.
Potter went on, as if he didn’t notice the way Draco’s heart swooped in his chest whenever he glanced at him, and Draco continued with what he did best: he pretended everything was okay. According to his own lax life philosophies, once he repeated something enough, it’d become true.
he thought, and at the same time,
Draco huffed a breath. “Right. I’m moving back to the guest room, but I’m not leaving if that’s what you’re expecting. I’m going to fix this, and I’m doing it alone.”
“Shut up. I’m great. I’m going to be the best Eí owner this forest has ever seen.”
Potter grinned. “I know just the person to take you to Caipora.”
And screeched.
“You’re not running from me! We need to talk!” Draco yelled into the forest, but his only answer was another set of leaves rustling above him, a roar by his side. There was no one there, Draco convinced himself. It was all Curupira’s deeds. The creature was creating those noises, playing with his mind. He had to be. “Those tricks will not scare me! I’m not leaving until we talk!”
one—he had allowed to get close enough to break his heart.
What he
“I’m sorry,” he started again. “I’m so sorry, but I had to. You wouldn’t have talked to me.” And just once again, flinching “I’m sorry.”
She eyed him suspiciously, and didn’t move to take the pipe. Instead, Caipora said, “The same day you arrrive, boy, things starrrt to go wrrrong and my prrecious thing got stolen.”
they kept repeating. Potter had kindly translated it to “Harry’s friend” but Draco couldn't be sure. Not with Potter’s permanent smirk.
Nazaré didn’t answer him. She just raised her head, staring at Draco with those tiny eyes. Draco sighed and went on.
And although he was sure the guarana fruit—the magical variant he had to get his hands on—was responsible for one of these effects, Draco still had no clue which symptom it caused and how to find the other ingredient.
Potter got up, still beaming at him, and offered a hand to Draco. “Dance with me.”
with his broken self. It was good simply not being alone.
“How can we trap it again? The same way I opened it? With my Eí?”
Draco took a sobering breath.
Someone grabbed Draco by the shoulders, trying to drag him back again. He recognised the long, bony fingers as Berenice’s and the idea of himself breaking them flooded his mind in controlled images.
No. He had to change. He had to believe all the work he had done in the last seven years wasn't for nothing.
Well, he should be.
In Tupi (one of the indigenous languages in Brazil—there are almost 300 indigenous languages here in total) Cuca means “swallow something with a single gulp”.
Rudá followed him, almost seeming not to notice it. His lips spread in a wild, sardonic grin. “Yet—” Rudá added, shrugging and waving his hands as if whatever he was saying meant nothing, or if he wasn’t scaring the shit out of Draco, “—we decided to give you a chance for now.”
Potter—who was back to Potter now—levelled a smug grin at Draco. “You’re drooling,” he said, openly laughing at Draco’s first reaction to Castelobruxo.
“No. Normal plant.”
But that research
“What the fuck, Draco? What happened?” Harry said, grabbing his arms with more force than necessary. Draco was too weak to mind it that much. “The fuck did you do?”
“What was that?! She… it just… she was…” Draco tried, fighting the words tumbling out of his lips.
Draco didn’t see Potter the next morning, but he found toast and eggs on a Stasis Charm at the table.
The small woman stalked up to him, and Draco forced his body not to cower in front of her, only minimally flinching when she reached for his arm. The one with the Dark Mark staining his alabaster skin.
“The what, now?”
Berenice’s shield stretched larger, engulfing Draco and Francisca in it.
“It’s all lost,” he whined. “Harry, it’s all lost.”
the bloody flame at once.
Her eyes, locked on the fire, slowly turned to face Draco. “We don’t need your help here.” The way she stated it sounded like an accusation, more than a simple fact. She turned to the fire unceremoniously. “Look.”
He sat, legs trembling, eyes still staring at the blackness of the sky above his head, when he heard the leaves rustling on the tree on top of him.
Draco stared at him at a loss for words. What was Saci saying? The coconut was that seed from the story? Was he going to be cursed as well if he tried to meddle with things beyond his control? He could bet on that, still…
Owing Potter because of that help was an ache that kept niggling Draco’s ego. Staying with him was even worse.
Behind the golden palace, just visible from where Potter had slowed his car to an almost stop, was a waterfall. The edges poured water into a seemingly endless pit just below. Draco stared. He tried to
Draco tried not to
The truth was Draco was still afraid of opening up while Harry gave his entire self to him so easily. Harry was like this, brave on the surface, hiding his darkness where no one could tap. But Draco knew him better than that. Draco saw the secret in Harry’s eyes and he feared it. He feared it was too much for Harry to handle. Too much for them.
Potter’s smug grin was answer enough.
Seven years had done him good, Draco had to concede, staring at Potter’s profile. Right after the war, Harry had been a bundle of grief, guilt and sadness. Draco had met him then, himself being much of the same. It had been good for a while, having someone who understood him, having someone to… not to patch his wounds, but to just
Harry shrugged nonchalantly, filling two new mugs with the boiling water and dropping two tea bags inside them. “I had it a few times when I got here. Lua convinced me it could help me find my way.”
Curupira laughed, open-mouthed, head tilting back. No sound came from his mouth. Instead, the forest around them burst into roars, leaves rustling and animals crawling at his command. Draco refused to give in to fear, though his body almost recoiled unconsciously.
The monkey had the most curious eyes Draco had ever seen. It was small, white-furred, but its enormous eyes were surrounded by two single large circles of black fur. It lowered itself around several branches at once and hung from its tail on the one closest to the ground.
“What… What are you talking about?” He cleared his throat.
To know more.
Draco
Draco sat by his side, cautious as not to let their knees touch. “You must teach some manners to your snake, Potter.”
“Are you serious?” Draco asked.
more.
“If you are ssso sssure, then prove it to the foressst. But Dark Boy hasss to catch usss firssst.”
Perhaps Caipora and Lua had been wrong. Maybe it hadn’t worked. Maybe the power had stayed trapped inside the seed.
—throw it on the floor and see it shatter to a million pieces. It wouldn’t appease his temper, he’d learnt
However, the school was numb. Even when the sun was up and bright, everything seemed quieter, as if all the secrets had been laid bare when the shadows were taken from them. There was no way of hiding now. Everything, and everyone, was exposed.
Potter sighed, relieved, the smile creeping back onto his face. It was a beautiful sight. “Kind of. To my place, actually.” Harry—Potter!—was already shrinking Draco’s luggage—a heavy dark wooden trunk and a small hand case—and storing them in his pocket. “You can’t get to the school by magic like this. It doesn’t react well to Apparition or Portkeys.”
“It’s a rule. You have to watch Brazilian soap operas once in Brazil.”
you find me, Drrragon Boy.”
“You can call me Chica. And you’ll see soon enough the things we have to deal with here on a daily basis,” the woman said, a smirk playing on her lips. There was a threat to her tone, despite the mirth. “Now, Draco, Harry here told us a lot about you.”
There was something about the Brazilian weather—humid and warm—that made him slack and soft all over, willing to lie down after lunch and contentedly sleep until he felt numb and could no longer think. The effect was similar to what he felt after fucking Harry, Draco mused.
Tainara had told him that not only was Lua supposed to be one of those creatures from Brazilian folklore—Cuca, or something like that, and it explained
will open it.” Draco’s wand was in his hand in record time.
, and the wind suddenly stopped as the small hat flew rapidly to him. Draco ran and held it midair before Saci had time to make a run for it.
to laugh at that, ignoring the pressure building up in his chest. “Oh, I know. You made that abundantly clear.” And that was not a memory Draco was eager to relive. He did not spend the last seven years thinking about Harry. He didn’t miss him. His scent, his smile, his eyes that had been always searching for Draco’s. He absolutely didn’t. Seven years was a long time to forget.
Draco’s eyes grew wider as he surveyed Harry once again. “Are you this oblivious on purpose? Because Circe help me deal with you, Potter. You sent me a letter from miles away after you’d already left. You didn’t even think it was worth mentioning where you were.” It was a surprise and a relief to hear his own voice sounding as cool as his expression was, despite his increasingly fragile temper.
opening the damn seed, coconut, magically sealed locker. Whatever.
Draco couldn’t allow that. He wouldn’t lose Harry again.
Potter’s solution didn’t make things that much better, but it was something. It was better than nothing. It was…
Potter laughed as if he was trying to wake the dead.
“Yes, but you never go out at night. I had to get your attention some other way.”
He nodded once. Twice. Not
Harry shifted on his side, so that both their heads were resting against the fabric and their eyes met. He asked, “Honest answer?”
“That’s reassuring,” Draco muttered, fingers twitching with the need to break something. Potter’s neck would do, but he didn’t want to get too close.
No, he wasn’t.
close, but he couldn’t advance as well.
Draco felt the tears running down his cheeks, burning his skin with a pain he didn’t think he had ever felt before. Maybe it was his nightmare taking form, chasing him now. He couldn’t see Harry suffering like that. It would kill him if Jurupari didn’t.
This is a fascinating substance with incredible effects and I really want to try it someday.
And it now poured out of him, with his entrails spreading on the grass beneath his feet.
Saci and his red cap were gone in a second, leaving Draco staring at the leaves his wind had made whip above him, and at the midnight sun glowing in the sky.
Saci was surprisingly witty, with remarks as spirited as Draco’s own. And it was nice talking to someone who didn’t really have any expectations of him. Saci thought Draco was going to mess this up. Draco wasn’t sure he wouldn’t.
Draco didn’t know how Tainara would perform such a feat, and he made sure to grumble all the way to the library.
The tables scattered around were covered in typical food, most made of corn. There was also something called
Potter drank his own, scowling all throughout it, to Draco’s gratification. He then faced Draco, cheeks pleasantly flushed and eyes glinting. “So, what did you do while I was away?”
Draco had turned around and glanced back. The man was shorter than him; his golden skin glimmering in the not-quite-dimness of the store, and had a long, curved nose that reminded him too much of a crow. Brown hair cascaded down the man's face in purposefully tousled waves. Draco didn't understand how someone with this soft smile had such a deep and rough voice.
Draco retched again, coughing and brushing his hand across his lips, swaying to the side. “What does it mean?”
A strong and very unpleasant smell.
Saci asked, “What did ye drink?”
“He likes you,” Harry said one morning. “And I like him.”
Harry’s first breath after opening his eyes was so loud it drew their attention back to him in a second. Draco held him against his chest, while Harry’s coughing fit echoed throughout the room, raspy and dry. Draco caressed his face, as Saci bounced restlessly by the door.
It was not as difficult as Draco would’ve thought, considering the school grounds were gigantic and Draco was pretty sure both of them were avoiding him as well.
Draco took the first step in once the initial shock had ebbed away. There were so many spells knitted into the foundations of the house—extension charms, protection spells, sticking spells—that his words were completely lost. Not for the first time that day.
important that
The students, scattered just until now, gathered around their instructor, babbling excitedly and apparently still unaware of the stranger in their domain. Draco took the moment to watch the assortment of younglings Potter had under his care. Some looked older, taking over controlling the younger ones as Potter answered a girl in the corner. It was not that uncommon for schools to mix student’s classes based on aptitude. Still, he wondered how Potter managed such an odd assembly. He reasoned it was okay, since it was only a practical class. The controlled chaos suited Harry.
Are ye not?”
When she spoke, it was slowly, enunciating every word. “I. Zon’t. Care. You broke it, you fix it.
“Hey, it’s okay,” Potter’s fingers pressed against his skin, grounding him. Or, at least, making sure he was still standing. “You can stay at mine. It’s barely at the limit of the school's grounds, so you won’t be affected by the lack of the Iaké Ritual. And I can come with you whenever you need to do research here. I’m sure Zé and Chica wouldn’t mind accompanying you, either.”
Draco didn’t realise the sun hadn’t dawned, despite how long he stayed there, until the knock on the door echoed in the living room. Draco didn’t answer, he didn’t move, still holding Harry’s sleeping form between his arms.
,” Francisca started, disregarding Draco’s own internal storm and tugging at the rope to keep him close. Something apparently made sense to her, for she didn’t sound
“Who else what? Merlin. I’m not following. Can you be less cryptic, for Salazar’s sake?”
tended not to work quite as well for someone like
Draco couldn’t have imagined that a forest could be so loud. Draco had thought—from Neville's skewed perspective, probably—that this place would be quiet and introspective.
“Isn’t it afraid of us? Or, you know… going to eat us?” Draco added, though the creature was now nowhere to be seen. Surely it wasn’t the only one of their kind in that forest.
The stranger had approached Draco carefully, took the object from its display and handed it to him. “It was restored recently and works like new.” At Draco’s raised eyebrow, he pointed at another man behind the counter, a much older one. “It’s my uncle’s shop. I’m Martin.”
In the room’s gloominess—and his own panic fuzzed brain—Draco vaguely noticed the elongated body shifting over his stomach, punching a sigh out of him, smooth, cold scales dragging against his skin. The snake perked its snout up, small beady eyes staring intently at Draco, a forked tongue flicking in his direction.
“He ziz stupid! He can not do it!” Lua drawled.
“What the fuck.
. Draco nodded resignedly. “Are we Apparating there?”
He had heard it all at least twice a day over the course of the last few days, since Draco had formalised the Iaké ritual. Harry had taken it as a personal challenge to teach Draco all the magic he could perform once he was in the network, not really realising they had all the time in the world now.
. It was something different. Something Draco hadn’t felt even at Hogwarts.
“Ye’re not giving it back?!” Saci’s bouncing became more erratic.
Tainara moved on, “It’s called Kuarup, the true ritual, you know. It’s the name of wood. Tribe men get trunks from Kuarup trees and line them in front of the
Saci is a black, mischievous boy, with a smoking pipe and a red cap that gives him magical powers. He loves playing pranks and has a good time with them. His main hobbies include braiding horse’s tails, hiding objects from their owners, and whistling very loud. Saci can control the woods, and so he domains herbs and medicinal plants. He protects and cares for the sacred plants in his forest, and tricks people that are trying to collect them without his avail.
“And now, with Jurupari’s and Harry’s powers under my control.” Another hand went up. Harry mirrored her movement mechanically.
This is a quibble in Portuguese, but it means simply: to feel sick, so the bad will go/pass
“Who else was with you, Drrragon Boy?”
“Merlin,” he grumbled, torso bent forward and holding his churning stomach underneath his hands as nausea spread over his body. Heaving a deep breath, Draco made sure he could move without spewing, before saying, “Fuck. A little warning next time would be appreciated.”
“It’s okay, don’t worry.” Draco shook away the thoughts from his head, trying to concentrate on something else. “What is this song about?”
He wouldn’t.
His mouth was everywhere, dissolving Draco’s frown with kisses all over his face. Harry’s arms went around Draco’s shoulders, pulling him closer.
“Translate it for me?”
“Go away, Zark Boy. Leave.”
“Not owner.”
than I do. You’re
“Ayahuasca is not a drug, Draco. It keeps your senses open, but it was all you.”
Draco ignored that, following suit, and hesitated momentarily when his eyes caught the books abandoned on the grass—he wasn’t really getting anywhere on the other plant for his potion and was starting to fear being stagnant, but he still needed to return them.
But Saci didn’t stop. It didn’t even matter that Draco had the red hat when they both went rolling on the ground. Saci’s hand closed around Draco’s throat, the other trying to reach for the coconut or the cap that had fallen near, whichever was closer.
“Hey, Lua, he’s just—” Potter tried, but Draco rested a hand on his forearm.
It was true he didn’t love Martin as much as he would’ve hoped to—and still led him on. But he wasn’t
him to read it, Draco couldn’t be bothered to feel embarrassed. He didn’t know how to ask Tainara how she did it, and she didn’t offer an explanation, so he just read—with Tainara’s translation, of course.
Draco deflated. It was easy answering that. “Of course not. It’s my research.”
You work it out
Potter took him to the shack Draco recognised as the place he kept the materials he used to teach. When he picked up two bright new brooms, Draco raised an eyebrow at him. Potter had a sly grin on his lips, and he only shrugged, the challenge written across his face.
It wasn’t fair, though, that Draco’s heart had no preparation over the fact that the Boy Who Stubbornly Lived was there.
Saci kicked Draco’s heel with his only leg. “
The bird bit Saci’s head with its powerful beak, squeaking loudly. Saci didn’t let go of Draco, but he was so distracted trying to scare Machado away—and seemingly dissatisfied by whatever had happened—Draco just had to point his wand at the seed, near to where they had landed and screamed at the top of his lungs, “
.” A raised index pointed to the forest stretching opaque behind him.
Draco’s grimace creased even deeper. “Actually, I’m positively appalled to see you. Salazar, you’re going to be worse than Martin,” he muttered the last part under his breath, trying not to get too caught up in what it meant that Harry was there—and that Draco hadn't known that he would be! “At least now I know where you vanished to seven years ago. The middle of the woods, it seems. How do you like it? You were always one to enjoy being all muddy and messy, if I remember correctly. This must be your paradise, Potter.”
“And keep the zarkness inside it.”
Potter started the engine again, eyes on the trail ahead of them. “I’ll show you around once we get there. Then we’ll get you to your ritual and—”
“You didn’t have to. Machado there is an excellent guide, always pointing me in the right direction. I am cured of my reservations. I’m even friends with your crazy creatures now.” Draco approached him, resting a hand on Harry’s tattooed forearm, as if the lack of contact had him moving involuntarily. “How did you find me?”
Saci was right about that. There was no time.
That little cabin in the forest where they landed was
Draco doubted that. But he complied, because he was a good boy and he had no intention of distracting Potter and accidentally causing a car crash.
But, seven years from the war, he still wasn’t sure.
“I need to help him,” he said feebly.
inconvenient, useless fire. How dare she douse it?
Who may...? Who can...?
Well, it made sense. The jaguar had beautiful fur. But Draco didn’t believe dressing splendidly was enough to justify killing innocent animals. He said so. That was probably the right answer, because Harry gifted him with a larger grin.
He had suspected that.
, he remembered.
She was gone before Harry arrived, and his face creased in a frown. “I was about to rescue you from her.”
“Great. You, Mr Potter, will assist him. I do not trust Mr Malfoy here alone any longer.”
“It means you can’t stay here, Mr Malfoy.”
When his imaginary self vanished everything with a quick spell, the real Draco had a pleasant—if a little strained—grin on his face. He glanced at the clerk attending to him.
,” he heard someone say. Was it Tainara’s voice? Draco wasn’t sure. Her face was… Not hers, but a darker and shapeless transfiguration of the girl he had met before.
Fucking hell, how are we going to fix it?
He hadn't been able to kill Dumbledore when he tried, but he hadn't wanted to, in reality. He gave Martin up, but he had never really loved his former fiancée. Draco came really close to giving up after the war, but he hadn't. He gathered his pieces after Harry left, when the world still hated him, and made something of himself. He studied, he started his research; he changed what his name meant.
Potter had taken Draco to the alluring library right after breakfast, guiding him through Castelobruxo’s labyrinthine corridors. The inside of the castle was drowned in shadows, lit only by scarce flowing light spheres on the ceiling and some torches on each wall. The long halls seemed to stretch endlessly, filled with golden veins encrusted in the stone, drawing figures and patterns that bore too much of a resemblance to Harry’s tattoos. Draco expected the warmth to hit torrid levels inside that enclosed space, but a fresh breeze accompanied them on their way.
Draco hummed, flipping the pages so distractedly it took him a moment to notice the book had allowed him to touch it. “According to some old testimonials, two key ingredients were used in the potion I’m working on. Devil’s Eye and Leggy Mushroom are the names the wizard who found them used, but neither Potter nor myself found anything about them. I’m guessing something got lost in the translation.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, finally pushing his body up.
Harry rushed things as if it would be their last day on earth. Draco let him for a while, lavishing in the attention he finally got from Harry, and not applying himself fully to Harry’s impossible tasks.
!” Saci chided, but he didn’t correct Draco.
Draco huffed, raking a hand through his face. “I can’t believe you didn’t even consider him just because he saved some people once!” More than once, and Draco himself at least thrice if he was counting the way Harry saved him with his love.
When Caipora and Lua said he would release a dark power after opening the seed—a power that would possess him—Draco had assumed he would be the only one harmed. He hadn’t imagined this power could cause such havoc in the school.
“Why do you want to make it, anyway?”
Draco had
Draco repeated internally, but it did no good this time.
“I’m fine. Fuck. What was that?”
Maybe she did.
Draco nearly laughed hysterically as he realised he was fulfilling a childhood dream—walking hand in hand with a
“It was not him,” Lua whispered, almost inaudible.
He shouted Harry’s name; tried to leave the protection of the weak shield with no regard for his own safety. He didn’t care about himself. Draco had to get to Harry.
“Well, the rest is a long story,” Potter chortled. “And what about you? I hear you’re here because of a… is it some kind of research?”
Pretending they had
The greenhouse, one of the Practical Studies Section’s features, was pretty much most of what Draco wanted to see on the trip. The place was supposed to hold many plants and herbs that Draco was eager to start studying. But, more interesting than that was the recounting of Longbottom about a Dark Greenhouse that Castelobruxo harboured, hidden from the curious eyes of the students. It held the most dangerous plants, or the ones that only grew in the absence of light, some strong candidates for the ingredients used in his researched potion.
Draco hadn’t known what the bloody hell was a
After that clear dismissal display, though, the book refused to open again to Potter, as if knowing he was going to read it to Draco. Potter told him what he remembered, but apart from a passage about an old ritual that shaman used to perform on recently deceased people, it didn’t really help him. Draco supposed it was something significant if the school didn’t want him to know, but there was really nothing he could do about it before he won Homunin over.
The macaw guided him back. Draco followed gladly, fatigue wearing him down. The animal had proven himself to Draco, earning not only Draco’s trust, but also a name.
Draco held the animal at arm's length, a bit blinded by its colourful feathers. “Don’t go getting any ideas,” he said. The macaw blinked, unfazed. “And you are
"Mal" means bad
Harry nodded, a sad smile on his face as he took his hands away from Draco, and with them all his warmth. “I understand.”
Surely Potter knew what he was doing. He had been there for a lot longer than Draco—seven
It was just that Draco was getting used to being around Potter again. And in all fairness, Potter
“Not really… But I bet he’d like that too.”
It didn’t last long.
“When Harry’s not giving lessons or picking you up, he’s our assistant,” José added, and shrugged. “He’s alright.”
“You said it’s probably guarana, and a mushroom. I just have to look out for those. How hard can it be?”
Potter barely acknowledged his student before grabbing Draco’s wrist and dragging him back to the car.
Draco snorted inelegantly, finally tearing his eyes from the trees. Harry stared at him with a smile too open, eyes too bright. Draco felt weak in the knees, and preened unashamedly. “Of course you do.”
From Tupi, kaa’póra
Draco hadn’t really got a treatment like that from Harry since… Well, since Hogwarts. He gritted his teeth, pressing his fist strongly against the tabletop. “I was drugged.”
However, perking his head up a little, Draco did realise trees and plants crossed their way seamlessly, not one of them posing a threat. They hadn’t even come close to hitting anything. Not to say that the high speed was doing any favours to his thumping heart.
Surely he would remember how Draco got when he was pressured like this. Possibly the same way he got when he was hungry, sleepy, thirsty, or just in a foul mood overall. Cranky and sardonic.
“What the—” Draco pulled back, hand burned and spasming from the shock. There was no apparent wound on his skin, only a slight red stain and the memory of the sting.
“I thought you were past that hating each other thing.” Longbottom scratched at his nape, making an effort not to stare at Draco.
The sharp, crackling rustle of leaves was almost deafening against the acute whistle elicited by the dancing wind as it travelled around the trees. Branches creaked everywhere, insects churred close to him, and then so far he could barely make them out against the background noise. Animals rooting and scrabbling underfoot and in the trees rustled within the bubble of pulsating life around him.
“Wow,” one student let out, staring at him, mouth agape.
And that was also what might have caused the end of his engagement, if he was being honest. Draco said some nasty things to Martin in the end. His ex had believed half of them, but Draco knew that most of what he said wasn't true. He didn’t try to rectify himself when he shoved the ring into Martin’s chest, nor when he left England. There was no point in fixing a relationship he didn’t want anymore, and Martin was better off without him.
Cursing his own daylight brooding, Draco tried to come up with a context for what had granted the student that answer. Potter beckoned for him to come over, and Draco did, though he was reluctant to deliver himself so openly to the array of scrutinising gazes.
Partially fine, at least.
It was getting ridiculous. But every time Draco gathered the courage to talk to Harry, he found he didn’t really want to hear what Harry had to say.
It was only then that the rest of the picture started to make sense to him. The buzz in his ears gave way to the loud arguing, the teachers’ yelling trying to rise above the students’. Draco tried to make out what they were saying, but could only figure from his meager Portuguese that they were trying to send those few who were still scattered around the field back to their dormitories.
“It’s perfect, thank you. And nice to meet you.” Draco said, politely enough to offer a hand. The girl—he assumed she was at least seventeen—shook his hand so vigorously he considered it might fall off.
“I have this. Do you… want it?” He stretched his arm in her direction and counted it as a win when the creature didn’t flinch away from him. “It’s just… it’s…”
“Again,” she added. “All you have to do… is say no.”
It made sense why none of them dressed like proper wizards—wizards Draco was familiar with, at least. He suddenly found everything he brought unsuitable and out of place, much like himself. He made a mental note to ask Potter where he could buy some new clothes, because wearing his robes in the forest was going to leave him with no robes at all.
The girl just shrugged. “Who knows? They might.”
Harry was fighting it. Draco knew that.
But Martin hadn’t been the only problem, as much as Draco avoided staring at this truth with too much attention. Martin was a good man and wonderful to Draco, which made it all… harder. How could someone like him deserve something so good? It was not fair that Draco had a chance of happiness when he had done so much bad in his life. And it was not fair that all Martin got was Draco and he could never truthfully return his feelings.
But the truth was: Potter trusted him too much, when Draco himself wasn’t sure he deserved that trust. Or that he trusted himself.
The force of the waterfall, even if it was so very far from them, still sprayed water in their direction, ensuring a brief reprieve from the warmth. It was not enough to quench the searing burn of the sun on their skin.
He conceded after not much thought, to be honest, and fell easily into step with Potter. His hands came around Potter’s neck as he held Draco’s waist. The song was slow, a husky voice singing verses about love Draco couldn’t understand, but he
It didn’t matter. Draco would have time to go back there soon, without the disrupting presence of Potter’s eyes, his voice, his whole body.
Draco was still in awe at how deep the knowledge of the girl ran, but he realised it was probably because she lived there. She breathed those stories daily. She also taught him other legends, and tried to explain to him how magical these lands were; alive, pulsing, sentient. Draco could
What the fuck was Potter blabbering around about him?
“Oh my God, Draco!
The brawny man from the butchery treated Potter like an old friend, babbling loudly and ignoring Draco’s presence almost completely. Even the old woman at the only clothing store in sight seemed to be acquainted with Potter on a first name basis, grinning at every terrible joke Potter made—Draco assumed they were terrible, barely understanding a word of Portuguese.
Francisca’s fingers tightened on his wrist. “Don’t listen to her,” she warned.
Literally "friend", but also used as an endearment term, like "buddy" or "mate"
Potter shrugged. “Not really. But I love it here enough that it feels like home.”
(See the end of the chapter for
. Not from Martin, not from anything. Draco went because of his research. Why did people keep assuming there was another reason behind it?
Draco gaped at him, wondering how a soda would be worse than alcohol, but nodded.
Machado squeaked in greeting, flying around their heads. Draco didn’t approach the boy with the red cap, keeping a safe distance between them, back leaning against a tree.
“I like your hair like this,” Harry said, after their silence extended for too long.
“We had nothing serious…” Harry repeated what he used to say endlessly in the past. It felt as if no time had passed at all, but in the worst way possible.
He shivered, containing the arousal heating his lower body with alarming speed when memories of their bodies lying together, blanketed by warming charms, washed over him. The pull of Apparition had been strong, but it was nothing compared to the feeling of Potter’s magic enveloping his skin again.
“You just need me and the seed.” Saci blinked, as if it resolved all of their issues. “Just do what you need and I’ll boost it.”
Draco raised his head, facing Saci still bouncing by the door.
“Caipora told me to wait, which is useless,” Draco went on. “You can’t possibly expect me to just sit around, clean your house and keep your snake company all day. Besides, I need new clothes. Clothes that won’t leave me melting on your floor.”
Caipora scowled. “But he
Caipora said she’d be watching, but he didn’t think she meant it literally. Otherwise, she had certainly watched how lost he was during the next hours. By the time Draco reached Potter’s house, he was a mess. He was shaking, starving, and could barely speak, his throat was so dry. His knees almost gave up on him when he finally caught sight of the blessed stone path that led to Potter’s cabin.
He heard a soft, “We’ll talk later, Draco,” before everything went dark again.
“The what?!” That was it. Draco took his hands back and pushed the stranger with so much force the man stumbled back.
“What…” Draco started, his voice cracked. He tried again. “What can I do? How can we… There has to be something. Harry can’t be.”
, but he wasn’t about to prevent Potter from saving whoever—or whatever—needed him. Merlin knew what would happen if he interfered with the man’s sense of saviourship.
But when Tainara opened the same volume Potter had tried before and slid it towards Draco, he had to shut up. Though Draco avoided touching it, the book didn’t close itself on his face again. It actually let him read it. Weird as it was to be happy that a book
“You could stay,” Harry whispered against Draco’s stomach.
“Tupã ordered the natives to plant the boy’s eyes, and a tree grew from it. Guarana. The fruit looks like tiny eyes and gives energy to people.” She smiled at Draco. “You should really try the soda. Talk to Harry about it.”
The wind swept around him so fast Draco barely registered what happened. It was exactly like it had been that day he met Rudá. The whirlwind disturbing the woods, leaves whipping his smooth skin.
“For controlling him.”
Potter grinned, taking off so fast Draco had only had time to grip the open structure of the jeep as the inertia punched a breath out of his lungs.
He had tried reaching her near the greenhouse, but the place was so tightly shut against his presence that the magic prevented him from getting close to it way before he was near the building. And so Draco waited. Lua would have to leave at one point.
Potter shrugged. “I cleared my schedule. You have me for the day.” Couldn’t Potter see that was exactly where the danger lay? Having his full attention wasn’t good for Draco’s frayed nerves. But then, Potter added, “Also, I don’t think you can read Portuguese.”
“Nothing, really. I’m
Draco stopped, stared at his wobbly legs, his shuddering fingers. He was so tired of running. Of pretending. Of masking who he had been so people wouldn’t hate him so much. Of accepting he deserved less than everybody else.
“I don’t know. Use your charms. I know you to be very inventive.” Harry gave him that fucking crooked smiled that only made Draco's temper boil even hotter. Harry pressed Draco’s forearm before releasing him. His still burned to the memory of the recent touch. If it wasn’t for the dire situation, he would swear Potter was flirting with him.
“It’s a capybara,” the stranger said, still with their back to Draco. They sounded like a woman, voice deep and a bit muffled, as if all that hair prevented her from talking. “You humans come and take, take,
Still left out of the network, Draco could barely understand more than a few words that the students were saying. He was sure that there were over two languages being spoken at the same time. The refusal of the school stung deeper, and he put his notebook down, temporarily giving up his notes about the tomes Tainara had got open for him.
Draco shrugged. “Do you all revert to Portuguese when you are mad? This is going to make things harder.”
Before, Draco would feel narked by his school nemesis’ cool demeanour, certain that Potter’s self-absorption meant nothing but arrogance and self-worth. He knew better now. He had known better right after the war.
He hesitated, hand hovering over Potter’s forearm, before resting loose fingers on warm skin—Potter’d always been hotter than anyone else—noticing distantly a lack of wand.
Or in heaven.
It couldn’t be.
, the creature Tainara confirmed Lua was, with the help of the young indigenous girl. However, every tome they found revealed different things about the myth surrounding Cuca and her story, and Draco still did not know how to approach her. It was not like offering a cigar and liquor would appease her, like it did to Caipora or Curupira, or as if he could trap her by holding her cap like he did to Saci. She didn’t even use a cap, as far as he noticed, and had no apparent weakness.
The jaguar’s purring became a low, low growl that got the hair on Draco’s neck standing on edge. He looked up, facing Rudá’s pink eyes, darker and more feral under the moonlight. Shivering, Draco backed away with another step.
Potter shrugged. “Yeah, sort of. You can come with, but I’ll have to go to the forest and…” He stared at Draco from top to bottom, pointedly glancing at his inconvenient clothes. Draco abstained from pointing out that he was a researcher, not an explorer, and that he had packed accordingly.
Guarana is one, but I’ll only be sure once I find it.”
Harry flinched again, this time harder, pulling away almost a step. He cast his gaze downward, briefly focusing on Draco’s lips instead of his grey eyes.
“It’s a
did it. It was important for him. Important for the people he treated.
Well, there had to be something wrong. It couldn’t be right that someone like
Iara was a beautiful indigenous warrior from an Amazon tribe. She was powerful and loved by all, save her two brothers, that were extremely jealous and enraged by her overshadowing them. They decided to murder her while she slept, but she was a better warrior and killed them instead. Afraid of the wrath of his father, the pajé (or shaman), Iara fled. But he found her and as punishment, threw her at the river. The fish, however, took pity in the beautiful woman and transformed her into a creature half-fish, half-human. To this day, Iara drowns every man that crosses her path. If they manage to escape, they go insane. Iara or Yara means “that who lived at the water.”
Draco only saw Potter again at night when he cooked Draco dinner as an apology for leaving him alone for the rest of the day. It was something called
Draco was the first one to notice the controlled ball of fire floating. Its flames swayed in a choreographed dance around them, circling the trees, running, and floating higher, then lower, as if it was alive. Draco wouldn’t be surprised if it was, considering everything he had seen.
“Yes, I’m so stupid. I should’ve listened to you. You clearly know
To Brazilians, though, the full moon had a different significance. Well, not all Brazilians, as Tainara explained, but the period was paramount to indigenous people.
Draco sighed, taking the offered broom. It was unfair how Potter still seemed to know him, how Draco’s mind worked, how to distract him. And Draco never backed away from a challenge—unless it was called Martin and wanted to marry him—especially not one coming from Potter.
Caipora mumbled feebly, “Who—
He told her everything, narrating the night’s episode in frightening details, while Francisca helped fix his hair, only after concluding she was going to use scissors—
Not that Draco was actively looking for right answers.
According to Potter, they were right at the centre of the castle and the school’s ground. For centuries it had been considered a sacred tree by the people inhabiting these lands. When the time had come to build a haven for wizards and witches, it was only natural that it converged at this point. The tree kept growing in size through the years, a feat that could only be explained by the obscene amount of magic that fed it daily.
“I don’t feel well,” the words tipped out of his lips, rememberals of a language he didn’t really realise he spoke, even if he’d done that for his entire life.
Draco’s eyes darted from the pipe to her. “Who are you talking about now? I never know with you people. Half the time any of you talk I can’t follow, especially with Tainara.”
“Good riddance,” she told him, when Draco laid out for her the events of the untoward night one by one.
Machado suddenly appeared from wherever he had been hiding, positioning himself defensively in front of Draco, stretching his wings to protect him from Harry’s Dark magic.
Draco wondered how much of the tale was true. He took in the Headteacher’s appearance with fresh eyes. She didn’t look like a mermaid. But she did seem strong and Draco didn’t doubt Berenice could take him down any day.
Draco rolled his eyes, tapping his fingers on the floor and cursing how his ego inflated at that.
He belonged there, because he was
Harry dared to smile at Draco, a relaxed grin shaped by dark stubble, as if no time had passed at all. As if he was happy to see Draco.
“The seed. I opened it. I opened the bloody seed.”
“There are animals playing cards… This is it, I’m out of my mind,” Draco muttered. He was ready to turn around and be lost in the forest forever when his stalker-parrot flew from his shoulder, landing on the stranger in white instead. It was a good thing that the animal finally left him alone, but the pang of betrayal still stung.
Draco disentangled himself from her in a swift motion. “It’s not! Is this about my past?” He ground his teeth, planting his feet on the ground, arm stretched forward showing the patch of skin where the Dark Mark stained him in a faded reddish-grey. “I am
“You ought to teach me how to drive your monstrosity, Potter. It’s inconceivable that I have to stay locked in your house all day while you go gallivanting around the forest,” Draco started, chin pointed at the atrocious thing Potter called his car, parked close to the front porch of the house. “It’s not like you don’t have time for me. It’s vacation time—I still can’t understand how you let the students go home after having just started classes, but—this is not the point. You can’t say you don’t have the time
“No. Not a jaguar. A smaller species.”
“It’s a school, Potter!”
But now he had to leave.
Draco usually tried not to think too much about the things he missed—waking up to the green curtains of his four-poster bed at Hogwarts, ruffling the feathers of his old owl when he got too anxious, Christmas at the Manor, Harry’s hug, and now, apparently, flying. There was no reason to dwell on things he couldn’t get back. So, he didn’t.
hass everything, and you have nothing. Not him, not the school, not your resssearch. He isss taking it all from you again," Curupira said, but his next sentence didn’t sound like himself. "
“Harry, please. Please, wake up.” But no matter how much Draco cried, tears dampening his face, Harry didn’t move.
“You don’t like Harry very much.” It was not a question.
Saci looked unsure, his bouncing more harmonic than Draco had ever seen before. That couldn’t be right. It didn’t look right, but it didn’t look wrong either.
He held the small, dancing flame that the Headteacher floated to him. It didn’t burn, as Harry said it wouldn’t, weird as it felt holding an immaterial source of power in his palms. Increasingly so when it didn’t get absorbed into Draco's chest at all.
“Oh, it’s just a formality,” Potter clarified, waving his hand dismissively. “Don’t worry. The school likes to know who enters its grounds. It’s kind of like a light bond of sorts.”
Draco’s eyes found Harry’s, green again, albeit distant, full of sorrow and pain. It didn’t matter. Draco would help him heal. Draco would be by his side. He’d never leave Harry again. Or let Harry leave.
What did he have to do with Caipora losing her shit around the forest? If he had to spend another day in the woods for the rest of his life, it’d be too much. Draco was becoming tired of it all. Not being accepted by the fucking network, these creatures—whatever they were—doubting him, the mistrust, suspicion, all when he had not even been there for three days.
Draco recoiled, feigning indignation.
He apologised either way.
“They’re fine. I’m sure they’re fine,” Draco stuttered through gritted teeth, ignoring the pain building in his burnt skin. His eyes went back to Saci, who was already backing away as silently as he could. “I just found you fainted on the floor, Potter. You can’t possibly expect me to just let you go deal with these creatures’ stunts now, right? I’m sure it was just Curupira pulling some of his tricks.”
Draco’s eyes snapped open, focusing on Potter, even if it was too dark to make out his precise expression. It was better this way. The night hid secrets Draco wasn’t sure he was willing to uncover, and they were right there, on the edge of Potter’s features.
“I’m sorry, Mr Malfoy, but this is it. Homunin is very sensitive, and it doesn’t… appreciate your presence here.” She was unyielding, voice grave and that grin with too many teeth completely gone. Headteacher Albuquerque did seem, right at that moment, even scarier than McGonagall—if that was possible.
The woman left them, and Draco felt his knees give in to his weight, his body slouching even more.
Draco glanced at the silhouette of his new friend disappearing around the brightness of the palace of Homunin. “This castle doesn’t really match with any of the other buildings here…” he murmured, unsure if Tai would hear, or if that mattered.
Berenice’s fingers were holding him down, preventing him from leaving. Draco barely acknowledged her, snapping his eyes at Tainara once again. “Why?! Why would you do that? You’re hurting him! What do you get out of this?”
Longbottom was right, of course. Just as Draco had said, he was here for his research. It should be obvious that he wouldn’t give it up so easily.
Harry Potter was not a sacred being, he was not incapable of wrongdoings. Harry Potter, above all, was
Potter only seemed to notice his quietness when Draco remained silent throughout an entire episode of
Draco’s grin went up another note. “Because I thought you were either going to kill me or never talk to me again.” And if he had yet another friend turning on him, Draco didn’t know if he could make it.
. His lips locked with Harry’s again, in a desperate attempt to swallow the words Harry repeated like a mantra only Draco could hear.
In reality, he had no idea what to do. Caipora and Lua had been extremely vague about the
Harry returned his smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes, lifting an arm so that Machado could land on it. “What are you doing here? I was worried,” he said, brushing a hand on the feathers on the bird’s head.
But the trees had no marks. They remained the same, green leaves shining in a golden glow under the strong sunlight, reminding him the world was still the world, even if he didn’t feel like himself anymore. It was not necessarily a bad thing, though. There was a kind of peace knowing that some things stayed the same after time had passed.
, she’d said. He supposed it was. Draco was just having a hard time picturing what
Draco’s eyes widened for a second before he caught sight of Potter’s rueful grin as the wizard scurried out of the room without another word.
“Ye’re no fun,” Saci grumbled, but he was smiling—an occurrence that was becoming quite normal during the last few weeks.
It was mostly Harry’s fault, Draco thought. But the place, Homunin and Brazil, and the Rainforest, had their share of the blame. “I like it here. I never thought I would say that.” Or honestly come to like the place, but he did. And it was easier admitting it to José than to the one person he shared a bed with every night.
!” he screamed. The pull of the forest protecting one of its own, resisting his spell, was almost too much and Draco finally felt, for a second, the connection of that place.
Machado was always by his side nowadays, so he wasn’t really afraid of getting lost in the forest anymore. But, of course, there was the tiny detail that all the creatures that lived in there probably hated Draco by now. Well, he had dealt with far worse during and after the war. He could handle Caipora and Curupira’s disapproval.
Harry scowled. “No. I was in a really dark place when—Anyway, Ginny had a hard time when she came visiting, too. It didn’t last long.
The quietness of the place was getting under his skin. He pulled the collar of his robes, trying to keep his smile in place.
The hand fell so heavy on his shoulder, Draco didn’t even have time to compute it before he was being pulled into a vortex of wind. It was worse than Apparition, Draco thought distantly, as his body dematerialised to then become whole again. Maybe he just wasn’t used to it yet. Draco didn't know if he wanted to.
He turned to Berenice, but she wasn’t there anymore, nor was Tainara or his stalker-parrot—though, Draco mused, he hadn’t seen Tainara when he ran to the fire, and the bird might have just flown off in fear.
“Oh, wouldn’t Harry
Draco had no intention of running away from
be something Draco craved now.
It had to be a very sick joke. Someone ought to remind Potter that he was terrible at making jokes.
Draco himself wasn’t sure about what had happened, and if not for the sun shining bright above him and burning his sensitive skin, he would think everything he saw and did had been a product of his drugged mind.
“I will leave you to it, then.”
Draco’s nightmare, he realised, was being without Harry. Nightmares were coming to life, but he wouldn’t let it happen. “I can do that. You know it, otherwise you wouldn’t have come back. You’re such a coward.” Draco tsked, rolling his eyes.
“Can you?” Draco questioned petulantly.
The only source of light was the weak sun's rays filtered by black clouds. Shapeless shadow figures roamed all around, either stalking behind voiceless students or pacing aimlessly like his memories of Dementors, as dark as one, but translucent and fuzzy. There was no fire, no light, almost no magic anymore. There wasn't even sound. Everything had been muffled by a deafening screeching coming from the castle.
Tainara tipped her head to the side. “Not really. Who is Salazar?”
“Fuck you.”
“He was a…” Draco exhaled, waving a hand. “Never mind. What are you doing?”
, a white powder that became a fine, solid round dough once heated. Potter filled it with two types of cheese and chicken. It was like nothing Draco had tasted before, but he was becoming less and less resistant about embracing Brazil’s eccentricities.
“Right…” Draco frowned, but stored the information anyway.
It felt like
Someone very attached to money, stingy. A boring person.
Francisca had said, to which José added,
Draco raised an eyebrow. “If I remember correctly, Potter, you were not much of a dancer back then.”
“Fuck,” Harry curses. “I thought I hit you with the curse! Don’t scare me like that again!”
Harry doesn’t remember answering, but Draco returns for what feels like milliseconds later, a glass of something that glitters under the pale moonlight.
The heels of his boots knock loudly on the wooden floors as he makes his way out of the miniscule room. Soon enough, the same cluster of letters and symbols appears in the doorway. 568Q+6J7 must be the building number or code.
In the past, Draco didn’t know where to draw the line between Harry and Skar sometimes. It’s as though Skar has always been in Harry’s shadow, and Draco was just too blinded by Harry’s light to see him — to see Harry’s true colours.
North hisses, but doesn’t let this phase him as he cracks his neck. “What, Potter? Afraid that your little Auror might find out your secret?”
Draco appears from the kitchen, nose dusted with flour and his platinum hair a disheveled mess. “What took you so long?”
are now displayed on Harry’s nightstand inside of an hourglass. Draco quite likes it — says it has a lot of character. Harry agrees.
Draco stands on unsteady legs, his lowered wand remains gripped tightly in his hand.
“Harry,” Draco whispers as his breath catches in his throat.
“I have to be in the Philippines soon,” Malfoy says, his voice laced with emotion. What is he crying about? This isn’t exactly a depressing moment, is it?
Today, Draco investigates somewhere far in the South Luzon, in the small town of Los Baños, Laguna.
“Was I…” Draco trails off, his voice a little hesitant before he clears his throat. “Did I die? In your flashback?”
I know you’ve tried to date after me. But none of them compares—none of them ever will, and I take great pride in that.
“What kind of sick game are you playing?” Draco says, not once lowering his wand from North’s direction. “You’re supposed to be dead. Your name is in Skar’s file.”
Relief washes over Draco at the sound of the ever-so-familiar voice. He turns and is met by the sight of Harry, disheveled yet glorious, Elder Wand in hand and pointed right at North.
By the time the viewing comes to an end, dusk has already settled within the atmosphere. Harry waits for Draco at the balcony of the loft, looking over the last of the crowd attempting to have a peek at the famous work of Draco Black.
And as if Draco’s year isn’t tough enough, he received terrible news from Weasley this morning.

“Hope you’re enjoying the garden, Petunia, isn’t it lovely?” he murmurs as he wraps up his bundle of flowers to create a makeshift bouquet.
“That’s how humans are, naturally,” Draco says as he shuffles onto the bed, which ends up with him almost laying on top of Harry. “Just checking if I did a good job of healing your wounds, otherwise I’d have to call Sylvie.”
The vast world is laid under a canopy of stars that night, the moon is the most beautiful and brightest that Draco has ever seen it.
Auror Garcia cocks her head, her dark bob glowing golden under what’s left of the sunlight. She steps closer to the victim, squinting her eyes as to inspect the victim.
“I will if you do,” Harry says, his voice groggy with sleep.

Harry falls silent and his expression goes blank. An uncomfortable feeling settles within Draco, and he wonders if he’s done something wrong.
“I’ll buy you a new one,” Harry promises, before sucking into the crevice of Draco’s collarbone. He travels his mouth lower, and Draco stiffens beneath him when his lips touch a raised scar on his chest.
Harry’s not sure he could’ve ever prepared himself for what he’s about to see when he flutters his eyes open: every inch of Draco’s scarred skin laid bare him. Harry’s mouth falls agape as his chest fills with guilt. His eyes trace along every scar, as though he’s trying to count the mistakes he’s made.
“Draco,” his name drips from Harry’s mouth like poetry. Harry places his palm on Draco’s chest, right where his beating heart is, and it
.” It’s the only warning Draco gets before being pulled into a world made up of North’s memories.
“What?” Malfoy asks in surprise. “You’re coming with me? Don’t you have some other event to attend to?”
Draco peers at the window to look at the moon, but he finds it has now dipped in the shadows. The trees outside sway in different directions, tossed by an icy breeze that pours from the open window.

that this is forever — his paradise of owning Malfoy becoming everlasting.
There is no denying how tense and humid the air has turned, as though it’s suddenly the middle of scorching summer instead of the tolerable winter in the tropical country.

It’s only then Harry realises his adoration for Malfoy has developed into something so much more.
“Forgive me, mother,” Draco whispers through bloody lips. “For who I’ve become, but mostly for who I have not.”
Harry’s heart flutters with warmth more intense than the heat of the sun, “I’ll come visit,” he promises, pressing his lips against Draco’s damp forehead. “Shower?”
Draco would say if he isn’t on the brink of losing his job. “Well, I suppose it doesn’t affect the quality of my work, does it?”
The sulfur odour of the space fills Harry’s nose as the water rises beneath him. He is sixteen again, in front of Draco’s limp body as he bleeds out crimson liquid on the floor, his blood turning translucent when it becomes mixed with the waters.
Harry thanks her, just to be polite, before flicking his cigarette on the ground and crushing it under his boot. He takes one last look at Vernon’s grave before disappearing into the darkness of the night.
With this comes the suspicion that Skar is leading Draco on… or rather,
Tell me, Harry, is it because of me? Did a piece of you die with me that night when I took a killing curse for you?
“Quidditch Season is over, and nothing else is more important than you. So I’m coming with you to the Philippines.” Harry says more than asks — he’s clarified that he’s coming with Malfoy, whether or not Malfoy likes it.
Fondness elicits within Harry as Scorpius comes into vision under the cerulean sky. In front of it stands a cluster of people who anticipate the grand viewing of Draco’s latest masterpiece.
Harry raises a single eyebrow at Malfoy’s word choice. “You’re always
To Draco’s surprise, Harry only beams, and it sparks a rush of warmth within Draco. He always thought Harry’s smile was like the sun.
To Draco’s frustration, Harry doesn’t. And by the time Draco has tired himself of punching, Harry is all cuts and bruises. Despite this, not once has he laid a hand on Draco.
He can’t pinpoint why, but the combination of symbols he found on the victim yesterday continues to linger in his mind and even haunts his dreams.
“Harry,” Draco says a little more firmly. “A mind healer. Have you not seen one?”
He blinks twice and lets his eyes gaze over the parchment for a moment. After what seems like hours, he finally decides to keep it.
,” Draco echoes. “If you have nothing to hide, then answer my question,” he takes a deep breath, uncertain if he really is ready for the wrath of the truth.
With a last look at the Dursley’s old home, Harry touches the Portkey inside of his back pocket, disappearing with the whirl of the autumn wind.
But alas, here comes a person pretending to be Skar, ready to steal the spotlight away from Harry. It fills him with rage, knowing someone is vaguely threatening to steal Malfoy away from him. How dare this person challenge Harry? Do they know who they’re dealing with?! For fuck’s sake, Harry didn’t come this far just for everything to be taken away by some low-class wanna-be!
Warning: Blood, Biting, Love Bites, Bruises
Draco’s hand shakes, and he knows Harry can snatch the wand from his hand if he wanted to. Maybe Draco will let him.
The funeral ends right when it starts drizzling. Sunny, one of Dudley’s childhood friends, smiles pitifully at Harry as she passes by. “I’m sorry for your loss,” she says, as though there was even someone to lose in the first place.
The last thing Draco pictures before he’s consumed by an extremely bright light is his Mother’s face peering down at him.

The vibration of Draco’s moan ignites a fire within Harry. He pulls his finger out of Draco’s mouth with a pop and drags it along his jaw, all while silver starlit eyes stare into his soul.
The world spins around him, his visions transform into blurs of light as he feels a tug in his navel. He closes his eyes, trying to silence the ringing in his ears, and when he opens them, he is back at the abandoned bathroom at Hogwarts.
when perspiration covers his entire body, wrapping around him like a blanket.
Harry lets out a sardonic chuckle. “Me too,” he says, reminded of the many times he’s listened to Hermione’s lectures on the corruption in the Ministry.
An idea sparks deep inside within Harry — he can kill this Skar impersonator, right? It shouldn’t be too hard. Just one dark curse when Malfoy catches them and they’re gone for good. Harry can
“Good?” Draco asks, a worried expression still plastered onto his face as he squeezes Harry’s shoulder gently. “I’m going to get a glass of water and a vial of calming draught, alright? Stay here.”
Malfoy’s wand.”
Draco pauses, hand gripping his wand tighter than ever as his mind supplies him with memories of that year. No matter how many Dreamless Sleep potions he brews and consumes, it’s impossible for him to forget the haunting cries of agony that came from every corner of the Manor.
because he gets to benefit from the measurable end of Malfoy’s wrath.
“Why do you always kiss my scar?” Harry asks as he presses his naked body closer to Draco. “Not complaining, just curious.”
I wrote this at church it’s fine everything is fine
“Draco-“
carved into his skin by an insane Death Eater, so he’s certain he’s fine.
Before Harry could even gather his thoughts for a reply, Draco is out of his sight, like a flicker of thought in mind, leaving him in the doorway of the bathroom.

“Allow me to introduce you,” North says. “

“Tell me more,” Draco says into the crook of Harry’s neck. “I do love it when you praise me.”

When Harry closes his eyes, the image of Malfoy letting Harry eat his own come off of his Mark haunts Harry, and Harry’s certain the taste of
“Well, you always kiss mine,” Draco says shyly, failing to meet Harry’s eyes. “And I like that it’s a part of you. It doesn’t make you who you are, the Saviour or some bullshit.”
If Harry were being honest, he doesn’t really know what Malfoy means when he says he wants to be ‘good’. Perhaps it’s the disconnection Harry feels from human morality — he doesn’t really understand the appeal of kindness. Harry used to know kindness and empathy like the back of his hand, practiced it like he had nothing to lose.
From a distance, another familiar man approaches the gates of the Manor, his hair whipping around along with the harsh bite of the wind. North’s father and his two children wait by the front doors to welcome their guests.
“So am I,” Harry echoes. “You don’t need the money, do you? So why do you still keep doing
Malfoy turns toward Harry and with him comes the rest of the world, shrunk to the size of his lovely face.
Harry crosses the room to stand beside Malfoy and scoffs at the state of the corpse. An uneven slit to the throat, really? It’s such an embarrassment that he’s being credited for this.
“Shut the fuck up,” Harry curses, casting a hex at North.

“Such a pity,” Harry echoes, smiling tightly at the man.
The liquid tastes of somewhat bitter vanilla against Harry’s tongue, but it works immediately as he feels his muscles relax and his mind has stopped reeling images of the bloody bathroom.
carved in her arm.”
“Why are you here?” Draco says through gritted teeth, the warmth of his own magic tingling under his skin.
Talking to mother had helped Draco remember exactly why he was in Brazil and who he was.
Meaning in Portuguese, the act of caressing or tenderly running fingers through a loved one’s hair.
Harry rested his head on Draco’s stomach as the echo of their moans faded behind the low rippling of the water. The only audible sound was their heavy breathing, the soft curl of the waves on the surface, the rustle of the canopy. Even the animals had gone quiet for them.
The light turned to shadows around him.
“Christ, Draco, where were you?!” Potter asked, voice strained with concern, kneeling in front of Draco. His face was red where it was not covered in soot, hands full of scratches and recent burns, his clothes charred from the fire.
“It’s far-fetched, really, to believe Caipora will just fall at your charms, but—” She raised her index finger. “It might actually work. Think about it, they are certainly not expecting you’ll confront them. And certainly not with the help of one of ours.”
about you. I
“It’s…” he started, but soon found he had no words for it, and the ones he had didn’t seem to be enough.
What would hurt even more would be to stand by Potter’s side, pretending he felt nothing.
He had changed his mind at the end of the war, true. But it hadn’t been out of the goodness of his heart. He pretended not to recognise Potter because he couldn’t stand watching him die—he never could—and because he was afraid. Draco was young, and he was terrified, and his survival instincts spoke for him. What could say if he would make the right choice if his survival wasn’t at stake?
It’d been seven years. A lot had changed. Draco no longer knew the reasoning behind Harry's actions, no longer had the right to analyse what he did.
If Draco was staring at Potter’s abdomen while his focus was on the snake it was only because Draco was entitled to some pay off after that kind of traumatising experience. He wouldn’t be able to lie about the attractiveness of Potter’s body—he wasn’t blind—and the aesthetic those tanned muscles and colourful tattoos created was something enthralling.
dwell on feelings. If anything, he avoided them. Draco Malfoy would never let his heart get the best out of him—not again. There were too many pitfalls in having to depend so much on a single organ to keep him going.
. His mind-healer’s words didn’t help. As he’d told her many times: how could a person like him even have a happy place?
well. So well that he cringed when comprehension dawned on him, trying to obliterate the last remnants of his patience.
Draco didn’t really regret leaving home, and his fiancé, and the life he knew, but this was
Tainara respectfully declined accompanying him, on some excuse about not getting along with those creatures, even though she had seemed excited about Draco’s meeting with the Rudá figure. He hadn’t dared to spill his plan to anyone else, as they’d probably try to dissuade him.
“I’m not.”
But why did it hurt when Harry’s tepid hands were not touching him anymore?
. Draco loved
Two things were becoming increasingly clear to Draco during that conversation: Rudá was probably one of the creatures Francisca and Tainara talked about constantly; and Draco was going to be insane when he finally went back to London.
Potter again.
Headteacher Berenice said, “I will not waste my time stating how much regret I feel about having let you stay when I knew better than not to trust Homunin’s judgment.” Berenice’s words were enunciated slowly and menacingly. Her charming features had turned to something cruel, cold.
Draco hummed. When she didn’t offer any clarification about the words, he tried memorising them to ask Harry to translate later. “I noticed,” he muttered under his breath.
Harry’s hesitation was answer enough.
“Hopefully, they’ll see you’re a good person.”
Harry called, “Draco, wait.”
Draco stopped, raising an eyebrow at Potter’s unashamed chuckle. His glare seemed to silence Potter, though his grin was still too amused for Draco’s taste. “Sorry. Sometimes I forget that you and Neville are friends now.”
Draco reached for the book, but before his fingers grazed the paper, it closed with a heavy thud. Potter muttered something about the breeze and opened it again for him to read. Draco leaned in, all but willing to, but just as his eyes caught the first words, the book closed again on his nose. He huffed, this time trying to open it by himself. However, the moment his fingers came in contact with the material, a jolt ran down his skin.
don’t know what a Saci is.”
Harry whispered, “I want you.” He didn’t say
Harry chuckled, lying down on the hammock and signaling Draco to join him. They laid side by side, pressed against each other on the rug, legs tangled in a mass of limbs, as the breeze of the night kept their bodies fresh.
Harry belonged to this place. His body seemed to work as one with the woods. It was as beautiful to watch as it made Draco’s heart clench. Harry belonged there, more than he belonged with Draco. He couldn’t begin to hope to take him from that place. Not that he wanted to.
The Headteacher, the staff of Homunin and the creatures of the forest had devised a way to loosen the strands that held the school together after what had happened to Draco and Tainara.
. He couldn’t even tell how long he had been running. It felt like hours, days. It felt like he had been running for his entire life.
Draco suddenly wanted to know who had sealed the seed. How they had both forest and outside magic, but he didn’t ask. Not now. Once the night was free and everything went back to normal, he would fix the rest of it and if they felt like it, the women would let him know. Draco was in no position to demand anything from them.
The library’s walls extended around him, packed with books, parchments, and scrolls in wooden shelves that reached the ceiling, precariously anchored to them. The constant niggling doubt in Draco’s stomach never left him, though, that Castelobruxo’s treasures remained hidden from him.
“Wait… Does this mean…?” Draco started, but unable to finish, he let Francisca add the words he dreaded to say, “You’re Rudá’s child.”
She didn’t seem to notice his sarcasm and instead pointed excitedly at a page that, much like the others, Draco couldn’t understand.
? Then…” Her voice was now barely a whisper. The bad feeling Draco had about the whole thing since the damn flame didn’t enter him now intensified. She seemed to sense it in his face because Tainara added, “It’s no big deal, right?” She waved a hand like it was really nothing major or catastrophic. This was how Draco was painting it in his head now. “I’m not on the net either.” Tainara rolled her eyes, shrugging. “Everyone here is
He raked a hand through his hair, a slow movement, so as not to alert Caipora of a threat. And then the small wooden object knocked against his forehead. That’s right. He was still holding the pipe. Draco glanced at Caipora, satisfied to notice the device had caught her attention too.
these days, and he had hoped Potter had grown out of it with time, as well.
—draw his wand and jeopardise everything he had worked for during the last few weeks.
about to deal with
Not that Draco didn’t think he wasn’t worthy of their admiration—honestly, he had harmonic features and an amazing body—but he couldn’t see what was so interesting about his own figure to grant him so many wide eyes.
Draco knew, then, why Potter didn’t live with the others. It explained a lot, if his nightmares were trying to kill people. It reminded him of after the war, of holding Harry down, shushing in his ears that it was all a bad dream, that nothing was going to harm him anymore. Draco barely dreamed about the Dark—of
He wondered, for a second, if they were there just for decoration. However, some of the fabric was bundled down with the weight of a body on top of it.
stupid. I am sorry, you know.”
Draco never landed, though, as something hit his chest before his feet even reached the ground. Draco’s broom spiralled out of control. But when he fell, his body rolling on the grass, he belatedly noticed it was a soft landing. Potter must have cast a Cushioning Charm seconds before the impact.
“Hey, Lua.” Potter approached her slowly, his smile wavering. She definitely gave the impression of someone to be feared, but Draco didn’t think he’d ever seen Potter waver in front of anyone. “I knew we could find you here. This is Dr—”
He had so much darkness in him.
“Okay, really now, what are you doing?”
It was better this way—to keep his distance from Potter. It was just one more thing he’d have to convince himself of.
went unspoken. He let her go.
“He does love you! I think you should name him already.” The girl giggled.
And then he pressed on, because he
Draco frowned and contained the impulse of looking back at the building he had just come from. There was no way that, given the option, he would choose not to be there. Not to access the knowledge that the school held. “
. His eyes went to the bird on his shoulder. “Machado was with me, and we… We bonded. And there was magic and—”
Potter chuckled. “Tai is amazing. If she would just enroll, she’d have so many resources and help.”
Not without first instructing Machado to track Lua inside the forest, obviously.
“This is for you,” Rudá offered, stretching his hand to Draco. “I think you’ll find this one quite helpful.”
—its ancestral indigenous house. Each trunk represents a soul. They paint the wood of each soul with drawings that remind them of those that are gone. Women come with food and sweets, and they dance and sing to invoke the spirits of the dead again.”
. That he was good. As good as someone considering slamming the Golden Boy’s head against the wall could be (that had to be a justified exception).
Draco wasn’t sure whether the shadows were too busy scaring other people or his own nightmares hadn’t become real yet, but he just ran without looking back, crossing the field of the Living Section faster than he thought possible.
Draco had wondered before where Potter got his food—maybe he planted it himself, or had learned how to hunt animals, and the image had its appeal. But as it happened, Potter went into the village twice a month (thrice, now that Draco was there), bought supplies and came back. It was all terribly anticlimactic.
The barn where Draco had first met the professor came into view again, along the green horizon stretching lazily in the landscape. Chica guided their stroll past the structure and into the forest, stopping only when a distinguished line of thick trees separated it from the grass.
, Harry had said—and murmured, “I’m sorry for this.” But he wasn’t, really, because
The sodding git had disappeared from Draco’s life, and wizarding London, years ago. And Draco had made the best effort not to track him down. He didn’t care where Harry was or what he was doing, or the fact that
Saci snorted, his hand still on Draco’s shoulder. “I warned.”
“Yeah, already finished.”
What did it mean that this power had chosen Harry? What would it do to him?
Tainara was already laughing, almost seconds before the damn stalker-parrot reached Draco’s chest, landing as inelegantly as a drunken pilot. He could swear sometimes that bird had no sense of balance—or timing.
Saci stopped.
Harry would vouch for him.
Saci shrugged. “That was before—”
Potter was smirking all the way back, and he didn’t hide the reason for his amusement: he doubted Draco would wear those outfits.
“Don’t say you’re sorry.”
Lua completed, “with outside magic.”
“Something dark, thick. Tasted like earth. Am I dying?”
Draco hummed noncommittally. “That can be helpful.”
But his mind took him somewhere he would very much rather be at that moment.
He knew he had, but had it felt so bad at the time? Maybe he had got used to a simpler life. It had been so easy to get comfortable by Harry’s side when Harry smiled at him like Draco was his whole world.
It was all Draco could see.
“It better bloody not,” Draco replied, closing his eyes to the sudden brightness.
Well, wasn’t that funny? “Aren’t you all? That’s what I've heard. Anyway, what should I do with it?”
Draco opened his eyes, but there was nothing but darkness around him. He tried to move, scream,
The low rustle of papers broke their awkward silence, as Nanda busied herself with organising some pamphlets Draco was sure were not there before.
Draco recoiled, face creasing in a grimace. “I have given up.”
Draco looked around, but Harry was nowhere to be seen yet, even if his voice was growing louder, closer. He turned to Saci immediately. “Get out of here,” he told the boy. And added, grimacing and hiding the hat in his enlarged pocket “Oh, and please, don’t tell anyone I have your hat.”
José raised an eyebrow at him. “He’s intense, but he’s nice and he seems to really like you. I’m guessing he messed up.” He shrugged, an infinitesimal movement that shifted only his shoulders, arms still locked on the steering wheel, and Draco found being his passenger made uneasiness grow inside him.
Draco pushed him lightly, sighing and taking a step back. Silence reigned in the room for a beat. Draco didn’t trust his own voice to speak. Not yet.
Harry stroked his hair so tenderly it felt like the wind was blowing his strands and not his calloused fingers. He hummed in acknowledgment, pressing his lips to Draco’s temple. “You can’t really see the stars in London like this. Do you want to know why there are so many stars in the sky?”
“Does that mean I get the job?”
Unexpectedly, they gave him a private area in the left wing.
“You did sleep with some of them,” Nott murmured, putting his hand on his shoulder. He let a finger trail over the abused areas, stroking it with wonder.
“Yes?”
Harry nods, and bows lightly. “Sir.”
He clicks his tongue. “Fuck it.”
A flash crossed his eyes, and disappeared quickly. Harry suddenly wonders if Lucius misses his wife.
She lands her hand on his shoulder and leans toward him, nails digging through his skin.
It was strange, really, that Draco knew all the relief of his skin, all the outline of his shape; that he knew where to press to make him squirm, where to kiss to make him cum. That he knew his body like his own—but that he wasn’t able to say what food he like the most.
Men were so easy.
Draco instantly dislikes her.
“Oh my
“You wish.”
And above all, out of his reach.
Maybe it was the atmosphere – always calculate, always careful – that set his alarm bells ringing. Maybe it was this nagging feeling inside him, always wary. Either way, he noticed the stare of the elves; the way they glance at him when they think he wasn’t looking. The way they seemed to be popping out of nowhere. Their state of wariness. If he didn’t know better, he would think himself paranoid. But he could tell, even without concrete proofs. Talk about experience, or even intuition. His guts never lied to him.
But Harry wasn’t stupid.
“Mr. Potter.”
Harry tilted his head a little, looking at the small shape in front of him. He didn’t really have a chance to talk to the boy since their first encounter. From what he could see back then, it seems that father and son have some complicated relationship.
Draco took Potter example; they both order a steak and eat in silence. For his part, the blond was very hungry, having skipped breakfast over his date. He was eating with enthusiasm, maybe a little less mannered than a Malfoy should, but the food was really good and he was a teenager. Who can blame him?
Taking his bag, he nudges at Pansy. She groans but lifts her head and blinks at him.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said nonchalantly, and it wasn’t even a lie. She wasn’t familiar to him.
“Fine” he huffs and rolled his eyes. “You’re not funny.”
She walks away, and Harry shakes his head.
Rubbing his hair, he processed to tidy up his clothes. Most of it were muggles—most of the peoples were wearing muggle clothes these days, as they were more comfortable—but in case, he bought along some robes among the few he had. Lucius seemed to be the traditional type, and Harry wasn’t sure how long this case will be.
that fuck everything, but what he was
Ron shrugs and pats his pockets thoughtfully. “Don’t know, mate. Apparently, he’s rather annoying to deal with—do you have a cigarette?”
“Do you really think that’s what he would have wanted?”
And maybe that’s why Draco always crawled back to him. Maybe that’s what attracted him in the first place. Whenever he felt himself slipping away, Theo was there to remind him of the real word. He was the place where he returns when he didn’t have anywhere else to go.
He swallows, both nervous and incredibly turn on.
” he huffed, annoyed,
(See the end of the chapter for
Pansy was still bemused as she enters the car. Draco follows just after her, still flustered by this side of him. It wasn't like it last very long - the time of the blink of an eye, really - but his inside were burning with curiosity.
curious.
Not even finishing half of his plate, the man stops eating. He let go his fork and cleans his mouth before calling the waitress.
– never missing a beat.
His breath against his ear.
They made their way out of the room, and then along the empty corridors. Harry could help but touch him—his hip, his back, his arse. Miraculously, they made it inside the Griffondor tour, and when they were inside his dorm, he slams the blond against the door and kisses him hard.
She winks, and opens hers.
It was nice to be able to relax this way. Even if they did know each other since they were practically babies, this kind of moment became rare with time. Lady Parkinson didn’t like him very much to begin with, and since he gained his reputation, she was all the more against her daughter spending time with him. He knew Pansy argued a lot with her mother because of that; she may have many flaws, but loyalty was one of her strong points. Draco wouldn’t admit to her, but he was grateful that she was always ready to stand for him, even if it was against her own parents.
“What?” he asked.
Theodore sighs, and he smiles a little. “Do you plan to fuck with him?”
“I’ll take a shower first,” the girl said, running toward the stairs. Draco gaped at her but she was already climbing the staircase, disappearing on the first floor without slowing down.
Somehow, they manage to make it to the first line safely. Draco smooths his skirt and swings his ponytail behind his shoulder.
Draco cleared his throat and Harry looked toward him. The boy seemed uneasy, shifting his legs and playing with his ponytail.

In her defense, she looks horrible, with her eyes rims red and her face as pale as a ghost.

And desperately horny, too.
He shivers, heat and fear coursing into him, and bats his eyelashes when he saw him lowering his head, his mouth grazing his ear with a hot breath.
“What?” he said, a little defensive.
“Yeah, but you
She merely shrugged with one shoulder.
Every fucking time, every goddamn year, something must happen on Halloween. Something
Harry blinks. Straightening up, he cleared his thoughts, and meet the eyes of Parkinson has best as he could. She was clothes like Medusa, all beautiful and seductive—even with her snake-like hair.
“I’m not lusting over Malfoy!”
Without responding, she drags him toward the mob. With her elbows, she created a path – for having already received it, he knows that her blow was rather painful. The victims grunted and cursed at her, but she didn’t even slow down.
The boy looks up, and their eyes meet. Unlike his father, the young eyes were grey, like silver. An odd colour, but who suited him strangely.
Potter turns around to face him, his face stern. There was no way to know what he was thinking—but somehow, Draco feels himself cringe. He frowns, and crossed his arms. He was irritated, because for once, it wasn’t even his fault. She was the one to attack him first. Why would he take the blame?
“What, are you jealous?” came the mocking reply, and Pansy’s frown deepened.
He gulps, and the sound caught his own ears, like a distant sound.
And now, after all this hitting on, he wants a date with him? Does he think Harry could be easily deceived?
And with that, he runs all the way up, disappearing behind the door.
His eyes darkened, and somehow Draco knew he had won. He smirked, and the next thing he knew he was pinned in the mattress, a mouth against his, that was hard and hungry. He moans, and archs his back to get closer to him, to feel him against his skin. There were hands under his shirt, stroking his hips, gripping him firmly on the hips. Heat was boiling inside him—he was becoming hard fast, and by the time the man moves his mouth back, he was panting, flushing and flustered. His gaze was hazy, and through the blur of his brain, he feels teeth graze at his neck, not quite hard but enough to make him shiver. The man was strong like he had imagined, and with one hand he grabs his wrists firmly over his head, the other lifting his leg and pressing his butts with greediness. A whine escapes him, all hot and needy, and he feels himself leaking when the man ground his hips with his, his bulge rubbing his erection through the fabric of his boxer. Distantly, he noticed that he was speaking; his mind was far too cloud to be able to understand what the other was saying.
However, the genuine expression that painted his face couldn’t be faked—or controlled.
For what it worth, this boy had a gift for reviving his bad habits.
Malfoy’s eyes widen, and Harry just wants to kill himself. What did he say that?
A complicated date.
He didn’t know how long he just stood there and stares at him, but when the silence became too much, he clears his throat and crosses his arms.
Fuck.
He knocks, two steady hits. When he received no answers, he turns the door cuff, and push.
“Wake up sleepyhead, it’s time to get the hell out of there.”
Yeah, he thinks. Definitively a bad idea.
are you after?”
“You didn’t ask.”
The blond huffed and crossed his arms. “I mean, a
When he steps out of the shower, Dobby was waiting for him, already bow all the way to the floor.
That it, before Potter open the door, and Draco feel his mind go blank.
He stares at him, and there was desire, and lust, and want.
“Good evening, Mister Harry Potter, Sir” he said, bowing with reverence. “Dobby will be at your service for the length of your stay.”
So easy to just fuck him stupid.
She was just a portrait—just a picture with all the best memories of her inside. She wasn’t real, but Draco felt like she was more genuine than she could have ever been.
He sighs, and opened his eyes slowly, blinking away the fog that cloud his mind. All was quiet again, and his cum was floating on the surface, taunting him.
Malfoy smiles—a little. The way it lifts his lips was distracting. “Your disguise. What are you?”
But, even as his mind reel and the world shatter around him, the peace he seeks never came.
Anthony frowned. “What, he’s your boyfriend or something?”
He leans forward, face stern and dangerous. “
“Yeah” he licks his lip and grab his hand. “Let’s get out of there.”
I just indulging myself at this point.

Pansy raises one eyebrow. “Nothing?”
it. But this day, with his body bent forward and his eyes locked on this blurry man that fucks his mouth like he holds the world, Draco realised what
Feeling alone in the world was more terrifying than death himself.
Such a pretty young and innocent face.
Potter lift one eyebrow and his lips twitch. For a second, something feral mark his face, and Draco feel his inner slut perking. “Want a demonstration?”
“Fuck off Nott,” she spit, before turning to face him instead. “What are you talking to him
“You’re so sensible” he breath, and then lean, and then take it in his mouth. Malfoy’s back arch, his hand in his hair, and Harry sucks and twists his tongue over it and bite.
That kind of thought keeps him up at night. They lingered at the edge of his consciousness and try to escape the walls he keeps up. The boy wasn’t making it easier either, with his
The image was still vivid in his mind. Like a memory that lingered at the edge of his conscious—not quite there but powerful enough to keep him awake at night. He could still feel the sting around his wrist, where he had grabbed him; like a phantom pain, more a feeling than anything, really. It was like every detail had imprinted themselves on his retina, clear as the day, waiting for him: the way his body had moved, too fast for him to understand it. The way he had looked like a shadow, leaning above him.
Opening his door, he enters his room. The light turns on slowly, and let a dim light illuminate the place. With all the delicacy he could gather, he put the boy to bed and leans forward to observe him.
The day passed in a blur. A day like any other day – a Monday that wasn’t all that surprising. Same routine, same faces – a calm and living day at Hogwarts.
It seemed, Draco remarked, that Potter was the kind of guy rather annoying to deal with. Always answering a question by another, never really replying.
“Found it!”
Draco just lie there for several minutes, fixing the ceiling with wide eyes, his heart beating fast.
“You are a potion nerd.”
“Huh?”
Why does it have to be him?
It was never about love between them, despite what Pansy thought. It never will. They weren’t even friends to begin with, despise having known each other for a long time. Their parents were acquittance, way before he was born. Theodore was always around him when he was young; whenever it was at the Yule ball his mother loved to hold, or the strange meetings his dad would keep. He was always there, like him—the only child around all these adults. And even if they didn’t talk—even if they didn’t really know each other, Theodore became somewhat a familiar presence for him, like a comforting string that keeps him ground.
What was his favourite colour? What was he scared of?
They stay there for another three hours.
Pansy freeze, then looks at him with big eyes. Draco didn’t know what was that odd about what he had said, but her look was unnerving.
Did he bare the pain all along, all these years? All alone?
“Harry”
. Like a fucking pattern—as if his life wasn’t already fuck up enough.
, he thought.
The brunette snorted. “Shady? How can you tell?”
Harry turned his head toward him, surprised. “He did?”
Well hello. New chapter - but I'm really tired, and I didn't exactly re-read it. So, surely many faults - but I will edit it better after.
“F-fuck…” he moans, and Harry smile. He adds a second finger, and fuck him with it, making him a mess.
Harry blinks. Suddenly embarrassed—what the fuck did he just do?—he releases him and takes a step back. Malfoy turns around to face him.
Yeah. Not the best way to start a conversation.
Draco smirks, feeling smug, and nudges at her. “Did you thinks I was lying?”
Something forbidden.
“Oh my
That’s why, the next morning after waking up, he had taken his time to get dressed. Among his wardrobe, he had chosen his best short, the one that lifts his ass and shapes his waist tight. He had taken out his favourite crop top, the one that hugs his chest enough to let his piercing show and that tied around his neck, letting a full display of his back and his collarbone. He had even changed his makeup a little bit, opting for a dark kohl to bring out the colour of his eyes, a bright mascara that curled his eyelashes like a fan over his gaze, and a pink lipstick that make his lips shine like a candy. He had even worn his tight socks, and braid his ponytail all the way to his waist.
The thing is, Draco had a thing for this kind of guy. He had dealt with them most of his life, after all. His father wasn’t exactly an example of purity, and as far as he could recall, they were always been there, moving in his house like a rotten bone.
“Whatever do you mean?”
“Bring some tea for our guest” the blond said, his eyes never leaving Harry’s. The elf lifts his eyes slightly, eyeing him from the side. “It’s seemed we’re gonna talk a quite some time.”
, however, just shook his head with his lips twitching.
Thank you for all the support! See you to the next chapter^^
“I’m sorry about last night,” he says slowly, with a voice so genuine he felt impressed. “I just wanted to have fun, that’s all.”
He pushes his finger in, and a sharp gasp break through his part lips. It’s been a while since he had touched himself like that, but with how relax he was, he didn’t even feel a burn. His finger slips through him with ease and he shivers, adding a second one without waiting.
He snorted.
The blond bits his lips, frustrated, but he reluctantly agrees. Harry almost wishes he would make a scene—this way he would have had an excuse to get away.
Closing briefly his eyes, he let himself regain some composure before standing up. What a life, really.
Harry frowned and checks his watches, wondering if all this thing was
“Pansy, you’re rumbling.” Draco cuts her off, even if he did want to know.
Breathing in, he lifts his chin. Now was not the time to be distracted.
“We need to talk.”
, he thought in a crazy daze.
“I still can believe he didn’t kill you,” Ron said rather flippantly, letting himself drop in the chair in front of him. He was holding a cup, and was waving a folder on the other hand like a fan.
“What do you mean?” asks Potter, almost startling him, with an unreadable voice.
“Zabini, Ron ? Really?” he asks in shock. Okay, he was good-looking, and
“How are you doing?”
The silence was diving his mind in a lazy circle, wandering around but not quite lingering enough. Inevitably, he ends up thinking about Potter. At some point, he recalls seeing him in his room, the night before. He didn’t really remember what happened after that, but a least he was sure of it. What was he doing here anyway? Draco hoped he didn’t make a fool of himself
The doorbell rings below, and the strained was cut. She straightens up before turning on her heels, her shoes flapping loudly against the floor.
Draco shrugged. Of course, it was kind of endearing, all this frenzy about him. The news was still fresh, and he couldn’t wait to see his schoolmates; they’ll sure all be crazy about it. But, well, they’ll calm down eventually. Maybe a week before it became old news.
She vanished.
“She fucking slaps me!” he yells, furious. “This bitch fucking slaps me!”
“Harry, I’m serious. You need to stop doing this shit. It’s not helping anyone.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“G-god, Harry fuck!” his pupils were so bright and vivid.
He perks up at that, startled, and his felt his checks becoming even redder. There was a pleasant feeling that washes over him – not quite familiar but definitely not unpleasant.
“Fuck yeah” he leans again and kiss under his jaw, then his throat, and then he sucks hard. Malfoy tilts his head for more room, and Harry marks him with pleasure, smirking when he squirms under him.
This wasn’t even a lie.
Draco tilts his head. Well, it wasn’t the first time that this kind of thing happened. Generally, the concerned person settled for a more discreet confrontation, to avoid a scandal. It was the first time someone confronts him this frontally, and in other circumstances, he would be impressed.
“Whatever for?”
anyway? Like, under his skirt. He wasn’t an expert, but he doubts that a boxer was appropriate with these kinds of clothes. The skirt was already too short anyway, and he didn’t see any short under.
us as homework?” Pansy said, waving her hand. “I stay up late last night just to end this bloody essay. I almost miss Neville’s training!”
Well. Maybe it was time to get laid.
See you around!
“What does he look like? I mean, not physically but, you know….” She changed the subject and gave him a lopsided smile.
Pansy made a noise of amazement, something like
The first door led to a lounge, a place much cosier and less
“I do not!”
“Did you ever doubt it, Mr. Potter?”
Draco felt suddenly sad.
Potter was definitely amused. Draco was sure he was going to die right here of embarrassment.
There was a pop somewhere. Dipsy appear with a bow, before staring at him.
They kind of talk. He knew they did, but he didn’t really pay attention to any of it, because suddenly all his attention was focused on how handsome the man looks, and how he was hovering above him with his lips moving slowly. His stare lingered, and he feels his skin heat a little, because being this sexy shouldn’t be legal.
Potter lifts his head and raises an eyebrow. His expression suggest was he was thinking, and the blond feel oddly offended.
It was frustrating. Unnerving. Perturbing. Destabilizing.
Pansy laughed. “Good luck with that, all he can think of is how to get in Wood's pants.”
Harry hates Halloween because it was
Potter hums thoughtfully before checking his watch. “I guess it couldn’t hurt to stop by,” he mumbles vaguely.
” he breathes, finger playing with his rim. The vision was so vivid in his mind that he could actually feel him here with him, looking at him with a smirk playing on his face. “Fuck, yes.”
“Yeah” she turned her head toward her own room before sighing. “I got to go. See you at school.”
“I’ll take a shower.”
, Harry thought, but he keeps his mouth shut.
Before coming here, Draco had thought about what he could say. This week has been torturous and, after a night whining at his mother, he came up with a conclusion.
“Your point?” the man said without even looking at him.
“It’s that what you wanted?” He asks between his breath. “Driving me crazy so I can fuck you mad?”
Draco wrinkled his nose. “Ew, no.” He bent a bit and took his wand, waving it on his shirt. It smoothed out a bit, the folds disappearing. “What did you take me for?”
And it wasn’t his fucking business either.
The man titled his head, and some of his curly locks waved a little. “Why do you ask?”
want to feel his magic.
Lucius was watching him,
“F-fuck” Draco breaths, his muscles twitching ever slightly. “I think I got numb.”
“Can I at least take a shower?” he asked with annoyance, and the boy gives him a bright smile like he had won a lottery.
“Nothing,” she grins, before taking a bite on her food.
Draco eyes moved forward, and he lands on his now hew bodyguard, leaning against his dad’s car, the same leather jacket on his shoulder. He was smoking – slow, deliberate puffs – and didn’t seem to have noticed the stare he was receving. Or maybe he did, but just ignores it.
“Fuck! Oh god oh god
Never less, this case was different. Harry Potter wasn’t anybody to begin with, and he didn’t look like the type of person that could fall easily for him. Hell, he didn’t even look like someone who can fall in love to begin with—he was too close off, to restrain for that. And there was something about him that was troubling him—something that he couldn’t really grab, but that attract him non-less.
Harry blinks, and restrain himself from frowning. “Good, Sir. And you?”
With his hand on his waist, Harry helps him lift his hip. Draco takes his prick on his hand, his long fingers wrapping around him. Harry just toss the sting aside.
He breathes in deeply. Much calmer now, he brings his locks out of his face and move toward his lodging. The house was quiet, like usual, but inside him, there was something unsettling that seemed to rake at his bones, a deep mixture of roiling emotions. His mind was quiet, but it was like he couldn’t identify what he was feeling.
“Don’t you have other things to try?” He pointed out with a look toward the huge heap of clothes.
“Don’t smoke inside, you’re gonna ruin the material,” Kelly-Ann reprimanded with her usual dry voice.
The boy crawled toward him, and Harry noticed that he wasn’t wearing anything besides an oversize shirt, like his friend. He didn’t know why he bugs at it, but he did; it was a sign, really, seeing him on all fours in front of him with nothing but a long shirt and his messy hair. His lips were shining and his cheeks were slightly pink. Harry could see his legs as he moves, noting how firm they seem despite his soft skin.
Malfoy bits his lip and nod.
“What—?”
Draco blinks, his heart squeezing, and he feels single a tear running down his eyes. Potter just wipe it away.
Harry realises, frowning deeply
Draco just rolled his eyes. “It’s just been one day. I have all the time in the world.”
“I swear Mcgonagall is trying to kill us. Did you see what she
Lucius Malfoy was standing at the doorstep, his tall frame cool and noble as he eyed him carefully, his hand landing on a cane with a silver snake’s head at the end. Like the picture, the man was charismatic; all high chin and straight posture; eyes cold and face still like a frame. His blond hair, almost white it seemed, were gathered in a ponytail at the base of his neck. His long, dark robe was cut to measure, marrying his imposing figure and highlighting his beauty.
Potter smirked. “I’m joking.” Letting go of his hand, he opens the passenger door.
Draco took his hand slowly, wrapping his fingers around his own. His movements were reserved, more calculating than shy.
Harry shrugged lightly, “I’m sure it’s just a way to keep me under his watch.” He looked at his own cup, now cold on the table. “Malfoy is a paranoid bastard. He won’t trust me so easily.” Letting his thoughts wandered a bit, he shook his head and waved his hand.
Sitting in one of the chairs in the room, he was waiting for the boy to finish dressing up. Where he was, he could hear the rubbing of the clothes and the shuffling around the cabin. He knew he was going to sit here for
Yup, I'm still there. Sometimes I have this big urges to write, and others time....
He disengaged himself, and the blond look almost hurt by it.
“Of course,” Dobby said, bowing again. “Please, let Dobby know if Mister need anything.”
For the first time, he saw the man opened his eyes wide, clearly taken aback. It was strangely satisfaying to see.
are you here?” he asks, again, with more emphasis than before.
“I can’t believe this,” he scoffs before running a hand in his hair. “I’m done. This is fucking ridiculous.”
“Is that so?”
Potter blinks slowly. “…Pardon?”
“What?”
(For someone with a pale complexion, the boy was bruising quite easily. Even days after the act, his wrist had been red from his grip and just seen it had driven him
“You think I’m evil, too? You think —” he hiccups, “even after staying with me you still think I’m that despicable?”
Lucius seemed to relax at that, tilting his head.
The hot water seemed like heaven. Slowly, he let his body immerse in the warm, feeling himself relaxing instantly. His hair fell out around the water and he sinks in deeper, letting his nape fall on the edge. The little waves were slightly blue, and a scent of vanilla was embalming the room, calming his nerves and smoothing the knock inside him.
It was subtle, but Draco could feel the tension between them. It was like the man had become again the one he had met the first time. All his walls were up again, and it was like the intimacy between them had never existed to begin with.
Draco didn’t know how to feel about it.
It’s wasn’t a good sign.
“Be my guess.”
He wonders if Nott knew what he likes.
“Gross.”
Did he imagine it? The way his eyes are trailed over his lips—did he imagine it?
If he was honest, Harry would have told him what a slut he was. And for a moment, he nearly said it—it was kind of distracting, all this skin—but managed to catch himself before doing something they will both regret.
He grunts. “Nothing.”
If Draco was honest, he would say that Pansy did look happy. She hadn’t been this happy in such a long time. Leaning against him, she was grinning like an idiot – but well, it was a good look on her. And Longbottom wasn’t that
“I remember you, on top of me,” he said slowly, pushing himself off the table. Potter’s eyes didn’t leave him, and this gave him a boost of confidence as he leisurely moves toward him until he was practically standing on his side. His journal, still open, was handing on his open legs, now forgotten. Draco slid on the table, just before him, and make sure to let his shirt lift enough for him to see his thighs.
Pansy smiles and leans over his ear. “Well, it seemed like you have a chance after all.”
. Hell, he was even ready for gold and diamond. But, apart from the gate, everything else seemed almost … normal. Normal in a wealthy way, at least. Slowly, he made his way to the window, which allows the natural glow to fill in and lit the space, making everything more welcoming.
, this part of the floor was carefully neutral. The parquet was dark and plane, matching the grey set of couches facing the fireplace. A bookshelf was taking the wall, with different kinds of books, all lined up meticulously. A dinner table and four seats facing a space door along the right wall, overlooking the back of the house; he was able to see a pool far in the garden, and he snorted at that. He couldn’t really picture Lucius taking sunbath with his wife swimming in a bikini.
Harry saw him the moment he enters the place—Malfoy was unmissable, really, with his flashy hair and his bloody
The man tilts his head in response. The air between them was clearly tense, and even when she turns around to smile at him, he could see that it was still a little edgy.
But—Potter, the absolute
Now, he was in his room, bored as fuck. When Potter had dropped him off, he had run here, and hadn’t been outside since then. He didn’t even know how long he had been lying down here, staring at his ceiling. The night was already falling outside the window.
The blond rolled his eyes and look around him. They were in a little alley that was so hidden that it could easily be missed. It was much darker here, and behind him was a dead end. The only exit was ahead, where he could see people walking quickly back and forth.
“Alright, what the hell were you thinking?” He asked, and turns to look at the girl. “And where the hell did you found this?”
Draco blinks slowly, before craning his neck to meet his eyes. The man seemed curiously annoyed, for once. The blond didn’t know what to think about it, but something was better than nothing, right?
“You want to grab something first?” he asked, because even he wasn’t that selfish. It was already kind of bad that he had waking him up this early.
He was crazy.
Harry mostly praised himself for his self-control. That was a part of why he was good at this kind of job. Faking emotions, being always wary,
to drive him crazy—and for a second, he forgets how to breathe.
He put his thumb on his right cheek lightly, where the girl had hit him. Instantly, he feels his skin sparkling, and the sting disappear like he had never existed.
“Shut up,” she mumbled, and pressed her face against one of the many pillows on the bed. “My head is about to explode.”
The brunette tilts his head. “Hotter than me?”
For them he’d always be the son of Malfoy.
“You’re lying!” she screams again, and God her voice was so annoying. “How could you! You knew he was with me, how could you!”
“You look like shit,” he told her, just because he could.
Potter glances at him. “Yeah, I agree.” He looks at the road again. “It
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dobby will escort you in the waiting room, Sir.”
Ron smiles. “Why, you’re not the only one allows to lust over a Slytherin.”
The night ago was a blur in his head, like some distant souvenirs that he couldn’t completely grab. All was vague, and there was a black hole over the night that didn’t sit right with him.
He had been kicked out for three days.
He checked himself one last time, shoving his piercing through his teeth. He was fine, he decided, nodding for himself. Maybe not perfect, but fine enough.
Drugs.
“A steak, maybe. With a coffee.”
Potter silently complies. It was like everything was in slow motion, and somehow that make all of this more vulgar than it probably was. Potter hands touch his exposed back, just a little touch, barely even there. His fingers move down slowly, letting a burning path behind them. He bits his lips and looks at his reflection again. Potter seemed captivated, and Draco should have felt mighty about it, but the only thing he was sensing now was the flutters of his lower abdomen. It was dumb, really, Potter wasn’t even really touching him, but he was already out of breath.
“I’m close,” he says as he arches desperately. “Potter I―”
But, now wasn’t really the moment.
Before she could ask more questions, Binns enters the class. Pansy just glance at him, clearly letting him know that it wasn’t the end, and turned toward the ghost who was speaking with his monotone voice.
“The fuck is wrong with you?”
“I have everything under control.”
“Don’t overstate it.” He flopped on in stomach and crossed his arms. “I didn’t get the chance with Flint yet.”
Ron laughs. Tipping his glass, Harry crosse his ankles and lean himself against the wall. Seamus joined along the way, and they fall into a pleasant talk.
They enter a study, the man closing the door as soon as they enter the place. Unlike the other parts, this room was
Draco could barely wait.
Potter kneels in front of him. He didn’t touch him, and Draco could only make out his legs.
“What are you?”
He gulps. Malfoy was looking at him under his eyelashes, the perfect sign, and Harry moves further, kissing the rim, just little pick of his lips.
But Potter seemed to know her if his look was any indication.
So, this guy was Draco Malfoy, huh. For some reason, he thought he would be different. Lordlier, perhaps, like his father. He was taken aback by how he looks like a normal teenager. A rebellious one, it seemed. Malfoy being what he was, it was surprising.
“Fuck yeah, come for me.”
He hadn’t really known his mom. His memories of her were too vague, surely due to his young age when she had died. Most of the things he knew about her came from what others at told him. His uncles, his dad’s friends – nothing too much, just little remarks here and there that he collects like some jewellery. In his head, he had shaped his own version of her – a version lulled by illusions and repressed desires.
Potter chuckles. It was a low sound, something that came from his chest, deep and raw. A nice sound, Draco decides.
Hermione rolls her eyes, visibly annoyed. She was wearing a wonder woman disguise, that seem to appropriate not to be cliché. At least, she was beautiful in it, so that wasn’t that bad.
She put her arm around his shoulder and drag him in the aisles. It was like she was trying to distance him from Potter in a way. “So, tell me. How can I help you today?”
“You’re not eating?” he asked when he saw that the man wasn’t really planning on resuming his food.
“I don’t hate you,” Potter repeated slowly, and the blond feel like he was trying to convince himself. “I don’t hate you, Draco.”
“Why me? Don’t you have a boyfriend or something?” Well, Harry had
? Nott is an
“Wait!” Draco glare at him, and Theodore sighed with resignation. “Alright, alright – I’m joking. Jeez, what get your knickers in a twist?”
And when Potter tensed, he knew that his wonderful date was ruined.
But that was over the limit.
Harry blinked, and rather unexpectedly, he felt a laugh coming up his throat. He
“If you know this, then why don’t you do it then?” he murmured with heat. “Why don’t you fuck me and make me shut up?”
Until Malfoy come.
Draco rolled his eyes again – with Pansy, it was kind of a habitude at this point – but didn’t respond. Maybe she was right, but that didn’t mean he was about to admit it. Her ego was already too big – no need to make it swell further.
He whimpers, and his hand pick up the pace, his breathing becoming erratic. He imagines Potter being there with him; entering the shower and pressing his hard frame press behind him. The water would stick his clothes, letting a full display on his body. Draco would feel his muscles press on his back, and would feel his big hand slowly circling his hips, caress his skin as he frays a path toward his hard dick, a smirk playing on his face.
—that he was sure that if he bends down, just a little, he will have a good view on his perfect arse –
“Shall we?”
Instinctively, he knew where this was going. “Shut it,” he hissed, but she just shakes her heard.
, something different than before.
Potter shakes his head. Draco shrugged, because even if he seemed defeated, the man was smiling a little. It was strange to see him smile like this—without all the slyness of his smirk. It wasn’t something big, just a little curved of his lips, but somehow, it appeased all the lines of his face. It was a shame, really, that he didn’t smile more.
“Jesus, Pansy.” He broke away from her and straighten his shirt. “What if I had
All this purity was making him want to taint him.
“You’re a Slytherin, right? I know you could have made her pay without being caught.”
Draco frowns. “It’s midday.”
Jolt of pleasure ran in his veins. He arches and moan without being able to help himself, throwing his head back. His movements were a little aguish, and a fog of lust crash on him, making him tremble. He slides his free hand toward his nipples, pinching the right one between his fingers, his skin grazing the pierce that was there, making his toes curl. He was so sensitive there, even more now that he had them pierced (he had them just before Potter came. His father has been so
“Come on,” he urges when he receives no respond, “I can be good for you.” He smiles a little, touching his face with his fingers. “You won’t regret it.”
When the last drop of cum leave him, he feels his members becoming wobbly, his body weak and his mind bathing in a pleasant buzz.
Potter hums thoughtfully, his eyes never leaving the paper. “Good then,” he said with a final tone, and he empties his cup.
Distracting.
“Draco!” she welcomes him with a hug. Draco let go of Potter and returns the embrace. Kelly-Ann was one of the rare people that weren’t weary of him because of his name, and with how much a loyal customer he was, they rapidly get acquainted. She always said that he was the only one with a minimum of a style in this country—and, in returns, he always said that she was the only good clothing seller in this world. She was a beautiful woman, with honey eyes that represent the gold of his heart, and Draco loves to think that they are friends.
Hermione moves her hand a little, and her magic surrounds them almost immediately.
The library.
“Your hands” he cups his wrist and teases his palm with his middle finger, before letting his hand fall completely on his right leg.
Draco pointed Pansy. “She came with it,” he said with a pout. Like a child, Harry thought. Which he was, all think considering.
“He’s beautiful, isn’t he?” the blond said suddenly. “A really pretty boy. It almost doesn’t seem real. Must have taken it from his mother.”
, blinking his eyelashes and biting his
Did he have someone he like? There was no information about this on the news—nothing that seemed to be even close to that. But, at the same time, the man was secretive about his life—maybe he did have someone but was secretive about it. How, he didn’t know, but with Lucius as a father, this kind of thing wasn’t that surprising.
Draco wasn’t really a big fan of drugs.
, Draco cringes, blushing a little. He glares at him and cleared his throat, taking a step back to gather himself.
“That’s not the fun part, though!” She laughed when he glares at her. “It’s Harry bloody Potter!”
“You will be in charge of my son, as you already know,” he says with reluctance, letting of the curtain. He strode beside him, his free hand cross behind his back. When he looks at him, his eyes were stern and disappointed, much to Harry’s surprise.
look at him. The way he was putting up his glasses, just a little above his nose. His frowns, barely there, when he was reading something unpleasant. He notices that, for the first time since they knew each other’s, he wasn’t wearing his leather jacket. His white shirt was draped perfectly around his broad shoulders, and his arms were bare, letting a full display of his muscles. They were some tattoos on his right arm, a complex combination of runes that course over his dark skin all the way from his wrist to his shoulder, where it disappears on his collarbone. It was strangely beautiful, like an old tribute, and Draco wonders where it ends—resisting the urge to touch it.
There was a heartbeat, and for a moment, Draco thought that he was going to kiss him. There was a tension in there, something that was making his skin tingles. It was happening finally, he thought, and his mind reel at the thought. His heart beat faster, and he feels his blood boiling in his veins.
Draco seemed unfazed, however, rather getting closer. He smells like vanilla, Harry notes distantly.
This chapter is short. I try to add some plot but it didn't really matched so I just drop it for the next chapter. I hope you will like it anyway.
Draco chuckles. “I thought you like Transfiguration.”
How hypocrite.
He stands up quickly. Inside the fireplace, the green flames were dancing wildly.
“Yeah, yeah, whatever” she waves off quickly, entering the classroom. Monday always starts with History of Magic, and even if he was relatively studious, it was one of the classes he just couldn’t stand, just after Care of Magical Creatures.
Draco manages to grab his hand before he could step out.
“Potter” Malfoy says, and he tilts his head backward to meet his eyes. Silver, like hot mercury, resting behind long pales eyelashes. Harry looks down, and his gaze moves toward his pink lips. Yeah, definitely gloss.
With a snap of his fingers, he let all the noise on the street reaches them and walks toward the boy. Draco runs to meet him halfway, looking worried and sulking at the same time.
The blond let ou a surprised laugh, and sniffs pathetically. What was up with him? He thinks, but he was smiling a little. This man was so strange; one second he was cold, the second he was trying to confort him. An overwhelming feeling make his inside flutters, and his ears became hot.
The blond tilts his head back with an innocent smile.
Unconcerned.
“Are you okay?” Harry asks, smoothing his waist. He voice was strained and dark, and the blond bite back a moan.
? A shiver runs through his spine. Lace white panties to match the shirt. Or maybe blue, like the skirt. Or black? Or red?
Harry sighs again – this was becoming a habitude. “Yes, it’s me.”
. He arches and screams and his whole body shook, and somewhere distantly he registers water slashing on the ground.
Malfoy shiver when he felt a cold hand against his rim. “What —?”
Even without looking at her, Draco knew she was frowning. She always wears this kind of expression when she talks to him about it – somewhere between confusion and anger. Since the time it last, he had gotten good at ignoring it. Pansy was a good friend, but she could be such a bitch sometimes.
Theodore makes a startle noise. Draco grips his shirt and practically torn it apart, his hands moving in frenzy. There was an edge of despair on his moves—something urgent, that was rather unusual. He was always the one in control—the one with a sly remark, the one who plays around. Theo was usually the impatient one.
Harry groans, deep in his chest, and Draco began to move. It was slow at first, and with each movement he whimpers, his hands shaking on his shoulder.
She shrugged and he huffed lightly. “Second,” he continues with a glare, “I’m everyone’s type.”
He knows he was pretty – had known it since he was young, really; had hear it so many times that somehow, it wasn’t even a compliment anymore. But this beauty – this harmony, innocent, white,
“You made a bet on my life?” Potter asked, and there was an amused tone behind his voice.
The first time he realises that, he’s only eleven.
“Naughty girl”
Draco nodded while lifting his skirt. It was a little bit short for the school rules, but Draco didn’t really care. The teachers weren’t even scolding at him anymore for it—oddly enough, they all seemed to have lost faith in him.
Basically, just Draco being a teenager.
“So…” he started slowly, letting his pierce graze at his teeth, “what happen last night? I don’t remember falling asleep.”
She humms. “Well, that’s surprising. Either he’s straight, or you aren’t his type.”
Potter wasn’t
, looking at him with a slight concern and shining in the rays of the sunlight.
Don't do drugs, kids (unless you're legal XD)
The first thing that caught him was the smell.
Theodore laughed a little. Moving toward him, he stopped himself a few steps away, close enough that he could feel the heat of his body. Draco lifted his eyes to glare at him, but the brunette wasn’t looking at him. His eyes were wandering over his neck, still red and sensitive.
Just thinking of the way he was using his magic wandlessly was making his dick twitch.
All this shouting was starting to act on him, and he felt himself growing a little more irritated.
Draco rolled his eyes.
It was really disturbing, the boy having that effect on him. He wasn’t even trying—and this was making it so much worse. When he wasn’t paying attention, his mind would go on dark paths, letting him wondering what would he look like with his marks all over him—what sound this sinful mouth could produce for him. And God forbid, when he had seen him cry, he couldn’t help himself; he had thought about bending him over and make him cry even more.
“Why is he wearing a schoolgirl uniform?” Harry asks for the umpteenth time, tapping his foot and scolding his arm. He was irritated, for some reason, and deeply perturbed even if he rather dies than admit it.
Except that, in a way, he had wanted it. He had wanted him dead, deep down. And despite what the others could say, Harry knew; there was something rotten inside of him, something dark and wicked that run through his blood like a curse.
Nott shot an eyebrow, clearly surprise by his dismissive tone. “I wasn’t at school today. Miss me?”
“Harry”
“How was your day?” Lucius asked with surprising courtesy.
He always does.
The contrast was striking. Stepping inside, Harry paced the long alley, his head titled with curiosity. A long hedge was lined up along the path, perfectly cut, leading to the fresh lawn that composed the main garden. In the center, a large sliver fountain; some albino peacocks were roaming the area. Harry looked at them toughly, amazed by their beauty. He had heard about them, of course, but they seemed more beautiful in real life. When they spotted him, they bristled like they were offended, and then dissipated among the hurdles.
“Merlin, he’s even hotter in real life.”
Teens these days are so carefree, it’s almost painful to see.
Whatever that’s mean.
“No thank you. I’ll eat later.”
Even for him, maybe it was a bit too much. He was blushing a little, but hopefully it will help the image he wanted to send back. He cleared his throat and try to appear composed, even if he was feeling a little shy.
The blond sniffs, and turns his head. Potter stares at him before sighing, and somehow the tension between them melts away.
Here he was again, saying stuff like this in his ear like it was nothing. And when they were going to exit this room, he will act like nothing happened, like what he had said hadn’t left a mark on his soul.
Malfoy wasn’t stupid; arrogant, yes, but not naive. Harry may be good at fooling people, but there was no way Lucius could let him wander in his house as he pleases. Either he was confident enough in all his illegal activities, or this was, in fact, a test to get through him. Something planned to get to know whether to trust him or not.
The man didn’t even look up at him. He was sitting in one of the chairs, leaning slightly backward, with a cup of coffee before him. He was reading—Draco caught the journal title, something political, as usual—wearing some glasses that were too round to be fashionable and too old to be his kind. If someone other than him had been wearing that, it would have wrinkled his noise in the lack of style. But strangely, on him, with his wild hair falling on his forehead as he tilts his neck a little to read the lines, it was somehow hot—in a way a phantasm would be.
Suddenly, he craves for a cigarette.
Potter 1, Malfoy 0.
“Fuck!” The blond hand was back inside his hair. Harry was mesmerized by the way his inside pulse against his tongue, and he dives back again, and Malfoy lets a sound of pure bliss pass his lips.
. Like you,” she adds with a smirk.
“You’re really hot.” Draco says with a lazy smile. He extends his body toward him, wrapping his hands around his neck and pulling him back.
“So?” he said nonchalantly, like he didn’t care. He leaned against the door and exhaled, looking out of the corner of his eyes the boy who was staring at him with his mouth open. “Did what you found out live up to your expectations?”
“Well, then.” He moved toward the stairs but pause at the end of it, one hand on the guard rail. Without turning around, he mumbles hastily.
The blond rubs his hand over his face. “I’m fine,” he mumbles out, before sighing and letting his arms fall. “Run me a bath, would you?”
Draco sighs deeply.
Harry raises and eyebrow. “Sorry?”
Potter frowns and sighs—loudly.
“Harry!”
“Then what are you —?”
Sighing, he followed the kids inside. They were chatting happily, like teenagers – and, somehow, Harry realises that they were, in fact, teenagers. Loud and free – something he has never been.
Harry felt all his inside shrinks, all the air inside his chest left him. He moves one, twice, and his world went white, the earth stop, and he shouts his load deep inside the blond until he couldn’t breathe.
Harry tensed a little bit—a tension in his back, something barely noticeable. Slowly, he made his way out the space door, sliding it open. There was a cool breeze outside, not quite cold but not really warm either.
Draco sighs, and looked over the window. It was spring already, and from the top of the tower, the view was enchanting, like a painting.
Harry frowns, and then it hit him.
He nodded. With the flat of his hand, he wiped away his tears and brings his legs up toward his chest.
Theo smelled common, like a comforting habit. Theo smelled peace.
behaviour.
“Potter” Malfoy calls.
It was never good when she started cursing—and Harry cringes a little.
She took out two small transparent vials, grinning. With a swift motion, she climbs beside him, handing him one of the vials.
, he thought with resentment,
The elf appears immediately, bowing down before him. “Mister Draco calls Misty?”
“God, you’re so beautiful like this,” Harry murmurs, playing with his skin.
—this kid was clearly mad, he had dragged with him a long pile of clothes, so high and big that he had completely disappeared behind. And he had insisted on trying every single one—and he was except to go through all along.
“Oh yeah?” Malfoy bits back a moan when he bits his neck. “Then show me.”
How dare he make his dick hard, while paying him not attention at all?
“Leave me alone,” he replied with a broken voice, and fuck if he didn’t hate the way his tone was watery.
“Hmmm….” He opens his eyes, and there was something there, something strong and aching. “Merlin, Harry”
Who was he kidding? A hero like him doesn’t work for a man like Lucius just because he could.
“You fucking slut!” she screams with a harsh voice. “How dare you sleep with my boyfriend!”
“Er…” Seriously, what was he thinking? He rubs the back of his neck. “I don’t know?”
Harry tsked, but comply either way. It was certainly a surprise to saw her again, especially here. They hadn’t spoken to each other since Hogwarts—and even then, they weren’t friends to begin with.
Harry shakes his head. “It’s your body. You’re free to do what you want with it.”
type of clothes especially.
“Really Harry, why not?” she replies, waving a dismissive hand. “It’s not like it was prohibited or something.”
A tense silence follows, only break by the distant sound of clothing being tossed around. Clearly, she was pleased with herself if the way she was looking at him was any indication. It’s been so long since someone had threatened him this openly that for a moment, he felt like laughing.
. But as he sits there and watches the man retrieves the car off the parking lot, Draco though he didn’t really mind after all. There was something utterely sexy with Potter driving a car. Something utterely hot, that make heat boil in him.
“I believe you” he said, almost softly. “I’m not trying to blame you.”
Anthony wasn’t even his type. Not that Harry knows what his type was, but he was certain Anthony
Because either way, maybe he was the enemy, after all.
—despise himself, he was the best at it. Maybe because he was like them.
Draco feels all his muscles twitch as he comes, so hard he feels his eyes rolled back, white stream of cum painting the water. It was like he had been punched in the guts, and for a moment it feels like he couldn’t
“Yeah mate,” Ron adds, chewing whatever was on the table. The pointed canines of his disguise were showing at each movement. “Plus, it looks good on him.”
“FUCK!” Draco
“So?”
, could be read in big, written in letters of blood along the wall of the bank.
Ah. So that was that.
Draco pouts. “The teacher is boring.”
“Good,” she smirks. “See you later then.”
She tilts her head and presses her lips. “Nothing.”
Reviewing Hogwarts was…painful. Not in a way that could make someone cry, but in aching sort of bruise like over his heart, bittersweet and yet longing altogether. How many years, he asked himself. The time had seemed to fly by him before he could remember it. They may have restored it, for him, it was the same old school that took him in when no one had wanted to. The same that held a good part of him trapped, even after all this time.
God knows when he moves. In an instant, he was behind Malfoy, yanking him toward him, far from Anthony’s hand, and the blond jumps a little when his back hit his chest.
He closes his eyes and plunges his head under the water. Did he tell his dad about it? Draco didn’t think his father would let him get away with drugs. Certainly not under his roof—his pride couldn’t let that pass. And even if they didn’t get along, the blond wasn’t really thrilled at the idea of Lucius’s wrath. His dad could really be terrifying—and well, it’s not like he had a plan if he was thrown out, right?
Draco must realise he was here, because he turns his head toward him, his pupils so big they seemed to eat half of his face.
?” he asked, finally looking up, dropping the file in front of him.
And Harry Potter was rubbing him all the right way.
“I knew it!” Pansy yelled and threw him a victorious look. “I told you.” She turned toward him again. “Draco didn’t believe it.”
Draco had found it hypocritical that his dad, with all his traditional rubbish, had bought a car. After all, it was a moldu thing – and de facto,
“I’m sure you are aware of his…
She looks away from him. “Harry,” she said.
“Good.”
“A boyfriend, maybe?” the boy continues, less subtle. There was hunger inside his eyes—but not only. Something more perplexing was making his eyes shine, and Harry frowned, letting go of his hand.
“Of course.”
Draco tilts his head to the side, and breathe through his nose. Whatever, he thought. Sex doesn’t need love. Only power.
But fuck that. He was not in the mood today.
He had thought Potter was different. He didn’t even know why he was this upset. He should have known better.
” she spit with venom. “Ruin your life then. But don’t drag down innocent people with you.”
Harry titled his head. “I’m not judging you.”
The man was the same as he saw him days ago; standing behind his desk, he was looking out the window with a thoughtful expression. Like before, he was wearing a dark robe that praises his frame well, his hair tied back at his neck. His right hand was holding his cane, while the other was carefully crossed at his back. Again, Harry was struck by the sign: if
The blond shrugged, then paused. He was staring at him intensely, like a hawk.
a good idea. It was already ten, and they weren’t even close to finish.
For a moment, the weight against him distracted him. Malfoy was skinnier than him, and his waist was perfect in his hand. Like he should be.
“Pansy I swear to God.”
The coffee came rather faster. They fall into a weird ambiance where Draco was stealing glances at him while eating, and Potter was sipping his coffee like nothing. Surely, he was sensing his gaze on him—but for whatever reasons, he chooses to ignore it.
“Potter” she greeted.
“Ah” Potter says, with an inexpressive tone. “I thought it was the better thing to do at the moment.”
Pansy had rolled her eyes and call him a coward when he told her. Draco hadn’t bother correct her.
schoolgirl.
It seems like Harry didn’t know him like he was thinking.
I’m just putting all the odds at my favour.” He turned around again, facing his mirror self. “He’s really hot. You will understand when you see him tonight.” He gave her a quick glance. “You’re still coming, right?”
He should have never underestimated the boy.
It was an accident, he didn’t do it on purpose—and say like this, everything seemed so much easier.
Did Potter would like that? Would he like watching him rides his fingers and whine for him? Would he yank his hair and call him a good boy?
“Did any of the old guards found anything?” he asked abruptly, changing the subject. Ron just shook his head with frustration.
“Potter” he greets with a little smile, even if he knew his face was probably giving him away.
The man was shirtless. Standing nonchalantly in the doorway, he was only wearing a pair of jogging that hangs loosely on his hips, bare foot and probably just waking up. His hair was messier than usual, and his glasses were hanging carelessly on the tip of his nose. Without being able to stop himself, his eyes trailed over his body, the way his muscles moved when he crossed his arms over his chest—his abs flexing a little. His mouth when dry, when he saw that V line, well defined and disappearing inside his pants—the trail of black hair that was in the middle. He got the urges to get off the waistband to see where he ends—press his mouth just below. His tattoo kept going, he noted, making all his left side up to his waist.
“According to whom?”
“Are you going to tell my dad?”
“You’re a very stubborn man, Mr. Potter,” Lucius says with a sigh, but he wasn’t angry like he thought. Harry blink slowly, casing away the dizziness that had spread through his toughs. The uneasiness was still there though, like a nauseating feeling.
“And I don’t like him,” she added with a pout.
“Seem like a pretty decent job to me, catching the bad guys and all,” he shrugged absently, looking his nails. They were painted black – a new nail polish he applied yesterday. “Plus, you’re a hero. Isn’t that what a hero is supposed to do?”
But Harry wasn’t impulsive like before. He was now an adult, who could rest in control, and this wasn’t fucking Anthony that’s gonna ruin it.
He didn’t look up, and this lack of interest somehow irritate him, making him frowns as he clicks his tongue with annoyance.
It made him dislike her even more.
At least his eyeliner was still flawless, he reflected.
“I’m not
This was heaven. Malfoy’s lips were soft and sweet. He moves carefully, and the blond takes a step toward him, letting their chest collide. Harry puts one hand on his hip, letting himself feel the hot skin through his shirt Malfoy moves his hand and settle them on his shoulders. The kiss was slow and sensual, and so damn good that he felt a buzz in his head. He should have done it earlier.
“Yes,” he said. Honesty was always the best cards in this kind of situation. “I’d heard of them.”
“Right” Potter deadpanned. “So, you hit her back.”
His breath will catch his ear, hot and wet, and Draco would moan, shivering, somehow embarrassed but so incredibly turn on.
“A fight maybe?” He shrugged. Unlike his friend, these kinds of things didn’t interest him.
Harry lifts his eyes and looks at her with all the disdain he could gather. It wasn’t really that hard, this morning was shitty already.
It was surprising to see how much Lucius actually cares about his son. After that heartless way he was talking about him, there he was, warning him to keep his hands for himself. Did he do it with all his predecessors?
“We’re leaving,” he told him before grabbing his hand.
“Ew.” She wrinkles her nose with a disgusted sound, but at least she was smiling.
He smelled luxe. He smelled power.
Potter looks oddly surprise, raising his eyebrows.
Draco blinks, and then he feels his lungs burns, as well as his throat. His voice was still rigging in his ears, already a distant memory, but for a few seconds, he could still see these endless holes staring into his soul like a collapsar.
The man tilted his head, amused, and leans his shoulder against the door frame. Draco follows the way his body move and shakes his head mentally.
He opened it and scanned the lines silently, Ron eyeing him while sipping his coffee.
And just when he was about to burst, the man lifts his head, and their eyes met, and Draco feel his blood run cold.
Most of the people just assume that he hates Halloween because of all the tragedy that had happened years ago when he was a baby.
It didn’t last long, however, before he feels the pull of Apparition. It wasn’t pleasant, really, but that gave him an excuse to press himself further against the man. It wasn’t long before they land on the ground again, so fast that if it hadn’t been for his grip on the older, he would certainly have fallen. Potter helps him get steady before letting go.
Could he make him look at him like that, he wonders? And if so, what would it look like?
Slightly surprise, he let his eyes roamed around the place, noting the particular choice of the deco. Where the living room on the other side of the house was warm and surprising
Somehow, he manages to drag himself off the bed. With slow movements, he got inside the bathroom and closed the door behind him. Like he had tough, his reflection was horrifying; his hair was a mess and his eyes were so red they seemed to have some burst veins. He sighs, and shuffling pathetically, he made his move toward the bathtub.
As a thought crossed his mind, Harry realises that he was, in fact, angry.
Where was Potter right now? he thought distantly through the blue sky. What was he doing, when he wasn’t around?
, Potter.
The elf somewhat seemed to come alive. He gestured to the right. “Over here.”
“Pansy wait –”
He couldn’t escape this. Looking around, he steps out of the crowd, Draco still hangs up on his arm. He seemed to be wary of her—if only he knew, Harry thought bitterly.
She disappeared through the flames and his room fall back again into silence. Draco popped his lips and waved his ponytail. He smiles at himself and sats on his bed to put his shoes - his favourite platform shoes that lifted his shape just the right way. Looking at himself, he felt satisfaction swell into him. He has always loved looking good – taking care of him had always been a personal pleasure.
What was he
And without waiting, he Apparate.
Draco sighs and sat up. He stands up and get out of his room, making sure to walk quietly. It’s not like someone would outlaw him, but somehow, thinking about being caught was unpleasant. Silently, he goes through the corridor and makes his way up to a room that was far in the corner, a room that nobody was using since he was a child.
The boy was a replica of Lucius, but younger. He had the same long white-blond hair, tight up in a long ponytail, but higher on his head, less loose and more defined than his father. He was wearing dark leggings that hugs his long legs, making them seem endless. Over it he wore a white oversize hooded sweater, long enough to get to his thighs. Looking at him, Harry thought he understood why his father seemed so deflected; beside his clothes, the boy was wearing a dark eye-liner that stretched out his eyes, and on his ears was a series of piercing that framed it all the way.
They crossed a living room in silence. Harry walks behind him, his eyes taking in every detail he could gather. The cane, he notes, wasn’t just there for fancy. Lucius Malfoy walks with a confidence that seemed natural, his step firm despite his limping. If anything, the limping adds some kind of aura around him, like an emperor.
???—and letting his skin
“Alright, fine.” He shrugged like he didn’t care, but his eyebrows were still slightly pinched. Draco looks away.
Draco sighed and took off his shoes. A little time and she will be calm again.
“Not as much as you,” Harry replied with concealed praise. “You’re far more notorious than me.”
He couldn’t help but frowns this time, choosing his words.
Draco didn’t even look at her.
A snort then, that sounds contemptuous, even at his own ears.
The amusement park was a thing that fascinates him. He had seen it for the first time in a magazine, and it had always been his dream to see it in real. Now, with Potter on board, he could realise both.
And kissed him.
“Yeah” he bends over and kiss him gently. “Want to go with me at Hogsmeade?”
She just smirked at him with that unnerving look of her. “Then why are you trying this hard for him?”
him, thank you very much, it was just disturbing.
Draco beams and, instead of putting his hand on his arm, he wraps his arm around his, invading his personal space. Even with his platforms on, he was still short compared to him, and this closed, Draco could really feel the difference. If he wants it, Potter could wrap his arms around him and crushed him to death.
You didn’t eat in the morning; how can that be?
Yeah. I'm just lashing out.
“What? Of course not, ew,” she responds with a wrinkle of her nose. In her defense, she looks utterly disgusted, and Draco feels himself relax.
Draco turns his head just enough to look at him. “Can you help me with this?”
, like he was some kind of precious guest.
The first thing he saw was her eyes, brown and likely
The man snorts. The blond feel himself smiles, and he relaxes slightly, putting his chin on his palm. It may be easier than he thought, he thinks distantly, biting his lips.
He didn’t see Lucius that much – in fact, he hadn’t seen him since their first encounter, before he settles down. Beside the fact that he didn’t trust him, Lucius was a busy man, so Harry wasn’t all that surprise. He had worked with this kind of person before; sometime, he took weeks before they could meet again.
He opens his mouth, then clap his jaw shut and scold. It wasn’t
People were gathering around them. Even the other houses were trying to know what was happening. And well, even if Draco was used to be the center of the attention, this was just ridiculous.
, and all his body arch of the bed and his dick twitches hard, and then he comes, and comes, and
Draco wonders what they would look like filed with lust.
No waiting to be told twice, the boy vanished behind the door. Harry turned around to face the patriarch of the house, questions swimming in his head.
She sighs, and to his relief, her shoulders relax. “I know.” She turned around to face him. “I don’t know how you put up with him.”
Potter sighs, a little lofty. Draco has the unpleasant feeling that he was thinking all of this fucking derisive.
The blond sighs. “Look,” he responds with all the calm he could gather, “I really don’t know what you’re talking about. And even if I sleep with your ‘boyfriend’,“ he mimics quotes, “why the fuck are you screaming at me? I’m not the one who was supposed to
“Why the hurry?”
He bends over to kiss him on the lip.
“Let’s go on a date” he stated, most naturally.
“Hurry up” was the only thing he said before stepping outside.
“Just so you know,” he said while lifting his chin, probably to keep up appearance, “I’m not ashamed of my sexual life.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He sighed. “I don’t have a crush on him” he deadpanned.
So, instead of replying, he bit his lips and mumbles a quiet, “ … no.”
When was the last time he had been on a date?
She places it in front of him. Avoiding his gaze, she serves him a cuppa, the silverware the only sound in the room. Her movements were fast and rigorous, but an air of nervousness surrounded her.
The man stared at him. Harry held his gaze, his face still and steady. A few seconds pass, and he seemed satisfied, gesturing to a door he hadn’t noticed.
“You were an Auror,” he started causally, earning a little glance at his way, “why did you quit?”
It was strangely hurting to see. All this hard work for nothing, he thinks bitterly. But most of all, he didn’t like the way Potter was distancing himself from him. Now that he had tasted the sweet of his nearness, he couldn’t let it go.
Honestly, Draco didn’t think it was going to work.
“Did you see Zabini?” the red-hair asks, looking around the room. Harry shakes his head, but raises an eyebrow skeptically.
Draco smiles, and Harry thinks that maybe Halloween wasn’t that bad.
, he thought, even if he expected it. He had spent the last few weeks gathering all the information he could gather on them, but then again, reality hit different.
They walk past the long alley. It had been a long time since he had taken this alley afoot, and somehow, he had forgotten how tall the hedges were. Like everything in this house, they were perfectly cut, like a never-ending tunnel. They didn’t talk, and Draco wonders what Potter was thinking of all of this extravagance; did he hate it like he did? Was he jealous?
He trails under, and then he was at his arse, firm and plumb. Merlin, he thought, and then he spreads his arse open, and there it is; his hole, pink, just behind a thin blue line.
The absinth was gone. Now, instead of green eyes, two black holes were looking at him, and a primal fear, the one that came from the dawn of time, wash over him—so strong that before he realizes it, he was screaming, and screaming, and
“Anthony Goldstein.”
Potter must have seen how frightens he was, because he looks away with a sigh.
. He was free to move around the house like it was his, and everything was at his disposal, like a privileged host. Somehow, this freedom was more unsettling. It was easy to be reckless when there were no red flags to keep him on guard.
“So, what do you think?”
“I’m hungry.” Pansy said, leaning against him.
“Yeah, bullocks! It’s Lucius we are talking about for Circe’s sake! And what the fuck do you think you’re doing walking around with his son like a fucking couple, huh?! Did you lose your bloody mind?!”
Harry crossed his arms. “Can I help you?”
He stopped in front of him and took the cigarette out of his lips. He was close, and Harry noticed that his eyes were sharps, almond-shaped eyes, glowing in the night like mercury and wrapped under fluttering longs pales eyelashes. So close, he could make out the differences between him and Lucius. Where the chief was all firm and hard, Draco face was sharp but delicate at some point. His cheeks were pink, his nose was thin and curved, and his lips were very defined, pinkie and pulpy. He looks almost like a doll, his features perfect and refined. The only difference was his eyes, so troublesome—like his emotions created a storm in them.
“Fuck yes!” he screams. “Oh my God so good! Anh! Anh! Harry!”
Draco ignored her. “You call me just for that?”
“Please, take a sit.”
Like the last time he was there, nothing had changed.
Pansy smirks. “Draco wants to get in his new bodyguard’s pants.”
Draco whimpers, and curls his hand up, meeting the balls of nerves deep inside him. His whole body positively keen, and his legs tremble as he repeats the motion again and again, his voice now shaky. His hips jerk, and before he realizes it, he was riding his fingers, trying to go as deep as possible, moaning and whining with how good it feels.
“God Draco,” Harry breathes. “You have no idea what you did to me.”
“I know,” the man responds. He vanishes his butt and leans foward to look at him. “Good day.”
“Harry Potter !” he exclaimed, and Pansy giggles, but he didn’t pay her any attention.
in front of the man he was planning to fuck with.
Lucius opened one of his drawers, winkled his CV. All the information in there were false—but Harry knew all of them by heart, as if they were true.
Great.
looking. Draco wouldn’t fuck him, but at least he seemed honest.
Pansy leaned toward her boyfriend like she was about to tell him a secret, but her eyes were on him when she speaks, “Draco has a crush on him.”
His skin was
“I had a friend coming over tonight,” he informed while opening his door and stepping outside. “Her name his Parkinson.”
, even. Like some sort of wild style that match him perfectly. With his dark jacket draped over his shoulders, he looks like something out of a fantasy. All tall and strong and mysterious in a way that make his knees weak.
His eyes were burning. How did it end up like this? All he had wanted was a good time with him.
Notwithstanding, that went pretty easily. Potter was clearly reluctant, but at least he had said yes—well, not technically but he did surrenders without a fight. Draco was too happy to care, and make a point in showing it. And if the way the man had frowns at him was any indication, then this date was going to be a piece of cake.
“So? Where do you want to go?”
He nods, more for himself, and made his move toward the door. “Clean the room, would you? And tell Pansy I’m downstairs if she wakes up.”
He lifted his eyes to the heavens. “Seriously, Pans’.”
He was a Griffondor after all.
“You can say that…” The boy said quietly, and then looked at him through his eyelashes. “You don’t look like a hero.”
Harry chokes on his glass and snaps his friend.
He laughs. “Yeah, tell that to all the assholes currently at Azkaban.”
They step back in a corner, just enough to have some privacy. Harry could still see the boy, leaning against a window with a grim face.
Hopefully, this doesn’t fuck up his plan.
Sighing, he let his towel fall on the ground and move toward her. She didn’t budge, even after he practically throw himself at her back, hugging her from behind.
Lucius, who was playing God without permission.
He taps his fingers on the table, a light rhythm with the same concordance – tap, tap, tap,
Being fucked in the big wheel doesn’t sound that bad, really.
“Oh Merlin,” Malfoy moans and squirm and arches, and Harry dives further, just a little, and then he dives his tongue inside him.
Draco frowns. “You’re lying.” He bits his lips and grips the edge of his sit tightly. It was so confusing, all these emotions that were coursing thought him. He was mad and sad and didn’t even know why.
Pansy was already in the shower when he enters his room. Her clothes were strewed on his carpet, all the way up to the door where he could hear the water flow. He sighs, drop his bag on the floor and walk to his bed, where he let himself fall without grace. His body bounces a little before he still, eyes staring at the ceiling.
“Damn it Hermione I’m not a fucking child!” he spat angrily. “Do you know how long I’ve been doing this? We are not at Hogwarts anymore, for fuck’s sake. I’m not a fucking amateur.”
“That's realistic.”
Lucius’s lips twitched ironically.
Potter tilts his head, enough to make his wild locks brush his cheeks.
Potter raises an eyebrow. “The amusement parks?”
“So, Potter,” the man said with a low voice, his eyes now voracious and more watchful, “why are you here?”
“I want you” he pleads, and Harry guts twist. “Fuck me, Harry”
“Is my father home?”
“What was that?” Malfoy asks, one hand on his hip.
Harry squints his eyes and meets his through the glass, frowning deeply. The blond was acting like nothing was amidst but his eyes were burning with a sly, so ever calculating. This kid had so much confidence, Harry wonders if he had ever been shut up for before. He was surely used to people crawling over him and doing what he wants.
But now, with Potter sitting next to him, moving with a surprising swiftness despite his strong build, he thought he could relate.
“Evening,” he said. His eyes flicked toward Pansy and he tilted his head. “Parkinson, I presume?” He took out his hand. “Nice to meet you.”
Pansy stands up from where she was leaning over him, pushing her hair behind. “Don’t know. Must have fallen asleep at some point.”
At some point, they were all gathered in the room or requirement. Seamus and Dean manage to have some firewhiskey—seriously, how they do that?—and with all the previous years absent, the party was more intimated.
Sighing, he let his bag hit the floor. So far, all seemed well—maybe too well if he was honest. Before meeting the man, he was so sure of being shut down—what were the chances, really? It was Lucius that they were talking about here—but by whatever miracle here he was, standing in the Malfoy house with a
