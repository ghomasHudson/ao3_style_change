Harry’s approval resonated with Draco and he made a mental note to tell Scorpius all about it. For now, though, he took a seat at the table and stretching his legs out underneath, he leant against the backrest and waited for Harry to do the same.
Draco only realised exactly how high-pitched his exclamation had been when both Harry and his mother placed their hands above their ears and grimaced. Biting down hard on his tongue, Draco swallowed his next remark and this time he didn’t hold back. He glowered at Harry and defiantly crossed his arms over his chest.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Harry reach for the black leather belt and fold it in half to form a loop. He gripped the two ends, then adjusted his grasp until he had a good hold on his belt.
“I’d be stupid to wound or kill you in my own home, Potter, you complete and utter imbecile. Even a trainee Auror would be able to work out that I am the guilty party.”
Harry gave voice to his astonishment, and although he’d merely whispered the words, Draco had heard them loud and clear.
Apparently, or so Charlie says, the presence of a single female dragon whelp is enough to turn everyone’s world upside down, and most of the staff onsite are either busy fawning over Tyra or fighting over who gets to babysit her. Earlier this morning and shortly before Harry’s arrival, Charlie’s even had to break up a duel between two of his Senior Dragonologists who could not come to an agreement about who was going to sit with Tyra first. Harry secretly thinks that these dragon-obsessed fools are worse than a bunch of Hogwarts first years, but he knows better than to mention that to Charlie. He does, however, think that Charlie probably knows that. It takes a select sort of breed of wizard or witch to become a Dragonologist.
It took the better part of fifteen minutes for Draco to calm down enough to lift his head out of his lap and look at him. His cheeks were tear-stained and blotched, his eyes bloodshot, and his nose snotty.
Harry gently caressed his cheek, using his fingertips and featherlight touches to offset the tight hold he had on Draco’s hair.
“I love this, Sir, your arms. I love it when you hold me down, when you push me down into the mattress and restrain me, or force me to my knees and keep me there. I love when you flex those muscles and wrap your arms so tightly around me that I couldn’t possibly move, not even an inch. I love your hands, Sir, when you take my wrists and squeeze them tightly or when you grab my hair or hold my chin. I love your gentle caresses and your firm grip. It’s everything to me, Sir.”
Draco still had fond memories of that morning. He remembered watching Harry for the longest time. His frown had deepened steadily the more time Harry had spent laughing. Draco had tried his best to keep his cool, but despite his best efforts, Harry’s insane bout of laughter had wormed its way underneath his skin, and after resisting for about a quarter of an hour, he’d finally given in and chuckled along.
“There’s a really great café not too far from here. They do amazing sandwiches, soups, and salads, it’s a different menu each day. Their coffee beans are home-roasted, and their desserts are all freshly prepared on the day. I’ve a feeling you might like the place. Can I treat you?”
Draco shot him a sort of sheepish grin, and taking a second bite of his apple, Charlie winked at him.
For a moment, Harry felt the intense desire to crack his whip and guide its fall to curl around Draco’s waist, preventing him from leaving, but cracking a whip with the intent of having it wrap around someone’s body while their back was turned went against everything Harry believed in, including playing it safe and obtaining consent. Instead of immediately following Draco into the cottage, he retrieved his shirt, put it back on and ensured that it was stain-free.
“There isn’t much time left until I’ve got to be on stage if I do manage to convince myself to step through the gap in that curtain.”
“Present from Scorpius. He saw your photograph on the front page of the Prophet the other day and told me in no uncertain terms that you don’t look all that happy and insisted that I give these to you.”
Furrowing his brows lightly, Draco looked around the room but couldn’t spot anything else that might give him a clue as to what prevented him from crossing the magical barrier. The letter continued to tempt him, drawing him in, and stomping his foot, Draco grumbled in frustration.
Harry, who’d been about to take another sip of piping hot tea, paused, and smiled over the rim of his tea.
“My little prince, I’m never going to be too busy to take care of you when you need me the most. I made you a promise, I made a commitment when I signed that contract. I’ll always be there for you. There won’t ever be any exceptions to that rule.”
Draco curled into him, and hugging him, Harry gently rocked him in his arms, ran his fingers through Draco’s sweat-soaked hair and kissed him softly, tenderly.
Somehow, over the last two years, he’d managed to get so emotionally invested in finding a way to help Potter that giving up simply wasn’t an option. At least not anymore. He’d thought about often during the first six months, but now he was in too deep. He’d turned nearly every stone and searched every magical library’s dusty corner. He’d sourced rare Healer’s journals from across the globe, and, feigning personal interest as well as using his research as a clever disguise, he’d even spoken to a several very knowledgeable people abroad. A few leads had seemed promising, but in the end, whenever he presented them to Potter, something wasn’t right and Potter, despite trying his hardest to work with him―so far, he’d been to the wildest, craziest suggestions―saw no improvement to his predicament.
“I’m talking about my feelings here, folks, not the intricacies of the lifestyle. I very much didn’t figure that out on my own. For that, I had all the support and then some, and Sir don’t you for a moment think I didn’t notice that time you checked out the kink books on my coffee table and thought I wouldn’t notice.”
He stretched a little more, curled his toes, and arching his back slightly, he pushed into Draco, who responded by teasing his lips with just the very tip of his tongue.
For a moment, it seemed like Draco wanted to ask a question or two, but after dithering for a few seconds, he simply nodded in silent acknowledgement.
Whenever Harry dominated him, he felt much the same way. Nothing but Harry and whatever toy, or implement, he held in his hand mattered. Everything else always faded away, became utterly unimportant. The more dominance Harry exerted, the quieter his mind became and the millions of thoughts that plagued him, day in and day out, stopped. They didn’t disappear, but they ceased to matter and no longer held any sort of power over him.
He planned to take the box with him to Romania to get Liam to cast a couple of intricate charms on the item. He wanted an unbreakable charm, and something that ensured Hira’s piece of art was scratch-resistant, and then there were a couple more specialised charms, stuff that required a high level of concentration, meticulous spell work and the engraving of several ancient runes, which was a painstaking task. While he was reasonably confident that he was able to perform most of the charms himself, Harry trusted Liam’s expertise far more than he trusted his own magical abilities. He excelled at the kind of magic a good Auror needed to do his job well, but there were certain types of sophisticated charms and incantations terrified him just a little.
’. He trusted Harry with his life, and that was the beauty of their relationship. It was the reason why Draco willingly tried out new things and allowed Harry to bend his boundaries repeatedly. He knew, with every fibre of his body, that Harry would never go too far. Harry knew his limits; he knew them inside out.
An unruly mop of platinum-blond hair appeared beside Draco and pushing his head through the small gap between his thigh and arm, Scorpius looked up at him with an expectant expression.
It was a six-tiered cake, coated from top to bottom in Slytherin green icing and an elaborate silver snake, that could just as well pass for a long string of uncoiled rope, slithered all around it. Its head rested at the very top, and its black beady eyes had a strangely curious expression to it.
Turning his head away, Harry smirked, then resolutely bit the inside of his mouth to stop himself from laughing at the irony of Caleb’s statement.
By the time they broke away, Draco wasn’t sure how much time had gone by, but he was thoroughly out of sorts, and it took him several deep breaths and a good few minutes before he felt clear-headed enough to sort through his thoughts.
Draco was stuck in one of many preparatory departmental meetings for an upcoming, rather intense case, and while he’d made it clear that he was bored out of his mind, his memo had also included an animated crying smiley. In his postscript, he’d written that he couldn’t possibly slip away unnoticed, but wanted nothing more than to escape this blasted and entirely unnecessary waste of his time.
“You sound like you’re blaming yourself for being human. Stop that nonsense, Potter. We both know it’s not healthy.”
He walked up to Draco, wound his arms around Draco’s waist and captured his lips in a soft and gentle kiss. It was unhurried and loving; a way for them both to physically connect with each other.
Smiling, Harry ran his fingers through Draco’s messy hair, damp hair, and snuggling closer, he pressed his nose into Draco’s long locks and inhaled deeply. Draco’s essence, pure and unconcentrated, mixed with the clean smell of the sheets, the scent of nature wafting in through the open window, the lingering fragrance of Draco’s arousal and the citrusy freshness of his hair. All that had Harry floating in his own little world and several minutes passed before he managed to regain a bit of coherence.
Draco hesitated for a moment, then did as told, but it took him two attempts before he managed to steadily stand on two feet.
“Trust me, Ro, Harry is pretty serious about that sort of thing. He had two incredible mentors, and they’ve trained him right. Harry is the sort of guy who won’t stand for kink-shaming or unsafe play. He hates wannabe Dom(me)s who know nothing but pretend they know everything with a passion. If he introduces you to someone, you can be sure your experience is going to blow your mind.”
Also, yes, I am unable to finish this story in 35 chapters so I have increased the chapter count to forty. There are a couple of loose ends to tie up before I'm ready to let these two go.
“Well, I think it goes without saying that I’m not the most confident person when it comes to public speaking, but after Caleb told me about his idea, I asked him whether I could be one of the mystery speakers. Hearing him say that he’d love to see me up there, sharing something immediately gave me the confidence to really want to do it, and now I’m kind of hyped up about it. I told Calen that I’d like to talk about our collaring ceremony, well, not quite. I want to talk about our journey leading up to the decision to have a ceremony and make that kind of commitment to each other because it’s not a decision that either one of us took lightly, and it means a lot to me to belong to Caleb. He takes such good care of me.”
A jolt of fear instantly unsettled him, and he felt his heart rate increase. He shivered, and as his hands began to shake again, Draco could barely resist the desire to flee. Every muscle inside of him had tensed up, and his skin was taut, pulled tightly across every inch of his body. He clenched his butt cheeks and felt some of his earlier arousal seep out of him.
He shook the box lightly, but whatever was inside did not make a single sound. Dithering for another minute or two, he eventually undid the silver satin wrapping ribbon and rolling it up, he placed it on the coffee table, beside his empty coffee mug. He tapped the lid, took a deep breath and pulled the cover off the box, then gasped.
Somehow, Walter senses that he’s the reason for Harry’s amusement, and annoyed, he growls quietly. Walter’s threat only makes Harry laugh harder, and he wraps his arms around Rose and Hugo, pulls them into his arms and gives them the biggest hug. They each also get a kiss. Harry offers to provide Walter with a hug too, even invites him up onto the bed, but his crup stalks off in a huff. Although amused, Harry promises to give him a big bone in the afternoon, but Walter completely ignores him. Harry shakes his head, and he and the kids stay in bed for another ten minutes or so. They cuddle and chat a bit, then all get up, brush their teeth and head into the kitchen for breakfast.
Over the years, he’s gotten rather good at juggling several responsibilities all at once. It doesn’t happen particularly often that he’s responsible for opening, running, and closing the shop when he’s already busy with the kids. Whenever that happens, Molly usually takes the kids, but today that’s not an option. She’s already got her hands full with some of her younger grandchildren, and there’s no way Harry is going to make her feel even more stressed.
“I’m not sure we’ll manage to come up every week, but we’ll visit. There’s nothing that’ll stop your godfather from seeing you, Teddy, you know that.”
He still stood at the bottom of the staircase, and he was still leaning back against the baluster, patiently waiting.
“I swear he was fine Saturday night and all of Sunday. I don’t think he slept particularly well Sunday night though. He didn’t hear his alarm on Monday morning, slept right through it. I actually had to shake him awake, and he was so grumpy and short-tempered. At first, I didn’t think anything of it. I mean, I’d be cranky too if tossed and turned half the night and then had to get up for work in the morning.”
“The bath will ease the pain a bit, my sweet little prince. And after we can curl up on the sofa and watch a film on TV or―”
On top of Harry’s crushingly tight grip on his wrists, Draco could feel the muscles in his upper arms protest against the unnatural position. They began to burn, and he let out a soft whimper ― this felt amazing, and he thoroughly relished in Harry’s power over him, and soon enough, he lost himself in the haze of it.
It is with furrowed brows that he falls back on top of his richly luxurious and fluffy pillow and sighs. He stares at the colourful Chinese dragon that rather majestically, as though it is a combination of a long line of emperors, flexes its sparkling wings. It flies slow and steady, circling above him with an air of refined grace and Harry is quite content to watch it for a little while longer, even if it’s blurred around the edges because he can’t be bothered to summon his glasses.
His voice carried a mild tone of curiosity, and for a moment, Draco simply held his gaze, then smiled.
Harry squeezed his wrists tighter still, and humming softly, Draco revelled in the possessive hold, Harry had on him, then whimpered when Harry pressed his lips to the shell of his ear and blew hot air all over it, then nibbled at his earlobe, biting it gently.
, Harry thought, silently applauding Draco on the eloquent way with which he’d changed the topic, going from a heavily flirtatious and sexually charged mood to ordinary small talk in a matter of seconds.
“Home to Wiltshire. We’re going to spend a couple of days at the Manor. Breakfast’s already waiting for us, I apparated over there last night and asked our house elves to help me organise everything. Mother was already asleep, but I suspect the head house elf informed her of your arrival, she’ll be chuffed to have us around to fuss over.”
He took a sip of his wine, then balanced it carefully on his high, keeping his fingers wrapped around the glasses’ stem.
Draco didn’t need to hear Harry say those three words, he’d become quite apt at reading them from Harry’s lips and laughing, Draco felt the lump in his throat dissolve. He raised his hand slightly, allowing the frayed piece of hemp rope to dangle in the air. He watched as Harry’s eyes briefly drifted towards it, then locked back onto his.
“Yes, you two children have fun on the playground. I’m going to go and do the mature thing, which his promise Draco to ply him with his favourite chocolate and let him have control over the television remote for a week. Merlin’s saggy balls, we’ll be watching
Teddy, Harry’s godson, and Draco’s cousin had a very soft spot for her, and even though he and Victoire were married and had a daughter of their own, he always tried to find a bit of time for his little sister. Draco loved watching the way Teddy fussed over her whenever he was around. He was more than just a little protective of Lily, and his behaviour somewhat reminded Draco of the way Harry thought of his little girl.
Draco clasped his hands around the fiery-red large mug in front of him. It was filled to the brim with the most delicious homemade hot chocolate, Draco had ever tasted. Mainly because it didn’t only taste of chocolate but also of love and home and safety and warmth; all the things Draco treasured.
Draco’s entire body started to shake and pulling away from the kiss, Harry watched as Draco fell, chasing after the thrill of a different kind of orgasm. He moaned, arched his back, and curled his toes. His hands blindly groped for Harry’s shoulders, and once he’d found them, he dug his fingernails sharply into them. Harry winced, but Draco was louder and drowned him out. He gasped for air, groaned, and flushing from head to toe, he came hard. His cock remained rock-hard, but his entire body convulsed, and a string of incoherent nonsense fell from his lips.
Harry smiled against his skin and pressed another kiss to his temple, then left a trail of butterfly kisses down Draco’s cheek, and nipped at Draco’s earlobe, playfully toying with it.
Draco’s cheeks flushed a deeper shade of red, and he bit the corner of his bottom lip. He let out a low moan, and Harry smiled.
With that many students, Harry is forced to hold his lecture outside and he takes his students down to the Quidditch pitch where he teaches them two new spells, an offensive and a defensive one, then has them practise in pairs. Teddy refuses to stand by and watch the others and boldly challenges a seventh year Ravenclaw student, who laughs but agrees to practise with him.
Draco’s heart thumped wildly in his chest, and slowly ripping the sealed envelope open, he reached inside, and he pulled out a single folded parchment. As he opened it up, his hands began to shake, and he had to take a deep breath to calm himself.
While he didn’t particularly want his boss or his mother to know, he’d learnt a great deal about the kind of relationship Harry, and he had. He’d discovered a great deal about himself and come to the conclusion that the only people who considered Harry’s and his lifestyle depraved were the kind of people who didn’t understand it. Those who did understand and Draco knew that Malcolm understood, saw nothing bizarre or strange in surrendering to one’s partner’s dominance and enjoying ropes, restraints, rules, control, and a bit, or a lot, of pain.
“I didn’t apparate, Malfoy. I took the lift, just like everyone else. The one reserved for court hearings. The DMLE uses it to bring the defendants down to the courtrooms.”
“Do you consent to submit to my authority, serve me, obey me, and promise to always be loyal to me, your Master?”
Draco, carrying a tray with a plate of sandwiches and two cups of piping hot coffee, walked into the room and dared to grin. It was a lopsided sort of grin and while Harry usually found it endearing, right this moment he was piqued.
“180cm by 200cm, wonderful. If you gentlemen would like to follow me down to the basement? We’ve got quite a few choices to select from.”
Draco considered the question for a moment, then dropped his hands to his sides, and gifted Ron a truly devious smirk.
“I vividly remember the first time he really took charge. We weren’t even doing anything kinky, and it was still very much a vanilla setting, but I melted, I simply melted. I didn’t know how to resist him; I didn’t even want to try. It was a combination of things that got me; the way he spoke, the way he looked at me, and the way he touched me. He unlocked something inside of me then, set me free to be the person I was always meant to be.
“You know, you’re the first submissive I’ve met who has a penchant for cracking whips. It’s normally the Dom(me)s who like to do the cracking and certain submissives who like to be on the receiving end.”
He carefully procured a small potion phial from the chest pocket of the shirt he wore under his uniform jacket, and uncorking it, Harry gently parted Draco’s lips with his thumb. He coaxed him into opening his mouth just wide enough so that he could sprinkle several drops of an undiluted hydrating potion directly onto Draco’s tongue.
The three of them headed for the bar, and while Caleb ordered, Harry perched himself on the edge of one of the leather-patted bar stools. He had an unobstructed view of the lounge area and smiled when he spotted Draco, who was engaged in an animated conversation with Liam and Ruby.
Draco gave a small yelp, his eyes narrowed and darkened, and he pressed his lips tightly together to express his disapproval.
Draco squeezed Harry’s hand lightly, and when Harry turned his head, he smiled. He’d noticed Harry’s somewhat lingering glance at the pram as the woman had passed them by. Draco knew that it wasn’t because Harry was broody and wanted a child of his own but rather because he missed spending quality time with his godson.
Harry looked thoroughly sour, and a feeling of unease spread from the pit of Draco’s stomach through the rest of his body. He tightened his hold on the two decorative pillows, Harry had asked him to fetch from the living room and pressed his lips together. A moment later, he parted them with the very intention of saying something, but Harry shook his head and motioned towards the bed.
He snarled the words between gritted teeth and instead of following his head and letting go of Potter, Draco shoved him further into the wall.
When Harry pulled away, he whined, wanted more, but knowing he wasn’t going to have it his way; he resisted chasing after it.
He cleared his throat, tugged on the sleeves of his shirt, and plucked a tiny piece of white fluff off his black designer slacks.
“Thank fuck for Charlie and your godson doing the right thing and knocking some sense into you, that idea sounds nauseating. Remind me to congratulate them both for their incredibly courageous act of saving Draco from all that nonsense.”
Blinking, he smiled softly. It was a shy sort of smile and the only physical reaction he felt capable of.
Draco briefly fell silent and recalled the moment he’d first set his eyes on Harry. They’d both been in Madam Malkin’s robe shop.
“You owe me a rematch, Draco Malfoy,” he snarled, deliberately lacing his voice with a generous helping of bitterness.
Ron still looked like he was about to explode with excitement, though Harry wasn’t sure why, and Draco had gone paler than pale. He listlessly played with his dessert.
Inspecting his work of art, Harry tugged on it gently, adjusting the tie here and there, then wreathed the remainder of the rope around Draco’s palms and his wrists.
With a smile, Harry expertly clasped his fingers around Draco’s hands, squeezed, then sought out the pulse points on the inside of Draco’s wrists. He pressed his thumbs against them, then drew slow and steady circles. More than two years had gone by since he’d first used this technique on Draco, and it still worked like a charm.
On the one hand, he desperately wanted to ask Draco about his tattoo, but on the other hand, Harry couldn’t bring himself to start that conversation. Somehow, the right words eluded him. He had so many questions, and since they all insisted on simultaneously running rampant inside his head, he found it nearly impossible to focus on only one and determine whether it was a reasonable question to ask or whether it bordered on crossing a line he wasn’t entirely sure, he was ready to cross.
“I couldn’t forget, not even if I wanted to. You and your wolf make damn sure to remind me every other day.”
Guided by a gentle swoosh of Harry’s hand, the door closed and the lock clicked, and Draco curiously looked around the room. It looked nothing like it usually did. For starters, gone was all the red.
The way Harry kept refusing to make eye contact with him that somewhat unsettled him. Harry repeatedly shifted his weight from one foot to the other―which resulted in him swaying slightly from side to side―and glanced around the room while worrying his bottom lip so hard that Draco was convinced it would start to bleed soon.
When the bell announces the end of the class, nobody wants to leave, and they beg and plead until they manage to butter Harry up and he demonstrates a few advanced spells. They watch with bated breath, ask a few questions, and afterwards, Harry shoos them out of the classroom and quite firmly tells them to go and eat lunch. They protest, of course, but this time, Harry remains resolute, and the students grudgingly begin to file out of the classroom.
When he pulled back, Roísín had put her wine glass down and was lying horizontally on the sofa with one arm and one leg falling off the side as she pretended to be dead.
Potter’s explanation made perfect sense, given his history and involvement in the war, it was logical and quite sane of him to demand some form of security. It was Potter’s unbelievable sass, and the way he’d effectively ridiculed him for his exasperated rant, that practically forced Draco to continue scowling at Potter, even if he only did so to show his dogged determination not to change his attitude. He gave the parchment in front of him a most distasteful look and defiantly crossed his arms over his chest.
, I don’t take kindly to people who repeatedly try and murder my partner. You may have managed to distract me for the last half-hour, but your joke of entrapments is second-year Curse Breaker Academy stuff at best, and that’s me being gracious. Now, Potter here needs a bit of a rest, so I’m going to finish you off if it’s all the same to you.”
No, tonight, she was here to celebrate her wedding anniversary, and the fact that somehow, she had consented to her family temporarily relieving her of all her matriarchal duties was indeed a feat in itself.
Harry casually flicks his hand and one wandless charm later; Hermione’s business suit is impeccable, and the kids no longer have specs of dust in their ginger hair. Rose impatiently wriggles her hand out of her mother’s loose grasp and because Harry knows what she wants―it’s the same every morning―he quickly sets his coffee cup down on top of a coaster on the mantlepiece. Once he’s no longer holding a steaming hot beverage in his hand, he bends down and effortlessly lifts Rose off the ground. She gives him a sloppy kiss and Harry gives her a big hug.
To further make his point, he inspected his perfectly manicured fingernails, then took another glance at the cover of
It trickled right through and into his voice, and the short, bearded man behind the counter raised his hand and dismissed Harry’s politeness with a wave of his hand and a click of his tongue. Harry suspected that he was a wizard, or at least in some way connected to the Wizarding World but he couldn't very well outright ask him that.
Harry took another sip of his drink and strangely enough, this time he really didn’t mind the sweetness of the beverage but savoured both, the coldness of his Mojito and the crazy amount of sugar.
He giggled softly and unable to resist, he petted the cheeky cub, running his fingers through its soft, thick fur. The cub yelped and made soft howling noises while it repeatedly nuzzled Harry with its wet snout. He glanced at Accalia, who was now lying beside him, nursing the white cub, and since she appeared thoroughly at ease in his company, he started to play with the cubs, picking them up one by one and hugging them against his chest.
“Of course, I do, I never said otherwise. Listen, will you at least consider signing up as a mystery speaker?”
Draco’s soft chuckle send a wave of excitement surging down his spine, and it pooled somewhere in the centre of his groin, faintly reminding him of the fact that he and Draco hadn’t been this intimate with each other since after the last time they’d played.
His stomach rumbled loudly, and instead of feeling embarrassed about it, he gave Harry a lopsided grin and shrugged.
Potter rewarded him with a growl―one that was supposed to warn him and stop him from taking this any further―and before Draco knew it, Potter had raised himself up to his full height. He moved forward, and Draco found himself flat on his back with Potter towering right above him.
Inhaling deeply, he watched Draco over the rim of his cup and waited with his first sip until Draco had sat down and opened the biscuit packet. Right this moment, it was more important than coffee, and Harry knew as much.
He felt a lot less anxious and more relaxed but knew for a fact that while chocolate always improved his moods, it wasn’t powerful enough to elevate the symptoms of sub drop. At least not that quickly.
For some reason, the expression reminded Harry of a thoroughly content cat that, after having lapped up a plate of kitten-friendly cream, was in a state of peaceful happiness. He briefly considered telling Draco, but then remembered what had happened the last time he’d been bold enough to compare Draco to a cat.
“Potter, I can nip over to Paris at any time, all it takes is one trip to the Portkey Administration Office and thanks to my badge, I’ll have a complete approval form within thirty seconds. The annual international MLE convention is hardly what’s going to convince me to drop my son off at the Manor and accompany you to spend my time sitting in boring meetings and listening to the pompous presentations of every single DMLE department across the globe trying to paint itself as the best one out there.”
Harry gave him a few moments to cool down, but continued to slowly push his fingers into Draco and pull them out again.
“It’s not magic, Draco, it’s a child’s innocence. There’s nothing quite like it, it’s virtually irresistible. It’s why I never quite managed to be properly mad at you whenever you turned the Manor upside down.”
He closed his eyes, licked his lips, and dragging his bottom lip into his mouth, he bit it gently, then let it slip out from between his sharp teeth. He moaned softly, and feeling rather blissed-out, he continued to fuck himself a bit faster but stopped when he felt a shockingly cold sensation nearly freeze the inside of his arse.
Harry reluctantly opened his eyes and looked at Draco’s face. He tried to find something in his expression, something that told him he’d gone too far during their roleplay, that he’d done something to put Draco off ever wanting to play again, but he found nothing. All he saw was love. Pure, unadulterated love. And trust. A bottomless pit of trust.
He felt Harry rub his prostate harder, more insistently, and the muscles inside his tight channel tightened around Harry’s fingers.
Draco’s fingers curled around the satin bedsheet beneath him. He squirmed, shifted, and a soft sigh fell from his lips.
Draco watched as Harry traced the sigil, starting with the inverted mountain and continuing with the two waves and the rising sun that emerged from behind the mountain. The four dots―one above the final wave at the tail end of the mountain, one in the centre of the sun, one at the open bottom half of a heart and one beneath the sun―especially captivated Harry and Draco smiled softly to himself.
“I’m fine, Harry, it was a long time ago. I learnt from the experience. Anyway, one of my mates at the house, Rudy, may he rest in peace, well, he noticed I was severely off my game. After a particularly nasty shift, where he actually had to drag me out of the fucking building because I just froze, he invited me to join him for a couple of drinks after work. Naturally, I got completely shitfaced, and one thing led to another. I spilt my guts to him. I told him everything, what I’d done to Kelly and how I couldn’t look at myself. I cried like a baby, and wept and told him that I was going to turn myself in because Kelly refused to file charges for domestic abuse. Out of all the things he could have done, he laughed. He didn’t beat the crap out of me, he didn’t drag me to the nearest police station, and he most definitely didn’t tell the house, he just laughed, then told me to come with him. He brought me to this secret, underground dungeon.”
Harry uncurled his finger from around the rope, and taking a step back, he allowed Draco to test moving with his harness. At first, his movements were sluggish and awkward, then he adjusted to the rope and worked around its restrictions as he gradually found a way to move with the rope rather than against it.
Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed that he’d left the door to Draco’s room ajar. Sure that his partner-in-crime was already up and dressed, Harry walked over to the door and pushed it open without as much as a second thought. After all, he and Draco had a habit of walking into each other’s personal spaces while away on duty, and it had never once been an issue. That was part of the reason why they always insisted on interconnecting rooms. When the hotel didn’t offer such amenities, either he or Draco insisted on adjacent rooms so they could magically spell a door into the wall.
Harry turned his head a little further and drawing back a little, Draco held his gaze. There was a sort of low-burning heat in Harry’s eyes that took every ounce of Draco’s self-control, and he clenched his left fist, deliberately allowing his fingernails to dig into his skin. Anything to distract him from the way Harry was devouring him with nothing more than a steady glance.
Sandwich still in hand, and coffee cup halfway to his lips, Harry turned around and promptly smirked at the genuinely thirsty look Draco was giving him. His eyes were dark with lust and full of longing. One didn’t have to be an accomplished Legilimens to work out what Draco was currently thinking about. His thoughts were most definitely utterly filthy and decidedly sexual in nature, and a flutter of excitement surged through Harry. Instead of allowing it to run wild, he controlled it rather effortlessly. For now, anyway.
He shook his head, and after a few minutes of quiet contemplation, he returned to the comfortable sitting area, although this time, he chose to sit down on the armrest right beside his mother. She reached up and caressed his cheek and smiled softly.
He walked over to the counter to check on the tea, and despite his initial resistance, Draco now found himself drawn to stepping closer. Like a magnet, he moved closer to Harry, and when Harry turned around to face him, there were barely two feet left between them.
The first-hand experience was everything, and Draco had already memorised every second of every minute of their dance. Harry’s steady and firm grip reminded Draco of several other times during which Harry had gotten a bit rough with him. The mental images his mind so helpfully supplied were somewhat distracting, and Draco resolutely pushed them away and focused on the here and now. It was for the best. Dancing with a rather prominent erection pressing against the inside of his bespoke suit trousers wasn’t something Draco was especially keen on.
“I’ll miss you too. I promise to firecall before you go to bed each night that I’m gone though. We can chat for a couple of minutes, how does that sound?”
“He phoned earlier to say he’d be late. Some sort of emergency just outside of London. Couldn’t really understand much over all the noise in the background. To be honest, it sounded like a riot was about to break out.”
He tenderly wiped some of the tears away and holding Draco’s face in his hands, he kissed the centre of his forehead, his eyelids, his nose, and finally his mouth.
Unwilling to get fully dressed, Draco had asked for Harry’s bathrobe and hiding in the oversized garment, he’d sat in the kitchen and watched Harry cook them dinner. When Harry had offered to feed him dessert, he’d jumped at the opportunity and indulged in a light chocolate mousse with vanilla sauce, Harry had made for him.
As he watched Potter retreat, Draco refused to acknowledge that he’d just licked his lips or that Potter’s backside was one he’d quite like to get intimately acquainted with. It took Draco a few moments before he managed to pull himself together and banishing all illicit thoughts that were in any way connected to Potter’s delectable behind, he took a deep breath, cleared his throat, nodded to himself and moved towards the lifts.
Harry briefly controlled his thoughts and focusing on the here, and now, he let a wave of intense arousal wash over him. It zapped down his spine and pooled low in his groin but thankfully didn’t send a large stream of blood rushing into his cock, causing it to swell and strain against his loose clothing.
It was a nervous chuckle and putting his sandwich down, he wrapped both hands around his coffee mug, relished in its radiating warmth, and boldly nodded.
Harry’s ears buzzed at hearing Draco so freely submit to his wish to address him by his title and he decided to push him a little further. He couldn’t and didn’t want to resist; he wanted Draco, badly.
He let his head fall forward, and Harry ran his thumbs along the length of the back of Draco’s neck. He pressed the tips of his thumbs to the base of Draco’s skull and massaged the tender muscles there carefully, applying just the right amount of pressure to enable him to untwist the tiny sore knots.
She gave him a thoroughly withering look, though not because he and Draco had been completely lost in their own world and shared a kiss at her dining table, but because she’d clearly exerted a fair amount of effort trying to get them to listen.
This took a bit of time to finish, mainly due to tiredness, so I'll keep this note blissfully short, upload the chapter and go to bed instead.
Oh yes, he was definitely going to grow a beard. It was about time he switched things up a little and added a different sort of spice to his and Draco’s play, and life in general.
He had no idea how he managed to resist the urge, but instead of giving in, he swallowed, breathed deeply, then steadfastly moved to the centre of the room, and gracefully sank to his knees. He didn’t sit back onto his haunches but kept his torso perfectly aligned with his hips and thighs.
Being waited on absolutely had its advantages and Harry wasn’t about to deny his little prince the chance to take care of him. As much as he loved doting on Draco, and making him feel loved and cared for, he also thoroughly enjoyed it when Draco reciprocated and showered him with love. His little prince usually did it through taking care of things around the house, ensuring everything was in order, and either cooking or buying delicious meals, and Harry appreciated it wholeheartedly.
“But never with my hard cock sheathed inside your mouth and my fingers tightly twisted in your hair, holding you in place like the good boy I know you’d be for me, Harry.”
He didn’t even want to hazard a guess as to what sort of mishap had resulted in a bottomless cauldron. It did remind him of Harry’s and his Hogwarts days, and especially of Harry’s non-existing talents when it came to brewing potions. Not a class had gone by where Draco hadn’t silently wondered how on earth somebody could be so dense when it came to reading instructions and following a recipe. These days, Harry was a lot better at brewing potions but artistry it was not.
Upon his return from visiting Charlie in Romania, he’d found Draco reclining in their bathtub upstairs. After a long day of research, he’d decided to treat himself to a luxurious soak with aromatic essential oils, a glass of red wine and some relaxing music playing in the background. Harry hadn’t been able to find fault with that. He loved spoiling Draco, and he loved it when Draco indulged in things that made him happy. Everyone deserved a bit of pampering every now and then.
Since much of the ground around them was covered in a vile, sticky substance that worked just like quicksand, there wasn’t much of a chance for them to move. With a fast escape entirely out of the question, Harry ducked and blindly grabbing Draco’s arm, he pulled him along. They both ended up in a strange crouched position that was precarious, to say the least. If one of them was to lose their balance they’d both end up stuck in the magical quagmire which was bound to slowly but surely pull them under, whether they wanted to or not.
Having Draco’s verbal confirmation that he indeed wanted to kneel at his feet made making him wait for it all the sweeter, and Harry let a whole two minutes go by before he spoke again. He removed his leg from between Draco’s thighs and let go of his wrists, then leant closer, and making sure that his breath ghosted over Draco’s lips, he whispered a single word.
Instead, he pressed his thumb against Draco’s pulse point. It took a minute or so before the familiar and calming touch took full effect, but eventually, Draco lifted his head again and looked at him with a faint smile ghosting around the edges of his mouth.
Draco snarled under his breath and scowled darkly, but since he wasn’t looking at Harry, his efforts were entirely lost and did absolutely nothing to quench Harry’s sassy cheerfulness.
Draco’s breathy moans turned into quiet pleads, but Harry removed his hand and pressed a kiss to the side of Draco’s neck.
However, the fact that he didn’t have permission did nothing to curb Draco’s desire and the aching need he felt growing in the centre of his chest. If anything, it only made him crave it more, but he controlled the urge, suppressed the impulse to transgress.
Draco looked at him with big innocent eyes. He stopped suggestively sucking on his rainbow-coloured lollipop and very slowly let it pop from his mouth.
This time he added a bit more zest to his voice, gave it a bit more of an authoritative edge. He already had Draco precisely where he wanted him, it never took much to coax Draco’s submission from him, but his devious heart wanted a little more.
For a moment, Harry wondered whether he should dial it back a notch, then he resolutely decided against it. This was way too much fun.
The second Malfoy had uttered the last word, Harry felt the familiar pull of apparition tug at his navel and his world swam out of focus.
“I don’t know if me saying this is putting my foot in my mouth, but I really like your dynamic, the way you act around each other. It’s a constant push and pull. Like, I’m not trying to be poetic, or anything but watching you feels a bit like doing a puzzle and finding two matching pieces. They slot together perfectly, and so do you.”
Harry gradually loosened his hold on him, and Draco focused and willed his legs to remain steady. It was a while before Harry completely let go of him and Draco felt inexplicably pleased about his ability not to dissolve into a pile of goo. He breathed deeply, calmly, slowly, and waited. Harry stepped away from him, then walked across the room to retrieve a black holdall from the red leather sofa.
As Harry pulled the door to the garden open, the hinges groaned, creaking in protest. Harry honestly couldn’t remember the last time he, Draco, or anyone else, and that included their children, had crossed the slightly raised threshold out into the small courtyard. As such, the wholly enclosed and unroofed patio didn’t look especially inviting.
“I don’t need to cope with that level of sass, Reid. I tamed that menacing little dragon a long time ago, and trust me when he says he’ll put you on your arse, you better believe he means business.”
Conscious of the time, Harry decided to postpone revelling in the memories of the milestones of his and Draco’s relationship. Instead, he got to his feet and stretched luxuriously, raising his arms far above his head and thoroughly loosening his muscles.
Harry snapped out of his reminiscence and focused on Caleb, acutely aware of the fact that he was still waiting for an answer.
Harry rather enjoyed the surprised look on Draco’s face and the way his lips formed the perfect O-shape. It was precisely at that moment that Harry felt sorely tempted to put his own whip down, walk up to Draco and grasp his hips tightly. He wanted to pull him into a fiercely possessive kiss and claim Draco’s mouth, lips, and tongue with his own.
His silver stainless-steel eternity collar glimmered in the low, but warm, afternoon sun and what with a black shirt as a backdrop, it stood out like a beacon. Draco fought hard to stop himself from staring at it and deliberately redirected his attention.
Seconds later, he shoved a large piece of perfectly prepared meat into his mouth and immediately sank his teeth into the tender flesh. His mouth filled with the tasty juice, and the all-consuming flavour had Harry close his eyes to better savour the taste. Grateful to be in the privacy of his living quarters, he gave in to his inner wolf’s desire to express itself and let out a rather indecent guttural groan. The food was heaven and Harry couldn’t stop gorging himself on it. He finished absolutely everything, and feeling rather full and somewhat sluggish, he downed three quarters a bottle of chilled sparkling water, before grudgingly heading into his bedroom to get dressed.
Draco groaned at the sudden and all-consuming burst of pain but adjusted relatively quickly. Harry thrust into him one last time, and keeping his head buried in Draco’s neck, he exploded on a long, low moan and filled Draco’s tight arse with streak after streak of white-hot come.
Draco opened the fridge and reaching inside, he retrieved another bottle of chenin blanc from the Loire Valley of France’s Anjou region. It was his favourite white wine to serve and enjoy with a classic British fish pie. While the chenin blanc wasn’t the most expensive or most exquisite wine one could serve with fish pie, it had a certain kind of tension which meant that it offered up a variety of exciting layers. Draco liked to compare the wine’s versatility to white mist rolling across a landscape, constantly changing the view.
Harry’s soft, teasing chuckle sent a zap of energy shooting down Draco’s spine, and he tried to arch his back but what with Harry holding his arms behind his back, he wasn’t able to do so.
He’d eventually chosen the dark-green shirt, and Draco was still immensely pleased about that fact. However, he had no intention of telling Harry how much he liked it when Harry wore something that reminded Draco of the House of Slytherin. The silken garment, another tailored item, complimented Harry, in all the right ways. Then again, these days, dressing to make an impression was something that came naturally to Harry. He knew exactly what to wear when and always knew how to look good, no matter what he decided to wear or not to wear.
“As alluring as that thought is, considering that you know exactly how to press my buttons, I am of the opinion that with you, I should avoid any and all temptation.”
Straightening up, Harry moved around the piano and towards Draco. With little effort, he wrapped his foot around one of the piano stool’s legs, and flexing his strong leg muscles, he pushed the stool back.
Harry struck him over and over again, sometimes lightly, and sometimes harshly, and Draco never wanted this session to end. He wanted his arse to gleam red for the rest of the day and all of the night. He wanted Harry to mark him good and proper, and when Harry struck him across the back of his thighs, and even between his legs, Draco felt floaty, utterly alive, and completely intoxicated. He lost count of the blows, or how much time had passed since Harry had smacked him for the first time, and when Harry eventually slowed down and finally stopped, Draco was higher than high.
Harry brought his hand up to caress his cheek, and his soft touch charmed a smile onto Draco’s face.
Harry’s whispered words of comfort wrapped themselves around him like a security blanket, and when Harry cupped his cheek and caressed it, Draco pressed into the touch. He forced himself to open his eyes and stared directly into Harry’s vivid green eyes. They were full of love and trust, dazzled him with sensuality, and sizzled with an all-encompassing passion that made it sheer impossible to focus on anything but Harry.
The familiar sound of an owl’s sharp beak knocking against the kitchen window broke Harry’s concentration and glancing up from the case file; he’d opened up next to his coffee, he stood up, crossed the kitchen, and opened the window.
Draco slowly opened his eyes but still didn’t look up. His gaze settled on Harry’s heavy black dragon-hide boots, and he swallowed, then gasped when he suddenly spotted the tip of what could only be a cane.
Not really interested in whatever was happening on the screen, Draco had made every attempt to distract Harry, and eventually, he’d succeeded.
Harry’s other hand found his cock, and he teased it, running his thumb around the sensitive head, and Draco felt a wave of tears spring into his eyes. Not because he was overwhelmed but because the sensations were entirely too much for him to process.
Narcissa’s understanding smile warmed Draco’s heart, and when she reached out to squeeze his forearm, he placed his own hand on top of hers. She glanced down at his signet ring, and her smile grew tenfold.
Harry rather liked the fact that he had a way of getting under Draco’s skin, that they were that close to each other. It was one of the reasons why their relationship worked and why, despite all their differences, they still somehow complimented each other. They each were a half, a missing piece of a jigsaw that, when put together, slotted into place perfectly and like it two magnets, unable to fight the force that pulled them together.
Her eyes sparkled with happiness, love, and hope, and Harry found it impossible not to let her intoxicatingly cheerful mood positively influence his own. She’d been smiling and laughing all day, and Harry loved seeing her like that. She looked younger than ever and her new dress, makeup, and professionally-styled hair were only part of the reason she looked so good.
Pleased with the level of Draco’s obedience, Harry continued to smile. He pressed a loving kiss to Draco’s forehead, a butterfly kiss to the tip of Draco’s nose and a lingering one to Draco’s soft, lush lips.
The sweet praise had a profound impact on Draco, and as he swallowed around Harry’s cock, he blinked rapidly, clearly trying to stop the tears from falling. Harry knew that his little prince was neither hurt nor upset, he could tell just by looking at him, and watching how he acted, but the words had most definitely moved Draco, and touched him deeply.
She was his only daughter, his pride and joy. The two of them were extremely close, and Draco couldn’t find any fault in that ― he shared the same kind of bond with Scorpius.
Granted, Teddy still clung to Harry any chance he got, but he didn’t mind spending time with his older cousin, and they often did stuff together and usually had the best time. What with Teddy being poorly, Draco suspected having fun wasn’t very high on his to-do-list, but he was sure he’d be able to find something to entertain Teddy with. Perhaps, sleep was all he needed and wanted.
With a chuckle, Harry rose to his feet and smoothed out his Auror uniform, doing up the buttons of his jacket.
After a moment, Harry pulled himself out of his thoughts. He set his coffee cup down onto a wooden coaster, and sitting forward, he let his eyes wander across the table. His mouth watered, his stomach rumbled.
Harry wanted to reach out and squeeze his arm to reassure him, just like Caleb had done for him only minutes ago, but Caleb waved him off with a smile.
Harry swiftly pushed a second one into him, and after a few minutes, Draco felt his entire body burn with the force of an imminent prostate orgasm. He howled and tried to push the feeling down, but Harry continued to rub that sweet spot deep inside of him.
He detached the correspondence, and wandlessly summoning a jar of owl treats, he offered Aaralyn a few.
During dinner, Roísín had relaxed a bit more, and Draco credited the wine for that. Harry disagreed, he thought the food was to blame and had praised him to the skies for his culinary skills. Draco had barely managed to hide his blush, and his collar had been the only thing that had stopped him from kicking Harry’s shin under the table.
Before climbing into bed, Harry had put on a pair of black boxer briefs and a matching t-shirt, but Draco was still completely naked.
Moving his arms, Draco firmly crossed them over his chest and scowled at Stefan. He briefly contemplated whether he could get away with a wandless tripping jinx, but when Harry squeezed his arm, he abandoned that thought process and settled for undiluted sass instead.
Deep down, he knew Draco well enough and didn’t expect there to be a problem, but he was also aware of the fact that while they intended to spend the evening surrounded by friends, there would also be strangers and they would be able to see the harness underneath Draco’s shirt. Harry had initially offered Draco a loosely fitting long-sleeved shirt, but Draco had taken one dark look at it, scowled, and threatened to set the offending item of clothing on fire to disappear it for all eternity.
Not quite ready to get out of bed and brave a new day, Harry rolls onto his front and buries his face in his pillow. It does nothing to muffle the kids’ excitement, but he tunes it out and dozes, drifting in and out of a light slumber, for about ten minutes or so. That’s when his grace period is up and the Rose and Hugo storm into his bedroom, jump up onto the bed and shake him awake. He grudgingly rolls onto his side, grabs Rose, and without the slightest bit of warning, he tickles her mercilessly. She squirms and squeals and begs him to stop while Hugo laughs loudly. Walter appears in his bedroom doorway, looking thoroughly dishevelled and somewhat disgruntled. He sits down on his hindlegs, and Harry can’t help himself; Walter’s reproachful look makes him laugh.
He encouraged Draco to verbally express his enjoyment and settled for the second round of sensual flogging, removing almost all the leftover bits of wax. Draco’s skin was red, marked with a variety of marks that ranged from the redness the sting of the wax had left behind to Harry’s cheeky bite marks and several pronounced love bites.
“The best, I assure you, and deep down you know it too, you’re just too much of a closeted Gryffindork to admit it. But, one day, one day, you will. I have faith in you.”
Harry set out to explore Draco’s chest with just his fingertips and his nails, and except for Draco’s nipples, he teased every inch of it.
Charlie placed a bookmark inside his book, snapped it closed and handed it to Liam, who took it and put it on the coffee table in front of him.
Harry couldn’t tell whether he agreed or disagreed but noted the mild annoyance flittered across his face but didn’t linger.
The doors to the outrageously large―and presently empty―walk-in wardrobe and the master bathroom stood wide open and glancing into the en-suite, Draco dithered, grappling with himself while fervently trying to think of a diplomatic way to express his opinion.
Draco hesitated and curling his bare toes into the soft carpet beneath his feet, he worried his bottom lip.
Teddy looked at him with a massive pout that actually melted Draco’s heart, but he remained stout. There was really no point in teaching Teddy the incantation. He didn’t have a wand just yet and wouldn’t be able to practise the spell anyway.
Though, what had really drawn Draco to Harry was that ninety-nine per cent of the time, Harry knew exactly what he wanted and wasn’t afraid of pursuing it either. That cocksure insolence really did unspeakable things to Draco and was how, after a year of Harry’s relentless pursuit of him, he’d finally relented and agreed to a date. That evening together with Harry had changed everything, so much that Draco didn’t really like looking back at what his life had been like before Harry had boldly gone and turned it upside down.
“Listen, Crina, I need a Portkey back to Britain right away, te rog. The closest you can get me to Grimmauld Place in London. Also, Liam might stop by later if I need him to join me, so have one ready for him too, just in case.”
He was completely naked and inside the shower in less than five minutes, and simply standing under the powerful jets of hot water, Harry closed his eyes and let his mind drift. He was too tired for a detailed reflection over the various aspects of his and Draco’s roleplay scene, but even in his fatigued state he knew that it had been a great success.
His eyes flew open, and settling on Harry, he let his mouth drop open and looked at him with an expression that he felt was more comical than questioning.
It had been that very feeling that had pushed him to jump over his own shadows and lend his knowledge as cursebreaker to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. At first, he’d, of course, been wary, but instead of using him purely for his skills, like the French Ministry had tried to do, Potter had opted for full disclosure.
Just as they arrived, one of the lifts called at their floor, and the metal doors swung open while a cool voice announced the level and the name of the department.
Without giving Draco a warning, Harry wrapped his arms firmly around Draco’s waist and picked him up.
“Yes, my boy. You know those two have history. This is their idea of foreplay. For tomorrow’s chores, you’re allowed your wand, sweetheart. You’ll need it to burn the sheets in the guest bedroom. There are only two ways this afternoon is going to go. Either they’ll wrestle each other to death, in which case I’ll have to renovate, or Potter here worms his way back under Draco’s skin using his irresistible Dom charm, and then Draco will beg him to fuck him through the mattress, in which case you may as well burn the whole bed.”
“You’re an abysmal salesman, Potter, do you know that? You could at least throw some chicken soup on top of that.”
Harry smiled to himself and letting his gaze casually wander around the room, he allowed his eyes to briefly settle on Draco. He was still sat on his custom-made piano stool.
While the primary purpose of the Ars Notoria was to bestow its reader with intellectual gifts, especially the concept of a ‘perfect memory’ ― when one looked closer, one could also find semi-hidden passages that referred to matters of the heart. These were mostly written in ancient Greek and while Draco was fluent in it, deciphering the passage that had driven him to draw a sigil for Harry, had taken quite a bit of time and effort.
“What a topic change and a half. Yes, I do. I’ve hidden them somewhere you’ll never find them. Do you want some?”
“I’ve a pair of safety shears on me. If you start to feel uncomfortable or you think you need out of the ropes, signal me, and I’ll get you off the stage and deal with it. Do not wait until it’s too late. I’d rather cut those ropes and find out that you’re actually alright than deal with you having a full-blown panic attack because you think you can’t breathe.”
“We’ll take it, day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute if we have to. We’ll get through this. I’m sorry I can’t take you outside for a proper walk. Believe me, I’d love nothing more than take you to a restaurant for a scrumptious meal, but we’ve got to get through this first.”
Reminded that this is all Walter’s fault, he glowers at his crup. Walter rubs himself up against his leg in an attempt to win his affections. With mild horror Harry realises, as he always does, that it’s absolutely working because Walter knows how to wrap him around his forked tail, has learnt how to do that since the very week he first came to live with Harry.
“I own you, my little prince. You belong to me. Your smart mouth, your beautiful mind, every inch of you, all mine, mine, mine.”
“I look forward to that day, Malfoy, although, if you absolutely must know, I already can’t resist you though the reasons for that are entirely unrelated to any secrets you might or might not be keeping from me. Now, shall we head inside and have a look around the place?”
“May your mind always be free from stress, and whenever it isn’t, or your find yourself clouded by troubles, may you turn and lean on me. I’ll be there to protect you.”
“Change it then, you don’t need my permission to redecorate. Have at it. The only room that’s off-limits is the playroom, but I don’t need to tell you that.”
“You’ll feel like that either way, I have it on good authority that babies have that effect on you, whether you want them to or not. I might be an only child, but just about everyone in Harry’s extended family has children, and family dinners are madness.”
He took a moment to settle his mind, then launched into a detailed recount of his and Molly’s earlier conversation, watching with amusement as Draco’s eyes widened steadily in complete and utter disbelief.
, he reminded himself and fought hard to keep his thoughts from straying any further. His mind played along until he stepped into an empty lift and the doors closed behind him. It was then that he began to think about all the reasons why Potter had invited him out to lunch.
“Takes one to know one. As a matter of fact, there’s a little something I’d like to talk to you about. Not sure whether you’ll be up for it, but I thought I’d ask anyway.”
Muttering something entirely incomprehensible under his breath, Draco pushed Stefan into the direction of the door but couldn’t resist making one last sassy comment before leaving the room.
In return, she made no attempt to wriggle free, and Harry smiled. Seeing his two friends so obviously in love, made him thoroughly happy.
Harry’s words were more than just words, they were a promise, and Draco relaxed into them. He allowed them to travel all over him and willed them to wrap themselves around his body. They wormed their way into his mind, took possession of it and unravelled him, bit by bit, piece by piece. Harry’s grip was tight; it was a proprietorial claim on his body.
Harry looked up from the paperwork; he’d spread out all over the kitchen table, and smiling at Draco, who stood in the kitchen doorway, he put his quill down. Draco’s hair was tousled, and his cheeks were flushed and rosy from the cold outside. Harry wordlessly reached out and motioned for him to come closer.
He followed Harry the short distance down the corridor, and they stopped in front of the closed door to the playroom.
Draco warily glanced at the folded crisp white parchment; Potter had just pushed across the table. Despite his damnably intense curiosity―which, and Draco was convinced of that, would one day be the reason of his premature demise―he managed to resist the urge to immediately reach for the paper and unfold it.
These days, however, it felt perpetually warm, as if by merely wearing it, Draco had breathed life into the ring, as if he’d allowed a part of his soul to ignite something buried deep inside the ring, an ancient sort of magic, perhaps, the kind that wasn’t easily understood. In Harry’s opinion, the embedded diamond and the two emeralds on either side of it sparkled differently too.
“I swear, Charlie Weasley, I will travel to Romania and murder you in your sleep if you ever breathe a word of this, but I am so in love with this man, I’d marry him tomorrow if he asked me to.”
Harry carefully brought his come-coated hand up to his mouth and inhaling deeply, he savoured the scent of it. It had an almost overpowering salty tang to it, but there were also elements of Draco’s essence and greedily licking the thick quite liquid off his hand, Harry swallowed every drop. His slowly softening cock slipped out of Draco and shifting so that he was lying next to Draco, he reached up and blindly undid the ropes that kept Draco bound to the bed. The knot came undone immediately, but it took a little longer for Harry to loosen the double-column-tie enough for Draco to wriggle out of it. Still, the moment, he was free, Draco engulfed him in a bone-crushing hug. Harry reciprocated, and they simply lay in the darkness, snuggled up close with their legs entangled.
, Harry thought. The words were on the tip of his tongue, but he bit it harshly and swallowed the sassy remark right down. While Molly wasn’t currently in possession of a dishtowel, he had no doubt that she would likely find or summon something else to whack him over the head with.
The first time, he merely says it to try and mildly intimidate his faithful companion. The promise to put Walter into a Full-Body-Bind for the next hour or so leaves Walter decidedly unimpressed and not at all convinced that Harry has any ability to gain the upper hand.
Even though Harry had yet to show off his own whip-cracking skills, he already knew that he didn’t stand a chance, and despite his own competitiveness, he didn’t even mind.
He bent over the side of the desk and pulling one of the larger drawers open, he dragged a leather briefcase out of it and kicked the drawer shut again. The bag, which he hardly ever used, came with a handy expansion charm as well as a lightening charm. It made it very handy to transport documents between Grimmauld Place, the Manor, and the Ministry.
Trailing his fingertips of his right hand over Draco’s shoulders, Harry let them run down the length of Draco’s arm, found the pulse point on the inside of his wrist and circled over it with the tip of his thumb, drawing slow and even rings. He crouched down, reached for his rope kit, and pulling out a fifth coil of rope, he opened it up, and leaving it lying on the floor, he cupped Draco’s cheek, curled his fingers around the back of his neck, and drew him in for a kiss.
With each spell he advanced, forcing ‘Tom’ to retreat. They played that game until he’d almost managed to corner ‘Tom’, then the unsub surprised him with a vile dark curse that left him with no choice but to duck.
It truly was a stark contrast, and one Draco regularly marvelled at. Harry preferred rules and order. He wanted obedience. But when it came to his paperwork, Harry was entirely capable of literally burying himself up to his neck in case files and interrogation reports.
He reached for the bottle of water, opened it, and offered some of the cool liquid to Draco, who drank eagerly.
“Wonderful, now off you go to your important meeting. If you’re good and get home on time, I might even let you persuade me to do something about that growing problem in your pants.”
“Are you trying to tell me that you’re able to make it up to the DMLE, get changed, and meet me in the Atrium in the space of five minutes?”
“You’re a werewolf,” Draco blurted out, realising much too late that he’d apparently managed to momentarily misplace his ability to filter his words.
He set his now empty tea mug down, pushed his chair back and stood. Before moving away from the table, he allowed himself a small stretch and watched as Harry traced the sigil with the tip of his index finger.
“Perfect. Just perfect. Now, let me tell you what I want. It’s really quite simple. I want to own your mouth, I want to claim it, and I want full control. Let me fuck your mouth, my gorgeous little prince. Tell me, do you consent?”
That wasn’t strictly true, though. Harry was very much devoted to his job, a relationship he had absolutely no problem devoting most of his energy to. Ensuring everyone in the Auror Department was at the top of their game demanded a great deal of time and whatever the long hours at the office and in the field didn’t leave much room for dating. That required a flexible schedule, effort, and the willingness to get to know someone, but most importantly being open to letting a perfect stranger in. This was the part where Harry drew the line.
Harry turns his attention back to Walter and tells his crup precisely what he thinks of him, namely that Walter is utterly despicable. He reminds him―quite firmly―that it is Saturday, that he doesn’t have to work, that day hasn’t even broken yet and that Rose and Hugo are at Cochach’s Grange, then pauses long enough to fix Walter with a long, stern glare.
Draco let his eyes linger on the open case file. He knew how long it took to complete these blasted forms and he couldn’t help but admire Harry’s attention to detail.
Part of Harry wanted to be annoyed―he hadn’t expected that shopping for a mattress would take quite this long―but his desire to distract himself from the fact that he was absolutely famished kept him from pursuing his mild irritation. He now knew more about mattresses than he’d learned in his entire life, much more than he’d ever wanted to know.
Draco had joined a small group of Stefan’s friends. One of them was in the midst of an animated demonstration of something or other, and Harry’s eyes shifted to the smooth grey collar, he’d fastened around Draco’s neck earlier, before they’d left.
A moment later, Draco heard the leather snap. He concluded that Harry must have folded the belt in half and pulled it tight. A shudder surged down Draco’s spine. The sound always terrified him. Out of all the impact toys, Harry kept inside the playroom, he reserved the belt for punishments and mild fear coursed through Draco’s veins, causing him to freeze for several seconds.
“I’m not sure whether my flamboyant gayness is a compliment or an insult, but I’m gonna go with the former because the latter would mean hexing you to the moon.”
Harry knew that Draco was trying to trick him into believing that he had nothing to worry about, but he was doing an abysmal job at keeping his cool mask of indifference in place. Besides, Harry knew him too well to fall for that trick, and Draco’s inability to stop himself from clasping and twisting his hands together was a sure-fire giveaway that he wasn’t able to calm himself enough to appear unbothered.
Inside Harry’s office, when they went over a case, reviewing evidence, chasing trails, and discovering leads, they bickered a lot more, and Draco seemed to thoroughly enjoy trying to get a rise out of him, but it didn’t change the fact that their working relationship was perfect.
He jumps forward, quick like the wind, and catches the corner of Harry’s duvet between his teeth, and before Harry has the chance to grab onto it―Seeker skills and over twelve years of active Auror duty be damned―Walter has won, and the covers are on the bedroom floor.
He gave Draco a highly appreciative once-over. The pair of black tailor-made chinos, he’d chosen earlier, fitted Draco like a glove and the light-grey button-up shirt complimented both the trousers and the collar perfectly.
He sucked in as much air as his lungs could take, traced the two faint markings on Draco’s arse, then landed another blow, and another, and a fifth.
Draco momentarily closed his eyes and bit his bottom lip, then drew in a deep breath. While he preferred it when Harry called him his
It was part of how they played. With direct questions, Harry always wanted a verbal response. He was very good at picking up small cues and interpreting body language. Those sort of non-verbal reactions were reserved for different types of play. Mostly for some forms of edging, wax play and rope bondage. All situations where Draco was very likely to lose himself in his own head and find it hard to articulate himself properly using full sentences or even single words to provide Harry with cues as to how he felt about what was happening. Then again, this wasn’t a scene. Harry had no intention of abusing Caleb’s trust in him and ignoring the club’s strict policies on the open-door-only play. All he wanted was to give Draco a little bit of himself to take on stage with him.
After the whole nightmare with David, he’d sought solace and advice from Charlie, and being the responsible honorary big brother that Charlie was, he’d travelled all the way to Canada, putting up with temperatures that ranged between minutes twenty and minus thirty-five degrees Celsius.
Charlie repeatedly cracked his whip in front of himself and behind himself, moving his whip’s handle as though it was the windshield wiper of a car.
“―yes, and according to you, oh great one, I ought to be eternally grateful to you for the sensitive and tactful way you talked her down.”
In response, Harry firmly tugged on the harness, causing the ropes to cut deep into Draco’s skin, reminding him precisely of who was in charge.
There was love, of course, and respect. There was admiration, belief, desire, want, lust, eagerness, fire, and the urge to possess, to hold, to have, to keep, to own, not just for a moment, but for all eternity.
“I support that idea. If you do it right at the start of the holiday, you can spend the rest of the trip indulging in all sorts of kinky fun, and trust me it’ll be another level of kinky. Once you give it to him and he accepts it, that’s it, playtime isn’t ever going to be the same.”
Ginny, home for the weekend after a long series of Quidditch tournaments, looked thoroughly amused but shrugged. Despite her confidence and cheek, she, too, seemed disinclined to side with him and bore the brunt of her mother’s wrath.
Draco’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed and Draco licked his lips with the very tip of his pale pink tongue.
Draco arched an eyebrow at Harry and smirked. He suppressed his desire to remind Harry of their last holiday up in the very north of Scotland where they’d made excellent use―or misuse, depending on one’s individual point of view―of the hotel room’s extremely thick and plush shaggy rug.
He opened his eyes and with his smile still firmly in place, he exhaled slowly, then breathed evenly, refusing to allow a simple bout of stage fright to get the better of him. He remembered Harry’s more recent words of encouragement.
This one was quite possessive and passionate in nature, and when he pulled away, Draco was slightly breathless, and his pupils had dilated a little further, making his eyes appear almost black. Harry caressed his flushed cheeks, teased his fingertips down Draco’s neck and without breaking their eye contact, he drew an ancient rune onto Draco’s chest and murmured an incantation to activate it.
Apparently, a casual jumper wasn’t good enough for a party. It didn’t matter that it concealed the harness entirely; Draco refused to be seen dead in a jumper he wore to lounge around the house.
“I’m not. It’s just that normally chocolate of any kind doesn’t last more than two minutes around you.”
With that, Draco rather resolutely picked himself off the ground, stood up, brushed his robes off and rearranged them a little to make himself look a bit more presentable. He moved towards the door, and by the time he’d reached for the door handle, Potter had also gotten to his feet.
An animal that ignored its inherent disposition to remain alert and conscious risked getting itself killed, or so his wolf had repeatedly told him.
Every now and then, Draco hummed murmured something entirely incomprehensible, and each time he did, Harry stopped to caress his cheek, kiss his forehead or shower him with sweet words of praise. In response to his physical and verbal affection, the corners of Draco’s mouth curled upward, and he smiled goofily. It was a rather infectious smile and sooner rather than later, Harry found himself mirroring it and humming some random pop tune, he’d heard on the radio the other day, he finished cleaning Draco up.

“I’m not sure. Nobody’s ever conditioned me to associate that sort of touch with tranquillity and safety.”
By the end of it, when Draco was so out of it that he could barely tell the difference between up and down and left and right, Harry would mumble that evil little spell that made his cock wilt like a dead wildflower and while the spell did wonders to his erection, and stopped his cock from turning blue and then black, did it absolutely nothing to curb his desperate need to come. He’d begged every night, on his knees with his arms behind his back, but while Harry praised him for being good and obedient, he was relentless and devious and most definitely not in a giving mood.
The longer Harry looked, the longer he didn’t touch, the more Draco wanted it, craved it, desired it, and the less he managed to restrain himself, to resist the urge, to―
“Instead of getting up for breakfast, no matter how elaborate, you prefer to sleep in on Saturday mornings, and there’s nothing that will ever make you give up chocolate and sugar quills.”
Harry turned his head and looked at Shacklebolt, who pressed his lips tightly together and shot him a glare. Straightening his back, Harry briefly averted his eyes and racked his brain for the topic at hand. He’d been listening to the ongoing discussion, just not as diligently as he probably should have. Carefully placing his pen on top of his personal notebook, Harry reached for his coffee mug to buy himself a few more seconds. He took a small sip, swallowed, cleared his throat and setting his cup down, he nodded.
Draco still enjoyed escaping the madness of the Prosecutor’s Chambers in favour of spending his afternoons in a coffee shop, sipping a quality cappuccino and losing himself in the task of perusing a large number of documents in preparation for a trial or a speech to propose an amendment to existing or outdated wizarding laws.
What Harry and he had now was a million times more memorable than the simple friendship he’d chased after some nineteen years ago. Theirs was a unique bond, built on trust, communication, love, and the mutual respect for each other’s boundaries. It was more than he’d ever hoped to find. It was everything.
The world around Draco swirled, fast and without any regard to whether his stomach was happy about the sudden disruption to stillness or not.
“Well, if it at all helps, you could always think of tonight’s audience as a whole bunch of triple murderers.”
He drew his wand, and carefully holding it his hand with the hilt snuggly resting in his palm, he took a few steps around the room, tilting his head from one side to the other as he contemplated what changes he wanted to make to the room. Draco considered his options for several minutes, waiting for a few ideas to come to him. He smiled at Harry, who eyed him somewhat suspiciously but did nothing to stop him.
He reached for the black satin box with Draco’s gift, and walking off, he slipped it back into his right trouser pocket, and wandlessly cast a non-verbal shrinking charm. As he continued to walk into the direction of the toilets, he couldn’t help but smile to himself. Back when he’d first spoken to Hira and solicited his help in designing a special gift for Draco, he’d provided Caleb’s friend with a haphazard sketch of a what he had in mind. Hira had taken that sketch and turned it into something that was beyond stunning.
“My mother, Harry, is an ageing woman, you know that as well as I do. She is completely and utterly delusional, and I expect that she’s had a bit too much sherry at her bridge club recently. I can assure you; she’s probably heard a similar story from one of the other ladies, got confused and ended up thinking it was me.”
Draco had, for the longest time, worn it around his wrist, happy to feel the hemp slowly turn soft as it rubbed against his skin. It reminded him of Harry and the side of their relationship that had taken him on a rollercoaster ride of self-exploration and discovery.
He wrapped his fingers around Draco’s cock and teased him with a series of leisure strokes. Draco tried to thrust into the touch, but given that his arms were restrained over his head and Harry was sitting on his thighs, he couldn’t really gain any traction. He voiced his displeasure with a disgruntled groan, and Harry applied a bit more pressure, moved his hand a little faster. He watched Draco like a hawk, looking out for any signs that he was edging closer to an orgasm and exactly when he was seconds away from the point of no return, and his entire body was taut and thrumming with desire, Harry stopped.
, Harry thought to himself, and a burst of warmth exploded somewhere behind his heart and spread through him, leaving him feeling content and happy.
Casually flicking his hand, Harry wandlessly turned the powerful jets of water off, and stepping out of the large walk-in shower, he strode through a thick cloud of steam. He wandlessly summoned a towel from the nearby towel rack. As it flew across the room, Harry reached out and plucked it out of the air with practised ease ―
“In Reginald Warrenforth’s case, you decided not to make an appearance at the initial crime scene, is that correct, Director Potter, Sir?”
He drowned in Harry’s breathless groans. His breathing was harsh and warm and wet and everything Draco wanted and more.
on him, Draco’s mind was positively racing. Yes, in a way, Harry had handed him the reins and had told him that he could do whatever he wanted, but he hadn’t given him control. Draco only needed to take a look at Harry’s face to know that. Right now, Harry was firmly in control and somehow, that made the whole thing inexplicably sweeter and a lot more exciting.
“Stupid move, Malfoy, idiotic move really. And I thought Slytherins were smarter than that, yet here you are, breaking into the Ministry on the weekend. Couldn’t think of a better disguise, eh? It had to be a prosecutor’s robes… Well, I’m sure going to have my fun prosecuting you, Malfoy. It’ll be my pleasure to charge, arrest, prosecute, and throw you into one of our finest cells.”
“I didn’t mean it that way, Malfoy. Apparently, it didn’t take my dad and my godfather more than a school year to become Animagi. I guess it’s in my blood, or at least I like to think that it is. Besides, I was determined to learn how to do it. Determination goes a long way.”
“I should hope it’ll be a while before I know everything there is to know about you, Potter, but nevertheless, should you one day become predictable, I’ll develop a few secrets of my own, and the Auror in you simply won’t be able to resist me.”
Harry frowned inwardly but ignored his wolf’s little dig at his inexperience. It didn’t happen very often, but occasionally his wolf liked to be a bit cheeky, though it was always careful not to infuriate him.
Draco pressed his lips together and fought his hardest to force the unbelievably cheeky response, that presently lingered on the tip of his tongue, right back down into the abyss it had come from. Somehow, he didn’t think to answer Harry’s question with a flippant ‘
Despite the questioning look that had been on his face, Draco had obeyed him and followed his instructions. As told, he’d taken off all of his clothes, except, of course, for his black boxer briefs and matching black socks. What pleased Harry especially was the fact that Draco had folded his clothes neatly and placed them on top of one of the two chairs that stood in front of Caleb’s desk.
He boldly held Draco’s gaze and took another step closer, making it so that there was barely any gap between them at all.
Draco and his legal team occupied the three rows of robust wooden benches directly in front of the witness box, and Harry couldn’t help but smile.
“Potter, I don’t give a flying fuck. If you were God himself, I’d make you promise me the same thing, and promise me you will. You will not go out there until it’s safe. I will not lose you. This is non-negotiable. If you insist on keeping me locked up in here for my own safety, you will bloody keep me company until every single wall in every single room falls onto your head. You will stay away from any kind of danger. We’re stuck in the epicentre of the outbreak, and I’m not taking any chances. I cannot and will not lose you!”
“I’m sorry, Mother, I didn’t mean to speak to you like that. It was uncalled for and disrespectful. Please forgive me.”
Harry couldn’t help but chuckle. He brought his tumbler up to his lips, paused and tilted his head to the side so that he could look at Malfoy. Instead of using words to express himself, he simply shifted, moving properly into Malfoy’s personal space.
Walter snorts happily, bounds forward and nuzzles his hand with its wet snout and to show the crup that he’s just a little cross with him, Harry drags his hand away and reaches for his wand again. As his fingers wrap around the hilt and he tightens his grip, he delights in the strength that oozes from the phoenix feather inside. It tickles the palm of his hand quite nicely. With a smile, Harry swooshes the holly and flicks the switch that turns the lamp on his nightstand on. At once, his bedroom is dipped in a soothing shade of golden hue. With the appearance of the light, the last of the firework dragon disappears with a faint sputter and a low protesting hiss.
Draco’s cheeks pinked slightly and running his fingers through Draco’s soft, platinum-blond hair, Harry curled his finger into it and rested them at the back of Draco’s neck, then pulled him in. Draco resisted him for a few seconds, then grudgingly surrendered.
The sound of the front door falling closed behind him seemed, somehow, louder than it had ever before, and when the wards activated in response to it, Draco shuddered at the sudden onslaught of the powerful magic. He felt rather than heard the clicking of the lock, and in order not to let anticipation overwhelm him, he straightened up, slightly shifting his body weight from his left foot to the right as he did so.
He thought and thought and thought, and when his mind finally settled on an idea, he hesitated for several moments.
Following the question, Harry smirked to himself. He pulled on Draco’s nipple, then moved his hand to give the other the same treatment and twisted his hand up and down the length of Draco’s cock, expertly stimulating it.
Harry had to, once again, shake off the memories and closing the door on that particular part of his history; he wordlessly pulled Narcissa into a hug, which she, much to his delight, reciprocated.
“The night Harry and I properly played for the very first time, I mean it was an actual scene, not just a bit of kinky sex, we sat in here just like this. Except there was no tea, we’d just finished dinner. He just sat there in that chair, like you’re doing now. He oozed confidence, and he just sat there, patiently waiting for me to absolutely lose it.”
Since Monday, Draco had been acting relatively strange, and although Harry had felt tempted to sit him down and question him about his behaviour, he’d decided against it.
Draco hummed in response to his request and shuffling a little, he tilted his head up and looked at him.
They’d known each other long enough to be able to communicate without words. Ian was Britain’s leading magical tattoo artist, and his creations were world-renowned. For the past two decades, he’d been at the top of his game, and he showed no signs of slowing down. His motto was that for as long as his hand was steady and his mind full of imagination, he had no interest in giving up his beloved craft.
Leafing past the foreword, Draco skipped straight to the first chapter. With both eyes focused on the book, he leant forward and reaching for his teacup, he wrapped his long fingers securely around the mug, and brought it up to his lips.
Draco smiled at the memory, and reaching for the corkscrew, he expertly opened the bottle of wine and headed back into the living room.
Turning around, and with his eyes twinkling with unabashed amusement, he stepped closer, forcing Draco up against the bannister. He placed his hands on either side of Draco’s body and took another half-step forward.
“Don’t you even think about running, Malfoy, any attempt to flee and I’ll take you straight to Azkaban. It’ll be a one-way ticket for you. No more pretending that you’re Prince Charming.”
Sometime after their passionate love-making, though unsure for exactly how long he’d napped, Harry woke to the sound of his rumbling stomach. Rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, he stretched, yawned, then sat up, and stretched once more. He extended his hand and wandlessly summoning his glasses from nightstand beside him, he pushed them onto his nose and looked around.
Draco collapsed on the bed, unable to keep himself up any longer, and gathering up the last bit of his strength, Harry shifted, moved them into a very comfortable position and hugged Draco tightly to his chest. As he did so, he expertly removed Draco’s blindfold and ditched it somewhere on the bed.
He felt gobsmacked, and for some reason, Harry found it extremely difficult to connect the intricate design on Draco’s back with everything else he knew about him. The Draco he knew was professional, conventional, complicated, and somewhat traditional. Draco cared about his appearance, his manners, the way he behaved and how people perceived him. He thought things through, never jumped to conclusions, and preferred to look at a problem from all angles before deciding about how to proceed. The tattoo on his back, however, Harry equated that to a person who was more like himself. Someone who jumped in headfirst, who took risks, lived in the moment with no concerns for the past or future, perhaps occasionally struggled to conform to the rules society imposed on him, and lived for the taste of unrestrained freedom and the bittersweetness of love.
The idea of having to present his own whip-cracking skills to Draco, while simultaneously also having to deal with a raging hard-on pressing against the confines of his tight black jeans, wasn’t one that particularly excited Harry, and he gladly focused on what Charlie was doing. He put several different cracks together and cast them in rapid succession, creating a complicated-looking sequence.
After a while, he moved on to show Draco the Backward Cattleman’s Crack and eventually the Overhead Crack as well as the Coachman’s Crack.
Draco’s cheeks pinked, and his eyelids fluttered as if he couldn’t decide whether to keep his eyes open or close them in resignation.
To say that Potter’s question startled Draco was the understatement of the century. No longer able to focus on the neat handwriting in his report, or take in any of the information the file contained, Draco slowly lifted his head and turned it sideways to look at Potter. It took him every ounce of self-control to remain unfazed and retain his signature sass.
He recalled Harry’s kisses, his tender loving touch, his warm voice, and how he’d cared for him, and it instantly made Draco a bit tearful.
That look was all it took for him to feel like a five-year-old, and Draco loathed the fact that his mother had that uncanny ability. Apparently, this was a quality all mothers possessed, and according to Harry, Molly Weasley wasn’t any better, but since she always smothered him with love and plied him with extra home-baked chocolate chip biscuits, Draco wasn’t particularly inclined to believe Harry.
He continued to caress every inch of skin he could comfortably reach with teasing feather-light touches, but since he couldn’t bring himself to look away from Draco for even just a second, his attention remained on Draco’s face.
The coffee shop where Harry had first approached him was only a few minutes away, and instead of rushing to get there, Draco took his time. Together with Harry, he strolled down the pavement, thoroughly enjoying the chance to walk alongside his husband-to-be.
An electric jolt of excitement zapped down the length of his spine, and when it reached his groin, Draco thought a streak of lightning had struck him right in the centre of his crotch. Something red-hot and fiercely intense unfurled inside of him and spread out through the rest of his body, setting it on fire too.
He waved his hand and wandlessly summoned a pile of his clothes from upstairs. He slipped on pair of snow-white boxer briefs and pulled them up, then stepped into his favourite pair of skinny black jeans. Finally, he stuck his head and arms through a plain grey t-shirt and put on a black cardigan.
Draco brought a single hand up to his face and attempted to dry his cheeks; however, Harry caught his hand before he could complete the action, then did it himself.
Harry stands by and watches proudly―and bemused―as his godson proceeds to teach the seventh year a proper lesson, because, well, when you’re Harry Potter’s godson and spent most of your youth running around the DMLE, you learn a thing or two about duelling.
He inhaled deeply, felt another wave of sweat break out all over his body and quickly downed most of the milk inside the pot.
“I’m not gay!” he snapped with a livid expression, cheeks lightly pinked, eyes narrowed, and lips pursed tightly in annoyance.
Shaking his head, Draco pulled himself out of his reverie, and glanced back and forth between Charlie and the box in his lap.
Draco’s smile grew tenfold and having had his fill, Harry set his cup down on top of the coaster. He reached for a napkin and unfolding it, he ripped a thin strip off one side, then casually wrapped it around the tip of his left index finger. He was completely aware that Draco was watching his every move, his beautiful silvery-grey eyes sharp and focused.
Harry seemed entirely unperturbed by the fact that Draco had him at wand point and Draco cursed Harry’s idiotic Gryffindor bravery, as well as his lack of boundaries and the day he’d fallen head over heels in love with this twat, to the ends of the earth.
Biting back a smirk, Harry wondered whether Draco would manage to control himself or whether he would give in to the temptation to ask.
But the feeling of peace did not last for long, and a rather strange feeling of anxiousness once again settled over him. Harry tried his best to shake it off, but the sensation stuck to him like sticky bread dough. He scrunched up his face, sighed, and pacing the balcony, Harry tried his hardest to reason with himself. He tried to appease himself with facts, focused on his and Draco’s combined experience and went over their plan not once, not twice but thrice. Despite all that, his brain refused to fall for his distractions or listen to reason.
“Took me a while to work out what bug bid you but now that I know, I can finally help you get back on track.”
He needed Harry’s touch; the softness of his fingertips, trailing along his cheekbones, teasing his lips, and the sharp line of his jaw.
Draco moved his hands from behind his back and obeyed. He kept his eyes closed, and aware that Harry had crouched down beside him, he inhaled deeply. He could smell the leathery scent of Harry’s boots, the heavy and musky smell of Harry’s arousal, and that fragrance that was so uniquely Harry, that Draco instinctively knew it would take more than a lifetime to forget what Harry smelled like. Draco’s mind struggled to supply him with the adequate vocabulary to describe the scent that presently assaulted his nostrils and abandoning the idea of coherency, Draco relished in the feel of Harry’s fingers curling into his hair.
Pushing his chair back, Harry pulled Draco into his lap and sneaked his arms around Draco’s waist, pulling his ice block of a boyfriend closer. He took Draco’s hands and squeezing them softly; Harry channelled his magic and wandlessly produced a gentle warming charm, which he directed to slowly spread through Draco’s fingers into his hands and up along his arms until it reached Draco’s core. From there, Harry let it flow through Draco in time with his heartbeat. Draco hummed, relaxed further into his embrace, and Harry welcomed him.
Charlie rolls his cobalt blue eyes at him, and Harry feels like he’s being mocked for choosing to remain single after a string of failed relationships. A small part of him tries to tell him that he’s still young and that he should actively try to find a partner, but he shuts that thought down before it has the chance to grow roots.
With Scorpius, one always had to be present, right here in the moment, prepared for anything and everything and that kept Draco’s mind balanced. Yes, Scorpius was a handful, but Draco cherished every moment he got to spend with him, every conversation, no matter how trivial it was. A discussion about what to have for lunch brought him joy for days. The happiness, Scorpius filled him with, was a strange sort of energy, one that fuelled him, drove him to continuously better himself, and on those days where work was that bit too dark, their bond kept him sane, focused and determined to get away unscathed.
Draco lowered his arms, slowly and gradually, and placing them on top of Harry’s thighs, he squeezed, digging his nails firmly into Harry’s taut muscles. Harry flexed his strong thigh muscles to assert his dominance and lowering his gaze, his eyes settled on the stunning tattoo of a wolf, curled up in a tight ball with its snout resting on the top of its bushy tail. It was completely black, and considering the natural paleness of Draco’s skin, they stood out like a beacon.
There was something about taking that step over the threshold that silenced his mind and calmed his sassy side. On the fourth floor, Draco’s only desire was to submit to Harry’s authority and being cheeky was the very last thing on his mind.
Being half-wolf-half-human most definitely gave him an advantage in pretty much all aspects of life. He saw and heard better than most people, his sense of smell was a lot more developed, and he had far more energy and strength. His shoulders were broader, his muscles more muscular, and his entire physique was solidly built. After the war, he’d made a point of exercising regularly, not only because being an Auror demanded that he kept fit but also because it brought him joy.
He wasn’t doing this for Harry or as a favour to Caleb or Stefan, no, he was doing this for himself. It was going to be a new experience, a challenge designed to test the very boundaries of his own comfort zones, and in his opinion, he couldn’t have chosen a more appropriate day to do it.
Harry felt Draco’s arms wrap themselves around him, and when Draco hugged him tight, he simply shuffled a tiny bit closer, entirely eradicating the small gap between their bodies.
The first time Draco had asked, he’d told him to write about the experience in his journal, ordering him to be as detailed as possible.
With great difficulty, Draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes and call Potter an obstinate Gryffindork.
Harry continued to edge Draco, repeatedly bringing him within seconds of exploding all over his hand only to deny him that final stroke or twist or stroke that would send him over the edge.
Amused, Harry huffs out a chuckle and ruffles her soft shoulder-length ginger hair. It curls around her small, freckled face and for a split-second, her appearance stuns Harry. She’s got Ron’s piercing blue eyes and Hermione’s beautiful smile. Right this moment, she’s frowning, and even that reminds him of his best friend, one of the smartest witches he’s ever known, and it warms his heart that his closest friends allow him to be part of their family, don’t mind him helping to raise their children. He feels blessed and loved and very, very happy.
Draco inclined his head and shuffled his feet in a manner that practically screamed anxious bag of nerves to Harry, but he refrained from pointing that out.
The chance to speak at one of Caleb’s events wasn’t one that would present itself quite so soon again, and after much deliberation, Draco had come to the conclusion that the chance to share his own story wasn’t something he wanted to miss out on.
“My sweet little boy,” she whispered, pressing a soft kiss to his forehead. “Mummy loves you very much.”
He paused his massage and without removing his hands from Draco’s shoulders, he leant forward and pressed his lips to the shell of Draco’s ear.
“Don’t you meh at me, Draco Malfoy, I am taking you home in a minute, and you’re going straight to bed. It’s Pepper-Up, bed rest, and cold leg compresses for you.”
“Is there any chance at all you might be open to taking this relationship beyond the rock-solid partnership we already have?”
He couldn’t stop staring at the floor tiles beneath Harry’s feet which put together created this huge, entirely oversized area rug. The subtle black and white stripes played with pattern and didn’t exactly annoy him, but Draco didn’t like it either. The wood tones and the clean lines of the nightstands on either side of the bed, and the dresser gave the room a strange mid-century vibe, Draco simply couldn’t get behind. He was positively terrified of allowing his mind to have an opinion on the tufted black leather daybed that came with a sculptural c-side table which offered room for a cup of coffee or a spot of not-quite-out-of-bed breakfast. Opposite the bed, a seating area with a streamlined blue velvet lounge chair and a modern totem table lamp offered a space for curling up with a good book or watching Harry sleep ― Draco couldn’t quite decide which he preferred. The room’s navy tones continued throughout, accentuated by a fibre wall hanging, a framed print, and a polka dot pillow in the centre of the bed.
He continued to tease Draco’s cock, toying with his balls, squeezing them very gently, then slipped his lube-coated index finger past them and pressed against Draco’s perineum, stroking the sensitive spot. He circled Draco’s tight and fluttering hole, applied the tiniest amount of pressure, then returned to wank Draco. He pushed him closer and closer to the edge, and when Draco, desperate to come, started begging him, Harry denied him and stopped. He gave Draco a few minutes to calm down, then added more lube and started all over again.
