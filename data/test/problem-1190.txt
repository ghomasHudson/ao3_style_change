“Draco, I…” — Harry's voice caught in his throat as he took in Draco’s appearance hungrily.
So turned on by Draco’s blowjob, he reached climax within minutes.
Pushing these feelings aside, Harry got to work. He had a Horcrux to find.
Harry joined Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and took a big gulp from the goblet in front of him.
“I’m not stupid you know,” Harry responded. “I know Voldemort gave you a mission.”
Draco knew that his time at Hogwarts was nearly up. But he swore he had to properly explain to Harry what had happened. After two failed attempts, he decided to try again at the funeral. This time, he made sure that Harry’s friends were not around.
Harry thought. There were so many things he didn’t know.
Draco thought,
Draco looked at Harry with hatred in his eyes. “I...trusted...you,” he managed to mutter before fainting. Before Harry could respond, however, Snape was on the scene. Harry went numb at the thought of what could happen to Draco, but there Snape was, fixing it, glaring at him...
Harry felt his entire body turn hot, as though engulfed in flames. Without another moment's thought, he grabbed Draco’s hand in his own and whispered, “It’s okay...It’s...okay.”
Harry gulped. He had been afraid of this. Yes, he did want to ask out Ginny, but he did not want to stop seeing Draco. Somehow, the two didn’t seem mutually exclusive to him. He liked them in such different ways, and he knew Draco would be fine with it — the prat basically
Malfoy didn’t respond. Something was wrong.
“Poor Weasel probably ate one too many of his Mummy’s cakes,” Draco mustered all of his energy to come up with a proper, Malfoy-esque response. “Don’t know what you’re looking at me for.”
Harry’s body was so familiar to Draco that the latter felt like he was reentering a maze he had gotten to know as a child.
“You...Malfoy...but...you’re...WHAT...my sister…
“FUUUUUCKK!!!”
“Not a word about this to anybody, Potter,” Draco spluttered, with the all-too-familiar hatred reinstated in his voice.
“Harry, Harry!” A young Gryffindor approached, looking impatient. Draco quickly dropped Harry’s hand and resumed his usual scowl. “Er, hi,” the Gryffindor’s eyes turned from Harry to Draco, clearly perplexed, then turned back to Harry.
This seemed to awaken Draco to his senses, who once again resumed a stone-cold expression on his face. “
Harry thought, filled with a floating feeling.
“I don’t give a bloody rat’s arse what Harry’s sexuality is!” Ron reported. “What kind of person d’you think I am?” Harry felt a rush of affection for Ron, which he noticed was shared wholeheartedly by Hermione.
, Draco thought.
Harry grabbed his dick and thought of the warmth of Draco’s hand on it, how good it felt. He concentrated his eyes on the dot that said “Draco Malfoy” standing still in the classroom Harry had just left, probably looking smug at some thing or another.
Finally, finally, Harry breathed a sigh of relief as Draco began to lower his wand.
As the days blurred into weeks, lessons carried on, both Draco and Harry continued their respective secret missions, and each had less time for the other. Soon, their encounters were down to a few times a week. Still, Draco was learning to savor his nights with Harry as the one place he could escape from — well, everything.
Draco’s memories of Harry were the only thing keeping him from not choking himself with Wormtail’s hand. He rarely masturbated anymore — how could he, with
“Your turn,” Harry grinned while diving below Draco’s legs. With his hands firmly pressing Draco down, he went in with his mouth.
Still, it was a nice mental image to hold onto. Fantasies were a welcome comfort in times like these.
Harry could only assume that Draco had to put on a show —
“Draco!” A voice pierced Draco’s ears, which were still swollen from where Harry had nibbled them.
When Snape finally let go, Draco turned around at once to look for Harry. “I know you’re there, Potter,” he yelled into the air.
, no less — then felt stupid because obviously jerking off had nothing to do with how quickly he’d defeat Voldemort. Plus, they were safe, for now.
, Harry thought.
“No…” Hermione continued carefully. “But...er...lust could. Or feelings...of the romantic sort. She was biting her lip so hard now, it might be swollen.
“No, Romilda, for the last time, I’m not saying anything. Leave me alone, please, I’ve got work to do,” Harry was losing his patience.
the second voice was persistent.
The pressure of Harry’s finger and his mouth bobbing up and down were almost too much. With one look into Harry’s piercing green eyes — full of passion and lust for him, Draco, he couldn’t take it — he felt himself release.
“Just reliving one of our recent adventures,” Draco replied with a shrug, not missing a beat. “Needed somewhere private. Can’t have too much jizz in Myrtle’s bathroom, or she’ll think it’s about her.”
Harry thought it was incredible that Ginny had not wanted to do this earlier, especially with all the gorgeous women she played Quidditch with, but he couldn’t support the idea more. It had been
He had seen
“You kept count?” Harry couldn’t help himself before regaining his composure. “No, you git. You cursed Katie Bell. What the hell was that about? I thought you changed.” His anger stopped at his throat.
…,” Harry’s back arched in pleasure.
But at the same time, he can’t pretend he didn’t also often imagine Draco beside him, especially in the depths of the night, or when he noticed something he knew Draco would like...things they could use as sex toys or simply objects for amusement, witty comebacks he knew would make Draco smirk that adorable smirk of his…
“What I don’t understand is, how can he be pining after someone else after breaking Ginny’s heart — and after
Harry could hardly believe his eyes.
Draco’s heart nearly beat out of his chest as he made eye contact with Harry — and yes, it was definitely Harry. He tried with all his might to keep it together.
Looking into Draco’s eyes, Harry understood. Voldemort was, after all, the world’s greatest Legilimens. If Draco said any more, Voldemort would know.
Knowing a lost cause when he saw one, Draco took one last look at the blazing green eyes he had come to savor and turned around. He walked away and didn’t look back.
Sitting down next to Harry, he put his hand on Harry’s leg and then removed it immediately as though daring Harry to protest.
Harry’s stomach dropped. It was Malfoy.
“Malfoy...Draco…,” his heartbeat steadied. “Tell me what you were doing here first.”
, in the flesh, real as ever. Draco looked terrified, tortured, forced to do the bidding of a master to whom he was no longer faithful.
“I didn’t realize you hadn’t told them
Harry Potter — but that doesn’t mean it didn’t still hit him like a ton of bricks.
“Er, Potter,” Draco continued awkwardly. “Could I have a word...in private?” His heartbeat quickened.
Draco, meanwhile, had taken Harry’s act of saving his life as a gesture of forgiveness. He approached Harry as soon as they had exited the Room, with a determined look on his face.
expose himself if he saw me, so he could jinx me,” he continued loudly.
“Oh, I’ll be doing more than trying,” Draco had his answer ready. With one swift motion, he unbuckled Harry’s belt and ripped off his own trousers. His groin raged at the sight of Harry in front of him — gorgeous Harry, Harry who had forgiven him — as he lubricated himself and watched the desire erupt in Harry’s eyes. He moved his dick down to where it needed to be, but took his time brushing its tip against Harry’s — as though it could’ve been an accident,
“You’re right,” said Harry. “I’ll try harder. But still, narrow escape…”
Then, as though attempting to escape the moment, Ron quickly turned to Harry and demanded, “I don’t suppose you’ve talked to Ginny about this? About...Malfoy?” His expression resumed one of distrust.
Draco felt his knees crumble and his stomach shatter. He wanted so badly to hug Harry, to kiss him, to make him realize how sorry he was, that he didn’t mean it.
“Oh you’ll get it alright,” Harry smiled, drawing Draco in for a long kiss. Not daring to bring up his plan again, he hoped the kiss would reaffirm how much trust Harry put into Draco to make the right choice.
“So who are you taking to Slughorn’s Christmas party then?” Draco asked with what he hoped would be an innocent voice, his body limp with exhaustion from their recent sexcapade.
“Ah, right.” Draco says, slipping them off and grabbing another pair from his wardrobe.
As he approaches the building, he can hear laughter and conversations floating through the cracks in the door.
“Come in, come in.” Pierre said, and the door slowly opened to reveal Harry.
Adelaide pushed Draco’s hair back before standing up and picking up Draco’s dirty clothes.
Having a crush on someone was a lot more intense than Draco had thought it would be. Or perhaps that was just him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco arrived at the shop, glad he hadn’t been lost trying to get through the deepest part of the land. The streets were always alive, with thousands of carts selling things down the roads, dozens of shops containing all that one could need and forever bustling with people. It was hard to navigate where he was going.
“Potty has got himself into another accident has he? Does he need Mummy to come kiss it better?” Parkinson muttered to Malfoy, glaring at where Harry had his back turned.
And Harry had seen him weakened. Had seen him with red puffy eyes and messy hair. That’s what angered him. He didn’t like people seeing him defenceless. He wasn’t used to it. It was a force of nature that makes him push away people who  don’t mean any harm. Who would like to know Draco as Draco, and not a Prince.
“Sorry, mate. Let’s go to the back. Bring your friend with you.” Ron smiled at Draco, his eyes searching at Draco’s hidden face.
“Draco, I don’t like the attention. In fact, I’m sure I hate it as much as you do. Well the attention focused on your personal life, not the attention focused on your demeanour.” Harry shrugged, playing with the fabric on his wrists.
“If I find a single thread out of place then you’re one dead man, Draco Malfoy.” Adelaide says with a stern glare.
The rest of the day was full of studying and short visits by Ron and Hermione, along with Parkinson who always kept her distance.
It’s far too cold to be by the seafront, so he chooses to go down the path in the forest. It could hardly be called a forest, this time of year. The trees are bare and the usual lush green bushes are brown and withering, suffering under the thin layer of ice and snow.
“Oh, no you did not.” Draco shrieks incredulously, turning to face a smug Harry.
“Celeste. That’s a pretty name. Who’s she?” Harry asks, leaning in to look at the letter.
The late October air gusts through Draco’s open window, and sends a flurry of golden leaves with it.
The castle is silent as he clicks through the halls, intent on heading to the dining hall for breakfast. The early morning sun filters through the windows, and casts beautiful rays of light across the halls, making the dark grey stone almost glow.
“Can I take a look?” Harry replied, already stepping onto the marble stairs.
When Draco woke that morning, he had been happy to find that the medicine had worked. He was even more pleased to find that Harry was still on the plush chair, snoring softly and hand lightly placed on the corner of Draco’s pillow. Draco had a random and weird urge to kiss it, to press his lips onto Harry’s work-worn knuckles, but had been diverted by Harry’s lulling consciousness.
“Harry! Are you okay? You were screaming in your sleep again,” Hermione awakened Harry with alarm in her voice.
Harry felt a surge of sympathy for his long-time enemy. How awful it would be to live his life knowing Voldemort was watching nearly every action, he couldn’t imagine.
“Still not funny, Potter…” Draco smirked as he leaned in for a long-awaited kiss.
Draco had returned to the dressing room to tell his parents that the boy downstairs was definitely not Harry when he heard a *crack*!
“I believe you,” Harry responded, “Though I might change my mind if you fuck up again. Be less stupid, won’t you? Some of us are depending on it.” He felt his mouth and dick twitch simultaneously.
Harry could not have imagined that he’d be visiting under these circumstances, when he was sure to be near his death, and yet…
“Well, she knows I was sort of seeing someone else last year, but I didn’t say who,” Harry responded, his heart sinking. He felt guilty for keeping anything from Ginny, but he and Draco had agreed not to speak of their relations. Luckily, Ginny didn’t pry. But, Harry couldn’t help feeling angry at himself still. He may even have forgotten to specify the gender…
Draco paced up and down his room as he thought through his options. He could run—but where? All his friends had parents who were Death Eaters or in league with Death Eaters, and it was much too dangerous for his parents to escape. He couldn’t leave them. He could attempt to contact Harry, but what method did he have that wouldn’t attract attention? His owl would be far too conspicuous turning up at Privet Drive. He no longer had a house elf. He could not risk using his family’s floo network.
Harry obliged, though skeptically.
“Did you run here, Harry?” Dumbledore had said during a lesson last Thursday, after a particularly steamy love-making session with Draco. “You needn’t have. A few minutes’ tardiness would be fine,” he added, his eyes twinkling with understanding.
“Draco!” Harry shouted after him. “Thank you.”
Harry snuck a glance at the Slytherin table to try and catch Draco’s eye, but to no avail.
“Sure, why not,” Draco replied. “You can wear your cloak if you don’t want to be seen with me.”
They went back the way they came, but Draco had something on his mind. He got as far as the path leading from the trees to the archway until he had to say it.
Draco shook his head, trying to clear the message out of his mind so he could avoid the problem. If he thought about it one second longer, he might actually explode of panic. But it didn’t help when Harry came slowly walking in, shirtless with a towel covering his lower half. The image was ruined by Ron and Hermione standing on either side, touching Harry where Draco should be touching. But he hadn’t told Harry that. He hadn’t told Harry he wanted to hold him forever.
When Draco looked up as he turned into the back-room, eight faces stared at him, their eyes and mouths wide in shock.
“Are you still drunk?” He asks Harry, who’s still standing around the edges of the room.
“How did you do that?” Draco asked, walking over to where Harry stood.
“Ada!” Draco calls as he sees Adelaide frantically scurrying around outside his wing of the castle. She spots him and makes her way over to where he stands in the hallway.
“We can’t be sure, and we’re going to
“Lost, Potter?” Draco said with a little tease.
Draco does what he’s told, and only opens his mouth to let out a hiss as Harry preps him. It’s tight, almost unbearably tight, but Harry is smiling at him and Draco can feel his erection pressing on the back of his thigh.
“I’m a Prince, Harry, this isn’t my job.” Draco says in exasperation.
Draco was busy. His mother had him in the solar room nearly every day, planning out what would happen when Celeste arrives, what he’d be wearing to the Christmas ball, whether or not Celeste would be staying...
“You have a future wife.”
He steps back further and makes his way back to the castle.
“Oh, Draco. Come here.” Adelaide softly says, her arms reaching out.
“Sir Potter is looking for you.” Adelaide quietly says, picking up Draco’s abandoned shoes from the floor.
“Yeah, don’t know how though. I can’t even stand up without my whole body hurting. And also I’ll need a long shower. A very long one.” Harry laughed.
“Thunder.” He says lightly, before falling asleep.
Harry’s breath caught and his heart leaped, but after a second of gazing he stopped and carried on with his work. How can Draco make him feel that way?
Draco groaned into his pillow. He absolutely dreaded having his portrait done. He’s had to have one every year of his life for as long as he remembers, and he still wasn’t used to the numbing pain of sitting on a wooden stool for hours.
Harry catches Draco’s eye and smirks. He takes in Draco’s position and seems to come
“I’m not risking my job, Draco. And I don’t want your execution to be my fault. Alright, the blacksmiths is just over there. Follow after me and act- normal. Well as normal as possible.”
“You can watch Sir Potter fight. That’s got to be some sort of entertainment!” She tries optimistically and it snaps Draco out of his thoughts. “You’ve never seen him fight before, have you? It’ll be amazing! Harry Potter fighting in your castle!”
A sharp intake of breath.
“Yeah.” Draco replies, still dazed. “What time is it?”
‘Dear Celeste,’ He writes.
“We?” Harry smiled.
“Could I have the sword?” Draco said, after Ron kept on staring.
“I will.” He mumbles, picking at a loose thread in his sleeve.
What happened? What changed? Draco hadn’t said anything bad about his sexuality. Why was he being so horrible?
“It isn’t a story, Potter. We’ve known each other for years, she moved away, we kept in contact.”
He walks his way up to him, his chin held up high.
It most likely is a book, and Draco tears into it, finding a deep jade green tome with silver lettering on the front. He doesn’t realise it says his name until he looks again.
“No, no I didn’t mean it in that way. You two seem pretty inseparable.”
“What are you talking about?” Draco asks, trying to include himself in the conversation for his own sanity.
Harry woke up four hours later, hungry for food. As he cracked open his eyes and began to sit up, he heard a whining noise coming from just outside the infirmary. Ignoring it, Harry grabbed his glasses and took a dose of his medication so that his ribs could heal without becoming completely deformed.
“This better be worth it.” Draco mutters under his breath. He re-adjusts his clothing and makes his way out of the castle.
Draco had recognised Romeo from Adelaide’s constant fangirling over Harry, which was very common in the land amongst the women. Adelaide would talk non-stop about Harry Potter this and Harry Potter that, and it drove Draco mad. He almost felt quite jealous too, that Sir Harry could go on adventures and have fun, without having to worry about what the public might think. He didn’t have to worry about Lucius being outraged with him. No one had to deal with that, apart from Draco.
He pauses as he watches Harry rake his eyes over Draco’s bare back.
Harry swallowed and shook his head. If Draco was going to act like a git, so was he.
“Oh calm down...Draco’s actually alright.” He says, giving everyone a reassuring smile and squeezing him tighter. Draco can only nod, still very apprehensive. The things he does for this man...
She grimaces, and the worry in her eyes is clear in the bright morning light. “You’re mother and father visited, and they’re trying to find you the medicine as quick as possible. The only problem is that the closest apothecary with what you need is in the next land.”
Draco sighs deeply, pushing his papers to the floor. “Sorry...stupid Celeste thing.”
“I don’t love Celeste anymore. I- I don’t want to marry her.” He grinds out, breath heavy with sorrow.
As you can tell I have not posted a new chapter in a while. I’ve had a couple comments asking to carry on writing and I think i’m finally out of my writing slump so i will be updating soon!!!!!
It hurts him to come to the realisation that it’d never work, not with Draco being who he is.
“Nice try, but you forget I’m stronger.” He says proudly.
“Boyfriends.” Draco affirmed. His breath hitched in his throat, but he knew he had to say it. “Maybe I am gay. Just a little. Only for you.”
The sun is slowly setting as Draco leaves the castle, covered by a black cloak. He hides in small alcoves as Knights pass by and ducks under stairways as the maids head off to bed.
“No, sorry Professor.” Harry dropped his head. Why was Draco ignoring him. Why had he moved from his bed?
“I guess we can share Adelaide as our honorary Mother.” Draco laughed faintly, trying to ease the tension in the room. It wasn’t bad tension, though. It felt sort of like a peaceful silence.
“There’s just been a lot to think about recently. It’s all been a bit much. And now what you’ve just said?”
“Oh, okay.”
Life is getting very busy (school started again and i have a job!) so posting may not be consistent which i apologise for. I love this story and i wrote it knowing one day it’ll be finished. There’s still a lot to go with the story, I have some twists and turns planned so be prepared 😌
“Yeah, says Mr Potions Master.” Harry grunted at Draco.
“Okay.” He says bluntly. How could he be so stupid? Spending time having liked Harry so much only to give up. What kind of man was he?
“Yeah, it was going around town. I tried to imagine how I would feel. I remember thinking just how happy you would have been.”
“Wonderful, Ada.” Draco says, stacking up his parchment.
“Now, Draco, get Adelaide to- actually, while you’re here, show Sir Harry to the master bedroom in the bed chambers and then have Adelaide give him a tour of the castle.” Narcissa says sharply, her eyes piercing through Draco’s.
“Is Ron in? I’m here to pick up a sword.”
Harry diverted his eyes as he realised that he was staring at Draco, watching as his delicate pale fingers slid across the worn pages of the book.
Draco chuckled to himself, picking up one letter and peeling off the wax seal. When he glanced back up a few moments later, Harry was still watching him, his mouth wide open.
“Yes, yeah.” He softly says, moving back from the door.
“Ah, Sir Potter!” Pierre said, before Harry could even start to form a sentence.
“It’s beautiful.” Draco murmured.
“Well then we’d better go inside.”
“Aren’t you going to, you know, take out a bunch of them. It’s only thirty gold pieces for a sword. Forty-five more for gems.”
“What you said is true, right?” He asks, and Draco wants to laugh.
Draco just rolled his eyes. Adelaide waited for his answer.
Ron smiled at that but still looked as though he thought Harry would shatter to a million pieces if he moved again. “Look mate, I’ve got class. I’ll bring you all of your books and essay papers up at the end of the day. Hermione and I will see you later, yeah?”
They both circled the pitch, searching for the small golden snitch so that they can shoot up towards it. He looked at Ron from the other side of the pitch and laughed as he was waving his head around everywhere, trying to spot the shiny ball. Harry lowered his head to try and stop himself from laughing, and turned so that he could have a different view of the pitch.
“Oh, no Lucius-“
Draco decides to help the useless sod out.
Harry stared into Draco’s face for a couple of seconds, something on the tip of his tongue, but his face dropped and he shrugged with a smile. “Nothing. Everything. Romeo sure likes the stables.”
“My hip.” He inhaled sharply. “Bloody bastard slashed it with his sword, it broke through my chainmail and everything. It started to seize up but I though it would be fine.” He breathed out.
“Do you- Do you have a problem with it?” Harry softly asked.
“Come on, Adelaide, you know it’s a stupid idea. I’ll just have to get over it, there’s no way around it.”
Draco tilted his head back, releasing a heavy exhalation. The wind whipped around his body and Draco felt like he could escape everything if he just kept on riding. Just delved further and further into the compelling silver light of the moon. Into the growing waves. Into the ocean where everything was quiet and desolate.
“Shhhhh” He says, rubbing small circles on his cheekbones with his thumb. Harry tries to laugh, but with all his shaking it comes out as a squeak.
Dumbledore had begun saying when the first challenge was, but the goblet had turned red and spat flames everywhere. Harry didn’t know what’s going on. His friends were asking around to find an answer.
“Ah.” Draco nods. Finding this out about Harry has changed something inside himself.
It’s all happening...
“Of course I know it, Pansy plays it all the time. I’m sick of it.” Draco rolled his eyes, his attention being taken by Harry’s bright green eyes.
“Sir Potter.” Draco nods after a seconds hesitation, still oddly baffled at Harry’s presence. Although Harry was very popular in the Kingdom, Draco had never formally met him. He only became a Knight recently, but his popularity grew quickly. But Draco was going to try all he could to be a proper prince, because Harry Potter was in his castle.
“I know, I know. Breathe with me.” He says, doing what Adelaide normally does when Draco’s finds himself not able to breathe while crying.
“What are you doing out here?” Harry asks, and Draco notes that he sounds different from usual.
Harry doesn’t ask any further questions, and Draco’s glad. He scratches away on his paper, writing nonsense that will please Celeste. His happy mood has left him, and he sweeps his hand frustratingly through his loose hair. The wind whips it back, and he yanks at it to move if again.
Draco wasn’t strange. His feelings weren’t strange.
Draco didn’t even know what he was going to do once he arrived, but seeing Harry has put some sort of semblance in his head.
“Ah, you’re here.” She passes the garbs over to Draco. “Get in these and then I’ll do your hair.”
Draco can’t hold the gaze for long, and turns his head to the water. He can feel Harry’s eyes on him.
“To the swordsmith? You’ll be fine on your own Harry, you’re a grown adult.”
The grand doors to the ballroom loom over him, and Draco spares them a wary glance before he’s pulled through them.
“No distractions.” Harry says, tilting his head back to break the kiss. He holds Draco as if he weighs nothing, and it’s a bit romantic but it also makes him feel like a damsel in distress.
“Oh come on, you can’t just call it ‘a lake’.”
“Is Harry with you?” He asked, standing up from the desk.
“I have to go, promise me you’ll be okay?”
Draco pushes back from the garden table and carefully takes off his tunic, resting it on the back of his chair.
“We’ll be back later.” Hermione smiled and left with Ron.
“What?” Harry asks, befuddled.
Harry’s love is encompassing, a constant in Draco’s life of misfortune. The road ahead is uncertain, he can’t even begin to think about his future. The trips to Celeste’s castle, the wedding.
Draco wished being a Prince was a job. And if it were, he’d quit on the spot.
Draco quickly shook Pierre’s hand and followed after Harry into the gallery.
“I got you something, by the way.” He says through the silence, reaching down and grabbing a brown package.
He looks in the mirror leant up against a wall and twists and turns to see the entirety of it. Over a frilly dress shirt with lantern sleeve and a far too bushy jabot, is the dreaded buckled waistcoat. The dark green, tight fabric ends at his waist, where the band of his breeches start. The ends are gathered at his calfs, tucked in long black leather boots that are also adorned with frills. As if to compensate for the buckles, Sebastian has hand-made a cape. He’s never actually worn one before, due to the fact his father never insists on it. But Draco is the one to be noticed on the night of the ball, so the light green fabric, clasped together by three silver chains, is sure to make him stand out.
He doesn’t even notice the figure in the sea until he reaches his normal perching area, a fallen tree.
“Well, I don’t think she’s let her status as a royal change her as a person. I thought she’d be a lot more stern.”
“Draco, there’s a letter here for you.” Adelaide presents it to Draco at his breakfast table. He sits outside, breathing in the warm late August air. The beating sun reflects on his silver embellished tunic and turns his porcelain skin a beautiful golden shade. The castle grounds are serene and quiet, the only sound the clanking of the Guard Knights armour and the sound of Adelaide, Draco’s maid, cutting up a loaf of crunchy rye bread.
He was taking him in hungrily, his eyes focusing on Draco’s lips, his chest, his neck.
“Oi Malfoy! What are you looking at?” Ron started, anger rising in him.
“Maybe... but those were certainly the days.” She giggles, and then her eyes lock onto his.
Harry releases a heavy sigh and smiles faintly. “You should have said.” He places his arm around Draco’s waist.
There’s a blanket of silence, and Draco’s heart drops. Well, what had he’d expected? It wasn’t like he wanted to be friends with them all anyway...
Not until Harry had arrived.
Harry is laughing into Draco’s shoulder, squeezing his hips tightly.
Better to have something that he’s got than to not have anything at all.
“I’ll teach you. It’s not too difficult.” Harry said, smiling with that smile again.
That was a stupid question, he tells himself. He’s inexperienced, sure, but it’s not like he doesn’t want it.
“I have to go.” He says, half-sprinting up the stairs.
Draco looks into his eyes.
“I have too many responsibilities to be caring about this, but it’s all I can think about, Ada. What’s wrong with me?” He cries.
“It’s a hug, Harry. Don’t worry.”
‘Well’ is certainly an understatement.
December 19th, one day before the ball:
“Hi, Harry.” Hermione sighed in concern. “How are you?” She said, lowering her gaze from where the two Slytherins were.
“Thanks. I’ll see you later.” And with that, he turned to go to his study. His heart was beating, his head was sweaty and he could quite literally eat a horse.
“Prince Draco.” Harry says, bowing. Draco stands in silent shock at Harry’s professionalism towards him, something Draco didn’t think Harry had. He was a charmer, Draco thought. He isn’t really like this.
It was addressed to Harry, but it had taken Draco’s interest. He turned the envelope around to find that the letter was sent by Sirius Black. He gasped quietly at the name, but he was more concerned as to why Sirius was sending Harry a letter.
“Is this all you do in the dance?” Harry sighs, getting to grips with his steps.
Draco visibly sags, relief flooding him. He was very glad that this was what Harry was worrying over, and not the fact that Harry had somehow found out Draco’s interest in him and was appalled by it.
“Scared?” Draco replies, pressing more. It was nowhere near being dangerous, he was certain. He couldn’t hurt Harry even if he tried.
I know I always say that I’m going to stop writing so fast, but I just n e e d e d to get this chapter out.
Draco looks around him, but the stables are empty apart from himself and the 4 other horses. Draco pulls Juliet into her stable, keeping a watchful eye on Romeo. He couldn’t believe it.
They finished their meal in relative silence, Lucius informing Harry about the tournament because Draco hasn’t bothered to do it himself.
Dumbledore picked the third and final name.
Harry balked.
“Well maybe you should think about what you do, BEFORE YOU DO IT!” Harry cried again, his anger slowly starting to become sadness.
“Ah, Malfoy, my boy.” Pierre said, even though Draco’s known him all his life and there wasn’t a need for the use of last names. Draco had just concluded that Pierre was like that, eccentric and charmingly odd.
“How is your hip, by the way?” Hermione asked.
“Merlin, Harry. Death isn’t exactly fun.”
Harry froze for a second, but knew that Draco was wondering, not teasing.
“I do. But now I think he’s given me motivation to fight for what I believe in and to do things that make me happy even though other people may not like it. I think he wouldn’t want me to be sad about his death, and now I guess I look back on our time together with happy nostalgia. It was so hard losing a friend so close. I tried to stop the battle before they could get to him, but I was stabbed in the hip, and then tha-“
“Yeah, alright.” He concedes, giving Harry a detailed description of the directions to a secret alcohol store near the kitchens. Harry nods, giving Draco’s shoulder a squeeze. Even after he withdraws, Draco can feel the ghost of his hand.
He’d like to stay up and look at Harry for a bit, but his eyes are drooping slightly and his body’s already halfway asleep. He tries to say something to Harry but it just comes out in sleepy mumbles.
He looks Draco up and down, a small
“It’s alright, Ron. And I am trying my hardest not to be my Father.”
Once he’s come down from the high, he looks at the pitiful state of Harry, his hair even more mussed up than normal and body shiny with sweat and Draco’s release.
The tight heat feels fantastic, and he arches and grips his legs tighter around Harry, silently begging for more. Harry understands, and pounds into him, somehow rough and loving at the same time. Draco doesn’t mind.
“I got your sword.” He said, and Harry snapped his head up.
He turned to find Hermione and Ron sitting still, baffled expressions on their faces. It was one thing to have Draco Malfoy in their presence, but it was another for Harry to actually get along with him.
“What’s its name?” Harry asked, waking closer to the shore.
“You always have little spots, don’t you?” Harry asks, watching as Draco settles himself and crosses one leg over the other.
“That was close.” Harry laughed, clapping Draco on the shoulder in relief.
“Maybe but I...” He coughs again. “I think it was...” Another cough. “Harry pushed me into the water.” He finally wheezes out.
Where did he go wrong?
“Draco!” Adelaide shouts from the other side of the door. He grunts into his pillow and she takes that as an invitation to come in.
It only reminds him further that this is really the start for him and Celeste. That it’s not all
“Sorry I’ve been so busy.” Draco mumbles to Harry as they both climb onto the bed. “I’ve missed...uh...” He looks at where his hands are threaded into Harry’s hair, “This.”
“About the tournament, how are Hermione and I getting in?”
“Yes, I am.” Harry shrugged.
“That, whenever you see a pink sky, know that you’ve survived just that little bit longer. And then you see it, again and again and again. And you know that there’s something worth fighting for.” She says, turning towards Draco and squeezing his elbow with a delicate hand.
“Will you shut up about bloody Sir Potter!” Draco snaps, turning his head away from the terrified woman that stands at the end of his bed.
Draco nods, understanding.
And it’s as if whoever is up there had heard him, because when he turns down to the east of the castle, Harry is there. The licking flames draw him in.
“You know what I mean.” He shoves Draco playfully, chuckling into his neck. His breath flutters against Draco’s collarbone and Draco shivers.
“I’m actually pretty nervous.” Harry replied, fiddling with the sword.
“Are you ill?” Adelaide says suddenly, her confusion turned into worry instantly.
“Me? No...” He grins, and something at the bottom of Draco’s stomach flutters with excitement.
“Are you seeing him then?”
“I suppose you can proof read it for me...”
“They’re not finding out. I’m not doing anything about this.”
“Harry...” He growls under his breath, scowling at the man in question. At the other knight’s faces, Harry gives a wide grin and throws an arm around Draco’s shoulders playfully.
“I needed to know what to expect. I didn’t think this room would be so big.”
“Mother.” Draco drawls, picking up his own cup of tea.
Harry sat, staring at the fire. He rubbed at his messy ink black hair and twisted his mouth in thought.
“What’s so funny?” He asks, but begins to chuckle slightly.
“She’s lovely.” Harry smiles sincerely.
“Don’t have high expectations.” Draco drawled, because it was actually very boring. Draco would rather write a million meaningless letters to Celeste than have to spectate people dressed in metal playing with metal.
“I’d much rather keep my head.”
Adelaide visibly reclines, searching Draco’s face for any hint of the whole admittance being a joke.
Draco sluggishly stands up, carefully removing the cape. He delicately hands it over and heads to his room, pulling out a tunic and breeches, and also forgetting to close the door.
“But-“
Maybe one day it will be. Admittedly, he would have to own it alongside Celeste, but if Harry continued to work for the royals than he really wouldn’t mind at all. He smirks at the thought of having a door connected between both his and Harry’s rooms, and telling Celeste that he’s ‘just going to the loo’ but really sneaking off to have risky but thrilling escapades with the person he truly wanted to be with.
“Sir Harry Potter here is going to be our new head Guard Knight.” Lucius booms, clapping Harry on the shoulder. “He got an injury during battle and so they moved him over to here. He’ll be staying in the bed chambers along with some other Knights.” Lucius smiles, shooting a weary eye at Draco. “I hope we can show some hospitality to him.” He says slyly, raising a cautious blonde eyebrow.
will beat you in cards.” He addresses to the rest of the room. They all raise their eyebrows, but seem to take on the challenge. Draco supposes he’s pretty good, Adelaide had taught him everything he knows, and she’s great with games. He’s always won against Harry, too.
What will happen now? 😏🤫
“Only stating what is true.” Draco replied, his face blank.
“No, mate.” Harry shouted back, diverting his gaze back to the rest of the green field. He sighed and lifted his head, and spotted a flickering gold light coming from above. Either Harry could go get the snitch and let Draco leave, or he could fly down and try and talk about what he was feeling.
He pulls the sheets up to his chin, shuddering in the cold of his room. But Adelaide has lit a fire, so he shouldn’t be cold. Draco shakes the thought out and tries to get to sleep.
“Then do what I do, sit still and look pretty.” Draco huffed, a small smile sitting on the corner of his mouth.
“See you tomorrow?” Harry asks hopefully.
“No, no it’s fine. Don’t turn it off. I couldn’t sleep anyway.” Draco muttered, moving his pillow so that we was hugging it.
He wakes up satisfied that morning, even though he ended up getting not many hours of sleep.
They head to the stables, Harry pretending to be Draco’s ‘escort’ and dramatically bowing at everyone they passed.
“That’s alright, just do it the old-fashioned way.” He winks, and because he’s an established heathen, he moves his hand from where it was resting next to Draco and pulls it up to his mouth, spitting on it.
“I can’t stop...shaking.” He says, shuddering as though he’d been doused with ice cold water.
Harry’s eyes are impossibly bright in such a way that Draco can’t help but be completely and utterly in love with him.
“So what are you allowed to do?”
“Yeah,” He says, finally looking at Draco, “Sorry.”
He shakes his head, as though trying to clear out any thoughts that are at the forefront of his mind.
where they’re pressed into the snow, but he doesn’t really feel it.
“Ah- I wouldn’t-“ Draco’s says, rushing to sit next to Harry to try and pry it out of his hands. He has no hope, aside from the fact that Harry was five times stronger than him, he’s already absorbed in the story.
“You look so handsome, Draco.” She says into his ear as he lifts her up.
Arthur glances back at him a couple of times on their way to the room, and then quickly diverts his attention back to harry, shooting him a wary look.
Harry stared, piercing his green eyes into grey ones. He took a deep breath and saw that Draco wasn’t pleading for him to come talk to him. Wasn’t showing that anything that had happened between them meant something.
“Don’t apologise,” Harry smiles, his eyes crinkling in the corners “But you need a break, it’s not going to help if you work yourself up about it.” He offers. Then he stands, pulling Draco off from his seat and making him follow. Harry stands at the waters edge, face turned into the wind. Draco steps next to him, his arms folded over himself.
Fuck.
The rest of the week was the same. Harry tried and tried, but he gave up. Draco hadn’t said a word to Harry since they left the hospital wing.
“Even when I think I know the castle, and your secret spots, there’s always something new.” Harry says, awed. His breath is visible in the cold air, the white plumes obscuring the view of his face.
“Are you- reading a book?” Draco said from where he lay, watching Harry as he concentrated on the ivory pages.
His Christmas’ have never been like this. It’s always been stoic conversation and muted lights, no crackling fireplaces or games.
“I think this is one of the only things I’ve ever been completely sure about, Ada.”
Draco wondered what Adelaide thought about his most recent revelation.
Draco opens his mouth so say something back, to indicate his confusion, but he finds he’s stuck. Oh god, what was Harry up to?
“Thank you.” Harry said, and hugged him.
The beach was much like the lake. Draco could find peace without being disturbed. But Draco liked to run around on Juliet. He liked to feel the wind whipping through his hair. He liked to feel something.
“Harry, you seen something?” Ron shouted from across the pitch.
“You’re not taking part, then?” Ron said, turning to face him.
He’s watching Harry’s gentle face when the rooms suddenly turns dim, the last bits of the autumn sunshine slipping away. The room fades to a dull grey, and Draco can’t help the thrill of excitement at the thought of a storm later this evening.
Draco doesn’t like it, but his neck starts to flush.
But Harry was great at fighting and never seemed to give up, so Draco is left to pray to whoever is listening that the man Harry is up against just really wants to win.
“You just have to be patient, Draco. I know what your going through, and even though I don’t completely understand, I do want what is best for you. You may not tell me everything, but I know you, Draco. I have known you for years. And don’t think for one second that I will judge you, or criticise you, or tell you what to do to. I know that you have enough of that already. One day, things will be different, and you won’t have to listen to your Father anymore. You may still have to be married to Celeste, but it’s not like you two are strangers.” Adelaide stopped, catching her breath, and then moved to sit on thenext to Draco. “Everything will be fine when the time comes. Your Father cannot control your life forever.”
“Oh, but I did.” He grins, before slowly running backwards as Draco’s face turns from shocked to murderous. Draco piles a large ball of snow in his gloved hands and runs straight after Harry, slightly slipping on the ice that had settled over the rocks.
Draco sat alone in the hospital, trying to think of a way that he can tell Harry that he wanted to hold him. Wanted to kiss him.
The tournament was all that everyone could talk about. Lucius had made the  announcement earlier that morning and now everyone was getting prepared for the next day. Everyone was excited. Everyone apart from Draco.
“My hip...it’s seized up.” He murmurs, cursing again as Draco moves to get a better look at him.
“You can’t tell me what to do! I didn’t mean it!” Draco tutted out of his mouth.
of warmth that the early september sun was giving him. He could feel the presence of Harry’s hands at the grips on the saddle, and nearly made them slip when he remembered what he was doing, distracted by the thought that if Harry had just leant a tiny bit forward, or Draco moved a tiny bit back, Harry’s knuckles would be pressing into his hips. Draco quickly snapped out of that idea, completely confused about where it had developed and questioning why he would ever want Harry to be touching him.
“He helped me work out that I was interested in men as well as women.”
Immediately after Draco realised his feelings for the other man, he shut down. It wouldn’t help if he could make his life more of a mess if he were to actually give this idea a thought. Draco worried that if he started thinking about Harry, he might not be able to stop. And Draco really can’t let his attention slip, not when the pressure from his parents is at an all time high because of the dreaded winter ball in less than two months.
Draco realises that what they’re missing now is adrenaline. They’d been running on it all of yesterday, the wild energy of showing their hidden skeletons. But now, neither of them knew where they lay.
A few more games play until Harry’s name is announced, and he whole crowd seems to shuffle onto the edge of their seats. Harry walks into the arena, new sword and  bulky shield in tow. Harry’s competitor is announced, and Draco can feel his face grow pale. They’ve put Harry with a brute, who is at least three times Harry’s size and who’s face is turning red with anger. Draco remembers when Harry said that people would still be mad and try to hurt him, and he can’t help but think this is a bad idea. The other man almost looks like a bull, his dark brown hair sticking in clumps over his sweaty face. It was the last match of the tournament, so it was going to have to be the greatest. There is no doubt that someone had purposefully chosen this line-up so that Harry would be in a position of vulnerability. But Draco couldn’t just stop the match because he was concerned for Harry’s safety. He’s sure the Kingdom would dislike him more if he did that. But Lucius is intently watching him, and if Draco even tried to attempt getting out of the box and down to the arena, Lucius would just grab him by the back of his collar and plant him firmly in place.
Draco looks to the others, lifting his eyebrow in a way that indicates he so obviously is.
“But Adelaide, surely you can just pretend to be me and sit in our box.” Draco said, following Adelaide as she watered the extensive gardens. The weather was getting colder as it edged on into late September, and Adelaide was sure she could keep the red roses alive through the chill.
(See the end of the chapter for
He tried looking around but the room was still dark, and his vision was still blurred after his accident and the lack of his glasses. He immediately put them on and and grabbed his wand, before he realised that Draco was sitting cross legged on the other bed, glaring at Harry.
Harry stood in awe immediately as he set foot on the ground. It wasn’t the biggest spectacle in the world, Draco thought, but there was something in the way that Harry was looking at it, with the sun glinting off the surface and onto his face, that made him see it through new eyes, and fell in love with the area all over again.
him on the pew.
“You’re rotten.” Harry scowls and walks away, putting on his helmet and nodding to Arthur.
“Hey.” Harry says in mock-hurt. He pulls Draco closer from one of the buckles on the jacket, and sweeps his hand over Draco’s cheek. “You look like a prince.”
“He does?”
“Draco...” Harry starts, but Draco can’t let him— won’t let him— say any more. It might hurt too much.
The weight of the water pushed down on his chest. He slipped calmly under the water, before hearing a clatter at the door, making him shoot up.
“What?”
“Yep.”
“Tea?” The woman offered, and Draco shook his head. Drinking tea from a place that looked like this might just ensure certain death.
“No.” Harry said, his dark bushy eyebrows furrowing.
“Guess it’s fine if I mess it up again.” Harry says, using this as a way to card his fingers through Draco’s almost-too-long hair. He overdoes things, as always, and Draco looks absolutely bedraggled when Harry leans back.
“He likes men, too.” Draco says, considering.
“Your father has called on an early mass, as an apology for cancelling it last night.”
Harry parts Draco’s legs, spreading them wide and hooking his knees on his lower back. They’re doing this, then.
Harry peeked his head around Ron’s leg to find Draco raising his chin, fear not showing in his face.
“Well I just wanted to know more about you.” Harry said in honesty.
“How did you even know you were going to be in here today?” Harry smirks. Draco scowls. “You sly bastard.”
“I’ll come back later.” Harry replies, confused at Draco’s anger.
“A potions accident caused you to have 9 broken bones?” Harry questioned, amusing himself.
“You were trying to-“ Draco started but stopped. He breathed in and decided that it wasn’t worth his time. “Something happened and I took it out on you for no reason.” Draco sighed.
Draco stared blankly for a second, caught off guard by Celeste’s name. The woman he was meant to love.
Harry doesn’t reply, all that was coming out of his mouth was faint and whispered ‘no,no,no,no’s. Draco watches as Harry turns around and flashes a bright grin, making Draco’s heart falter and his body freeze. Harry’s smile drops as Draco stands still, and Draco knows he has to seize the moment.
“He’ll have it.” He says, shoving it into Draco’s hands, which doesn’t turn out very well seeing as he’s holding a large stack of cards. They fall to the table and Draco realises he’s lost; they can all see his cards.
Harry had rolled his eyes, and soon after set out for his shift.
Harry inhales, nods. “It was really difficult to get over, but I guess from a young age I was taught that people died everyday and that I should learn to tolerate it.”
“Who wants to play first?” Draco says boldly, his proudness surfacing. He takes the cards offered to him and shuffles them fancily, almost as if he were putting on a performance. He snaps the cards in to place and looks up,
“Yes, nice light today, sit up.” Pierre said, his words clipped. Draco shuffled back onto the seat, straightening his back and smoothing down the strands that had escaped from his floppy hair.
Looking at his food, he grimaced. He heard a faint laugh coming from the right of him and he looked up to see Malfoy watching him. The smile completely changed his face, it made him look as though he wasn’t about to go and commit murder. It left dimples on both sides of his face, but they quickly went away as soon as Malfoy saw Harry staring at them.
He stands on his tip-toes, and through the window, he can see the beautiful display of warmth from a happy family.
Draco felt a surge of rage claw at his insides. Harry was having fun, swaying around half-inebriated and giddy, but somewhere inside Draco hurt at the knowledge that this was only happening because Harry was drunk.
“Did you want something fancy, then? The ‘shop has been quiet recently so we have more time on our hands. And Mum and Dad are spending more time at home so we have more space to work with.” Ron said to Harry.
“I could treat you right.” He repeats, edging closer to the bed. His knees almost touch the frame. “I’m tired of waiting around.” His hand reaches out to touch Draco’s cheek.
“Sorry for what?” Draco replies, but he already knows the answer to that question. His heart pangs. He should be the sorry one here.
At this time he’d ask Harry to come to his room, like he’d been doing for the past four days, but Harry has a job and a responsibility. He’s probably being heroic and fearless, the bastard. Draco’s not worried, though. Harry’s capable of conquering whatever comes his way.
“Oh- sorry.” Harry picked up his wand and was about to spell it off but Draco interrupted.
“Harry, what is it?” Draco says faintly as he stands up to move towards the door. Harry stays upright for a split second before falling into Draco’s chest.
Draco is full from the dinner, where nothing eventful happened apart from his father boasting to Celeste and her father.
Harry did want to go to Dumbledore about Draco. But not for the reason anyone else, apart from Harry and Draco, would expect it to be.
Draco was curled up on his leather sofa, fingering through a new book that Adelaide had bought him.
“I think I’ve broken my back.” He replied, the back in question clicking far too loudly.
“You’re a bad influence.” Draco crossed his arms over his chest.
Harry didn’t know what to expect. Draco was the second person who knew so Harry hadn’t had any experience in knowing how people treated him after finding out.
“It was your fault.” Draco groaned.
“Shut up.” Harry says, with finality, and keeps his eye contact with Draco as he places his wet fingers on Draco’s opening.
After a couple of minutes of short jabs and looping movements, Draco is able to work out that the man isn’t just aiming anywhere in hopes that it will knock Harry to his feet, but he is actually going directly for Harry’s right hip. The one that is damaged. No one else seems to notice, even Lucius, who is watching jovially and clapping at each strike of a sword.
And instead of Harry dancing with him, he has a maiden by his side, one that Draco’s only just noticed.
“Reconsidering?” Harry asks as a joke, but there’s something hesitant behind it.
He looks over at Harry, and finds him trying to stifle his laughter.
Things could be completely different by then, a random twist of fate. He smiles at the idea of him and Harry living a happy life somewhere far away, but it’s completely ridiculous. Nothing could change the inevitable. He’s certain of that.
Draco circles the castle, the clink of the hooves reverberating off the stone walls.
Draco drifts the toe of his boot through the water, and Harry notices. Then Harry catches his eye, and there’s a mischievous glint to the green.
Later that day when the sun began to set, Harry followed Ron out to the Quidditch grounds. They try and do as many practical turns and tricks as possible but it always ends up with them playing a one on one seeker game. With Harry being the obvious winner.
“Does now.” Harry grins mischievously.
Leave it fifteen minutes, he says to himself resolutely.
in all the ways that matter.
Harry’s mouth envelops his, his body pressed flushed against Draco’s, rocking forwards and backwards teasingly.
The kiss was rough but passionate, fast but also so immensely slow, making the hairs at the back of Harry’s head stand up. It was pure bliss, feeling Draco’s soft lips against his own chapped ones. But he wouldn’t have it any other way. That was what he wanted to tell Draco. And he had done it.
And they do, cuddled on the couch in front of the library hearth, Draco’s head resting on Harry’s chest. It feels like all too much and not enough at the same time.
Draco walks further into the centre of the castle, past the many bed chambers, large sitting rooms, the castles ballroom, the kitchens, the storerooms, out and around into the large courtyard and then back in and finds himself stopping at the large windows at the front of the castle and looking at the grounds below. He stood for a while, taking in the scent of burning wood from a sconce nearby and then made his way to the solar room, where his mother and father were.
Draco feels on the verge of tears. He’s only adding fuel to the fire. He can’t help it, though. He undeniably feels something for Harry.
“Yes, he did. But he suffered an injury and couldn’t carry on the same, and then he started working for us.”
“Shit.” Harry says suddenly, stopping abruptly. Draco lifts his head to meet is eye, and Harry is grimacing and clenching his jaw.
letting go when his father announces that the winter ball is coming to a close and that they’ll play the final song.
Harry read a couple chapters, but was distracted at Draco’s soft breathing as he lay there. Harry closed the book and looked up at the ceiling too. He wanted to see what Draco was looking at, but saw nothing apart from worn bricks. He then realised that Draco was probably lost in thought, and wasn’t too focused on the old pieces of rock.
“Celeste is here in ten minutes!” Adelaide calls. “I hope you liked my present!” She adds, and clicks down the hallway.
When Harry sees him, he doesn’t smile.
“Figures.” He nods.
The next morning, Draco takes a quill and a fresh piece of parchment from his study and makes his way to the lake. Before he left, he dashed to his library to get a book and found Harry sat on Draco’s leather sofa where, curled up with a book in his lap that Draco was halfway through reading.
“It’s definitely...stylish?” Harry offers, smirking.
Draco stood up from his stand and ran off, out of the hall. Harry looked from Dumbledore to a running Draco. He stood up, feeling judged by the eyes and ran out after Draco.
“Not until a bit.” Harry smirked. He bent down to pick another flat stone off the floor, passing it to Draco. “You try.”
“I’d like to call it ‘Lake James’.”
“Where’d you want to go?” Harry asks, standing close behind Draco and looking around at the space.
He smiled as he wrote paragraphs on paragraphs about his life and how he was doing. He didn’t mention his accident or how he was in the hospital with Draco but thought it would be better to leave it out.
“Afternoon?” He says, panicked.
The morning is wet and dreary, and the colour that had once inhabited the castle has faded, allowing the near-winter drabness to settle in.
“Oh come on, Draco. How can I not? And you really would hate it if you had to watch him fight? Would it be so horrible?” She said, teasing him.
“It’s all glitz and glam, the whole puffy dresses and ridiculous chandeliers thing. I’ve never cared for it much myself, but to others it’s practically their whole world. A lifestyle.”
“Of course I didn’t, Draco.” Harry rolled his eyes sardonically.
“Oh.” He pauses. “Is he okay?” Harry whispers, and this catches Draco’s attention.
“Yeah, the year when-“
“It’s just...” Harry starts, takes a deep breath and carries on “God, it always leads back to that night, doesn’t it?”
He’s standing in one of the castles many rooms, adorned with the usual gold-edged furniture. He thinks it might be the spare parlour, if the misused atmosphere and stale air was anything to go by.
“Just tell him your hips seizing up and pray that he will let you off.” Draco shrugs, wishing he could be more help.
‘Dearest Celeste. With the changing seasons I come to realise that our meeting is soon to happen. Here at the castle it has been very busy, due to all the preparations going on. My mother and father are very excited, but I think I hold that feeling most of all. You see, my dear, this is the start of something for the both of us. A first fallen domino to when we finally wed. Although your name is not Harry Potter and you are not a man and you could only wish you were as half as hot as him...’
“Do you want me to stop?” Harry asks, his face growing disappointed, deepening when he looks back down to Draco’s cock.
“Oh, okay.” Harry was staring at Malfoy’s face now and watched it glow in the afternoon sunlight.
“I can’t help it.” He says despairingly. If only he loved Celeste. If only Harry hadn’t started working here. Then again, Harry working here was his saving grace.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Stay...” He adds, after getting his attention “Come sit. Unless you have somewhere to be?”
“Yeah, the rows go all the way down the gallery, all the way back up and ends halfway upstairs.” Draco said, gesturing to the iron railed balcony above them.
He stared at the wall next to him, before he fell back asleep.
Harry turns to him, smiling softly. “No, not really. There’ve been times when I’ve wondered.” He shrugged.
“Oh-“ Draco said, almost whispering.
“She’s coming over at the winter ball. From then on I’ll make frequent trips to her land. It’ll go on like that for a couple years and then the wedding will happen and she’ll move into the castle.”
Draco breaks the painful eye contact and shakes his head.
“Hey!” Harry shakes his head. Draco notices he has little dimples. And a light smattering of freckles. “You know you like my scruffs.”
Draco slowly turned, shrugging his shoulder that Harry’s hand was on. Did he not want Harry to touch him?
Draco lead Harry through a small passageway that edged around the large entrance gates and the moat of the castle. Harry stopped as they were walking over a dainty bridge that connected an arched hallway to the start of a winding path that snaked around large oak trees. He watched the small ripples that the fish left and cooed over the little ducklings that swam around after their mother.
Harry picked up the sheets and moved them to his side so he could spread his body over the bed. He hasn’t stood up for over 3 days now, and it was starting to make his legs numb.
“Fine.” Draco said, and picked the work he needed to catch up on.
Draco knows. Draco knows and Harry can’t run away. Draco knows, but he hasn’t ran away.
“You okay?” Draco asks tentatively, not stepping too close.
Draco fiddled with the ruffles at the end of his tunic, trying to find a reason he should stay in but ultimately gave up. He was 18 now, he should be allowed some freedom. He didn’t always have to be controlled by his father.
“Did what mean something?” Draco said after a pause, slowly closing the book.
“It’s stinging because it’s working. You big baby.” Draco mutters, focused on getting the salve applied neatly to Harry’s body. It seems to lessen the swelling, although Harry appears to still be in pain.
“Ah, can I come in? I saw him walk...” Harry starts but stops as he sees Draco slumped on the edge of the bed, sniffling and biting his nails.
He pulls his left leg too far back and doesn’t bend his elbow enough. Harry tuts. Draco smiles to himself. There’s definitely something wrong with him.
“I- YOU READ MY LETTER?” Harry screamed, anger rising up in him, causing a fire to burst through his heart and eyes.
Harry laughed, his breath skimming Draco’s face. “I knew it.” Harry said, and leant in to kiss him again.
“I’ll meet you at the small gates on the right before it begins. Harry will be thrilled to see you.” He said, and left.
“How was your first outing?” Harry said, a grand smile on his face.
“Aha!” Mathias barks, stretching his hand out to Harry. “You owe us five gold pieces, mate.”
“Oh,” Draco says, not realising the eyes staring at him. “Yes, I am.”
“Sir Harry Potter is in the castle!” She shouted before lowering her voice as another maid walked past. Adelaide grabbed Draco’s hand and pulled him into Draco’s room.
“Ah.” She nods. “And you’re certain?”
There are eager faces turned in his direction, and Draco decides they’ll play a game where everyone can play. He deals out the cards, explains the rules with an alacrity he didn’t know he had, and allows the game to start.
Although the match was a good 5 hours ago, the wounds were still bleeding and exposed. Draco grabs a cloth and begins to wipe away the blood, making Harry wince and grumble.
Draco’s heart flutters. And then sinks. He knows that Harry has feelings towards him. But what did he say only days prior? ‘Don’t tell Harry how you feel and don’t try to start anything with him.’
“I can do it myself, you know.” Harry sighs and began to sit up. It causes Draco to break his attention away from the hip, and he stopsHarry from getting up by placing a firm hand on his bicep. Draco’s heart began to beat at a rapid pace as he felt strong muscle underneath his fingers.
“Shut it. I don’t know why you’re asking me in the first place.”
“Worse, actually.” He chokes, lungs feeling sore and throat scratching like sandpaper.
Harry does it again, and soon Draco is practically bouncing up and down, Harry’s deep thrusts so agonising but also so good.
“If you were someone else, who’s going to be you?”
Draco just rolled his eyes and let Pierre get on. Before Pierre could add even a stroke of paint to the canvas, there was a light knock at the door.
He realises, not unwelcoming, that he can.
“And anyways, Draco is spectating with the King and Queen, he’ll be able to tell if someone’s trying to have at me.” Harry said, pointing aimlessly at Draco.
“I’m really sorry, Harry.” Hermione looked at him with tears in her eyes. She turned for a brief second to look at Draco. “You too, Malfoy.”
Adelaide was wrong. Draco could choose who he loved.
“I guess I don’t have to try to hard at that.” Harry shrugged confidently.
“I never thought I’d be able to see these.” Harry’s eyes start watering. Draco pulls him into his chest.
Harry smirks and shuffles forward, and Draco’s arm somehow instinctively goes around his waist. He could get used to this.
It’s Christmas Eve, and Draco can’t sleep.
“I’ll be fine Adelaide. Thank you.”
Through the thick of the trees he can see knights on horses riding in. The armour glistening in the night light.
They’re both breathless, both giddy with emotions so much bigger than the both of them.
“I really don’t understand you sometimes.”
“You can, Draco. You can.” Adelaide says, grabbing his hand and tightening her grip around it.
Harry raised his eyebrow at Draco.
There are footsteps that sound over the organs, and Draco thinks it’s one of his fathers acquaintances until he realises they’re coming towards him, and then Harry slides up next to
“I did go out!” Harry retorted, playfully holding his hand over his heart in mock-offence.
“A problem with Weasel? Well he’s a stupid-“
“It’s not that hard” Draco replied.
Harry smirks and Draco’s heart flutters. They meet in the middle, Harry bowing to Draco.
Harry bursts into laughter, and the tense atmosphere dissipates.
Hey there, Reader!
“I REALLY DON’T THINK THATS NECESSARY RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU WENT THROUGH MY LETTERS.” Harry cried, knowing that Draco had intruded into his life. He knew Malfoy would betray him.
“No, no. I just thought I saw something earlier. Let’s go.” He smiled at Ron and flew down, picking up his bag and heading towards the dorms.
“I have.” Draco said defensively. He didn’t want Harry to think he was totally boring.
Draco nods and turns the corner, into the far side of the castle. The large hallways turn into small corridors lined with large oak doors. Draco turns to the first door on the right, and stops.
“It’ll be fine like this.” He beams, and Draco rolls his eyes.
Maybe ignoring Harry was going to be harder than it seemed, seeing as they were staying in the same castle. Why was he trying to ignore him again? Oh right, because he was a fucking twerp who thinks he so handsome and intelligent. Not to Draco, though. Harry is just an annoying mess of a person, and he completely ruins Draco’s Prince image.
“Ah, shame.” Harry says, stretching out and jumping onto the saddle. Draco jumps up after him.
Still, no matter what Draco does he can’t change the future, and so grabs the sheafs of paper and a quill and sets off to the beach. He’s feeling in that mood today, best to allow himself to brood.
“It’s tradition. I’d rather the dancing just be us swaying from side to side.” He shrugs, and takes Harry’s calloused hands into his own. “I don’t think we’ll be doing this dance tomorrow. If so, I’ll be praying for your dance partner’s feet.”
“Alright, then.” Harry accepts the hand, letting go far later than was really necessary. Not that Draco minded.
It all feels very natural, like they’ve been doing this since they were teenagers. Sometimes Draco feels a lot older than eighteen, but Harry’s a solid reminder of his youth.
“I’m not sure I’m going to get any more free time, my father wants to do a speech and from then on it’ll be lots of conversations with people I don’t know...”
“They’ll be at the breakfast table.” Adelaide smiles with a grimace, sorting through the items dotted around in Draco’s private bathroom. She had comforted Draco as much as he could in his troubles, but there wasn’t much she could do to change Draco’s fate. She’s trying though, and Draco would never refuse the comforting reassurance that Adelaide has and will always present to him.
Draco didn’t know what to say, and Harry took that as a sign of consideration.
Harry didn’t reply, he only lifted up an eyebrow, knowing that Malfoy was lying.
Hi there!
Draco thinks Harry means lube, but he doesn’t  and so shakes his head.
He and his family would be in midnight mass right now, in the church attached to the side of the castle. But his father has been called out, along with the rest of his knights. The castle is practically empty. Which is a good thing, now that he thinks about it. He can walk around without being spotted and there’ll be no-one at the stables, which is somehow busy every hour of the day.
Dumbledore picked another name.
Harry’s very still when he sleeps, so unalike his constant fidgeting and need for movement. His lips are open slightly, and there’s a deep red flush to his cheeks.
Draco rests his forearms on the stone windowsill and watches. He doesn’t mind the chill floating through, doesn’t mind how it blows the fire out and leaves goosebumps over his skin.
The silence had carried on for the rest of the day. Even when they passed each other in the corridors. Each time Harry saw Draco in the hallways, he raised his eyebrows in a way where he hoped Draco could see him. But he kept his head down low and just carried on.
“Ah! Draco, your parents are expecting you at once. Oh and change your shoes, they’re filthy!” She says quickly and scoffs, glancing down at Draco’s black boots, which are now a murky brown colour.
Draco shot up, not knowing where this was coming from. “Ada-“
“That you’re gay.” Draco muttered out. His voice wasn’t angry, though, it sounded interested.
“Draco, the waters getting cold. You don’t want to fall ill.” Adelaide tutted, placing Draco’s clothes on the chair that sat by the bath.
“But then the day after it’s all just forgotten about?”
“Night, Knight.” Draco smirked and listened as Harry chuckled while opening and closing the door.
“Get the fuck out, Potter. This is none of your fucking business.” Draco says, louder now.
Harry’s hand that was on his cheek now moves up onto the side of his head. He’s pulling him in, kissing him slowly and passionately. It feels right, kissing him. He can’t believe he hasn’t been doing this all that time. “I’m sure their idea of friends includes lots of platonic snogging, huh?”
“Sure.” Said Harry focussing his attention back on his parchment.
“It’s my Father.” Draco said, quickly manoeuvred himself out of Harry’s grip and tugged them towards Juliet, trying to get away as fast as possible. Harry didn’t ask any questions, he didn’t really need to, and climbed back on to Juliet, gripping on to the dark leather. They went around the. group of men, far enough so that they couldn’t have been spotted and sped their way up back to the castle.
He opened his mouth to start questioning Draco even further, but fast footsteps sounded from outside and Snape rushed in.
“Never.” Harry says, tucking Draco’s hair behind his ear. His eyes fall to Draco’s torso, and then to where both their hips are pressed flush together. The position suddenly becomes suggestive, and Draco’s breath hitches.
“Okay.” Harry smiled and turned back to the book. He honestly thought it would be one of the most boring things on the earth, but Hermione had obviously picked something that would spark interest in Harry and he was intrigued from the first page.
“That does sound a little bit like jealousy to me.”
“But...Harry...” He tries to say, but the world has faded to black and Draco’s knees buckle beneath him.
“I think the fuck not, Harry. Why would you even ask?”
“Killing their head knight was supposed to end it all, but now I think it’s your family that they want to get revenge on.”
“Come with me.” Harry smirked.
“I’m...going to go...go sit.” Draco says quietly, tightening his grip on the paper. Much to his chagrin, and overwhelming affection, Harry follows. Draco lowers himself into a groove in the wood, and Harry settles himself on the sand.
“It was crazy when we found out Harry wanted to be a Knight. It was practically impossible for a person living around here to become one, and we had thought Harry was a lazy bugger who didn’t go out.” Ron grinned.
“Ah, Prince, just showing Sir Harry your rooms.” Adelaide smiles at the doorway.
“Something wrong with breakfast?” Adelaide asks playfully.
Please do leave a comment if you are enjoying this fic!
Draco stood up too, and then Ron and Hermione.
Draco emerges into the forest, and inhales  deeply, taking in the scent of moist soil and fresh lavender. The early morning sun streams through the leaves of the vast oak trees, illuminating small patches of Draco’s pale skin and leaving a calming warmth on the back of his neck. Draco makes his way down the same path he has always taken since he had gotten Juliet, and reminisces about Adelaide teaching him how to hold and control the reigns and how to calm the growing horse.
There was silence at the door.
But then something clicked in Draco. He was tired of being mean. His father was the one who wanted him to be friends with Harry, but Draco rebelled after getting rejected. But now he’s tired of it, and he wants to get to know Harry. Actually know him.
“But first,” he says, quickly stepping forward and pushing Harry’s hand down. The contact sends a thrill through Draco’s body, as it always does, and it takes everything he could to not just jump on Harry and snog him senseless. It was a bad idea, he told himself. “I lead.” Draco states, bowing in front of Harry before holding his arm out to his side. “Place your forearm against mine.” Draco tells Harry, suppressing a smile as Harry fumbles with his positioning.
“It’s awful.” Draco whines, wrapping his cloak tighter around his body. “And why are we out here in the snow? It’s bloody freezing!” He complains.
“Yeah.” Harry says airily, his focus on Draco’s confident face.
Lucius. Lucius? Since when have they been on a first name basis? Has Potter really tricked them in to thinking he is so noble?
“Night, Harry.” Draco blurted out. If this is what it took for Harry and himself to become friends, he would have done it a long time ago.
“Ah, don’t worry. Draco will be there if you need help, although I’m not sure how much he could do.”
“It doesn’t have a name, Harry, it’s a lake.” Draco tutted in a sarcastic tone.
“It’s Snape! The work he sets is so hard, and I don’t get it.”
The backs of Draco’s knees hit something hard and wooden, finding him and Harry now in front of the swing. Instead of moving them back, Harry slowly lowers Draco down on the swing, pressing his own body close. Their hands meet on the metal chains, Harry’s own warming Draco’s.
I really hit a wall when writing this chap, so do bare with me. I promise that in the next chapter there will be a lot of drama and action and possibly something else...
She winks and walks out the room with a spring in her step.
Draco’s always known this, always been defenceless against his father.
Soon after, they’re both back to their comfortable selves, Harry sifting his fingers through the golden sand. It’s cold, but Draco doesn’t mind.
“Well anyway, as I was saying, that if all goes well and you take and extra dose of your medication a day. You’ll be out by the end of the week.”
“But he works for you?” She asks, raising an eyebrow.
“I’m sorry.” He says, breaking the silence in the room.
“Ah, right...” Draco says. He doesn’t know where he got the idea in his head that Harry wasn’t a virgin, but it only made sense. Who wouldn’t want to?
“I heard Harry was here.” She smiled, before her moving eyes landed on Draco. The basket of bread that she carried fell to the floor, along with her jaw.
Harry doesn’t reply, and they just watch each other. Normally they could sit for hours in comfortable silence, but there were questions that were eating away at the both of them.
Large amounts of voices were now sounding out of the hall, but Harry ignored it. He just kept on running. He didn’t care what people thought of him anymore.
He adjusted his grip on Juliet and breathed in. He was already feeling a lot better. Things were changing in his life. Things he couldn’t control.
“Oh.” Harry’s eyes light up, and a thrill runs down Draco’s spine. “You want to?” He asks, too kind for his own good.
“Did you see a teacher?” Ron had quickly whipped his head around to look where Harry’s attention was fixed on.
Draco looked up and his deep grey eyes glowed with the help of the midday sun. He scowled intently, before a smile cracked on his face.
“Oh lord.” He groans, doing the action again. Draco’s body naturally reacts to it, and he’s not happy about it.
“With me being gay.”
When Harry woke up at 8am the next day, three large textbooks sat next to him on his bedside table. He saw Draco already writing his first essay of the day, and groaned at the thought of using his brain to write anything. He knew Snape would never go easy on him.
As soon as Pierre announced that he was finished, Draco leapt up from his seat, going over to where Harry was standing by the large rounded door that lead to the main part of the gallery.
Harry simply nods, moving further down Draco and shifting into place, his hard cock pushing  insistently on his hole.
‘Give your mother and father my love. And Juliet too. Farewell for now, Prince, I am most eagerly awaiting your next letter. Love, Princess Celeste.’
“Oh shush, it was a team effort.” Hermione said, covering up her smile.
“Come on, Potter. There’s another time for that.” Draco drawled, tapping his foot against the dry soil under his feet.
“I just- It will change everything. And it’s too late now. There’s nothing I can do.” He exhales, closing his eyes even harder.
The door swings open, making the parchment of Draco’s book flutter around. Draco slowly turns his head to see who had rudely disturbed his reading.
Later in the day, after Draco has written a slightly insincere letter to Celeste and finished reading nearly 2/3 of his book about adventures, he finds himself sitting on the large sofa in his library. His life was peaceful when Lucius was out. It gave him freedom. Well, freedom in the castle. There were no looks of disappointment, and when there were, Draco prepared for them. Although Lucius had allowed Draco to not take up becoming a Knight, he never supported Draco in doing much else. He was his son, but he was also a Prince. There is and always has been a level of class that they need to withhold, and Lucius is not about to risk losing his elite title because of Draco’s disinterest in what is expected of him. Lucius found himself shutting Draco away from the public eye, in hopes that they don’t see a sad excuse for nobility. When Draco was seen publicly, he was sharp and disagreeable. And this was all Lucius’ doing.
“Well of course it is, I’ve been at the castle 24/7 for the past two weeks or so, how do you expect me to come home and clean?”
glancing hesitantly at Draco.
“There was a tempest. We’d left fallen people in the mud. It’s just the sound, it makes me feel like I’m back there. Like he’s just dying all over again.”
“How about we sit?” Ron choked up, his face strained tightly.
Harry’s eyes are blown wide, shock taking over his features.
Harry looked back to his own bed, pretending to mind his own business as Malfoy was lowered on the bed, exaggerating in how much pain he was in.
“Of course I am, Potter. He has servants and maids for all of that. And besides, your job is to act tough to scare of any people trying to lay a finger on my family.” He laughed, curling up tighter in the crook of the sofa.
“Sure about them finding you?” Harry says with a frown.
“I’ll take it down with us.” Adelaide says subtly, noticing Draco’s words. “Come on, Sir Harry, I have yet to show you the best part!” She laughs excitedly and shuts the door, leaving Draco alone in the room and in his thoughts.
“I didn’t think they were going to react like that.” Harry laughed awkwardly, scratching the back of his neck.
“You’re not greedy, Draco. You can’t help it if your feelings change. You don’t deserve to be unhappy.” Adelaide assures him, brushing back a stray hair that had fallen on Draco’s face. “Is there someone else?” She speaks up after Draco has sat up.
Biting his lip with a blush, Harry murmured, “But your dad —”
“Is it strange to say I’ve missed your smart mouth?” Draco smirked.
“Not a fucking chance in hell,” Harry growled. “I know that isn’t what you want. I
Arching his back, Draco begged, “Harry, Harry, please.”
Knocking his head against the back of the settee, Draco’s voice cracked. “Worse. So much worse.”
The common room breathed a collective sigh of relief. Between Cho Chang and Ginny, one of them would be able to rouse Harry before the night was out.
“What happened? Did I do something wrong? Did I hurt you?”
Clearing his throat, George winced. “Sorry, mates. It’s not quite that simple. See, the magic is tied to Harry’s core, so it has to be the person
Jabbing his finger at a relevant passage, Theo exclaimed, “Here, here! ‘If a student is found to be in dire straits or fears for life and limb amongst those who should be kin, a re-sort by the Hat may be obtained. Though such cases are very rare, they are to be handled with utmost care, as Hogwarts is meant to be a home for all.’ ”
“Everyone in that bloody hall wanted to rip him to shreds when his name appeared. I can understand the Champions’ anger, assuming he cheated his way in, but if anyone had just
But the Horcrux was the most horrifying thing on the list. That was incredibly dark magic, darker than even his father’s associates were willing to tread. Draco shouldn’t even know about the existence of such a vile rite, but he’d stumbled upon it in a tome in the Malfoy library so ancient and weathered the script was barely legible. Never one to turn down a challenge, he used a charm to temporarily enhance the ink as he read until he reached the section on the “
“Harry,” Draco started, “before I go, let me apologize.” Harry opened his mouth to protest, but he held up a hand to stop him. “No, I need to say this. I don’t know when I’ll see you again and I can’t bear the thought of you not hearing it. I’m sorry for every thoughtless word or insult said to you or your friends. For drawing out a moment of wounded pride at eleven and turning it into a bitter feud that caused us both pain. I’m sorry for so many things I can’t even list them all.”
Harry recoiled, his stomach twisting in revulsion. “Bloody hell, Draco,” he muttered.
Nodding with a smile, he said, “Yes, Dobby, I do. Thank you for remembering.” Grinning broadly, the elf snapped his fingers for tea, popping out of existence when he verified they required nothing else.
And though he had a massive amount of explaining to do among his friends and future discussions with Draco about his feelings on blood status, Harry had no regrets. With Draco by his side and their new magic buzzing in their veins, he knew they could handle whatever life threw at them.
, he grimaced to find it was half three in the morning, but he was too tired to make the sojourn to the tower. Scurrying to an out-of-the-way hearth, he wrapped himself in his cloak, mindful to keep his head exposed so he wouldn’t frighten any elves, and quickly descended into sleep.
Blaise shot him a sympathetic look. “I don’t know, but something you said rattled him.”
An unexpected rush of warmth flooded him with her easy acceptance of him into their exclusive fold. It sent a rush of endorphins through his anxiety-riddled nervous system and loosened his tongue.
“I don’t need a lecture to know I was a fool for letting a childhood grudge colour my treatment of him, Draco,” he snapped. Severus shot him a venomous glare but was secretly pleased when his godson didn’t even flinch.
Severus listened with growing horror, wondering in a foggy part of his brain if he’d been confounded, because he certainly wasn’t hearing correctly.
Draco tilted his head in understanding. “That’s fairly standard. I expected it, honestly.” Harry’s eyebrows shot up in surprise, pulling a laugh from the boy next to him. “I really have given it a lot of thought, Potter. I refuse to be my father and make the same mistakes he did. I’ll not bend my knee to a maniac who refuses to stay dead.”
They exchanged a glance the others couldn’t interpret as the entrance to the common room slid open. Draco’s mouth snapped shut as a crowd of raucous fifth years filed in, leaving Harry oddly bereft to be denied whatever he’d been about to say.
“Yeah,” Harry said weakly as hope unfurled behind his ribs. “That’s what I want.”
He ducked into their room and stared at the sleeping boy, wishing for the first time in his selfish life it was possible to bear some of Harry’s burdens. He shouldered far too many on his diminutive frame; more than would be expected of someone twice his age—much less a teenager, no matter how famous.
Furrowing his brow in concern, Draco laid a hand on his shoulder and steered him to their room, waving distractedly to their friends. “Come on. Let’s make sure you pass out on a bed, not the common room floor, shall we?”
Harry’s stomach flipped under the intensity of his gaze and the weight of his confession, but he couldn’t find it in him to change the course of where they were obviously headed. Not when he’d wanted nothing more since cool hands slapped that life-saving button in his palm and revealed the Draco behind his apathetic society mask.
People see him as someone sharp and bold, but Draco knows he has so many layers underneath that. No one knows about his love for a certain knight apart from him. No one knows he writes books and enjoys thunderstorms apart from the very man his affections lie upon.
Did Draco want to see how Ron would react if he knew Harry’s secret? Had Draco been mad at Ron?
ty :)
“I don’t know, something about ‘copying me’ I think.” Harry rolled his eyes and looked to where Malfoy lay with Parkinson craning over him, caring for him as if he were a child. He certainly acted like one.
“No. There’s no way I’ll love Celeste the way I’m expected to.”
“There’s never not anyone after me, Draco. But yeah, I suppose so. That’s a day I won’t forget. The other kingdom is mad with what I’d done to their head Knight, and they didn’t let me go easily. I’m still not sure if they’ve completely let me go even now.”
“Try it without me this time.” He grins.
Draco releases a long-suffering sigh. “I’ll see you soon.”
“I don’t want to marry Celeste, I don’t want to be with any woman, because I like Harry Potter.” He says confidently, although he can hardly hear himself through the rushing of blood in his ears.
“Yes, yes.” He says sleepily, stretching.
“Draco, I will only be able to help until you tell me what the matter is. I’m here for you.” She nods, sighing.
Harry Potter doesn’t have a mistress? Well, maybe that’s something that Draco could show off about.
Draco grips around Harry’s neck, staring into bright eyes in the dark night. Instead of thick, snowy clouds lining the sky, there is now a smattering of glittering stars.
“Well actually he’s not supposed to be here.” Harry said sheepishly, shooting an amused glance at Draco.
“No, I insist. I have nothing to do and I’m trying to avoid thinking about the tournament.”
“No thank you, Miss...?” Draco replied politely, wanting to seem somewhat presentable to Harry’s friends.
Draco quickly stepped back into an alcove so that Lucius couldn’t see him.
A castle in England. High turrets and towers. Secret alcoves. Fire-lit hallways. Dark grey stone. Rooms on rooms. Books on books. A 14 year old Draco Malfoy.
Ron saw this.
Draco hides his head in his hands and watches through his fingers as Harry flips the pages.
‘I hope we are still in contact by the time we’re eighteen. It’s been thrilling talking to you again, I remember when we were nine. We would run through the castle’s gardens, much to my mothers dismay. I hope you remember too, it seems like long ago since you moved out of the land.’ A smile and a nostalgic feeling. A sigh.
It was only as the group passed through the hall to the Headmaster’s office that he chanced peeking at the Slytherin table. Malfoy’s jaw was tight, and he wore an expression Harry couldn’t name, his normally cold eyes burning with rage. Harry cowered under his wrath, but before he could drop his gaze, the blond nodded again and he breathed a sigh of relief.
friends,” he continued.
“Say something! For fuck’s sake, I want to help you!” Harry could barely control his voice. Using every inch of his body to calm himself down, he said as steadily as possible. “Just tell me one thing, and I’ll leave you alone, okay? Are you...are you in danger?” His eyes pierced Draco where it hurt.
Draco looked like he was about to break down. “I didn’t mean to. It was a mistake. I’m not lying.” He prayed Harry would believe him.
“Hermione, will you spit it out?” Harry retorted.
, Harry thought.
As the two exited the Room of Requirement together, Draco was beside himself.
“Nevermind that right now,” Harry replied, explaining that he knew where the Horcrux was. His own expression of awe mirrored that of Ron and Hermione’s as they showed him the basilisk fangs to explain what they'd been up to.
Then, after months of keeping all his feelings carefully contained, Draco broke.
“Professor Dumbledore wants you in his office now,” the Gryffindor continued. “It seemed...it seemed urgent.” With a last terrified look at Draco, he left.
“Habit,” Draco sighed. He only hoped there would be a next time — If his plan worked, there could be many; if not, well...he didn’t want to think about it.
The Gryffindor looked at Draco in awe as though about to say something, then hurried away as though afraid Draco might change his mind.
Draco was at the top of the Astronomy Tower, gazing at Dumbledore with an indiscernible expression in his eyes. Harry’s insides reacted instinctively to seeing Draco. He wanted to move, to shout, to pin Draco against the wall, to jump between Draco and Dumbledore. He yearned to find out, to explain, to do
is who you’ve been…” she started.
“I trust Severus with my life, Harry. You — and Mr Malfoy — should too.”
The loosened clench in Harry’s stomach erupted into butterflies. He could barely respond before Draco had kissed him — with fuller force than before — pinning him down on the cushion bed setup he had made.
“Did you hex him, Draco?” Pansy asked, leaning over, her eyes full of desire. “He doesn’t look hexxed,” she continued disapprovingly after giving Harry a once-over.
“No, I’m Harry,” Harry grinned, as Draco rolled his eyes.
But lately, that, too, had hit a dead end.
“How thick
Draco flinched at the use of his master’s name, though he shuddered to think he was answering to such a man — if man were even the right word for it.
hard, considering...”
His heart pounding, Draco followed his friends towards the Room of Requirement.
In fact, the times they were able to be together, Draco seemed positively springy.
“I don’t believe you,” he said, though it took all his determination. “What’s that behind you?”
Midway through his rant, now panting, Harry caught a glimpse of Draco. Draco was looking at Harry as though he’d never seen anything quite like it before in his life.
, “obsessed with Draco Malfoy these days, he’s
Laughing, Draco obliged.
“Hi…”
to kill someone.
And, Harry’s heart perked up at this next thought, Draco hadn’t betrayed him. Draco lied to Bellatrix on his behalf, and helped him and his friends to escape.
“Look, Harry,” Draco interrupted. “I’m so sorry I haven’t been in touch sooner. I’ve been so ashamed. Will you...will you please give me a chance to explain? Over coffee, maybe?”
“I panicked,” Draco continued. “I wasn’t ready to tell them about...about us, and I thought if I could get the fighting started, I could try and get you out without them noticing...It was stupid, obviously.”
“Wait, Malfoy!” Harry couldn’t help himself. “Draco.”
Hermione gave Draco an understanding look, while Ron still seemed skeptical. With nods at them, Draco turned around to watch the reaction of the person he truly cared about...
Without missing a beat, Harry wrestled Draco to the ground and held down his arms. He took a long, hard look at his gorgeous enemy —
Now that Draco thought about it, he convinced himself that it was possible. But nevermind that thought...whatever Harry may have been thinking before, he certainly hated Draco now. The thought made Draco’s body ache, and not in the magnificent way that Harry used to make Draco’s body ache. If only he could get that back.
Anyone walking by may not have even noticed that there were two people standing there. At that moment, in fact, they were one.
Harry expected a snarky retort back, but to his surprise and slight horror, Draco laid down across his lap and grabbed his hand.
“You know, I actually didn’t come here for makeup sex...but if you insist,” Draco crooned.
“No I’m not in
“Come on then,” Draco said smoothly, careful to conceal the full force of his joy.
He turned swiftly, his black cloak whipping the side of his leg.
“Good.”
Draco assumes ‘that night’ meaning the battle.
“Professor Pomfrey heard shouting and got me immediately. Is there a problem here?” Snape snapped, interrogatively. He looked between the two red-faced boys with a raised eyebrow, and his deep black eyes pierced through their souls.
“No, no. I insist. Go on then, you have a castle to be protecting.” Draco smiles and nods politely, turning back towards the castle.
“I hope you don’t mind that I put Romeo in the stables, I can assure you that he doesn’t bite.” Harry says excitedly, taking in the beautiful architecture of the castle as he walks behind Draco.
“You got me a book too?” He asks. Harry reads books, but he doesn’t like them nearly as much as Draco does.
When Draco wakes, it isn’t from his own accord. Something warm and sturdy jolts from under him, and his eyes fly open.
Harry only shrugged. “Oh!” He said excitedly, “About that book from your library, I saw that you had...” Harry chatted on, pushing Draco from the centre point of his lower back. Harry couldn’t tell , but Draco leaned back into the touch, letting Harry guide him to Draco’s rooms.
“Hold your horses. We’re waiting for Arthur.” Harry says, face blank.
Those words. Those three words. ‘Of course I’m not. My Father arranged my marriage when I was fourteen. I had no choice. I’m not fucking happy.’ Draco thought to himself.
“I DON’T KNOW, OKAY?” Draco winced after Harry had gone back to using his last name. The one he dreaded. The one that would always be associated with his Father.
Draco sits up in bed and rubs at his forehead, attempting to ease away the pain. Harry winces with sympathy.
“Viktor Krum.” Dumbledore announced and the hall erupted in cheer. Harry clapped and smiled at Ron as he whooped and shouted.
“She’s so lovely. She’s honest and genuine, and I feel bad that I can’t return that. It feels awful.”
“Merlin you were running around like a headless chicken! Did you think I was going to punish you?” Draco laughed, something that came deep from his chest.
Draco heaves in a heavy breath and lifts his head to speak.
Before Draco completely falls asleep, he can hear a low, long suffering sigh from outside the doorway.
If Draco tries hard enough, he can imagine it’s Harry he’s dancing with. Instead, he’s taking the hand of his dance partner and joining in with everyone else.
Draco nodded, even though he wasn’t hearing a word. All he could feel was Harry’s hand on his, and how strange it felt. Something new, something unfamiliar. He tried to pull out of the touch, but found no use. He couldn’t tell if he liked it or not, and Harry wasn’t any help either. He was just looking out, across the lake.
“Oh I couldn’t forget.” Celeste replies, and Draco notices that Celeste has moved close to him on the bench, and their shoulders are almost touching. “Or that time when you didn’t have a horse, and you’d thought it was a good idea to have a try on Xalvador, who was far too big bear in mind, and you fell of.”
“What’s that?” He asks, pointing, and Draco turns his head to see a bright red package placed between a pillar candle and a book.
Draco swings his arm back with Harry’s aid and throws with as much professional technique as he can muster, but as it reaches the water, the small rock just makes an infinitesimal splash and then sinks.
“It’s only for one night, then you can go back to wearing your scruffs.”
“Harry, there’s thousands of types of dance. That was the easiest one. If you want to touch, then fine, but-”
Harry smiled for a couple of seconds, thinking about what he could do when he was out. He turned his head towards Draco, who had soft smile on his face.
“Are you well enough?”
“Oh god, me too.” Draco admits, allowing his feelings to be out there because they can. He really doesn’t know why he’d been holding out all this time. It’s hard to really believe he let his problems with Celeste and his parents get in the way. “Now shut up and kiss me.”
Harry wipes away all bodily fluids from his face with his expensive fabric sleeve, like the heathen he is, and stands up.
Harry froze. How had Draco found out? Did Ron and Hermione come up earlier and say something? But how? They didn’t know, as he never told anyone. Apart from Sirius. Harry’s face morphed from shocked to angry as he realised that Draco read Sirius’s letter.
His mother and father come up to him frequently, asking Celeste about her well-being and her time so far in the land. For once, his parents look proud of him.
Ron turned to Hermione. “Why are you sticking up for that slimy git?” Ron muttered under his breath in the direction of Hermione. His hand was clutched around his wand. He knew Harry would be having a hard time with Draco.
Harry turned quickly around, folding the corner of the page and snapping the book shut. Draco cringed at having to undo the crease, but before he could voice his thoughts about Harry’s disrespect for his expensive books, he noticed Harry’s alarmed face.
“You’re welcome.” He said, before pulling a money bag full of gold pieces out of his trouser pocket. He didn’t really know how much a sword was, so he just placed the whole bag onto the table. He had thousands more of them at the castle, so it was no loss.
“Sure I can. I am the Prince.” He said, but it was hard to ignore the sadness in his voice. “As long as you keep to yourselves no one will say a word.”
“You asked Adelaide? Harry, she could find out!”
“Look...I’m so sorry for what I said last night...” Harry starts, looking appalled with himself.
“Yeah, I get what you mean. I think it would be fun though. I talked to Cedric the other day and we were discussing what type of challenges they would have. Too bad I’m too young to enter.” Harry sighed.
Pierre hobbled overs grumbling “Always moving, Malfoy. Let me shake your hand, must be off now.”
He’s passing the main part of the castle, the room opposite the entrance hall. It’s cleaner than it’s ever been, which should be impossible because it was immaculate before. He’s been careful not to touch things or move items around when as the castles been cleaned, and due to that he feels as he’s been locked up. Yesterday with Harry was a breath of fresh air, literally, and he’d only wish these next few days will be the same.
“You wanted to go back?”
Draco thinks he’s blushing from head to toe. He’s never been held like this before, and it’s doing things to him.
“I very much do.” He grins. Then his face falls. “You know I’ve never...”
He glanced at Draco, who was facing in the direction of Harry. He still seemed to be sleeping. As he turned his attention back to his bed, he noticed a letter sitting by the table. It had no envelope but he could tell that it was from Sirius by the way he wrote and the rustic parchment the ink was on. He finished reading it, a smile on his face and picked up a new piece of parchment to reply to him. He was always so excited about Sirius’s letters coming in, it was the only thing in his life keeping him sane.
Harry snorts and wraps it around Draco’s naked body, yanking the hood down over his eyes. He remembers when he and Harry had first gone into the village together, walking through the surrounding forest and Harry messing around with him. They’re still the same, except Draco is now far less dressed and a lot more infatuated.
“Yes, yes. Fine.”
Harry laughs under his breath. He looks up at Draco from where he’s planted horizontally across the bed, opens his mouth to reply, but then his eyes flick to Draco’s cock, pressed needy into the sheets. He reaches out for Draco’s hips, placing his hands firmly on each side, and manoeuvres Draco over him, so that he’s straddling Harry.
“Don’t push it, you’ll be begging at his knees so he won’t have you beheaded.”
“God.” Harry breathes. “I couldn’t even imagine being in a relationship like that.”
“Ah, no. He asked me to come pick up his sword.”
“Ah, why did he choose to become a Knight? Why couldn’t he become a farmer or something.” Ron groaned, before remembering who he was in the presence of and quickly standing up straight. “And he has that tournament soon, too.”
He almost feels sorry for her, too. He’s been sweet and dedicated, and it’s all false.
“I was definitely too big for my boots back then.” Draco laughs, partly enjoying himself but also panicking slightly about how Celeste’s face is inches from his.
Hey there, Reader!
Draco paused for a second, taking Harry’s words in. He didn’t know how to react. Hearing Harry so honest and open about things had humbled Draco. But he couldn’t show it. He couldn’t say that he liked the way that Harry stared into his eyes. He couldn’t say he liked it when Harry throws his tantrums. He couldn’t say that Harry was perfect. But Draco knows that Harry is, and that’s what is keeping him sane. Keeping him sleeping at night. Keeping him motivated. Keeping him alive.
Before he can close his eyes, there’s a clattering come from down the hallway. Draco feels as though he wants to cry. His sudden submergence in freezing water earlier has weakened his body, and he’d rather do anything than stand up and inspect the situation.
Hey there, Reader!
“And I felt like I owed it to you. I truly am sorry, both for pushing you in and for what I said.” His eyes are sunken and he looks crestfallen.
“I guess, yeah. But then again, what can I do? I’ll just have to wait.” Harry said disappointedly.
“Don’t worry about it, Draco. As much as your father is a horrible man, he’s horrendously good at protecting the land and the people in it.”
Sorry this chap is short! I promise the next one will be action packed <3
“You’d think I’d name a lake, private to basically only me, after my Father?” Draco asked, exasperated.
He pulls it out, admiring how precise the stitching is and finding the usual pocket tucked in just under the arm hole. There’s a always a name tag attached to the collar, but Draco realises it doesn’t have his name on. He looks closer, and in gold thread reads:
“The things I do for you.” She shakes her head and leaves, walking back in the last second to kiss his head.
“Oh, Draco. There’s nothing embarrassing about being sick. Let me help you up.”
“What are you doing?” Harry says slowly, trying to hide the fact his body might fall apart in the next few minutes.
“What’s wrong? It’s a great book!” Harry says, holding the black tome close to his face.
Draco folds himself against Harry sides, using his own weight to calm Harry’s moving body.
“Down here.” He says, grabbing Harry’s hand and running fast towards the door at the sound of voices entering the garden.
“Your eyes, it looks like you’ve been crying.” Hermione sympathetically said, and Draco whipped his head around so he could see Harry’s face.
“Father had it done a few months ago. He was getting impatient, and wanted to ‘celebrate early’”
Harry’s eyes widen, and then he exhales heavily.
“Good.” Harry softly smiled. He yawned and settled back down, but he didn’t turn away from Draco this time. He had nothing to hide from the other boy and felt as though his presence was a benefit to his healing. As he lay flat on his back, the thought of sleeping had left his mind. After sleeping for most of the day he thought that it would be best to stay up, so that he could have a longer rest the next night.
“Merlin.” Draco blinked his eyes open.
“That’s my job.” Draco chuckled.
He couldn’t take it back now, couldn’t say ‘Oh it was just a joke.’ Because it wasn’t a joke. It was something that had been on his mind for the past two years. Something he had to hide in fear of his safety and life. It wasn’t a joke. And Draco didn’t laugh. He seemed defensive at first, but there wasn’t a moment where Harry felt threatened. He had no doubt that if his secret had come out earlier, Draco would have teased him to no end. He knows how it goes, because Sirius had to suffer with that too. Sirius wanted to have a normal life and wanted to love whoever. But he had to go thought insults and pain for the duration of his time at hogwarts. And it scared him. Really scared him.
“Don’t get too excited. You can’t come when you’re working, I don’t want you to get fired.” Draco said sternly and narrows his eyes.
“Well, on the battlefront I got hit in the hip, and it messed it up. It’s not anything bad but I can’t walk for too long without it starting to hurt and seize up. I’ll live, though.” Harry sighs, rubbing his right hip over the fabric of his trousers. He pauses and then continues, “Cadogen, our commander, demanded that I leave to heal. I protested, of course, because I didn’t want to be stopped by a minor setback and so I asked if there were any Guard Knight jobs. Cadogan said he knew your Father, so he talked and now I’m here, I guess.”
“I expect you to be competing in the tournament soon, Harry.” Lucius says, his eyes narrowed in question.
“What’s he doing here?” Ron gestured with his head in the direction of Malfoy.
“Get out of my room.” Draco seethes, his back still turned from the two.
Draco couldn’t speak. All the words in his head were jumbled. He heaved in one last breath before it all come out again. His knees began to buckle underneath his frail body.
pressure at the affirmative.
“You always know what to say.” He replies quietly.
This is what a family is.
Some are smiling at him, impressed. Some are whispering to each other, nodding in his direction and not seeming as though they utterly hate his guts. He supposes he should have tried to be nice since the beginning, but it’s not too late to start.
“Shit. Sorry. Urm... I need to go. Murderous King after me. Thank you for getting my sword! Tell Ron and Hermione that I miss them!” He sprinted off, leaving Draco frozen by himself.
“Hey, I’m more than just a pretty face.” He grins. Draco rolls his eyes. “And with...with Celeste. Just because you’re being given something that’s supposed to make you happy doesn’t mean that you should force yourself to feel that way. Love is complicated, for gods sake! Did you know that Ron and Hermione liked each other for years before they admitted to their feelings? It’s not something that should be handed to you by your parents.”
“Ah yes, I see. On that note, though, do you have a mistress? I suspect an honourable young man like you would be on your way to marriage soon.” Lucius questions.
“Fine,” Malfoy grunted, “I saw you get injured while you were flying and I tried to show my friends that the trick you did was easy, but now I understand that it’s not. Happy?” He said, unwillingly admitting to his actions.
Harry wanted to know. He wanted to know if it meant something to Draco. Or if he was just an experiment. Someone Draco could test on. To prod and poke and tease, to find a reaction. To get an answer and move on.
“Potter, this is my library. My room is three steps down the corridor.” He waved his hand, exasperated.
Harry sucks in a tight breath. Draco looks at him, but his face is expressionless, just looking up at the clear sky. His eyes are so green.
Ron quickly turned at the stirring conversations starting behind him, and then gave Harry a guilty look.
“I’ll name it. Hmm...Lake Lucius?” Harry asked, shrugging.
All of the heads turn to him, familiar faces bewildered at his presence. Draco freezes, incapable of moving any further.
going to be letters. More Celeste, less Harry. Less Harry, more despair.
“I’ve got some time to spare, how about you come to the library?”
They soon fell asleep, the only sound coming from the hospital was their faint snores, contempt in each other’s presence.
Ron slowly made his way towards Harry, a look of anger on his face. He had tried really hard.
Harry takes off down the corridor with Arthur at his side, leaving Draco to follow in a huff.
Harry’s mouth is warm and inviting, his lips soft and frankly intoxicating. The kiss is a steady ache— a good ache— that consumes them. Harry is dragging him down further, drawing him in desperately and Draco can’t think. Can’t think about anything but this man.
“Who are you kidding? Never in a million years.  Harry would never want me. It’s stupid. I’m stupid.”
“Well come on, then. I’ll get Ada to run you a bath? You know I’m just playing around, yeah?”
Harry looks worriedly from Pierre to Draco. “Er...I suppose?”
“Yeah.” Harry sighed and diverted his attention back on his friends.
“I’ll read a bit, try to relax.” She opens the heavy tome and starts at the first chapter, although Draco has done three re-reads so far.
They got to the corridor that split off in two directions, ready to say goodbye. Something stopped them before they could.
“That’s alright, you don’t have to.” Harry laughs, picking up his own sword.
Her cheeks blush, and she threads an arm through his. “I’ve been wonderful, actually. My father had spoilt me this year for Christmas, even though I insist on not having any more presents. They do honestly still think I’m nine years old!” She laughs.
Draco hadn’t known that either. Oh. Having no parents but still growing up to be strong. Well now he feels slightly bad. Only slightly, though.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Harry said, stunned.
Although Harry seemed to think nothing of the touch, Draco felt a warmth that left him breathless, for absolutely no reason at all.
“What did you want to talk to me about, anyway?” Draco says, tearing his eyes away from Harry’s emerald ones.
“My Father certainly trusts you.”
Draco just stretched and spread wider, not bothering to move.
“Yes. Of course I am.”
He emerges from behind the tree, looking as the knights disappear in the distance.
The castle’s secret garden is exactly how he remembers it, a rusted swing hanging from a willow tree in the middle, and walls of cobbles and roses.
Draco doesn’t say anything, just smiles at Harry from the bed and admiring the way he’s leaning against the door frame.
They’re all sitting around a table, there must be at least fifteen people gathered, and they’re playing a card game which seems to have everyone’s attention. Harry’s at one end of the table, with Ron and Hermione sat next to him, and he’s drinking what looks like mulled wine and laughing full-bellied at something which the eldest Weasley has said.
One side of her mouth lifts up, and surprisingly, Draco finds himself smiling too.
“No.” Harry quickly said.
Harry’s about to take him in, but something heady and persistent surges in Draco.
“I guess no, not really. How do you know how to do this anyway?” Harry says intriguingly, flicking his eyes down to where Draco is sat at the edge of the bed.
Ron opened a second door, leading to a  confined area containing a desk and a chair, with parchments covering the whole of the available surface.
“I’m not lying about the sweating part, honestly. I think I’ll be having a bath.”
“What happened?” Draco said, trying to moves Harry’s hand away from his body.
He slowly leans in, much too excited about being given the opportunity of good morning kisses, and relishes the feel of Harry’s pliant mouth against his own.
Harry is a medicine, the panacea to all his problems.
Draco slumps into his bed, allowing his eyes to drift closed again, and only waking up for dinner. Whatever Draco is feeling, he’s either going to have to sort it out or ignore it all together. But it is Harry Potter, and ignoring him has proved to not be easy.
smile on his face. His eyes drift up to his hair, where Adelaide has plaited it down the middle. Draco hates it, but it’s the fancy attire that his father insists on.
“What, Adelaide?”
“Yeah, sure.” He replies with a small smile before turning, setting out to find Adelaide and harass her into running the hottest bath she can.
“He’d make little crowns- and- and pretend to be your Father.” Hermione said, the second half coming out as barking laughs.
........well
“Of course he hasn’t.” Lucius tutted. “Come at seven, it should all be served as you arrive.” He stated, patting Harry on the shoulder. He turns down the next corridor that lead to his drawing room and disappeared out of sight.
“Okay, follow my lead. I stand back, you stand back. I turn anti-clockwise, you turn anti-clockwise. Got it?”
“Maybe I’m just bad at it.”
Malfoy was close to screaming but decided not to and slammed his head into his pillow instead. He didn’t want any more injuries and have to stay even longer with ‘Saint Potter’.
He’s so content right now that he would quite happily go and find Celeste and tell her she should just turn back and go home.
With every day that passes, Draco feels as though he loses himself more and more. That his freedom is slipping away at his fathers hands, and there’s nothing he can do about it.
“Oh nothing.” Draco smiles and shrugs. The adrenaline from yesterday still courses through his body, and all he wants to do is go to the stables, get on Juliet and fly across the beach. And this time he wasn’t going to cry. He doesn’t feel like he needs to. Although nothing has been resolved, and it never will be, he has a good feeling about the next couple of months. Maybe it’s because Celeste is coming later in the year, maybe it’s because the tournament happening in a couple days (which he’s definitely not excited for, apart from the fact that he can see Harry in combat and tease him about it later), maybe it’s actually because of Harry that he-
“Nothing at all.” He replied, letting Ron put take the sword and put it in the bag.
“Actually, I was thinking you could come with me.” Harry smirks mischievously.
“Fuck.” He says on an exhale, desire taking a whole new level.
“Harry Potter.” Dumbledore announced, in a stern voice.
“You know that song?” Harry asked, surprised at Draco’s music knowledge.
“Maybe you can use the rest to hire a maid that will clean Harry’s mess of a flat. I’d be done for it my living area looked like this.”
Harry sat and watched as Pierre began to paint Draco onto the canvas. This was going to much longer than Draco had previously anticipated.
Draco huffed and sighed on his way down to the lake, trying to think about anything but his frustration with everything right now.
“And also, Draco, you have a letter from Celeste. I don’t think she’s particularly happy about the silence on your side.” She said, a frown pulling at her lips.
Harry turns back now, eyes searching Draco’s face, preparing for impact. Draco says nothing, and he looks relieved.
Draco cards his fingers through Harry’s curls, biting his lip to stop a moan from escaping. He’s already hard, and Harry’s teasing is infuriating.
It makes sense, it’s perfectly reasonable, but jealousy and something alarmingly heady surges in his stomach, mixing unpleasantly alongside his nervousness and dread.
“I-“ Draco starts, and then pauses. No. He didn’t have to talk to Harry. He was his knight after all. “It’s none of your business.” He adds, which is followed by an eye roll from the man in-front of him.
Draco’s heart hurts.
Draco just nodded and walked off. Not a single thing could cheer up his foul mood.
“I have power over mostly everyone in this castle, and don’t think I won’t hesitate to get you fired. The castle might seem much more quiet once you’ve gone on your merry way.” Draco sighed, tilting his head so that it rested on the back of the sofa.
“So,” Draco coughed “need help with your work?”.
Draco shrugs sheepishly, although there’s nothing to be embarrassed about. It was true, after all.
Draco wakes up the next day with a thumping headache and an aching heart.
“Harry?” Draco whispers, spotting a fatigued Harry at his door. His hand is clenching over his right hip and he’s wincing in pain.
Yours dearest, Draco.’
Ron just nodded.
“Well then how are you bored? I’m sure Celeste keeps you busy. I remember you giving Adelaide a letter, on my first day here.”
“Ron says hi.”
“I’ll get it.” Draco said, shrugging. He’d never and will never have a problem with money. In fact, he felt like he had too much that he didn’t know what to do with it.
As soon as Celeste leaves, with another kiss, he pulls Juliet out of the stables and rides straight into the village, heading directly to the Weasley’s shop.
“Then what is it? I apologise for bringing it up, Draco, but it hurts to see you like this. I only want to make you feel better, and you can do that by telling me what’s going on.” She says softly, compassion lacing her tone.
“But I’ve known for a bit now.” He adds. It feels like a weight taken off his chest, not having to pretend his love for someone. “Are you surprised?”
“What do you think you’re doing? Having silly little fights while you should be working? I know for a fact that you, Knight Christopher, should be guarding the main gates. And Potter! I thought we agreed that you’d only get an invitation for the coming ball if you’d worked extra time! Unless you’d like to stand out in the cold greeting guests, hm?” He huffs. “I don’t want to see any of you out here again. Do it in your own time. Do you forget how sacred this castle is? You’d all be worthless if I hadn’t hired you. Now stop slacking. The winter ball is a very important event, and I don’t want you lousy scoundrels ruining it. Do I make myself clear?” He says harshly, raking his eyes angrily over the gathering.
Harry stared and stared and stared. But it was no use.
Because Harry Potter is a charmer, the maiden he’s dancing with— who he’s now worked out is Knight Arthur’s girlfriend— is blushing and swooning, and it’s making it hard to tell it Harry means it or not.
“Draco!” Harry calls in a sing-song voice, swinging the door open. Draco’s very glad that this part of the castle is so secluded, otherwise he’d be in a lot of trouble.
His squirming stops as his face comes up close to Harry’s, his lips twitching in a sense of need, and Harry’s eyes turned from playful to lustful.
“Fuck.” He shouts into his pillow, squeezing his eyes shut and trying to escape from a world where stupid responsibilities weigh down on him. What was he supposed to do now?
“I know. Feelings are complicated, and you’re young, too.”
“Stop moving, or it’ll hurt more.” Draco says sternly. Harry Potter was such a diva.
“Okay then.” Draco softly smiled. He turned so he lay on his back, gazing at the ceiling.
There’s a loud sound of clinking metal as the men in the centre of the arena filter out onto the benches. The first few matches are short but tense, awarding ooh’s and ahh’s from the crowd. Draco sits in their spectator box, idly picking at the leather strapped around his waist. He takes notice of his ring. He hasn’t taken off for ages, not even when sleeping. But it wasn’t because he was just so infatuated with Celeste that he never wanted to part with it, it was because if he takes it off, he doesn’t think he’ll care to remember to put it back on. Even though the signet ring is bulky and quite simply a statement piece, it feels like hardly anything, either it feels like it’s not there at all or that Draco’s finger has become numb to the warmth it used to hold. It wasn’t a matter of just not wearing it, though. Lucius would notice instantly. Draco wraps his other hand around the ring to conceal it, and puts his attention back onto the tournament. From the corner of his eye, he can see his Mother smiling in his direction. Draco feels sick.
“No, no.” Draco inhales,!trying to catch his breath. “I’ll do it, you sit back. It’ll only hurt worse if you start moving.”
His parents are satisfied, Celeste is seemingly happy, and Harry’s been understanding throughout it all. He wouldn’t say he himself was content, but he’s feeling a lot better about the whole situation.
Draco shoves him away, unamused.
Hermione scrabbled for words and then straightened her position. “I’m sorry, Sire, but I’d thought you’d have been more defensive about your Father. I know many people are not a fan of him, but I hadn’t realised you weren’t one too.” Hermione stated, before shrivelling into herself at Draco’s neutral face.
“And why would we do that?” Draco scowls in anger.
“The seven o’clock bell just went.”
It’s just the way Harry stands, with dark curly hair pulled back into a small ponytail at the back of his head, or the way the chain mail fits snug around his muscles, or how the dark green fabric of the tunic makes his emerald green eyes shine in a way that even Draco can see from where he’s sitting.
Draco’s too breathless to reply, and instead reaches for Harry’s hand.
About halfway down the indicated hallway, he found a massive painting of a fruit basket and grinned at the irony of the entrance to the kitchens hiding behind a still life of food. Double-checking the hall for Mrs. Norris, he reached out and tickled the pear, marvelling when a doorknob appeared under his hand.
“It was. There was a moment, Draco...it was fucking close. I wanted you to know.”
“Fine. You’re right, I’m starving.” Sitting up with a yawn, he shoved his glasses on his nose and frowned at Draco’s wide-eyed stare. “Everything okay? Do I have something on my face?”
“Though the question stands, Mr. Malfoy. Why are you here?” Dumbledore asked.
Fred and George thundered into Gryffindor Tower, holding their sides and gasping for breath. Shirts untucked and faces gleaming in the firelight, they leaned against the wall and tried to calm their racing hearts. The entire common room froze at the disheveled state of the Weasley twins until Ginny’s voice pierced the silence.
He should find Hermione and Ron and say goodbye, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to walk away if he did. No, it was better this way. They would miss him, but Harry would be another casualty of war this way, instead of a sacrificial lamb.
Wisard(e) - ME spelling of “wizard”
The witch flicked her hair over her shoulder with a haughty sniff. “Non, I would not wish it, either. You are handsome enough, I suppose, but you are not...how do you say?” Fleur pointed to Krum’s bulging biceps, which the Bulgarian flexed with a grin.
,” he whispered. “I don’t know if you can hear me, but I hope you can. I’m not sure I’ll be able to repeat what I’m about to say. I’m...not entirely sure this will work, but Granger seems adamant it will. I-I want you to know I’m here because I want to be. I care deeply for you, though my approach over the last few years has probably led you to believe otherwise.”
Crabbe and Goyle returned the gesture and answered in unison. “He’s ours.”
Throwing his arm over his eyes, he suppressed a groan. He’d known in some small part of his brain when he accepted Draco’s offer that the unexpected alliance wouldn’t go over well, but he didn’t regret it. How could he when he, a lion among snakes, had been made immediately welcome? However, he
He watched, rapt, as Draco threw back his head and laughed, showing off the elegant column of his neck and dislodging his hands from his face to rest lightly on his shoulders.
Clearing her throat, McGonagall continued, “I’m aware this is...unorthodox, but it seems the Weasley twins are not merely pranksters. Their ingenuity and creativity are second to none. However, that puts us all in an awkward position.”
“Pretty sure you’re the only wizard to ever tell the infernal thing what to do,” Draco chuckled, amazed by both Harry’s audacity and his startling lack of awareness. “Where did it want to put you then?”
“The best part though,” Draco continued, puffing his chest with pride, “is you’ll have the smartest wizard in the school and a nest of overprotective vipers to help you with your tournament tasks.”
“Terrible timing, too. You were having a moment, and I was so enjoying it,” Pansy sighed wistfully.
“This may be the one instance Granger was wrong then,” he joked. Chuckling at Harry’s bemused expression, he explained. “She was sure you hadn’t figured out how you felt and warned me you might need time to process. I recall her saying I shouldn’t be offended if you said ‘something asinine.’ ”
Harry woke with a yawn, blearily rubbing the grit from his eyes as his brain caught up with his body. After an hour of counting the stones in the ceiling while impatiently waiting for sleep last night, he finally caved and tasked Dobby with fetching him a sleeping draught. He wasn’t sure if the elf nicked it from the infirmary or Snape’s stores, but decided it was best to not ask. It wasn’t dreamless, for which he was thankful because he didn’t want to risk addiction, but it meant the ten hours sometimes featured unhappy images. Though it was better than no sleep at all, he supposed.
“Do you want me to stop?” Draco asked between desperate kisses.
sorry for everything.”
“It will,” she stated firmly, squeezing his shoulder for emphasis. With a parting smile, she ducked into Pomfrey’s office, leaving him staring at the partition with mounting anxiety. Gathering the dregs of his courage, Draco stepped around the curtain and froze at the sight that greeted him.
Draco prayed the man didn’t question his motives too deeply, since they weren’t quite as advertised. It seemed an eternity passed as Severus mulled things over before he inclined his head in grudging agreement and Draco could breathe again.
Breathing deeply to maintain a semblance of control, Draco lowered his voice and said, “Lastly, he has panic attacks. If you catch him having one, help him through it and then find me. I don’t care if you pull me out of class, Severus will cover for me.”
The partnership between the boys proved to the world that the past was truly past and common ground could be easily cultivated. Angling her face toward the table, she hid her smile behind her teacup as Harry recovered first, scrambling to his feet and extending a hand to Draco, their hold lingering for a beat or two once they were both upright.
“Take me home, love. It’s my turn to take care of you,” Draco purred.
“The Hogwarts champion is Cedric Diggory!”
Covering her mouth with her hand, Hermione smothered her shocked cry, but couldn’t stop her feet from bringing her closer. “I’m so sorry,” she whispered. “I want to hug you. Will you let me?”
help you. I’m afraid the ‘saving people’ thing isn’t restricted to Harry.”
“Professor.”
Clinging desperately to the man he gained, only to lose in the same night, Draco bit back a sob. “Of course, I’ll wait. I’ll wait forever if I have to. I just got you, Harry, I’m not giving you up now.”
No sooner had he turned to leave than the Fat Friar glided through a nearby wall. He paused at the sound of Harry’s muffled cries. Tutting kindly in the empty hallway, the ghost said, “If someone happened to be up and about, lonely and peckish, I would recommend a visit to the kitchen for a spot of tea in front of a warm fire. Look for the fruit basket on the wall and tickle the pear. Tell them the friar sent you and they’ll take care of you.”
Of course, tall, blond, and handsome. What else would he be?
Flushing slightly under his expectant gaze, he prayed he wasn’t about to make a fool of himself. “What about Veela hair?”
The elegance of her magic filled Draco with shame. He knew as well as anyone Granger was brilliant, but aside from watching her cast in class, he’d never paid attention to how deftly she wielded it. It further proved everything his parents taught him to believe was nothing but lies. Granger might be muggle born, but her magic was innate, just like his, and not in the least bit tainted.
Severus grimaced and cleared his throat. “Your mother was about 5’ 10”, I believe, and your father was 6’ 1” by the time we graduated. I know because he and I topped out at the same.”
Following the directions, Harry gave a short bow and was rewarded with an approving smirk from Daphne as she straightened. “Well met, Heir Potter. Welcome to Slytherin House. We are honoured to have you.”
“Why would you need it?” he asked carefully.
Taking in his friends’ earnest expressions, he sagged against the arm of the couch with a relieved sigh. Deep down, he was sure they wouldn’t betray him, yet the fear lingered in the back of his mind. Lucius would never hesitate to exploit anyone’s weak points and he’d been raised to do the same. Which was terrifying, since Harry would forever be Draco’s greatest weakness, but his friends' loyalty rested with him—not their parents—for which he was eternally grateful.
Draco dropped his gaze and his cheeks flamed when Harry’s eyes flicked to his left arm. “I didn’t...
“Lead on, Professor,” he agreed as he hopped to his feet.
With a resigned sigh, he realized they’d have to tell the others about Harry’s nutrition regimen to prevent embarrassing situations in public.
“Now half the school can claim they’ve kissed the Boy Who Lived, but none have kissed
“No,” Pansy said with deadly calm. “Harry’s mine now. I’m sorry Draco, you’ll have to fight me for him because no one is laying a goddamn finger on him ever again or I will raze this entire castle to cinder blocks.”
“You’re nothing like him, Draco,” Harry soothed. “Your concern about coming across that way proves it. You’re a better person than you give yourself credit for and you absolutely did not force me into anything. You asked, I agreed, and you even checked in again to be sure I was still okay.” Pressing a kiss to his shoulder, he asked, “So, why’d you bolt?”
“Yeah?” Draco asked eagerly.
Staring out the large windows revealing the eerie magnificence of the Black Lake, he muttered, “I belonged in Gryffindor once, but Ron and Seamus have always been insanely jealous of me. Picking fights over my fame, asking me to use my name for favours, while simultaneously despising that I have money and making me feel guilty for covering a round at The Three Broomsticks. Not to mention the times Gryffindor believed the rumours about me, instead of trusting my word.” His shoulders curled around his ears, remembering the hell that was second year, and blinked back the tears threatening to make an appearance.
Peeking at her colleague through her fingers, Pomfrey smirked. “I do wish that loathsome woman had taken the bait. I’d have shipped her to St. Mungo’s, and we’d all have been free of her.”
A weighty silence fell in her absence, but Harry couldn’t handle rehashing the day; remembering in agonizing detail his panic attacks or the fear on Draco’s face in the hospital wing. Ignoring the prickling from three pairs of eyes, he rummaged through the clothes he dumped on his trunk. When his fingers brushed the cool glass buried in his pocket, he sighed in relief and uncorked the bottle with his teeth to down the blue liquid in a single gulp.
“Well mate, if we come back later we’ll help you get to the shower, yeah?” Ron suggested, feeling pity for Harry.
“You’ve sworn allegiance to my father.” Draco states, stabbing pains all over his body as the words leave his mouth.
“Alright. Will I be seeing you at breakfast? My Father seems to enjoy your company in the mornings.”
“You alright, Harry?” Ron said as he watched Harry pick his fork around his food. He didn’t feel like eating. He didn’t feel like doing anything until Draco had seen him. Harry nodded and sighed.
Harry stumbles around, picking up little trinkets like he was doing only hours before, and Draco explains them, telling the story about whatever Harry had found. Then Harry’s eyes landed on Draco.
Draco trusts him.
Another short chapter, very sorry. I really hope you like this one.
“There are perks, Draco.”
“That’s the plan.” Harry says into the crease of where thigh meets pelvis. His breath is warm through the fabric of his underwear, and Draco wants it off.
“There are many strange things you could have told me tonight and I would have believed you, but you admitting feelings for a man was not one of them.” Adelaide muses, but her face is inscrutable.
His mother seems to enjoy scrutinising him on everything, these days, and he can’t go a couple seconds without a ‘Stand up straight, Draco’ or a very evil eye diverted his way every time he moves when he’s not supposed to.
Draco focuses back onto his own steps, twisting Celeste expertly and trying not to notice everyone’s attention on him.
“Merry Christmas.” He whispers to himself.
“Go as fast as possible.” Harry smirks.
Harry kisses his cheek and lets him get ready.
“Draco, even if I may not understand, I will listen. And I will help as much as I can.” She smiles, rubbing his arm.
“I just don’t understand why they would have such a vile tournament. I mean I’m all up for danger, but this seems extreme.” Draco stated.
Draco jumps off Juliet and rolls his trousers up, sinking his feet into the vast lake so he could cool down. It was rare for Draco to be at the lake two days in a row, but he couldn’t think of anything else to do rather than wallowing in self pity.
“Oh dear.” Harry laughs, joining Draco on the ground and spreading his limbs. He picks up a blade of grass and stars to shred it up.
It’s a realisation that comes so easily, as easy as breathing, as blinking. And Draco has no doubt that Harry doesn’t love him back. It’s not as though he just ‘likes’ him, now. It’s so much more. It’s the way he pretends he doesn’t lean in to him when they’re close, when they’re sitting together and he just watches. Admires. How Harry is just so stubborn, and he is too, and how there is no time for waiting because this is what he wants now.
“Hey! Great match, wasn’t it? Shame Harry lost but-“
“Oh bloody hell, I’m not getting murdered- who’s going to look after the family after I’m killed!” Ron said in a panic.
There’s something wrong, but Draco can’t put his finger on it.
“It’s just- The castle is so restricting!” Draco flopped back into his bed. “The lake and the beach is the only place I can go, and it gets boring staring at body’s of water for hours on end.”
“Oh get over it, Draco.”
What the fuck was Draco doing? Harry felt his breath pick up and he started to sweat. ‘No. Draco. No. Please. I thought we- I thought.’ Harry wanted to say. He wanted to shout it in Draco’s face until he understood.
in draco’s pov:
“THAT LETTER WAS ADDRESSED TO ME. LAST TIME I CHECKED, YOUR NAME WASN’T HARRY JAMES POTTER. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? WHY ARE YOU READING MY PERSONAL INFORMATION? I KNOW THINGS SUDDENLY CHANGED BETWEEN US BUT IT DOESN’T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO SEE IF I ACTUALLY MEANT IT. WHAT IF I DID, HUH? MAYBE I AM GAY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? YOU HAVE A PROBLEM? YES? WELL SORRY FOR YOU BUT DADDY CAN’T MAKE THE WORLD PERFECT.” Harry spat,  fuming.
Perhaps a bit more champagne will help him decide.
“Hello.” Draco says, for some reason almost shyly.
“Silence!” He shouted.
He turned to Harry, who was trying to smother a smile. “What did I say?” He said with a sigh and an over-exaggerated frown.
“Yes,yes...sorry Ada.” He apologises with nothing really behind it.
“She’s very well. Making sure I don’t muck anything up.”
Hello!!!
“I apologise for that, your majesty, I’m just quick to judge. I’m sure if Harry can befriend you then I see no reason why it would be any harder for me to.”
Draco’s heart plummets.
Draco looks between Narcissa and Lucius as Harry steps back. “What is he doing here?” He says, lifting his chin to return back to his perfect posture. He doesn’t know what’s gotten over him, but Draco blames the way he’s acting on Lucius, who hardly lets Draco confer with people outside the castle. Draco couldn’t care much about Harry being here, or at least, he could act like he didn’t care. Draco was a prince after all, he can be cold and demanding all he wanted. But he wasn’t sure if he wanted to be that to Harry.
“Oh yes, of course, I hadn’t mentioned. I am feeling slightly flustered to be honest... well anyway,” She said, smiling, her hand twisting excitedly through her dark blonde hair. “Your mother and father want to talk to you, my guess is about Sir Harry’s arrival. It should give you an answer to your questions. I haven’t heard much, though, he only arrived 15 minutes ago. Do tell me what the King and Queen say. They’re in the solar room. Would you like me to prepare you tea when you get back? I am sure you have a lot of letters for Celeste to be writing.” She nodded in question.
“Oh.” Was all the Harry could say. Even if he wanted to get up to fight his body would have protested.
Draco chose to ignore them and turned back to Harry, brushing off a layer of dust that sat on the table.
Harry reaches a hand out to help him up, but Draco’s tugs it. Harry doesn’t move an inch.
They slowly helped Harry up from his bed, and Draco pretended like he wasn’t bothered. But he was so happy for Harry that he could stand up. He had already shown off that he could when he made his way over to Harry’s bed. It was the only thing on Draco’s mind. That he and Harry Potter had shared a small hospital bed. And Harry didn’t move. But now Draco didn’t know what to do. He doesn’t know how to show affection. He got an occasional hug from his friends. And from his Mother. But he doesn’t know how. He had just shown Harry that he was interested in him, but now he couldn’t say anything. He doesn’t know what to do.
“Yeah, but it’s- It’s fine now.” Draco nodded, trying to push away his sadness.
Draco laughs humourlessly, “Already got one.” He wants to add ‘It’s called Celeste’ but that’s too horrible. He already feels bad for her.
He snickered behind his hand, trying to cover it up as a natural reflex.
Harry didn’t speak for a while, trying to comprehend that they were having a pretty normal human conversation without the use of their wands or having crowds of people watching.
There’s a faint chiming echoing from another part of the castle. Draco listens, and it’s the twelve o’clock bell.
They slipped back into the room after some bickering, and stared blankly at Draco’s face.
“It’s fine, Ron. I’m just showing Draco what it’s like to have fun.” Harry laughed.
“Absolutely not, Harry. I think we both know now I’m far from interested.” He laughs.
Enjoy the last chapter!
“Yeah, thanks.” Harry nodded but stopped immediately because he felt his neck would fall apart and he’d be the new Nearly Headless Nick.
“Are you so against the idea of you and him?”
“I took it this morning, was hoping I could visit James again later in the day.”
Harry shot awake. He was used to Hermione shouting him awake. He thought something was wrong. The last time he was woken up by a shouting voice the campground at the world cup was on fire.
I honestly don’t know how to stop myself so I’ve gone and written another chapter. This one is longer than chapter 3 so I hope it’s satisfactory!
Ron desperately looked between Harry and Hermione. “Am I the only sane person to exist? Harry, why would you even want to help him in the first place? Hasn’t he tortured you enough?” Ron accusingly said.
“You were looking for me.” He says, annoyed.
Celeste places her hand on Draco’s thigh, and Draco is so close to running away.
Draco inhales sharply at the mention of his name.
“Don’t expect to come into my castle and act like you own the place. And I don’t get fed grapes, thank you very much.” Draco said defensively.
Ron raised his eyebrows, his mouth twisting in hesitation. “It’ll cost you, mate. I know we normally do swords for free but we can’t give away the expensive items.”
“Hey, back off she’s old enough to be your Mother.” Draco snapped jokingly, but realised his mistake as the words came out of his mouth. “Oh I didn’t mean to- Bring up- Your-“ Draco started but couldn’t find the words. Apologising wasn’t like him. If someone disobeyed he’d get his Father on them. Draco never felt guilty about his words. But somehow Harry being here and talking to him, he felt inferior. Making Potter upset would only make him feel upset.
“What do you want, Potter?” Malfoy said, making Harry jump because he had thought that Malfoy was asleep.
“Oh shove off, Ada. You’re lucky you’re working while it’s going on, I’d rather do anything but sit in the box all day. My arse still hurts from Pierre!”
“Shall we?” He asks Celeste, indicating the space on the ballroom floor.
“Don’t worry, Ron, you’ll be fine. If anyone is getting killed it’ll be me.” Draco added over Ron’s panic, his face deadpanned.
He pulls Juliet up on a split second decision, wanting to see Harry as he comes back in. He jumps on quickly, pelting through the woods as fast as Juliet can go.
He carries on. “And that now I had been promised a wife, I’d get all that came with it. Children, a family. My own castle one day. This land being my own...” He stops, throat tightening and nausea rolling over him in waves. This is the first time he’s ever spoken about this to someone else, and saying it out loud was frightening. Harry reaches over and gives his hand a brief squeeze, taking his back quickly after. Draco’s throat is working again but now his heart is beating a thousand times a second. “Adelaide knows. I think she figured out before me.”
“It’s just weird.” Hermione said, before her face dropped in horror. “I mean- Malfoy- not that Prince Draco is weird, of course not, it’s just him being here. And his Father letting him out the castle.” She added, not looking towards Draco.
“It was taken from their house when they died, and they never rightfully returned it.” Draco explains. “If I’d have known, I would have taken it earlier.”
“Ah.” Draco coughs roughly, and then they sit in silence, just staring.
“I’ll be seen.” Draco snapped back in Harry’s change of tone. As much as he’d like for Harry to get in trouble for being a disobedient git, he wouldn’t like to be in the same amount of trouble himself. He had successfully been able to sneak out to the lake and the beach without getting noticed, and he didn’t want his frequent visits to end abruptly.
“Well thank you very much.” Draco replies, and then holds out two hands to haul Harry up. “Now, we’re going to my library, because you’re half-drunk and so am I and I am pretty much done with this castle.” He says indignantly.
He breathed quietly, listening to the silence of the hospital. He grabbed his wand and cast a lumos, getting out a book that Hermione left him. He would never normally read, but he got so bored and he knew that there was not point trying to move around.
“Congrats mate, again.” Ron smiled, slapping Harry on the shoulder.
“Harry?” He says, moving around the sofa as he watched the green-clad figure pass by again. He walked out into the door and finds Harry peering out the window.
“Now come on, we have to be back for dinner.” Harry said excitedly.
“I have so many questions! How’s the castle? Are the bedrooms nice? Is Draco Malfoy actually as snooty as they say?”
“I think the firebolt is the least of my worries, Ron” Harry managed to chuckle before needing to cough.
“What’s the ‘Oh’ for?” He says, slightly defensively.
Out of all the places he thought he’d end up, standing outside the common room for the knights chambers was not one of them. He’d never actually been inside before, and never plans to. Being surrounded by burly men was threatening, but then again...
“There’s always a first for everything.” Harry laughs, shuffling down so that his legs weren’t intertwined with Draco’s anymore.
“You know, I thought you would be a stuck up brat when I first came.”
“Thank you, Prince Draco.” Hermione said, bowing her head. Ron did the same.
He knocked on the door to the first back room, hoping and praying that Ron would be the one to answer so he could avoid drawing attention from the rest of the red-heads. But things never really went the way Draco wants them too, so when the door opened after a second of waiting, an older women with striking ginger hair answered, and her mouth completely dropped.
