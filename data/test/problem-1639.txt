“Prince Lokison of Asgard.”
TITS- Tactful Intervention Through Socialization
The girls descended into giggles at the mean sentiments. Harry shared a glance with his friends, it was obvious who they were gossiping about. After all, there was only one female not included in the group.
Just what had Harry been put through when they had parted ways?
Yet more research he would have to conduct because he knew and accepted that he really wouldn’t be able to make himself leave this be. Perhaps he had been enchanted, but most people didn’t realize that they had been. So if he was considering it, then surely it meant that Harry was not trapped under some spell.
An icy chill rolled down Harry’s frame at the reminder, how could he so easily have forgotten that horrifying moment? The void that seemed to have opened under his seat and threatened to plunge him into never ending sorrow yet held a sweet promise of release from everything else?
“Deal.”
“Draco and I will be returning to the tower, as I know that you do not trust us to be in your home alone. I will swear to you that we will remain in Thor’s quarters.” Loki offered, one hand clasping over Draco’s shoulder ready to teleport them away.
“It has been stated in multiple reports from witnesses from the night before that Lord Black was seen dueling with the attackers and aiding the injured.” Shacklebolt affirmed, not reacting to the stink eye the squat witch sent him.
I do not speak Latin so this is not a perfect translation, if any one wants to provide me with a better one I'd be more than happy to hear and edit it in.
Setting up the same scene as the night before from memory was far easier than Harry thought it would be. From the bag he summoned the four purple candles that he set evenly around himself, the silver stone goblet which he filled with water to hold in his left hand, his wand being held in his right.
Breath suddenly seemed to come much harder for Harry as he realized what Draco said was all too true. The Ministry wouldn’t care for what reason Harry was trying to study dark magic. Memories of the disgust, fear, and anger his friends had shown last year in the train car and then the shedding room came to mind as well. If he continued on this path, he really was throwing his lot in with those of the dark. He would face the same punishments.
“Did my mum and dad know, they couldn’t have, right?” Harry’s anger and fear made him automatically reach for the most cutting accusations. The most vicious retorts he could think of. “Maybe Pettigrew wasn’t the only traitor!”
Harry hissed back, barely able to keep his voice in check as for the second time today someone had alluded to Harry having feelings deeper than curiosity towards a boy he hadn’t even spoken to!
Harry had managed to secure the position of seeker and while he loved the game, the jostling and mess of the party was not to his taste. He had called the night early and managed to escape before clothes started to fall off of the older students. Most of the younger years were banished to the dorm rooms before the
Again I forgot to add a link to the song that Draco was singing and dancing to the link is now posted back on the last chapter and at the beginning of this chapter.
Harry didn’t wait to hear what else the werewolf said as he hurried down the hall, having memorized most of the professor and prefect patrols over the years to know which staircases and halls to avoid.
Again if you are not playing this game, it's alright, these characters while they are important anything that needs explanation will be done in the story so don't worry about it.
Many people, both past and present, demanded the absolution of the Slytherin house entirely from Hogwarts. Dumbledore wouldn’t hear it and most likely the castle wouldn’t stand for it either.
When Ron and Neville finally pulled themselves out of sleep and finished getting ready to head out for breakfast, Harry was on pins and needles ready to see Sirius’ answer to his letter, which he had sent the night before. Ron and Neville had also sent word back home. All three of them had given their letters, penned during the end of dinner, to Remus to mail. As first years, they had to immediately go back to their dorm after the feast to hear the house rules, expectations, and sort through their new living arrangements.
Displeasure and irritation flared inside of Harry with such a sudden fury that it almost knocked the breath out of him. Thuban had reared up from where he was hiding in the blankets to stare at his master as Harry tried desperately to calm himself down.
“And how do you suppose to help me if you are part of the very problem?” As soon as the words left his lips, Draco felt the desperate need to take them back, to shove them back down his throat so they never saw the light of day. But it was too late and guilt tugged at him at the crushed look that had taken over the mortal’s face. Now there was that emotion that Draco had very little experience with, though he could still name it.
Draco did not answer, staying faced forward and not addressing the other wizard.
Still, as the dizziness and slingshot feeling of the portkey travel ebbed away, Harry was able to see the bustle and noise that was the camping grounds, he felt the contagious energy of the place bleed into himself as he laughed with his friends and they raced towards the spot they would claim as their own for the night. The inside of the magic tent was as incredible as it was huge. After dropping their bags on the beds that would be theirs, Molly called for everyone to help with the preparation of lunch.
. While her eldest wasn’t moved as he seemed to argue back and Mrs. Weasley had to take her stress out by cooking, it had worked perfectly for the trio’s plan to go undiscovered until nightfall.
The conversation back at the upgraded Avengers tower continued relatively painlessly after both Peter and Draco had left. Thor carried most of the conversation for both himself and his brother as Loki wasn’t very invested in doing much more than gathering information as the heroes spoke of the current happenings of Midgard since Thor’s latest absence. There was the usual cropping up of villians that thought they could get revenge on the world that wronged them somehow or looking for a way to get rich or pull a ‘Loki’ and subgulate humanity.
“Get some sleep, pup. We’ll talk in the morning about your punishment with Moony.”
The boy huffed, stepping out of the wispy tail’s range and turning his attention instead to the approaching creatures. The skeletal horses greeted the human with short, clipped cries and seemed to delight in the same attention that the Granian received. The boy moved through the bony forms without hesitation, pale hands contrasting against their dark hides as he seemed to be checking over each creature in turn.
“Woah! Hey, we didn’t say “go” yet!” The mortal cried, trying to keep his balance in the precarious position, the metal of Draco’s blade hovering a mere centimeter above the fabric of the suit that stretched over his chest.
So what about Arthur Weasley being both an employee of the Ministry and a lord. While this isn't unheard of, it is uncommon as physical ground work and pencil pushing is seen as beneath noble class. This is another point of scorn that some old families have towards the redheaded family. The Weasleys and some other higher middle class families do have jobs to subsidize their income. These jobs though are usually outside of the Ministry, such as owning their own businesses and organizing trade contracts. Percy is continuing the tradition of working in the Ministry not only for his income, but having observed his father, he knows he will learn more of the going on's of society and hear more whispers if he is not restricted to the main chamber for meetings.
So if you enjoyed this chapter, please leave a comment, it'd really help me out and cheer me up.
Finally, Draco called for an end to the chant and cleared the area quickly of the magical objects, pouring the dark liquid in the cup on the dead spots in the grass before returning to Harry, though keeping his distance.
It was a girl, one with a dreamy expression on her face and pale blond locks that cascaded down her back. Her crooked blue and grey tie declared her a Ravenclaw and as Harry got his heart rate back under control, he realized that he knew this girl. Luna Lovegood, a first year that was good friends with Ron’s younger sister, Ginny Weasley. They had crossed paths often enough over the years as the Lovegoods had lived close by the Weasleys, but Harry had never spoken in depth with the girl. Of course there were plenty of rumors about both Luna and her father, who ran a quirky magazine called the Quibbler. Most people said that they were off their rockers and believed in creatures that couldn’t possibly exist.
“I don’t know, but we’re going to find out.” Harry muttered while rubbing at his side gently, Thuban had bit him, but he didn’t feel any fear about the venom. Like many snakes, adders could decide to inflict ‘dry’ bites. There was no point in wasting precious venom on things that were too big for them to eat, but they could still defend themselves with their fangs against predators.
This had to be a nightmare, Voldemort was dead, they shouldn’t be… this shouldn’t be happening.
“How dare you, Sirius’ achievements have amounted to more than what the Smith name could ever claim to.” Harry hissed, hinting back to the boy’s desperate clinging to being the descendent of Helga Hufflepuff. The Smiths had little other merits then being related to a person long dead and whining in their seat in the Wizengamot.
“I think that my parts would make for fantastic ingredients. They’d make for the most excellent love potions.” Blaise quipped and while the black hood covered his head, one could practically hear how the dark-skinned wizard’s eyebrows wiggled with his words.
Ron and Neville pulled a face, Ron asking in confusion, “Why would you wonder about that?”
The offer was not in line with anything that Loki predicted, but he followed the man towards the bar, “I suppose I should collect before it expires. Though your alcohol is abysmal compared to the Asgardian standard.”
It was a completely unplanned and unspoken agreement that those who regularly attended would rise in defense of the professors if the needling went on too long.
“I didn’t take justice into my own hands, Ms. Farrel, Loki did.” Tony pointed out. “In accordance with the terms of our treaty with Asgard, if a grave offense is conducted against representatives of the Golden Realm, the kings of Asgard are within their right to exact retribution by their ways. It would be within Thor and Loki’s right to demand the heads of these individuals on the chopping block.”
“Bloody hell, remind me not to get her truly angry.” Ron whispered in awe and Harry couldn’t help but agree. Neville was laughing under his breath even as he used the spell e
Garnet: Legends and folklore place garnet among the most ancient of talismans. Not only was it prized as an ornamental jewel, but its strong curative powers and protective energies made it invaluable. Garnet is also known for its utilization of creative energy. It grounds spirit forces within the body and helps in the ability to work lovingly on the physical plane. Yet Garnet is a sensual stone. It represents primordial fire, the creation of the world out of chaos, purification and love. It is a stone of strong, intense feelings. In Europe during the Middle Ages, Garnet was used to enhance truth, faith and constancy, and to dispel melancholy.
Typically Draco would rather chew on wormwood than go to Regulus for help, but after a week, he approached his cousin for any other books on runes. The only others that weren’t kept on the shelves normally were Regulus’ old books from his school days. The Black disliked them for the fact that they contained modern, simplified versions of certain runes that Regulus thought of as inelegant.
It clicked in Harry’s mind the same moment that there were a few rapid pulses from the hidden journal in his robe. Draco no doubt becoming impatient with his lack of response when he knew that Harry should be retired to the privacy of his bed curtains by now.
“Touche.” Pucey acquises.
On the map it said that there should be nothing here, if anything the portrait should have opened into a window facing the grounds to the east. A window that would have plummeted them all down five stories to their deaths. Having grown up with magic, it wasn’t such a stretch for Harry to expect  to find in reality, but he could hear Hermione sputtering behind him at the lack of logistics for the space.
It was with difficulty that the group reached the place marked on the map. They would move a few feet forward and one of the group would get confused, asking the others where they were and why they were there. Or a person would be overwhelmed with dread and fear, Fred had to tackle Ginny to the ground and cover her mouth as she suddenly began fighting to run back the way they came and screaming for apparently no reason. There were feelings that what they were doing was pointless: that there would be nothing waiting for them. One by one each of the group suffered some kind of experience, never all at once, but enough to cause great delay and constant fear of discovery. The only ones not affected were Luna and Harry, the reason why, he wasn’t sure, but he believed that his turn was simply coming up.
, Harry’s plans changed again into wanting to understand how he could be different from the other. Now, he had gone so far as to attempt to learn Dark magic from a dangerous individual that he only held the word of. Mutual blackmail and information that they each wanted from the other, had stretched then into companionship.
The magic in the air hummed and visibly shuttered before it swirled into solid, but partly transparent, shapes. Three black ravens hovered in the air, the one in the center of which clasped a skull in its talons. Their small dark eyes and the endless eye sockets of the skull seemed to bore into and through Sirius.
“Severus does not need your encouragement, mother!”
“So, his mum just pulled him out of school? Just like that?” Neville asked, eyes wide. Young witches and wizards needed to be in school until they came of age to learn how to control their core. If she sent Dean to another magical school there wouldn’t be much of an issue, but if she was panicked by their world in general then everyone was going to suffer.
The tone was high and lilting, the voice would hold the note, before dropping swiftly down, then it would rise once more. There was no set pattern, each combination was different, but no less beautiful. The notes seemed to hover in a range just out of what might normally be played on an instrument or be sung. A halftone, was that even a thing? Harry had been taught piano, but music wasn’t something that could hold his attention when he was the one being forced to produce it. Listening was far better than playing in his opinion.
SO yeah, Molly and Ted are both going to want Harry(and the other children) to get more healer training after this incident. The kid may have made the right decision, but we need to highlight the fact that they are
The lyrical words that came out of Draco’s mouth were French in origin meaning ,though changed slightly in pronunciation to be used as a spell: bind, copy, keep, my companion. French was one of the languages that Harry had been made fluent with since a young age under Sirius’ lessons.
The two girls flinched at the challenge, falling silent quickly. Still the atmosphere between the group was friendly and teasing, Draco placed a hand to his forehead as he spoke with a dramatic tone. “Please do not do this to me! Do not ruin one of the few times in the year I’m allowed out while not being covered up to my ears in fabric.”
The sounds had the herd moving faster and Harry was just as eager to increase his pace as they weaved between trees and thick brush with surprising quietness. Then the trees were opening up before them, it was not a simple clearing that was revealed, no this was an entire valley alight with balls of fire born of the will o wisp spell, torches, and massive bonfires. A babbling river ran on one side of the clearing and the water was full of wreaths of flowers and candles that were charmed to stay in place against the flow of the river and to resist both wind and water from dousing their lights.
“What about you, do you go to… school?” It felt like a lame question, but Harry was interested in how Draco’s daily life, the daily going on’s of dark children, might differ from his own.
magical folk into doing what they wanted… By any means necessary.
The other three members of the hut seemed to be hooked on Harry’s words and even Fang’s ears perked up in interest as the mood seemed to shift.
That and Remus’ enhanced sense of smell as a werewolf, but Harry didn’t add that as he nodded his head.
Please comment, they really make my day and keep my fingers typing~
Lee snickered as the pranksters were quickly reduced into pleading for mercy as Hermione’s new half-kneazle, Crookshanks, leaped off of her lap and swiped at the two when Fred and George had leaned in too close during their performance. The bookworm seemed very pleased with her pet’s actions, stroking his long fluffy orange fur before coaxing him back into her lap.
Harry will have a difficult time deciding the definition of 'evil'.
The potion’s classroom was basically a live bomb with potential explosions brought about by one extra pinch on an ingredient or a misread step. The stress of watching forty students at once with such dangerous ramifications and the fact that an accident in Hogwarts would follow them throughout their careers meant that not many people wanted the position either. Working in medical services was far more appealing and typically safer. John Dawlish wasn’t a potions master, but an auror that the Ministry and Dumbledore had talked into the position because of his high N.E.W.T.s scores. His strict training as an auror was what made everyone hopeful that he would last and be successful in the position.
Loki had gotten sick of the wait the next time it happened and promptly carried the tiny blond, kicking and screaming back out to train the following day.
Despite all of this, Draco felt more relaxed than he had since he left his godly guardians’ sides.
The redheads then leaped into action to send a barrage of tickling hexes at the dark skinned half-blood who practically squealed as he jerked about in his seat with nowhere to escape as he fumbled with his wand with jerking fingers. Between gasps he managed to send an
“Earwigging on conversations, are you?” Sirius growled with a wince, Harry had become too clever it seemed and he didn’t have the heart to
“Polyjuice has been labeled as a banned dark potion because it requires part of the human body. The potion doesn’t work when used to transform into animals, magical beings, or creatures. There is no transfiguration to turn a person into a house elf either. A glamor upon the body would easily have been removed and felt through.” Sirius mused, offering the information of his own free will and watching as the present company lapped it up like starving hounds. It was common knowledge for a potion master and anyone who had paid relative attention in school to know.
Draco let his eyes close as the brush moved smoothly through his hair, feeling as the soft bristles gently skidded across his scalp before moving back and down all the way to the end of the locks. From the crown of his head, from the sides, the brush was search for any tangle. Long, nimble fingers carefully removed the rare find that were caught. He could tell when she was satisfied with her work when she gently tugged and pressed on the left side of his head. Draco rolled his eyes behind his lids as he knew that his mother had decided to braid his hair.
Also, we have Sirius quoting Snape from the first book.
“The Lupin arrived two hours ago he did.”
“The wee birdies sing and the wildflowers spring, and in sunshine the waters are sleeping.”
Sirius wondered if he really did as he gently urged Harry off of the couch and towards the youth’s bedroom. “Come on, let’s get ya in the shower and then to bed. I gotta head out again soon to see Mrs. Diggory and I plan to check on Ron at Saint Mungo’s before daylight.”
“It’s not so dissimilar to what I’m doing now. This pipette allows me a far more efficient way for controlling the timing and measuring of liquid ingredients.” Severus answered shortly, truly he was embarrassed for reacting in even the minute way he did.
Notes:
“Granians are herbivores while thestrals are carnivores, I doubt that they would naturally choose to mate. The ministry has a ban on experimental breeding of both plants and creatures.” Neville added, while Ron had little interest in the politics that both of his parents were involved in, Neville and Harry had already began to study them. Ron was one of many children and it was more likely that one of his brothers would be chosen as the next Lord Weasley or Lord Prewett. Harry and Neville were the only heirs to their families on the other hand.
Loki reached forward, tucking a now pale blond strand of hair back behind the boy’s ear as he spoke. “He would have suffered far more without my interference.”
“It’s all a ridiculous notion,” The potions master continued. “Any dark potioneer worth his salt knows that babies are useless for ingredients. The magic in their blood is too underdeveloped to have any significant degree of potency. The blood of virgins’ is best collected from someone of or above the age of majority.”
It took time for the three to grow close, but soon Loki and Draco had become inseparable with their similar personalities and passions when it came to all facets of sorcery. Loki adored his descendant, that much was obvious in his treatment of him, but he was not afraid to punish the boy if he stepped out of line with swift strikes and cutting words.
“That ’a good thing?” Peter thought it was best to check.
“Don’t waste your breath, it’s obvious now that we have been too lenient with the youth if they have become jaded towards peace.” The larger rider snapped back, making Draco flinch at the harshness of his tone, then with a click of his heels into Vielantiu’s sides the stallion was off, taking four quick fast strides before lifting himself up into the air with powerful beats of his wings.
Harry blinked slowly, the words sluggishly registering in his head as the shadow continued to loom over him. It was Draco’s voice that came out of the specter’s ‘mouth’. Even with the lack of facial features, Harry swore that he was being almost looked through with the intensity it seemed to radiate.
A huff escaped Draco and he was obviously trying to compose himself: Harry was trying to wrap his mind about the knowledge that had just been shared. Salazar Slytherin, he was a well known dark wizard, but apparently another of the founders had been a practitioner as well. That was something to ponder at a later date.
It was interesting, sure, but Harry was burning to know what they had planned to create such drama and would have them eluding to rather graphic pitfalls.
Notes:
“Oh?”
Draco nodded his head softly, though internally he was not convinced, for his family though, he would act that all was well. That he was still the naive child that believed every word that he was fed by an adult, for a little while longer.
“Because you were raised by Lord Black of course, and you’re, well, you!” Khanna answered, her glasses having fallen far down her nose when she stopped and pushed them back into place.
to, even if he only had a few hours to do so now.
“Weren’t you angry? Betrayed? Afrai-” Harry felt the words lodged in his throat as he wondered if this was not how Draco would feel when,
Draco began again as he let go of Blaise’s hand to spin around the edge of the ring of people that the coven had created, hands gesturing, no imploring would be a better word. “We are the folk and we have the right! To stand up and to fight for an independent life. We are the force. We are the might. And we will stand up for an independent life!”
“Just to what, Sirius. To spend more time with you, to learn more about you? You’re still keeping so much of yourself away from me because you’re afraid I’ll be scared off by what I’ll see.” Remus was growling, “Have you not seen what I turn into once or twice a month?”
The battle was ended abruptly with the sound of a snap echoing and the force of magic that ripped the siblings away from each other.
“With pleasure Lord Potter-Black!” Chorused the twins, jerking their prey out of sight and down the hall cackling.
“Parents have been sending untraceable portkeys through the mail, Flitwick and Slughorn have been secretly handing them out as well to get them out. The ghosts know of many secret passageways out of the castle and are taking some of the children through those.” Snape muttered, silently he was glad that the old potions’ professor had finally decided on a side and knew how desperately they would need another brewer if they were going to be cut away from most medical resources.
“Is that-” Ron started to ask as he did a double take over his shoulder at the other boys.
“It’s Luna, who knows. More than thirty aurors searched Hogwarts from top to bottom after the dark practitioners fled, it seems odd that none of them would notice those wards outside or discovered this room.” Ginny answered as she followed her friend to another area that the twins were investigating.
Sirius yelped as he got a kick under the table by his brother, “Watch your language, you’re a lord now and I won’t have my head speaking like a commoner. Father would take you over his knee if he heard you.”
“I told you to go to bed when I did last night.” Remus reminded before turning to his own food.
Well, practice makes perfect.
“We are…in the process of producing a solution to the matter.” there was sweat collecting at the collar of the Minister’s shirt now as he glanced as his company, “I do believe that will be all, thank you for your hospitality and cooperation, Lord Black.” Fudge’s voice sounded strained with the last few words, like he had to grunt them out.
In the movies: The scene from Riddle House had Crouch Jr. already freed and that the attack at the cup was encouraged by Voldemort's whispering.
If Dean was there, the group of three would have been divided into pairs.
It made Sirius’ head spin: there was no book. All of them with questionable material had been hidden away or taken by Regulus. So then, how?
“I’ll have you know I passed my Concealment and Disguise during training without any studying at all! The Stealth and Tracking parts are just the parts I... well, struggled with.” Tonks countered flailing a little until the large man set her down with a shake of his head.
year old often does this. I have, I’ll do the spell, I just need your blood.” Draco pressed while using a quick spell to heal his finger.
Unfortunately, Mr. Stark wasn’t at all thrilled by what the age alluded to, his eyes narrowed as he asked while setting his glass down a little harder than necessary on the table.
“Do we know why?” Worry creeped it’s way into Harry’s heart once more. Had the medi-wizards and witches found something? Was Dean safe or in danger still? Would Dean even be in this situation if Harry hadn’t invited him and Seamus to his birthday party and as a result got them tickets to see the World Cup?
Rubbing at his temple and knowing a headache was incoming, Harry couldn’t help but grumble as the memory was stowed away, “Are we done yet?”
If you want to know what Regulus' Grim form looks like:
“I know, Dobby told me when he brought tea.” Narcissa chuckled as Draco cursed under his breath about traitorous house elves, “Now, now, he seemed completely distraught when he realized he said such. Poor thing looked ready to swallow the teapot in penance.”
“You don’t have to work, and you know it, you practically sneeze out galleons with the family fortune. Also, Wizengamot meetings only take place a few times a month.” Remus snipped back, getting a snicker from Harry.
"Why is this room can't be opened?" Draco was still trying to open the door at the bottom of the stairs.
"Your Majesty, have you ever been in love?"
Regardless of the politeness he'd maintained so far, Draco hurriedly pulled his face away in a rough motion, so Terence's index finger was no longer touching his chin.
Draco closed his eyes for a moment, trying to make sense of all of this. Mr. Flitwick died from being killed by the demon Abaddon who looked like a human. What should Draco do? The police will definitely suspect him while he was calling an emergency call for help. And now, he is in another place. How did Draco explain all this mess to the police?
"Less than five minutes after I walked in," Draco argued in a whisper.
"I'm very happy that Your Majesty showed me his concern. Your Majesty doesn't need to worry. After this dance, I'm going straight back to the Richmond manor." Charles's words were met with a faint nod from Draco.
"But I doubt it because the gods only employ Demigods or Titans and creatures like Centaurs and Satyrs. You're human, so you can't. Unless—" Alastair seemed hesitant to continue.
Draco sighed. The young man's slender hands then moved to release Cedric's strong grip that was very comfortable adorning Draco's waist. "Prince Cedric, people will think bad if you keep doing this," Draco said as he glanced at his surroundings out of the corner of his eye. Thankfully, none of the guests' eyes were on them.
Instantly, the atmosphere in the small house cooled. Both Harry and Cedric flashed their hostile gazes. Even the healer bandaged the wound on Draco's neck felt all the hairs on his neck stand on end.
Was this some kind of prank on television? The producer was outrageous for making jokes like this. After all, he was Draco Malfoy—a popular actor whose name was nominated for an Oscar yesterday! Draco, who was furious, promised to sue the producers, including his manager, who let this happen to him. Draco might still be able to tolerate ordinary pranks like being in a hidden camera magic show. But they even knocked him out and maybe even poisoned him to the point that he had difficulty moving his body.
"Good," Harry muttered with satisfaction, then called the waiter over for dessert and coffee. "I want a truce."
"What happened? I made a clear agreement with your father." Ares was a little angry.
"Your Majesty, wasn't your previous act too rude? I was just astonished to see it from afar, even though that man is your brother-in-law..."
"Draco!!"
The God of War was right. Draco knew nothing about royal family dining etiquette in ancient Greece. That era was still arguably primitive, in contrast to the more modern medieval ages. Maybe dinner activities in the royal family are more flexible than they are today. Draco could see Ares' subordinates eating with them in the same room. They chat, joke and laugh. They ate greedily and devoured all that bland food without any leftovers. Their way through the dinner was messy but fun.
But Draco's memory back to the night of the accident, now engraved vividly in his memory that Harry really embraced him that night, hugged him tightly, and endured the crashes to protect him. Maybe if it weren't for Harry's hug, Draco's body would have been thrown, and then it wasn't just his head that was injured.
He took a deep breath. He didn't know how to answer Arabelle's question, but he was very grateful that Harry suddenly came up to them and asked Arabelle to ride the same horse with him. The queen was thankful that Harry had interrupted the conversation between himself and Arabelle for the first time.
Draco turned his head to find Icarus standing beside the chair he was sitting on. The sword behind his back was still there as if Icarus couldn't separate from it.
Dionysius had already stood up and laughed awkwardly before joining the other gods. He realized that he might be the cause of Ares' irritation this time. Dion had told Ares earlier that if the War God was tired of the Prince of Sparta, he was willing to take him to work in his palace to help him. The Wine God meant no harm and respected Ares' power over the prince. He didn't want to offend him, but Ares became emotional and flatly refused Dionysius' offer.
"I'm not wearing my glamour, you idiot," said Harry.
"You comment too much." Ron started the car engine and started to drive the car out of the packhouse. "You haven't tried it yet."
Now, he has learned to understand that not everything he thinks is good will always be good and will not hurt him. Draco had begun to volunteer to let go of what he had always dreamed of; Harry wants to change and be a better man to be with him.
Draco was stunned by Harry's apology. He looked at Harry carefully. Harry Potter apologizes! What was Draco's dream last night? "Why are you apologizing?"
Draco snorted nonchalantly. "Too confident as usual,"
"That's impossible. Ares wouldn't do it for me," Draco shook his head.
The atmosphere in the club was tranquil. Incredibly quiet. Even the fierce music stopped as everyone stopped doing their activities and stared at Draco, standing and panting in front of Harry as the man sitting on his VIP couch. A second later, a rough hand gripped Draco's arm. So harsh that it made Draco scream.
Draco bit his lower lip as he felt a strange sensation start to creep upon him. He didn't know what this sensation was called. Draco was experiencing something this crazy for the first time as a sudden heat rose between his thighs.
"A-Ah, yes..." Draco opened his mouth, a little nervous.
There was a picture of a woman standing in the middle of a rose garden, with a pink dress and long, shiny dark brown hair, laughing happily, as if she couldn't help but smile at whoever took the picture. The woman hugged her slightly distended stomach. She was pregnant. The woman looked happy… full of love, and to Draco's great surprise, the woman's face…. The woman's face... resembled Draco.
Who could have guessed, a young man as perfect as Draco read a vulgar book? Really, Harry felt like laughing.
Draco was devastated, devastated when he saw Harry Potter, the lover he trusted so much, sending private messages to a girl he said was just a close friend.
Draco stared at the other man or at least tried hard to make his eyes focus. "I'm... what happened to me?"
The two nobles walked hand in hand towards the shady tree in the middle of the blue flower bed. A sense of calm immediately greeted the two of them when they were under the tree, which turned out to be very big.
"Why are you taking me out to dinner?" finally, Draco broke the silence with his question.
Even though they'd tried to deal with the heat by installing cool marble and designing every room with tall columns and niches—it didn't really help.
"I see. Your Majesty admires my sword more than my face," said Cedric formally, which invited laughter from the other guards.
"Put me down, crazy villain!" Draco shouted loudly, trying to grab the attention of anyone who might be around him. Draco saw several servants witnessing the kidnapping but was reluctant to take action. After all, Hector was popular as one of the top Generals. Moreover, there were rumors that the prince had turned insane since he recovered circulated in the palace area.
"I'm sorry if I upset you," the distinctive voice sounded from the door. "But I'm still alive."
Perhaps Ares can be equated with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president of his time. The difference was that Ares was older, more experienced, more dangerous, and more handsome.
“P-Potter... Please, I’m going to—” before his orgasm arrived, though, Harry pulled out completely with a satisfied look.
Draco was thoughtful for a moment, watching the other boy's hands still grasping his. "Just so you know," Draco finally began to reply, "As friends, Pansy and Blaise have given their blessing," Draco frowned in disbelief. "Because of my stupidity, they know if I... I like you... too,"
The noise from the entrance distracted Draco, his eyes searching, and…there he was! The man was there, with his furious arrival surrounded by tons of muscular bodyguards. Without realizing it, Draco snorted. Well, since he's a bad guy who likes hurting people, he must have a lot of enemies who want to kill him.
"That—the mosquito bit me. I scratched it because it felt itchy," Draco answered quietly.
The temple of Athena stood majestically not far from Sparta's palace and was surrounded by densely populated houses. The temple looks alive and though sometimes lonely—never completely empty.
Like a lion who doesn't like its obsession disturbed, Harry casts his sharp gaze on the crown prince as the guy gives him a surprised look. The response was the same as the response of the guests in the ballroom.
He's on fire.
"Why are you looking at me like that?" Draco finally reveals what was on his mind.
"They're both pathetic," added Pansy, shaking her head in concern.
"Why?"
Harry kissed Draco's wrists. "You are mine, remember that. If you try to run away again, I will punish you with more harsh punishment.” Then Harry got up, put on his clothes, and stared at Draco, who looked away and didn't want to look at him. "I hope you don't forget what we've done tonight, every second of it," he muttered coldly, then walked away, leaving Draco lying still on the bed.
"You should be grateful," Harry puffed.
"We've made a clear message. Even their strongest warrior can't beat the five messengers of Ares."
Tired of all the tension, he looked around the large, hall-like room with a throne in it. He saw familiar faces in Troya's memory. His older sisters, as well as the sons and daughters of the concubines. There was no genuine sorrow in their faces. Troya was not close to his siblings. Troya's parents were calling their whole family tonight for a farewell dinner.
“Sir,” Seamus interrupted, ready to leave the house. "I'm just relaying what I've been assigned. If you have any questions, maybe you can contact Harry directly." And Seamus left, leaving Draco still dumbfounded and confused, looking at the files in front of him.
Draco's hair bristled. This man named Hyde sounded so terrifying.
Alden's face hardened. "You mustn't do it. I won't allow it because it would hurt master Harry."
A happy smile spread across the face of the King of Delion. "If Your Majesty likes it, I can send it to the Shinia Kingdom. Maybe it will cost a little more—"
"I'll take you later. Right now, there are more important things for you to do, prince of Sparta. Take a shower. You are very messy right now. Today is your first dinner with Ares." Alastair said in a serious tone as if he was preparing Draco to go to war.
A dilemma weighed on Draco's chest. "Why me? Why don't you look for—" he paused. "Another
Draco couldn't move. His body was getting limp and lost a lot of blood. The sun has risen when Draco lost consciousness.
Harry paused and gave Draco a frustrated look. "Okay. Treat him first!" he murmured coldly.
Harry shrugged. "Maybe to buy time."
Draco settles his hands on his waist, trying to look menacing. "I don't
Draco couldn't stand the cold that rushed over him. He then closed his eyes tightly and gently stroked his arm, which felt very cold, even his two slender legs were shivering violently.
Harry roughly pushed Draco outside and then pushed him to the end of the balcony so that Draco's head was pointing down and staring with horror at the enormous swimming pool below. The pool looked very clear and deep. Draco shivered. He can't swim. Will Harry push him down? Harry literally pushed Draco's body to the end of the balcony, causing his head to bend downward, Draco's arm restrained by Harry behind him.
In contrast to Natalie, who, as much as possible, displays a portrait of a harmonious husband and wife who love each other, Draco can only slip his hand to hold Harry's strong-arm gently. They don't show anyone that they are a harmonious couple. Still, every time someone sees the two of them, they would say Draco and Harry were the perfect couples over the past few decades.
It's been almost an hour since Draco has been locked up in this room. The luxurious white room, the carpet, the bed, all the furniture was even white. Draco was disgusted by the thought that perhaps Harry's previous lovers had also been placed in this room.
He never felt short of a good man willing to date him, so he didn't give up easily and was reluctant to fully gave his heart. His teenage years were also busy with filming and school activities which made him miss the passionate teenage years. Draco knew that in time he would meet someone who truly deserved him. Not a man he'd only met for a day, especially when his soul was in another man's body like now!
"Your Majesty, don't you think something strange about His Royal Highness and that stepmother?" Glenice asked Draco when they had stepped out of the garden.
"Yes,"
"How dare you to hit Mr. Potter!!" shouted a deep, harsh voice. Draco turned his head and found himself embroiled in a large man who appeared to be one of Harry's bodyguards.
Really, for some reason, Draco looked so adorable in Charles's eyes. Now, his jealousy of Harry grew even more. As if God was not content to give Harry a large and prosperous kingdom, God also gave someone as perfect as Draco to accompany Harry.
"You always challenge me until I have to hold myself to the limit of my patience. Your attitude makes me sick!"
Harry rolled his body next to Draco, the soft hospital bed making their bodies pressed against each other. Harry's hand grasped Draco's fingers, then guided the fingers to his cock.
"You mean Potter triggered the devil to approach me?" Draco asked.
"28 years, I'm almost ten years older than you," The Demigod smirked.
The man managed to grab Draco's hand again and pulled him. "You can't get close to Potter. He's a dangerous creature." The man's wings moved up and down, making Draco's eyes follow the beat.
Draco gritted his teeth. He desperately wanted to fight his father, but he realized that he would lose his position as queen if he kept fighting. Not only would he lose his position, but Draco would also lose the love of his people.
Draco shook his head calmly. "I'll bring someone to learn to love you, but not me." he offered.
But a few seconds later, Cedric straightened his back and looked at Draco with a hardy look before he uttered a sentence that made Draco even more frustrated.
"Master Harry never destroyed your father's company, let alone bankrupted your father," Alden shrugged. “You may not believe it, but you can look for information anywhere. What master did was not bankrupt companies. He helped companies on the verge of bankruptcy and revived them. Many of the companies he has taken over have become many times more advanced thanks to my master's greatness."
Harry drew out his fingers and wiped them on Draco's cheek, making Draco's body shiver. "My man make their own decisions and mix the drug in your drink,"
"That's my problem, Troya. You don't have to worry. No one will be able to force you out of here." Ares smiled, but Draco sensed insincerity from him.
Troya must find an opening where he can escape. Maybe he could pay Ares' envoys to let him go or have his loyal servants tether a horse on the slopes of the Olympus mountains. The problem was he doesn't know the truth. It was possible that they wouldn't take him to Olympus, but to some other place, he didn't know. After all, Olympus was very far from Sparta.
Another surprise. Draco didn't like that he had to owe his life to that demonic man. But somehow, the feeling that Harry's blood was running through his veins made his chest rippled with a strange feeling, as if a part of Harry was now inside his body, inside him.
Draco remembered Icarus's words. He said Draco would be safe with Icarus. But where is he now? Draco is in danger, and he's not with him right now. The sound of footsteps came from Draco's right, and his body started to stiffen.
"Daddy..." the blonde man began to whisper softly, begging, a small sob escaped his pretty lips. This time it was Harry's turn to take a deep breath before putting the book he was still reading on to his desk.
The transmitter indicated that he was still alive but did not know what his condition was. He could be dying or broken a few bones. He could have brought home a weakened boy who was no longer beautiful to look at. Though, Ares was not a heartless man. No matter how bad his condition was later, Ares will make sure he gets good care.
After all, at this point, Arabelle was the only one who wasn't full of deceit in this kingdom. Draco didn't want to lose a friend like her.
"Have you forgotten the royal rules? A man is forbidden to enter someone's room at night, especially if that someone is married. It seems you really want to be punished." said Harry coldly.
Hearing Arabelle's call, Draco then turned his gaze from the window to her face.
Harry jerked his head. "Tell him what?"
He let his unprotected buttocks litter the dirt by the riverbank. To reduce the chill that hit him, Draco bent his legs. The young man's long hair was left loose so that it covered his chest and slightly covered his smooth back.
It would be a lie if Draco said he wasn't depressed. He's heartbroken. He cried for a long time, not knowing whom to hold on to because only Harry had his heart, and he had him lean on it at that time.
"Ssshh," Ron stopped Hermione's protest. "It's not good for your belly if you linger here."
"What the rumors said was true. You are very charming and humble, Your Majesty." said the concubine in the admiration which made a gentle smile decorate Draco's face.
Draco chuckled inwardly when he heard Natalie's formal question. Draco didn't think she would be in the mood to ask Draco all kinds of questions, considering Draco had once emphasized how chaotic the current state of his household was.
"It's just a name. Everyone can remember it," Draco replied casually.
"Should we report it to Ares?"
"Whatever the reason, you broke the rules, Ares!" Hera said.
"All right then, make me the special menu that you made at the restaurant,"
"Then I'll be out. You hurry up and clean up. It's going to be night soon." said Harry as Draco's helpless little bird finally landed smoothly in the palm of his stout hand.
"I was the first to arrive here."
Harry stared at Draco as dull as ever, but his eyes seemed to show disappointment. Was Draco a precious little toy for him? Of course, Draco wouldn't want to be treated that way. Therefore, it was better for Draco not to have anything to do with him anymore.
"Good afternoon. It looks like you are feeling better." Doctor Jason said hello again in the afternoon after examining Draco. "And I see your dinner is still intact. Why don't you eat them?"
Draco sways his hips in desperation, his desire rising mercilessly. He wanted Harry inside him soon. Oh god, he wanted Harry so badly!
Draco could see his husband staring at him in confusion and astonishment. The sharp look that adorned his husband's emerald eyes and a faint frown on his forehead as if to say that he didn't like Draco's behavior.
"Troya!"
Draco Malfoy really was an angel. With his heart and attitude, that young man was too ravishing to be a human.
What about Lucid Dreams? Like in the film Inception, starring Leonardo Dicaprio, humans can control dreams that feel very real. Draco used to have fun studying it. There were several things people can do if they suspect they were in a lucid dreaming situation. First, look for a watch or wall clock. If the needles were odd or more than three, it's most likely a Lucid Dream. But Draco couldn't find the clock anywhere. This was ancient Greece. He couldn't tell the time except when the sun was just rising and setting.
"Sorry, I don't have time to play with your people. I won't be more than a hundred years old if I am lucky, unlike you who have lived thousands of years. So, I have no interest in playing your game." Draco walked again and ignored the man.
"How do you know I'm in danger?" Draco narrowed his eyes.
"Are you serious?" Ares chuckles. "Why? Do you care if I love another human? This is not like you, Aphrodite," He continued.
"Yes, there is a way for humans like you to stay on Olympus. My wife, Psyche, was a princess of the human kingdom. I love her, and Zeus blessed me. Eventually, she drank Ambrosia and lived as a Titan who can't age,"
"So, just out of curiosity?"
"Okay," Harry's stare at Draco burned in the cold rain. "Whatever, please make yourself sick. I hope you won't bother me later." The man spun around, but after a few steps, he turned his body back and looked at Draco. "When you're done, I want to talk to you,"
"He-he's going to die," Draco felt sorry for Hector. His life was a waste.
"All right, try to get back to your room as soon as possible before your breakfast gets cold." Without saying another word, Alden rushed out of the room.
The man stepped into the room, and Draco felt Harry stunned for a moment staring at Draco's face, which was beautifully made up. But then Harry's eyes turned to Draco, who was still wearing the usual clothes he always wore in his room.
Both of them didn’t last long this time. Harry came soon, and Draco cried out when he came too, head tossed back. His stomach stretched, and his belly ached, and he was so full. Draco let out another long and loud moan as Harry’s cock twitched inside him, filling him again with come. Harry nuzzled his lower back, and with one last move of his hips, he carefully rolled them both over on their sides.
The man looked down and gave Draco a quick kiss on the cheek. "Welcome back, my dear."
Draco continued to stare at the brunette as he slowly entered the tent not far from where Draco was currently sitting.
They had all only been a few kilometers into Olympus when the ground around them suddenly shook violently. Draco even swore at the sight of the ground in front of him rolling like ripples of a river. Several trees appear to have fallen due to the earthquake. Their horses panicked, and Attica fell to the ground.
"He's in pain!" Harry's voice rose. "I thought his condition would be better, so tomorrow he could go home, but he is in pain. Why is he in pain? You said his wound would get better..."
Stunned for a moment, Harry took a step back and stared at Draco with such cold eyes. "Alright,"
The poor blond whimpers weakly, trembling legs spread wide to accommodate his Daddy. He's much too out of it to gather a response, so a soft whine is all Harry gets in reply. He's not mad though, kissing Draco's temple lovingly.
He was just about to get up from his seat, but Cedric's strong hands moved violently to press Draco's shoulders so that he sat back down again. Draco was surprised. His eyes widened perfectly.
"Yes, I ask you to remove your enmity and try to accept me as your boyfriend,"
In slow motion, he closed Draco's bedroom door. He did his best not to make the slightest disturbing sound. Harry then stepped both feet closer to Draco, who was fast asleep on his side.
Draco flushed with embarrassment and anger, hidden behind the shower curtain. “Potter.” He growled. “Leave the bathroom at once.” He snarled, feeling vulnerable as he stood under the streaming water in the nude.
Draco's body stiffened as he watched Cedric slowly but surely getting closer to him. The brunette's face was so close to Draco's, and even Draco could feel his breath.
Draco's personal maid, Glenice, gasped in surprise. Glenice stared at Draco with wide eyes and shook her head firmly. "Of course not, Your Majesty. A lowly servant like me doesn't deserve to ignore a queen in my own kingdom."
Draco couldn't understand what was wrong with himself. He does not understand. Draco has tried to be a lover who understands and forgives all the flaws that Harry has.
Draco regretted it later. Did that mean he would never sleep in the same blanket as Ares again? He thought he would be relieved, but surprisingly he was very sorry. He means, spending the night with Ares wasn't bad. If Draco hadn't made a rule of postponing the first night or something—it might have been a good night.
"I'm fine, Prince Cedric," Draco said firmly. "You'd better get out of my room. I don't want His Majesty to come here and see where you are. Right now, we're not in our palace. I don't want you two to fight here."
For a moment, there was only the sound of the orchestra and the tapping of heels between Draco and the crown prince.
2. Nephalem, the term for the half-devil and half-angel.
Draco sobs, body convulsing.
Draco was silent, watching the man with the charming face speak.
Harry clenched his jaw tightly. It looked like he had to send his cousin into battle again. The presence of Cedric in this palace would only make him feel grouchy. He will never calm down if he doesn't manage to keep the prince away from his wife.
"I'll give you a chance until sunset. When that time runs out, I'll look for you. And if I find you, I'll never let you go again."
A smile that also holds many secrets.
Unexpectedly, Harry smiled, then glanced at his bodyguard. "There's nothing that can refuse if I want to have something," He muttered dryly and gave his bodyguards a hand gesture.
When he spoke, everyone would think he was singing. When he smiled mysteriously, he would make other people who saw him smile too.
He was preoccupied with the matter of his country's feud with Thebes. Time and again, his troops experienced difficulties because Thebes was now experiencing rapid progress in military strength. It was something Sparta had not previously anticipated.
Shit! Draco Malfoy was a true embodiment of every man's wild fantasy.
Abruptly, Draco stopped in his tracks. Even though he stopped, a satisfied snort escaped his lips as he saw the tip of his blade pointing straight at Cedric's chest.
Draco winced at the information. Seraphina Potter? Was she Harry's mother? But Harry's mother was named Lily.
Harry walks into Draco's treatment room at midnight. By then, Draco was fast asleep. Harry made his way to the edge of Draco's bed with slow, silent steps and stood near the bed and watched Draco. So peaceful this young man was doze in his sleep as if he did not realize that now a great danger was lurking around him.
"You give me gifts too often, even when it's not my birthday, so there's no need." Draco stared at Luna's book, which was full of scribbles. "What are you drawing?" Draco saw a picture of a man with both wings and horns in Luna's book.
With a swift movement, Draco put the robe on. He didn't want himself to go back to making Harry because he was moving slowly.
"What is this? I may not be reincarnated in ancient Greece, but I may be in a Disney world." Draco said to himself, feeling ridiculous.
"And?"
Draco realized Cedric was feeling very upset right now. Because of that, Draco started racking his brains to find a way to make the other man less annoyed. "Don't you want to take me away from here? I'm bored already," he said, looking at Cedric expectantly.
Unexpectedly, Harry struck Alden with a single blow until the man's head leaned back, blood dripping from the corner of his lips. Draco gasped and almost screamed as Harry punched Alden repeatedly without a fight until the man fell to his knees with bruises, bleeding lips, and blood stained his shirt.
He didn't want himself to be judged solely for his physical beauty. Even though all humans had a choice, and of course Draco respected it—he just wasn't used to it. Maybe he should accept it because he lives in the era of ancient Greece. Draco also guessed that Ares' character might not be as old-fashioned as the majority of men in ancient Greece.
Coffee was served, a sign that the casual meeting was over. Several men opted out to smoke, while Ron sat quietly on the edge of the sofa, watching Harry, who was still busy studying the files in his hand.
Draco peeked a little at the empty throne next to him. The throne was supposed to be filled by the king. However, Draco didn't mind that, and he knew if Harry must be having fun with his mistress then, so let Draco have fun with his current position.
"At all?" Harry stood up from his seat and looked at Alden in frustration.
The two of them stood face to face, the air between them extremely tense. Silent and hushed, only two eyes staring at each other and challenging each other.
The Prince's expression changed his cheeks slightly flushed red. Ares felt it was natural because he knew that he was the bride of God Ares. He was used to dealing with anyone who turned awkward and shy in front of him, but he didn't lose his confidence. But this time, somehow, his awkwardness was contagious to him. Was it because he regretted being too slow to save the prince? or because of the guilt of having spied on the prince's behavior?
Unable to contain it, a tear fell from the corner of Draco's eye. Shouldn't a queen like himself feel in love? Even to fall in love with his husband, everything seems complicated now.
The person who spoke to Mr. Flitwick earlier has disappeared, and he is most likely the culprit. What kind of creature does something like this? Now Draco was in a complete panic. The culprit must still be in the store, and he should call the police immediately.
"Cedric, I know that you love me, but I'm sorry, I can't accept your love. If we were just ordinary people, it might be easy for me to do it. But alas, we are nobles who are bound in one family. I don't want to insult the history of the Shinia Kingdom just to accept that hazy feeling," Draco said as the blonde managed to control his emotions.
"Where are the others?"
Draco frowned in denial. "But my dad's company was fine before he made a deal with Harry. We're not broke at all!" He remembered the fancy dresses and jewels his father had bought for his mother, the servants who came and went to meet their needs, their luxurious, comfortable houses, cars, and all the other luxuries that his father provided at that time.
It had been fifteen minutes since Ares left his residence to look for the prince. He rushed and forced Herion to run faster. The prince could die at any time, even a few seconds after the local earthquake occurred. But Ares knew that his new wife was still alive because the bracelet he gave him had a transmitter.
"All right. I'll keep that in mind," Draco responded confidently.
"Ah… Then, I really want to go to Turkey!" said Arabelle excitedly.
He knew the action he had just done did not reflect his image as a queen who was gentle and loving to anyone, but for some reason, Cedric's shout and his rude actions made Draco engulfed with an extraordinary sense of fear.
Draco tried to smile. "Hey, Pans."
"I think it's too much. Nothing of his actions will harm Olympus. I think the gods have to show their presence every now and then. You know that the faith of humans for us starts to disappear because of the presence of other beliefs," Hera said wisely.
"Your majesty, don't you want to dance?" invite the young man in the end while spreading his charming smile to his husband.
"Draco!"
"But sir Hector, you are a commander-in-chief. How can you—"
"Of course, I didn't even move an inch," Harry muttered.
He looked at Ron's retreating back and finally smiled. How lucky Hermione was to have such an amazing partner like Ron.
Draco smiled and nodded his head. There was a little disappointment in his heart. Ron looks like Harry's business partner. In that case, any hope of asking Hermione for help had faded.
"I want to get to know you better. I don't want to be bedded because we are married. You haven't even kissed me yet," Draco spoke carefully.
Cedric clenched his jaw. Quickly, the man took wide strides toward Draco. "I will never tire, Draco, because this is my fight for my love." Cedric looked at him with a frustrated look.
"Bet?"
Natalie's heart skipped a beat when she saw her stepson's arrival. She was afraid that her stepson would say something strange and spoil the fun of this party.
He spread Draco's legs wide. Draco couldn't think anymore, his mind clouded by the passion that the hot and wet lips brought from his lips at the center of his body. Even Draco ignored the fact that the man called him
"How old are you, prince?" Lasonas asked, ignoring the demigod's protests.
Draco flushed again, hating how his physical reaction was so visible. Harry’s tongue ran the length of his member and then back, and then he began sucking on Draco’s balls. Draco let out a gasp at the sensation. His dick quickly swelled to full hardness.
Hello, guys! Sooo, before reading this story, there are a few things I want to point out related to the story.
He felt like a failure because there had been a misunderstanding. Did Ares hate him now? But this morning, the servants treated him as usual, including Alastair. Draco thought he could have been kicked out because Ares was disappointed in him. It seems the war god didn't say anything.
Draco never expected that all the Gods of Olympus would attend this dinner, but the guests who came at this time were only quite familiar with Ares or his descendants. Draco became convinced that their marriage indeed was not remarkable. Ares did say that his family would attend this banquet, but Draco thought it would be more crowded because almost all the Gods of Olympus were related by blood. In fact, it seems nearly all gods were descendants of Zeus.
"You can ask the female nurse to feed you, or I can feed you too," Harry hissed angrily.
Draco lowered Harry's thin robe covering his back to half his thighs with a very gentle motion. Of course, Harry noticed his wife's behavior which looked very elegant yet seductive at the same time.
Harry's face hardened. “Yes. I know what drug it is. And I refuse to use Draco under the influence of drugs. You did it yourself without asking for my permission. You know if I get angry, I can punish you."
For a moment, Draco wanted just to run away. But he realized this was a challenge. Harry challenged him, and Draco wouldn't lose.
"None of your business,"
"Because there will be times when you want offspring and have to go to men to fertilize your wombs," answered Lasonas again.
"Uh, from today onwards, we'll be in trouble," Draco said, imagining how he would have to deal with the questions from his friends.
The streets were quite busy that morning, and as usual, Draco saw the immortals roaming the streets. Even vampires roam around during the day. Do they use anti-sun cream? It felt bizarre seeing them roaming around in the daytime, even though he had seen this many times, and some fairies who used their wings to walk. Some of the fairies Draco passed were smiling. They knew Draco could see them.
"Yeah—I mean, what does he want with me?" he asked, cutting off Harry's explanation.
Doctor Jason shrugged his shoulders and smiled at Draco. "Okay, Draco, I have to get back on duty. I'm sure you'll get well soon." His smile is as bright as the sun was shining again, captivating Draco, even after Doctor Jason had left.
The beautiful man chuckled again, with the most amazing laugh Harry had ever heard. And with that smile, it was as if he was tempting Harry to come closer, inviting them to burn together.
From that conversation, Draco knew that Natalie wasn't what a lot of people thought. Maybe many people believe that Natalie used her body to get to her current position... yes, although it's still possible, Natalie's excellent knowledge was also a plus point why she was able to level up from an ordinary concubine to the main concubine in a reasonably short time.
Draco was grateful that Ares didn't carry him until they arrived at his palace. Ares found his horse, and now they both rode it. Draco felt ridiculous as his muscles involuntarily tightened from panicking around the man. Ares seemed to notice his reluctance to touch and sat slightly away from him. Even so, his hand holding the reins was still able to protect the Spartan prince from falling. He also spurred his horse not too fast.
"Soon your birthday... according to the agreement signed by your father, master Harry will marry you."
"What's wrong with that? He just fed me." Draco replied curtly.
"No, Prince Troya. Kronos has the same form as us. The story of him eating his children is just a dramatization spread by our race," said Argus again.
Draco wasn't the type to spend money on unnecessary things. But lately, he really wanted a guitar. He can play the guitar because Luna taught him. Luna taught Draco until he could play it so well, and also Luna said that the fairies really liked the singing and the sound of the guitar.
Draco didn't answer the man's teasing. He kept his eyes fixed on his bedroom window instead of staring at the handsome creature currently in front of him.
Both Draco and Harry immediately cast their gazes on the source of the voice.
"No. It's nothing, Your Majesty," Draco stuttered.
Ares laughed at his mother's words. "I guess you haven't forgotten how the people of Olympus view me, Goddess Hera. There is Hermes who always faithfully obeys Zeus' orders, there is Dionysius who often behaves well, and Apollo who is popular among the Titans. I won't stand a chance."
"Does the Goddess Hera not believe in Ares' abilities?" Athena smirked slightly.
After the King of Delion and Natalie left, Draco sighed harshly. The blonde lifted his face, and spontaneously, he squinted his eyes as the intense sunlight greeted him.
"Park? Are you kidding me?" Harry's voice parroted. What would Ron and himself do in a park? Sitting around and listening to parents and young people having picnics with small children running to and fro? Harry felt he had better go back to his room and forget the silliness.
"Attica, Lasonas, and Argus will return to the residence of the warriors after reporting the events in Sparta to Ares. We would like to apologize for causing you any harm, prince of Sparta."
Harry was silent. He again directed his focus to the increasingly crowded state of the city park. Children who walk full of enthusiasm, their tiny hands intertwined with their mother's, accompanied by their soulmates. The boys who walked together exchanged jokes that Harry didn't understand. They all seemed to be enjoying each other's moments, looking free and unencumbered. As for himself? Busy looking and messing around with something meaningless.
"Wait," she remembered something, "Why do you say I'm lucky? Aren't I unlucky if Potter likes me?" Pansy looked at Draco suspiciously.
Seeing Cedric gotten his sword, Draco immediately bowed respectfully to sign that he would battle with a noble. Cedric also did the same. The brunette bowed with one of his hands hidden behind his back.
"What?! He wants to kill me?!" Draco asked in a panic. "So he didn't happen to be killing someone?"
The rattling motion on the bed made Harry look alert. In the gloom of the room, he saw Draco lying there, restless. The boy has not slept… and he seems troubled. Harry approached and found Draco lying with tormented eyes. His body squirmed on the bed with the white satin sheets like he was in heat.
Draco was silent. Ares’ words seemed to remind him that he, too, was human. Ares would not hesitate to punish him if he made a mistake. He started to get too comfortable because of Ares' polite treatment of him since their first meeting. He absolutely must not forget his title as the God of War, his age which already reached thousands of years, and his non-human status. His way of thinking will certainly be different.
"You will stay in this room from now," Harry ordered dryly.
If Draco felt another feeling for Harry... Draco shook his head, trying to get rid of the feeling that clung to him. With trembling hands, he felt his bandaged arm and sobbed.
"You should think about it."
"This is mine," Harry touched Draco's nipples and teased him, enjoying hearing Draco's tortured moan. "Your whole body is mine," Harry kissed the tip of Draco's nipples, smacking it with his tongue. Then Harry's lips moved to kiss Draco's smooth chest, savoring it with his lips, leaving traces of wetness and heat.
She's a happy woman. Beautiful, happy woman, Draco corrected. With her beautiful golden white dress, perfect hairdo, simple make-up, and her eyes sparkling with love. This woman in front of him seemed to radiate happiness. Her husband must have loved her very much.
Ares didn't listen to anything Aphrodite said at his side. He just stared at his wife and Dionysius sharply and analyzed them. Dion was not the type of guy who liked to date humans or changes partners. He was almost as loyal as Hades, who only loved Persephone. But his wife Ariadne died several decades ago, and Dion was happy to be single until now. Though, Ares knew that Dion would not be so bold as to flirt with his wife openly.
"Of course." Harry smiled. "I'll call someone to help you dress up."
Harry glares at the nurse who was sedated to replace Draco in bed. The two bodyguards who had been guarding Draco's room stood terrified, their faces wounded from Harry's beatings.
Maybe if he peeks a little at what the food… No! Draco scolded himself inwardly. He would not eat. It would be better for him to starve than to have to surrender to Harry's rule. But if he drinks, it may be okay. Draco glanced thirstily at the drink on the tray. Fresh orange juice that looks so tasty.
"Thank you, Your Majesty," Draco said as he passed the little bird in his hand onto Harry's hardy palm with a stiff motion.
One day, Draco accidentally saw a Nymph smile. Draco shuddered to see her mouth filled with fangs. No incisors or molars. They turned out to be true carnivores.
"Draco Malfoy," he whispered with a teasing smile as he looked at Harry.
"He's not immortal and short-lived, but he's reliable," Lasonas patted Alastair friendly on the shoulder.
"That... That red spot is usually done by their partners when they are about to have sex. A kind of stimulation, Your Majesty," said Glenice fearfully. She was anxiously awaiting how Draco would respond.
Draco reflexively stepped back — away from the man. His silver eyes are still staring at Harry in disbelief. The wound across the man's right eye seemed to show how brutal the war he was used to facing. Draco doesn't know from which war he got that scar.
Ginny, the
"What offer?"
"I'm Harry," he decided to introduce himself. "Harry Potter."
But because Doctor Jason seemed to be accustomed to walking freely in and out of this room, he caught them off guard, and they let him as he please. Who would have thought that Doctor Jason was the dreaded Hyde?
"Shit," it's the voice of Greyson Rouvas — Harry Potter's business partner who frequently visited his company because both companies were working on a project.
After all, she was married off by Zeus by force. Zeus worries that the Gods were scrambling to marry her and create war. He eventually forced Aphrodite to marry Hephaestus, the disabled blacksmith god. Why Hephaestus? Why didn't he marry Aphrodite to another child like Ares? Even though Ares was known as a loser on Olympus, Ares was still better as a lover than Hephaestus.
"Who are you? Why does my heart hurt when I see you?" Draco felt his body suddenly become very tired and weak. And in an instant, his consciousness was taken over by darkness.
"Prince Troya, are you sure you want to go to that place again?" The servant timidly asked.
Draco blinked his eyes. "What? It means
Draco snorted. “Isn't in this house what Harry Potter wants like a king's orders to be obeyed? I saw with my own eyes how people go back and forth, panicking all day long over your endless madness."
The hallway is empty. Carefully Draco stepped out. The sound of Alden's banging and shouting was still heard as Draco came out of the room, but as Draco closed the big white door, the sound faded and became silent. Apparently, the white room where he was locked was soundproof.
Ares was an authoritative person who liked to guide his lovers as he pleased. He knows how to make them comfortable and trusts him. Then let it dominate their souls and bodies until their hearts were addicted to him.
"How could that be?"
Harry then took his hand off Draco, and they returned to his house. Harry's face looks a little strange, between shocked and disbelief.
Draco's future? Who is this man to decide his future? Draco wanted to explode in anger but couldn't. Harry looked different. He looked so calm but clad in a dangerous rage, so cold and charming. After all, why did Draco think Harry was charming? While cursing himself, Draco tried to erase the thoughts that led to his attraction towards Harry.
Draco was still sitting on his knees, biting his lip, looking down, and wringing his dress. He looked like he wanted to cry. Ares hated how he felt right now. He wanted to come over and hug him and comfort him. It was so easy for him to do that to his other lovers. Pretending to care was his forte. But this time, he hesitated.
But the one in Ares' palace wasn't the planetarium like in his old school. The Titans and Demigods called it the Star Tower. There was real stargazing there. Not for fortune-telling and the like. Titans made it a kind of research center with Hadreda being one of the leaders.
"Unless you drink Ambrosia and become immortal,"
"But we're serious, Dray," Pansy said between laughs. "If you really like him, that's up to you."
"Harry Potter, your boyfriend." The woman shrugged her shoulders in the direction of Harry's retirement. "He defended you bravely in front of those annoying women…whoops." The woman covered her lips with tapered fingers. "I can't say it, but they are annoying, right? If it weren't for my husband, I wouldn't want to attend this party and mingle with them." the woman laughed again.
"What?" Ares' response was a little out of focus.
"Oh, you want a kiss?" Ares brought his face closer, but Draco reflexively dodged. "You're avoiding me?" He frowned.
"Ready?" asked Ron. Beside him, Dean and that one soldier bowed. The Alpha responded with a smile.
"Yes, I won the bet, and the prince of Sparta is my prize. It would be rude of me to refuse, would it?"
Harry was getting ready to visit Draco at the hospital. Early in the morning, he decided to see Draco before he headed to his office. Harry ordered Alden to stop by one of the flower shops and buy Draco a beautiful carnation.
"Maybe yes," Luna paused, she stared at Draco. "Look, Dray, his appearance wasn't just a coincidence. You have to make him take side with the angels. Because if you don't, I can't help you save humans."
"I'm your husband, you're my wife, and it's been five days since you arrived at my palace, Troya. Strangely, we haven't even slept together. What are you waiting for? Are you trying to oppose me?" Ares said a little fiercely to Draco. He immediately regretted it. His intense desire for the prince seemed to have disturbed his composure.
"Your Majesty, are you going to ride a horse? Why do you have to ride a horse when the kingdom has already prepared a carriage for you?" Glenice asked as she twirled Draco's blond mane together.
, a gorgeous dish of cream that is burnt on the top to form a crunchy but soft caramel layer on the bottom.
A firm slap landed on Cedric's left cheek as soon as he shook Draco's arms harder. Draco's breathing turned ragged as he finally landed a slap on his brother-in-law's cheek.
Harry, who was at war with his worries for Draco, turned his head quickly. "Alive?" he asked, narrowing his eyes.
"What do you think?" Ares smiled.
"First, let me draw the arrow," said Cedric.
When the restaurant's head chef left, Harry pulled Draco a chair and then sat in front of Draco. "This restaurant belongs to my mother," Harry watched the head of the restaurant leave. "Luna is my mother's assistant for a long time. She loves this restaurant as much as she loves her life."
"I have to confess. I overheard your conversation with Goddess Hera,"
To a seductive someone, he may not hesitate to show his true nature. With a human who has an independent nature, Ares may pretend to need them. He judges the character of humans. He approaches and behaves as they wish.
"Yay! Spoiled Malfoy and Potty are dating! They're kissing! They're kissing!"
"I can't tell you. Master Harry will be furious,”
"Yes, my Queen. I've been thinking about it for the past decade, and I know that I can't forever be the king of the gods. Leadership regeneration is needed for the titan race." Zeus said seriously.
"What? You're telling me to leave?" Ares was surprised.
"I wish Your Majesty Draco could adopt a child or two. I can't wait to be the aunt of Your Majesty's cute babies." Natalie said in a cheerful tone that managed to make the tense atmosphere that had previously surrounded the four people disappear.
Draco cursed his bad luck. If he were human, Draco might have beaten him with a golf stick. Luckily, he was an immortal who had strength.
The blonde prince immediately looked for friends.
All the guests were silent and stared at their king as he rose from his throne. All the guests who were there held their breath, guessing what their king would do.
me? Your brain must have shorted,"
"Why did you appear again?"
"You said this was your first marriage, but I don't see anything special about this. So I doubt if we really are husband and wife?" Draco asked.
"Yes, your answer is correct, Your Majesty. Can I be proud that such an extraordinary queen knows my name?"
He was Prince Cedric Diggory. One of the many royal families openly glared at the black-haired girl with a hateful look.
"What if Your Majesty gets hurt?"
"Huh? Why do you ask me that?"
"You think I'll believe you?" Draco asked fiercely, which made Terence snort softly.
Even though Draco smiled and looked fine, Natalie could tell that the young man had his own concerns. Whether it was his husband or his mistress or the kingdom or whatever, Natalie didn't want her husband to make things worse.
"Before ending this fight, I want to ask you one thing," Cedric stared intently into Draco's silver eyes, which seemed to glow in the sunshine.
"We have been negligent, Lord Ares," Lasonas' confident voice seemed to tremble.
Ron chuckled, then turned around and hugged Hermione's body. "All right, princess, I'll try." He brought his face close to hers, then kissed her lips sweetly. "Now, can we stop talking about other people and go to sleep? I'm so sleepy, and it's not good for you to sleep late at night. "
"Elite restaurant, of course," said Ron, sprinting after Harry. "Which makes you much more comfortable and less grumpy."
"Where am I?" Draco surprised himself after asking that question. He heard a foreign sentence slip out of his lips. What he thinks with what he says was different.
That statement made Draco turn his head again to look at Harry. He cleared his throat. His throat felt dry, making it difficult to speak, his stomach ached, and his head was dizzy. “You... promise?” Draco muttered weakly.
"Yes, Your Majesty," Draco said obediently as he tried to keep pace with Harry, who was walking very fast like he was chasing something important.
Draco shot Harry a surprising look at the man swearing in such a public place. Things no nobles should do, especially a king of a large kingdom.
"Who?"
"Who are you calling weirdo?"
“Then Mrs. Seraphina got pregnant. They were both thrilled, anxious, and happy because it was their first child. After all, it was a precarious pregnancy. Mrs. Seraphina shouldn't be pregnant because of her illness, but she's a stubborn woman behind her frail body." Alden subconsciously smiled, softening the flat lines on his face. "She was determined to get pregnant and give birth to their child, even though everyone was against it, even master Harry was against it."
Draco chuckled. He didn't really remember that today is the fourteenth of January, the day he was born. "I totally forgot,"
"Then let me and Arabelle take the same carriage." Draco interrupted.
"Yeah, but mostly."
"No!" Draco tried to scream and grabbed Harry's arm. "Stop! You can't do that!"
"Sunday," replied the man, confused.
Draco made an exasperated face. "You want everyone to look at me like I'm crazy?" Draco whispered again.
Draco bit his trembling lower lip. "Y-Yes, Daddy.."
"You don't like it?" whispered Harry softly.
"I already guessed that you would refuse," Lucius said as he stopped right in front of Draco.
Vehicles stop when red and move when green. In fact, no one needs that
"Uh, the way His Royal Highness stares at his stepmother looks a little different like there's deep longing and love, but there's also hate."
If only he had forgotten about Draco's condition, he might have drawn his sword right at the neck of his ungrateful cousin. He ignored the words that just came out of Cedric's mouth. The king chose to step closer to Draco, who was in Cedric's arms.
"Damn mosquito! Damn Oracle! What did I do wrong to have to accept this fate?''
The thought that this man had used so many women and men to satisfy his arrogance and power made Draco feel sick. And suddenly came the strength within him to push the man away and slap him with all his might.
"No, sorry I've been rude. No problem. I know Hadreda. She's smart and has a great sense of humor," Alastair smiled.
"Right now, Athena is often spying on you and looking for your faults. Maybe Zeus will never step down, but you will first lose the title of god because of Athena's trickery. You have to admit that you are not serious enough about your divine duty, Ares. I don't ask much of you. Just do not break Zeus' rules and don't let Athena find any flaw to bring you down." Hera explained again.
Draco took a deep breath. This was not the married life he wanted. He wanted a husband who could love him with all his heart, not a husband like Harry. If Draco had forgotten that he was currently the Empress of a large empire, Draco would have filed for annulment long ago.
“And your name is — ?”
got off with it!” I restrained myself from letting out a breath of relief. Thank Merlin. I’d see him again at Hogwarts. He would be alright for now.
“Very well. What else have you heard about the boy?” Voldemort stayed close to me. I forced myself to meet his scarlet eyes.
“Thank you, Pansy, for everything.”  I smiled at her. We could have been a good couple if we cared enough and actually wanted to.  I wrapped my arm around her shoulders.  “Now come on, let’s get to class.”
"Come on,"  He muttered, picking Harry up bridal style.  The sleeping man mumbled incoherently and Draco couldn't help but smile.  Just as the reached the top of the stairs, Harry opened his eyes.
“No, but —”
It continued like this for a few months.  They'd argue almost every day over something small — "Put your books away, Potter", "For Heaven's sake Malfoy, turn down the heat" — but they would always end laughing at the ridiculousness of it all.  Throughout the first few weeks, they developed a routine — Draco almost always woke up first, putting the kettle on before waiting for Harry to make breakfast.  The few times Harry woke up first, he made them pancakes instead of oatmeal for breakfast.  They'd floo to training after Harry yelled at Draco for five minutes, assuring him his hair looked fine, and Draco yelling back that fine wasn't good enough.  They'd travel home after training and decide what was for dinner, Harry sometimes cooking, Draco sometimes getting take-away, or, on the rare occasion, Harry trying to teach Draco how to cook, which almost always ended in something burning or, at the very least, a massive mess.  After dinner, they'd sit in the lounge on separate sofas reading books for their courses, Draco draped elegantly across the couch while Harry folded himself awkwardly.  Draco would enjoy a cup of tea before going to shower while Harry knocked back a beer.  Harry would say goodnight as he'd walk past a freshly showered Draco in just his towel, who'd always blush but duck into his room before the former could notice.
"They go down like juice," Harry laughed, taking two of the tequila shots from the bar. "Take your shot and stop complaining about free alcohol." He passed one to Draco and shot him his signature crooked grin. Draco thanked Merlin for the alcohol — it made this whole interaction that much easier.
“I bet they were there,” Goyle muttered in return.  “Yours too Draco.”  I felt a hot, sick swoop of anger in my stomach.
.  I could just tell him everything, and he could tell Dumbledore or whoever he heard it from an anonymous source.  Yet, I’m the only person who could know that information who could tell Harry.  Voldemort would know the moment someone countered.  I can’t say anything without risking everyone I love.
“Don’t be.  It was so many years ago.  It was an accident,” Draco murmured.  Harry’s eyes stayed transfixed on the scar, travelling up to Draco’s collarbone, before leaning in to press a light kiss where it ended.  He ran his hands down Draco’s sides, holding his waist as he peppered more kisses along Draco’s collarbone.  Draco sighed into the kisses.  His hands quickly found the hem of Harry’s shirt and pulled it over his head.  A pink mark was growing on Draco’s collarbone where Harry had been kissing.
“There’s also the fact you literally scream about me all the time!”  He straightened his back, grabbed his jacket, lifted his chin, and mimicked in a loud and pompous tone—  “Potter this, Potter that!”  He shook his head, smiling.  “You really need to work on being more subtle.”
“Well, we all know he and that oaf were close,” Goyle laughed.  I rolled my eyes.  Harry told me many times how important Hagrid was to him, how he was the one to save him from the Dursleys and was the first one to show him magic.  He even brought him to buy his wand and robes in Diagon Alley the first time we met.
Harry also fell asleep on his couch, but when he woke up, the kitten was no longer on his chest.  He groggily sat up, frantically looking for the tiny creature until he saw a sight on the other couch he'd never forget — Draco Malfoy, with his limbs splayed out across the black leather, and a tiny black and white heap of fur peacefully sleeping on his chest.  Harry shuffled off to his room to retrieve a Polaroid camera and take a picture of the ridiculously cute scene.
“Yeah.”  We stayed like that in silence for a few minutes before Harry pulled away and started straightening his robes.
“Yes you dingbat,”  Pansy laughed. “But you need to tell him. Or at least become friends.  It’s way more than just a silly crush by now.” I shook my head.
“Come on.”  I heard the door shut and Pansy caught up to me.
“Draco, dear,” My mother appeared in my doorway. “Is that your booklist from Hogwarts?”
“No, but —”
"Patronus.  I like that!" Cole sat up from the couch he was laying on.  Harry looked up from fiddling with a drumstick like he used to with his wand.   "I really like that! Jasp? Mason?" Huh.  Nice.
"Hey, hey, it's okay.  I promise."  Harry reassured him.  Draco nodded and sniffled.  Harry made them chocolate chip pancakes and hot cocoa topped with whipped cream and cinnamon — like Molly would make that morning.  He was relieved when Draco smiled over the warm mug.
Ron was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus.  He wasn’t laughing, but he wasn’t sticking up for Harry either.
The sun was starting to peak over the treeline, warming the fresh air ever so slightly.  I head back through the green vines, carefully following the red vines back to the edge of the forest.  I take my time getting back to the castle and head back to my room. Blaise was just getting into the shower when I got back.  I grabbed a scrap of parchment and quickly wrote out a note before grabbing my school robes and leaving for breakfast.
“Yes, buff— what?”  My jaw dropped.
"You alright mate? You've been in a daze since, like, the second song." Harry was thankful for a friend like Cole — he always noticed when Harry was off, when he was zoning out during rehearsals or when they met for drinks, and he'd spend more time staring into his pint than drinking it. Harry felt guilty that he couldn't wholly confide in Cole. He couldn't just divulge into a magical war and the traumas he still carried with him. But he was thankful for the few things he could confide in — losing his parents as a baby, abuse from his childhood, dealing with school relationships and terrible teachers, losing other influential people throughout the years, unrequited love, the confusion of sexuality and trying to define it.
According to Draco, the atmosphere was starting to heat up, and he should defuse this tense atmosphere. "Fine. So you guys are fighting over me? Look, I'm so honored, and I appreciate that. But being fought over by two creatures that don't make sense..." He glanced at Harry. "I feel sorry for myself. Why don't the girls fight over me? While you guys were fighting, I wanted to eat. Have fun."
Ares then took the prince slightly away and whispered to him. "Are you sure? You show weakness in front of them. It's okay to be a little tough here. You may need to do it so they will respect you." Ares advised him.
"That's your money," Alden interrupted quietly. "It's your stock of your father's company that master Harry has taken over."
Harry raised his head and looked at Alden. "Is everything all right?" he asked.
"Isn't that beautiful, Your Majesty?" asked Cedric when he saw Draco fixated on what he was currently staring at.
"Then?"
Draco ushered him in, and he sat watching the man pull out important-looking files from his briefcase.
Draco’s breath deepened. He finally felt exhausted. His hole and nipples were abused, and his stomach was so distended. He wanted to rest, but he said, “Okay.” The hatred, the revenge, all of them have long been forgotten.
"Watch your attitude. They are the messengers of the God of War!" The King of Sparta gave a soft rebuke. He seemed unfazed by the treasure, which he thought was Troya. No amount of treasure will be able to replace his beloved son...
"Are you hurt?" asked Harry worriedly as he looked at his mistress with intense eyes.
The bull fell to the ground. Ares used his sturdy arms to hold and squeeze its neck. Ares forced the bleeding to speed up. The bull finally succumbed to death without any significant resistance.
"What do you mean, father?" The young man asked. Did the King of Sparta have the same thoughts as him?
"Ares doesn't want to talk to me or see me. Our last meeting ended in a small fight. I'm pretty sure he'll dump me soon," Draco smiled bitterly.
"Yes, many of his other lovers were from the Titans, and they lived on Olympus, but never for long,"
Like a shameless person, Draco then decided to turn his back to Harry. Draco knew self-respect and reputation to himself and his father were very important, but it seemed like they weren't necessary anymore in front of Harry.
The taxi driver stared at Draco through the windshield. "Are you okay?" he asked.
"Track their whereabouts until you found it," Harry gritted his teeth. "Whatever it is, the address, the car number, anything to direct us to him. We have to find Draco before it's too late." Harry closed his eyes, for a moment feeling the tightness in his chest.
Still, no matter how hidden it was, Troya was very beautiful. The moonlight that slid gently into the expansive room hit his white skin, making it seem like he was glowing. Satyrs and nymphs began to arrive in large numbers. They had many dishes in their hands. Draco noticed that most of the dish was dominated by meat. There was the whole deer roasted in rosemary and large bowls of buttered potatoes and vegetables.
"Then... How did His Majesty create the spot?" Draco asked again with a curious glint already in his eyes. Glenice's heart suddenly dropped when she heard Draco's question.
His legs walked on their own to enter the blue flower garden. He couldn't help but smile happily as he watched his feet sink between the blue flowers that looked so fresh. His slender hand moved to brush the tiny blue flowers he could reach.
. Draco wiped a tear from the corner of his eye.
Harry's tongue then froze when he heard Draco's words. The king certainly knew that a royal noble was forbidden to bow their head too long to others, especially if the royal noble was wearing a crown. Harry couldn't help but flinch as he watched Draco remove the ruby-red crystal crown from above his head.
Cyclops before Ares did not budge. He seemed almost asleep. Then Ares saw something in his hand. There was a rope attached to something. At first, Ares thought it was a wild boar or wolf who had the misfortune to become a Cyclops’ toy. It turned out to be a Satyr, the half-human creature with goat legs.
He picked up the passed out blonde lightly and carried him out to his bed, where he proceeded to towel him off. Harry hummed a tune as he did so, admiring the marks he had left on the boy’s pretty skin.
Alden realized that he was tricked when he saw Draco's brisk pace. He tried to catch up, but too late, Draco, who jumped nimbly, was already out of the bathroom and slammed the door from the outside, then locked it tight.
"O," the doctor replied quickly, suddenly afraid of the fire burning in those emerald eyes.
"God damn it!" Draco gushed angrily, then driven by his offense at Harry's insult, Draco stepped forward and tried to throw a punch in Harry's face. But Harry was quite flexible. Harry grabbed Draco's arm and speedily moved Draco's arm behind his back.
"Your arrival is not disturbing at all, Your Royal Highness. Coincidentally, I do wish to visit another area in this palace." Draco replied with a polite smile.
After tidying up the books that had just arrived this morning, Draco got ready to go home. After saying goodbye to the shop owner, Mr. Flitwick, Draco started walking towards the subway station to go somewhere. It took five minutes to get to the station.
Draco gasped, trying to struggle with all his strength. But it's useless because Harry is stronger than him. "Are you going to force me again?!" Draco screamed in his attempt to break free. "If so, then you have proven to me that you are indeed a bastard who can only get what you want from rape!"
Draco lifted his body, and now, he saw his husband standing, not alone anymore. He saw Arabelle lovingly embraced the king's body from the side. Draco smiled faintly and raised his hand to wave gently as his eyes collided with Arabelle's.
One of the maids pulled Draco's bed cover, and seemed to be checking the sheets, then whispered to each other and giggled. When Draco looked at them with frowning, the two female assistants put on flat faces and hurried out of the room.
"You'll be forever caged in here if you can't love me, Seraphim." Harry started threatening.
"Draco, don't you know that I'm feeling annoyed right now? That self-conscious girl has ruined my happiness tonight. I don't know what I've done until I met that ignorant girl," Cedric grumbled without paying attention to the sentence that had previously been saying.
Harry felt a little dizziness and pain in his arm this time, which was cut by the car's iron that had rolled three times before crashing into the downhill road. He caressed Draco's head affectionately and quickly kissed the blonde on the forehead before Alden walked into the room.
"How could I hate you? You are so beautiful and independent. I should have learned from you," Draco said sincerely.
A moment ago, he was standing on the side of the road, waiting for the lights for pedestrians to turn green, then in a second, he was hit by a car. He circulated his eyes around the room, thinking that is he dead? Is this the appearance of heaven? That looks like a fancy and magnificent palace?
"I've written a prescription for the medicine Mr. Draco must take." The doctor bowed slightly. "I'll excuse myself, Mr. Potter." Then the doctor walked away, with Alden escorting him out.
"My head... My head..." Draco groaned as best as he could.
he hissed to himself. Those bitches are used to living richly, so they sometimes lack manners. Hah! If only they had known that the Harry Potter they glorified was secretly attracted to 'men'.
Draco stepped back unconsciously. "Accept you as to what? You are crazy!"
It was not uncommon for kings to seek advice from the Oracles before going to war or about to make political decisions.
If he thought about it, he’s probably the luckiest man among all the men in this kingdom because Harry managed to marry a young man called an angel by the people of this kingdom.
Greyson hummed. "Are you his family? Maybe a cousin?" he asked.
But Draco sensed something was there, something different that was a little frightening to him. The sexual tension that filled this room felt so uncomfortable. And despite Harry's offer seeming so fascinating, Draco didn't dare to take a risk.
“Whatever you say, one thing is for sure. You are already mine. And like I said, everything that belongs to Harry Potter can never get away unless I let you go…or I kill you!" Harry violently released his grip on Draco's jaw, making Draco's more petite body pushed again into the bed. Then with firm strides, Harry stepped out of the room, slamming the door hard behind him.
According to Draco, given Ares's extraordinarily cunning and unfeeling character in Greek poetry, what Ares does now doesn't live up to his reputation. Considering Ares's incredibly cunning and heartless character in Greek poetry, Ares could have kidnapped him and treated him as he pleased then after being bored, Ares could dump him.
"I don't know what I'm doing here. My heart feels restless if I don't confirm your current situation," said Cedric with a soft smile.
Ron sat quietly and took a sip of coffee, his eyes still on the door Harry had disappeared behind. Harry's behavior reminded him of his old self. A smile appeared on Ron's lips. Harry might have gone through the same thing as himself if he hadn't been careful of Draco.
Draco finally ran to get his phone, which luckily still worked. He quickly pressed to call Luna and heard a murmuring sound like someone was doing something.
A second later, Harry brought Draco through a whirlwind of waves getting up and down until orgasmic shocks ravaged them both. Bring them together at one point of pleasure. Harry lifted himself from the panting Draco; his mind was still foggy from orgasm. His fingers gently untied Draco's hands. The ties leave a reddish mark on the blonde's delicate wrist.
Draco also understood why Alastair had doubts that he could befriend Hadreda since she was a Centaur.
Glenice's heart sank even more. This beautiful, smart, and responsible Draco deserves a husband more than their king. "Uh, if Your Majesty wants, I can bring a book like that to Your Majesty as study material," Glenice offered while trying to smile.
"Draco," called out a voice Draco believed was not Harry's. If not Harry, it means the other one — Icarus. Yeah, who else was bothering him beside the two of them.
"Luna," Draco said quietly. "Can you track where I am? I'm at someone's house, but I don't know where," he said again.
Demigod, he said. Draco immediately realized again the nature of the gods of Olympus, who like to go around doing whatever they want. They are often told of sowing seeds everywhere, both fellow gods and mortal. The child from the marriage of the gods and the mortals was called a demigod.
"Have you forgotten the rules of the kingdom? A married person is not allowed to meet someone who is not married without the presence of another person between the two of them," Harry glared at Cedric.
Harry's expression gave Draco goosebumps. The vision of himself being killed by Harry crossed his mind. It made Draco really dizzy, and he wanted to puke.
"Um," Draco nodded, his face warm up with embarrassment.
Then they fell silent again. No one spoke anymore, either because they didn't know what to say or because they were awkward about the situation. Especially for Harry, this situation was no longer awkward for him but stupid. Ridiculous and stupid. How could Draco still not get a clue from all of his words?
"Come in."
Finished with one man, another man appeared. Draco didn't like this.
Was Cedric's view of Arabelle that low? Did Harry have to scream in his brother's face and say that Arabelle was a good woman? Even she was a virgin when she first slept with Harry.
Ares was an overly attractive man. Even for Draco, who works and knows almost half of the most handsome creatives in Hollywood. His well-groomed jet-black hair looked pleasant to the touch. His eyes were green and shady, harboring a mysterious yet friendly impression. His face was more captivating than the statue of the gods in the Greek museum he has visited. His skin was not too light, a little dark like the skin of a young oak. His physique was also perfectly sculpted thanks to his routine that likes to fight and eradicate the monsters of Olympus.
Athena, like most of the other Olympus goddesses, was born beautiful. Her hair was curly black, and her skin was slightly pale. Somewhat different from the other goddesses, Athena wore a half-faced war helmet and did not wear a dress. Athena looks like a female warrior from the Amazons.
If Aphrodite had lived in London, where Draco's true origin was, the Goddess would have received massive blasphemy. She's a public figure with millions of followers, but she had an affair with a man until she had children, even though her husband was alive and healthy. Women like Aphrodite would be labeled 'shameless'. Draco felt sorry for Hephaestus, her husband.
Harry gritted his teeth. He couldn't bear to play around like this anymore. Being around Draco, naked and ready like this, made him feel almost crazy. This young man had to give up on him.
"Maybe there is. You could try working with another god," Alastair suggested.
Harry was already halfway to stripping his tie and laying down on the bed if he hadn't remembered that Ron had been waiting for him for quite some time in the front yard of the packhouse.
"Thank you," Greyson nodded back. “So… I heard what happened to Tom Riddle,”
A few twigs had scratched his beautiful skin, but Hector didn't care. No matter how much Draco begged and cursed at him, he didn't stop. Then Alastair, with his sword, leaped before them. He looked at Hector coldly and slashed his arm without any warning.
The girl’s grunt drew a laugh from Draco's that sounded like the melodies of leading musicians. He suddenly remembered something. The blonde's laughter stopped. Now, he stared intently at his maid.
Harry looked at Draco with irritation. "You're weird too. Have you been bewitched to stand beside me all this time?" Harry replied.
"Especially seeing Mr. Potter behave in the emergency room yesterday," Doctor Jason chuckled.
Curiously, Draco stands on his tiptoe, trying to clearly see the man's figure, Harry Potter, a figure who was feared in the business world because he doesn't hesitate to crush anyone who gets in his way. Anyone who dares to fight Harry Potter will end up in tragedy.
Pulling one corner of his lips to the side, Ron tilted his head. "Yeah, not really. It wasn't really a formal event you had to attend. I just thought it would be a shame if you missed it. You know, the euphoria."
The pretty blond chuckled for a moment, and Harry could feel his blood rushing at the way the corners of his red lips pulled up.
"Why?"
"Y-Yes, Your Majesty?" asked Glenice, stammering. Her voice sounded hoarse.
,” Harry mumbled.
Ares stopped stroking the prince's hair and looked at him.
"Sit down. I want to talk to you, Ares," said Goddess Hera, a little intimidatingly.
Quickly the man grabbed Draco's shoulder, and at that moment, Draco realized that he would kiss him. As soon as he could, he looked away, trying to struggle, until Harry's lips just landed on his temple, and the man's grip on his shoulder grew so intense, it hurt.
"I've decided to have you, and the only way you get away from me is when I choose to let you go, or when you… die,” with his cruel closing words, Harry opened the white door, and pushed Draco inside, then locked it from the outside, leaving Draco banged and kicked the door hysterically.
"Is it because of the Prince of Sparta that you guys feel you have to act like this to me?" She said, annoyed when Alastair and his partner Argus tried to help her get on the horse after a short rest by the river.
All the nobles chuckled in admiration when they saw Draco's smile. The smile was honored as the most charming smile among all the people living in this kingdom.
"God, what happened to you?" Draco was surprised when he saw that Arabelle's usually smooth and flawless legs were now covered in red blotches.
"No, I haven't finished talking to Troya," Dion sulked.
Can he escape from here? Draco wanted to scream in panic, or should he just kill himself? But Draco was certain Harry wouldn't let him. Oh, with Harry's ruthlessness, he might let Draco die, but he'll make sure Draco suffers before that happens.
"You are mine, Aphrodite. Nothing can take you away from me, not even death." Harry whispered like a promise in the dark of night before finally, the thick fog engulfed them, bringing them back into the place where the God of Death was ruled.
"Honestly, Dray," Pansy's tone seemed to be asking Draco to look back at her. "If I pay attention, Potter likes to get your attention the most. I'm quite sensitive, you know. I do occasionally find Potter looking at us, but not at me, but—"
Draco raised an eyebrow. "What?" he asked Luna.
"Sorry for last night," Harry chuckled. He lowered his head and kissed Draco's forehead fondly.
"It's not that sad, Prince Cedric. I just felt touched by their love journey, which was full of twists and turns, but they were able to endure to the end," Draco replied with certainty.
"What's with your neck, Arabelle? Is your room full of bugs? Do I need to move your room?" Draco asked worriedly as he gently stroked the red spot with his index finger.
During his life in London, Draco was practically an atheist. Draco often claims to be an agnostic who doesn't believe in any religion. The concept of ancient Greek belief for him was far-fetched. But the transfer of Draco's soul into the body of a young Spartan named Troya had miraculously made him rethink his faith. And now he saw a vulture turning into a giant that he could not explain logically. Was that magic?
"Oh my, Your Majesty... You are so beautiful. How lucky this kingdom is to have a Queen like you."
He appeared in public with the utmost beauty in Troya's body. The finest ivory silk dress covered his perfect sensual curves. His smooth feet were covered with sandals made of buffalo skin. Diamond and ruby-eyed gold jewelry was attached to his neck and wrists. Not only that, a musk-scented perfume wafted from his neck and clothes. The nickname as the most beautiful man in Greece was not an exaggeration.
"My prince!" The waiter looked worried. He was carrying a papyrus scroll in his left hand. "I heard that a vulture approached you! The guard told me about it. Are you hurt?" The chatty pumpkin spoke worriedly.
"Yes, you are my lover. Someone I slept with more than once automatically becomes my lover."
Wait, I smelled something. Oh right, it's the smell of Drama *smirk* lol
Good. Draco nodded his head, followed Alden, then stunned and frowned when Alden led him to Harry's room.
"Prince Troya, are you all right?" One of the older women who were the temple caretaker greeted heartily.
Three.
Draco's body suddenly lost its passion, leaving only anger and heartache. Vlad imagines someone else while having sex with him, and that somehow hurt Draco's heart.
"Answer me, Draco?!" snapped Cedric.
Draco awkwardly blinked a few times when he heard Harry's command that sounded undeniable. Draco didn't want to be ruled by anyone! He will only follow orders that come from within himself.
"Oh, it's just that it wasn't what I thought."
Doctor Jason's laughter blared through the room. "Of course, even now, I know that all your bodyguards are surrounding this place, ready to shoot me whenever I let my guard down," Doctor Jason quickly moved next to Draco and stuck the sharp knife to his neck. "But before you kill me, I'll kill this bitch first."
Alden bowed his body slightly, his face expressionless. "I mixed my drug. You know what drug it is."
"The doctor is working on him. He has fluid in his lungs. How about you, my lord, are you all right? Plunging down from the second floor like that to save that kid…”
It seems love has made people think irrationally. How could they flaunt their affection in such an open place? Maybe they thought the storm wouldn't get anyone through the area. If so, they were so stupid.
Even though the man looked at him gloomily, Draco could still find a hint of anger in his eyes. Draco knew the slap he had just given must have hurt Cedric's heart. As a high-class nobleman, a slap was naturally classified as an insult.
Draco jumped in shock. He turned his head, and it was Harry who was standing in the middle of the room. The man seemed to be silent, watching Draco, who was staring out the window. Draco automatically clenched his fists, his impulsive reaction when he noticed Harry's powerful aura filling the room. Harry glanced at Draco's clenched fists, and a sinister smile appeared on his lips.
Cedric then folded his hands and placed them on the wooden table between him and Draco. Cedric rested his chin on the folds of his strong hands. With a smile on his face, he enjoyed Draco's beauty.
Draco stared at the hand, then growled. Angry, he slapped Harry's hand away and tried to get out of the narrow trunk himself despite a bit of difficulty because his legs and arms were stiffly folded in the cramped space and traveling some ten kilos. Finally, the long-haired man managed to stand out from the trunk with all his pride.
"No,"
"It's okay. I think you deserve a wedding. We'll invite all the gods of Olympus then. Do you want to arrange your own wedding?"
"Thank you for being willing to accept it gracefully. I don't think any other noble will ever accept their husband's mistress in their own residence," said Harry sincerely while looking at Draco's beautiful face.
"I already told him that I have you. He promised he wouldn't care no matter what we do," Ares responded flatly.
"Draco," Harry's voice was low. "If you don't listen to me, I'm gonna fire Doctor Jason from here and make sure not a single hospital, clinic, or anything else will hire him to work." he threatens.
"I'm getting married, Aphrodite," Ares announced. His almost naked body lay half-asleep on his bed. The moonlight peeked in thinly from his bedroom window, illuminating his perfectly sculpted physique.
"The humans and my family in Sparta, do you intend to punish them?" Draco asked anxiously.
The music had stopped, signaling the dance was over once Draco climbed the last ladder. The black-haired woman seemed to be looking for someone. Who on earth was My Lord referring to by that woman?
"Damn it," Harry cursed. He's still standing where he was.
The only noticeable difference between gods and humans was that their physiques were usually more attractive. The humans thought that the gods were nobles and wealthy landlords or relatives of kings who had enough money to buy expensive food and clothes.
He lifted his long legs onto the chair he'd been sitting on. He bent his long legs and embraced the bend with both hands. Draco buried his beautiful face in his legs. He closed his eyes at the same time as those beautiful eyes dripped with clear crystal.
Without waiting, Draco immediately dropped his body in a graceful motion onto the queen-sized bed. Draco also turned his back to Harry. He was too scared to look at his husband's face that always looked angry.
Perhaps of all the people there, Harry was the only one who looked at the girl with admiration because the people in this kingdom threw their disgust stares at Arabelle.
"Did Your Majesty not catch what Arabelle just said? Arabelle would definitely feel bad if she showed her legs to someone else—"
"Why are you suddenly being kind and asking me that?" Draco asked curiously as he pulled out a chair for him to sit on.
"Can I help you, sir?" the owner asked.
"No, you were caught because of your own stupidity," Ares replied.
Draco perked up at the names. "Was Hermione the one who sent you here?"
Harry's expression immediately changed, the man rose from his chair, and half sat on the bed, hugging Draco. "Draco? What's wrong with you? Draco?" he asked worriedly.
"I will not marry the woman Zeus offered," Ares folded his arms firmly.
"Excuse me, I have to calm my woman down," said Harry briefly as the man passed the King of the Delion.
“Has everybody got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?”  There was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class.  “I think we’ll try that again.  When I ask you a question, I should like you to reply ‘Yes, Professor Umbridge,’ or ‘No, Professor Umbridge.’  So, has everyone got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?”
“An animagus.  I only have my suspicions, but it is odd that it appeared as a stray in Hogsmeade shortly after Sirius Black escaped, and now it accompanies Potter and party, especially that Lupin.  Odd indeed.”
“No sir. I had heard rumours but had not believed them. He is not at the top of his class, sir,” I replied stiffly. He paused a moment, analysing my face before cocking his head with a slight smile.
“Relax Weasel, I’m not here to fight.  Just simply doing my rounds.”  I smirked.  Hermione rolled her eyes.
"I'm right next door too, you know,"  Harry chuckled lightly.
"Guess we're partners now."  Draco smiled at Harry
“It was fine,” Pansy said hotly.  We rode the rest of the way in comfortable silence, making idle conversation every so often.  The sky darkened as we moved farther north.  Soon, a heavy stream of rain pattered down over the train.  As we neared the castle, we walked the length of the train again for good measure and prepared for our departure duties.
"Harry Fucking Potter," Draco breathed.  Pansy looked back to Draco and started laughing.
“Okay.  Well, if not,” I whispered.  I drew his face up to mine and pressed a kiss on his lips.  I felt him smile against me as I pulled him closer.  “A good luck kiss,” I murmured against him.  He laughed lightly, his eyes still closed as I gently grazed my hand down his next and pulled him into an embrace.
“Oculus Reparo.”  I murmured.  Potter grunted again and put the fixed glasses on.
“I’ll go to Diagon Alley now to buy the new books,” My mother said, taking the book list from me. “Do you need anything else dear?” I shook my head.
“Malfoy, I swear to Merlin—”  Hermione grabbed his arm and pulled him back.
“It was murder.  Voldemort killed him, and you know it.”  Harry was shaking.
that was the last class!”  Pansy muttered once we were far enough from the classroom.  “She’s a nightmare!”  I chuckled lightly.
“Well don’t go mouthing off to profess—”  He cut me off with a kiss.
Pansy and I gathered our supplies and got to work.  Of course, it was an incredibly complicated potion and Pansy spent most of the first hour groaning and pouring over the instructions.
"Fine.  I do like these ear cuffs too," He mumbled as Pansy began squealing.
“They mistreated you that badly?”
What the hell am I supposed to do with you?
“Draco, for god’s sake, would you just look?”  I groaned and looked up.  Looking across the pretty empty Ravenclaw table (I bet they had the library full) to see Potter grimacing at his nearly empty plate.  Another Gryffindor boy said something to him and Potter just snapped his head up at him.
, Mr Thomas!  As I was saying — you have been introduced to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group, and potentially lethal.  You have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day —”
!”  He finally looked up at me with a glare.  “How’s your head?”  Concern in an insult?  My speciality, apparently.  “You feeling all right? Sure you’re not going to go berserk on us?”  Harry simply broke his glare as Weasel handed him the Prophet.  Crabbe and Goyle started snickering next to me and I quickly joined in.  Harry threw the paper down and glanced back towards us.  I couldn’t read his gaze — somewhere between exhaustion, confusion and
“Narcissa,” My father cut in, laying a hand on my mother’s shoulder.  “As much as I’m sure they would love to continue talking with us, they do have a train to catch.”  The train let out a high pitched whistle, causing many students to begin rushing forwards.
“No,” I whispered.  “I’m sorry.”  He pursed his lips and shook his head.
“I think I would have liked it better if you weren’t so distracting,” Draco laughed affectionately.
I slipped it over my wrist before a sob broke from my throat. The stone that had been resting on my shoulders the past two days finally crushed me. I knew that Voldemort likely had listening charms throughout the house, so I covered my mouth with a hand and silently sobbed. If he heard me…
“Harry?  What is it?”
“I figured it’s a better place to meet than the lake.  Secluded, hard to find.”
“Wormtail?”
“What’s it say?”  I sat up and stretched my neck, a pit growing in my stomach.
About a week and a half before the last task, I received a letter from my father, shorter and curter than the last one.  He noted that if all were to go to plan, then great times were coming.  Despite reading the message over multiple times, I still could not understand what he was talking about.  I decided not to tell Harry or Pansy about it, worried that it had something to do with my father’s love of the Dark Arts.  The last thing I needed right now was my father’s interests to get in between Harry and I and the new future I was carving out.
“They let him off,” He sneered as soon as he stepped foot in the room. My mother and I both flinched at his sudden presence. “
“You’re taking Arithmancy?” Pansy mumbled through a muffin.
“To be fair, she’s absolutely terrible,” Blaise commented.
“Okay, everyone’s here,”  The Head Girl began.  “As you know, you have all been selected to be Prefects for your house.  You have a duty to uphold as leaders in Hogwarts now.  As Prefects, you are expected to respect and uphold the rules of Hogwarts and the laws of the Magical World.  You are allowed to take and give points to students misbehaving, give detentions as punishments, patrol the halls after curfew, provide good examples to the younger classes, especially the First Years, as well as among your peers.”  She smiled at Hermione and Weasel.  Hermione smiled hesitantly while Weasel stuck his head high and puffed his chest out a bit.
“I know.  I need to.”  My voice warbled.  I needed to tell him even more now, with everything happening.  Pansy shifted and held her arms out.
"Yeah, well I feel bad for knocking you into that wall."  Harry eased Draco onto the couch.  "Ice?  Tea?  Pillow?  Anythi-"
“He’s got detention tomorrow,”  She muttered.  I clenched my jaw.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, pulling him so that they were chest to chest.  Draco placed his hands on Harry’s heated cheeks as their lips met in a fiery kiss.  Harry hoisted Draco onto his lap, his legs straddling Harry’s hips.  Harry’s cologne intoxicated Draco — he could barely remember his own name as Harry’s hands raked down his back.  Draco tangled his finger’s in Harry’s grown out curls, tugging lightly.  He bucked his hips forward when Harry gently bit down on his lip.  Harry groaned from the sudden friction, dragging his hands to Draco’s hips and pulled him down again.  Draco gasped, throwing his head back slightly.  Harry took the chance to gently bite down on Draco’s exposed neck, running his teeth and tongue down, sucking the slightly flushed pale skin.
“You said something about ‘dogging’ my footsteps.”  My stomach dropped.
“Let’s find Blaise, Crabbe and Goyle before we do our first round.”  Pansy and I only had to walk through a few cars before we found their compartment.
“I promise.”  He dropped my hand and moved his face closer to mine.  “Now come on, let’s just hang out.  I want to get my mind off the tournament for just a little while.”  I smiled and kissed him lightly.
“Spare me the lecture, Malfoy,”  He mumbled, trying to straighten himself out.  I looked at him for a moment before reaching my hand out to him.  He glanced from my hand to my face and I tried to look forgiving.  I don’t know how that is supposed to feel on my face.  “Huh?”
“Are you guys meeting soon?  The Leaving Feast is tomorrow,” She finally asked.  I sat up and shrugged.
"You want to talk about it?"  Draco asked quietly.
"Thank you,"  Draco whispered.
So there he was, in a questionable venue with a beer in his hand, his hair dyed a faded rainbow, wearing a loose muscle tank and black skinny jeans, staring at the stage with his jaw hanging open.  There was Harry Fucking Potter, standing on a stage with a pansexual flag tied around his neck, singing Panic! at the Disco's iconic bisexual anthem.  And boy, did he look phenomenal.
"How does that work?"  Draco muttered as Harry turned the volume up a bit.
We arrived at the Platform earlier than normal, my parents eager and thankful to get out of the house.  They stood proudly beside me, my mother straightening my robes and pin.  The chatter and excitement of the beginning year rejuvenated me briefly.
“You alright?”  She gently picked up my hand.
Thought we were too young to die,
“Do you mind a cleaning spell?” Harry asked.  Draco paused a moment, frozen from the sight of Harry on his knees, hair plastered against his face, cheeks red and lips wet and plump, before frantically nodding.  Harry mumbled the spell and Draco gasped at the cool magic filling him up.  Harry smiled before wrapping his mouth around Draco’s cock again.  His hands explored further, one finger slipping into Draco’s crack and massaging slightly.  Draco dropped his head back at the sudden overwhelming pleasure emanating everywhere Harry was touching.  He accidentally bucked his hips forward.  Harry pulled back and gagged slightly and Draco looked back down.
But we were on different sides,
“Obliviate.”  She shrugged.
"Come on, Malfoy!  I don't feel like cooking and you don't know how to!"  Harry leaned against the counter, jacket in hand.
“And I have too much homework to do,” He groaned quietly, hugging me even tighter.
.  Harry just let out a quiet, breathy laugh that made me melt.
“Hey!  How are you?”  I opened my arms to hug him but paused.  “Are you hurt anywhere—”
“Yeah,” said Harry, “but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.”  He raised a brow, smirking in challenge.  The others in the carriage laughed.
“Draco—”
“But Umbridge won’t listen to you!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I beg your pardon?”
“No!  Voldemort is back and I will not be silent about it!  You believe me, don’t you?”
“You too,” I muttered once I knew he was out of earshot.  I left a few minutes later, practically running back to the Common Room before curfew, dreading having to explain to anyone why I was out this late.  I smiled at Pansy as I passed her in the Common Room and went up to my room.  Blaise glared at me as I collapsed on my bed.  I pulled out a box of sweets before closing my curtains, curling up and eating my heart out before promptly falling asleep.
“Woah woah woah!”  He raised his hands.  “Give me three seconds to process this information?”  He took a long deep breath. “You, Draco Malfoy, like… me?”  I nodded.  “As in romantically?”  I nodded slower, looking away.  “Okay. How long?”
"I should shower at night so my hair is dry when I wake up!"  Draco said, walking past Harry to the bathroom.  Harry stuck his foot out enough to trip Draco and earn him a scowl.
"Fine."  He turned into the kitchen.  "I need a drink,"  He muttered to no one in particular.
"Well yeah, the way you two were dancing—"  Draco choked.
.  “But not everyone does, and it’s better to be on their good side when this whole thing comes to a head!  Arguing with Umbridge brings you nothing!”
“Hi.”  He looked down and swallowed.  “Look, I just wanted to apologise for last night.  I’m just tired and stressed and—”  I pulled him into my arms.
“It’ll get easier with time,” She whispered.
“You go first,” He muttered, barely meeting my eyes.  I swallowed thickly.
, Mr Potter!”  Harry thrust his fist in the air.  Umbridge turned away again, but now several other people had their hands up too.  “And your name is?”
“Don’t you trust me?” Harry asked softly.  I felt my heart weep at his tone — a child scared to be in trouble, a
“You’re a great friend Pansy,”  I mumbled, slowly growing tired from her head massage.
“He’s dead!”
“Only for the public.”  He mimicked.  “Yeah, I realize.”  He walked to the bathroom and slammed the door.  After a moment, the shower came on.  I closed the curtains and laid down, hoping to sleep well for once.  Except, for the next two hours, as Blaise banged about the room in a fury, I ran through Pansy’s plan in my head until I was certain of two things.
How was I supposed to know I'd fall for you?
The enclosure was surrounded by similar smaller trees, the red vines weaving around the outer trees and eventually ending on the ground.  The forest foliage fades into thick green grass covering the field.  Towards the right, a small pond lapped gently against the surrounding sand, and off to the left, wildflowers danced across the rest of the area.  It was secluded, empty, and, well, beautiful.  Plus, you couldn’t really just stumble across it, so it's relatively safe.
“The moment I say it, I’ll jinx everything.”  Pansy stayed silent for a moment.
Over the next few days, I pushed the pit of anxiety in my stomach away as Harry’s trial approached. I wished to reach out, tell him everything would be okay, hold his hand and kiss his head. I forced myself to not think about how worried he must be, to not think about his wonderful smile, stupid hair, brilliant eyes. If Voldemort were to see how I imagined him, how I thought of him, I would be dead in a matter of minutes. Or Imperioed to draw Harry out. Or Crucioed to spill information. Or my family killed— I found it best to not think of the consequences.
“Yes sir.”
“What?” Harry spat before I could even open my mouth.  He was wedged between Weasel and Weaselette, across from Longbottom, Hermione and a fourth-year Ravenclaw reading an odd magazine upside down.
"Really?"  Draco's jaw dropped.  He had only ever seen Harry with girls but then, as he thought about the lingering glances he'd caught Harry stealing at blokes throughout the years, he also wasn't entirely surprised.  He was more in shock that Harry could potentially reciprocate the slight feelings he was just coming to terms with it.
“Go on, then, Potter,”  I said quietly, drawing out my own wand.  I knew at this point I screwed up in calling Granger a Mudblood and deserved whatever it was Harry wanted to throw at me.  I just had to entice him enough.  “Moody’s not here to look after you now — do it, if you’ve got the guts —”  For a split second, we looked into each other’s eyes, then, at exactly the same time, both acted.
“Congratulations,” He murmured. “Taught your son well, Lucius.”
Eventually, they stopped shifting so far from each other, opting to stay next to each other.  They were careful not to touch each other if they could help it, but on the rare occasion, Draco's hand would pass over Harry's when pointing something out or Harry's elbow would bump Draco's or when they accidentally sat too close and their knees would touch, both men would feel a hot flush rise to their cheeks and would turn away before the other could notice.  Draco would cover the sudden dryness of his mouth with a light cough and Harry would scrunch his nose and fiddle with his glasses in an attempt to refocus on the book in his lap.  Neither man would speak of this but rather had a silent agreement that less touching was better.
"Safe to assume you aren't together?" Harry finally asked.
but somehow our wands met and all these lights started sparking out.  Then these… these echoes of Voldemort’s last kills appeared — my mother and father, Cedric, Voldemort’s father, Bertha Jorkins — they spoke to me.  When the connection broke, they shielded me for long enough so I could get back to the Cup.”  Harry was no longer wiping the tears, letting them fall as he sobbed through the story.  “Cedric asked me to take his body back.  I got to the Cup and then I was outside the maze.  Dumbledore was there, and, well, you know the rest.”  He wiped the tears from his face before turning fully to look at me.  “He’s back.  He’s really back.”  I wrapped him in my arms before choking out a breath.
“I understand.  You should try to talk to him before tomorrow.”
“Thanks.”  He smiled and opened the door.
“Buffoon!  That’s the best thing you’ve called me!”  He kept laughing, nearly keeling over. “Okay, okay!”  He pressed the bridge of his nose.  “Okay, I’m sorry. Just—”  He started laughing again then let out a long sigh.  “Okay, I’m okay now.”  He looked at me suppressing a smile.
Grey eyes and lips of lies and that dark tattoo.
"We went to this prestigious boarding school up north of Aberdeen, and everyone was called by their last names. It just sorta became a habit," Harry explained as if he had rehearsed it a hundred times. Draco understood why Harry was quick to cut him off — he already had a Muggle backstory that made sense.
“Thanks, Malfoy.”  He stared at me for a moment and I tried to smile.  I guess I didn’t do it too well because he quickly walked away, his head down again.
“Yeah.”
"This place?"  He scoffed.  "It's entirely red inside!  Surely their food can't be that good."  The man behind the counter heard Draco and shot him a quick glare.
Now his hands were all over Draco — on his neck and face, fingers tangling in his hair.  Draco was soft in ways Harry could never have imagined and he loved coddling the slim boy.  Draco, on the other hand, loved every one of Harry Potter’s edges, his broad shoulders and defined muscles his favourite.  He ran his hands over Harry’s arms as Harry gently pushed him down on the couch.  Harry moved his lips down Draco’s neck, tugging the turtleneck down enough to reach the tender skin it hid.  Draco let out a soft whine at the feeling on Harry’s lips and beard moving down his body.
