“Some friends you are,” Seamus called as he grabbed Colin’s hand and pulled him towards the great hall Dean following as they left me and George with Ron and Hermione.
“Of course I will he will never be hurt again as long as I have a say. Dragon’s mate for life,” I stated pulling Neville closer to me.
“Do you like that love?” I asked releasing his now swollen lips. Percy was too far gone at this point so all I got was a small nod. I smile and said, “Good the night is only starting.”
“Where is he Seamus?” Dean asked in panic. I was about to answer when my arm began to sting, burning in pain, causing me to gasp. Everything was screaming at me to go to the Gryffindor common room and find my mate.
Ollie had decided that we needed a little romance, so he decided to take me on a walk around the back lake. We talked about our fith and sixth year, and all the crazy things we had used to do just so we could see eachother. It brought back happy memories of all the dates we had been on, and all of the kisses that were stolen.  It also made me think of all the time we had lost. Because of Penelope we had lost four years. If only I had listened to Oliver; maybe I wouldn’t be stuck with some job that I hate. Maybe my realtionship with my family wound’t be so strained.
I squeezed Fred’s hand tightly as those red sparks came from the maze. Viktor my sweet shy mate was in there possibly fighting for his life and I could do nothing. No one should ever have to risk their life for entertainment.   It was barbaric and cruel. Viktor had only entered to make his parents happy; he didn’t care about eternal glory or the prize money. All I can do is hope, nut it crushes my heart to let him be in danger.
; I’m pretty sure everyone is will be eating with the snakes,” Malfoy stated looking at George and myself.
“It doesn’t concern you!” Colin shouted as he stood up quickly; almost instantly his body collapsed into my arms do to blood loose. His breathing became shallow and his consciousness faded leaving  me crying out his name in shock.
“None that we can contact on such short notice, besides you were planning to stay with Blaise as a phoenix were you not? If you take the job you would be given a teacher’s apartment then you can stay at Hogwarts as a human,” McGonagall stated giving me a cunning look.
“So are we alright now?” Seamus asked as Dean jumped on him. It almost felt like they had forgotten I was there as well, and it sent a dark feeling through my heart.
Harry: is a water elf so emotions and high stress affect him in a very bad way; because he didn’t not have a connection with his parents he is not able to bond with many people; it was only when he found his mate that he began to be able to cope with stress and negative emotions.
“Call him here then,” Bagman ordered impatiently. The man really was not very imposing for a tournament master; in fact he was even sweating as he spoke.
“ALBUS DUMBLERDORE! GET OFF MY THRONE!” was bellowed as two imposing figures entered the great hall. The taller of the two was a mass of Muscle. He had shaggy, long brown hair that was tied back with a deep red ribbon, and startling black eyes. He wore old fashioned robes that looked something like a knight would wear, and a giant Scythe was strapped to his back. The other man had loose flowing black hair, piercing green eyes, and Greek inspired robes. His body was surrounded by an ethereal glow almost as if he came down from heaven itself.
Tonight was the night that the three tri-wizard champions would be chosen and you could feel the tension. if a Gryffindor won they would just lord it over everyone’s head for eternity, if a Ravenclaw won they would cheer politely and then quickly return to their studies not really even caring about the tournament that much, if it was a snake they would smirk for a while then study about everything and anything they could so that they would survive, and if it was a Hufflepuff they would humbly accept the honour.  All in all almost everyone in the school was pumped for the tournament to begin. The only one that wasn’t was my little mate Harry. He was completely shaken. Our lack of bond also didn’t help in the matter. Because of the fact that we had only just discovered our inheritance we didn’t have time to form a proper mental bond; because of the required intimacy.
“I am sorry it took so long to find you, but now I need your help.” Hades moved closer to the two of us and placed a hand on each of our shoulders as he teleported us out of our prison and to his own domain of the underworld. The king of the dead sat on his throne with a worried expression, “my son, Blaise, is a student at Hogwarts and I fear that he may be imprisoned or worse killed for his powers. I need you to reclaim your school to insure not only his safety but all the students’ safety.”
“Cedric?” I called trying to get me adopted brother’s attention. Cedric turned towards us and lifted his wand.
“What about Ron and Hermione have you seen them today?” Lee asked, suspicion clear in his voice, and I paled at the tone.
“W-why are y-you doing t-this? I-I’m not s-special,” I stuttered as my heart called out to the man that I knew was my soul mate.
“C-Crouch is f-forcing me to take over h-his place a-as a tournament judge. P-Penelope is angry at m-me for b-breaking off the c-courtship *hic* and she t-threw m-me out*hic*,” I stuttered and Fred pulled me into a tight hug as tears streamed down my face.
“Bone of the father, unwillingly given.” He picks up a bone at the foot of the grave and drops it into the cauldron, “Flesh of the servant, willingly sacrificed.” He grabs a knife and screams as he cuts off his own hand the severed appendage falling into the mixture. He then turns to me a maniacal smile on his face as he stalks over and grabs my arm tightly cutting it deep well sneering, “Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken!” he drops the crimson liquid into the cauldron before grabbing the body. He drops it and screams, “The Dark Lord shall rise again!”
“I-I’m fine D-Dray,” I whispered shivering slightly as the cold wind howled around the stands. All of the judges, but Percy, where staring at Bagman as he announced who had one the task. Karkoff had a pleased face as they announce that Viktor was now in first place.
The great hall had collectively gasped and gone silent once again; Fred and George Weasley as well as the boy-who-just-would-not-die had just openly sat with the snakes instead if their own house. Not only that Cedric and the other champions had sat with them. The 4 Hogwarts students breaking school tradition with their action; something that hadn’t happened since Dumbledore became headmaster.
I had just shot up Fleur’s sparks and was running away from the area like a blind man. This was a nerve racking game; it was a complete death sentence, turn’s right. I needed to find Cedric and Viktor, Turn’s left. We could all get the cup and share eternal glory, Duck. Then this whole thing would be over and we all could win.
” I whispered as we crawled into my large bed. Harry gave a nod before curling deeper under the soft comforter.  I laughed softly at my mate’s innocent display before shutting off the lights and following Harry to Morpheus’ call.
Viktor: a submissive wood nymph who is being courted by George. He is rather self-conscious about being a submissive because his parents are always saying that he is a failure because of it.
“C-Ced please c-calm d-down we’ll figure out a way to get t-through this,” Harry stuttered and Draco pulled him into a protective hug; snapping me back to reality as the guilt of startling my little brother set in.
Crouch and his idiotic department are making Percy go crazy; plus he has decided to make Percy take over his job as a judge for the tri-wizard-tournament.
“What’s going to happen now, Draco?” Theo asked as he and the rest of the guys came over to our growing group. The nine of us were now standing just outside of the great hall with a variety of different emotions displayed. The three of age champions were looking at Harry with great concern, Theo and Blaise sympathetic of Harry’s situation, Crab and Goyle were either Hungry or angry, Harry was just plain scared, and I was completely angry.
“ONLY ONE!” a merman screeched as I reached the tiny blond. The merfolk grabbed and scratched me as we broke the surface of the water beside the stands. Cedric and Draco pulled us out of the water, and wrapped us in thick towels. Gabriela was passed to Viktor and Fleur who were kick to pull the girl into a tight hug as George joined them.
“Hey George wait up!” Cedric yelled as he and Lee came running towards me. See Lee made me want to destroy him for my twins’ pain, but one look at his frantic face held me back.
Blast that fool Dumbledore. How is it that he is the only one to ever realize our secret, and how was it that in his first year he had enough power to trap me and my mate in these magic suppressing prison.  For 100 years we have been stuck under the black lake and yet we were no closer to escaping this hell. The only thing that kept me sane was that he has not taken my precious angel out of my arms.
“I c-can’t take much m-more Ollie. I h-hate working for the m-ministry. She *sniffle* f-forced me to take a j-job that w-would make us l-look good. I e-ended things w-with her and she s-slapped me before t-throwing me out. I c-can’t take a-anymore,” by now I was full on sobbing as I explained everything that has been holding me back for years.
It was finally here. The final task was happening, and I hated it. Harry was in that maze and I could do nothing at all to protect my beautiful mate. He was there fighting and facing something no one our age should ever face. The only good thing that has come out of the damned tournament was the bonds that had been formed and the allies gained that and seeing Harry so happy at the yule ball.
“Ah that; you see in my family all males have the ability to becomes a Phoenix. It allowed me to survive when Voldemort tried to kill me. I have been hiding in the forbidden forest for the last four years watching over Blaise. I had to reveal myself as a hooded creature attacked my little mate.  To ensure he healed properly, not that I doubt Madame Pomphrey’s abilities, I moved him to the black Manor,” Regulus explained holding Blaise close to him.
“What in the bloody name of magic herself does Neville have to apologize for?” Oliver growled as the bed room door clicked open and my brother and Neville stepped out.
I smiled a lazy and content smile and pet Colin’s hair; my other hand intertwined with Dean’s. Both Dean and I had a content smile; while Colin was panting and looked slightly sleepy.
“Glad we found you guys.” Cedric said ruffling Harry’s hair. The poor shaken boys seemed to just melt into his brother’s touch.
“Who knows brother of mine,” I replied as we turned the corner; coming face to face with Harry, five Slytherins, and three older champions.
“G-Godric, please just sit down,” I pleaded. My body had begun to grow even weaker which caused my mate to worry even more.
“Do you really think, that as a Veela myself, I can’t pick a Veela out of a crowd,” Draco stated smugly.
Cedric: Hogwarts champion and Harry’s adoptive brother. He is also a wood elf and has adopted Harry and helped him through his inheritance.
“Are you alright Blaise? Can you tell me what your Attacker did?” Severus asked in a rare display of his affection for his snakes.
“S-sorry I h-have no idea w-were they have gone o-off to,” I stuttered feeling bad for lying to them.
“You heard me I don’t want you near that ass again!” Lee shouted grabbing my shoulders forcefully, “if I see you talking to that bastard again I swear I will lock you in our room and never let you out again!”
“Cedric take harry to call his magic guardian and make sure that he doesn’t run off,” Dumbledore stated with a dismissive look.
“Well look who decided to show his face; the-boy-who-lived-to-be-an-attention-seeking-poof!” Ron shouted angrily.
Dumbledore: Was bonded to Grindelwald, and because he was the one to defeat him he has lost most of his mental capacity to grief. He is currently responsible for all the stress and abuse that has been placed on Harry.
“Go to the room near the portrait of wolves and say freedom and integrity,” Snape stated as he turned to deal with the frozen boys.
“I will inform you of what happened later Draco; I need to speak with Severus first,” my father stated as he left the room.
“What’s wrong?” Dean asked as Seamus plopped down beside me and placed his hand on my knee; causing a blush to creep onto my face.
“Harry are you alright?” Cedric asked moving closer to me, “Harry your name came out of the goblet didn’t it?”
“What do you think Colin?” I asked turning to the beautiful blonde only to discover he wasn’t there. That alone sent an unsettling feeling in my stomach. My inner Veela was screaming at me to find the little blonde angel.
I quietly snuck away from Percy’s apartment to go searching for Viktor. It was a very big shock to discover that Viktor was my submissive mate; most people would place him as a dominant. Viktor was actually rather insecure about his inheritance so it took me forever to get him to warm up to me.
I sighed and kicked another pebble; Dean and Seamus had gotten detention and Lee was being an ass so I had no one to talk to or hang out with. Taking a walk seemed like a good ideas so I bundled up and headed out to the beach of the black lake. It surprised me to see how possessive Lee was of the twins; it was almost as if he was one of the twins’ dominants well at least if he was Fred’s dominant.
“I am sorry Harry,” I whispered uncharacteristically soft. It was shocking but I knew magic law. One could not do harm to an elfling, physical or magical, without one’s own magic core turning on them. An adult elf was different as they already had a taint on them, but an elfling was still so pure. To harm Harry now would be completely disastrous.
I sighed as another blast of wind swirled around me. My heart aches to have the same kind of love that Draco and Harry shared. I only wished to have someone hold me after a bad day, to have someone whisper sweet nothing in my ear, to have someone that I could trust with my whole life. As a demi-god I was forever looking over my shoulder waiting for a monster or creature to sneak up on me and end me. I knew I was not expected to live past my 3
The reaction happened instantaneously. Charlie grabbed the submissive day walkers hand and dragged him towards the bedroom the boy had just come from.  None of the people in the living room could do anything but stare in disbelief as the bedroom door slammed shut with a loud crash.
“A water elf sir,” he whispers smiling shyly as my eyes go wide a bond forming between us. I watch as Harry gasps, “W-what was that…?”
a voice called pulling me from the darkness I had drifted into. Blinking a few times I came face to face with my blonde mate, “
“Zee boy is right you cannot speak to him vithout magic guardian,” Madame Maxime growled as she moved closer to Dumbledore.
“When a creature of pureness that is underage is around this tournament the goblet, unless tampered with, will not allow them to participate. Mr. Potter, no matter how powerful he is, is not powerful enough to tamper with the goblet of fire,” Bagman snapped.
I smile and feed Harry another chocolate covered strawberry. The little elf seemed to love anything chocolate and I was more than happy to indulge him. After all the heartbreak Harry had suffered I had not the mind or wish to deny him any that he wants. Plus he completely adorable eating sweet’s, “another love?”
“Hey Colin, do you know where Seamus and Dean are?” Fred asked as he, George, and Lee entered the common room.
“Come love let us go have some fun,” Regulus whispered and pulled me down the corridor towards the great hall. The doors seem to have been blown open and the hall was silent.
“He will be alright The. Remember Draco and Cedric made sure he knew everything and anything he would need to know,” Fred said as he and his twin sat down beside Dean, Seamus, and Colin. There was another surprising thing Harry had managed to form a close alliance with both the Snakes and a bunch of select Lions.
“A change in staff if you will allow me to, I will explain everything. I am Salazar Slytherin, Blaise’s Guardian Angel. Your father charged me and my mate with the duty of protecting you and this school. We could not accomplish this with Dumbledore still in power as headmaster so using an old Law my mate created, we excommunicated him and Lady Sprout has taken his place,” Salazar started moving close to Blaise.
“R-Ron and H-Hermione cornered us and forced Seamus and Dean to a-attack you. If they d-didn’t agree R-Ron said he would attack me instead o-of y-you,” I stuttered sadly and Draco growled giving me a look of disbelief, “y-you don’t have to b-believe me I j-just wanted y-you to know the truth.”
“Stuff is Jordan!” George growled and pulled Fred closer to him, “you have no right to talk to him like that.”
; you still have all your other friends. Just forget about those two,” Draco murmured as he wrapped his arms around Harry; the shaken boy sinking into the welcoming comfort instantly.
“H-he is right S-Seamus,” a soft voice croaked. Gasping Seamus and I turned towards Colin’s bed to see him looking straight at us, “w-where are w-we?”
“Ronald Bilius Weasley! What in the world do you think you are doing?” A red haired man snarled from behind Ron; causing the three Weasley brothers to turn in shock.
“He is right Malfoy people are look at you strangely,” Seamus stated as he closer to the two; Dean and Colin were right behind him.
“Contact Wood Percy is going to need his support to get through this,” Charlie stated, “I’m going to go to bed you should both do the same.”
“Can I eat with you Dray?” Harry asked softly. His whole demerger was different from last year; if possible he was even more innocent.
“Get lost you arse!” Cedric growled as he moved to get up and force the boy to leave. Ron just gave him a scathing look before turning his attention to his brothers.
I laughed as my twin tackled Charlie. It was the first time since we found out what Percy has been through that they acted like children and it was truly a nice sight.
“Colin, where are you?” I called out softly praying for an answer, but no reply. Trying again I got my heart breaking response. I could hear whimpering from the bathroom. Quickly I opened the bathroom door I found Colin, but it was a sight I never wanted to see. Sitting on the floor sobbing was my little angel and his arms were covered in blood, “C-Colin!”
“I r-really don’t h-have a place t-to s-stay at the m-moment and I w-was hoping t-that I would be able t-to stay at Hogwarts,” I said sadly
“L-Lord Hades!” Godric stuttered causing me to gasp. What did one of the most powerful entities in the world want with us?
“Big mistake!” I growled moving closer faster than he could react I grabbed the figure by his neck and threw him out of my way snapping his neck in the process. Unfortunately this caused his fingers to be ripped out of my mates’ entrance and my little one to scream. I wrapped my little one in a tight hug as I whispered calming, loving word as my natural magic healed any of the injuries the poor boy had. “Be calm my mate I bust move you, but it might hurt.”
“What does he have to apologize for? You are the ones that beat my grandson.” A strong female voice called from the door way. Standing there was Professor Snape and a very regal looking woman; neither of which looked the least bit impressed at the moment.
“Don’t worry Perce I am just taking us somewhere more comfortable,” Oliver stated as he placed me on the bed and climbed in as well; his arms instantly wrapping around me, “now tell me everything that you can’t hand yourself.”
I laughed as Oliver, once again, throw out his toast. He was trying to make me a nice light lunch but it seemed that every time he went near the simple appliances in the kitchenette they just seemed to stop working and spaz out.
It was a rather interesting sight to see the normally composed Percy Weasley tackled to the ground and smile about it, “Hello Fred, George,” Percy said.
“Let’s hope you are right because here Harry comes,” Crabbe stated just as the cannon fired signalling Harry’s turn.
“Yes; I w-will bond w-with you,” I whispered softly, but George still heard me. His face lit up and me pulled me into a tight hug. He placed kisses on my neck and face, and all I could do was melt into his touch. It felt right as I this was always where I was meant to be and I couldn’t be happier.
“What the hell is going on with those two today?” George asked in disbelief. Ron and Hermione had been bitching and complaining about Harry all morning and I was finally getting to my last nerve.
“Then let me help you get through this and after the tournament I promise you that I will take care of you for the rest of our lives together,” Oliver vowed wiping the tears from my cheek.
“I c-couldn’t have asked f-for more for m-my f-first time!” Colin stated with a yawn and soon he was out like a light. This caused Seamus to smile, kiss Colin on the cheek, and follow the younger boy’s example and accept Morpheus’s call.
I stared at George as if he had grown a second head. Had I actually heard him right? “W-why would you w-want to b-bond to me?”
I felt like I was floating. My body was completely weightless. No pain, no fear, just peace. I was a strange sensation but rather pleasing. Most of my life was spent fearing that I would die any second from an attack so these new feelings were amazing, but how was it happening. Children of hades never felt this.
“Cedric before you leave I would like to have a word with you,” Dumbledore said in his usual grandfatherly voice; that sickened me to no end. Lucius was standing by Harry at the door waiting for me so we could get him down to Draco and quickly. Harry himself was looking rather meek next to the man.
“What do you think! My mate is with a healer and I have no idea if he will be alright or not!” I snapped as my father and Severus entered the room. Harry with them, but still unconscious in my father’s arms.
“I promise I won’t yell anymore. I am just worried about the tournament,” I stated and Harry finally looked at me. His eyes were glassy, but none of the tears fell.
I felt myself be lifted and a burning sensation shot through my body. Those Ravenclaw boys had been targeting me since I had come into my inheritance. My family had a long history of producing dominant male day walkers and submissive female day walkers, but every hundred years of so a submissive male day walker is born. These submissive day walkers are said to always bring good luck to the family, but misfortune for themselves. This of course only really lasted until they found their mates. Once they found their mates they clung to them and sought protection. They always tried to please them so to not be abandoned by them. Submissive day walkers new their mates by the sound of their voice. “Freedom and Integrity,” a deep voice whispered that sent shivers down my spine. It wasn’t possible; I was too young to meet my mate.
I watched as my little mate wandered closer to the forbidden forest. He seemed so depressed tonight, but surely he would not be foolish to move closer to the dangers that lurked in those woods at night. Unfortunately he was too distracted by his thoughts tonight to realise how close he was to the evil that made its home there. Suddenly a shadowed figure jumped the boy pushing him to the ground and ripping off his pants. I quickly shifted to my human form just as my mate screamed, “Don’t please! I don’t want this! I’m begging you don’t do this!”
I had gotten my egg and was waiting for them to announce that Harry had completed the task. My nerves were going haywire; every fiber of my being was telling me to grab Harry and Draco and just run.
“Oh Percy,” I whispered as Percy thrashed about in his sleep. He had been having nightmares since the first task, and the howlers did not help either. They had come from his mother, Clearwater, and surprisingly Albus Dumbledore himself. His mother was angry that he broke off the relationship with Clearwater to be with me, and she firmly believed that I had somehow brainwashed my sweet Percy into breaking things off with the bitch. The Bitch, Clearwater, just degraded him and reinforced any negative thing she had ever told Percy. Dumbledore was the most shocking, he stated that Percy must judge fair and not give Harry any special treatment. It sickened me that Dumbledore had plans for not only Harry, but for Percy as well. I know that he was the one that told Clearwater about me and Percy as it was the only way she could have found out, after all the girl was rather dense when it came to things like this. She was more book smart then she was street smart. Looking back down at my mate I vowed to bring down Dumbledore so we could have a bit of peace in our lives.
“Fine we will eat at the manor!” Mr. Malfoy said in exaspration as his son sat down next to me with smug look. Draco instantly wrapped his arm around my waist, causing me to blush at the blatent show of affection.
“O-ollie… please I need you so much,” I moaned and leaned into the keepers touch. Oliver froze at my words before pulling me into his arms, picking me up, and all but sprinting to our bedroom. He gently placed me on the bed and climbed on top of me.
“Do not fear young one, it seems magic has blessed you today. She has formed a bond between us, one of family,” I say gently the boys eyes widening, “I will never hurt you again Harry, and I will always be here to guide and protect you.”
“B-because they w-were forced t-to d-do it by Ron and H-Hermione,” the small blonde boy blurted out, startling me.
“Yeah bright eyes, without you Dean and I would have been expelled,” Seamus stated and joined the hug.
“Unity,” Charlie stated and dragged us into the room. The room itself was actually very large. It had a large sitting room and its own kitchen. There were four doors in the back and each door had a different letter on it.  The first door was made out of cedar and had a red C hanging on it. The next door was white with an orange G on it and the one next to also white, but it had a green F. the final door was oak with a lavender P.
I did as the voice suggested but the light immediately hurt my eyes, “Ugh…. T-to bright…” I whisper softly shutting my eyes.
“Attention Students; please return to you houses for the night,” McGonagall called, “except for you Mr. Zabini.”
“ALBUS!” Madame Maxime yelled as I pulled Harry towards the floo. Said boy looked ready to start cry by this point.
“I will always care about my Little Dragon, in fact I never stopped caring about you. I thought about your beautiful blue eyes and you soft red curls every second we were apart,” Oliver whispered as he picked me up in his strong Quidditch toned arms causing me to squeak and wrap my own arms around his neck as he carried me to my room.
“Yeah we’re just making sure the fucking blood sucker knows his place!” another boy cheered until I stalked over to the blonde who had spoken first, picked him up and smashed him into the wall behind me leaving a slight dent from the force of the impact. Releasing the boy he slid down and slumped over, on the wall behind him was a small amount of dripping down the wall behind him. The Ravenclaws seeing this finally realised that I would not be tolerating or turning a blind eye to their actions. Just as they were all about to run off Snape came around the corner he locked eyes with me for a second before nodding and casting a sticking and silencing charm on the Ravenclaws before telling me to grab Neville.
It had now been two days since Colin was brought into the hospital wing almost dead and neither I nor Seamus had left his side once. It was now known to the school that we were all mated together as it was the only way to convince them to allow us to stay.
“No I stopped him in time but that is why we were away for the day,” Regulus stated not missing a beat.
“MY problem! What’s Fred’s problem he is the one fucking the bloody enemy!” Shouted Lee giving me a scathing look.
“Please no! Anything but that,” I whimper and try to scurry away, but his grip is to strong. A second hand is placed on the small of my back, but it doesn’t stay there long/ the monster slid his hand down to the top of my pants, and with one swift pull my pants and underwear had been ripped off. The monster released my shoulders and sat on my back. He spread my cheeks and I cringed as I felt something wet prod my entrance. No. No. No. This can’t happen. “Don’t please! I don’t want this! I’m begging you don’t do this!” I screamed tears streaming down my face.
“Harry calm down everything will be just fine,” Cedric stated as he paced his strong hand on my shoulder.
Dean and Seamus had just left to go and preform Ron’s job; they were supposed to corner Harry and beat him for entering the tri-wizard tournament and sitting with the snakes. If they didn’t then Ron and Hermione would go after me.  Neither option was favorable, but I would rather have Hermione and Ron going after me than have the most important people in my life hurting their friend.
“Don’t worry little elf, nothing will happen to you as long as I am here,” Cedric stated; enclosing me in a hug as the door was thrown open by a group of very angry people. My instincts told me to run as far away from them as I could get.
I felt pain throughout my whole body; then nothing. I actually felt nothing, “my lord can you open your eyes?”
“You listen here Albus Dumbledore! I will not stand to see any student with an inheritance that you deem to be ‘dark’ abused and mistreated. You will find yourself out of a job very soon as I am taking this incident to the board of governors and they will see to it that you are fired. Good now one more thing we are not average day walkers we are the royal family that rules over are whole kind. Submissives such as Neville are a treasure that is never to be harmed, so I demand an apology from everyone involved in his injuries, or I will be taking this to the ministry!” the head of the Longbottom house was a forced to be reckoned with, and I felt no pity for anyone who challenged her.
“They were together before Percy became head boy, but Clearwater threatened them so Percy broke up with Oliver to protect his career. Percy just wanted Oliver to be safe; it is why he has been so miserable they were mates.”
“Just remember all the r=things that we covered and you will be fine,” Cedric left to go and accomplish his task leaving me alone in the champions tent. How was I going to survive the most dangerous dragon ever known? The Hungarian Horntail was going to kill me for sure.
“Honestly I have absolutely no clue all I know is that Harry will not be going into this alone!” I stated.
“You boys are free to go,” Snape stated and Seamus didn’t need to be told twice before pulling us out of the room.
“I would get off him!” A voice growled causing me to look up at the most handsome person I had ever scene.
“He is right love I don’t care that you aren’t a stereotypical submissive because it doesn’t matter as you are perfect for me. I could never love anyone but you,” George declared as he stepped out from being the tree, “you mind giving us some privacy Colin?” the blonde boy nodded and left rather quickly; leaving me alone with George.
“Makes sense,” Draco says. And then, before he can swallow the words, “You’re not a miserable teacher.” He feels his neck flush under Harry’s careful gaze and backtracks. “If you tell anyone I’ve said that, I’ll deny it ‘til the very end.”
A beautiful, rosy flush migrates up Harry’s neck and cheeks as he strides towards the coffee pot. Draco hides his grin against his shoulder.
Draco shoves his hands in the pockets of his coat and glances at Volchii’s main street. Their argument has drawn a bit of attention. A handful of spectators unashamedly gawk at the small-town spectacle, their faces shrouded behind their visible puffs of breath.
“Hey! Perk up, buttercup. I won’t take any attitude from you, young man. Too early for that shit.” Rory’s eyes brighten when they fall on Draco. “Who’s the
“You could die,” Pansy had noted a few weeks ago, speaking to her own reflection as she applied a crisp winged eyeliner. “No one would know. No international Floo connection, no owls. What are you going to do? Get a Muggle phone?”
Draco huffs a breath and adjusts in his seat, tucking his legs beneath him. They need to obtain the hair and make the wand on the night of the full moon. On any other night, it wouldn’t be tangible to pluck, and what may happen to the exposed core when the full moon begins to wane? How are they supposed to steal a hair from a wolf on the one night a month it can hunt without getting killed in the process?
She circles the counter and hops up to sit next to the register, showing off the holes in her jeans.
Draco nods and takes a deep breath, kindling his confidence. He proceeds seamlessly through the extraction charms and ends with a handful of solid pieces, pulsing with magic.
Potter bends over in his seat, shoulder rolling as the window disappears into the door. He sits back up, face painted with the same old untameable temper and righteous fury.
“What, scared of a few wolves, Malfoy?” Potter asks mischievously. He turns to stand in front of Draco, an arrogant grin on his face, and howls, long and sweet. The moonlight shines on the long column of his throat as he throws his head back, tossing his voice into the darkened sky. When he runs out of air, he faces Draco and laughs, his eyes wild behind the visible veil of his heaving breaths.
“Don’t flatter yourself, Potter. Now, why did we need to work at this ungodly hour of the morning?” Draco slumps on a stool, resting his weight across the table.
Draco can’t help but shake his head at the irony in escaping halfway across the world to have the personification of his ugly history standing in front of him, letting him into his car, showing him the guest bed in his home. After arriving at his cabin, Potter had mumbled, “There’s food in the fridge,” before practically running away, as though he couldn’t stomach the sight of Draco standing in his living room. Draco had crossed his arms over his chest and watched him leave, unsure of what to do and puzzled about the
Draco sees himself smirk in the reflection of Potter’s glasses before the light shatters above them, cloaking the kitchen in glass shards and the darkness of an Alaskan winter.
Harry ignores Draco’s comment as he plods ahead, wearing a light jacket and faded blue jeans. He clears patches of snow with a careless wave of his hand, exposing the rotting leaves and spindly roots underneath.
Under the unrelenting judgment of harsh green eyes, Draco thinks perhaps Potter hasn’t really changed either. At least not in the ways that matter.
From then on, every rock that was thrown at him, he used as a stepping stone. Succeeding was a necessity. He could ignore the rest.
The wolf’s blood pressure drops dangerously around mid-afternoon as they wait for the Blood-Replenishing Potion to take effect. A rapid infusion of fluid is enough to maintain a plateau, however. When her heart rate finally begins to drift towards normal, Draco nearly sobs.
“Don’t mention it,” Harry replies. A series of loud, syncopated crackles echoes off the buildings at the other end of the street, and the sky pulses with a glow of green and purple. “Looks like they didn’t want to wait for us.”
“Why not? You said you can pet them on the full moon,” Draco argues, gesturing vaguely out the window.
They finish the remainder of their walk in silence. As they cross onto the main street, Draco puzzles at the sight before him. A look upwards reveals the faint outline of a set of massive Shield Charms that encapsulate the town, as though Volchii were trapped inside of a snowglobe. Although a dusting of snow still coats the streets and the rooftops, the large flakes outside the shields simply roll off, cascading down the outside of the bubble like a snowy waterfall. He marvels for a moment at the magic required to envelop an entire town in complex Shielding Charms.
Potter lets his hair down and runs a hand through the damp waves, and Draco stares awkwardly as Potter uses his shirt to wipe the fog from his glasses. Clear vision restored, Potter’s eyes focus on Draco, curled in the armchair and probably looking a mess from sleep. Self-conscious, Draco runs a hand through his own hair and straightens his shirt. He wrinkles his nose in irritation that, years later, Potter still irrationally rattles his nerves.
“Well, if it was a choice between chronic overcomplication or being an arrogant git, I’m glad you went with overcomplication,” Harry says, grinning. “I mean that in the nicest way possible, of course.” There’s a softness to Harry’s gaze, and Draco tries to remember if anyone ever looked at him like that.
Draco scoffs and shovels a potato into his mouth. It burns his tongue, provoking a prickle of tears, which Draco is quick to blink away.
Time misbehaves on the other side of the world. Though it’s just past noon, the day hurtles towards twilight, and the sinking sun casts a rosy, golden glow filtered between snow-covered branches. The sunlight that permeates between the boughs reflects off the snow, making Draco squint as he weaves between the trees.
Draco picks up Harry’s wand, rolling it between his fingers and tracing the grooves with his fingernail.
to call me that, and you’ve been here for a few weeks!” Harry says, wide-eyed and open-mouthed. “Ridiculous… Well, when May says go, you don’t wait. Or you’ll learn some terms that aren’t so nice.”
The room is coated in a dusky, purple light when a cold gust of wind pulls Draco from his accidental slumber. He looks up to find Potter dusting snow from his boots at the front door. Draco wipes the sleep from his eyes and watches Potter remove his coat, hat, and scarf. Tiny snowflakes stand out against his dark, damp hair that’s tied in a messy knot at the base of his neck. Potter is no longer the scrawny, underfed boy Draco met at Madam Malkin’s all those years ago, but he’s not exactly muscled either. Glasses still sit on the skinny bridge of his nose, although the frames are thinner, more sophisticated than the thick, black frames of yore. With the exception of his winter clothes, he could have been plucked straight from Draco’s nightmare.
Draco rolls his eyes and waits, his gaze shifting frantically as he tries to keep up with the hockey players on the screen. It doesn’t take long before the sound of too many footsteps draws his attention away from the game.
Despite the bitter cold outside, Draco starts sweating shortly after following Harry into his workshop later that morning. A hearth crackles in the corner in addition to an empty cauldron that hovers over a low, smouldering flame. Wand materials from Harry’s cabin overflow into the tiny space, which is filled to the brim with fragments of wood, haphazard stacks of books, and myriad glass bottles filled with braided hairs from any and every magical creature suited for cores.
“And to be honest,” Potter continues, “I don’t really feel like arguing about it right now, either.”
Harry wrinkles his brow as he peers at Draco’s messy notes and absently picks at a scrape on his forearm. “No such luck. What if we use hawthorn for the wand?”
The worn leather booths and stools are oddly full, despite the early hour. A wall of chalkboards frames the bar, their seemingly handwritten contents shifting from chalky portraits of the customers in front of them to insults directed towards the staff. Drinks stir themselves as the bartender chats with a family in a corner booth. Busts of deer and bears and other animals are mounted on the walls, tracking the plates of food that float from the kitchen and snarling if someone gets too close.
Instead, Draco clamps his eyes shut, wrings his hands in his lap, and focuses on the conscious effort required to fill his lungs with the bitter cold air. He sees nothing but the teasing hint of light visible from the inside of his eyelids.
Draco exhales a cloud of breath. “Actually, it is. But why go to all the trouble and still let snow in?”
Draco tilts his head back further to locate the source of the sound behind him. He watches from upside down as Harry hums out of tune and pads across the kitchen floor, barefoot and hair sopping wet. His shirt is precariously unbuttoned, hanging loosely at his sides. Draco’s eyes linger on the exposed golden skin of his stomach, but Draco is quick to direct his gaze to Harry’s hands as he wipes the fog from his glasses on his shirt sleeve.
followed by another spark of panic, stronger this time, when he registers that he knows what Harry smells like to begin with.
potion”—he gestures towards the bottle of green liquid—“helps it absorb the magic from the wand core during the fusion. It almost makes it more… porous?”
Draco scoffs impatiently before arguing, “You used to be the victim of that sentiment. Not to mention your compulsion for righting wrongs and correcting injustices. Odd to hear those words come from you.”
“Yes!” Harry says, eyes bright. “But the timing is important, and is different depending on your materials. Unicorn hairs are picky bastards, and if they’re heated too hot or too long, they’ll just disintegrate. But thunderbird feathers”—he glances towards the golden feather that hovers over the dry heat of the cauldron—“they’re sturdy. Hard to mess those up. But they also need a little extra encouragement to fuse with the wood’s magic. So, it takes a lot longer.”
Potter holds out his wand and balances it in the palm of his gloved hand. “The first wand I ever made. I was unpracticed, impulsive, so angry at everything. When you remove a piece of wood, you’re taking more than the physical tree itself. You’re taking part of its core, what makes it magical. I overdid it, went too far. I didn’t have much control then. The wand works brilliantly, but the tree will probably never recover.” He sighs and pockets his wand. “Do you get it, though?”
“Merlin, no.” Potter actually laughs at the suggestion. He clears his throat before explaining, “This is the student I was telling you about. Rory, meet Draco Malfoy.”
“Potter and I are… not new acquaintances,” Draco says as he pushes off the counter. “Why am I telling you this anyway?”
Harry laughs, and his arm shakes with his uneven breaths. Draco adjusts his grip and narrows his gaze at Harry, a warning to keep still.
Draco chews his lip and hums, allotting the serious thought that a serious question such as the one he’s been asked warrants. “How do you define food? As in, a cooked meal? Or a single ingredient?”
Draco watches as a little girl in a puffy winter coat waddles in front of their seats. She can’t be more than two or three years old. A young couple follows closely behind her as she stumbles with a glowing sparkler in her outstretched arm. Her eyes light up in wonder as a glittering rabbit leaps from the tip, and she toddles off to chase it into the crowd.
“That’s none of your goddamn business, Malfoy.” The agitated current of Potter’s magic kisses Draco’s skin like a static shock. Draco leans in, nearly nose to nose, and feels the prickly heat roll off of Potter in waves.
“Some habits are too hard to break. Like irritating the shit out of blond gits.” Harry grins. “What’ve you got here?”
“Well, don’t let me delay your precise process, Potter. Although I have a hard time believing you’re capable of anything involving precision.”
It’s a casual touch and means nothing, especially since Harry doesn’t look like Harry. But the contact makes Draco’s heart leap nonetheless.
This chapter contains a very brief, but somewhat detailed, description of the healing of a minor human injury.
Well this was quite a journey. I so hope you enjoyed your trip to Volchii as much as Draco did. This story was such a joy to write. It's brought me to tears on many occasions, and I've become quite attached to these characters, both our canon favorites, as well as my small addition of original characters. I'm thrilled you made it all this way and sincerely hope you enjoyed it. Thanks so much for sticking with me til the end.
It’s not long before Harry wanders into the kitchen, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. A pair of black joggers sits low on his hips, and there’s a smudge on his glasses. Draco wordlessly motions for Harry to lean forward and plucks the frames from his face, skimming the bridge of Harry’s nose with his thumb. He’s careful as he uses his shirt to clean the lenses and holds them up to the light to assess his work. With a satisfied nod and slight smile, Draco hands over the frames. Harry returns the smile ten-fold, and Draco rolls his eyes, turning back to the hob to avoid Harry’s stare.
“Wanted more of a challenge. The Shield Charms were too easy,” Potter flaunts, but his crooked smile tames the arrogance. “But, really. I’ve got a network of Heating Charms on the drive by the house, the pavement, the roof. They keep it manageable. That way, the rest of the yard can fill up, and I don’t have to worry whether the Jeep can get out of the driveway.”
“Well, good morning, darlin’. You look like you’re in a mood.” A plump and cheery middle-aged bartender shuffles towards their booth. Crow’s feet rest at the corners of their warm brown eyes, and their salt and pepper hair is pulled back into a low braid at the base of their neck. A frayed and stained apron covers their green button-down shirt and blue jeans.
Potter continues on in silence, delving further into the woods. Draco plods behind him, the feeling of insecurity building in his gut. Just because he doesn’t know anything practical doesn’t mean he can’t learn. Perhaps he could have been better prepared. There are surely hundreds of books on the subject, but he’s only read a handful, too focused on the clinical work to do much more. As the silence stretches onward, he feels the need to justify himself.
“Here it is.” Harry gestures towards the hawthorn tree, its widespread, bare branches an inefficient umbrella above the forest floor. “Would you like to do the honors?”
Later, Potter narrows his eyes as Draco demonstrates the diagnostic charms on a small patch of spruce trees. He listens as Draco interprets their meaning and corrects Draco gently, without arrogance or malice. With each recitation and spell that is cast, Draco feels his muscles tighten with tension in anticipation of a fight that never comes.
They work ceaselessly for the next several hours, alternating who maintains the diagnostic and vitals charms while simultaneously cleansing the wounds, replacing lost blood, and treating the fever. Closing the wound with magic will only leave the infection untreated. So, they hover over the wolf and work quickly as she fades in and out of consciousness.
Despite the afternoon hour, the sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows behind the spindly trees. A gentle wind persuades the pines to unfold their sagging branches and release their snowy burdens to the earth. It would be much easier to Apparate to Potter’s home, but there’s a soothing quality to the lonesome walk, all muted footprints and nature hushed by a blanket of snow. Shielded in his myriad charms, Draco can clear his head without fear of the cold while delaying the inevitable a little while longer.
“Or what, Potter? It’s not an insult. You should be proud that you’re not running around, spouting about bravery, or courage, or right and wrong—"
“Merlin’s tits… What the fuck is going on here, Potter?” A wolf brushes past Draco’s leg, its tail feeling like a cool breeze as it grazes the sinewy flesh of Draco’s thigh.
The witch has a swipe of golden shimmer across the deep bronze skin of her cheekbones and pale pink flowers woven into her tiny, dark curls. They bounce as she moves to stand in front of Draco. Her glasses belong in the 1960s, and her grungy flannel has delicate floral patterns embroidered on the pockets, down the sleeves. A smattering of mismatched rings and dainty tattoos decorate her fingers.
“Harry! Over here!” Meg calls from her spot on a crumbling log. She pats the empty space next to her and Fee before chirping, “We saved you seats! And hot chocolate!”
“It’s ‘cause you know I’m right,” Harry says as he sets the bottle on his workbench, uncorks the stopper, and levitates a single, glimmering feather. With an outstretched hand, he lets it hover a moment before allowing it to sink to the cluttered work surface.
“It won’t bite,” Potter scoffs. He leans back to allow a waitress to direct a hovering set of paper placemats and napkin-wrapped silverware onto the table.
Draco sneers at a group of children that stare through the spokes on a porch railing before following Potter across the street.
Towards the docks, most of the town’s occupants are scattered in a wide half-circle, with Rory taking center stage. Some people stand, huddled together for warmth, while others sit on folding chairs or fallen logs. Puffs of steam curl from the Heating Charms that encase each little group. A handful of children chase each other with sparklers, laughing and screaming as glittering animals burst forth from the tips of the glowing sticks. The glimmer of a massive Shield Charm catches the light of the nearly full moon over the gulf.
last evening and, as a result, hasn’t yet eaten on this continent. Instead of confessing so, however, he shrugs and says, “I could eat, I suppose.”
“Are you kidding? Of course not.” Draco reaches for the hovering paper cup and relishes in the warmth that seeps through the fabric of his gloves. The prickle of a Heating Charm materializes over their seats, releasing a sudden plume of steam into the air. Draco glances at Harry with eyes narrowed, but Harry takes a conspicuously timed sip of hot chocolate, only raising his eyebrows in answer to the unasked question.
Draco is suddenly struck by the lack of daylight. Someone—the wandmaker, he supposes—was supposed to meet him at the airport just after his plane arrived. He catches sight of a clock hanging behind the desk, but stares at the time in disbelief.
“All right, now that’s settled. Let’s start here.” Potter pats the frosted bark of a pine tree that reaches tall towards the clear, watercolor sky. He removes his wand and nods at Draco to do the same. Draco hesitates before digging it from his pocket, temporarily distracted by the unfamiliar wand in Potter’s grip.
May clicks her tongue against her crooked teeth. “We all have our own herds of goats, Draco, myself included.” Her callused palm is rough as she pats Draco’s cheek before resuming her position on the stool, guarding the wolf. Draco turns to Harry for an explanation of May’s herd of goats, but Harry only shrugs, dismissing it as a mysterious May-ism.
Harry’s eyes are playful as he tosses his coat on the hook at the door and walks towards a cabinet. Though the shelves are littered with books, bottles, and stray sheets of parchment, Harry reaches for a corked, crimson bottle without ponderance or delay.
It’s a strange feeling, aimlessly following Potter into the wilderness. It stirs memories of a haunting figure and a dying unicorn in the Forbidden Forest, putting Draco’s nerves on edge.
“I imagine. Sit still; this will sting a little.” Draco chews on his lip as he draws his wand, grateful for his regular practice at May’s clinic. “Have you ever been injured on your tail?”
An eye roll precedes Potter’s answer. “They give the tires better traction in the snow, so we don’t slide down a mountain and die.”
“Don’t lose your lunch. We’re almost there,” the raspy, tobacco-tortured voice crackles through the contraption over Draco’s ears. He nods, eyes still sealed shut, and ignores the sound of an exasperated sigh.
Draco does not subscribe to the idea of a deity, but he imagines if there is one, they would be laughing at him about now. He’s certain Pansy would be, which is probably worse.
“So’s Quidditch. Now, are you hungry or not?” Potter calls over his shoulder as he walks back into the kitchen. Draco peels his eyes from the screen to follow him and takes a tentative seat at the table.
Draco fidgets with the frayed edges of a quilt before answering, “No, I don’t think I would call it sleeping.”
“Are they dangerous?” Slowly, the rest of the pack starts to trail off behind the leader. A faint glow lights their path until they disappear into the dense underbrush. Potter recasts his
“No, no… No. I’m hallucinating. I’m delusional. This is not real,” Harry Potter finally mumbles to himself. Draco’s eyes widen as Potter turns to tap his forehead against the car’s back windshield. “He’s not here. I’m imagining things.”
The complex charms flow easily from the tip of Draco’s wand, resulting in a convoluted, violent crimson pattern that swirls about the base of the tree. Draco wrinkles his brow in concern, although he hasn’t a clue what it means.
“Um, yes, I am. Well, I’m a Junior Healer, but yes…” Draco internally chastises himself for stumbling over his words like a drunken troll. “Apologies, I was told you were American.”
Draco met his mentor, Healer Nordell, in his third year of school. She introduced him to the new and blossoming world of wizarding medical theory: research-based practice, minimal patient interaction, and endless mysteries to solve. He was hooked.
“I’ll keep an eye on her,” Harry promises. Draco looks suspiciously at Harry, hoping to convey an unspoken question. There’s a look in Harry’s eyes that says he understands, but he ignores it, choosing instead to shake the droplets of melted snow from his hair. The cold spray lands on Draco’s cheeks and ripples the surface of his drink.
An uncomfortable silence lingers as Potter stands by the door. Despite his vulnerable position in the chair, Draco stiffens his spine and settles a determined gaze on Potter, allowing the unease to mellow.
In the welcoming warmth of Potter’s cabin, they kick their dripping boots off at the door and shed their extra layers. Potter drops his coat and scarf on the floor and summons a fire to the hearth while Draco hangs his jacket on the hooks behind the door. Feeling a bit like an intruder, Draco stands awkwardly in the living room as Potter turns on the television and ambles into the kitchen.
Harry Potter is standing in front of him, halfway around the world, wearing an ungodly checkered coat and mumbling about wheel chains. The ridiculousness of it all almost makes Draco laugh, but his voice fails him, an immobile lump at the base of his throat.
Every lesson was a puzzle, and every answer led to another question. How does a patient’s magical core impact the efficacy of a Blood-Replenishing Potion? Does deep magical damage heal over time, or will it forever impact a patient’s magical energy and affect future treatment? How might different properties of a wand affect the complex Healing spells he used every day as a Junior Healer?
“All right,” Harry acquiesces. There’s a mischievous tilt to his grin. “We’ll try. But riddle me this, Draco: how are you going to get the hair from a pack of ghost wolves?”
Draco reminds himself, but immediately regrets it when his mind supplies him with an onslaught of unwelcome memories. He shakes his head to rid his mind of the violent images and turns away to start back down the gravel path, away from the house. It only takes a few steps before he stops again, humiliated that something this trivial would make him feel so lost. He sags further under the weight on his shoulders.
“Nothing… I’ve done absolutely nothing. Nothing devious. Nothing exciting. Nothing remotely interesting,” Draco says as realization settles over him. “I think I’m the most boring person I know.”
“I’m beginning to understand why you never come back home,” Draco whispers, still working to slow his breaths.
“Er… I’m not really sure,” Harry mutters, scratching at his head while he watches Draco examine his wound. “Adrenaline, you know? It’s always weird to get hurt in another body. Like… I have to play a game of figuring out where it ends up later.”
“Hello, Harry and Draco! Rory got some fireworks from Juneau today. Come see! We’ve got hot chocolate.”
“Not enough time.” Harry shifts to lean on the armrest and look at Draco. “If we’d thought about it the first day you got here, we still wouldn’t have enough time. Now, it’s March, and we give up minutes of darkness every day. We can’t get it done before the sun comes up and the wolves lose their form.”
Leave it to Potter to have the means to escape and never look back, without worry for his reputation or ability to survive. Leave it to Potter to fuck off to the middle of nowhere with no consequence or criticism.
Draco nudges a bit of snow with his foot, uncovering the gravel and dirt underneath. “No, probably not.”
“Bear trap, damn hunters. She’s infected, probably septic already. Lost a lot of blood…” She pauses for a moment to observe the shifting patterns of her charms. “Severed the femoral artery. Too much blood to be anything else. We have to work fast.”
“Yeah,” Harry sighs. “So, it took a while to figure this out. And I’m still not good at following the book. Sometimes that works out, and sometimes it means I’m starting over the next morning, or tossing a wand with a lot of potential in the bin.” He shrugs, pushing off the workbench. “It evens out. Anyway, starting this early means I have time to mess up without losing the whole day. But you’re good at this stuff; maybe it’ll go faster once you get the hang of it.”
four blankets. The wool is rough under his fingertips but warm. The lights are out, but the brightness of the nearly full moon casts a milky glow across the room. It highlights his bag on the desk, his wand on the bedside table. An icy breeze blows through the wide-open window; he must have left it open last night when he couldn’t sleep.
“Yeah, I didn’t think so. So excuse me for not throwing a welcome mat at your feet. Or don’t. I don’t really fucking care.”
“Eloquent as ever, Potter, but I’m afraid you’ll need to spell it out for me. Don’t order the omelet? Don’t pet the moose? Don’t breathe? The interpretations are truly endless at the moment,” Draco retorts. Excited anticipation flutters in his chest as he watches Potter’s ears turn red and a deep wrinkle form between his brows.
Potter glances over and loosens the scarf around his face to reveal the days-old stubble on his cheeks. He shrugs and turns a knob that protrudes from the wheel, setting long, black blades to wipe back-and-forth across the windshield. “I like to drive,” he says simply.
to do so. If it doesn’t have magical properties, it won’t work at all. If its magical properties are drained or too weak, for whatever reason, it’ll work, but you’ll have a pretty shit wand in the end. Make sense?”
“Let me finish; I’m just getting started. I know you were too afraid to look me in the face when you returned my wand.” The heated glow of Potter’s cheeks and clench of his fists is all the incentive Draco needs to press on. “I know you dropped out of Auror training and all about how you mucked it up with the Weasley girl before you fucked off to the edge of the world.” Draco holds firm, despite Ginny never really talking about Potter since she started dating Pansy several years back. In fact, Draco had no idea she’d visited him over Christmas.
It isn’t as though Potter doesn’t have good reason to hate him, but whenever Draco had imagined a reunion with the Boy Who Lived, it was always more of a reserved discussion, an uncomfortable rehashing of the past culminating in an amicable shaking of hands. He’d never anticipated the anger that still rolled off Potter in waves after so many years.
“Thanks. That’s pretty handy; I may need to keep you around.” Harry lingers at Draco’s side for a moment, resting his hand on the kitchen table. His brow knits in concentration before he reaches forward and rubs his thumb across Draco’s cheek. The air in Draco’s lungs abandons him, and a rush of blood fills his ears. “You’ve a bit of ink.” Harry attempts a chuckle, but a seriousness in his eyes betrays his easy demeanor. “Er, well, I think I’ve made it worse.”
With feet firmly on the ground, Draco runs a futile hand through his mussed hair. In lieu of the talking earmuffs required on the plane, he places his knit hat low to shield his ears from the chill. It turns out, the Seldovia Airport is not much of an airport at all, at least compared to the only other airport Draco has seen. In all reality, it is a wide gravel path, shadowed by towering pines and a small stream of water from the gulf.
“Only one way to find out. Here”—Harry unbuttons his plaid overshirt and offers it to Draco—“she’s not one to exaggerate. And Merlin knows you didn’t bring clothes that you’re willing to toss in the bin.”
It’s messy and cluttered and falls perfectly in line with his memory of Harry Potter, despite the unfamiliarity.
“So tell us, Father. What’s happened for the Dark Lord to announce his return so soon?” said Draco, reclining in his seat. “I saw the news about Longbottom, but I assumed it was unlikely the second regeneration attempt had more success than the first.”
“And what’s down must come up, like the rising of the sun,” said Angelica, with a hint of chastisement. “Where we fall on the wheel isn’t up to us. Maybe it’s luck, or maybe it’s fate, but we know we’ll always come round again. Where are you falling presently?”
How long, Draco wondered, had Regulus been forced to sleep under that motto after he had stopped believing it?
“Don’t be overeager, Draco. It is unseemly,” said Lucius over his wine glass. “The book may yet pass to you someday when you are deemed ready. Until then, hold your tongue. One does not wish to seem desperate.”
Draco didn’t know what to say. He looked into his friend’s face, and he knew there was no point in denying it. He bent down to embrace her, tucking his nose into the crook of her neck, and breathed in her flowery smell, which had always been his favourite part of having a girlfriend.
Snape, who for so long Draco had believed to be a stalwart of the brethren, now seemed like a man adrift. With Dumbledore’s trust and what Cedric revealed about Snape’s help in his final days, could it be that his Head of House was on a different side than he let on?
The group hesitated, looking at Hermione who was still gazing at the note, lost in thought. Harry hoped she wasn’t feeling the urge to turn on her heel and run straight to McGonagall.
McGonagall said nothing, but Draco sped up, steering Harry more quickly to the door as the Aurors were exiting. Harry had a feeling Draco knew what was coming next as well as he did.
There was a tremendous crash from the other side of the room and all four jumped, spinning round to see Kreacher holding a tea tray askew, surrounded by a china teapot and four cups and saucers shattered to pieces on the ground. The house-elf’s mouth hung open, trembling.
“No reason,” said Draco, straightening up and repositioning his wand for another round. “You seem to have better control over your memories of Charlotte. Show me another one?”
Harry frowned reflexively, and he looked away. “Doesn’t seem very sporting to torture a helpless woman. That is what you were doing, isn’t it?”
“That would be consistent with Slytherin’s locket, I suppose,” said Harry. “If Voldemort chose an object from each of the four houses, that’s half our hunting done!”
“Maybe we really should get McGonagall involved,” ventured Hermione. “We have no way of knowing what this thing is.”
“No, you’re right,” said Draco with an agitated sigh. He didn’t want to lash out at Pansy with his own issues. “I just don’t think we ever would have seen eye to eye, you know? And I do feel for him. The
“No,” said Harry. “I think you’re trying to, but even if you’ve done terrible things, I know that’s not who you are. If you want me to yell and scream at you for all the stupid shit you’ve done, I will, but if you want me to hate you, I can’t. Or do you think you haven’t changed me as well?”
Harry sighed, rubbing at his eyes under his glasses. “There is no alternative. We have to get the diary in order to even have a chance at facing Voldemort. Limiting our search to the two most likely places that it could be hidden is the smartest option, especially while we have the element of surprise on our side.”
“… He was so secretive at first when he was in hospital, but she got special access to cover the story as an exclusive.” Gemma’s incessant talking hit his eardrums again, and he put a hand to his forehead in exasperation. “She said he was just the sweetest, like a little puppy. And I mean, I knew who he was, of course, but I never thought he was particularly fit. But then when she introduced me to him at the gala and I saw those green eyes—”
Harry had shaken Al off, thinking he’d finally lost it to old age. Still, the urgency in his voice and the deep concern in his eyes had Harry worried. In a fleeting moment, as Harry turned his back on the old man, stalking his way back to Privet Drive, he found himself suddenly face to face with the old man once again.
“You just love being right,” joked Cedric. “The magic on this certainly feels strong enough to be a Horcrux. I’d say we’re damn lucky that Malfoy pays attention to the contents of his vaults.”
“I take it this is a good sign,” said Draco. Picturing an altogether different partnership of opposing forces.
“You’re right,” said Harry, shaking his head to clear the thought. The task at hand was too important. “How come you haven’t destroyed this one yet? Seems like a hell of a thing to carry around.”
“Right you are,” said Tonks with a big sniff. “She’d be proud to hear you say it. She’s just as much your mum as she is mine, after all.”
Harry felt his face grow hot with embarrassment, remembering his previous outburst. “About last time – I think I was just caught off guard,” he said, taking a seat opposite. “It won’t happen again, now that I know what to expect.”
As she waited, she watched the comings and goings of Privet Drive, which were for the most part without note. The local residents went about their day, toddling off to work in their rumbling cars or blaring televisions while they vacuumed their carpets. The Muggle lifestyle was quite noisy really, and that was saying something for a woman who lived at a boarding school.
Darco could not remember being so relaxed as he was now. The sun was shining on the emerald lawns of the Manor. Dappled patches of light shone through the vines of wisteria on the gazebo overhead, and Angelica had been back in the US for about a week. He’d finally caught Pansy up on the events of the Aparecium night — as much as he could share at any rate.
“Yes! Excellent! Realism is critical when one is creating one’s masterwork. Much obliged good sir, much obliged,” said the bard, pulling a feather out of his hat and jotting notes down on a piece of parchment. “Keep your ears open, lad! Music is everywhere.”
“Where’s the fun in that?” called Malfoy, deflecting the splash of blue with ease, and sending three short red blasts down the hall in response.
“Prisoners?” The thought of Harry’s Muggle girlfriend flashed to mind. As unlikely as it seemed, If Draco could come back to Hogwarts with news of her, Harry would be elated.
A few of the younger students looked nervous at this, but a witch with a short black bob towards the back of the room called out, “If it’s a matter of fighting to win, don’t worry about us.” Harry spotted her and recognised her as Pansy, the girl Draco had been dating at the start of the year. “Professor Lockhart started us on duelling in second year and we’ve been competing at it ever since. Anyone on my duelling squad could knock any wizard flat in a minute or less, Death Eater or no.”
“But I couldn’t find their nest. It was hidden somehow,” continued Luna, as though Hermione hadn’t spoken. “It was really the snake that led me there.”
“In my experience, everyone is motivated by their own interests at the end of the day,” said Draco. What was Granger, after all, some kind of altruist?
“You know when I get that pain in my scar?” started Harry slowly. The group was already far more trusting than he deserved. He only hoped the revelation of his waking dreams wouldn’t put them over the edge, but if they were going to help him on this mad quest they deserved his honesty. “As long as I can remember, I’ve had strange flashes of another life. Sometimes when I’m dreaming, but more recently when I’m awake, and always after I get a pain in my scar. Lately I’m more and more certain that it’s real – that I’m seeing through Voldemort’s eyes.”
They decided it was best to test out everyone’s vision and see if they could fill in the blanks; identifying the other Horcruxes, whether a group of rebel fighters existed, and if they were somehow using time magic to fight.
called Harry, catching the shorter man off guard and sending his wand flying. Yaxley’s head snapped in their direction, his eyes ice cold. Harry shoved Charlotte away just in time to dodge a nonverbal jet of red light that went streaking past his head.
Draco could almost see the pieces falling as Mr DuPont laid them out. He knew what was coming next, and it felt like a rock in his stomach.
“Idiots. As I’m always saying, I’d make a better Death Eater than half the brethren,” said Draco, realising that he finally held more cards than his father did. “Seems like the only thing to do now is go track him down.”
“Still, we better hurry. I think we should go down the east corridor stairwell.” Hermione turned right down the corridor. “It’s usually empty on the days there’s no Defence seminar.”
If one paid attention, they could see the subtle strings of magic intertwining, dancing in myrth as the red string between their Souls glowed, unseen by the mortal eye.
Harry knew Draco wouldn't let him go. His Soulmate was going into his first... Well, rut, so to say.
Kissing the raven again, he started undoing their pants, pulling Severus's leg up and taking off his shoes, pulling his pants down and still holding him down with his strength, soon finding themselves naked, the raven pinned down by the ginger.
Ron came in the room and stared at his brother in disbelief. "Bloody hell, you look like you're going on a date!"
"George Weasley. Detention!" He said and walked away. George was impressed at his teacher's ability to tell him from Fred immediately. As he stood up, his blue eyes sparkling with mischief, but also something else, and went into his dorm with a slight smile.
"Snape?" Hermione asked knowingly. She figured out about George's... Way of seeing the teacher quite long ago.
Pulling his fingers out, and threatening to put his cock in, he whispered sweetly: "Don't worry, my love. You'll enjoy yourself, I promise."
He felt him freeze. George started kissing more hungrily, grabbing a hold of Severus's wrists. When he finally broke the kiss, he saw his crush gaping at him, too shocked to do anything but open his mouth in surprise.
"Oh, Harry's a Shadow Walker," George answered, remembering his shock when Harry told his friends. Back then, he didn't know he was a Spellbreaker.
George, ignoring his yelling completely, started stroking in a way that he knew would make the supposedly angry professor go crazy.
George quickly prepared his spell in front of his potions professor's office. He waited. He needed to make his timing perfect. Finally, he heard the footsteps. He started casting, waiting for a second still... And released the magic. Flying fireworks shot through the hall as professor Snape came into view.
"I know you're here," he called out, trying to hear a reaction, waiting for his mate to make a mistake.
This time, featuring OP Severus that could actually throw like 10 trolls with the wave if his finger, and a George who knows that and wouldn't actually force our favourite potions teacher if he actually didn't want it.
Which he wasn't enjoying at all. He was defending himself with all his might, yes. His attempts absolutely weren't half-assed at best...
That day, professor Snape seemed very jumpy. If you as much as stood behind him, he would deduct points, even from Slytherin. Draco, being a Part-Veela, felt a bond gotten stronger around him.
Seeming to start getting frustrated, the ginger kissed more furiously, trying to initiate a reaction. Severus tried to push him away again, then to kick his groin, for which he earned himself a very mad student slamming him on a table. The ginger finally broke the kiss, looking at him with a wicked smile.
Perhaps because he had been caught the last time and knew that George knew he wasn't truly resisting anyway.
"I don't think so," George exclaimed, a sly smile playing on his lips. He let go of his teacher's wrist and came closer, slowly making him back away.
As soon as he saw the deliquent, Severus paled and got up, as far away from said ginger as he could. "Weasley! You got detention again?! F- fifty points from Gryffindor!"
Hermione, being the genius she was, gave him another knowing look while Ron was trying to beat Draco in chess and Harry found himself unable to spell his hair into submission yet again.
Severus was so startled by his student's unexpected action that the only thing he managed to do was stare at him in shock. Then he was kissed again, the boy's tongue sliding into his mouth. He couldn't comprehend what was happening, first he was driven into the wall by this deliquent and now...
"So you could have easily thrown me off if you wanted to! As if I would actually force you if you really didn't want to!"
Draco's silvery eyes, glowing in the darkness, searched for his mate. This was the night he would make Harry truly his and his only.
He bit Harry's neck, the gesture being one of the dominants/equals of the bond claiming their mate, spread his poison into Harry's blood, the poison marking Harry as his and his only, would hurt anyone else who would try to claim HIS mate, though not doing anything to Harry or himself.
I deleted one sex scene but this chapter is the fluffy ending anyway, no need to force smut down our throats in every chapter!
"You are still going? I literally saw you throw a group of trolls 50 meters away with the flick of your finger."
George, who had grown tall, even an inch or two taller than the 6 feet tall Snape, went to have a shower in the meanwhile.
George just set the prank as he heard footsteps. Proffesor McGonagall was coming! He was planning to get caught, as his potion professor was on the detention duty that week, the new system playing in his favor.
As he caught a whiff of Harry's smell, Draco spread his white, angelic wings to their full size, which was, needless to say, impressive.
Proving him correct, Severus didn't even bother with a wand and sent a wandless stinging hex at him with the slightest wave of a pale finger.
When he told his Soulmate, Hermione and the Weasley (they discovered Hermione actually had some Black and even Malfoy blood in her, her grandfather being a Squib, so he stopped calling her mudblood,) Hermione got that surprised and then knowing look in her eyes, which got Draco VERY curious.
George turned him around and started teasing his butthole, quickly casting a lubrication and stretching charm and putting in a finger. "Hey! W- what... Stop it! Ngh!" Severus tried to will himself to stop the teen, but couldn't bring himself to move an inch.
"Bloody hell, what is this, the ultimate Slytherin and Gryffindor integration?! Why do we all have Slytherin soulmates?!" Ron exclaimed when Blaise told him.
He was a great friend and a wonderful young man, but at this point, it had to be some sort of a defence mechanism.
“No… that’s impossible.” Draco squirmed under his teacher’s cold stare. “He would never turn on my parents. They were loyal.”
“No, he’s here,” said Hermione. Draco came to a complete stop and whirled around on her, expecting her regular snarky expression but instead seeing deep worry in her brown eyes. “But he’s hurt.”
Voldemort’s thin lip twitched. “As I say, we’ll be unstoppable. Mere mortals will naturally revere us as gods, it’s only ours for the taking.”
After a brief discussion on whether Floo powder had an expiration date, Draco was the first to step into the flames which shot up around him and he was gone. Luna stayed behind to keep an eye on the fire so they could get back, and Harry, glamoured as he had been on his first wand fitting, shoved his invisibility cloak into his pocket and followed suit.
“She’s full of surprises,” managed Draco, casting a loving yet chaste expression in her direction. “Have you played this course before, Mr DuPont?” Draco knew for a fact he hadn’t, but he needed to get some footing in the conversion if he was going to make a good impression.
“That’s right. There are a number of spells on this relic. I am looking to assess the nature of the innate magical properties as well as the curse protecting it,” said Draco, trying to sound nonchalant. Borgin had meanwhile turned the dials on his strange glasses again and was peering at the black fabric with one telescoping lens. He paused to glance back at Draco. “And its value, of course.”
By the time Draco made it up the stairs, he felt like he had been through one of the longest days of his life. And yet, he could not fall asleep in the master bedroom. Thoughts of Horcruxes and RAB and lightning bolt shaped scars danced around in his head until he couldn’t take it anymore.
“What? Of course not,” said Draco, getting his bearings and giving their shared cauldron a stir. Luckily he could brew a draught of Dreamless Sleep with his eyes closed. Snape was slowly making his rounds to check, and he couldn’t afford to stay after class either – he had a session with Harry where he was determined to delve into deeper memories.
To his annoyance, Potter had a similarly strong first shot, although it went high and veered slightly towards the left in the direction of the wind. So much for being a novice. As Draco walked up to the box for his turn, he was concentrating as hard as possible on making a better shot than Potter. He set his ball up on the self-teeing grass, squared off his shoulders, and knocked the ball hard. It went high and left, landing close to Potter’s ball.
“At least tell me whether it’s tipped your decision one way or another on this alliance with the DuPonts?”
“No more than usual,” said Hermione, shoving her timetables into her bag. “I’m allowed to see my Head of House after all.”
“And I suspect the production cost is substantially cheaper. You can probably machine produce chemicals, whereas you need an alchemist to individually manage any potions production. Then there’s the question of quality control.”
Looking down, there was a glint of silver underneath the pile of rags that Fawkes had given him. He reached down and grasped the cool metal, drawing it out from the debris. He was surprised how heavy it was – this certainly hadn’t been in the bundle before.
As the rest were laughing and sloshing around too-full glasses of champagne, Draco chanced a glance back at Harry, who was watching the group with a somewhat blank expression. As Draco looked across, he cracked a grin and raised his glass.
“Alright. Tell me what you think you know,” he said in his most honest voice. “And I’ll tell you everything I can.”
Kreacher fiddled with the heavy locket around his neck. “Master is saying that Harry Potter is Kreacher’s master from now on.”
“Well, his family are known to trade in that sort of thing,” said Hermione, levitating the ring into a cloth napkin that had come with breakfast. “The Malfoys have been tied to the dark arts in the past, though their records have all been expunged obviously.”
“So he should,” said Draco, taking his Prefect tone. “And you ought not to be lingering in the halls between classes.”
“Yes, thank you Garrick, it continues to work just fine,” said McGonagall, taking the wand back with a bit of force and returning it to a robe pocket. “Ah, here is the student I was telling you about.”
Draco’s eyes flicked around the room before settling on Harry. “I’ve heard the word before, from my mother,” he began, quiet yet composed. “It’s a type of magic that fractures the very core of a person, and only done at significant cost.”
Draco hesitated slightly. This was something he hadn’t thought about. If the Fidelius Charm was strong enough, he might not be able to get the information out. The only thing protecting him at the moment was that the damn charm kept anyone else from being in his enviable position.
“My father is a smart man. He inherited the company from his father, and he did exceptionally well with it. He placed bets in the right places. He took calculated risks, and they’ve paid off. But he lacks vision.” Angelica’s expression sobered. “And like you, and so many men, he was quick to doubt me. He doubted I could lead DuPont Industries. Despite my education and my inclination to take over the family business, he was reluctant to put me in a position of power. So I had to find other ways to influence him.”
“It’s a classic Slytherin trait,” said Malfoy, smirking. “I’d be happy to teach you. Once you master Occlumency.”
“Er, this is my living room?” He winced as his voice trailed upwards; somehow the presence of his old professor made him still feel eleven years old.
The Potions professor did not look up, he merely kept his gaze fixated on the desk. Only by the time Draco approached, he realised there was nothing there.
“Step one is to get the locket,” said Harry, pointing to the map of the school grounds in front of Cedric. “Ced and Hermione will Apparate to the edge of Hogsmeade and walk to the castle, using Cedric’s Auror credentials to get past any security,”
“Right,” said Harry, turning to pace down the room. “So where do people go when they have cursed objects? There’s got to be somewhere that can perform an analysis on this.”
Draco once again found himself in the cupboard under the stairs. He scanned the room, determining which token he wanted to use that could link him back to the earliest memories they had encountered so far. He reached for the seashell, but Harry’s eyes darted into the far corner of the space, where the stairs met the floor.
Harry felt a smile tug at the corners of his mouth at this very Hermione-like form of apology. So Cedric was still hard at work on the case, and Hermione was still looking into Horcruxes. That only left one other.
If his father suspected him, that was one thing, but if the Dark Lord did, he could rip Draco’s mind to shreds and still not find anything. But his father hadn’t alluded to anything yet. Maybe his involvement had been obscured. He’d play the gambit just a bit farther and see.
She held the cup out to Cedric, who looked around at the group as he accepted it with two hands. The others waited apprehensively.
Pansy glanced out over the foyer, absently checking the pins in her updo and attempting to stifle a smile as her cheeks flushed. “Whatever do you mean?” she asked playfully.
“I know what you mean,” said Luna, attempting to puff up her parchment ball. “If only you could see more of the castle. I just know you would love it.”
Now that he was paying attention, Draco’s typically immaculate appearance was long gone, and in its place was a rumpled silk pajama set, a tuft of blond hair sticking straight up, and the faint line of a pillow crease on his cheek. Harry felt a little like he’d inhaled a helium balloon.
To think Dumbledore had been visiting Harry in Muggle England practically every week for the last ten years was unthinkable. The fact Harry had managed to effectively Occlude this from him was beyond that. He’d been so focused on driving Harry to his one memory of the Dark Lord that he hadn’t bothered to dig into the other sacred pockets of thought.
“Yeah actually,” said Harry apprehensively, not looking up from where his fingers skimmed across the chapter. “The first time we tried this, when it was like watching my life in rewind, I think I saw a memory… of the night my parents died. Do you think we could find it again?”
“But we’ve gotten more than that,” said Harry, the light from the fire catching in his glasses as he looked around at the group. “In every other world that could have been, one thing was consistent: If Voldemort wins, the whole world will be taken over, magical and Muggle alike. And I, for one, will not let that happen.”
“And the leaders they wanted to see in power,” said Harry, choosing his words just as carefully. “Who were they?”
They did not speak as Minerva and Albus prepared the complex spellwork, nor after the charm was cast. Hagrid hung about, shifting from one foot to another and casting worried looks back at the bundle of blankets. When they had finished their pact, they parted ways, Hagrid taking to the skies with a roar of the motorcycle and Dumbledore restoring the lights of the street lamps before Apparating away with a crack.
“Whatever you say, darling,” said Draco, giving her hand a pat. “I’m sure you’ll forget about this before too long. You know Angelica wants to have the most extravagant wedding imaginable and I’ll definitely need your help to plan the thing. I can’t imagine you’ll spare a thought for Potter when you’re decked out in the finest robes money can buy.”
Sitting back and trying to catch his breath for a moment, he found his face was suddenly wet with hot tears. He rubbed at them with the sleeve of his jumper, feeling a twinge of pain, and pushed his sleeves up to see his wrists turning black and blue in the shape of massive fingerprints.
She turned the book to the other two, showing a picture of a golden chalice engraved with the image of a badger. Draco’s hand tensed reflexively on his teacup – he recognised it immediately.
“He always was a strange one,” said Draco, pretending to look back at the board for his next move, but struggling with an uncalled for wave of guilt. “Sometimes people keep secrets for good reasons.”
“So pleased to meet you, Draco,” he said, shaking his hand warmly. “We have met once or twice before when you were quite small, though I wouldn’t expect you to remember.”
She laughed, and he gave her a kiss on the cheek, took a swig of his whiskey on the table and went out into the club to find Harry.
“I can’t imagine they’d be able to keep that from him even if they wanted to. Remember, Lily was an exceptionally powerful witch at a young age. But when the time comes, Harry will get his invitation to a magical education just like everyone else. It is their choice as his guardians what they want to disclose to him and when.”
In a blink, the contemplative expression was gone, replaced by a familiar know-it-all smirk that Harry hadn’t been able to get out of his mind since the first day he walked into the Room of Requirement. Back then he had taken it to be a sign of arrogance, but today he saw it for what it was – a brave cover for a very dark turmoil that Draco was battling within himself.
“The worst part is that the rumours of the Dark Lord are increasing, fuelled by horror stories from the
“See there, in the trees?” she asked, pointing with a small hand as she held her wand aloft. Harry squinted, but through the dark brambles it was hard to discern anything. “Hold out the roast.”
Draco had literally no idea what Tonks could be talking about or whether she was even sane. The uncivilised way she was shovelling down the last of her toast was making it seem unlikely. Still, the diadem must have sent him to this timeline for a reason.
“He’s smart,” said Hermione reluctantly. “But he’s the poster child for Slytherin house, so don’t trust him with your back turned. He’s not usually one to spend his time on something he’s not personally benefiting from.”
“If we’re going to do this, we’ll need to stay in touch,” she said. “I think I can whip something up using a Protean Charm. You know, in case we all need to gather for anything.”
“I know what you are thinking,” said Snape, gliding around from behind the desk, closing in on Draco. “I know the feeling of being the one with the knowledge that will undo your enemies. And I know the feeling of power that comes with giving it to the Dark Lord, but heed my words: The Dark Lord is unpredictable.”
“Here’s an idea,” said Draco, rubbing his temples after yet another Legilimency session started hitting the same roadblocks. “Why don’t I show you one of my earliest memories?”
Harry reluctantly handed over the holly wand. Much good it was doing him lately anyway, and Hermione brushed past him out the door.
At the moment, Professor Lockhart was swanning about in lilac robes, reading passages from his book,
as they stepped over thick roots and a carpet of fallen leaves. Entering a clearing, Luna gasped quietly and beckoned Harry over.
“So just think of the memory I want to access, any memory at all,” said Harry, thinking of the green flash.
“Who’s that?” interrupted Charlotte as they turned onto the open-air platform. Harry followed her line of sight down to the flickering dark end of the track, which was empty but for two hulking figures in black robes.
“Harry, he’s weak!” Charlotte screamed, lunging forward to grab onto Voldemort’s robes and staring intently into his eyes. “He’s dying, Harry, he dies a little more every time.”
In the wake of the battle, Cedric had left the Auror force. He was a vocal advocate of the actions of Dumbledore’s Army, and had led the charge in speaking to the Wizengamot on Voldemort’s crimes. He had been so influential, in fact, that the council appointed him to the Muggle Liaison Office, to smooth over the relationship between the two Ministers and help to build precautions to keep the magical world from spilling over if another incident should arise.
Draco left his memory abruptly, and Harry too was yanked back to the present, chilled and covered with a cold sweat. He turned towards the hazy shape of Draco as his eyes refocused on the room in the castle.
“Of course,” she said, gesturing to her end table where a large wrought iron key to the Gringotts vaults lay in a drawer, folded in a handkerchief. “And I must tell you – the Dark Lord is planning the attack on Azkaban before spring. If he frees Bellatrix, there will be no stopping him, so you must move quickly.”
As they toppled over backwards onto the crimson bedspread, finding himself looking up at the pictures of women in bikinis on the ceiling and with Harry Potter, the saviour of the wizarding world kneeling over him, he really did have to laugh.
He was too awestruck to say anything, but Draco of this memory warmed at the sound of his mothers voice as he stared curiously at the small creature.
“All I want,” said Harry, holding his ground. “Is for you to know that you can talk to me about this sort of thing. And that you don’t have to believe today what you believed yesterday. Changing your mind when new evidence is presented to you isn’t weakness, it’s logical.”
How in Merlin’s name was this girl, of all people, able to break Dumbledore’s Fidelius Charm, wondered Draco. He’d been kicking himself for days that he still wasn’t any closer to controlling the information about Harry, while this sixth-year had somehow wandered into him on a whim and a daydream.
He was being ridiculous. Sure he had feelings for Malfoy – who wouldn’t? He was beautiful, powerful, brilliant. That he was a boy had been a flicker of a question in Harry’s mind that he bypassed with ease the first time Draco looked at him after a Legilimency session and understood him completely.
Draco had learned early on in Slytherin house that rule number one of betrayal was having a contingency plan. Luckily for him, he'd maintained his facade of friendship throughout his attempt to turn Potter over to the Death Eaters, and from what he could tell, Potter wasn’t the wiser for his involvement.
“I’ll tell you where it is, but I need your help. I think I’m meant to find out what other Horcruxes we’ve discovered and how to destroy them. Otherwise we might not be able to defeat Vol—”
He glanced up through sweat-drenched hair to lock eyes with Voldemort, who was positively brimming with glee.
“Oh, Harry!” said Hermione, her head snapping in his direction as the others crowded around his bed. She rushed the few steps to loom over him where she smacked him hard on the arm, her look of concern quickly flickering to a scowl. “What the hell were you thinking, leaving here like that? You could have got yourself killed!”
“My understanding of the old family issues was that they were about political alliances,” said Draco tentatively. “Specifically, my family’s stance on magical and non-magical relations.”
“Why won’t anybody say his name?” demanded Harry, looking at the others. “Will somebody please just tell me about Voldemort!”
All this time that he’d kept the Fidelius, Dumbledore had been looking after Harry. But why? If he cared enough to keep tabs on him, surely it was wiser to protect him with magic than to leave him up to his own devices in the Muggle world.
At last he came to a memory they both already knew. A ceremony. Draco of the memory was brimming with pride as he was ushered into the drawing room at Wisteria Hall, along with a dozen other children of Death Eater parents. It was almost his 17th birthday, he would be of age soon, and there was nothing more he wanted in the world than to prove his worth to the brethren.
“Missing my friends more like,” said Harry, dropping his arm. “Do I really have to keep practising with the quill?”
Draco laughed. “You’re absolutely right, Professor. It’s just hard for me to believe you when you never practice what you preach.”
Of course, the sooner the game ended, the sooner he’d have to face his father. And he wasn’t confident that he’d be able to control the conversation, especially if the Fidelius hadn’t been effectively broken.
“You should stay,” said Hermione, without looking up from the diagnostic spells she was casting over Harry. “We’re better at making sense of these things when we’re all together.”
“I too conveyed a secret that I thought would please the Dark Lord. To bolster his ascent to power, and raise me up in his esteem. It was only later I realised that it spelled the end for the one person I was desperate to protect.” Snape was practically shaking with the effort of conveying this message. Draco gulped at a lump in his throat, wondering what Snape could have done, and trying to suppress the image of Harry that was quickly rising to the surface of his mind. “Learn from my sins, Draco. Or suffer the same fate.”
Harry stumbled back instinctively, shoving Draco away and locking eyes with him, confusion etched across his face. Draco felt a moment of panic, like the floor had been ripped out from under him, when suddenly Harry was back in his arms. Their lips crashed together and Harry wrapped a firm hand around the back of his neck, drawing him close.
“At first I chalked it up to stress,” she said, striding towards him with her arms crossed. “Knowing how much this year means to you with everything on, and that so much hinges on us being chosen for the Mark. I told myself, so what if he’s lying about having Quidditch practice? I ought not to pry.”
“That’s a bit unfair then, isn’t it,” said Harry, surprised that he didn’t know something so important about his friend. Surely he’d know if Draco were dealing in dark artefacts, he had spent hours inside his memories at this point.
“They summoned some creature with a mark in the sky, and it was hovering over—” Harry suddenly sat bold upright in bed, opening a searing pain down his leg where he’d been hit by a curse. “Where’s Charlotte?”
“Whatever happens, it won’t affect the game we have to play in a few hours,” said Draco forcefully. “Nott, channel that energy into smashing Hufflepuff. Pansy, I’ll come find you after the game. My father will know more about this.”
“Stay here,” said Cedric, shaking his head and heading to the door. “I need to speak with McGonagall.”
“Oh really? She’s probably just a fling for Harry. I wouldn’t think anything of it,” said Pansy, attempting to dismiss this line of conversation.
Dumbledore gazed at him fondly as Harry accepted the gift of a brown paper bag, opening it to pull out the queen that was sitting in front of Draco at this very moment. There was no mistaking it; this wasn’t some strange experiment of Dumbledore’s. He was gazing at Harry with an expression full of love.
Harry leaned into the touch, and before he knew it, Draco’s hand was threaded into his hair. The funny memory was still buzzing around like a loose fly in his brain, but he ignored it.
“It hasn’t changed anything yet,” said Draco, glancing back to the foyer door. Where was the messy haired git?
“She’s in some sort of trance, but otherwise stable,” he said, glancing away again to grab his gloves off the floor. “She’ll just be like this, sleeping for as long as it lasts.”
“One missing professor, a strange attack. This doesn’t prove anything,” said Draco, swallowing queasily.
“You can tell me anything, Draco,” said Pansy, reaching out to run a comforting hand across his shoulder.
“Curse breaking is not as simple as a flick of the wrist, surely the brethren know that,” Borgin stammered, but at Draco’s scowl, he quickly leaned back over the ring and directed a few spells in its direction. “But, but yes, let me see if a revealing charm would… no, that’s not it.”
“A Horcrux?” asked Hermione when they were back in the Room of Requirement. “I’ve never heard of such a thing.”
Luna looked like she was about to respond, but at that moment, Professor Lockhart, who had resumed his reading with gusto, suddenly broke off.
Ivy slithered out of Harry’s pocket and he caught her and placed her on top of the covers, where she quickly made her way to the corner nearest Draco.
Hermione was trying to put on a brave face but was struggling to mask the worry in her eyes. And she wasn’t wrong. Even if they had backup, they would still need a miracle to pull this off. It was the one time he wouldn’t be annoyed to see a deus ex machina.
Wise words indeed, thought Draco, turning away from the door. Perhaps his designs to get Potter turned over to the Ministry were premature. The only way he could retain control over the situation would be by keeping Potter close. And if that’s what it took, he could make himself indispensable.
“Great. What about something useful like a basic counter-curse?” Harry rose to the desk for his copy of
Harry turned, smiling, and clapped a hand on Hermione’s shoulder. “You’re a genius, Hermione. Ollivander will be able to tell us who Voldemort really was! He said it was his wand that Voldemort used, he’d have matched him when he was just a kid. If we know that, we’ll have a significantly better chance of figuring out what kind of magic he would have been using.”
As they crunched across the frosty grass out towards the forest, Harry took one look back at the grand castle. He’d miss the friends he’d made here, but it didn’t do to dwell, as Luna would say. The image of Malfoy’s trademark smirk swam to mind but he pushed it away. Who knew, maybe their paths would cross again in the future.
“I dreamed about going to university when I was little. Do you think you’ll still want to do that when you get back, now that you know this world exists?” asked Hermione, positioning Harry’s arm. “Remember your grip, and then just a gentle…”
There was no way of knowing for sure whether it was even possible, but If he could just get Potter in front of the right person and trick him into giving away his identity, perhaps he would be able to skirt the limitations of the Fidelius. The trick would be making sure that person was well under Draco’s control, and they knew what to do with the information once they got it.
“Thanks,” said Harry, but Draco’s eyes darted to his parchment, where he was detailing the notes of his part in the plan. “And I am. It’s scrappy, sure, but that means they won’t be expecting it. No one is expecting a group of teenagers to do anything, let alone save the world.”
They sat around the kitchen table as Kreacher prepared dinner and Hermione decoded the letter, grumbling about how a simple substitution cipher would not provide a substantial line of defence if the letter made its way into the wrong hands.
“There’s loads! Everyone loves Quidditch of course, but there’s also clubs for Gobstones and exploding snap. And a few weekends a year we’re allowed to go down to Hogsmeade where there’s all sorts of bookstores and cafes. Sometimes I just like wandering around the grounds and sketching plants in the greenhouses or talking with the school ghosts.”
Pansy looked like she wanted to ask for something else when suddenly Lockhart burst into the centre of the room, breaking the fourth wall of his reading for dramatic effect and startling Neville Longbottom out of his chair.
“No, it’s Charlotte,” said Harry, full to bursting with pride for his brilliant friend. “She told me what they’re planning. In the Dr Who movie, the Master attempts to steal the Doctor’s regeneration,”
“Just reading each other’s fortunes,” said Luna. As she looked up, Draco could see the green snake was wound into the curls of her hair, poking its head out near her ear. It flicked its tongue in his direction.
“At least we can take some comfort in the fact that he’s twice the mortality age of most Obscurials on record.”
“But Harry, it might really be an impossible task,” said Hermione. “I mean I don’t know about the rest of you, but I still want to finish my education and get a good job before I go risking my life.”
“It’ll be fun,” said Harry from under the cloak. “Get a little fresh air, unmask the Dark Lord, destroy part of his soul. Just a regular Saturday in my books.”
“What would you do if you were in my shoes?” Draco asked, knowing that if Snape were anything like himself he would never reveal his true allegiances either way.
Draco hit the trick step once more with a powerful Un-Sticking Charm and Harry yanked his foot free. They dashed the last few flights to the second floor corridor and ran towards the familiar gargoyle.
Draco didn’t need to ask twice about what his father was implying. If Voldemort was on to his secrets, there’d be no use lying anyway. He had gotten careless; taking the ring to Borgin’s was a mistake. Telling his mother to tip off the Death Eaters on Potter’s escape, he’d come to realise, was an even bigger one.
Harry turned to shield himself from the blade as it erupted in flame with a screech like a dragon. He bit down against the blinding pain in his scar and the scorching heat from the blade on the side of him that wielded it, forcing himself to focus on his purpose. On the magic coursing through him, and the villain who stood before him, and of the boy who he may yet save.
“And while we’re on the topic, I find it interesting that when we were having our little heart-to-heart, you neglected to mention that you were nearly the casualty of a full on Reductor Curse a few weeks before leaving the force. Can’t imagine that has something to do with your little ‘ongoing investigation’, does it?”
“I had no idea,” said Draco, his mouth like sandpaper. In a matter of moments he’d gone from feeling like he had all the cards in his hands, to questioning whether anything his father had told him of his life before the war was true.
He laid a gentle hand on her back as Blaise and Theo sized him up over her shoulder. “I’ll do my best.”
He and Luna tried asking the room for Horcruxes a few more times, but the room failed to appear. It materialised once when they requested a lost object of great value, but the room was so stacked full of towers of objects floor to ceiling that they didn’t bother.
Draco tried to suppress a strangled cry of pain, but it was too late. Pansy was right on top of him. Her small hand clamped onto his wrist and she dragged the sleeve of his robes up.
“Oh you know, looking for something of Riddle’s, something that holds a soul, something of great value hidden away.” Luna waved one hand lightly as she turned again. “The room gets it.”
Draco felt deeply uneasy watching the scene play out, and for a minute wondered whether he had pushed Potter too far, though he was no longer resisting. Unlike the other memories where Harry had suffered abuse at the hands of his guardians and brushed it off or stood up for himself, this one was different. He couldn’t have been much older than a boy, but he seemed to be genuinely afraid for his life.
The two men took a few strides towards them, pulling wands out of their pockets. “Clear as they day they died,” said Carrow, tilting his head and smiling as if at a rabbit in a trap.
Draco was baffled. He scanned his Professor’s face for any sign of deception but Snape was being completely honest, if not entertained, by this revelation.
“Still some practice to be done, but I think so. What do you reckon, Granger?” said Cedric, turning to Hermione who was perched on a stool scribbling notes.
“Oh to be sure,” said Luna airily. “Sometimes I spend extra time with Professor Flitwick going over experimental charms I’m trying. He usually discourages me.”
Hermione’s eyes narrowed, but she turned to Harry with a smile. “Anyway, Harry, McGonagall was really pleased to hear about your progress, so think of Luna as an extra pair of hands. Anything that you practise with me, you can practise again with her.”
“Harry hasn’t been saying anything strange, has he?” Draco asked in a casual tone. “Only because I read in the paper that he got a serious confundus to the head on his last case, and the
At his next pass with Mr DuPont, he revisited his mental list of conversation topics, wearing out travel destinations, favourite books, and musical preferences before landing back on sport again. This ultimately led him to recent Quodpot match highlights, to which he could only nod along agreeably. This was not good. Only four holes into the game and his list was already running dry. Plus, he wasn’t sure how much more agreeable nodding along to Quodpot lectures he had in him.
Harry could feel an energy rushing through him. He couldn’t tell if it was relief at controlling his magic for the first time, or excitement at the accomplishment, or the energy of the magic itself. But he hadn’t felt this proud of something he’d created since he’d written his first piece of code under Mr Salerni’s teaching.
“Still! She’s lucky it didn’t turn her to stone on the spot or something. My ability to heal has its limits.”
“Be that as it may,” said McGonagall, her expression growing tight, “She is well suited to the task. She doesn’t have Head Boy duties to worry about nor Quidditch practice to miss, and may I remind you she’s at the top of your year.”
Draco started, caught off guard by the question. “I guess we’re just a different sort,” he said, taking a sip. “I keep to the Slytherins mostly.”
“The magic community can be so blind to Muggle solutions sometimes that they get things completely wrong – and this is one of those times. I think the same might hold for Ariana Dumbledore and possibly for you too.”
Draco was late to the vast lecture hall for first period Defence Against the Dark Arts the next morning. He’d stopped by the library after breakfast to pick up some reading on the demise of the Potters in the First Wizarding War. But Pansy had luckily saved him a seat next to her at the back of the class.
Harry felt the familiar whirlpool as his eyes locked with Hermione’s and they were sucked down into his memory.
Harry gripped the straps of his backpack, reciting the plan in his mind. He’d come too far to be derailed now by crooked rhetoric.
He would have found this an interesting puzzle to mull over, if he wasn’t using all of his mental energy to suppress his feelings of utter annoyance.
Minerva was still trying to wrap her mind around the news, unable to comprehend how an infant could spell the end for one of the most powerful wizards in history, when Dumbledore continued saying with a confident smile that the child was being transported to this very spot at this very moment, in the hands of a trusted compatriot. The very gamekeeper that had tipped her off to Dumbledore’s destination no less; a lovable man, but one more suited to wrestling a Graphorn than collecting an infant from a crime scene.
He refused to cry as he pulled Dudley’s bike out of the side yard and started pedalling hard towards Lilac Ave. He was leaving behind a life he had always hated and turning to the one true family he had. Whatever lay ahead of him, he knew he could face it, if he and Charlotte could just get through this night.
“Even if we had all of them right now, there’s still the matter of destroying them,” said Cedric, picking up the locket and inspecting it in the firelight. “If Dumbledore couldn’t destroy the ring, I’d say it’ll take more than your garden variety Blasting Curse.”
“That was just a bit of fun,” said Angelica with a shrug. “You guys were making such a big deal out of him. I thought it’d be fun to see what he was like. He’s darling by the way.”
“Definitely not. It’s a rare gift in fact. The founder of the Slytherin House could speak Parseltongue, hence the snake motif. It tends to accompany very powerful magic,” Draco said this flippantly, but Harry thought he could detect an undertone of seriousness.
He was pressing in again on the thoughts of Harry, of McGonagall. The Fidelius held, but when pressured, they became hazy, like white paint had been sloppily applied to any memories of Harry. When he couldn’t make any headway there, he raked over any mortifying or personally guarded memory he could find – his kiss with Theo, his fear pulling Snape’s unresponsive form from the basin of the Pensieve, the sadness in his heart at the loss of Dumbledore.
Yaxley and Carrow broke into peals of laughter. “It’s that type of nobility that got your father killed, boy.”
“Even if you made it back, the blood magic is all dried up at your Muggle residence. You’ll be defenceless,” said McGonagall, her voice shaking. “You don’t understand the danger—”
“Don’t blame Draco for Harry’s impulsiveness,” said Hermione, stepping between the two of them. Draco would have been comforted by Hermione coming to defence if it didn’t break his heart that she was actually wrong to believe in him.
Harry felt the tingling growing stronger in his fingertips as his anger built up inside of him, but for once he didn’t try to force it away. He was angry, and he wanted to be. The Death Eaters around him were growing restless as well, reaching for their wands and waiting for the command from their master that would unleash them.
“I know the type,” said Harry. He could have guessed that much from the way Malfoy held himself; his confident posture, the way he sauntered into the room and ran his hands across Harry’s things as if he owned them. “I can deal with him if it means learning what I need to to get out of here.”
“Yeah, but Cedric reckons it has something to do with my bursts of magic, or maybe learning to control it later in life.” Harry tried to put on his best disarming smile as Hermione got to the page of notes on experimental spells and her eyebrows raised straight off her forehead. “Don’t get mad, but we started trying loads of different spells and component pieces to see what I could do best, and then we figured out how to stack them so even really simple spells can be used effectively in battle.”
Harry loved flying; the feeling that at any moment, he could take off and never look back. It was as liberating as the dream of Edinburgh had been to him the last few years with the Dursleys. Plus, it didn’t hurt that his flying instructor looked unreasonably good on a broom.
“That?” Harry felt momentarily silly that he’d brought it along with everything else going on. “It was a gift from ages ago.”
“He’s not to be punished,” said Harry, his confidence wavering slightly as the demonic eyes bored into him, now hooded by a scowl. “He was coerced. Into helping me.”
He inspected his left arm — it did not bear the Mark. Looking down, he spotted trainers poking out from below. What in fresh hell? He had to check his reflection in the kettle just to make sure he was even himself.
Instead, he grabbed Draco’s other wrist, pulling him close. Draco pressed his forehead to Harry’s, and all Harry wanted to do was pull him closer.
She fixed him with an incredulous look and laughed. “Merlin, you’re being so serious today! It’ll be fine. He knows what happens when two people love each other. Besides, you have asked to marry me, haven’t you?”
“What about this one, Beedle?” asked Luna, pointing to a painting of a fern grotto with a gentle waterfall.
“Defeat Voldemort,” said Harry, plainly. McGonagall looked like she couldn't decide whether to laugh or cry.
“Yeah, she’s also brilliant by muggle standards,” said Harry with a smile. “And don’t forget, Cedric is working with Muggles as well. I’d wager our worlds are coming closer together, not farther apart.”
“There is a dark artefacts store in Diagon Alley, but that’s all the way in London,” said Hermione, biting her thumbnail in thought.
“You’re different,” said Draco, a funny look spreading across his face – as though he were trying to figure out what it was about Harry that made him all that different.
“Oh, I quite agree,” said Voldemort. “Which is why I’m making this offer. I want nothing to do with the girl, you want to see her freed, it’s a fair exchange. I will even guarantee her safety if it means something to you.”
“No, it’s a compliment,” laughed Harry. “She means you smell like the outdoors. Both of us have been inside for so long she’s probably starting to forget what it’s like out there.”
“Lay off her,” said Cedric, stepping between the two and shoving Draco hard in the chest. “You’ve made your point, Malfoy. What more do you want?”
Slipping into the vision of the diadem, Draco braced himself for a reality in which he was back at the Manor with the brethren, or perhaps in Wisteria Hall where the Dark Lord’s forces were gathering. He was surprised then to find himself in a brightly lit cottage with the midafternoon sun streaking through a nearby window and falling on a cosy, trinket-filled sitting room.
McGonagall sighed. “I feared it would come to this. What I need from you is an honest assessment of whether you think he’ll be ready when the time comes.”
The three stood facing each other on the dark pavement in silence for a few moments before Hagrid ventured, “Disappear, sir?”
Tomorrow he would simply tell her that Harry had been plastered, and he’d stuck around to make sure he was alright. It was a good enough lie, and he could finesse it in the morning. Not like he needed to lie — Nothing had even happened with Potter in the end, much to his chagrin. He suppressed the memory of Potter avoiding his attentions, as a fresh wave of embarrassment rose in him, and opened the door to his room quietly.
Snape looked at them, but his gaze seemed far away. “There are things you don’t understand. The veil grows worn and thin, Draco. When the mirror looks both ways, I’m afraid…”
“Don’t worry about it, Hermione. I wouldn’t expect anything different from them.” Harry felt a familiar combination of responsibility and loathing, but shoved it down. “I’m just glad they let you pick up my things.”
As he rounded the corner onto Privet Drive, the dark looming shape of the old house he hated so much gave him a chill, but he steeled himself and cast a quiet
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw the great snake Nagini slithering towards the door. Draco reached for his wand but Harry put a hand out to stop him, the thought of Ivy swimming to his mind.
“No, no, makes perfect sense. I was only thinking whether we ought to get Longbottom in to teach him Herbology as well. That is, if he wasn’t looking worse for wear after this week’s Jittering Juniper lesson—”
“I can shrink the trunk so we can take it,” said Hermione, rising quickly. “If you can get a Pensieve, we can probably take that too. Didn’t you say Snape had one?”
“Ya think?” Tonks laughed mirthlessly. “After watching Dementors and Death Eaters ravage their city for 12 months, I think a little
But Kreacher was not running towards him. He stumbled the last few steps towards the sitting area, arms outstretched, reaching for the locket.
“Riddle,” he said in a voice barely louder than a whisper. He looked past them into the store, as though reliving the day he met the man. “Tom Riddle. Such a strong sense of magic from that boy. I knew it when I saw him. Thirteen and a half inches, yew, Phoenix feather core. I hardly recognised him when he re-emerged in the war, but the wand… unmistakable.”
“What could possibly make him believe that? Surely there’s nothing Potter can do that would leave a scratch on him, I’ve seen his power with my own eyes,” snapped Draco.
would run the headlines of the Potters’ tragic end. It would be sensational news for a while, though soon the wizarding world would come to forget. But she would not. After all, he was not merely the boy who disappeared, but the boy who lived.
“Unbelievable,” he muttered, inspecting a suit of armour at close range and jumping back with a noise of alarm when the helmeted head turned to inspect him back.
Harry tried his best to remain stoic during this diatribe, but he was only bluffing with Al’s name. He had no idea what his old friend thought of the Dark Lord. Moreover, Voldemort wasn’t wrong that Al had supported Harry only so long as he was doing what Al designed, and had flipped on him when he’d chosen his own path.
Voldemort was clearly not expecting this outburst from a mere Muggle. As Death Eaters jumped to their feet at the table behind her, Voldemort shoved her backwards where she fell in a heap.
The inside appeared exactly as Draco would have expected an abandoned Muggle establishment to look. Banged up chairs were still gathered in clusters around tables, waiting for beers to fill their dusty coasters. But as the two of them wound their way through the room, a head poked out from behind a kitchen door.
Draco rose and followed Tonks into the sitting room where she was pulling on a pair of boots by the front door.
This was no good. The smokescreen was clearing into the open air. He wouldn’t have much time before they found him, and on this leg he’d have no shot of making a run for it. If only he knew a blasting curse or something substantial. Diggory’s defensive magic was quickly exhausted in the face of real assailants, who had probably by now figured out that the worst Harry could do was try and dodge them.
Harry spotted a stack of newspapers outside, flashing with black and white text. He would have ignored the now trivial display of magic except he caught the headline
Blaise swivelled his head from its reclining position to fix Draco with a baffled expression. “Are you mental? I wouldn’t touch Granger with a ten-foot pole.”
Before he knew it, he could feel the sense of something pressing in on his thoughts. Unlike the well-travelled passageway into his thoughts that Malfoy had taken, this was a cold sensation, like water down the back of his neck. Could it be this person was trying to enter his mind as he was doing now?
“I guess so,” said Harry. It was true Hermione was clearly motivated by Harry’s achievements more than anything. She just baulked whenever he pushed her to bend the rules.
“Since we already tried the Un-Sticking Charm once, they might be ready for it,” said Hermione, over a bite of biscuit. “So instead I’ll head to the defence classroom and release Lockhart’s Cornish Pixie swarm. They’ll be easy enough to lead to the Hall to cause chaos and – oh!” Hermione stopped so suddenly the others jumped. “Kreacher, these are delicious!”
“You better watch out for this one,” said DuPont to Draco, shaking a playful finger at his daughter. “Six summers in a row, we got her golfing lessons until she outgrew the coach. When she was little, we even thought about going pro.”
“I am sorry, Harry. You deserved to know sooner. It is my single biggest regret,” said the portrait, folding his hands in his lap. “But the fact that you are here shows me that there were better teachers for you than I.”
“Hermione, stop, I am Harry,” said Harry, grappling against his restraints until they constricted so tightly that he was struggling for breath. “Just not… your Harry.”
“I can’t help it,” said Harry, watching in wonder as the translucent figure of a woman glided by. “I’ve been dreaming about a place like this my whole life. You guys must have some idea how incredible it is that what’s mundane to you the rest of the world can’t even imagine.”
It wasn’t until the conversation started veering towards Draco’s stake in the matter that he remembered with a shock how it ended. He tried to close it off, but Harry had felt his surprise and was now interested to see what would unfold.
“But why didn’t it show Luna that if that was the timeline we were meant to see?” asked Draco, who Harry was pleased to see had changed out of his Quidditch gear and back into Harry’s t-shirt.
That evening, once Hermione and Cedric had helped return the room to his living quarters and repaired a few pieces of missing stone from the castle walls, Harry sat with his chin resting on his folded arms, gazing into Ivy’s terrarium. He’d popped a bit of raw meat in the corner of her space, hoping it would entice her out.
“Well done, Angel!” said DuPont in passing, a crisp Scottish breeze whipping around his clear nest of flyaway hairs. “Alright boys, best to keep a low ball with this level of wind. Watch and learn.” Mr Dupont made contact with a comparably loud crack, sending the ball sailing. Draco could have sworn the ball course-corrected in midair, as DuPont jerked his head to urge it towards the centre of the fairway, but he turned around beaming just the same.
Over the ringing in his ears, Harry could hear footsteps on the stairs. He turned, blinded with hope, only to see Hermione clambering into view.
Draco hardly registered how long the ceremony lasted, but by the time it was over, he was near the edge of consciousness and his arm was a mangled mess but the dark black lines of the skull and snake had emerged from within. Charlotte lay motionless on the ground.
Draco’s eyes lit up. Could it be? Could his brilliant, beautiful, ruthless best friend have single-handedly cracked the Fidelius? A wave of relief washed over him.
Harry wasn’t wrong. Draco feared the Dark Lord, but you’d have to be mad not to. And although he feared him, there was a part of him that so deeply wanted to be acknowledged by him that he had let it guide most of his decisions. He was convinced there was only one way to ascend to power and it would be at the Dark Lord’s side.
“Hm, makes sense,” mused Draco. He didn’t care a lick about broken muggle bones, but when it came to financial return, he was all ears. “If less than half a percent of the population is magical — and I assume the concentration is similar in the US — then we’re talking what, 250 million individuals in your non-magical customer base versus a million in the magical population?”
“Today is December 15, 1997, right?” he asked. Hermione did not respond. “It is for me too, but not in this timeline. Right now I’m at Hogwarts in the Room of Requirement with Luna and Malfoy. We’ve just found another Horcrux—”
at least?” said Draco, knowing full well that the other two would not have trusted him with much more than that until they knew whether his flares were under control.
Damn, just his luck. Looked like he’d have to make early use of the cover story after all. He sucked it up and put on a placating expression.
which flew across the room and slammed into the far wall. Harry raked his hair out of his face, trying to think logically. What would Draco want him to do?
Luna looked up at Harry with an expression of resolve. “What I’m wondering is how you’re meant to activate its knowledge-giving properties. We could certainly use a bit of insight after all.” She rose to her feet, diadem still in hand and fringed leather jacket rustling around her. “But I think the task is clear, insofar as it gives sight to the wearer…”
Hermione arrived a few hours later to find Harry dozing in the window seat and Luna asleep on a pile of cushions on the couch, with Ivy curled up between the pages of a Herblogy text on her lap. Ignoring the evidence of several failed experimental charms around the room, Hermione pulled some coffee off the elf shelf and started going through the hundreds of small memory phials, selecting a new pile for review.
“I wrote to one of my coven sisters, Violet, and she said it’s even more exclusive than the old prohibition clubs in New York,” Angelica continued, looking around at the others with excitement. “She was absolutely dead with jealousy.”
“Ah, so that’s what all these years of sucking up to McGonagall has bought you?” Draco stood over her, eyeing the Restricted Section pass.
“Why are you telling me this?” He asked. “I know you want to kill me, so why go to all this trouble first? Surely you have the manpower. Why not overtake me and be done with it?”
“Wow, this is what it feels like when it’s in control,” mused Harry. “Normally by this point someone’s lost their eyebrows. How long does it take to grow out of the flare-ups?”
Voldemort drummed his skeletal fingers on the arm of the chair, thoughtfully. “It is my suspicion that upon Dumbledore’s death, the care of the boy fell into McGonagall’s hands, and that she is harbouring the boy at Hogwarts. It is the only place with magic strong enough that his presence might be obscured, and where the wards might dampen the mental link. I had wondered, whether she would have confided such a thing in her most trustworthy Head Boy.”
“Do not tell me you’re frowning because you forgot an ingredient,” said Pansy’s voice in his ear. “There’s literally five minutes left of this lesson and I don’t have time to re-brew this.”
“You are such an idiot sometimes,” he said, letting go of Draco roughly, who stumbled back against the building. “I never should have mentioned that to you. And what the hell do you think you’re doing bringing it up in such a public place?”
“I mean you still ought to tell me,” she said, returning the embrace. “I am your girlfriend after all.”
“I’d back that guess,” said Harry casually. “What do you say, Malfoy? Would you bet ten galleons against the word of a clairvoyant?”
“Then why bother coming at all, Smith?” said a pretty red-headed witch who rolled her eyes and reminded Harry very much of Charlotte. “Feel free to run home to mummy and we’ll finish the job without you, alright?”
The letter in question was an attempt at writing to his mother about Potter. He knew, of course, that the Fidelius Charm would keep him from revealing Potter’s existence as well as his whereabouts, but Draco knew that even a good spell has its loopholes.
“Hell if I know,” said Draco, rising to walk the few paces to the far side of the room, where he knelt beside the hysterical elf.
said Ivy’s small voice from near his neck as he hastened to pack away the books that he thought would be most useful when he was on the run.
“Alright,” said Draco with a shrug, and Pansy smiled prettily. “See you professor” he called, collecting Pansy under one arm as he draped it around her shoulder and guided her back out into the hallway.
“Well, he was at the appeal hearing, so he would know,” said Blaise with a shrug. “I wouldn’t worry about it. He’s a skilled Auror. I’m sure he knows what he’s doing.”
“Oh, well, yes I see,” said Draco quickly, unsure of what to say. The only squibs he had ever known had been, well, incompetent, hadn’t they? Greenacre continued to smile, unperturbed, as though he knew the exact thoughts racing around Draco’s head.
So the Fidelius could be weakened, Draco thought. But how to get McGonagall to do so unwittingly? Draco would need some time in Harry’s mind before breaking the charm fully. No need to risk this leverage escaping his clutches too soon.
He tried to control his breathing. He was still on the bed, staring up at Sirius’s bedroom ceiling papered in pictures of bikini-clad women. And another shape, closer, was Draco, leaning over him, looking stricken.
“Mr Longbottom, a victim of sustained Cruciatus damage, was not only mobility-restricted but also cognitively impaired. While considered a witness in the disappearance of his wife earlier this summer, Longbottom could not provide testimony usable to the investigation. The Auror department acknowledges the possible linkage between the case and has declined to reveal any further information at this time. ‘Our sincerest condolences go out to the family,’ says Healer Marina. ‘And we at St Mungo’s will continue to cooperate with the investigation in any way possible.’”
Looking down, Draco saw the faint outline of the Dark Mark beginning to form on his arm, before Voldemort stripped away another layer of skin. “Not good enough,” he hissed. ”Again.”
The smoke was so thick now Harry could only see fluffy white clouds at the end of the hall, and with the echoing in the space he could hardly tell where a taunting laugh was coming from.
“I’m sure he’s not,” said Harry definitively. It didn’t do to dwell on the past. “There are some things no one can survive.”
Big shoutout again to my beta, Honeybeet, who spots all of my plot holes and grammar mistakes. H also supplied a few of the great names in this chapter like Flamel & Sons!
“That’s just great.” Harry shoved himself back from the table. “If I wasn’t already being hunted by unidentified dark forces, I’d be dying anyway of a magical parasite. I’m starting to think I was better off as a Muggle. I haven’t gotten any answers about what happened to my parents, or why I’m being targeted for this, only that I’m probably not safe anywhere at this point. On top of which I can’t do basic Transfiguration to save my life.”
Harry looks at Draco with a cheeky grin, and Draco nearly slides off his stool when Harry sticks his tongue out in jest.
“What if we can figure out a way to shorten the process?” Draco proposes, mind racing through possibilities. “Raise the heat or strengthen the
Potter actually looks sheepish. “Well, I helped. Without McGonagall’s advice, we’d still be repainting every year and using Heating Charms to melt the snow every morning. Pain in the arse, that was.” Draco’s eyebrows migrate upwards as Potter chuckles at the memory.
Draco takes a quick glance at Potter and shoves his hands in his pockets, discomfited with the line of conversation. The corners of Potter’s lips hang heavy, and a sadness colors his usually bright eyes. It’s not a look that Draco has ever seen on the Boy Who Lived, and he’s not sure he wants to see it again.
“It’s very sensitive, the process for the cores. Involves a lot of precision and a lot of time,” Harry explains. “We either start early or end extremely late. Sam preferred the former, and it’s just a habit for me at this point.”
“You’ve an image, Potter—whether you like it or not. The world at large still thinks you’re a goody-two-shoes, and, clearly, you’ve tried to subvert expectations at every opportunity.” Harry feigns innocence, and Draco throws him a knowing glare. “I’m just interested in your efforts.”
A sudden flick of the wolf’s tail captures Draco’s attention. His mind floods with images of braided Thestral hairs in glass bottles, feathers floating over open flame, and a spectral wolf pack racing in the moonlight.
“I don’t know… You seem to like the technical stuff,” Harry answers. An anticipatory pause hangs between them as Harry tugs his lower lip between his teeth. Apparently deciding against restraint, he says, “You’re good at it.” He picks a quill out of a plastic cup and peels at the fine feathers, but Draco’s eyes linger over the rosy pink that tints Harry’s cheeks.
Draco earned good marks; that’s undeniable. But any elation in his success had quickly deflated whenever a patient declined his care or demanded to see his forearm. His shoulder still twinges at the memory of a particularly nasty Stinging Hex he’d caught from a demented ex-Auror last semester.
“It’ll be here when you get back. I’ll set the feather to rotate, and the ash wands need to steep at least twelve hours. It’ll be fine.” Harry waves Draco’s concern off in a gesture of dismissal.
Draco eyes the selection of trail mix on the countertop and wonders if his hunger is impacting his judgment.
“Today’s a warm day,” Potter explains as he makes his way down the front porch steps. Draco, wrapped in a double layer of coats and a wool hat, is very much uninterested in discovering what qualifies as a
The refrain of howling fades to a single wolf. The hair prickles on the back of Draco’s neck as he tries to appeal to the
The next words that Draco hisses drip from his lips like venom. “Perhaps not, but that’s not the point. You know what else I know? I know you can run all you want, Potter. To Alaska. To Japan. To Saturn. In fact, we both can. But at the end of the day, we have something in common: no matter where we are or how far we run, we’re both going to lie awake at night, wishing we would wake up as someone else.”
As he nears Potter’s cabin, Draco’s steps slow until he stands still at the top of the gravel drive, eyes fixed on the lit window in the workshop. In this moment, he feels a bit like the trees, buried beneath an insurmountable weight, longing for a breeze to ease the pressure from his shoulders.
Unfortunately, Potter chooses not to engage and says, “I don’t live in Seldovia. It’s just the closest place to land a plane. We’re going to Volchii.”
“Do you want me to say no? Call it a hunch, but I feel like you probably don’t want to talk about this.”
Draco turns back towards his notes on the table as Harry moves to stand over his shoulder. The bright and musky scent of the woods clings to Harry’s skin, mixing with the palpable crackle of his magic. After spending time running with the wolves, quite literally, it rolls off of him in waves.
They land just outside of Rory’s, and Draco’s legs waver when the solid ground meets his feet, unsteady from the lengthy hike of the afternoon. His stomach flips when he glances at Harry, realizing he’s not yet released Harry’s forearm.
Potter doesn’t speak another word as he reaches across the car to pull the opposite door handle. The door falls open, and Potter turns to look at Draco with a defeated expression. Draco doesn’t move, putting forth every effort to project confidence as his nervous system frantically debates the merits of getting in the car versus spending the night on the icy pavement. Impatient, Potter widens his eyes and cocks an eyebrow, challenging Draco to turn down the invitation. Far too proud when it comes to Potter, Draco sighs and knows he can’t turn back now.
Though the fireworks really do make the Weasley twins’ experiments look like child’s play, Draco claps mindlessly at each one, his attention diverted to the heat of Harry’s thigh against his own. He hardly hears Rory yell, “Harry, this one’s for you, honey!” before a golden lion elegantly rises from crimson and gold crashing waves. The lion releases a powerful roar, rattling Draco’s chest, before it shatters into a million golden sparks, raining into the dark waters below.
“Should I be scared? Am I being kidnapped?” In an effort to calm his nerves, Draco settles into an old habit of prodding at Potter.
Always the voice of reason, Ginny had given Draco a sympathetic pat on the shoulder while scowling at her girlfriend’s negativity. “You won’t die,” she’d said. “Probably.”
at the bundles. They burst in showers of sparkling flame, waterfalls of shimmers, and blooms of glittering color. From the rolling waves of sparks, stampedes of horses, and lions, and wolves emerge to gallop across the surface of the icy waves beneath them. After circling the bay, they evaporate in an iridescent mist of golds and pinks.
And sure, Draco will be the first to admit that he’s still unbearable some days. But most days, he’s
“I’m calling bullshit on that,” Harry says, waving his hand in dismissal. “But anyway, I may have taken
“Yes, yes,” Draco tuts. “Calm down. I had a very detailed discussion with Meg when I bought the box yesterday. But desperate times and all that…” He waves the spatula to emphasize his point.
This chapter contains some minor, but somewhat detailed, descriptions of human injury and the healing of that injury.
A group of children clumsily build a snowman down the way, tumbling about in the street. Their young and underdeveloped magic isn’t quite enough to convince the snow to hold. They laugh anyway.
“How’d you get Weasley’s products all the way over here? Did you have to go through customs?” Draco asks, unsure if he just wants to irritate Potter or if he wants to know the answer.
The first few years of training were quiet. Most of the students had stayed clear of Draco as if he secreted a foul smell, and, if he were honest with himself, he preferred it that way. Since he enrolled a bit later than is traditional, his cohort had included a few younger Hogwarts students. One of them had been a third-year Ravenclaw he’d vividly remembered torturing under Alecto Carrow’s judgmental glare. Unable to tolerate the memory or her possible reaction to Draco’s presence, he’d spent the majority of that day emptying his stomach in the bathroom.
They wait and eat in uncomfortable silence, interrupted only by the clink of silverware on ceramic and the tick of the clock above the sink. Draco keeps his eyes on his plate and fights the harrowed feeling in his muscles. Without the distraction of trees and charms and tasks, he’s left bouncing his knee and searching for anything to fill the silence.
Malfoy. You’re so full of shit,” Potter spits before backing away. “Don’t pretend like you know anything about me.” It’s this idea that, for some reason, bristles Draco’s already-sensitive nerves, rubbing them raw and painful. Rather than take the time to examine the feeling, he pushes it aside and unleashes his tongue instead.
Bathed in the glow of Rory’s fireworks and hot from the press of Harry at his side, Draco fights to keep his expression neutral. He frantically tries to pinpoint when his entire concept of Harry became so muddled, so complicated. Bewildered, Draco thinks it had to have started the day he arrived to find Harry driving a Muggle car and hiding from the world in the veil of his own breath and a horrendous plaid coat. Though, Draco realizes, it doesn’t really matter, at the end of all things, when or why or how Harry shed his role of school-age nemesis like an old layer of skin. Just that he did. And Draco finds himself holding his breath, wondering what Harry really means to him and worrying about whether Harry wonders about him, too.
Draco pauses, and he realizes what Harry’s said is true. “Fair,” he admits. And then, with a smile, says, “You’ve gotten soft,
“This can’t be legal. I can feel my arteries constricting as we speak,” Draco mumbles around another bite as a drop of gravy slides down his finger. He tilts his head to catch it with his tongue and balances the small takeaway container in the other palm. Potter watches him with an odd intensity before coughing and locking the door to the workshop.
“I’d be a shitty teacher if I didn’t. It’s usually more subtle than this, that gut feeling, but now you may be able to recognize it next time. Let’s go; I’m starving.”
“You’re always full of questions. It’s my turn,” Harry calls over his shoulder, inciting a few early birds to flee from the trees ahead. His pace slows to a meandering crawl as the trail steepens.
might mean. His face contorts further as he realizes he will have to ride in that car. In fact, Draco’s almost too distracted by the impending doom that he nearly overlooks the fact that the man’s accent is distinctly unlike that of the woman’s inside. Oddly, it’s much more reminiscent of his own.
Still ignorant of its dramatic relocation, Draco’s body aches for a warm bed and a deep, dreamless sleep as he and Potter hike upwards through the dense forest behind Potter’s cabin. The sound of Potter’s heavy footsteps is intrusive in the eerie quiet of the woods, accompanied only by the occasional fluttering of wings.
Draco’s hand stiffens with a cramp as he scratches out the last line on the final page of his notebook. The pages have filled rapidly over the last several days with calculations and notes. Some lines are crossed out and corrected, while others are crossed out, only to be rewritten later, word-for-word in the spare margins. Though it was painstaking, eventually, Draco had managed a recipe for a more concentrated—but stable
“What devious things have you done since school?” Harry asks, and Draco sneers at the question. “And before you start—Draco, wait. Don’t walk away, Draco; I don’t mean it like that. Just for fun. Promise.”
“I am ridiculous. You should try it sometime,” Harry says with a grin. Draco can only roll his eyes. “Anyway… Maybe we’ll get to a blended core before you have to leave. I think you’d be good at them.”
Harry smiles and scratches at his arm again, drawing Draco’s eye. A long gash oozes across his forearm, bisecting a prominent vein before trailing off towards his wrist.
“Good for you, I suppose.” Draco rolls his eyes at the futility in this conversation and leans his hip against the countertop. “And the Puking Pastilles?”
“Thanks for the hot chocolate. And sorry about your shirt.” Draco rubs the fabric between his fingers, holding it away from his chest to show off the stains.
They both watch as the sparrow vanishes in a plume of feathers, evaporating against the backdrop of the darkening forest.
“You have got to be kidding me,” Draco drawls, allowing his muscles to relax. “How have I not noticed this? More importantly, how have you managed to keep it a secret for so long?”
Potter simply shrugs. “You read the charms right, don’t worry. But something feels off. I don’t really know how to describe it… you just feel it. You’ll feel it too, eventually.”
Potter sighs impatiently. “I don’t care if you’re nervous, you’re not being kidnapped, and it’ll take about an hour with the roads this bad. Anything else you’re dying to ask?”
“So, I quit. Made everyone mad. But every time I tried to say anything, or explain myself, it felt like they were just… smoothing me over.” Harry coasts his hand over an invisible current. “Ironing out the wrinkles until they saw what they wanted to see. Merlin forbid I
“That’s what fur is for.” Harry laughs and shakes his hair out, splattering droplets across the kitchen floor.
“Come on, Draco, you know the solution to that one… Think about it.” Harry taps his finger against his head and grins, the last sliver of golden sun reflecting in his eyes.
“And what’s got you so convinced that I’ve changed, hm? How’ve I changed?” Potter advances on Draco, a smoldering fury lingering in his eyes like a wolf lying in wait. “Better yet, how’ve you changed, Malfoy? Finished your community service and think all is forgiven? The Malfoy name restored to its former glory?”
“And it works. Sometimes,” Harry huffs, but a smile undermines his frustrated tone. “It worked more often when Sam did it. But I’ve managed a few.” He rolls his own wand towards Draco across the table. “Thunderbird feather and a Thestral tail hair.”
Between his musings, he had formed a long list of worst-case scenarios and possible solutions for good measure.
“Oh, good morning,” a witch says from behind the counter. She flicks a Disillusionment Charm over the back wall of wizarding merchandise and jabs her wand in Draco’s direction. “Can I help you?”
Potter shrugs. “Dunno. Their form waxes and wanes with the phases of the moon. On a full moon, you can actually pet them, but on the new moon, you can’t see them at all.”
Potter is silent as he reverses the vehicle and begins back down the road. Draco hopes he’s contorted his face into an expression of calm while his stomach flips in defiant opposition to his current situation.
“Pretty awesome, isn’t it?” Potter asks as he crouches down to look a wolf in the face. He reaches out to touch, but his hand passes straight through the animal’s skull.
“A lot of wood. But I didn’t damage any of the trees! I swear!” Harry laughs, and Draco wonders when he became addicted to hearing that sound. “But I believe the park rangers would have frowned upon the taking of the wood to begin with.”
he is…” Draco scowls because, of course, Potter would have told them all about his heroism and selflessness and bravery. They probably think he shits Galleons.
Draco wonders what a Jeep is and hears himself say, “I’m surprised that you don’t just shovel it like some unfortunate Muggle.” Potter grimaces. “Fuck, Potter, I didn’t mean anything… The magic is impressive.”
Now, Draco proceeds toward the strip of grey concrete buildings that line the landing strip, perfectly square and equally spaced apart. The precision settles the unease in Draco’s gut in the same way an organized drawer of socks makes him preen.
“And right you are,” said George, motioning them to the back. “I keep telling everyone that with your flying you ought to be doing runs daily, but they keep telling us you’re better use on strategy.”
Harry was not alright. Now that he thought of it, Malfoy was the only one who knew that he’d be at the train station. Could it be that his best friend in the castle had sold him out?
The group passed through a tasselled curtain into a private dining area with a large round table. The walls were jam-packed with framed photos of an Italian coastline, postcards of Rome, and a painting of the pope.
“I’m afraid we’re not giving Harry the best chance at a normal life! The poor boy has lost his parents, and we have no guarantee this family will even take him in.”
Draco followed his gaze where it landed on Hermione in the armchair facing the fire, eating a snowflake biscuit. He pushed back suddenly, pacing back across the room and shoving his hair back with both hands.
He considered offering a few consoling words, but Harry didn’t respond well to overly emotional displays. No, what he needed was a plan of action, a way to unpack all this information and make use of it.
“Harry!” she squealed as she jumped up from the armchair to give him a big hug. “So glad you could make it.”
But even the kiss Draco could see coming from a mile away. No, what was surprising was that for a brief moment after the kiss, Potter’s thoughts shifted to him.
Draco turned, Snape was right on top of him, grabbing him tightly by both arms and staring earnestly into his eyes. His expression was one of grief.
Perhaps it was somewhere along the lines of what Draco had been imagining lately as well: his hands slipping up the back of Harry’s flimsy cotton shirt, running them through messy black hair and dragging him closer, Harry’s lips inches from his own. Draco stopped mid stride so quickly that a wall sconce fluttered in his wake.
“Yes, Mr Malfoy, but I can’t see how we have any choice. The group is still small enough that the charm will hold strong, and perhaps Miss Lovegood would even be willing to join our efforts in educating Potter while he resides here,” said McGonagall, turning to Luna despite Hermione’s expression of outrage.
Someone famously irritating. Draco seethed as Harry shrugged and laughed along with the group at something or other.
“Stop saying the name,” snapped Draco, smacking his hand on the table and making the others jump. “Do you realise what you’re implying? That a mere teacher acting on his own could bring about the return of one of the most powerful wizards of all time and then keep him hidden for years? It’s preposterous.”
With a doubtful glance, her mouth drawn tight, she turned and sped down the corridor and out of sight. When she was gone Draco let out a shaky breath and turned instead towards the Transfigurations corridor.
Questions started flying in from the crowd – everything from “where have you been all these years?” to “is it true you’re secretly Voldemort’s son?” Harry tried answering a few of the more reasonable ones, but the questions started coming harder and faster, and Harry could feel the time they had to act slipping away.
“What are you on about?” asked Draco, not bothering to hide his tone of annoyance. The last thing he needed was a nosy painting telling McGonagall he’d been wandering around suspiciously outside of her classroom.
“All I want is for you to be happy,” said Narcissa, a few teardrops still lingering in her eyes. “Tell me – have you found anyone? Anyone special?”
Hermione’s hand had shot back up in the air again. “I was wondering, Professor. How are we to teach Harry when he hasn’t got a wand?”
“I don’t reckon you’d know anything about this then?” said Blaise, flipping back to the front page of the
“I mean, I don’t know how it’s possible, but if Voldemort is truly dying, it could make sense to pull life from another source. Unless,” she crouched down next to Harry, the locket still clutched in her hand. “Maybe he’s going to use you like a vessel, Like he did Quirrell. To try and possess you somehow. That’s why he wants you there.”
“As he would be, once he realised the consequences of his actions,” said Dumbledore calmly. “The Fidelius Charm on Godric’s Hollow was the last line of defence the Potters had against Voldemort. I offered to keep the secret myself, but James declined. It seems he gave his friend more credit than he was due.”
Pansy gasped in horror, and Draco winced just to catch sight of the thing before shoving her roughly off and pulling his sleeve back down. He hardly even recognised it as his own arm. Skin was peeling away in patches as though burned and the mark was cut so deeply into his flesh it was ringed with a deep red groove. He would never live to forget this act. Ever.
“No, of course,” said Draco as he re-read the note the owl had just dropped off. “It makes perfect sense.”
“And that, I do regret,” said Voldemort, his face falling into a fabricated expression of remorse. “My hand was forced, by none other than Dumbledore’s prophecy. But I hope to spare you the same fate. In fact, I wish to make you an offer… to join me.”
But that was long ago. Back when they could be best friends without worrying about which one of them the Dark Lord would choose.
Harry knelt down to speak to the house-elf as Hermione and Cedric carried on organising the students. “Thanks, Kreacher, I’m sure everyone will need their strength. Your master will be back before you know it, I promise.”
“Fuck, nevermind,” he muttered under his breath. His eyes darted around nervously, his black school robes billowing around him as he walked.
“My point being, this isn’t some fairy tale. We’re gambling with real stakes here,” said Cedric. “If we’re going to do this, we all have to be committed. If one of us is in danger, they need to trust that the person they’re with will do everything they can to help. And also to know that even then, it might not be enough.”
“She’s alive,” said Harry, his breath slowing. “He wants to make a trade. I go to him and he gives us Charlotte.”
Despite growing up at the Manor, he’d never really had his own slice of the world. Sure there was his room, but his mother and the house-elves saw that the only possessions there were fashionable, fitting of his class. And pretty much every other part of the house had the feeling of oppressive ownership by his father or otherwise by
They stared at each other silently for a moment before she spoke. The sound of Vernon’s heavy snoring resonated from the far end of the hall.
Draco’s suggestion on Monday to stick to charms he could reverse was a good one. He'd already made some headway on severing and repairing with Hermione’s blessing, but he was careful to keep his experiments secret.
Whatever concerns Potter had, they paled in comparison to Draco’s burdens. Not only did he have his mother’s safety to worry about, and his accursed guilt over his deception of the rest of the group, he now had Theo following him around like a lost puppy. His dreams were alternatingly tormented with visions of watching Tonks disappear into the rubble of a deteriorating London, and doing things to Potter that he wouldn’t even have attempted with Theo.
“And defensive magic has a bit of a learning curve but Diggory is pragmatic, he’ll skip to what you need to know that’s within your capability. Having a handle on your basic magic will help with that as well.”
“Not really,” said Harry, his eyes darting around the rest of the room as he realised all remaining conversation had ceased.
Malfoy looked momentarily surprised, but his expression smoothed almost immediately. “Darling, I thought you had time with Flitwick for extra Charms prep today?”
“Someone who knows you’re of more use to us working on the cause than on homework,” said Hermione, betraying a hint of a smile and sounding very much like Charlotte – Quickly dragging Harry out of the friendly environment and reminding him of the serious nature of the task at hand.
“He’s not, I can tell,” said Harry. “Even in the few visions I’ve had recently there’s plenty we can learn – he’s being harboured by his followers, for one thing. And he’s not some all powerful dark force, he’s a human. If we watch him long enough, I think I can find his weakness.”
“If two of the confirmed Horcruxes are objects that belonged to Hogwarts founders, I bet the cup is one as well,” said Hermione, sliding the old catalogue of artefacts towards her and rifling through it. “Are there any other founder’s items on there, Luna?”
As the Order descended on the Death Eaters, many began to Apparate away. Some of the newcomers began tending to the wounds of students, while others continued to battle. Cedric and Tonks met to converse briefly on the side of the room as he pointed to the crowd and they split back up to begin apprehending the remaining supporters.
“I’m sure you can see how this puts me in quite a situation,” said Ollivander, tilting his head down to give each of them a meaningful look. “What makes you think I even know the wizard you’re talking about?”
“Enough,” said Umbridge, spinning on her heel, her expression hard. “Now you really are testing my patience. Where are you keeping it? I had to ruin a perfectly good junior Auror to find out you’ve been hiding it from me, now give it up!”
“Yes, well as it happens, the phoenix that provided the feather for your wand, gave one other. Your wand is already quite rare as a phoenix core almost never mixes with holly. The combination produces one of the strongest wands imaginable, though it may take some time to build up to its full strength,” said Ollivander as he busied himself gathering his things from McGonagall’s desk. “It’s brother, phoenix feather and yew, is also very rare. Both powerful combinations, with great potential. Though by Merlin’s grace, I wish we had not seen it.”
“Well, I haven’t accidentally erupted again, so I guess that’s a good sign,” said Harry, inspecting a suit of body armour on the shelves. “But I’m struggling to get a hang of this memory recall thing. Is that normal?”
It was getting warm out for early spring, and the trees in the park near Grimmauld Place were starting to shoot green buds overhead. Draco sat opposite Harry at one of the wrought iron chess tables, his long legs stretched out in Harry’s jeans, his hands tucked in the pockets of a Muggle jacket, and a smirk on his face that made Harry worried for his queen.
“No problem,” said Draco, his air shifting, he’d seemingly decided to brush off whatever was bothering him. “I’ve just never heard the voice of a snake before, but I must have been able to understand it through your memory. You’re a Parselmouth.”
