Malfoy smiled at him, and again it was one of those soft smiles that made Harry feel warm. He wasn’t sure he’d managed to fool Malfoy that his visit was nothing extraordinary, but Malfoy didn’t push it.
“Yes! No!”
“I don’t blame you. Draco is very easy on the eyes. Every part of him is mouth-watering, believe me. I’ve seen him without those well-fitting clothes on during a game of strip poker and my god. I used to think his clothes left little to the imagination but it was so much better than anything my imagination could conjure up. His legs seem to go on forever and his abs look like they were sculpted by the gods. His strong arms would be perfect for pinning you down whilst he fucked you and his cock-”
After the frankly weird conversation with Felicity, Harry tried to throw himself back into his work. If he didn’t do well tonight there was a chance the manager wouldn’t want him back for main holidays and that was something Harry couldn’t afford to lose. Yet he felt Malfoy’s presence buzzing around him and caught the flash of his blonde hair every so often which made truly matching his usual standards impossible.
She nodded. “Draco told us about his school. Said they taught very unique topics rather than normal things. Is it true you studied ancient runes and never studied maths? Or is Draco playing some elaborate prank? Because if it’s true I’m pretty sure what your school did is illegal.”
Bruce looked at him like he was stupid, “Er, food?”
what they’d been whispering about. He had a horrible feeling it would be embarrassing for Harry.
“This isn’t funny!” Hermione said. “This is people’s livelihoods! People depend on their jobs to feed their families and for some people losing one day of work is the equivalent of losing a meal for the day, the only thing standing between them and destitution. And the wizarding world relies on the Ministry to function. Without the auror department active, crime will increase and criminals might get away if it’s true the courts are off limits.”
“But other people did just as much as I did! I don’t deserve all the credit for ending the war! I had no choice!”
“I already know him though,” Harry pointed out, “I’ve known him since I was eleven. I’ve literally met his parents and been to his house.” Well, had altercations with his parents and been held prisoner at his house, but it was the same thing technically.
“No. They’d never do that.” Harry said hurriedly, before Malfoy could start lecturing him on betrayals and the bonds of friendship. “The night was winding down anyway and we decided that if we split up, the less chance they had of finding me and causing a full blown stampede that would end up with multiple people taking a trip to St. Mungo’s. A tactical retreat.”
He stared. He knew he was staring but he couldn’t quite understand what he was seeing. It was such a strange image and one that his mind couldn’t have conjured up alone, he wasn’t imaginative enough. There was one prominent question screaming at him though:
“Er,” Malfoy said, looking between Harry and the group. “That’s nice?”
Overly personal. It creeped Harry out but he was a bartender, he’d heard stranger and way more tasteless questions aimed at him and had people share details about their life he didn’t want or need to know.
“They scattered,” Harry explained, taking another sip of his drink.
Malfoy’s face lit up and Harry resolved to put that look on his face more often.
For what felt like the millionth time that day, Harry wasn’t sure what to say. It went deeper than Malfoy wanting to be the only one who could break Harry, despite his last sentence making it sound that way. What Malfoy had described, it was eerily close to what Harry himself felt: this strange, undeniable but completely irrational attraction to Malfoy, a connection that was different to all his other relationships and that he couldn’t quite define. Possessive, yes, obsessive, yes, and the thought of anyone hurting Malfoy definitely made Harry feel uneasy. There was also a sort of…dare he say,
careful. She could mention the name of the school without indicating it was magic. Was she trying to be funny? Make a joke with the bartender to lure him in to agreeing to whatever she wanted him to do?
“The feeling is entirely mutual,” Harry responded carefully, making sure to keep his tone even.
“Or owl me,” Malfoy continued. “My friends are used to owls popping in and out. They won’t mind.”
“What?” Hermione said, snatching the paper out of Ron’s hands and skimming the page. Ron gave a mumbled protest before diving back into his scrambled eggs. Harry saw him grimace but soldier on, used to Hermione’s culinary skills by now. “This is awful! How are we supposed to get to work! We’re going to be late.”
“No, not this time,” Harry said conversationally, peeking his head round the wall very quickly to see if the crowd had eased off. It hadn’t, there was still a swarm of cheering, shouting, occasionally crying manic witches and wizards surging through the main street of Hogsmeade, congregating outside The Three Broomsticks and The Hog’s Head
“You’re telling me things I already know, Mike.”
, the little pub Harry worked at. Normally they’d have a few regulars who appeared every other night (if not all nights), a tonne of business people on Friday afternoons, and families out for dinner on Sunday nights but nothing to this magnitude and not a clientele this eclectic. Young people, old people, single people, couples, groups of friends,
Harry gave him a two-fingered salute before moving on to the next customer.
He strolled along the street, looking for a familiar door. He hadn’t been paying much attention when he’d fled to the shop the first time, and that had been two years ago now, so he didn’t even know what the shop was called or what it sold. It was just pure chance Malfoy had been in that particular one: chance, destiny or his Malfoy radar drawing him there.
Suddenly his eyes snapped to Harry’s. “Did you know,” Malfoy said. “That the entirety of Slytherin knew about my little dementor stunt in Third Year. I openly plotted and bragged about it in the common room for weeks beforehand. Nobody said anything.”
Harry grimaced. He’d seen the headline in
“Do you think Henry VIII knew Jack the Ripper?”
Harry kept pushing drinks to whoever needed or wanted them, occasionally contributing to the discussions himself. After another half an hour, punters started pouring out into their little beer garden as the pub filled to capacity and the room became too warm with the body heat. Harry relaxed a little as it happened because it left some space in the room for everyone to move. The uninterrupted surge of people that had been coming in since around seven o’ clock also slowed, either because everyone who would be out tonight was already out or because they’d realised there was no room in this pub so went somewhere else. Harry didn’t care what the reason was. He finally had time to clean the spillages off the bar and concentrate on the customers in front of him.
something weird was going on!” Malfoy said vehemently, shaking his head. “But Vince and Greg didn’t mention anything when they returned, and it would’ve been impolite to broach it.”
Harry let his gaze flicker quickly over the rest of the table before looking at Malfoy questioningly. Malfoy shrugged and nodded sheepishly with a grimace but turned back to his friends when one of the men tapped him on the shoulder.
and Harry blinked at the headline he saw there.
Malfoy reached over to pick up a napkin from a dispenser and snatched the pen out of Harry’s shirt pocket.
“Hey, Terrence!” Harry briefly flicked his eyes to the side to see Seb and gang motioning Terry over.
Mike frowned trying to recall what Malfoy had obviously told him. “Snake, lion, eagle and…”
Malfoy didn’t seem to be on the same wavelength. “Thanks, Potter,” he said cheerily, grabbing his drinks before turning and weaving his way expertly through the crowd as he made his way back to his table.
Malfoy shrugged, “I don’t know. Perhaps if your
“Hey, in my defence, you were acting secretive so following you was the only option!” Harry said indignantly, drawing himself up and pointing a finger at Malfoy. Malfoy raised a sceptical eyebrow and Harry deflated. “Okay, no, you weren’t. You were being you, proclaiming yourself superior and calling Hermione names and issuing threats. But there was a giant fucking snake slithering around petrifying people you openly despised, you were a Slytherin, and I didn’t like you. You were the logical culprit.” Harry paused and carried on apologetically. “Obviously, it wasn’t you. It was Ginny…or Ginny possessed by a 16-year-old Voldemort, but shockingly my mind didn’t jump to that conclusion.”
“You didn’t get on?”
Harry took a moment to process that, wondering when Malfoy became so wise and aware. Was it a recent thing, something that happened after the war, or had he always been like this and Harry was just too blind and too consumed by his negative opinion of the boy he was to see it?
“You’ve gone quiet, Potter. Did I overshare?”
Malfoy was leaning casually against one of the clogged up floos that had feathers spilling out of it, watching the chaos in front of him with his arms crossed and an obvious smirk plastered across his face.
She laughed loudly and openly before smiling softly at him.
“My phone number,” Malfoy said as Harry took it wordlessly, looking down at it with amazement. “You have a phone, right?”
“Right,” Seb said, “It’s just we’ve been trying to ask you a question for the last few minutes and you looked like you were on another planet.”
“For God’s sake, Gerald!”
unforgivable. In fact, Ron would probably have joined in.”
Harry glanced up and met Malfoy’s eyes. “Why did you do this for me?” Harry gestured to the newspaper still lying on the counter between them. “We’re not friends, we never were. Why take this risk? You could be
Harry’s heart dropped. He could see where this was going. “Er, no.”
Terry hurried over with a smile.
She smirked, “So you never spied on him in the showers after football matches?”
Malfoy was sitting behind the counter, his eyes glued to a dusty old yellow book. At the jingle of the bell, he glanced up and, to Harry’s absolute shock, smiled softly at Harry.
Malfoy waved his hand dismissively and wouldn’t meet Harry’s eyes, “It would explain some of the things they’ve been saying tonight. That’s all.”
Malfoy was quiet for a moment. “Even if I didn’t owe you for saving my life and keeping me and my mother out of Azkaban, I don’t think it’s fair what they’re doing to you. I made a promise to myself after the war that if I saw injustice then I would speak up, so the same thing didn’t happen again, and you should be allowed some peace and quiet after the crap you’ve been through.” Before Harry could interject and say Malfoy didn’t owe him anything, Malfoy was continuing. “Besides, I suppose I feel…close to you? Like you said, at school we interacted with each other the most out of classes. You were a daily annoyance in my life, always there, and I was always aware of you. I guess spending so much time around you, knowing you, it made me a little…possessive. Seeing other people upset you makes me uncomfortable.” He took a slow breath. “You’re
Yeah, they really didn't know him.
Mike perked up immediately. “Hit me with it.”
of him.
As if sensing Harry’s attention, Photo-Malfoy turned to face the camera and winked.
there; something that made him smile at Malfoy’s jokes, even if they were insulting Harry, a reluctant appreciation for his skill, and a comfortable camaraderie between them. Being with Malfoy was like pulling on an old, warm jumper after years of forgetting it existed.
Seb’s group hadn’t moved since he’d left and he grinned at them.
Harry took a deep breath. He knew he shouldn’t be talking about a painful breakup with an ex to someone he was trying to impress and was attracted to, but Malfoy was surprisingly easy to talk to and he had asked. “We were at the Harpies practice grounds. Ginny was reserve seeker then and I used to watch her training sessions simply because I loved watching her fly. When they finished up and she landed, she looked so alive and happy and excited and she filled me with so much joy, that I knew it was the right time.” He sighed, “So I waited until she was alone, brought out the ring I’d had on me for over a year, and asked her to marry me.”
“Sure thing, boss. If you wanna come over here, sir, I’ll sort you out.”
Harry shifted in his seat and resisted the urge to wring his hands awkwardly. “I, er, broke into the Slytherin common room once. In Second Year.”
“No…” Harry tried. “At least not the main one, not like it was with Gryffindor and Hufflepuff.”
This took longer than expected. At this rate it'll be Christmas before this is finished.
After a brief moment of hesitation, Harry strode wordlessly forward and flung the newspaper on the counter, raising his eyebrows.
You don’t need to do that.” Harry said, exasperated.
“Not in public,” Malfoy said. “That’s dangerous from a political standpoint. Ambition
“Yes, and poor, innocent blonde wizards are their prey! I still have the scars!” Malfoy yanked up his sleeve and thrust it in Harry’s face.
the reporters who were on his heels and had been stalking him and screaming questions since about five minutes after he’d apparated outside The Leaky Cauldron, he was just a fast walker. Honestly, he’d be impressed with the Rita Skeeter wannabes’ speed and persistence if he wasn’t so frustrated and fuming at the deliberate disregard of his wishes. Despite his constant ‘no comment’s and pleas for them to leave him alone, he still couldn’t visit George at his shop or withdraw some galleons from Gringott’s without it being front page news the next day, and he had to answer the same stupid questions again and again and again.
Harry cleared his throat. “Sorry, guys. Just seen someone I knew from school is all. Bit embarrassing.”
Harry’s shoulders sagged in relief, “Shoot.”
“You did not,” Harry shot back, refusing to admit it even though they both knew it was true. “I was just
Malfoy smiled sheepishly, “It was part of my probation to go out into the muggle world and interact with them. I think the aim was to broaden my understanding and cultural awareness so I didn’t continue to think all muggles were useless, but by that point I didn’t think that anyway. They ended up placing me in a block of flats close to a university where I met those jokers.” He jerked a thumb behind him at the group who all waved when they saw Harry looking. “When they saw how hopeless I was at everything they kind of adopted me. Showed me everything I needed to know, judging me loads but doing it anyway. After my probation was over I didn’t want to leave them, so I moved in.”
“What can I get you?” He said, pulling out five glasses from under the bar.
She frowned and ran her eyes up and down his body in a way that was invasive. “Scruffy black hair, killer green eyes,” she grabbed the olive from her drink and ate it before poking his bicep with the stick, “muscles hidden under hideous clothes. Were there multiple Harrys meeting your description at school?”
“Why?”
Harry didn’t mention people were already doing that. Even Malfoy had bought him the hot chocolate. “But I don’t want them too act like this!” He waved a hand in the general direction of the crowd. “This shit happens every year at every event. I’ve tried everything. You know last year I actually threw my birthday party a week early, but they still gate-crashed that
Harry barked out a surprised laugh. “
It had been a fairly regular thing when they were younger, but Malfoy had really stepped up his game this time. He hadn’t spoken a single word to Harry and Harry still wanted to punch him for the turmoil he was causing in him.
Malfoy mock gasped, “You
“I know,” Harry grinned, “To be honest they mostly seemed to be trying to wheedle information out of me. Mostly about my sex life. If I was seeing anyone. If I was available. If I was into men or women.”
Amazing, loud and chaotic.
“Of course that would be your response,” Harry said, exasperated and weirdly fond. “I thought you were petrifying everyone and your first reaction is ‘I am just that amazing’.”
There was a soft chime from the back room and Malfoy turned to look towards it. He snapped his head back to Harry and started to rise.
The way he was eyeing him up suggested Malfoy was more than a little open minded.
saw Malfoy talking to thin air they could find Harry. He didn’t, but only because he thought it’d look suspicious to anyone watching them, and the papers already had enough to gossip about without seeing Harry Potter pulling Draco Malfoy into a small, shadowed alley. He did not need
“Shit,” Harry said, backing away from the door with wide eyes and bumping into the counter.
They drifted into a comfortable silence and Harry took the time to look around at his surroundings. It was dark but not Borgin and Burke’s dark. It was an odd little place, full of potion ingredients and items that seemed normal but Harry had no doubt did something magical. It seemed like the sort of place a person would go too to look for something bizarre and specific.
“I don’t mind,” Harry said, shrugging.
“Well?”
that came about but Malfoy didn’t pause long enough for Harry to ask.
He’d always chickened out though, knowing he had no excuse to go there and that only going to see Malfoy was creepy.
“Where did you get all the pranks from? They weren’t all common items you could buy, especially not in bulk if you wanted to avoid suspicion.”
When Mike was out of earshot, Roger rested a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “You alright?”
“Those things have lethally sharp talons that can slice through human skin like a knife through butter! And their beaks! I saw that thing eat a ferret whole.”
Harry tried to recall the conversations he’d had and frowned, “No, why?”
“We were using Polyjuice potion to look like Crabbe and Goyle,” Harry explained. He briefly wondered if he should be revealing what they’d done back then to Malfoy; it was a long time ago and nobody would care that The Saviour had brewed a restricted potion when he was twelve, in fact they’d probably be impressed by it. However, there were some who would demand he be punished, that he couldn’t get away with something just because he was famous, or they would use it to assassinate his character. Plus, Malfoy might be offended by it and stop talking to him, and Harry didn’t want that. He didn’t think Malfoy would though, the curiosity in his eyes confirming that. Malfoy had always been as interested in Harry as Harry was with him. He sighed and shrugged sheepishly. “We jumped them on the way back from dinner, stuck them in a broom cupboard, then wandered the dungeons until you found us. We must’ve looked like idiots, stumbling around like lost lambs, Ron arguing with his older brother dressed like Crabbe and me forgetting to take my glasses off.”
Mike approached the bar slowly, as if approaching a startled animal that was trapped. When he reached him, Harry regarded him suspiciously.
Harry chuckled and went about concocting the order and as he was pouring, he watched Malfoy out of the corner of his eye.
There was the sound of a bar stool scraping against the old wooden floor and Harry heard a flurry of movement in front of him as someone hopped up onto it. Harry's eyes widened and he bolted upright to find Malfoy sat there looking at him with one eyebrow raised in amusement. His eyes darted to Harry’s cheek where his hair was glued to his skin by whatever nasty stuff had congealed on the bar. Embarrassed, Harry pulled his sleeve down and rubbed the sticky gunk off his face, feeling his cheeks heat up and grimacing as he did. Another thing Malfoy had been the best at in school was catching Harry in embarrassing situations, and it seemed he still had that ability.
“Sorry,” Harry said, still chuckling and his cheeks aching from how much he was smiling. He held up the newspaper. “Can I keep this?”
around
“Any date at all?”
No matter how bloody fit the prick looked.
Did Harry want to explore it?
“He’s single.”
Harry smiled, watching as the lamplight flickered over Malfoy’s face when he leaned back slightly and finding a smile there to match his own. He should probably drag Malfoy further into the alley if they were going to continue talking, which Harry found he wanted to do, because if one of his
“Everyone else was paired off,” Harry said, shrugging. “They were heading home so stuck with their spouses.”
Malfoy looked at him strangely. “Potter, if you tell me your reputation wasn’t earned and you don’t deserve the odd concession for saving our arses, I will throw this jar of what I’m pretty sure is pickled sheep’s brain at your head.” Malfoy held up a jar of floating chunks of who-knows-what pointedly, eyeing it with disgust. “If anyone deserves some peace and recognition, it’s you.”
“I haven’t!”
“Anyway, what was it you were trying to ask me?” He said, trying to divert the conversation back to something safer.
Potter, and if anyone is going to ruin your birthday it’s going to be me.”
Harry grinned and waited until the door slammed shut, cameras flashing and Malfoy’s voice calling everyone to silence, before he snuck out the back.
He poured it out and considered how to broach the topic he wanted to know about without being obvious.
“How’d you all meet?”
The woman was watching him carefully when he returned his attention to her, having observed his silent conversation with Malfoy. There was something in her expression that worried Harry. It was the same look Hermione sported when she’d latched on to an idea and was determined to see it through.
“Well, guess we get the day off, then.”
“Perception, Potter, is often key,” Malfoy said. Harry wasn’t entirely sure what he meant, but he had to agree his own perception of Malfoy and his friends had just changed. “Slytherins may not have loyalty as their key trait, attributed to them by a talking hat, but that doesn’t mean that we are
“What?”
It came as a complete surprise. The guy looked nerdy and bookish with a light blue cardigan on, curly brunette hair and warm brown eyes hidden behind glasses only slightly more stylish than Harry’s were. He greeted Harry with a soft smile that showed off his dimples. He looked like the sort of person who would be hunkered down in a library studying engineering rather than a guy hanging out with social drinkers who had no sense of personal boundaries.
his greatest enemy, said.”
“Same.”
When he looked back, Malfoy was gone.
Malfoy’s voice went quiet and the tone was that of someone admitting a secret. Harry subconsciously leaned closer. “Besides, I don’t want to get by on my family name and reputation anymore, not that there’s much left of it. This way I’m earning what I have for myself.” He smiled and Harry stared at the honest expression there. “It’s a wonderful feeling.”
Malfoy bowed his head, “Sometimes I
Harry glared at them, “I will cut you off if you keep talking about this.”
No. No way. He wouldn’t. This couldn’t have been what Malfoy’s cryptic statement meant.
By his calculations, Malfoy was the next member of their group to buy the round. Harry wouldn’t have to wait too long until the man was in front of him and he didn’t know whether he was dreading it or was worryingly excited.
“So…” he started slowly, “Muggles.” Malfoy nodded. “How did that happen?”
It didn’t matter. He could tell she didn’t believe him.
Harry had known Malfoy, and known him probably better than most other people with the amount of time he spent obsessing over him, but he didn’t
They stared at each other for a moment, the intensity of Malfoy’s gaze making Harry slightly breathless and pulling him in. The excited chatter and drunken yells around him became muted and the world seemed to drop away. Instinctively, Harry leaned forward so he was closer to Malfoy and parted his lips.
When he glanced back at Malfoy, he was back to laughing with his friends although it didn’t look as relaxed as it had before.
“Always,” he answered, putting the glass he was no longer pretending to clean down and resting his weight on his arms, his face close enough to Malfoy’s that he could see the way his eyelashes fluttered when he blinked.
“You mean loyalty is not a quality stereotypical of Slytherin house?”
Harry was genuinely curious what it’d been like for Malfoy. When Harry had first entered the Wizarding World, he’d been amazed and awestruck and couldn’t quite believe what he was seeing. He had no words to describe the feeling he’d had when he first saw magic, nor his first trip to Diagon Alley, it was such an overwhelming experience; it was different to everything he knew and added more meaning to his life, but it’d been a learning curve. He was entering a new world where the words were different, the lifestyle was different, the history was different, the animals and people and sports were all different. He’d had to learn everything from scratch and all these years later he was still discovering new things about the world he now called home. He wondered if that was what it’d been like for Malfoy – that he’d entered a whole new world and had no idea what he was doing but was blown away by it all anyway.
“Hi, I’m Bruce.”
“He did it too!”
“And,” Malfoy continued. “The moment Umbridge gave one of her ‘special detentions’ to a Slytherin – a Second Year who she’d caught snogging her boyfriend in Myrtle’s Bathroom -, we started spiking her drink with whatever Weasley products we could find, hit her with more
Harry didn’t know what to feel about that. Part of him was offended at the fashion assassination as he knew his clothes were way better than they were in school (they fit for a start) but the main part was screaming
Harry Potter agreed with something
Because they weren’t wizards.
Harry chuckled. “Not only that, Draco Malfoy just forced the Ministry of Magic to shut down for me. Pretty sure if anyone said that to teenage me he’d laugh in their face before having them committed to St Mungo’s for suggesting it.”
He stopped at a black door half-way down the street just around the first bend. It was approximately the right distance from the main alley and it had a very Malfoy vibe to it: dark colours, silver detailing, and traditional architecture. The difference, and only thing that made Harry doubt himself, was Malfoy was always neat and put-together, surrounding himself with expensive items and posh people, whereas this shop looked run-down and like the only thing keeping the structure from collapsing in on itself was magic. What really gave it away as the right place, though, was the floating sheep brains in the window display. Harry really hoped they weren’t the same ones from two years ago.
curse, and ironically the brother of the man I helped kill is more forgiving than Madame Rosmerta.”
“So you don’t want to?” Malfoy asked.
As he was passing the living room the floo flared to life.
“They abandoned you?” Malfoy said, aghast. Harry didn’t know whether he should be annoyed Malfoy thought so little of Harry’s friends or pleased that he sounded so offended on Harry’s behalf.
Harry looked up automatically at his name to see Ron and Hermione gawping at him. They looked shocked, which was understandable as their best friend had just suddenly burst out into hysterical laughter without there seeming to be a trigger or reason for it. He wouldn’t blame them if they sent him to the spell damage ward for delayed war-related injuries.
Malfoy was quiet for a long moment; if he wasn’t standing so close that Harry could hear his breathing and see the flecks of blue in his eyes, he might’ve thought Malfoy had left.
They sipped their drinks in silence for a moment before Malfoy nodded behind Harry, “Reporters again?”
She grabbed her tray of drinks and walked away before Harry could say anything.
“Why are you by yourself? Wouldn’t it be better if the Mighty Chosen One had a bodyguard?”
Now Malfoy was watching him.
charms and jinxes than was probably good for her health, and eased off on the whole monitoring and punishing thing, gradually dismantling her reign of terror from within? Towards the end we spent our shifts lounging in the common room or occasionally plotting with Peeves if we could get him to stay still long enough.”
Harry eyed it curiously. “…Where?”
“Ah, no, just me. Can’t believe he brought me up in conversation,” he grimaced, “I’m guessing none of it was positive. We weren’t exactly friends.”
Mike hummed, “And all that tension that built up being on opposing sides. Probably turned sexual at some point. Did you ever release it? Did you have hate-sex in the showers?”
Draco planted his hands on the bar and lifted himself up off the barstool and forwards a little. Harry’s breath caught in his throat and he didn’t dare look away as Draco leaned in close to him and gently pecked Harry on the lips.
Harry stared some more and Malfoy sighed.
“You alright, Harry?”
“The hot blonde already came up to get drinks. You missed it, buddy.”
“Do you get many couples in here, Harry?”
Harry stared at him, not sure whether to be intrigued or horrified. “Why would you be naked?”
Malfoy dragged himself out of whatever rabbit hole his thoughts had fallen into and scanned the area before focusing on Harry again.
Harry couldn’t suppress the little smile that graced his lips. He was oddly proud of Malfoy and extremely impressed. It couldn’t have been easy doing what he’d done, going out and acclimatising as well as he had to muggle life when he’d spent his childhood being raised to reject anything related to it. When Harry had been introduced to the Wizarding World, he’d at least had people there constantly to explain things to him and there were other kids coming from non-magical backgrounds who were as confused as he was, but Malfoy had nobody. Nobody to tell him how toasters worked, nobody to explain the currency, and nobody who could understand what he was going through, but he’d still come out on top. He’d done all that even with people doubting he could do it, and based on their conversation so far Harry was willing to bet he’d become a better person because of it.
of my feelings.” It was Ron’s time to sigh. “Well, there’s one good thing to come out of this.”
Malfoy seemed to read that in his face. “Oh, don’t worry, Potter. They’re not gonna want to start their smuggling ring up again anytime soon. I made sure they were properly traumatised and also sent an anonymous tip to the DRCMC, so they’re all on a watchlist.” Harry relaxed.
thing he’s working. If he wasn’t, where would we get the sweet nectar of the gods?”
“Nope. Just me and Pepper. My owl,” Harry clarified at Malfoy’s inquiring look. “You? Do you all live together?”
this much.
Malfoy’s eyes widened as the implications of that sunk in, “But you’re not married,” he paused, “She said no?”
Harry grinned. “Guilty.”
The group were still at the same table in the same seats and laughing uproariously at something Bruce had said. He frowned as he noticed all of them had semi-full glasses rather than the nearly empty ones they’d had when he left.
Harry’s head shot up to find Draco Malfoy watching him with amusement and a little surprise.
“Um, I don’t think so? There’s no way Malfoy mentioned me.”
Malfoy bit his lip as he seemed to have an internal debate with himself, and Harry’s eyes were immediately drawn down to them. Suddenly, he had the overwhelming urge to replace Malfoy’s teeth with his own and wet his lips.
Malfoy shrugged, “They thought I’d been raised in some sort of cult that was closed off from the outside world and didn’t interact with normal people, which…isn’t far from the truth really.”
reporters myself.”
“Harry! Harry! How does it feel to be another year older?”
Mike was the worst.
How did it feel to be a year older? The same as always and no different, as any person on the planet would say when asked. Is it more joyful now people are recovered from the war? No, because they hadn’t recovered and people they loved were fucking dead, gone for good. Was duelling in a controlled, monitored environment under the watchful eyes of experienced law enforcement personnel the same as being 17 years old fighting a homicidal, sadistic lunatic with an army and the intent of murdering you and taking over the world? Yes, of course it fucking was. How was his relationship? It was just dandy, and even if it wasn’t, every couple had obstacles they needed to overcome and oh, yeah, it was none of their damn business.
“What can I get you to drink, Bruce?”
in a unnecessarily gleeful tone.
“Yup. Say what you want about her but she can strike fear into even the most heartless journalist with her arsenal of curses and knowledge.”
Harry dragged his eyes away before he got caught looking.
“It’d take more than that to damage my huge ego, Potter.” Malfoy said it in a way that almost sounded like an innuendo, but Harry couldn’t for the life of him work out what it was.
Harry watched him go with his mouth open, words on the tip of his tongue to call Malfoy back, and a rising sense of disappointment forming in his chest. He’d had all these things he’d wanted to say to the blonde, been fretting about it all night, and had planned most of them out but instead of exploring what could have been he was left staring at Malfoy’s back as he walked away with no more answers than he had before.
The truth was he’d volunteered to work New Year’s Eve. The other bartenders thought he was crazy to
“It’s too bad you had to work tonight, Harry Barry,” another regular, Gerald, slurred, letting Harry know he was only a few pints away from unconsciousness. “You could be out getting hammered and…enjoying some female company, if you get my drift.”
Harry opened his mouth and closed it again.
“Felicity said Malfoy mentioned me. What did he say?”
“Stalking me, are you, Malfoy?” Harry said humorously.
“Or,” Malfoy said, and his voice wasn’t soft anymore. He sounded like he was choking back emotions, his voice rising in volume with his frustrations and determination to prove his point and, Harry quickly realised, the surge of painful memories. “That every single Slytherin from our year and the year below turned up to Vince’s funeral, even after he treated everyone like shit that last year? That, when Theo was left orphaned after his father was killed in the battle and his mother fled to the continent without him, Blaise took him to his house to live with him and his mother, who practically adopted Theo as a second son? That my mother spent
“Harry!” Hermione said.
Mostly professionally anyway. He resolved that if they were going to interrogate him, he’d turn the tables and interrogate them. He wanted information too, after all, and who better to reveal secrets about Malfoy than his probably tipsy drinking buddies? Maybe they could answer some of the questions that were buzzing through his brain and keeping him distracted.
Gerald was shaking his head, “No, no, no, no, Seb. It’s a
Malfoy rubbed his chin thoughtfully, “The hardest part was the Hippogriff feathers. They’re not really monitored but they’re also not used in too many common potions so apothecaries don’t stock them. If you want them, you have to get them from the source. Millie didn’t have any Hippogriffs in her sanctuary so I had to go into the wild.” He shivered and glared at Harry. “I hope you know what hell I had to go through for you, Potter. Luckily, I had a year, so I could visit herds and pick up their discarded feathers rather than corner one and pluck it.” He shivered again and there was a vague look of horror in his eyes.
Yeah, Harry loved his job.
In terms of the blonde himself, Harry had decided that when Malfoy came up to the bar to buy his round, he’d acknowledge him and make likely awkward small talk instead of straight up ignoring him as his original plan had been. There was no point being rude or bearing a grudge, it’d been years since they’d fought and they’d been children at the time. Hell, it’d been years since Harry had even
But it was easy to slip into this role with Malfoy, the one where they parried back and forth, trading sarcastic comments and insults that had no heat to them anymore and did no damage. It was comfortable, like stripping out your work robes at the end of the day into your pyjamas and snuggling in an armchair with some hot chocolate and a blanket: familiar, simple, calming, and fun.
“Well, then, why would my friends out me?” Malfoy suddenly frowned. “And don’t you dare say ‘because you’re Slytherins.’ If I hear anything remotely similar come out your mouth I will whack you over the head with that splinter-stool.”
This round was the responsibility of one of the two women, specifically the one who’d originally outed Harry’s presence to Malfoy. She was pretty, he admitted reluctantly, with long legs exposed by her short black dress and a curvy figure. She also gave the impression that she was the sort of girl who’d knock your teeth out if you insulted her or her loved ones.
Malfoy flung out his arm to point at Harry dramatically, his finger centimetres from Harry’s face.
“The dung bombs, well, Weasley – the fun one - doesn’t mind bulk buying from his shop and was glad of both the business and the implications of a massive chaos-causing prank happening.”
“Malfoy, you got bested by a bloody Hippogriff.”
But then Gerald continued. “That Harry wanted to have hate-sex with you and spied on you in the shower at school. That he wanted to lick chocolate sauce off your naked body. That he had fantasies about you pinning him down and fucking him. That he was interested in you. That he wanted to kiss you when the clock struck midnight.”
Harry, made him feel oddly honoured and more than a little pleased.
Harry didn’t like the way Terry was looking at him; like Harry was obsessed and a bit crazy.
One of the women Malfoy was with turned to look towards the bar, likely to see if it was quiet enough to order drinks, and caught Harry staring with his mouth agape. She followed his line of sight and Harry saw her smirk as she deduced he was staring at Malfoy. She obviously jumped to the wrong conclusion and assumed he was lusting after her friend. She flicked her eyes back at Harry once before leaning forwards and nudging Malfoy on the arm, jerking her head in the direction of the bar and mumbling something to him.
“Oh, yeah, I’m feeling fine now. Just a little dizzy spell, nothing I can’t shake off.”
For his part, Harry was trying to push down the images that Malfoy’s throwaway comment about ‘more intimate contexts’ and mentioning Harry in the same sentence brought to mind.
“Yo, mate, you finished with the cherries?”
It wasn’t the sneer or smirk Harry was accustomed to; it was soft and sweet and even a little nervous. Harry would go as far as to say it made Malfoy look
“Thanks.” Harry pushed his chair back and stood up, glancing down at the paper again and grinning. “I’ll see you later.”
Malfoy shook his head, “All they said was that you two had amicably decided to split up as you both had different wants in life.” He paused before raising his eyebrows knowingly, “It was strangely innocuous and brief for a
Malfoy raised his eyebrows, “Would Weasley and Granger report you?”
“I would never!” Harry said. For one thing, they weren’t allowed to give out free booze due to a previous incident with a staff member giving away hundreds of pounds of product for free to girls he wanted to seduce. If that wasn’t the case he’d probably try it. “I’m simply letting you know you are a beautiful young woman. Frankly, I’m offended you’d think so low of me as to assume I’m manipulating you. I would never do that. And I-”
Malfoy had enough money that he’d never have to work a day in his life. Harry had made sure that when they went to trial the Malfoys didn’t have to surrender their vaults like many other Death Eater families. He thought they’d learned their lesson about blood prejudice and suffered enough during the actual war, and didn’t deserve the rest of their lives to be difficult because of actions of desperation. And of course, there was the small matter of two of them saving his life. They’d been given fines, with the intention of it being compensation for those they’d hurt, but it turned out that hadn’t been too many people - at least none that could be proved. Lucius had been in Azkaban for a year, then had the humiliation of being wandless, so he could barely do anything let alone destroy villages and massacre people. Narcissa had never been a Death Eater and Draco had been such a crap one he’d not been made to do all too much - apparently he was boring to watch. A couple of torture victims - most of whom Draco had been responsible for - had been well compensated and the Malfoys had kept most of their money.
“Excuse me one moment, I just need to check on that potion. I’ll be back.”
“My turn.”
Harry gaped at them. “How do you even know that?”
“For the record,” Mike said, “I think you’d make a beautiful couple.”
“Seven!”
“Harry! Tell us about your relationship with Ginevra Weasley! Has it been difficult with her still being in school? Are the reports of trouble in paradise true?”
Harry felt like an idiot. He’d seen Parkinson that day strutting around the department, flirting with various aurors in her tight-fitting clothes, but had just rolled his eyes and gone back to his own case. He hadn’t thought anything of it, but he was supposed to be a highly-trained auror with perfect observation skills so he should’ve.
“So that’s how you managed to do it with no witnesses,” Harry said. “As easy as that.”
“Because it’s a depressing and unhygienic cesspool of a pub where criminals frequent and the butterbeer tastes like Filch’s armpit sweat and a cupboard full of expired potion’s ingredients mixed together?”
Meeting Malfoy hadn’t lessened his curiosity. It’d only made it stronger.
“He also mentioned you had spectacular eyes and ‘stupid messy hair that he wanted to touch.’ I can see what he meant. My god that’s a bird’s nest, isn’t it.”
“Do you live nearby then?”
It appeared Bruce didn’t believe in beating around the bush nor did he have any sort of knowledge of social norms. People didn’t just ask someone they met four seconds ago about their romantic life.
has been reminding everyone it was coming up since Christmas.”
Malfoy flicked his eyes down to it quickly and back to Harry. “Oh my,” he said, looking directly into Harry’s eyes. “What deranged individual would do something like this?”
predators-”
Harry nodded, “I just kept running until I couldn’t run anymore. I didn’t know where I was going, had no idea where I was, had no plan on a route. I took random turns and went down dark alleys, until I ran out of steam.” He pointed to the door, “I stopped just outside the door there, my eyes stung from crying, soaked through because of the rain, and freezing. I came in here and the atmosphere…it didn’t make everything better, not by a long shot, but the staff and patrons saw the state I was in, brought me in from outside, and kept me warm. And the best bit was they had no ulterior motive. Nobody knew who I was. I could breakdown and receive sympathy rather than judgement. Roger let me stay in the upstairs rooms until I was ready to go. I tried to after a week, but the moment I stepped into Diagon Alley I was ambushed. Ginny had started seeing the Magpies’ chaser and hadn’t cared about keeping it discrete. The anonymity I had at the pub called to me and so I came back. Roger offered me a job, and I moved into a flat a couple of streets away. I don’t think I’ve ever felt freer.”
“And what was the answer?”
“Hot chocolate with whipped cream and marshmallows, with just a hint of caramel drizzled on top.”
Harry strolled in, hoping his smile had dimmed enough to not look completely manic.
“Maybe four solid attempts?”
Harry stuck his head in the room and saw Auror Cassidy’s head floating there, searching for someone to talk too.
Malfoy smiled, “Yeah, you know the chippie on Donald Close?”
Harry nodded and mumbled something incoherent as Malfoy dashed around the counter and through a swing door camouflaged in the wall next to it. Harry started drawing patterns in the countertop as he waited for Malfoy to come back and he considered how to ask the one question that he’d been desperate to ask all morning.
“I will,” Harry said, “Two conversations with them both was enough to know it’s best to stay on their good side.”
“Harry! How is auror training going? Are you top of the class? Are you bottom? How does it compare to duelling with You-Know-Who?”
“What’s up, gentlemen?”
Gerald was nodding, “Yeah, he’s been trying to coax them into revealing information about you all night. Borderline stalking you if you ask me.”
Harry had a flashback of duelling in second year, when the words “Scared, Potter?” had left Malfoy’s mouth and sent a bolt of what he later realised to be desire shooting through him.
Harry licked his lips thoughtfully. There were so many questions he wanted answers to, he’d just added more as the night had gone on, and he had to pick carefully. This could be the only question he managed to get an honest answer to.
“What? The Chudley Canons are playing Saturday!”
“I have
Harry laughed again at Malfoy’s indignant expression and the way he drew himself up, a pout on his lips. “And why is that so funny?”
“Yeah. Felicity joked that maybe there was some sexual tension there. Draco’s exact words were ‘yeah, probably.’”
“Oh, yeah, all of Draco’s relationships have been a total car crash,” she told Harry without much prompting, slumped over the bar, “Like total write-off car crash, mass causalities car crash, often DOA car crash. Well, when he does date at least.”
“Oh, just kiss already!”
“If she’d simply said no I could’ve handled it,” Harry admitted before grimacing, “Well, no, I probably couldn’t have. It was the look on her face, the horror and embarrassment. Apparently, she was planning on talking to me about seeing other people and ending our relationship that weekend. She told me she’d been deliberately avoiding me for over a month hoping I would get the picture and bring it up myself, so whilst I thought she was busy with work and tried to arrange my day so I could spend time with her, she was partying and making plans so our schedules clashed and finding any excuse she could to not see me. She didn’t want to be with me anymore, she didn’t think we had enough in common, and she said she was disappointed with our relationship. That she felt like we were moving too fast and I was pressuring her to settle down when she wasn’t ready to and wanted to focus on her career. I think her image of me and the reality of me didn’t match up. I was heartbroken.” Harry shrugged, “So I ran.”
Malfoy raised his eyebrows, “Yeah? That’s why you ran off when Mike got his round?”
“Ex-boyfriend?”
be missing the lady-love!” Jason, a young banker who Harry knew had work tomorrow said. He flittered his eyes in Harry’s direction, “Or man-love. Whatever floats your boat.”
“It’s alright, I didn’t poison it,” Malfoy said. “I wouldn’t be so obvious. Poison in food and drink is easily detectable. If I wanted to kill you, I’d ambush you when you were chasing a suspect – hopefully through a crowd to avoid recognition – and hit you with an untraceable dark curse. Much quicker. You are wise to be wary though.”
Harry put his hand over his heart, “Proud lion.”
Hermione frowned and threw the paper at him. “Doubt it.”
Harry didn’t answer. The answer was obvious.
Did Malfoy want to explore it?
“That’s one word for it.”
; enough to raise suspicion and the aurors to investigate.”
Eventually Malfoy nodded, a determined frown on his face. “Leave it with me, Potter. I’ll fix this.”
“It’s not mine. I have a perfectly good cup of tea here, thanks,” he said, raising his own paper cup before taking a sip.
There was only ever one question that mattered.
First up was one of the guys. Red hair, black blazer, startling blue eyes.
Malfoy blinked in surprise and stared at Harry for a moment, apparently dumbfounded. He shook his head as if to clear it and straightened up. “Of course, just never in that context before – usually it’s in more…intimate situations - and certainly never you.” Malfoy’s tone was a little dreamy, like he hadn’t expected Harry to say something so nice but it was everything he’d ever wanted.
of planning and probably a lot of money. Why?”
They didn’t awkwardly avoid each other in public anymore, though Harry wasn’t sure Malfoy had even noticed him those previous times. If they saw one another, they would nod or smile or occasionally, if one of them was feeling especially friendly, wave. Their conversations were sparse; probably the longest and most profound conversation they’d had was when Harry sidled up to Malfoy outside Quality Quidditch Supplies and talked about the features of the new Fireblaze Broomstick. It was difficult to talk about anything truly meaningful or revealing when they were both always with people, Harry with the Weasleys or Hermione or Ron – who always glared at Malfoy and muttered insults at him when they spotted him – and Malfoy with his parents or his friends from school. Every time Harry went to Diagon Alley his eyes were drawn to the little street he knew Malfoy’s shop was down, and more than once he’d considered just popping in to chat. Or, more likely, go in and pretend to buy something just so he could spy on Malfoy, which was his usual style.
The next time Felicity came up for her obligatory round he asked her.
It was hard to tell with the flames distorting her face and ash swirling around her, but the look on her face appeared to be less than amused. She was in a bad mood, and if she was supposed to be working this morning, Harry had a good idea about why – and because of who - that was.
“Thanks, Malfoy,” he said, meaning it and not just because for July the night was unusually cold. Malfoy had
Malfoy eyed Harry suspiciously, and
Roger, his manager, came running over. “Is everything okay?”
Harry‘s heart melted and warmth spread through his chest, and he found his own lips tugging up in response.
He couldn’t really believe he was considering Malfoy in this way. Harry would be lying if he said he’d never been attracted to him – even as a teenager Harry could recognise Malfoy was good-looking and imagined what it would be like to be intimate with him, even if that was only as a friend. Yet those had only been stray thoughts and absentminded acknowledgments, childish ponderings and, yes, the occasional lustful fantasy; he’d never once believed it would come to anything. He never thought he would be legitimately contemplating whether or not he wanted to pursue something romantically, that that was even an option, or that he would
“Do you work here?” Harry blurted.
Harry would have to ask George if he knew who he’d sold his dung bombs too and what they were going to be used for, and if he was officially in on it. He was the sort of person who would revel in the knowledge of what was to come and happily provide whatever was needed for mass destruction. Harry didn’t think George would out Malfoy though; in all likelihood after this George would only respect him.
Harry didn’t want to lie to Roger so he didn’t answer but that was enough.
“How far away is Glasgow from Scotland?”
“So you been in many relationships, Harry?”
Harry had a spring in his step as he returned to his normal spot behind the bar.
Mike’s lips twitched at the corners as if he wanted to smile but knew it wasn’t the right moment.
Malfoy tugged his sleeve back down again and glared at Harry. “Unbelievable,” he muttered. Then he waved his hand dismissively. “Anyway, keeping you alive should be a breeze. How hard can it be? If the Dark Lord didn’t manage to off you after years of trying I doubt a bunch of hysterical teenagers will manage it.” Malfoy took a peek around the wall. “Hysterical teenagers and what looks like one 90-year-old woman. Is that Longbottom’s Grandmother?”
Harry could understand everyone's perspective; it was the first of his birthdays after the war and they wanted to celebrate. Celebrate him, celebrate his victory, celebrate his life, celebrate that it was
“I may, or may not, occasionally use a Scorify to clean the bar,” Harry said, “And I may, or may not, occasionally use a jelly-legs jinx on aggressive patrons.”
Harry nodded along, focused entirely on her words, “So does he not date very often?”
Harry couldn’t help the squeak that came out of his mouth as his head snapped towards the group of men he’d been serving earlier, all of them trying to hurriedly shush a very intoxicated Gerald.
“George knows your feelings about the Canons. He wouldn’t do that,” Harry tried to assure him, but he didn’t really believe it himself. It was exactly the sort of thing George would do.
“Yours.”
“Harry! Is it true you and Dumbledore were lovers?”
“I did have some help,” Malfoy admitted. “Sneaking that amount of dung bombs into the auror department was virtually impossible because, unlike the minister’s office and The Department of Magical Games and Sports, there are still employees there overnight. Luckily for me, Pansy had a meeting with her probation officer and she likes wearing short skirts, so nobody really noticed her ‘accidentally’ leaving her shopping bags full of dung bombs in a few rooms.”
“How did you end up,” Malfoy waved his arms around in the air to gesture to the pub, “here.”
“No!”
“You’re welcome.”
Harry eyed the stool with horror before quickly grabbing a different one and, after Malfoy’s nod of acceptance, pulled it up to the counter and hopped onto it.
Draco flushes. Ah, Potter doesn’t like self-deprecation. He ought to have known, really. Potter is too much of a goody-goody to accept people talking down on themselves like that.
“It’s Harry,” Potter laughs, stepping closer. “You were really into that huh? Took you a moment there.”
Potter lets out a delighted laugh. “Well, as
Draco wakes to the morning sun streaming through his useless curtains and throwing bright spots across his face. He curses thoroughly but, as that does nothing to dissuade it, fumbles his way to a sitting position and opens his eyes to find himself fully clothed on his bed. He’s not under the covers either, so he assumes that he’d exhausted himself with heating charms the night prior and passed out without meaning to.
The temperature rises slightly, not enough that it’s warm but enough that he’s not freezing. Draco sighs, drained. Wandless magic is considered difficult at the best of times, and he’s trying to muddle through this with no guidance – the result has proven inconsistent and tiring.
Draco freezes – can he give Potter his own name? Will that break this anonymity he’s been granted? He’s not sure, and he doesn’t want to chance it.
“I’ll catch you yet,” he says playfully. Draco smirks and curls his finger at his chin as if in thought.
“Potter…what monstrosity is this?” he asks, looking at the concoction in front of him. Potter shrugs, sheepish.
Eventually, he needs to piss so he rolls out of bed and pads to the bathroom. He relieves himself quickly and returns to the main room, where he sits on the bed and draws back the curtain, just because he can. The street is busy, for Knockturn standards, and the sun is already high in the sky – it must be nearing noon.
The story has been on the wireless often in the past few months. The pair have been championing house-elf rights, or some such, and their case has now apparently been presented and the Wizengamot is in discussion. The witch reporting on the news briefly recaps Potter and Granger’s journey on this objective this far, and then Potter is brought on for an interview. His voice is rich and warm, and still sends shivers down Draco’s spine, as he talks about how he is confident that the Wizengamot will make the right decision.
Peering into the bag reveals the familiar shape of Muggle paper and coins, and a little card on which the goblins will have written a summary of the exchange. The goblins have yet to miscalculate the exchange, but Draco can’t find it in himself to trust anyone these days so he tugs out the little card and the money, counting to ensure that it’s correct.
Instead, those eyes go wide behind his glasses and an embarrassed flush of his own takes Potter’s face. He scrambles to his feet, stuttering out apologies as he reaches out a hand to Draco. Draco hesitates, but Potter doesn’t wait for his acceptance, seizing his wrist and pulling Draco off the ground with beguiling ease.
Potter moves closer still, taking the hat and scarf from the box.
“Potter,” he mutters. Potter looks up from where he’s crunching on a biscuit and tilts his head in question. Draco gestures at the Muggle. “They all take pictures of their ears. Is it a Muggle thing?”
“Hey Emory,” he says again, and it takes Draco another beat to remember the false name he’d given to the other man.
So she’s told him every time she’s seen him, although he has yet to learn what, exactly, his father had done to cause her predicament. He likely isn’t going to learn it this time either. “I’m sorry Mrs. Doxley,” is all he says, not wanting to antagonize her further. She leans close and spits at his face in response, and Draco doesn’t quite duck out of the way in time.
Then he rolls his eyes at himself. Wishing is for children, and all it could do is drive home how much he doesn’t have. Sighing, he pushes himself out of bed.
It’s tiny and cramped, with mismatched furniture, scrubbed wooden floors, and pale-yellow walls. It’s not fashionable at all, but it’s bright and warm and Draco likes it. A young witch is behind the counter, chatting with a wizened old man, and other than that the store is empty.
“Potter,” Draco sighs, shaking his head, “if you’re to be banished from stores on Granger’s account, surely you ought at least to know why?” Potter shrugs, unrepentant.
His own face burns with mortification and he casts around for something to say, but all that comes out is a useless squeak. “I just meant,” he finally manages. “Very good, Aurors. Doing great. Thanks for your service, and all that.” Merlin, what is he even saying? He doesn’t even like Aurors, they’re usually not very nice. He needs to get over this humiliating habit of just babbling nonsense when he’s embarrassed.
Hoping fervently that the sun brings with it some warmth, Draco leaves the bathroom and approaches his little kitchen corner. He looks at the stove critically – he is going skating later, which will use up energy, but he also ate yesterday. He waffles for a moment, drumming his fingers on his little folding table, but decides against it. He’s probably going to have to beg off early due to the cold anyhow. Food can wait for tomorrow.
Draco likes this shop. It’s warm, and nobody looks at him askance here so long as he actually buys something. Even the strange buzzing that always seemed to accompany Muggle lights and the humming from the iceboxes brings a strange comfort.
Potter shows up at one o-clock today, striding determinedly into the little alcove and then faltering when he sees Draco. He laughs. “Beat me to it huh?” He says. “Are you that eager to see me?” He waggles his eyebrows ridiculously, and Draco snorts.
“Brilliant!” He says eagerly, bouncing slightly on his heels like an overexcited kid. He gestures at Draco’s book. “Let’s get that checked out and we can go,” he says.
“Is this also in two years?” He asks. “Shall I make an appointment?”
The mail room is empty when he enters it. It’s a little room, barely large enough for two people to stand in, and luckily the owl is in. Draco retrieves a parchment form from the fourth bin – a Gringotts currency exchange form – and jots in his name and the amount of money requested. He folds it into an envelope with his coins; normally one would just fill in the form and have the money taken from their Gringotts account, but Draco no longer keeps one. Neither his job nor his housing is on record and are thus paid in Sickles and Galleons, of which he has little to spare. He probably can’t even afford the cost of maintaining an account.
He doesn’t even notice drifting off, but he finds himself waking sometime later, comfortable and warm enough that he almost falls back asleep. Then he sees Potter, sitting in his summoned armchair and watching him, and that startles him enough that he stops drowsing. “Creepy, Potter,” he mumbles, blinking and rubbing his eyes to clear the bleariness. “Do you make it a habit to watch people sleep?”
So, he swallows his anger and turns with a sigh to return to the chilly street. With the requirement to return by noon, there is no time to go to St. Mungo’s, and neither is there a guarantee that he’ll be seen there. That depends on who’s in front when he goes in, and which Healer he ends up with.
“You really do,” he mutters to himself. This is a terrible idea, but he can’t bring himself to pull away.
Draco shakes himself out of his memories and manages a wan smile. “Sure Potter, I’m fine,” he reassures him. Potter still looks dubious, so Draco decides to indulge him. He casts his mind back to before, back when he still had a happy home, when winter and Christmas were eagerly anticipated all year.
He doesn’t want to try casting windlessly again – he’s already tired from doing it once and casting tired is dangerous. Especially with a spell dealing with heat; the potential to start fires is high. It really is freezing, though, and no amount of bundling himself in whatever he has available is helping.
He frowns but takes the box and looks at it dubiously. Potter is practically bouncing on his heels now, so he takes it to a nearby bench and sits down, setting it on his lap so that he can undo the bow. With one final look at an eagerly grinning Potter, he lifts the lid and the thin paper layer that lays directly on top, and his breath catches.
Ugbert steps closer, moving around the counter so that he can see Draco fully. “Aww, you poor thing. Are you hurt?” He asks, reaching for Draco’s face.
“Potter, if your grand plan is to fall over and make me catch you so that you may grab me, rest assured that I will let you fall,” he warns. Potter blinks, and then breaks out into laughter.
There is no desire to curl up under his cover, either for warmth or for more sleep – his single blanket is too threadbare to offer any meaningful relief from the cold, and the two minutes of heat that his shower can manage is a much better option. Draco gets out of bed quickly and goes about his morning routine of a quick shower, his bath a race against the limited hot water. He gets out, dries off as quickly as he can before the water on his body freezes in he cold air of the apartment, and pulls on his baggy oversized clothes. He dresses fully, fingers shaking as he does up his ragged winter coat and slips on his holey gloves. Only once he’s dressed does he go back to brush his teeth, carefully avoiding getting anything on his clothes.
“Don’t go getting cocky Potter,” he warns over his shoulder.
, walk and laugh freely. There are no furtive glances here, no shady characters sneering at anyone who gave them too much attention. Vendors hawk in the streets, surrounded by powerful warming charms. The sound of laughter, chatter,
Ugbert chuckles. “I don’t think so,” he breathes right against Draco’s ear, grinding his hips forward. Draco feels his erection pressing against him and quivers. He quickly brings his hands up and turns his palms to Ugbert.
He picks out a slightly older but more advanced tome and returns to his armchair. This book is more concerned with theory than the last, and it goes into the differences that must be accounted for with different branches of magic. It’s incredibly tediously worded, but the concepts are fascinating, and Draco is more than happy to sink into it for a few hours.
Forsythe glares at him and snaps “Just go! How many times have I told you not to stick your pointy little nose into my store?”
“Harry!” It says urgently in Granger’s voice. Harry jerks to attention, startled.
Draco and Harry go ice-skating
“Oh…” he echoes quietly, his cheeks pinking again. Potter seems to have released some previously imperceptible tension, and he has a quiet confidence about him as he leans back in his seat and smiles at Draco. Draco returns the smile, then ducks his head to hide his blush and busies himself with his hot chocolate.
Finished with the ingredient prep, he tidies the work area, sweeps and mops the floors, and locks up the ingredient cases. As he’s finishing up, he hears the customer leave and Forsythe locking up behind him. He pokes his head into the front room and calls “I’ll be off then Mr. Forsythe!”.
He swallows, and forces himself to look away, back down at his book. Potter is quiet for a while, and Draco feels the weight of his gaze heavy upon his skin.
Draco blushes at the press of his sturdy shoulder and shoves back at Potter, playful, but also putting a bit more distance between them. It backfires, however, because then Potter laughs and throws an arm over his shoulders.
“Oh – Potter!” He sputters eloquently.
He drops a Knut into the pouch on the owl’s other leg. “Gringotts, Department of Exchanges please,” he instructs. The owl hoots a soft affirmative, allowing him to gently stroke its head, before it takes off through the open window. Draco smiles wanly. He likes this owl. It’s one of the few living things around that doesn’t look at him like dung underfoot.
“Likewise,” Draco answers stiffly, collecting his potion and money pouch to his coat pocket. He tugs his hood over his head and hurries back out into the street, relieved to be away from the old pervert.
“I’m fine,” says Draco, and shivers.
The pair of them sit in comfortable companionship for the rest of the day, reading silently and occasionally interrupting the quiet to chat about something small and inane. By the time the library closes, and the librarian kicks them out, Draco is feeling unreasonably warm, inside and out.
“No, no,” says Potter. “It sounds wonderful. I – er – I never had any Christmas traditions.”
The new channel is recapping this weeks Quidditch scores, and Draco half listens as he ferries ingredients over to the cauldrons, each with their own long table on which Draco sets the ingredients for each potion in the order they’re needed. It seems it’s been a good week for the Falcons and, predictably, Forsythe soon starts gloating.
Draco squirms. Has he given something away? “What?” he asks uncomfortably.
Draco stretches languorously and blinks at Potter, who’s staring back at him intently. “You’re an odd one Potter,” he tells him. He extends a lazy hand. “Help me up, won’t you?”
Consider even transportation – an Apparition licence is the cheapest option, but it requires magic. Floo powder is not expensive in and off itself, but you’d need a hearth, which is not always an option on a budget. Brooms are expensive. Portkeys need a license and have to be charmed. Knight Bus fare adds up when you have to pay twice a day every day…”
By this point they’ve left Diagon and have travelled down at least two other streets. The area here is residential, with cute little houses decorated with festive lights lining the street. They don’t look big enough to have backyard ice rinks. “Do you live here then?” he asks Potter.
He hadn’t been sure that this place would still be open – it’s been over ten years since his last visit after all – but he’d dearly hoped it was. He has fond memories of this place, of coming hear with his mother while his father had conducted business in Gringotts, and whiling away afternoon surrounded by warm light and the smell of books. When he was older, he and his mother simply sit near one another to read and enjoy one another’s company, but during his younger years she had sat him on her lap and stroked his hair while she’d read to him in her calming voice.
“I didn’t know what you liked so I got…everything?” he says. Draco gives him an incredulous look, but gamely takes a sip. It’s ridiculous, absolutely, and he shouldn’t like it… but it’s warm and sweet and, underneath the pile of toppings, actually has a lovely flavour. Besides, Draco has always had a horrid sweet-tooth.
“Don’t go feeling guilty over it, Potter,” he tells him. “You and Granger have been doing more than most to right such injustices.”
“Taking you to get hot chocolate,” he says cheerily, striding assuredly along. The ease with which he carries Draco is staggering, and it makes his mouth a little dry to think about. He can feel every shift in Potter’s muscles as he’s carried, past the benches and warming huts and food stands and–
“I won’t drop you,” he assures, but then he tries to straighten them and loses his balance, and they both fall both into the snowbank that edges this portion of the ice.
“Touché,” he yawns, too sleepy to bother with a comeback. He glances up at the clock, which shows quarter to three, and frowns. “You should have woken me.”
He doesn’t call Potter out on it, though, because he quite frankly wants to get out of the cold as soon as possible. He’s disappointed that they’re parting ways so soon, but he feels as though he’s going to freeze his bollocks off if he stands out here for much longer. “I’ll meet you tomorrow, same time?” He offers to Potter, already turning to head back.
The sight of Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World, dribbling hot chocolate is too much, and Draco can’t hold in his delighted laughter. Potter manages to get a hold of himself, dabbing at his mouth with his serviette and blushing furiously as he glares at Draco, but that only makes Draco laugh harder. Potter glares for a moment longer, and then he is laughing too. “I’m not usually this clumsy, honest!” Potter defends once they’ve both calmed down.
Hope you enjoyed!
Potter sits up straight. “Oh,” he says, his face lighting up. “That’s…brilliant. Me too, actually. Well, both really, but you know…” Ah. Draco has suspected, but never confirmed. Another piece of the puzzle Draco’s been firmly ignoring clicks into place.
Draco lets out a snort of laughter before he can stop himself, and Potter gives a victorious smile. They’re back on the ice by now, so Draco takes pity on Potter and starts by showing him some more basics.
Instead, he sticks his hand in his pockets and walks down to the brick wall at the dead-end of Knockturn, pushing on the slightly off-colour brick near his left kneecap to open the portal to Muggle London.
“Yes, let’s,” says Draco. He rises gracefully from his seat, then turns to smirk at Potter as a thought occurs to him. “By the way Potter, it did not escape my notice that you’ve come here an hour early. I wonder if it isn’t you who’s eager to see me?”
Draco frowns, opening his mouth to tell Potter, again, that it’s fine, but Potter heads him off. “I know you said it’s okay,” he says quickly, “but it would make me feel better.” When Draco still doesn’t answer, he tilts his head, gives him a beseeching look that makes him look a little like a baby Crup, and says “Please?”
“Alright, alright,” Draco concedes. He frowns thoughtfully. He is a decent skater, but no kind of teacher. He thinks back to his first time on ice, when his father had tried to teach his impatient arse. “Let’s take this slow Potter. Don’t try to glide or anything. Just…move like a penguin.”
Draco shakes his head, forcibly banishing the thought. There’s no use dwelling on things that he cannot change. He tugs his hood up over his head and turns, making his way downstairs into the lobby, and out into Knockturn Alley. It’s a cold day, and blustering, and Draco fights the wind as he makes his way down the street. It stings at the skin it finds through the holes in his gloves and lifts the ends of his coat. Draco sticks his hands into his pockets with a huff, lowering his head against the tiny flakes of snow blasting against his face in tiny pinpricks.
The man’s glower slips away, replaced by a creepy grin. “Well, aren’t you a pretty little thing?” He purrs. “What can I do for you?”
Potter smiles at him so tenderly, and says, “Don’t worry Emory. I’ve got you.”, and Draco’s insides warm impossibly.
Draco digs his nails into his own bloodied palm and forces down his disgust. “It is just a scratch. Nothing to worry about,” he answers shortly.
“I might have one at home,” Ugbert leers, and Draco grimaces in disgust. It’s way too much money, a huge chunk of his salary that will leave his food budget for the foreseeable future considerably lowered, but –
“I thought we agreed that we were not going to kill me,” he objects, smacking Potter’s shoulder. Potter looks sheepish.
He sits up with a groan, the beginnings of an exhaustion headache drumming lightly at his temples. A moment bemoaning his lack of tea, before he drags himself over to the sink and pours himself a glass of water.
“Yes, well…” he mutters, flustered. He covers the book with his other hand, and then lifts his chin and looks back up at Potter defiantly. “It’s an interest, nothing more.” He quickly changes the subject. “What are you doing back at the library today Potter? Granger on a research kick?”
“Did you just use a Tripping Jinx on me?” He accuses.
“I know,” says Draco without thinking, then clamps his mouth shut, eyes widening. Luckily, Potter doesn’t seem suspicious.
Draco flushes. “Oh…right,” he mutters. “Okay, to stop you turn your toes inward and sort of push out…like this.” He skates a bit away from Potter and demonstrates.
The plethora of choice now, after years, is thrilling, and he finds himself in no hurry to decide on reading material. That is, until he is in the learning section and the spartan lettering on the straight-backed spine of an utterly unremarkable book catches his eye.
With the money put away for the night, he turns to his final task of wiping down the counter, humming a tune that had been playing on the wireless earlier as he works. He picks up a crumpled-up bag that Forsythe had left on the corner, expecting it to be garbage, but to his surprise he finds that there is some weight to it. Confused, he peers inside and finds that Forsythe has discarded a pair of bagels.
“Thanks,” he mutters, his smile turning more real at the show of consideration. Potter grins back at him.
“Yeah,” says Potter eagerly. He skates toward Draco and almost falls on him again.
He flexes his hands, biting back a whimper at the pain it brings. There’s nothing he can do about it now, though, so he steels himself and braces against the wind, leaving his hands to get blasted so that he can hold on to his hood and prevent it from being blown off again.
These twilight hours are beautiful, and if it wasn’t for the horrid cold Draco would slow down to appreciate the early morning stillness. As it is, he hurries along the familiar path, out of Knockturn and into the properly deserted Diagon. The street twinkles serenely, decorative lights throwing glittering sparkles onto the snow. It makes Draco’s breath catch, and he finds himself irrationally wondering if Potter has ever seen Diagon like this.
Draco hesitates. He has no muggle money on him, only the bag of bagels in his pocket, and he doesn’t want to give that over – he rarely gets much to eat and something so fresh is a treat. He has the last of his frozen bread at home, yes, but with the expensive purchase of the potion earlier he is going to have to reduce his food spending for the next little while. He has so little – surely the plight of these people shouldn’t be his to reduce?
Potter shakes his head, scuffing his strange muggle shoes against the warm carpet as he peers at Draco again. “You ran off so quickly yesterday,” he says, surprisingly unsure. “I didn’t get a chance to offer, but I’d like to buy you a drink. To make it up to you.”
That’s a surprise – he’s slept in. It’s not something he normally does; usually he wakes with the sun or sometimes, in winter, before it if the cold wakes him first. He hasn’t a wand to provide an alarm, so his internal clock has had to step up to the plate to prevent him from missing work. He can’t deny that it’s nice, though, and he feels incredibly well rested.
Draco blinks up at him, then nods. He does trust Potter. He squirms, vying to get down, but Potter just tightens his grip and holds fast. Draco wrinkles his brow at him.
is all around.
He toasts himself a couple of slices of bread, eating them dry, and boils some water that he pretends is tea. Then he heads to the library, where he and Potter are to meet.
“Uh huh. Are you?”
Malfoy smirked. “Yes. And
Malfoy didn’t respond to Harry’s outburst by yelling back, instead he was calm. “That is true. All the others do deserve recognition too for everything they did, including keeping your stupid self alive. Honestly, Granger deserves a medal for that alone. But just because they also did things, does not mean you
Malfoy was still talking. “I can’t
“No!” Harry said hurriedly and a tiny bit too loudly if the looks he was getting from the table nearest to them was anything to go by. “No,” he repeated quieter. The images that brought to mind were not something Harry wanted to think about. Malfoy and he had never and would never do that.
turned up to the church to light lanterns.” Harry sighed.  “I just want one day a year for me, to spend it quietly with the people I care about, is that too much to ask?”
what house you were in. Your identity is not determined by the colour of your robes or what table you sat at for breakfast. We’re all adults, with jobs in different fields, relationships based on love; what was the centre of our world at school barely crosses our mind now.” Malfoy seemed to realise he'd been rambling and shot an embarrassed look at Harry. “At least, that’s how I feel.”
"It doesn't matter now. All that matters is that I take better care of myself, and I learn from my past." Harry wondered when he became such a philosophical person, and he could see that Draco was thinking the same thing.
"Anyway, where are Ron and Hermione? Did they not want to come because of. . ." Draco changed the subject carefully, knowing about Fred.
“Emory! Hi,” it says. Draco’s eyes dart up from sheer force of habit – he’s never been able to ignore Potter – and he jumps slightly when he finds the other man standing right there, looking directly at him.
“What? Why not?” Potter asks with a frown. He looks around, as if Draco’s wand will just appear in front of him.
Ugbert leers. “Need someone to tame your fire darling?” He asks. But he doesn’t come around the counter or try to touch Draco. He just retrieves the extinguishers and sets them on the counter. “That’ll be 8 Sickles and 18 Knuts,” he says.
“If your flaws continue buying me hot chocolate and pastries, I might just be persuaded,” he returns easily. He sips at said hot chocolate to make his point and smirks at Potter.
“I take offense to that,” Draco sniffs, and then shivers again.
The owl turns its back on him as soon as he has the pouch, flaring its wings and tail in a dramatic display of disdain, that Draco amusedly appreciates, before it flies out the window. He wrestles it shut again, shivering slightly from the cold wind.
The text expects that it will take several days of practice to even pull one’s magic up far enough to get sparkles, but it’s infinitely easier than heating charms and Draco has them dancing around before him in a matter of minutes. Changing their properties is more of a challenge, one that Draco dives into with enthusiasm. He spends the better part of an hour learning how to make sparkles bend to his whim.
“What is the noble cause this time then?” He asks when Potter’s antsiness becomes too much. He doesn’t lift his eyes from his book.
Draco nearly drops the money in his haste to turn and take another look at the crate – and yes, there are the two extinguishers, fresh from Ugbert’s. Merlin, all that wish-magic babble hadn’t been a dream! It is almost unbelievable, but Draco can’t deny what’s right in front of him.
He breaks off abruptly and shakes his head, embarrassed. “Sorry, it’s not a very interesting story. Ice skating of all things…”
“I didn’t get you anything,” he says uncertainly, making no move to take the box.
“Don’t tell me what’s best!” Bellows Forsythe. He steps forward menacingly, and Draco can’t help his own step back. “Your inability to cast a simple healing charm is not my problem Malfoy. Deal with this.” His face twists into a mean sneer. “And don’t think I’m going to pay you for any time you miss,” he adds in a hiss.
Resigning himself to facing the perverted creep, Draco grabs his money sack from his crate and counts out the familiar cost. One Galleon and thirteen Knuts – he grimaces at the steep price. He hadn’t thought this through – thanks to Forsythe he’s already had to eat into his funds buying that wretched potion. Trying to cast a warming charm when he was down to his last extinguisher had been careless – it had just been so terribly cold.
“Have a good day,” he wishes her. She returns the sentiment and Draco heads out back into the rundown Muggle street with the noisy, flimsy Muggle sack hanging from his arm.
It’s still cold, and his wet hair makes him even colder, but he has two extinguishers and he’s feeling optimistic, so he tentatively holds his hand to his head and concentrates. The Hot Air Charm is never strong when he manages to cast it, but it’s not as though he wants to blast steaming hot air directly at his head anyhow. Still, he’s more worried trying to dry his hair like this than he is trying to warm his apartment – if his magic escapes his control, he’s at risk of setting his own hair on fire. Just another reason to hate this season as far as he’s concerned. Draco isn’t about to go through the whole of winter without washing his hair, however – even he has limits. So, he risks self-combusting every now and again.
Potter groans. “Hermione, I’ve got plans!” He whispers furiously, shooting an apologetic glance toward Draco, who’s trying to keep from shivering in the cold air. It takes him a moment to process this, and then raises an eyebrow, shocked. Potter is blowing off his friends for him? He can’t help feeling strangely pleased at the notion.
Draco stares at the closed door in shock, then slowly returns to his own apartment, closing the door and walking over to the bathroom with its old, chipped mirror. His own face looks back at him, wide-eyed and gaunt but unmistakable. Draco sits heavily on the top of his toilet as the implication sinks it.
I thought this was twice as long because I almost posted the last chapter and this one combined :(
“Well it isn’t going to fit me,” he says stubbornly, crossing his arms over his chest and glaring at Draco sternly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And you’re an arse,” returns Potter around a grin. “Come on, show me how to do the turns like that!”
What If I was mean and put out the Christmas chapter on Christmas? (that might actually happen considering my schedule, so I'm sorry in advance)
"Who made sure to never leave marks on you?" Harry could hear the cautiousness in Draco's voice.
Basically boys in love, but they don't know they're in love.
"It doesn't still hurt, does it, the- the" Harry gestured vaguely to his chest and stomach. Eventually, Draco understood and pulled off his shirt so Harry could see the even paler scars against his already pale torso. Harry lifted his hand to his mouth, noticing the malnutrition. He had looked that way himself until about two years ago. Draco finally spoke up,
"I'm sorry for everything, and it's apparent," Draco gestured to Harry, "that you are too. So let's start over. Hi, I'm Draco Malfoy, I have been a prick my whole life, but I'm trying something new this year." Draco held out his hand, and this time, Harry took it.
"Well," Harry started, cautious of how this would play out, "when I had nightmares, one of the boys in my dorm would sleep in my bed with me to help me calm down. (Same as kissing the homies goodnight)" Harry wasn't sure if the Slytherins were as touchy-feely as the Gryffindors were, or if they were at that stage of friendship yet.
"It's cologne, Potter, and--"
"Savior of the wizarding world, and he gets choked up by a couple of scars." Draco had tears running down his face at this point.
"I'm trying to be your friend, so I'm trying to be theirs. Friends don't call friends by their last names. I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed. Goodnight. . . Harry," grabbed his pajamas and headed for the bathroom. Harry pondered over the conversation he had that night. Everything was so strange; he was now friends with his enemy, without his best friends here.
"The Dursleys. They cared about keeping up appearances other than anything else. They said I was at a 'School for Troubled Boys' instead of Hogwarts. They barely gave me food and treated me like a house-elf. I did the cooking, cleaning, anything they wanted. Dudley was their favorite. Made me sleep in a closet until 2nd or 3rd year for Merlin's sake." The lightness in Harry's voice frightened Draco. Harry could see it in his face. He also saw immense, boiling anger at what they had done. Harry knew his childhood was an abusive one, and he knew there was nothing he could do about it now, so he accepted it for what it was.
The flowers, he found out, were a specific type called a Narcissus. Harry took a wild guess as to why Draco had Narcissus on his arms. By that time, Draco had woken up, wrapped himself in his blanket, and had placed his head on Harry's shoulder to read the letter.
"Hey," Harry said, smoothing Draco's hair back and sitting at the side of the bed, "it's alright, can you tell me what happened? Was it the War? Your parents?" Draco was shaking and crying, so all he could do was nod.
Just. . . Not this week. Or this month. The two boys put off talking to each other for as long as possible, awkwardly skirting around each other during the day. They still comforted each other when they had nightmares, though.
"Can I touch one, please," Harry was cautious since he was the one who gave Draco those scars. Draco nodded after a few seconds of contemplation. Harry started with one going up to his shoulder; the others seemed too intimate. The scar's rough skin felt out of place next to the soft skin on Draco's torso. Harry broke down and did something he never thought he would do. He hugged Draco Malfoy. It took a few seconds for Draco to register the hug, but he eventually wrapped his arms around Harry. Harry kept whispering 'I'm so sorry' over and over again until Draco started crying and pushed Harry off.
"Potter, I'm sorry for the past seven years; I was a real prick, wasn't I." He was so close to crying and let out a choked sob turned into a laugh. "You got me back for it, though, and I guess karma did too." Harry felt terrible. He remembered Hermione punching him, the midnight duel, the Triwizard tournament, the Dark Mark, the War, the Sectumsempra curse.
"Yeah, all of us are sad about Fred, George mostly, but Hermione thought she was smart enough, and Ron's a lapdog when It comes to Hermione. They're staying at the Burrow and-- wait. You called them Ron and Hermione instead of Granger and Weasley. I thought that you didn't like them." Harry had gone from sad to confused real quick.
A few minutes later, Draco came out in more muggle clothing, which surprised Harry more now, considering there wasn’t anyone to judge him about being from a pureblood family, or from being on the wrong side of the war. He was wearing a severely oversized light blue muggle shirt with the phrase 'et Enfin, Je vois la lumière'. Harry had no idea what that meant, but he knew from what little gossip he heard that wasn’t about him that most pureblood families spoke French before they spoke English, so he assumed that it was a French phrase. He was also wearing very short dark green quidditch shorts, but they seemed to be more for comfort than physical ability. Harry had a bit of a hard time looking away from Draco at this point, but he eventually forced himself to look at Draco's face, feeling his face flush red. Draco seemed too tired to notice though, and got into his bed without another word to him.
"not anymore. Hurt like a bitch when you cast it, though." Draco laughed as if it was a fond memory instead of one that could have killed him. Some of the scars crisscrossed one another and went from shoulders to just below the waistband of his jeans.
"We should get to class before Slughorn (I almost wrote Snape) gives us detention again," Harry spoke into the thick silence in the room.
Draco sat down right next to Harry without saying a word and started eating. Harry had spent the rest of dinner staring. He couldn't believe that the prim, proper Slytherin could turn into something out of a Gryffindor stereotype. After dinner, all the 8th years went back to their common room (no houses means one common room for the 20-or so kids that came back) and got their dorm assignments. To both Harry and Draco's surprise, they were paired up in a dorm together. 'McGonagall's got to be fucking with me,' Harry thought. McGonagall couldn't put him with Draco. Of course, Harry wanted to be on good terms, but not room with the guy; he was still a git for Merlin's sake. There seemed to be nothing either of them could do, so they accepted it and went up to their dorm. There, Draco uttered his first words since he got here,
(See the end of the chapter for
"Since you are all responsible adults, we will be learning about Amortentia, also known as the love potion. We will be brewing it, but it's not in any book, so you'll be following directions from the board. This potion is never to be used on a person, for it is an extreme violation of privacy, and it is also immensely illegal."
Half an hour had passed before the doors to the Great Hall opened with a flourish, and a very different Draco Malfoy walked in. Harry looked up and gaped as Draco strutted towards him. Draco had dyed his hair a soft blue and had flowers tattooed up and down his arms. He had on muggle clothes that fit him well, black skinny jeans, and a grey short-sleeved shirt with the Draco constellation on it. Draco also had a ring in his lip, which Harry remembered vaguely being called a snake bite, which seemed fitting. Harry had never seen Draco this unhinged, and he guessed it was the combination of the war trauma and his father locked away in Azkaban.
Everyone in the class was staring, marveling at what had just happened, even Slughorn. Everyone was silent the rest of class because Draco was glaring at everyone daring them to comment on it. When class let out, Draco knew he needed to talk to Harry, however much he didn't want to.
It had just hit Draco what both of them had said, and turned a bright shade of scarlet. Harry started turning red and rushed out of the room.
Somehow politics snuck in here idk it wasn’t the plan
Draco shakes his head, tearing his bagel apart and smirking at Potter. “I don’t know,” he replies, “first you bowled me over in the Alley yesterday, and now this.” He sighs dramatically. “I think you will just have to accept the obvious – you are an utter klutz”
Potter smiles. “It’s my pleasure,” he says. His eyes are very green, and very, very intense, warm as they meet Draco’s own. Draco flushes again and looks down, breaking his gaze. His fingers fumble, unusually graceless as he does up the buttons and slips of his threadbare gloves, making sure to tug down his sleeves to prevent the Mark from showing. The new gloves are not charmed, but they are fur-lined and unbelievably soft.
“Hermione?” He asks, pulling his arm away from Draco’s shoulder and turning to address the otter. “What’s wrong?” Draco shivers, mourning the loss of Potter’s warmth, and turns to the otter also.
The work requires practically no mental input, and Draco finds his mind wondering as he counts and packs ingredients. In the front room, Forsythe has the wireless playing as he often does. Draco hums along to the muffled melodies he can hear through the door. Customers come in sometimes, but they rarely provide interesting conversation.
To his surprise, the air around him immediately warms. His and Potter’s breath both catch in tandem and he opens his eyes to meet the other man’s intense gaze, the warm glow of magic fading between them. Then the air starts cooling again, the heat dissipating into the open street.
“Right, no, of course,” says Potter, scratching at the back of his head. He shuffles awkwardly from foot to foot, before he asks, “Shall we get going then?”
He looks longingly at his little noodle packet, wishing he could boil it now and have a warm meal. He’s just eaten though, and he could never eat more so soon. Even if his stomach is still growling hungrily. There’s no guarantee that the stove will turn on anyhow. It’s less likely to work in the cold, and it’s very cold right now. Draco can’t stop himself from trembling under his threadbare blanket.
There’s an exercise here too, walking him through the steps to produce harmless sparkles and then working through controlling the amount, shape, and intensity of them. It’s not a direct, straightforward endeavor, of course, where one simply follows a series of instructions and achieves a result. This is more nuanced, the instructions more abstract, requiring interpretation and creativity to apply them.
Potter’s eyes widen, and he brings his hands up in front of him placatingly. “It’s not pity, I swear!” He says. “It’s kind of self-serving, actually. I wanted to spend more time out on the ice that’s all. Like I said, think of it as an early Christmas present.”
He glides past Potter, spinning to skate backwards in front of him and smirking. “It seems I’ve bested you Potter,” he says. Potter doesn’t seem too put out – he’s sporting a huge grin as he skates along.
Potter catches his hand, though, and, instead of agreeing, says “Come with me.” Draco looks down at where their hands are intertwined, his face exploding with heat and his words abandoning him. When he doesn’t answer quickly enough, Potter adds, “I’ll get you a hot chocolate to make it up to you?”
Draco pushes inside, the bells above the door tinkling to announce his arrival, and steps into a dark room that is empty of another human presence.
“Such a hardship,” Potter says. “How will my flaws and I manage?”
“Nothing,” Potter replies. He smiles suddenly. “Come ice skating with me tomorrow?”
Draco nestles in further, refusing to look at him. “’M fine,” he mumbles. “Thanks Potter.”
She glances up at him, a smile twitching at her lips. “Don’t like your in-laws?” She asks. Draco couldn’t think of anything further from the truth, but he somehow doesn’t want to explain quite how pathetic he is to this girl.
The street is bustling in a way that Knockturn never quite imitates. Families,
Potter gives a self-conscious little smile. “I was almost pissing myself giving all those speeches,” he confesses. “Hermione kept giving me these massive packages of information – nearly seventy inches once, double sided! And I was supposed to include it all in my speeches. Most of the time I went up in front of the Wizengamot and completely blanked.”
Draco eyes the cup warily. She’s trying to sell him tea? He cannot deny that it’s an appealing thought – he’s still shivering from the chill of being outside, and the caffeine would be welcome – but he doesn’t have that kind of money to spare.
Potter is frowning. “Someone took a picture of you?” He repeats, ignoring the biscuits. Draco nods, turning slightly in his seat to find the girl and point her out to Potter. To his surprise, she’s watching him again. As Draco looks at her, she goes red and ducks her head down.
“You got me,” says Potter. “My original plan was a house of candy, but this seemed easier.” Draco has no idea what he’s talking about, but Potter’s smile is bright and directed only at him and he finds that he doesn’t mind. Twinging with happy warmth, he pops the bit of torn-off cinnamon bun in his mouth and lets out a pleased hum, closing his eyes at the delicious flavour.
“Call me Harry,” Potter insists. Draco frowns – that’s decidedly too weird. It’s not as though they’re going to see each other again anyway.
Ao3 is down and making it very difficult for me /sobs
The otter looks between them and says carefully, “I check if someone else is available.” Granger’s voice is loaded with something that Draco doesn’t understand, but it makes Potter snort.
(See the end of the chapter for
Taking a shaky breath, he pockets his money again and steps out into the hallway. It’s just past eight in the morning, and he can hear people moving around their apartments through the thin walls. Next-door is still muffled behind the Imperturbable Charm.
It’s not much of a problem in small doses, except for when Draco is trying to perform wandless magic untrained and every minor change in his magic is magnified to the extreme. He doesn’t know how to wrangle his magic when it’s like this, which means he has to sit here in the cold until it calms somewhat.
He makes his way to a familiar isle, picking out a loaf of bread from the many available. Then he turns and surveys the store, pondering what he should spend the extra bit of money he’d left Ugbert’s with yesterday on. It’s not a lot more money, but it’s enough for him to pick up a small square of cheese that he can use for sandwiches and, on a whim, a packet of those flavoured noodles that can be boiled.
The presence answers, but not verbally. Its words seem to reverberate all around him, and within Draco’s own head.
No, there is only once place that he can go – the only shop that will sell to him at only moderately extorted prices, and one of Draco’s least favourite place to be.
The Knockturn entrance is not quite as nice as the Diagon entrance. This way opens out to a rundown little street with cracks in the road, small houses with chain-linked fences, a brightly lit little corner shop, and a small park that was scarcely more than some grass and three trees. Nevertheless, Draco makes a beeline for the park, enjoying spending some time in the outdoors. It’s peaceful and serene here, the world blanketed by a layer of snow that seemed to insulate him, making it feel like he’s the only person in the world.
Confused, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out considerably more coin than he’s just put in. It takes a moment for it to click, but then the events of yesterday come rushing back.
He lets go of Potter to demonstrate. Potter watches closely, then reaches for him and clutches his arm nervously as he imitates his steps. Draco gives him gentle corrections (“Open your toes Potter”, “No don’t
He continues retreating up the street until he’s about thirty paces away from Gringotts, where he takes an abrupt left into a tiny, cramped side alley that contains a couple of little storefronts. One of them bears an old, chipped sign, with fading paint proclaiming it a library. Draco smiles at the sight of it.
“I’ll be heading out now Mr. Forsythe,” Draco calls, poking his head out into the front of the store.
“Oh,” says Potter, face clearing. He relaxes back into his chair with a grin. “Something about vampires, I’m not too sure about the specifics.”
The silence hangs, awkward, for a beat before Potter fills it. “I really am sorry you know,” he says, and it’s no less awkward now that he’s speaking. Draco casts about for something to say.
He thankfully takes mercy on Draco then, getting up to go get something to read from the shelves and giving him time to pull his façade back together. By the time Potter returns with some book about Quidditch, Draco’s cheeks are no longer heated, and he’s managed to compose himself.
“Ice skating,” he says finally.
Potter sputters, his face rapidly reddening, and Draco can’t help but chuckle at his incredulous expression as he goes to shelf his book.  Still, he wonders just how fond Potter is becoming of him. It makes him feel guilty – after all, Potter would want nothing to do with him if he knew who he was.
Potter raises his eyebrows, but lets it go with a “Sure,” before following Draco to the door. A pleasant warmth falls over Draco as they leave, and a glance at Potter shows the other man putting away his wand.
Potter takes a lot longer to get this right. He keeps stopping too harshly and nearly falling on Draco. It’s only once Draco starts complaining about Potter’s considerable weight – though he’s not actually that upset, he’s gotten his hands all over those muscles during the past little while– and threating to drop Potter on his arse that they start making progress.
“Goodbye Potter,” he insists instead. Potter opens his mouth to argue, but at that moment Granger emerges from the stacks and catches sight of them. She makes a beeline toward Potter, and Draco nods a greeting at her and steps out of the way. He catches sight of Potter’s pout in the corner of his eye and grins to himself, feeling lighter than he has in years as he makes his way back to the wandless magic section.
Potter raises his eyebrows, but he’s smiling. “I said, why don’t you get us seats and I’ll get the drinks.”
He thinks back to the incident with a frown, his mind drawing, with loving detail, the solid form that had bowled him over. Merlin, but he’d looked good. Draco’s heard his voice often over the years – Potter is, to this day, a darling of the media and is often featured on the wireless – but he hasn’t seen him since the end of the war. Clearly, time has treated Potter as well as it’s treated Draco badly. He’d already been arresting in school, a wild magnetism to him that had always drawn Draco’s attention – and now he’s grown into it, wearing that pull with an innate ease. Auror work has filled out his frame, his muscles just discernable under his robes and certainly felt when he was barrelling into Draco, and he’s lost the general air of confusion he’d had as a boy. During their brief interaction he’d seemed capable, powerful...
Potter flushes and scratches at the back of his head. “Sorry about that,” he says. “You’re the bloke from yesterday right? The one I ran into?”
“Only if you teach me how to do all that?” he bids easily.
“I know a better place,” Potter says. “It’s outside the park, so it’s a bit further away, but it’s worth it, trust me.”
“So,” Potter says at length, finally breaking the silence, “enough about me. Tell me about yourself Emory.”
Draco’s mouth opens and closes uselessly, not sure what to say. Potter remembers him, from bumping into him in the street. Potter is talking to him. Normally. What the fuck?
Draco wakes up to a day like any other in the dull mundanity that is his life. He opens his eyes to a barren ceiling with cracks and spots in the plaster, and sun shining in through the holes in his tatty curtains. His tiny apartment is freezing, containing neither a fireplace nor a built-in heating charm. Winter is Draco’s least favourite time of the year; the cold seeps into his bones and threatens to freeze them still for eternity.
His eyes are guileless under Draco’s searching gaze and, after a moment, Draco sighs. “Very well. In that case…thank you,” he says stiffly.
“Oops,” says Potter sheepishly, sitting up and shaking snow out of his hair. There’s still plenty caught in the thick thatch, though, and he just looks ridiculous.
“Oh, right, sorry,” Potter fumbles. “I just- you looked comfortable.”
He remains silent a moment too long, or else Potter senses his hesitance, and he backs off a little. “Okay, don’t worry about the childhood stories then,” he says. “How about… your favourite winter activity?”
“Christmas is the worst,” he replies.
This is the last of what I had written during vacation, so things will definitely slow down now sorry
“No problem,” he says, leaning closer and bumping Draco with his shoulder.
“Harry,” corrects Potter, “and I find you plenty interesting.”
“Thank you, Potter,” he says, stopping just inside the library door.
He does avoid the kick, though, and she glowers at him before storming into her apartment. Grimacing in disgust, Draco lets himself into his own apartment and tiredly goes to the bathroom and scrubs his face clean. Then he returns to the main room to slump onto the bed, feeling properly downtrodden.
Potter takes him to a tidy little alley behind the park, which turns out to house another entrance to Muggle London. The alley on the Muggle side is tiny and holds rubbish bins, but opens out onto a massive, bustling street, surrounded by large, mostly square buildings. It hums with the Muggle lights that line the street and shine from windows and storefronts. Even the Muggle version of Christmas lights emit the sound.
When he falls asleep that night, he dreams of warm winters past and stunning green eyes.
It’s ice cold, and Draco shudders as he sets the glass back down. His stomach chooses that moment to emit a sharp pang of hunger, reminding him that he hadn’t eaten the day before. His kitchen remains frustratingly devoid of food, though, which means he’ll have to make a grocery run.
He wants to go right now? Draco looks at him in shock, but he seems perfectly serious, still looking over at Draco’s book.
A very good question. Harry wasn’t sure.
protect you, Potter.”
“Are you interested in getting to know him? Find out what he’s been up to since the last time you saw him?”
“I don’t know what you’re thinking, but
“Yup.” Harry wondered if he should be worried about how much Malfoy had told his muggle friends. Still, nothing so far was hurting anyone or violating the Statute of Secrecy.
She was silent for the most part, the only sound coming from her was her nails drumming on the bar top. Harry wondered if he’d get away with simply handing over her drinks without her uttering a word to him.
Harry’s breath rushed out of him in relief, “Oh thank Merlin, me too.”
interested in Draco.”
This time Harry didn’t smile back, keeping his eyes on the counter as he traced the grain with his finger, trying to work up the courage to ask his question. The air seemed to get heavier with his lack of response and he felt the atmosphere become tenser by the second. He saw Malfoy stiffen up out of the corner of his eye and swallowed, knowing that if he didn’t ask now he never would and would likely make their semi-friendly relationship awkward again.
“Hi.”
He knew the culprit. It was Malfoy. It was always Malfoy that was to blame. He’d thrown Harry off his game and distracted him by spawning millions of questions in his head.
“Well, they probably won’t be anymore.”
cause enough chaos I could sneak into The Three Broomsticks and steal a bottle of firewhiskey.”
“Yeah, I know. But I would’ve come over to apologise with or without the threat. I know I screwed up and freaked you out, and I’m sorry.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He did a double take when his eyes landed on a head of familiar white-blonde hair, which stood out from the rest of the crowd like a

use an Incendio to light the fire.”
Harry looked up and met Malfoy’s eyes, hoping his expression conveyed his appreciation because he wasn’t sure how to put it into words.
“What?” Harry said, bewildered.
Harry?”
“What is it?” Harry asked.
to come here. His first thought on having a free day wasn’t to go out drinking with Ron and Hermione, it was that he
Harry considered not answering but saw no harm in it, “Yeah.”
Harry took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. It was okay. He wasn’t fired. He wasn’t in trouble, and reluctantly he admitted Roger might have a point. He could use some time to brush off all the vivid images Mike’s words had brought to mind and the sudden flare of lust that accompanied them.
If this was any indication about what was to come, it was going to be one hell of a year.
“If that's true then you need new glasses because I just managed to get the jump on you.”
Malfoy shrugged, looking a little embarrassed. “I wanted to get out and do something. It’s terribly boring sitting at home with mother and father and occasionally spending some galleons on a new book or Quidditch equipment. I’ve read most the library by now and Quidditch is no fun without people to play against.” Harry opened his mouth to volunteer to play against him because it’d been too long since he’d been on a broom and even longer since he’d had a decent seeker to compete against (not that he’d admit that to Malfoy), but the thought of going to Malfoy Manor, where Hermione had been tortured, had him shutting it quickly.
At least everyone else was suitably distracted tonight, it just wasn’t in the cosy, comfortable way he’d hoped, and it didn’t include him. Instead of his quiet little evening, it had turned into a loud circus full of people he didn’t know and didn’t care too.
Harry distantly wondered how long Malfoy had been watching him and if anyone else had noticed.
Harry smiled, relieved that he’d finally caught a break. “Yeah.”
to see Malfoy,
His head shot up when he made the conclusion and he immediately sought out Malfoy. For the first time that night, Malfoy was looking straight at him, his body turned towards Harry’s across the room, and as their eyes met he slowly shook his head. Harry got the message.
Harry could swear he felt Malfoy’s eyes on him but whenever he spun around to try to catch him in the act, the man was mid-conversation with his friends and pretending Harry didn’t exist.
Harry started in surprise at the direct question. Malfoy had never hidden his opinion, taking great joy in telling Harry exactly what he thought of him, but he thought he’d at least balk at asking something so personal about his school rival. Harry had never hidden his sexuality from people, but he didn’t go screaming it from the rooftops either.
They fell into an uneasy silence, the air tense and heavy with things left unsaid and neither one of them knowing how to react. As minutes passed with no movement from either of them, Harry started to panic that this would be it for the night, that all his questions would remain unanswered and the things he’d been worrying about would be for nothing; Malfoy would turn around, go back to his friends, and never talk to Harry again. But he couldn’t find the courage to be the one to break the increasingly oppressive silence and with each passing second it became more and more difficult to do.
“Yeah…”
Malfoy gave him a disbelieving look that showed just how stupid he thought that question was. “Potter. The whole of Wizarding Britain knows it’s your birthday.
Harry smiled as he poured a pint of cider into a glass and pushed it towards one of his favourite regular customers.
“You always had my attention,” Harry replied quietly.
“But they don’t know about magic?” Harry clarified, and Malfoy shook his head. Harry raised his eyebrows, “How did you manage to keep that from them? Why did they think you couldn’t even turn on a TV?”
“Yes, but-”
“Do you want to know a secret,” Malfoy said, lowering his voice to a whisper so Harry had to lean in even further to hear him.
Malfoy sauntered back into the room a few minutes later, brushing his arm against Harry as he passed and causing Harry to shiver.
“How did you even pull this off?” Harry asked, not managing to hide his awe.
“Yes…”
“Anything else?”
He wondered if the Muggle world had been as magical for Malfoy as the Wizarding World had been for Harry.
“Bet that caused some tension.”
Harry hated his life sometimes.
Harry flicked quickly back to the front page and his eyes darted around the photograph there, searching for anything that would prove his theory or screamed Malfoy. It took him less than ten seconds to find it, and he had to shake his head in amazement at the audacity of the blonde.
Malfoy was shaking his head but he was smiling, “Ah, but those are all big cats, and no self-respecting Slytherin would compare themselves to something so closely associated with their rival house.”
Everyone was enjoying themselves, apart from him. Which was ironic as it was
“No. Me, Scarlett and Bruce all live together. Felicity and Mike are dating, have been for four years, so live together a couple of rooms down.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened at the exact same time Harry’s did and his eyebrows shot up in surprise. Clearly, he had been expecting to see Harry as much as Harry had been expecting to see him.
Seb and the other men in the immediate vicinity laughed boisterously and clapped the man on the back. Gerald beamed at the attention and stumbled back a few steps, luckily landing on one of the bar stools. Harry was mentally deciding on what cab company to call to take Gerald home and when he’d have the time to do it.
Harry wanted to interrupt and to ask so many questions about Malfoy, the personification of a pure-blood Slytherin, going to a muggle shop and just
Harry’s hands jerked on the glass he was holding. “Um, excuse me?”
Malfoy nodded as he looked past Harry into the distance. Harry wondered if someone was there but he hadn’t heard the bell go so resisted the urge to turn around.
Harry should’ve known better. There must’ve been a reason he fit in with the group and it turned out he was the biggest pervert of them all.
Sometimes Harry thought the older wizarding families thought impoliteness was more important than sense. It made Harry want to laugh that the only thing stopping Malfoy discovering their little ploy and reporting them, definitely achieving his lifelong goal of getting him expelled, was his unwillingness to be impolite.
“Happy New Year, Potter,” Draco whispered.
“Eight!”
“That’s nothing new,” Malfoy said.
The group were silent for a moment as they processed that.
There were mumbles of agreement, the men nodding seriously at the well-made point with serious frowns on their faces.
“Alone?” was all he said out loud.
Malfoy straightened up. “
fantasies about Malfoy before. However, it wasn’t just physical attraction. If it was Harry wouldn’t be thinking too deeply about it. He was curious about Malfoy. He had always suspected that maybe Malfoy of all people understood him better than anyone else; they'd both had similar experiences in the war despite being on different sides and seen up close just what Voldemort was capable of. Even though his friends had suffered, they didn’t understand the obligation of having to fight and had volunteered. Malfoy certainly had not. Plus, Malfoy had never once treated Harry like he was Merlin’s gift to Wizardkind like the majority of the population which Harry needed.
“No, Ginny couldn’t make it because of work,” Harry said, sadly. He was pleased for Ginny, really he was, because she was doing what she loved with people she idolised. She deserved all the happiness and joy in the world after the horrors she faced during the war, but a part of him was bitter that he never saw her now. Their schedules conflicted and her training schedule was so intense she often didn’t arrive home until late or chose to stay with her teammates because she was too tired to travel. When they were together it was great; they still had the same passion they did in school, but it had matured, and the two of them were now simmering in a more steady and reserved love. They were no longer kissing like it was the last time or ripping each other’s clothes off whenever and wherever they could, they’d progressed into the next stage of simply enjoying being with each other, where they could do nothing together and be perfectly happy. At least, that’s what Hermione told him when he’d confessed he feared they were losing their spark. She wasn’t wrong, Harry did enjoy his quiet time with Ginny but those moments were increasingly rare, and he found himself wanting to get up and do things instead when Ginny was perfectly content to sit in his arms and listen to the wireless.
That you are bordering on breaking the Statute of Secrecy and risking knowledge of wizardkind escaping into the muggle world? That you are,” he gasped again, “
Malfoy nodded and started towards the door but stopped with his hand on the doorknob. He turned his head towards Harry and quirked his lips up.
The smile dropped off Malfoy’s face and for one terrified moment Harry thought he’d gone too far and scared him off. Then he caught the flush to Malfoy’s cheeks and his wide eyes and realised perhaps scared was the opposite of what Malfoy was feeling.
Harry could admit to himself that he was fishing for information. He wanted to know who Malfoy lived with, if he lived alone, if Harry could perhaps go round to see him or would he get laughed at or jumped by persistent and over-involved flatmates.
When Harry looked up, Malfoy was smiling softly at him. Harry’s lips tugged up shyly in response.
“Mike said you weren’t feeling well.”
“Ah, that famous Gryffindor spirit,” Malfoy said. Harry nodded, thinking Malfoy was complimenting them. “Always so self-sacrificing, separating so one of the pride can survive when in reality they’re stronger together. Now, they’re being led around Hogsmeade like lions to the slaughter.”
Harry knew he should look away and quickly go back to serving customers so when Malfoy did spot him it wouldn’t be to the embarrassing sight of Harry looking like a surprised fish with drool coming out of its mouth, but he couldn’t do it. His eyes were glued to Malfoy and he watched in horror as Malfoy turned slowly to see what his friend had wanted to show him and his gaze fell on Harry.
“Ex-girlfriend?”
It was as painfully awkward as Harry feared, but he chalked it up as a success that they hadn’t started screaming at each other across the bar and hadn’t yet resorted to hexing each other in a pub full of muggles and thus break the Statute of Secrecy. Progress.
Harry tried not to laugh. It wasn’t really a ‘big team’ game like Hermione seemed to think, but no doubt Ron had been chirping on about it for months and that’s where she got the idea. Of course, the truth didn’t matter because either way that would get to Ron. Screw crime and law and regulations, nobody kept the Canons from playing.
to work on their second busiest day of the year (St. Patrick’s Day was a mess) but had happily accepted it as they got the much-coveted day off. He enjoyed working and the celebrations he’d been invited to didn’t appeal to him. The Grand Ministry New Year’s Party? Sure, if he wanted to spend the evening being goggled at, coerced into making a speech or being forced to listen to a speech about him, and then spend the morning reading about his drunken escapades and humiliations in
Malfoy frowned at him. “I think I’d remember letting my sworn enemy and his ginger sidekick traipse into my sanctuary. Spells would fly.”
Harry licked his lips unconsciously. It was his favourite. It was cruel of Malfoy to dangle it in front of him when Harry couldn’t keep it. He wondered what Malfoy would do if Harry drank it before he could take it back.
She was a little worse off than when he’d seen her last. By this point she’d had quite a few potent cocktails.
“No.”
Seb raised a finger at him and said sternly, “He’s right, Harry. This ain’t no way to celebrate New Year’s…working.”
“I’m told you knew Draco in school?”
“As much as I love being your servant, Malfoy, why am I holding your drink?”
It seemed everyone in the county was in
“How did you get banned from The Three Broomsticks?” Harry asked incredulously. “I’ve never heard of anyone getting banned. Not even the twins after they set off four dungbombs and spiked the drinks with liquidised puking pastilles.”
Harry blinked in surprise. He’d known some of Malfoy’s housemates had known, they had too as it was a scheme that required more than just Malfoy to pull off, but not that all of them had.
What Harry really meant was ‘what was Malfoy, a wizard, doing searching for a muggle supermarket’ but he couldn’t exactly ask Bruce that, so instead he just gave an embarrassed shrug and handed Bruce his Vodkas.
“Oh, I have tried it. I’m banned from The Three Broomsticks and there’s not another pub in Hogsmeade so if I want a drink I have to be prepared to disinfect my robes.”
“Football?”
Malfoy seemed to sense Harry’s change in mood and stepped closer to him, clapping him on the shoulder with one hand and looking seriously into his eyes. “That’s alright.
A slow, creepy smile spread across Mike’s face and his eyes lit up the same way Ron’s did when he’d been offered food, only far more sinister. Harry realised he’d walked straight into a trap.
The best birthday present he received that year he didn’t know about until the next morning when the
“We live opposite that in the building with the horrid pink neon heart in the window.” His face screwed up in disgust, “Scarlett likes pink.”
just that amazing,” Malfoy said. “So you followed me to the common room?” Harry nodded. “How did you get in? It’s not like you could just stroll in, you’d need the password.”
“You both played sport for your houses? Same position?”
Before Harry could ask him to clarify what he was talking about, Malfoy smirked and gave him a two-fingered salute. “See you around, Scar-head.”
They walked over to a booth that had freed up not five minutes ago and Harry turned back to the boys at the bar. Gerald had started trying to blow beer bubbles through his nose, Jason was eyeing him with mild horror and a lot of curiosity, and Seb was poking a pretzel with a straw and glaring at it like it had stolen his alcohol. Harry was idly wondering if they’d make it to midnight or if he’d have to cut them off before then when he caught a flash of white-blonde hair in the corner of his eye.
Harry strode quickly down the cobblestones of Diagon Alley, his breaths coming out in pants and his eyes focusing steadfastly in front of him. He wasn’t
Harry startled a little and discovered he’d been hogging the cherry garnishes for the last few minutes. Silently, he handed them over to the other bartender.
Slowly, the puzzle pieces slotted together in Harry’s brain; not mentioning Hogwarts by name, referring to it in such a vague way, questioning its existence, and not knowing it taught only magical subjects. Now he was thinking about it, none of the group had reacted to him being Harry Potter either. They didn’t fight to come up to the bar to be the one to speak with him, none of them flung themselves at him or gushed over him or talked with him longer than necessary which wizards usually did with Harry. He’d not thought it was strange until now and had assumed they were treating him like that because they were friends with Malfoy, but they hadn’t sneered at him or given any indication they’d recognised him at all. He was just a random bartender they never intended to see again.
“Don’t bother coming in today.”
“Ten!”
“Hey, man. Will you do me a favour? When the hot blonde comes over let Harry serve him.”
“Ten seconds until midnight!” Terry shouted from nearby. The crowd cheered and started counting down.
He didn’t mean to sound ungrateful. He was ecstatic he’d survived a war with minimal physical scars and only deep-rooted mental ones, he was pleased with how after years of living with nothing at the Dursleys’ he now had the money and means to live comfortably, he was appreciative he had a stable job with the aurors lined up, and he was happy that he had such close friends, an adoptive family, and a wonderful loving girlfriend. What he hated was that his life was always on show.
“Animal houses?”
Mike shot one last look at Harry, “Think about what I said, Harry. You won’t be disappointed.”
“It’s one day, Hermione. The world won’t come crashing down around us.”
“Oh, it wasn’t that hard really,” Malfoy waved a hand lazily. “I just went through the old tunnels nobody uses anymore to avoid any witnesses in the lobby and the Welcome Witch. Not just because she’d record my presence, she has a crush on me so would definitely remember me being there. I cast a powerful disillusionment charm on myself so nobody would see me sneaking around, disabled the monitoring charms – which are really rather simple to crack, someone should raise that with the DMLE - and used the stairs to get around.”
Harry put a hand over his rapidly beating heart. “Malfoy. You scared the crap out of me.”
“Until I’ve finished your drinks.” Harry didn’t break eye contact from Mike as he slid his hand around a beer glass and, at a snail’s pace, dragged it towards him. He kept the same pace as he started filling the drink.
“Cassidy,” Harry greeted. “How are you?”
“Long story short,” Seb finished, “Harry wants to fuck him, so if you could kindly re-direct - Draco was it? – to Harry if he comes up to you, that would be swell.” He sat back and folded his arms.
“Please. People are going to be talking about this for weeks,” Harry said lightly, hiding the fact the thought that he’d subconsciously chosen Malfoy over his friends terrified him slightly. “They won’t remember it was my birthday until September. I can celebrate with Ron and Hermione at the weekend or something.”
Malfoy looked up and there was a strength in his eyes, a depth and clarify in them that hadn’t been there previously, as he focused intensely on Harry.
Malfoy laughed and the underlying worry Harry had that he’d be scared off by his story dissipated. “Not anymore,” he answered, quickly continuing before Harry could ask about that, “You’ve been working here all this time? Living nearby?” Harry nodded and Malfoy shook his head in disbelief, “It’s funny, we only live around the corner and I’ve never seen you here before.”
“Uh huh. Well, we should get to know each other, Harry. We need to if you’re gonna be screwing my best friend. Feel free to join us at any point tonight.”
was a very familiar look.
The smile on Malfoy’s face made Harry’s heart soar and the promise of seeing that again, of having Malfoy’s permission to hang out with him and laugh with him and talk with him, made him more excited and happier than he had been for a while. He was looking forward to it.
Jason snorted, “Yeah, right.”
you broke the school rules! Wait, no, I can. You broke rules more than you completed your potions’ essays. But this is a violation of everything sacred in house relationships! People can’t just be wandering into other houses’ common rooms casually, it’s disrespectful! Upsetting the peace and tranquillity and safety of their schoolmates’ haven! What if we’d been discussing something personal? What if we had been upset and having an emotional breakdown and needed support from our housemates?” His voice dropped to a whisper. “What if we’d been naked? I don’t want some idiot Gryffindork seeing my private parts.” Malfoy paused. “Unless he’s cute.”
Harry couldn’t tell if that was Malfoy trying to make the conversation about himself and prove to Harry how important he was – that reporters wanted his attention almost as much as they wanted Harry’s – or if it was genuine understanding, comradeship and empathy that made his expression so soft. In all honesty, Harry didn’t know where the two of them stood after the war and felt like they were on unsteady ground. It had never been complicated in school with their mutual rivalry and distaste of everything about each other, and it was a fairly easy relationship despite it being full of torments and spite and prejudice on both their sides. But you didn’t go through a war at 17, watch numerous people die, and end up saving each other’s lives without changing and that uncomplicated relationship transforming into something tangled and uncertain. Harry didn’t think either of them knew how to act around each other or what to expect anymore.
“Well, he first mentioned you when we were talking about secondary schools. Told us all about the snakes vs the lions and how there was this one boy he really didn’t get along with. Verbal insults, physical fights that got really bad, putting each other in the hospital wing, trickery, manipulation-”
Harry cleared his throat, “That’s, er, £17.84, please.”
“Hey! You’re back!” She grinned as she tottered up to the bar. “I missed you, Harry.”
It seemed that was all he was getting on that.
The most obvious difference was that the lips he was so used to seeing curled up in a sneer were parted and the corners curled up as he laughed at whatever the people with him were saying. Harry had never seen that expression on his face before.
“The brooms, all faulty ones the manufacturers just throw out. I asked if I could have them, they said yes. The insult charms…well, I perfected that particular charm in Fourth Year.” Malfoy grinned at him and Harry shook his head, smiling. “The Nifflers were a bit more complicated, but Millie – Millicent Bulstrode – works for a creature rescue charity, and they got wind of a smuggling ring; some wizards were snatching nifflers from the wild and selling them as ‘exotic pets’ to both wizards and muggles. Normally they’d inform the aurors, the aurors would go in wands blazing, and the nifflers would be stuffed in an evidence lockup for a while before either being released or given to Millie’s charity. I volunteered to liberate them early so we could get them to her faster rather than wait for the aurors.”
if you were found out, your reputation would be in tatters and you’d lose connections and respect and friendships. And why make all this effort for someone you barely see, let alone talk to? This must’ve taken
Harry turned his head to the side, his cheek pressed into the sticky bar top and sighed dramatically, self-pity seeping into him. He frowned as his eyes fell on a full pint glass sitting right where he left it. That wasn’t right; Malfoy had five drinks on his tray, Harry had counted, so why was there still one here? Had he forgotten it? Should Harry give it to one of the waitresses to take to his table?
No, Harry would rather spend his time getting paid to keep busy, hang around with people he liked and listen to some frankly bizarre conversations.
Harry wouldn’t admit that made him feel warm.
close to Harry for the last five years and they not run into each other. There was no way he and Malfoy had chosen the same area to live in, not when they were such different people with different lives and both seemed to have ended up living in the muggle world by chance.
They simply stared at each other for what felt like an age, neither of them breaking eye contact nor making a move to say anything either. They must’ve looked like a right pair, gormlessly watching each other from opposite sides of the room over the heads of numerous drunk dancing people oblivious to their surroundings.
Stupid Malfoy, always getting him into trouble.
Malfoy’s face lit up with a triumphant grin and Harry’s breath rushed out of him all at once. If he hadn’t been sure before, he was now; he wanted to see that expression on Malfoy’s face again and he wanted it directed at him.
“Nothing bad,” Harry replied vaguely.
Malfoy’s voice dragged him from his conflicted thoughts and Harry looked up to find Malfoy watching him expectantly. Harry looked down at the money, did a quick count, and glanced back up. “Yes.”
“Okay.”
Harry started laughing, and when Photo-Malfoy grinned at him he found he couldn’t stop, his laugh becoming louder and more uncontrollable. He bent over and started gasping for air as tears formed in his eyes. He thought he’d got himself under control but one glance at the paper had him starting all over again. He couldn’t remember the last time he laughed like that, where his stomach hurt and he couldn’t breathe, and the fact that it was because of Malfoy somehow made the situation even funnier.
“Oh, I see. The boarding school up in Scotland that taught specialised topics?”
“Just stuff about your fights. Finding out your greatest fear and dressing up as it to throw you off at a football match, making up some rather creative insults, breaking noses, getting his dad arrested, and one time when he was drunk he mentioned a wand fight in the girl’s bathroom that left him scarred for life.” Harry’s eyebrows jerked up in surprise and Mike nodded, “Yeah, he was really drunk. We assumed it was a euphemism and you actually just screwed but we’re not sure.”
“No?”
challenge, emotion, passion,
Well, yes, he had once or twice admired Malfoy when he was hot and sweaty after a Quidditch match and in the shower. But she didn’t need to know that.
Her shark-smile widened and she rattled off their order. Harry nodded and went about making the beverages, trying to avoid looking at her. If any of their group was going to bring up Malfoy it would be her.
And Harry could forget too. Forget what he’d lost, all the friends who couldn’t celebrate with him, and instead focus on what he still had.
“One day is all that matters. The backlog this is going to cause in the departments will be horrendous.” Ron didn’t seem to be taking it as seriously as Hermione wanted so she glared at him and her tone became sickly sweet, the one she usually reserved for when Ron was being stupid and an indication he was in serious trouble. “For instance, let’s say the employees of the Department of Magical Games and Sports can’t work for all of today and tomorrow. Isn’t there a game on Saturday between some big teams? That probably won’t go ahead now.”
“Much obliged,” Bruce said before heading back to the table.
Malfoy quietened down, still chuckling when he glanced directly at Harry’s face.
“Oh. Girlfriend?”
“Well enough. You?”
Harry threw up his hands. “I don’t know, Malfoy. It’s not like I encourage them.”
He slammed the door closed behind him, barely acknowledging the jingle of the bell above the door as he ducked down below the window and slid to the floor, panting heavily and feeling as though he’d run a marathon. He held his breath as the sound of screeching and footsteps stampeded past the door, only exhaling when the last shouts had faded.
stalked me on my actual birthday. And the anniversary of my parents’ death they caused a fire because they
And there was no doubt it was Malfoy. That hair colour only belonged to one family and Harry would recognise those delicate features and slim figure anywhere. He’d spent the entirety of his teenaged years with the menace, insults spewing from that pretty mouth and the gorgeous blonde locks messed up from fights or Quidditch matches. He looked a little different, his hair swept artfully to the side instead of slicked back like it had been back then, making him look more relaxed, and instead of long black robes, Malfoy was wearing tight-fitting ripped jeans and a shirt the clung to his chest to proudly display his muscles.
“I’m sorry, did you just say
After a quick glance up at the shop sign – Cador and Caliborne’s Curiosities, which yeah explained the sheep brains -, and a deep breath to steady his sudden nerves and silence the voice screaming in his head that this was creepy and a bad idea, Harry twisted the doorknob and entered the shop.
“Malfoy, um, yeah, sorry about that.” Harry shrugged and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Reporters.”
“Lots of built-up sexual tension by the sounds of it. How long did you say you’d known him Harry? Since you were eleven?”
available. You?” Harry flung back.
“So you’re both pretty flexible then?”
He blinked a couple of times before his attention was drawn to the owner of the fingers and he found the slightly concerned face of Seb.
Harry shook his head and headed happily to his bedroom to get ready.
Harry suddenly wanted to know
Something in Harry relaxed a little more at Malfoy’s words. He’d worried that they’d have to tiptoe around the subject of the war or it’d be tense due to their conflicting sides, but Malfoy’s casual mention of his probation made it clear he wouldn’t be offended by it. It didn’t mean all conversations on the topic would be comfortable, but the war had been such a huge part of both their lives it would be disastrous to any relationship if they couldn’t talk about it.
“Yo, Harry! What’s up? You feeling better?”
Harry didn’t know whether to be pleased or deeply offended.
Which added a huge, impossible question to Harry’s list: why was Draco Malfoy, a pureblood wizard from one of the oldest wizarding lines in the world, hanging out in a muggle pub on New Year’s Eve with muggle friends?
He’d be lying if he said he wasn’t looking forward to the moment Malfoy finally came up to him. Harry was self-aware enough to acknowledge he may have been a little too interested in Malfoy, borderline obsessed with him in sixth year. Malfoy had been a huge part of his life, perhaps just as much as Ron and Hermione, and if Harry was being honest it had taken a while to adjust to the lack of Malfoy in his life when school finished. Every time he said something stupid he expected a nasty laugh and insult to follow and was surprised when it didn’t. He’s not sure he’d say he’d missed the bastard, but he was definitely interested in finding out what he’d been up to, what he was like now, if he was still an arsehole…
Harry considered his expression carefully for any trace of deceit and found none.
And then the dangerous questions. What was Malfoy like now? He seemed relaxed and reasonable with his gang, and acted like an actual decent human being, but was that reserved for them or was he like that with everyone? Was it all an act? Could he ever act like that with Harry? Could they be friends? What would he think of Harry? Was he suffering the same fate as Harry right now? Questions running through his brain with no answers? Did Harry want to talk to him? Did he want to get to know him better? Did he want to-?
“Is that because it’d be a busman’s holiday, your work colleagues would never shut up about it, you don’t think a pub is a great first date location, or you’re too socially inept to get a partner?”
Malfoy nodded, “That was a bit of a challenge. The sardines were easy, I just went to a muggle shop and got them, no questions asked. I mean, I got some odd looks, but that might’ve been my stunning good looks. Or the fact I went in robes.”
him if he acknowledged how much he’d revealed to Harry and how he’d lost his mask; he would see it as a sign of weakness, that he had left himself vulnerable in front of Harry, an ex-rival. If Harry wanted to keep the conversation and their cordial relationship going, he would have to ignore that and distract him; steer them towards more stable territory, somewhere Malfoy felt safe.
“You know the fit leggy blonde you served when Harry was having a meltdown in the back? Sitting at table 9? He’s with the girl in the hot pink dress, you can’t really miss him?”
Realising he’d been caught, Malfoy quickly glanced away and focused on a point just to the left of Harry’s head as he cleared his throat and shifted from foot to foot restlessly.
“What happened to the rest of your little crew?”
Bruce was next. His hair wasn’t as styled as it was before and he’d lost the blazer.
“Er...some. Not too many.”
He wetted his lips and started cautiously, “When me and Ginny broke up, I…had a bit of a meltdown.”
Harry stilled, his mind flashing back to a year ago when he’d said a very similar thing to Malfoy as they hid in that dark alley: how every year reporters and fans ruined his birthday and he wanted a year free of that so he could spend it with his loved ones. And then Malfoy’s response…
Harry’s heart felt like it was going to pound out of his chest. He passed that window every Saturday when he went to pick up his dinner from that takeaway. Malfoy had been close the entire time and he hadn’t even realised it.
thinking I want to join your fan club. How do I sign up? Is it like a newsletter or something?”
Sensing Harry was uncomfortable, Mike thankfully changed the direction of the conversation.
“Six!”
By this point Harry had worked out that Malfoy’s little group were taking it in turns to buy rounds, though only a couple had been served by Harry. Harry knew that couldn’t continue for the whole night and eventually Malfoy would be in front of him. Each time they finished a round, Harry would panic that Malfoy would be the next to rise and approach him. He was always caught somewhere between relieved and disappointed when it didn’t happen. Each time it wasn’t it made it more likely that next time it would be and Harry felt like his life was on a countdown determined by the amount of beer in a glass. During one round he’d actually filled their table’s glasses with as much as possible to delay the inevitable but when half of it had slopped out all over the floor on the return journey he’d decided it wasn’t worth the clean-up.
The two of them stared at each other and for the second time that night it felt like the world around them didn’t exist. Harry was certain – and he thought Malfoy was too – that the two of them could be great together,
Harry’s eyes widened, “No, no, no, I can still work! Don’t send me out back!”
Harry jumped and swore, spinning on his heel away from the grimy wall he was hiding behind to come face to face with a smirking Malfoy. Even in the shadows of the alley Harry had taken refuge in Malfoy stood out, his blonde hair appearing silver in the moonlight and surrounding him like a halo.
, Harry thought.
“I can be sneaky.”
“Harry! How would you say this year compares to last year’s celebrations? Are they more joyful now people have recovered from the war?”
to see. Harry noticed he was a lot colder to others.
He didn’t know why he felt the need to explain himself. It was Malfoy; he didn’t care.
Bruce hummed, “Yeah, we are.”
“Sorry,” Harry said sheepishly, fidgeting with discomfort. “You just…never seemed that close.”
Ron nodded in agreement. “At least they aren’t focusing on your birthday this year, Harry. They’ve got bigger things to worry about. Maybe we can actually go out tonight and have a peaceful year.”
“Is Girl-Weasley not around to back you up?” Malfoy asked, subtly running his sleeve over his eyes to wipe away the tears of laughter that had gathered there.
“You remembered! I’m flattered.”
“Nine!”
Malfoy snorted. “No. Come on, Potter, you know me better than that. You think I would lower myself to rolling around in the dirt? I had enough trouble getting it out of my hair after Herbology, I didn’t need it in other, more intimate, places.”
Harry smiled before going into a small lecture about the unlikelihood of a sixteenth-century English monarch knowing a Victorian serial killer.
There was silence for a few moments as Malfoy cast his mind back, trying to identify the incident Harry was talking about. Harry saw the moment he remembered as his eyes widened comically and he pointed an accusing finger at Harry.
The sudden pop of a cork flying out a champagne bottle and the raucous cheers of what appeared to be half the ministry drowned out his long-suffering sigh. Some stranger who Harry vaguely recognised as a member of the wizengamot who had been at his trial in 5
“Ugh, there’s no in-between with Draco. He either dates boring, vanilla guys who are as interesting as a spade or complete freaks.” She looked him up and down. “Don’t worry, honey. I can assure you, you’re just his type.”
Harry squeaked.
Harry smiled and shook his head in amusement. He loved the completely wacky turns conversations could take when people lost their inhibitions.
“Sorry about that,” Malfoy said as he plonked himself back on his stool behind the counter. “A customer has requested a rather complicated and unique potion to be brewed, and my boss would kill me if I messed it up. Even if I was distracted by Our Mighty Saviour.” Malfoy grinned at him again.
Malfoy drummed his fingers on the counter and tilted his head to the side, likely considering whether that was close enough to give Harry a chair to the face.
The honesty rang true in his voice, the depth of his tone and the seriousness in his eyes making it very hard for Harry to think Malfoy was lying.
“Been lusting at him from afar all night,” Gerald piped up, ignoring Harry’s interruption, “but hasn’t been able to talk to him yet because when he came up to the bar you served him.”
Eventually, Harry finished pulling the last pint and reluctantly placed it down on the bar in front of Malfoy.
“Hi guys! I’m back. Are you all good for now or did you need a top up?”
He lets out a disgruntled groan. His magic is restless at the moment, likely a result of having spent too much time around the elektrisity that Muggles used to power their lights. It tends to work magic up, and vice versa.
He briefly flirts with the idea of trying a warming charm for the apartment, but it’s not a serious consideration. Why potentially waste an extinguisher when he now has a perfectly warm library available to him instead?
He spends several hours there, reading theory and running through the practice exercises in the book. They’re not spells, not really, just exercises to learn to handle his magic better, and they’ve nothing to do with heat besides, so he’s not particularly worried about starting fires. They are, after all, designed for beginners, and therefore start small. A pleasant result of this, he finds, is that he’s not exhausted or hungry after practicing. Well… okay, he is hungry because he’s always hungry, but he’s not more so than usual.
It hadn’t been a dream. He really is anonymous.
He doesn’t allow himself to fall asleep this time – he has no desire to embarrass himself in front of Potter again – so whenever he feels himself drifting off, he takes a walk out into the little side street and entertains himself by trying out some of the new notions that he’s learning. These excursions never last too long, because it’s still bloody freezing out there, but he’s cold-woken and newly eager to delve further into his study when he returns.
Potter smacks him on the shoulder. “Arse!” He laughs. “Teach me something else then, I’m done being a penguin.”
“Alright, Mr. Sass, just go sit down,” he says. Draco smirks but turns to comply, while Potter approaches the counter. He hears, from behind him, the girl at the counter saying “Harry! Back so soon?”, and Potter answering with something too quiet for Draco to hear.
“Throw in a bagel and I’ll consider it,” he decides, and Potter’s eyes light up.
They play a little game of cat and mouse for a while, if the mouse were taunting the cat by darting around him just out of reach, until Potter gets worn out and returns to his bench. Draco skates up to him, cocking his head to the side.
Forsythe scowls deeply. “Do you think this is St-bloody-Mungoes?” He snaps. “I’m not your personal servant Malfoy. You can bloody well deal with this shit yourself!” Draco stares into his reddened face, and swallows down his frustration.
Draco shakes his head, forcing the memory away before his suspiciously wet eyes spill over. He can’t think of his parents – not in public at least, where anyone can see his tears. Instead he pushes his way into the library, a wave of warm air rising to meet him and bringing with it the smell of parchment, leather, and wax.
He opens his eyes after a moment, sighing into the calm of the night as his stomach rumbles restlessly. He smiles slightly. He’ll have something better than stale toast tonight at least.
Potter peers at his book and raises an eyebrow. “Wandless magic?” He asks, sounding impressed. Draco wonders if he’d be impressed if he knew the reason that Draco is learning wandless magic, that he’s too pathetic to have either a wand or a heated apartment. His cheeks flush pink with embarrassment, and he looks down at his book to avoid meeting Potter’s eyes.
The woman looks up and catches sight of Draco. “Excuse me,” she rasps. “do you have any money for food? Please, we haven’t eaten in days!”
s, as he goes. He settles into the same armchair with his book, ready continue where he’d left off yesterday – applying the control he’d learnt in the previous section to simple spells.
“Well…I’m trying to learn wandless magic so…” Draco fibs. “To encourage myself to use it, I…left my wand at home.” Potter stares at him incredulously, and Draco worries for a moment that he’s going to call him out on his ridiculous story. What wizard just leaves their wand at home?
“Hello?” He calls out, turning in a circle. “Is someone there?”
He can tell Potter is trying, but this isn’t much easier. Winter has been the worst part of the year for the past eight years for Draco. With neither a heated apartment nor a wand, it is always a struggle just to stay warm. There have been years when it was so bad that Draco was sure he would die.
Potter snorts a short laugh and shoves it further toward him. “I know Emory. I didn’t expect you to. Just open it?”
Draco preens. “Ah, to have bested a penguin,” he says dramatically. “Truly, there is no greater hon- ack!” He wiggles away just in time as Potter grabs at him again. Potter is grinning deviously. “Ah, he’s being sneaky!” Draco says with a smirk. “I thought you Gryffindors were supposed to be the upright, honest sort,”
“Let me,” he says, draping the scarf about Draco’s neck and sliding the toque over his hair. Draco looks up at him, eyes wide, and Potter meets his gaze steadily. His cheeks are flushed red against his bronzed skin, his hair thick and tousled, and those lovely green eyes are bright, reflecting the warm yellow lights that decorate the park. Draco feels his heart skip and he quickly looks away, cheeks reddening.
He glances wildly around but doesn’t catch sight of them – they’re somewhere else in the library – and he’s already half out of his seat and considering how best to make a break for it before his mind catches up with him. He pauses, taking a calming breath. Right, he’s being a fool again. They won’t recognize him. To them, he’s just a stranger in a library.
Draco smiles. “I like jolly,” he says, watching the lights of the nearest house twinkle. That, at least, has always been true. Granted, the décor at the Manor was far more extravagant than this, but he’s learnt to appreciate simple things too.
Ugbert slides over the potion bottle and collects his Galleons. “A pleasure doing business with you,” he says with his sleazy smile.
Potter growls and lunges for him, but Draco twists out of the way with a laugh. “You’ll have to try harder than that,” he teases.
Draco flushes, embarrassed. He doesn’t want Potter to know how pathetic he is, having not even a wand to his name. But Potter is looking at him expectantly.
Draco stares at him in disbelief. “A Minor Wiggenweld? That’s overkill Ugbert. Don’t you have a simple Healing Potion?”
His magic swells out into the room, gently caressing his skin with heat. Then it surges, blasting through his fumbling attempts to keep a hold on it and leaping out into the room. Draco stumbles back with a cry, falling back against the wall as the curtains across the room erupt into flames.
“Right…yes, I was rather immersed,” Draco agrees, closing the book around one finger. He looks at Potter expectantly, wondering what the man wants.
Nor can he go to most of the nearby potions shop, Forsythe’s own included. Most sellers charge him exponentially more than the items actually cost, and Forsythe delights himself being among them.
He finds his usual book, double-checks the index to make sure that it covers spell potency, and then carries it back to his armchair. He means to study until Potter arrives, but he only gets about three hours in before his interrupted sleep and the warmth of the library get to him.
Hunger is urging his stomach into revolt by now, so he quickly fixes himself a plain cheese sandwich and sits in his lone chair to eat it. It’s not a lot, but it sates the worst of the pangs in his stomach and he’s not about to use up more food than he needs to.
“I’ve been to Muggle London before,” Draco replies, indignant. He doesn’t mention that the vast majority of his trips have been to one mostly empty street.
“No need to worry, I’m perfectly fine.” He says. “Shall we go?”
“Who are you?” He asks.
He’s having fun making little sparkle fireworks when he looks up and sees Harry Potter standing there and staring at him. He lets out a surprised squawk, the sparkles fizzling out unceremoniously.
He watches curiously as a handsome dark-haired man yells at a pretty dark-haired woman. They don’t seem to get along. Draco feels terrible for them being trapped in that portrait together. He wonders if the subject of Muggle portraits can move between pictures as well. Maybe one of them should escape to another device.
Malfoy frowned, “Honestly, I’m surprised you came here rather than make the most of it. I thought you’d be out drinking yourself into a coma or more likely getting food poisoning at the Hog’s Head with your entourage whilst you could, rather than sitting in this little shop with me.”
Harry broke first as someone started clicking their fingers in his face and snapped him back to reality.
“Hello? Am I interrupting something?”
“Yes, I’m aware of her skills,” Malfoy said, smiling at him reassuringly. There was no judgement in those eyes, nothing to indicate that Malfoy would spill his secrets to anyone nor laugh at him for them.
Malfoy snorted and turned back to Gerald, “What else did they talk about?”
Roger studied Mike’s face for a few seconds. The man wasn’t stupid; he’d worked in pubs too long to not be able to tell when he was being told only part of a story. Harry may not have seen Mike’s onslaught coming, but he doubted Roger would be fooled by the man’s supposed innocence.
“Did I get it right?”
Ron held up
Malfoy choked and that was all the vindication Harry needed. He gave Malfoy a smug look and folded his arms.
Harry dropped the glass he was holding and it smashed all over the floor into tiny pieces.
“That stupid bird nearly killed me!”
Malfoy suddenly frowned, “Didn’t you break up with Weasley like five years ago now?”
And if he was seeing anyone.
“Well, I’ll leave that for you to find out for yourself. Of course,” he continued, “Draco’s also painfully shy and insecure about his body, even though he really doesn’t need to be. The blush that appeared when he was bare spread all over his face and down his chest making him look somehow adorable and sexy at the same time. He needs someone strong and confident to take control in bed and reassure him I think.” He paused and looked Harry over, “You should take him into the loos right now and do that. You look like someone who’d be perfect for him.”
It was a good point, but the truth was Harry had
“What is it?” Harry asked, hoping he didn’t sound too relieved and failing if the look Hermione shot him was any indication.
“And you’re sitting talking one-on-one with Draco Malfoy in a dusty old shop without exchanging insults,” Malfoy said calmly. “I don’t think any of us saw that coming.”
“You think he’s attractive?” Seb asked.
He dragged his eyes away from Malfoy for what felt like the millionth time that night and topped up Jason’s glass, receiving a crooked smile in thanks.
“I didn’t…I haven’t…we hated each other. I haven’t seen him in years.”
“Oh?” Malfoy said, leaning forward so he was centimetres from Harry’s face. He looked up at Harry through his eyelashes, a smirk dancing on his lips and his tone dropping low. “Who’s going to tell them?”
But he wasn’t ashamed, and he was attracted to Malfoy. He
“Sure.”
Harry scrambled to catch it and with mounting curiosity started to read.
“Um. What?”
“Do you want to dissect all that emotional baggage and explore those complicated feelings?”
“Hey, I’m a ministry employee!”
But he was the defeater of the Dark Lord, the most-evil wizard of all time, and had fought in a war; he would not be cowed by a twenty-something year old woman in heels so sharp he was pretty sure she could impale someone if she tried.
of it. When threatened, we join together and fight for each other, because usually nobody else will.”
They were all things that had come up in conversations he’d had with Malfoy, or something they’d done in school. Harry distinctively remembered Malfoy’s skill with charms when he made those ‘Potter Stinks’ badges in Fourth Year, so it was within his capabilities. Plus, Malfoy had the money, imagination, and sheer determination – some may say stubbornness - to pull it off. Then of course there was his vindictive streak a mile long.
“Two!”
He wasn’t that lucky.
“Oh, and Happy Birthday, Potter.”
Harry raised a challenging eyebrow and lowered his voice, “Yeah? What you gonna do about it, Malfoy? Punish me?”
“No, even in private you were all distant,” Harry said with a frown. “In the Gryffindor common room we’d play games with each other, study with each other, chat openly by the fireplace and help the other years. You sat quietly in your little groups and read silently.”
article about the breakup of a celebrity couple, not to mention anything to do with ‘the destroyer of darkness and saviour of wizardkind,’” Malfoy said. Harry snickered. “Granger?”
“Always,” Malfoy repeated his own words back to him.
they were his fears) just so Harry could have a decent birthday,
Harry was so desperate he seriously considered it. Ron would be screaming at him that it was another dastardly trap and how a leopard couldn’t change its spots, and Hermione might possibly be hurt that he’d go to a once-enemy rather than his friends. But it was just that: Malfoy
Harry stared at him.
“Hi,” he greeted, giving Malfoy a shy smile of his own, “What can I do for you?”
He wasn’t ashamed of his sexuality or any of his partners, but damn that was inappropriate. Luckily for him, Bruce seemed to know when to call it quits, grinned, ordered, and took his tray back to the table where him and Felicity immediately huddled together for a hushed conversation.
he’d blown it. Whenever Malfoy was involved, things never turned out the way Harry planned and why should that stop now they were adults.
Just as Harry was thinking maybe nobody else would come in - it had been more than half an hour since the last customer had entered - a cold blast of wintery air hit him as the main door opened. He groaned quietly before casting a quick glance in that direction. Five people, three men and two women by the looks of it, all young. Harry wondered if they’d be trouble; if they wanted to be drunk by midnight, which a lot of people their age did, they’d have to drink a lot very quickly. The women were not dressed for the Winter weather in short cocktail dresses and heels with not even a cardigan between them. The men were a little better, with two of them carrying jackets and one wrapped up in a scarf and hat. Harry immediately designated that one as his favourite; he couldn’t stand people who prioritised fashion over practicality and this one seemed to have some sense to him.
“You ran into a suit of armour. Twice.”
“Can I help you?”
It was like a countdown. Every time one of them stood to buy a round was one step closer to Malfoy’s turn. Eventually there was only one left.
Harry turned sharply back to Malfoy and found him looking at Harry with amusement and clearly trying not to laugh. Harry wanted to slam his head onto the bar again so nobody could see his face. “It was practically his hobby in school.”
“Oi! What happened to protecting me!” Harry yelled after him, trying to sound serious and keep the smile out his voice.
Harry’s head snapped around to find ten young women rushing towards him and realised too late that he’d given away his position.
Malfoy cleared his throat, “Do you live there alone? No…flatmate?”
Malfoy grinned and the tension eased.
Harry turned to Malfoy to ask what he was shopping for when his eyes fell on his chest.
Roger considered Harry’s pale face carefully, “Maybe you should take your break a little early tonight, Harry.”
Malfoy leaned back and away from Harry, and Harry felt the loss.
“Because
She sidled up to the bar and rested her arm on the sticky top without flinching, smiling at Harry in a way he was sure was supposed to be semi-sweetly but instead made her look like a hungry shark.
“We have
Harry could hear his stupid laugh all the way across the room and whenever he looked over at the table Malfoy’s face was always lit up in happiness or his hands were waving animatedly as he told a story. He didn’t look like the same stuck-up, stiff bully he’d been. He’d nod along, listening intently when someone was talking to him and at one point Harry saw him throw an arm around the shoulders of one of the guys and pull him into a hug. Harry pushed down the irrational jealousy that reared its head. There was no reason for it. Him and Malfoy weren’t friends or anything; did he really feel possessive over the twat just because he’d been such a huge part of Harry’s life?
Malfoy smirked and again Harry’s focus was drawn to his lips, “You gonna report me, Potter?”
“Er…Harry?” Jason said.
“Um…can you repeat the question?”
“Well,” he said carefully, trying to think of a way to say what he was thinking without offending Malfoy and getting splinters in his face. “You’re not known for your loyalty.”
Harry blinked at her for a moment in confusion. Why was that a question? Didn’t everyone know Hogwarts? It was the only wizard school in the country, where else would he be referring to? And why was she talking about it in such an odd way? He guessed that was what Hogwarts was in very generic terms but that was overly cryptic for no reason. Sure, there were muggles around and wizards always needed to be careful with what they said around them, but not
“I don’t know if you remember, Potter, but 16-year-old me was a little liberal with the
Malfoy tilted his head to the side as he considered him before nodding his head in a wordless signal for Harry to continue.
They all claimed to know him but they didn’t.
Ginny had been stolen away by the Captain of the Holyhead Harpies, hopefully to apologise for her chaser’s ‘seduction’ of Ginny’s boyfriend. Luna was stood near a flower arrangement by the double doors, whispering to the plants with a good-looking young man watching her with wide, awestruck eyes. Seamus and Dean were snogging in a corner that also hosted many other couples making out like they weren’t at a public function. Neville was surrounded by fans as he recounted his heroic tales – or more likely, he was giving them comprehensive instructions on how to properly harvest valerian sprigs. Ron had strolled away without even a goodbye the moment he saw the buffet table and Hermione had only lasted half an hour more before she’d disappeared into the crowd. A quick glance over the heads in front of him and around the room showed her nodding with a frown on her face as a stuffy-but-important-looking witch spoke to her, probably about something Harry wouldn’t understand.
“Good morning,” he replies, waving his hello. That’s the extent of their daily conversation, so he goes on to browse the shelves.
With a put-upon sigh, Draco throws himself dramatically onto his bed. He lays there a moment, staring blankly at the ceiling as he tries to ignore the hunger pangs striking at his stomach. Eventually he pulls out the novel again, flicking through it restlessly. It’s not the kind of story he would have normally picked up, but the kid in his heart who still yearns for a happy ending resonates with the tale of the heroine, beating her situation against all odds and getting the man of her dreams.
When he opens them again, Potter is watching him with his impossibly warm green eyes.
Potter proves surprisingly easy to talk to, a notion that once would have sent Draco into a conniption. He’s always thought the man fit, but now as he sits chatting with him, he finds that his company is honestly pleasant as well. The afternoon passes faster than he realises, and by the time they get up to leave, the sun is hanging low and painting the sky bright with colour.
“Very well, let me check my inventory,” he says, stepping around the counter. Draco waits impatiently as he ducks down and inspects the wears in the lower shelves. “I can sell you a Minor Wiggenweld for twelve Galleons,” he eventually offers, straightening up with the bottle of potion in hand.
“Hello dear,” she returns, giving him a warm smile. Draco returns the smile and then makes his way to his usual corner, humming his favourite traditional carol,
But no. Draco shakes his head. That is child’s talk. There is no such thing as wish magic. Probably, he’d just overexerted himself casting that last healing charm, and he’s actually sleeping right now and having a particularly realistic dream. Frowning, Draco reaches down and pinches his inner elbow. “Ouch”, he hisses – no, that hurts, he probably isn’t dreaming. Perhaps he’d just stepped into the Alley at a time where everyone passing by just happened not to know of him or his role in the war? Ugbert must have had some other reason not to try to grope Draco, or extort him for extra coin – maybe there had been an inspector in the back room or- or-
Draco stares at him, and Potter looks back, unrepentant. “Potter you-” Draco cuts himself off and sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose. Potter is tilting his head and giving Draco those beseeching kicked-Crup eyes. This is a terrible idea. “Fine,” he sighs. “Just for a little while.”
Not wanting to risk the spell wearing off, Draco hops quickly out of bed and rushes through his shower. He pulls on his clothes and his outdoor gear, shuddering at the cold fabric.
“Let’s go then,” he mutters, turning back to the rink.
“You should have said so sooner!” Exclaims a very dismayed Potter once he catches sight of Draco’s trembling legs. The stumble off the ice together and Potter charms their shoes back to normal before, without warning, picks Draco up in a princess lift.
Draco blushes, but meets his eyes steadily. Potter’s gaze is dark and intense, and Draco feels an answering heat burning in his gut. This is too dangerous. Abort, he has to abort.
“My apologies Mr. Forsythe,” Draco says, keeping his tone deferent. He holds up his hands, displaying his bloodied palms. “I don’t want to handle the ingredients with bloodied hands, so I was hoping you could heal them?”
it says, “
Potter, for some reason, laughs. “Here?” He says. “No, I don’t. It’s the nearest ice rink that I know of, that’s all.” He pauses and looks around contemplatively. “It’s a nice area though,” he offers. “Very jolly.”
“In that case, thank you for your charity,” he replies primly. “Truly. I’ll remember it to the day I die.” And okay, that might be a little more on the nose than he’s comfortable with, but it’s not as if Potter knows how much his company actually means to Draco.
Ugbert is not dissuaded by his aloofness. “Good, good,” he says instead, running his knuckles down Draco’s cheek. Draco twitches, but resists pulling away. He’s learnt that lesson, knows what is expected of him here if he is to get anything he’s looking for.
Draco chuckles lightly, pushing down the bittersweet memories as he pulls his hand back and tucks it into his pocket. “Oh no,” he says. “I’m terribly undomesticated Potter. I manage to boil water well enough, and you simply cannot expect more of me than that.”
“That’s terrible,” Potter says. He looks guilty. “I never realised-”
Potter laughs, though, and his face clears of its embarrassed flush. He throws one of those muscular arms around Draco’s shoulders. “And you called me the odd one,” he says, his voice oddly fond. “Come on then. Let’s get a move on.”
“You can keep skating,” he says. “I’m just taking a little breather. You do more of your fancy tricks, they were fun.”
He’s meant to meet Potter today for ice skating, and he shivers at he very prospect. Hopefully, the weather warms up by then – his clothes aren’t all too warm as it is, and skating about at any speed is sure to make it worse. It would be terribly embarrassing if he has to beg off skating early because he’s cold.
Potter steps up beside him and turns a warm smile on him. “What would you like to drink?” He asks, gesturing to the menu written in chalk behind the front counter. Draco looks over to it, but there are so many options – the board is covered completely with cutesy writing declaring the names of various drinks – that he can’t decide. Tea is a treat for Draco these days.
FF.NET: The-Angst-Chronicles
Draco scrambles out of bed, tripping over his blanket in his haste to scramble out of his apartment and out into Knockturn. He strikes a fast clip up the Alley, anticipation and apprehension swirling in his gut in a stomach-turning mix.
Thankfully the street is busy enough that when Draco glances over his shoulder, he catches no sight of Potter. He slows to a more reasonable place, letting out a relieved sigh. Inappropriate crush aside, it’s best that he not get too close to Potter. Certainly, Potter won’t recognize him on sight alone.
