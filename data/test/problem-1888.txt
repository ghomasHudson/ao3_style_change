“I’m fine, Potter,” Draco pretended to be absorbed in the contemplation of the new cauldrons displayed in the shop window. The skating rink incident still stang. He wished Harry wouldn’t bring it up.
“Then why don’t you tell me all about it in an interview, Potter?”
Do you know who’s firecalling us?”
Draco pushes himself off Harry’s body, lifts his head just enough to give his colleagues what Harry guesses is his best murderous glare.
doesn’t it?
“Isn’t it what we’re being paid for? Solving cases?” Harry half-smiled. There was something about Malfoy’s hesitancy that asked for gentleness.
A blurry photograph taken across the street from an elegant London building.
Harry was standing in the middle of Draco’s bedroom now, torn between exasperation and laughter. “Is this how Ron and Hermione ended up with an invitation to your small, subdued, friends-only dinner party?”
I couldn’t believe my eyes. You were so…” His hand slides further down Draco’s hip, the other one lifts to the side of his neck. “…so fucking beautiful, I couldn’t believe it was you, until I remembered—” Draco hears him swallow against his neck, and his own throat is tight, his breath is short, his heartbeat is thrumming in his skull, loud like static. He wants Harry to come closer,
He touched the tip of his index to one of the small, round, white contraptions that Harry had worn in his ears when Draco had entered the common room. Harry seemed to jolt out of a trance. Regretfully, Draco watched his hand retreat into his lap.
Draco’s cock, when he lowers down the layers of trousers and boxers to reveal it, is as beautiful as he remembers it: long, thinner than his, pale and pink and glistening at the tip. So hard for Harry. He breathes in the salty, musky smell of it, and earns another strangled whimper from Draco.
Eyes wide, he stumbles to the jacket he carelessly threw across the back of a chair when he walked in. It’s the one he was wearing that day — one he’d forgotten about, what with all the developments the case brought to his life, had left hanging in his cupboard for months. He slips his hand inside the inner pocket, feels around for a folded piece of parchment, finds it.
“And what am I supposed to do about that?” Draco asks. His voice is too thin to carry a challenge.
Harry takes his lips off the collar he’s been unbuttoning, and looks up at Draco with a half-smile. Draco is already pink, lips red and gleaming from Harry’s kisses, his breath shallow and fast. He looks utterly debauched just from kissing, and Harry wants to push him harder, bring Draco’s pale complexion and haughty expression to new heights of ‘I've been so thoroughly fucked I can barely move.’
But… But Harry wouldn’t— He’s not that kind of bloke. He can’t— He can’t let a man suck him off… can he? He looks down through the blur of thundering need, to the place where Malfoy’s fingers hover. Harry looks at the bulge of his cock tenting his pants, so close to Malfoy’s face… to Malfoy’s
MILLICENT.
he thought—”and I might never become one. But I want to try.”
“I shall try to do better in my next home, then.”
ringing loud and clear in the foyer.
Draco sat back in the armchair behind him and marvelled at her, at the thin translucent wings the colour of Scottish heather.  He tentatively stroked her scales and they felt smooth, almost pebbly. She made a cute burbling noise and then curled her tail around Draco's wrist like a scaly Slytherin bracelet. It felt sort of possessive like when Ron’s newborn Rose gripped his finger. Tamara snuggled her snout into Draco’s palm and began to lick it with her rough, dry tongue. Tiny, dainty, fastidious licks, this way and that, that made his eyes prickle with tears.
“That’s what the clerk suggested. What’s wrong with her?”
believe it.
He quietly steps out of the box while the last act of the ballet plays out. Malfoy had been right: the spectators are too entranced to pay Harry any mind. He finds himself alone in the silent corridors of the opera house. The nightly stillness sends a shiver down his spine. The place is warm, low-ceilinged and padded, Tchaikovsky’s epic chords echoing from the closed doors leading to the orchestra. The sense-memory brings Harry back to Hogwarts. He recalls the corridors past curfew, the thrill of sneaking around unnoticed. The corner of Harry’s mouth lifts in a wry little smile when he remembers he was after Malfoy half the times, even back then.
“Ahem.”
Draco took a sip of his pumpkin juice to avoid everyone’s eyes. Hermione Granger had the name of a Greek goddess and the will of a Roman general. He was as admirative of her as he was scared of her. Sometimes, he could swear he still felt the sting of the slap she’d given him in third year. He never wanted to be on the wrong side of her anger again.
“Oh?” Draco looked up,. “You're not into redheads?”
“Yes. I’ve been thinking about it for a while. I’d like to work with him and his R&D team to test joint wizarding and Muggle cures. There are still so many diseases that Muggles and magical people have not yet managed to tackle on their own. Until recently, the Unspeakables were not open to the idea of taking inspiration in Muggle science in general, or in the field of medicine and magical maladies specifically. But I think it would be an incredible opportunity. No other company in the wizarding world has the R&D power that Caduceus has. Or reputation, or morals.
Then they'd vanished.
Malfoy’s mouth lifts at the corner in acknowledgment. “My wife’s,” he says, but doesn't elaborate. He walks around his desk and sits, gesturing at Harry. “Take a seat.”
“Merlin, yes,” Harry gasped as he fell backward onto the bed, landing gently and smiling back at Draco through heavy lidded eyes.
Draco moans into the kiss when Harry’s thumbs slide down to the side of his jaw, his palms cupping Draco’s face. Harry takes his bottom lip between his teeth and pulls — it’s more teeth than Draco’s used to, but he’s not going to complain. Harry pulls back once more, and this time his eyes lift to Draco’s — all wide and stunned behind slightly fogged spectacles.
They hesitated at the threshold of the cabin, its interior pitch black and unknown, but the storm made the decision for them. There was a gust of wind so violent they swayed on the spot. Snow started falling around them—a
“It seems neither your house-elf nor your son have the potential to be Bond villains, either,” Harry tells him.
“I knew you’d done something to them,” Harry chokes as he feels Malfoy’s hand move between his legs. His palm presses against Harry’s erection — fuck, god, he’s already so hard — and Malfoy gives a contented little sound from the back of his throat. Harry needs to be certain that they’re safe, before they go— before they go any further. “And— the sound?”
Thinking rationally is the best he can do to save whatever’s left to save. If he snaps now…
“His house-elf. Ernestina. And I hardly think we can hold the legality of it against him. What we’re doing is barely legal itself.”
“I— Potter,” he says, and there’s something akin to regret in his tone. He pushes Harry off him, so gently it almost doesn’t feel like a rebuttal. “I’ve got to go.”
Harry nods alongside Draco. Nobody can say no to birthday cake.
“Like what you see, don’t you?” he gritted out, though he couldn’t tell who had the hottest view between him and Malfoy.
“Ernestina Apparated home before I left the Ministry,” Draco says. Harry lifts his eyebrows. “She was… not in a good state. She must have gone straight to her rooms… she must have thought going to see Scorpius would only upset him more.”
“These? Oh. They’re headphones.”
“Yeah, sorry.”
Draco’s fists clench against his sides, like he wants to reach out and grab the parchment, but forces himself to stand still. He still looks beautifully dishevelled, loose locks of pale gold hair falling in his eyes, and Harry’s heart skips a painful beat.
You —
if he was completely honest with himself. The very concept of Harry loving Draco forever was utterly preposterous and improbable.
Harry huffed a breath. “You don’t need to
a sleeping dragon,” Draco said drily, “but yes, I suppose the sentiment is the same.” He gave Harry's hand a squeeze back.
And there are a ton of work-related topics to pick from.
Thing is… you’re explicitly mentioned in the bet.
whatever
“Say it. I want to hear you say it.”
Although Harry couldn’t be sure. The Malfoys did own an insane amount of British land.
That he, too, likes men.
“Fine! Fair enough! As a journalist, I deserve your distrust,” Draco gritted his teeth. “I was a stupid little brat back at Hogwarts. When we were fucking
she hisses. She lets go of his chin, and he rubs a hand across his jaw.
“Sod off, Potter,” Draco elbowed him in the side but grinned. Aside from him making a fool of himself, things were going well. Harry seemed genuinely happy to be in his company. “You didn’t tell me what you thought of my suggestion.”
Of being buried there, inside his Gringotts vault, and all those riches going to waste. He’d decided then and there that if he couldn’t — wouldn’t — have a job like everyone else, he could at least put his vault to use and become a rich, recluse benefactor.
“In three days… come back to my house. I’ll know… what to do with you then.”
Ernestina throws him a look over her shoulder.
That had quelled Harry's mood in an instant.
As though walking through a trance, Potter follows Penelope to her desk, and Draco gestures to his colleagues, teeth clenched and eyes wide.
“Alright, Potter. Let’s go find some post-apocalyptic nerds, shall we?”
Harry’s still bewildered. “Draco,” he says, holding his hands out. “Nesting is a company that sells children’s things… it’s so bloody
“Bye, Draco,” he says and turns towards the door.
Malfoy’s voice interrupts Harry just as he’s about to ask them one by one.
Draco licked his lips and nodded.
The burnt hydrangea on his right hand side, its grey petals singed brown. The tall grey vase, a long crack running up its side as if hit by a spell…
“I forgot to buy you a Christmas gift,” he whispered with a smirk.
“If they all go as well as the first one, I sure hope so.”
— a bunch of names that only make Harry fuck him harder. Harry tightens his hand around Malfoy’s cock and listens as Malfoy’s whimpers of pleasure grow louder, louder… until Malfoy’s body freezes in his arms, his hand, and he comes, cock pulsing in Harry’s fist, slicking it with heat.
Harry’s laugh came out strained. “Fuck, Draco, don’t make me laugh.”
He swallowed. Slowly, he asked: “What is my mission?”
He was too innocent for his own demonic good.
“Wanker?” Draco lifts an eyebrow. “Nice show of respect for someone who's supposed to be your boss.”
Harry can swear Draco is a few shades paler now, his skin tinged grey.
Harry sighed, as cool air ghosted over his chest. Draco appraised him hungrily before removing his own button-down shirt and, after tossing it on top of Harry's, stood and pulled Harry up with him.
Draco spotted something. “Darling. Much as I hate to interrupt your search for this animal, there appears to be smoke coming from my slippers!”
Before Harry can speak, Ernestina bows again, then turns on her heel and disappears through the door on his right. Dumbstruck, he shakes his head at the dog sitting at his feet. “Later, mate,” he says with a shrug, then follows the house-elf along a corridor lined with windows overlooking the street on his right hand. Her head pops around the corner of the first door on the left. “Over here, Mistor,” she says.
“Nah, your aunt will be fine. Your
Draco asked and passed the parchment back to Harry.
Seeing Ernestina show up in his study as early as — Draco glances at the grandfather clock —
“Harry? You there?”
“Maybe I do.”
He casts a casual glance at Harry over his shoulder.
One: Harry would have to explain why he didn’t try to stop a thief — a delinquent! — that he’d caught red-handed.
Harry lifts his hand and knocks on the heavy door, the golden serpent hitting the wood too loudly in the morning-quiet street. The door opens. Ernestina is inside, hands clasped in front of her, her clothes — a floral blouse, a pair of navy capris — perfectly pressed as always. The hydrangeas in the vases look fresh and dewy. Grey daylight is falling from the skylights, bathing Draco’s foyer in soft, welcoming light. The yearning in Harry’s chest rears its head, claws at his ribs.
“Fuck—
“Even
He felt Malfoy lift his body off his and heard the muffled yet frantic rustle of clothing being removed. Then Malfoy’s hands were on him again, pulling at his uniform, helping him out of his cloak, his robes, his shirt. In the pale light of the
Harry doesn’t say anything for a while. Draco watches Scorpius, crouched along the bank as ducks come and go on the water. He’s pointing at one of the ducks, the more daring one that paddled close to the bank, and he’s pulling Balzac’s collar to show him. Blond curls escape his bobble hat, Draco’s Hogwarts green and silver Slytherin scarf wrapped so many times around his neck he can barely move his head. Draco never wears this scarf anymore, but it’s become Scorpius’s favourite ever since he saw it hanging from the coat-peg in Draco’s room and Draco explained to him what the scarf meant. He doubts Scorpius will sort Slytherin if he ever goes to Hogwarts, and it’s okay. Draco’s House pride only applies to himself.
I think he likes us, too.
Because if it is, then no wonder,” Ron says.
ask him about it, even if he tosses me out in a couple of days.” Perhaps something useful will come out of his bloody assignment on Draco’s case after all.
“Mmh,” Draco tapped his chin with the tips of his fingers. “I don’t know. I could, you know? Give you the ring.”
"Not hardly. But I'm not risking some clumsy oaf stepping on it, or spilling on it, or even
"I suppose there's a little gnome city that's developed in the garden, then," Draco says, chuckling as he finishes tacking down the pearl.
"That's not helping."
Draco's body aches; that's the next thing he's aware of. He feels out of sync, his body a lead weight that accepts little to no input from his sluggish brain.
"It's okay to cry," Pansy tells Draco, squeezing his hand as he returns from being the first to pour a shovelful of dirt into the grave hole; public opinion is apparently that Harry Potter deserves to have a mausoleum all his own, but even if Harry were truly dead, Draco knows he'd hate that. So he has a tombstone, like anyone else.
"Draco, don't call Ron a cad," Harry sighs. "He's just—he's a busy man. He has a career, a spouse, children—"
"And how do you know I haven't an invitation of my own?" Draco asks, eyes cast downward toward his work. Only a few pins left to insert, he's pretty sure.
Harry says, the only words he can manage when his heart is hammering his ribs.
"I don't remember any Griselda from school, do you?" Pansy asks.
he reminds himself, reworking his fabric choices. The inner robe is now a fine sage green linen, with an anti-wrinkling charm woven into its fibers, and trousers to match, cropped at the ankle. He transfers his choice of dark green silk faille to the outer robe, despite the weight. He dots an impression of beading along the collar of the inner robe, making a note to himself to ask more about the Southeast Asian part of Potter's family tree so he can represent it accurately.
"But I think I want to be."
"Oh, er—" Potter blinks rapidly. "Of course. But—oh, not that one right there," he adds, as Draco picks up his satchel and makes his way to the door. "Better to use the one upstairs."
Draco sneers. "You're telling me you've
Even now, as he takes a careful bite of crumbly pastry, nothing is strange or amiss. The top of his tray is mostly invoices from suppliers for textiles, trims, and findings. There's an invoice from the repair service that fixed the sewing machine that had fired its central mechanism sideways across the room last week, and Draco snorts at the memory. There are client letters, ranging from heartfelt thanks for beautiful garments to annoying requests for major changes on nearly-finished products. Draco will be sure to charge them appropriately for the offense, though he'd never express such sentiment to a client's face. No, his atelier's reputation is more important than that. Still, this is looking like a tea sort of morning. He can already imagine the bergamot scent filling his nose.
The visit goes on so long that Harry joins Ron in the kitchen to fix dinner, leaving Draco alone with Hermione. It's strange, he thinks, to be so comfortable with the woman he once tormented. Stranger still for her to laugh at his jokes, invite him to her table, let him meet her children. Out of love for Harry, first and foremost he has no doubt, but Hermione has never struck him as the kind of person who sets aside her principles for someone as technically trivial as her childhood friend's boyfriend.
Draco stills, then takes stiff steps toward Harry. He doesn't reach for the wand. "You won't confiscate it again?"
"At the door?" The image of a coterie of owls dropping food on Potter's doorstep and ringing the doorbell snaps Draco out of his emotional swamp just long enough to fix Potter with a confused look; Potter looks strangely... contrite? "You have a doorbell?" Draco adds, as Potter leaves the sitting room.
"I doubt that," Draco snorts, picking up his quill and dipping it with a flourish of his wrist. Some designers like the flashiness of sketching by wand, but Draco is a
He pulls Potter's free hand closer with both hands, releasing his wand hand; Potter shudders, but doesn't pull away. It's surreal, feeling the scattered callus of Potter's palm, the warmth of the softer skin of the back of his hand, the missing fingertip, the muscle and fat and sinew of a part of Potter's living body; Draco can feel dissociation at the edge of his consciousness, ready to take him away, and now he needs to focus, too. "Focus on this," he says to both Potter and himself, and starts rubbing slow, gentle circles with his thumb into the palm of Potter's hand.
"Harry!" Granger's voice rings out across the dark lawn, and she comes pelting out of the house to hurl her entire body at Harry in a tight embrace. Harry's breath gets knocked out of him with a big
"He's alive," Draco says to Pansy, and that seems to make
The awkward quiet doesn't last, though. Harry agrees he'll let Draco take him to Dr. Fiddlewood's office, though he's not ready to commit to a particular day yet. His backlog, he says, as though he's not out in Wiltshire right now ignoring that backlog in Draco's company. Draco sighs and makes a note to nag Harry about it later, and they fall into easier chatter.
“That I would have liked to know that, for one.”
Malfoy laughed. “Really? I fucked you into the ground barely a minute ago and you’re already asking for a do-over?”
Draco and Luna went back to the sunroom. The sun was higher in the sky, casting a cold, white light that somehow turned warm and pleasant, filtered through the greenhouse-like windows of Luna’s home. Through the slightly foggy glass, Draco could make out the back garden, its grass yellow and brittle from the unforgiving winter, its frost-covered fences glimmering in the midday glare. Inside, the sunroom smelled like a luxurious summer day.
He glided forward on trembling legs, like a fawn taking its first steps. Luckily, no one was looking at him yet. Harry was on the other side of the rink, laughing as Finnigan kept Weasley in some sort of playful headlock and Weasley tried to fight Finnigan off with pretend punches in the side. Dean Thomas cheered his boyfriend on; Hermione Granger scowled at the fuss with a reluctant half-smile. The weight of loneliness settled over Draco. Slytherins never had this kind of raucous fun. How could Harry have thought Draco would fit in?
"Harry," Draco whines, as Harry kisses his throat. "You're going to make me—"
This is the room Harry had stood near when he'd taken Draco's wand and his pride.
Draco's skin nearly jumps clear off his body at Potter's voice. He hadn't even noticed him Apparating back into the room. "No, thank you," Draco says, primly, taking a step away from the minibar. Then he turns.
"The files—"
"I am spending enormous amounts of energy asking you gently so you won't run away like a frightened animal," Pansy growls. "And yet here you are, ready to bolt anyway."
Harry takes that hand, and Draco squeezes gently. "All your hard work will have gone to waste. My friends will think I'm a twat. And you'll be alone at the Gala, for all intents and purposes."
"Well, I don't even know if you like this yet," Draco says, picking at the organza with two pinching fingers. "The other one is the one you approved, and this is the one I
"Whichever you want me to be," Harry says, grinning wide.
The corridor just outside the sitting room is bereft of intruders, and for a moment Draco wants more than anything to believe he imagined the sound. He's too keyed up, though, his body too insistent that he check the manor thoroughly until he finds the person who
"What's one more day away from the office, really?" Draco murmurs, laying his hands along Harry's muscular thighs.
The organza sleeves fall in slow, soft motion as Harry stops cold, deflating. "Did you not actually want to be my date, then? Am I that stupid?"
. "I'm with Harry," he says in a low voice, one only Blaise and his bat ears can hear.
," Malfoy says, getting to his feet. "I'm happy to be wanted, Potter. I'll go anywhere I'm
"I would have wanted it when I was—" Draco pauses, trying to pinpoint the certain time of his life he means. "Eighteen, perhaps. When I thought the end of the war meant a fresh start for everyone."
It's perfect.
Harry sprints for Malfoy, shouting, "I'm going to open up the back of that thing!" Malfoy cackles, taking off sideways with surprising ease. It doesn't take Harry long to catch up, though, and he wraps himself around Malfoy's back, reaching from both sides to try and grab the camera Malfoy clutches to his chest. "You're going to sell that to the Prophet!"
"Stupid," Draco tells himself again, plopping himself on a courtyard bench. It doesn't matter if he's in love with Harry. It doesn't matter if he thinks he had some grandiose artistic vision of "flaunting" that love by designing an impractical outfit that no one but Pansy and Fleur have even noticed, and only to mock it, and him by extension. Draco's brought him out of the bubble the pair of them existed in for the past months, and now he has to cope with the results. Perhaps Harry will still want to be friends, in the sense that he might send Draco an owl once or twice a year.
"Do you want trifle or not?" Potter asks.
"It came out in 2010. That does not make it a classic. That makes it just something that has been plaguing me since the theater production first came out in 2006."
Draco doesn't think he should say anything, this time, and he twines his fingers together to keep them quiet.
Potter sighs, pushing a hand into his curls. "Of course I am, nobody wants to be overheard when they're, er—"
Draco can't help but laugh, his anxiety about the kids fading a little. "The grown-up children, even at forty years old. Seems apt." Draco's eyes flick around the kitchen. "Are you sure? Seems there's a bit more to do."
Draco's mucking everything up. "Your hair," he says, despite keeping it to himself twice before now.
"I'm sorry," Potter says, gathering his hands to himself and looking contrite. "I didn't mean—I'm sorry."
Draco still has flowers, though. With summer comes the peace lilies and their move to the outdoors, where Draco will keep a passive eye on them like children told to play outside. Such a temperamental plant—but they had been so important for Harry. A tribute to his mother.
Potter laughs again.
to fuck up everybody's night because he can't stand a bit of discomfort!"
Here and now, though, he pulls the sachet of spent tea leaves from his cup of tea, setting it aside to deal with later, and stands to open the window to the barn owl pecking at the glass for entrance. The bird swoops in, and it takes the work of seconds for Draco to drop a few coins in its leg pouch while it drops the Daily Prophet on the table. He rummages for owl snacks in a drawer, and gives the owl a tiny palmful before sending it on its way. Then he turns toward the newspaper.
In an instant, Draco knows he's fucked up. He lets his mouth run away with whatever combination of words is the most clever, the most acerbic, and in this case
"I see. I'm nice to you and it's back to Potter, is it?" Harry chuckles.
His desk is out in the open with the rest of them, although at least it's close to the door. Wooden cubicle walls give lip service to privacy, but not much more. Draco also notes that the cubicle walls block some of the nearest light, casting the very desk where he'll be expected to read and write extensively into shadow. He'll have to bring in a lamp.
"Do what?" From this angle, Harry can really study Malfoy's face in a way he never did in school. A short, angular nose; a deep cupid's bow set into lips that seem fuller when parted, as they are now; close-set eyes that give Malfoy a determined look.
picky tonight, aren't you?" Draco says with a snicker. "Fine.
"Oughtn't you be sticking your tongue down that Weasley woman's throat somewhere?" Draco grouses.
"It was—" Draco swallows, and again, and tries to wet his suddenly dry mouth. "It was a spell I made."
"Who needs a duvet when I've got you, eh?" Harry says with a grimace on the fifth night, peeling Draco's arm off his chest. "You'd think it was mid-July with how overheated you've got me."
"Has he said anything else about us?"
"You're not MLE, sir. I can't."
It's a cloudy Tuesday afternoon in early summer, not any day of particular note. Draco is reading a Muggle gardening magazine with a cup of black tea, thinking idly about making mushroom polenta for supper later. And now, there's also a tear in the fabric of Draco's living room, a jagged window looking out over a blustery, rocky landscape with sparse grass and an ocean view.
"Like this." Draco mimics Harry's grip on his arms, and makes a face he knows is a ridiculous impression of Harry's intense stare. Then, with a deep voice, he says, "I'm sorry, Draco, for getting handsy with you and then going into hiding over it."
"Oh, barely!" Draco whips his cloak off in a dramatic twirl, already heading for the closet to hang it up. "It feels like my organs have rearranged. That driver was a menace with the brakes." He scowls as he shuts the closet again. "Stop laughing at me, I'm in distress."
"Firstly," Draco says as he swings the door open, "I want the case files back. I can hardly cross reference my research thus far without them."
. But he sketches a smattering of moonflowers and devil's trumpets, all centered around a Luna moth that takes up most of the front real estate of the bodice, and writes that all these details will be tooled into the leather.
Draco pulls his arm away, just by an inch or so.
to be able to attend."
be an athlete! How absolutely disgusting of you!" Malfoy slips a bit as he jabs his finger in Harry's direction, but he doesn't seem to notice, too caught up in his own strange little tantrum.
he'd said. He doesn't know how much his absence has done just that.
"Your old ones are about ten years out of date, I'm afraid." Draco pauses. "What in Merlin's name is a 'hot girl transformation' in the context of glasses?"
"I'm a lout," Harry replies, just as quietly. "Don't know anything except how to cast Expelliarmus, remember?"
he'd been about to say, and he'd only meant it as a joke, really. But it's one of those things Dr. Fiddlewood doesn't like him to say, and he's in no mood for the detour about being kind and gentle with himself. About accurately assessing what it is he does and doesn't deserve based on his humanity, and not the past he regrets. He rubs at the back of his neck, taking in the flowers on the chair again. There are big, garish rhododendrons in with the daisies.
Hermione steps away from Harry completely, and his arms fall to his sides. "Harry—"
In the morning, Draco's Healer says he's free to go, then asks him, now that his contract with the Ministry is up, if he wouldn't bring his research to St. Mungo's to help them cure the victims of the Rabid Dog Curse.
Harry misses the words, apparently, because he only notices the rabbit once it's bounding for the door.
"It's not boring at all," Harry replies. He crosses his arms on the dining room table, pillowing his head against one elbow.
Harry floats the shepherd's pie in its heavy dish out into the dining room, the salad bowl following suit before Harry himself emerges from the kitchen, pulling off his apron. He looks soft and comfortable, and for a moment Draco wants to forget dinner and kiss him everywhere he can reach, right now. Instead he sits, because surely that's too much, and anyway, Harry went to all this trouble.
*~*~*
He never had reason to question his sexual needs. He was attracted to Potter because… well, because he’d spent his teenage years dreaming about him. Because he was
“And now I’m paying for my discretion, clearly.”
The thing about school reunions was that nobody in the history of humanity had looked forward to one, ever.
“I told you. She loves children. It’s her vocation. When Astoria and I found out we were going to be parents… not having Ernestina alongside us to raise our child was out of the question for all of us. Nesting is a well-rounded affair. We don’t need to be on site. We barely need to keep an eye on it, these days. My mother takes care of the finances, with the help of a Muggle accountant.”
Draco felt his knees wobble, his own smile tremble, his ribs ache with the pain of his breaths in the cold evening air. Oh, sweet Lucifer. This was worse than a crush.
Blaise waves his arms like a conductor. Next to Harry, sitting on Hermione’s blanket, Draco holds his sides and collapses from laughter. They’re all pleasantly tipsy, laughing and smiling and finishing the little conversations they started over dinner, and Balzac goes from one friend to the other, begging for pats on the head and belly rubs.
“And how do I fit in this grand scheme?” Draco asked. “I’m hardly worth the higher-ups’ notice.”
Harry shrugs, refusing to blush. “Am I wrong, though?”
“What do you mean?” says Malfoy, sliding a forkful of curry into his mouth.
-Harry
“Potter,” he said instead, something ominous in the calm of his voice.
“You feel so good,” Harry mumbles when their lips part, hungry, incoherent. He’s still holding back. He lifts his head to bite at Draco’s shoulder, follows the bite with an open-mouthed kiss. His whole body is trembling, his shoulder blades damp and shivering under Draco’s palms.
“Okay, Harry,” Scorpius tells him, and Harry is suffused with warmth. He wants to ruffle Scorpius’s hair like he would do with Teddy, but it might not be well received.
Malfoy’s defensiveness melts away.
“Are you? Or are you here to steal from unsuspecting opera guests this time?”
Harry’s eyes fluttered shut.
See you tonight, babe.
Riiiiight.
“Of course! You’ve always been my favourite cousin, Draco.”
Love,
“Is it not a good song?”
I’ll start with a little confession.
“Okay,” Harry nods. He remembers Zacharias Smith’s reports in the boxes of evidence the Auror team gave him to read. Smith was a pompous prick when they were all in Hogwarts. If he’s still half as annoying as he was at sixteen, Harry won’t have any problem playing the part of the unimpressed bodyguard.
“What?”
The door bangs shut behind him.
had faded when neither of them was paying attention. Malfoy looked deliciously disheveled, his hair sticking out in every direction, his lips swollen and pink. Harry lifted his hand and traced Malfoy’s bottom lip with his thumb.
Ron is watching him, eyes narrowed. Always the Auror, even off duty. “I don’t think you’re telling us everything, though.” Harry’s reactions aren’t fast enough for him to avoid looking caught. Ron leans closer, intent. “Spill it. There’s something else, isn’t it?”
-Draco Malfoy
Harry gives her a wry smile. “Before the truth exploded all over our lovely little friendship? Yes. Yeah, I thought he might.”
“He’s right, Harry,” Hermione had said, her hands on Ron’s shoulders, a happily tipsy Luna following her, “Hogwarts reunions only happen once in a decade. Loosen up a little!”
“But you’re going to have to help me out a bit.” At that, Draco takes a step back, a deep frown on his face. His hand is still on Harry, fingers clenched around the handful of fabric. Harry exhales a steadying breath and continues. “You’re going to have to tell me what you’re hiding from the Ministry.”
Malfoy looked down at the trapdoor. His lips were pressed in a thin line.
“Thanks,” Harry laughs shakily, and starts pumping his fist. Draco’s head falls against the cushions. He closes his eyes, giving himself over to the sensation, the heat coursing through his body like magic.
“Hands on the door,” he growled, steadily gazing at Harry from under his lashes.
Later, Draco had taken the cushions from the sofa and laid them on the carpet in front of the fire, explaining that he was getting cold. He’d laid Harry on his back and straddled him, his hair a wild, golden halo around his face, his eyes indecently dark. He’d taken Harry’s cock and frotted against him until Harry was hard again. Then he’d guided Harry inside him, still loose from their previous fucking. Harry’d watched Draco as he’d ridden Harry, sinking down on his cock again and again. It had been late, and the fire had been dying, and Harry had felt so in love he could have died there, too.
“I’ll look into it. Tell Ron I will.”
but there are a few others that we read and paired with Muggle personality tests and career suitability research.”
“Choices you made years ago might not apply anymore.” Draco's expression softens, almost sympathetic. “You don’t owe them anything, Harry. You’re…
“Seriously, though. I mean no offense but… time has passed. You could try something else. You could do something else. How can you…”
“Malfoy,” Harry bit his lip to stifle a moan. “Either we fuck again or you drop the teasing. There’s no in-between.”
“No!” Harry throws his hands up. “Draco… we’ve been together for
As quietly as he came up, he walks back downstairs. Balzac is waiting for him at the foot of the stairs. He lets out a soft, questioning whine.
She pours water into a massive green teapot on the table. “Spain, Mistor Potter.” The ‘r’ of his name rolls off her tongue like a song.
for you,” says Malfoy, something softening in the set of his mouth.
that skittered across the counter and floors, tickling Draco’s skin. He pulled his pants and jeans back up, then turned.
Malfoy obliged, sliding a second finger in on the next pump. He lowered himself on top of Harry, the breathtaking sensation of his warm skin on his, of his cock slotting against Harry’s. There was only his hand moving between them, slowly opening up his hole, preparing him for his cock.
“The club is made up of war heroes, young adults still in school, and former ferrets, Malfoy,” Weasley explained, mock-punching him in the shoulder.
Then Ron and Hermione knock on the cottage door, and when Draco swings it open, Ron grins at him. "Part one is complete!"
"Well," Draco says, gesturing at the paper mess in front of him.
"It was more a wine and h'ordeuvres situation," Draco murmurs at the floorboards, gathering himself to get back to his feet. He can't even begin to address the rest of what Harry's said, between being called
"Oh, something like ten years ago!" Ginny says, her face a smiling rictus. Pansy almost loses her footing as she laughs herself sick, only held up by her double-handed grip on Ginny's arm.
The owl from St. Mungo's arrives two days after the Dendron incident. Confirmation that more victims, surviving only through medical intervention, have lost their magic, in the same draining way as Pertinger had.
"You bloody hired me! You told me yourself you're familiar with my designs!"
A tan line on his left ring finger. Bare, pale brown.
Harry feels his face with the back of his hand; still pretty warm, but he thinks all the most damning signs of his shame have faded. "What are you going to do, break down the door for the pleasure of my company?"
"This is not what I invited you here for, you know." He takes an irritable sip of his wine. "I wanted to apologize to both of you, not be interrogated for things I told you
Draco's been working on a tracking spell since the one year anniversary of Harry leaving to go undercover, is the thing. His progress has been slow, because no one would help him with it, and because he's learned to keep the project to himself to avoid being categorized as crazy.
The accusation hits him harder than any slap Pansy could have dished out. Cold down his body in icy waves, his molars suddenly ground tightly against each other. "What?"
"Does he look healthy?"
"The Golden what?" Harry snorts. "They're back in England, working. Just as I was, before I took a three month holiday to just be alone for a bit."
The tracking spell is complete. It's found the source.
His eyes flick up to meet hers. She's promised him again and again she's no great shakes at Legilimency, even if it wasn't a massive violation of her clients' trust and autonomy. Dr. Fiddlewood just
"Fine! Fine." Malfoy makes a great big show out of crossing his arms, rolling his eyes, and sighing dramatically. "I was hoping for a bit of company. There, are you happy?"
"If I wasn't up to something, I wouldn't be a Slytherin," Draco replies with a delicate sip. "Are you ever not up to something yourself?"
"Hors d'oeuvres," Draco says with a sniff, knowing Harry's winding him up on purpose over pedantry and not caring.
"I don't know, you spend all day inside and you're left with a lot of time after taking the magic shortcut to all your chores," Potter says with a little grunt as Draco's tugging on the fabric jerks his body to one side. "Easier to fill the day if I do the dishes myself."
He knocks.
"Goodnight, friendly rival," Potter says as he steps away, and the crack of displaced air that follows his disappearance makes the canola stalks wave around where he'd stood.
Larch finally cracks the door open, just wide enough to reach in and pull at Draco's elbow. "You've been asked to leave, sir," he whispers, and Draco wants nothing so badly as to push Auror Larch to the floor and give him a swift kick.
Granger puts her face in one hand, grimacing, then shuts the door behind Draco. "Ron," she calls, rather more delicately than her son, "we have a visitor, can you gather up your son and put him somewhere?"
Worse, he realizes that Pansy is tearing up, and when he replays her words in his head, he can hear the wobble in them. "You look terrible," she says, sniffling even as she furrows her brow into a glare. "You're unbalanced. You're forgetful. You slur your words sometimes."
"Why in the name of
"I do none of those things!" Draco snaps, even as he flashes back to yesterday when his quill broke and he couldn't find a single whole quill anywhere in the Auror offices. He'd gone on a characteristic rant about the sorry state the DMLE finances must be in if they couldn't afford so much as a few spare quills when lives were on the line.
"I don't know where Lily is," Rose says, glancing at her mobile. Magical children are apparently no more immune to the siren song of constant communication than Muggle kids, especially teenagers like Rose. When Draco was her age, the high concentration of magic in a place like the Burrow would have blown out a device like that, but advancements in the finally-named field of magitechnology have made it possible for the Burrow to have a television set that only the grandkids and Arthur watch.

"What else have you got, then?" Harry asks, trying to find at least one decent piece of meat in his stew.
Minister Shacklebolt made it a Ministry-wide case, with the specific task of finding the origin of the curse—be it cursed object or dark mage—falling to the Aurors, headed by one Harry Potter. Find the origin, find a cure, the logic went.

"You don't have to do this," Hermione says, reaching across the table toward Harry's hands. His hand feels lifeless, like she's holding hands with a marionette. "Don't you know we can help you through this?"
“Honestly, anyone with the slightest common sense would take time off after Hogwarts,” Hermione said, taking a sip of her tea.
Yeah.
We need to send someone in. Undercover.” Ron’s eyes shift away from Harry’s, and Harry can tell Ron is not as comfortable with the topic as he appears to be. “Of course, Malfoy can’t be aware of it.”
“Tut-tut-tut,” Draco interrupts her with a lifted hand. “None of this self-deprecating bollocks. Gabrielle’s Bend and Snap is perfect because she watched and learned from the best —

And it might be scary — the scariest thing he’s ever felt, and that includes years of war against Voldemort — but he’s fallen too hard to let him go.
Harry pushes the door open. The storage cupboard is small: barely more than ten feet deep, with tall shelves on each side, and enough room between them for a grown man to stand long enough to grab the supplies he needs and get out before it becomes claustrophobic. At least, it’s the kind of space that would feel that way to Harry, were it not for Draco’s presence in it. Draco is standing with his back turned on Harry, jacket discarded somewhere — on the back of his desk chair, Harry remembers in a flash, stupid of him not to have paid attention — shirt sleeves rolled up and lean forearms on display. He lifts his wand to wave it at a box on the highest shelf, the fabric of his trousers stretched across his arse and his long legs. Harry swallows dryly and mindlessly shuts the door behind him.
Draco huffs, a sound between laughter and moan. “Yeah, right. As if I can think straight with you doing— ah— what you’re doing now—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“The Weaslette is attracted to Lovegood?!” Draco almost fell from the sofa.
“I’m glad you’re here. Most days, I only talk to the plants, you see.” She seemed to consider her words. “Well, I also talk to Neville, obviously. But the plants spend more time at home.” She giggled at her little joke. Draco smiled politely, more confused than amused.
“All done?” Malfoy asks him in a bored drawl when he steps back onto the landing.
“Merlin, Ron, you’ve got to stop acting like me and Harry splitting up is the end of the world,” Ginny chaffed him. “I assure you I’m happier with Luna.”
But he knew the answer to this question as he marched towards Malfoy with the hungry focus of a Niffler running towards a stack of gold.
“Mind your own business,” Draco glared, crossing his arms over his Potions book and thumbing his ring. He knew he sounded like a petulant teenager. Then again, that’s what he was. Demons didn’t usually reach maturity until well into their second millenium.
Harry obeys Malfoy. Possibly for the first time in his life, but then again when has Malfoy ever been so persuasive? When has he ever been so… hot. So —

for lack of a better word, as it would be to start with actual careers.”
Cheers, babes.
“Yes.” Draco adjusts his jacket lapels with deliberate meticulousness. His mind is reeling, rifling through images of supply cupboards filled with half-open boxes, fallen rolls of parchment, Harry’s eyes soft on him, then wide and shocked as they take in the Mark on his arm. The hurt, the shame, and the comfort of Harry’s proffered friendship. Harry’s terrible, earth-shattering confession in a dim hospital room, just when Draco was starting to let himself
“No!” their friends laughed, raining snowballs on them. Finnigan and Thomas kept snogging, Thomas only letting go of Finnigan’s face to flip the others two fingers.
Call it instinct. Call it surviving being the epicentre of the last two wizarding wars. Call it living under the Dursleys’ roof for eleven years.

He’s got half a mind to find that person, see for himself…
has to be the responsible one here, don't you think? We clearly have no idea what we're doing. Imagine if we come back to McGonagall with something as predictable as ‘Harry Potter, Head Auror’ and ‘Draco Malfoy, Captain Of The England Quidditch Team’?”
“Why do you care about it so much?” says Malfoy. His shoulders are tense, and he doesn’t sound sleepy. It sounds brittle. A little bitter. “It’s just an old ball.”
And you’re bragging about it?
“Maybe a little, yeah.”
When they’re gone, Harry stares at the door for a long time, adjusting to the feeling of the big, silent house around him. Balzac has gone up to Scorpius’ room for the night, and there’s nothing to disturb the hush. He goes to the study, takes one last breath of the cool, night air, heavy with the smell of wet grass. He closes the French doors, lifts the needle from the record idling on the player, puts the record in its sleeve. Then he braces himself, and climbs the stairs to the second floor.
And the time when he’s been squeezed against Potter in the morning rush of the Ministry lifts, and had to walk with a manila folder held in front of his crotch for a good fifteen minutes. Beyond that… he’d never given any indication of being interested in Potter. No more than the rest of the wizarding world, anyway. Everybody still fawned over Potter, all the time, always. If anything, the fawning had intensified after the press had announced Potter’s breakup with Ginny Weasley for reasons left unexplained, shrouding the man in an even more opaque layer of mystery.

Harry frowns.
problem, Potter.”
“Followed? Harry, that’s illegal. How did he—?”
He’s on the third and last floor of the house. His first room is a small, cosy study. It’s furnished with a desk, a comfortable chair, a squashy green sofa —
If Harry closes his eyes, he can still feel the metal bite of the coat rail against his palm, the white-knuckled grip on it, the tangle of gasps and moans caught in his throat as Malfoy sucked him ruthlessly.
Harry slid his gloved hand into Draco’s. “For your sake, or theirs?” He nodded toward their friends. “I think they’ve an inkling that I like you.”
and he cast a quick
The back of Draco's knees hit the sofa. When he opens his eyes, he has a hand tangled in Harry’s hair and another unconsciously fingering Harry’s belt. His face feels hot, and he somehow manages to blush some more.
Around Harry, in the box, the other opera guests haven’t moved. They’re either too absorbed in the show to notice, or…
she contacted Caduceus
“Mr Potter, a few years ago, you expressed interest in a career in Magical Law Enforcement.”
“I don’t think it’s a phase.”
Draco was surprised to find the familiar shape of Harry on the sofa facing the hearth. Curled up cosily, his legs tucked under him, he appeared to be shaking his head and shoulders in rhythm to something Draco couldn’t hear. Strange. Stranger still, he didn’t move when Draco approached him.
“Harry…” he whispers in his hair. “Harry. Please, don’t go.”
Dear Drake,
interested.
And it was all Malfoy’s fault.
Hermione rummages in her jeans’ pocket and takes out a couple of gold coins. She hands them to Ron. “Here you go. I’ll give you the rest when I get my hands on my purse.”
His eyes trained on Malfoy’s pretty bum, he didn’t notice Malfoy had stopped, frozen to the spot, until he walked right into him.
did,” Harry growls and kisses him again. Draco wraps his arms around Harry's neck and parts his lips, and Harry dives into the kiss, his tongue sending sparks down Draco’s spine. Harry takes Draco’s face in his hands and walks him back against the desk. He kisses down Draco’s chin, along his jawline, down the sensitive side of his neck, all the while murmuring,
With hindsight, Draco wonders if making bad choices is a Slytherin trait.
“Because it’s the only way I
And what is this one—” he squinted at the title, “
Finding out the truth about Harry’s presence in his life feels like a double betrayal: like Draco’s own heart betrayed him, just as much as Harry did. It’s a truth Draco’s mind can’t reconcile.
“Subtle,” Harry said eventually, a small smile quirking the corner of his mouth. Hands in his jeans pockets, he looked almost apologetic.
the last fortnight wanking to thoughts of you, you beautiful bastard.” Harry lets a strangled moan and Draco continues, spurred on by the effect his words have on Harry. “I could barely function – almost ran my company to the ground for you.” He slides his hands to Harry’s arse for good measure, grabs so hard he’s sure he’s leaving bruises.
“Draco, you saved our lives,” Granger said, a sad tilt to her eyebrows. “The rest is... the rest is in the past, if you’re truly sorry about it. Harry... the way he talks about you... I trust him. I think I can learn to trust you. I don’t want to hold more grudges than strictly necessary.” She put her hand on his on top of the parchments and smiled.
Yet Harry knows he’s not alone the moment he steps into the cloakroom.
But then Harry looks at him with those eyes, those fucking eyes Draco’s spent so long thinking about in the depths of his Hogwarts bed, and Harry smiles at him, the bright, open smile he used to save for his closest friends... something warms in Draco’s chest. Something he’d long thought would never warm again.
“Yeah, we are. But if you don’t do it soon, I might strangle you on the spot, Malfoy, hard-on or no hard-on.”
And Harry...
“Okay… You do know Ron is the Auror in charge of the Caduceus investigation, do you? You’re taking advantage of this.”
“Out? You’re bloody mad. It’s freezing.”
He steeples his fingers and focuses his attention on Greg. Greg’s steady brown eyes hold his gaze. Few people dare to these days. Then again, Greg is nothing if not stubbornly brave. He could have sorted Gryffindor, were it not for his pureblood ancestry and all the misinformed choices he would make as a teenager.
The difficult part of the task was to last for a total time of four minutes, and she filibustered for SIX WHOLE MINUTES (Ron was more pissed about the time he lost on his lunch break than about losing the bet. Ask him. He whinged about it all evening yesterday).
“After the Battle of Hogwarts,...I wanted some peace and quiet. Like Harry,” she added, nodding toward the back of the living room. Draco turned to find Harry standing in the threshold, listening gravely.
“You’re fucking impossible, Harry Potter.”
“I’ve never heard of you being anyone’s bodyguard. Actually, come to think of it, I’ve never heard anything about you
“It’s not a bad start, is it? But here’s why, really.” Harry folds his hands in his lap and leans forward, looking into Malfoy’s eyes. “I might be the only person you can trust with your personal security. All the other applicants — you don’t know them, do you? I know the majority of the wizarding community is still distrustful of you, which I deplore, believe me. But the fact of the matter is, you can’t know for sure that someone you hire won’t have bad intentions. Except for the man who could have been your downfall when he had the opportunity, and wasn’t.” He points a finger to his face and adds: “I’m talking about me, by the way.”
“You proved yourself not to be completely dull, I suppose. This is why I’m here.”
“Yeah, I dropped him off after his appointment. Ernestina is with him.” Harry comes nearer. “I… er. Came by to see if you needed me. The agenda for the afternoon wasn’t clear on that, I thought maybe you wanted me to be with you on your way home.” Another rattling sound, softer this time.
Draco gives Greg a meaningful look. “She told me she wanted to say goodbye too.”
Malfoy shoves at Harry’s shoulders. Harry falls back against the coats, taking Malfoy down with him, the rack shaking under their combined weight.

“We are,” Luna said dreamily. “We were going to go snog by the lake, under the weeping willow.”
“Isn’t it the same?”
“Harry, is this Draco Malfoy?”
“Git.” Harry shook his head. “I can’t wait to go to our room and show you

Dinner, I mean.
He glances down at his right hand on the sheets. The scar left on the back of it by Umbridge’s punishment in fifth year seems to mock him.
away with a contrite shudder, Harry finishes his inspection with the bathroom. Nothing out of the ordinary there either, except the counters and floors are white marble instead of tiles.
“Come here.” Harry pulled Draco by the wrist and wrapped him in his arms. Draco feigned a long-suffering sigh.
“God, Malfoy,” he breathes, “yeah— keep doing this.”
“I never said I was
Harry’s spell tickled against his naked skin like a puff of cool air on a hot night. He made sure to hit Malfoy with it, but even after the spell, Malfoy still looked like he’d been shagged six ways to Sunday.
Harry stammers, fucking harder. His fist tightens in Malfoy’s hair in warning. It has, astonishingly, the opposite effect. Malfoy’s moans turn into loud groans as he swallows Harry deeper, tighter, too hot, too much, too soon—
Ron’s joking, but only as a cover for real concern. Harry can read it in his eyes: Ron’s mentally calculating Harry’s alcohol-to-blood ratio and the possible itineraries Harry might take. The ones that might end up with him tipsily tripping and drowning in the Thames, for instance.
“Ha, ha, Potter. I never noticed how hilarious you are.” Draco drops his arm and turns to face Harry. The cupboard feels like a padded alcove, and Harry can hear the puffs of breath every time Draco exhales. “I can’t recall the bloody things’ proper name, all right? So now I’m opening every box in this storage room until I find them.”
He muttered a wandless lubricating spell and slid his dripping fingers back along Malfoy’s crease, feeling him squirm and moan at the touch. He gave his own cock a pump, two pumps, slicking it nice and wet for Malfoy’s arse. One hand still on Malfoy’s hip, he lined himself up and gave a push.
“And part of your redemption, too,” Luna murmured with a small, crooked smile.
they weren’t getting enough sleep. Certainly, sex was to blame; Harry slept in Draco’s bed every night now, no questions asked, and Draco let Harry fuck him with helpless abandon, hands in Harry's hair, murmuring his name like he couldn’t get enough. Like he didn’t know how much longer he’d have Harry for himself. Harry had told him about Kingsley’s ultimatum — the reason that really kept them awake at night. Getting Hermione on board and putting her ruthlessly powerful mind to work along with theirs had been one of their best ideas. She’d taken on their deadlock like it was a puzzle to solve, like it didn’t carry the same weight of personal crisis it did for Harry and Draco. She’d meet with them at Draco’s townhouse at the end of her work day and force them to go over their options over and over again. Ron would tag along occasionally, sometimes bringing little Rosie and Hugo with him. Hugo’s Nesting pushchair would sit in the foyer, like it was defying Harry to find a solution. Rose had eyed Scorpius curiously the first few times, unable to decide if the quiet, unsmiling boy was worth making friends with. Until one evening Scorpius was sat in front of the grand piano to play a mazurka for her. She’d whispered,
The realisation hits Draco like a spell. Harry has somehow managed to truly and decisively feel like a friend, despite him being the last person Draco should trust. Surely, the feelings he’s harboured for Harry for years are muddling his judgment… Against all odds, Draco's started to think of Harry as someone he cares about. And if that’s how he feels for him, then there’s a painful irony in reminding him of how much they used to
“Myopia waits for no one, as you certainly know.”
Harry reluctantly pulls away from Draco’s orbit. It’s not an easy thing to do, and even the foot of distance feels cold. He leans against the counter and crosses his arms in a rather unbelievable show of nonchalance. “So are you going back out there?”
“Don’t doubt yourself, darling,” Draco reassures as he walks towards her. “The only purpose of the ‘Bend and Snap’ is to enhance your natural beauty and sexiness.”
in his lap. Teddy stirred in his sleep, his hair slowly turning from turquoise to cobalt blue. He found his thumb and started sucking it.
“Come here,” he says, strangled.
“She’s my assistant, not my personal quill-fetcher.”
“Not a problem. I was just about to—”
“Edith Piaf? What—?”
Draco and Luna had moved to the brightly-lit kitchen when Longbottom returned with Harry in tow.

But he’d scurried back to his office all the same, after escaping the five-minute blur that his visit to the DLF office had been, heart pounding, cheeks hot, the image of Malfoy so confident and suggestive and
Harry is watching the dregs of his morning tea dry on the inside of his mug, lost in thoughts of shiny rings, blond hair, and denim-clad legs, when the announcement of the interdepartmental mail delivery man snaps him out of his ruminations.
“Just... being young. Being free. Seeing my friends be happy and safe. Seeing the world a bit. Seeing everything I never had a chance to see.”
“What I mean to say,” Malfoy interrupts him, voice harsh, “is that if you ever imply that I wanted my child to be some kind of a piano prodigy, and I
Harry leans his weight onto Malfoy’s back, reaching round for Malfoy’s cock and fisting it. Malfoy must have cast a lubricating spell there, too, because Harry finds the skin already slick, and— oh, so silky over the strained hardness of Malfoy’s erection.
The same enchanted reindeer ornaments he’d seen in the Library were grazing on her desk, giving off a warm glow. The reindeer must have been McGonagall’s idea, then. Draco relaxed infinitesimally.
“I still do,” Malfoy said.
Holy fucking Merlin, Malfoy, it felt like I could never have enough of you. That feeling of wanting someone even as you’re having them. That feeling of
on themselves, but not a much needed air-freshening charm in my office?” Penelope Clearwater sniffs, unimpressed. She steps in as the others make room for her. She surveys Harry and Draco with a lifted eyebrow. It barely twitches with hilarity, which Harry thinks is quite a feat of self-control, given the pretty conspicuous tableau they make.
“Umph,” he groaned. Malfoy’s body covered his like a blanket, and Harry wished he could revel in the sensation just a little longer. Surely Malfoy would notice that Harry
“It’s true,” Hermione says, a placating hand on Ron’s knee. She turns to Harry. “I assume you did what you thought was best in those circumstances, Harry. But it sounds dangerous to carry on with your mission, if Malfoy knows why you’re there.”
Dear Drake,
“I’ll make it up to you in a couple of hours,” Hermione says, waggling her eyebrows. Harry lifts a hand to stop her.
Malfoy flicks a look at Harry and catches him in the act of staring. He lifts a sardonic eyebrow.
It turns out that Hermione has a plan and all the necessary arguments, as always. She has her sights set on the position of Headmistress of Hogwarts, and despite her demurrals — “Don’t worry, Harry, I’ve no intention of pushing McGonagall out, that would be ageism, and besides, it’s not like Ron and I are ready to move to Scotland yet, not with Ron’s career just taking off in London, maybe in a few years when we’re starting a family—” she’s taking every opportunity she gets to campaign for herself. The charity dinner is held at the Eldridge House, one of those old wizarding townhouses that magical families who left Britain after the War bequeathed to the Ministry of Magic. The Eldridge House, like many others, was turned into a museum for wizarding lifestyle and art, and the curators rent out its space for select events. It won’t be a crowded affair, Hermione assures Harry, just a small group of people. There will be a few wealthy witches and wizards Hermione knows from her work at the Department of Magical Law. A couple of them are on the Board of Directors of Hogwarts, “and it’s just the perfect occasion to have a casual chat with them outside of work, don’t you see, Harry?”. Harry sees it very clearly. He also knows that having the unspoken support of Harry Potter always reflects positively on Hermione’s endeavours. Also, he suspects that Hermione is secretly intimidated, though she’d never let it show. She’ll appreciate having him and Ron by her side.
Draco felt his stomach do a little backflip.
“You’ve been wary around me for so long…”
“I’m not— I’m not in love with him.” At Hermione’s raised eyebrow, Harry waves his hand with a grin. Even his ears feel hot. “Ah, forget it. Is that why you’ve come to see me?”
you. Like…”
“Don’t mind my wife, Harry,” Blaise says genially, following her into the house and clapping a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “She’s scared shitless that you’ll still hate her. Acting like an entitled diva is her way of avoiding uncomfortable silences.”
Harry barks out a laugh. “Maybe we both did. I hope
“Nothing happened.” Out loud in the hush of the kitchen, Draco repeated the words he’d spoken two years ago.
The quiet never lasted. The tree had a way to summon demons faster than a Firecall.
“I’m not saying this conversation is over,” Draco growls, interrupted by his own gasp when Harry pushes his hips into his. He repeats the movement, rutting slowly against his erection. “I’m just saying— I’ll have to think about it—”
They walked down the stairs, out the main door and into the snow covered grounds. Draco glanced at the Forbidden Forest, standing as dark and eerily still as it always did. He followed Pansy’s lead down the path to the lake. Someone—Hagrid, perhaps—had cleared it of snow.
Well. I don’t know exactly what Malfoy did to Harry the other day, when he put eyeliner on him down in his lab, but Harry came back with pink cheeks, wearing a big, deranged smile. He was a mess, I’m telling you. I swear he stared at the wall across his desk for a good half hour.
Man, that one was
The corner of Malfoy’s mouth twitches. “You’re disappointed. I can tell.”
Harry turns to look at Malfoy, one eyebrow raised in mute inquiry. Malfoy is watching Ernestina, eyes narrowed.
Draco’s stomach fluttered in anticipation.
anyway—but what’s the use of being a demon yourself if you can’t play this game?
“I’m the least of all possible evils, Draco.”
Draco nods. “Balzac?”
His sullen train of thought was interrupted by Malfoy snaking his arm around him, followed by his warm body pressed against his back.
“Now what?” he asked, feeling around him blindly. He grabbed something warm and firm, which pulled out of his fingers with a hiss from Malfoy. Harry’s breath caught. “What… did I touch?” he asked. “Was it—”
“I thought a new record might be a safe idea… so I went there and asked if they had French music.”
Harry knows better than to reply, knows better than to lash out, although he’s dying to, like a wild animal caught in a snare. He manages to find a gap between the men and their cameras, and sidles through.
He licks Malfoy’s palm, and Malfoy drops his hand with a disgusted yelp.
from the Greek
Draco snorted. “I’m always right.”
He can feel the combined stares of the DLF team, can feel that it’s only a matter of seconds before the dam of giggles and teasing breaks. He’s not too worried about Draco, really. If anyone can hold his own in this office, it’s him.
Harry doesn’t know why he does it. Intuition, probably. One of the instincts he’s learned to follow in his line of work — since he was a child, more accurately. He taps the roll with a Reducto and stuffs it in his pocket.
A soft, snorting noise came from the doorway, poorly hidden by a fake-sounding cough.
Potter?”
“Mephisto won’t find out,” Draco said. They were staring at each other in the semi-darkness, eye contact as intense as the stakes were high. “If he does, the ring ends up at the bottom of the Hogwarts lake.”
“Clearly,” Draco says, his voice cold. He's panting. It's ridiculous. He should be… he should be punching the air, bursting with glee. He shouldn’t be feeling like his body's frozen over, a dull dread seeping through his veins. He pinches the bridge of his nose, exhaling shakily. “Harry… we’re not supposed to…”
The boy nods, never looking away from his trainers.
“That’s where you’re wrong. I don’t want to risk drawing attention to me — and I don’t just mean the Aurors’ attention. Cavendish isn’t any Muggle. Just like the witches and wizards I prefer to steal from aren’t
It’s all he can think about, his mind constantly going over options and schemes, scenarios and
Draco still thinks of the summer before sixth year as the time when shit really hit the fan for him. He didn’t owl Pansy at all during the summer holidays. He couldn’t. He just couldn’t. The Dark Mark was still burning under his skin like a cattle brand. He was too afraid of her reaction when she’d find out he’d been Marked; he was too afraid for her to be associated with him in that way.
How would I know? Stop calling him my boyfriend. It’s ridiculous. We’re friends. That’s all.
Flustered and oddly choked by Luna’s kindness, Draco took out a roll of parchment from his satchel to cover the mounting wave of emotion. “Well. This is just for you to know what the Prothimioscope does. I still need you to sign the disclaimer, though.”
“Oh?” Ron lifted his eyebrows and bit into his sandwich again. “What, then?” he asked, spraying crumbs across the table.
“We were going to go,” Hermione announces, standing and helping Ron up.
When Draco arrives at the Ministry, escorted by the Aurors, they let him name a solicitor and make a firecall before they sit him down for an interrogation.
of what makes me who I am. The rest is...the rest is my friendships, my family, my work. My memories from Hogwarts—yes, those too. The rest is Neville, our animals, our plants. Our home. Our future.
“I do,” he said.
then.
“Harry?” he asks, concerned. “Are you all right?”
They were all so bloody curious, but it never was about who Harry was, was it? Too bad, though, because this was an interesting question to ask.
“I wasn’t ready. Can you — understand that?”
The Dark Mark.
Draco felt his face heat. He had just received a compliment for good marks and good behaviour—and to make it worse, he felt pleased and proud about it.
Draco pushes himself up and straightens his jacket.

Draco didn’t know what to say. It wasn’t as if his opinion really mattered. Harry knew his friends better than Draco did, anyway.
“Did you want to see me?” Harry asked, his smile more confident. Flirtatious.
“Unbelievable,” Jeff the Niffler sighed from among the roots of the oak tree.
“Still up, Potter?” Draco asked him softly. Try as he may, the name
He had hated Dumbledore more than ever in that moment. The Headmaster’s statement was a reminder that Draco’s association with Voldemort had him shooting too high for his level of evilness. A reminder that he’d never be good enough, that he’d always fail, as a human and as a demon and he really
Draco caught the Niffler’s dark, beady eyes over Luna’s shoulder.
“Still the sharp tongue, I see,” Narcissa comments to Draco with a lifted eyebrow when the house elf is gone and Draco leads them to the dining room. Harry can’t tell if her tone is disapproving or admiring.
“Come on,” Harry says eventually, gesturing at Malfoy to follow him. “I’ll show you your room.”
my house. That’s how we met. Anyway, she’s a huge theatre nerd. She studied theatre at uni, and she’s a bit obsessed. So her birthday was coming up, and I asked her if I could take her to a play of her choice for the occasion, and she said yes, that she’d very much like to go and see
“Harry,” Draco says after a moment. “I’d prefer things to be simple and straightforward. Of course I would. Merlin, I… Given the circumstances, I don’t see another way.”
“Yes,” Draco grits out, choked. Anything to take the edge off. To make him forget how real this is. “I don’t want gentle. I want
“The lip ring—” Harry murmurs. “—S’nice.”
But he’s not. He’s not a stranger. He’s Draco fucking Malfoy. He’s supposed to be Harry’s employer. He’s supposed to be Harry’s main suspect.
Of course,
The real question is, is anybody going to be interested in an interview of Draco Malfoy?
“You’re not changing your mind, then?” Draco finally breaks the silence.

Dear Mister Potter,
“And your solution is a Hogwarts reunion?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry blinks, rubs his eyes behind his glasses. Opens them again only to see stars flashing in the corners of his vision.
He looked crushed. Draco gazed at him, baffled.
Draco led her to the table where his parchments were spread out.
Harry used to hate when Malfoy used this tone.
“Draco, a rock on the moon would get your meaning.” Blaise had said, swirling the last dregs of his whiskey around the bottom of his tumbler. “I daresay even rocks on the moon know you’re dangerously underfucked. Time to remedy that.”
“It’s the reason they sent me here, isn’t it? I’m not saying you did anything wrong. I’m just saying there’s no smoke without fire, and if the Ministry thinks there’s smoke, then there’s a high probability you’re hiding a fire somewhere.”
In one of them, a large tome open in his lap, sits Draco Malfoy.
by The Cardigans.
Love,
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Harry deflects, sitting gingerly on the corner of the sofa not taken up by Rose and Hugo’s toy Quidditch team and levitating wooden cubes. There’s a merry fire burning in the hearth across the room. Harry feels simultaneously cold and feverishly hot. “I’m just there all the time, doing my bloody job, as you very well know.” He eyes Ron pointedly. “I’m getting closer to Draco, but that’s what I’m supposed to do in this situation, aren’t I?”
All from a blowjob.
A little birdie told me it was
Draco,
Harry chuckled. “It’s true, but you know which one I’m talking about. Nobody likes to be reminded of their lack of experience when it comes to love.”
“No. I'm just—” Draco hated that he was already blushing, “—I'm sorry. I guess.”
(fucking always, apparently) yours,
“Zat we were dying to see if you two finally kissed!” Gabrielle is the only one who doesn’t seem intent on teasing them until the end of time.
“Well,” Harry says, eyes on the auditors’ certificate. His own voice sounds sour to his ears. “My job here is almost done. I hope you’re happy. I'll be out of your hair soon enough.”
it's six o’clock. Everyone in the house will be up soon. With a sigh, he swings his legs over the edge of the mattress and pats the bedside table for his glasses. His muscles are just sore enough to remind him all day of the night he’s just had. With anyone else, he’d perform a Numbing charm. With Draco… Well. Harry loves the feeling of having fucked so much he can barely walk. He doesn’t want to erase the proof of it lingering in his body.
I failed at all the missions anyone has given me. Take Voldemort’s requests. Those sure backfired with me in charge! I’ve barely–“ Realisation dawned on him. Suddenly, he felt cold. Colder than he had any right to be this close to the gaping maw of Hell.
“It’s… personal.”
And then he didn’t think of anything else, because Malfoy stood and pulled his boxers down. His cock, pale and pink and just as big as Harry’s for all he could judge in the semi-darkness, stood proud and fully erect, a long, beautiful vein throbbing on the side.
He paused to look at Draco, and added:
He pushes the binder to the side, the silver emblem embossed on it — a serpent wrapped around a sparkling wand — gleaming on the front page.
Draco tutted softly, “Oh, do be careful of that arse, darling, I have fast approaching plans for it.” Draco knelt down on the carpet, one knee either side of Harry’s hips. “And I need it to be in
Malfoy hisses, a harsh exhale in Harry’s ear. Harry squirms, caught between the claustrophobic press of coats and cloaks, and the undeniable zing of pleasure slashing from his ear down his spine. Unable to shake off Malfoy’s grip, he settles for petty revenge.
“Erm. Hi.”
“Maybe you’re alone because you want to be.” Harry ignored Draco’s jab and stalked closer, a purposeful look on his face. “Maybe you’re alone because you can’t be with the person you want. Maybe you’re an idiot and you fucked up the first time. And you regret it terribly, but since you’re a circuitous git, you can’t choose the path of least resistance. So you keep hoping that if you run into him, time and again, one day he'll look at you like he did that night. Like something was
“It was in the agenda,” Draco had rolled his eyes and reminded Harry half an hour before the first guests were due. He’d been standing in front of the full-length mirror in his bedroom, fixing his tie — the silver one with green snakes, the one Harry secretly favoured for bringing out the silver hues of Draco’s eyes.
Harry lifts a non committal shoulder. He’s not sure he has the strength for that kind of conversation. Pansy lowers her eyes, a faint tremble of her hand.
A sign of
“I—” starts Harry. Malfoy’s hand flies to his mouth, silencing him.
Harry stands on his feet. A step, and he’s facing Draco still sitting on the bed.
It was Harry's turn to ask difficult questions. Draco couldn't very well tell him that any career choice he made was doomed to be moot, since he would restart another new life on his next birthday.
Everything they had in common.
“Draco—“ Harry whined. It was the sweetest sound. “Fuck. Anything—anything. Just—“
He finds Scorpius in Malfoy’s study, climbing on the stool in front of the closed grand piano, Balzac wagging his tail and watching him expectantly.
It feels like… sharing the same space. Becoming friends.
Understanding dawns on him.
“Fine by me…
“Hi,” Malfoy says, sounding hoarse.
he mouthed. Draco shot him a deathly glare.
In the distance, someone whooped. Maybe it was Harry. Someone was watching him, then. Bursting with pleasure and pride, Draco raced to the other end of the rink, ready to do another spin. This time he might try to add a jump to it, see if Harry would like it, see if he’d be impressed. He sped forward, head down, visualising the figure he’d try this time. At the last moment, as he neared the end of the rink, just when he was preparing to jump and spin, he looked up.
“Oh, because you’re not enjoying it?” Harry teases.
“I’m still afraid. Just… not enough to stop wanting you.”
Next to him, Harry was a shade paler. Yet when he swiftly met Draco’s eyes before turning back to the Headmistress, he simply nodded.
Draco trailed his hand down Harry's chest, brushing past his nipple and eliciting a slight gasp at the contact, before resting finally on the bulge straining in his pants. "Merlin, Harry, I'm going to have to remove these tight little pants before you stretch them beyond repair."
In my
“What is?” Harry’s not sure why he’s keeping his voice down. A heavy hush falls over the room. The ticking of the grandfather clock is the only sound to disturb it.
Draco nods appreciatively, bottom lip jutting. “Very nice. I’m impressed, Gabrielle.”
“One problem at a time, Malfoy,” Harry said. Funny that he was the reasonable one for once.
Beyond the bay windows, the sun was dipping towards the horizon.
“You like men,” Draco states.
Oh, for Circe’s sake.
Malfoy’s study.
for you. But I can't live behind closed doors anymore, Harry. I've spent enough time living that way.”
do if you knew these were your last hours on earth?”
Dear Draco (yes, sorry, I just. I can’t keep with the charade. I’ve seen you, for Merlin’s sake. In the flesh. Across a table from me at Bel Canto, eating your dinner with manners worthy of a young prince. Your cheeks going pink with the wine and the warmth of the restaurant and the warmth of our conversation. Under the drizzle when we walked outside, your hair sticking to your forehead. Sprawled on my bed, naked, hungry, eager),
Draco looked up from his scroll of parchment. There he was again, standing near Draco and Harry’s table in the corner of the Eighth Year common room: the same small boy that McGonagall had sent to fetch him and Harry from the Library that first time. It had been the beginning of December, back then. It felt like a lifetime ago.
Malfoy mimicked Harry in a high-pitched falsetto voice. “Please don’t tell me this is how you’ve made all your life decisions so far.”
Draco hesitates. But Harry’s expression is expectant, open, so he says, “I could make myself available tonight, for instance—”
It was like reading a Victorian novel. Malfoy had had quite a full personal life in his early twenties, the configuration of which had changed as swiftly as it had begun.
The back garden of the Burrow was just like the adjoining house: sundry and disordered, with pink rhododendron bushes poking out of a snow drift in one corner, ceramic garden gnomes dressed in homemade Christmas jumpers in another, beds of purple and yellow pansies trapped under a Climate charm along the fence. And just like the house, the garden seemed decked for Christmas, the freshly fallen snow glittering in the moonlight, the warm lights from the inside of the house bathing the scene with a tender, comfortable homeliness despite the cold.
He opens his palm under Harry’s nose. Inside are the eight Galleons and five Sickles previously in Harry’s pockets, and the golden Snitch that Harry’s carried around for years without anybody knowing about it.
Harry simply nodded. The conversation lulled.
That routine, or at least Harry’s role in it, might end soon. He feels a wave of nausea at the very thought.
“You’re right.” Potter set his glass down with a decisive thud. “So what have you been up to, Malfoy?”
“He doesn’t, usually. But he could have, yes. If he’s not in his office.”
“I was… afraid.” Malfoy tucks a strand of hair behind his ear. “Of what would happen if I let myself fall for you.”
Then he shakes his head. He’s here to grab his coat and mind his own business. He starts to make for the rack where he knows his coat to be.
But it still does, and he sits at the table and holds his head in his hands for a long time.
Confundus
“Draco,
he adds, bracing his arms on the desk and leaning his head over them.
he stutters. “I told Kingsley — this is our last chance to close the case! And I’m taking it! I don’t need a warrant for a friendly Ministry hearing!”
“Yes, of course you did,” Malfoy says, something low and snarling in his tone. “And who wouldn’t have encouraged you? But I…” Malfoy turns his attention back to the sink, picking at the grout with a fingernail, “... I wasn’t even allowed to think about it. Malfoys don’t become Aurors. They become— I don’t know. Investors. Bankers. Fine magical art dealers. Wizengamot members. But nothing so…
there was no doubt about it. He looked a bit drunk already, though he didn’t have a drink in hand; eyes slightly glazed, mouth hanging open. Draco wished he could say that was a dumb look on him, but who was he kidding? Potter looked unfairly fit even in his most unflattering moments. Draco had spent enough time typing the words ‘Harry Potter shirtless’ in the search bar of the Witch ’n’ Wizarding Web to be acutely aware of that.
Draco, the idea comes directly from the Big Boss,” Mephistopheles said, and his expression turned sickeningly reverential at the evocation. “Lucifer himself thinks it would be a glorious way to bring your first hundred-lives cycle to a close. Something you could leverage for a promotion on your next life. When your next life starts again next June, would you rather still bully playgrounds and schools, or move on to bigger, badder things?”
Fuck me with your tongue, please...please do it, you fucking tease—”
“How can you live like this?”
An empty flat.
“And I’ve got no one, and my job is useless. Is that what you’re saying?”
Did you
Love you <3
Harry doesn’t tell her he couldn’t care less whether the Ministry gives him more assignments in the future.
Right.
I sit down. Balzac lies on the rug next to me. Soft fur. Black, white, rust. He looks at me like he has a question. My thumbs trace the velvety edges of the boxes in my pockets. (Dressing gown. One in each pocket.) I pull the boxes out. Place them on top of the other presents, side by side. Dark blue. Matching. (They will wait here, until Daddy and Harry come downstairs. Until they find the boxes, and realise they had the same idea for a surprise.)
Then the Minister slides a folder across the desk.
Draco wants to say, but he thinks of Potter’s eyes on his body a minute ago, the shocked look on his face, as if he’d been struck by some sort of invisible lightning — and the retort dies in his throat. He goes back to his notes for real this time. Rattled, confused, heart hammering in his temples, he’s fairly certain this won’t be the last he’s seen of Potter.
Malfoy shifts slightly, and the back of his hand brushes Harry’s. It’s imperceptible, almost; a halo of warmth against Harry’s knuckles. But it’s there. Harry can feel it, and he knows, with a certainty that sends his heart racing, that Malfoy’s touch is deliberate.
“Harry.” There’s something in the Minister’s calm expression that makes Harry realise he knows the outcome of this discussion before it’s even finished. “You’re the only one we want on this case. You’re the only one who can crack Malfoy’s shell. And yes, your shared history, no matter how unpleasant, might make all the difference here. We believe Malfoy will be unable to resist the temptation to hire Harry Potter as his security detail, partly because of your reputation, and partly because, given your old antagonism, he might—well,
“Is that what I am?”
“Hmm. They do look similar.” Harry scratched the back of his neck. “You see the thing with dragons...”
You must be joking.
“Mother,” Draco whines, shoulders slumping. Despite the unsettling effect the words of Draco’s mother had on him, Harry hide a fond smile behind his hand. Draco looks so much younger, like he’s about to throw a fit and call Narcissa
“Harry.”
Draco sat motionless, blinking rather stupidly. What had happened just now?
It would still say ‘Potter Stinks’.
“I’m sorry, I thought you’d brought me here to check that I was all right. I didn’t brace myself for an interrogation.”
Harry
What had Harry’s exact words been, again?
Okay.
In the pale light, Draco’s skin is flushed prettily, the sharp planes of his face seem softer, his cool eyes almost tender. There’s a hint of stubble across his jaw, and Harry is filled with the urge to press his lips to it before his heart jumps at the realisation. He shifts his eyes away from Draco’s face under the pretense of looking at the boxes laid open on the floor, his eyes trailing along Draco’s shoulder, the curve of his biceps through the sleeves of his rolled-up shirt…
“It’s not something I flaunt.”
like one.” She turns her sharp eyes to Harry, and they soften a fraction. “And yes. I am
Although Draco looks exactly like he would bite Harry’s head off if he went too far with the personal questions, Harry feels like he’s been issued a challenge.
Draco leaned in and trapped the device under his palm. It stopped spinning, and he stuffed it in his pocket. “Of course not. That’s not how it works. It just indicates—”
He pressed the button on the round device at his side, and music unlike anything Draco had ever heard started playing in his left ear.
I want to hear you say it.”
“Yes!” Relieved for the prompt, the boy stood straighter. “Yes, the Headmistress sent me to let Draco Malfoy know that he is expected in her office!”
“Tea’s ready, Scorpius,” Malfoy says, his eyes still on Harry’s.
Suddenly, Harry can’t stand it, his friends ganging up on him to tell him he’s making a mistake. He fucking knows it, for God’s sake. He doesn’t need to be reminded that there’s nothing about this whole plight that doesn’t scream giant fucking disaster in waiting.
They kissed and pulled at each other's buttons and tore shirts open in the dim light of Harry’s Lumos, the metal lockers echoing like gongs with each of Malfoy’s assaults on Harry’s clothing. Until finally, a half-naked Malfoy pressed himself up against Harry. His long prick aligned with Harry’s and god—the sensation left Harry delirious with need.
Harry shakes his head and pats Ron’s arm. “Hey, at ease, Senior Auror Weasley,” he says. “I’m a big boy. I can keep myself safe. And you—” he gestures between Ron and Hermione, “—are here to have a good time.”
Words he’d never felt the need to explore in his past lives. Words that were now seemingly part of his new human life.
Can this stay between us, please? And not us and the entire
you in the middle of this kitchen.”
“You should be. You were the best bodyguard — official or not — that I could have hoped for.”
“You make an awful lot of sense.”
“Yeah, thank you, ‘Mione," Harry said, shoveling more eggs into his mouth. Lucifer, the man still had the manners of a caveman. Draco's mother would choke if she ever witnessed her favourite hero’s table manners.
Ron casts a stasis charm towards the kitchen and sits across from Harry on the coffee table. Hermione doesn’t seem to mind. Since they’ve become parents, she’s grown a lot more tolerant of the mess and people sitting and standing where they shouldn’t.
He hates himself for being so weak, but he can’t help himself.
Hermione had spent nights reviewing all the wizarding law books she owned as well as the impressive collection at Draco’s house. She’d said wizarding laws regarding house-elves had evolved slightly since the war but remained full of loopholes. Magical folk still couldn’t be bothered thinking of house-elves like real people, she had ranted, her brow furrowing in a furious frown. Harry had half-expected her to take her old SPEW badges out of whatever box she’d put them away in and start wearing them again.
“Oh—fuck, Draco, fuck that’s good—” Harry whimpered through gritted teeth, and Draco moved his finger, in and out, in and out, carefully, aware of Harry’s every breath. He had the sudden vision of Harry on the bed; on his back, opening up not for Draco’s forefinger but for his cock, tight and so impossibly hot around him. Draco moving over him, hard and slow, and he wanted that, too, he wanted that and everything else, and he couldn’t wait to ask Harry if he wanted it too.
You’re portraying me as one of the good guys.
“What else do you want?” Malfoy says, hot breath on Harry’s cheek. “Not that this isn’t enough for me… but you wanted to experiment.”
“Oh, real smooth, Malfoy,” Harry muttered from the corner of his mouth. His shoulders shook with repressed laughter. His muted glee shone a new meaning on Draco’s words. Draco felt his face heat.
“No time,” he whined, clutching Harry’s shoulders for fear his knees might give away. “No time. Next time. Just—touch me, Harry. Make me come.
The room looks like… like it was hit by an Expulso
He looks up at the sound of the door opening, and stills when his eyes meet Harry’s. Harry stares back at him, his jaw hanging open.
“Yes.”
Harry takes a few steps around the waiting room. From the window, the garden looks still and silent in the cold winter air; a couple of blue tits fly from one branch of a black cherry tree to another. He walks to one of the sofas, unbuttons his jacket and sits down. The cushion is comfortable but firm, the leather soft and buttery; everything about it speaks of tasteful wealth. Not that Harry doesn’t have more money than he can hope to spend in a lifetime, himself. But he’s aware that when it comes to interior design and decoration, Grimmauld Place will forever remain the motley combination of old, antique furniture inherited from his godfather’s Black family, Harry’s Ikea acquisitions from his post-Hogwarts years, and the odd Chudley Cannons banner.
“Maybe. For a while at least,” Luna squeezed her hand. “It’s our burden, those of us who lived.”
“Yes. And no,” Draco shrugged. “Like my aura, I guess.”
“And then...” Draco smiled slowly, “we ask your friend Hermione Granger if we’ve made the right decision.”
Draco feels his face heat with anticipation. Harry waves his hand and casts a wordless, wandless cleaning spell over their spent bodies. It tickles, warm and pleasant, and Draco lifts his head to look at him. Harry is studying him now, the serious, guarded, almost guilty expression from earlier tonight back on his face. His hand comes to rest on Draco’s chest and he traces light, thoughtless patterns on his skin.
-Hermione Granger
*~*~*
Draco makes sure to stress the word, to linger on the
Granger’s face lit up. “Of course! Harry told me you had started working on it.” She looked at him appraisingly. “Looking into Muggle careers as well as Wizarding ones is very clever.”
“This wouldn’t have happened, though, would it?” Draco says. “If you hadn’t stayed here for so long. If you hadn’t let Zacharias Smith go rabid with the case, waiting for you to solve it.”
Pansy held his arm, her fingernails polished with dark green digging into his sleeve. She buried her face into her scarf and Draco cast a Warming charm over them.
As if any of it matters now, Harry. This can’t go on. What do you expect? Us walking into the Ministry hand in hand, making a happy announcement? And what would that be? That you’ve been fucking me for months while pretending you were still Shacklebolt’s spy? Or that Draco Malfoy was stupid enough to spread his legs for a Ministry mole?” His lip curls in a sarcastic sneer. “Pray tell, Harry, which one sounds better to you?”
“School supplies won’t be necessary,” Draco tells him, wrapping his arms around Harry's neck and bringing him flush against him. Harry’s tongue darts to lick his lip ring, and Draco laughs. “My teaching style focuses on practical work.”
and not count on Polyjuice or a glamour to hide my identity like I usually do on cases. I can’t see things going well for me if I contact Malfoy after twelve years and ask to be his friend.”
“Yes,” Harry smiles at Malfoy’s bewildered air. “Hermione had bought me a couple of extra clocks. She thought that would solve my problem.”
“You requested I come here, I gather.”
“All right, Harry, I’m done bothering you.” She stands straighter and gazes at him thoughtfully. “Ron is perfectly fine with you seeing whomever you like, you know. He’s like me; he trusts you to choose someone who’s good for you.”
After his three-year post-war house arrest, Malfoy had moved to France with his mother. Lucius Malfoy had died in Azkaban six months prior to their leaving the country. His funeral had been the only outing Draco and Narcissa had been allowed during their confinement. With no money, no property, and no Lucius, there was virtually nothing keeping the remaining Malfoys in England. The family owned a small flat in Paris, one that the British Ministry had not been able to confiscate for lack of a legal agreement with the other country, and that’s where Draco and his mother had stayed.
Warning for this chapter: (non-graphic, off-screen) wild magic, and people getting hurt because of it.
“Or three.”
Can I see you again soon?
Harry moved into his space. “You can be a part of it. You can be a part of my future, every step of the way. As long as you feel like you have enough room within it to build your own.”
Harry lifted his eyes to look at Malfoy. His expression was so open, his bright grin so sincere, it reminded Harry of everything he loved about his job. Of everything they both loved about their jobs.
All things considered, I prefer the latter, but no matter. This whole awkward dance has to stop. I’ve work to do. This isn’t conducive to a productive work environment. Find a way to END IT.
don’t know about that?!
“I agreed to it… as long as my son was kept out of this— this bloody
“She...
The thought brings him back to the reality of it. It feels momentous, even though it shouldn’t be.
“Shut up, you ridiculous man.”
“Here,” Draco says, backing a step. “Against the desk.” Harry's expression falters, a split second of hesitation, and Draco bares his teeth. “Stop being so goddamn mushy, Potter. For fuck’s sake, just… just take me like a fucking man—”
Which is a big surprise.
In short: how could anyone enthusiastically subject oneself to a school reunion? Draco had no idea. He’d gone straight to Pansy and Blaise’s when he’d received the invitation, hoping to find a sympathetic shoulder to complain on. No one wanted to go to a school reunion when one was at a low, did one? In Draco’s case, the low in question was an uncomfortably public divorce. Astoria, his now ex-wife, was now gallivanting on the Amalfi Coast with a Muggle investment banker she’d met in one of the fundraisers Draco had always been too bored to attend. Blaise and Pansy, much to Draco’s dismay, hadn’t been the commiserating kind. They had already decided they’d go to the reunion, and Draco, by extension, had to tag along at all costs.
Malfoy shakes himself at last. “First Granger and Weasley, and now you? I should have known you wouldn’t be far behind. You three are joined at the hip, aren’t you?” At Harry's perplexed frown, Malfoy only smiles, a tense little thing. “We’ve got to stop meeting like this.”
Harry’s effortless good looks and their effect on Draco only fed his simmering annoyance. Draco took a deep breath.
“Easy for you to say. I’m only the estranged cousin. You’re the providential godfather. You could do no wrong, even if you woke him up.”
Draco felt his face heat. “Right.”
Mr Malfoy. I believe your complementary competencies shall be perfectly suited for this task.”
Harry
This went way deeper than a storage room would.
Harry makes a sound like
Harry doesn’t think it should surprise him, the fact that Malfoy broke one of his promises, and kept the other. He doesn’t think it should
“You don’t have to do this,” Harry says. His voice is low, placating,  and Draco bristles again.
“Yes,” Draco tried. Two could play the flirting game. “I wanted to see you, maybe take you for a walk up to the Astronomy Tower again...” He searched frantically for the next bit, face heating. “...maybe, er, pick up things where we left them?”
"New glasses?"
Which is how he spots the other figure in the field, some fifteen meters away.
"—you thought this represented me well? It's surface level! You don't know me, Malfoy! This weird appeal to my family connections, and a Patronus I can't even cast anymore—"
"I don't want to go with a Quidditch player!" Potter says, as if Draco had suggested he ought to take a pile of rats in a trenchcoat to the Gala.
The face Potter makes is a pinched one, and Draco wonders what retort he's holding in, and if it's worth coaxing it out. But Potter sighs, and the moment's passed. "What do you need from me to start this whole process?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry laughs, and puts down his tea to help gather it up, but Draco waves him back with an irritable grunt. "It's alright to be rusty, you know," Harry says as he sits back down. "It's been fifteen years."
"You were just—you were very loud," Draco tells Potter's socked feet. That's as far as his limited courage takes him at the moment.
Draco could keep snarking, make some remark about liking a life of danger, taking Harry's job,
"I need to get out of here," Potter says at last, his voice a weak croak. "I need—"
"Right, you didn't mean to schedule me for the same day you brought over your little Slytherin school friends so you could tell them
"It's unprecedented, if you're right," Harry says with a tapping finger on his jaw. "But we've no room to underestimate Dark magic. What do you propose?"
Potter looks pointedly at the sketch.
"I'm already good and disgraced. It's you who's in danger of being discovered for the lout you are."
Harry laughs again. "You posh twat," he says, which sends a panicked shock down Draco's spine, but Harry doesn't seem to mean it maliciously, still chuckling as he rises from the table. "I'll make you a fresh cup, then, your Highness."
Draco pulls a scrap of parchment from his bag, and fusses with the outer pocket until he's extracted a bedraggled self-inking quill to write his address on it. He presses it into her hand, even as she takes a step back. "Owl me," he says, low and urgent, "if they do. Or if they don't, and they—I just need to know if Pertinger's the only one."
"I'm teasing you.
"Something happened to Harry, but that doesn't mean it isn't
me to be here." He drives his finger into the arm of high-backed chair he sits in, underscoring the word
The banging on his door, a week after the Burrow dinner he did not attend, seems to have several sources. When Draco listens—ah, yes. Ron, Hermione, Blaise, Pansy. Pansy and Blaise are shouting abuses about how Draco must be smelling up the cottage after staying inside it for so long, Ron joins in with them, and Hermione tries a more peaceful tack by shouting that they just want to know he's okay over the din of the other three.
He closes the cabinet firmly at the thought, though, and tells himself to ask Potter for tea when he comes back down.
"Git," Harry sighs. "I meant here, in Connemara, in all this," Harry waves at the trees around them, "nature. You're completely unprepared and totally out of your element. Oughn't you be in your palace, being waited on hand and foot and pretending to camp out fifty meters from your front door?"
"Oh, be as unkind as you'd like. Merlin knows I—"
must discover if this client request really is from Harry Potter, and the only way he's going to do that is to fully caffeinate and set out to that undisclosed location himself. He takes an enormous, scalding sip of coffee, then signs off on the maybe-Harry-Potter client request. Accepted. The document duplicates itself, and one copy vanishes.
"Get out, then!" Draco shouts right back, grinding his sleeve against his leaking eyes. "Get out of my bloody house!"
"I mean, if you won't." Draco wants to lie back in Harry's bed and roll around. This is how comfortable couples talk, he thinks. Loving snipes at each other. "Have you forgotten how to bathe, too? Don't tell me you need me to come in there with you."
"Draco?" Pansy asks with a frown.
"Please, Harry," Draco pleads, in spite of Harry's previous reaction to his first name. "I need you to come home." He can't cry, but he is anyway, tears burning his eyes as he reaches for Harry's left hand.
"I say what you were hired to do!" Potter snaps. A cold thrill goes up Draco's spine at Potter's anger, and as much as he doesn't want to jeopardize this job, there's a rush in breaking through Potter's new icy exterior. He
"No." That makes Pansy pause as she steps in front of the second request, and if he'd thought he'd gotten a sharp look from her before, it's nothing in comparison to now. He can practically feel her eyes slicing him open. "It's a surprise!" He tries to grin, but he can feel the corners of his mouth twitching under her gaze.
“Fine,” Draco sighs, tucking his hair behind his ear. Potter’s eyes follow the movement of his hand, and Draco’s heart — the treacherous thing — jumps in his chest. “Let me—” He lifts a finger and walks to the filing cabinet near his desk, ducking to avoid a form flying from Parvati’s side of the room to join the piles of parchment on Lavender’s desk. He scans the cabinet. Receipt forms, receipt forms… ah yes, in the bottom drawer. He bends, opens it, and grabs a blank form.
Harry opens his mouth to respond when Balzac’s enthusiastic bark resonates in the foyer and Draco’s purring drawl reaches them from the bottom of the staircase.
Hermione said quietly. “He looks like a weight has been lifted off his shoulders.”
“Please drop the Auror mode for tonight?” Harry pleads. “It’s Draco’s birthday, and you’re his guests… I would appreciate if you’d acted like it.”
Pansy had fallen back into her chair, waving her hand dismissively. “Whatever. I give up. If not even Potter’s presence can entice you, you’ll just have to come to keep me and Blaise company.” Draco’d opened his mouth in protest, but Pansy had stopped him with an imperious glare. “I
“Are you telling me this is just a fling? Or worse, that you’re using him?”
In the back of the study, Draco rises from the ground, wand still pointed at Smith, his other hand rubbing his eye.
“Okay,” Harry raises his eyebrows. “I thought you wanted to… talk. So you really want to go now, or—?”
“How so?”
“I had Ernestina follow you ever since I received your application.”
And he’s ready to do it.
“His son—”
Malfoy wrapped his long fingers around his. His smirk was barely hiding the fact that he was blushing, and Harry wondered how obvious they looked. Harry’s hair was more of a mess than ever, and Malfoy’s chin and throat were pink from stubble burn.
Draco straightens. Despite his debauched state, he suddenly looks so collected. So much stronger, so much more mature than Harry feels.
Draco realised he still held the Prothimioscope in his hand. He set it on the central island and the little bronze device started spinning, its gentle buzz filling the hush of the kitchen.
“Where are you taking him?” he asks, urgent.
That is part of the problem, though. After all these years, after all that he’d changed… he still isn’t entirely convinced that Greg is right.
Before he could touch it, Draco stopped him with a hand on his forearm.
“Of course she’s here, Ron!” Hermione says. “She’s his mum!”
The rain is falling harder and Draco is already yards ahead when Harry breaks into a run. Draco is a faster runner, but Harry’s determined to catch up with him, spurred by the need to see his face. To touch him. To say…
Third—
Right. The case is over. Draco pretends he's only just remembered he'll have to turn over his wand.
"They're squash, how careful do you have to be? You'd have to chuck them against a brick wall to smash them."
Draco finally opens the final note Harry sent him the day he owled him lunch (he still reels thinking about it).
"Suppose I can," he says, making a great show of pushing up his sleeves and rolling his shoulders before casting the very simple spell required. Draco shakes his head, and follows Molly's orders of heading out into the yard to join the other grown-up children, as she puts it.
anything, and secondly, it's not like we were snogging! It was a peck on the lips, and
The box is full of photos, thrown in higgledy-piggledly by Harry himself. They'd agreed, once they started buying frames, to be choosy about which photos had earned the real estate of being displayed about the house, but too many photos were still too precious not to keep. Draco reaches in.
The Manor wards ripple gently as Draco Apparates into the front hall. He steps out of his shoes and arranges them by the door, hangs his empty bag on a wrought iron coat rack next to them. Fourteen years ago, he would still swish his wandless hand as he entered his home—muscle memory. Now in his early thirties, Draco is used to his Squib existence.
Draco fiddles with his wand in his lap, and Molly pulls it away from him with delicate fingers to set it on the coffee table. "It hurts worse, this way," he mumbles, and she rubs his back.
Draco sweeps out before she can change her mind.
"That's what I came to
But instead he sits by Potter, vanishing into the stalks with him.
Again, Draco feels as though the words have been borrowed from his own thoughts. "But you're not like that here."
Harry laughs, and Draco would regret saying something as Harry pulls away, except that Harry
don't scratch him.
as he passes. He breathes through his nose as he wedges himself into the corner of the lift car, focusing on small actions like pressing the button for Level Two, and on the weight of his bag full of research digging into his shoulder.
"Thank you," Draco murmurs, between hiccuping sobs, because he can't remember ever feeling so grateful. "Thank you."
"Oh, Draco," she says, which is something Hermione's said, too, and Blaise, and Ron, and Mrs. Weasley, and everyone else he's ever told that his husband is not dead.
