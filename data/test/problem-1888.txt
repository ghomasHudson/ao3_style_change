He found some people roaming the kitchen already and, thank Merlin, someone had boiled some water already so his tea was prepared in no time. Harry sat down grimly and stared at the steaming mug.
Ron looked at the list in his hand and furrowed his brows. "The first one is Mr Peck, the second one Mrs Gardner. Dealing with illegal stuff, openly supporting You-Know-Who in case of Mrs Gardner, and other smaller minor convictions."
The only thing he'd been able to find was this apartment, and the man he'd rented it from looked even shadier than Greyback himself.
Moaning into Draco's mouth, Harry dug his fingers into Draco's flesh, forcing himself to keep his hands from Draco's neglected cock.
Sighing, Draco let his fingers grace over his belly. "Okay. Fine. I only want for them to be safe. If that means telling the world Saint Potter is their father then so be it."
Letting out a deep sigh, Harry looked at him. "Did you plan to marry someone else? If yes then I'm sorry. I'm sure I can cancel this—"
Fighting to get on his feet, Harry walked over to Draco and threw his arms around him, hugging him close. He wouldn't let go until Draco relaxed a bit.
Mrs Robards breathed out a, "Yes," as her entire body started to tremble. The Truth Serum was racing through her veins, compelling her to tell the truth.
"Brilliant! They'll be safe there," Ron said, giving everyone a thin smile. "We can't let them take our snakes now, can we? It was a lot of work to tame them." Ron snorted at his own joke.
Nodding, Ron opened the door. Together they stepped into the dimly lit, dusty room, batting spiders and cobwebs as they walked.
By the time Malfoy climbed out of the bathtub it was abundantly clear that he wouldn't stay awake till the fireworks. He was already half asleep by the time Harry finished spreading the salve over Malfoy's back.
"Now they know it's you, you absolute tosser," Draco snarled, obviously annoyed. "Everyone knows the form of your Patronus!"
Looking up into his flushed face, Harry reached for Draco's waistband and gave it a small tug. "Lift your arse."
Politely letting an older witch step in front of him to leave, Harry glanced over his shoulder for one final time. He shuddered.
Helping him to Harry's bed, Harry tucked him in and transformed his desk into a smaller bed at the other side of the room so he could monitor him, like he had promised Luna he would.
"Of course, but be careful to not run into my plants," she snapped, "some of them are just as unhappy about visitors as I am."
"What if they find that stuff at the joke shop in a few months?" Harry pondered as they walked past yet another new coffee shop. "I wouldn't want George to get into trouble."
What felt like an eternity later he felt a cleaning charm wash over his body, even though he could swear Draco hadn't moved at all which made his cock stir weakly once more. But he was way too tired to care. He didn't even react when Draco shifted them on the sofa, bringing them into a lying position, limbs entangled. He could have thrown Harry on the floor for all he cared.
And just like that, they started talking. This made things even more uncomfortable for Draco than before, because he was the main topic of their conversation. By the time they decided to all grab lunch together, Draco's mood was positively grim.
Squinting at the barn owl as if it'd have the answers he was looking for, Harry dropped the letter onto the table.
Blaise had been having a conversation with the unpleasant old portrait of Mrs Black, and Harry decided not to wonder exactly why. Slytherins could be an odd bunch, and if Zabini fancied a chat with a nasty portrait that was his business alone.
"Draco sounded rather distressed so I guess a lot. I'll let the others know to bring snacks and stuff." Greg furrowed his brows, a shadow of anxiety crossing his face. "I think I know why. It's scary out there right now."
"What should I do?" That was Draco, sounding more panicky than he'd ever done before, even during the fire he had caused. "If the Ministry finds out—"
Meanwhile, Harry and Draco started undoing all the wards knotted and entwined around the place. They took down every trace of lingering magic that had been left to capture and contain them, moving forward step by small step.
"Probably," Arthur laughed. "But I wouldn't learn how they worked if I never took them apart. And if I don't know how they work, I can't figure out how to make them work around magic either."
Thirty minutes later Harry found himself knocking on Kingsley's door, still not sure how he was supposed to start the conversation. A simple 'Kingsley your fucking Dementors are on the loose' didn't sound appropiate to him, but he wasn't sure what else to say.
"Mate, stop worrying about him and focus on the job in hand," Ron hissed, nearly losing his footing himself. "If you slip we'll both be done."
Harry meanwhile discovered the true meaning of the words 'sensitive nipples'. Every time he moved and his shirt all but graced his skin, Harry felt like jumping into a new realm. Their responsible Healer promised him that this would be over soon, seeing that neither of them were about to produce milk. It should pass soon.
Cassiopeia and her brother watch Potter's life at home and she wonders if there is anything else she had assumed that was wrong. She knew that purebloods weren't superior and that the rivalry between Draco and Potter was turning into something more. Not that anyone besides the Slytherins would notice with Draco insulting them every minute. Like the muggles said, old habits die hard.
The two of them look at me, waiting for me to tell them what I’m going to wear today. I walk over to the closet and forage through my side of clothes. I decide on a white shirt tank top with lace, a blue and white plaid skirt and a blue cardigan. I show it to the girls and they smile, liking my outfit. I pick out a necklace with the Cassiopeia constellation on it that my brother, Draco got me. I had gotten him one as well, with the Draco constellation on it and he never took it off, wearing it underneath his robes.
“Do you think we’re stupid?” Draco asked but quickly added when they opened their mouths, “Don’t answer that, it was a rhetorical question.”
Here's the next chapter you've been waiting for! This isn't as long as I orginally planned but next chapter will be the train ride and the sorting. I kept Draco's wand the same since it fits him quite well.
“It’s quite alright, Harry. You are welcome to leave at any time, all of you are. I should have warned you but I did not know it would be on the CD.” Dumbledore smiles at Potter before addressing all of us, “Now it seems there are some clips of students going Hogwarts shopping in Diagon Alley. Let’s watch, shall we?”
Cass went first, “Well, we can get the pumpkin juice at lunch. The house elves make the food in the kitchens so everything must come from there, right?”
He turns to glare at me, “Peacocks are vicious beasts that pretend they are majestic to lure you in and bite you.”
It seemed that was what the twins were waiting for as both of them lighted up and Cass knew they were in trouble. “Well, we have some new products for pranks and we need some new test dummies.”
The Weasley twins were yelling, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” like it was some sort of competition they had won and Potter was the price.
Cass wants to smile and dance around the room but keeps her cool and pretends to be sad, “What! But I’ve always wanted to go to Beauxbatons.”
Everyone starts clapping and whooping and to be polite, I clap lightly. I don’t know why we are clapping because it wasn’t much of a surprise that he got accepted since he is here. My brother and our friends used to always tease Longbottom about how he kept blowing things up in class and wasn’t good at magic. I had never expected his own family to think that of him as well.
Cassiopeia laughs, shaking her head, "That is a very complicated reason behind the name but I like it. Diana and Peresphone. Best friends for life."
I make my way to the three of them, Draco following behind me. I don’t even glance at the other two, just stare at Potter, “Have you told your little friends already, Potter?”
“She tolerates me.” I say and I wish our cats were here so I could snuggle with Diana. She was always much friendlier than her fellow cat. It made sense though. The two misunderstood, cold ones who had a warm centre were together.
I must warn that this may bring up old memories and feelings but hopefully, the end result will be worth it. If anything goes wrong, do not hesitate to call out my name and I will appear as a ghost-like figure.
I was puzzled but Draco continued, “You will need a lookout. We’re Slytherins, if you get in trouble, that’s detention for you for the rest of the year. I’ll come so you’re not by yourself.”
She laughed at the meaning as well, the name very crude. Draco poked a finger at the black cat and when the cat responded with a snarl, baring its teeth, he smiled. "I think I've found my cat."
Draco and Cass headed off to talk with Severus while the other three worked their way up to the owlery to send a letter to The Apothecary in Diagon Ally since that was the closest potion ingredient shop that they knew of. Professor Snape was most likely in his office but just to make sure, Draco cast a ‘point me’ spell to find him. They didn’t want to waste any time and Mother had taught them that spell before they had left the Manor as she said it was quite useful during unexpected times.
Pansy sighs, pinching the bridge of her nose and says in a threatening voice, “If she does that one more time,
Draco began to smile but turned it into a smug look, remembering who he was supposed to be. It was bad enough they had seen how worried he was at the beginning. Malfoy's shouldn't be anxious but confident. He had to remember that.
othing much new in this chapter but Draco does have a cat instead of an owl in this book. I hope you like the names :) They sort of match. Idk, I realised that they do when editing. Also I just love the names.
Potter seems to ease up as we saunter up the stairs and when we reach the painting of The Fat Lady, she doesn’t even ask for a password, just seeing Potter makes her let us in. I roll my eyes, Potter always gets everything he wants.
Rage filled her and her eyes lit up. To anyone looking at her, they would have seen her eyes turn a bright red. She had better control than her brother and her hair rarely ever changed because of her emotions, unlike Draco, but sometimes her eye colour changed. It was barely noticeable but she worried someone would see one day. It happened this time because she thought Harry was different. She knew Weasley had prejudice against Slytherinn and the Malfoys but she didn’t think it would rub off on Harry.
Draco huffs at both of us, “You know I’m picky, why would it be different with my magic? Besides, I wasn’t that confident with my right hand anyways.”
Rosa rolls her eyes, “Please, I think it would be my sister that would be causing her trouble. Oh! Did you like the new password?”
They were surprised, Draco could see it on their faces as Severus was usually not generous with that sort of stuff but he knew Severus had a soft spot for him and Cass.
He rolled his eyes but his sister smiled back, not bothered by the girl’s lack of observation. “Yes, I am. My name’s Cassiopeia Black.”
“But they have five people in their dorm, one more than us, they don’t need another person,” I say because Tracey shared a room with Sally, Jessica and Emily.
Knocking on Draco’s dorm room, I waited outside while I heard some shuffling going on inside. I expected Blaise to open the door since he was usually the first one up but it was my brother instead. He was half-dressed, only his pants on, and his hair was a mess. Cassiopeia never got used to the fact that my brother was actually hot, like with abs and everything. I could say that though because I was a full-on lesbian so even if they weren’t related, he wouldn’t be my type.
Cass listened to him and finished eating the rest of her lunch. They chatted for a while but once everyone began filling out of the Great Hall, the five of them stood up to leave so they could retrieve the last items for their trial.
Looking around behind the big oak trees at the edge, she frowned. The girl turned away and dramatically stomped her feet a few times, pretending to walk away. A sigh of relief was heard within the forest, along with footsteps, and she spun around, throwing her arms in the air with a loud, “Yes!”
She was so close to escaping her father's clutches and being herself that she was not going to let him stop her. With a plan in her head and her brother by her side, she decides to try and persuade their parents to let them go to the same school. She would go to any school if she could be with her brother.
I already knew we’d be shown since Draco and I met Potter in Diagon Alley in the robe shop. Draco was a real jerk but I wonder if Potter remembers our first interaction with each other or if he just assumed it was at Hogwarts. Either way, Draco didn’t make the best impression on Potter.
Every first year Slytherin went through a ritual to become a proper Slytherin. Other houses accepted their students without stress but now that Slytherin could no longer keep out muggleborns and half-bloods, his portrait had gotten fussy until he decided on a different way to prove who were true Slytherins. Of course, if you failed you weren’t kicked out but everyone knew who the fakes were.
She looks out into the crowd of first years and spots her brother. He’s fidgeting with his robes. The hat has been on her head for a while. Not long enough for it to be a hat stall but the students are getting impatient. They are most likely confused why a Black is taking so long to be sorted. Cass knows her brother would have a heart attack if she told him it was because the hat was considering putting her in Hufflepuff. He would eventually accept that she has Hufflepuff traits and probably say something like, ‘At least it wasn’t Gryffindor’.
There was no doubt what house Weasley would be in. The red head sauntered up to the stool and within a minute, the hat was already shouting out it’s answer.
Cassiopeia doesn't question his weird taste in cats and grins, "Brilliant! Let's go show mother so we can pay for them."
“Ex-death eater.” I correct, “And that’s why we’re watching these CD’s. Perhaps after, everyone will know us as misunderstood children who had no choice.”
Everyone starts laughing when hundreds of letters shoot out of the fireplace. I wished I had something to take a picture of Vernon and his family’s face. Potter chuckles softly as well.
Dumbledore dismisses him and he leaves after that while Dumbledore smiles at us, making my hair stand up, “Mr and Ms Malfoy, please sit down,” I sneak a look at Draco who just motions for me to sit down, telling me it’s safe to. Dumbledore passes a bowl to me and Draco, “Lemon drop?”
She gasps and it’s like the best entertainment ever, “You take that back. I didn’t have a lisp at that age, right Astoria?.”
Draco frowned at the use of his nickname but doesn’t complain since it’s Susan so I answered her, “Um, Dumbledore sent me, Draco and Harry to get some people and so we need you three to meet us at the great hall at eleven. We will explain there.”
Happy Valentines Day everyone! Hopefully you guys are spending time with your loved one/s but if you're reading fanfiction (like me) today then you're probably single. Oh well...
Surprisingly, Granger chuckles and replies, “My parents almost didn’t let me go but Professor McGonogall came back and showed us more magic. They agreed afterwards.”
I roll my eyes. That was pretty obvious, with his cousin living the best life while he slept in a cupboard. At home, Draco was the favourite but even he was scolded and yelled because he couldn’t be protected like Dudley was. He had to be the perfect pureblood to continue the Malfoy line.
“We’ve got to go after them!” Millie exclaimed but Pansy shook her head, “No, as much as I’d like to hex Theo, I said sabotaging was allowed. I never thought I’d be the one sabotaged though.”
This time Cassioepia can’t help it and rolls her eyes along with Pansy who finds her way next to her. She’s lost Draco in the crowd by now but she sees a puff of platinum blonde hair up the front so she isn’t worried.
The door opens and I step in and immediately laugh at Draco’s side of the room compared to the others. Theo has his all neat except he has books and quills everywhere, Blaise’s is all tidy and Draco has his bed made nicely but his clothes are thrown everywhere and it's all a mess. Draco glared at me while the Pansy also judges his side and Blaise gets out the emergency kit from out of the bathroom.
Cass didn’t notice but she soon fell asleep with her head on Draco’s shoulder. He let out a sigh and laid her down on the bed, lying next to her, watching his sister sleep so peacefully. He knew what was coming at Hogwarts, the lies he would have to say and how he would have to act. His sister acted like he didn’t know what he would have to become but he knew since his very first lesson with his father on Malfoy rules.
Monopoly was banned from the Slytherins after that incident and we were stuck with doing puzzles for the rest of break. When Headmaster Dumbledore called everyone back to their seats, the tension on the Slytherin side was noticeable to everyone, even the oblivious Gryffindors. I had hoped no one would bother us while we waited for the next CD to load but that was impossible when you befriend Hufflepuffs.
It’s Potter, of course, and I just had to be holding a stunned owl that happened to be Potter’s owl. He doesn’t see it because it’s still behind my back but I can feel my hands get all sweaty.
“Finally!” I shout and it isn’t until everyone snaps their head to look at me, I realise I said it outloud. Draco sits me back down and glares at anyone who looks at me weirdly.
He handed her a wand that was 9” and cherry wood with a phoenix feather core. Cass gave the wand a little swish and a burst of magic flew out, hitting a lantern and cutting the light off. Mr. Ollivander quickly pocketed the wand and went in search of another wand. It took three more tries, each wand different until he showed her the wand. She could feel the magic pulsing from it and she instantly knew it was her. As soon as the wood touched her palm, sparks of green and blue burst into the air. Cassiopeia grinned and her brother looked happy she found it. Her mother was less impressed, probably because it took a while, but she handed the wand to the old man so she could pay.
Rays of light blind me and I sigh. Once the sun begins to set is when I know it’s time to go. I don’t want to be caught out at night. I wave goodbye to the fish and trudge up the hill to Hogwarts, hoping to find my brother on the way. Students immediately make a path for me, not wanting to talk to a Slytherin like me. We made an impression on them and I sometimes feel like it was the wrong one.
“Okay, dude, take a deep breath, you look like you’re gonna faint,” The Head Boy told him and Draco let out a startled laugh, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly.
More people flinch again at the name though most saw it coming because of the topic of the conversation. It was dark and so I didn’t even bother looking over at Potter because I knew most people would be.
We all look to where he said and see three doors saying female, male and neutral. I am surprised to see the last one, not because I am against it but Hogwarts has never had neutral bathrooms before so it was odd for them to start now. Perhaps they had changed with the new rule in the common room as well, where both genders could go up either side’s dormitories. There’s also a table with food and I swear Weasley and Vincent and Greg look like they could devour the whole table.
Young Granger hugs her parents tight and I can’t help but wish I had the same relationship with my parents. My mother loved me and my brother will all her heart but she started to get more distant as we got older. Our father got more strict and he turned into the monster I always knew he would become. Draco didn’t think it would happen. We had good times when we were young and naive but now those times were gone.
"Sorry about him, are your parents muggles?" Cassiopeia asks. It was the only reasonable answer to why the boy wasn't immediately launching into conversation about Hogwarts.
There are gasps everywhere and Potter is looking at the floor and I’m getting flashbacks of our father doing the same, grabbing my hair and pinching my face. Draco and Pansy both intertwine their fingers with mine. I want to close my eyes but I can’t so I keep watching.
Their father was less excited and reminded them of the rules to their situation which consisted of not telling anyone their true identities, no socialising with anyone but the friends assigned to them and to keep their glamours on at all times.He told them to act proper and act like a Malfoy. His cold gaze was directed at her more than her brother since he knew she was more likely to act out of line. She nodded along though, not breaking eye contact.
“We didn’t go to a zoo, Blaise.” Draco says, raising his eyebrow at him. By now, everyone else is listening into our conversation.
“Oh! I have to introduce you guys,” Cass exclaimed, moving to the side to show the other people in the carriage, “This is Grace Kelly and Katrina Hoffman, my new friends, and this is Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson, my childhood best friends.”
She rolls her eyes but allows him to write it, passing him a pen and a piece of parchment paper. Once he has written a letter which takes longer than expected since he had to write every letter perfectly, they head up to the owlery. The Malfoy’s have numerous owls but Cassiopeia’s favourite was the Golden Masked owl called Perseus.
The twins look at each other and Cass tightens her grip on Draco’s hand. She wishes and prays to the stars above her that they will be sorted in the same house. They did all this work to be together and Cass was not going to have it all be ruined by a stupid hat. Their father wanted it to be a surprise how they were sorted but the night before September first, her brother couldn’t sleep so their mother had told them in hushed tones how it worked to calm his nerves.
Dudley is such a baby, bundled in blankets and shaking while his mother coddles him. My mother had done the same when my brother broke his arm but that was when we were six, not eleven. Potter and his uncle enter now and I can tell things aren’t going to end well.
I snicker, “Of course you wouldn’t notice me. I just so happened to be in your Potions class and Charms class for seven years.”
"Oh," Cass said, looking into the cage from the top at the black cat snuggled next to Diana, "I didn't see it there. Have you found a cat yet?"
The bird turns and allows us to enter. I drag my feet inside as Flinch grabs my brother’s arm and opens the headmaster's door, shoving us both into the doorway. I’m staring at my feet now, not wanting to meet Dumbledore’s eyes but a different voice reaches my ears.
Draco scowled at Millie but kept quiet as the Weasley twins lead them down a hallway. They stayed silent, not wanting to talk about their trial with the twins right there. Cass was slightly impressed at Millie for getting the two things they were struggling to find but she wasn’t happy with the price they had to pay.
On screen, our mother opens her mouth to reply but is interuptted. The floo sounded and someone entered the manor. The two kids turn around and grin at the person. He was dressed in all black and held two presents in his hands along with a letter. They run up to hug him.
The Bones family were part of the Sacred 28’, as well as the Abott’s if Cass remembered correctly from the many lessons her father and tutors had pounded into her, and she believed Susan’s aunt was high up in the Ministry.
This was it, as soon as Draco and Cassiopeia completed their trial they'll become a true Slytherin along with the rest of their friends. They were so close and all they needed to do was collect four things by 7pm, easy. But with sabotaging friends and a stolen bottle of pumpkin juice, the question is: is everyone really their friend or are some of them pretending for their reputation?
Had this boy not been told anything by his aunt and uncle? They must have known he was magical. Draco explains, "At the start, you get sorted into one of four houses- Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin."
“Are you like cousins?” Potter questions but I grasp Draco’s arm, “Well, look at the time. Let's go Draco.”
“Hey, Flinch-Fletchy! Remind you of the good ol’ days?” Draco can barely stop from laughing, a smirk on his face.
“To make things a bit more interesting, the first group gets to prank the others. Sabotaging is allowed.” Pansy smirked at her fellow first years, already planning how to restrict the others from winning.
The woman who did my robes gestures to the seat Draco was sitting in before. Young me huffs and sits in the seat.
Susan grins, “You wanna play a match too? Fun game, Hufflepuff vs Ravenclaw while the other two settle their bet or whatever they’re doing.”
When Katrina sat down across from her, there was a small smile on her face and the two nodded at each other. They weren’t close friends after the trip on the train but they were at least acquaintances. She watched as Katrina swivelled her head to look at the first years still waiting, her eyes catching Grace’s. Cass went through the alphabet in her head. Grace should be one of the next students and she was right when Professor McGonagall called out:
Hey guys, I'm gonna sound like any other fanfic writer/me in my other a/n and apologise for not updating. Again. I was not really interested in writing this and then when I was, I had exams sooooo
Sorry if this chapter was a bit stiff. I wrote this in my free time and wasn't really sure what to write. Yes, the letter they wrote seems like a fake but I don't know how to formal.
A boy next to them jumped forward, yelling “Trevor!” He grabs a toad in his shaky hands and quickly apologizes to Professor McGonagall. A few students laugh at the boy, including her brother, and she has to hold back a snigger. Instead, she elbows Draco to stop. The boy was obviously nervous about the ceremony and his classmates laughing at him wouldn’t help.
Potter flushes and clamps his hand over Weasley’s mouth. I share a look with my brother but he just shrugs, not sure what the two were talking about.
They reached the Slytherin entrance, a brick wall, without too much struggle (though Cass had accidentally dropped the book on Draco’s foot multiple times) and Cass whispered “
He glances at us, “Well, well, well, who do we have here. The Malfoy twins. Thought you would know not to get into trouble after the war happened. Let’s see what Dumbledore has to say, hm?”
Cass nods, “Yep. This is Diana and that’s Persephone. Watch out for that one though, she bites.” She points to the cat sitting in Draco’s lap. The cat almost seems to smirk which matches the smirk resting on her owner’s face.
We pass Potter, who gives us the thumbs up, telling us that the guys from the other two houses will be there. Draco and I decide to visit the Hufflepuff guys first so he knocks on their door. Ernie Macmillan answers the door and we tell him the same thing we have told everyone else and he agrees to go along with Oliver Rivers and Justin Finch- Fletchey.
We say our goodbyes and leave the common room. Draco sticks next to me, knowing Potter is going to ask about his hair incident. But Potter doesn’t say anything though all the way back to the eighth year common room, he keeps smirking. Maybe this is why he could’ve been a Slytherin because he is most likely using this for blackmail. He knows Draco would die if this got out. Sometimes, it feels like nothing has changed like it’s back to third year with Draco talking about Potter all day.
The two couldn’t answer though because they started to laugh harder, Grace glaring at her friends and so Theo replied for them, “Ignore them, Granger. They just find the names of these people hilarious.”
Granger was there at the end of the hallway with the two Patil’s. All four of them eyed my choice of clothing, Granger confused while the other three disgusted. I didn’t mind since the onesie was super comfy and I was imagining hitting them with my sleeves if they were closer to me.
Draco squeezed her hand tightly and she took a deep breath, steadying herself before walking up to the sorting hat. Eyes pierced through her back until she turned and sat on the stool. She had been sheltered from the public her entire life and no one had heard of their still being a young Black alive. They were assumed to be dead, married off, in Azkaban or disowned.
She rolls her eyes, “Pans thought you were taking “too long” so she went over to Tracey’s room to use their bathroom.”
The scene goes black but before I can apologise again to Hannah, the next scene shows. It’s the robe shop again but this time, it’s just me and Draco but now he is up on a stool next to me.
Her parents hadn't died but her story had to seem real. Draco nods along with her, "Your house will be like your family."
The house-elf apparates away and returns shortly after with another house-elf, this one wearing a dress with dirt all over it. “Miny is happy to help Young Master Draco and Young Mistress Cassiopeia.”
Draco awoke with a gasp, sitting up from the couch he had fallen asleep on. Perseus was perched on the armrest along with another owl, a letter on his leg sealed with the Blanc stamp, Matthias surname. He spots his sister sleeping on the couch opposite and grins, they must have fallen asleep while waiting for Matthias reply. He grins as he takes the letter of the owl. Ripping it open, he reads in his head the letter.
Draco giggled with his friends and decided he liked Gemma and the others. Hogwarts wasn’t the Manor, it didn’t have his Mother or the forest outback or the memories of his childhood but Hogwarts did have a humongous kitchen, all his friends and memories for the next seven years.
“So, care to explain why we were being nice to half-bloods Cass?” Pansy asked once they were all sitting back down and Blaise added, “Yeah, and to a Weasley?”
It’s casual conversation after the introductions, Draco even joining in a few times. They’re not instantly bonding and becoming life-long friends but at least the two aren’t shutting them out. She found out that they are both half-bloods. Grace has a little sister, two years younger, and an older sister in third year in Ravenclaw. Her mother is a muggleborn witch and her father is a muggle and they all live in a muggle town which explains why she doesn’t know the Malfoy name. Katrina is an orphan, living with her foster mother and didn’t find out she was a witch until her birthday last October. Apparently, the two knew each other from school and recognized each other at the station.
Of course, she could not just wait until her birthday because if two letters showed up, one saying she got in and one saying she didn’t, that would cause chaos. Cassiopeia knew she got in because any school would be mad to reject a Malfoy and if they did, her father would be stomping over to the head of the school and demanding they let her in. She didn’t like knowing it was just her name and fortune that got her things, not her talent or skills but she couldn’t complain.
The CD plays again and I beg and pray that it’s not me because I’ve spent my whole life being invisible and I’m not ready for people to discover me. The screen shows a nice house and I know I’ve never been there before so I instantly relax into my seat. If my life was going to be shown, at least it wouldn’t be first. Someone’s breath hitches and I glance over to see Susan looking ghostly white. This must be her home.
Pansy and I stare at each other, our answers completely different and confusing the two boys even more. We start laughing.
One of the next few names called after was, “Longbottom Neville.” The Longbottom family were part of the Sacred 28 as well though they were known as blood-traitors. The boy looked like he was going to pee his pants. Draco felt bad for him except when the hat surprisingly yelled, “GRYFFINDOR!” and Longbottom ran to the table with the hat still on.
"Were?" Draco says and she almost yells at him. They had no idea what this boy was going through if his parents were gone or something else had happened.
Tracey stops when I look at her but Katrina stares at me. It’s intense and I suddenly wish I hadn’t started this because the other girl could go for minutes without blinking. Pansy pushed Katrina’s face away, rolling her eyes, “Stop it you two so we can continue the movie.”
Sally-Anne was on one of the couches and when she looked up at me, she giggled, “Nice onesie, Cass.”
Up at the teachers table, Professor McGonogall smiles, “Your parents were probably my most easiest parents to convince.”
Potter and his gang seem to wince at the fact. They will be surprised at what emotion Severus can show. I glance up at him sitting at the table and he catches my eye, the corner of his mouth lifting upwards. I smile back.
None of the other professors seem shocked and Professor McGonagall rolls out a sheet of paper, “When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted in your houses.”
“Silence, please.” Headmaster Dumbledore claps his hands together and the candle light dims, “The next section of the CD is about to start.”
Pansy elbows me in the side, getting my attention, and says, “You should do it too, it feels good to be out to everyone.”
They found Cass, Blaise and Millie in the back of the library where the glass cases filled with antique artifacts were and in Blaise’s hand was a Hufflepuff’s cup. It was a duplicate of course but not like the one in the case was real either. Draco knew from eavesdropping on his parents conversations that his aunt, Bellatrix, kept the cup in her vault in Gringotts. Why she had it made no sense to him but he was never concerned with the reason.
This was on purpose of course because their father did not want the world to know he had a daughter for personal reasons. Having an only child was respected and even having more children was fine but twins were bad luck. It was also the reason that their father did not think females should have equal rights but should take care of the children and cook and clean. That’s why their mother did not get her dream job, to be a herbologist because she was supposed to learn to be the perfect wife and herbology was a laughed-open subject, their mother would never have gotten permission to pursue it.
I hear Draco mutter, “Properly from another one of his adoring fans.” and I’m thankful that no one hears it. Just from these glimpses in Potter’s life I can tell he wasn’t as loved as we believed him to be.
Even from here, I can hear Potter’s jaw snap shut. The whole student body knew about Professor Quirrell who had been fired for working with the Dark Lord but no one knew the real situation. I had heard from someone that Potter had faced off against Quirrell himself so seeing him again on the screen must be shocking.
Theo and Blaise sniggered at him and Draco couldn’t help but laugh a bit as well. He stopped though when he imagined Cass scolding him for his manners. His sister seemed to have imprinted on him even when she wasn’t next to him. The next two students after that were twins and one went into Hufflepuff while the other was a Slytherin. Funny how the two students before his name were twins, just like him and his sister should of been.
Potter flinches again at the loud volume and a few of my fellow Slytherins do as well. I try not to think of why but my mind goes to the many times my father was ashamed of me. The feeling of the palm of his hand against my cheek or the pain he could put on me with only a flick of his wand.
The two siblings held their breath, waiting for the last rule. “I have assigned you two under different last names, from now on at school, you will be Draco Malfoy and Cassiopeia Black. No one will know you are siblings, twins are bad luck in the pureblood world and I can’t have that on my reputation.”
“Is that you, Headmaster?” Grangers asks, squinting at the screen to get a closer look. Dumbledore does not answer her though.
She hopped all the way to their mother, who gave them a nod of approval, and then proceeded to bounce to the counter. Once they reached the front, the owner's eyes widened at the site of the cage the girl was holding. His face drained of colour and he frantically shook his head, "Those, those cats are not for sale."
Again, really sorry to leave you guys alone out there with no more of this awesome fanfic to read lol but here is another chapter.
She shrugs, “I was thinking maybe one of the house-elves could since father wouldn’t recognize their handwriting.”
I shake my head along with Draco. I nervously shuffle in my seat, Potter sitting on the other end with Draco on the armchair. It seems now that Draco notices the owl next to me that I’m trying to hide behind my body.
“Go get dressed boys, we’ll be in the common room,” Pansy shooed Draco into the bathroom to get ready and then leaves with Cass.
“The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily.” Professor McGonagall spun around and left through the large doors into the Great Hall, her robes swishing behind her.
The manor was quiet when the two children entered, no sign of their parents anywhere. The blinds on the windows were drawn shut even though it was the afternoon. A candle was lit on a table in the family room, the wax slowly dripping down the side and onto the table. Cassiopeia walked over and picked the candle up, blowing it out while the boy opened the curtains, letting the natural light come into the house.
They both nodded frantically, dark magic is something not to be messed with. No wonder it smelled bad. An owl flies through the open window and Draco realises it is Abelard with the letter they forged in its beak. How did it know to give it to their father? The owl must be highly trained to do that. Cassiopeia fiddled with her fingers as their father took the letter from the owl, the owl biting his fingertip. Their father scowled and sent it away, ripping the envelope open slowly, his bony fingers pulling the letter out of the envelope.
Cassiopeia gets dared to steal someone else's owl. It's okay though, she has Draco with her and she has snuck out loads of times before. She is worrying though because a) Pansy could of done much worse (so why didn't she?) b) she accidentally stole Potter's owl and c) Flinch is after them which only ever ends one way- in detention.
“Could we also get a vial of crushed dragon scales from his potion cupboard?” Blaise wondered but Cass already knew the answer to that.
Blaise snatched it from their hands, earning yells of protest from the girls and smirked, “What’s this? A list of the hottest guys in the school? And- oh? My name at the top?”
When I look back at the screen, my eyes widen. How rich were these people? And if they were so rich, why did they have Potter sleep in a cupboard? I was confused and I could tell my friends were shocked at the presents as well.
The sun shined through the windows of my dorm, causing me to open my eyes. The other girls in my dorm, Pansy, Daphne and Millicent, were still asleep so I swung my legs over the side of the bed and stood up. my vision blurred for a second before I gained my balance and it turned back to normal. I looked around for my wand and once I found it, I cast
“Everyone knows who Harry Potter is, saviour of the wizarding world,” Draco mutters and I rest my head on his shoulder, “And everyone knows me, death-eater.”
Draco sighed in relief and handed the hat to Professor McGonagall. He walked down the stairs with his head high as the hall clapped for him. His sister was even whistling from where she was standing. Draco sat down next to her and she squeezed his hand.
The way she says squib is with disgust and I can’t help but feel bad for Longbottom. I overheard once that he had never shown any magic until he was thrown out a window and he bounced all the way down the street. Granger wraps her arms around Longbottom and he just sighs.
His hair turned a blood orange from frustration which made him even madder from the irony. To this day, his sister was the only one who could get a reaction out of him. Crossing his arms over his chest, the boy says, “Quel type de jeu?”
>I nod, "Our father made it very clear to us that if we made a fool of ourselves or dissapointed him, we would be sent away to Drumstrang, or worse."
“Of course complex magic came naturally to the Chosen One as a child. What else could you do, aperate?” My brother sneers under his breath but it isn’t as low as he thought since the others hear.
“Of course,” I say, rolling my eyes and Draco laughs, looking over my shoulder before saying the password, “Rosica is endgame.”
We stroll up to the 8th year common room together, the other Slytherins leave us to make their way to the dungeons. We make a few jokes here and there until we reach the painting. I’m about to say the password ‘lemon tarts’ when it swings open and Potter, Weasley and Granger exit. I’m not exactly sure why I use their last names because I never really spoke to them. I once asked Granger for help with a Transfiguration essay because no one else was around and she glared at me away so maybe that's why.
The cursive of the note reminds me of the signature of the Headmistress Madame Maxime of Beauxtrons. I have only seen it once and that was in the letter of acceptance to Beauxtrons which I then burned and replaced with a rejection letter so I could get into Hogwarts. I had believed back then that I could change my brother into a better person but I discovered I myself was not a better person either and that our father had a bigger influence on us then I thought.
“Cass, you took the wrong handbag!” She says to me before pulling me off to the side so the trio cannot hear her.
Potter nodded to his friend and Draco rolled his eyes at them. What did they have against the girl? He had a reason since she was a muggleborn, although Cass had been lecturing him lately how that wasn’t a reason and he was just being rude. So, to satisfy his sister and annoy Weasley, he backed up and stepped on the boy’s shoe.
“‘Mione.” Wealsey says, grabbing onto her arm, “I think you should leave him be. Might be best if he has some time alone right now.”
Hope you enjoy the first chapter! The other language is french and the italics is english. This manor is not in England but in France. Any questions just comment!
It’s silent in the room and Potter stands up and goes into the side room. My eyes are wide. Of course this was about Potter but I didn’t think we’d watch what happened that night. The screams of his mother… I don’t know how I’d handle hearing my mother’s death, not alone, people watching it.
Their father crumbles the letter in his hand and throws it on the table, their mother dashing over to read it for herself. He looks right at Cassiopeia, “What is this nonsense?!”
Everyone shivers at that and we try and think of more ideas. Daphne speaks up, “What about Never Have I Ever?”
The three girls mentioned agree with the plan though Cass looks over to Grace and Katrina at the end conversing with other muggleborn and half-bloods in Slytherin. She would have liked to be in a dorm with them but she guessed she would just have to see them at meals and in classes. Besides, she doesn’t mind being in a dorm with the other girls. They are quite nice and thankfully Millie is a halfblood so it would be a bunch of pureblood supremacists. Perhaps they will help her with getting Draco and the other students to be more inclusive.
A few laughed at young Potter’s confused face but most weren’t going to risk laughing at a sad moment like this.
My brother and all the guys had never learnt to cook but the house elves taught me at a young age. A woman in the pureblood world had to know how to be the perfect housewife which included cooking. Some families were less fortunate and didn’t own a house elf while others preferred homemade meals sometimes so it was a skill that was needed. I wasn’t a good cook and I undercooked the first meal that I made. My brother had to eat it and he had food poisoning for a week afterwards.
He turns his attention to Weasley and the Gryffindors, who, as usual, were eavesdropping, “I could hold a wand, Wealsey. Anyone can. I was left-handed as a child though and my father had me switch to my right hand since left-handed children were seen as bad omens. I’m fine now but it took a few months before it was comfortable doing magic with that hand.”
Everyone shrieks at the gun firing and it takes both Draco and Pansy’s nails digging into my palm to bring me back to the present. It sounded like an exploding spell or body parts snapping.
Her mind racks her brain for the information she had crammed into it a few days ago about wand woods and cores. If her memory is correct, a phoenix feather for a core was rare and are generally very picky on their owner, their loyalty must be earned. Willow wood is also an uncommon wand wood and has healing power and choose those with the greatest potential. It confuses her why the wand would select her out of all people. Certainly there were better people out there? Yet the wand did not protest as it was wrapped up in a box and soon Cassiopeia had to accept that this was her wand. It had chosen her.
Draco sighed, hugging the letter to his chest. Matthias was perfect but if only he wanted Draco. He was only ten, though, perhaps when he was older Matthias would want him. His sister did not know of the incident that happened a year ago when he tried to court Matthias and Draco got rejected. It was embarrassing and he had been punished by his father and so he did not repeat to his sister. He hadn’t given up though but maybe he should.
“Your attention, please.” Professor McGonagall says and the students turn to see Dumbledore rise from his chair.
But if you've read my other HP book (the watching their movies one) you'll see its kind of related to this one (except in this one Draco and the golden trio are friends :D but in the other one it's the same as canon but with Cass) and Theo and the Slytherins are friends again :)
“Sure but by the time it was my turn, I had already been there four times for the others. Besides, most of my stuff was hand-me downs.” Weasley replies and he sneaks a glance towards the Slytherins. No one says anything against his family and their amount of money so he relaxes back in his chair.
There is laughter at the insult. It stops when an older woman, a mother personally, walks into the room.
Could he not count? I thought to myself and it wasn’t until Pansy elbowed in the ribs that I realised I said it outloud. My face flushed and I contrasted into my seat as people stared at me. They hadn’t heard what I said but they knew I said something. No one said anything and they let it go.
There is an awkward silence until Blaise speaks up. “Do you think a muggle zoo is the same as the wizard one we went to for Draco’s seventh birthday?” He doesn’t talk loud but the others hear what he says. I don’t remember going to a zoo for any of our birthdays.
Ghosts soar across their heads and the first years gasp. Cass had seen a ghost before, one of their neighbors had one in their attic but never quite so many. They talked with each other about the group below them and wished them good luck before flying away. Draco continued to stare after them until someone walked up to them.
Draco sneers at the screen and I fight back the urge to do so as well. If I want to get better, I have to stop acting superior and thinking places that others go to that purebloods don’t, like the Leaky Cauldron, are disgusting. I elbow my brother in the ribs, letting him know his reaction is unnecessary. I wouldn’t bother usually but in a room full of Gryffindors, it’s risky showing emotions, especially negative ones. Those always get twisted against you.
She just laughs, “We’re friends, I’ve already forgiven you. Besides, I really should be saying sorry to Draco for how I acted.”
His sister's eyes then widened and mouthed ‘your hair’ which Draco caught. Peeking up at his hair, he could see the tips were a light pink matching his face. He zoned out of the conversation, focussing on keeping his hair under control. His hair usually changed automatically when he felt strong emotions but their father had drilled meditation into them at a young age to calm their emotions. It worked quite well and he never slipped up in front of others. His sister was an exception; she always got a rise out of him and he needed to stop letting her get to him or else his secret would get out.
Cassiopeia held the letter in her hand and realised they had one problem, how would they give it to their father? An owl would not work for the only ones accessible to them were their own owls which their father would easily recognize. Unless she asked one of her friends if she could borrow their owl.
Dean Thomas holds her back and goes to say something when something strange happens on the screen. I gasp. It was accidental magic but how was Potter at age ten able to make glass disappear completely?
Katrina and Tracey snigger in the row behind me, Grace hitting them both on the back of their heads. I thanked her in my head for doing that because I couldn’t think of a worse time to be laughing. Of course, I was trying not to laugh at it myself. These names made my brother and I’s ridiculous long names not that bad.
They raced up the stairs to the astronomy tower, Blaise trailing behind them with the book still in his hands. Once they reached the top, one of the Prefects took pity on him and levitated the book to where the rest of them were sitting. Blaise flashed a thankful smile and hurried to where his group was sitting.
An owl comes swooping in through an open window and I can tell it's a Hogwarts owl. On the screen, a little stubby girl comes running into the kitchen and takes the letter from the owl’s foot so it can fly away. She isn’t Susan though but her younger sister, Eleanor Bones, who was four years younger and went to a private wizarding school in Italy. Another young girl dashes into the room. She has wavy blonde hair and she grabs the letter from her sister.
It was the History of Hogwarts book that they recommended to all muggle born students to read before coming. Cass read it once when she was younger but found it boring after a few pages. Her mother had explained all the important things about Hogwarts from her time there so there was no need for her to read the book. She couldn’t say that so she said the first thing that came to mind.
I almost groaned out loud, of course, there were rules. What possibly could we mess up? Dumbledore continued, “The first rule is, there will be no spoilers from you about the future during these CDs. I understand that we have already gone through all of this but some people weren’t as updated as others. If a major spoiler is about to be said, you will find yourself unable to speak until you talk about a different topic.”
Draco and Pansy went off to find the most Ravenclaw book they could find while Cass and the others went to go duplicate the cup. He was looking for a blue book but that proved harder than he thought. In the end, Pansy found a book about birds and they deemed that close enough.
She whispered in their ears, “They’re half-bloods but they don’t know who we are exactly. Be nice to them, we’re trying something new.”
“It’s alright, she usually acts like that.” Longbottom says which isn’t alright at all because it isn’t good if she acts like that all the time. I don’t speak up though. I’m a Slytherin, they would only find a way to twist my words into something rude.
We didn’t see Potter at all when we left the common room at ten forty-five to go to the great hall nor did we pass him in the hallways. I found that odd but it was like Potter to be late so I wasn’t too surprised. Draco, though, kept looking down hallways as if the boy would just randomly appear. After a few minutes, we reached the large wooden doors of the great hall. No one was inside except for some teachers, including Dumbledore, because breakfast ended at ten for classes. It was a Sunday though, so no classes but students were out playing and hanging with friends.
ALSO, if there are any characters that you would like to be heard more (I'll do more Neville ofc) or if I'm missing any, let me know! I've kind of forgotten about Luna and Ginny and other younger years bc I orignally thought I didn't include them since they don't appear until next year but then I remember in the second chapter, Cass, Harry and Draco got them so idk.
Young Draco and I grab our respected presents and rip them open. I’m more gentler than my brother but he gasps as he holds up a book. It was about psychology and the wizard mind when spells are applied to them. I wasn’t interested in that stuff but at a young age, Draco would read anything he could about it. My gift was a plain bracelet with pendants on it. There was a snake, a crown, a flower and a cat. You could buy more but I loved it already. But then I noticed the small bag which when I opened it, held a necklace. The pendant on it was a healing crystal. Those crystals inhanced healing spells and coud cure small injuries. I gasped and with a stern look from Severus, I hid it from my parents piercing gaze.
’. A snake emerged from the end of his wand and landed on the floor. It slithered up Draco’s robes and around his neck. Cass recognised it as one of the snakes they had in the Manor as pets.
Her brother sneers at them and she can’t yell an insult at them because the hat is placed on her head, covering a bit of her eyesight.
The words are in French and I relax into my seat. No one will be able to understand us. This was a relief. Unfortunately, other people are not as happy as us.
She was not going to back down now when she was so close to being free of not having to control her emotions and pretend to be the cold, perfect daughter. She could finally be a kid again with her brother. The only thing in between her and her dream was her father and just because she happened to be related to him, that was not going to stop her. She had waited much too long for this.
“Hi, er, sorry for sitting in your compartment. All the others were full.” The smaller of the two with glasses spoke. She seemed shy and obviously thought the two would throw them out or at least yell at them.
Her finger almost didn't fit through the bars but she was ready to pull it back if she bit her. She did the opposite, sniffing it before giving it a little lick. Cassiopeia smiled and grasped the cage in her arms and walked back into the open area of the shop. What she failed to notice in the darkness of the back of the shop was that Diana was not the only creature in the cage. Her brother pointed this out to her when she showed him her new pet.
She scoffs, “Please, don’t act all innocent. You were hiding money in your clothes just like Draco was.”
Draco was impressed and he inspected the vial in his hand. The dragon scales were fresh and weren’t a cheap kind. He could tell why Severus ordered from them. He re-opened his trunk, placed the vial inside and locked it once more. “Did you pay them?”
“The second rule is commentary during the CDs is allowed though it would be good to keep it short. If a conversation goes on for too long, we will pause the CDs so no one misses anything,” Dumbledore says, bringing everyone’s focus back to him.
I look up to the Professor sitting at the long table in front of the screen and I’m ashamed of myself that I didn’t recognize the cat was her. I have seen her animagus so many times around Hogwarts that I should have been able to know it was her. I remember that my brother told me that Blaise and Theo were late for class once and they thought they were safe but Professor McGonagall was in her cat form and caught them. I’ve never let them forget about that.
The train comes to a stop and the four of them hurry off with the rest of the students. Cass latches onto Draco so they don’t get seperated and listen to the large man yelling instructions.
Young Pansy is carrying a couple of books in her arms and a bag hangs off one of her arms. Pansy next to me sinks lower in her seat and I fumble to find her hand and when I do, I squeeze it. Young Pansy then bumps into someone but she doesn’t drop anything.
Blaise nodded, “Pans is right, technically what they did was fair. Besides, we’ll waste even more time if we chase after them.”
There is a sadness that drifts through the room at Potter’s words. He never got to know his parents and lives in a cupboard with horrible relatives that treat him like dirt. My parents are alive but as a child, they ignored me and favoured my brother more for the simple fact that he would carry the Malfoy name and I wouldn’t. They couldn’t even accept the fact we were twins, making me switch last names throughout my seven years at Hogwarts. Since my father was now gone, my mother had no control over my personal information so I changed back. I understand what it's like to be treated less than others which is why I never understood that muggleborns and half bloods were bad. The way my father acted towards them was the same way he acted towards me when we were alone and I was a pureblood so it made no sense. My brother took a bit more convincing to switch mindsets.
I stick my tongue out at him but I know he was right. Our mother called me ‘princess’ a few times but it never really stuck. Pansy is nudging at me to look back at the screen to look at this muggle contraption, a car. Those things look dangerous to me. A large box on wheels. Pansy was quite fascinated with them, especially the ones muggles deemed expensive but to me they sounded stupid.
My brother smiles at me, engulfing me in a hug before shooing me off to get ready myself. This is when I realise I’m still wearing my pyjamas and that since last night I failed my dare technically because I didn’t bring back an owl, Pansy chose what I had to wear to bed which happened to be a dragon onesie from Draco’s closet. It was two sizes too big so I could flap the sleeves around and hit people. I also realised I had just walked through the common room in my onesie and now I had to go back through the common room to get to my dorm.
A booming noise startled him and he glanced up at the sky to see a burst of red fireworks. He watched the firework show with awe, ooohing and awwing when appropriate, and felt sad when it ended a few minutes later. The Prefects and Head Boy/Girl began dismissing everyone but as he walked down the stairs he couldn’t help but ask Gemma a question.
The wand shop didn't look as impressive as she expected. It was dusty and the windows were covered with stacks of wand boxes. Their mother was already waiting inside so they both headed inside. An old man in the back turned around to face them as the bell signalling their arrival sounded off. He grinned and walked out to greet them.
Despite everything else changing, his mother had not lost her habit of gossiping about the neighbors and other wizarding families. At least now it was harmless gossip, though. This time, she told him how it was rumored that Neville Longbottom was going to propose to his girlfriend of something like two and a half years, Hannah Abott. Draco wouldn't be surprised if it was true, but he wondered why anyone would know and gossip about it before Neville had actually proposed.
In a few moments, Ron had jumped up and was almost to the common room door. He hesitated when he heard soft voices in the common room. He stilled and slowly crept forward, doing everything he could not to be heard.
The hand shaking the quill suddenly stopped as Harry reached out and grabbed his hand to hold it still. Ron gave an apologetic look and stopped his frantic movement.
They held a staring match for a minute, until Harry gave up with a sigh. “Fine. I'll just take care of myself.”
“What in blazes makes you think that?” He tried to keep his face blank. The last thing he wanted was all his friends talking about Harry tonight. This was their one night a week to get some greasy food, drink too much for their age, and forget any stressful parts of their life.
And when Harry risked his life to pull Draco from a raging fire, testified for him at his trials, forgave him easily, and saved the entire world from what Draco had resigned to be inevitable, what was Draco supposed to do?
It was a nice fantasy, one he allowed himself to indulge in during their return year to Hogwarts. There was no real harm in studying Harry in the library and Great Hall, listening to and watching him with his friends in the Common Room, or daydreaming about being with him.
“Hmm?” He looked up to see the eyes of the girls around him – Cho, Parvarti, and Weaselette– all looking at him for an answer.
“Oh, we're definitely flirting when we bicker,” the same one said, no shame whatsoever. There were a few laughs and vague cheers. He gritted his teeth, his eyes scouring the room until they landed on the two in front of them.
He had come into work this morning with some new ideas for the confidence potion, eager to try them. His plan was to adjust the Draught of Peace with some ingredients from Wit-Sharpening Potion and Elixir to Induce Euphoria. Happy, sharp-tongued, and without anxiety – that sounded like confidence to Draco. He’d considered incorporating some aspects of Felix Felicis, but he was hoping he wouldn’t have to work with such a lengthy and intensive potion. The store hadn't been short on too much product in store, so he'd been able to get started on experimenting earlier than he'd hoped. Draco made a face as the potion turned the color of mud. Even from where he was standing, he could smell it. It wasn't pretty. He sighed as he crossed another idea off his list and emptied the cauldron. It would be necessary to use a lot of ingredients to experiment on dozens – maybe hundreds – of versions of the potion, and some of them were quite expensive. But if they were able to sell a working Confidence Potion, Draco knew they'd get their investment back tenfold.
Malfoy sat up and rolled his eyes. “Flattery won't get you out of this.” He moved back so Harry could sit up properly. “My fault really. Why would I trust you to handle the spells?” It stung, but Harry knew he deserved it. He'd really messed up.
“I'm still 80% sure this is some kind of trap or trick. But... just in case it's not, thank you, Malfoy. This is... incredible.” Malfoy just smiled politely and nodded at her, disappearing as suddenly as he'd arrived.
Potter over the years – at weddings, and parties, and simply walking the streets of wizarding London. They would share a polite nod or exchange of last names as a greeting. If they wound up at the same event, they would usually end up having a short conversation. But he had not spoken to Potter, not really, in three years.
And so it went on. Malfoy and Ron held weekly chess matches, Malfoy complimentary when Ron won and polite when Ron lost. He studied with Hermione once or twice a week, and listened to the rants Ron and Harry quickly grew bored of. Even Ginny joined Malfoy for Quidditch practice every so often.
Granger was curled up on the couch reading, and Weasley was draped across her. Draco wouldn't have been surprised if he was actually asleep. A random assortment of other Eighth Years were sitting in the group of chairs and couches behind them.
“Weird. I feel like... you might also be out after curfew for no good reason. And you don't seem to avoid an argument any more than I do...”
A large cauldron sat in the middle of the room. The left wall was covered in shelves of the most common ingredients, while the rarer ones were stored in a cabinet in the corner. On the right was a workbench where he created the non-potion items.
“In so many words. It wasn't hard to figure out that overly-adoring him on his birthday was the last thing he wanted.” The girls both looked lost in thought.
“Yes, among our 3,000 other ancient books. It took ages to find it – the older ones aren't properly cataloged.”
“Except ungrateful pricks like you, apparently,” Ron muttered under his breath. Draco sighed, rubbing his temple.
He quickly looked around the room, almost immediately noting that Harry's bed was empty. He let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding. Harry must have woken him up when he went to the bathroom.
Draco gulped. His eyes flicked to the lips in front of him. “So,” he whispered, his voice somehow hoarse even though he had barely said anything. “You don't give a damn if I kiss you?”
“Would you shut up? I wasn't saying it like that. I wasn't bragging. I'm saying... you are the only person, probably in the entire world, who would mock me like that. Making fun of my... title,” he finished with a sour look on his face. “You are the only person I know that doesn't treat me like I'm the Savior, like I'm made of glass, that doesn't fawn over me like... Even the Weasleys and my friends, they act like I'm perfect and try to spoil me. They never call me out for stupid things or insult me anymore. Like they think I-I can't handle messing around because I went through so much in the war, but... but you are literally the only person who doesn't give a shit that I'm, that I...”
"What are you doing?" The brunette snapped the map out of Ron's sight as if he hadn’t already seen it. Ron gave him a disappointed look. Harry shrugged.
If the roles had been reversed, Ron would have fought it. He would have told Harry that his friends needed to accept it, that his friends needed to make an effort, too, that they needed to grow up. Even he wouldn't have blamed Malfoy if he'd done something like that.
“Thank you, Harry. That was actually really good.” When Harry didn't answer, Draco looked up to find Harry smirking at him. “What?”
The apology was long and seemed downright genuine. Malfoy didn't make excuses for himself, or hint that Ron had done anything wrong to him, and took the time to apologize for everything he'd done the past seven years. Ron still didn't like the git at all and he knew they'd never be friends, but they came to an agreement that Ron would be civil to him. There was a similar conversation with Hermione that Ron wasn't there for. But she also agreed to be civil and polite and somewhat forgave Malfoy.
Ron sighed in relief, and Hermione suggested he talk to the mind Healer that was now employed full-time at the school, and Harry smiled vaguely and nodded when it felt right.
Ron nodded, too confused to think of a response. He met Hermione's eye, and she looked just as lost.
Draco sighed as he turned the shower up a little hotter. It was the first time in ages he'd thought about Harry in the shower. It had happened constantly when he'd first moved in, knowing that Harry had lived in the apartment for two years before giving it to Draco. But here he was again, picturing Harry naked in his shower. The good thing – or was it terribly pathetic? - was that usually it wasn't even particularly sexual. Just Harry showering.
“How do you not get it? I don't give a damn if you insult me, or praise me, or argue with me, or kiss me. I care that I know you're doing it because of who I am, not my title or fame or any of those meaningless things.
to insult me. I feel like this is the same way you'd treat me if I wasn't the Chosen One, or whatever stupid name you want to pick.”
“Exactly why I'm doing this,” he muttered. Granger set down the cake they must have just brought up from the kitchens on the coffee table.
“Harry, you didn't...” he shrugged again. Harry grabbed another copy that had been left down the table and read it for himself. Merlin only knew if the reporter would actually report what he'd said. He skimmed the first paragraph, a few lines about how Hogwarts was a safe environment that had rebuilt so well since the war.
"The bathroom door, too?" Malfoy asked with a raised brow. Harry started to argue, but realized that he had no idea if someone was in the bathroom. He hadn't even considered that someone could have come through the bathrooms from the other dorm entrance. "And the silencing charm?"
“Harry.” The brunette looked up at Hermione's gentle voice. “We wanted to talk to you about something.” Harry straightened up from where he had slumped against the couch. That didn't sound good.
“I thought she might appreciate a second chance at that great night. With you, this time.” Ron blinked at the boy before him. It was thoughtful, and sentimental, and something he knew, without a doubt in his mind, Hermione would appreciate. It was exactly what he'd been looking for.
When Teddy's plate was almost empty, he pushed it away and sat back in his chair. Everything was gone but a few bites. Harry raised one eyebrow and looked away from Teddy haughtily.
“To be fair,” Neville interjected, “that's not that far off from how you showed your affection for Hermione for a long time.” He gave a pointed look to Ron.
“You're welcome... Hermione.” Ginny started, but Hermione smacked her again. He had to admit, despite the fact that she had punched him once, she had always been the most tolerable of them. She was at least intelligent and mostly reasonable. Ginny started to get up, but stopped when she noticed Hermione still sitting. She clearly had more to ask, judging by her face. Ginny slowly sat back down.
“A Flash,” she repeated, flabbergasted. “I'm going to assume you mean something other than the latest model of broomstick?” Malfoy shook his head.
Ron felt his eyes narrowing. “So you thought we should recreate that lovely evening?” Malfoy laughed lightly. It was still odd to hear the perfectly friendly noise coming from his once-hated rival. A laugh at something
“We're waiting,” sing-songed one of the Patils. Draco couldn't for the life of him tell them apart, even with the different robes. He always mixed up which name went with which House. Wait-
When Harry called them to the kitchen half an hour later, Draco was surprised to see an actual meal laid out. He had no idea why, but he had assumed Harry couldn't cook and would make a frozen dinner or something in the microwave.
"Oh." Harry took his time tying the letter to the owl's leg. "You want one? A pet?" Malfoy turned to the owl again and nodded.
“Well, I wouldn't quite phrase it like that.” Draco quickly explained why he had shown up that day. “I would have left when I saw Harry was there, but Teddy asked me to stay. You know how I am when Teddy asks for something.”
“I realized that you were never really the person I’d thought you were – you were never the person your father tried to make you. You were much softer, and kinder, and less judgmental. I testified in your defense because you deserve everyone’s forgiveness. A second chance. I snapped at the reporter for the same reasons. You don't deserve to be seen as a dark Wizard any more than I deserve to be seen as some perfect savior.
Blaise and Pansy were sitting across from them in the booth. “No Theo today?” Draco asked, eager to get the attention off himself. Pansy shook her head.
Draco stared at the table for a long time after they had left. Was Hermione saying she wouldn't mind if they – if he and Harry – were together? Was she saying that... that she thought they were a good fit? And what did she mean by, 'Harry wouldn't even be opposed to it?' Did she know how Harry felt, that he might-
Mondays were usually Draco's day to relax. He spent the morning focused on the project he'd been working on for some time. After being unable to solve the issue with magic for a year, he had relented and found some books on the muggle way to fix it. He'd read the books, talked with some experts, and had recently started actually working on it. He'd been worried the magic would reject it – even the muggle method of fixing it – but there hadn't been any issues so far.
problems. Something was going on. He felt like he was one step away from cracking it, but what was that last step?
“You're such a git.” Hermione and Ron didn't chastise Draco when they realized Harry was slightly grinning at him. Grinning. He hadn't grinned in days.
“Sorry. I guess I'm bored with nothing dangerous happening this year. Maybe it's just force of habit, I don't know. But I'll... leave you alone.” Harry left, trying to convince himself he could even do that.
It had been years since Draco had last seen Harry Potter. Well, years since he had spoken to him for more than five minutes.
He'd kept tabs on Harry, of course. He read the Prophet articles about him and overheard gossip, but assumed little of it was true. The only source of information he mostly trusted was George, but he enjoyed messing with Draco far too much to fully trust him.
“It was the right thing to do. You didn't deserve Azkaban. Neither of you.” Malfoy smiled slightly at him.
“We thought that maybe...” Hermione took a deep breath, then blurted it out. “Maybe there's a reason that you're pretending you think he's up to something.” Harry scoffed. Why else would he want to stare at that angelic face and watch the way his eyes twinkled when he read a part of a book that he enjoyed and hear him mutter to himself when he studied-
There were a few moments of silence as everyone dug into their fried food. Pansy moaned when she ate her first bite of onion rings. “Ugh, I hate being on a diet. Saturday nights are the only times I'm happy.”
“Yes.” Draco stared him down, wondering if Harry was about to punch him. Harry clenched his fist like he was considering it. After a long-drawn-out staring contest, Harry suddenly stormed off into the dorms.
All at once, Ron felt a wave of dread. Something was off in the room, but he couldn't place it. After looking around for a minute, he realized that although the curtains were almost drawn all the way, he could see that Malfoy's bed was empty, too.
“But... I didn't see that at your party? I'm certain, because I wrote down every gift and who gave it to you so that you could write thank you cards, which you haven't started, by the way.”
“I don't expect you to understand, Weasley. But Granger, use that big brain of yours. Why do you think he doesn't want to hear about his accomplishments? Why haven't your attempts at cheering him worked?” Hermione's anger was replaced with confusion.
Ron took a deep breath. He started to go back to bed – he'd really seen and heard all his heart could take, to be honest – when Harry said his name.
He took a deep breath and stopped himself. They'd all made mistakes. They'd bullied Malfoy and his friends nearly as much. They'd all done things in the war. Malfoy had saved their lives when it mattered. He'd been cleared of all charges, with just a precautionary monitored probation. They had apologized and talked through it. It would never be undone or forgotten. But they had forgiven.
“Nope.” The 'p' popped like a bubble. Draco closed his eyes, the flush he had so proudly detained pouring out all at once. “I didn't say what it was at all.”
He was sitting alone on one of the stone benches outside of Hogwarts, his back against a pillar and his knees pulled to his chest, eating an apple he'd snatched from the Great Hall. His Potions textbook sat on the bench in front of him, abandoned for a while now. Harry had just closed his eyes and relaxed fully when-
He held up a finger to the owl, as if the creature could understand the gesture. It almost seemed like she did; she stopped tapping and sat patiently on the windowsill.
“It was a good talk, Draco,” he said politely, maybe even professionally. He nodded at Draco and walked to the bedrooms without another word.
“I'll give them two days. I can't sit around forever waiting for Weasley to solve a simple problem.”
“They were saying that... it was us flirting.” He wasn't sure why he told Harry. Perhaps because he knew they would undoubtedly have the same conversation with him at some point. The least he could do was help Harry be more prepared for that storm than he was.
“Are you five?” Draco asked, his voice stern. “I'm not saying he's innocent, but neither are you. We all heard you arguing and you said some really shit things, even if it was to Weasley.” Harry started to speak, but Draco continued. “You're making your friends uncomfortable and miserable. Weasley's obviously miserable. You're clearly miserable. And I'm tired of seeing the theatrics every time you walk in the same damn room.
“None of them were Harry Potter,” Malfoy said quietly. Harry gulped. He didn't want Malfoy thinking he was indebted to him. He
“That's how I've always shown it, though, isn't it? Since first year. Always had to beat him. Always had to pick a fight. Always had to watch him.” The silence was starting to overwhelm Harry.
“You were right. I shouldn't have encouraged us to be that risky.” Malfoy just shrugged. Harry waited, like he thought Malfoy was just letting his anger build up for a powerful release. But the blond just gestured for Harry to come closer, which he did. As soon as they were in reach of one another, Malfoy grabbed Harry by the robes and yanked him flush with his body. Malfoy pressed his thighs against Harry's waist on either side. Harry gulped. He thought maybe they'd have some great angry sex after arguing, if he was
“First, why don't you lay off other people's relationships that aren't even real? Not just mine, Neville's and Hannah's and whomever else you were talking about before them. It's none of your business. Second, why the hell would I or Ha- Potter care that you are watching us fight?
“Okay...” Malfoy and Ginny continued a staring contest, but eventually Ginny realized Malfoy didn't think he needed to offer more than that. She huffed. “I'm not trying to be rude, Malfoy, but why in the hell would you give it to
In the bedrooms, they were alone. Harry was grinning at him when he entered. “Sorry, I just... I saw that look on Seamus' face and I couldn't. I couldn't give him the satisfaction of knowing it was his meddling that got us together.” Draco chuckled. “If you want, we can tell everyone tomorrow. Now, whenever. But...” Draco quirked an eyebrow. “I thought it might be fun to mess with them for a while.”
When Draco entered 12 Grimmauld place, he didn't even pay attention as Kreacher took his robes and greeted him. He collapsed on the couch and asked Kreacher for a cup of tea.
“Oh.” Draco picked a weed from beside him and started picking the pieces off of it. It brought a memory of Hermione and Dean explaining a stupid muggle concept to them – taking a flower and picking the petals off saying, 'he loves me, he loves me not', and you had your answer when you plucked the last petal. How incredibly daft.
Draco felt Daphne's eyes on him the moment he walked into the Three Broomsticks. He tried to ignore the thinking face she was giving him and asked the waitress for a whiskey and some chips.
"I don't look at him all that much," he mumbled. When he glanced up, this time actually to see if Malfoy was paying attention, he found Malfoy studying him with an unhappy expression. He immediately snapped his eyes back down and kept his eyes glued on his plate. He refused to look in Malfoy's direction the rest of the meal.
“Harry.” Said boy jerked his head up at that voice, the one he felt like he hadn't heard in months. He'd spoken in class yesterday, but that wasn't the same voice that yelled at Harry, that insulted him, that cried out his name in Harry's daydreams-
And then there was Harry. Malfoy hadn't needed to win Harry over, even though Harry was the one Malfoy had hurt the most. Harry came straight out of the war defending Malfoy, pleading for his freedom at his trials and telling anyone who would listen how Malfoy had been forced and Malfoy had saved his life in the war. Harry had insisted that Malfoy had changed, and Harry had been the one to ask them to honor the truce that Malfoy asked for at the beginning of the term. Harry, who had once been convinced that Malfoy was opening the Chamber of Secrets, who had stalked Malfoy and accused him of plotting something evil all of sixth-year, who had recklessly used a spell could have killed Malfoy.
Ron awoke. It took him a few moments to adjust to the darkness. His eyes immediately narrowed in confusion. It was still dark, everyone was asleep. Why had he woken up? Ron was a blissfully deep sleeper, and he could count on one hand the number of times he'd woken up in the middle of the night for no reason.
The Prophet had certainly tried to make some romances – anytime Harry was seen alone in public with Ginny, the paper had a field day on the two getting back together. Never mind the fact that the two were obviously still good friends and the Burrow was Harry's second home.
“If my mother for some reason needs a book on the etymology of dragon names, I will be sure to ask for the book back.” When Hermione beamed up at him, Malfoy just smiled slightly back. Only when she was absorbed in her book did Malfoy turn, just for a moment, to Harry. They shared a small smile before Malfoy turned back to his seat.
Thinking intently of everything he knew his girlfriend liked, Ron startled when a blond sat down beside him. “Malfoy,” he mumbled. The blond nodded.
Later that night when he tried to do his homework, the only thing he could remember from the class was Malfoy's pretty script writing as he took studious notes, the way Malfoy's hair curled in one place near his neck, and Malfoy's smile when Pansy made comments throughout the class.
“Goodness,” Malfoy drawled. “We were wondering when someone would catch on. Never thought it would take six months.” The deafening silence that followed almost made Harry laugh. He could feel the eyes of the rest of Common Room, no one bothering to hide that they were eavesdropping anymore. Harry met Malfoy's eye again with a slight grin and found that Malfoy was clearly just as amused by the strange sputtering sound Ron was making.
“Harrison Ball.” Ron stared at the tickets for a while before saying anything else. “It's, uh... Hermione's not exactly the ball type, you know? Wouldn't someone like Parkinson appreciate this more?” Only after speaking did he realize that he'd made an effort to not be rude about it. What the hell was happening to him? Malfoy shrugged.
lucky, but he definitely didn't think Malfoy would be raring to go as soon as he walked in. “I- you aren't mad?” Malfoy shook his head. One of his hands lazily traced Harry's sides.
“Noooo, Uncle Draco!” Teddy whined. He tugged on Draco's robes as he pouted. He slowly transformed until a miniature Draco was staring up at him. Draco sighed. Teddy knew nothing won him over like turning into Draco's spitting image.
Daphne and Pansy started discussing whether it would be better for him to avoid seeing him in the future or go back this week and get some closure. Draco had seen Harry dozens of times over the years, had fully proved to himself that there was no chance Harry would ever return the feelings, and he still hadn't found closure. He had started to think he never would.
As Draco started up the process of making Puking Pastilles, which was nearly second nature for him at this point, he considered his career choice.
“It may not surprise you to know that I have had my fair share of shitty birthdays. I wouldn't wish that fate on my worst enemy.” To be fair, that was the truth. It was possible, however, that he might not have gone out of his way to fix his enemy's birthday.
Draco adjusted, trying to get comfortable in the stiff manor chair. Despite being absurdly expensive, most of the furniture in the manor was not all that comfortable.
The day flew by as Draco stocked the store up on the needed product. The easier items – like Puking Pastiles – were so simple and repetitive that Draco practically made them without thinking. With a few hours left in the day started off on creating George's new ideas. He began with the basics of a Draught of Peace, but tweaked a few of the ingredients. By the end of the day, Draco felt like he'd had some success with his experimentation. It would likely take weeks of testing, of course, but it was good progress for the first day.
