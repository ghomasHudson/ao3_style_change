Or as Draco liked to put it--
Gray eyes snapped back into focus. Draco hadn't realized just how tightly his teeth has clenched until he finally released the tension, the muted
A startled hiss escaped Draco as he turned sharply on his heel, stormy gray eyes locking onto an all-too-familiar pair of brilliant, emerald green hues.
. There was no way it could be empty at this time of day; it seemed as if everyone and their mothers in the Ministry of Magic waited for Draco to arrive in order to dump an inordinate amount of busywork into his lap.
Long ago, Draco would have considered the very idea of perusing muggle spaces to be stupidly
Despite his study of the chipping paint--the wall was a rather ghastly shade of off-yellow behind the shocking white pain, he noted--Draco could vaguely register the swing of Dr. Caudwell’s bob as she shook her head ever so slightly. She was speaking to him again, the blonde knew, but he didn’t care enough to listen this time around. There were only a few more agonizing minutes left for today’s session and the more Draco blocked her out, the less inclined he felt in participating. This was his fourth weekly visit but he had no intention of exposing the treachery of the war and just how deeply the pain of it ran. Not now, not soon, and hopefully--not ever.
His back pressed against the grimy brick wall behind him, leaving him with just a few slow seconds to inhale and exhale. Storm-colored eyes slipped shut for a moment--and for the first time since his appointment, Draco was able to just
Even more specifically, the War in which Draco had been an instrumental pawn for destruction.
PHEW this one! took some effort at first but I think i'm happy with the direction it went. hope you guys enjoyed and don't forget to leave a comment / kudos if you enjoyed!
Which, naturally, left him with only two options. The first was to act as an underling caretaker at a dragon century in northern Scotland. The second, an errandboy for the Ministry’s numerous employees. Draco had figured that picking up orders of pumpkin juice was more favorable than scraping dragon dung day in and day out.
Draco thought bitterly to himself--but there was no mistaking the fact that his cubby was decidedly
With a muffled grumble of resignation, Draco ducked his way past a throng of school-aged muggle girls giggling their way along the sidewalk. He barely registered the sound of their shrill, high-pitched voices as the darkness of the narrow alleyway swallowed him whole. He had found the small nook on his way to his second visit only two weeks prior--and Draco found himself taking a liking to the shaded spot quickly enough.
; his kind was not meant to fraternize with those
Strange. Draco took a step back, puzzled expression never once faltering as he silently stared at his cubby. The sound of owls’ fluttering, feathery wings faded into the background as the blonde scratched the back of his head in thought. Did he not have any assignments that day? Could he just… leave? Go home? If that was the case, perhaps he could owl Pansy and ask her out for a cup of tea. It had been far too long since he was able to see his dear fr--
Vulnerability was weakness--a lesson he had been taught far before the darkness of the war had seized his life and left it in shambles.
i know the boys didn't interact at all in this chapter but... we are a slowburn so strap up! next time around, we will hopefully get some good good drarry content (eye emojis.)
, I happen to work here.” Draco managed to grind out through gritted teeth, shoulders squared and jaw clenched in a desperate attempt at masking the sudden fright the other had given him. “I’m sure it might be too much for your
, even.
Therapy was far from the only stipulation to Draco’s lightened sentence following the war. As a means of paying reparations for the damage he had cost the majority of the wizarding world, he was sanctioned for community service.
The woman seated neatly before him had her dark gaze trained on the notepad settled in her lap, a careful hand taking notes to fill the stretch of silence between them. Draco almost wanted to scoff.
Draco found himself intensely fascinated by a piece of chipped paint on the wall just behind Dr. Caudwell’s head, lips pressed together into a thin line.
He now realized that this had been mistake number two.
The noisy racket of muggle London assaulted all of Draco’s senses from the moment he swung the door open and stepped foot onto asphalt and into the sticky summer air. It was enough to force him to grit his teeth and hunch his slender shoulders in disgust. He had learned early on to avoid touching shoulders with the muggles walking briskly down the pavement--lest he bump into them and force himself into more social interaction than necessary.
Draco could hear his heart pounding in his ears. It was so loud he didn’t hear the boy cast a stinging hex. It burned through his body.
“Damn, Draco. That was…wow.” His eyes popped open. “I haven’t even touched you. I swear I’m not normally so selfish.”
“Honestly, Harry, this is a dessert wine. It’s meant to be paired with--”
“For what?”
“That’s so cool! Draco, did you help Uncle Harry, too?”
“Yeah. It was fine. I’m glad I spend most of the time in the back, but it still smells like owl shite and dead rodents.”
“I expect all of you to treat each other with the utmost respect. If the Wizengamot, the Minister, the Headmistress, and the rest of the staff feel that Draco is welcome here, then he is. Is that understood?”
“Malfoy.” Harry held up his hand. “What is your project?”
“You can have my flat,” Remus offered. “Teddy and I are going to my office to grade papers.”
“My pleasure.” But Harry knew it was about to be his pleasure instead. Draco unzipped Harry’s jeans and tugged them down to below his buttocks. Harry’s thick erection pressed against his boxers, vying against the fabric for its freedom. Draco grabbed Harry’s cock through the thin cotton, and Harry gasped. “Fuck, you are thick. I can’t wait to take your huge cock up my arse. But first...”
They walked in silence for a few steps.
“Shit.”
“You made some shite mistakes, and you had some shite circumstances. I did, too.”
“Draco?”
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked him.
Harry shook his head. “If it’s stuck under something, I don’t want it to break. That’s some expensive stuff that Kingsley gave me.” He stretched. “And I’m just too comfortable to get up. You’re still standing.”
“It’s all right, Draco. It’s the past; it’s not important.”
“Second, I think we have touched briefly on anger being a secondary emotion. Can you identify your primary emotion?”
Draco shuddered. “No, thank you. I’ve met enough psychopaths for one lifetime, thanks.”
Harry couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in the history of Wizarding Britain, there would be people to advocate for children like him. “You did it, Draco. I came in for the easy part.”
“Good.”
“Scared, Potter?”
Harry was waiting for him outside the classroom. He was handsome with his wild hair and muscular shoulders leaning against the stone wall. “You all right?”
Draco climbed on top of Harry, bracing his hands on either side of Harry’s head. His cock was already hard against Harry’s stomach. He brought his lips to Harry, and he kissed him, gently at first, teasing. He licked his tongue over Harry’s bottom lip, and Harry opened his mouth, inviting him in for more. The kiss grew more heated, and Harry pushed Draco’s hips down so their cocks could touch. Draco nibbled Harry’s earlobe, eliciting a most undignified sound from Harry’s mouth.
“I want you to sit on my lap facing me. You’ll have more control over how fast or slow I go in.” And Draco really wanted Harry pressed against him. He wanted to be able to stare into his eyes and kiss him as much as he wanted.
Harry grinned. “Great!” He filled Ron in on their progress. The cause was something Ron and Hermione fully supported, and they had promised to help promote it to the public. Harry and Hermione hated using their fame for anything but good, and with the entire Golden Trio behind it, it shouldn’t be hard to convince the public to support the new law.
“Probably those hoodlums,” Draco said. “They were out late when I was delivering on Sunday night.”
McGonagall’s eyes were warm with concern. “Indeed. Your father has died.”
“Ron may never like Malfoy. But he’ll be fine.” She would ensure it. “I’m happy for you, Harry. And Ron will be, too. Now, I really must get back to work.”
Luna giggled. “I believe they said, ‘Oh! Oh! Right there! Fuck yes!’”
“Mr. Malfoy,” Anna said. Draco jumped a little at the unexpected sound. “You have not only met the expectations for your probation but exceeded them. Your sentence is considered served at the close of the Hogwarts graduation ceremony.”
That was how their meal continued. Long pauses between tentative conversation. Harry watched as Draco took the last bite of biryani. He couldn’t take his eyes off Draco’s mouth.
Fuck. He was definitely into blokes.
Draco took the same seat at the eighth year table that he had last night, on the corner closest to the staff table. Granger was seated across from him, her nose already in a book. Potter went to sit on her other side, but she gave him a look that Draco couldn’t interpret. He moved to sit next to Draco. Ah, she must have been telling him to save the seat for the Weasel. Of course.
The Dursleys stood in their living room to watch as Daisy Apparated for her first time. “Take my hand, Daisy. It feels very funny, but you’re safe with me.” Daisy nodded bravely and grabbed Harry’s hand.
Harry nodded. “Yes, well. This specifically.” He shifted onto his stomach and reached behind him to place the bow on his arse. Then he pushed himself up on his hands and knees and looked at Draco expectantly.
“It was fun, Draco. But no. And I’d prefer it if you kept that between the Slytherins. Reputation and all that.”
“Just see it?”
“I’m fine!” It came out strangled.
Malfoy raised his wine glass to his lips. “Touche.” Then he launched into an explanation of reallocation of funds and fiscal years and some other boring terms that Harry tried really hard to pay attention to; instead, he found himself staring at Malfoy’s lips again.
And Malfoy did. He ran his nails over Harry’s back as he fucked him harder, faster. Harry’s moans were punctured with sobs of satisfaction. “You’re so fucking tight, Potter.”
Harry’s eyes flew open. Apparently, he could not hear a door open and a man make his way into the living room. Maybe he was more out of practice than he thought. He shook himself. “Meditating.”
Interesting. Draco inched closer to Harry. “You used to room with him. Tell me. How big is the real sword of Godric Gryffindor?”
Hermione and Harry looked at each other and nodded. Ron rolled his eyes. Harry sat down opposite the blond pariah, and Hermione sat next to him. Ron sat next to Harry.
“How?”
Back in the room, Harry was pacing. He forced himself to breathe in the rhythm that Artemis had taught them. When he finally caught his breath, he sat down on his bed and drew the curtains. He needed to experiment. He stuck a hand out of the bed curtains and grabbed his wand and a copy of
Harry shook his head. “I just try not to think about it. Live in the present and all that.”
“Oh, my darling.” Andromeda folded him into an embrace. Draco hadn’t been held like that since he said goodbye to his mother nearly six months before. He wrapped his arms around her. She even smelled like his mother. They wore the same perfume. He couldn’t stop his tears. “You have nothing to apologize for. I am so sorry she hurt you so very badly.”
“Everything. Our past. And...and we cried. And then we laughed. And then I kissed him.” Hermione and Ron exchanged a glance. Hermione rolled her eyes, and Ron grinned. “Oh my god, guys. Did you bet on my love life again?”
They said their farewells, and Draco, Harry, and Daisy left the stadium. “Have a very happy birthday, Daisy,” Draco told the little girl. She hugged him goodbye.
Harry was certain Draco wouldn’t come back. He chastised his stupidity for the entire three minutes that Draco was gone. But when he heard a knock on the door, his heart leapt.
“Sorry.” Harry waited until Draco told him to continue. “It’s so tight,” he said in awe.
“Because you’re emotionally immature and refuse to talk about things before they become a big deal,” Hermione replied matter-of-factly.
“It was terrible, Harry. A terrible place. Even without Dementors.”
“I want to. I’m just nervous I’ll hurt you.”
“Yeah. Let’s move in together.” Harry grinned, and Draco returned his smile. Harry loved when Draco smiled so big that his grey eyes squinted. Harry patted Draco’s stomach. “Come on, let’s clean up and get dressed, roomie.”
Harry recalled what Draco had said as he drifted off to sleep last night. “Can you forgive him, Hermione?”
Draco looked at the floor. “Yes. Sorry to trouble you. I, uh, had a bit of an episode because I thought I saw my aunt. But this is my other aunt. Not the evil one. So. I’m fine now. Thanks to Harry.”
Harry took a deep breath. “I’m fine, Draco. I swear.”
The common room burst into laughter. Neville rolled his eyes.
“Oh yeah? You need it?”
Draco nodded. Blaise disappeared into his bedroom. Draco stood, staring at his feet. There was only one bed left, and Harry had to be the one to make peace.
“Not since lunch, sorry.”
Draco’s hand unfastened the button of Harry’s trousers. Harry’s breath hitched. It was Draco’s turn to be jolted from the mood.
“So, you’re bisexual?”
Harry still had no plan for after school. With Draco’s and Bill Weasley’s guidance, he made some smart investments with a portion of his fortune. And he still studied for his NEWTs in case he ever decided to go to the Auror Academy—and because Hermione and Draco insisted he study, but he no longer felt like everything hinged on these tests.
Draco reached his hand to Harry’s lap, finding it less hard than it had been just moments before. “Well, let’s see if we can’t get you back in the mood.”
“Yeah.”
They sat at Harry’s kitchen table. Harry summoned plates from the drying rack and dipped out some food for himself and Draco. “Want a beer?”
Harry moved his tongue deftly. He loved the way Draco just melted when he ate him out. He reached around to grab his lover’s cock and began to stroke in time to his licks. He blew gently against Draco’s wet, swollen entrance. Draco whimpered. It wasn’t long before Draco was crying out incoherent strings of exclamations and obscenities. Harry darted his tongue in and out and sped up the strokes of his hands. Draco tensed, and Harry knew he was on the bring of an explosive orgasm. But he stopped himself. “Get inside me and fuck me, Potter.”
“Sorry?”
She nodded again. “Well, hurry along to the Great Hall. The other students will be arriving soon.” She turned to walk away then paused. “Oh, and Draco. Welcome home.”
Harry nodded. “I can’t guarantee how friendly Ginny will be. She’s had a rough time this year. We finally got a chance to talk today. I think she’ll be okay, but…”
Harry reached down between them and grabbed Draco’s already-hard cock, making Draco gasp. “I want to go down on you,” Harry said.
Harry waited a few minutes to avoid running into Malfoy in the corridor then headed down to Hermione’s office in the Magical Creatures department. “Hermione, you won’t believe what just happened,” he said as he pushed open her office door and collapsed in a chair opposite her desk. “I’m getting a drink with Draco fucking Malfoy tonight.”
Harry gave Hermione a small smile. “I know we’re all having a tough time. I shouldn’t have snapped at you, though.”
“But I’m the only blood-related nephew, therefore, I have to be your favorite. How are you, Aunt Andromeda? Here to see Teddy?”
“Yes.” Harry sounded desperate.
A map of Hogwarts appeared, full of tiny dots with people’s names. Every person at Hogwarts was on the map. Draco let out a low whistle. “This explains so much.”
“I love you, Harry.” Draco felt oddly emotional. “I love you so much. Thank you for, well, I could spend the rest of my life thanking you for taking a chance on me.”
“I see.” Harry nodded and smiled. “Thank you for your time.”
“Damn,” Harry said aloud when he realized he’d been staring.
“Fuck, you’re hot,” Draco said. He ran his hands over Harry’s muscular chest, running his fingers through the little patch of hair on his chest and the one that ran down into his trousers. Harry ground his hips against Draco’s and leaned down to kiss him again. He nibbled Draco’s lips, making him buck his hips up into Harry.
“Yes, well, you are about to find that I have very different anatomy than the Weasellette, so I need to know what you’re willing to do.”
“Da-da!” Teddy cried and reached out his arms. Remus walked up and took Teddy from Andromeda. When he saw Narcissa, his mouth dropped. Draco watched as his mother’s eyes widened. How odd, he thought.
“No, I don’t.” Harry shook his head. “I sat in every day of your trial, you know. I saw the Veritaserum. I saw the memories you shared. Your father is a monster.”
“I wonder what happened to him,” Ron slurred.
Harry’s already hard cock twitched at the demand. He glanced at the clock; they still had time. He lubed himself up with Draco’s spell then pressed the thick head of his hardness against Draco’s hole. With one, long swift movement, he entered him. Draco grunted, and Harry realized he had not stretched his lover at all in the heat of the moment. “All right, love?”
“Oh.”
If Harry were completely honest with himself, it wasn’t just the quality of the food that made him place an order at Curry Cauldron again. But Harry was never completely honest with himself. After thirty-five minutes, he paced his apartment, eager for his delivery.
The article was widely well-received. Draco and the Golden Trio gave interviews to the Quibbler, Witch Weekly, and other publications. Letters of support flooded in to the editors and to the members of the Wizengamot. There were a few people, of course, who didn’t think the government should stick their nose into people’s personal lives like that. Harry suspected Draco mentally added those names to a list of individuals to watch once the law passed.
“Let’s move in together.”
He slathered his fingers in lube while he swirled his tongue around the head of Harry’s cock. Then he breached Harry with two wet fingers. Harry gasped in pleasure. Draco used his other hand to reach up and play with Harry’s hard nipples. He moved his head up and down over Harry’s shaft while using his left hand to stretch him.
“I’m so sorry, Draco. I’m so, so sorry.”
Draco leaned down again to kiss Harry, gently this time. He could feel Harry’s heart beating wildly, and he was determined to relax him. He took his time with this kiss, running his fingertips softly along Harry’s arms and jaw.
“Too many clothes,” Harry murmured in Draco’s ear and nibbled his earlobe. Draco moaned.
“Really? Good for them.”
He tapped his wand on the appropriate brick, and Daisy gasped loudly as the archway to Diagon Alley sprung to life. She gripped his hand tightly, unsure at the new experience before her, and Harry guided her onto the bustling street.
Malfoy sighed and calculated his total. “I only work here on weekend days. Ten Galleons, two sickles, and twenty knuts.”
as an apprentice.” Draco scratched his left arm unconsciously.
“Excuse me, I’m a bit overwhelmed. Could you help me find the hangover potions and the Sleekeazy?”
Draco took the toothbrush out of his mouth, and toothpaste dribbled down his chin. Harry had the urge to lick it off. “I need to get the file from McGonagall. I can’t find it.”
Draco blinked. “Fuck off, Harry.”
“Of course. I didn’t think I’d be welcome without it.”
Harry felt larger than life when he left the MInistry. He blinked in the bright sunshine. He was unemployed. Well, for now. But he was freer than he had ever felt, and he only had Draco to thank for it. He turned down an abandoned alleyway to Apparate back to Draco’s flat.
“Okay. Are you okay?”
“Fred and George Weasley. But my dad made it.”
Harry nodded.
“Had to pick that color, huh?”
Harry shifted on his feet. He was glad Draco felt that way, but an ever-growing part of him wanted so much more. “Me, too.”
“Draco, you need to relax.” Draco opened his mouth to protest, but Harry held up his hand. “Go finish brushing your teeth and put on some fucking clothes.” So I don’t pop a boner right here. “Then we’ll go over everything before we leave. Do you have a Calming Draught?”
Draco felt confident in his NEWTS, but he would get the scores back at the beginning of August. He had been granted permission to remain unemployed until he received his scores. Harry was relaxed in having no plans. He and Draco planned to travel some in July. Harry had never been on vacation before.
“Fuck, Harry. Stop teasing me.”
Harry smiled. Draco couldn’t resist any longer. He wrapped his hand around Harry’s shaft.
Draco put one strong arm around Harry’s buttocks to help move him, urging him to go a little faster. He reached the other hand between them to jerk Harry off. He wasn’t going to last long, not with Harry’s arse tailor-made for his cock, so he wanted every moment to be amazing for Harry.
“Move in with me,” Harry said.
“Harry, I’ve really come to consider you a good friend.”
Draco sighed. “Okay. But you’re not going to just replace me when another devilishly handsome delivery man shows up, right?”
She smiled. “That’s all right, my sweetest. Six more months will fly by. You’ll see.”
Ron’s jaw was slack as he stared at Draco. Harry smiled into his wine glass, determined not to ruin the moment. Ron cleared his throat. “I, uh, I forgive you. And I’m sorry for anything I ever said to you that was uncalled for.”
“I see,” Harry said. “Can we ask you a few questions?”
Malfoy stared at him. “Really?”
“You, too.”
“Fuck me,” Harry said under his breath. “This is bullshit. We’re just supposed to talk about our feelings like a bunch of bloody girls. I’m fine.”
“Only if there is an arrest that needs to be made or a situation of imminent danger. The Magical Law Enforcement Patrol is full of buffoons. I’d rather not set this up for failure from the beginning.”
“Sounds great! You know the Minister is going to the Weasleys for Christmas? Good networking opportunity. And that Arthur Weasley is a riot. Floo me tomorrow, and let me know what time.”
Harry let out a breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding. He took Draco’s hand and led him back to the dorm. “Are you sure you’re okay?”
“Yeah. I haven’t been to a game all season. It will be nice.”
He pulled Harry against him into a passionate kiss and used one hand to remove the bow. Then he smacked Harry on his firm arse, making Harry moan into his mouth. They took their time, kissing and grinding against each other.
“Oi! I’m right here!”
“No!”
Hermione shook her head. “I can’t wait for her to deliver that baby so they can be a happy couple again.”
Draco was done for. He sobbed as he ate the cupcake. Harry let him. When he finally caught his breath, Draco told him everything that had happened.
“Your eyes were open,” Ron said. “I spent months with you in a tent, and I’ve never seen you sleep with your eyes open.” He laughed a little. That was Ron these days, casually mentioning things no one wanted to think about and laughing about them.
“Ah.” He shook his head and threw his shower caddy and dirty clothes on the floor next to his bed. Harry, who had the bed closest to the door, put his own shower belongings on the shelf where he kept them and folded his pajamas to place at the end of his bed. Malfoy was so uptight, he had figured him for a neat freak. Apparently, he was more like Ron.
“Anna is right, Hamish,” the Minister said in his deep voice. “That’s enough.”
“Is that why you were all shaky and pale? You should go see Madam Pomfrey.”
In response, the hand fondling Harry’s balls worked its way further back toward Harry’s throbbing entrance. The soft tip of a finger circled the hole, and Harry bucked further into Draco’s mouth. He felt Draco smile around his cock. Draco may be the one on his knees, but he was also absolutely the one in control. Slowly, Draco inched a finger inside of Harry. Harry cried out at the sensation. It burned slightly, but he relished it. It only took a few more deep sucks before Harry felt his balls tighten. With a loud grunt, he spilled into Draco’s mouth.
Ever a Gryffindor, Harry grabbed Draco’s collar and pulled him into a kiss. His lips crashed onto Draco’s, soft and inviting. It didn’t take more than half a second before Draco returned the kiss fervently. He parted his lip, letting Harry’s tongue slide inside. Harry pulled Draco onto his lap, never breaking contact with the blond man’s soft, sensual lips. He sucked and nibbled and felt Draco whimper into his mouth.
“Indeed.” Draco stopped at a shelf full of Sleekeazy products. If only his grandfather hadn’t sold the company, Harry could have an unlimited supply of the stuff. Harry grabbed the purple bottle.
Standing before him was a tall, blond—and rather fit, he had to admit—man he hadn’t seen in years. Draco Malfoy was wearing acid wash blue jeans and a green t-shirt that read “Curry Cauldron.” A scarlet blush crept up his cheeks.
“What are you doing?” Draco said with his teeth clenched.
“I will.” The words were out of Draco’s mouth before he knew what he was doing. He shot a panicked look at Harry. Harry smiled at him.
“And it was you showing up and forcing me to face my past that gave me the courage to finally, finally kiss you. I want you, Draco. I have for months.”
Malfoy’s usual confidence returned. “Roommates, Potter. Not friends.”
“Oral?”
“It’s not like they taught government at Hogwarts.”
He probably shouldn’t have asked to walk to breakfast with Harry. But when Harry was about to leave, that nauseous feeling returned. The thought of walking through the halls of Hogwarts with no protection was terrifying. No one would mess with him if he was with the bloody Savior, right?
Harry smiled. “Good. I want you to finish inside me.”
“That’s all right, Harry. What about rimming?”
“Of course, she will.” Harry stood. “And since she’s a mother, it will be extra powerful.” He gathered his belongings to go home when he remembered the Quidditch tickets. “Hey, Draco?”
“Okay.” Malfoy’s voice was small like it had been last night when Blaise had asked to room with the Hufflepuffs. Harry blinked and looked at him. Malfoy seemed to have shrunk. His shoulders dropped, and he stared at the floor. “Okay.”
“Oi! Don’t talk to her like that,” Ron said.
Harry was a quick learner. Soon, he was fucking Draco with one hand and stroking him with the other. Draco cried out as he spilled himself over Harry’s hand. Harry ran his tongue over the sensitive head of Draco’s cock.
Vernon had died prematurely of a heart attack just three years before, and Dudley had been on a weight loss journey to avoid a similar fate. (“I’m down three stone,” he bragged.) Petunia still lived on Privet Drive and had joined various ladies’ clubs after Vernon’s death. Dudley worked as a foreman at a factory, and his wife worked as a bank teller.
“Yes, sir. Number 12 Grimmauld Place, London.”
“Yeah?” Harry couldn’t help the smile that crept onto his face.
“What did they say?”
“Um, yes.” Harry turned off the water and reached for a paper towel. Now was his chance to ask about Malfoy’s sudden reappearance. “I’ve seen you around the Ministry a lot lately.”
He Apparated into the area pictured in the file—a toilet in a shopping mall that the Muggle Liaison Office had cleared. He walked out of the loo to find Susan Bones waiting for him. “Hey, Susan,” he grinned. He had always liked her, at school and at work. She was friendly and good at her job.
Draco turned on his side to face Harry. He ran his fingertips over Harry’s chest. “I’m your bloody swot.”
“Ah. That’s good. I’ve seen Ron’s, thanks to his nudist habit. What about Dean Thomas?”
Back at Hogwarts, Harry and Draco headed to their dorm room laden with gifts. Harry collapsed on the bed with an exaggerated sigh.
Draco nuzzled his chin. “But I am touching you,” he teased.
Then, Dudley did the most unexpected thing Harry could have ever imagined. In fact, Harry would never have imagined it. Dudley stepped forward and wrapped Harry in an embrace. “It’s so good to see you.”
Harry had lost track of how much he had drunk since they arrived, and he certainly didn’t know what time it was. He nearly reached for his wand to cast a tempus charm, but he was sober enough to check his mobile instead. They had been at the pub for over three hours.
Harry nodded. “And how was it?”
“Draco, shove it. All right, listen up. Draco and I have talked through our past. And we’re all going to do the same thing. Draco’s in my life now, just like you two. So, Hermione, cut the Jean Granger act. Ron, stop being a cunt. Draco, try not to be such a posh arse.”
“Think about that obsession, though. Especially in sixth year.”
By the next Friday, Harry had all but forgotten about his encounter with Malfoy. Pushing papers for ten hours a day at the Ministry had that effect on someone. It was mind-numbing, and there was always more to do. He pulled extra hours every night that week.
Back at Hogwarts, Draco assured Steve he was fine. Steve was skeptical, but Draco only wanted to talk to one person. And until Harry got home, Draco wanted to lay down and cry.
“I’ll be fine, Steve,” Draco said. “Thank you. For everything.”
“You’re welcome to leave. The door is right there. I’m sorry this is the first place that popped into my head when I saved your ass from getting hit by a fucking car!”
Malfoy eyed him. “Just because you testified at my trial doesn’t mean you have to be my friend. I still think you’re a pompous arse.”
Harry finished up and went to wash his hands. When Malfoy finished a moment later, he had to stand right next to Harry, as there were only two sinks. “Lovely weather we’re having, don’t you think?” Draco still had that polished, aristocratic lilt to his voice. Even after ten years, it still felt familiar to Harry, though not at all evil.
Harry sighed and buried his head in his hands. “Why do discussions about my love life always end up with a huge audience?”
The Monday of the last week before Christmas break, Draco was quite sure he had awoken in an alternate universe. The owl post arrived dropping letters off all over the Great Hall. Remus handed Draco a letter that had been screened. It was from Steve.
And Harry was, well, Harry.
When he reentered the bedroom, he felt shy and uncomfortable. He didn’t know what to say, and Draco just stared at him. And he continued to stare for a really long time. Harry shifted his weight from foot to foot, waiting for Draco to say something, anything. Finally, he cleared his throat. “Right. Well, you’re quite a bit taller than me.”
Life settled into a happy and hectic pace for the eighth years. By March, Artemis had decided to decrease group therapy to once a week and started giving them extra coping and life skills on Fridays. Draco had two potions masters willing to work with him, depending on his NEWT scores. He was still worried about his hearing and life after Hogwarts. He could live with Andromeda, but he couldn’t help feeling like it was too much for her to offer. He hoped the Ministry would return Malfoy Manor soon so he could sell it and make some money.
Malfoy returned with a tin of salve and a mirror that he handed to Harry. Harry murmured a quick thanks and sat on the leather sofa. Malfoy sat opposite him on a matching armchair, watching Harry apply the salve to his bruised eye.
“That’s quite enough Hufflepuff for one night, don’t you think?” Harry asked.
“What about you, Harry? Are you married? What have you done since I last saw you?”
“Okay?” Draco asked. He wanted a bit more confirmation than that.
“You more than like him.”
“There, now, Draco. Come, we don’t have much time, and I want to look at you.”
“Like the Wizengamot.”
“Just…a passing thought.” He stood. “Another round?”
Draco stroked Harry’s face with one hand. “Shh. I forgive you. I do.”
“Thanks.” She wasn’t quite ready to warm up to Malfoy, but at least she wasn’t rude. She turned her attention to Harry. “I’ll see you at lunch tomorrow?”
“All right. Weasley, I mean Ron. I was a right prick to you from the moment we met. I was only spouting off shite I’d heard my father say, and he was a right bastard. I’m sorry for all the things I said to you, and I’m sorrier I ever believed any of it. You’re a good man; anyone who reads the papers can tell that.”
“I have accepted a position with a Potions Master in Diagon Alley, depending on my NEWT scores.”
When his sobs quieted, Artemis asked him if he would like to share. Neville wiped his face and nodded.
“Thank you.”
“Mister Malfoy?” McGonagall said in her rolling Scottish accent. “Please come with me.”
from Draco.
“I noticed.” He held out the bag. “Chicken saag, lamb biryani, and garlic naan.”
Harry shifted his torso and leaned forward to capture Draco’s mouth in his. Draco moaned into his mouth, and Harry’s cock sprung to full attention. He pulled Draco onto his lap and twirled his fingers in his silky, blond hair. Draco rutted against him, gasping and sighing.
Harry thought for a moment. The dream was starting to slip away. He’d never thought to just confront it. “It’s been ten years. I shouldn’t...”
It took fifteen minutes before he stepped in the Ministry Floo and out in his living room.
Draco sat on the grass and spread the map out in front of him. “This is wild. Hey, look at this.” He pointed to two dots that were very close to each other. Too close to each other. Two sixth-year Gryffindors were going at it in a broom closet.
“No!” Harry remembered how Draco felt about yelling and counted to five. “No. Thank you. I’m not suicidal.”
Harry bent further over Draco’s back to deepen his thrusts. He reached his arms around Draco’s waist and began to furiously stroke Draco’s weeping cock. Draco came with a shout and a whimper. As he tightened around Harry’s cock, Harry threw his head back and roared with his release.
“I can tell.”
“She’s as well as can be expected. I received a letter from her this morning. She’s been reading some Muggle romance author so must of the letter was about books.”
Draco blinked. “Andromeda?”
“Yeah, it was great. But, I don’t know if I’m ready for, you know, all of it yet.” He looked embarrassed. Draco planted a kiss on his lips.
“Impressive. Where’d you get it?”
Harry nodded, daring to look up into his boyfriend’s piercing grey eyes. “I do.”
Malfoy stared after Hermione, his jaw dropped. Harry just rolled his eyes. “Better get used to it, Malfoy. These two go at it like Kneazles in heat.”
“Yes. Uh. Fuck me hard.”
“Funny. I still think the same thing about you. I’m not trying to be your friend. I’m trying to be a cordial roommate because I just want one goddamned year of my life to go smoothly! Voldemort is dead. I never have to see my aunt and uncle again. Snape isn’t here to torment me in Potions. Just one fucking year of some bloody peace!”
“Good food.”
“Is it about your crush on Draco?”
“And that’s why your hair can’t be tamed. You need the orange bottle. For extra thick hair.”
“Of course, I like him. I wouldn’t do this if I didn’t.”
Harry wrinkled his nose. “How pleasant.”
It wasn’t hot at all, but Dennis dropped it. They went back to the office to write up their report. When Harry went home that night, he had a nice, long wank thinking about Draco. He couldn’t wait for Friday.
“He’s my godson!” Harry said. Draco looked at him, surprised to see him beaming with pride. This morning had already been the oddest morning of his life, and it wasn’t even nine o’clock.
After a quick scourgify, the two men cuddled against each other on the bed. Cuddling had never been one of Harry’s favorite activities, but he remembered Seamus’s words years ago. “When you find the right person, you’ll enjoy it.” Seamus was right. Harry couldn’t get enough of Draco’s body, not just in a sexual way. He just wanted to be constantly touching him.
“Really? It ruins things?” Harry grinned.
They finished in the bathroom at the same time and walked in heavy silence down the hallway to their dorm. When Harry opened the door, he saw Hermione buttoning her top and Ron splayed out on his bed, thankfully under the covers.
“I cried. Hermione cried. Ron clapped me on the back and said I should marry his brother, Charlie.” Harry smiled at that. Draco felt a twinge of jealousy, and he shoved it down.
They drank in silence for a few minutes, neither sure what to say next. “How’s your mother?” Harry finally asked.
His words seemed to snatch Draco out of his pleasure, and the taller man quickly pulled away. He clambered off of Harry. “Sorry. We can’t. I just...I have to go.”
Draco Malfoy sat in a corner at a small table. He waved Harry over, and Harry suddenly feared what would happen if the press saw him in public with Draco. He hadn’t even considered that earlier, because he would have insisted on a Muggle pub instead. But Harry didn’t see any of the reporters he recognized. He took a deep breath and walked over to have a drink with Malfoy.
“Steve?”
Harry passed Malfoy the pad thai and shoveled more green curry on his plate. “It could go under MLEP,” he suggested. “They’ll be enforcing the laws the most, right?”
“But?”
“Please refrain from giving any normally forbidden substances to the younger students.” Remus looked directly at Justin Finch-Fletchley, who was known for both his high-quality weed and his ability to smuggle in booze. “And as this is not a typical house and you are all adults, I expect you to treat each other with respect.”
Harry stepped around Draco and looked at the stack of papers on the table. He thumbed through them quickly and found the report McGonagall had given them about her experiences with abused children. “You mean this one?”
Draco walked with Harry to the Great Hall. The rambling arse seemed to have finally run out of things to say. Perhaps he shouldn’t have agreed to a truce so quickly. But Harry was yelling, and Draco hated being yelled at more than he hated Potter.  Except he wasn’t so sure he hated Potter anymore. He just didn’t have room to hate anyone besides his father and Voldemort and his aunt Bellatrix, and the latter two were dead.
Harry had already closed his eyes at Draco’s touch. Draco peppered kisses and nibbles down Harry’s chest, teasing his nipples with teeth and tongue. Harry’s back arched, and Draco took note every time he touched a new spot that made Harry writhe.
Draco trailed his tongue and hands down from Harry’s neck, over his abs, and onto the trail of dark hair below his navel. “Merlin, you’re fit,” Draco murmured as he began to fiddle with the button of Harry’s jean. “Want to show me what you’re hiding in here?”
“True. Your turn. Why do you look like you just got dumped by your date at the Yule Ball?”
“I mean, I don’t think Ron is going to attack you or anything.”
Harry gaped like a fish, unsure what to say. He didn’t mean to propose to Draco, but that’s what it sounded like. And he
Draco nodded. “Rent in London is expensive.”
“Fine. Happy. They have two kids, you know.”
Draco arched his brow. “A lovely woman?”
“Planning ahead is not my forte. You know that. Besides, I just realized I like blokes a month ago. I only figured out I had a crush on Draco two weeks ago.”
“What are you doing? We have to get away. We need to run.”
“Please, I’m so ready.”
But the third member of the Wizengamot seemed determined to see Draco hanged. And Draco was unsure if all four had to be in agreement about Draco’s sentence. His stomach roiled as the man harangued Draco about his past crimes.
Toasts were made and glasses clinked. Even Kingsley showed up and clapped Harry and Draco on the back. Harry watched McGonagall have a bit too much to drink, her Scottish accent becoming more and more incomprehensible. Molly’s face had turned as red as her hair, and she kept exclaiming, “The children! Think of all the children!” Even Narcissa had relaxed, and she and Andromeda laughed in private conversation.
“Merry Christmas, Draco.”
“Maybe. Maybe not.” Draco laughed out loud. “But we ended up in the same dorm anyway.”
“Have you talked about your past with him?”
“She’s well. She has enjoyed life as a divorcee. She’s finally getting the happiness she deserves.”
For a moment, Malfoy looked like he wanted to respond with some sarcastic remark. But to his credit, he didn’t. He sat up a little straighter and took one last drink of his beer. “I mentioned I was working on a project. I wanted to talk to you about your childhood.”
“Oh, I took over the Malfoy investments. Well, the ones that stuck around after the...after everything. I’ve gathered up some new ones, as well. Lots of meetings with stuffy businessmen, you know. Nothing exciting.”
He looked at the file that had appeared on his desk. It was just clean-up from accidental, underage magic. Muggle Liaison was already there and had rounded up all the witnesses; they just needed an Auror to Obliviate their memories. He looked at the address. Surrey.
Harry had an assignment outside the office for the first time in a month on Tuesday. There had been curse marks on several buildings in Diagon Alley. He and Dennis were to question the owners of the shops to see if they’d noticed anything suspicious.
“Great. It was delicious.” He was about to tell them all about Malfoy, but he remembered his former nemesis’ embarrassment. “Speedy service, too.”
She changed the subject to things she had seen already, asking tons of questions, and Harry answered them patiently. He was used to this with Rose. In fact, Hermione had pointed out, Daisy and Rose should go to Hogwarts at the same time. He hoped the two little girls would become friends.
She nodded and yawned. “Well, we’re about a half-hour away, if you want to get changed.” She stood and rummaged through her bag for her robes then froze, staring out the window at the passing countryside. Ron reached for her hand and squeezed it. She turned to look at her boyfriend, and he grinned at her. “Right. Well, I think I’ll just pop off to the loo before it gets crowded.”
Harry laughed. “Sort of, I guess.”
“Um. I don’t know. Whatever.” But his brow furrowed. He did know, and he was going to make Draco pry it out of him.
The meal was mostly silent. There were no exciting summer holidays to discuss. Save for the neutral Slytherins, the last time everyone had seen each other was the Battle. Some of them had crossed paths at the various funerals over the summer, but all of those ran together in Harry’s mind. They had all lost friends and family members. Harry wondered if returning had really been a good idea. Kingsley had offered to let Harry into the Auror Academy without his NEWTS, but at the time, Harry wasn’t so sure he wanted to ever fight again.
“Oh, right. I have to pick up Daisy. Want to meet around one at the stadium?”
Draco smirked. “And here I thought you didn’t have a romantic bone in your body. Yes, I’d like that.”
“Could you be any hotter?” Draco whimpered. “Give me an hour, I’ll be ready for round two.”
“Oh, that’s right. Well, let’s catch up soon. I’ll owl you. Happy birthday, Daisy!”
“I’m glad you came,” Harry said.
“I don’t like seeing my friends upset.”
“You’re brave, too, Draco. I hope you know that. Brave for growing up with your father, for betraying Voldemort, for coming back to Hogwarts. Brave for making yourself vulnerable, for going to Azkaban to visit your mother. And you’re brave for taking a chance on me. Because Merlin knows, I’m a mess.”
Harry flushed a deep scarlet. “I don’t care about dicks, Draco.”
Harry summoned two beers from the refrigerator. There was a long pause.
“Honestly, Potter. Do you ever cook?”
“With all due respect,” the youngest representative interrupted, “Mr. Malfoy has already been put on trial and sentenced. We are here to determine if he has met the conditions of his probation. That’s it.”
Harry had never felt anything so wonderful. Draco’s arse was like a delicious vice grip on his cock. He moved his hips, fucking deep into the beautiful man below him. Draco’s nails were digging into his shoulders, pulling him closer.
The crowd seemed to disappear as he and Draco held each other’s gaze. To Malfoy, indeed. Only Draco Malfoy could turn his past into the greatest cause the wizarding world had seen in decades. Only Draco Malfoy could convince Harry to stop running from his past. And only Draco Malfoy held his future. “To us,” he mouthed.
Padma cringed. “Yes. There are some things you should never know about your twin, and what they sound like during sex is definitely one of them.”
“Are you happy?”
“Uhhh...”
“Merlin, no. Not by a longshot.” He gave Draco a quizzical look.
He rolled his hips, and the friction of his cock against Harry’s was electrifying. Slowly, he worked his nibbles down to Harry’s collarbone, his chest, his nipples. Merlin, how had Harry never known his nipples were such an erogenous zone? When Draco finally reached Harry’s lower region, Harry placed his arms behind his head and looked down the length of his body. Draco smirked and licked his lip. He twirled his fingers in the soft mound of hair at the base of Harry’s penis. He lowered his mouth and planted soft kisses on Harry’s inner thighs. Slytherin fucking tease, Harry thought.
Draco smirked. “For the rest of your life?”
“Right.”
Harry gaped. He was at a total loss for words. He had not seen Dudley since the day they left Little Whinging. Dudley had thanked him for saving his life, but then he left with Vernon and Petunia, never to be heard from again. Until now. Harry didn’t know whether to laugh, cry, or run away. He gulped down a large breath and reminded himself that he was still on the clock as a representative of the Ministry. “He-hello.”
Harry swallowed, his Adam’s apple beckoning for Draco to kiss it. He did. It was irresistible. Harry giggled. “I’ve, uh, had a finger up the bum before.”
“Merlin, no.” Harry planted a peck on Draco’s mouth then scooted down the bed until his face was between Draco’s legs.
“Not enough. What can I say? I look good in them.”
Malfoy had the audacity to come after him. Harry ignored him, and replayed their conversation just now. Rather abusive. Yes, that’s what starving a child is. Beating a child. Berating a child. Using a child for slave labor. Fuck Malfoy’s privileged ass.
His slimy voice was closer now. Harry turned to cross the street to get away from him. A horn sounded, and Harry looked up just in time to see a car headed straight for him. He froze in fear. “Damn it, Potter!” was the last thing he heard before someone grabbed his arm and swirled him away.
“There’s something I wanted to talk to you about. Could I buy you a drink at the Leaky? Say around six?”
He took a shaky breath and wiped his wet eyes. “I’ve lost everything. My mother, my home, my friends. Sometimes, I just can’t bear the weight of the guilt. I did terrible things. I may have done them to survive, but I’m still ashamed. And I miss my mother.”
Draco finally emerged with a satisfied smirk on his face and two suits draped over his arms. “Found them.”
Malfoy averted his eyes. “I thought having Harry Potter behind the law would help persuade the Wizengamot and the public. My name isn’t exactly a positive one. And you have so much influence that--”
“Oh. That’s bloody stupid.”
“It’s my fault that everyone is having to go through this. Voldemort was after me. It’s my fault.”
Draco sat up, forcing Harry’s head to fall down abruptly. “What?”
After a night of tossing and turning, Harry still had no answers. He wanted to Floo straight over to Draco’s flat and demand an explanation. But he wasn’t sure that would help anything. He stared at his window, hoping Draco’s owl would show up. He took his breakfast in front of the fireplace, willing Draco to walk through it. But he never showed.
He fell asleep thinking of Draco’s kiss.
Ron turned around from the dresser next to his bed. “Malfoy?”
“I’m trying. You…” His voice trailed off. He swallowed. “You make me believe that maybe it’s possible I am.”
“I need to see your cock,” Harry rasped. “I need it, Draco.”
“Now, as you are all eighteen years of age, you have some added privileges. First, you can come and go from Hogsmeade as you see fit. That means if you’d like to pop into town for dinner or spend a night away for…privacy…” His eyes studied Ron and Hermione, who were cuddled up together in an armchair. “…you are welcome to do that. If it starts interfering with your studies, we’ll have a different conversation.” This time, he looked pointedly at Seamus.
Draco rolled his shoulders back. “Hello, Professor.”
Artemis asked Draco to stay for a few minutes. She said she could give him a potion to help prevent the anxious nausea. “Shame is a useless emotion, Draco,” she added. “Guilt is healthy. It means you aren’t a sociopath. But shame…you don’t need that.”
“All right then.” He placed his book on the nightstand and extinguished his lamp. “I’m tired. Some brute of a man decided to ride me like a Firebolt. Good night, Harry.”
He shook his head. “No, it’s Daisy’s birthday party. Ron and Hermione are bringing Rose and Hugo, too.”
Soon it was time to get ready for Daisy’s party. He had no desire to be around people today, but he would do it for Daisy. He dreaded seeing Ron and Hermione; they would instantly know something was wrong. By the time he showered and dressed, he still had not heard from Draco. He sent along a Patronus with a simple message: “I’ll be ready whenever you want to talk.” Then he collected Daisy’s gifts and headed to the Dursleys.
“Thanks.”
“Oh, it’s swelling. I’ve got a salve for that, if you would like.” Harry said nothing, which Draco took as his agreement. “Wait here, I’ll be right back.”
“Thanks. It’s…better than anywhere else I lived. Except Hogwarts.”
Harry waited for Malfoy to continue. “I suppose I should start with my project that I mentioned. Or maybe before that. I don’t know. It’s all so much, and we don’t know anything about each other and...”
“I can’t stop drinking. If I stop drinking, then everything just feels like too much. Everything the Carrows did…so many Cruciatus curses…I thought for sure I’d end up going mad like my parents. And then I feel so guilty that I didn’t, but they did. And I can’t…I just have to keep drinking. But Luna…” Tears started flowing freely again. “Luna said I have to stop or it’s over between us. And I love her so much, but I don’t know how to stop.”
“You loved it.”
“The password is ‘
“Well, she did commit murder. But she was married to a monster of a man and finally had enough. We’ve bonded over being married to men like that.” She cleared her throat. “As you know, I’m allowed visits from my solicitor. I have filed for divorce from your father. It will be official soon, and I am returning to my maiden name.”
The rest of the day passed in a blur of laughter and food and, oddly, the Minister for Magic starting karaoke with his booming and slightly off-key voice. It was the strangest and most fun Christmas Draco could remember.
“Um. I don’t know.” He ran a hand through his hair, which had become much easier to tame and style with Draco’s suggestion. “Do you want it to be a date?”
Draco nodded. “Good idea. I think I have one.” He disappeared down the corridor and slammed a door behind him. Harry stretched out on his couch and flipped through the stack of papers. Everything was in order. Dawlish and Kingsley were good men; there’s no way they wouldn’t put this before the Wizengamot. Harry looked over Draco’s list of presentation spells and practiced taking charts off the paper and displaying them in the air. By the time Draco returned, he could do the spells wandlessly.
“Um, sure.” He attempted to flatten his hair and dusted his dinner crumbs off his jumper. A moment later, Draco stood in his living room. He crossed the room and pulled Harry into an unexpected embrace. Harry stiffened, shocked at the random display of affection. But Draco felt nice, and Harry had wanted to hold him in his arms for so long. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist.
“So, what do you think?”
Harry beamed. “But it was all your idea, Draco. To Malfoy!” He raised his glass.
“I almost didn’t think you were going to order,” Draco said when Harry opened the door at nine forty-five Friday night.
The classroom did not feature any desks. Instead, eleven cushy armchairs sat in a circle. The room was decorated with posters of pretty landscapes that said things like, “This too shall pass” and “You are more than your what happened to you.”
“Draco! Mate! Are you all right?”
“You know what it feels like to get one. I’ll let you know if I don’t like something. Just…no teeth.”
“Sounds great.”
Draco blinked. His father? Lucius was dead? “How?”
“Hand me my wand.”
“I’ve never told anyone all of it before. Like I said, I try not to think about the past.” His eyes had welled with tears, and they threatened to overflow. He tried not to let them fall, tried to stay composed.
“Um. All right, yeah. I have a mobile. Let me give you the number.”
“I know most of you are probably not very happy about this situation. But the more you are willing to open up, the more healing you can do. We have a very important rule in these sessions. What is said in here, stays in here. Do not go discussing a group member behind their back. People may say very personal and vulnerable things. You wouldn’t want them airing your secrets. Don’t do it to them. Can everyone agree to this?”
“And I’m so used to everything being my fault. It always was when I was a kid. My aunt and uncle blamed me for everything. One time they blamed me for getting a liberal MP elected to the Muggle Parliament.”
The meeting with Kingsley and Dawlish went so well that Draco nearly jumped up and down like a schoolgirl when he and Harry exited the Ministry and blinked in the bright sunshine. It would still be nearly two months before the law hit the Wizengamot, but it was on the agenda, and copies of the law were being sent to every member. They encouraged Draco to go ahead and establish the charity so that training and public information could begin immediately if the law passed. Both officials seemed to think it would.
“I’m in. Whatever you need, interviews, endorsement, money—although I’m sure you’re richer than me—whatever. I don’t know what getting a law passed entails. But I’m in.”
“Potter, please! Harry!”
“For doing what you wanted for once in your life. I know how hard expectations can be.” But before Harry could respond, Draco had drifted back to sleep. Harry yawned, and decided he would enjoy his first day free with a post-blowjob nap.
“Not at all.” She grinned. “Who is ready for dinner?”
“What? How did you know?” She looked up from her book and arched an eyebrow.
Their food came out just then, and the cousins sat in silence, eating and listening to Daisy talk about anything and everything. Harry tried to stay in the moment, but his mind kept slipping back to his childhood with the Dursleys. He hardly recognized the man in front of him. He wondered if Dudley was thinking of their history, too.
and the bottle of lotion he liked.
Draco nodded. “I’d like that.”
“I just wanted to see you flounder a bit. It was quite amusing.”
Draco’s eyes widened. “You do?”
“For what? Getting me drunk?”
“Yes.”
“Mm?”
“Anytime, mate.”
“Ah, yes. Fuck. Move them around.” He used his own hand to show Harry how to scissor his fingers. He closed his eyes and let himself enjoy the stretch. “Another one, love.”
“Right. Dumb question. Sorry.”
“It’s your ancestors’ sense of decorating, you arse. You’ll have to help me decorate.” He pulled Draco up the stairs. “But my bedroom—our bedroom—should be clean. I had Kreacher prepare it. He’s excited to have a Black in the house again.”
“Like a monk?”
“Nothing is wrong. Or it shouldn’t be. It was a good meeting.”
Harry laughed. “Fuck off, Draco. You should be thanking me. Unless you wanted to walk in on them in the toilet, or worse, on the couch in the middle of the night.”
“And what?”
“Voldemort’s curse didn’t fail in the forest. It killed me, but it took the Horcrux inside of me with it. I was dead, for awhile. In a place between. Dumbledore was there, and he cleared up some things. And then I had a choice.”
“Gah!” Teddy shrieked, breaking the tension. Andromeda laughed. “Can’t stand an emotional moment, just like his mother.”
“Good.”
Harry smiled. “It’s only October. You don’t have to decide yet. Spend some more time with her.”
The eighth years mumbled a yes, but no one addressed Draco. The first to take a seat were the three returning Slytherins: Blaise Zabini, Daphne Greengrass, and Millicent Bulstrode. They sat as far away from Malfoy as possible.
Draco won, and he gloated like he usually did. Harry smiled at him, instead of throwing light-hearted insults about cheating his way.
“Is that why he lived with Daddy when he was little?”
“She’s right,” Ron nodded. He always sided with Hermione.
“Shh. Don’t get your panties in a wad. Relax. Any Slytherins you want to know about?”
Draco sighed. “I suppose we should get it out of the way. Fine. Harry, I deserved it. I was casting the Killing Curse. You hit me first, thankfully.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Fine. But only because you’re cute.” He made his way into the common room and looked everywhere for the wine, turning over cushions and looking under tables. The wine was nowhere to be seen.
Daisy’s birthday was coming up soon, and Harry wanted to take her to her first Quidditch game. He stopped by the Department of Magical Games to buy tickets to an upcoming Holyhead Harpies versus Falmouth Falcons game. He thought Daisy would enjoy seeing an all-women team play against a mixed gender team. After all, football wasn’t like that. And Draco’s favorite team was the Falmouth Falcons. On a whim, Harry bought three tickets. Even he wasn’t sure what he was he was doing.
“It’s all right. I don’t remember the particulars, but I’m sure I deserved it.” He lay his blond head on Harry’s shoulder. “Well, we’ve got all day. Want to lay around and do nothing?”
“I feel like you used to be nicer.”
“I quit!”
“No. Well, yes. Well, see the thing is...” Harry ran a hand through his hair. He had never been eloquent, but he could usually at least get a sentence out. He took a deep breath. “I’m resigning from the Aurors.”
“Fine. Welcome to our home, Draco. I’m sure it’s not up to your standards but---OW! Fine, I’ll stop.” Ron rubbed his arm where Hermione had pinched him.
And it wasn’t just Harry who was sharing his innermost feelings. Draco, too, had become quite the open book. He said it was the only way he had managed to heal as much as he had. He told Harry whenever something triggered a bad memory. He talked about the terrors he was forced to witness as a teenage Death Eater living with Voldemort. Harry had never been in a relationship where he didn’t have to keep secrets. It was refreshing.
Harry slept most of the day Saturday before meeting Ron and Hermione for a pint. Neville and Luna joined them. He always enjoyed their company, and he loved seeing them so happily in love.
“Friends? Didn’t you and Mr. Potter try to kill each other just two years ago?”
Draco agreed with a sad look in his eyes; he knew better than most people just how cruel Voldemort had been. “Very mean. Your Uncle Harry is sometimes called the Boy Who Lived.”
“I do believe the people who have spent the last year with him would know better than you,” Anna bit back.
Harry shook his head. “It was just hot in there.”
“Or an exhibitionist streak,” Neville said.
He placed a hand on Draco’s hip and gestured toward the door with a raised eyebrow. Draco nodded. They followed a large crowd of older students out of the Great Hall.
“Cool. Cool. So, the bloke just left?”
Draco moved his head and pushed Harry’s knees further apart. “Look at that gorgeous, tight arsehole. I’m going to give you the best orgasm of your life.”
“Oh.” Was Harry a terrible kisser and had never known? And Draco had imagined it? Harry’s heart pounded in his chest. Draco noticed how Harry’s face had fallen.
Years spent beating death and fighting evil created a unique bond, and Harry was still in the habit of rushing to his best friends whenever something major happened. He checked his desk for any new cases—there were none—then rushed down to Hermione’s office. She was meeting with a goblin representative, and Harry paced up and down the hallway waiting for her to finish. When the goblin finally left, Harry pushed into her office, slammed the door, and cast a silencing spell.
Harry has a realization.
“You wish.” Harry kicked off his shoes. “I thought I told you to touch yourself.”
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck as he fully sheathed Draco’s cock inside of himself. Draco groaned, and Harry’s mouth trapped him in a kiss. Harry began to move slowly, letting out little gasps whenever Draco’s cock grazed his prostate.
“I do, though. Harry, Harry, Harry. Harry Potter. See, I was mean to you. So mean. And to Granger and Weasley, too.”
It had been a slow few weeks for the Aurors, and Harry was relieved to get an out-of-office assignment. It had been getting harder and harder to look busy at his desk. The case was hardly thrilling, and Harry would be home after a couple hours of Obliviates, but it was something to do. Harry had never learned how to handle tedium well. Something about having a homicidal maniac out to get you from age 11 had left him easily bored.
Draco gave him an odd look. “Are you all right? I said your name several times.”
Harry gave a generic response, and soon Luna was talking about some new species of Nargle that had been discovered in Thailand.
“Good.” Harry locked his arm through Draco’s and turned toward the door. He and Draco walked slowly back to the crowds where Celestina Warbeck was singing a song she had written for the victims. “Sometimes, being famous comes in handy.”
Draco nodded and Andromeda held out her arm to him.
Draco laughed with his eyes closed; sleep was calling. “Best Christmas present ever.”
Remus studied him. “Then don’t pick anything.”
Every eighth year returned home Saturday except for Harry and Draco. Harry had promised Molly he would come visit plenty during the holiday. But for now, he was glad to have an entire dormitory alone with his boyfriend.
“Did I say something that upset you during the session? I’m sorry if I did.”
Remus laughed. “She’ll get over it.”
“And now you have some important job with the, er, Ministry of Magic?”
I hope you enjoyed reading, especially you Drarrelie! Happy Holidays!
Of all the wizarding businesses to open in the post-war boom, Harry was most excited about Curry Cauldron. Perhaps it was the one-quarter of Tamil blood that ran through his veins, but there was just nothing like the combination of spices and layers of flavor that Indian cuisine provided. Not that bland excuse for a chicken tikka masala that Aunt Petunia used to make. But the times the Dursleys ordered out were some of his only happy memories.
Another loud pop pulled him from his thoughts. It wasn’t like Steve to be early but when he turned around, he saw Andromeda smiling at him.
“You’re bent?!”
“Welcome home, Draco Malfoy.”
“It goes with your eyes.” Draco shifted and cast his eyes to the floor. “Will you...”
They both groaned. Harry’s was pure pleasure. Draco would be walking funny later with so little preparation, but he didn’t care. He sat still for a moment with Harry sheathed inside him. Once adjusted, he began fucking himself on Harry’s cock.
“About eight years, I think.”
Those were words Draco never thought he would hear Harry Potter say. But here they were. Determined to bring back the earlier vibe, Draco snogged Harry and touched him through his trousers until they were both completely hard again.
Harry’s smile faltered. “That’s all we’ll ever be to the rest of the world, isn’t it?”
“If you’re so curious, ask him next time you see him,” Hermione told him, like it was the most obvious suggestion in the world.
Hermione had tears in her eyes. She nodded. “Thank you, Draco. That means a lot. I forgive you and hope we can start over. And I’m sorry for punching you all those years ago.”
“Me, too.”
Dudley laughed. “Can I buy you dinner? I know Daisy must be getting hungry, and I promised her hamburgers. There’s an American restaurant on the second floor that’s quite good.”
Professor McGonagall met him at the grand front doors. Her lips were a tight, straight line as she nodded at him in greeting.
“Right.”
“All right.”
Draco was so lost in thought that he didn’t notice the other person glaring at him from the other side of the hall.
Heat rose to Harry’s cheeks. “What the fuck, Malfoy?”
“I’m fi—oof.” Harry had elbowed him hard enough to make him double over. “Fuck.”
“What? How can you say that?
“I said it shoud have been you that got killed in the battle. Not my mum. She was an Auror. It should have been you.”
“Now, I would like to address some major changes that will be occurring with your schedules this year,” McGonagall continued. “In the last few years, we have all witnessed terrible events. Events that haunt us, day in and day out. Most of you are grieving losses of loved ones. Some of you fought in the Battle of Hogwarts. And for those of you that were here last year under the tyrant regime of the Carrows, you experienced unspeakable horrors. We will get through these together.
“I’m glad the ice cream is okay.”
“Good. Well, you should invite him over Saturday night. It’s about time we get to know him. You know, as more than the Slytherin bully.”
Harry thrust the forgotten toiletries into Ron’s hand. “Thanks, mate!”
But when she looked into her son’s eyes, a smile spread across her mouth and spread past the dark bags under her eyes. “Draco.”
“Mother, these shackles…”
“I see. Did you feel like it was your responsibility to make him feel better?”
Harry thought. But instead he just shrugged.
“Harry?” Draco’s voice sounded concerned. What was he doing here? Go away, Harry thought. “Harry?” He knocked on the wall outside the shower. “Are you okay?”
A serpent-green Oxford near the back drew his eyes. It matched his eyes perfectly, and it was quite the Slytherin shade. Draco might find it amusing. And hopefully attractive.
“Oh for the love of…” Anna muttered.
Draco gave him a skeptical look. “You’re my last delivery. Why?”
“He is.”
Narcissa sighed. “Well, it’s not the finest accommodations I’ve ever stayed in. But I pass the time. They give me all the books I can read. I’ve been reading Muggle books, Draco. And we really did have it all wrong.”
The vote opened. One by one, each member of the Wizengamot cast their vote with a wave of their wand. Magical tally marks filled the air in the center of the courtroom. Harry’s heart beat faster with every vote. The “for” column filled up. In the end, only three council members voted against the law: all were elderly and unpleasant.
At home, Harry drank a whole bottle of elf-made wine by himself. That night, he dreamed that Vernon The Clown kept taking his food away but Dudley kept shoving it down his throat as he yelled, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”
want to be with Draco for the rest of his life, but he didn’t want to propose to him in the hallway right after Draco’s father was murdered.
“I love you, too, Draco Malfoy, you brilliant, wonderful man. Let me prove it to you.” With a wave of his wand, he undressed both of them. Draco smirked but Harry planted a passionate kiss on his lips before he could reply with some smart-ass comment. He ran his hands over Draco’s bare chest down to his already swelling cock. He gave Draco’s long erection a tug. Draco groaned into Harry’s mouth, sending a shiver down Harry’s spine.
“Nah, I already know.”
Harry felt a flush creep up his neck. “Thanks, mate.”
“I know, mate. But you can’t just ignore the past. It has a way of affecting you even if you don’t confront it.” He gave Harry a pointed look that clearly said, since you refuse to deal with it.
“Thanks, mate. How’s work going?”
Andromeda stepped back and put her hands on Draco’s shoulders. She patted his face, just like his mother. “I am so glad to meet you, nephew of mine.”
Harry yawned. “You’re a bloody swot. You and Hermione should get along great.”
“Sure.” But Neville didn’t seem bothered by the strange meeting. He changed the subject to talk about his summer plans with Luna. Harry tried to pay attention, but he couldn’t stop stealing glances at Malfoy, wondering what he was up to.
Harry told Pomfrey that he found Draco puking in the bathroom and insisted he come to get a potion. Pomfrey checked Draco’s temperature and handed him a peppermint-flavored tonic. Harry asked Pomfrey to send a note to Lupin and McGonagall then assured her he would make sure Draco went straight to bed.
Harry stood and made his way to the kitchen, stopping to kiss Draco good morning on his way. He set about making the coffee, only using magic to boil the water, but manually measuring out the coffee into the French press. He carried two steaming mugs to the couch and curled up next to Draco.
“I am, too, as you can see.”
“Do you want to come in? Help me finish all this food?”
He pictured her in his mind and tugged on his dick. But he couldn’t hold the image. He imagined Ginny and that time she had tied him up with their ties. Yeah, that worked for a bit. But then she changed to Charlie Weasley, and Harry came in a moment.
“Yeah, well. You think I’m dense. You should meet the Dursleys.”
“Here you go. Put this on then I’ll adjust it for you.” Draco handed Harry a black, pinstriped suit, black Oxford shirt, and a Slytherin-green tie. “Leave your shoes out here, and I’ll transfigure them.”
“Are we really to believe he’s changed?”
Draco began to giggle. Then the giggles turned into deep, belly-aching laughs. “He’s dead then? The bastard is dead?” he managed to gasp out between chortles.
“You went through some pretty major shit, Harry. It’s okay that it still affects you. It’s not okay to just pretend it doesn’t, though.”
“I could go on…or I could come back. And it was a hard choice. After everything, it was tempting to just go. But I came back.” Tears leaked out of his eyes and rolled onto the pillow. “Time moved differently there, so it was only a matter of moments. And then your mum came to see if I was alive. And, well, you know the rest.”
He flung the door open. “Hello—MALFOY?”
McGonagall looked at Artemis with a raised eyebrow then nodded. “He was killed by his cellmate.”
Draco’s eyes filled with tears. “You really don’t think I deserved it?”
“Hermione, I need to talk to you.” She was laying on her bed reading a book. After a few weeks of the sleeping draught, she had returned to her bookish self. Sleep deprivation has terrible effects, Artemis had taught them.
“Bastard.”
“If she can forgive me,” he heard Draco whisper as sleep overtook him. Harry didn’t budge until Draco’s alarm went off in the morning.
“No, it’s just...well, no one has ever asked me that before. I’ve never thought about it.” He finished the bite of rice then sat the fork down. He placed his elbows on the table and lay his chin in his hands. “It should be an easy answer, right?”
Harry smiled. He placed his own hand over the pale hand that rested on Harry’s stomach. “I think I am, too.”
“Yelling. My father yelled my entire life. Usually at me. I can’t stand yelling.”
“Yes, my dearest. I’m not hungry, though I do miss proper cooking.” She reached up and patted his cheek. “I am fine. It’s not ideal, but I have survived much worse things. And I’m already halfway through my sentence here.”
“Of course. You look well. Are you enjoying the Aurors?” Malfoy had a polite expression on his face, but the forced small talk felt wrong.
Draco shook his head. “I can meet you here.”
“It’s not…you don’t get it, do you? Typical.” Ginny scoffed a little. Neville cocked his head at her. Her face grew red, and she stormed out of the compartment down the corridor.
“Really,” he said, but his voice cracked. “I can tell you about it later.”
“Did you hear what I said, Harry?” Neville tapped him on the shoulder. Hermione gave him a strange look. “Sprout is retiring next year and wants me to take the job.”
Harry paused. He wasn’t sure. It just sort of happened. “I don’t know. I guess I thought it would be bloody awkward if we shared a room and didn’t talk. And no one else seems to be talking to you, so…”
Harry threw an arm over his eyes and muttered a string of obscenities. Then he was quiet for several moments. Draco tried to cool his shock and anger, realizing it couldn’t be an easy thing to talk about. Finally, Harry spoke.
Steve gave Draco a strange look. He knew Draco wasn’t saying anything. “Doing gifts with my mum tonight. She’s got a new boyfriend, and they’re going to Bora Bora for the holidays.”
He did like looking at the pictures, but only because he wanted to look like them. Right? He liked girls. He liked girls a lot. Boobs and pussies and curves. Sex with Ginny was great. He liked thinking about that Muggle actress when he wanked. What was her name? Kate Beckinsale. Yeah.
They couldn’t keep their hands off of each other. They got each other off in the shower, which earned them a disapproving stare from Anthony Goldstein who was brushing his teeth when they exited. They ate a quick breakfast in the Great Hall before wandering around the castle grounds.
Hermione cocked her head and waved her wand to close the office door. She cast a quick Muffliato for good measure. “What the fuck? Tell me everything.”
“Can I touch you?”
Draco sighed again and picked at some lint on his t-shirt. “It wasn’t how I imagined it.”
“If you find that you need additional support, your Healer can schedule individual sessions, as well as give you appropriate potions for sleeping or other needs. And before you all decide to groan and rebel, please know that every staff member is also required to meet with a Healer for either group or individual therapy.
“Life’s too short for that, too.” She grinned at Harry. “Go get him, Cassanova.”
Draco stood and gathered his things as quickly as he could though he felt like he was moving through molasses. He met Professor McGonagall at the front of the greenhouse. Her eyes were warm and sad. “This is a personal matter, Mister Malfoy. If you would like Mister Potter to join us, that would be acceptable.”
Hermione, Padma, Millicent, and Daphne were laying on the floor studying. Ron was playing chess with Terry. Harry was busy working on an essay for Charms. Draco was trying to read a potions book for his capstone project.
“Already? Glad to see that rashness your house is famous for didn’t wear off after puberty. Well, how do you feel?”
Harry nodded, thinking. After several moments, he spoke. “Would you like to try again, without bringing up my troubled past?”
Harry bit his lip and sighed as he slipped off his own pants. Draco couldn’t believe how irresistibly sexy he was. Draco pointed to his wand, and Harry handed it to him. He cast the cleaning charm and summoned the good lube from his nightstand. The stuff they could conjure wasn’t ideal for anal. And it had been a long time since Draco had had more than his or Harry’s two fingers up his arse.
“I’m so tired,” he said to his empty flat. The sun was setting outside of his large windows, casting a golden glow on the hardwood floors. He loved how light and airy this flat was. Selling Grimmauld Place had been an easy decision. The dismal house was just a much larger version of his cupboard under the stairs.
Draco nodded. “Good. I’m glad.”
It was Hermione’s turn to laugh. “Hello? Don’t you remember when he came out in fourth year? It was the talk of the school for a solid fortnight.”
“The one who killed the ice cream man?”
“Sorry I’m late,” a familiar voice said. “You know how Martha gets when she’s on a rant.”
“No, no we don’t, Draco. We’re safe.”
“When are you free?”
“Right. Well, see you at breakfast.”
“Bellatrix? She’s dead, Draco. She’s no—oh.” He looked up at someone standing behind Draco. “Yeah, I forget sometimes. Draco, Bellatrix is dead. Molly Weasley killed her. You saw her sister, Andromeda.”
Hermione leaned back in her desk chair and studied her best friend. He knew he looked happy and sated. She couldn’t wait for him to just admit he was head over heels in love with Draco Malfoy, and she hoped Malfoy felt the same way. It was weird, but it made sense in a way. After all their shared history, their obsession with each other, it just fit.
Draco smiled. “It’s okay. I like a bit of orgasm denial. Makes it better in the end. Sometimes I wank for forty-five minutes or more before I let myself come.”
“How?” He sounded timid. It was endearing. And hot.
He knew she didn’t believe him, but he wasn’t sure what was bothering him. Rather than think on it too much, he grabbed another round of drinks for the table.
“So ready.”
Patrice and the little girl looked back and forth between the two men. “Daddy, who is this?”
Harry pulled Draco down to kiss him. He could still taste his own saltiness on Draco’s tongue. Draco whimpered as he pulled away. “It’s your turn now.”
“Investigation department?” Harry suggested through a mouthful of food.
Harry pushed open a door on the third floor. “Very excited, apparently.”
But he couldn’t. So, when Remus asked him what he wanted to do with his life, he blew up. “I don’t know! I never expected to live long enough to pick a career! I don’t fucking know!”
He felt an odd sort of peace when he finally pulled himself from the bed. It was like a hangover with a touch of catharsis. But when he looked in his bathroom mirror, he realized he looked terrible. His eyes were red and puffy with huge bags underneath. He didn’t want Daisy to see him like this, and he certainly didn’t want Draco to see him, either. Harry summoned Kreacher and asked him to make the strongest pot of coffee he could, then he rummaged through his cabinets to find some sort of potion to make him look presentable. He took extra care picking out his clothes and threw on a Harpies scarf. He folded the eight pages of parchment he had written the night before and stuffed them in his jacket pocket.
“What’s going on?” Ron’s eyes were red from the ale, and he gave Harry a watery grin. He could never hold his booze, but Hermione could drink them both under the table.
It was only the afternoon, and Harry had no idea where they would be headed so early in such attire. But Draco Apparated them to a small alleyway in London where they could smell the Thames. Harry wrinkled his nose. Draco led him to a small, riverside pub and ordered a bottle of champagne. He toasted Harry’s new career path and decision to make his own way in life. They drank and chatted until the sky began to shift into a pale yellow and orange. It was nice, just being out on a date with Draco.
He stepped forward and pinned Harry against the front door, his lips crashing onto Harry’s. Harry couldn’t help the moan that escaped his lips. How many times had he imagined being pinned by Draco’s strong arms? He returned Draco’s kiss with fervor, unable to get enough of his taste. Draco bit his bottom lip, and Harry pressed his waist against Draco so he could feel his erection. “Fuck,” Draco murmured. He released Harry’s arms and ran his hands over Harry’s chest.
“Malfoy.”
“Great. Well, um. I’ll see you then. Or before. Or whatever.”
“Yes.”
“You all right, Harry?”
Draco knelt with his knees on either side of Harry’s head. “Open your mouth, love.” But Harry’s mouth was already opening as he said it. He braced himself on his hands and lowered his weeping cock into Harry’s mouth. Harry locked his lips around the shaft, and Draco began moving his hips.
He looked so hopeful in that moment. Draco wanted to say yes, of course they were friends. But he was a Slytherin after all. “We can be if you tell me about Neville’s cock.”
The Azkaban fortress stood in the middle of the freezing sea, a looming threat of solitude and suffering. The Apparition point was on a small island a few leagues away. Draco shivered down to his bones as they rode the small, magical boat. He felt as if the temperature had dropped several more degrees when they stood on land again. Andromeda hit him with a drying spell just before they entered the prison then held his arm in a tight grip.
Seconds later, Draco landed next to Harry on Grimmauld Place. He watched as Number 12 appeared, pushing 11 and 13 out of the way. Harry took his hand and led him inside.
“I know.”
“Really?”
“I did! I made it all the way through Transfiguration without stopping.”
Harry froze and met Malfoy’s eyes. He would never have thought the man that sat before him would be capable of apologizing. But this whole evening was bizarre. “For your coffee table nearly taking my eye out? Who has a glass coffee table, anyway?”
Daisy had insisted on pizza for her party, and she and Rose chatted nonstop. Hermione and Meredith hit it off well, and Ron somehow managed to be cordial to Dudley. Harry could tell it was hard; he had seen Dudley and his parents years ago, and Ron was always protective of Harry. When all the kids went upstairs to Daisy’s room, and Meredith and Dudley cleaned up the meal, Harry was left alone with his two best friends in the living room.
“It should have been you.”
“Wine is fine.”
“You look terrible,” Draco said when Harry entered their room that evening. Harry’s eyes were red and puffy. But otherwise, he didn’t look terrible at all.
The first two years had been rough. Strangers ran up to him on the streets to thank him for defeating Voldemort. The press stalked his every move. When the anxiety attacks and nightmares became too much to bear, Hermione convinced him to see a Mind Healer at St. Mungo’s. But the Mind Healer was too starstruck to help. His best friend loaded him up with self-help books instead, and Harry used something called “mindfulness” to avoid confronting his demons. (“I don’t think you’re using it right,” Hermione had said on more than one occasion.)
“Hands are good, yes?”
First they were roommates. Then they were in the same therapy session. Now they had to work on the same project together. And they had an almost identical schedule, except Draco also had Ancient Runes and Arithmancy.
Draco kissed him quickly then pulled away. “Shut up. You have scars, too. And you’re beautiful with them.” He gently touched the oval shape on Harry’s collarbone. “We’ll talk about them later. Okay?”
“Yes?”
He found Draco bent over a mound of paperwork at the dining table. He hadn’t heard the Floo, or if he had, he chose not to acknowledge Harry. Harry took a minute to appreciate the beautiful blond man who was lost deep in thought. He twirled his quill in his fingers and sighed over and over. Harry had grown to love watching Draco concentrate. He reminded him of Hermione when she studied, with an added air of confidence and a tinge of arrogance.
“You’ve got a house. You’ve got plenty of money to live off of. You might talk to someone about investing the money for a passive income. But you have no obligation to pick a career just because.”
“I nearly killed you.”
“Good. We’ll have to try them soon.” Then Hermione rattled on about some case in her department, and the curry was forgotten.
Harry’s head pulled away with a pop. “Why are you stopping?” Draco whined.
“What do you want?” Harry gasped as Draco fondled his balls and nibbled his chest.
Draco smirked. He liked Harry’s aggressive protective nature.
Draco looked at Harry for an explanation, and Harry mouthed “Fortescue.” Draco smiled and nodded.
“Why?”
“All right.”
Several people said hi to Harry as they made their way to breakfast. And several more people glared at Draco and muttered nasty things. No one threw a hex at him, though, so he decided that was a success.
Draco waved at them from near the ticket booth, and Harry led Daisy over. He felt nervous, introducing Draco to a family member. He had not anticipated how great Draco would be with children. And when he handed Daisy a pair of bright pink Omnioculars, the little girl threw her arms around Draco’s legs.
They played a game of exploding snap in front of the fire wearing nothing but their pants that night. Harry had bought them a large handle of firewhiskey that afternoon, and they sipped it while they played.
“Nope. God, can you imagine us in the same house? We’d have killed each other.”
Malfoy mused as he chewed then took a sip of wine. Harry had to admit Malfoy had a great taste in wine and liquor. And food. This was now the fourth night in a week that Harry had come over to Malfoy’s after work to work on the child services project, as they had dubbed it, and he always enjoyed seeing what Malfoy would serve for dinner and drink. Malfoy gave Harry a strange look, and Harry realized he’d been staring at Malfoy’s mouth intently as he drank. Harry quickly averted his eyes and took a bite of curry.
Harry laughed. He was pretty sure it was fifth year for him. “So, uh, do you want to go to the Halloween Ball with me?”
Harry fell asleep quickly that night, sated and happy. He didn't even think about the fact that he did not take any Dreamless Sleep. His eyes closed almost as soon as Draco had finished him off with his mouth after riding him. But sweet dreams soon gave way to nightmares.
“Okay.” Harry grinned. “Thanks a lot.”
“Oh? What’s that?” He squeezed Draco’s strong hand.
me too much.”
Harry was confused when he woke. A warm body was draped over him and something firm pressed into his hip. He blinked a few times and took in the modern bedroom. “Oh, right.”
“Good night…Harry.”
Draco stopped, ready to move along to Harry’s grand finale. His own cock was aching for release. He slathered his fingers in lube.
The clenching from his orgasm caused Harry to fall into his own. He yelled out Draco’s name as he came, the biggest orgasm he could ever remember having.
The Ravenclaw fell face-first to the ground with a loud thud. Draco heard something crunch, likely a nose. Harry knelt on the ground next to Draco. “Hey, are you all right?”
Harry shrugged. “It comes in handy.”
“Off having a quickie in the loo, I presume.”
Draco was back. This time, he greeted Harry with a small smile.
He wasn’t sure the conditions of Draco’s release. He knew Narcissa Malfoy had only received one year in Azkaban and two years on house arrest. He didn’t know where Draco had gone after he was released from prison. He wanted to, but he couldn’t just start prying into his arch-rival’s life.
Harry nodded. “I want it.”
He threw open the cupboards looking for his stemware, only to find them cloudy with water spots. “Let me just clean these.”
“We should take him sometime, like you took me to the Quidditch game.”
That was the only thing Harry needed to hear to spring into action. He pushed Draco off him and flipped him over. The sight of his tight arsehole alone would have been enough to make Harry come, if he hadn’t so desperately wanted to be inside of it. He murmured a wandless cleaning spell over Draco’s entrance. Draco shivered, and Harry swiped his tongue over the hole.
Once everyone knew everyone’s favorite dessert, Artemis waved her wand. A floating display board appeared above her head.
The expression on Draco’s face clearly said he didn’t believe Harry in the slightest. “If you’re sure. I was just wondering what the plan was for tomorrow. Do you want to meet at the game or before?”
“Uh.” Harry fiddled his thumbs. “I didn’t like seeing him upset. And I didn’t like that you weren’t doing anything.”
Another awkward pause. Harry searched for something to say but came up short. Draco broke the silence.
“You are. I want you to believe that.”
“Yeah. Wait, are you a virgin?”
“You’re not a vampire.” Draco stepped back from the doorway, allowing Harry entrance. Harry stepped into the open-air apartment. He had not been here in nearly two weeks, since the night Draco asked him to share his story. He had missed it. Draco stood in a white t-shirt and a pair of grey basketball shorts. Harry had never seen him so dressed down, and fuck, he looked good.
He Apparated directly to Draco’s flat and knocked on his door.
Draco turned his mirror over and over in his hands. “And thanks for earlier, Harry. I hate that you keep turning up when I need saving. But you knew exactly what to do. So, thanks.”
Kingsley leaned back in his chair and studied Harry. “I see. May I ask why?”
Hermione thought for a moment. “I think I already have, Harry. I couldn’t carry around that weight for this long. And knowing how coerced he was, well, yes. I can.”
“Hurry up, Malfoy,” Harry said. He was trying to tease him, but it just came out desperate. Draco moved back onto the bed next to his partner. He placed his fingers just inside Harry’s waistband, ready to pull it back. He leaned down and whispered in Harry’s ear.
The ceremony went as well as one could expect. It was mournful and heavy. Harry’s speech went well. He talked about hope and finding lights in the darkness. He used Artemis’ words that she repeated often: “It’s okay to not be okay.”  Candles were lit for every lost loved one. When Harry was pulled away for photo ops and interviews, Draco visited with Steve. That is, until Rita Skeeter, sidled up to him, her Quick-Notes Quill at the ready.
“What?”
Draco shrugged. “You have to dress appropriately. It’s possible I planned an evening that would require you to wear a suit because you looked so damn good in one a couple weeks ago. Here, get dressed.” He handed Harry the navy suit with thin, white pinstripes. He was to pair it with a white Oxford shirt and the loveliest blue silk tie Harry had ever seen. He didn’t even know what to call all the shades of blue.
That night, for the first time in years, Harry dreamed about the bathroom in sixth year—yelling Sectumsempra and Malfoy’s dying body bleeding out over the tile. He woke up in a deep sweat, full of shame and fear. But he quickly pushed it aside and focused instead on the sounds in his dark room and the breaths he took.
The dirty talk, the feel of Draco’s hand against his prick, the sight of him on his knees. It was all so good, so much better than Harry had imagined. He arched his back as Draco pulled down his pants. His full, aching cock bounded free, and instantly Draco’s hand had grasped the base. He brought his mouth to the very tip of Harry’s, ever so slowly. Finally, just as Harry considered yanking Draco’s head forward, Draco’s tongue darted over the head of Harry’s cock. “Ohhhh,” was all Harry could say.
Harry nodded. “I trust you.”
Harry didn’t want to give a speech today. Harry didn’t want there to be an event at all today. But he was the Saviour of the Wizarding World, and he had no choice. He had even accepted a couple of interview requests—Hermione had told him it was important for people to hear from him. And one of the interviews was Luna for
Draco obliged, wrapping a fist around his hardness. He never took his eyes off Harry, who used this time to finish undressing. He stepped out of his jeans and pants and admired Draco’s flushed cock. He licked his lips then stepped forward. He knelt in front of Draco and pulled away the other man’s hand, replacing it with his own. He and Draco locked eyes as Harry stroked, savoring the throb in his hand. Draco never looked away, and it was one of the most intimate experiences either wizard had had. Harry’s hand sped up, and Draco batted his hand away. “I don’t want to come yet.”
Harry counted coins from a pouch he kept by the door near his keys. “Right. Well, it’s good to see you again.”
“You’re lying.”
It was hard, harder than he thought it would be. Other than going to work, Harry didn’t leave the house. He told Draco he would meet with him once he finished. He missed Draco, but he was in no shape to be around anyone. He even blew off Saturday night with Ron and Hermione and Sunday lunch at the Burrow.
But after Padma said that Lavender was returning, and she hoped Parvati would start dealing better, something changed.  Neville Longbottom, the Unlikely Hero And Beheader Of Giant Ass Snakes, broke down in tears.
“No, my love. You do deserve him because you are all of those things and more.”
“Potions. But I don’t know who would take
She handed him a long piece of rolled parchment. Draco unrolled it and skimmed. It was the “plan” for his safety, as well as the conditions of his release that applied at Hogwarts. At the bottom was the password for the Headmistress’s office so that he could seek her out at any time.
Harry disappeared from the flames, and Draco collapsed onto a sofa. He really didn’t deserve someone like Harry. The tears flowed freely down his face, and he didn’t bother to try and stop them.
She rolled her eyes. “Ron, again. I’ll have to wager on your marriage, I suppose.”
Draco’s face heated. He got to his feet, though he was wobbly. “I am so sorry. Please forgive me.”
At that, Draco pushed Harry across the room and onto the bed. He put his dress robes over his head and tossed them aside. The two men began furiously grasping at each other’s clothes, trying to remove them.
“Yes. Um. What is it you do for a living?”
Draco smiled and wiped his eyes. “I’m fine.”
“Me neither. Too much…too much happened here. I already have been getting shit sleep at home. How am I ever going to sleep at Hogwarts? Not even sure the whiskey will do it.”
“Good point.” They joined the other eighth years by the punch table. Hermione greeted Draco with a hug, and Ron clapped them both on the back. Harry was pretty sure he saw a few galleons change hands between some of their peers.
Harry ran a hand through his hair. Was Draco looking forward to these meetings as much as him? “Yeah. I got off work late. I’m famished.”
Harry downed more of his drink. His heart had started racing, and he very much did not want to have this conversation.
“Touch yourself,” Harry growled. “I want to see you.”
“I was about to kill you, too.”
“What the hell, Draco?”
Harry’s mouth went dry. He hadn’t expected such a blunt question. And he wasn’t sure how to answer.
Harry groaned as a loud tapping noise roused him from his sleep. He was convinced the noise was coming from inside his aching head, but as he came to his senses, he realized an insistent owl was at his window. “Okay, okay, I’m coming,” he moaned as he pulled himself upright. Owl first, then hangover potion.
Just then, Ron and Rose entered the shop. Harry waved them over and introduced them to Daisy. By the time Daisy was finished with her ice cream, she and Rose had declared themselves best friends.
And he had Draco. Draco Malfoy, his former nemesis, an ex-Death-Eater, a boy he had nearly killed at sixteen, had brought a purpose into Harry’s life again. And somehow, that handsome wizard felt more like family than anyone else ever had. He laughed to himself as he found a deserted stretch of the park. Harry Potter was in love with Draco Malfoy.
He was yelling. When had he started yelling? He pressed the heels of hands into his eyes until he saw stars.
“I’m trying to get a law passed through the Wizengamot and establish a new department. Or office under an established department. We are still trying to work that out. Anyway, I’m working on child welfare.”
“He’s an idiot.” Ron took a sip of his beer. “What’s new with you?”
Draco shrugged. “If it’s not an easy answer, what does that mean?” Harry didn’t respond for a while, and Draco ate in silence. “What would you be doing if you weren’t an Auror?”
Harry sat up and looked Draco in the eyes. “Stop thinking you deserve bad things, Draco. I didn’t know what the spell did. I could just as easily have cast a Protego Charm. I’m sorry I hurt you.”
Draco sat up on his bed and rummaged through his nightstand for a mirror. Sure enough, his own eyes were swollen, and his face was splotchy. He hated crying. But he had enjoyed his visit with Andromeda, so he didn’t mind too much.
“Malfoy.” His voice was strained and stern.
“Oh, I was waiting for you to say it first. I didn’t want to sound like an idiot.” He gestured to the waiter and requested more wine. “And I do suspect that our relationship isn’t quite typical. So, screw typical timelines.”
“Oh. Sorry to bother you.”
“Uh, okay. I’ve only got white wine, and it’s probably not up to your standards. Shit. Where are my wine glasses?”
The other wizard rolled his eyes. “Here’s your food. Two Galleons and two sickles.”
It did. Harry knew this. But even on the off-chance they didn’t succeed, Harry had more than enough money to thrive while he figured out what he wanted to do. “I know, but it’s not just the charity. I haven’t felt happy here in a long time. Fulfilled, rather. I just...I want a chance to see what my life could be without fighting Dark Wizards.”
“Who would kill an ice cream man?” Daisy asked in a voice that clearly said killing ice cream men was unthinkable. Harry gave her a sad smile.
“And Ron?”
Draco opened the door and sighed. “Hello, Harry.”
“I’m not stalking him! I’ve seen him three times this week, after not seeing him for a decade.”
Meredith was a lovely woman, and as different from Petunia as anyone could be. She had accepted magic as a part of her life now. They both had, because they adored their daughter. Harry now went over for dinner every Wednesday, and the evenings were largely spent asking questions about the wizarding world. Harry had even promised to take Daisy to Diagon Alley with Ron and Rose. Daisy was very excited to meet another witch her age, especially one with a flower name. She had already decided they would be best friends.
Over the next three weeks, the highlight of Harry’s week was ordering curry and having it delivered by Draco. He had at least admitted to himself that he had a crush on the other wizard. He was quite enjoying the fantasies of Draco bent over his dining room table, that perfect arse in the air ready for Harry’s cock.
“I know. We can work up to that. Just get me off with your hand.” And I’ll be able to train you exactly how I want you, he thought.
“Yes.”
“No one? Not Ron and Hermione?”
“She, um. She told me that if I don’t have a place to go after Hogwarts, I could come live with her. I don’t know how to feel about that. The Manor might be given back to me. But I’m not sure I could live there after everything.”
“I think you’re right that it should fall under the DMLE instead of Magical Education, but should it go under an existing office or a new one? Pass the pad thai.” Malfoy held out his arm for the container of noodles on Harry’s other side. The two wizards were spread out at Malfoy’s dining table, also obnoxiously made of glass and sharp corners, with a myriad of documents and containers of takeaway.
Draco’s response was just a whisper. “I’ll listen. Anytime you want to confront the past, I’ll listen.”
Draco took Harry into his mouth once more. He moved his fingers in and out, careful to graze the prostate as much as possible. It was less than two minutes before he felt Harry go tense. He threw his head back and let out the loudest yell Draco had ever heard from a lover. Then Draco felt Harry’s cum splash down his throat. He swallowed and pulled away with a loud slurp.
Harry’s heart pounded in his chest. The images from his dream replayed over and over in his mind. He swallowed a large gulp of air in an unsuccessful attempt to steady his breathing. The tears had not stopped. He knew he looked a mess, but he nodded at Draco, embarrassed. “Fine.”
“Look, um. It’s just not a big deal in our world, Harry. No one would so much as bat an eye. All that would happen is that the tabloids would try to say you’re dating twice as many people now.”
“I received special permission to see you graduate, as long as an Auror escorted me.”
On a Friday, about a month after Malfoy had bought Harry a coffee without so much as a hello, Harry finally came face to face with his old enemy. There was no epic showdown. Their meeting was far from poetic. It occurred at the urinals in the Ministry toilets.
Harry had bought him a new watch, silver with emerald green numbers and hands on the face. Draco could finally discard the one his father had given him. Harry had remembered Draco’s complaints about it from months ago before they were even dating. There was a small note in the box that said, “I’ll give you the rest of your gift later.”
He cast a tempus charm and nudged Harry awake. “We’ve got to meet everyone back in Hogsmeade in fifteen minutes.” Harry groaned. “Nope. You’re not sleeping through my first night out in over a year. Get up.”
Parvati and Lavender entered the room, and everyone that was left burst into applause. Lavender, ever the diva, took a bow. Then Terry asked Draco to play chess with him. Draco was surprised, but he agreed. When he looked up again, Harry was nowhere to be found.
Hermione raised an eyebrow.  “Why were you thinking about him?”
Harry’s eyes lit up. He grinned. “Yes.”
“That’s certainly true.”
“Cool.” He tried to think of something else to say as they walked toward the back. “Uh…so you work here, too?”
“Well, yes, of course.” Harry scoffed like Artemis was an idiot.
“Newt Scamander’s biography. He’s fascinating. I always read before bed. It helps calm my mind down enough to sleep.” He leaned down to kiss Harry, who melted under his touch. Sleep wasn’t far off, not when Draco felt this good.
“I don’t know. Sometime far less embarrassing than two days into this relationship. What about you? When were you going to tell me?”
“Merlin, you’re cute.” Draco pushed Harry’s shoulders until he was lying on the ground. Then he straddled him and leaned down to kiss him.
“Harry! Draco! Come in, come in.” Harry rolled his eyes. Stressed Hermione always sounded like her mother with that high-pitched, saccharine voice. But he’d never tell Hermione that because she was the most powerful witch he knew, and she would hex him.
“We’re going to save wizarding children!”
“Did you enjoy it?”
Draco nudged Harry with his shoulder. “Whatever. Come on, let’s grab a pint and celebrate.”
“Can I kiss you, Draco?”
“No, I have two nephews on Ted’s side.”
“Oh no! Is the clown all right?”
“It’s the yelling.” He said it so quietly, Harry wondered if he had imagined it.
“No, no it’s fine. Are you certain it will be okay?”
Harry took a deep breath, trying to find his Gryffindor spirit he was famous for. “Do..do you want to come up? I mean, no pressure, but…”
“Chrissake, you’re a horny bastard.” Harry made a gesture. “I suppose you want to know about Seamus.”
“I’m sorry. I’ll try not to yell around you anymore.” Harry ran a hand through his hair. “Want to skive off Defense?”
Draco blushed. He didn’t know what to say. He thought about how he had waited seventeen years to hear his father say those words, but he never heard them. Draco cleared his throat and nodded at Remus.
He looked up at his aunt Andromeda with wet eyes. “Thank you,” he said in a choked voice.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Very well. I shan’t protest.”
But Malfoy wordlessly purchasing a coffee for Harry at a Muggle shop was far from the weirdest thing that happened that week.
“Really. Even Purebloods, we might be queerer than everyone. As long as you get married to have an heir, no one cares who you fuck. That’s the real reason we have so many arranged marriages.”
Draco didn’t understand, but he thanked her. She promised to send a house-elf with his potion later.
“Oh. Nice.” He handed over the coins. He noticed Draco’s skin was soft as their hands brushed. “Well, thanks, mate.”
Fully spent, the two laid on the floor with their hands intertwined. They laid there in silence for a long time, recovering and replaying the scene in their minds. Finally, Draco rolled over on his side and gazed at Harry.
“But I have to wear a suit?”
Get ready for sexy times
Draco nodded. He understood. What he was asking Harry to do wasn’t easy. “Of course. Do you think Hermione will help? She is a great writer.”
“I’ll have homework soon,” Draco said.
“Perhaps.”
Harry was a babbling mess by the time Draco slipped a third finger in. Good. Draco’s multitasking was relaxing Harry. Draco wanted his first time to be perfect. Draco pulled his mouth away with a pop.
Draco gave him a watery smile. Harry set the containers down and opened one. He pulled out a chocolate cupcake and handed it to Draco. Then he sat on the couch next to Draco, curled up his legs underneath him, and laid his head on Draco’s shoulder.
Whereas his trial and sentencing had been public, his hearing was held in a small, private room. No amount of calming potion kept Draco’s stomach from churning as they descended into the Ministry. He remembered the feeling of being imprisoned here all too well.  Three members of the Wizengamot and the Minister for Magic sat at a table. Draco sat in a lone metal chair opposite them.
“Oh, fuck, Draco, yes! Like that!”
“Yes, actually.” He reached for the flask and took a long drink of whiskey. He closed his eyes and savored the burn as it ran down the back of his throat. “I’m not excited to be back, Neville. I should be. But I’m not.”
Artemis and Remus were waiting in the Headmistress’s office when they entered. Draco’s heart started racing. This had to be terrible news. McGonagall tossed two pieces of paper on the ground and transfigured them into two more chairs for Harry and Draco. They sat.
Then Rose insisted they visit Flourish and Blotts; she was her mother’s child, after all. But Daisy loved to read, and Harry had no problem buying her as many wizarding children’s books as she wanted. As Rose pointed out all of her favorite books, Ron leaned into Harry. “It’s hard for her to make friends, you know. She’s what the kids call a nerd, and she can be a bit of a know-it-all.”
“Completely.” I’ve never once Splinched myself, he thought. But he decided not to mention Splinching at all.
Draco thought for a minute. Plenty of people didn’t come out until much later in life, even in the Wizarding World. He had heard people say that Muggles weren’t very accepting of homosexuality. “Well, you have had a lot going on the last seven years or so.”
“Well, good. Congratulations on coming out.”
Until one week in May when his past decided to slap him directly in the face, over and over again.
Harry sat the food on the table and let Draco pull him down for a hello kiss. It felt right and normal, like they had been doing this for a long time. They had, of course, been meeting up for a while now. But the kissing was new, and Harry liked it very much. He prolonged the kiss as much as he could before he was interrupted by his stomach. “I’m hungry. What are you working on?”
“I don’t think you have anything to worry about. Let’s pretend for a moment that when you leave Hogwarts, you’ll be free to do as you wish. What would you like to do?”
Draco swallowed and wiped his eyes. The last of the hexes were fading. He sat up. “Yeah. I’m fine.”
“I’ll leave as soon as I finish filing this. Have a nice weekend, mate.”
It didn’t take long before both of them were hard. Harry was certain he had never felt anything so hot as Draco’s erection pressed against his through their jeans. They snogged and rutted against each other until their breaths came in short, heavy pants. Harry came first, and he dug his nails into Draco’s back. He groaned into Draco’s ear. That sent Draco over the edge. He sped up his frotting and sucked on Harry’s neck until he came moments later.
Harry nodded again. Draco did nothing but sit in silence for a few moments, and Harry tried to steady his breath. Then he asked, “Do you want to talk about it?” Harry gave him a sidelong glance. He had never told anyone about his dreams. He just pushed them away and meditated, focusing on the present. Draco continued. “I got them bad after the war. The whole Manor was tainted by his presence there. And sometimes my brain would mix up him and my father. PTSD, the Muggles call it. Anyway, someone suggested to me that I talk about the dreams and the panic attacks. But I didn’t have anyone to...I didn’t want to bother my mother. So, I started keeping a dream journal. It helped. It’s like, I was able to acknowledge it, and it seemed so much less scary on paper.”
Harry smiled. He fumbled in his nightstand for his glasses and a piece of paper. “Thanks. I’ll keep you away from gin in the future. I’m free this evening if you want to...” Harry paused. What exactly was he inviting Draco to do? He shook his throbbing head and scribbled “work on our statement to the Daily Prophet.” He sent the owl off with the note and stumbled into the toilet to find a hangover potion and a bath.
Draco shrugged. “I was fed a lot of lies growing up. We’re all humans. And did you know, it’s really only Britain and parts of Eastern Europe that haven’t embraced Muggle technology. Bank cards are brilliant! Carrying around piles of gold and silver coins is annoying. I wish Gringotts would come up with a better solution, but you know how goblins are. And I hate wizard fashion. Why would I want to wear robes that drape off of me and make me look thrice my sized?”
“I am in love with Draco Malfoy, and he’s in love with me. I didn’t save Draco. He saved himself. If anyone doesn’t believe that Draco is capable of good, then they’re saying I’m a liar. We have no secrets from each other. This isn’t a fling. I haven’t been Imperiused, and I’m not under a love potion. We expect everyone to now respect our privacy.”
He looked up. Harry had an almost-smile on his face. He returned Draco’s earlier thumbs-up. But it was Hermione who surprised Draco the most. She crossed the circle and leaned down to give him a hug.
Daisy peered out from behind Harry’s legs. “It’s all right. That’s a Patronus. You can use it to send messages to people, but it’s a very hard spell to cast. That’s my friend Ron’s. He and Rose are running a little late.”
“Sure. Um, how is the thing going?”
“Says the man starting a charity and passing a law to protect wizarding children from abuse. Who is the Gryffindor now?”
“That seems to be the trend around here lately,” Harry replied. “And, I’m not strictly bent. I just don’t have a preference either way.”
“I love the Weasleys, but they are exhausting when they’re all together.”
Draco lowered his lips to kiss the sensitive skin around Harry’s entrance. Harry moaned again, loudly. Then Draco swirled his tongue around, and he thought Harry was going to alert all of Hogwarts to their tryst. Oh well, let them hear.
Harry looked confused but continued yelling. “That’s all you’re going to do? He just told you he can’t stop drinking, and it’s ruining his life. And all you can say is thank you for sharing? What sort of fucking Mind Healer are you? Help him quit drinking! Where are your bloody coping skills now?”
Just after the Easter holidays, the eighth years were in Herbology. Draco and Harry were furiously taking measurements and notes of their fluxweed harvest when the door to the greenhouse opened. Professor McGonagall stepped inside. She whispered something to Professor Sprout, who frowned.
They stopped in front of the doors to the Hospital Wing. Harry grinned at Draco. “Let’s get you that note.”
“Hello, Harry! Good to see you. We’ve rounded up all the Muggle witnesses into the shop just over there. There’s only about a dozen. Some little Muggleborn girl got scared of a clown, and she shrunk him. Can’t say I blame her. Clowns are damn creepy.”
“Safe? We’re not safe. Bellatrix will—”
“I think that’s enough of that line of questioning,” the Minister said. “Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. Now, do you have a place of residence lined up for after graduation?”
Draco said nothing; he waited for Harry to make the next move. Harry grabbed Draco’s left arm and pressed his lips against the Dark Mark. They had both been scarred by the same enemy, he realized. Draco gasped and a single tear rolled down his cheek. Then Harry moved his gentle kiss to each of the scars on Draco’s chest. He vowed to himself that he would stop running. He let his lips brush against Draco’s lightly then pulled away with a grin.
“Your theory was right,” Harry said. They were cuddled together on the sofa. Harry’s arms were tight around Draco.
Draco didn’t need to be told twice. He stripped off his button-down and threw it on the floor. He unzipped his trousers and removed them with his pants in one motion before jumping onto the bed with Harry.
Draco and Harry met Ron and Hermione at the entrance of the Ministry. Anyone could sit in the dungeons during a Wizengamot vote, and they wanted to be there front and center for the result. Deliberation and debate had already happened. All four of them had testified in front of the council over the last few weeks in support, as had several other witches and wizards.
There would be time later for slow, romantic sex, Draco decided. He murmured in Harry’s ear. “I want you inside of me. Now.”
Harry leaned over and kissed Draco’s temple. “That’s great news, babe.”
In the next breath, they both fell into roaring laughter. For no good reason, they started laughing and couldn’t stop. Harry’s gut ached from the deep chortles, and Draco looked like he might piss himself. It felt good. Right. And the sight of Draco’s tear-stained face filled with a grin was the sexiest thing Harry had ever seen.
“Mother.” Draco’s voice hitched, and he crossed the small room in one stride. He wrapped his arms around her and buried his face in her shoulders. And he cried.
Ron pulled himself out of bed, completely starkers. Malfoy’s eyes widened. Ron dug through his dresser for his uniform and dressing gown. He scratched his bum, loosely tied the robe around his waist, and headed for the shower.
“I know, babe.”
“We haven’t spoken in ten years. We haven’t so much as seen each other until a month ago, when you bought me a coffee and said nothing. What was up with that, by the way? We aren’t friends. We’ve never been friends. We were the bloody opposite of friends. And you think you can just ask me shit like this over a pint? Fuck you, Malfoy.”
“Dark Lord was a dick. A big dick. I hated him. I wanted you to save us all. And you did. You really did. You’re so good, Harry. And I try to be now. But I wasn’t.” And then Draco burst into loud, sloppy, drunken tears. “I’m so sorry. I’m really sorry.”
They were late to the party. But they came in holding hands, and everyone gaped. Harry saw a couple of cameras flash, and he knew that they would be on the cover of the Daily Prophet by Monday. He said as much to Draco, who shrugged.
“All I could think about was you and inviting you to the ball and then, well, you know how things went.”
“Mm.” Draco leaned his head against Harry’s chest. “I want to do this, Harry, if you do. But there’s so much…what people will say, all the shit between us.”
“I don’t know how to do any of what you did.”
“Contrary to popular opinion, the world does not revolve around you, Potter. Mine certainly doesn’t at least.”
“I’m not obsessed.” But even Harry realized his voice was less than convincing. He decided to change the subject. “Guess who else I ran into this week.”
“Eighth years! Over here!” a warm and familiar voice called.  Harry couldn’t suppress a smile when he saw Remus Lupin standing in front of a small table off to the side of the Great Hall. It had been a close call, but Remus’ werewolf blood gave him the strength to survive his injuries. He did not know, however, that Remus was returning to Hogwarts.
Remus stepped aside, and Harry’s smile fell. Draco Malfoy sat at the edge of the eighth year table, looking like he was ready to bolt at any moment. All of the eighth years froze, glaring at him.
“Ah, yes. Budge up.” He smacked Harry on the arse.
The day of their meeting, Harry took a half-day from work. He went to collect Draco from his flat so they could arrive together. When he arrived, Draco was pacing the living room wearing nothing but trousers and socks. His toothbrush was hanging out of his mouth, and he kept looking through his files.
It was a little awkward as Harry straddled Draco and lined himself up. He clenched his jaw as he pushed himself onto Draco’s cock just a bit. Draco breathed out a deep breath, willing himself to keep control. He ran a hand up Harry’s back and into his hair then kissed him softly to relax him more.
He shrugged. “It’s probably not the advice I’m supposed to give. But you’re only eighteen. And for the first time in your life, you aren’t fighting another man’s war. I don’t think anyone would blame you for taking some time to just…be.”
The awkward silence continued. The younger students at the other tables chatted, but it wasn’t the same. Harry watched as Draco shoveled food around his plate, barely eating a bite.
Well, tears was an understatement. Earth-shattering sobs racked his body. Draco’s nausea returned, and this time it came with a lump in his throat. He wondered how a hero could be having such a hard time.
“I’m running the charity with Dra—Malfoy.”
“Yes.”
But he intertwined his fingers in Draco’s hair and moved Draco’s head up and down, faster and faster. He could feel Draco nearly choke, could feel the tight muscles at the back of his throat constrict. But he never stopped. Briefly, Harry wondered how many men Draco had practiced this on. But he pushed the thought away and lost himself in fucking Draco’s perfect, tight mouth.
“What are your plans for Christmas?” Steve asked.
Andromeda wiped her eyes. “Do I? She’s still wearing
“Yes, this way.”
“Potter.”
“I’m bisexual.”
Harry covered his hand with the lube. Draco lay on his back with his knees up, exposing himself. He let out an embarrassing whine when Harry teased his hole. But Harry was too horny to tease much. He slipped two fingers inside Draco.
In their session with Artemis, she told them that the frequency that they met could become less frequent after the holidays. It depended on each person’s progress and wishes. But every person in their group asked to keep meeting three times a week. A few months ago, Draco couldn’t wait to be done with the mind healing nonsense. But he looked forward to it now, and he still had so far to go. There were demons he was only beginning to address.
“Harry, this isn’t easy on any of us. But I’m really worried about you.”
As soon as they exited the Ministry, Harry Apparated them straight into Draco’s living room. “You did it, Draco! I’m so proud of you!”
“Don’t touch yourself. I don’t want you to come yet.” Draco’s voice was warm but commanding. Harry removed his hand.
He had never admitted that before. Hermione would have told him that was silly, that of course he made the right decision. Ron would have freaked out and told him not to talk about stuff like that. But Draco did not do either. He reached out and grabbed Harry’s hand. “Can I hold you?”
“That’s fine. Just let me talk. Let me apologize.”
When Draco finally pulled away, he said, “I thought you had to stay at Andromeda’s.”
Draco blinked. Poor bastard thought he was the cause of this shitshow, not the evil noseless tyrant.
“Hello, Mister Malfoy.” She snapped her fingers and a house-elf appeared to take Draco’s belongings. “We have a seat ready for you in the Great Hall. There is an eighth-year table. After several meetings with the Minister and your appointed Auror, we have implemented a plan for your safety. But please, if you feel unsafe at any time, come to me or another professor.”
Harry didn’t sleep at all that night. He had written down everything he could remember about his childhood with the Dursleys. He was sure that Draco didn’t need that much information, but once he started writing it down, he couldn’t stop. Tears flowed from his face as he wrote. He remembered the hunger pains he had felt so often. He remembered how it felt when Vernon and Petunia hit him. He remembered the fear he felt all the time.
Harry bent down low over Draco’s back so he could get deeper. He moved faster and reached around to squeeze Draco’s cock. He sped up his strokes, faster and faster, his left hand never leaving Draco’s weeping erection. He felt Draco tense again at the same moment his own balls tightened. He squeezed his left hand and rammed his hips hard against Draco.
Harry made a croaking noise.
An instant later, they stood in front of the Holyhead stadium. Daisy wobbled on her feet for a moment and looked slightly green. But then she burst out a loud, “That was so cool!” and Harry knew she was fine.
Draco supposed Remus knew a thing or two about being an outcast. He nodded slowly. “All right. Let’s pretend, then. What do I do?”
He felt Draco’s hardness press against him as he straddled Harry, and Harry’s own erection strained against his trousers. He put everything in his soul into his kiss, and Draco began grinding his erection against Harry’s. Harry moaned, and Draco moved harder. He turned his head and exposed his neck to Harry, who kissed and nibbled all the way down to Draco’s collarbone. He sucked and bit, hard, and Draco let out an animalistic moan.
By Wednesday evening, he still had not heard from Draco. He had sent several owls, finally just inquiring about their work. If he wouldn’t talk about the kiss, then at least he would talk about the project he had so fully dedicated himself to. And as badly as Harry wanted Draco, he’d rather just stay business partners than not have him in his life at all.
Draco slipped in a second finger. Harry’s back arched. “Harry, I’m going to fuck you like this while I blow you because I want to feel you come down my throat.”
“Yes, well. You’re not the only with some tricks up his sleeve. Bend over the sofa.”
Harry kissed the side of Draco’s head. “Fuck other people. The rest…we’ll figure it out.”
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. He hated when people thought they owed him some life-debt. He had just done what he had to, what he thought was right. He told Draco as much. “And you saved my life, too. At the Manor. At the Battle, when you tossed me your wand. And Draco, I have so much to apologize to you for. I still feel so much shame about sixth year, when I--” His voice hitched.
They walked toward the Hospital Wing side-by-side. “That was a Slytherin maneuver, Potter. I’m impressed.”
Draco eyed him up and down before sighing. “Very well. Follow me.”
Draco grinned. “Well, get over here. You deserve a celebratory blowjob.” He patted the bed next to him with a sly smile. It didn’t take long for Harry to remove his trousers and pants and climb into the bed next to Draco.
“Ice cream!”
“But, but then you saved me. From the thing.” Draco gestured with his hands. “The fire. Fiendfyre.”
“Fuck me.”
“Why?”
It didn’t take long for Draco to come, and Harry swallowed down every bit of his release. He stood, and Draco kissed him. Then he lathered Harry’s body with soap, using it as lube when he got to Harry’s penis. Harry came in an embarrassingly short time; he’d been horny since he woke up.
Harry grunted. Hermione and Ron also had trouble sleeping. But not him. He slept too much, but he was tired all the time. They passed the flask back and forth for a few minutes. Hermione and Ron reappeared, slightly disheveled. Hermione half-heartedly scolded them for drinking.
“You’re sick?”
“I’m just exhausted, Hermione. I’ve been working late almost every night.”
“Okay.”
Harry laughed, a deep chortle that warmed Draco to his core. It sounded like home. “It was so good that I couldn’t think.” He yawned.
“Well, it’s hard to beat a castle.”
“I’m more worried about Hermione and that mean right hook.”
Draco arched an eyebrow. “Oh, really? And what do these ideas entail?”
Blodgett scratched his quill furiously on a piece of parchment. “Got it, sir.”
Draco frowned. “True.”
“He slipped out after the ceremony. I imagine seeing so many people from the past at the reception seemed unbearable.” Hermione poured herself another glass of firewhiskey. “But it is odd that he has suddenly reappeared in public recently.”
There was a long silence as everyone settled back in their seats. Draco felt as if he might be sick. But Potter had stopped yelling, and that was all that mattered right then. He did the breathing technique that Artemis had taught them on the first day.
“Wednesday is perfect.”
“Right? I should expect nothing less from making babies with Hermione. But this is good.” He gestured to the two little girls.
Hermione had seemed lighter after that. Just admitting it helped a lot, she told them. She had scheduled an individual session with Artemis. Ron opened up at the next session about losing Fred. Terry Boot talked about his nightmares.
“Welcome, welcome,” said a cheery witch with round cheeks and black, braided hair. “Take a seat wherever you like. I’m Healer Artemis Fletcher. You can call me Artemis.”
Draco looked away. “I love him.”
Harry just smiled, and Dudley and Meredith gave him a knowing glance. He shook his head. The game wrapped up shortly, and Harry gave Brian a big hug for playing so well. “Let’s go get ice cream,” Meredith said.
The two lovers lay panting and sweating on their backs, legs intertwined. They had ten minutes to get to the pub for the celebration but they needed to catch their breath. “Harry?”
Malfoy smirked. “I’m not sure how Investigation will feel about taking on more work that isn’t dark magic. But I suppose it doesn’t really matter how they feel. We’ll be training new staff anyway.”
Harry stared at the ceiling and nodded.
Harry sighed. “I wrote that thing about my aunt and uncle, you know, so you and him can write the statement for the Prophet. Anyway, he read it and came over and hugged me. And we talked.”
Malfoy Disapparated with a resounding crack. Harry stared at the spot where Draco had stood for several long moments. He supposed they were still enemies, even after all this time.
The Ravenclaws sat next to them, and Parvati sat next to her sister. Then the rest of the group filled in, all trying to avoid sitting next to Malfoy. There were only nineteen people at the table.
By the time they made it out of the shower, Harry had only thirty minutes to get dressed and get to the Ministry. Draco scourgified his clothes for him, then transfigured his jumper into a Slytherin green. “So no one knows you’re wearing yesterday’s clothes.”
“Okay. Good night, Draco.”
“I’m ready. How do you want me? On my knees?”
“Sounds like they’re having the same conversation as Parvati and Lavender,” Hermione said.
“Goddammit, Potter. Still always looking for ways to get yourself killed. I see you haven’t grown out of your laissez-faire stupidity.” Malfoy was climbing off of Harry onto his feet.
“Slowly,” Draco reminded him. He knew from experience that the first time Harry felt how tight it was, he would want to thrust deep and start pounding.
“I thought Draco would make the first move. Ron thought you would.”
“There.”
“Honestly, Potter. You have the attention span of Cornish pixie. What do you think about asking Blaise to author a draft of the law? He speaks legal-ese a lot more fluently than I do, and he is a renowned solicitor.”
Malfoy smirked. “I’m not apologizing for my impeccable style. But I want to apologize for what I said before. I was quite nervous and had no idea where to begin. It came out all wrong, and I am sorry.”
“No, it’s all right,” Artemis said. “Say what you need to say, Harry.”
“Fuck!” Draco’s hips bucked up, shoving his cock further down Harry’s throat. Harry sputtered a bit and pulled back. “Sorry.”
“Yeah?”
“I was about to kill you, too,” Draco replied. “I threw an Unforgiveable at you.”
“You are. And I have some ideas about how to celebrate your freedom and our graduation. And me finishing a year of school with no near-death experiences.”
“Finally!” Ron exclaimed. Harry rolled his eyes.
“Harry...” Draco’s voice had changed from lighthearted and happy to sad.
Mission accomplished. Harry was so aroused that his nerves were gone. He glanced down. “Take off your goddamn underwear, Harry.”
“Gee, Hermione. How could I have not noticed it? Oh, right. I was attempting to not be killed in the Triwizard Tournament by a madman and his creepy fuck of a minion.”
Harry blushed. He had somehow managed to avoid talking about his fame with Daisy because he had no idea how to broach the subject. She had asked before why people snapped his picture when they were out. But he always changed the topic. “Yes, it is.”
Harry headed into the shoe store where all the witnesses waited. He had each of them tell their version of what they had seen, then he quickly Obliviated their memories of the event. They all left, with no memory of a clown and only slightly disappointed that they couldn’t find the shoes they wanted.
Harry ran into Draco in the bathroom the next morning. They nodded at each other then went into separate shower stalls. Harry couldn’t help but notice that Draco looked much better than he had at his trial. He had testified because Draco deserved it. Draco had been coerced into becoming a Death Eater. He had let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts and tried to kill Dumbledore because Voldemort was going to kill his parents.
“Well, fuck yes.” Draco reached for his wand and cast the cleansing spell. Then he handed Harry the lube. “Lots of lube. If you think it’s enough, use more.”
“Because you’re the bloody picture of mental health right now?”
The rest of May passed in a blur of studying. Draco’s stress was amplified by the prospect of his and his mother’s hearings. His was scheduled for June 2nd, giving him time to finish his NEWT projects and take his tests before either being set free or locked away when the schoolyear ended.
Molly Weasley had knitted him a sweater. It wasn’t attractive, and it had a giant D on the front. But it was Slytherin green and very soft. Harry teared up at the gift—it was a sign the Weasleys accepted him.
Draco laughed. “And half the wizarding world was there, too.”
Once on the other side of the gates, Draco took out his wand and floated his belongings behind him. It had been deemed unsafe for Draco to take the Hogwarts Express. Not enough supervision. But returning and finishing his studies had been yet another condition of Draco’s release.
“I’m not sure if they’ll let me come back, Mother. This was only allowed because it was a school holiday, and Steve brought me.”
Harry pushed just the head of his cock in. They both groaned. Harry was biting his lip, hard, to keep himself from pushing too soon. “It’s so tight.”
“Holy fuck!”
When a witch opened up a curry restaurant on Diagon Alley, Harry couldn’t be happier. They were also offering delivery, so after a long day of grueling paperwork as a Junior Auror, he could have a steaming bowl of saag paneer delivered directly to his flat’s door.
“Harry.”
“I get that.” Draco sat on the sofa and pulled Harry down next to him. Harry snuggled up under Draco’s arms, amazed at how natural it felt. Draco pressed a kiss to Harry’s head. “Well, now you can use all the sex magic you want.”
He licked a tentative stripe up the underside of Draco’s shaft. Draco grabbed the sheets in his fists. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d had a mouth on his prick. Close to a year, probably. An image crept into the edges of his memory, and Draco pushed it away. He needed to lose himself to the feeling of Harry’s mouth.
The journalist’s eyes narrowed behind her cat-eye frames. “Fine. I see it’s true then.”
“Sorry. It’s just, well, the war’s over, Malfoy. Aren’t we too old for petty shit that started when we were eleven?”
“Oh, how lovely. Thank you. Draco.”
“Don’t wait on me,” she said. “Go home. Cry. Hug Harry.” She gave him a quick peck on the cheek and disappeared to meet with her sister for the first time in over two decades.
“Wow. He must have been very mean.”
Draco nodded. He reached a hand back to grab Harry’s knee for support then turned toward Hermione. “Hermione, I think I was the worst to you. And I’m sorry. I wish I had never heard the word Mudblood, because it’s all a bunch of hurtful nonsense. I don’t believe it at all anymore. And I am so, so sorry for what you endured at my family’s home, at the hands of my aunt.”
Draco gave him a sidelong glance then cupped his hands under the water stream for a drink.
“Couldn’t Kreacher—oh. Right, yeah.”
“Oh, Merlin no! I’m a horrible liability in the kitchen.” He grinned. “Two Galleons, a sickle, and thirteen knuts.”
“Yes, but not with cum on my jeans and grass on my sweater. Come on. Let’s go get ready.”
He looked down at his erection, disgusted by its betrayal. It had been hard since Draco had started talking about cocks. And then when Draco said that thing about
“No.” It couldn’t be. Not his mother, not when she was so close to being released.
Heat flushed Harry’s face. He nodded.
She smiled and hugged Harry goodbye. She and Draco gave each other an odd look before she pulled him into a friendly embrace. Harry grinned. He couldn’t have hoped for any better outcome.
“Okay.” Harry’s voice was raspy with arousal.
“And the Auror Office is ridiculously lax with their dress code. But this is an important meeting with the two most powerful men in government.”
“No. Lucius was a bad person. Not you. You’re a good man.”
“For work or for pleasure?”
“Promise. Go.”
“You’re a filthy little bastard, aren’t you?” Harry murmured. Draco grunted in agreement, taking Harry’s whole length down his throat. “Fuck. Oh, fuck, Draco.”
Harry looked at Draco in surprise. “You invented that spell? That’s impressive.”
Harry swallowed. It was so much easier when he hated Draco, when his past wasn’t beating him down constantly. But at the same time, life was so much better now that Draco was in it. “I’m not really good at this.”
“I know!” Draco cried. “It should have been. You’re right. Please, please stop.”
Harry swallowed. It had been a long time since he stayed overnight, usually slipping out after a shag. And he certainly had not shared a bed with anyone since his nightmares had returned. But Draco was warm, and he wanted nothing more than to wake up beside him in the morning. Brave, he reminded himself. “All right.”
The house was dark and dismal. Draco wrinkled his nose. “Your sense of interior decorating is abysmal.”
“I’m sorry, babe.”
“I’m heading that way, too,” Draco said, a little too urgently.
Teddy burst into tears at Harry’s yelling. Harry knelt and whispered sorry over and over as he picked up his godson and rocked him till he calmed down.
He walked up, hesitant to interrupt but eager to get out of there and head home. “Excuse me, Patrice? I’ve finished with the witnesses.”
Much of the workload would be project-based. Most teachers assigned them individual projects. But in Herbology the next day, he found himself partnered with Potter. Just his luck. Well, Potter may be a lackluster student, but he wouldn’t allow that to affect his grades. They were to plant, grow, and harvest various varieties of fluxweed in differing conditions through the year, with a final report on the results and recommendations for Herbologists and Potioneers.
Harry pulled away to take in the sight of a panting, sweating Draco. He met Draco’s eyes and licked his lips. “You’re delicious.”
“First, your common room fireplaces are connected to the Floo Networks only for communication. If you would like to fire-call home at any time, you will be able to. If you need privacy, please arrange a private fire-call with your head of house in their chambers. Second, we know how hard it is to be away from home at this time. If you need to spend a weekend with your parents or pop home for dinner, please arrange this with your head of house. All heads of houses Floo Networks are completely open, as is mine.”
“You let me know if you have any issues. Any at all.” Steve pulled Draco into a hug. “Professor McGonagall and the others will try their best to keep you safe. But I know there’s a lot of times when the professors won’t be around.”
Draco looked up, boring his silver eyes into Harry’s. “Harry, please don’t get mad at this suggestion. And it wouldn’t be just you; I would, too. But I think you need to share your story about the Dursleys. Not all of it, of course. All the public really knows is that they were abusive. It was one-line in a story from nearly seven years ago.”
Harry opened his mouth then closed it, remembering what Artemis said about sometimes people don’t want to hear solutions yet. He wanted to fix all of Draco’s problems. Instead, he just hugged him tighter. “I love you, Draco.”
“Honestly, don’t you work at the Ministry? How are you so clueless about our legal system?”
Lupin appeared at the head of their table with a chipper good morning. The other eighth years greeted him back in various stages of enthusiasm. The werewolf had a long cloth wrapped around his torso, with a large bulge on his chest. A bulge that moved. Lupin patted it.
“Oh, bugger. You were fast. Sorry, I’ll be out of here in a moment.” She fastened her last button and leaned down to kiss Ron. “See you at breakfast.”
“Will you come back tonight?” The words ran together, and Harry hadn’t expected Draco to be nervous. Harry pulled him close and kissed him.
Draco sat up next to him. “You’re a terrible liar. Did you have a nightmare?”
“Only the sexy ones.”
Harry kissed the top of Draco’s head. “Baring it all? Is that a sex joke?” he asked, trying to cut the tension.
“Fuck a lot of Muggles, then?”
Draco then led him to the river for a sunset boat ride down the Thames. They held hands as they watched the sun settle down behind the London backdrop. When the boat let them off, Draco didn’t let go of his hand as he took him to a restaurant for dinner. A Michelin-starred restaurant.
“Why would I do that? We get along fine.”
Draco looked up to see a seventh-year Ravenclaw he didn’t know by name. He had definitely called Draco names before. And spat at him. Draco’s heart started to race. He had become too confident walking around Hogwarts alone.
He cried out when he came.
Harry smiled. “To us.”
Their wands were confiscated for identity verification and placed in small lockers. A guard escorted them to a small waiting area where several other people were waiting. No one looked happy. No one talked.
There were several beats of silence. “Draco? You still there?”
“What are you doing?”
Harry’s head popped into the fireplace just moments after Draco entered the eighth year common room. His voice was soft. “Hey, babe.”
“Weasley.” Draco’s voice sounded like the arrogant teen they all used to despise.
Harry laughed sardonically. He had fought a war and defeated the darkest Wizard of all time since he last saw Dudley. He tried to find a way to say it without sounding cruel. “Um, you know. We had that war.”
“Did you ask them again?” Harry asked.
This was just odd. Malfoy had never even feigned politeness before, and he had certainly never cared about Ron and Hermione. They were silent again, and Harry took the opportunity to really take in Malfoy for the first time. He had filled out, Harry noticed, no longer a scrawny git. The lines of his face had matured and sharpened; Harry’s eyes kept flicking back to that jawline. His eyes gave nothing away about what he was thinking, but Harry couldn’t help but notice they were the loveliest shade of silver. He wore navy shirt with no tie, and the first two buttons were undone, exposing his Adam’s apple and the slightest hint of a chiseled collarbone. There was no doubt about it. Draco Malfoy was attractive.
“You, too.”
Harry slept fitfully and not much at all that night. Why had Draco left like that? Maybe he didn’t feel the same about Harry. But he had returned the kiss quickly and urgently. And he had definitely been hard. Was he seeing someone else? It was possible, but he had never mentioned it. Maybe he had never been with a man? But based on the Hogwarts rumor mill, he was pretty sure Draco was as pansexual as he was.
Hermione, as sober as if she’d just drank three pints of sparkling water, shrugged. “Every so often, the Prophet runs a theory about him on a slow news week. But no one knows.”
It was more than an hour. Draco and Harry fell asleep, a mess of arms and legs and blankets. They awoke in the early hours of the morning, giving each other sleepy kisses and gentle caresses.
“Cheers. Well, catch you later, Susan.”
“I died, you know. That night in the forest.” He had told Ron and Hermione about Kings’ Cross, years ago. And many people suspected that he had in fact died and come back to life. But he had never told anyone else what had happened in the world between worlds that night. Once the words came, however, they would not stop. He told every detail of it to Draco, not caring if he sounded like a crackpot. “Sometime I wonder if I made the right decision, coming back.”
His breathing quickened; he felt like was going to suffocate, though Draco’s bedroom was quite open and a pleasant temperature. He quietly recused himself from the room and made his way into the living room. He needed to calm himself down.
“We are all dealing with the trauma of war and the feelings of grief. At Hogwarts, we support each other. We have always been dedicated to raising strong, capable wizards and witches. We hope that by helping you heal from your emotional wounds, we will set you up for a successful, fulfilling life.”
He climbed off of Harry and kissed him breathlessly. They lay there for a long time, catching their breath.
“Oh god...eat...me,” Draco panted.
Harry stared at Malfoy as he continued to explain. Malfoy could have told Harry that he was a hippogriff in love with a unicorn, and Harry wouldn’t have been as surprised as he was by this revelation. Draco Malfoy, champion for child welfare. But Harry listened, intrigued.
“Mm?” Harry lay with his eyes closed, relishing the satiation that comes with powerful orgasms. He didn’t think he could form a coherent sentence just yet.
“That’s going to be up to Malfoy.”
“Then why are you upset?”
Harry planted a kiss on his cheek. “You better. How’s Steve?”
“Great! I’ll see you then.” Malfoy turned and left Harry alone in the loo, wondering what in the hell had just happened.
“I think I’m using sex as a distraction. It’s the only time I don’t feel like everything is caving in on me. I can’t even concentrate to study like I used to. All these thoughts creep in, and I feel like I’m drowning.”
“But a business meeting with McGonagall? Coming out of a Wizengamot office grinning?”
“How did you manage to convince him you had changed and get him interested?”
Harry mouthed the question and rolled his eyes. Then something like enlightenment dawned on his face. Draco could never understand how every emotion just lived on Harry’s face. Heart on his sleeve was the expression, he thought. It was fascinating.
“Asked Kreacher to keep an eye out and let me know. I knew you wouldn’t want to bother me, so I wanted to make sure you were okay.”
“Hey, Draco. It’s all right. You’re okay. Look at me.” He pushed Draco away just a little. Draco tried to focus on Harry’s green eyes, but he was too scared.
On the day of their grand opening, Harry Floo-called in his order. Forty-three minutes later, there was a loud knock on his front door.
He pulled away and wiped his eyes. She nodded approvingly. “You look well.”
“I’m staying in town tonight with Hermione. So you know…”
Malfoy gave him a look of disgust. “Possibly. Does the Investigation Department chew their food before speaking? If so, they have my vote.”
“Oh. Just going to stay here with Harry, and whoever else is left at Hogwarts.” Draco’s eyes darted around. He had lied when he told Weasley he would ask. He didn’t want Steve to feel obligated. “What about you?”
She gave him a big hug. “I’m sorry.”
“So, you’ve never seen a niffler? We have to go the Magical Menagerie! Can we, Daddy?” Rose gave Ron her best puppy-dog eyes.
“Yeah. Sorry. Just fell asleep.”
Draco thought for a moment, trying to figure out the swirl of emotions in his chest. “Remus said he was proud of me. And it just…my father never said that to me. Ever. So, I’m angry. And sad.”
“Yeah. Tired.” Harry felt self-conscious as he slipped into the bed next to Draco. But the other wizard inched closer to cuddle up against him. Draco’s sheets were exquisite and probably cost a fortune. “What are you reading?”
