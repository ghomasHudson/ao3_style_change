Sarah decided she had ignored him long enough and clambered onto the desk beside him, letting him lean his body against hers. Harry looked at her in surprise.
Draco looked over and caught his sister’s eye and scowled fiercely. She just batted her eyelashes at him.
“It was an accident, Hermione,” Sarah said firmly. She propped herself up as much as her sore ribs could take. “Yes, it’s unfortunate, but there are three others wands Harry can use until we figure out how to get him another one. You can’t beat yourself up about this.”
Ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes, wrapping themselves tightly around the centaur’s torso and trapping his arms. He gave a cry of rage and reared onto his hind legs, attempting to free himself, while the other centaurs charged.
“Daphne got a boyfriend and doesn’t want to sleep with Blaise anymore,” Pansy voiced, popping a cherry in her mouth. “He’s devastated.”
Crabbe and Warrington leered at them as they stood waiting for Professor Snape to speak. He peered at them all critically and then abruptly said, “Be on your guard. All of you. Dumbledore’s absence may cause some people to develop a newfound sense of safety. Keep your eyes open and your wits about you.” Sarah, Draco and Theo blinked up at their professor in shock as he nodded once and spun around, stalking away.
“Do you have a purpose to stopping me or are you wasting our time, Travers?” Sarah interrupted cruelly. “We have places we need to be.”
“Be careful with him, Fred,” Draco said in warning. “He’s had some history with not paying his debts. Keep that receipt and even make copies.”
to, Granger!” Lyra sighed in exasperation. “How would have you reacted if we had suddenly come up and complimented you on the number of O.W.L.S you had gotten? You wouldn’t have believed us to be sincere. Not to mention, our fathers would have had an absolute coronary.”
“Latin,” replied Mila. “Although, some spells are in German – Germany had more success creating spells throughout the years and Durmstrang has a lot of German students.”
Lyra saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick’s hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite and slide unconscious to the ground. Aberforth Dumbledore Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their children.
Sarah snorted and continued eating her meal. Once done, Amanda flicked her wand, causing the plate to fly back into the kitchen triggering an indignant squawk from one of the workers.
“Harry, I didn’t think we needed to tell each other we loved each other,” Draco shook his head fondly. “I don’t think it could have been any more obvious.”
Sarah jumped as a loud bellow cut through the silent hall and the door banged open. Professor Slughorn stalked through and slammed the door behind him. He barely gave Sarah a glance before marching off down the corridor, muttering under his breath.
to hear some suggestions. I bet you reckon I should just pop over to Diagon Alley and buy a new wand, like
Harry was blinking very quickly as Hermione berated Ron across the table. Sarah and Draco looked at Ron and then each other in disgust.
Draco snorted and dropped into a free seat at the end of the Slytherin table. A moment before Lyra dropped down beside him, he was hit with a warming charm. He jumped in shock as steam floated off his body.
“Because it’s too early for emotions. Let me sleep,” Draco groaned. He tried to bury his head further under the covers.
A sudden shout behind them made Lyra’s head whip back to see that Harry had emerged from the tower’s entrance and was bearing down on them, his fiery green eyes locked on Severus.
Harry went to grab a bowtruckle while Draco got a handful of wood lice. Sarah sat down on a soft patch of grass and got out some parchment and quills. Harry sat down beside her and said, “I wonder where Hagrid is?”
“Lyra, stop worrying,” Harry said. “You and Draco are welcome here and Molly won’t let anyone say otherwise.”
“You could have been saying anything,” Ron added. “No wonder Justin panicked, you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something – it was creepy, you know – “
But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and awkward-looking, and stared over everybody else’s heads. Mr Weasley, Fred and George were all observing him, stony-faced.
Sarah watched as Harry blinked repeatedly, obviously trying to stop tears from spilling from his eyes. She turned to Draco and nudged his hand, inclining her head towards the raven-haired boy. Draco squeezed her hand once before releasing it and stood, making his way across to Harry’s bed.
They forced their way through the tide of students, finally reaching the bottom of the stairs. Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep track of the students in their own houses; there was much pushing and shoving; Sarah saw Zacharias Smith bowling over first-years to get to the front of the queue; here and there younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings…
Two goblins stood before the inner doors, which were made of silver and which carried the poem warning of dire retribution to potential thieves. Within seconds they were standing in the cast marble hall of the bank.
“Which suits him, of course,” said Kingsley. “The air of mystery is creating more terror than actually showing himself.”
Sarah felt something press into her hand and subtly grabbed the toffees that Fred passed her, stuffing them into her pocket when Mrs Weasley’s back was turned.
“We live with him,” Lyra replied distractedly, turning around and looking for Draco’s signature hair.
“Deaumont,” said Sarah, fixing a fake smile on her face. “I believe you may have conducted business with my father before?”
“BLOOD-TRAITORS! VERMIN! IN MY HOUSE! DISRESPECTING THE NOBLE HOUSE OF BLACK! FILTHY HALF-BREEDS TAINTING THE DOOMED BLOODLINE! FILTH! TRAITORS!”
Sarah helped herself to some food as the others spread out and began to mingle. She smiled as she realised that Harry wasn’t letting Draco leave his side, a fact that Sarah knew Draco would be having no problem with.
He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets; Sarah saw George wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already doxy-filled pocket.
if we kept it to our common room,” Dean added with a sharp look at his boyfriend. “And no underage students. Means Gin and Luna can’t come, unfortunately.”
“He must have done, yes, they must have arranged that before they left the Room of Requirement,” said Remus. “But I don’t think Gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for Dumbledore, because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me.”
Greyback let go of Sarah’s hair only for her to be yanked by someone else, who dragged her a short way, pushed her down into a sitting position, and then started binding her back-to-back with other people. Sarah heard Harry whisper to everyone.
Next, she saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high heels, and heard a woman’s voice.
Fred snorted. “Let’s not talk about this at the breakfast table,” he requested. “Besides, it’s not like we got much sleep either,” he added with a leer. “I vividly remember you complaining about being tired before sliding down and giving me a blowjob – very contradictory.”
“You can ask them yourself,” George said, nodding over her shoulder. “They just walked through the door.”
Sarah tried to move to her own seat at one point, but Fred gripped her hand tighter, turning pleading brown eyes on her. Instead, she settled in his lap and curled one arm around his shoulders, leaning sideways against his chest. His arms came to encircle her tightly.
The biggest confrontation occurred when Harry distractedly admitted to Draco that Snape had refused to teach him Occlumency anymore. Draco had marched right up to Snape at breakfast and began shouting so loudly and quickly in a mixture of French and English that Snape had dragged him from the Hall by his collar.
Another hour passed before Sarah finally called it quits. She had been up in the air doing drills with the promising Chasers while Draco did drills with the Beaters and Keepers.
“All we have to do is find somewhere that works for us to practice in,” said Hermione. “We’ll send a message round to everybody when we’ve got a time and place for the first meeting.”
Sarah held Draco back as he tried to push forward, tried to get to Harry – to stop him from being treated like a piece of trash – a nobody.
He turned toward the setting sun and watched as its rays bounced across the water like giant strokes of a paintbrush.
He leant forward and ruffled Sarah’s hair, ignoring her outraged squawks. She batted his hands away but that only encouraged him more. Soon, it became a struggle of hands and limbs until Sarah ended up in a loose headlock with Sirius’ fist rubbing the top of her head.
Harry didn’t look very comforted by this thought. The carriage began to move, bumbling over the rough ground and toward the castle.
Sarah hadn’t been specific about what time Harry would be picked up but he had already packed his trunk and personal belongings.
She was flushed and trembling by the time she finished. Shocked gasps and faces surrounded her and she cringed as she looked at her Potions Professor. His face was pale, eyes narrowed and nostrils flaring. Sarah was sure she was going to land in detention for the rest of her schooling career.
Harry laughed but didn’t stop his movements. Draco was worried that he would drop off to sleep again before he was distracted by the smell of…was that…
The scoreboard was flashing BULGARIA: 160, IRELAND: 170 across the crowd, who didn’t seem to have realised what had happened. Then, slowly, the rumbling from the Ireland supporters grew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight.
Narcissa bid them goodbye and before they knew it, Remus had dropped Fred, Sarah and Draco off at The Burrow. Mrs Weasley had immediately drawn Draco and then Sarah into bone-crushing hugs.
“How’d you manage that?” she whispered to him as Hermione and Rita snapped at each other, Draco and Harry watching on in avid interest while Luna happily gazed off into space.
“But maybe you’ve got to be related to Slytherin, so Dumbledore couldn’t – “ began Dean, but Professor Binns had had enough.
Deciding that watching her was more interesting than re-reading the rubbish in the book, Sarah rested her chin on her hand and cocked her head slightly, casually waiting until the professor noticed the other girl. After a few minutes, she felt Harry stir beside her and noted that he was also watching Hermione now. It wasn’t long until more than half the class was staring at Hermione rather than at their books. Professor Umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the situation no longer.
Sarah smiled in return and gestured for him to sit. “I think Harry took his wand with him,” she mentioned to the professor. “He doesn’t want a repeat of the last game.”
“I need you both safe,” she said to Sirius and Remus. “You’re practically my parents – I can’t lose you.”
didn’t want to be bothered with her. She like me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn’t do it for my mother, I could get her to calm down when she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me feed the goats. Then, when she was fourteen…see, I wasn’t there,” said Aberforth. “If I’d been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn’t as young as she was, and…it was an accident. Ariana couldn’t control it. But my mother was killed.”
“But you never told us that!” shrieked Hermione. She pulled her handbag toward her and began rummaging for the sheet of notes they had been keeping over the past few weeks.
“I would never want to be with anyone but you,” she told him, stroking his face with her free hand. She laughed slightly hysterically as she held him, pressing kisses to his face. “Merlin, I – you
“Okay. Good. Brilliant,” Harry said, turning his attention back to the professor, a small smile spreading across his face.
“I don’t think I can deal with Blaise’s melodramatics tonight,” Theo said. “Care to join me for a drink, Draco?”
“Because honestly, this place will most likely be one of the first places the Death Eaters look for us,” she explained. “And it doesn’t have a Fidelius Charm on it – but Grimmauld does.”
Sarah’s stomach dropped horribly as Hermione reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside down, and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of Harry’s faithful, finally beaten broomstick.
Sarah spun to see Dolohov making the same slashing movement that caused Hermione to collapse, she went to jump out of the way just as Harry yelled, “
!” Lyra screamed, pushing her way through the fighting crowd, spells and dust raining around her. “DRACO!”
The Valentine’s Day Hogsmeade visit dawned sunny and frigid. The bite of winter still hadn’t dissipated, so everyone bundled up in heavy cloaks and gloves, clutching partner’s hands tightly in hope of stealing some extra warmth. One thing that Sarah was eternally grateful for was the fact that Fred was practically a human furnace. She burrowed deeper into his side and sighed happily when she immediately began to warm up. Sarah knew it was sappy, but she had stolen one of his beanies this morning. Seeing the look on his face when she had put it on had been totally worth it.
“It is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter-House Quidditch Cup will not take place this year.”
Katie’s nose was bleeding. Down in the stands, the Slytherins around Sarah and Draco were stamping their feet and jeering. Fred and George converged on Katie.
Rosie stood up from the desk and brushed off non-existent lint from her dress, which was an explosion of colourful flowers.
“Mmm night Harry,” Draco murmured. His hand came out of the covers briefly to brush against Harry’s wrist before he turned away, a small smile on his face.
Draco nodded and let her talk, knowing that she needed to get the thoughts out before they overwhelmed her.
Sarah opened her eyes and was dazzled by gold and green; she had no idea what had happened, she only knew that she was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs. Struggling to draw breath into lungs that felt flattened, she blinked and realised that the gaudy glare was sunlight streaming through a canopy of leaves far above him. Then an object twitched close to her face. She pushed herself onto her hands and knees, ready to face some small, fierce creature, but saw that the object was Harry’s foot. Looking around, Sarah saw that they all were lying on a forest floor, apparently alone.
Harry resisted the urge to say, ‘I told you so’, and instead helped Draco into the bottoms. With a thankful smile, Draco curled up under the covers and got comfortable.
Lyra jumped up beside Draco on the bed. He wrapped an arm around her in greeting, shooting her a confused look. She shrugged and turned back to the Professors.
At that moment, a stray Bludger mishit from one of the candidates flew passed Sarah’s ear and smashed into the locker room wall.
“Blimey,” said Ron, shaking his head and sending water everywhere, “if that keeps up the lake’s going to overflow. I’m soak – ARRGH!”
Shouts caught Sarah’s attention as Hagrid dived into his house, ripping to door off its hinges. Suddenly, Harry appeared beside her.
“Now, Harry – Sarah mentioned to me that you have nearly finished your work on your parent’s house at Godric’s Hollow?” she said. “I would love to see it once you’ve finished. Draco has spoken more highly about your skills.”
Hermione stood in front of her and cut Mr Diggory off. “Can’t you see she’s terrified? Give her some space to recover before you attack her!” snapped Hermione, crossing her arms tightly across her chest.
A chink of soft golden light hit their feet and, widening, rose up their bodies. Sarah dug her wand out of pocket and held it as securely as she could in the close confines. The Atrium seemed completely empty; the light was dimmer than it had been by day. There were no fires burning the mantelpieces set into the walls, but she saw the lift slid smoothly to a halt that the golden symbols continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling.
“Yep,” Harry stated with a large smile. He pointed at what was labelled the ‘turbines’. “These help give the plane enough power to lift off the ground while the wings,” he pointed at the two long pieces that stuck out of the side of the body, “help it glide through the air.”
Sarah awoke very suddenly on Christmas Day to Harry’s shout of surprise. She and Draco had camped out in the Gryffindor boy’s room the night before. Draco sat up in Harry’s bed, his hair a mess and his expression startled.
“Due to you having direct contact with assumed or confirmed Death Eaters, the teachers and I have thought it prudent to offer our assistance however we may,” Dumbledore continued. “We are aware that you four do not share the same views as your parents, which could potentially cause issues in the future. We are also aware of the threats you have been getting from your father, Miss Deaumont.”
“That’s great, Pans,” Draco said, smiling up at the girl. He knew that working in magical law was the girl’s biggest dream. “What about you, Blaise?”
The faces around him displayed nothing but shock; he might have announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms.
“You’re the Deaumont child aren’t you?” she said. “Yes, I can see the resemblance now. You look very similar to your mother. Shame she married your father – she was an excellent witch. Much like my son and his wife, they mentioned her quite frequently.”
Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Sarah, Draco, Ron, Harry and Hermione backed, as quickly as possible, down the nearest side street and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying along the street from the Death Eater’s searching wands.
George began telling the others about how Bagman had cheated him and Fred out of their World Cup bet as they played a round of Snap.
She could tell that something was very wrong. The noises in the campsite had changed. The singing had stopped. She could hear screams and the sound of people running.
“I’m so glad you’re here! I have to show you the chickens outside – I think one might be sick but you’re a doctor! You can fix them up! Oh, and Victoire and I were playing by the pond again and we didn’t even fall in. How good is that? Are you coming back to our house with us or do you have to do to the clinic? Can I come to the clinic with you? I want to see Simon again. Is Rosie working because you’re here? I like Rosie, she’s always so bright unlike
, Draco,” Sarah asserted. “I know you think you have to follow your father’s orders and be the perfect pureblood heir. But you
“Good, you’re both here,” she said tensely. “I’m going to get the others. You’ll all be leaving tonight. Remus is expecting you. Your trunks will be sent along soon.”
Sirius’ nostrils flared. “I am Harry’s godfather and Remus is Sarah’s,” he said hotly. “They’ll be staying with
,” huffed Pansy. “But you owe me,” she said as she heaved herself off the bed. “Spend the night with Draco so that I can fuck Blaise in here.”
“Also, Sirius would murder you if he ever found out your had considered leaving,” Draco commented idly. “It was admittedly not one of your smartest ideas.”
“Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s their first duty to help Harry?” said Ron. “In that magazine of yours?”
“YOU! You were with them. What happened? Who did this to my son?” Amos Diggory shouted, advancing toward Sarah, tears highlighting the fire behind his eyes.
“Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practise the Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions – “
“It’s the Quidditch World Cup this year,” he said once he had settled. Harry’s face above him was slightly red but looked very pleased. “I know father’s going to get us tickets, Sarah. Can any of you go?”
“We should plan to leave the day after the wedding,” suggested Sarah. “There’s no point waiting any longer now that Harry’s seventeen.”
“Well – we thought it was a good idea,” Hermione said uncertainly, “I mean, even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets, there’s nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon, is there? But…well, if you don’t want to use them…”
Sarah and Draco rested against the wall opposite the door and chatted with Luna for a few minutes before Sarah got curious.
“Oh, I didn’t know you read,” Potter said, brightening slightly. “Are you looking for anything in particular?”
“I know that, love, trust me,” Draco said, reaching down to place a cool hand on her ankle. “But it doesn’t stop me from wanting to protect you.”
A shower of brilliantly coloured sweets fell into Harry’s lap. The boy in question just groaned lowly and rested his head on the polished wood of the table. Draco copied him, pushing away his empty plate.
“Something’s not right,” Draco said, a worried edge to his voice. “We shouldn’t be stopping in the middle of nowhere.”
“That’s what you get for not paying attention,” he said smugly. “Just be lucky the entire roof didn’t drop on your heads.”
“No,” said Harry. “You’ve had your go. You saved four. Ron saved five. Ron’s Keeper, he won it fair and square. Get out of my way.”
,” she said in a simpering voice. “Darling Theo couldn’t have picked a better place for our honeymoon.”
“You wound me, Draco,” Naomi said from across the table. “One would think you didn’t pick the majority of those out.”
“Hi,” said Harry, pushing Ron slightly to give Draco more room. “How’re you? You’re staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave.”
“You won’t have to,” Fred said. “And if he does go end up in the Minister’s Box, Draco, George and I won’t hesitate to push him over the edge.”
“Yeh can’ really remember who yeh are after a while. An’ yeh can’ see the point o’ livin’ at all. I used ter hope I’d jus’ die in me sleep…When they let me out, it was like bein’ born again, ev’ry thin’ came floodin’ back, it was the bes’ feelin’ in the world. Mind, the dementors weren’t keen on lettin’ me go.”
“Stop bullying me, I’m sensitive!” Blaise cried, dabbing at his eyes. “I have recently been discarded like used trash and my heart is hurting.”
A small and skinny wizard, completely bald but with a ginormous moustache, wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium, strode out onto the field. A silver whistle was protruding from under his moustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the other. Sarah watched closely through her Omnioculars as Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open – four balls burst into the air: scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers and the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch. With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the balls.
Harry had described Hufflepuff’s cup to them all, but if it was the other, unknown Horcrux that resided in this vault, they did not know what it looked like. She barely had time to glance around, however, before there was a muffled clunk from behind them: the door had reappeared, sealing them inside the vault, and they were plunged into total darkness.
“Well, I’m sure your Papa will figure something out,” Sarah said with a bemused glance at Remus, who rolled his eyes in return. “He’s a smart man.”
“A magician never reveals their secrets,” Rosie said mysteriously, walking backwards out of the office. “Go home!”
“I wish you didn’t need to be here in the first place,” he eventually murmured, careful of the potential ears lurking out in the darkness beyond the bars.
Harry stared at her in shock before turning to Draco, whose face was several shades paler than usual.
These words were greeted with jeers and applause from a lot of the Slytherins. Sarah scowled and tried to focus on the Quaffle but Zacharias Smith’s words still invaded her skull.
Sarah and Draco waited while Harry quickly changed behind the curtains surrounding his bed before exiting the ward.
Draco looked down at Lyra to see that she hadn’t stirred at all at the noise. He frowned and pressed a hand to her temple, startingly when he found her ice cold.
“And your house-elves cleaned up any mess we did make,” smirked Pansy. She was leaning against Millicent’s chest as the other girl rested against the window, a hand in Pansy’s dark bob. Sarah still couldn’t believe that they had gotten back together but apparently by Pansy jumping in to help Millicent fight her father, the two girls had made up.
Harry let out a relieved sigh and moved to stand behind Draco, one hand on the other boy’s shoulder.
Hermione and Sarah squealed in joy and Harry gripped Draco tighter and kissed the blond just as passionately.
Sarah moved quickly out of the way of the fireplaces and was soon joined by the others. Hermione was staring at the statue in barely disguised horror.
“But you’re too late,” said Harry. “You’ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took this wand from him.”
Lyra shook her head at him. “Honestly, Potter, you don’t give yourself enough credit. You’re a stellar guy, an awesome friend, not too shabby when you put in the effort. You actually have a working brain underneath that mess you call hair. And, believe it or not, you’re a walking piece of eye candy. If you weren’t bent, I definitely would have tried to sleep with you.”
“We’ve done most of the first floor,” Sarah mentioned, waving her fork in the air. “I think the bedrooms and main common areas would be a good place to start.”
“First or second years,” Sarah replied. “But I didn’t recognise them. And it wasn’t like that. It was like they were his minions or something.”
“Don’t worry, darling, I’m sure Daphne will be available tonight,” Sarah replied. “Or maybe you can get lucky with Jessibah after our meeting.”
“I’m guessing that by the way you failed so spectacularly at ignoring Mr Potter, that the two of you know each other?” Rosie said in an innocent tone that fooled no one. “One-night stand gone wrong? Jilted lovers?”
“Fine,” said Sarah, crossing her hands, “fine…let them see it. Give even more people access to a weapon primarily intended to go against the Ministry. Yes, that’s a very smart plan.”
“Why so moody, hun?” she asked him, linking their arms as they walked down the corridor toward the classroom Lyra had agreed to meet the Gryffindors in. “Don’t tell me you’ve got those Wrackspurt things Lovegood was talking about.”
“Aw, hun, I know you love my cuddles,” Sarah teased, dancing over to Draco and throwing herself bodily onto him. He grunted under her unexpected weight.
Her eyes flicked down briefly to Harry and Draco’s clasped hands and Sarah knew that tomorrow’s edition of the Prophet would be outing them to the world. Sarah only hoped that Narcissa would be able to restrain Lucius long enough to stop him from storming the castle.
“Strip it down?” repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad. Even Draco looked aghast at the idea.
The three of them spent an enjoyable afternoon lounging in the sun on the grounds, occasionally throwing various sweets at one another or just enjoying each other’s company.
“Ugh, can’t anyone have peace and quiet to sleep off a food coma?” Sarah grumbled, allowing herself to be pulled upright by Ginny, Teddy clutched to her chest.
Harry smiled widely at her. After another bout of silence, he cleared his throat and said, “You’re all welcome to stay as long as you need to. Kreacher can get some clothes for you from the Manor if you need?”
Sarah choked on her drink in surprise. “Of course, Harry,” she said, coughing. “You’re more than welcome whenever.”
it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shack's supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain – “
The last thing Draco saw was Potter’s green eyes staring at him regretfully before the Golden Trio was whisked away into nothingness.
Right now, all the seventh and eighth years were lounging outside in large groups around the lake, soaking up the sunshine after their final exams. Laughter and loud shouts echoed across the grounds from an impromptu game which Sarah hadn’t bothered to open her eyes to identify. She could hear Luna humming absently from where she was sitting braiding Draco’s hair, last Sarah had checked.
“Not necessarily,” Sarah opposed. “Magical diaries sometimes have the ability to only be read by the owner, or you may need a spell to unlock the entries – it’s a safety measure.”
Sarah’s eyes fell closed as he kissed her gently, sweetly. It was unhurried and soothing – a display of affection and comfort in a time of need.
He nodded shakily and hugged each of them, a flash interrupting halfway through his hug with Hermione. Draco shouted himself hoarse at Rita Skeeter invading the champions tent without permission and threatened to sue her if she published anything derogatory about Harry.
, poor chap. No cure at all. I said to him that I knew a werewolf personally, very nice man, who finds the condition quite easy to manage…”
She left before any of the others could argue and slowly hobbled down the staircase back into the kitchen. Bill, Fleur, Luna and Dean were sitting at the table, cups of tea in front of them. Fleur immediately jumped up to make Sarah a cup of her own as she gingerly lowered herself into the seat beside Dean.
“How has that been going?” Sarah asked, lying down on top of Draco’s chest and resting her chin on her folded arms.
“Class schedules,” Blaise announced as Sarah and Draco dropped into the seats beside him at breakfast. “I think they might’ve messed yours up though, you’ve got double lessons all week…”
“Sirius, relax,” Remus said, wiping sweat off his brow. “He’s just acting the way any elf would in a situation like this.”
She waited with her hand out until Harry had passed over the Horcrux, but instead of slipping it around her own neck, she dropped it into her jacket pocket.
She nodded in thanks and quickly ate before dragging Draco off to class. Pansy had Divination while Blaise and Theo had Arithmancy. Millicent would be joining them in Muggle Studies.
Lee wiggled a finger at her face and she was tempted to try to bite it. If they weren’t standing in the middle of a packed joke shop she might have done it.
“No!” she shouted, poking him in the chest. “You listen to me! You are one of the bravest, kindest men I know. You have been a father to me these last few years and I will never be able to express how grateful I am for that. But for you to stand here and tell me you want to leave your
“Well, I start bleeding like mad every time they try,” said Mr Weasley cheerfully, reaching across for his wand, which lay at his bedside, to summon them all chairs to sit on. “It seems there was some rather unusual kind of poison in that snake’s fangs that keeps the wounds open…They’re sure they’ll find the antidote, though, they say they’ve had much worse cases than mine, and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a Blood Replenishing Potion every hour. But that fellow over there,” he said, dropping his voice and nodding toward the bed opposite in which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling. “Bitten by a
! shook the walls as students catapulted out of their seats and into the corridors to determine the cause of the ruckus.
Professor McGonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to face the stunned crowd. She was white as chalk.
“I’ve always liked the twins,” she countered. “But I haven’t been able to get to know them as well as I hoped.”
Fred had admitted to her that various enchantments were being placed upon the Burrow, which meant they’d probably be moving into their soon. Sarah knew they’d have to be at the Burrow for Bill and Fleur’s wedding in a week and she was waiting for Remus and Sirius to come back from the latest meeting and tell them when they would be leaving.
“Have sweet dreams, Harry,” Draco said cheekily, leaning forward to nip Harry’s earlobe. “I know I’ll be thinking about you.”
Sarah had stopped going to the Gryffindor common room as much, as the trolls gave her flashbacks to first year and that wasn’t something she wanted to continually relive.
“Why were Harry and Ron drinking the mead anyway?” Sarah asked Madam Pomfrey as they checked Ron’s vitals.
“I’m glad that you’re taking your own lives into your hands,” Sarah told Fred as they lay next to each other under the covers. “I know that you and George will do great things.”
“Exactly,” smirked Pansy. “And the shameless slut can see what she’s missing out on. Goldstein’s cock has
As one, the Weasley boys stuffed their fingers into their ears, quickly followed by Harry and Draco. Sarah, however, began tugging on Draco’s arm. He turned to look at her and pulled his fingers out of his hears.
Filch’s expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly predictable; but why, Sarah wondered, watching him, did Crabbe look almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape, who was beside Slughorn, looking at Crabbe as though both angry and…was it possible?...a little afraid? Sarah was immediately intrigued.
“One thing I would like to know, though,” Hermione said, fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over Ron’s head. “How exactly did you find us tonight? That’s important. Once we know, we’ll be able to make sure we’re not visited by anyone else we don’t want to see.”
“Well, I agree with Ron,” said Hermione. “Awful old hypocrite, telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm out of it himself. And for heaven’s sake keep away from that horn.”
The news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day, but it did not cause the sensation that Katie’s attack had done. People seemed to think that it might have been an accident, given that he had been in the Potions master’s room at the time, and that as he had been given an antidote immediately there was no real harm done. In fact, the Gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, for many of them wanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played Chaser on the Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against Slytherin.
The Slytherin team, minus Sarah and Draco, roared and screamed with laughter. Ron, who had pelted toward the ground to catch the Quaffle before it landed, pulled out of the dive untidily, so that he slipped sideways on his broom, and returned to playing height, blushing. Sarah saw Fred and George exchange looks, but uncharacteristically neither of them said anything, for which she was grateful.
“That’s enough,” Mrs Weasley said suddenly, breaking Sarah out of her reverie. “Mad-Eye and Tonks are outside, Arthur, they want to come and see you. And you lot can come got wait outside,” she added to her children, Harry, Draco and Sarah. “You can come and say goodbye afterward. Go on…”
Sarah groaned as she looked miserably at the large stack of parchment and books sitting on the desk in front of her. Beside her, Harry barely managed to smother a laugh.
“We got on! WE GOT ON!” Sarah cried at dinner Friday night. She launched herself at Harry, who had been walking toward the Gryffindor table. He shouted and quickly caught her, staggering slightly under her sudden weight.
But Ron had grabbed Harry’s forearm and pulled the back of Harry’s hand up level with his eyes. There was a pause, during which he stared at the words carved into the skin, then he released Harry, looking sick.
Sarah couldn’t help it. A disbelieving laugh escaped her and a warmth began to blossom in her chest. She shook her head at Fred and pulled him close, her laugh slowly turning into renewed sobs. He just held her tightly and stroked her hair and back, letting her cry all over his robes.
“All right, then,” she muttered, stepping into the toilet and pulling the chain. The next moment, she was zooming down a short chute and emerging out of a fireplace into the Ministry of Magic.
“You are a very good brother, Draco.” The lilting voice beside him broke through the thick silence of the cell. Draco turned to see Luna Lovegood staring at him with her pale, luminous eyes. “Lyra is very lucky to have you as a twin.”
“Not really,” Viktor replied. “I had to travel back to Bulgaria and there vas another match just before term that I had to train for. I vas also visiting family.”
“Er – we don’t want any at the moment, thanks,” said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry, who asked, “Professor, should you be wandering around the corridors? Shouldn’t you be in a ward?”
Draco hummed and smirked. “Sarah’s never really been shy about these things,” he grinned. “Anyway, are you really going to say no to sex?”
“Here,” he said, and with a wave of his wand, he sent eleven full glasses soaring through the room to each of them, holding the twelfth aloft. “Mad-Eye.”
“Slughorn said he was meant to give the bottle to Dumbledore for Christmas,” Harry disagreed. “If the poison was in the bottle…”
Something in Ron’s voice must have unsettled Harry because he asked, “You do believe me, don’t you?”
The match became still faster, but more brutal. Volkov and Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the Irish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves; twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to break through their ranks; dodged the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria’s first goal.
“This place will be put under Fidelius after you leave,” Sirius interrupted. He held up a hand when Harry went to argue again. “It’s safer that way, pup. You’ll be safe at the Burrow with the Weasleys.”
When the four of them reached the Gryffindor portrait hole, they found Sir Cadogan enjoying a Christmas party with a couple of monks, several previous headmasters of Hogwarts, and his fat pony. He pushed up his visor and toasted them with a flagon of mead.
tell your mother you’ve been gambling,” Mr Weasley implored Fred and George as they all made their way slowly down the purple-carpeted stairs.
Harry had returned to the house cranky but smug. Apparently the Minister had thought it appropriate to ask Harry to become an ‘icon’ for the Ministry, making an appearance every now and then to show his support.
trilled Professor Umbridge. “Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which, after all, is what school is all about. Yes, Mr Malfoy?” she added, staring at Draco, whose hand had just shot up.
“I hope your bed is still as comfortable as I remember it to be,” she said as they pushed through the door to the dorm.
“Finch-Fletchley,” Sarah said without looking up from her work. “He’s muggleborn and probably thinks you’re the Heir of Slytherin, thanks to all the rumours.”
Harry and Ron were standing there, attracting a lot of attention. Lavender had attached herself to Ron and appeared to be currently attempting to snog his face off. Draco waved Harry over and the other boy gratefully walked toward them.
“Well, first you’re going to calm down,” Sarah said, pushing Harry into a seat in the deserted classroom. “You’re panicking.”
Sarah watched him with sad eyes. “It’s okay, love. If you’re not ready to talk about it, I won’t push it.”
Sarah snorted slightly at his botched explanation. Professor McGonagall’s lips twitched slightly as she surveyed him, then sniffed, walked around her desk, and held the door open for them.
“But you still did,” pressed Sarah. “Please, Professor, I can’t keep listening to myself scream as I find my mother dead over and
, kept letting off a high-pitched whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth, and a grubby-looking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved, and with each clang his head vibrated horrible, so that he had to seize himself by the ears and hold it steady.
Sarah stared at Harry in horror. He had never gone into details about what had happened the night Dumbledore died.
“It could help,” he continued. He began to gently trace shapes on her foot and ankle, the motion soothing. “You might find that talking to a professional helps you get better.”
Then the worst scream yet made Sarah look around. They were all waist-deep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view.
“Great,” Draco muttered miserably. “First he interferes with Quidditch and now he might be responsible for an unseen assailant going around Petrifying unsuspecting felines. Just perfect.”
Krum, his red robes shining with blood from his own nose, was rising gently into the air, his fist held high, a glint of gold in his hand.
All five of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult to stop. Sarah’s ribs aches, she felt light-headed with hunger, but she lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until her throat was raw.
Sarah ducked beneath arms and Bludgers and shot toward the far goal posts where Ron was hovering, looking ill. She really didn’t want to make him feel any worse but if she threw the game, Warrington would kill her.
The Gryffindors obviously felt as though they had already won the Quidditch Cup; the party went on all day and well into the night. Fred and George Weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of butterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of Honeydukes sweets. People kept coming up to Sarah and Draco and joking that if they still wanted to be let into Gryffindor, they better match sure they lose the next match. Sarah would just roll her eyes and drag Draco away before he could say anything offensive.
“No, it’s just Dobby,” Harry muttered, leaning comfortably next to Draco against his headboard. “Go back to sleep.”
“I’m thinking that I may be too tired for the party Seamus has planned for tonight,” he admitted, pulling a large platter of roast beef toward him.
And she strode past them all and sat down in the tent entrance, turning the action into a fierce full stop. Harry turned to Draco.
“As we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me and I couldn’t get rid of him, he was too strong, and he was still holding on when we arrived at Grimmauld Place, and then – well, I think he must have seen the door and thought we were stopping there, so he slackened his grip and I managed to shake him off and I brought us here instead!”
, oh, Saint Potter or whatever the fuck they call you – I was so sure your immense Gryffindorness would at least mean you’d have an
. If Voldemort really way possessing me then he would’ve found you all. He could’ve have sent your father after you, Draco! Or Sarah’s after her! Do you think I could’ve lived with that?”
“Well, there you have it, Severus,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Unless you are suggesting that Harry, Hermione and Draco are able to be in two places at once, I’m afraid I don’t see any point in troubling them further.”
He held out his arms and wrapped her in a hug as Dean hurried from the room. Harry turned to Neville, who looked uncomfortable and slightly embarrassed.
“I know, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall curtly. “We need to explain this to Professor Dumbledore.”
They turned to hurry up the marble staircase, with Harry belatedly removing his arm from around Draco.
“True, but unlikely,” Draco countered. “If a pureblood wanted to keep a diary, they’d make sure it was a magical one to protect their secrets.”
“You said Greyback attacked him?” Mr Weasley asked Professor McGonagall distractedly. “But he hadn’t transformed? So what does that mean? What will happen to Bill?”
“But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!” she said, lowering her hand very slightly and looking awestruck.
After Ron and Sarah had given messages to be passed along, Remus waved goodbye to them and left, the
The tethered dragon let out a roar and a gush of flame flew over the goblins: the wizards fled, doubled-up, back the way they had come. Harry screamed, “
Sarah nodded weakly and watched as the owl landed heavily in front of her, a letter clutched in its beak. It dropped it and hooted irritably at her. Pansy shooed it away and then gasped as she saw the red letter smoking on the table.
“He was a Death Eater,” Draco said, “my father mentioned him once. He joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave – so they killed him.”
Draco launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry. Neville overturned his desk in his anxiety to help; pointing his own wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried, “
Now, it was after dinner and Blaise still hadn’t left the hospital wing. Draco had promised to stay with him as long as he could, but Pomfrey wouldn’t risk everyone else staying.
“Harry – what’s going on?” asked Ginny, who looked frightened. “Professor McGonagall says you saw Dad hurt – “
“Of course not,” Lyra told the children quickly. “And I don’t want to hear about any of you searching for three-headed dogs, got it?”
“Don’t leave them,” he said in a serious tone. “You have the opportunity to have a family with Sirius. Don’t let that go. I know that my parents would have wanted nothing more than to see me grow up. Don’t let your child suffer the same way I did.”
“Please, you can’t escape that,” she drawled. “If I have to suffer, then you and Draco have to suffer too.”
Then there were the two large broom-shaped holes in Umbridge’s office door, through which Fred and George’s Cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters. Filch fitted a new door and removed Harry’s Firebolt to the dungeons, to Harry’s great annoyance. Umbridge’s troubles, however, were far from over.
“I cannot ‘elp you, darling,” trilled Fleur, calmly sorting through colour schemes. “Molly eez difficult sometimes.”
“Wands at the ready!” shouted Lockhart. “When I count to three, cast your charms to Disarm your opponents –
Not even a minute after Viktor had entered, a large group of giggling girls surged through the doors. Madam Pinch glowered at them but they ignored her, instead creeping further into the library to try to find seats closest to Viktor.
“Oh,” Harry said eloquently. He blinked a few times as Lyra looked at him fearfully. “It’s not an issue, Lyra, really,” he continued. “I was planning on telling him anyway. I don’t mind people knowing.”
The bang was like a cannon-blast and the golden flames that erupted between Voldemort and Harry, at the dead centre of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Lyra saw Voldemort’s green jet meet Harry’s own spell, saw the apparent Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air towards the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backwards, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upwards. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snake-like face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy’s shell.
“I was,” said Aberforth. “The Order of the Phoenix is finished. You-Know-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding themselves. It’ll never be safe for you here, Potter, he wants you too badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these four with you.” He jerked a thumb at Sarah, Draco, Ron and Hermione. “They’ll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows they’ve been working with you.”
“I ask you not to inquire into the circumstances of Sarah ending up alongside Harry and Cedric. All you need to know is that, due to unfortunate circumstances, she was transported to the same location as the others that night,” Dumbledore said, ignoring the harsh glare Sarah was sending his way.
“I mean, you’ve hardly wanted to spend time with me these past few months, why the sudden change of heart?” Ron elaborated.
“Just over a month,” Madam Pomfrey replied. “The Mandrakes were finally ready today and we’ve been treating all the patients.”
Sarah was forced to lie on her back on the dark wooden floors as Bellatrix knelt down beside her, a gleaming silver knife now in her hands.
“Your wand will do, Madam,” said the goblin. He held out a slightly trembling hand and in a dreadful blast of realisation, Sarah knew that the goblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrix’s wand had been stolen.
Draco said all of this very fast as they half-ran, half-walked through the corridors down to the Headmaster’s office. As they reached the entrance, the gargoyle leapt aside to reveal a harried Professor McGonagall.
“That’s lovely, Dolores,” she said, pointing at the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds of Umbridge’s blouse.
“Then, we’re going to clean you up so you like your magnificent self for dinner,” continued Sarah. “And we’re going to sit and eat and not think about any ex-girlfriends or horrid Ravenclaw man-whores.”
They hadn’t found anything regarding the Chamber and Draco had even gone as far as sending his mother a letter, asking her if she knew anything of it.
He gave Sarah a quick kiss before disappearing into the crowd. Viktor began to lead Sarah in a dance.
“He is a classmate of yours, no?” Voldemort continued. “From what I’ve heard, he has been causing you quite some trouble this year. Come, now, and rejoin your rightful place among us.”
“Harry,” said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forward, seizing the front of Harry’s robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes. “There are you…Ha ha ha…You look funny, Harry…You’re all messed up…”
Harry let out a laugh, a small part of him relaxing. “Ron, trust me mate, if I don’t have to worry about walking in and seeing your naked arse ever again, I could die happy.”
Percy and the other Weasleys were still staring at once another, frozen. Fred’s grip on Sarah’s hand had gotten so tight she feared she would start losing circulation.
“I guess this year is harder than the others, now that he doesn’t have anything hanging over it and distracting him,” Sarah said quietly.
Sarah just huffed. “Fred would perform better than any of you,” she declared. “And that’s all the details you’re getting.”
“Please, Pansy,” Blaise drawled. “If I had a Galleon for every time you threatened us and failed to deliver, I’d be richer than Draco.”
“Tonks had been teaching me some tricks,” she said. She pressed a kiss to Fred’s cheek and pulled back to see him staring at her in shock. “What?”
Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns, but they knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with Hagrid’s cooking.
“Harry, you left before anyone got the opportunity!” Sarah said in exasperation. “You didn’t look at anyone of us the entire trip back. How on earth were we meant to reassure you that we
Viktor sighed. “It is very annoying,” he said. “No matter how much I try, they vill alvays find me.”
Sarah let out a sigh of relief as she felt the Polyjuice Potion drain out of her system, causing her features to resume their normal details. Fred walked up next to her holding a crushed soda can.
He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front door open and close. They looked at each other.
“I’ve told her I’ll let her out when we get back to London,” said Hermione. “I’ve put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar, you see, so she can’t transform. And I’ve told her she’s to keep her quill to herself for a whole year. See if she can’t break the habit of writing horrible lies about people.”
They heard an uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted towards the castle, uttering loud war cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering round the side of the castle and yelled, “HAGGER!” His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort’s giants: they ran at Grawp like bull elephants, making the earth quake. Then came hooves, and the twangs of bows, and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke ranks, shouting their surprise. A flash of blond caught Sarah’s eye as Draco broke free of Sirius and ran towards Harry, who – who was
“I think you need to give them a chance,” Sarah said quietly, “instead of shooting them down…maybe?”
try and win, won’t you? Or we’ll be out of the running for the eighth year in a row, as Professor Snape was kind enough to remind me only last night…sorry, Deaumont….”
“Now, I want you to know that Harry, Ron and Hermione have explained everything to me,” she said briskly, “and you are more than welcome here. If you need anything at all, just let me know. Neither I nor my family will be holding your past against you. The important thing is that you’ve taken the step to something better.”
It turned out that Umbridge approved the Slytherin Quidditch team immediately but was dawdling with the Gryffindor team. Professor McGonagall eventually went to Dumbledore, an act that caused Umbridge to go into a fury. She was now inspecting classes with a dangerous air about her. It was only a matter of time before something went wrong.
Professor Dumbledore stood up at the staff table. The Great Hall, which in any case had been less noisy than it usually was at the Leaving Feast, became very quiet.
“Of course, I have identification,” snapped Sarah. “But I have never been asked for identification before!”
“Ah, he hasn’t lost his snappiness,” Blaise said dramatically, throwing a careless arm around Sarah’s shoulder. “Yet, somehow, I have missed it.”
Tonks turned to her, her brown eyes gleaming brightly. “I am,” she confirmed. She changed her hair back to its original pink.
!” snarled Snape. The class sat in shock, Snape never usually snapped at his Slytherins. “Well, well, well, I never thought I’d meet a third-year class who wouldn’t even recognise a werewolf when they saw one. I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very behind you all are…”
Emboldened by Sarah’s success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock. Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soon people were bowing nervously, all over the paddock. Harry and Draco joined Sarah in front of Buckbeak, both bowing before him respectfully.
People were cheering out in the entrance hall. They all swivelled around in their seats to see Angelina Johnson coming into the Hall, grinning in an embarrassed sort of way. A tall, black girl who played Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Angelina came over to them, sat down, and said, “Well, I’ve done it! Just put my name in!”
“Yes, that was a bit unfortunate,” she said with a slight smirk. “Luckily for me, he shaved it off immediately.”
“Do you know why we got cars?” Sarah asked Harry as they clambered into the enlarged internal space.
“Well, Flitwick got rid of Fred and George’s swamp,” Ginny said. “Although, he did leave a small section; said it was an ingenious piece of spellwork.”
“I did not like him very much at the Volrd Cup,” Viktor murmured. “I vas sure I saw him paying people vith Leprechaun gold.”
Sarah knew that Harry knew that Hermione meant well, but that didn’t stop him from being angry at her.
“I’m sorry,” Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself further to look at them, “but it feels like a – a jinx or something. Can’t we call him You-Know-Who – please?”
And seconds later Harry’s glasses had been rammed back on to his face. The Snatchers were closing in, now, peering at him.
She hesitated for a moment before looking at Harry briefly. He seemed to understand what she was thinking and nodded his head slightly in encouragement.
Lyra stood there shivering from fear and cold until she felt something heavy drape over her shoulders.
Fudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face. Dazed and blinking, he stared back at Dumbledore as if he couldn’t quite believe what he had just heard. He began to splutter, still goggling at Dumbledore.
“So, what are we doing here?” Draco asked, resting his elbow on Harry’s shoulder. “I’m guessing you don’t actually have anything for us to do?”
The girl’s pale eyes fluttered open. “Luna, stay with the others and help them out into the main room if you can. We have to go help Harry.” She nodded and Sarah ran away. Inwardly praying that Harry was still okay, Sarah jumped through the door that he had run through and felt the floor vanish –
Harry threw off the Invisibility Cloak as the Dementors came closer. Sarah left it up to her friends and lunged forward, grappling to tug the locket off Umbridge’s prone body. Three shouts of “
Charlie just let out a bark of laughter and ignored her. The others soon joined in laughing, except for Percy, who watched with an expression of disdain on his face.
“Hey Harry, what’s this stuff?” asked Dean. Harry began to explain the Dark Detectors so Sarah turned back to the blackboard. She had nearly finished the drawing of a toad in the bottom corner.
She stood suddenly, smoothing down her elegant robes. “It was lovely to see you all,” she stated regally. “I must be off. Have a good term. Draco, Sarah, behave yourselves. I expect regular letters.” She bent down and placed light kisses on both their foreheads before gliding off, a queen without a throne amongst the regular shoppers of Diagon Alley.
“Ronald, be nice,” chided Hermione. She turned to Lyra and Draco. “I’m glad you two are safe at least.”
“Why do you think I was so eager to leave?” he said, quirking an eyebrow. “Let’s just throw the lot out.”
“But why would you ask to come with us if you have a baby on the way?” Harry demanded. “You would just try to leave your partner and child?”
“Babe, I’d prefer you to suddenly remember something important like that than to not think about it at all,” Harry said, grinning and pulling Draco closer. “I love your genius moments.”
Harry shrugged. “I don’t think anyone else was there but Crouch seemed really weak – I don’t reckon he was up to stunning anyone, let alone Disapparating or anything.”
“All right,” he announced after a few more minutes of Teddy’s story, finally tearing his eyes away from the blond. “We have to get you off to school, Ted. And Draco and I have to go to work.”
“Draco, she’s your problem now,” Sirius announced to the startled blond. “She’s mortally offended me and I don’t know whether I shall ever recover.”
“So far we’ve only seen Professor McGonagall, Moody, Dumbledore and Kingsley Shacklebolt,” Draco added.
“Exactly like Da and Papa,” Sarah nodded. “Fred and I love each other very much. But that doesn’t make me love you any less.”
He put his arm around Sarah, who was still fuming but struggled to find the right words to fling at the redhead. It turned out Hermione, who had so far been silent with shock, was all they needed.
“And you,” she said in a serious tone, “be more careful with what you give people! If I hadn’t had the chew on me – which, by the way, was still a tester and may not have even worked – Katie would have lost even more blood and would’ve been worse off.”
“Phineas Nigellus?” he said hesitantly, looking over his shoulder at them. “Professor Black? Please could we talk to you for a moment?”
“Nothing,” Sarah gasped out, closing her eyes tightly as the blade pierced her skin. She bit her lip to stop from crying out as Bellatrix drew a ragged line down her arm.
Draco pouted slightly as Harry stepped away but dutifully waved his wand, sending his belongings into the small bag that Hermione had enchanted an undetectable extension charm on for him. Once he had finished, he turned to see Harry watching him with a small smile from his own bed.
“I’ve been waiting for you to come back,” said McLaggen. “Must’ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didn’t look like he’ll be fit for next week’s match.”
“I wonder,” said Professor McGonagall in a cold fury, turning on Professor Umbridge, “how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? You see, I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking.”
Lyra couldn’t help the snicker that broke out as the other eighth years began filing through the revealed doorway.
The fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school that afternoon. Though they caused plenty of disruption, particularly the firecrackers, the other teachers not seem to mind them very much.
“Every guest in this Hall,” said Dumbledore, his eyes lingered upon the Durmstrang students, “will be welcomed back here at any time, should they wish to come. I say to you all, once again – in the light of Lord Voldemort’s return, we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. Lord Voldemort’s gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust. Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open. It is my belief – and never have I so hoped that I am mistaken – that we are all facing dark and difficult times. Some of you in this Hall have already suffered directly at the hands of Lord Voldemort. Many of your families have been torn asunder. A week ago, a student was taken from our midst.” He paused again and surveyed the sombre students. “Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.”
“Well, as the village is named after him I assumed you had made the connection,” she said dryly. “There’s a bit about the village in
“Oooh, are we having a slumber party?” Pansy asked excitedly. Sarah blinked in shock as she registered that Pansy had her arm around Millicent’s shoulders, the other girl leaning into her side. “I’ll bring my face masks.”
They spent their last night of holidays eating snacks and telling stupid jokes in Sarah and Harry’s shared room. Eventually, they ran out of energy and collapsed in an exhausted heap on the large bed, limbs entangled everywhere.
“I’m sorry,” Harry blurted, spinning to face her. His green eyes bright and sincere. “I shouldn’t have said that to you. It’s no excuse but I was just so angry at Umbridge and McGonagall and Angelina and I took it out on you. I’m really sorry.” He looked at her hopefully but she remained silent. “Aren’t – aren’t you going to say anything?” he said after a minute of extended silence, his face falling slightly.
“Well, I’ll just fuck off then while you two eat each other’s faces, shall I?” Sarah said sarcastically, a broad smile on her face.
“Hello, Draco, Sarah,” Lucius’ said once he had stopped before them. “Minister, how are you? You remember Narcissa and Antonius Deaumont?”
“It was very soothing,” she replied with a smile. “Are there any hors d’oeuvres?” she asked, glancing toward the table laden with a certifiable buffet.
“Have you been enjoying the term, Luna?” Draco asked, tightening his fingers in Harry’s hair as the other boy struggled to cover up a laugh.
None of them had liked Scrimgeour but knowing that the man’s final act had been to protect Harry was shocking and yet gratifying.
Harry was struggling to comprehend it. He could go back to Hogwarts again. The place that had been his home for nearly seven years. But would he want to? With all the memories that still plagued the stones and hallways? Could he even stand to sit in the Great Hall knowing exactly where bodies had lain only a few months previously?
“Viktor, I don’t know how you stand them,” Draco commented, still pouring over the essay. He crossed out a large chunk and began writing edits underneath. Harry looked on slightly warily.
“No idea,” said Fred, frowning. “You don’t think he could have mixed up the glasses by mistake? Meaning to get you?”
! Your children got what they deserved. Filthy Mudbloods!” She added Bellatrix’s signature cackle and tried to ignore how sick it made her feel.
“There,” said Snape harshly. “There. The Dark Mark. It is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago, when it burned black, but you can still see it. Every Death Eater had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord. It was a means of distinguishing one another, and his means of summoning us to him. When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to disapparate, and apparate, instantly, at his side. This Mark has been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff’s too. Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the Mark burn. We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord’s vengeance. He betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold.”
“There’s a reason someone threw it away,” Sarah reasoned. “And why would anyone have any cause for holding onto a diary that’s fifty years old? It doesn’t make sense and I don’t trust it. Don’t write in it,
The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with stars, and below it the four long house tables were lines with dishevelled students, some in travelling cloaks, others in dressing gowns. Here and there shone the pearly-white figures of the school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead, was fixed upon Professor McGonagall, who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Hall. Behind her stood the remaining teachers, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the members of the Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight.
“That’s the spirit, Sarah,” he said brightly. He turned to Draco and held the boy’s silver gaze. “You’re an amazing player, Draco. There’s no one else I’d rather be versing.”
“I don’t fancy being mindless bigots the rest of our lives,” she replied wryly, slotting into Draco’s side and wrapping her arms around his torso. “Promise me you won’t change your mind and leave me.”
Once they had landed, Sarah pulled out a basket of food the house-elves had prepared. Inside was a selection of their favourite foods, including a giant treacle tart which Harry devoured instantaneously upon seeing it.
Hermione’s twitchiness was making it difficult for Sarah not to grab her own bag and compulsively check its contents. They gulped down their breakfast, then set off upstairs, Kreacher bowing them out and promising to have a steak-and-kidney pie ready for them when they returned. Draco muttered something incomprehensible to the elf before hurrying out of the room.
“Ignore him, Hermione,” Sarah said. She pushed Blaise further down the table when he tried to sit in between her and Hermione. “Blaise will flirt with anything that works. It’s amazing his dick hasn’t broken off already because he stuck it in the wrong place.”
She darted forward, sidestepped Seamus who tried to pass her a drink, and pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady. The corridor outside seemed to be deserted. A second later, the portrait swung open again and Harry and Draco stepped through, looking worried.
A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed, and the worst of it was, with Travers marching at what he believed to be Bellatrix’s side, there was no means for Sarah to communicate with Harry or the others. All too soon they arrived at the foot of the marble steps leading up the great bronze doors. As Griphook had already warned them, the liveried goblins who usually flanked the entrance had been replaced by two wizards, both of whom were clutching long, thin golden rods.
Draco managed to wrestle Sarah’s copy out of her hands and he read it quickly; his silver eyes turned hard like steel and his jaw tightened. He very calmly began shredding the paper to pieces.
“Unfortunately, no,” apologised Sarah. “We promised Andromeda we would go around to her place for dinner.”
“Apparently this is meant to be an early birthday celebration with everyone,” she whispered. “Remus is none too impressed.”
Ginny was staring at Sarah as though she had never seen her before; Neville, still choking for breath, was gazing at her too. Draco, however, was staring at her silently.
It was after that same meeting that Sarah and the other teenagers were allowed to finally meet some members of the Order. It turned out that a large majority of them had decided to stay for one of Mrs Weasley’s home-cooked dinners.
Harry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow. He looked wildly up and down the deserted corridor as Sarah crouched beside Justin and felt for a pulse. There was one, but it was very,
“You show spirit, and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very valuable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom.”
“You’ll have your potion, though!” she pressed. “And you must have a safe space you stay in. I’ll just stay out of the way. Or I’ll go to the Weasley’s for the full moon.
“Lemon drop!” she said. This was evidently a password because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind it split in two. Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward. As the trio stepped onto it, Sarah heard the wall thud closed behind them. They rose upward in circles, higher and higher – giving Sarah slight motion-sickness – until at last, she saw a gleaming oak door with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin.
near Pansy when she was threatening to disembowel Millicent two hours ago. I value my intestines where they are, darling.”
They spent the next hour or so tapping Ron’s small wireless with their hands, muttering random words in hopes of getting one right. Occasionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat dragon pox, and once, a few bars of ‘A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love’.
“And this is another promising pupil of mine!” cried Slughorn loudly, suddenly right in front of Sarah. She narrowly avoided being smacked by his waving hand as he indicated toward her. His red cheeks indicated that he had been enjoying the proffered drinks for a while. “Sarah Deaumont, such a bright mind! Sarah, this is Eldred Worple, I was just talking to him about Harry and Draco – “
“The reason I needed to talk to you was because Draco and I will need protection at the end of the year,” she stated, watching as his eyes widened slightly. “You can’t expect us to go home after we renounce the Dark Lord and ignore his task.”
Bill, Fleur and Luna brought them all steaming cups of tea as they waited for Draco and Harry to return to the house. The room was light-coloured, pretty, with a small fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace. Bill was quietly explaining what he had been doing in the last few hours when the two boys walked into the room.
“See, Hermione’s thought about that,” Ron confessed. “She’s sharing with Millicent Bulstrode and according to her, Lyra has been staying in Draco’s room so Zabini can stay with Parkinson. Hermione suggested that Lyra could move in with Bulstrode while you went into Draco’s room.”
“It’s decided then,” Sarah concluded with a smirk. “The Slytherins will teach the Gryffindor the elegance of ice-skating and the Gryffindor will inflict the crude nature of a snowball fight upon the Slytherins.”
“If she’d just get rid of that cat, I’d speak to her again!” Ron said angrily. “But she’s still sticking up for it! It’s a maniac, and she won’t hear a word against it! Neither do those two!”
“Dare,” he choked out without thinking. His eyes widened slightly in fear as he realised what she’d said.
“I wasn’t paying attention,” said Myrtle dramatically. “Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to
Draco broke away from Harry to free his wand arm. Sarah followed his lead and surreptitiously slid her wand into her hand.
“Yes, I’m aware,” Sarah said with a sigh. “Although, I would look out for any children Draco has – they’ll be a handful.”
“I’ll be less likely to walk in on you and Hermione again,” Harry said quickly. “I swear that took ten years off my life.”
“Where do you reckon the ring is not?” Sarah said quickly, cutting off Harry’s angry retort. “What did Dumbledore do with it after he broke it open?”
Sarah kissed Fred goodnight before following Harry and Draco into Harry’s dorm. Another mattress had appeared beside Harry’s bed, complete with pillows and blankets, and Sarah fell gratefully into it.
“No, you’re not,” Draco said softly, placing his hand between her shoulder blades. He looked around the common room helplessly and caught Harry’s eyes. The other boy looked down at Lyra’s slumped figure and raised his eyebrows in question. Draco contemplated his options for a split second before he called loudly, “Oi, Harry. Get over here, would you?”
They had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin had brought along a glass box containing a hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail and harmless-looking.
“Yet you have sustained heavy losses,” continued Voldemort. “If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and waste…Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat, immediately…You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured…I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, woman and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.”
“I’m going to show you just how much I’ve missed you,” murmured Fred, his hands running slowly up and down her body.
, others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests. The room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside, for many of the patients were making very particular noises. A sweaty-faced witch in the centre of the front row, who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the
“I’m happy I have, obviously,” he continued, not looking in her direction even though he could feel his eyes on her. “I just haven’t really had the opportunity to think about my future. I’m just still trying to learn how to deal with
Draco had appeared on the other side of the crowd and was watching the interaction with growing anger.
Mrs Weasley hesitated for a moment before puffing up again. “I can’t say that I fully agree with your decisions, no,” she said. “You have not exhibited the necessary requirements needed to take care of children.”
“Oh,” said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side. “Right. I’ll wait outside then, Headmaster.”
“Yeah, let’s go to Albania. Shouldn’t take more than an afternoon to search an entire country,” said Ron sarcastically.
By the time they got back to Gryffindor Tower, the moon had risen and the stars were twinkling gleefully down at them. Fred held Sarah’s hand the entire trip back, not even letting go when they crawled through the portrait hole.
“I was distracted!” Harry yelled frantically. “You can’t ask me to think when my dick is in your mouth.”
“Hermione, I don’t think that is going to help you get the boys back,” Draco commented lightly as they made their way to the Gryffindor stands. “If anything, it may make Ron angrier at you.”
“Didn’t you hear about that, Ted?” asked Dirk. “About the kids who tried to steal Gryffindor’s sword out of Snape’s office at Hogwarts?”
“Goodbye, lovelies,” she trilled, pulling Blaise toward the castle. “Draco, if you keep lying on the ground like a cretin you’ll get grass stains – whatever would your father think?” she said over her shoulder, directing a smirk toward the reclining boy.
Sarah had tried for days to figure out what Draco might have been hiding but he kept deflecting her, claiming that it was just nonsense that his father was sprouting. She knew better than to push him too hard, so she had dropped the issue. She suspected, however, that Harry’s problem was not so much with the information itself, but the fact that he believed Draco was keeping him in the dark.
“Well, they’re Apparating, aren’t they?” said Mrs Weasley, heaving the large pot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into bowls. “So they can have a bit of a lie-in.”
“Well, that was riveting,” Sarah said drily, toeing the prone boy. “I have no idea what you were trying to prove Smith, but you just earned yourself a shitload of trouble. Goodbye.”
Remus smiled tiredly at her. “I’ve been underground,” he said. “Almost literally. That’s why I haven’t been able to write.”
step one. I have to do it for a few weeks so that he gets used to my presence – isn’t that what you said?”
was Muggleborn, and therefore, you would be the last person to ever hurt anyone,” she huffed, squeezing her right hand and wincing slightly – slapping Ernie had hurt a lot more than she thought it would.
The one word echoed across the silent courtyard. Lyra was shaking like a leaf but she held her head high. Draco looked terrified.
“Harry, please tell me you haven’t written more than three-feet for this assignment,” Ron beseeched.
Fred gripped her tighter and said sternly but quietly, “Don’t say that, Sarah. You can’t compare your suffering to someone else’s. Yes, Harry went through something horrible but so did
Bill lead Mr Ollivander down the stairs a moment later. The wandmaker still looked exceptionally frail, and he clung to Bill’s arm as the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase.
They were right – for the second time, Lynch hit the ground with tremendous force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veela.
“I never knew that,” said Hermione, looking at Ron in surprise. “You’ve used spiders in Potions loads of times…”
Sarah and Draco hurried onto the revolving staircase and knocked on the oak door. It opened of its own accord and they entered to find Harry, Ron and Dumbledore waiting for them. Harry was pale and shaking, covered in a thin sheen of sweat. His green eyes were wild, darting all around the room in fear. Draco immediately went to his side and gripped his shoulders, whispering under his breath to the other boy.
Sarah had forgotten how excited Draco got for Quidditch matches; it was like a child in a candy store. His whole face was lit up with excitement, his grey eyes shining. Sarah caught Harry staring at Draco and winked at the dark-haired boy, who flushed and turned away in embarrassment.
“Do you want to talk to me about it?” he asked softly. “If not, that’s okay. I brought some hot chocolate.”
“Well, it got more difficult as time went on,” said Neville. “We lost Luna at Christmas and Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort of the leaders. The Carrows seemed to know I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming down on me hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year they’d chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off.”
“Thank, Merlin,” muttered Ron. “I really didn’t want to listen to another of Hermione’s rants about opening up about
“I couldn’t imagine my life without you,” he went on. “If I ever tried, I’d imagine it would be bleak and empty. You can’t understand the effect you have on me – I can’t help but smile every time I see you or hear your voice. Even after all this time, my heart still beats faster whenever you smile at me or give me a distracted touch, or kiss me. You are my entire world and you make my life so much better by just being in it. Which is why,” he let go of one of her hands and reached into his pocket, drawing out a small, black box. Sarah’s breath caught in her throat and she felt as if she would burst into tears at any second. Fred looked up at her, eyes shining, and opened the box to reveal a stunning thin golden band with a low set rose atop it, intricate leaves bordering it. Ruby and emerald glimmered happily in the golden light. “I want to ask whether you would give me everything and become my wife, my partner forever, the one person I know I will never have to be anyone but myself with.”
“Blimey, this is heavy,” said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands. “Open it, harry, go on! Let’s just see what’s inside it!”
“If you were interested,” she began, “I would be willing to take you on as my assistant. Merlin knows I need all the help I can get with you lot, especially you and your friends.”
“She doesn’t know,” said Ron, staring resentfully after Hermione. “She’s just trying to get us to talk to her again.”
“Oh, I forget to tell you,” Sarah said, suddenly remembering her conversation with Fred this morning. “Fred and I are moving into the Manor.”
“A few months,” Harry replied, darting a glance at Draco quickly. The blond was standing stiffly but was looking at Harry with that odd expression. “Draco helped Fluffy get better.”
“I wasn’t a very nice person when I was younger, Teddy,” Draco explained softly, answering the boy’s previous question. “And I got caught up with some bad people. I hurt some people, including Harry and the Weasleys.”
“Yeah, Potter,” Sarah teased, leaning over Draco to punch Harry lightly in the arm. “You’re stuck with us for the foreseeable future, I’m afraid.”
“Of course,” Sarah smiled. “It’s a good idea. We just have to be smart about how we ask Harry. And if we offer to support him instead of leaving him all alone to run it, then I don’t think we’ll have a problem.”
“Harry needs to know some facts, Molly,” Remus said during an argument about whether Harry could attend the meeting or not, “
“I hate it when she does that,” coughed Draco as they dusted themselves off in the Manor’s sitting room.
“Oh yes. It is a copy – an excellent copy, it is true – but it was Wizard-made. The original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only goblin-made armour possesses. Wherever the genuine sword of Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at Gringotts bank.”
Lyra saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds later, out of one of the castle’s shattered windows, something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half-light and landed in Voldemort’s hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled, empty and ragged: the Sorting Hat.
There was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville had tried to sit on Crookshanks. Sarah heard Hermione soothing the cat.
Harry finished dressing and Sarah pulled him from his room. The pair of them raced through the halls, passing startled students who were on their way down to the lake.
“Tut, tut, I don’t seem to have made much of an impression yet,” she said, smiling. “Well, we’ll just have to try again tomorrow evening, won’t we? You may go.”
“I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she wasn’t telling,” said George bitterly. “She just told me to shut up and get on with Transfiguring my raccoon.”
Blaise’s eyes lit up and he opened his mouth to make a presumably crude comment but Theo cut him off.
Draco groaned quietly behind her and dropped his head back against the tree trunk. Lyra turned her smirk towards the other two-thirds of the Golden Trio.
Draco shouted. Everyone paused and looked at him. He turned to look at Luna. “Luna, are there enough Thestrals for all of us?” The blond girl nodded. Apparently more had arrived without anyone realising, attracted by the scent of fresh blood. “Good, you and Harry can help us mount them and once everyone is ready, we can save Sirius.”
He rubbed his eyes and blinked sleepily up at his boyfriend, who seemed to have reverted back to his five-year-old self rather than sixteen.
“Oh god,” Draco groaned after one particularly skillful suck. He knew he shouldn’t be hooking up with a guy he’d just met but honestly, he’d had a stressful day and his own hand wasn’t going to cut it.
“It’s been coming on for a while,” said Percy, mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner of his travelling cloak. “But I had to find a way out and it’s not so easy at the Ministry, they’re imprisoning traitors all the time. I managed to make contact with Aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was going to make a fight of it, so here I am.”
Professor McGonagall nodded and hurried over to Sarah and her friends. “Come, we need to get her there as soon as possible.” Draco, Remus, Ron and Hermione didn’t argue and quickly turned, following Professor McGonagall briskly through the crowd which parted seamlessly for them. Draco kept a tight hold on Sarah and helped her whenever she stumbled.
“I haven’t said goodnight yet,” Draco whispered, eyes glancing down to Harry’s lips and then up to his eyes.
“There,” said Umbridge sweetly, “we’re getting better at controlling our temper already, aren’t we? Now, you are going to be doing some lines for me tonight. No, not with your quill,” she added, as Sarah and Harry bent down to grab their quills. “You’re going to be using a rather special one of mine. Here you are.”
Lyra smiled to herself and wound her way through the crowd. She hadn’t gotten very far when a loud thumping noise caught her ear.
He drew his wand and closed his eyes, stepping close to Harry to tap his wand lightly on the dark mess of curls. Immediately, it turned a light brown colour. Hermione gasped.
“You’ll always be a little snake to me,” Fred said with a soft smile, causing Sarah, for some unknown reason, to blush.
“He probably knows Sarah’s father,” Draco said, glancing at her. “Trust me, that’s enough for even Snape to be on her side.”
“Aw, and here I was thinking you’d be happy to see me,” pouted Sirius. Remus rolled his eyes fondly at him.
“I guess this is goodnight then,” he said, glancing up at his building. “I had a wonderful time, Harry.”
“And now,” roared Ludo Bagman’s voice, “kindly put your wands in the air…for the Irish National Team Mascots!”
“So far, Ron and Hermione have been asking variations of the same question – ‘Are you okay, Harry?’, ‘How are you feeling?’, ‘You know talking about it will really help’.”
“No,” Hermione said. “Only Harry, Hagrid, Kingsley, Mr Weasley and – and George.” Something in her voice made Sarah pause and pull back from Harry.
“Good lord, Arthur,” he said softly. “What did you have to sell to get seats in the Top Box? Surely your house wouldn’t have fetched this much?”
Draco hesitated for the smallest of seconds before sitting beside Harry, laying the bags in front of him.
“Draco! Draco, are you okay?” Sarah cried frantically, looking around for the distinctive blond hair. “I heard screaming. Is everyone all right?”
Hermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks. There was a flurry of rumour at her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course, everyone thought that she had been attacked. So many people filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around Hermione’s bed, to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry face.
“Harry, why would Cedric tell you to take a bath with it if he didn’t think something would happen?” Sarah asked reasonably.
There was still no sign of the boys once they were seated in the Great Hall and Sarah could see Hermione talking rapidly to the older Weasleys.
“I wonder what they’ve brought,” said Mr Weasley, leaning forward in his seat. “Aaah!” He suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes. “
have his head so far up his own arse is statistically impossible,” Sarah sighed, patting the blond on his arm.
“Oh, Sarah, Draco wanted me to tell you that Theo wants a dance. Something about Mistress Diablo?” Hermione added.
The words burst from Harry’s mouth and echoed through the graveyard. His green eyes cleared and he glared defiantly at Voldemort.
“I’m your boyfriend,” he said in a tone which indicated it should be obvious, “it’s practically in my job description.”
“She’ll definitely try,” Pansy replied. “I heard from mother that your mother has been in contact with the Greengrasses. Apparently, they’ve been looking for a husband for their youngest, Astoria. She was a few years behind us at Hogwarts.”
“It’s no use, Hermione,” Draco said. “Sarah and I already checked. It just mentions that the Chamber was opened once before and that it was supposedly connected to the founders. Other than that it was pretty useless.”
“So, darling, did you figure out your little epiphany?” she said brightly, closing the door tightly behind her. “Draco and Pans are downstairs talking about boys so I thought I ought to do my part and chat with you.”
“Is this true, Neville?” Mrs Longbottom said sharply, turning to her grandson. “Do you claim them as your friends?”
“Doesn’t matter,” Sarah declared. “We know where to go, so let's go. Bring your cloak as well, Harry. It’s nearly curfew.”
There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard.
Snape’s scowl deepened. “The Headmaster believes it is the best for Potter if I were to teach him. Trust me,” he added with a sneer in Harry’s direction, “it is the
“Sorry to break up your steamy snogfest,” she said unapologetically, “but a furious Potions professor may be coming this way at any moment and we should really
“No way!” Sarah argued. “We’re fine! Professor Lupin gave us chocolate on the train and we’re feeling much better.”
The feast passed abysmally slowly. The only interesting thing that happened was Dolores Umbridge interrupting Dumbledore’s speech and going on a Ministry-approved rant that left Sarah half-asleep on Blaise’s shoulder.
“And what good’s theory going to be in the real world?” said Harry loudly, his fist in the air again.
“Well, that doesn’t matter now,” said Harry forcefully, blinking quickly. “We won’t need to get out till we’ve found Sirius – “ He cut off and looked around at the doors.
“I don’t think there’ll be any more trouble, Minerva,” he said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking. “I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before I came down hard on him.”
Just as she was about to beg him to hurry up, his mouth disappeared from hers. Sarah opened her eyes and started to say, “Wha – ?”, when Fred dropped his head down, low, and the word turned into a strangled gasp.
“I don’t want that gold,” said Harry in an expressionless voice. “You have it. Anyone can have it. I shouldn’t have won it. It should’ve been Cedric’s.”
“You’ll be an excellent Healer one day, I know it,” he said earnestly. “I’ll be in great hands whenever an experiment goes wrong – “
Sarah cut off reading suddenly as she bumped into something in front of her. She dropped the large tome and immediately reached out to steady the person before her.
more person mentions my father, I swear I’ll hex them,” Sarah muttered under her breath to Draco, Harry, Hermione and Ron.
Sarah looked at him but he was looking at Neville, not the spider. Neville’s hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes wide and horrified. Sarah felt sick.
With a smug smile and hard kiss, Fred batted her hand away and instead moved further down her body, causing Sarah to groan in slight annoyance and then pleasure when his tongue probed at her entrance.
Mr Weasley’s Ford Anglia shuddered beneath them again and Sarah gripped Draco’s hand tighter. He winced and prised her fingers off his.
“I’m worried he may be rethinking this whole thing,” admitted Lyra. “I mean, you know how much he cares about his father – what if he doesn’t want to betray him?”
“The right to carry a wand,” said the goblin quietly, “has long been contested between wizards and goblins.”
“Bullshit,” he replied. “You’re shit at Potions. There’s no way you did better than Hermione, Sarah and me.”
“Impressive,” Harry said to the twins quietly, grinning. “Very impressive…You’ll put Dr Filibuster out of business, no problem…”
Sarah guessed that was a reference to the Extendable Ears Fred and George had been working on. They allowed the user to listen to conversations happening on the other side of a door or in another room. Mrs Weasley had gone on a rampage a few days ago and tried to uncover any of them that the twins had hidden.
Complete silence reigned over the corridor as the desolate group walked through the crowd of students, quickly followed by Professors McGonagall and Snape.
“Allow me to introduce you to the Mr Oblansk – Obalonsk – Mr  - well, he’s the Bulgarian Minister of Magic and he can’t understand a word I’m saying anyway, so never mind. And let’s see who else – you know Arthur Weasley, I daresay?”
“And he won’t start now,” said Sarah sternly. “Play as well as you usually do and don’t get hurt. If I see one of you not attached to your broom, I’ll kill you.”
“I know,” she agreed. “But I think this one was important. I think you should read it.” She peered up at his tired face, premature lines mixing with scars. “Sometimes, it isn’t always as it seems.”
Sarah laughed, choking on a mouthful of food before quickly washing it down with some water. She had never gotten used to the taste of pumpkin juice, despite Draco’s borderline obsession with the beverage.
As Sarah completed the constellation Orion on his chart, however, the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where she was standing, so that light spilt down the stone steps a little way across the lawn. Sarah ignored it and turned back to her nearly completed star chart. She only had a few more constellations to include and she would be done.
Tonks agreed and began to talk her through how she made some of her more complicated changes, sometimes demonstrating for Sarah. It was during one of those demonstrations that the rest of the Weasley’s walked in.
Harry’s head sagged and he nodded. “I’m sorry too. I didn’t mean to snap at you. I’m just – just so angry recently. Like the smallest thing can set me off and I don’t even know why.”
“Second one killed this term,” he explained. “it’s either foxes or a Blood-Suckin’ Bugbear, an’ I need the headmaster’s permission ter put a charm around the hen coop.”
