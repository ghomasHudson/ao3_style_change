‘There is a course?’ Draco lightened up with excitement. ‘And can anyone take it?’
- I know, Pans, I know. I have no idea what came over me, you know I don’t explode like that.
- I think we’d best not tell Normani that, handsome. – Draco forced a laugh. – From what I hear, she’s rather fond of you.
- he pushed his fingers deeper –
‘And why would you do that?’
‘I…’ Harry couldn’t think. ‘I didn’t do it! I told you, I was out! It wasn’t me!’
- It was Ron’s fault. – Harry was still looking at his (completely full, despite dinner going on for 10 minutes by then) plate.
Somehow (Harry failed to see the logic behind this particular chain reaction) it seemed that by the end of the day all was back to the state of affairs from before the War – it was once again Slytherin vs everyone else, and it seemed like the whole castle was now taking part in the division. Snide comments, that subsided since term started, were now back in full force, along with the pushing and shoving, booing after particularly vocal members of each house ensued, and Slytherins wasted no time in coming up with several degrading chants intended to let the whole student body know Harry Potter was gay for Draco Malfoy.
‘Theoretically, yes. But the moment it’s gone you’re in serious danger.’
- Yeah, because trying to make sure someone doesn’t die is a clear sign of being in love with them. – Draco scoffed. His friends were being even more annoying than before about it. He needed to put an end to this once and for all.
‘Hello, Dean’ Harry said courtly, grabbing Draco’s hand.
- Yeah, kind of. We didn’t have modern technology or anything.
‘You are. You’re in no state to be taken seriously and besides, you’re a suspected member of a scheme-running group, so you’ll need to testify.’
In the middle of the room three people were leaning over something covered by a white sheet. Harry blinked and in the dim light of the room he recognized Ron, his Auror partner Jenkins, and Roberts. He stood rooted to the spot, eyes glued to the three figures who, by the looks of it, haven’t spotted him yet – this can’t be good.
- You should be. – Draco’s words came out as a whisper. It was clear everyone in the room was terrified. Harry didn’t know if he was more afraid of Draco or angry at Ron. He put his hand on Draco’s shoulder. It seemed to snap the blonde back into the room, because the next thing he did was to turn around and go back to his own table, without looking at anyone.
- No, he usually just sticks to being a sarcastic jerk nowadays. – Zabini said. – How he acted towards you and your friends before the war was about as severe as he would go back then, if not for the occasional scheme to set someone up for detention, but even then, there was nothing to the extent of his blowup yesterday. Especially since after last year he seemed to be more subdued.
- You want more…? – He snarled in Harry’s ear. – You want me to touch you…?
Back in London, Draco was still spread over Harry’s couch, lost in thought. He knew he went too far for his own good last night, but he never expected this sort of behaviour from Potter, not after his immediate reaction. True, they were both drunk, but that has never stood in a way of honesty when it came to that sort of thing – in fact, it usually helped. So if Potter was okay with what they did last night, why would he do a complete 180 in the morning?
‘That is a road. We need to get to the other side to reach the Leaky Cauldron.’
By Monday it seemed like the whole school knew Potter and Malfoy were an item. Harry didn’t mind it in itself, but what was a little unnerving, was the fact that Ron knew the specific character of their relationship and given how he reacted, he might tell everyone. And for that, Harry just wasn’t ready yet. He didn’t know how Draco felt about it though – they didn’t discuss anything yet, they spent the afternoon merging their beds together (which was a task in itself, since apparently both of them had previously focused their energy on spells useful in duelling and no energy whatsoever was invested into household-related charms). By nightfall they were both exhausted – they had to put out two separate fires, then they accidentally vanished the somehow-king-sized-now bed completely (what else they were trying to achieve after their single ones were miraculously merged, Harry didn’t seem to recall), before finally giving in (not without pouting on Draco’s part) and enlisting Hermione to help.
‘I said
‘Harry…’ Draco had tears in his eyes. ‘I can’t let you do this. You’re too weak for this…’
(as he began to call it), it was obvious from the number of returning clients. And the second time Potter came to him, he chose Yasmine over Normani, so rationally, he must have been at least better than her. The evidence was compelling, it was all backed up by cold logic and reason – so why was he seemingly being burned from the inside ever since Potter blurted it out? If it was not shock, what was it? He already knew it was not love, this he figured out some time ago, and hatred didn’t fit well with his symptoms. Once again, he rationalized that it must be loneliness. It was perfect – he was completely alone in the world and the thought that he made someone else feel good enough to register it as the best sex of their life was just a reminder of the time he had those kinds of relationships. Any kind of relationships in fact.
‘Seriously? You were about to be sent to Azkaban for years for all you knew, and you were worried about me?’
‘What I mean is that even if Ron was right, and we were together, his attitude towards it makes no difference to me. I don’t select people I surround myself with on the basis of what Ron says about them.’
! They never just let go of power once they get it! Then, there is a small issue of
- We’re not idiots, Potter. What the bloody fuck is going on anyway? If you’re here than what was that? – Dean looked just as confused as Seamus did.
- Stop! Do you want to blow us all up? – He sounded concerned.
- I’m sure.
As he made his way there, his frustration only rose. What else was there in store for him? It’s bad enough he’d have to endure the (very unwelcome in his current state of mind) company of the other houses’ students practically 24/7. How far did exactly McGonagall go with her “sunshine and roses” approach? If he actually listened to her start-of-term speech he might know, but his mind was elsewhere. In fact, it was elsewhere for months now. He was drained, tired, scared (although he tried with all the willpower he had left to push that last one out of his mind – Malfoys don’t get scared, he reminded himself constantly, and after all, he WAS still a Malfoy, even if stripped of all recognition of everything this name used to mean) – he tried to convince himself for all this time that it was just difficult to adjust to the world without the Dark Lord, but if he was really honest with himself he’d see that his state of mind started much earlier, at the beginning of his 6
- So you’re the one that ended it? From the way you’ve been acting I thought you’ve been dumped.
- Yeah mate, are you all right? You look like you’re about to hex us all – Ron, in turn, had fear written all over his face.
years. He sighed and turned around – it was no use standing there like an idiot, he was now forced to spend his time in the new, 8
- Sorry?! After all he’s done?! – Wesley almost shouted. It was clear that he didn’t believe what he was hearing.
‘What happened?’ Harry jumped to his feet.
‘Hi, Ron! Why are you home? Weren’t you supposed to be in the office?’ Hermione was reading the
‘What?’
‘No, it doesn’t. Can you tell me what’s going on? How’s Harry? What happened?’ Questions were swirling in his mind.
‘Don’t say it’s Lucius…’ Harry was terrified. ‘Please, for the love of Merlin,
‘You can’t be sure!’ He was rising up from his bed, fuelled by increasing anger. ‘God knows what that shit was – it could’ve been Voldemort’s own invention for all we know!’
- Oh, I am. I’m just not into as heavy stuff as Draco is. – How he managed to state that so matter-of-factly, Harry had no idea.
‘Later.’
The article went on, but Harry couldn’t stand a single word more. He crumpled up the newspaper and threw it in the fire.
‘What do you mean?’
‘Yeah, sure, obviously. Clearly if you say so, then I’m wrong.
‘But… but why?’
! This is a death trap! Why would they let people on a train that has holes?! We’re all going to die!’ They were lucky it was only them in the compartment, because Draco was screaming at this point.
‘I always hated that thing…’ Draco muttered, following Harry’s gaze up ‘it’s preposterous, but my mother insisted it stayed.’
Draco didn’t think. He just saw Harry’s face go blank after what Thomas said and all rationality flew out of him in an instant. He couldn’t bear his boyfriend being spoken to like that. It wasn’t even important that Thomas was talking about one thing Draco loathed and wished he could rip off of himself, all that mattered in that moment was that he needed to stop that bloody piece of garbage from hurting Harry anymore. He vaguely registered Pansy screaming “Draco, don’t!” and just like that, he was on top of Thomas, his right knee at his throat, keeping the Gryffindor firmly on the floor of the common room. Draco reached for his wand and pointed it at Thomas’ face.
‘Exactly.’
‘We’re moving into Grimmauld Place.’ Harry smiled. It was good to have Ginny back on their side. ‘And really, we haven’t even thought about all that yet, we need to get our work situation sorted out first.’
‘Because I told you I love you, you know it’s true, there’s no way to undo what I did, and you have no feelings for me. And you’re too much of a good person to just leave after what I said, because you’ll think I’ll hurt myself, so you’ll stay here to make sure I don’t, even if it’s the last thing you want.’
‘All of it. I work from home now, so all the paperwork is there. Draco’s actually been helping us, well, me, figure it out.’
- Are you completely sure? It might be uncomfortable at first, it might even hurt, and you’ve had a lot of firsts tonight.
‘Talking to Granger.’ Draco got serious.
‘Oh God, are you ok?’ Harry immediately fell to his knees beside him – Draco’s face was twisted in pain, his right wrist covered in nasty, blistering burn marks. Harry couldn’t see properly in the faint
- He WAS my best friend. Until he started hanging around that wanker! Didn’t you see what they did to Dean? What his BOYFRIEND – Ron twisted his face at the mention. – Did to Dean?!
He was in the middle of kicking himself mentally (for the third time that day) for allowing himself to go there (
‘And your idea of
‘See those stripes on the ground? And those signs by the side? That’s how they know where the lanes are and which goes where. There is a whole course in Muggle driving, you need to pass an exam and get a special permission to go on the road. It’s surprisingly safe if you follow the rules.’
It took nearly a minute for it to strike him what the implications of that last thought were. If Potter dying meant that the war accomplished nothing, that would mean that – from his own perspective – the object of the war was not to defeat the Dark Lord but to keep Potter alive. But why would he care about that? Draco sighed audibly. Maybe his friends weren’t all that wrong after all? Maybe there was something there?
- And how do I do that?
- Pansy, don’t go spilling Draco’s history to his boyfriend! – Nott tried to shush her.
what you’re focusing on now, Draco?’ He didn’t sound annoyed, more amused rather. ‘I’ve got my secrets, baby…’
‘Minister…’ He started quietly ‘I realize how this looks, but I assure you, all the secret storage rooms I knew about have been already opened. I have no idea what they found or where, but I’ve seen the house being emptied and there was nothing left as far as I knew…’
a Death Eater, Potter, not
‘From what period of time, Minister?’ Draco looked calm and collected, but Harry could feel his hand trembling. He knew that if Minister asked for anything after the war, he could find out what Draco did in the Muggle world.
floor.
‘And what’s bad about it? Are you trying to shame me right now?’ Draco plucked the bottle from Harry’s hand and took a rather healthy gulp himself. ‘God, Potter, why do you drink this stuff? It’s disgusting!’
Draco turned Harry around and dropped to his knees. He didn’t have any sort of plan on how to approach this, he didn’t think Harry would want to do it that soon, especially after all they’ve done already, and he was never very good at readying his partners for sex, he was far too greedy and impatient for it. He decided to try and figure it out as they went along – his hope was Harry would give him some indication as to how far he was willing to go tonight. He closed his eyes and ran his tongue along his boyfriend’s split. He heard Harry moan and mutter “fuck” under his breath. He just started circling Harry’s hole with his tongue when another moan reached his ears.
- Yeah, I think it’s the best idea.
‘With…?’ Harry was trying to remain calm.
– it was all nothing compared to what he was feeling right now. It was like something was sucking his insides, all his blood and his soul out of his body.
‘You said so yourself, Minister, I have to keep an eye on him until he gives us his side of the story.’
- Hide what?
- You did. But whatever, what do you even want? I have no time for degenerates, so say what you have to say and go.
There was only one line, written in a thin, slanted script Harry thought was vaguely familiar, but he couldn’t quite place where he saw it:
No, there was none. It was just a coincidence.
‘Don’t worry, we’ll manage without it. Go find some fruit and we’ll have a fruit tart today.’ Harry decided to remain optimistic. Draco sighed and went to look for something that might be useful on top of their pie-turned-tart. He returned almost immediately holding up a bunch of bananas looking very pleased with himself.
- Of course. If you took hours our first time together, I’d think I wasn’t good enough for you.
‘But… But how? You’re dead! You… you killed yourself a year ago!’
That was it. All the hunger that was building in him for the last couple of months overtook Draco. There was no going back now, he couldn’t even think. He stood up, pressed his whole body to Harry’s and slid his hand down.
- Well, I don’t know much about the gay scene to be honest. But I suppose it isn’t that different from my work, so I can try. What do you want to know?
‘I don’t know…’ He was stalling. This was the question he didn’t want to answer. ‘I’m not exactly sure what my thought process was back then. Well, no, actually, I know what it was, but looking back on it, it makes no sense. You see, I assumed that if he was living there for some time and he didn’t kill himself, and then he ran into me and we had an argument, that would be the reason why. Because I had no other information about his life, other than what I knew from the time we met there, and that conversation wasn’t exactly friendly. We have a history of hating each other after all, that’s public knowledge.’
‘Mostly. They usually don’t live with the family like a house elf does, they come in let’s say once a week, or whatever you agree upon, they clean, you pay them for it and they leave.’
‘The case! Ron found the snatchers, they’re going to be interrogated today!’ Suddenly, he noticed Draco turned completely white. ‘What’s wrong?’
true if you think about it…’ Noticing Ron’s expression she quickly added: ‘But that doesn’t mean it’s your fault that he’s feeling some type of way about it! And drinking because of it!’
‘So I take it Weasley is not happy about my involvement?’ Draco asked, looking up from the papers.
- I never thought I’d say this, but for once in my life I’m agreeing with the insufferable bitch.
‘Lay down! You can’t get out of bed!’ Hermione was standing up from her chair.
- What’s up? – Zabini seemed friendly enough.
‘I…’ Ron looked at the pair, still on the floor, and Draco still very much naked, although in some wave of post-orgasm clarity he threw his t-shirt over his hips so he wasn’t entirely exposed. ‘WHAT THE FUCK?!’
‘Good to know.’ Ron sounded bitter. ‘Did you lie during your last trial at any point?’
- No? What am I then? What kind of person runs away from being an adult?
- He claims he’s not. There is going to be a time for interrogation, hopefully, now go! – Draco all but pushed her through the door and turned around to return to his room. Nott was looking at him curiously.
‘And where did each of you sleep?’
‘What? Where?’ He had to pull himself together, quickly, before he inevitably got hard again and Potter would notice something.
‘No idea what you’re talking about.’ Ron shrugged and left the room.
‘That’s no way to talk to your supervisor, Mr. Malfoy. You’ll need to learn to behave.’ Harry was laughing.
‘At first, yes. And then they have to observe their victim to make sure they got it right. They can’t accidentally approach any Muggles, can they?’ Draco’s mind was in full riddle-solving mode right now. He was really starting to enjoy doing this with Potter.
Now that he made up his mind, he only needed to figure out how to approach the task he has set for himself. Even in his own head, Draco refused to call it what it was – it was just a
‘That’s not what I asked. I asked how did you, let’s say,
- Oh, okay.
- And what happens if I don’t want to do something but they don’t accept it?
- It’s Potter. – His friends exchanged knowing looks. – He took some self-made concoction of potions and right now I’m not sure how he’s still alive after what he drank. I need one of you to go find Slughorn, give him the list of what Potter ingested and ask him to come up with something to help. I can’t do it on my own, obviously, and if he dies, as he will if we just leave him there, I’m going to get blamed for it.
- Talking to Ron. I wanted to ask him to keep this whole sub thing to himself since nobody knows about it.
‘I’m going to ignore the jabs at my intelligence, Malfoy, because this is actually a good idea.’ Potter all of a sudden looked slightly intimidated, like he was ashamed of something. ‘In fact, I had a sort of… brief thought…’ He hesitated ‘…nevermind.’
That was all it was. He just needed that one thing to fill the void and Potter was just there. He laughed bitterly. An hour ago he was sure he went through all the vices there were – yet, he forgot about that last one, the most powerful of them all. And he should’ve known better, after all his history was littered with mistakes like that and their consequences. And it was those consequences that made him decide that however much he thought he needed it, he was never going to actually act on it – he has proven time and time again that it was a bad idea when a guy was gay and there was no chance of seeing him again. When Potter was not only straight, but also in the same apartment, the outcome would be catastrophic.
‘Draco, let me have this one! It’s not every day your only child is about to become an independent adult and move out from under your care. Oh, that reminds me! Now that you’re about to be working citizens, you need new robes! Your school ones won’t be appropriate anymore, we need to go get you two some working-people-attire!’
‘They have more practice than you do apparently. Go stick your hand under some running water while I…’ Harry’s statement was interrupted by a sound of doors swinging open when Narcissa ran into the kitchen.
‘Unless…’ Potter looked like he had some strange idea that might work if it wasn’t too far-fetched. Draco knew this look all too well, it was the same look Potter had anytime he accused him of something back in Hogwarts.
happened before! It’s like an unofficial rule, the old Chief appoints a new one and there’s nobody in between!’
- You know him well?
They spent the evening in the kitchen, drinking wine and taking like they’ve all been friends for years, like the war never happened. Harry felt safe and happy, laughing along with Draco and his mother, demanding compromising stories from Draco’s childhood that made his boyfriend turn a rather alarming shade of tomato red and stomp off pretending to be mad.
If coming to terms with that he was actually feeling was difficult, having to deal with it now was even worse. If he didn’t know better, Draco would think he was lovesick – food was barely a necessity now, sleep was evading him, but worst of all, he grew to hate the sound of the running shower. It was idiotic, really, that hearing the stream of water hitting the glass doors and screeching of the old pipes (why would Potter choose to live in this dump anyway? He had a house, hell, he had enough money to get something that was at least built in this century!) gave him
It wasn’t that he regretted his decision to still help the blonde out with a job and a place to live, not by any means – he decided some time ago that even though there was no chance of the two of them ever having any sort of relationship (thanks to
‘No, not yet. I’m getting closer though. But I don’t know what to do with this tosser. We can’t just set him free before I find the rest…’
- Of course I do. You’re the most beautiful person I know. You don’t need to concern yourself with my needs, baby, take all the time you need.
‘Then it’s settled.’ Narcissa stated. ‘Harry, you’re applying to the Auror office, and Draco will try at St. Mungo’s. Oh boys, I’m so proud of you both… When did you even become old enough to think about your careers?’ Suddenly, she started crying with emotion.
- I never realized you cared for him. – He was back to that bemused, slightly superior tone of voice Harry loathed. - And my relationships with other people is none of your business. On that note, I think this discussion leads nowhere. If you’d excuse me, I’m going back to my book. Be so kind as to not attack me when you come back to OUR room, I’d rather not spend any time in the Hospital Wing, as far as I know Daley is there and he snores. – With that, he turned around and walked back. Harry could hear the door to their shared bedroom shutting behind him.
- You’re not so brave now, huh? – Draco was completely blinded by fury now. – Scared for your pathetic life? You should be. You want to talk to Harry like that? You want to know how it is to be with someone with a Dark Mark? I can show you right now… - It was like everything was in slow motion. He could feel all his anger collecting at the tips of his fingers, starting to form itself into a curse in his wand, when suddenly he felt someone twist his wrist from behind him. He turned around. Zabini was standing in front of him, panting, with Draco’s wand in his hand.
- Awesome, amazing, unbelievable. – Harry smiled.
- You know god damn well what you meant! And lay off us, ok? We’re not bothering you if YOU didn’t notice!
‘So you’re a doctor now? Give me a break, I puked once and it was after downing half of your vodka in under 10 minutes.’
‘Exactly. So what do I have to lose? There is nothing that keeps me here.’
- I’ve seen him. He’s in Muggle London and he’s not doing so good. He… - Harry hesitated. He didn’t know how to tell Ron exactly how bad was Malfoy’s situation without actually telling him what really happened. – he’s practically starving to death.
Harry laughed. ‘It’s just like Hogwarts Express, Draco, there’s one at the back of the carriage. You’ll manage on your own or do I need to come with you?’
‘Either you never had amazing sex, Potter, or women are overrated.’ The irritation in Draco was subsiding slowly. ‘Because in my experience you don’t just
As soon as Harry took his place, Neville looked at him slightly confused.
‘Honestly, that’s what I’m worried about. You know how you said that maybe being stuck with Malfoy will give him a chance to heal? Well, I think the healing went too far…’
‘It sure sounds like it.’ Draco emptied the bottle. ‘But if you’re curious, there you go.’
- Are you telling me you’re falling for him? Merlin’s beard, I knew you had a thing for blokes, but-… - Wesley was obviously so shocked he couldn’t find the words. - -but him?! Harry, mate, I’m sorry, but if you’re honestly telling me that you have feelings for- for this wanker, then I cannot support this. He is the most disgusting person we both know. And you should know this!
‘Herbs. That’s all you need to know. And to answer your inquiry, I don’t know who these people are, I don’t work with them.’
he muttered to himself, but it was no use. Now that this voice got there, there was no running away from it.
- No, I won’t. You’re in no position to tell me what to do. – Harry thought he saw Ron chuckle bitterly behind Dean’s back. – You’re both the same sort. No wonder you ended up whatever you two are. And to think I would’ve never imagined you of all people ending up with a Death Eater! Tell me, Potter, how does it feel to look at that thing on him every night when you know what his lot did? Or is it actually a turn on for you? You like looking at it? That what gets you off faster?
‘Don’t worry about Ron, I’ll handle him. And as for me being stuck here – well, we just have to make sure you give your side of the story before they do. Once we have your testimony, I’m free to leave you here.’
- Of course, sir! No problem! – That went better than expected. He didn’t have to beg, he just had to put in some work, he could do that.
- Some interesting choice of words there, Potter… - Malfoy looked way too pleased with himself for Harry’s taste.
‘So far I don’t see any grounds for a black eye…’
‘No wonder you were always this thin…’ Ron panted. ‘What was that, a million stairs?’
- I don’t know. I feel good though.
- So, I gather, you feel better performing than being performed on? – Draco was slightly amused with his boyfriend’s enthusiasm.
‘I found him in Scotland.’ Ron explained ‘You know, the swindle case? I have a feeling he might be a part of that.’
‘What?’ Harry heard Ron.
‘I don’t either. I have been looking at this thing for weeks now, it doesn’t make any sense!’
‘I suppose. But you’d have to learn a lot of stuff before you’re actually allowed behind the wheel. Now, let’s go find the Cauldron!’ Looking at Narcissa’s still worried expression, Harry realized he never actually explained how he was going to get them safely to the other side. ‘See those wide stripes going across the road? That’s where you cross. And those lights up there tell the drivers that they need to stop because people are coming through.’ They reached the crossing and Harry pointed out the pedestrian signal. ‘When that one turns green, the one above us, for the cars, will turn red. Red means stop, green means go, so we get a go ahead to cross while the drivers are told to stop and wait. It’s all connected and it happens automatically. Do you understand?’ Narcissa nodded, but she was still clutching Harry’s jacket fearfully.
- It’s not us I’m worried about, Harry. It might come as a surprise, but I don’t really need that much. I didn’t like blowing money on stupid things like my father did. All of those extravagant things I had he gave me, I never wanted them. But I’m worried about my mother, if father gets wind of the fact she’s supporting us, he’ll cut her off. She has it rough enough as it is, if she has no house and no money, she won’t survive.
The only logical conclusion Draco was able to reach was that Potter was, on some level, attracted to him, but at the same time he hated him too much to ever actually do anything about it. And that whisky must have dulled down the hatred considerably.
?’ She didn’t raise her voice but it was even worse that way. ‘You killed my fiancé and all you have to say is you’re sorry?’
‘Engineering. It’s a study of how various things are built and how they work, to put it simply.’
- Just trying to forget.
- You keep convincing yourself. For all I know, he didn’t even know it was you and didn’t want to risk his boss getting angry at him.
‘But what if they didn’t? What if they
‘Do we know how to fix this though?’
- As it happens, if I was trying to kill you, I’d just let you be. That little cocktail you so eagerly downed earlier today would’ve killed you by morning. What I “shoved” down your throat was Slughorn’s antidote.
‘What do you think you’re doing?!’ Potter was clearly furious.
‘I was afraid of losing you. I thought it’s better than nothing. I knew if I just moved out we would never see each other again, and that made me want to find that razor again.’
Longbottom came here to commit suicide because he was so ashamed of falling in love with your ex-girlfriend he couldn’t live with himself. Or was it Weasley that killed him? He was the one to find the body in the first place, so maybe he didn’t
‘What about me interests the Auror Office now?’ Malfoy was still completely unbothered by the sudden reunion as he took a hit from his clearly-not-cigarette and groaned with pleasure. ‘As you can see, I’m not bothering anyone.’
‘With what?’
‘How do you even know that? Your life is not over yet, maybe something will happen and it’ll all turn out for the better.’
- Oh, Mr. Potter! We haven’t seen you in a while! Everything ok?
‘Oh, but you must be mistaken my dear! They were certainly sure they’ve seen one of the You-Know-Who’s former allies camped out in the next village over! They said he has a Dark Mark! And after what they’ve told me, I’m sure I’ve seen this particular young man several times around here – you know, when I was picking up herbs in the fields – he most certainly lives somewhere close!’
‘Then why did you settle for this
So, I have elected to take a few creative liberties on the procedure in front of Wizengamot (I hope those don't bother you too much) - in case you wondered, it's based on real-life systems where those who investigate are the ones to prosecute the case (and so ask questions during the cas etc.).
- I do care about you still, you know? – Harry stepped into the room after Neville strategically retreated to the common room. – You don’t just throw 8 years of friendship out the window.
‘No, Malfoy junior. We had an argument in the office and it turned physical. Turns out, the git can throw a punch. Who would’ve thought?’ Ron gestured at his face.
‘And how exactly are you planning on achieving this ambitious goal?’ Draco was quickly getting irritated with Potter.
years again. It was all back to “Slytherin vs the rest” and people were looking up to me again, looking for me to be some sort of leader in this crusade against you and your housemates. And I started to panic and spiral again, that was the last thing I wanted coming back! I just wanted to be left alone for once, not to have “supporters”, not to even be looked at. – Harry realized he was starting to cry. He knew it was humiliating and stupid, but he couldn’t stop himself. – God, you must thing I’m a freak… Who doesn’t want to be the one in charge? Normal people look for this kind of recognition their whole lives, and I’m being handed all that and I don’t want it. Pathetic. – He couldn’t stop crying and talking.
And yet, the thought of it all made Draco’s hands shake uncontrollably. He was sitting there, on that bloody couch, razor in hand, and he was shaking like a leaf. He needed something to calm him down if this was to be a successful mission. He sighed and made his way to the kitchen – he knew Potter kept a couple of bottles of whisky and vodka in one of the cupboards. He selected what he knew to be some Slavic abomination that burned worse than Firewhisky on its way down, and poured himself a shot. God, it was disgusting! And what’s worse, it didn’t work at all. Shaking his head he concluded he needed more of it. He sat back down on the couch, looked suspiciously at the bottle and decided that shot glasses were too much of a hassle for his purposes. Throwing his head back, he took a couple of big gulps before nearly spitting it all out – he never liked Muggle alcohol. He waited a few minutes and decided it still wasn’t enough. He sighed again and braced himself for another go at the bottle. This time, when he was finished drinking, it was already half-empty. If this much alcohol in his system wouldn’t work, nothing will, he thought. But just as he arrived at that conclusion, something began rising inside him – and it wasn’t courage nor warmth he usually felt after drinking. Abandoning the vodka next to the razor on the table, he ran to the bathroom – if he was going to be sick, at least he would hurl into the toilet bowl.
‘Potter, how on Earth do you taste like cherries?’ He cocked his head to the side. ‘You’ve been drinking Firewhisky, not some liqueur…’
- Good… - It was clear Harry still had trouble coming back to reality. – Amazing… I’m sorry… - It made absolutely zero sense to Draco why his boyfriend would apologize after what they just did.
‘Well, there is one other option…’ Kingsley seemed hesitant. ‘I was hoping we would be able to avoid it, both because it’s less reliable than what we did, and because it might prove even more painful than revisiting your memories…’
- Yes, future. It’s not going to be easy, but I won’t let you go. And you can’t make me. You can try to break up with me all you want, but I’m not having any of it. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still scared, I still need to work things out in my head and frankly, your display with Theo tonight does bother me, but I’m willing to let go of all of this and start fresh. If we come up with some way to put it all behind us. Do you think we can do that?
‘And where do you plan to get it? It’s not exactly an over the counter thing.’ Ron was clearly terrified.
‘Did you talk about this case?’
- There’s nothing wrong with that, you know that? – Hermione didn’t seem to grasp what Harry was trying to say.
‘There is no relationship.’ Harry was desperately trying to not turn red at the mention of
‘Harry!’ Ron’s voice brought him back to reality. There was no time to waste – he ran through the door, shouting at Neville to watch over Draco, and began gathering as much of whatever was in there as he could. He didn’t even know what he was grabbing and where it was going, couldn’t hear anything that was going on behind him – all he could focus on was trying to get out of there and back to safety as soon as possible.
year, but now, after the war has ended, he wasn’t so sure anymore. He felt guilty enough about deaths he caused involuntarily and indirectly, how would he feel if he actually had to kill another human being on purpose? Wouldn’t that make him like Voldemort? No, he didn’t know what he wanted from life anymore. And now the “inter-house unity” (which he regarded as pure and utter bullshit on McGonagall’s part) only made the dream of some peace and quiet that much more unrealistic.
‘I’m not. Do you seriously think I’m going to have another go at killing myself because some Muggles were kissing?’
‘It’s a quote. From a Muggle TV series.’
‘Whew, that was intense…’ She whispered once the brick wall behind them was solid again. ‘I thought we were going to die out there, honestly. Harry, dear, thank you so much for getting us here safely.’
He had no idea if Potter bought his lame excuse, but that wasn’t what was important right now. He needed to take care of his
Draco could swear that over the groan of Weasley’s disappointment, he could hear Harry’s quiet, satisfied
‘No, it’s not what you take in school.’ Harry laughed ‘It’s a university course. Like, after you graduate school, you can go to a special teaching institution that offers sort of advanced courses and things. Different universities specialize in different things - you decide what you want to do for a job and then apply for the degree that will get you there. You can go for engineering, or medicine, or law and so on. You spend a few years there, studying only the subjects that would be useful in your job and then, when you graduate, you move on to work.’
- I wanted to touch you. You don’t like it? – Suddenly, Harry felt really stupid.
Draco moved to get up and go sleep on the couch, but Harry caught his wrist.
- Didn’t need to do what exactly? – Draco knew this was not going to be a pleasant conversation. Even though the Slytherins were clearly on his side during the argument, as soon as the four of them were alone, their faces changed.
‘How is your drinking habit my fault?’ Ron didn’t seem to understand what was going on.
‘My… my father? You want me to talk to Lucius?’ He was panicking. Ever since the end of the war him and Lucius weren’t even speaking – after Voldemort’s defeat Lucius shut off from everyone and Draco blamed himself for not being able to pull the family back together, and since the conviction he slowly grew to hate his father for what he put him and his mother through.
Sharp knock on the door tore Draco out of his thoughts. It was three months since he started pretending to be a Muggle and for the last two of those he spent half his time as a woman, a sex worker no least. If his parents knew where their only son was right now, they’d disown him – if there was anything left to be disowned from, that is. Hell, if anyone in the wizarding community knew Draco became Yasmine, there would be a scandal like there never was before – not that it made any difference, Draco was not welcome back no matter what he did or did not do, even though he still kept that one last glimmer of hope for returning to his rightful home alive through all the shit that was his life right now. But nothing stop those incessant thoughts that plagued him every waking hour. He was reduced to a glorified toy, forced to do whatever men who came to see him wanted him to do, just to not end up on the street. The fact that he, and only he, knew all those supposedly heterosexual men were really spending their nights with a male was not much of a consolation. He had no feelings whatsoever towards his clients, neither good nor bad, so the knowledge that he was deceiving them made no difference to his state of mind. He grunted and tried to brace himself for what was inevitably going to be yet another night of being used in every way imaginable. Jeanelle entered and informed him that in a couple of minutes he was going to have a client and that he needed to be on his best behaviour, since it was a regular of Normani’s and tended to spent astonishing amounts of money any time he visited the parlour.
‘Wizards normally don’t, but there is a chance for you if we implement Muggle technology…’ Hermione hesitated when she saw the confused expression on their faces. ‘It says in the books that the only way to reverse the damage is to replenish your blood with someone else’s. They say it’s best to use someone that loves you since this is the most positive feeling in itself and the people that love you tend to see the best in you.’
‘Wow, awesome! Congratulations! I’m going to the Auror office too, and Draco…’ He saddened. ‘Well, Draco is actually what I wanted to talk to you about.’
Do let me know what you think!
- Not directly, I know. But you asked if the idea of you taking charge of me sounded good because it was you or because I wanted anyone to do that and you were just there.
‘What?! But how?’ Harry jumped up.
- It means you’re ideal. No one can even come close to you. – Harry was placing small kisses on his neck as he spoke.
‘For your information, no. It’s actually the complete opposite. Although I don’t know why you would be interested.’
‘I haven’t, Minister.’
- No Hermione, let him talk. He clearly has things to say, better let him do it now so that I can go my way alone after this discussion is over.
‘You want Malfoy
‘As ready as I’ll ever be’ Draco smiled back and they went into the house ready to begin their new life together.
- Do you really want me to be the one to do that? Or is it just the idea that appeals to you? – He was hesitant, but he tried his best to word his concerns in a way that wouldn’t upset Harry.
‘But how? What was the argument?’
- Draco, what are you saying? – Harry didn’t even see his tears coming. – God, Draco, please, don’t tell me you’re about to say what I think you’re about to say… Please, don’t do it… We can work things out, we now know what we’re up against…
‘Oh my God…’ it came out barely audible. ‘Was… was it real? Did Harry die there?’ Draco was past the point of panic – it was something he never experienced before, like there was nothing left inside of him.
- That I can’t help you with. If you were a girl I’d say the trick is to be sensual and seem like every client is your first client of the day. And your looks would be a plus, this ethereal type is very popular, so you could capitalise off that. But that’s from my perspective, like I said, I don’t know what sells in the gay scene.
- You see, you and Hermione are the only ones that know what’s really going on between me and Draco. The rest only knows we’re together. So… - Harry hesitated. – So I would be thankful if you could just keep the details to yourself.
‘Shame.’
- Well, you could say that… - Draco didn’t want to have to invent a whole backstory for himself, but he realized he would have to. – I grew up in a very, uhm, sheltered community. I don’t really know much about Mu… modern London. – He hoped Mina wouldn’t notice his slip-up.
‘You… you’re not thinking about cutting yourself again, are you?’
‘Enough. You’ll be spending some time in holding, at least until I figure out if your alibi checks out.’ He stood up and left the room, gesturing for the guard to secure the door behind him.
- Is this why you’ve been picking fights with me?
‘So then I’ll do it. There is still time for me to get stronger, because Draco is not bleeding yet.’
‘What? I thought he was some deputy-something in the Department, not an Auror…’ Harry didn’t understand.
‘Since when do you care what I want?’
And so they went on. The Underground ride was uneventful, but when they got out of the station at Charing Cross Road (Draco having been considerably calmer on the escalator this time, although still not completely convinced he wasn’t going to end up wherever it was the steps went), Narcissa clutched Harry’s jacket in fright at the sight of the cars speeding by.
- Sorry mate, I just can’t think straight right now. I don’t know. Honestly, all I can picture right now is you on your knees in front of him and I don’t think I can even eat after that visual.
, that’s for one.’ Potter spat, clearly annoyed. ‘And for the other, those are not
So he decided he best laid low for now and he ended up in London, in his godfather’s home (he couldn’t really bring himself to call it his own – it would always belong to Sirius). He hasn’t been there since the fiasco at the Ministry at the beginning of this whole horcrux-hunting journey. He knew that Yaxley has seen the place, he suspected that he might be able to enter – and if he did, Merlin knows what fate would await Kreacher. He dreaded coming through the door, not knowing what he’ll find inside. But it was quiet. Nobody was there. It was like no one has seen the place since Sirius died, like he, Ron and Hermione weren’t ever there, like Kreacher never existed. It was somehow worse than if he would’ve found his body somewhere – at least then he would be sure what happened to his house elf and he could bury him (somehow, the idea of following the Black family tradition of mounting his head on the wall was not an option for Harry). But Kreacher had vanished and all Harry knew for sure (although he had no idea how he knew that) was that the elf never betrayed them, never spilled anything he heard while Harry was his master – and that realization made it even worse. Yet another death on his score card.
‘I know, but he’s a suspect!’
‘Calm down, dear, you need rest.’ She was pouring out some potion to give him. ‘It took our best healers three hours to get you to a reasonable state, we can’t have you undo this. Drink this, you’ll fall back asleep…’
- What the bloody fuck are you… - Nott was shocked. He didn’t have a chance to finish his question because Draco’s lips were suddenly on his own and all logic went out the window. Alcohol took over and seconds later they were both naked, Nott on top of Draco, pushing one finger inside him.
- That much is evident from your expression actually. Is it Malfoy? Is he acting up again?
form, because no matter what Draco tried to do with it, it refused to form a uniform ball like it was supposed to, and crumbled into several smaller ones.
‘I’ll manage to survive that responsibility.’ Draco smirked, but there was no bite to his words. Truth be told, he grew to like working with Potter on this – and it wasn’t only because it was keeping his mind off other things, although he wasn’t prepared to analyse any other reasons behind it.
- We work TOGETHER. I know there is no case right now. Tell me what’s going on!
‘What’s there to talk about? I don’t have a kink, I told you twice already, I just like strong, masculine guys. You know, the ‘muscles and a rough exterior’ type.’
- DO. NOT. EVEN. TALK. TO. ME. – Harry was back up on his feet facing Malfoy.
Since everyone was looking at them suspiciously as soon as they stepped out the common room 15 minutes later, Harry and Draco figured it’s no use trying to hide they were together. Draco took Harry’s hand in his own and they confidently marched down into the dungeons for potions. Even though they both felt safe together, they decided that they’re going to stick to their original potions’ partners for now, so Harry was working with Neville, while Draco sat with Pansy on the other side of a narrow space between the tables.
- Yeah, but you’re good with potions so that’s got to somehow translate into the kitchen!
It was already past midnight when Harry and Draco finally left the Auror Office. They had been going over Lucius’ information and setting a plan in place for a couple of hours, together with Kingsley, Ron and Neville, and, having finally established that the four Office employees would visit the Manor the following evening, after dark, all Draco and Harry had the energy to do was to apparate straight back to Harry’s apartment and collapse on his bed.
- For fuck’s sake, you know I’m annoyed with you hogging the bloody bathroom all morning! – Harry yelled in silence that fell on the room somewhere around the arse reference.
An hour later, he was walking alone, a couple shots of tequila in his system, when he decided to visit one of the places he used to frequent. He hasn’t been there in months, but tonight it felt like the place to be. He hailed a Muggle cab, gave the driver the address, and 10 minutes later he was greeted by the door by his favourite hostess.
‘Are you stoned right now?’
- No, I don’t know who’s there and I don’t know what it means. – Harry wasn’t even convincing himself, so convincing Pansy was out of the question.
‘Yes, sir.’ Ron nodded nervously.
‘Actually, there is one thing…’ Harry didn’t like the look in Draco’s eyes.
- You know, Wes… Ron, there might be something to it. – Draco said, visibly loosening. – But that doesn’t give you a right to go insulting my boyfriend like that, calling him a git!
‘God, Draco, I…’ Harry didn’t even care if anyone heard him, it was not important. All that he cared about was that Draco was hurting and he needed to do something, anything to stop it. ‘I didn’t know. I’m sorry… I’m so sorry…’ he was once again running his fingers on Draco’s back, holding him tightly. It took a while, but the blonde seemed to calm down enough to look at him.
Then, at the very edge of the grounds, they all stopped and turned around to look at the castle for the last time. They were standing in complete silence, looking at their home of the last 8 years and the sea of students still pouring out of the entrance. Suddenly, Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and turned to him.
- No, no, it’s not that. I’m just not ready yet to explain it to everyone. After how Ron reacted, I think there would be at least several more attitudes like that and I’m still in the process of figuring all of this for myself. Are you ok with this?
‘Didn’t even plan to. Although, now, that you gave me the idea…’ He didn’t finish that thought however, because the doors opened and a tiny wizard, that reminded Harry very much of Professor Flitwick, gestured for them to come inside. Harry gave Ron one last threatening look and sat down on the gallery while Ron took the prosecutorial stand. Draco sat on the chair in front of the high podium where the Minister for Magic was presiding over the proceedings, surrounded by about a dozen other witches and wizards. Ron’s pulpit was directly between them and Draco.
. It has just been announced that Lucius Malfoy has been employed as a high-ranking official in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
year? – Harry asked hesitantly.
Inter-house unity was absolute bullshit. Whatever was McGonagall’s reasoning behind forcing the 8th year students to abandon their houses and just form one group, was absolutely and unequivocally not thought through enough. „Abolishing barriers in order to promote solidarity and peace in the Wizarding World” – what and absolute load of crap. She should’ve known better that to assume after the war everything was going to run smoothly. And even more, she should’ve known that forcing people who stood on the opposite sides (even if only in each other’s perception of things) to „unite” and try to work things out for themselves was never going to work. Malfoy sneered to himself looking at the long piece of parchment nailed to the wall next to what used to be the entrance to the Slytherin common room. HIS common room, he realized bitterly, since younger Slytherins were still allowed to remain there – the “unity programme” only applied to 8
but someone Draco actually
‘Oh, well, thank you for your faith in me, my future husband!’ Harry was offended by the fact that Draco didn’t even seem to consider him as a character reference. ‘If they don’t take my word for you into consideration, they’re just stupid.’
- What did you tell him? – It was only now that Draco realised that he didn’t exactly want Slughorn to know it was Harry, although he didn’t know why.
your fault. If you haven’t come up with this ridiculous idea that he’s involved, Shacklebolt would’ve never decided to place him on house arrest and we wouldn’t be stuck here. Are you doing anything with the case anyway? It’s been ages!’
‘Not important, it was a long time ago. And you’d never say yes to this anyway.’ Potter turned red, like he realized he said to much.
‘There is nothing between us.’
By now Harry’s brain was as far from potions as possible. He didn’t even read the instructions before reaching for a vile of armadillo bile to add it to the cauldron, when a firm hand on his arm stopped him. He looked to the side. Draco was keeping his arm firmly in place.
‘Out. Can anyone tell me what the hell is going on?’
‘Because…’ Ron was clearly fighting the potion. ‘Because it hurt.’
‘Ok, but what does this have to do with the mark?’
for each other. Harry felt Draco’s hands slide down and squeeze his arse, almost painfully.
- I don’t even know if it’s what it is! All I know now is that I realized that my feelings for him have changed. I don’t hate him and I just want to know what it is I’m feeling. So, if you can find it in yourself to give me some advice on how to talk to him, I would appreciate it. But if not, I will just go to Hermione, she always has some sound advice. – Potter sounded defeated.
‘Because it’s Malfoy! He clearly cannot stay out of trouble and it’s rubbing off on you! You’re an Auror, Harry, you should be catching Death Eaters, not defending them! Ever since he came back you’re not yourself! You haven’t been in the office for months…’
since the end of the war. Why tonight?’
- Oh, if you’re sure then… But I still think it’s not a good option for you. It’s rough out there you know? I’m lucky enough to have a place to work, but most girls are just out on street corners. You’re too soft to survive this.
‘Well, then, without a wand that’s as much as we’re able to do. I must say, Mr. Malfoy, your situation presents quite the conundrum to the Wizengamot…’ He paused briefly and then addressed the rest of the witches and wizards ‘Distinguished judges, I feel I need to inform you of some very unusual circumstances in this case. As you know, Mr. Malfoy had been presumed dead some 18 months ago, on the basis of the words of Mr. Harry Potter, who just so happens to be Mr. Weasley’s partner in the Auror Office, and a would-be second prosecutorial representative in this trial. Now, I say ’would-be’ because the issue of Mr. Malfoy theoretically being dead is not the only problem in this case – given that Mr. Malfoy had no permanent residence of any sort, and at the time of his capture, as done by Mr. Weasley, the rest of the suspects were yet to be found, I had to place Mr. Malfoy on house arrest, to avoid him vanishing again, and what is more, I have decided that such house arrest would be held in Mr. Potter’s apartment. As the matters now stand, Mr. Malfoy has been living with Mr. Potter for quite some time now, so it seemed only appropriate, in my opinion, that Mr. Potter would be prohibited from questioning Mr. Malfoy. I do not find, however, any grounds for such prohibition in regards to the rest of the suspects. Now, do any of the distinguished judges have any objections to this decision?’ Nobody said anything. ‘Fine then, I find that Mr. Potter will resume his prosecutorial duties after this hearing is over. Are there any motions?’ This time, a rather sour-looking witch in the second row raised her hand. ‘Madame Kessley, yes, what’s the motion?’
- No buts, Draco. I know what I’m talking about. I felt amazing with you. The only thing that went wrong was the end and that is something we need to figure out for the future.
‘I was thinking Magical Accidents, there’s apparently a lot of stuff going on there all the time, so it sounds like a good place for me.’ Draco smiled. He was feeling truly happy and serene right now. ‘But I’m still debating.’
Neither of them registered Ron’s sneer that came from behind Harry’s back.
- RON! – Hermione couldn’t believe what she was hearing. – He’s your best friend! And something clearly happened! He’s alone right now, someone needs to talk to him before he does something to himself!
Harry spent the next few days in the same cell. Once or twice Malfoy stopped by to repeat the same questions over and over again, but nothing new ever came up, so Harry assumed the office didn’t find any more evidence against him. He figured this would be the case when the door opened on Friday night, but this time, instead of Malfoy, Ginny Weasley entered his cell.
‘Unless what?’ Draco had no idea what Potter was on about.
If he was honest with himself, Draco would see that his attitude towards Potter has changed. The hatred he was so used to was all gone and he’d been seeing it out of sheer stubbornness. It was almost like he convinced himself he hated Potter, when in fact the more time went by since the end of the war, the more he grew to care for him. He first noticed that during the summer, Potter was nowhere to be found. It was odd at first, but deep down, beneath all the loathing he thought he felt, he slowly started to realize how it must feel like with all the unwanted attention. After all, he was experiencing the same thing, even if for entirely different reasons. And if his instinct was correct, that would mean Potter never wanted any of that “glory” and “recognition”. And that, in turn, meant that he must be deep in the pits of hell by now.
‘Oh, come on, Draco, your mother hasn’t seen you in almost a year!’ Harry loosened. He didn’t want to admit it out loud, but ever since it was decided they were going to spend the summer with Narcissa, he was a little worried about how she would receive him. It was one thing to support her son’s relationship while they were miles away at Hogwarts, after all, but welcoming them into her home was a whole different cup of tea. But her reaction to their arrival gave Harry hope it would all be just fine.
‘Nothing. There’s nothing I can do. Even if I thought he was right, which I don’t by the way, you already know everything. So short of obliviating you, which would be entirely counterproductive, there isn’t anything I can do about it. Like it or not, we’re stuck in this together now.’
- Wait, Harry, are you sure? – Draco was panicking a little bit.
- Instinct? What are you talking about?
‘Yes, Minister.’
‘They do? Why didn’t you get one of those then?’
It felt like he was being ripped apart. He didn’t know if there was no time for lubrication spells or if Nott decided to oblige his pleading for pain, but it didn’t matter. All that mattered was his hands were bound above his head, Theodore’s hand was on the back of his neck keeping him in place and he was on his stomach, being stretched by his friend’s thick cock beyond what he ever felt before. It hurt so much he was seeing white and every muscle in his body was trying to make him get up and run, against what his drunk brain was telling him: “You’re getting what you deserve, you’ve earned this, you’re a monster and this is how you should be treated…”. He didn’t know if he was being pounded for seconds or hours, he completely lost track of time, he nearly blacked out from pain. At some point there might have been tears, but it made no difference to him. All his focus was on trying to keep breathing, but it seemed like an impossible task. He didn’t know where he was or who he was with anymore. He barely heard what the person said.
- Oh, I see. – Harry was looking at his half-eaten breakfast now. He suddenly wasn’t hungry anymore.
‘Are you sure about this?’
- Draco… Please… I’m… Begging… Please…
‘What are you doing here? Came to rub my nose in the fact that you’re a free man?’ It was evident that Lucius still hated him, possibly even more than before.
She scoffed. ‘Don’t lie to me. Neville told me you wanted to talk to him. That’s why he went. And he never came back.’
‘Maybe.’
‘What are you thinking about?’ Harry asked softly, pulling Draco out of his thoughts.
‘I don’t know. It would be a gross misconduct at best, sabotaging and conspiring at worst.’
‘Well, you buy it in an electronics store. It’s a store that sells household appliances, like cookers, microwaves, vacuums, washing machines…’ He added, noticing the Malfoys’ expressions. ‘But I doubt we could use it for ourselves. I don’t know if Grimmauld Place even has electricity, and besides, magic tends to interfere with Muggle technology – that’s why there is none of it at Hogwarts, even though having a cell phone could be kind of handy at times.’
- I do, Draco. This is actually why I wanted to talk to you. After that argument with Ron I started thinking and I know why I asked you that question yesterday. – Draco tensed. This was it. This was the moment he was going to find out that he needs to let go of his feelings and start rebuilding himself yet again. – I’m falling for you. Last night I wanted you to be with me because of you, not because I just needed someone.
connect Draco Malfoy and sex in any capacity? It wasn’t like they ever actually had sex – not on any practical or logical level. Yasmine was not Malfoy, she was a woman. Of course, for the first couple of months after Malfoy’s supposed death, Harry was plagued with nightmares of his last meeting with Yasmine, where Yasmine’s face suddenly turned into Malfoy’s, but it was only because of what happened after they were done – that much was evident from the second part of those dreams where Yasmine-Malfoy shot herself (himself? Harry didn’t even know anymore) in the head. Why this connection suddenly then? He worked through it, managed to rid himself of those nightmares, it was all behind him. Most days he didn’t even think about the memories that caused them – up until the point when bloody Draco Malfoy was back in his life once again. And now all the confusion and bottled up anger was seeping out of him again, doing things like this. He hated his own mind sometimes. He thought if he just tried hard enough to forget about all of it, to just focus on the fact that he had to deal with Malfoy being in his apartment, he would erase everything that happened over a year ago – like it wasn’t even real, like he dreamt it all, and like the reality was that Malfoy just ended up here solely because they needed him for a case and Shacklebolt was being a complete, unreasonable arsehole.
Neither Harry nor Draco knew how it happened, but was already June and their last year at Hogwarts was nearing an end. They’ve been so wrapped up in their new relationship that they didn’t even notice how the months flew by and before they knew it, they were leaving the Great Hall after their last exam ever. It was still 2 weeks to actually leaving the castle for the last time, but they weren’t going to have classes anymore, just a couple of sessions of job counselling with the heads of houses while they were waiting for their test results.
- I will make any noise I want to Malfoy, no matter how pleased or not you are with them.
, he thought, realizing that whatever happened back at the Manor must have not killed him, or he wouldn’t be there. Then, as soon as the idea that he was, in fact, still alive, sank in, everything else came back – slicing his forearm, opening the door and that horrible realization that everyone he ever loved or cared for, was no longer there. Was it real or was it all of it just in his head? He looked at his arms and screamed – his right wrist was still burned badly, but his other arm was what was worse: the cut he made was opened up, the skin at its edges looked like it was melting away. Did it mean that whatever he experienced, all the thoughts he had back in his old bedroom, were a reality? He didn’t have a chance to try and decipher this, because his scream alerted a nurse who was now rushing towards him.
Three days later the whole school was on the grounds, walking towards the platform in Hogsmeade to board the Hogwarts Express back to London. Harry was walking hand in hand with Draco, surrounded by Ron, Hermione, Pansy, Theo and Blaise. They were all talking and laughing, but Harry noticed Draco seemed distracted. He thought it must be difficult for him to be done with school and going back to his family home with his father not there, so he decided not to ask what was wrong in front of their friends.
‘As per Wizengamot Operation Decree – Amendment 23-101-A, prosecutor may be questioned as a witness in the case so long as he does not possess knowledge of any other testimonies given in front of the Wizengamot.’ The same small wizard that reminded Harry of Flitwick said. Harry was quickly growing to dislike him. ‘And so, as long as Mr. Potter is the first witness we hear, he can resume his normal role later on.’
- Oh, sorry Ron, I haven’t seen you there.
‘No, not the trigger, the appearance of the band itself. When they approached that old lady. It’s right there next to you.’ Draco moved to pick up the parchment, but Potter was faster – he was already standing behind him, reading and chewing on his bottom lip. ‘There, look!’ Draco vaguely registered that Potter was showing him something in the report, for all his concentration seemed to fade away with the feeling of Potter’s chest being pressed into his back.
It was a week since classes started. Harry wasn’t particularly happy about being forced to share a room with Malfoy of all people – not when Ron got to share with Neville and Seamus was roomed with Dean. In all fairness, he expected there to be a hex duel within the first hour, but to his surprise, Malfoy seemed different – more subdued perhaps? He didn’t know what it was, but really all that mattered was that the Slytherin kept to himself and didn’t bother him at all – in fact, Harry couldn’t recall a single word spoken to him when they were in the room. It was like living with a mute Hermione – Malfoy just laid on his bed for hours on end, reading advanced potions books. Harry was somehow grateful for it, but it didn’t stop him from asking McGonagall what was she thinking assigning them both to one room – the most secluded one at that.
Back in the room, once he realized Potter is still very much alive (is he seriously immortal like the gossip says? No, that can’t be it, he must have been just lucky to somehow find correct, non-lethal, proportions), Draco sighed with relief and sat down at the foot of Potter’s bed. Minutes went by and what Zabini said was replaying in Draco’s head over and over again. Was it really just his insistence to avoid Azkaban at all costs that led him to where he is now, or was there something more to the story? Draco finally managed to admit to himself that he did not in fact hate Potter, but did that mean he was falling in love? No, that’s too far. He simply cared about his well-being. He didn’t want the bloody Chosen One to die because that would mean the whole war was for nothing.
- I told you, I don’t know. It hurt like hell and that was all that mattered in the moment.
- took them out –
- Look, boy, I don’t know who do you take me for, but I’m not into – the man’s face twisted – your kind. I have a wife and I love her.
‘Hermione, slow down.’ Neville looked white as a sheet. ‘If he hasn’t lost any blood and he isn’t bleeding his soul out, how will someone else’s blood help?’
‘Gentlemen, I think that’s quite enough for now.’ Kingsley’s voice brought Harry back to Earth. ‘Mr. Potter, you’re excused. You’re free to remain in the courtroom, but you’re reminded you’re not allowed to ask any questions for now. Do we understand each other?’
‘Hello, Mrs. Wesley, are Ron and Hermione there by any chance?’
‘It doesn’t work like that.’ Ron remarked.
All effort was futile though. 10 minutes later Harry emerged from the bathroom still angry. It didn’t help that Malfoy still didn’t move his bloody trunk from directly under the window, like any considerate person would do, which effectively prevented Harry form opening it and checking how cold was it outside – they were having Herbology first, so it would be rather useful to know how many layers he needed on to survive in the greenhouse. But no, Malfoy didn’t care enough to think about anyone besides himself.
‘So you’re saying that the more this thing stays open the worst person I become?’ Draco was terrified.
‘You have went too far this time, mate…’
‘Jesus, we’re never going to get through this! Couldn’t they have at least analysed this before sending it over?’
‘What do you mean by ‘good’? Physically? Emotionally? I mean, everyone seems to think we’re… we’re
- Maybe if Your Highness decided to raise out of bed with the rest of us mortals, he wouldn’t have to wait for me to be done?
‘And where are you staying now?’ Arthur inquired.
‘Jesus fucking Christ…’ Draco groaned before he could stop himself.
Harry knew better than to argue any longer. There was no changing McGonagall’s mind, so he just nodded and left her office. On the way back to the common room he passed by a group of 3
‘Possibly. Shut the door behind you on your way out.’ Malfoy seemed thoroughly bored with the conversation.
What Harry regretted, however, was that he let his feelings show. He just desperately hoped that Draco wouldn’t figure out his expression when he inadvertently admitted that Draco
They were sitting on the living room floor, drinking Firewhisky and celebrating Draco’s acquittal, laughing like maniacs at Ron’s reaction to the verdict.
‘Suit yourself. I’ve gotten pretty decent at treating cuts over the years, but if you’d rather suffer just please, do it in silence. And don’t bleed all over the place – there’s some hydrogen peroxide in the cabinet.’
‘Harry, no!’ Draco looked at him horrified. ‘You can’t do this! You heard what she said, it’s dangerous!’
- Fuck you. – Came the muttered response.
- Yeah, but it’s more than that. It’s not just about sex. I’ve never even had a platonic relationship with a guy before and on top of that, I was only with Ginny for a couple of weeks and that was more like a friendship then anything. We kissed seriously only once.
he screamed at the couple ant shut the window.
- Whoa, I’m scared! Can you tell how scared I am? – Ron was back to mocking Draco and Harry’s patience was wearing thin.
Suddenly, Draco was on his back on the floor, Harry on top of him, both of them lost in their second kiss. It was hungrier, more desperate than the first one. When Harry’s tongue slid across his neck, Draco pulled away.
- I’M not paying attention?! Your bloody trunk is still in the middle of the room, you spent the last week annoying me on purpose and you’re the one that never thinks of anything besides their own arse! – Harry groaned internally. God, arse comment again?! What is going on?!
on the kitchen floor. By the time Potter woke up, he couldn’t take it anymore. He needed something, anything, to make it all go away. He briefly contemplated running away, just for the night, just to get to his stash of herbs left in Scotland to bring them back, but he realized that was not possible, not with all the protective enchantments surrounding the apartment. So, through all the pain and agony that filled his whole body, he tried to devise some other plan to just get some relief. When he saw, like through a thick fog, Potter standing above him, he knew he was a lost cause.
- Mal… Draco. – To all their surprise, Ron cleared his throat and spoke. – I think if you both love each other and want to be together, you should at least try and work it out. Merlin knows I’m not the biggest fan of this relationship, but it seems to me that I’ve got you two wrong from the start. I thought you were planning on being a… - He hesitated. - …boss of Harry of sorts, and I really didn’t like it. You know, I didn’t trust you. I still don’t completely, not after what you’ve done. But after tonight it seems to me that I was wrong. That you both were wrong in fact. You can’t control Harry, nobody can. The git never does what he’s told and it seems you trying to break up with him was no exception.
Harry couldn’t look at the scene. He looked at Draco standing next to him and saw him biting his lip, holding back tears. He unlaced their fingers, wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist and pulled him close – he didn’t even fight it, holding on to Harry tightly, burying his face in the crook of his neck. ‘It’s ok, you’re safe now, it’s just a memory…’ Harry whispered, gently running his fingers through the blonde hair ‘…he can’t hurt you anymore, he’s dead… I’m here, you’re safe… It’s all fine now, I’ll stay with you, I’ll keep you safe…’.
- Well, that’s rather obvious given what we’ve just heard, isn’t it? – Seamus looked like he was quickly starting to regret coming into the common room.
- Ron, I think you might be right. – Seamus joined in. – See how it’s “us” now? I think the bravest Gryffindor in Hogwarts just turned into the most traitorous Slytherin!
‘I have no idea. I thought at the time that maybe he wanted me to know he killed himself because I caused this.’
- And what might those things be, baby? – He pulled Harry closer.
- Future? – Draco looked up confused.
‘You heard?’
- Tell me what you want, baby, just tell me.
- Harry, mate, are you listening?!
The rest of them followed. When they gathered in Ron’s and Neville’s office, there was a pensive already on one of the desks. It was bigger than the one in Hogwarts and seemed older. Kingsley gestured for them to gather around and soon they were falling down to face Draco’s history.
‘Yes, dying. I’m just waiting to die at this point.’
- He was forced into it, you know it as well as I do.
- Hm, kind of. It’s not as simple as being ordered around by someone, it’s deeper. It’s a kind of relationship where you trust the other person completely to not hurt you so you just give them all control of you for some time. – Harry saw Ron scowl. – And besides, I don’t know if I want to have that kind of a relationship with Draco. Last night I did, but when he asked me if I was sure, I wasn’t.
- Baby, come on. Tell me.
‘Whatever. I have nothing to say to you or your Auror friends, I have done nothing wrong and I don’t know the people you’re after, so I’m no help at all.’
The room fell silent. Everyone was watching the trio with their jaws on the floor. It wasn’t exactly a secret that neither Harry nor Malfoy were happy with the arrangement, but nobody expected that amount of hatred there – and from Harry’s end of the equation, no less.
‘I told you something’s going to go down. I knew it!’ Harry was as angry as Ron now. ‘How is he anyway? Still a pompous prick?’
‘Oh, I must have misunderstood, Minister. I’m sorry. I guess it makes no difference then, so I might as well take the request back…’
- But how do I know that’s what it is? What I am, I mean? – Harry raised his head to look in Draco’s eyes.
Days went by and there was no news of the Auror Office receiving a new Chief. Harry read through every single issue of the
‘Good to know.’ Draco nodded, somehow solemnly. ‘I can’t imagine anyone else living here. It’s stupid, I would never want to live here myself, not after all that happened, but it’s been the family’s since the beginning, so it’s just, I don’t know,
- No, I don’t know it. All I have to go off of is what he said during his trial and what you’re telling me now. And neither of you are exactly the most reliable source of information on that. I was at his house if you don’t remember, and he didn’t seem like he was willing to try to sabotage the operation there.
- Not coming. Not in the mood. – Draco muttered from above a rather lengthy roll of parchment.
‘A razor.’
- Don’t I date what? Tell it how it is? Were you or were you not the only one here to get branded with a Dark Mark? Am I wrong? – Dean was livid by now, but it was nothing compared to what Harry saw rising inside Draco.
‘Have you completely lost your mind?!’
‘Nothing of the sort. I’m merely commenting on your, rather pitiful I might add, inability to catch a band of snatchers. Although now that you mentioned it…’ he smirked ‘…it does seem rather odd that the person who supposedly killed the Dark Lord would be defeated by a group of hobos with wands.’
‘But…’ Neville was stuttering. ‘but how do you just not think about it? It’s… What you went through… I mean…’
‘So, how do you clean this thing? Won’t it run out of space at some point?’ Draco was sceptical.
for Mr. Malfoy for the duration of the other hearings.’
Draco was slowly regaining control of himself. He knew he needed to do something, anything, to try and keep Potter alive. He knew he wouldn’t be able to manage this on his own – he had no supplies and no time to brew anything and his own stash of potions taken from Snape’s office after the final battle (for commemoration purposes only, obviously) was way too limited to deal with this situation.
- Draco, don’t do it. – Harry reached out and pulled the arm towards him. – I love you, I love all of you, even this. – He raised Draco’s arm to his lips and placed a kiss on the mark. – We all have a past. It’s all behind you. You never wanted this, I know it. It only shows what you’ve been through, what made you the person you are now.
‘Maybe it will die down in a few weeks?’ Harry tried to sound hopeful, but he really didn’t believe it himself.
‘Baby, I can’t imagine any other career for you.’ Draco smiled and wrapped his arms around Harry.
‘Like they would do that for me, sure…’
‘Please, it’s not like your place is a palace. What are you going to do about it anyway?’
- You mean that sub thing again? – Harry looked like all the things in his head were at last starting to make sense.
- What, when? I’ve never seen it. – Zabini looked shocked.
run into him and he goes off the grid, then you’re moping for over a year about it, and now you’ve recruited him to work the case with you. It all seems a bit iffy in you ask me.’
- We do. But we can’t. I need to find some way to deal with this before I do something even more stupid… - Draco looked up. It was obvious he was at his wits’ end. He gave Nott a long look. – Fuck me, Theo. Fuck me till I can’t take it anymore.
- Not talking to perverts, thank you very much. – Ron’s voice from inside the room sounded like a very poor attempt to cover up loathing with disinterest.
- Anyway, what do Death Eater trials months ago have to do with you almost killing yourself tonight?
- God, you spent one night with him and you already sound like him! – Ron sounded shocked. – I knew this was a bad idea! What have you been doing that made you turn like that?!
Harry knew Draco was right. He needed to talk to Hermione and the sooner he did that, the better. His discussion with Draco was eating at him for half the night. Somehow he came to terms with the fact that Malfoy was in fact right about Harry wanting to relinquish control over himself to someone, but he still wasn’t all that convinced it was normal and healthy. And on top of that there was still the question of his newfound attitude towards Draco. So far, the revelations provided only served to send his brain into more of a spin than before, not ease any of his concerns. He decided that he’ll try to talk to Hermione in private after lunch.
‘Nothing, I just assumed… that you weren’t…’
, not
‘Even now, when you know I’m really innocent?’
‘Not exactly. From what I understand, the memories aren’t stored in the blood exactly – it’s more related to the soul. So blood is just a ‘carrier’ for the soul to leak out of your body in this case. And since you didn’t actually bleed at all, your whole soul should still be inside, untouched. What came out was the traces of dark magic that form the dark mark. It kind of acts as a barrier.’
‘No, it’s… it’s not like that.’ There were tears in Harry’s eyes. ‘I just don’t know who he can tell about you. You ran because you thought I told people and I’m scared you’ll run again…’
- You really believe this? – Ron didn’t seem convinced. – You need some defences! Some shield charms at the very least! I’ll write to Bill, he’s a curse breaker, maybe he can lend us some ideas how to deal with this tosser!
‘I’m not a virgin if that’s what you’re asking. I just never had sex with a woman.’
‘I might hate you, Draco, but not that much. I knew you were hurting and using this against you, for whatever reason, would be going way too far.’ Draco didn’t know what happened, but hearing Potter use his first name did something to him. Before he knew it, he was looking directly into Potter’s eyes with what he could only think of as gratitude painted all over his face. He vaguely registered his father’s voice in his head reminding him that he was a Malfoy and Malfoys don’t do this sort of thing.
He has almost reached the exit when he overheard his name being mentioned in a conversation between two elderly witches standing nearby. He didn’t want to insert himself into the conversation, so he just pretended to look at a shop display next to him and listened carefully. “Yes, yes, Draco Malfoy… The Death Eaters’ son, yes… Somewhere in Muggle London, they say Harry Potter has found him… Apparently he’s really not doing good… Very, very bad in fact…”.
‘Madame Kessley, the motion was yours, why don’t you start asking the questions?’ Kingsley’s deep voice brought Harry back a little.
‘No, Minister, I don’t. I realize this was not enough to answer your suspicions. But… Can I stay here and you go on yourselves? I can’t handle what’s in there.’
It took Draco a few days to come up with a plan on how to find out if he’s been outed by Potter. One Monday morning he waited for Mina to go to sleep and reached for his wand. He became quite good at self-transfiguration, and even if his best work was out of the question, he could still make himself look different enough for the people in Diagon Alley to not recognize him. He gave himself some muscles, facial hair and long, black ponytail and made his way to the Leaky Cauldron.
‘Never took you for a delicate flower, Malfoy.’ Harry laughed. ‘Although, it would fit…’ His voice trailed off suggestively.
‘Potter, don’t make me laugh.’ Draco scoffed, offended. ‘Me? Forced to do something? Have you not seen me duel?’
- You don’t mind those?
‘Are you?’ Draco raised his eyebrows.
‘Well, what can I say, my brain does weird things sometimes. I think the…’ But he didn’t have a chance to finish this thought.
- Try to lift
- Fuck off, all of you! Leave me alone! – Draco’s patience ran out. He was disgusted with what he heard, with his own reaction to it and now, on top of it, with his friends’ attitude towards the whole situation.
- I couldn’t tell you it’s me! You’d have me outed!
‘And what good does waiting do me?’ Draco refused to look down. They were frozen like that, Harry’s hand on Draco’s wrist, eyes locked, leaning towards each other, for a couple of seconds before Harry finally let go and spoke.
‘We’re waiting for any incidents to pop up, as per
‘I don’t know. They are looking for a night guard at St. Mungo’s so I’ll probably try there for a job and find myself some place to live.’
- It’s ok, Theodore, I know about you two. – Harry tried to calm him down.
‘And he asked how I see him being here and us three working together.’ Harry felt his face turning white. This was no good.
This particular thought brought Malfoy back to the question that started it all – what on Earth was McGonagall going to do with the sleeping situation? His gut told him that whatever it was, he was not going to like it. But surely, she couldn’t be so stupid as to force him away from his friends, right? Sticking him in a dorm room with some random Hufflepuff would be the cherry on top of a sundae of her idiotic approach. Because if it came to this, it would have to be the shyest, most docile Hufflepuff there is – there is no way she’d room him with a Ravenclaw, they were too outspoken to risk it, there would be too much potential for a confrontation. And Gryffindors were just out of the question entirely, she can’t possibly be THAT naïve and moronic.
‘Don’t ask me how it works, I have never studied engineering, so I haven’t a clue. But it does and it’s pretty fast, by Muggle standards.’
‘No, Mr. Potter, you cannot. You are to stay with Mr. Malfoy and keep an eye on him. I will have all the necessary paperwork regarding your current cases owled to you, and you will remain on what they call
‘What are you getting at? You’re trying to find out if I’m into you?’ Draco laughed, but there was some undertone there that Harry couldn’t decipher.
‘My suspicion is that if the confessions fall, they will be looking for other evidence to implicate you. There is still time to fight it, but I need your help – was the Manor emptied completely when the authorities confiscated our belongings? Is there
- “People like me”? – Harry didn’t understand at all.
‘To drink some more.’ Draco pushed past Potter to enter the living room.
‘Lucius? No.’ Draco went stiff at the mention of his father. ‘I don’t want to, if I’m being honest. I don’t want nothing to do with him after all he put mother and I through.’ Suddenly there were tears in his eyes – he looked like something broke inside of him right at that moment, like he himself got broken. ‘We never wanted what happened, mother and I. I know it’s probably nothing after all that happened, but I just wanted to say I’m sorry. I know it mends nothing, but I just want you to know that I never wanted to be a part of this. And I know my mum didn’t either. We were just following where father went, we didn’t think we had any other choice. We both just wanted to stick together and we decided to just be there in the background, you know, to still be together as a family. Now I know that it was a wrong thing to do, that if father wanted to do what he did, we should’ve just left. But it wasn’t easy – mother loved him, despite what he was, and I was just raised to want to be like him, it was imprinted in me for years. I only started thinking for myself shortly before it all began and by then it was too late.’ Draco was crying, hiding his face in his hands. ‘I was stupid, I realize that now, I made all the wrong choices I could have. I’m sorry. I know you’ll probably never forgive me for all the hurt I’ve caused, but I just needed to tell you that it was never my intention to do it. I never imagined it would all turn out this way.’
‘Gentlemen, as much as I applaud your sacrifices to your job, spending three nights in some field in northern Scotland, I cannot do that. Mr. Malfoy is, for all intents and purposes, an innocent person, so there is no way I can have him sent to Azkaban just because of Mr. Weasley’s intuition.’ Draco looked relieved. ‘But I do agree that Mr. Malfoy’s propensity to vanish at a drop of a hat poses a certain threat to this investigation. Under normal circumstances, Mr. Malfoy would be placed on house arrest until this matter is resolved – however, I am aware, that there are some unusual circumstances in this particular situation. Hence, I suggest one of you two takes responsibility for Mr. Malfoy for the time being.’ Harry and Ron groaned.
‘How?’ Lucius’ face lit up – Draco knew he chose the right cover story and relaxed a little.
‘Don’t be dramatic, Weasley, it’s only three floors. And besides, I spent most of my time in my room anyway. Perks of having a house elf, you can have anything delivered.’ Harry noticed a faint tinge of pain in Draco’s eyes when he said it. Ron tried to push the door open, but it wouldn’t move. Rolling his eyes, Draco stepped in front of him and opened the door with ease. ‘I never liked people invading my space without permission.’ He shrugged.
- No, I haven’t been. Harry didn’t even want for us to break up, but it had to be done.
- That? Oh, it’s nothing, just my band logo. I’m a rock singer by day, you see. – He tried to smile, but it was way more effort than he could manage right now.
‘Hardly, Weasley. I like being comfortable, I just don’t share my parents’ taste in interior design.’ He shot Ron a sideways glance. ‘For instance, my mother would always choose some antique, French excuse of a bed, just because it has cherubs carved on it, even if it meant you’d be sleeping on top of your partner all night and waking up with a broken back every morning. Me, I’d much rather get myself a super king size with a good mattress, even if it means lack of naked angel butts.’
‘I’ve known him for almost 10 years now, Minister, so I am sure it is him.’
‘So tell me, Potter, how long is this going to go on?’
‘And he’s been there all this time?’ Harry asked Ron, ignoring Malfoy’s presence in the room.
‘I’ll try to order it to open in parseltongue and we’ll see what happens, right?’ He looked at Draco to find confirmation. ‘Ron, Neville, if
‘Guys…’ Neville pleaded quietly. ‘Do you have to be like this? You used to be friends! We all did!’
And here we are <3 The boys are getting married <3
- I don’t remember. There is still some left if you want some. Or if you want to try and figure it out.
- Ron and Hermione know. I had to tell someone, I couldn’t keep it in me. – Harry said quietly, not meeting his gaze. – So if you want to tell Pansy, I’m okay with it.
from Potter) – and even if he decided to let go of any last shred of who he once was (not that he was sure there was anything to let go of left there at all) then after his display last night, that particular ship has sailed.
‘No, Mr. Malfoy, sadly there was nothing.’ Shacklebolt shook his head. ‘On one hand it’s good, because there is no proof you’ve been involved in this, but on the other, it doesn’t completely erase my hesitation. I’m sure you understand.’
- You like that baby? – For Draco, the only thing better than sex itself was hearing the other person tell him they loved what he did to them.
‘So you’d sleep with me for drugs and survival but not out of actual desire?’
‘Don’t play dumb, Potter. You can’t convince me that you didn’t know.’ His face changed from amused to threatening. ‘You know what I see? You thought she was going to wait for you, but she didn’t. You received a wedding invitation, saw that she was marrying Longbottom, one of your closest friends, you felt betrayed and you wanted revenge. So you summoned Longbottom here and now Longbottom is dead. My only question is, Potter – did you plan it from the start or was it just a spur of the moment decision?’
Do let me know what you think :) And thanks for the Kudos I've gotten so far, you're really sweet! :)
‘Well, actually, yes…’ Draco looked at his feet, suddenly subdued.
‘I told you that last year already and you didn’t seem to have a problem with it…’
Like in slow motion, Harry watched Draco pluck the knife from his hand and slide it vertically across his whole left forearm, practically cutting the Dark Mark in half. Once again, for a brief second, Harry experienced a flashback to Dumbledore. But there was no time to dwell on that, because Draco was now resting his arm against the door. The moment he touched it surface, there was a metallic click of the lock and a piercing scream – it lasted maybe a fraction of a second, but to Harry it was like a lifetime. Draco’s hand slid off the door, leaving a bloody trace, but he just stood there, transfixed at something in front of him. The blood was now dripping onto the stone floor – only it wasn’t red, like it should be, it was black and thick like tar.
‘So what now? I’m supposed to go there and confront him or something?’ Harry didn’t know what to do.
would he want this if this was going to be just a temporary thing? And finally, Hermione, I told you already – this has
‘Okay, let’s say I’m convinced. But what does it change if they caused the triggers or just used them?’
‘Well, don’t bet it just yet, because I feel rather shitty right now…’
- They’re not together anymore. – Pansy closed the book she was reading. – I don’t know what happened, but Draco is completely broken, so I figure it must have been something major. He’s been drinking again.
‘I can get rid of this thing? For ever?’ Draco felt a sudden wave of hope inside him.
‘I’m impressed, Potter.’ He leaned elegantly against the wall, crossing his arms. ‘I thought you were going to crack in front of her.’
Harry heard Ron let out an exasperated sigh from behind him.
‘You offering?’ Draco’s hand was underneath his jeans and underwear, fingertips digging into Harry’s skin and brushing over his slit lightly. He thought he was going to lose his mind from these touches alone. All coherence was completely gone, all he could think of was how much he wanted this.
He was so wrapped up in his thoughts he came back to reality only halfway through Herbology. Apparently he was working with Pansy on repotting some plant he was in no shape to recognize, although he probably knew what it was. He looked around. Next to them Weasel was working with Potter (although for some reason Draco’s brain registered the presence of “Harry”, not “Potter”).
Seeing what he was doing, Draco raised his wand to help Harry.
‘Then make some room on that sill.’ Harry had no idea why he all of a sudden wanted to sit opposite Draco, there was clearly not enough room for two people there. But it came out and Malfoy was already taking his legs off the windowsill to make room for him.
Fair warning: Next chapter is mainly my poor attempts at describing sex (Turns out, it's way more difficult than I thought!). I'll try to post it later today :D
- Why fucked-up? What would be so bad there? Is it bad that I could potentially have feelings for him?
Suddenly Draco realized that he’d been so preoccupied with his own fate that he completely ignored the fact that this whole case would mean at least charges on gross procedural misconduct for Harry. Fuck, this couldn’t possibly go any worse! If he gets demoted to some measly assistant because of Draco there is no way he would be able to live with himself.
- Just trying to forget.
He closed his eyes. It seemed like the decision has made itself. There would be no Draco Malfoy anymore – or at least, no body occupying the Earth under the name, because Draco Malfoy, a person, was long gone at this point anyway.
‘This is exactly why I came here myself, Mr. Longbottom. This is very serious business, whatever is inside of that room can potentially be fatal, and without Mr. Malfoy’s help the risks are even bigger. But we do need to determine if we can trust you.’
- You can’t be not good enough for me, Draco. You’re amazing… - Harry was slowly coming back to their bed.
-  Brilliant! – Harry said dryly. – So now it’s me or having a roof over your head?
‘He couldn’t and you know it. You should’ve foreseen this. It’s called
‘Yeah.’ Draco winced – Harry knew it wasn’t due to pain. At least not physical one. ‘East wing, top floor, last door on the left. How do you not know this anyway? You were the ones that figured out there might be something unopened yet.’
’ he didn’t even look over his shoulder running through the door.
- My meds. – Potter’s indifference was starting to send Draco somewhere between panic and anger.
‘I told you: out. Hog’s Head.’
- That’s scary if I’m being honest…
‘Jesus, Potter, chill out! I’m an adult, you don’t have to baby me.’ Draco wasn’t even sure if what he was feeling was panic or anger. ‘I fell. I told you to not leave the floor wet!’
‘Me being here. How long are you planning on dragging this?’
Without a word Nott, Pansy and Harry followed them out of the common room.
- Lay off him, Hermione. – Draco looked ashamed for some reason. – I asked Theo to hurt me. I asked him to not hold back, he only obliged.
‘Harry, dear, what’s going on?’ She exclaimed upon seeing him.
‘I must say, you are a very brave man, Mr…’ She looked at him expectedly.
let a suspect in the case get involved like that, no matter your personal relationship with them. Now, Mr. Weasley, what you presented in this courtroom today was entirely inappropriate and out of place. Not only did you try to convince us that Mr. Potter had some sort of physical relationship with Mr. Malfoy, but also you used your own personal relationships with both of them to push your narrative. Not to mention that said behaviour caused you to draw conclusions from the facts that you obtained outside your job and that had no standing in the case. And, if I were in Mr. Potter’s position right now, I would carefully reconsider the stance of my friendship with you. Frankly, the only person who behaved rationally and appropriately during this case, was the suspect himself, Mr. Malfoy.’ Ron looked white as a sheet, completely shocked. ‘And now, for the verdict itself: in the matter of Malfoy, Draco Lucius – the verdict is: innocent. You’re cleared of all charges, Mr. Malfoy.’
Draco and Harry spent their first post-Hogwarts weekend locked inside Grimmauld Place 12, blissfully ignorant to the world around them, apart from a one-time visit to a nearby café for lunch on Saturday. Sunday night, after dark, they packed their essentials, threw Harry’s invisibility cloak over them, locked the door with every protective enchantment that came to mind and went on to apparate outside the gates of Malfoy Manor. Standing there, Harry concluded that it was a rather magnificent house and it really made a lasting impression, if one was there on their own free will and not being dragged in by a hoard of snatchers, possibly being led to their death.
They spent the next four hours in the kitchen, reading through the reports – Harry on a barstool by the island and Draco sitting on its counter, cross-legged.
- What do you mean you don’t hate him anymore?! – Weasel was clearly disgusted at whatever he was just told.
‘But you were acquitted. It says on the list that the charges themselves don’t mean anything.’
‘Whatever it was, it looks horrible. Do any of you have any idea what the hell do we do now?’ Harry was furious.
‘…BUT’ Hermione shot him a pointed look. ‘you didn’t bleed
he thought faintly before passing out from pain.
Draco – Harry figured, that if he was in his room, next to him, he must have come out of whatever possessed him back at the Manor, but it didn’t mean that he was all fine by now. After all, nobody seemed to have any idea what actually happened, and that made Harry worried. If they didn’t know what caused this, or even why did Draco behave like he did, there was no way to fix this. And that would mean the damage could be much more severe than they would be able to see. And that black substance dripping out of the slice? That wasn’t blood, Harry knew that for sure, but what could it have been? Was it possible that Draco might die because of this?
‘Fine by me. Harry?’ He looked expectantly at him.
‘Wait…’ Harry didn’t fully register what just happened. ‘Does this mean you’re giving Draco a job?’
‘No. There’s no need. How I’m feeling will kill me on its own.’ Draco was forcing himself not to look at Harry.
‘Oh, thank you for your honesty…’ Ron sneered. ‘If you must know, he asked about the case and how much you involved Malfoy, and what parts of it did he figure out.’
Malfoy was still up, reading. He gave no indication of registering Harry’s presence in the room, which Harry actually welcomed. He got into his pyjamas and climbed into the bed.
- I… I don’t know. – Harry sat up. Draco suddenly felt cold even though the room was warm enough. – I realized some time ago I’m gay. After the war ended and I could freely be with Ginny like I thought I wanted to, I realized I didn’t have any romantic feelings for her. She was-is amazing, and I feel good around her, like I can finally be myself, but there was no love there, you know?
‘I don’t know, it’s just how it turned out.’
‘Why didn’t you tell Weasley what happened?’ He said before he could stop himself.
‘You’re not supposed to drink, you already fucked up your liver.’ Harry frowned, but turned towards the kitchen. Truth be told, he could use a drink himself.
I have to warn you again: More violence coming your way. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I wasn't planning on it to go that route, but it just happenned, I just can't make this story easy and fluffy right now (*hides*). But we're getting there, there is a chance for some fluff later on (if I don't change my mind again, that is).
‘I am.’ However grateful for Harry’s protection Draco was, he needed to prove he was trustworthy. And he decided that confronting his past might actually bring some benefits. ‘But I will need a cover story – Harry is right, he’ll never trust me without it. Is there anything I can use to persuade him that he might gain something by telling me?’ Suddenly, an idea came to him. ‘Minister, I’m sorry for asking, but… Did you use Veritaserum during the trials?’
‘I do…’ Lucius was hesitant.
- Oh… - Mina’s eyes widened. – Are… are you considering it? There might still be other options for you, you know?
Because really, there was no connection between Harry-Yasmine-Malfoy triangle and the case of the snatchers. There really wasn’t, Malfoy would’ve ended up being forced on him even if Yasmine never existed.
‘If that’s still on the table, I’ll think about it.’ Draco had no idea why he said this. But what was even more unnerving, was the fact that even though he knew he should be kicking himself for it, he wasn’t. That somehow, although Draco couldn’t figure out how, it was the right thing to say.
‘We both did. Don’t forget, Voldemort lived in our house, we knew everything. That’s why I refused to testify.’
‘What else did he ask about?’
‘There is no way for him to do that, you know that.’ Hermione tried to be reassuring, but looked worried. ‘Besides, who could he be scheming against? He won’t go after Kingsley’s job, he doesn’t want the responsibility and everyone knows you can’t touch Kingsley. And every other job at the Ministry is beneath him, so there is no possible target.’
‘Actually, you.’ Ron shook his head. ‘Well, not
‘What are you saying?’
- No, ok, forget it. – Harry gave up. – It doesn’t matter.
‘Sod off, Malfoy.’ Harry was too angry to even try and be polite. ‘And Ron, this is
- SHUT UP! – Harry lost all control over himself. He didn’t know how, but suddenly he was being held back by Draco and Neville, while Hermione was wrestling Ron trying to keep him behind their table. – One more word, Wesley, and you’ll regret it for the rest of your life… - he didn’t like his own tone of voice. He never threatened Ron like that, but there was nothing else he could do. All he felt was pure rage. The shock of what came out of Harry’s mouth seemed to calm Ron down just enough to keep him from struggling against Hermione.
- Uhm… - Harry hesitated. It was clear he was embarrassed about his fantasies. – I think… Well, I know… I want to go all the way with you. – That last part came out in one breath, like Harry was scared of what he was saying.
‘Not really. It’s a normal thing there – if the parents are at work for half a day and cleaning by hand takes so much time, the kids have to help out or there would be just work and cleaning all the time. Besides, kids make a mess too, so it’s only fair they lend a hand at cleaning.’
‘What happened?’ Ron looked worried.
So there it was. The one moment in his life he never wanted to live through, the time when he would find out how long he’s going to Azkaban for. Not that it mattered anyway, nothing about him mattered at this point – he would gladly take a life sentence if Harry’s job would be safe in return. He tried looking at Harry, tried to understand what mindset was he in, but all he could find on his face was something similar to anger – but not quite. He thought he has seen the same expression on Harry’s face when he was chasing a snitch during Quidditch matches a lifetime ago. So Draco looked around. The three actual snatchers were there with him, looking solemn, like they knew their fate already. Weasley was looking like he was expecting to be declared a winner of some great tournament and like there was no way he would lose this.
‘Come on, like I believe you…’
‘Never thought of you that way. Don’t forget, I hate you.’
‘You will do no such thing, Mr. Potter.’ Chief’s voice came from the doorway. Ron and Harry fell silent. ‘You are not quitting. Now, I have carefully considered your request, Mr. Potter, as well as Mr. Weasley’s objections to it. I must say, it is a rather unusual development of events. You know very well that we do not usually employ people associated with the Dark Side.’ Harry groaned. There was no way Draco would get this job. He was fully prepared to storm out and never return, when he heard his boss continue. ‘And Mr. Weasley’s threat to quit does not make it any easier. As I have observed, the two of you need to take some time apart to resolve your issues. Mr. Weasley will be assigned a different partner for the time being and you, Mr. Potter, will have to work solely with Mr. Malfoy.’
‘But you tried to stop me from using my wand?’ Draco’s voice sounded full of suspicion.
‘Thank you. Now, how would they prove conclusively that a person is first a witch and second, a potential target…?’ He got lost in thought. ‘There must be a trigger of some sort, but what would it be…?’
‘Harry…’ the blonde looked him in the eyes – Harry could clearly see he was worried ‘if it hurts maybe I should try to open this. Besides, father said it was sealed with his blood, so my guess is that mine will be the most likely to unlock whatever this is.’
‘Not necessarily. Look at your list of victims, do any of them have any family or wizard neighbours? My guess is, they’ve set to sought out the lonely ones – if they have nobody to talk to about their decision to spend money on this ‘protection’, they’re an easier target.’
- Oh, you beg so good… - By now he was completely cold and dominant, like he often was. He felt adrenaline rush through his veins when he pressed one finger inside his boyfriend. He vaguely registered small drops of precome on himself when he heard Harry’s breath hitch. But he knew he needed more, he needed to hear animal-like moans. Without thinking, he slipped the second finger in. Oh yes, this was the moaning he needed.
‘No, father. I came to help you.’ He tried to smile or sound genuine, but it wasn’t easy. ‘We have limited time, they only gave me fifteen minutes, so I’ll just go right into it, ok?’ That was a lie, but Draco decided that placing a time limit on the conversation will allow him to avoid explaining what he’s been doing for almost three years now. ‘I’ve been trying to establish myself after the war, and I’ve made some useful contacts in different places – one of them has told me recently that there might be a chance for us to overturn your and mother’s convictions…’
- No, that’s not what I was talking about. Although, actually, I might want to know. – He added after reflecting.
Harry smiled and wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist. Once again, they were lost in the kiss – and just like two weeks before, it was full of hunger, desperation,
‘This is why we need a good excuse. That is, if Mr. Malfoy is prepared to do this.’
- Nothing, I told you. We talked. Unlike you, he tried to understand how I felt.
It took almost two weeks being stuck in insufferable silence, avoiding each other, before Draco finally received his paperwork from the Census Bureau one morning.
‘To what extent?’
, so…’ he paused for a second ‘…what are we?’
‘Did you for instance just ask Malfoy one night for help?’
Summer was nearing an end and Draco was getting more and more nervous about his job prospects. He had sent the required paperwork almost immediately after getting his references, but August was almost over and he hasn’t received any response yet.
‘Who did what, Potter?’ Draco was looking at him with a mixture of curiosity and a slight bit of annoyance – Harry knew he never liked pointless exclamations.
didn’t help because I didn’t even have anyone to talk to about the case.’
‘Oh, excuse me for disturbing!’ Potter’s mocking tone was getting on his last nerve. ‘If it makes you feel any better, you’re disturbing me more than I’m disturbing you. I’ve got paperwork to do and I’ve got nowhere to do it, since you’re occupying my couch.’
- Potter, what is this? – He didn’t know if he sounded worried or furious. It didn’t matter.
- So, there was this guy and Draco liked him. You know how he is when he is with someone, right? – She looked at Harry expectedly. Harry knew what she meant and nodded. – And one day we all went for a walk, when this other dude, I think he was older than us, but not by much, I remember his face from Hogwarts, although I don’t know his name, came up to us and started insulting Draco’s friend. He was saying things like “oh, so that’s who you’re with now, my sister is crying because of you, I thought we were friends” etc.. And he was using really disgusting slurs. The guy Draco was with was starting to panic, he looked like he was about to cry. I don’t know how it happened but the next thing I knew the guy is backed up into a tree, Draco is completely in his face, his wand is at the guy’s throat. And Draco is like “say one more word and you’ll be begging for me to kill you, I dare you!”. It was the same tone he used on Wesley yesterday. I was never this scared of him, I really thought he was going to Crucio the guy. His eyes were all narrow and he was so tense it looked like he was going to hex him only by how furious he was. I had to physically pull him off this guy. – There were a couple seconds of silence between them. Nobody knew what to say. Finally, Nott spoke.
‘I don’t know. I’ve started analysing my sexuality ever since you asked me and I’m growing curious.’ WHY on Earth would he say that?! Even drunk Harry thought it was a bad idea.
‘Once again: sod off, Malfoy.’ Harry was in no mood to talk to Draco right now, so he slammed the empty coffee cup on the counter and stormed off to take a shower.
- I beg to differ. – Seamus took one step forward. – I can clearly see one.
‘Convenient…’
‘What do I know?’
The door opened again, and Yasmine was just about to greet her guest in her most seductive voice, when the words got stuck in her throat. Leaning against the door frame, like nothing was wrong, was Harry bloody Potter.
- SO FUCKING WHAT? Am I wrong here? Is he not just a waste of oxygen for everyone around him? And to have the fucking audacity to show his bloody face here after all he’s done!
Ok, so Ron is an arsehole clearly (at least for now, haha), because we need things to not be just susnhine and roses all the time and I'm a proud Slytherin to the core, in case that is not obvious by now.
- I can’t wait to run my tongue along those, you know? – He was sure the lust was clearly visible in his eyes, but he didn’t care. Harry deserved to know just how much of an effect he had on him.
Several hours later Harry was sitting in his office, trying to concentrate and get all his paperwork done before his meeting with the Chief of Aurors, but his mind was occupied by thoughts of his talk with Draco that morning.
‘I haven’t done it!’
- Good to know. – Draco smiled. – We both need some time to rest though, but if you want any more fun tonight, I’ll be up for it later.
‘I’m thankful, Potter, but I highly doubt it. For one, I’m an ex-Death Eater and my parents are in Azkaban for life – not exactly qualities the Auror Office is looking for, I suppose. And for the other, how do you imagine me working with you if Weasley is your partner?’
Several hours later Harry was still uneasy. Draco’s behaviour during Potions terrified him, and the fact that after all of it went down he seemed unbothered enough to return to his cauldron like nothing happened didn’t do anything to aid the situation. They didn’t speak since that one order to stay back Draco barked at Harry back in the dungeons and now during dinner they were each sitting at their own house tables not looking at each other. Harry was jabbing his peas absentmindedly when Dean plopped down next to him.
- Leave me alone please. – He was in no state to confront yet another one of his classmates.
‘Honestly, I get it. I have the same thing with Grimmauld Place. It wouldn’t be right to sell it – like I would betray Sirius by it or something…’ Harry tried to shake the memory of Sirius off for now. They had a job to do. ‘Guys, how do we get in, anyway? I’m not sure I know what protection the Ministry used.’ He addressed Ron and Neville.
It took him a few days just to compose himself enough to think about what he was going to do. He didn’t dare go back to the parlour in case the word got out already and other wizards would come to have their fun with him. He still had enough money put aside to somehow get by, so he wasn’t worried about it.
‘To what?’
‘I had my reasons. It doesn’t concern you. Can you leave us alone now?’
- Anyway, - Zabini broke the uncomfortable silence in half-whisper – what we saw in Potions was way over what we would’ve expected from Draco. Honestly, I don’t know what to even tell you, he never acted like this, not even before the war when he was still a full-blown arsehole to everyone he didn’t like. Oh, don’t look at me like that Theo, you know he was! We all were! – He responded to Nott’s irritated look.
‘And why is that?’
‘What
‘I’m not, I’m just joking.’ Potter looked a little unnerved. ‘Anyway, can we go back to the case?’
- So I’m wondering if it would be a good idea to pull him out of there. He won’t come back on his own, he has nothing here, so he needs someone to lend a hand.
- Well, again, if that is what you need to tell yourself, it is fine by me. Just don’t make that noise ever again when you see me.
happening lately between Harry and Malfoy, I’ve noticed…’
‘Well, now we have two options. Either we get a cab, which is more expensive, or if you’re up for some more adventures, we can take the Underground.’ Harry smiled.
‘So, Mr. Potter, you’ve requested a
– The last part of this sentence came out in a low growl as Draco added the third finger without warning. Harry screamed and this was what pushed Draco over the edge. His vision went completely white for a second as he exploded.
as in
‘I am, Mr. Potter.
- Fine, if you’re not willing to reach out to him, I will. – Hermione stood up, determined. – I just need to figure out what he might have used that we won’t think of.
Are they both in denial about how they're really feeling? What do you think? Let me know :D
‘I have to, Harry. He’ll never get off your case if I don’t do this. Me, I couldn’t care less what he thinks, but I see this is eating you alive.’ He looked back at Ron. ‘So what’s it gonna be, Weasley? You in or out?’
‘We’re staying at the Manor for now, with my mum.’ Draco said quietly. ‘She insisted she needed to teach us how to feed ourselves and stuff before we…’
‘If you say so. But if this turns into a disaster, it’s your fault!’ With that, Draco ran the tap and poured significantly more water into the bowl. The mixture quickly turned into sort of a mud consistency.
‘Well…’ Draco was visibly perplexed with being addressed like that. ‘I’m thinking of a Healer training at St. Mungo’s.’
Ron and Neville left, and Draco was now feeling completely drained and terrified. Veritaserum was still in effect, swimming through his bloodstream, so he knew that he couldn’t undo his confession. He felt miserable under Harry’s gaze, like what he said hurt them both: it wasn’t like Harry had any feelings towards him, and now that he knew how Draco felt, he would most likely feel obligated to stay with him, even when he clearly didn’t want to – Draco knew that Harry was too much of a good, caring person to risk doing anything that would push anybody, even Draco, to hurting themselves. So he would stay there, waiting for something to change, before he could just up and leave Draco forever, because he surely can’t be expected to be stuck with him for the rest of his life. But the moment Draco blurted out his potion-induced love confession, it became clear that those feelings weren’t going anywhere, that he would be forever in love with Harry Potter. And even if somehow, at some point, he would manage to lie and convince Harry that he was over him, just to free him of the burden of having to be there, it would take time. And in the meantime he would be the lowest thing he has ever been in his life – a charity case for feelings. He chuckled bitterly to himself, wiping the tears that gathered in his eyes. How could he have been so naïve to think that he had already hit his rock bottom? It should’ve been obvious – as long as you can still somehow survive with all the self-loathing and pure, unadulterated hatred towards yourself, it can still be worse. He sighed. At least this time there was nowhere to go. At least this time there was no way he could survive this, so things couldn’t possibly get any worse. Give it days and he wouldn’t be here anymore. And he wouldn’t even have to do anything, just stay there exactly where he was, feeling exactly as he did right now, and his own revulsion with himself will tear him to shreds on its own. It was just a matter of time.
- So?
And it seemed like half of the ex-Gryffindors agreed with Harry’s opinion – in a matter of seconds three wands were pointing at Malfoy’s face. If it wasn’t for Hermione’s “Stop this right now!” Ron, Seamus and Dean would’ve hexed Malfoy – each one with their own spell – which would’ve inevitably sent Malfoy to the Hospital Wing for at least a week, by Harry’s estimation.
He sighed and tried to go back to his own work – it was pointless to go there, they would never be anything more than what they already were, and trying to reignite that hope would only hurt him. But then again, it didn’t hurt to dream, right? He was yanked out of his own fantasy, however, when the door opened and he saw Ron and Neville standing there.
- But how do I know this won’t happen again? – Harry was still not convinced.
‘Do you
‘Yeah, with actual Aurors! Don’t you see the difference?’
‘If that’s what you both want, I have no objections.’ Kingsley nodded.
to talk about. I saw them, they pissed me off, I screamed, I calmed down, now we’re here.’
- It’s about Draco. – Harry sighed. – About how he addressed Ron yesterday.
‘I don’t either. I haven’t been in the house for three years, I don’t even have a clue what happened to it after parents lost it.’
(See the end of the chapter for
And there were a couple of one night stands with several Ravenclaws, one Durmstrang student over the Easter holidays and one very drunken mistake with Nott. All together, around 12 people I think?
‘…and there is nothing between me and him. And there will be nothing. Why do you have a problem with it anyway?’
‘Behind one of the walls in your room. The one your headboard is against.’
- Yo-You told Slughorn about this? – Potter was visibly panicked. – You had no right!
‘So what, we’re friends with benefits?’ Harry felt bitter when Draco said they were not a couple – it sounded so definitive, like he wouldn’t even consider it. But even friends with benefits was better than nothing, Harry thought, so he’d take it.
‘No!’ Harry stood up, shouting ‘YOU don’t understand! I’ve caused this! Were any of you there with me? No? Then stop acting like idiots and listen to the person that ACTUALLY knows what happened, ok? This is my fault and your stupid, incessant faith that it’s all only Draco’s fault, is not helping! You know what? If you’re going to be like this, just better leave me alone!’ He stormed off. They could only hear the front door shutting behind him as Ron was staring ahead in stunned silence and Hermione was sobbing into her hands.
‘Harry, you’re much more valuable than me.’ Draco’s words suddenly reminded Harry of what Dumbledore said years ago. ‘You will survive. We both will.’ Draco added determinately and Harry was just hoping he was right. He pressed his lips into a thin line and nodded – he knew there was no changing Draco’s mind.
‘Because it doesn’t matter to me anymore. I cut ties with these people. And it’s not really illegal as far as I know, right?’
‘Well, I told him he doesn’t know shit and his father doesn’t either, because nothing happened, and I might have added a few expletives…’ Ron shrugged ‘you know, to get my point across. He got angry, started insulting me, and we got to fighting. As a result, he has to go to anger management and I’m suspended for two weeks.’
- Oh, so you’re not a sex worker? Sorry, I just thought, since you’re here at the break of dawn you must’ve been up all night for some reason and you don’t strike me as a party type. Again, I’m sorry…
- And I’m assuming, since you say you can sense if someone is a… sub? – Harry hesitated, but continued when he saw Draco nodding with a small smile – that you’re the other type?
‘Why? You still don’t trust him after this?’
On his part, Draco didn’t notice anything being different. Potter has been his usual bratty attention-seeking and inconsiderate self – his habit of waking up as late as possible and then loudly complaining to his circle of admirers about not being able to use the bathroom any time he damn well pleased (as if he had ever put any effort in his appearance!) was really starting to annoy Malfoy.
‘It just didn’t.’
- And why is that? Picked up some tricks from your guru last year? It couldn’t have been much, I mean the guy didn’t seem to be able to conjure himself a nose…
thing?’ Harry seemed to forget there were other people in the room.
‘Wait a second…’ Narcissa looked at them warily ‘Did I just hear you refer to Harry as your fiancée?’
- No, I wouldn’t! What the fuck do I know anymore?! I haven’t done anything!
‘Don’t get angry at us, we didn’t do it!’ Neville seemed scared. ‘We can’t go back, we need to get this done tonight – besides, I’m not even sure the gate will let us pass again. I’ll try and find something that would at least help with the pain, and you two send a message to the Minister to send someone to lift all of this so we can get out.’ He was rummaging through his pockets looking for some antidote, and in the meantime Ron sent his patronus to London. Finally, after what felt like ages, Neville pulled out a small vial and poured some green potion Harry didn’t recognize onto Draco’s wrist. ‘There. I don’t know if it will heal this, but it should keep it from worsening and help with the pain. How are you feeling?’
They all laughed, but Draco’s mind went elsewhere.
He decided to start with the Burrow, since even if they weren’t there someone was bound to know how to get a hold of them. He stuck his head into the fireplace and seconds later he was staring at the Weasley’s living room. It was Molly who noticed him first.
year heard the scream, but somehow only the two of them came to investigate. Gryffindor bravery can be a bad thing, Harry concluded. He didn’t particularly want to be seen sitting there with Ron and Hermione while it was obvious someone (if he was being honest with himself, he’d admit that it was rather apparent who) was screaming his name during sex. – And what the fuck is Potter doing here? With you two?! From what we’ve just been treated to, you’d think he was balls deep in his psychopathic boyfriend right now!
‘But then, it seems like a very suspicious coincidence that you would be there to effectively help them…’
- God, yes, please, more…
‘I never said this, Mr. Potter. I said that you have to ‘keep an eye’ on Mr. Malfoy until his involvement in the case, or lack thereof, is conclusively determined. That, in turn, means, that regardless of the order of interrogations, Mr. Malfoy is to be watched over until all the depositions are collected.’ Harry turned white. So they weren’t going to let him listen to the snatchers’ testimonies!
‘Go ahead.’ Harry was determined not to even look at him. He was still too angry at all Ron has done.
- That was… Intense. – Hermione broke the silence. – You think you can go back there?
- Ron, I’m begging you, stop this! – Hermione was crying.
‘Will you stop with this twink thing?! I’m not a twink!’
‘Fine…’ Potter sighed, rolling his eyes ‘I suppose you might have a point. Not with me being stupid, obviously, but with the other thing.’
- Why would you be blamed for it? – Nott seemed sceptical.
The scene seemed to go on for hours, but all Harry could focus on was Draco’s tears on his neck and his nails digging into his side. It hurt, but Harry knew it was nothing compared to what he was feeling right now, just listening to the memory. He tightened his arms around Draco, trying to shield him from what was going on. ‘Shhh, don’t listen… It’ll be over soon… Don’t listen, just focus on my voice…’ He whispered quietly enough for only Draco to hear ‘You’re not there anymore… It’s not real, it’s not happening, nobody’s hurting you now… Don’t listen… Focus on me now, breathe, focus on my voice, not on that…’ It seemed to work – Draco was still crying, but his breathing evened out a little and his grip on Harry loosened. The screaming stopped and Harry dared to look at what was happening.
- Hello Pansy. – Harry had lost all his concentration, so he reluctantly set the parchment down bracing himself to go find Hermione. After all, now was as good of a time as any. – Seen Hermione?
‘Well, kind of. I heard a guy wanking off once and it gave me… ideas.’ Not even drunk Harry would admit he was talking about Draco.
- I… I don’t know. – Draco’s previous rage evaporated and he was left feeling ashamed and terrified for what he did. He knew very well that if it wasn’t for his friend, Dean Thomas would be lying dead on the common room floor by now. – I didn’t think. It just came over me. It couldn’t stand… - He looked at Harry, who was sitting opposite him with an unreadable expression. – I couldn’t handle the way he was speaking to Harry.
‘Yes, Minister.’ Ron confirmed.
- Yeah, sure, brilliant idea! A suicide note will OF COURSE erase all the suspicions they… - he stopped. He reached the list Potter copied and if he was correct in deciphering the handwriting, what Potter drank was enough to knock out a full-grown troll for weeks. Or kill a smaller one. Frankly, the fact that Potter was still conscious was a miracle in itself. – Please, for the love of God, do not tell me that last one on your list is the 86…
‘That I don’t know. All father said, is Voldemort used his blood and parseltongue. And that it might kill whoever tries to open this.’ He added quietly, looking at the floor.
‘Fit what exactly?’
‘Ideas?’
‘Hydro-what? I swear to God, Potter, you and your Muggle obsession…’ Draco rolled his eyes.
‘I cannot tell you that, Mr. Malfoy…’ Kingsley seemed suspicious. ‘But what I can tell you is that nothing was illegal during the proceedings.’
‘Hello, father.’
Draco couldn’t sleep that night. Why was every Potter’s touch burning him? Well, that much was obvious, he thought, it was still the lust that has resurfaced days prior. And the fact that it didn’t lead to an erection (
- Oh, like a cult of sorts?
‘Oh well, who do we have here…?’ Harry would recognize that snarl anywhere. ‘Fancy seeing you, Potter. It’s been what, five years?’
‘You can’t. I’m sorry. You’re supposed to be asleep anyway – how did you wake up? They gave you two doses of sleeping potion and you only slept four hours in total…’
‘Indeed, I have, young man. But why do you ask?’ She smiled politely at him.
‘I don’t know, how much does it say? I measured, added and then put some water in from the tap.’
What exactly is there to hide from? There is nothing, he just got a little lonely now that he couldn’t go out and hook up with the girls like he used to.
. ‘Instinct’ terrified him. Why would
‘Why? What are you talking about?’ Harry had a gut feeling what Draco was going to say next, but decided to keep his fiancée’s spirits up at all costs.
‘Oh, Draco…’ Harry forced Draco’s chin up. ‘If it’s just about the money, you don’t need to worry about this. I told you, I have some of my own, and we have a decent place to live in London, so we’ll manage. Maybe we won’t be able to go on lavish vacations every year, but it’s not like we’re going to be starving. And I have no problem with supporting us both, not even if it was permanent. You’ll be an excellent healer – you’ve been at the top of the class in Potions for all of Hogwarts, your N.E.W.Ts are excellent and you have one of the best charmwork I have ever seen. Honestly, you could give Hermione a run for her money and that’s all talent – I haven’t seen you practice anything since I’ve known you.’
‘Do we have any other choice? You’ve been running around Britain like a maniac for three months and we have nothing!’
Harry saw the group and his legs suddenly carried him in their direction. He stood over the Slytherins and hesitantly asked “Draco, can we talk in private?”. Draco threw one last warning glare at his friends and stood up to follow Potter around the lake.
- Harry, we shouldn’t rush this.
by Rita Skeeter – read the headline. The title was annoying by itself, but the fact that it was a piece by Skeeter made Harry nauseous as he began reading.
- You both realize I’m gay, right? – He decided to start slow.
‘And maim my face? No thank you.’ Now that the brief moment of dread has passed, Draco could focus on trying to sound as irritated as possible.
His definitely-less-than-pleasant conversation with Harry was still weighing on his mind, so Ron decided to walk to work. He could’ve easily apparated straight into the office, he got those kinds of privileges years ago, but he needed to clear his head, and besides the case seemed to have been stagnant for now, so it wasn’t like he was needed there.
- They’re not together. – Hermione said quietly.
Harry couldn’t look anymore. He closed his eyes and tried to focus on the real-life Draco still clinging onto him. He slid his hand underneath the blonde’s t-shirt and ran his fingers lightly along his spine. ‘It’s fine, it’s not your fault…’ Harry pressed his lips to Draco’s temple ‘they forced you, it’s not your fault… I’m here and I’ll stay with you… I love you, I always will, no matter what happens…’. He felt Draco’s whole body stiffening at the words.
‘And that groan wasn’t because you were annoyed with me spilling water everywhere?’ Harry smiled.
‘Remember what?’ Draco seemed to forget their exchange from 30 minutes prior.
‘Coincidence – yes, suspicious – no. If I was in on it, they would take me to travel with them, that’s one thing. I would be, well, I was, the perfect excuse for them, so they would want me everywhere they went to use me just as they did in that village.’
- I know. I told you, it’s rough out there. If it makes you feel any better, I think that with your looks you shouldn’t have a problem with finding yourself a spot in a high-end place. Looks are important, you know. You need to seem, well, luxurious, if you know what I mean.
It was almost a week later that he decided to try his hand at making dessert. Harry was sitting on a kitchen table, while Draco buried his nose in a rather impressive-looking volume he found at the bottom of one of the cabinets.
‘How do you think he even pulled that off?! After it took three days of deliberations to even get him acquitted in the first place? What was Kingsley thinking?’ Ron was in clear disbelief, shaking his head over a copy of
‘I think accidents sounds like a job for you, Draco’ Narcissa was beaming.
‘It hurts like hell…’ Draco whimpered. ‘What the fuck was that?’
‘And you topped it all off with a drug addiction.’ Potter remarked bitterly.
- Why do you think I always take this long to get out of the shower, silly? – Draco laughed and Harry felt enormous relief washing over him.
‘Never took you for a safety fanatic.’ Potter laughed and left.
‘But why? He didn’t do anything!’
‘When I told you what I did for a living in the Muggle world.’
- I think I understand. You gravitated towards her because she’s a strong person. On some level it must have been the same reasoning that led you to have this conversation with me of all people.
‘I don’t know! What if they say it was my idea?’ Draco was shaking now.
dangerous. And painful. And it needs assistance from someone else, which in your case poses a massive problem…’
- Oh, I think you can count at least two there, Seam. – Ron and Seamus were joined by Dean. – Or at least if we’re counting more distant history than just the last two weeks.
‘So this… micro-something, can we get it for ourselves? How do you even get your hands on it?’
‘Drinking. What does it look like?’
(See the end of the chapter for
, Malfoy…’ Ron was getting irritated. Stoned Malfoy was even more infuriating than sober Malfoy.
- Thank you Mina, you’re a godsent.
- Look what you do to me… - he moaned. – I… can’t… take… anymore… - Faking a scream, Draco threw his hands behind his head, clutching green curtains that were hanging from the ceiling and draping the headboard of his bed. Potter definitely liked what he saw, because the last few thrusts became much more forceful, almost violent. Draco felt his forearms hitting the headboard and drew out the remainder of the scream while Potter came inside him.
‘In the matter of accused Scherback, Windsor Arthur…’ Minister’s voice was grave and serious. ‘…the verdict is: guilty. Sentenced to 10 years in Azkaban prison. In the matter of Drapel, Maurice Joyce - the verdict is: guilty. Sentenced to 10 years in Azkaban prison. In the matter of Knight, Peter Hover - the verdict is: guilty. Sentenced to 10 years in Azkaban prison.’ There was a pause. ‘Before I announce the verdict in the matter of Mr. Malfoy, I need to say a few things. Please escort the sentenced parties out.’ Once Draco was the only one left, Shacklebolt ordered him to sit down.
‘Harry, please.’ Draco scoffed. ‘Do I really seem that over the top? No, I like my things to be simple, elegant and, above all, functional. I don’t need everything around me to be delicate and intricate, there’s no need for it.’
‘I’m not asking for a date. Was it at the beginning of you two living together or later?’
‘Mum, please…’ Draco groaned.
Harry grabbed the book Draco was working from and began to read. ‘Are you sure all the ingredients are there?’
‘Actually… I was kind of expecting your whole room to look like that.’
‘That was a fluke. There is nothing there. Wait, did you tell boss about this?!’ Harry was panicking.
- It’s cool Neville, thank you. I thought for a moment that maybe you were siding with Ron on this one, I’m sorry I assumed.
‘I was a whore.’ Draco froze. Despite what he told Harry, this was the last thing he wanted Weasley to know.
- Can’t tell you. We just need to be as far away from each other as possible.
- Oh, great, now the whole fucking Slytherin will know I’m some sort of a drug addict!
‘How do I function after this?’ Draco still not completely calm, but his expertise in compartmentalizing let him shove all he witnessed back into the darkest corners of his memory. ‘I don’t think about it. I just bag it up and pretend this never happened.’
He has already spent three days trying to locate victims of this rather heinous scam to interview them – so far, to no avail. He was almost ready to give up when he spotted an elderly woman in maroon robes walking along the only road in a small village Ron was planning to apparate back to London from. He sighed and decided to make one last effort – he didn’t really want to go back to his desk, not with Harry just beside him, sulking and not talking to him.
- I’m getting to it. So I was hiding practically all summer. I just wanted some peace, I didn’t want to be a leader anymore. – By now, all of Harry’s reservations were gone. He was entrusting all of his mental battles with himself in Draco. – I just wanted to be taken care of for once, not take care of people around me. I was hoping when I came back here I would have some peace and quiet for a change, but it didn’t last. When McGonagall roomed us together, I was furious and scared. I didn’t want there to be anymore confrontation, any more choosing sides. But it was all ok for a while, you know that. And then, after that last argument we had in the common room, it was like I was back at square one. Like the war never happened, like we were 6
‘Longbottom.’ Ron never used his real name during operations – it was routine for all Aurors to use aliases, but Ron was tired of making up names. ‘And thank you, you’re very kind. But I need your help, madame, if I am to succeed. I need all the information you can give me on this bloke you’ve been seeing that they say used to be a Death Eater.’
‘No problem.’ Harry smiled.
‘I needed time to think and rest. It was an intense case for me.’
‘Conspiring is contingent on intent. That means that if the Wizengamot finds that he did this TO protect you, at least in part, he would be found guilty of sabotaging and conspiring and that would most likely lose him the job.’
‘Who told you I don’t have feelings for you?’
made his brain come up with all sorts of mental images, each more lascivious than the previous one.
‘Ronald, you cannot quit.’ Harry knew it was serious when Hermione addressed her husband by his full name. ‘It’s only a temporary situation, they will choose a new Chief soon and everything will go back to normal!’
So this one is a little longer than the previous ones, but I couldn't figure out what to cut, it's all going to be important later.
‘Draco…’ he was panting, but nothing, besides how the blonde made him feel, mattered anymore ‘…take me.’
‘YOUR suspect, Ron. Not mine. That part of it is YOUR case and YOU are the one prosecuting this. I want no part of that. The rest of them? Bring them on, but as far as Draco goes, you’re on your own, mate.’
‘WHAT?!’ Harry jumped up.
‘It didn’t occur to you to come to your own partner to discuss your
‘And why did Mr. Malfoy send you that owl?’
And so one night, after Potter refused (again) to go to bed like a normal human being and leave him be, Draco sat down on Potter’s kitchen island and asked:
- Yeah, that sounds about right.
‘You… you love me?’ Harry whispered, breaking the silence that fell on the room following Draco’s confession.
- Maybe it’s easier that way. I’ve done a lot of self-reflection this past few days and I want you to know I’m sorry. I’m sorry for what I’ve done to you, it never should’ve happened. It was inexcusable, I swore I’m going to protect you and I hurt you. I was only thinking about myself that day, I realize that now. – Draco was crying. – I should’ve known it wasn’t true what I told you when I said I’m not violent. I am. It just comes out when I’m not controlling myself so I never saw it. I should’ve, after what I did to your friends, but I didn’t. I was kidding myself when I thought it was only because I was angry, I should’ve predicted that it would come out because of other things too. Because of how much I wanted you. I know you’ll probably never forgive me, but all I can do now is try to make you understand how much I hate myself right now. I have never felt this worthless. And I’m not worthy of you…
Draco gave Harry a small, barely visible, smile when they passed each other and Harry sat in the witness chair. His mind was completely blank, he was cold and panicking. He saw that Ron was white as a sheet, but otherwise he seemed determined. Harry didn’t know if he liked the look on his face.
‘With my mother.’ Draco said quietly, not raising his eyes from the tabletop. ‘She’s been, well, quite alone now that…’ He paused. It was clear he didn’t want to finish that particular thought.
- A list. – Potter seemed not bothered by the situation at all.
came back to him. He looked through the window – there was a couple holding hands, kissing, clearly saying their goodbyes at the bus stop. Suddenly, Draco felt furious – this wasn’t fair! Life was not supposed to turn out that way, he wasn’t supposed to end up all on his own.
‘Why…?’
It was only two days later that Draco finally brought himself to actually following through with his plan – it was surprising, because when the idea first occurred to him, he thought he was certain that’s what he wanted, what he needed to do, but the moment he actually decided on the method, doubts began to surface. What if there was some happiness in store for him? What if he was about to cross out any future he might be able to carve out for himself somehow? And why exactly was he planning to do this in Potter’s apartment of all places? It wasn’t like he had any deadline to stick to – he could very well wait until he was finally let out of the place, he didn’t need to scar Potter with his actual death any more than he already did with his ‘pretend’ one several months ago. That last thought proved disturbing – why was he concerning himself with what Potter felt anyway? They hated each other, they were locked together only because of the idiot’s boss’s bloody stupid decision to place Draco under house arrest and it’s not like they exchanged any words ever since the kitchen incident. No, he didn’t care how Potter felt about his death, it was just a matter of convenience and appearances – he was shunned all right, but he wasn’t quite hated like his parents were. And if he was to commit suicide (the longer Draco thought about it, the more it became clear that that’s what he was planning to do – and it was unnerving in itself) in Potter’s living room, the latter would surely spiral even more than the last time, and then Draco would be widely seen as the cause of wizarding community’s loss of their no. 1 hero. And that would lead to hatred. But then again, why would he care? He would be stone cold by then, so let the people think what they want, it wouldn’t make any difference to him.
duties until you are back from the dead, so to say. Now, Mr. Potter, will you agree to such an arrangement?’
- Guys, let the man talk! There’s respect to be shown for one half of our new Slytherin royal couple! – Zabini was trying not to laugh out loud.
- Oh, thank you for joining us finally, Princess! – Zabini sneered.
‘Marginally better. It doesn’t hurt as much, but my hand is still numb.’ Draco stood up. ‘Thanks, Longbottom.’
