So, here's the second chapter. I apologize if there's any mistakes left since English isn't my mother language and I don't have a Beta.
He looked at the girls and detailed each one of them. Hermione had smooth hair and was wearing a red dress that suited her perfectly, according to Harry. Ginny was wearing a short green dress and her hair was waving. Pansy was wearing a black dress and her hair was also smooth. Harry gave them a compliment and they all went down. The girls went down faster than him and soon, he found himself panicking slightly.
“DADDY!” Draco's blood froze as he recognized his daughter's voice. He had the bad feeling that a very bad thing was happening. He accelerated then. At that moment, Harry appeared above him, screaming in pain. Erin was flying at full speed right behind him, trying to catch him. Given the speed with which the girl was going, it was quickly clear in Draco's mind that she would never be able to not crash into the floor and judging by Alarik's yell in the stands, he had reached the same conclusion.
“Why are you smiling like this? You don’t smile like that, never” Pansy said as he entered his bedroom with a bright smile on his lips. She was lying on the bed and she has straightened herself on her elbows to look at him.
Harry didn’t have the time to think about it more, Ron was waiting for him to go down to eat.  They went down and came to Hermione who was talking with Ginny. They were blushing and giggling so Harry assumed they were talking about love or something. They recover quickly when they saw them and they all go to the Great Hall. They were walking slowly in a corridor when they heard footsteps, like people running. They looked around them, searching for the origin of the sound. Then, two little boys stopped in front of them. Three little girls came just after them. One of them, a redhead with blue eyes was jumping, looking victorious until she looked up at the four tallest. She stared at Harry first and then she looked at the other three. Then, she finally ran to Harry and wrapped her arms around his legs. Harry was very surprised, this little girl not more than five years old seemed to know him well, but for him, apart from his hair and eyes, which corresponded in every way to those of the Weasley family, he had no idea who she could be. One of the two little boys, a gray-eyed blonde who, astonishingly, reminded him of Malfoy, moved closer to Harry as well. He had a sulky pout on his face. He grabbed the girl by the shoulders and tried to pull her back.
“I... Voldemort started sending me pictures again... And probably read my mind and know for you because in those pictures you were dying” His voice broke on the last word and new tears ran down his cheeks. He tightened his arms around Draco while sniffing. The blond turned around and hugged him. He came to caress his hair, whispering comforting words.
“Oh, and call Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy, too” Harry asked. Dumbledore nodded, smiling as the door was knocked. Severus Snape entered, followed shortly by Sirius and Remus. They all stopped when Harry sank his hand in the bowl of candy and put a handful in his mouth. He turned to them, his cheeks swollen with the amount of yellow candy.
“I mean if you want to sleep here I can sleep in the Gryffindor’s dormitory” Draco froze as he understood that the other boy doesn’t want to sleep with him. He tried to hide his disappointment the best he could. He wasn't really surprised. Who would want to sleep with him? He was a fucking ex-deatheater after all. He went back to reality when Potter looked at him with his fucking too green eyes.
“And you, Aunt Mione and Uncle Ron found it around Dolores Umbridge's neck” Harry paled when he heard that.
“Hold on, hold on” Nath whispered as he stared at the wound under their hands. Once it was mostly closed, he lifted their hands and Jordan stopped screaming.
“Ah uncle Draco! Uncle Harry! You are there!” Harry stood up abruptly, not recognizing that voice. He turned to the door and saw four brown boys there. Draco dropped to the mattress, moaning.
“Well ... so I'm going to make dinner” With these words she left the room. Severus stood in front of them and pointed to Draco and Harry.
Everything wasn’t going so well on Harry's side. He was now aware that wanting to sleep in bed alone had not been his best idea. He felt like his blood was on fire and his brain was going to explode. He sat up with difficulty and took his head in his hands. He heard a groan of pain from the second bed of the room. He got up and walked extremely slowly to Draco's bed. He approached the side where the blond was and literally let himself fall on him. Draco gasped under the weight of Harry falling on him, but the well-being he felt when his skin touched Harry's skin quickly drove him away. He placed one of his hands on the neck of the brown while the other was on his back. Both sighed when all trace of pain disappeared from their bodies. Harry did not seem to be moving and that made Draco laughed.
“I knew it!” She exclaimed happily. The eleven children from the future laughed discreetly at her enthusiasm.
“Can anyone explain to me why this moron was sitting with us?” Ron asked, visibly angry. Only two pairs of lost eyes answered him. Hermione sighed, her problem still in her mind. Then, without warning, she got up hurriedly and ran away from the Great Hall. Harry and Ron stared at each other.
“It works for me” Lucius finally declared. Draco decided to leave the room, not wanting to hear how Harry would risk his life while he would be waiting for him. He went through his bathroom to take a potion to get the pain from his back and then went into the living room where an argument was taking place. When he reached the bottom of the stairs, he narrowly avoided a vase that crashed against the wall behind him. Finally, it was not a fight. The triplets were in the center of the room and made all the objects in the room fly around them. Lyra and Erin came to join him.
“Yes, yes, sorry Luce” Zephir apologized. Lucius widened his eyes at such familiarity. He sighed and grabbed Harry's arm before Apparating away. Harry nearly lost his balance when they all landed in a dark alley.
“So we all agree?” Sirius asked. The meeting finally took place and in fact the plan hadn’t progressed since the last time. They agreed, nodding their heads. Harry pretended not to see the glow that shouted "No" in the gray eyes of his soul mate.
When Harry opened his eyes the next day, he swore he had never slept so well. Like having a soul sister might not be that awful. He felt a second wave of happiness swirl in him as Draco stirred, a sign that he was waking up and Harry was convinced that this feeling did not come from him. He was suddenly in a need to talk to Hermione about this so he gently got out of bed and went to get dressed in the bathroom. When he came out, he saw Draco curled around his blanket, hugging it as he did with Harry a few moments ago. Harry silently left the room. So he found himself in the children's room where they all seemed to sleep deeply except Lesath who stared at him with his big gray eyes.
Maybe his room was safe from that too, but he still had some bad memories in it. Worse memories. He closed his eyes painfully for a second as a memory of him crying as he clutched his chest came in his mind. He opened his eyes and looked off in the distance as he brushed his fingers against the scars on his naked chest. That damn boy would be the end of him with his green eyes and his scar. Draco had tried to hate him. He really had tried. But who could hate Harry Potter, uh? The boy was a goddamn gift to the world. Always kind and smiling and fucking gentle.
The brunette pushed him away and stood up to him and Draco could see in his eyes that he was really hurt and angry.
“Yeah, okay” Harry whispered as he walked a bit closer to the bed. Draco looked up at him and he looked a bit frightened, his eyes a bit watery. Harry then went on the bed and pulled Draco against him. They stayed against each other for a long time. Harry was mostly sitting on one of Draco’s leg, his head was on Draco’s and his eyes were closed. He had an arm around his boyfriend’s neck as Draco had an arm around his lower back, his head against his chest. Their two other hands were joined between them.
“I mean Lucius, your father, walks around the castle and apparently is angry because he can’t find you” Draco blanched considerably.
“I don’t know what you're talking about” Draco said innocently and the sensation intensified. Harry gave a really indecent moan that made Draco shudder. He approached and turned Harry on his back and settled on his hips.
“Yes Ron, that's why” The redhead shook his head. Dumbledore cleared his throat, ending the exchange.
“I promise” He said, still laughing. He left the room, the three blondes on his heels. They left the apartment and headed for the hall. When they arrived, Sirius and Lucius were waiting for them.
When Molly had left, feeling much better, Draco had taken her place, seeming to be the only one able to calm Harry. That night, she allowed them to sleep together, and they held back to tell her that they hadn’t waited for her to do so.
“Where are we sleeping?” Emett asked, startling them. Nobody had heard him coming, he was getting it from their father.
Harry took a few steps back, feeling as if intruding on their intimacy. He bumped into Draco, who was standing behind him. Their hands linked automatically and they stayed there, watching their daughter and her boyfriend.
He smiled slightly. They finally arrived in front of the carriages. Harry, Draco, Ezekiel, Eleanor and Lesath took the last of the carriages. Harry began to relax. They then boarded the train and the trip was in a good atmosphere. Harry's stress soared when the train stopped.
He put the bottle down and walked to the door. When he opened it, his mouth fell open in shock and disbelief. Harry was standing there, his green eyes too bright behind his glasses. Draco noticed there were tear stains on his cheeks as well as some more tears ready to fall out of his eyes.
“Oh because it's Blaise now? You would tell me that you love Nott that I wouldn’t even be surprised” Hermione began to blush. He stared at her with round eyes.
He introduced a third finger into Draco's intimacy. The latter moaned harder when Harry touched his sore spot with his three fingers. After a little while, Harry withdrew his fingers and Draco groaned in discontent. The blonde knew right away why Harry had pulled away when he felt something much bigger at his entrance. He grit his teeth in advance, knowing that it was going to hurt. Harry penetrated him extremely gently. The brunet shook Draco faster, making him relax faster than he thought.
“But what are you waiting for? Tell him everything, you're not going to risk losing him to keep his gift a secret” Lyra told him.
“I’m sure he’s not, he got angry because of something else and yelled at you” Harry told his son, looking at Draco right in the eyes. “That was mean from him but I’m sure he regrets it and will apologize as soon as he calms down”
"That's an excellent guess, Sherlock." Harry burst out laughing and blushed under the inquisitive and questioning gaze of the eight adults.
Dimi and Zeph. Harry was sitting on the ground in another corner, Draco behind him. Draco’s head was on his shoulder and from time to time, he was whispering things in his ear.
“You’re such a moron!” Draco almost shouted. Harry only realized at that moment that he was really scared. He did not apologize for that. As Draco seemed about to kill him with his own hands, Harry grabbed him by the waist and threw himself into the water, taking the blond with him. Draco screamed, catching everyone's attention. They started to worry but seeing Harry rise to the surface laughing, they calmed down very quickly. Draco went back in his turn and Harry swallowed hard while looking at him. He had never found him as beautiful as he was now.
“It's because they're your children ... Coming from the future” Dumbledore said. His declaration was followed by a great silence. All the students of the present day were wide-eyed. Hermione was the first to reconnect with reality.
“Er ... To be more exact, it was you who got pregnant” Erin said. Draco didn’t really know why but it relieved him.
“Hm, hm” Harry said absently. Draco tightened his fingers around Harry's thighs to get his attention. The brunette turned his green eyes to Draco and gave him a smile. The blond questioned him with his gaze, waiting for Harry to explain what he was thinking. The brunette thought for a long time, then finally a desperate look appeared on his face.
“Me, Erin, Emett and Jordan are in Gryffindor. Lyra, Ezekiel, Zach, Joris and Alarik are Slytherin” Nathaniel replied. Harry nodded with a smile, proud that a majority of his children were Gryffindor.
"Come on, couldn’t you go kiss somewhere else? You block the passage!” A voice intervened in the corridor. The two blond brothers looked at each other.
“Yeah, Dad thought it was funny that his godchild was the godfather of his daughter and son” Alarik told him as he stepped closer. Draco slowly looked up at him, a mixture of shock and misunderstanding painted on his face.
"Please..." Draco sobbed his voice rasping as he thrust his hips up. Harry gasped and moaned loudly, his hand was speeding up around them, the pleasure becoming too much for the both of them.
“Firstly, because seeing you kissing my brother, well, what am I saying, seeing you devour his face, when I open my eyes is not what I call a good awakening! And I was scared because you're not supposed to be there” The door opened at that moment, letting in Dimitri.
“Morning, love” Draco said softly, placing small kisses all over his face. Harry's smile widened and he opened his eyes again.
“Repeating those three words won’t make him forgive you, Potter” Pansy said from behind Draco, startling him. What the fuck was she doing here. And why was she listening to them.
“Well, now that you're reassured, I'm going to ask you to get out” The nurse told Lucius and Narcissa. They reluctantly left the room. It was this moment that Draco chose to open his eyes. Harry gave him a relieved smile as he finally saw it.
“Skott and Isaak Black-Snape” One of them said. Harry was grinning, he knew one who was going to be happy. Harry started to get up to hug them, but Draco held him by the waist, remembering that the brunette was wearing only a boxer. The four boys smirked.
“If you ever feel bad, you just have to come over and scream at me, nobody will find that weird” He whispered in Harry's ear.
“Ron! Calm down, Irina and Isallys are sleeping” Blaise kindly reprimanded him. Ron seemed about to retaliate aggressively but he recovered.
“You always make that face when it happens” He laughed. Harry and Draco grunted, put on their clothes and went downstairs with the three boys outside the door. When they arrived, Molly looked at them oddly, as they were still laughing. She wondered why Harry was with them and especially, why the hell was he laughing?
“You pushed him away” Harry breathed, smiling with all his teeth at the blonde. The children asked nothing of their parents since it seemed quite obvious that the problem was indeed Voldemort.
Harry lay down, beginning to feel bad and not getting into the habit of Draco being a cure. He placed a hand on his head, a migraine taking place. Then he felt a hand resting on his hand and he felt immediately better. He opened his eyes and thanked Draco with a smile. Harry began to feel extremely hot, wearing a black T-shirt. He decided to remove it. He saw Nathaniel hopping in the water with Jordan and Lesath and was seized with a mad desire to go swimming too. He stood up and took off his pants and shoes. He turned to Draco, silently inviting him. The young blonde refused and lay down. Harry then went to join the three people already in the water and had a good time with them.
“Draco?” Harry called. The blonde moved out of the door and sat against the wall. Harry opened the door and opened his eyes wide, seeing Draco even paler than usual.
“What can you tell us?” Harry asked after clearing his throat. Jordan leaned over his friend's ear and seemed to offer him ideas. Nathaniel answered yes or no and chuckled tenderly from time to time. Ron seemed to be bored by Harry's side, while harry stared at what appeared to be a couple. Hermione turned the attention to herself when she ran like a fury towards the exit of the common room.
“I was going to lay you down on the bed” Draco groaned, but he still agreed to get up to eat. They advanced extremely cautiously in the corridors leading to the Great Hall. They didn’t meet him so they relaxed as they arrived, not expecting Lucius to sit with his wife at the teachers' table. Draco then allowed himself to grab Harry's hand and they intertwined their fingers. They didn’t notice the sound Lucius made while spitting out the contents of his glass while Narcissa didn’t seem frankly surprised.
“You don’t see it, right?” He whispered while Pansy meant him to shut up with her hands. Draco frowned, not understanding what was going on. ‘Potter obviously don’t love me, he’s a stupid Gryffindor so he would have told me’
“Would you be able to dream of my voice, little brother?” His brother mocked him. Alarik came forward laughing and came to hug his brother and Zach embraced Dimitri too.
“No, you'll know it in due course. All you have to know is that he doesn’t push you away” Ezekiel replied.
A high-pitched scream made Harry stand up suddenly the next day. He looked down at Draco, who was still sleeping peacefully, not at all disturbed by the roar. Harry pulled himself out of the blonde's arms and pulled on his pants quickly before heading to the door. He opened it on the fly and fell on a rather puzzling show. Jordan and Nathaniel were sitting on the bed of the last and seemed extremely tired and bored. In front of them, Lyra shouted at them under the amused laughter of their other siblings.
“Are you all right, gentlemen?” He questioned them. They both stared blankly, trying to assimilate the news that was falling on them. Malfoy came back to him first and looked up at the director.
“Because I'm gay and he’s sexy, besides being the most wonderful person I've ever met” Ron muttered, his voice muffled.
Harry was kneeling on the floor and looking under his bed when Draco came back from the bathroom to his room. He glanced around the room and stopped dead when he saw Harry's position. Now his eyes were on Harry, especially on his arse, and Ron was boggling at that sight. The redhead decided he'd better get out of the room when he saw Draco bite his lip and start walking into the room. No sooner had he closed the door, than Ginny and Pansy fell on him to drag him into the room opposite.
He put the girl back on the floor and took advantage of the fact that his boyfriend was busy hugging his godfather to slip into the room he had just left. He quickly crossed the room and leaned against the bathroom doorframe when he was hit by a stronger wave of pain than the others. He entered the bathroom as best he could and closed the door. He let himself slide against it, the room turning around him. He moaned when the pain increased again.
Harry woke up slowly, wrapping himself in the blankets and bringing the warm body close to him against him. He opened his eyes at once. His eyes fell on a pale neck. He then looked up a little more and saw hair so blond that you could not doubt their owner. Harry decided to analyze the situation before panicking. Already, they were both chest naked since he could feel Malfoy's back against his own chest and one of his arms was against the blonde's. Then Harry didn’t really knew where his legs were, too tangled to those of the boy next to him. He suddenly had a doubt and moved down the hand that was previously on Malfoy along his own body and was relieved when he felt he still had his boxer. A slight laugh made him turn his attention to Malfoy.
“Soul Mates” Harry explained. They widened their eyes and from what Harry saw, they continued talking with Draco.
He could barely think, pleasure was flooding all his senses. Leaving only the feeling of the hard cock deep in his ass. To be honest, that was the only thing he wanted to feel. He screamed when the boy behind him reached around and grabbed his cock. He wouldn’t last very long if Potter kept going.
“Do you really think you would have had children if Voldemort was still trying to kill you?” Nathaniel almost laughed at him.
“They’re ultra-powerful, and since they don’t use their powers that much, they have to evacuate them, otherwise their magic may explode and the castle with it” Lyra explained to him as if the conservation of the castle was not at stake.
They would need to talk about it, once Harry would be sober. They probably would need to talk about this more than once. Draco knew they would fight again. They were Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter after all. But, in Draco’s opinion, what they had was worth fighting for. Their love was worth fighting for.
“Yes, it started! And I would like someone to explain to me what's going on here!” Erin, who was in front of him when he screamed, came to sit between him and Ron and patted his back gently.
“These eleven children are yours, so I didn’t see any point in warning the whole castle” Draco nodded and the three wizards in the room left to find the others waiting down the stairs. Dumbledore took the lead and they all followed him. Harry had joined Ron and Hermione who were chatting with Nathaniel and his boyfriend. They walked a few minutes before the older one stopped in front of an empty wall. A door slowly appeared on the wall and the Professor McGonagall came out of it. With a wand, Dumbledore showed two statues representing the two founders. He walked over to them and pronounced the password.
“Move” Ezekiel ordered in a voice that seemed to be coming from beyond the grave. Joris let go of the girl and backed up to stand beside other three boys. Ezekiel slowly approached the redhead, a soft smile on his lips. Harry found that scary, really scary. He knew he was right when Ezekiel grabbed the girl by the collar and lifted her off the ground as easily as if she weighed nothing.
“I think the game will be tomorrow in the afternoon because we are Saturday tomorrow. So...” Erin could not finish her sentence. She was cut by a blow to the door. The door then opened on a Draco and a Harry kissing breathlessly. Harry slammed Draco against the closed door. He kissed his neck, nibbling at the thin skin and began sliding his hands under the blonde's sweater, who dropped his head against the door, leaving more access to his neck.
“It probably happened when you took my wrist this morning” Draco concluded. Harry nodded and he sighed. If this little cunt had not wandered in underwear in front of him, all that would not have happened. Or maybe it would not have changed anything.
“Are you hungry?” Eleanor asked, wishing to put an end to this embarrassed mood. They all sat down around the table and everyone was watching everyone. It was finally Ezekiel who broke the silence.
He understood her surprise, he always loved going to Hogwarts as a child, making his trunk weeks before he had to go. This time was different but he really couldn’t tell her why. He just couldn’t tell about this ridiculous little crush he had on Potter.
“That’ll do it” Nathaniel said as he knotted a piece of his shirt over the wound. Jordan was breathing hard. Nathaniel helped Jordan on his feet and held him close.
“For Merlin’s sake Dray! Why don’t you just tell him that you love him?” Pansy shouted, looking very tired of all this little game between the two boys.
“And the power of the spell that would be thrown by the triplets would blow up the Horcrux and the whole castle with it” Erin finished.
Draco couldn’t even remember what the fight was about. Something stupid probably. They always fought because of small and stupid things. He only remembered what Harry had said. These words that created a hole in Draco’s chest.
“It wasn’t Hermione” Dimitri rectified, stuffing a handful of cereals into his mouth, his feet on the table.
“Great idea” Alarik replied, running in with Joris. Erin turned to them and welcomed the kiss that Alarik placed on her lips. They then returned to the apartments, going to stand before the door of the room.
“I promise you” He kissed him one last time, longer. He turned away then and he left the room with a quick step.
“Irina! Let him go, he's my daddy… So it’s not you who should be hugged” Harry opened his mouth wide and his eyes widened, as did his three friends.
“Oh, I see” His mother said to Blaise with a knowing smile. “I’ll leave you to it then” She added as she left the room with a wink aimed in Draco’s direction.
The door to the room opened on the school nurse, followed by Draco's parents. Harry sat in the bed and was a pillow to a still unconscious Draco. Harry kept his hand in his fluffy hair. Harry frowned as he saw the nurse's cheerful look.
“They don’t want to say why the Horcrux attacked you all when you touched it, Harry” She said, a scowl on her face. Harry clearly saw a glimmer of understanding pass through Draco's gray eyes. He questioned him then but Draco just got up from the bed and left the room as if his worst nightmare was there.
“Then we thought of coming to see dad so here we are” The first finished. Dimitri ruffled their hair and then went back to his research.
“Nothing, everything is fine” He muttered. Draco was not fooled but he did not ask for more details and Harry was grateful. Draco let go and as he was going to talk, the door opened slowly, revealing eight heads. Harry allowed them to enter by the look. They entered, invading the room.
When others came to join them, he left them between them. He isolated himself while staying in the water and seeing Draco lying in the grass, he had an idea. The blond boy had also undressed, it was perfect for Harry's plan. Harry sent an image of himself drowning in to Draco before disappearing under the surface of the water. The blond opened his eyes and straightened up. He looked for Harry with his eyes but seeing him nowhere, he ran towards the lake. As soon as Harry felt the shock of Draco's foot in the water, he jumped to the surface, literally gushing in front of the blonde. The blonde jumped and would fall backwards if Harry had not held him back.
“Of course he knows” Everyone turned their heads toward Zach, who was standing against the doorframe. The tall young man spread his arms and everyone rushed into them.
“Maybe because that’s the truth, haven’t you thought about that?” Draco answered as he lay down his back on the bed. “And it was really great, as always” Blaise and Pansy looked at each other while Draco was staring at the ceiling.
“Are you telling me that I'm going to have to get a piece of Voldemort's soul in a necklace that Umbridge wears on her?"
“Well, they’re a bit too much, we’re not that powerful” Alya answered. Nathaniel suddenly stilled beside Harry, he was frowning. Harry was about to ask what was wrong when Nath apparated away.
“You seem to have disappeared, Uncle Harry” Dimitri said as he entered the room. Harry laughed, only the adults seemed to ignore Harry's whereabouts. The young man threw himself bluntly on the bed where Draco and Harry had previously been. He leaned closer to them.
“It's time for breakfast, Daddy.” The little one now had a big smile on his face as he stared at his two fathers. They had not moved and did not know what to say to the boy. He then stepped forward and grabbed the hands of the two boys and ran out of the room, pulling them behind him. They both looked incomprehensively at the other occupants of the room. And they just shrugged and laughed. Harry stopped suddenly.
“Don’t you think it's nice that they love their sons even if they haven’t had it yet? I mean, it's like they have that natural paternal instinct with their children. As if deep inside they knew it was their son” Ginny whispered. Pansy turned her head to Ginny, she was not wrong, she was perfectly right to say it all.
“Oh thank you Merlin, you're fine!” He exclaimed. Then he went away, ignoring Draco. Harry sighed, at least he had not tried to hit him or insult him. He was then assaulted by his six children, who were visibly afraid of losing their father. Draco was added to the family hug and Harry felt a whiff of happiness coming into him: he had a family, and this family was the most perfect of all.
“I missed you”  He grinned as he ruffled their hair. The three blondes pushed his hand back as best they could. Harry saw that Lucius was going to intervene again so he cut him off.
“ For fuck’s sake! Why are you screaming like that?” Draco then turned his eyes to the redhead and all his anger seemed to want to move towards Ron. He looked down at Draco's arm where Harry's hand was. It was a simple precaution, to avoid any loss of consciousness since when Draco was out of the room for a few moments to put his sweater on in his own room, he was paler than death and Harry was not in a better state. They had decided not to go too far and stay in touch as much as possible until they knew more.
“Me and Ezekiel are not just twins, we're tripled with Alya” Harry and Draco were a little relieved to hear that there was just another kid.
“Where are the other?” Ezekiel asked when he saw that the room was empty. Harry didn’t answer and hurried to the next
“Shut the hell up Potter, I'm not worried.” His look and tone were really threatening and when Harry wanted to take a breath to answer him, he almost choked. Malfoy pulled his arm out of Harry's throat.
The discussion stopped immediately and everyone stared at him. He widened his eyes and blushed instantly despite the sweet sensation that was still spreading in his brain and slowly invading his whole body. He got up and hurried off to his room. He threw himself face down on the bed in vain hope to make disappear the erection that it had provoked. He felt that the same feeling was growing and he began to moan. Time passed and he moaned louder.
“The newcomers you see are not just newcomers. You’d probably noticed that they looked like some of you, like Miss Granger for example. So it isn’t for nothing, it's because they’re your children ... Coming from the future”
“Let’s find out” Harry said as he extended his arms to him. Emett wrapped his little arms around his neck and Harry got up. Emett was rather small for his age, looking more like an eight years old than an eleven years old. Harry held him against him as he went down the stairs.
She was Pansy and Ginny’s daughter. One of the older was Lorelyn, Lilith and Lena’s sister but she had brown hair. Then, there was Maël and Kyllian who were 11 and 13 and were Dean and Seamus’ sons. They looked like Dean. Eliott was 13 and Remus and Tonks’ son. The last one was Léane, she was 13 and looked just like Hermione. They all got up and Harry helped Léane up. She thanked him with a smile and then stood next to him, looking at her feet. She looked shy, Harry found this cute.
“We'll have to do the meeting later” The blond apologized, taking Harry out of the room. He pulled him up in his arms when he almost fell down the stairs. Harry wrapped his legs and arms around him and fell asleep on the way to the apartment. Draco finally gave the password and he entered the noisy living room. All those present in the room were silent as he entered the room.
“Uncle Sev!” Draco smiled and grabbed Harry's hand. He pulled hard and Draco was found against him, their hands between their torsos. The brown man's gaze suddenly became serious.
"What is it?" He heard in his head. Harry looked up at Draco, not quite sitting in front of him. "I succeeded?” Harry nodded. Draco seemed extremely proud of him.
“Ah Harry, you're here! I'd like to talk to you about something serious” He nodded, ready to listen. “My behavior has been unacceptable these past few days and I'm really sorry, sweetheart” Molly whispered, tears in her eyes. Harry didn’t know what to do or what to answer.
He looked down and saw his son, an air of pure panic on his face. He stooped down and took him in his arms, stalling his head in the crook of his neck. It was at this moment that Harry realized that one hand was still holding his hand and that it was not Lesath’s. He turned his head to Malfoy after looking at their joined hands. The latter had just made the same observation and they dropped their hand in haste, their cheeks red. Ron passed in front of them, looking furious, and he descended the stairs with a furious step. Harry, Hermione and Malfoy stared at each other, not understanding the situation. Then the door opened again, allowing Zabini to pass, who seemed much calmer. He laughed lightly as he saw them all in front of his door, Harry's and Malfoy's children being out of the way too.
“Granger! Your little speech is useless. We didn’t wait for you to make peace and we get along very well, don’t we, Harry?’ Draco cut her, ruffling Harry's hair at the end of his sentence. Harry smiled to approve his words. Hermione looked at them each in turn and was finally quite convinced so she grabbed the book and went upstairs. Harry didn’t move, frozen by Draco's hand in his hair. It wasn’t until then that he realized that yes, the situation had definitely changed between him and Malfoy. After all, sleeping and having children with someone, even in the future, it brought them closer.
“Yeah, Em’s kinda sensitive when it comes to our family” Lyra said with a quick smile. Harry smiled back. Joris then came rushing toward them and pulled Lyra up by the waist and flew out of the room.
“On the other hand, I'm sure Granger would agree to do it for us” Harry immediately straightened and turned to his friend, eyes bright.
“You could not block us, we are the triplets of the most powerful pair of Soulmates that ever existed” Alya explained casually. Draco and Harry could clearly see Dumbledore's eyes sparkling as Lyra smiled as she rolled her eyes, those three boasted all the time.
“It's because of Grandpa Lu” Draco and Harry froze and as one man leaned back and saw Lucius and Narcissa at the teachers' table. Lucius wore a sadistic smile and gave them a small wave as Narcissa grinned at his son.
“These kids look happy and seem to have a loving family.” Harry frowned and moved a little closer to see what was going on in the room. As a result, he was almost completely stuck to the blonde's back. He shuddered at this contact and found himself closing his eyes. In front of them, Lyra, Nathaniel, Ezekiel and Emett were sitting in a circle on the ground and Lesath was sitting in the center of this circle and chatting happily with his brothers and sisters. Harry smiled without being able to stop at this scene.
“Are you deaf? He said we were going to eat.” Ezekiel interjected, catching all eyes. Blaise smiled and approached the blonde. He ruffled his hair as he passed and laughed.
“Thank you” Draco whispered, who had felt bad too. Narcissa's eyes widened and her mouth formed a perfect "O".
"I feel all your tiredness, Harry, you should sleep" The brown man didn’t protest, he moved closer to Draco and put his head on his shoulder, closing his eyes.
“I’ve read something about it” Hermione, sitting in front of Harry, told them. Draco was still red and Harry could hear him mutter. It seemed to be a lot of fun for Lyra, sitting next to Hermione. “I’ve read that there were risks of violent nightmares”
“You want me to calm down? Are you kidding! You dare to fall in love with this idiot Nott and I have to calm down?” The idiot opened the door at this moment. He looked like he was about to kill Ron even though some redness had appeared on his cheeks.
“That’s impossible, he just want to fuck me because I’m perfect. Yeah, that’s obviously like that. There’s no love in our meetings, I’m sure of that. And he tells me that he doesn’t love me each time and he’s a Gryffindor so he not tells lies and…” he spoke all by himself while pacing the room back and forth under his friend’s eyes. Pansy stood up and stopped him as he seems to go insane.
“What are you waiting for to take her in your arms? It's pretty obvious that she really regrets and thinks you are her own son, and I also know that she really cares about you"
“So how do you take your pregnancy?” Joris asked, whispering. Draco's eyes widened as he stared at the blonde.
“Yes, and that’s the problem actually” The second blond one said as he was looking with slightly panicked eyes at Harry.
“five, in fact” They all turned to that voice. He was a tall young man, with hair as black as ink and electric blue eyes. Harry was captivated by the color of his eyes that didn’t look natural but was beautiful. The triplets rushed towards him and threw themselves into his arms. When the three blondes parted, the boy held out his hand to Harry.
The girl rushed to her two brothers and the triplets hugged each other for a long time. Draco suddenly felt his head spinning. He frowned, it was barely more than ten minutes since he had touched Harry. He went to the stairs and immediately went to their bathroom, where Harry was. He found him sitting in the bathtub, the water running over him abundantly.
“Oh, that's right, my name’s Zephir and I'm your son” Draco nodded, staring at the young man's too blue eyes. “It's my magic that makes my eyes look like that” Draco nodded again.
The next day, when Harry opened his eyes, he had an incredible headache. He straightened up hardly in his bed and laid his bare feet on the ground, which sent a cold draft into his body and slightly calmed his headache. He rubbed his eyes and jumped slightly when the bathroom door opened and closed abruptly. He opened his eyes at once, ready to violently reprimand the jerk who had dared to make his headache worse. But he was shocked when his eyes fell on Draco Malfoy coming out of the bathroom, only wearing a towel around his waist. His hair was still wet and drops of water were streaming down his finely muscled chest. Harry was staring at the blonde and Malfoy finally realized it. He stared at him too.
“The more beautiful are the triplets” He continued. Harry tugged on the word. Triplets? Which triplets? He glanced at Draco, who was pale. He wanted to ask the question but a fight broke out.
“I’m sorry, Harry, I didn’t mean to yell like that, I was scared” Harry decided that it probably wasn’t that much of a big deal. He knew the truth about the wall because he tried himself but Draco didn’t know. And the story was hard to believe in itself.
Harry concentrated with all his might to not yawn at the late or rather early hour. Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy wanted to meet the children that night. In the living room, there was only Harry, Draco, their seven children, Lucius and Narcissa. In fact, most children slept, even if they had stayed. Lesath slept in Harry's arms, Emett had his head on his knees and his legs were lying on the end of the sofa Harry had enlarged. Ezekiel and Nathaniel were sitting between their parents and Ezekiel had his head resting on Draco's shoulder while Nathaniel had his on Harry’s. Lyra was sitting next to Draco and was not sleeping yet. Erin slept, her head on her sister's shoulder, and Ascella had her head on Draco's lap.
“Yes you're right, please go on” He gave a small smile to his boyfriend, beating his eyelashes excessively. The latter shook his head exasperatedly but he couldn’t help but smile. He turned his gaze back to the brunette.
“Why didn’t you came back from the interview with Dumbledore? And why did Granger have that blond kid in his arms? And why…”
“Sincerely, Sev, she'll end up knowing it. There are three of us here to be blond with green eyes and she's not stupid” Ezekiel cut him off. Severus could only agree, so he told them to be careful and went off with all the other adults.
Molly was standing on the doorstep with her mouth open, her eyes wide and a pile of broken plates at her feet. She stared at them with a horrified look.
He decided to watch them for a few more moments, he really liked to see his brother so happy. As Jordan winced, bringing a hand to his forehead, Nathaniel took a flask out of his pocket and handed it to him. Ezekiel finally decided to leave them alone, after all, they were not indispensable. He went up the steps four by four and went back into the bathroom.
“Increased powers, remember?” Nathaniel simply replied to his boyfriend. He nodded, trying to catch his breath.
“No wait!” The redhead yelled as Ezekiel was about to smash her against the wall. A smug smile appeared on the boy's lips as he rested her softly on the floor.
He just nodded. He then felt Harry move slightly, moaning. He looked down at him and saw that he was frowning in his sleep. He thought that he was having a nightmare and when the image of Harry's broom being hit by lightning came into his mind, he knew he was right. Apparently they could also share their nightmares. He looked for a soothing and happy image to impose on Harry's mind to replace his nightmare and he opted for them both hugging their six children in a collective hug on the Quidditch pitch. The brunette's face relaxed immediately and Draco was delighted to have managed to chase away his nightmare.
“Harry? Everything is fine?” Harry looked up at Hermione and she could see he was strangely pale. He put his head in his arms and she let him rest for the next two hours. Harry winced when the bell ringed, making his head hurt. He stood up slowly, his legs shaking, and headed for the exit, accompanied by Ron and Hermione. The more minutes passed, the weaker he felt. He felt he was going to fall but two pairs of arms held him back. He looked at both faces and felt a wave of relief when he recognized Nathaniel and Ezekiel.
“Draco?” The man raised his head to her and she gave him the little girl in her arms and went back to Ginny.
“I don’t love you either” He huffed in voice as cold as he could muster, but Potter was already undressing him.
“So you five are our children? To Potter and me?” Lyra smiled at these words, if her father already thought of them as their children, it meant that he was not really against ending up with their other father. And it was a huge positive point. The five children nodded. Lesath was snuggled in his sister’s arms and began to fall asleep.
“That's right, except that you seem to have a bad tendency to fight at that time, so we wanted to make sure you stayed whole” Alarik replied with a smile that Harry described as insolent and provocative. The two blond brothers told them to go to the living room before Draco choked someone. They went down the hall and then down the stairs and finally arrived in the living room well filled. In one corner of the room, the five children played with magically animated little cars, laughing with their crystalline laughter. Lyra was in front of the library, probably looking for a good book and Emett was sitting on the carpet in front of the fireplace, staring at the flames. Hermione and Theo were reading a book side by side on a couch. Blaise was leaning against the back of their couch and reading over their shoulders, alternating between Hermione's book and Theo's. Ron was standing in a corner and just watching everyone. Ginny and Pansy were sitting with the five little ones and playing with them. Harry went to sit next to his best friend. Draco went to stand next to Blaise, and the four teenagers settled on the floor in front of the couch. Harry waited a long time but receiving no explanation about his loss of consciousness and awakening near Malfoy, he decided to ask.
Draco and Harry planned their ceremony for December 1st securing their date with Kingsley himself. Marcus Conned Hermione Into Marrying him the Next week after the announcement. During the Chaos of that week Malfoy Manor remind unchanged a refuge for the Family as the Wizarding world Imploded in anger and Hate.
"Good Hermione thats perfect, Did he hurt you during the repeated rape?" Sue squeezed Hermioen's hands again.
After a moment of tasting her sweet lips on his, He knew he could not live without them. He pulled away from her to look at her face, her eyes were dark with passion and her cheeks were flushed.
His handsome eagle Owl took off Draco sighed, taking one small moment then turning from the room and left.
"Wonderful! Hermione I think you should start with how you felt." Gloria prompted Hermione sat her cup down and fiddled with her fingers, taking a deep breath she pulled her head up to look at Marcus.
"Now I didn't say that. What I'm saying is if the poor mite is going to end up a Black name he should either carry the Black surname or the Malfoy name." Draco smirked at the shocked jaw dropped face Harry was giving him.
"Good I have not missed much, Now the reason Marcus is Going to act as your Pureblood escort is that we need to make it look like the Weasley family is out of touch with you and may chose their Son over you, This ploy while frowned on is the only way we have of getting Ron in Azkaban along with Molly and Ginny. Wizarding law is not on your side, Before we get into it is there anyone you would like to leave?" Sue asked.
“Wait, what's the connection between being one of Dray and Harry's triplets and the fact that you opened that door without any problem?” Theo asked, pulling his head back from behind the shower curtain.
“He's fine, he's got a spell that opened him and drained half of his blood, but we closed the wounds so he just has to rest” Lucius interjected calmly. Draco nodded again.
“Harry, it's horrible... oh by Merlin!” He exclaimed, seeing his best friend only in jeans, Draco between his thighs. Draco moaned in frustration and straightened up. He sat on the bed and looked around the room for their T-shirt. Harry cleared his throat, uncomfortable.
“Without being indiscreet, where are you from?” The two boys stared at each other behind Ron's back, seeming to have a new conversation at a glance.
“Merlin knows why” Theo muttered in his corner. The children glared at him all at once and he raised both hands in surrender.
“I love you Draco” Harry said, chuckling again. Draco took one of the sweets and put it in his mouth.
“Godfather? Can we go see Dad?” She asked the blonde. The latter nearly choke on discovering he had a godchild.
“Lyra, is that it?” She just nodded, urging him to continue. “Lyra said that Emett, I believe, and that Lesath were his little brothers. But one is Potter's son and the other is Draco's, there's something wrong.”
“Are you crazy?” Draco exclaimed as he sat up, his eyes wide open. “I’m not going to say anything, Pansy” She sighed and sat up too.
“It feels good to see you again, uncle Siri” Sirius's eyes widened. Remus asked them to return to the classroom as the other students arrived, thus preserving their privacy. Before they all got in, Draco held Harry by the arm.
“You will never imagine what just happened, Eh! What are you doing?” Ron asked as he entered the room as if it belonged to him. Draco, in a pure instinctive movement, had rocked them down the bed, Harry sitting on his hips then. Draco had his teeth planted in his hand to avoid moaning and Harry had his mouth open and his eyes closed.
“It's our magic that protects us because when we're together, our powers are more powerful so our magic changes our appearances so that nobody knows we're triplets” Alya explained. Draco and the others were amazed by this ability. Draco then pulled Harry up in his arms and he went upstairs to their room. He put Harry in one of the beds and sat down next to him, biting his nails. At the end of what seemed like an eternity, Harry finally opened his eyes.
Harry looked away as the Professor Snape stood in front of him, blocking his view. He prepared himself to receive a sharp remark from the adult but the sound of someone knocking at the class’ door saved him. The professor sighed in exasperation, the savior saved, that was comical.
“Harry?” The dark-haired man looked up at him and Draco could see his bright eyes and tears on his cheeks. He strode over to him and tried to take him in his arms.
“He’s scared of coming back. You know, seeing Potter, all that kind of thing” He said as he rolled his eyes at Draco.
“Very nice highs, Draco” Hermione complimented, stopping next to them. Draco’s face became a pretty red color while Theo giggled.
“No, Potter, I’m not gonna read this for you” Harry's gaze became desperate so Draco decided to help him and leaned in his ear.
“Get up boys!” Molly exclaimed in a voice that Draco found very unpleasant as she entered the room. She made a movement with her wand and the light came on suddenly. The three Slytherins straightened together as Harry lay flat on the floor.
“I don’t love you, Malfoy” Potter whispered before he pulled his clothes off. Draco nodded, his Adam’s apple bobbing, and cursed himself for being so weak. He should have stopped this unhealthy relationship months ago. It wasn’t even a relationship. It was just some fucking sex meeting. He noticed the other man watching at him, waiting for an answer at the silent question.
Harry's mouth formed a perfect "O" and he felt guilty. Then finally, he imagined the scene and he found it really funny so he burst out laughing. Draco gave him an amused smile as he felt the body beneath him shook with spasm. He laughed too, putting his head on Harry's chest. It was that moment that Ron chose to enter the room. He winced as he saw Draco on Harry and headed for his bed.
“I may be drunk and half asleep but I want you to stay. You might not want it, that would be pretty logical, actually” Draco laughed.
“Excuse me, Professor” Hermione began. “Where are we exactly?” Dumbledore smiled gently and cleared his throat.
“Why not you, Ezekiel?” Draco asked, rather uncomfortable knowing that Horcrux was running in Harry.
“We planned to meet in the Chamber of Secrets to discuss the explosion and horcruxes as soon as they are awake” She informed him before leaving. He then went in search of Sirius. He carefully descended the stairs and was surprised to see that the debris had all disappeared.
“So...how do you take it for you and Granger?” His friend turned a surprised look at him and then glanced at Hermione, in the stands with Lyra, Eleanor and Alarik.
“Well, let's go” And with these words, they had all gone to the bedrooms and gone to bed without anyone saying a word more.
“Dad wants us to help him make our other daddy fall in love with him” Jasper explained, sitting on the same shelf as his brother.
Potter parted those beautiful lips of his and Draco felt his dick slide slowly into that hot, slick mouth. Potter curled his tongue around Draco and he started to suck him hard, cheeks hollowing and taking him deep. The brunette sucked him so beautifully. ‘Merlin, how the fuck does he know how to do this so well?’ The thought crossed Draco’s mind briefly before giving into the sensations surrounding him. He moaned loudly when Harry’s tongue slid into his slit on top of his dick, tonguing him as his fingers caressed Draco’s testicles. ‘Oh Merlin, this is so good’, is all Draco can think. The blonde slid one hand into Potter’s unruly hair while the other pressed against the wall behind him to prevent his trembling legs from giving way to the ground.
“Who are you exactly?” Ron asked them roughly. The two concerned looked at each other and appeared to have a silent conversation for a few seconds.
“I'm not going to hurt you, just tell me why you did that and what exactly did you do?” He heard the redhead swallow loudly.
“In pairs, you will practice spraying yourself with unformulated spells” The duets formed quickly. Harry and Ron, Hermione and Neville, Draco and Blaise and Pansy and Theo. The teacher let them started and Ron threw an expelliarmus to Harry. When Harry took his wand, for the first time in a while, it was reduced to ashes. He found himself with a pile of dust at his feet. He then followed his instinct and reached out his hand in front of him. A barely visible force field formed in front of him and Ron's spell rebounded on it and flew his wand that landed right in Harry's second hand. Ron looked at the brunette, totally amazed. Harry looked at Draco and saw a pile of ashes similar to his at his feet. Draco obviously did not have Harry's instinct and was trying to avoid Blaise's spells, which seemed to have a gift for the uninformed. Other Slytherin students, having noticed that Draco could not defend himself, began to approach him, looking menacing. Draco tried to defend himself by threatening them, promising them a thousand sufferings. But nothing worked, they raised their wand. Harry felt his fingers itch and when he looked at them, he saw sparks at the end of his fingers. He approached and placed himself in front of Draco. With his left hand, he made a shield appear all around them and with his right hand he expelled all the Slytherins, who had just cast spells, at the other end of the room with a simple movement of the hand. He then lowered the shield and challenged all the others to attack him.
“Are you all right, Harry?” He nodded to reassure her and even added a smile. He looked around for Draco and was disappointed to see him nowhere. Lesath ran to him and Harry received him as best as he could. Fortunately, Nathaniel who was behind him held him back, preventing him from falling.
“Not at all! Everyone knows it's Erin” Alarik shouted. The people concerned looked at each other with dismayed glances. Zachady got up and punched the table.
"Go against the wall, please" Harry asked mentally. Draco complied and headed for the far wall, taking Hermione with him. The other children also stepped back, so Harry found himself walking alone toward the library while the others held their breaths on the other side of the room. A second cry came as Harry was against the library. He thought he recognized Emett's voice. He didn’t have time to think about it any longer as an explosion blew up behind the wall and propelled Harry through the room. Draco squeezed Hermione's hand violently as a violent pain spread throughout his body. He fell to his knees, shouting. Hermione scooted down in front of him.
Zachady had a moment of panic when he saw that his uncle Harry had disappeared from the room but was reassured when he saw him reappear a good half hour later, a smile stretching his lips. As expected, the children watched over their parents and while Pansy and Ginny laughed at the slightest opportunity because of their drunken state, the other six were still quite sober.
“You're so unbelievable” Draco breathed before pulling Harry to him by pulling on his T-shirt. He laid his lips on Harry's in a soft kiss. Finally, they both jumped into the opening. Harry easily guided Draco to where the children were. He froze in front of the show in front of them. Lyra and Eleanor were tied up and gagged. Harry's eyes widened in horror and his paternal instinct took over. Before Draco could see it, he apparated directly into the living room of the apartment. He heard a squeak and footsteps rushed to the floor. A wicked smile spread on his lips as he began to advance like a predator towards the stairs. Ginny ran down and blocked his way.
Harry frowned but stood,  kissed Hermione on the forehead and left the Room, Bill passed Altair on to Draco as everyone else filed out of the room.
"Well the trial is over Ronald Weasley has been found guilty by this court and his punishment was Death, as for restitution for the Lady Miss Granger is allowed what remains in his Vault should you wish it." The CW looked at Hermione with a soft look as if glad Ron fell.
"From their interaction it was as Bones said he was worried about her, He did make it prevalent that any issues regarding her were to be brought to him. He wants to do good by her. I felt no ill will from the man towards her." Marcus nodded.
"Welcome home Mione, I'm just down the hall if you need me. Get some sleep." Harry backed out of the room, closing the door and leaving her to the blue room.
"You are safe, Hermione Lord Malfoy has insisted on extra security measures around the Manor. Hush, it's ok please I just have a few more things I need to ask." Sue tried to sooth the sobbing witch.
"I hope your plan works Harry, We goaded her into a lot today. How will Marcus respond?" Gloria asked.
The News of the marriage Law hit the Wizarding world like a tsunami it raged for weeks after the announcement. Of the Unwed Weasley men Only Charlie was unable to find a fiance in a week, George had popped the question to Angelina the next day, Percy had finally confronted his long time crush Oliver Wood and told him everything to his shock Oliver swept Percy up and kissed him then dragged him directly to the Ministry and had the minister marry them.
"That means a lot to her, Harry. She's always going on about how we should have helped you sooner and that you didn't deserve this and that and continually refuses to talk about anything else. Not that I minded I always wish I'd have been braver during the war wish I could have helped you." He laid Harry on the bed speaking gruffly. Harry had passed out the moment his head touched the pillow. Draco stood back glancing down and the broken once proud Boy-who-lived- to-kill-The-Dark-Lord, the Harry Potter he once knew was gone or so the Malfoy heir thought or maybe it was him that changed he knew the war took a lot of his pride and hate but didn't think it extended so far that he would pick up a stranger and bring him here he hadn't known it was Harry Potter until he'd wiped sweat from the forehead of the gaunt boy.
"Then that is all that we can ask for, come lets take you into a bathroom and get you cleaned up a hot bath and a fresh dress. For now you are welcome to any of my clothes as you need until you are well enough to be escorted to the shops." Cissy said generously standing Helping Hermione to her feet and to the double doors. Cissy opened them and showed Hermione the large wide Back of Marcus Flint his wand at the ready. Hermione blinked as his wand disappeared up his sleeve and he stepped out of the way bowing to her and Cissy as they walked out.
They didn't spend longer then necessary at the bank they happily ventured back to the alley and to Olivanders.
Hermione paused for a moment to look around the little table at the faces of what was Harry's new family, Her new family if she allowed herself to have it.
"We thought you would like a visitor, Percy declared he was first and well when push came to shove he literally jinxed the others to their chair. But felt the whole clan was a bit much for you to handle at once." Harry laughed a bit bitterly.
" You make it sound like you are jealous of him?" Harry's tears had subsided but lingered on his cheeks Draco raised his hand and brushed them away absently.
Draco read the short missive aloud to the sitting room Full of Weasley's, and the whole of his family.
"I see, Well then I owe you Thanks It will make having to testify much easier to have you and Mrs. Malfoy with me." Hermione replied, making a valiant effort of a smile to the Dark haired man, He did not speak further but made a courtly bow to her instead.
He woke feeling a soft bed under him, soft sheets. He was warm for the first time in a few years. His first thought was the baby he sat up eyes wide searching but his head swam and he groaned.
"Yes I would like to get to know him as a person, All I really do know is how caring and gentle he can be." Hermione nodded.
"No Kings It was my Fault I trusted him and turned my back, you kept them looking for me even when everyone else gave up on me. You will never understand what that means to me." Hermione sniffled pulling from Kingsley's arms she dabbed her eyes with Marcus' Handkerchief she still held.
"Thank you. He will be paid handsomely for his time I insist. Susan I'll write when Hermione is well enough to make a statement, Will our memories be enough to convict Ron?" Draco smiled at the elder Weasley who rushed back to the floo.
"Are you ready to go Harry?" He asked green eyes met his the surprise that flashed through the green orbs confused Draco.
"No need to thank me Harry I've already inquired about a family for the child for now he can stay here as well. Do you feel up to some food?" Draco asked nodding slightly as he let Draco help him down a short flight of stairs and into the kitchen and helped him sit down and Harry ate the most wonderful porridge he'd ever had in his life. He could only manage a quarter of it before he felt full.
" Gram love! Bye bye! " The tot giggled happily shifting his hair color From Malfoy Blond to Potter Black and looking at her with Remus' Amber gaze.
" 'So moments pass as though, they wished to stay. We have not long to love. A night. A day...' " Marcus quoted.
"Yes he wants to see for himself how you are, he's been worried." Sue nodded and Hermione glanced at Marcus.
"Perhaps Harry blocked the beating out himself that could explain it. The mind is a complex thing capable of defending itself in ways we will never understand." Draco said offhandedly Susan nodded and fell silent.
"I think what hurts the most is that no matter how hard I fight and try no good comes from opposing it." Hermione sighed.
Hermoine woke from a magical Coma a Month later, Madam Pomfrey expedited Hermione's healing as much as she could. Hermione had been severely underweight and that did not bode well for the rest of her Healing. She had woken and spent two full days bored in bed.
" As much as I would love to tell you everything I think for right now it can wait this once who know's what condition Hermione is. I will be happy to tell you everything as we also still have to hear from your wife and daughter."
Harry was nervous about leaving the security of Malfoy Manor, but was happy to be shopping for Altair he would ensure the baby get spoiled between him and Cissy the boy would be worse than Draco ever was and that thought made Harry beam with joy. Altair would have everything Harry lacked, he already had three doting parental figures who all loved the small baby, and now they were going to buy everything the kid would need. Harry was vibrating with anxiety waiting for Draco by the floo Altair cooing happily in his lap he bounced the tot on his knee he couldn't help but think of Teddy his sweet Godson worlds away from him Harry let a small tear run down his cheek. Cissy watched him from her chair she could almost see what he was thinking she vowed to have a chat with her sister immediately once the boy's were gone she would not let her child hurt any more. She was Dowager Malfoy she was a force of nature where her children were concerned even Bella backed down from her , she may be the youngest Black sister and the prettiest but she could be more calculating then Dromeda and crueler then Bella when provoked. And she was pissed that her sister had cut her new son from his godson's life. Draco walked in glancing at his seated family the sad countenance of Harry to the pure fury rolling off his mother.
"A bit Stunned at the trial by combat, but she seemed almost happy he was gone. Her posture changed when he went down. I think it was relieving for her to be rid of him completely." Marcus replied, tucking the piece of cloth into his pocket.
"We can still go when you are better. I'm sure we could convince Cissy, Andromeda, and Fleur to take care of the kids here together, you, me, Draco, Marcus, and Our Weasley brothers will destroy Thorpe Park. But you still have to ride the coaster as promised."Harry laughed.
"Lay back the infant is safe as are you, you're suffering from both magical and physical exhaustion, you're also on the verge of starvation, also a serious case of malnutrition , when was the last time you had anything to eat?" A soft deep voice asked gently the speaker a Wizard by the Magical exhaustion comment.
Harry led her past the room she had woke up in a few days ago and to the Family portion of the house and into a large room all done up in her favorite periwinkle blue tones this was her dream bedroom.
"Harry, you saved the boy first if anyone has the right to give him a name, it's you." Draco gave him a soft smile. Harry blushed a light pink dusting his cheeks. Draco took pride in that color; it meant that Harry was healthy, or at least getting healthy.
"As a little girl I always wanted a vanity table just like this. I always loved antiqued things like vanity's and castles." Hermione smiled idly tracing the gold hand mirror.
Marcus followed behind them as they climbed the stairs, Hermione quite appreciated his position behind them after being blind sided by Ron and her realization Marcus was there to protect her. Harry trusted Draco, Draco trusted Marcus that was enough for her fragile psyche. Logically she knew she was suffering from PTSD but she was now coming to the realization that knowledge was not the same as living it.
"Sue Bones will be here in a moment, I wish I could delay her another few days but The pure-bloods are calling for Ron's release if the trail isn't held in the next few days. They are inclined to believe he's innocent since you have yet to make a statement but Sue is as formidable as her Aunt was." Draco said softly wishing he didn't have to be the hard ass to tell her.
"I will pass along your Message, If you will excuse us Minister. Hermione is expected at Home they will be worried despite my Patronus. I must see her home." Marcus Bowed to the Minister held his hand out to Hermione.
"That's why Harry doesn't like the dark." Draco softly said his heart breaking as they watched the woman lock Harry inside and storm away into the kitchen. From there the memory sped up it settled to a few hours later where they watched a large fat man pull the boy Harry out of the cupboard by his hair and savagely beat the boy with his belt screaming obscenity at the boy the whole time. From that memory they bounced to one almost a year later this time the appearance of Dumbledore telling Harry's Aunt exactly how much more they needed to beat and harass the boy the more money he would send, then as if the memory was changed to that of Dumbledor never having seen the boy bleeding on the floor. Draco looked at Susan confused.
"Yes Thank you Sue I would like to see Kings but insist on Marcus staying with me." Hermione replied.
"Go Draco I'll look after the boy's it'll give me a chance to smother poor Harry with a little Mothering goodness knows the boy needs it." She grinned laying the now fed calm baby back down. Draco gave his Mother a rare smile and left the room elegantly gliding out.
It was Fleur though who found her an hour later the beautiful French woman sat on the ottoman that sat near Hermione's spot.
"You never approached Miss Granger for Romantic attachment or marriage?" Her lawyer paced in front of the platform.
"Ah I see Draco owled me about the Marriage Law worried you may shut down I think that may not be inaccurate. I understand that this has brought up a lot of pain for you in particular. " Gloria smiled softly.
"I understand He has a widow about to give birth to her child, I ask the court to see the money given to the woman he betrayed as much as he did me." Hermione recited the response Cissy had drilled into her blinking at the corpse. The One powerful stroke had almost cleaved Ron in Half she could see his ribcage and his bowels had fallen outside his body.
"Harry?" George blinked at the small figure Harry while better was healing he was still underweight thinner then he had ever been before.
"Yes because Merlin forbid you to talk about your feelings! How presumptuous of me to think my sister would confide in me after everything she has been through. Merlin Forbid her from being vulnerable and to know how much I love her and want to see her happy!" Harry snapped.
"That I could do at some point but for now I'm healing and want a better head space. When I feel like I am prepared I will approach my current Head of House and the rest of my family and ask for their support." Hermione insisted.
"If I didn't know better I'd say I died and woke up among the angels. It's lovely to see you again Mrs. Malfoy." He lay in her care, green eyes meeting blue.
"Make it Lord Malfoy I give you permission under special circumstances as a one time allowance we should make our way to the atrium that would be the best place for this I also want one more Auror to go with I assume you are joining us Arthur ." Susan smiled as the balding redhead nodded She turned and led the charge to the lobby followed by Harry Potter, a Weasley, and  Lord Malfoy. She collected a Auror on the way to the lifts where Draco began the complex charm work to make a temporary Portkey. The group made their way through the atrium along the way Harry grew curious.
"You will also have to floo with someone normally I'd let Harry but he's still in recovery himself . Will you allow myself or Arthur to carry you in the floo?" Draco gently asked Hermione.
Hermione noticed a small change the next morning Marcus was not standing outside her room the next morning after Draco had let them know about the Marriage law. It made Hermione mourn the small bit of security she had come to expect from the large man, but logic dictated that it was because of the revelation he would have to marry as well as she. He would have to stop his vigil sooner or later and had chosen sooner.
"At the time I would have said yes, Because I am a muggle born I struggled to find my place in my new world. I threw myself into my studies because I felt I had to work twice as hard and show that I belonged among the Pure-bloods. That and Magic was so special and extraordinary I wanted to know everything I could as quickly as I could." Hermione folded her hands around her cup of tea looking down into the liquid.
"Yyyess aaaa llittle Haarry Oooh Harry." The voice shook and was as if she had been screaming for years.
"We got you a healer sweetheart you were so close to dying when we brought you here, but Draco was able to get Madam Pomfrey between her and Draco they derived a potion plan that has been administered to you and you have been slowly getting better. You just need to get better little one for my poor son's sake he is driving himself into a early grave fretting and brewing all hours a day." She smiled softly humming when the door opened and a irate blond man practically stormed in the room but upon seeing Green eyes the man visibly relaxed.
Narcissia watched her sister feelings conflicted she had done what she could to right her sisters mistakes and her sister was not taking it well. Hopefully her sister would come around for now she would enjoy seeing her new son with his godson she had a new boy to spoil. Nothing Made Narsissia happier than watching her boys smile they were everything to her.
"I know this is hard for you Hermione, you have been through a lot the past three years but try to become a person again. You may be surprised to learn that there are still good people in the world. You will come to know that no one will ever cause you Harm in this house ever again." Cissy smiled tightly at her.
"You are Family Harry as much as the rest we chose you to be family we love you kiddo always have" A deeper Voice said stepping around From behind George, The broad shouldered muscular form of Charlie Weasley smiled sadly at the boy. " You should have come to us we would have taken you in."
"Knew you'd know what I was getting on about." Sue smiled at Hermione taking her hands adding. "I know this is going to be rough, Hermione at any time you are uncomfortable sharing a tidbit with the three of us we can stop."
Harry Potter woke next to a soft hand running fingers thru his hair a feminine voice humming softly to him. He felt warm and cared for this was how he always imagined his mother caring for him, waking him gently with warm hands and a sweet voice. His eyelids fluttered open he blinked up and saw the beautiful face of Narcissa Malfoy she continued to run her hand thru
"Honey you don't need to be sorry you have been through a trauma. You were a victim, I know you this has been a horrendous day I think it's time I make you go up and rest. I'll take you to your room." Harry said softly, helping her to her feet.
"Your killing yourself Po.. Harry." His voice was stunned, unsure why he had called him by his given name.
"I wish there was more I could do but with Dumbledore dead there is not a lot I can do Harry." Draco had told him.
"Let's get my wand and go home Draco." Harry stuttered suddenly afraid not for himself but for whoever  would be on the receiving end of the Black family temper. So they made their way back through the alley they picked up and payed 9 Galleons for Harry's wand who immediately tucked it into the wand holster that had been Draco's old one. They didn't linger around the Alley but went back to the manor they happily were relived of their burdens by the elves Galwin even took Altair to his crib for a nap. Harry and Draco walked through the manor and out into the greenhouse they approached Cissy who appeared to be holding a conversation with another woman Harry couldn't place as they neared Cissy Greeted them brightly.
"Has Gloria not told you it's ok to let others in has she not encouraged you to speak about what's going on in that massive brain of yours?" Harry prompted.
"Indeed Harry Is correct Lord Malfoy Is Mr. Potter well enough to Apperate a passenger?" Susan looked to Draco who thought for a moment.
She pulled back this time breaking the kiss this time and looked into Marcus' eyes; they were set and pierced her heart with it's soft pleading.
"I never hurt who you love. swear to be better." Hermione said brokenly, having a hard time with speech.
"It's okay Draco you don't have to keep explaining I think I understand and for my part I wasn't much better. I was envious of you too. You had parents who doted on you , you had Severus, you had love, something I never had once my parents died. My relatives never wanted me; they never let me forget how much they hated me. I had Sirius and Remus for so little time then they both were taken from me. After them Albus wanted me only for his own reasons he wanted me to be a weapon against Tom . And for his attention I played his game I was such a pathetic little wanker. I could not get away. Severus tried to keep me out but even he couldn't do much in the end. I never even go to thank him for everything out of everyone he never treated me like I was special." Harry gave a slight smile thinking of the dark man who sheltered him in his own way.
"Take each one and feel which fits better." Olivander directed Harry nodded and started with the pretty Cedar wood it felt warm under his fingers but it felt dull, he let it go it floated with the rest he looked and the stark white wood and felt repelled from it turning to the last he curled his hand around the wood and felt a light caress it felt warm and safe like the manor. He grinned up at Garrick Olivander who clapped pleased.
Hermione made her way to the sitting room where she had her sessions with Gloria. She settled herself into her spot and waited for the Dr to Floo in.
"I have placed my family seat on hold under the singular Member clause, I am the only Flint still living as I have no stomach for politics or the Wiz in general I felt it was best to do." He explained his voice smooth and deep, not at all like she remembered it.
"I'm so glad you know what to do Draco honestly I'd be lost trying to figure out even where to start. No one ever told me anything about my inheritance. As far as I know my parents didn't even have a will." Harry stated confused .
"I did notice how Draco hovered over Harry, he had to learn that level of love from someone." Hermione hinted.
Harry blinked at her just now remembering that they did have a small blood connection, he had a small amount of Black blood.
"Now straight to it unfortunately we are here to discuss something rather unsettling to say the least, I have already spoken to Headmistress McGonagall and The executor of Alubus Dumbledore's estate. They are willing to testify and help get this sorted out. I have statements from Gringotts and the Bank Manager Ragnok they have held a complete account audit since the death Of Charlus Potter your grandfather Harry and they have found sufficient cause to lay charges on Alubus Dumbledore for theft . The statement Headmistress McGonagall also provides enough evidence of blatant neglect of all child placement and welfare protocol. Now we want to go through your memories of your childhood and Hogwarts years to gauge the extent of damage done to you being left in the care of your mothers muggle sister and husband . This is gonna be difficult for you Harry but you deserve justice to see exactly what Dumbledore has done from your point of view. Now I need you to think from your earliest memory up until you Visiting Gringotts Can you do this Harry?" Susan asked Harry softly and smiled at him.
"Honey you by your own logic have just proclaimed you about to be wed to either a fame grubbing womanizing Arse, or a partially mute fame grubbing womanizing Arse. If I were you I'd have already jumped Marcus those broad shoulders were not just meant to look nice, They make a great place to toss a leg over." Gloria deadpanned back.
" I will never be able to ever make up for the wrong I have done to you Harry you would be well within your rights to file a custody claim against me for Teddy as his godfather you are entitled to visitation I kept you from ever seeing him. The court would probably give you full custody for my treachery. My sister is correct my daughter would be so hacked off of at me proper, Remus would be disgustedly critical and shame me eloquently. My Ted would also not be happy with me for turning you away he always felt you got dealt a bad hand . Sirius loved you so much Harry no one could keep you apart when you were just a baby you prefer him to your own dad and James Potter was so jealous of him for having such a claim over your love. Your Mum would even help Sirius Rattle your dad's cage over it . Such good kind people and I treat their son like my enemy. I was so afraid you'd either take Teddy away from me I would never see him again or you'd reject the boy. I had no idea you blew your money on PI's ."
"It's ok Harry we are seeing Susan Bones you remember her she was Amelia Bones's nice you remember Amelia right?" Draco asked softly
"Are you sure you were sorted correctly Hermione? That is worthy of any Slytherin." Draco blinked at the witch who blushed prettily.
"This press conference is now closed, I think it's past time we let our Savior do what he wishes. He has bloody well earned that at the very least!" Kingsley shook his head motioning Draco and Harry to his office to use his floo.
"To say the least Marcus, give her today back off your normal following her around like a dog. Let her see how it is without you for one day, hopefully she'll come to you. Your ambition to see her safe is admirable but she needs to sort out her feelings. Go read we both know you want to." Draco Smiled. Marcus nodded and lumberd away from Draco a bit forlorn without the sweet witch to protect.
"I would love that I…. I missed you all so much. I…My memories were the only thing I had left that belonged to me. Percy thought of me?" Hermione replied absently stunned Percy had mother henned her at Hogwarts in her first few years and they grew close but the war had taken him away.
"Now Harry dear if you don't stop calling me I'm afraid i will become quite deaf until you call me Cissy or at worst Narsissia if calling me Cissy makes you uncomfortable after all we are family if only through poor dear Sirius, and your grandmother my great aunt Dorea. Not a close connection but close enough for me." Narcissia huffed trying to appear affronted but failing and smiling softly at the dark haired young man who had saved them.
"Lord Malfoy it is indeed an honor to meet the new Malfoy head hopefully you will rise to the job. However it has come to my attention that Hair Potter has asked you to be his proxy and this worries me as up until his death the Proxy of the Potter fortune was Alubus Dumbledore and once he passed Mr. Potter never came in to make a new proxy or take over for himself. This has me curious as to what does and does not know about his inheritance ." Ragnok spoke as Draco Handed him the stack of papers he had Harry Fill out. Giving the goblin time to read over everything that Harry could think of to write to the bank.
"I think she has had about as much as she can take for one day, Miss Bones." Marcus spoke up his voice rough and angry.
" Good that means the potions we have had you are working, they will help start getting you to a healthy state. But the unfortunate thing is that you may have to be on several for the long term, at the moment I cannot say how long you'll have to be on them but I will personally brew each and every one as long as you need to be on them." Draco stated grey eyes as hard as steel as if waiting for a fight from Harry and why wouldn't he Harry's loathing of potions and healers in general was well known.
"No Marcus is still a bit of a stranger to me, He is a strong silent type of guy who doesn't speak often. In the three month's I have been here we have talked twice. He just follows me around the Manor quietly watching out for me." Hermione sipped her tea absently.
Years passed and the family remained in Malfoy Manor which became overrun with Children, then Grand Children. Love filled the halls and grounds of the Manor that once held the Dark Lord. The past not erased but forgotten and left to die as life moved forward.
Marcus considered himself a patient man and knew how fragile Hermione was and that it was her fear keeping her from facing her own feelings, Just like his were preventing him from reaching out to her. He walked Hermione's favorite path in the Garden; she loved the decadent rose bushes. He slumped sitting on the stone bench wringing his hands together.
Here he was now, two weeks later, sitting in Pansy’s living room on one of her very comfortable couches. He got up and headed for the kitchen, he needed a drink to relax a bit and enjoy his time with his friends without thinking about Harry too much.
Pansy sighed and pushed him further on his bed. Blaise and her hopped on it to sat across Draco. He could feel the horrible conversation coming his way.
“Okay, you're not worried.” They stared at each other now, blinking, giving themselves a sort of battle of glance. The doorknob slowly lowered and someone tried to enter but Harry's weight prevented him. Harry peeled off the door, pushing Malfoy back at the same time. He turned around and the door opened slowly, revealing a little blond boy. Harry smiled at Lesath and eyed him.
“Of course” Dumbledore smiled. “Let me call Professor Snape, as well as Professor Lupin and Black” Harry nodded and finally took a lemon candy while waiting.
“What are you doing?” Draco asked him. Harry turned again and Draco rested his head on his shoulder.
“They have always told us that their first kiss took place there” the blonde replied, shrugging. Hermione did not understand where he was going, but let it go.
“I don’t bother you too much I hope!” Severus almost yelled, unhappy to be ignored in his own apartments. They turned to him.
“Really ? Didn’t you find anything better?” He just shrugged. This small exchange had the gift of amusing Hermione and Theo and the atmosphere relaxed greatly in the room.
“What? No! No one is mad at you” Harry said as he sat, cross-legged in front of his son, in the middle of the corridor.
“And that's my brother, Jasper” He stated, pointing to his, obviously, twin brother with brown eyes. Draco chuckled, twins again. Behind the Zabini-Weasley twins stood another pair of twins.
“What are you talking about?” Harry laughed, but he stopped when he saw the blonde's serious look, and he put his hands under Draco's sweater and hugged him.
Eleanor and Hermione had the idea to gather several tables in the living room to be able to receive Sirius and Remus. Harry watched them all arrange the room from the top of the stairs. Then he felt Draco's arms slipped around him. He turned to face him and kissed him softly.
“What are you thinking about?” He asked. She turned her green eyes in his direction and summoned a chair on the other side of the bed he was sitting on.
“What were you talking about by the way?” The boy asked now in front of them. He was a tall young man, his black hair just above his shoulders and he was black-eyed.
Severus entered first, followed by Sirius. Severus stopped in front of Dimitri, on the other side of the table. He snatched the pack of cereals from his hands and left like a fury. Sirius threw a new packet of those same cereals at his son with a wink before following the pissed potions master. Molly came next and looked oddly at Draco and Hermione, still red, and Ron, who was still pale. She shrugged and walked down the table until she was near Jordan, who was sleeping, lying under the table.
“Get upstairs, find our kids and lock yourself in our room” Harry told Draco before kneeling down next to Jordan. He was conscious and his hand was against his side. A large knife was on the ground next to him and Harry suddenly started to panic. He was bleeding a lot and Harry was like paralyzed. Suddenly, Nathaniel came running toward them and put his hands on Jordan’s wound, pressuring it. Nathaniel smiled softly at his boyfriend.
“I’ll repeat myself, but are you fucking crazy?” Draco exclaimed once more. Blaise laughed in disbelief.
“One of them will somehow isolate Dad in one corner of his body while the second will cast a death spell on the Horcrux”
“Why would it be a disaster, Ron?” The redhead lifted his head, glaring at his friend before plunging back into the blankets.
“What about me?” Harry asked with a sulky pout that melted Draco. He leaned over and laid his lips on Harry's. Again, they didn’t pay attention to Lucius who almost choked and to Narcissa who was ecstatic.
“No, but do you realize? As if we were the type to organize a party with alcohol! Really…” He was offended. His two friends gave him dubious looks.
"We call it politeness Weasley, but we probably didn’t teach you that in your country” Draco retorted. Ron was going to reply, but Lyra stepped in, threatening to exclude him from the story if he did not calm down. He groaned but calmed himself all the same. Harry had now put his hands on his lap and Draco put a hand on Harry's knee to keep from feeling bad. Once calm was restored, Lyra began her explanations again.
“Don’t worry, love, it's just your redhead friend screaming his displeasure” Harry smiled at the affectionate nickname and then lay down, without sleeping.
In the room they had just left, Hermione gazed at her two children, Eleanor and Joris. She was really overwhelmed by the blue of their eyes. Ron was out, unable to stand the sight of another of his children. He was not gay, damn it! Still, he had to admit that these kids looked just like him. He opened the door again suddenly.
“Hermione! Wow!” Harry exclaimed. The girl had apparently done some makeover by Pansy. Seeing her, Harry found her really sexy. She blushed at Harry's compliment and Pansy smiled proudly. Theo passed at that moment in the corridor. He passed without glancing at them and after a few seconds he took a few steps back, his head turned towards the opening left open. He stared at Hermione and his eyes widened as his mouth opened.
“That plan’s pretty good, actually it's fine as long as you change the part where you're coming along” Draco made an outraged look.
“I'm going to count to three, and if at that moment you didn’t speak, I’ll hit you against that wall until you die, understand?” Of course, Ezekiel didn’t wait for an answer.
“What is the relationship between Ezekiel and the fact that you kidnapped Lyra and Eleanor?” Harry asked.
The kid seemed about to speak so Harry motioned him to shut up and went over to hug him. He ended up in the hallway. He decided to go to Hermione's room, thinking that, given the early hour, she might not be up yet. He put Lesath on the floor in front of the door and asked him to wait for him here. He then entered gently, making no sound, suspecting that the children were still sleeping. He crossed the room safely and opened the door leading to Hermione's room. The room was plunged into the most complete darkness. Harry tried to tell which bed Hermione was in but failed.
“Who's like me?” Sirius asked, throwing his head out the door. Harry jostled them all and rushed towards Sirius. He hugged him so hard that the older man thought he was going to end up suffocated. He did not care anymore when he heard Harry sniff. He hugged the boy harder and stroked his hair until he calmed down. Harry pulled away from him, went to get Dimitri and came back to Sirius with a big smile.
“Are you ok, sweetheart?” He whispered in his ear. Emett nodded but Harry felt new tears running down his neck. He stopped once he reached the top of the stairs. He kneeled down and Emett sat on the floor, his knees to his chest. Tears were still running down his cheeks and he started to sob.
“I don’t want to bother, but if you could do it somewhere else, it would be really nice” Emett said confidently as his four friends watched Harry and Draco with mocking smiles. Draco then led a more than red Harry into their room. He slammed Harry back against the door and kissed him passionately. Harry moaned as Draco ripped them off their clothes with a simple wish. The blonde lifted Harry up and Harry wrapped his legs around the pale waist. Draco held out his fingers at Harry, who sucked them carefully as Draco led them to one of the beds. He pushed two of his fingers into Harry as soon as they were on the bed. He straightened up on his knees between Harry's spread legs and leaned forward to suck Harry's cock with application while adding a third finger inside Harry. Harry almost shouted with pleasure at the feeling. After a few rounds, Draco pulled his fingers out under Harry's grunts. He started moaning again as Draco began to slide his cock inside him while kissing him again. Harry wrapped his legs around Draco's waist, screaming as Draco hit his prostate forcefully.
“You want to know who our parents are” Nathaniel cut her off. The five of them nodded. To relax the tense atmosphere between Slytherin and Gryffindor, Lyra proposed that the parents tried to guess. They all nodded, after all that could bring them closer, all as they were. Hermione began by saying that Emett was Harry's son and Ron's son was Jordan. So they each went to their father, a smile on their lips.
“Because you've had twins twice and triplets once” Erin murmured. Harry became considerably pale at these words. If he was not too idiotic, six of his children were here and Ezekiel and Nathaniel had a sister, so that was seven. Then he was almost sure that the two pairs of twins were not there, so eleven. He had eleven children! It was really too much to learn in one night. He dropped his head against the table, groaning.
“Let's summarize, you saved me from a deadly fall, you hugged me, you saved me again from a more than deadly wound, you cried and panicked when you saw all that blood and you have been hugging me for a long time so I don’t  think our relationship is a real secret right now, why?” Draco smirked, clinging to the brunette.
“Probably anyone but you” Harry showed him his middle finger as he walked away and Draco laughed behind him.
“Well, today we are going to address the unformulated. The theory was taught to you by my colleague so let's get straight to the practice” With a wand motion Remus made all the tables disappear and the students got up hastily before their chairs disappeared. Once the room was emptied, he spoke again.
“Soul mate, you say?” Hermione asked and the three blondes nodded. “That's what it seemed to me” she added more for herself than to continue the conversation. She opened a big book and immediately Blaise and Theo leaned over her shoulders to read at the same time. "Okay, so from what we can read, there would be several levels of soul mates” Harry frowned.
Draco smiled as Pansy sat next to him, the both of them watching Theo and Blaise joke around on the other couch. Draco knew the whole purpose of this evening was to make him laugh, make him forget the pain.
He remained silent until the end of the breakfast, seriously thinking about going to Dumbledore to invite Sirius and Remus to the castle. He got up with all the others at the bell. He had a DCFM course with the Slytherins. Lyra, Dimitri and Zachady had classes with them and Harry was happy. Draco leaned nonchalantly against the wall near the door and Harry slid to the ground next to him. Draco slid his hand into Harry's neck, they probably could not get in touch for the next two hours so as a precaution they wanted to be in touch, not wishing any of them to faint in the middle of the room. The door opened suddenly and Remus Lupin came out. Harry's eyes widened and he got up.
“Since when are you so good at chess, Harry!?” Ron exclaimed suddenly as Harry had just picked up one of his pieces. Harry sneered, raising his eyebrows suggestively.
“We're here, little brother” He told him, ruffling his hair. Harry, who watched without saying anything, began to watch the three boys in front of him more closely. He started with Jordan, he had brown hair and, on reflection, he realized that indeed he had the same blue eyes as some of the Weasleys. As he detailed his eyes, he saw the tender look he gave to Nathaniel and his brother. He turned his gaze on the blonde. His hair was cut short and a few locks fell back before his green eyes. When he looked at his eyes, Harry took a slight step back. He had the impression to look at his own eyes in a mirror. The surprise passed, he looked to the youngest and once again, he thought he had a mirror in front of him. He had hair similar to Harry's. His green eyes proved that the two young men were indeed brothers. Their parents had to be different because of their hair color, Harry thought. Harry came out of his thoughts when Hermione sat down next to him, looking even more pensive and lost than when she went away. She remained silent even though the five boys were staring at her, waiting for her to speak.
“We're going to eat” Were the only words Malfoy uttered as he walked through the living room with his gracious step, Harry always following him closely. The brunette was making funny faces to the child in Malfoy's arms and the kid was laughing at his antics. All watched as they passed by and were very surprised to see Malfoy smile sincerely and tenderly. His words had silenced Ron, who was watching them now as they walked past him, as if he didn’t exist. They had now passed the door, and everyone in the room stared at the door, which was still open, from where the little blonde's crystalline laugh still came.
“To answer your question, I would say we need to stay a few hours” He then winked at him and turned around, going to find his two blond older sons. Draco opened his mouth outrageously and Harry laughed loudly.
“we should try to make it explode” Ezekiel suggested. Eleanor hit him with the book she was reading.
“You, I like you” The teenager now had a shocked look and was trying to sort out his hair. His twin laughed at his side.
The party went completely crazy when Ginny and Pansy literally threw themselves on each other. Ginny sat astride Pansy who was lying on the floor and kissed her on the mouth. Harry took advantage of the hustle and bustle that caused to grab Draco's wrist and drag him upstairs.
Finally, after a time when Draco was quietly kissing Harry's neck and the two elongated browns were laughing for some reason, Nathaniel finally cleared his throat.
“A misunderstanding ? A misunderstanding ! Tell me right now that I'm wrong while you're there.” Harry got even more angry and even jostled the blonde. Draco opened his mouth to explain but the brunette didn’t let him.
“My magic’s not working” He said as he tried for the fifth time to apparate away. Jordan made a sound near his shoulder and laughed lightly. Nathaniel sighed and held him tighter against his body. He looked around him, he needed to find somewhere to hide because whatever was pounding on the door was going to enter soon. He then spotted the library. They had rebuilt it, but the hole caused by the explosion was still behind it.
“So, I'm sixteen as well as Zach. Erin, Nathaniel, Ezekiel, Jordan, Eleanor, Joris and Alarik are fifteen years old. Emett is thirteen. Lesath, Irina, Isallys, Erika and Seth are five years old” Lyra said. Harry was silent, trying to record the information that was coming to him in waves.
“We'll see” And with these words he climbed the stairs two by two. He stopped at the top of the stairs and looked in what room could be that red-haired girl. He sneered, thinking that she must not have been smart enough to hide outside of her room. He walked to the door where Weasley-Parkinson was written. The door opened on its own when he arrived. He entered and he saw Lena curled up in one of the corners of the room. He rolled his eyes. Not even able to hide, he thought. He leaned against the door he had closed and stared at the girl in front of him.
“You'd be nice not to rape my brother on this couch” He laughed. Jordan looked up suddenly, seeming to realize they were not alone. Nathaniel dropped to the sofa, his cheeks extremely red. Dimitri chuckled and they looked at him all.
“Come on, come with me” The blond threw his arms around Jordan's neck and he slipped his hands under Nathaniel's thighs and lifted him up and disappeared from the living room as well. Harry felt his head hurt and start to turn. So before fainting, he put the palm of his hand on Draco's arm.
“Well, if it's just a stupid table, why don’t you and your noble butt come at MY table?” Malfoy looked shocked for a moment before replying.
“Do you think they’ll…?” He asked Draco silently as they walked slowly behind the boys. He shook his head and tightened his hand around Harry’s. Harry took that as a ‘Maybe, I don’t know’. They caught up with the others as they laid the girl on the floor.
“Hide under the cloaks now” Lucius ordered them. Nathaniel and Ezekiel hid under a cloak with Zephir and Alya hid with Harry. A few streets away, they reached a telephone booth. They all huddled inside and the elevator led them inside the ministry of magic. Harry looked around the hall and a strange smile took place on his lips. Finally, he would be able to start the hunt for horcruxes and finally get rid of the murderer of his parents.
Ezekiel glanced at his two sisters who’d just entered the room, he nodded discreetly, and they went about their business. He allowed himself a satisfied little smile when he saw that everything was going as planned. He watched his girlfriend and suddenly took by an envy of romance, went to invite her to dance.
“This is one of the things I haven’t understood yet. As well as their identities” Harry looked at her.
“Malfoy also said he called him daddy!” Harry intervened. Hermione send a jaded look at Harry. Obviously a child who called Harry and Malfoy daddy, it didn’t shock anyone. It was incredible anyway. Then she was extremely relieved when one of the pictures informed them that they were all summoned by Dumbledore.
“Come on” Draco took him by the hand and made him stand up. Harry was staggering but was standing up.
“Stop” Draco said after taking a deep breath, even though his eyes had closed at the familiar feeling.
“Of course I’m coming! I'm not going to wait for you here as if I'm just a fragile girl” Harry gave him his best puppy eyes.
In the days that followed, Molly did her best to avoid them as much as possible while Arthur and Tonks were acting as if nothing had happened. Finally, Christmas arrived and they were all in the living room on December 25th. The five smaller ones were happy to distribute the gifts. Once all the gifts were distributed, the younger ones were allowed to unpack theirs. Erika received a miniature cauldron from her parents, which, in the sight of her smiling face, filled her with joy.
“I'm going to go get Jordan” Ezekiel slipped out of the room and ran down the stairs. He smiled tenderly as he saw that his brother had slipped under the table and was playing with Jordan's brown locks. He seemed to be slowly emerging from his heavy sleep.
He put his hand on it and he was propelled into the air by something like a wave of invisible magic. He crashed to the ground several meters further, right on the pile of books that collapsed under his weight. He saw Blaise's hand appear before his eyes. He grabbed it and thanked his friend once he was on his feet.
“Listen, I'm sorry...” He began before being cut off by the image Harry sent him. In this mental picture, they were both exactly where they were now, except that they were much closer and passionately kissing each other. After seeing that, Draco looked at Harry questioningly. So Harry followed his instinct. He approached the blonde, placed his hand in the blonde's neck and pressed his lips on his as the storm raged outside and the wind and rain were falling on them.
“It’s okay, baby” Jordan coughed and then reached out to put one of his hand over Nath’s. Harry couldn’t do anything but stare. Their hands suddenly started to glow softly and Jordan yelled in pain.
“What the fuck was that?” He looked panicked and shocked. “I saw myself dying in my blood” His voice was high and he began to rush back and forth beside the bench. When he passed by Draco for the third time, the blond reached out his hand and stopped him in his motion and made him sit down again.
“What are you doing?” Harry giggled as Draco slammed the first door and pushed Harry against it. He nibbled at his neck and Harry held back as best he could his moan.
“Is something wrong between you and Dimitri?” Harry finally asked after what felt like on minute or two. He wanted Zephir to spoke first but they hadn’t an eternity to talk. Once Lena would wake up, they’ll have to take care of her, whatever the boys wanted to do to her.
“I am one of the triplets of the most powerful pair of soulmates that exist so far” Ezekiel explained simply shrugging his shoulders. Blaise stared at him without understanding.
“You're here” He whispered as he approached Harry. He threw himself on him, hugging him. Harry froze before returning his embrace. He wondered what had happened so that Draco Malfoy would throw himself into his arms, clearly worried for him
“Well, you’ve all understood!” Dimitri exclaimed, hitting Harry's shoulder lightly, The latter was frozen, completely terrified. A hand brought him back to reality
After a moment there was a little knock on the door and Lesath entered, looking as shy as ever. They pulled back and looked at him with smiles.
“One of the five kids over there called me daddy," He said, pointing to the five little ones in a corner. This announcement began to raise some doubts in Hermione's mind.
“Family meeting!” He shouted as he skipped the last step. He lifted Lesath from the ground and took him in his arms and went upstairs, followed by his four siblings. They entered the room and could see that their two fathers were still unconscious.
“Did you never saw the savior, young man?” Snape asked meanly. The boy didn’t answer right away and his friends were looking just like him. The first to recover was the second blond, even if Harry wasn’t really sure because of their similarity. He swallowed loudly.
“Sit down, Ron, before you get madder” Hermione told him. He obeyed and sat down next to Harry, as if to watch him.
Issue number two: Ron hadn’t spoken to him since he knew he was with Draco, in fact he wasn’t speaking to anyone and was really snarling. And problem number three: Severus, Sirius, Remus and even Lucius and Narcissa were coming with them. He felt that these holidays were not going to be easy.
“I just want you and the baby to be safe. And I'm just going to get a necklace, nothing dangerous” Draco then capitulated, knowing full well that he wouldn’t have the last word. Draco pushed Harry aside and he turned too. While they were doing nothing but stare, the door creaked open. Lesath appeared, a more than shy look on his face.
“By Merlin, are you acting like a baby again, Em?” Lyra asked as she went to stand in front of them. He looked up at her and shook his head. “It’s not because you’re small that you have to act like you really are a little kid” Emett nodded at her, looking sad and guilty.
room, where he told Draco to go. When he opened the door, he felt relieved. They were all here, waiting patiently.
The bathroom door opened as they passed by and Zachady was drawn inside and the door slammed shut, leaving Ezekiel alone in the hallway. The blonde tried to get in but the door was locked by a powerful spell. He unlocked it with a simple contact with the door and entered without problem. Blaise turned to him, shocked that he was able to enter.
“You’re  beautiful, babe” He whispered, astonished by his lover’s beauty. Both are too deeply lost in lust to notice the affection seeping through Harry’s voice and into the words. Draco slid his fingers into the black, messy hair and pulled Harry down for a kiss. As his mouth started moving against the Slytherin, Harry gently pushed one slick finger into Draco who tears his mouth away in a moan. Harry quickly catches it again and bites Draco’s lower lip.
“Where is he?” Hary asked, a bit alarmed. He, Draco, Ezekiel and Alya seemed to be the only ones to notice so the four of them apparated away too.
“DINNER!” Molly yelled from the ground floor. The twins disappeared immediately and the door opposite opened. Blaise shot an amused smile at the half-naked men on the bed.
“Oh yes…” He moaned. He felt Harry on his back as the boy heavily laid his chest onto him. The boy’s hot breath on his neck was enough to do him in. He pushed his hips back in time with Harry’s thrusts, leaving Harry moaning in his ear.
“Is everyone gone because you're laughing? Because at home when you laugh we laugh too, we don’t leave. Do we have to leave too?”
“We can only play by two, but if you want you can play with daddy later” Draco offered. Harry kicked the blonde's ribs. Draco snickered and they passed the little boy who nodded and they finally entered the bathroom. As soon as the door closed, Draco kissed Harry while dropping the blanket to the floor.
The latter sat up and looked at Harry. His eyes were closed, his cheeks were red, and he was panting. Draco smiled tenderly and came to kiss Harry. The latter hugged Draco in his arms a few moments before reversing their positions again. He then came to nibble the earlobe of the blonde who began to moan. He lowered his hand down Draco's body, once again taking possession of the blonde's attractive lips. He then took the virility of the blond in hand and began to jerk it gently. The blonde began to moan loudly under this caress. Harry accelerated the pace as he slowly directed his second hand toward the blond's intimacy.
Harry hummed against his neck, making Draco shiver, before kissing his neck. Draco couldn’t deal with a drunk Harry right now.
"Don’t laugh, don’t laugh, don’t laugh" Harry repeated to himself mentally. Draco burst out laughing as he heard that, and Molly's sharp eyes fell on him. She then went back to Harry.
Harry arrived on the second floor just in time to see Joris smash Lena on the head with his book. She fell on the floor, unconscious. He then turned to Lyra, who was on the floor. One of her lip was cut and bloody, her hair was in a mess and she was out of breath. She looked at Joris with wide eyes, a bit watery.
“Well” He said, coherently, like that explained everything. “I’m not sure I want to go back” He admitted as she looked about to throw him in the trunk just to be sure it wouldn’t be empty anymore.
“I didn’t talk to you, Weasley, I don’t talk to the traitor” Malfoy answered. Ron looked upset and Malfoy sat between Harry and Ginny, pushing the redhead unceremoniously. They all gave him surprised looks, not understanding why Draco Malfoy was sitting at their table. They remained silent before Malfoy decided to explain himself.
“It's probably nothing Granger, no need to worry about that.” With these unpleasant words, he got up and left the hall.
She stood up and took a quick step towards the exit of the common room, glad that Dumbledore finally wanted to say more. The five others get up and left in silence. When they arrived in front of the Headmaster’s office, Harry saw Malfoy, who was having a conversation with Zabini. The blonde suddenly burst into a straightforward laugh that caught Harry's attention as he stared at the face of his not-so-enemy. He did not hear Ron bitching against the two Slytherins. Malfoy looked up while laughing and his eyes fell into Harry's. Harry was very surprised that the blond doesn’t replace his ice mask immediately, but continued to smile with all his teeth. His smile slowly diminished but did not disappear completely and strangely, both of them were unable to break the eye contact. At least until the gargoyle turned on itself and they all turned their eyes in its direction. It was Hermione who decided to move first and everyone else followed his movement. Dumbledore opened the door to them with a wand motion and welcomed them into his office where the rest of the children that no one knew were waiting. The director had to make appear additional seats so that its sixteen guests could settle down. They all sat down and stared at Dumbledore, waiting for his explanations. The Headmaster went to sit behind his desk and the position didn’t suit him, so he got up and rounded his desk to lean against it.
“Violent to what extent?” Draco cautiously asked as Alya pushed down the redhead's face into the stone wall.
“I don’t forget you, don’t worry” He said with a wicked grin before turning away. However, he didn’t have the time to reach the door, the blond boy behind it opened it. Actually, they were four young boy and they were roughly 15 years old. Two of them were blond and probably twins. The two others were brunettes. One of the blond smiled brightly at the Professor.
“But you said you were sixteen! That means we're going to get pregnant soon” The children were surprised that Harry was no more shocked or disgusted than that. Ezekiel jumped to his feet.
“SHUT UP!” Ezekiel yelled at his brother. “Your powers! Use them!” The blond finally pronounced, throwing himself beside his father. Draco glanced up at him, not knowing how to do it. Nathaniel arrived then.
“Oh! That means the blond twins are your kids!” Fred then exclaimed. They then straightened up, sitting on the bed. Harry nodded.
“Until we tell Grandma that daddy and I love each other, you'll have to stay with him when she's with us, okay?” The boy's eyes watered immediately.
“Do you think we should try to talk to Zephir?” Harry suddenly asked when the latter sat on the ground and stared at the wall in front of him like it held all the answers to his questions. “About Dimitri, I mean” He added when Draco didn’t answer.
“Do you want to stay here tonight?” Harry asked slowly, still breathing like he’d run for days. Draco quickly turned his head towards the boy beside him with a questioning look. ‘Have I heard well? He wants me to stay with him?’ He asked himself.
"Don’t run, it's useless and you know it" He heard in his head as he reached the stairs to the apartment. He stopped dead on his way to wait for Draco.
“What if we go to see the dorms now?” He asked. So they went up the stairs and came down a long corridor. They advanced to a dark door on their left. They stopped and looked at the door. It was a simple black door where two names were inscribed. The letters were silver and it was written ‘Malfoy-Potter’. Zabini chuckled.
“Oh yes, that's right” Harry nodded, laughing at his own stupidity. He put the books down on the pile and with a simple wrist movement he carried the pile of books to a corner of the room. He turned around and stepped over the little wall again and entered the small hallway. He tried to concentrate more magic in his hands and put them against the wall. A wave of magic more powerful and violent than the first time pushed him away. He flew through the living room and hit the wall violently. The shock cut his breath and he fell to the ground coughing. Blaise ran in front of him and knelt down.
Draco had offered Harry a supreme firebolt to replace his broken broom. To thank him, Harry kissed him passionately under Molly's disgusted face and the tender smiles of their children. Harry offered Draco a potion book and Draco did all he could to hide his grimace of disappointment. Harry did, however, sense Draco's feeling of great disappointment.
“Why are you in the blanket?” Lesath asked them suddenly, whom they had not seen coming. Draco tightly tightened the blanket around them. He then looked at Harry, silently asking him to find a good excuse.
“Hey ! These are my girls, guys, so they are not sexy is it clear?” Harry almost got angry. The two redheads had amused smiles but still nodded.
No matter, the facts were there: he loved Draco. And above all, he was going to have to hide that. He jumped out of bed when he heard Draco trying to force the door once more. The door opened on its own as Harry approached and he found himself facing the blonde.
“It's not because some kids say that you, Harry and I are going to end up married with Malfoy and his mates that it’s gonna happen Hermione!” Hermione took a few steps back, slightly frightened.
In that same room, Harry had locked himself on the parents’ side of the room while Draco was stuck on the kids' side and was trying to get in anyway. The brunet was in panic, how could it have happened? Huh? How could he fall in love with Draco? Harry could not deny that Draco was physically attractive, not in fact he was frightfully attractive in the devilish angel genre. But the worst was that without his mask of ice and contempt, this little cunt was horribly cute and kind. Yeah, he was just adorable and shy.
The silence stretched in the room and suddenly there was a loud rumbling coming from the ceiling. Everybody looked up and gathered at the center of the room.
Harry slowly opened his eyes and yawned slightly. A chuckle answered him. A kiss fell on his lips and he smiled closing his eyes.
“No, of course not” They replied in one voice. The boy gave them a huge smile and ran back to play. Pansy and Ginny had not missed anything of the scene or their smiles when the little boy ran back to them.
“It's okay... I'm here and I'm not going to die” Draco then lifted Harry's trembling body when Harry whispered in horror that it was starting again. He laid him on the bed and a vision appeared in his mind. He saw himself bleeding from the ground while Harry screamed on the bed. He closed his mind and the image disappeared. Then he thought for a few moments and was struck by the idea that had sprouted in him. The image he had seen was from Harry and she was sent to him by Voldemort, so he wondered if Voldemort could see what he was sending to Harry.
“Your daughter is dating my son and your son is dating my daughter” Theo explained with a shrug. Draco glanced at the children to urge them to continue after they explained what the horcruxes were and that they needed to be destroyed as quickly as possible.
“There may be some other names that are a little shocking on the other doors, so you'd better not move on.” They all ended up shrugging and turned around, returning to the sort of common room. The five teenagers of that time went to sit on sofas. Harry, Ron and Hermione on one and facing them, Malfoy and Zabini on another. The children tried to slip away quietly but their plan failed miserably and they all had to shake in the third couch present. Malfoy decided to speak, which he had not done in a while.
“How do you think we are placed?” She thought for a moment. “We should go back to Dumbledore for him to explain the whole situation, don’t you think?”
“You were afraid that I raped you or what?” Harry almost choked on those words, but he recovered quickly, not forgetting that he was talking to Malfoy.
He shrugged and went to play chess with Ron while Draco read a book, his head on his lap. Although in fact it was more Draco playing while Harry was in his thoughts. Draco had discovered by pure chance that he could, with a lot of concentration, see through Harry's eyes. He used it in Harry's interview with Molly and he was using it now too. The only drawback was that it tired him a lot. He was transmitting the movements to be made to Harry by the thought and the latter was performing them.
“I want you to make peace with Malfoy, Harry. It is important for our cohabitation that the atmosphere is relaxed. And above all, Harry, these kids are used to seeing their parents happy together so it's imp-”
“I reacted very badly, it doesn’t matter if your chosen one is Draco Malfoy, the important thing is that you're happy and he doesn’t look that bad, I have to admit that he looks very good”
“I mean- you know what, I'll give you examples, it'll be easier” She thought for a moment, making a mental list of all her ideas.
“Already, I don’t plan to leave you, it’s absolutely not in my projects and it will never be. Then I admit I've been a little away from you in the last few days, and I'm really sorry about that, but I was busy” They were now in the middle of the living room and Harry turned abruptly to him.
“What did you do to my sister?” The blond man asked in a particularly threatening voice. The girl was speechless but Harry could see her tremble in fear from where he was. He grabbed her by the collar of her dress and slammed her against the wall without any delicacy. Ezekiel rushed in, as angry as Joris if not more. His still-black hair and pale skin mixed with the muffled anger that emanated from every pore of his skin made him look particularly scary.
“Well, my observations about you” They all gave her bored looks, waiting for more explanations from her.
“Have you been here doing nothing for the last two hours?” She asked, crossing her arms over her chest just like she did every time she was about to lecture him.
“Is everything fine?” He asked. Harry lifted his head, not having heard him. Draco was captivated by the beauty that emanated from Harry at that moment.
“Blow up would be a more exact term” Ezekiel intervened again. His sister glared at him, telling him to shut up.
“I-I have it” Harry pronounced hardly, opening his hand, revealing Salazar Slytherin's locket. Draco almost tore it from his hands and sent it away.
Harry walked to Zephir and hesitated before sitting down next to him. The boy barely looked at him, his head bent low. He was looking at his hands, which were lying on his legs.
Harry erected a shield with both hands to counter the wave of spells that was coming toward him. He was on the Quidditch pitch and all the 15 and 16 year old had given themselves the task of training him. The triplets had just entered the room this morning, had opened the curtains wide and had said that he couldn’t hope to defeat Voldemort by using a simple expelliarmus.
He let himself be dragged into the next room and welcomed in his arms Erika. With his free hand he briefly rubbed his lower back again. He really needed to seriously look for the reason for this pain. He saw the oldest of his children staring at him, then they exchanged glances before smiling at him. He frowned. His children had seen that he was suffering and they seemed to rejoice.
“Hermione?” She raised her head and, understanding his question, opened her mouth, ready to explain.
“We won, didn’t we?” He finally asked, deciding that it was still one of the main issues. All the children, apart from the five little ones, burst out laughing.
Draco held Harry tighter against himself, wrapping his other arm around his waist as he whispered “Okay”.
“The triplets’ powers are too powerful. They would kill Daddy when the twins could get there perfectly” Lyra explained.
“What did you do with Harry?” Draco raised a questioning eyebrow with a cold face.  “He’s nowhere, he's gone” She informed them, darting a suspicious look on them.
Harry, Draco and their eight children were now in the children's room. The eight beds formed only one, gigantic. They were a little bit heaped on each other despite the size of the mattress. Harry was between Draco's legs, himself leaning against a pillow against the wall. Lesath sat astride Harry's legs and faced his brothers and sisters. Emett and Ascella were lying across the bed, their heads meeting in the center. Lyra, Alya and Erin were lying on their stomachs and their feet were beating the air at the same rate. Ezekiel and Nathaniel sat cross-legged on either side of the girls and Harry could almost hear the cogs in the two boys’ brains set off to find out how to explain everything to them.
“I had gone to see Dumbledore” At these words, the boys looked at each other, amused. “I asked him if he had noticed those students we don’t know and especially these five children" The boys nodded, waiting for her to continue.
“So, what do you want to know about the war?” Draco thought for a moment, asking questions in his mind.
“What are you doing Potter?” Harry then sped up, entering the hall and heading to the Gryffindor table.
“Oh ! I see ... Don’t worry I'll arrange that for you” Zachady winked at him and Blaise was about to answer when Ron opened the door a little.
“Almost all of the parents look happy and totally in love, right now, my parents are probably making Lyra or the twins. But there is a problem that remains in my mind” Jordan nodded and urged the blond to continue. "We all know how they all defeated Voldemort. The problem is that we are probably changing the past and they’re not looking for these evil objects, I forgot their names”
“When we’ll faint, you won’t say the same thing” He warned. Draco laughed lightly and then put an arm around Harry's shoulders.
“Because you and your stupid friends are just doing shit and Daddy is always yelling at you because of that” Lyra began.
Harry tried to knock him out with his magic but it didn’t work. So, he looked around him and picked a lamp up and smashed the head of the guy with it. He fell on the ground at his feet and his two kids got up, breathing hard.
Meanwhile, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Pansy, Theo and Blaise were putting together a plan with the teachers to pick up the locket. Ron had suggested that Harry hide under his invisibility cloak so that he could steal it discreetly while Lucius would speak with Umbridge to distract her. The triplets entered at this moment, after finishing expelling their magic.
“Okay, you can stay with me too” His son gave him a huge smile, then he wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and he lifted him off the floor. Molly frowned as she saw that.
Draco walked back to the atrium and back toward the floo he threw the powder and whisked himself home he found Harry and Teddy in the playroom giggling and laughing together. Floating stuffed dragons that once belonged to Draco , leaning on the door jam just content to watch the interaction. Draco let the Malfoy Sion mask slip off his person as he watched the play. He had been hard wired since birth to never show the outside world his true self like his father before him and his grandfather before that. He wanted better for the boys for every child he wanted to be a better parent then his own Father had been.
