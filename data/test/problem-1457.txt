me?!” Draco screeched suddenly, a fury of small flying fists descending against Harry’s stomach, eliciting a winded ‘oof’ of surprise from the alpha.
“Yeah,” Ron nodded, “like ‘a floo call away’ close, not shacking up the same sodding house. What are people going to think?”
“Severus, enough,” Remus spoke quietly and calmly but both Harry and Snape fell silent. “Any fool can see how much Harry adores Draco and in turn how much that boy loves Harry. I would be willing to form an unbreakable vow with you right now assuring that Harry will never mistreat his family.”
“Would you present for me?” Harry asked, his voice so low as to almost be a rasp. “Don’t worry, I’m not going to mount you, I promise. I just want to see you.”
“Mum’s already said you’re welcome at the Burrow,” Ron told him. “Just in case Remus and Sirius were still away this Christmas.”
Finally, they drew back, Draco’s body heaving for breath as they leaned against each other. Harry closed his eyes and smiled as the omega’s chest began to vibrate with low, soft purrs.
“I mean, I was originally a little peeved because with the timing and everything I figured you’d been seeing him at the same time as me.”
“We anticipated fraternisation and whilst there is little we can do regarding entanglements of the physical nature between inhabitants of Gaedere House itself, I am incredibly disappointed in what you have done.”
“Why couldn’t you just keep your legs shut?” the man shot back harshly. “I swear if this gets out, we’re done with you. Let Severus deal with your wanton ways.”
“Aren’t you tired?” Draco frowned, looking at the way Harry was carefully holding himself up so as to not let any weight fall on the omega.
“Was that your impervious Harry?” Katie asked as her and Draco looked across at him. “It smells like cinnamon.”
“Already sorted,” Hermione smiled, handing Draco the neatly folded clothes. The joggers were stretchy and white whilst the sweatshirt was a pale powder pink and felt soft to the touch. It was the kind of ridiculously comfy and casual wear that Bellatrix would no doubt sneer at and Draco felt a vicious kind of joy as he gratefully accepted the pile from Hermione. There were even a pair of delicate white ankle socks with ruffled tops.
“Which way do you reckon?” Harry whispered to Draco, squeezing his hand. Draco frowned and sniffed the air, the path on the right smelled like moss and the mulch you got in the Forbidden Forest, whilst the left hand one smelled faintly of clementines and cloves.
“Draco Malfoy I am going to ask you three questions, consider it your final exam,” she stated imperiously. Draco nodded and grinned.
“Oh wow,” Harry said, staring at the 3D image that was hovering in the air above them. “The head is ginormous – must inherit their brains from you,” he winked as Draco giggled. The alpha commented on the size of the head every time they had a scan and every single time he received a frustrated eye roll from Madam Pomfrey.
“Of course,” Draco nodded. Harry had actually been the one to find the apprenticeship posting, after Draco had mentioned he would love to one day get to work in that area. The idea of further education and even a job had seemed like such a ridiculous notion when living under Bellatrix’s roof. However, now, everything Draco wanted seemed so tantalisingly close.
about his baby, his and Harry’s baby, that was just intolerable. Draco had drawn his wand before he even realised he had reached for it.
“Where did I go?” Draco frowned in confusion as Harry let out a soft laugh and perched on the edge of the bed.
“Yeah,” Harry huffed, “I know, that’s why I was trying to find him. He just ran off and I was worried.”
Draco yelped as he found himself thrown backwards, his bottom skidding painfully across the stone slabs as his wand was yanked from his grip. The world started to grow dark as Draco let out hiccoughing sobs of fear, his bump felt bruised, as if something had hit it.
“Oh yes,” Smith chuckled, obviously sensing Draco’s surprise. “Kind of hard not to notice something like that when you’re standing in a transparent glass sphere.”
“Bollocks to that,” Harry muttered. Hermione had told him all about the Malfoys the previous week and from what she had said, it sounded like they had been absolutely loaded. Bellatrix must be sitting on a massive pile of gold that should for all intents and purposes be Draco’s.
“You haven’t lit a fire, aren’t you cold in just that nightgown?” Harry frowned, looking down at Draco’s slender frame. The gown’s fabric seemed pretty flimsy and Harry couldn’t imagine it kept much heat in.
“If it will make you feel better we can stop along the way and pick up some wine okay?” Harry suggested, his eyes following Draco as the omega moved to pull off the cardigan and walked towards the wardrobe to hang it up.
“W-When the baby’s born,” Draco explained, “please let me stay with you. I won’t be any trouble. I won’t b-be upset when you bond with someone.”
Although omega rights still weren’t great, if Bellatrix had her way Draco would have already been yanked out of school and mated off to some pureblood family.
“I’m already getting bonded!” Draco snapped back angrily. His aunt visibly recoiled, he had never raised his voice like that at her before.
. I know you can do this. You’re going to get to meet our baby sweetheart, you’re going to be a papa.”
“Don’t be deliberately obtuse,” Bella snapped before frowning suspiciously. “Why aren’t you stuttering? Normally I can barely get three articulate words out of you.”
“She’s stunning Draco,” Harry said truthfully, looking up to see that Draco’s grey eyes appeared slightly watery. “You look just like her.”
Harry shifted on the seat, he figured that was probably fair. Once Harry had made his circle of friends he didn’t give much thought to anyone else. He had occasionally heard himself described as ‘aloof’ and he knew he had inadvertently been a little too harsh in the past when rejecting offers, resulting in embarrassing floods of tears.
“Yes Alpha,” Draco nodded, his eyes slipping closed as Harry’s heart swelled with adoration. Unfortunately, nothing Harry did seemed to quite get rid of all the slick, so he was forced to carry a grumbling Draco over to the sofa whilst he changed the bed sheets. After that, he pulled a thigh length t-shirt over Draco’s shoulders, figuring the omega might prefer not to be naked when he woke up.
“Atherol would even take in your bastard sprog,” Bella hissed, her eyes flickering dangerously to Draco’s belly. “Can’t you see what a second chance you’ve been given here? I knew inheriting Narcissa’s looks had to be worth something in the end.”
“Please don’t,” Harry replied, “this is natural. You’re pregnant and all of this is to be expected.” Harry quickly licked his lips, “How do you want me?”
Draco looked back up, chewing anxiously on his lip as a stunning red headed woman made herself comfortable on Harry’s lap. Draco had seen her with the alpha before, the two of them exuding power and confidence. Perhaps Potter didn’t even like omegas? Even if he did he certainly wouldn’t be interested in Draco.
Draco wasn’t sure how much time passed before sharp fangs descended into his skin, piercing the flesh. He could hear himself scream although he hadn’t even realised he had opened his mouth, the sound a high and desperate wail as he found himself tripping into another orgasm before the world went dark.
“Yeah eventually,” Harry snorted, “although turns out that pregnant mares have quite a temper on them.” Harry paused and glanced up at Draco with a smirk, “You’re basically an angel in comparison.”
“Alright then, I’d better be off, I promised my girlfriend I’d meet her for a late lunch at the Three Broomsticks,” Felicity told him, reaching out to ruffle Draco’s hair.
Draco couldn’t help the laugh he let out as Hermione shot him a grin. He already liked the beta, she smelled safe and seemed kind enough, not to mention she was one of Harry’s friends.
“Oh dear,” Katie laughed, “you’d better get dressed now Draco. Do you want to borrow a nice big cardigan sweetpea? It’s getting colder out there and you can’t afford a chill.”
“I doubt that’s the whole truth,” Snape sniffed, crossing his legs and causing a bony knee to protrude through his black robes like some misshapen lump of coal. Harry frowned and glanced back to his godfather who was eyeing Snape wearily.
Draco excitedly pulled off his robes, leaving himself in his boxers and a thin t-shirt. He looked happily at the mound of lace, silk and frills, wondering which he should try first.
Draco could feel himself start to shake, his nerves had been growing steadily worse over the last month as Madam Pomfrey said a lot of his energy reserves would be diverted to the foetus.
“Draco’s the one with silver hair isn’t he?” Luna asked before turning to Dean and Michael, “I thought he actually ranked quite high up your list that you made?”
“Well I wouldn’t call it dating,” Ginny replied wryly, “and I’m not expecting us to end up married or anything. In fact, I’ve been scouted for the Harpies and you know how fit I think their seeker Angharad Lewis is.”
“Alpha…” Draco groaned, trying to turn his body so as to get closer to Harry. Harry took a deep breath, instantly regretting it as his nostrils filled with apple pie and frosted honeydew. Harry was already rock hard, his body’s natural response to the writhing, slicking omega in his arms. Harry began to get up out of the bath, careful not to knock into Draco. He wandlessly cast for the plug to start draining its contents as Draco gave a moan of displeasure at the alpha moving away, his omega perceiving a rejection.
“Tons,” Sirius shifted awkwardly, as if he was suddenly uncomfortable with the clearly emotional direction this was taking them in.
“That half-blood will never bite you,” Bella declared, as if delivering some sort of divination prophecy. Perhaps she thought she was, her eyes were wild enough and parts of her black hair had come loose in a tufted mane. Maybe her failed resurrection ritual from the previous summer had finally sent her stark raving mad. “How many times has he mounted you now? What exactly is he waiting for?!”
Harry turned to see a small group of what looked to be Fourth Years piling into the ward, a couple of them were sporting bloodied lips and one rather strained looking girl was holding her arm in an unnatural angle. Harry hurried forwards, calling out again for Madam Pomfrey before he asked the group what had happened.
Suddenly the branches behind Draco gave way and Smith let out a shout of surprise as the maze pulled back, creating a large gap. Draco felt himself topple backwards, only to be caught by strong arms and the smell of bonfire and cinnamon.
Harry glared at him as Hermione returned and Ron leaned over to kiss her with a smug look on his face.
“Fine,” Harry huffed, snatching up the quill and scribbling his name as quickly as possible. The whole thing left a nasty taste in his mouth. He knew that omegas were legally seen as property, even Molly wasn’t able to open a Gringott’s account with written approval from Arthur, but other than that Harry didn’t have many experiences with them.
Draco lifted his head up and licked his lips, Harry helped him get up so they could both peer into the trolley’s wide selection.
“Eton mess,” McGonagall announced to the gnarled stone gargoyle. The door subsequently swung open to reveal two other faculty members.
“Draco!” Harry waved cheerfully as they approached the bench. Harry was already sitting besides Ron and Neville but that wasn’t unusual as Draco had always preferred to be allowed to sit with Hermione, Katie, Padma and Felicity.
“And secondly, keeping his pregnancy was already a massive decision. Draco is mature enough to know what he wants and if he wants to be with Harry then you’re going to have to get off your stupidly high hippogriff and accept that.”
Harry narrowed his eyes as he saw Seamus grit his teeth, a small bead of sweat rolling down his temple as he focussed his wand. As subtly as he could, Harry cast a wandless impervious charm over Draco and Katie and then himself and Hermione.
“S-Stupid,” Draco huffed. Harry was pleased though, the omega seemed to have relaxed and the tremble that had previously been shivering through his body had subsided as he reached up to paw at Harry’s chin. “I just like yours.”
“You figured out where you’re going to live next year?” Ron asked, leaning back in his deck chair. Harry knew that Ron was moving in with Fred and George so as to save money. Their apartment over Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes had a small spare room and a well connected floo point so Ron could commute every day to the Ministry. Plus, that way, when Hermione returned from America they would hopefully have enough for a deposit on a place of their own.
Harry almost joked that the other boy was already pregnant but somehow he figured that might not go down too well. Draco had obviously been brought up in a very austere and traditionalist household with old fashioned views about omega purity.
Draco shot the alpha a small smile and shook his head, “It’s fine, your friends were really n-nice and helped me with it.”
“Poppy,” Professor McGonagall inclined her head, “I think perhaps we should visit the hospital wing.”
“No,” Draco whispered, shaking his head, “I’m s-sorry, of course you wouldn’t. I’ll go somewhere else, I p-promise. I’ll never bother you, I –“
“The apprenticeship wouldn’t start until December,” Draco fidgeted. He knew that on the days when he had to go in to the shop that there would be plenty of Harry’s friends willing to watch over their child for a few hours. Draco’s mind flashed to the welcoming enthusiasm of Molly Weasley. It also helped that she was another omega, meaning Draco’s senses already perceived her as safe.
“I’m here now,” Harry stated, bringing their lips together in a wet kiss, his tongue pushing into Draco’s mouth. Harry chuckled as he drew back and wiped away a trail of saliva on Draco’s chin with his thumb. “Messy boy.”
“You’re going to be such a good mother,” Harry murmured, “look at all this milk, fuck Draco you’re so swollen with it. You’re such a good omega.” Harry grunted as he squeezed his own thighs together, heavy denim creating friction across his erection. The entire cubicle smelled like apples, honeydew and milk.
“I’m okay,” Draco replied, he was actually feeling pretty hungry that morning. “I’m just too fat for my clothes.”
“Oh,” Draco looked surprised, “I was trying to move the bed against the wall, it’s better for nesting that way.”
“A little,” Draco admitted, “I cast a warming charm and I think I accidentally got your chocolate frogs because they feel all s-squidgy.”
Draco moaned before Harry pushed more of the silk into his gaping mouth with his fingers. Draco immediately sucked on the digits through the fabric, laving them with his own tongue and hollowing his cheeks.
“I take it you’re in a better mood then?” Harry muttered, reaching onto the nightstand for his glasses.
“Okay!” Damien beamed, rocking on his tiptoes. “Can we walk this way?” he pointed in the opposite direction to Harry and Draco’s compartment. “Only that’s the direction I was going in when I ran into you.”
“So you created a spell?” Remus asked, his eyes were now back on Snape as Harry watched the two men converse.
“I’ve tried those as well,” Damien sighed. Harry noticed that the boy had released quite a lot of his scent, probably inadvertently. It was a mixture of hyacinth and wood shavings, very pretty and delicate. Harry thought of Draco’s scent of apples and frost and how he could never seem to conceal his emotions with it.
Harry smirked as Snape seemed to catch himself arguing about something so ridiculous from seven years ago.
“Ah, no Harry,” Professor McGonagall shook her head awkwardly, “you may leave and well done for the match yesterday.”
Slowly, Harry began to push in. Draco gasped as the massive girth spread him wide. They stopped for a moment to allow Draco to shift his legs further apart, Harry helping and massaging his buttocks. Draco could feel Harry parting the globes of his arse so as to better watch himself enter the younger boy. Draco shivered, thinking of what Harry must be seeing, his hefty, blood swollen shaft impaling the omega.
Her, Ron and Harry were sat around a small corner table in the Hogshead, it was a quiet Monday afternoon and Draco was safely in his double Potions class back at school.
“Hey Draco, would you like me to take a picture of you and Harry?” Katie asked, coming back over, “Nick’s lent me his camera and I thought we could recreate that nice photo of your mum and dad on their engagement day, it looks like it was taken right about here – that’s the same tree right?”
“Well it’s the truth as far as Harry and Draco are concerned,” Remus informed them. “Technically you see,” he turned to Harry, “the inheritance will be under your guardianship, and only your signature will allow Draco to make withdrawals.”
“It’s okay,” Draco gave them both a small smile, “I don’t like Bellatrix or Rodolphus very much and they’ve n-never liked me either.”
“You’re so much warmer than I am,” Draco hissed, his nose wrinkling, “I think t-that’s why I couldn’t do it. My hands are cold no matter what I do.”
“I-Is it silly? Draco asked, looking down at himself critically. “Am I not old enough to wear something like this?”
Ron shot Harry a half questioning, half sympathetic look as Harry left the dorm rooms and travelled through the annexe into the main body of the castle. The two of them walked in complete silence as they proceeded down the long stone passageway towards the headmistress’s office.
Harry didn’t really mind that Ginny had gone back to Dean. Harry and her had been on again off again fuckbuddies for the last three years and he was pretty sure that when she grew bored of Dean, Harry would find her back in his bed with teasing words and clever hands.
Draco turned around and began rooting through his trunk and Harry wondered if he had somehow offended the boy? “Not that I think omegas should dress a certain way of course, I just…” Harry trailed off as he found himself with a lap full of faded looking fashion magazines, some of them appeared pretty dated.
“You want me to tell you what I thought about?” Harry asked, his voice sounding like he was grinning wickedly and Draco flushed as he tipped forwards with another whine.
Harry’s jeans tightened further, he could feel how wet he was with precome and he had to shift in the seat to ease his own discomfort. He regarded Draco thoughtfully before giving the boy’s breast another squeeze. “I’m proud of you Draco,”
Harry seemed to snap out of his daze, pushing back inside Draco. This new angle caused Draco to groan and throw his arm over his face, it was deeper and somehow now on every thrust, Harry was rubbing the most sensitive part of him.
“Make it two and I’ll whip up a walnut free batch just for you,” Harry grinned before he and Ron shook hands.
“That’s it baby boy,” Harry groaned, clasping Draco tighter to him and licking a stripe up his flushed cheek, he could taste the faint salt of tears. “You can scream for me if you want.”
“I’m sorry, it’s the shirt,” Harry explained, “I was wearing it in the club and there were a lot of people in there.”
Draco squirmed awkwardly, the necklace did look very expensive. He had honestly expected Harry to give him something for the baby, so it had come as a shock to realise this was most certainly just meant for Draco.
“I’m sorry Draco, you must think we were raised by wolves,” Remus said as Draco gasped and jerked his head to Harry. The alpha was chuckling as he brought his hand up to gently ruffle Draco’s hair.
“So, um, Draco I know you were a little worried about him being lonely with you coming here for Christmas,” Harry began, clearing his throat.
Harry got into the tub and looked over at where Draco was watching a lantern rise with glittering eyes.
“Some Christmas shopping in the cards then,” the lady beamed and Harry could feel Draco relax. “So loves, do you want anything from the trolley? Can I interest you in a chocolate frog? All proceeds going to the War Orphan’s Trust.”
“I heard you’re trying to bring back He Who Must Not Be Named,” a Ravenclaw boy called Erwin interjected, “that you did some sort of dark magic ritual and you’re growing something called a ‘horcrux’ in there.”
“Professor Turpentine promised we’d get to do more practical come the summer,” Harry murmured absently, using his middle finger to slide his glasses back up his nose before he sighed and gave up on his own reading material.
“Oh…” Harry made a small punched out noise as he stared across at Draco. “I um, is that from Olive’s? I haven’t seen that on you before.”
“Are you okay sweetheart?” Harry asked, pressing his lips carefully against each pale eyelid before Draco finally opened his eyes again. Harry frowned as he noticed Draco was shaking, he quickly sat up and ran his hands down Draco’s arms before reaching for the blankets to cover him. “Draco?” Harry started to panic, had he gone too fast? Had he hurt the omega in some way?
“Well I haven’t,” Harry retorted, frustratedly, wondering if the rest of his life was going to be spent defending his child’s lineage. He suddenly had a horrible vision of his and Draco’s kid at Hogwarts, being teased about his parents like Draco often was.
“The perils of being an omega I suppose,” Damien sighed, leaning back again the wall partition between compartments and fanning himself. The younger boy’s back was arching slightly with his hips tilted away from the wall and towards Harry. “We can’t all be big, strong alphas.”
“So, is there a reason you’re wearing a decorative throw?” Harry smirked. Draco tried to send the alpha his best glare but he didn’t think it worked as the man just laughed and shook his head. “Oh good, there’s a sofa up here too,” Harry remarked, looking over to a smaller green couch. “I’ll make myself comfortable and you can show me what you try on if you like?”
“Well,” Ron shrugged, “I don’t reckon people will care too much if that’s what you’re worried about.”
“What?” Harry snapped, turning to Hermione, whose shocked expression made him sag with exhaustion. Harry had spent all day yesterday and then most of the night thinking about the strange little omega squirreled away up in the hospital wing, clothed in a too big gown.
“How are you feeling?” Harry asked, getting in beside him. Harry was wearing green cheque pyjama bottoms but had chosen not to put on his usual t-shirt. Before sharing a bed with Draco, Harry had tended to prefer sleeping in boxers or nothing at all.
“I know,” Remus replied simply, “I wasn’t implying as much, rather that standing beside him as a traitor must have been even harder.”
“Oh it’s just like the Triwizard Cup all over again,” Hermione sighed, firmly grabbing Draco’s hand and leading him over to the Gaedere table.
“That selfish spell is the reason Harry now has a mate and child,” Severus let out a jolted awkward laugh.
“Don’t touch me,” Draco hissed, glaring up at the alpha and baring his teeth. Smith, however, just looked surprised for a moment before dissolving into laughter.
“I see,” Harry replied in a scathing voice. There was no way he wanted Draco’s money to be kept with such a company.
“I mean like, I know some omegas prefer more traditional things, dresses and stuff,” Harry continued ineloquently, no one he had ever been around had really shown an interest in fashion. Ginny just wore what made her look good whilst Hermione mostly opted for comfort, an attitude Harry tended to adopt for himself.
“You okay my love?” Harry asked, stroking Draco’s hair and chuckling as a mass of soggy petals fell out.
Draco had shyly asked Harry if they could keep the baby’s sex as a surprise and Harry had happily agreed.
“That would be me,” Harry continued, as if the Lestranges were in any doubt. Rodolphus had turned a strange shade of purple whilst Bellatrix’s nostrils were flaring like a racehorse. Harry could immediately scent that she was the other alpha here. The Hospital Wing door swung open a second later as Snape marched in, followed by a worried looking Madam Pomfrey and a tired looking Professor McGonagall.
After about five minutes, Madam Pomfrey was still dealing with various injuries, the ankle having turned out to be fractured in several places and not just sprained after all. Harry heard a distressed whine from inside the cubicle.
The entire place stunk of pheromones and there were definitely at least two omegas in the stages of preheat. Ron was already trollied, him and Michael Corner holding an overly loud and nonsensical conversation about gnome magic.
“Oh that,” Colum grinned, “yeah I think everybody’s heard about how Harry Potter knocked up some kid.”
“I got to keep a part of her in my world,” Snape stated, his voice was taut with misery and came out as a sob.
Draco was panting when he finally looked up, the omega’s face turning horrified as he registered the mess across Harry’s.
Occasionally, Harry would even receive letters from simpering parents of omegas near his age detailing just how wonderful their progenies were and how the families would be ever so delighted to welcome Harry at their estates in the south of France or skiing chalets in Switzerland.
After dimming the candles, Draco let his hand slip up and down his side. He was enjoying the sensory experience of the nest and the smooth silk of his nightgown felt chilled and slippery in comparison. He bit his lip as his hand rested on his hip bone before gliding forwards into the dip of his groin, very lightly brushing his soft cock.
“Well,” Harry smiled, “she loves babies and any kids I have are going to have her as like a default grandmother.”
Draco tried to imagine asking one of the other omegas like Damien to nest or cuddle with him. Evidently his emotions played out on his face as when he looked up both Hermione and Harry were eyeing him critically.
Remus laughed as he attempted to pair together a growing pile of odd socks. “I suppose we behaved rather appallingly earlier. It’s just…we didn’t expect this for you Harry, and then seeing Draco was honestly like stepping back in time for Sirius and I. You know Cissy’s wedding was the last time he ever saw Regulus? It was certainly the last time he and Narcissa exchanged words that weren’t curses.”
Draco frowned quizzically at his aunt. She was looking wholly smug as she gestured to Draco’s exposed neck. “He hasn’t bothered to bond with you.”
he should have stuck with sleeves. No one could accuse someone of being a wanton whore when they were wearing a good pair of sleeves.
“She’s not my girlfriend,” Harry snapped. “Plus, she’s with Dean now and quite frankly I’m a little miffed you guys are acting as if I went and actually bedded a seventeen year old omega!”
“Hi Olive,” Harry grinned ruefully, “Audrey was telling me all about your store opening the last time I was over at the Burrow so I figured I might stop by if that’s alright?”
“You’re looking for Draco right?” Neville called across the busy common room. “He went out the side door, think he was heading for the lake.”
“I am a grown man, Damien,” Harry said calmly, “if you think some school yard gossip is going to influence
Draco opened his mouth to talk but upon seeing Katie’s expression simply allowed himself to nod again.
“Where will you go?” Hermione asked, reaching across Harry to grab the nearest pitcher of pumpkin juice.
“I d-didn’t know,” Draco looked as though he was about to burst into tears, his eyes were already red rimmed and his bottom lip was wobbling. “I didn’t know i-it would do this.”
“Oh calm down Potter,” Smith snorted, “I’m not blaming you, he’s got a nice mouth.” The alpha smirked unpleasantly at Draco, who immediately clapped his hands over aforesaid mouth.
“You better bloody believe it,” Harry grinned, “Woman knows all my weaknesses and she’s learned a whole load of fancy spells from all those books of hers.”
“Surely a bit wonky doesn’t matter?” Harry offered cheerfully as Sirius made a clearly disagreeing noise on the sofa beside him.
“Yes, thank you,” Draco nodded. Harry rose to get up and sort out the bed Draco wanted moving when he felt small fingers around his wrist. “Harry,” Draco murmured, “you’ve been r-really kind in letting me keep my baby. You don’t have to do anything else for me.”
“Yeah alright,” Ron chuckled, “I just meant it’s a bit of a surprise that’s all. He’s not your usual type and I guess I never figured you’d end up with an omega. He looks like a strong wind might blow him over half the time.”
“It’s b-been happening this month,” Draco sighed. “Madam Pomfrey says it’s natural and I shouldn’t w-worry.”
Draco blushed but didn’t answer as opened his mouth wide and stretched his lips around the purpled head. It was obscene, Harry thought as he gazed down, the way saliva was escaping from the corners of the omega’s mouth, running down his chin as Draco pulled back off and then tried again.
“I’ll give you the completed forms back next lesson,” Severus informed him. “For now, please make yourself scarce. I need to don gloves and goggles for the next stage of this experiment and I will not be responsible for explaining any mishaps to that alpha lout of yours.”
“May I come in?” Harry asked, his voice already a low growl as he clearly forced himself to wait by the side of the bed. His entire body seemed to be vibrating.
“Thank you,” Draco replied politely, feeling rather comforted as the women of Gaedere House began feeding him various compliments.
Draco didn’t respond right away but Harry could see thin tear tracks down his own white cheeks. When Draco did speak, his voice was wobbly with emotion. “I love you Harry.”
“Oh gosh, that’s very thoughtful of you,” Remus smiled apologetically. “I’m so sorry, my name is Remus Lupin, I’m pleased to finally meet you.”
Draco could smell from the notes of grass and spearmint that it was Ron outside. The omega was also immediately very aware that he was only wearing an undershirt.
“Sirius,” Harry growled, his eyes flitting between his smirking godfather and the still closed patio doors. “I have
Draco shifted awkwardly, his denims were soaked through in places and the previously warm slick had chilled and was now freezing his skin in the snowy air. He tensed as Harry took a step closer and peered round behind Draco as if to check the damage.
Draco had yelped as he had stumbled into the cold stone wall, his books scattering across the corridor. With a resigned sigh he had crouched down to gather them all back up, hoping the ones he had borrowed from the library weren’t damaged enough to warrant a reprimand from Madam Pince.
Draco wasn’t saying anything, just fidgeting with a few loose pebbles on the ground beside him. Harry sat down next to him, trying to shield the younger boy from the biting wind.
“Yes,” Draco gasped as Harry’s hands cupped Draco’s breasts, squeezing them carefully. Harry ruched the silk up further so it piled over the lower half of Draco’s face, preventing him from seeing what was happening. Draco’s mouth fell open, tasting and wetting the cream silk as he felt a roughness across his nipple. Harry was licking Draco’s breast, sucking at the bud and flicking it relentlessly.
“Good,” Harry nodded, ushering Draco inside. “This is the Morgan Le Fay Suite by the way. Don’t worry, me, Ron and Hermione have somewhat claimed it, so we won’t be bothered.”
“You’re just being honourable,” Draco muttered. “You’re doing ‘the right thing’ because I’m p-pregnant.”
“Sweetheart, careful of your dress, I haven’t had these floorboards sanded yet and oh…” Harry swallowed thickly as Draco stood up and pushed his dress off completely, revealing that he hadn’t been wearing anything underneath it.
Draco nodded happily as he opened the door the Morgana Suite and tottered over to the wardrobe. He pulled out a broderie Anglaise dress in a pale blue cotton. It had delicate flounces on the shoulders and elbow length puffy sleeves. He knew that Harry hadn’t seen the dress before as he had ordered it online from Olive’s after his inheritance had come through. Olive had even included a beautiful pair of sandals and a long periwinkle ribbon which Draco used to tie his hair in a small plait.
Eventually, they reached a bed curtained off from view, behind which Harry could definitely smell the acrid fragrance of an omega in distress, it was like rust and acid and stuck unpleasantly in his nostrils.
Pomfrey pulled back the curtains, plastic hooks running along the overhead bar. Harry’s eyes immediately fell on the occupant of the bed. The omega was small and thin, probably too thin as his collarbones cut sharply across his milk white skin where the medical gown gaped open. His hair was a silver blond and his wide eyes were a pale grey fanned with fair lashes.
Draco let out a little gasp, the glass slipping from his fingers and the water spreading across the bed sheets.
“What’s wrong?” Draco questioned, glancing round anxiously as he heard the large front door being pulled open.
“Yes,” Draco keened, opening his mouth as Harry brought a hand forwards, allowing Draco to bite and suck on his fingers. “Yours alpha, I’m always yours.”
“Hard to tell with Sirius,” Harry shrugged. “Remus wrote me though, says that if we style it as some sort of rebellion against societal expectations then that’ll probably win Sirius over.”
“They’re very nice,” Harry agreed, suddenly imagining the omega in front of him dressed in that outfit. His throat went a little dry as he pictured Draco smiling to himself as he rolled sheer stockings up his pale legs.
“I’m waiting for June fifth, it’s Draco’s birthday and also the day after his final NEWT. I’m organising a marriage ceremony. I’d invite you come but it’s friends and close family only,” Harry told Bellatrix, each word falling heavily as a blow to her crumbling conniving.
“I don’t think Atherol Sourboll would be that interested now,” Draco laughed, looking down at his protruding belly.
“Oh I know,” Ginny sighed casually, “I just didn’t think you’d be dumb enough to get anyone else pregnant. But now I know you didn’t anyway.”
The ceremony passed in a wonderful blur of heartfelt words, laughter and the pervasive scent of apple pie. After the ritual, a grand buffet table was revealed, along with sliding glass doors, opening to a spacious, wood floored room inside the house, decked out ready for dancing.
“You sure?” Harry asked, giving Draco a careful look. “Luna told me just the other day that I can come off as kind of intimidating, I don’t…I don’t want you to feel that way okay?”
The thing was, they were both right. Harry knew that Draco was inexperienced and whilst he didn’t want to rush him, bonding bites always took better if they were administered during a mating. Harry wanted Draco to feel comfortable, yet on the other hand, his inner alpha was practically chomping at the bit now. Every time Draco smiled or looked Harry’s way, the older man felt like he was drowning in the desire to mount the perfect little omega carrying his pup.
Draco smiled as he felt gentle fingers trace the outline of his bond bite. He cracked open his eyes to see Harry standing beside him, gazing down at the younger man with a look of such raw and open affection, that it made Draco feel exposed in turn.
have complete access to my inheritance and right now most of it is sat gathering dust in Gringott’s. Honestly, let’s just treat ourselves today alright?”
,” Harry said as Draco tried not to wince. “But I’m here for you okay? I’m your alpha right now and if you ever feel cold or sad or hungry or
“Merlin, I’ve always known you were a piece of shit,” Harry laughed grimly, drawing his wand from his sleeve as Smith’s face hardened and he did the same.
“You w-weren’t disappointed then?” Draco narrowed his eyes suspiciously as Harry’s heart fell. He should have known Draco’s omega might take his failure to bite as some sort of rejection.
“What do you think?” Harry asked. Before Draco could answer however, the glass door rattled open, a mechanical bluebird above it trilling musically.
Draco screamed, the sound trailing off into a wrecked sob as Harry drew back to watch spurts of white come fly from his omega’s cock, splattering across Draco and Harry’s fronts in ropes of little glistening pearls. Harry snarled ferociously, driving himself up into Draco’s hole for a final set of pulsing thrusts before his knot inflated, so rapidly as to almost be painful as they were tied together.
Harry then tucked him carefully into bed, making sure no part of Draco touched the cold stone wall before crawling in himself and dimming the candles again.
“N-No,” Draco whined in protest as Harry drew back and began to reposition them. Harry paused, rubbing his fingertips lightly across Draco’s wet perineum.
“Of course not,” Harry stated, shaking his head, “so please don’t let this affect your day okay? We’re meant to be celebrating how ridiculously smart you are.”
“Yes, when Draco’s water broke,” Luna nodded thoughtfully, “about two minutes ago. I thought I’d come over and check if you needed any help getting up to the Hospital Wing?”
“Draco? May I come in?” Hermione called out. Draco hopped off the bed to unlock the door and allow the beta to enter.
I cannot believe this has kudos already, I’m super appreciative and grateful for the kind support but y’all are mad ballsy leaving kudos on a wip, I mean what if we get to chapter five and I dramatically kill off Harry in a toileting accident and have Draco begin a torrid but fated love affair with Filch?
money and I’ll still support him with mine and –“ Harry trailed off as he realised Snape’s expression had changed, he was still smiling but there was something a lot less practised and forced about it.
The woman made an aggrieved noise before there was a shuffling of fabric, “Luckily, Draco, it doesn’t matter what you want. What exactly are you hoping for here? To waltz off into the sunset with your alpha lover?”
“It’s okay Draco, I’m a beta and a friend of Harry’s. I think we should get you out of here hmm?” Draco turned round helplessly to see a dark skinned woman wearing Gaedere scholar robes smiling tightly at him. “My name’s Hermione,” she added.
“I’m so bloody done with winter,” Katie shivered as both of the Great Hall doors swung open to let in Hagrid, along with a biting gust of cold air. “It needs to be spring already, I’m telling you, the moment I see the first bluebell, I’m wearing shorts.”
“Mm,” Draco nodded, seemingly placated. He turned his head to nuzzle sleepily into Harry’s chest. “Thank you alpha.”
“Oh you know Harry,” Ron grinned, “so laid back he’s horizontal. I swear he doesn’t even notice half of the pretty omegas drooling over him.”
Harry’s stomach felt uncomfortable as he got out and towelled himself dry, roughly as if in penance. Merlin, he was the worst. Draco was the sweetest fucking kid whose trust he had finally earned. Harry sighed as he picked his glasses back up and rubbed the steam from them. He could get through this but he needed to pull himself together. Draco didn’t deserve to be lusted over by some drooling knothead.
“Hey Harry,” Seamus voice bellowed out across the dorm room and a second later the curtains were wrenched back. “I’ve got your omega here. He was standing outside looking worried and saying something about shopping…oh…”
Draco smiled and tried not to blurt out the first thing that came into his head, which happened to be that he thought Harry’s glasses made him look like a sexy professor.
“I’m sorry you had to do that,” Draco cringed, he had forgotten he’d promised to meet Katie at the west exit at noon.
“I’ll get it right,” Seamus grumbled, his face paling as he noticed Filch approaching them whilst aggressively wielding a mop.
Draco blushed horribly and tried to take a step behind Harry to hide his currently very dowdy outfit from view. He expected Olive to roll her eyes or make some kind of cutting remark but instead she just looked unreasonably delighted.
Harry narrowed his eyes in realisation. He was a fucking idiot, Damien was clearly flirting with him. The only reason Harry hadn’t noticed was because he had been so distracted worrying about Draco. Harry had also learned over the last couple of weeks that his alpha had really mellowed in certain areas since being around Draco.
“I am,” Harry said truthfully, “although I think it might well be me that spoils them rotten and buys things I shouldn’t.”
“Yeah – environmentally friendly! After the reception everyone can just dump their leftovers on the pile,” Harry nodded enthusiastically. Draco was looking a little pale as he shrugged.
“Ah,” Harry tutted, shaking his head, “don’t be shy. If you want it, you can ask for it. You know I’ll give you anything you ask for.”
In his desperation, Draco had been sidling up to Hermione and letting Katie play with his hair whilst pretending to be very put out about the whole thing. Harry, despite being kind, was still rather formal around Draco and the omega had simply figured the older man wasn’t interested in touching him. The idea that Harry might have been holding back as he was worried about Draco feeling uncomfortable came as a surprise.
“Of course,” Katie replied, nudging Draco’s shoulder carefully, “I’ve got a new sundress that I want to wear but I thought it might be a little short to have on whilst running about the castle looking for you.”
“That’ll be all those pregnant omega hormones in the air,” Ron rolled his eyes before they widened and he turned quickly to Hermione.
Draco felt himself flush with pleasure, both at his alpha acting proud of Draco and at the festival suggestion. Draco had really wanted to go to the one in Hogsmeade, never having had anyone to go with before. When he had heard his accident meant he would miss it, Draco had felt rather disappointed.
“Y-Yes,” Draco replied, whining as Harry lowered his hips so the thick jut of his now erect cock pressed a tacky line along Draco’s belly. “Wanted you here Alpha.”
want to start a family with you. Don’t misunderstand me, yours and Draco’s baby is always going to be your first child and in your life and you will be a bloody brilliant father but after we all graduate, Draco is going to go and live somewhere with the baby and you are going to be somewhere else.”
Draco couldn’t exactly say he was sorry to have not gone back to the Lestrange house that summer. Not that he had ever been truly mistreated there, just horribly ignored. Along with his aunt’s constant biting remarks over not being a pretty or good enough omega.
“Remus will deal with him,” Harry grinned, thinking of how after seventeen years, his godfathers were still absolutely enamoured with each other. He looked fondly down at Draco, watching as the omega fussed over Lyra, carefully wiping the bubbles from her skin. With a rising swell of absolute contentment Harry knew he and Draco would be the same, ten, twenty, fifty years from now, growing old together in this house with family and friends surrounding them.
“Nick says we should go somewhere nice this summer,” Katie sighed, rolling up the sleeves of her cardigan so they didn’t hang into her plate full of gravy. Harry realised that Katie must have bought herself a new one as this cardigan was almost identical to the one she had given Draco for Christmas, only it was bright blue. She looked like some sort of Sesame Street character and with Draco beside her in a smaller but no less fluffy version; the overall effect was quite humorous.
“This is Draco,” Harry said, giving the omega’s shoulder a small squeeze. “He’s quite into fashion.”
“Oh Merlin, not ‘Mr. Potter’, please,” Harry laughed, shaking his head. “That makes me sound ancient, ‘Harry’ is fine.”
“Just a little taster before our wedding,” Harry grinned, rubbing his nose against Draco’s, “only by then hopefully you’ll be able to dance.”
“Sorry to hear that,” Harry replied, “my friend Ron used to get travelsick too. His mum even bought him those special pressure bands but it never did any good.”
Harry had spent the last few months trying to imagine a future where he was bonded with someone else, only seeing Draco through the doorway as their child was dropped off at weekends or something. He
“My grandfather designed it,” the woman beamed, “One of a kind patent, you won’t find anything like it at any other festival.”
If he hadn’t read about how omegas sometimes passed out after bonding he would have been beside himself with worry by now. He dreaded to think of what might have happened if he had been forced to call for Hermione. Even the thought of it had Harry reaching for one of his larger shirts to drape over Draco’s nude form, protecting him from non-existent prying eyes.
“Draco?” Harry asked again quietly. He could sense movement and when he looked down he realised that Draco’s right elbow was rhythmically jabbing into the meat of Harry’s thigh.
“I’ve been thinking,” Harry murmured, his bright green eyes still fixed on Draco’s mouth. Draco didn’t want to start chewing again and somehow break the spell but he could feel saliva pooling uncomfortably on his tongue. “The books Madam Pomfrey gave me say that omegas really need a lot of physical contact in their second trimester and you’re nearly at that stage.”
“The bell’s already rung so you should be safe from any more stampeding hoards,” Harry told him and as Draco lifted his head the man had
Ron pulled a face at the word ‘womb’ and Harry couldn’t help but internally agree. What the fuck had happened in Harry’s life for him to be suddenly requiring reading material about ‘wombs’?
Venetia was a seventh year omega with perfectly curled hair and a porcelain doll face. She was objectively incredibly beautiful and always made it blisteringly obvious that she was hoping Harry would suddenly invite her to Hogsmeade.
“Perhaps,” Harry sighed, crossing over to the ensuite bathroom. “You should get into bed, you’ll get cold by the window.”
“Do you want me to rub it for you?” Harry offered. He was pretty good with sports massages that prevented cramp after particularly intense quidditch games.
“You okay?” Harry asked as he cautiously reached out one hand, stopping a couple of inches away from Draco’s goosepimpled skin.
Draco whimpered as Harry blew a gentle breath of air across the omega’s hole, the wrinkled furl contracting and gaping in turn.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, “You developed something called Frettlering Fever, don’t worry everything with the baby is okay,” he added quickly as Draco made a distressed noise. “Apparently it’s something that can hit pregnant omegas when they would otherwise have been having a heat.”
“Well there goes the last of the summer weather,” Harry sighed. He had been quite enjoying the warm evenings and the makeshift barbeque area that Benny Hardwick and Michael Corner had set up behind the back of the house annexe.
Draco looked over his shoulder, his cheeks were sweaty and flushed, his silky hair turning curly at the ends. “C-Can we…do we have time…”
Harry swallowed thickly, glancing down as Draco let out a snuffling murmur and burrowed closer to Harry’s chest, as if seeking out his warmth. Harry nodded his thanks as Ron stood up to pass them another fleecy blanket which Harry quickly pulled over Draco, tucking it in underneath his light frame.
The ancient metal bell in the Hogwarts clock tower began clanging loudly to signal the end of lunch and Draco’s attention was brought back to the Great Hall. He looked over to see with a pang of disappointment that most of the Gaedere students had already left, Harry Potter included.
“You’re not really my alpha,” Draco said quietly, still not looking Harry in the eye. “You don’t have to –“
Harry bit back a grin as he felt Sirius stiffen next to him. The other alpha was still intently staring at his book and ignoring everyone, but Harry could see his knuckles had gone white from tension.
“Oh!” Hermione emerged back from the wardrobe, her edges frizzy and a sparkle in her eyes. “I remember those. Gosh, she must think highly of you, they’re normally hidden away in her personal chambers. Did you see the one about the dragon?”
He followed Colum out of the back exit of the club and onto a damp cobbled street. “Oh yeah,” Colum laughed brightly, “that’s better.”
“Oh,” Madam Pomfrey looked a little surprised, she paused before nodding and exiting the cubicle. Harry could hear her scolding some Fourth Year for changing the colour of their friend’s sling.
“How are the wedding plans going, Harry?” Remus asked a moment later as the mood lifted. A gentle breeze trundled across the garden, bringing with it the scents of anise and fennel.
Draco’s labour lasted a gruelling sixteen hours and by the end, Harry’s hand was blossoming with bruises from the omega’s surprisingly tight and relentless grip. As he had promised, Harry didn’t leave Draco’s side, stroking his back and giving him words of encouragement and support as Healer Sweetbridge and Madam Pomfrey fussed about underneath the towel.
“No!” Draco interrupted, “It looks just like it, I meant…” Draco chewed his lip, “it probably cost too much.”
Draco swallowed, he wasn’t sure if this was going terribly badly already. He had expected formal introductions, perhaps polite enquiry about the journey. Instead, he followed the two strange men up a large metal staircase in silence. Harry reassuringly slipped his arm around Draco’s lower back as they ascended.
On the walls were several large canvases sporting paintings of the like that Draco had never seen before. Vibrant splashes of bold colour forming amorphous shapes that as soon as Draco thought he had figured out, the paint strokes seemed to reform as if tricking him. At the bottom right of most of the paintings were the black initials ‘L.E.’, bar the canvas that hung above the stairs, which read ‘L.P’.
“Probably no one will even care,” Harry finished bitterly as Hermione raised her eyebrows in surprise. “Don’t you remember last year? That scandal with Colin Brinespawn?”
Draco smiled shyly as he imagined being in the middle of a grand ballroom somewhere with Harry as his partner, the alpha looking down fondly at him as they waltzed across the floor.
“Heavens above…” Remus whispered, drawing away from Harry and gaping at the omega. Draco blushed under the scrutiny, not sure why the other man was so shocked, they were already well aware he was pregnant. “Sirius!” Remus yelled, angling his head slightly into the building.
Draco gasped, looking wide-eyed at Harry. “I d-don’t think alphas do that,” he blurted out before visibly cringing.
“Mum’s already knitting him some kind of maternity jumper,” Ginny sighed distractedly, pulling out her wand and checking the time.
Together they continued to modify the nest with Draco giving instructions until it looked exactly how he had always wanted. He hesitated at the edge of the bed, he could sense Harry’s magic all around him, holding the nest together with trails of cinnamon.
Draco clutched at his belly, realising that his stomach cramps might not be from overindulging on cake after all.
Draco frowned as load of Fifth Years poured out from the classroom in question, apparently there had been a late room change. Draco found himself stranded in the sea of grumbling students.
Draco flushed, he’d had no idea that people could see into the globe. It hadn’t been see through from the inside. Had other festival goers really watched everything that happened? It was a mortifying thought.
Harry shrugged, trying not smile as Sirius jumped up and stalked over to Draco. Draco blinked up the alpha with wide, nervous eyes. Apart from when they had first met, Sirius hadn’t engaged with the omega at all.
“Because I want you to know what I’m feeling,” Harry replied, his thumbs digging in and massaging the meat of Draco’s parted buttocks. “I want you to know what you do to me.”
Harry chuckled as he quickly cast a shield around the struggling but determined creature, allowing it to reach the roof with its prize.
“Hey – hey Draco,” Seamus called across the table, “I’ve been working on a balloon animal charm that I think your kid might like – watch this!”
Draco groaned, the touches were wonderful, incredible but it wasn’t quite enough. Here, in their nest, Draco knew he needed more. He was nervous though, the idea of being with someone for the first time was already overwhelming enough and now his brain was trying to process the sensations of the nest, his alpha and being pregnant simultaneously.
“You make a-all of these?” Draco asked, reaching out to rub the soft pink satin of a nearby blouse between his fingers.
“How about I take you shopping?” Harry offered, slightly surprised at himself for voluntarily suggesting an activity he normally avoided like the plague.
“Ugh,” Harry shuddered at the thought, “I hadn’t even considered that thank god, you know pureblood families wig me out.”
“Don’t be scared,” Harry murmured, reaching out to stroke through Draco’s hair. “I’d never hurt you.”
“Oh Harry,” Hermione sighed, “you know you’re going to have to put up with a lot more than that once the rest of school finds out.”
That evening, Harry walked out of the Morgana Suite bathroom to find Draco was wearing his strappy silk nightgown again. The creamy fabric appeared almost golden in the candlelight and his hair was down and curling at his nape.
“Yeah of course, give me a minute,” Harry told him, standing up and starting to pull off the red hoodie he was wearing.
“I love you too Harry,” Draco whispered a moment later, almost drowned out by the crackle and pop of the magical fireworks Seamus had begun setting off outside.
"Yes," Draco replied breathlessly, he could tell that Harry was being so gentle with him, so loving. He revelled in the sensations of Harry's warm, rough hands cupping his chest, the alpha's throbbing cock filling Draco's arse, moving carefully backwards and forwards in tiny increments. Draco's omega was purring happily at having been finally mounted by his alpha. He bit his lip and closed his eyes before rolling his own hips forwards, causing Harry's length to slip backwards, dragging hotly against his walls. Harry let out a strained noise as Draco grunted at the fizzles of ecstasy he could feel deep within him.
In the end, both alphas had been allowed to compete. Right before the final trial however, an auror enquiry had revealed a nefarious plot by a former Death Eater that was quickly dismantled. Despite having been two points in the lead, Harry had graciously volunteered to step down from the competition after the tampering was brought to light. This had allowed Cedric Diggory to go on and win the tournament.
“They own Primeltränke, you know the European chain of apothecaries?” Damien continued. “Noah Bachmann is the deputy finance minister for the Swiss Wizarding Commerce Chamber.”
“Mm,” Draco nodded, he looked down as Harry’s own hard length pressed against his thigh. “S-Should I…I mean
Once everything was settled, Draco returned from the bathroom to find Harry waiting by his bed. “You could have gotten in b-before me,” Draco told him.
“Wait until she’s a teenager,” Draco smiled, rubbing the tip of his finger against Lyra’s pudgy cheek.
The issue was that Draco hadn’t quite worked up the courage to wear any of his new clothes in front of other people yet. Even though Professor McGonagall had told Draco that he was permitted to forgo the usual school uniform. Harry had seemed a little disappointed at first, questioning if maybe the omega didn’t like them after all.
Draco had woken up on Friday morning feeling rather worse for wear. Any discomfort, however, seemed to fizzle away as soon as Madam Pomfrey told him that the baby was okay. On Sunday, he had been discharged from the Hospital Wing and Harry had walked with him all the way back to the Gaedere House annexe.
Harry grunted as he felt Draco’s tongue darting out and licking at the head of his cock, soft lips mouthing messily at the glans. He took a moment to gather himself and refocus his own effort, carefully prising apart Draco’s buttocks to reveal his hole. Draco’s scent had gathered thickly at his entrance, slick already weeping out and dribbling onto Harry’s chin. Quickly, not wanting to waste a drop, Harry lapped it up, laving his tongue against Draco’s wrinkled pink whorl. The golden hair darkened with saliva and Draco let out a stuttered moan, his breath hot on Harry’s hard shaft.
“You’re beautiful sweetheart,” Harry stated calmly, marvelling at how such a sweet, wonderful creature was placing so much trust in him. “Would you like me to touch you?”
Harry had his sights set on the aurors and whilst Sirius had scoffed at the concept of extra voluntary schooling, Remus had been very pro the idea. The quiet and fiercely intelligent werewolf had batted Sirius over the head and told Harry that he should opt to stay at Hogwarts for as long as possible before being thrust into the drudgery of working life.
. So how about tonight we crack open some beers, wheel out the last barbeque of the year and pretend like…” Ron trailed off
“I think you need to go out tomorrow night,” Ron said quietly, “your alpha’s got to be going crazy being around an omega that smells like you all the time. You need to get it out of your system and get your head on straight.”
“He’s so much like his father,” Snape said, his voice seeming to find strength again as he wearily sat back up against the stone bench.
“I’m sure he’s fine Olive,” Harry grinned, “Draco’s only two months pregnant, although I’m surprised you didn’t notice his scent earlier.”
“It’s nice,” Draco said, as looked around. The study was a pleasant, comfy area with a sofa and a deep armchair along with an antique rocking chair upholstered in a dark blue. There were several tapestries and paintings on the walls and a fireplace with a wrought iron grate. Draco peered around the corner to see that there was also an area with a large four poster bed.
“Not to mention that stutter of his,” Ron agreed as Hermione elbowed him. “What? I wasn’t making fun. I just meant maybe it makes talking a little hard.”
“This place is wonderful,” Draco sighed happily as Harry finally led them off of the dance floor. Harry took the omega’s hand as they strolled further into the house, quickly checking in with Molly who was cooing over a sleeping Lyra. She shooed them away, reminding Harry that she was babysitting that evening and they needed to enjoy themselves.
Draco blushed, feeling pleased. He had never been allowed to indulge in his love of clothing before. Aunt Bella always considered anything with extra decoration or, god forbid, lace, as nouveau riche and frivolous.
Harry’s body was large and muscular, brown and still damp from the shower. Wiry black hair curled across his chest, leading down in a thick trail past his belly to where his cock and balls hung heavy between his legs. Draco swallowed tightly, Harry’s prick had seemed quite intimidating at first but at the same time it made Draco swell inside with need. Draco realised that Harry wasn’t moving anymore and when he jerked his eyes back up to the alpha’s face he could see that the older man was staring back at Draco, his expression dark and hungry.
“No deal! Harry would kill me!” Draco grinned as Severus tutted loudly and pretended to throw the application in the bin.
“Snow at Christmas,” Hermione grinned, squeezing his hand as they both looked up to the whirling swirls of white that were descending on the garden, “must be the first time in years.”
Harry nodded, he had already thought all this through with Hermione. They would make sure that one of them, or at least one of the other girls that had so taken to Draco, would be with him at all times in shared common areas. The rest of the time, Draco would either be in class or in the Morgana Suite which was well equipped with a study. Professor McGonagall had even helped transfigure a small kitchenette area so that Draco could cook if he didn’t fancy the Great Hall or bothering the house elves.
Harry sighed as he sat down on the unmade bed. This large airy room was Sirius and Remus’, whilst Harry and Draco were going be staying in Harry’s childhood room on the other side of the apartment. Draco had already gotten excited about seeing where Harry grew up and even insisted they drink their teas on the balcony outside, despite the winter chill.
“Yeah, but I didn’t say anything about the spell,” Harry replied. “You know Sirius…I mean I love him, he’s great but…”
“Ooh, you’re going to start showing soon,” Katie told him excitedly. “Nick, that’s my boyfriend, keeps hinting we should start having children.”
picking fights!” Hermione scolded before pausing, “What’s wrong? Why are you doing that with your nose?”
Harry ushered Draco back into the changing room, winking at the omega before pulling the curtain shut.
Draco looked across to where Ginny was peering at them with interest, Seamus and his friend Dean too. Draco already felt like a kid who had wet himself and needed Harry to carry around his dirty clothes, he didn’t think he could bear to isolate himself even further from all of Harry’s adult friends who were clearly eager to get into the maze.
“I didn’t –“Draco began before snapping his mouth shut. He couldn’t let Bellatrix goad him into revealing anything that could harm Harry or be used against them. Thankfully, she seemed to have forgotten about Draco’s explanations of the spell back in October.
“I really am sorry Mione, I just freaked out okay? You should have heard the lecture Madam Pomfrey gave us about stress and male omega pregnancies.”
Harry made up his mind to write to Remus when they got back to school, the werewolf having trained in legal affairs. Maybe as Harry was Draco’s temporary alpha, there was some way they could get him his funds.
“May I touch you, Daddy?” Draco asked, his eyes flicking to Harry’s purpled cock, straining with arousal, having been denied release for so long now.
Harry wrinkled his nose before sighing and gently carding his fingers across Draco’s scalp. “You see? I don’t even know if Draco’s had any weird cravings. What if
Without another word, the Lestranges turned on their heel and marched out of the Hospital Wing, leaving Harry to wonder what in the hell he had just done.
Harry glanced across to Draco, the younger boy was gesturing animatedly at Neville and Katie whilst they discussed some sort of semi sentient plant that had recently been discovered in Brazil.
“I’m not sure,” Harry admitted. He had honestly been watching Draco pretty closely to see if his pregnancy was showing but the boy tended to wear quite loose fitting robes, probably to stop the rest of the student body gawping at him. Even his nightgown had been very deliberately shapeless.
“I- I’m sorry,” Draco stammered, hugging his arms tightly around his upper body which was still violently shaking. “I’m so sorry, I d-didn’t mean to. I made a mistake.”
Venetia screamed hysterically, raving about how Draco wanted to now get rid of any competition for Harry’s affections.
Draco let out a horrified gasp, everyone knew that sugarplum silk had to be dipped in cold honey water in order to be cleaned.
Draco noticed that Harry’s eyes were still fixed on his chest and when the omega looked down he let out a panicked squeal. Harry flinched in surprise as the omega folded in on himself, hiding the damp spot with his hands. Draco’s face was bright red and his grey eyes were wide and panicked. The omega’s scent carried distinct motes of embarrassment and distress.
“Please,” Ginny rolled her eyes, “you mention ‘babies’ and she goes all goo goo eyed. Besides, why would she be mad at you? Her and Dad started shooting ‘em out straight after school.”
Even so, Harry didn’t want a single bit of their ceremony to not be how Draco wanted it, so it was imperative he try to get the omega to confidently voice his opinions.
“Y-You were my mum’s cousin?” Draco asked. He could feels his eyes prickling with tears, as often happened when he thought about the woman he had never gotten to know.
“Yes,” Harry answered forcefully, nuzzling into Draco’s neck and scenting him with calming pheromones. “Let’s go have our baby.”
“And yet,” Snape stated, his voice seething with misery and bitterness, “I got to keep a part of her in my life.”
Draco took a gulp of the water and nodded before frowning back at Harry. “Weren’t you out last night?”
“He’s not a child,” Snape replied coldly, “I would have thought you would be the last person to wish him to be perceived as one. I have a multitude of old spell and potions journals and had forgotten which one contained that spell. I had also underestimated Draco’s loneliness and discontent, provoking him into using an unknown spell on himself.”
“Brilliant,” Harry sighed happily, lifting one of his hands away to gently cup Draco’s face. “That’s our baby.”
“To be fair Mione,” Ron frowned, “you do have a lot of causes, I mean house elves, magical creatures, omegas…”
Harry smiled softly, “To be honest, I tried but I think my alpha would prefer to be between you and the door if that’s okay?”
“Aren’t you cold?” Harry frowned, Colum was still only wearing his t-shirt and there was probably an overnight frost coming.
“Don’t be,” Harry shook his head, “this is the best I’ve ever felt.” He realised as soon as he had said it that he wasn’t even lying. Nothing could ever compare to this feeling that was threading underneath his skin at Draco’s touch.
“Sorry!” Draco exclaimed, hurrying to unclip his dungarees whilst Katie and subsequently Hermione came over to help him into the blue dress.
“Of course I do!” Hermione screeched, lifting her hands up. “I’ve being going on about the way we treat omegas for years, not that anybody listens to me,” she muttered under her breath.
“You okay with the crowds?” Harry asked, nudging Draco’s side and wrapping his fingers around Draco’s mitten clad hand.
Harry frowned, wondering if he could excuse himself yet and go see if Draco had made himself sick on pickled ginger.
“Oh darling, I will. I just thought it might be a bit overwhelming for us to bond during your first experience,” Harry frowned, feeling angry at himself. “I
“If you’re trying to imply the baby’s not mine, you’re wrong,” Harry snapped irritably. “Circe, not you too Remus. Draco isn’t after money or my name, he isn’t trying to ‘lock down’ an alpha as Sirius so tactfully implied and he bloody well isn’t lying about the baby’s paternity. I was there when Madam Pomfrey cast the magical signature spell and there again when a St. Mungo’s healer did exactly the same thing.”
lovely,” Harry murmured softly. “Despite how people have treated him, he’s still so willing to talk to everyone.”
“Damien, I think I know where this is going,” Harry said grimly, his demeanour turning stiff. He noticed Damien flinch slightly as Harry’s posture turned more hostile.
Harry felt himself moving forwards before his brain could fully catch up. He pulled back the curtain to three shocked faces. A tall, raven haired woman with a jagged scar across her throat, a stout man in a burgundy waistcoat and Draco, whose face was horribly puffy and swollen.
“I w-wasn’t an ugly baby!” Draco protested, although he didn’t actually have any evidence to prove otherwise.
“Seamus, might I suggest that you simply buy the baby a teddy bear?” Luna stated looking surprisingly content for someone who had cold custard dripping down her nose.
“Oh,” Draco allowed himself to be helped up by Harry before falling into place beside him on the walk back to the annexe. “I d-didn’t know whether we were going shopping today.”
“You haven’t let Bella anywhere near the bump have you?” Sirius grimaced. “She hasn’t been chanting Latin or drawing any dark looking runes?”
There was resounding response of excited squeals and Ron’s groan of relief as everybody hurried forwards.
“Oh go chase a ball or something,” Severus drawled, suddenly throwing back a large portion of his robes to reveal something with dramatic flair.
“You’re so beautiful Draco,” Harry whispered, starting to thrust in and out, “you’re so perfect for me, I’m going to take care of you always.”
Draco was still staring intently down at his bowl of soup but he thought he recognised Toby Flint’s voice. “You really think someone with their pick of omegas would bother getting it up for
“Potter won’t bond with you,” Smith stated, bringing up his index finger to stroke the bottom of Draco’s chin. “If he’d being going to, he would have done it when you first told him you were with child. You need to start thinking about your other options pretty omega, before it’s too late.”
“Harry,” Draco repeated, his speech was slurred and he could feel his eyes start to glaze over. His own cock was hard again, pulsing and throbbing almost painfully. “P-Please – bond me.”
“We’ve cancelled that St. Mungo’s Healer your headmistress called for,” the man announced. “You know if one of them gets a whiff of this it’ll be all across the London gossip rags by lunchtime. We’ve arranged for Healer Schmidt to come sort you out instead, she knows where her bread’s buttered.”
“You alright in there Dear?” Olive called out, peering through the gap as Draco let out a panicked noise and tried to twist himself out of sight.
“Oh it’s on!” Harry suddenly laughed, a loud and brilliant sound and he sprinted across the globe and kicked up a cloud of snow to shower down on Draco. Draco squealed in surprise before relief flushed through him and he began giggling and joining in on the fight.
“I like it when you eat,” Harry hurried to reassure him, “I mean, I don’t want you to feel ill but it’s good to know you’re getting enough sustenance.”
“Actually, I’m feeling a little hot in this silly big jumper,” Damien laughed. The pretty omega stopped to pull off his knitted green sweater to reveal he was only wearing a t-shirt underneath. Harry was also immediately blasted in the face by a thick, sugar sweet smell. It was like Damien’s natural odour but even more condensed.
“I’m fine,” Draco replied, amazed he hadn’t stuttered. His trembling had died down and he was surrounded by Harry’s scent and Hermione’s warmth.
“I’m back!” Madam Pomfrey trilled as she flew through the curtains and bore down on them. “How’s it going in here – oh my goodness! Well I can see that the massage was successful, that’s good. You must be feeling a lot lighter Draco.” She continued to bustle about as if nothing was the matter, as if the entire room wasn’t thick with pheromones and Harry’s arousal.
“Am I a self absorbed arsehole?” Harry blurted out under his breath. Hermione froze for a moment, staring at his questioning expression before snorting a loud laugh. “Oh thanks,” Harry muttered, “that’s reassuring.”
Harry shook his head as Ron and Hermione made noises of protest. “I don’t mean I think he’s still quivering in fear every time he sees my face. But just, because of
“I see,” Snape smiled, the corners of his thin pale lips curving upwards. “Well then, I’m sure you can get your future Potions Master to explain to you why any First Year with half a brain would be able to recognize the difference between a feverfew draught and a gurdyroot suspension.”
“Right then, thank you for all portraying me as some sort of Scrooge who needs drugging to be an amenable host,” Sirius huffed, shaking his head and walking towards the staircase. “I’ll go let the poor sod in then shall I?”
“I’m sorry,” Harry apologised with a friendly smile, trying to make sure he wasn’t giving off any intimidating pheromones. The boy was more petite than Draco and Harry was very aware of his own large size.
“So what’s it like?” Ron hissed, glancing round to check Hermione wasn’t coming back yet. “You know, with an omega?”
“Think you can cream for me Draco?” Harry asked, barely conscious of the words that were even slipping unbidden from his lips. “Can you cream yourself for Daddy?”
“It was bloody annoying during exam season,” Sirius huffed, walking over to them and depositing a load of levitating mugs on the table. “They’d make us sit in alphabetical order so I was always next to Cissy and by the second hour I’d be starving and there was your mother smelling like sodding apple pie.”
Harry very carefully rolled them over so their positions were reversed. In the end they settled with Draco’s buttocks and back supported by Harry bending his knees up like the back of a seat. Harry sighed with relief as he sunk down into the soft bedding, not even minding how drenched and sticky it was.
“You’re not going to do anything ridiculous like bond bite him are you?” Hermione narrowed her eyes.
Half an hour later, Draco was dressed in a new, warm pair of trousers and novelty underpants with a Christmas pudding on them. Harry had taken his coat back and was shooting Draco worried, furtive looks as they made their way towards the food stalls to meet up with the others.
“Right,” Sirius huffed, folding his arms across his chest, “well it’s a bloody good thing you got your looks from her. Cissy was a stunner, even if she was a little too aware of it sometimes.”
“Ronald Weasley if you open that door I will hex your bollocks off,” Hermione declared loudly, winking at Draco who let out a surprised laugh.
“Not because I didn’t want to,” Harry rushed to explain, “but again, I thought you might like a little more time before we did that.”
“It’s to do with the venue,” Remus smiled, drawing his briefcase up onto his lap and rummaging through it for a blue binder which he passed over to Harry.
He and Ron were sat on the roof of the Gaedere annexe, wearing large puffer jackets and sharing a few cans of beer. It was February already and Draco was now five months pregnant. Harry wasn’t quite sure where the time had gone but whilst he had been horribly busy with training, Draco too had found much of his time occupied by NEWTS preparation.
“I’ve had a cold!” Olive exclaimed, still looking rather put out. “I only knew when I saw the bump and -“
“That’s good isn’t it?” Hermione furrowed her brow as she continued to skim along a page in her book. “Give you a chance to get on Robards’ good side before you even begin in London.”
“Just as a p-part time assistant,” Draco explained, “they’re offering apprenticeships to those with the right grades, the owner is big on inventing new elixirs and I thought…” Draco trailed off, biting his lip.
“Um, mate?” Ron began hesitantly when there was suddenly a loud pop and a balloonful of custard exploded across the table, drenching several of the nearby diners in sticky dollops.
Draco blushed a little at the idea of Harry finding him clutching the alpha’s underwear, so he quickly tucked the pile underneath the pillow on the bed. They were out of sight but the placement still allowed their comforting scent to saturate the area. Draco moved the bedding and clothes around a few times but nothing quite satisfied him. He stood impatiently with his hands on his hips staring at it before diving back in with a plan.
“Draco,” Snape began in a voice far kinder than Harry had ever heard it directed at him or his peers. “Calm down and explain. What did Potter do to you?”
“Do y-you have anything with ginger in it?” Draco asked. “And maybe something sour? Actually do you have anything pickled? Or m-maybe caramel?”
Harry felt the anger leave him as quickly as it had come. He stood back with a sigh, rubbing the bridge of his nose between his fingers.
Draco knew that most of the alphas in his year at school were always going on about the pertness of Damien Tuppence’s bottom. The other omega probably had baby smooth skin and not a bit of dimpled flesh in sight. Ginny Weasley was a professional athlete, Draco remembered mournfully, the red head was bound to be svelte and toned. Currently, Draco was feeling a bit like a stick insect with engorged wobbly bits.
“Try?” Harry said, somewhat pleadingly. He couldn’t help but feel jealous again that Draco was confiding in Hermione but not him.
“Fuck!” Harry exclaimed, panting loudly as he orgasmed, painting the tiles with ropes of hot come like a pornographic Pollock. His chest was still rising and falling rapidly as he sagged against the wall, one arm up to brace himself. The steady stream from the shower was beating against his hunched shoulders.
Draco realised he was going to have to swallow before he accidentally drooled all over Harry Potter. He quickly ducked his head to do so, causing himself to splutter a bit.
“Bloody hell, I’m not looking forward to my hangover tomorrow morning,” Ron groaned, slumping into the armchair next to Harry. Ron’s face was flushed nearly as fiery as his copper hair and Harry could see that his friend was shooting furtive looks across at Hermione.
“No,” Harry huffed, pressing his finger under Draco’s chin and forcing the omega to look up at him again. “When I first found out about the spell and decided to let you keep the baby,
“Merlin,” Harry laughed, trying to play it off, “if you’re telling me you can smell who I’ve been in bed with then that Weasley-Delacour summer party last year must have been an eye opener for you.”
“Oh yes,” Snape pulled an expression of distaste, “I had forgotten that your other half was also predisposed towards the canine form.”
Draco’s heart fell as he braced himself to be thrown out of the shop. Olive would be perfectly within her rights not to want an unmated pregnant omega as a member of her clientele. It was painfully clear in this state, and also from his scent, that there was no bite on Draco’s neck and he had already mentioned to Olive that he was still studying for his NEWTS.
“Well,” Harry grinned, “they’re sleeping in their coop right now at the bottom of the garden but tomorrow I can introduce you to our peacocks.”
“Harry man! We’re going to be late, it’s five to,” Seamus slapped the table in front of them making Draco yelp and jerk up off the bench.
Draco smiled shyly up at him, “I don’t think the other customers would like it very much if we bonded here.”
Draco let out a surprised moan before writhing on the sheets, his feet slipping in their attempt to find purchase. Harry loved how he could wrap his entire hand around it, completely enveloping Draco’s cock in the heat of his palm, even Draco’s dick felt slightly cool to the touch.
He huffed and stood back up, cradling his bump as he walked over to the wardrobe and pulled it open. Inside was a stack of all the extra bedding that Harry had procured for him. This along with a sizeable amount of Harry’s own clothes, given that the alpha was basically living full time in the Morgana Suite with Draco now.
“I was always warned not to eat the yellow snow,” Harry frowned suspiciously down at his own icicle before shrugging and smiling at Draco, “bottoms up!”
“Have you told Remus and Sirius?” Hermione asked in a strange parallel of when they had first found out about the baby.
“We had the Sourbolls over for tea last week,” Bellatrix continued as Draco tensed. “Enjoyed a lengthy discussion with young Atherol.”
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, “they didn’t sound too surprised though, I reckon it was pretty obvious at Christmas how I felt.”
“Not because it’s bad!” Harry rushed to say, having noticed Draco’s shifting scent. “Quite um, maybe too much the opposite?”
Harry hissed as his heated body was enveloped by the freezing water, he wandlessly cast another chilling spell to make sure he didn’t raise the temperature of the bath too much so as to not be as effective in helping the feverish omega. Harry wrapped his arms carefully around Draco’s bump before letting the younger boy’s head loll back against his chest.
Harry smiled before glancing over to the staff table. Hagrid sat down and gave him a jaunty wave, whilst Snape was eyeing him dubiously as if he highly suspected that Harry was ‘up to something’. Then again, Snape had pretty much looked at Harry that way for the past eleven years.
Harry smiled softly as he guided Draco back over to the curtained section. “It’s okay, I understand Draco. Why don’t you take that dress off now, you know you’re getting it and you can try the rest of the stuff on.”
Harry pulled a face, the more he heard about Bellatrix Lestrange the more he intensely disliked the woman and he had already thought she was a piece of work from their first meeting in the Hospital Wing.
Draco tried to roll his eyes like he had seen Harry’s friends do but secretly his omega was absolutely preening at the praise and attention from his alpha.
Harry grunted as copious amounts of slick and come puddled across his trousers. Maybe Draco had had the right idea with actually undressing first. Although Harry wasn’t sure about how happy he would be with Draco putting his dress back on to mingle with other people, given that it was only lying a few feet away from them and would surely be drenched with the scent of their coupling by now.
Draco drew away from the kitchen, not wanting to hear any more. He padded softly back to the living room and found Harry through the crowd. The older man was talking to a petite blonde woman that Draco could tell was an omega, the two of them were laughing about something Draco couldn’t hear. The woman was wearing a tight fitting purple dress that cinched in at the waist and highlighted how incredibly trim she was. Draco absently reached up to finger the straps of his pinafore, having had the horrible realisation that such a style of garment was probably only emphasising his immaturity.
“I also hope,” Harry sighed, shifting to draw closer towards Draco and causing the omega to naturally roll into the dip the alpha’s weight was creating, “that you know me well enough by now to realise I would never take advantage of you.”
“You never used to complain when I woke you up this way,” Ginny arched her eyebrow as Harry shot her a look. She laughed and slumped back down, “Fine, fine, I just wanted to say sorry for my part in winding you up about Draco over the last month.”
“Please don’t be upset,” Harry said as they passed a jolly looking wizard handing out German wurst and paper cups of glühwein. “It was a natural omega reaction and completely my fault.”
“Fuck, Draco. You want my cock baby? You want your alpha’s cock?” Harry asked quickly, his words almost a slur with excitement and approval. “It’ll be so good sweetheart, I promise I’ll make you feel good. I’d never hurt you Draco, I love you.”
“Goodness gracious,” Madam Pomfrey clicked her tongue as she rushed over, “I swear I get more accidents from these Saturday morning practices than during the entire week put together.”
Draco chewed the inside of his cheek, fidgeting with his hands before Harry laid his larger one over them, stilling his fingers. “It,” Draco sighed, “it doesn’t look like the other omegas’ ones, in Slytherin.”
The bell rang and Draco, having pre-emptively packed his bag, sped for the door before anyone could stop him. The Great Hall was already plenty busy as Draco walked in, however a significant hush fell as he went to take his usual seat.
“Don’t be absurd Draco, it doesn’t suit you,” Severus sniffed coolly, “I see that Potter’s inflammatory attitude is catching after all.”
“It’s kicking!” Draco gasped, his hand splayed across his belly. Harry looked down and stared at Draco’s bump for a moment as he stabilised himself.
In the middle, sat a gigantic cake covered in different shades of frosting. On one tier, miniature green sugar dragons raced around, toasting decorative marshmallows with puffs of flame. On another, Draco could see magically blooming lilies and narcissi being visited by honeybees that looked like they had been fashioned out of pieces of toffee popcorn.
The picture showed a young woman with almost white hair, standing out on a balcony overlooking grand formal gardens. It looked like it was probably part of some manor house. The woman was laughing and leaning back against the balustrade as the breeze caught her blond locks. She was wearing a dress almost identical to the one Draco was in, only hers was perhaps more lilac in colour. She also had on glittering, expensive looking jewellery and her hair was in loose waves behind her shoulders.
“I see Professor Sprout has planted more fairywand this year,” a low and slippery voice came from behind Harry as he sighed. Severus Snape and Harry had been meeting with more begrudging regularity as Draco’s due date approached. Snape had taken it upon himself to research in great detail the best potions to support and aid in labour. Male omegas often found the process quite traumatic and Harry wanted more than anything to avoid any unnecessary pain or discomfort for his mate. Today, however, they were further meeting regarding the matter of Draco’s inheritance and legal affairs. Harry glanced across the lawn to see that Remus had also arrived and was giving his godson a small wave as he approached.
Draco whined pitifully as Harry plunged in and out of his hole, gaping now and dripping with slick. Omega instinct had kicked in and Draco could feel his body trying to cling to Harry’s shaft, suck it up deeper still. Draco bit his lip hard enough to taste rust, but he couldn’t stave off his own orgasm any further, crying out loudly, wailing as he felt himself come, his cock shooting across the bed and his balls tightening against his perineum.
“That’s what the spell does,” Remus concluded, his eyes widening with realisation. “It allows you to keep some part of the beloved in your life.”
“For all his impulsivity, my Padfoot is fantastically predictable,” Remus told Harry fondly as he passed him a cup of hot mulled wine, it smelled of nutmeg and star anise. Remus sighed and took a sip of his own mug. “Has it really been seventeen years? You know it shocked me when he said that. Sometimes I forget I’m not twenty-one anymore.” Remus glanced over at Sirius, who now appeared to be in the middle of telling Draco a story about Narcissa putting spiders in Bellatrix’s cereal. Draco looked equal parts horrified and delighted.
Draco could see now that the building probably did used to be a warehouse. The ground floor seemed to be some sort of garage cum workshop with various muggle vehicles in different states of disrepair. Upstairs, however, was rather magnificent in Draco’s opinion. The stairs led them to an open plan conversion with exposed brick walls and light wooden floors. There was a humungous window looking over the river and letting in plenty of light. A sleek steel finish kitchen boasted an island with tall barstools, dried herbs hanging above the hob. There was a rather indulgent looking area with long leather sofas and a roll down projector screen.
“Circe’s tits,” Remus suddenly laughed, causing both Draco and Sirius to stop what they were doing and peer curiously over at him. “Oh, James would have
“Dennis says he saw an alpha come and join you,” Damien continued. Everyone around them had shuffled closer, no conversations had restarted. “And that it was
“Katie is muggleborn,” Hermione announced, “as am I. I think perhaps our perception of omegas is a little different to how you may have been brought up Draco.”
Before Harry could launch himself at his godfather, the patio doors cracked open. The guests fell silent and Luna happily started up on the cello again.
“Oh bugger,” Harry said, having evidently had the same thought, “should I have just gotten on top? Shit, sorry Draco.”
“I d-don’t think it’s too bad,” Draco told them. He quickly glanced to Hermione who shot him a calm smile, settling his nerves that these women were okay. Draco pushed down the bed sheets and tried not to blush, apart from the other omegas in his dorm no one had really seen him in such a state of undress.
“Quite frankly, I don’t give a rat’s arse what people think,” Harry snapped. “It’s my own bloody business.”
Harry had noticed three dark freckles in a line beneath Draco’s right ear, he had stared at them for quite some time whilst Madam Pomfrey began fussing over prenatal supplements.
“Face it Draco,” Bellatrix sighed, rearranging her face into a seemingly more sympathetic expression. “You will never get that boy’s bite. However
Despite having been hit in the middle of his torso by the spell, the baby appeared to be unharmed. Madam Pomfrey had told Harry that Draco had redirected his own magical core so as to shield the foetus, a natural defence mechanism for pregnant omegas. This is turn meant that Draco was going to be pretty weak and shaky for a few days and Harry was going to need to siphon him more energy than usual.
“Well if they’re anything like you as an infant I would imagine the moniker ‘squashed mango’ wouldn’t go amiss,” Severus stated drily as Draco’s mouth fell open in indignation.
“Thank you,” Draco called out after her as Felicity shot him a thumbs up and disappeared round the corner.
Since then, every morning Harry stared up at the ceiling wondering why he was choosing to inflict such a special brand of torture upon himself. After the snow globe incident, Harry had tried to maintain at least some semblance of space. So although they were in the same bed, Harry carefully kept to his side.
“You don’t know me,” Draco replied, his nose wrinkling up. “Aunt Bella says I’m difficult and s-stroppy.”
“Oh I have an internship in product design for Caulderwells,” Katie announced proudly. Harry recognised the company name; they were one of the leading manufacturers of cauldrons and potions equipment.
“Those are all the things I’ve c-craved since being pregnant,” Draco said in astonishment, catching Harry blushing as he busied himself with the knife.
“He’s the pointy little ferret faced one,” Dean smiled like a Cheshire Cat, “looks like he thinks he’s better than everyone.”
The truth was though, having been raised by Sirius, Harry just didn’t see the point in doing anything that wasn’t fun. Staying at Hogwarts had meant more nights like this with his friends, more quidditch and pissing about in Hogsmeade. Even joining the aurors was going to be exciting. Harry knew his magic was powerful and he always itched for opportunities to use it, feel the thrill racing through his veins.
“I’m Nadia by the way,” she nodded, “if you fancy anything else, just send a patronus down to the guard’s carriage and I’ll come back.”
Harry quickly fetched the low, cushioned chair, setting it facing Draco and sitting down so Harry’s head was level with the omega’s.
“You’d be bloody lucky to be marked by someone like me,” Smith growled, his pupils growing larger as he stared down at Draco. “Your last name is worth shit and you’re already tainted.”
“I’ll let you get washed up and changed then,” Harry said, smiling at Draco before leaving the room. Taking a moment to lean against the door from the outside and gather himself back together.
“You alright sweetheart?” Harry asked as Draco’s eyes cracked open. For a moment, Harry was worried Draco would be embarrassed at having come so quickly, not that Harry minded, he thought it was bloody fantastic how well the omega’s body responded just for him. However, as a lazy, sated smile spread across Draco’s face, Harry realised that Draco probably had no idea what was normal in terms of sex, this being his first real experience with such affairs. Harry was grateful for that, not because he cared about purity or any of that rot, but rather that he could be the one to show Draco that
He convinced himself that it would be okay. Once the baby came, Draco wouldn’t have any time to think about such things, devoting all of his energy to his child that he already loved with his whole heart. He was pretty sure by now that Harry wasn’t going to take custody away from Draco or something equally horrible.
“No,” Harry, scraped his hand down his face, dislodging his glasses. “It’s not – I didn’t mean it like that.”
“No, I guess you’re right, I didn’t, thank god for being a boring square eh?” Harry took off his glasses and wiped at his eyes. Some of the candles in the suite had started to die down, flickering orange shadows across the stone walls.
“You going to have a proper wedding?” Ron questioned, “Mum’ll always let you use the Burrow if you like.”
“It’s um, there’s lacy bits,” Harry cleared his throat and attempted to stick his hands in his pockets before realising his pyjamas didn’t have any. “It really suits you Draco.”
“Oh come on,” Smith drawled, darting his hand out to tug Draco back. He crowded Draco against a nearby wall of pine, leaning over him. Smith’s scent was wood polish and grapes and Draco’s omega did not like it one bit.
“Sorry, were you worried?” Harry asked, reaching up to rub the patch with his thumb. Draco went a little cross-eyed trying to look down at the movement.
“Cranberry!” he shouted happily to his waiting friends who had their own icicle drinks of blue and green.
Draco peered through the window where charmed mannequins were modelling fluffy lace dresses and smart looking suits.
Harry awoke the next morning feeling at absolute peace. He glanced down to find Draco pushed up against his side with one leg hooking over Harry’s thigh. The other boy looked so tranquil and sweet, his blond hair in disarray and his lips slightly parted. Harry permitted himself a few more minutes of revelling in the sensations of having a content omega in his arms before he heard a low rumbling noise.
“You will need to sign here in order to give your permission for the Healer from St. Mungo’s to terminate the pregnancy,” she informed him.
“Omegas shouldn’t be desperate,” Damien smiled beatifically. “And an alpha like you deserves the right one.”
“Hey,” Harry said as he drew up to the omega, who was sat down with his knees hugged up to his chest. “That wasn’t what it looked like okay?”
Draco huffed as he tried to button up his school robes over his ever expanding stomach. There was a frost on the grass outside, like a layer of crystallized sugar icing. It was early December and already a festive, red breasted robin had taken up residence on Draco’s window box.
“Right,” Harry sighed, levering out of bed and shuffling over to Dean’s trunk, rooting around before pulling out the sapphire blue vial.
“How about I keep Fred and George away from Draco for an hour?” Ron offered as Hermione raised her eyebrows, clearly disbelieving that this feat could be accomplished. Draco had heard about Ron’s unruly twin brothers, they ran a joke shop on Diagon Alley and were worryingly
“Harry,” Hermione began, “you’re a good alpha and a wonderful man doing the best you can in a very unusual set of circumstances. Now you know how much I’ve come to care for Draco and I do think that he will need probably more support and affection throughout the later stages of his pregnancy.
Harry refocused his effort, forming a circle around the breast with his fingers and lightly tugging and pressing.
“Madam Pomfrey would like you to go for a check up today,” Harry said, “some routine scans, nothing to worry about. Reckon you could manage some breakfast first?”
I used she/her pronouns for Lyra because that’s what Harry and Draco decided to use until Lyra is old enough to let them know which ones are preferred. ‘Lyra’ is a constellation name and also the letters come from a mix of Lily and Narcissa.
Draco closed his eyes, he tried to picture himself in a bright sunny room, the sound of the ocean outside. He imagined being sat on a comfortable chair with a warm weight in his arms, grounding him.
Harry gasped as Draco let out a loud moan and a jet of sticky white milk spurted from his left breast, splattering across Harry’s face.
“So!” Harry said loudly as Snape snapped his mouth shut on whatever blistering retort he’d had ready. “You said there was good news?”
Harry seemed to sag in relief, tucking his wand back into his sleeve before dragging Draco into a tight hug. Draco let out a small squawk as Harry’s hands suddenly clasped the backs of Draco’s thighs and hoisted him up into the air. Draco’s arms instinctively wrapped around Harry’s neck and his legs around the alpha’s torso. Draco’s bump nestled against Harry’s chest but somehow they managed to angle themselves in a way that didn’t compress it too badly but still allowed for closeness.
Draco glanced to Harry, he wasn’t sure how the alpha would feel about it considering Lucius Malfoy had been in the picture. Harry, however, was nodding enthusiastically. “You’re right Katie – I reckon this is the same spot, I wish I could claim to have planned it that way.”
“You alright?” Harry asked, not waiting for an answer before he strolled over and drew Draco into a warm hug. Draco let out a shuddering breath as he felt Harry’s chin rest on the top of his head. “There’s still more presents or we can take a break? We’ve got profiteroles that need eating or I know Remus wanted to go on a walk along the river?”
Harry finally made contact, his hand spreading out across Draco’s right breast, the entire mound fit perfectly in Harry’s palm and Draco’s skin felt like cool china beneath him.
“Bloody hell,” Ron announced loudly, causing a ripple of laughter to go through the assembled guests.
“Don’t be scared,” Harry stroked down Draco’s back and younger boy could sense the alpha pushing out calming pheromones. “You know I’ll be careful and stop if you want me to.”
“Oh yes,” Remus replied, his voice slightly strained, “Harry let me know yesterday so I doubled up on portions.”
“Ooh,” Harry teased, “both eh? You know I’m pretty sure Sirius won’t have a clue which colour goes with what.”
“Ah,” Harry winced and rubbed the back of his neck, “you think it’s a bit much yeah? Like ostentatious? I tried to get one exactly like your mum’s. Fleur Weasley’s uncle works with antiques in Paris so –“
signature?” Harry frowned, for some reason he just really didn’t want to pick up that quill and put his name to this whole affair. “Call up his guardian and get them to do it.”
Harry smiled fondly at where Draco was sat cross legged on the carpet at Padfoot’s. They were in the lounge area and the omega was busy trying to construct his present from the Christmas Tree Maze. It was one of those wooden German decorations that you had to build yourself. The instructions promised Draco that it was going to be a carousel that, when you placed a series of hot tea lights at various intervals, would start to rotate.
“Quidditch pile up,” one boy explained, he was wearing Ravenclaw robes and had a thick trail of mud up one side. “Bernie whacked the bludger and Maisie didn’t see it but Constance did and she called out but by that time Jodie had flown straight into the back of her because the snitch was –“
“We’ll make one,” Harry replied, immediately sure that he would do anything to get to see Draco in this dress again.
After Draco had admitted what he had done, desperately telling them that he hadn’t meant for this to happen, the omega had simply become too distressed for any sensible conversation. Harry had been quickly ushered away by Professor McGonagall whilst Madam Pomfrey had forced a calming draught down the hysterical boy’s throat. The smell of acidic rust had become so strong that Harry thought he might be sick.
Harry chewed the inside of his cheek, he knew that lack of intimacy, whether physical or social, could really affect omegas. Plus, from what he had learned, Draco was also an orphan and the idea of having Snape as your godfather instead of the warmth of Sirius and Remus, Harry shivered at the thought.
Draco was happiest with his nose in a book, cuddled up on the sofa next to Hermione or Katie. He was proudest when telling Harry about a new potion he had concocted with his godfather. He had even made an effort to get to know Ron, despite his initial misapprehensions about the other man.
“How come?” Harry asked. “You might regret it if you wait till the baby comes, didn’t Olive say this was a unique piece? It’ll probably be gone by then.”
Draco saw Sirius and Remus exchange a look as both men loudly announced they fancied another Irish coffee before disappearing over to the kitchen.
The other girl, however, was Narcissa Malfoy. Draco took a sharp breath as he watched his mother smile and put her hands on her hips. Her hair looked a little more yellow than usual here and was evidently wet as if she had been swimming. A moment later, the young Sirius winked at the camera before revealing the large, snapping crab he had in his hands and rushing with it towards the suddenly shrieking pair of girls.
“Well,” another of their year piped up, “everyone knew Venetia’s family were in talks with Harry Potter regarding a potential courtship.”
“Yeah, sorry, should have warned you it does that. I think it’s worse because you’re so small. Do you want a hand sitting back up?”
Draco opened his mouth to reply when he suddenly tensed and let out a distressed noise. Harry only realized why a moment later when there was a heavy creak on the stairs and the smell of an unknown alpha wafted across to them.
“Oh they’re using the diversion charm,” Hermione announced as they drew up to the maze’s entrance and purchased their tickets. “That was used in the Triwizard Tournament as well.”
“Yes,” Harry answered decisively. “How have you been managing during the last month of school though?” For some reason the idea of Draco’s peers seeing his current state made Harry’s hackles rise.
Draco kept walking for about five minutes before admitting he was completely lost and disorientated. He could still hear shouts and laughs from other people in the maze but every time he tried to travel towards them, they seemed to fade away.
“Do you like it?” Harry asked from where he was sat on the thick Persian rug by the tree. Even Sirius and Remus’ Christmas tree was some sort of contemporary art piece that fit in with the industrial aesthetic of their loft. It was composed of bent wires and hanging light bulbs in red and green.
“I-“ Draco began, swallowing nervously, “I think so. I’d like to be a parent and I’m b-being allowed to get my NEWTS which is important to me too.”
“Nah, love the stuff,” Harry grinned. “Only one time I turned down a plate because I knew Romilda Vane had drenched it in Amortentia.”
“Mummy had even got a venue in mind,” Venetia sniffed, and much to Draco’s horror, her large blue eyes welled with tears which she dramatically dabbed away.
“Sorry I’m late,” Remus announced cheerfully, drawing Harry into a quick hug before taking a seat opposite the bench on a stone bollard. Harry stood up to try and offer Remus a more comfortable option but the other man dismissed him with a smile. “So I have good news,”
“N-No please,” Draco hiccoughed. Harry tensed, if Draco didn’t want this family healer then surely Harry could do something about it? The fucked up legal system must have some perks in that Harry could insist Professor McGonagall brought in the St. Mungo’s one instead.
“Likely story,” the woman laughed, “brat probably slicked up for the first alpha that looked at him.”
“Mm,” Harry replied happily, running his calloused fingers up the inside of Draco’s thigh. The silken nightgown had slipped back down and Harry took great delight in slowly pushing it back up. Eventually, Harry’s hand wound its way around Draco’s prick, lightly squeezing and tugging.
Draco slowly opened his eyes again, biting on his lip as he focused on letting the rigidity across his shoulders dissolve. Harry’s touch was so comforting and Draco still felt swollen and hot with arousal. His scent glands were throbbing in his neck, itching to be bitten and claimed and there was a deep ache inside him that wanted nothing more than to be filled.
Draco snorted, shaking his head as Lyra finished feeding and he dabbed gently at her mouth with the corner of the cloth. “Isn’t it the sixth yet?” Draco asked, looking out of a window through which the sunrise was only just starting to creep.
Draco felt sweat prickling on the back of his neck, he knew he was turning red. Whilst blushed cheeks might look awfully pretty on a complexion like Damien’s, Draco had the unfortunate habit of looking like a boiled lobster. He tried to calm himself, Draco had known this would happen eventually. Instinctively he placed a hand over his stomach to remind himself he wasn’t alone. Damien’s eyes snapped downwards, tracking the gesture.
“Oh, well then I’m bloody delighted! Congratulations you two,” Sirius grinned. “Anyone want a cuppa?”
“Why are you speaking as if you’re never going to see him again?” Harry frowned, feeling irritated by Snape’s characteristic cryptic intonation and phrasing.
“Oh!” Harry said in realisation. “You’d like a piece of my clothing right? I read that the alpha’s scent helps during pregnancy.”
is my point,” Olive sighed, looking at Draco and rolling her eyes conspiratorially. Draco felt himself grin back, he much preferred the atmosphere of this nice shop compared to the intimidating busyness of Diagon Alley.
Draco’s mouth dropped open, he couldn’t believe how crude this grown alpha was being. He supposed this was what his aunt Bella had in mind whenever she would drone on at Draco about the importance of being chaperoned everywhere, lest he encounter a drooling mindless alpha predator. Draco had always been sorely tempted to point out that Bellatrix was an alpha herself but he had bitten his tongue instead.
Draco tensed as he realised that Smith was bringing his mouth down towards Draco’s. Draco scrambled backwards, wincing as the Christmas tree branches dug painfully into his back. One of his mittens had fallen off and he felt himself wrapping his fingers around a nearby branch, the wood rough and strangely warm under his grip.
“Right,” Harry nodded, “yeah, okay then.” He stood up and stretched, cracking his spine satisfyingly from side to side.
A little while later, Draco found himself sitting on a deck chair in the shade, watching the other guests set up a game of magical croquet. He could smell Harry all around him, along with the people he felt safest with. Draco closed his eyes for a moment and let himself doze a little, full of cake and love.
“That doesn’t sound like a good idea,” Harry frowned as Draco’s face fell as if he had been scolded. “I just mean, it might not be good for you, something tight like that. Maybe we should try and find an alternative?”
“I know what you’re going to ask dear,” Nadia winked as Harry slid the door quietly closed behind them and checked there was no one else about. “And don’t worry, it’s perfectly normal. I was absolutely insatiable in my second trimester, there were times when my poor husband Harold couldn’t keep up, but they do a pill now –“
“We haven’t used this kitchen at all,” Harry commented regretfully, twisting round to look over at the small work surface.
“Tell you what,” the lady started pulling some items out, “How about if we combine the crystallised ginger cubes with salt and vinegar crisps and a dash of sour sherbet power but leave out the candy wand?”
“Did they?” Harry asked, a hint of amusement in his voice before he sighed again. “Are you sure you’re okay? I can send up a wand flare and the maze attendants will come get us.”
“Stupid cow,” Sirius muttered. “You know five years ago she tried to set me up with her niece? As if I haven’t been shacked up with a sexy werewolf for the last seventeen.”
“Don’t listen to these pillocks,” Sirius told Draco, picking up the set of wooden slats. “We’ll get this fixed in no time, pass me that glass rod would you?”
“I fear you never did quite understand James,” Remus sighed, “Glory was never his goal. He only wanted to protect his family.”
Draco cried out, threading his fingers through Harry’s black hair, pulling hard enough to hurt. It felt amazing but Draco’s body and inner omega was craving more. Now that he knew this was
On the fifth of August, Harry dressed in an inky black suit and crisp white shirt. He managed to tame his hair into something formal and allowed Luna to pin a sprig of white bouvardia flowers to his button hole. The wedding had been set up at the old stone wizarding house that Harry and Sirius had found in their venue search. The house itself was rather bare, having not been lived in for several years, but the gardens were lush and expansive. It had been constructed in a pale grey stone with large light windows and crawling ivy across the sills.
“I’ll have to l-learn your weaknesses first,” Draco beamed, walking past Harry and into the bathroom, where Harry could hear the omega start to brush his teeth.
“It’s fine,” Colum shrugged, “I get it, who the fuck can afford to be a saint nowadays anyway? Although did you say you’re responsible for him? That’s got to be annoying, how many more months until you’re free?”
Harry twiddled his thumbs, listening to the rustling sounds of fabric coming from behind the curtain. Draco had been a little while but Harry didn’t want to pressure him by asking if he needed any help.
Draco groaned as he realised he had completely forgotten they could do that, it’s what he should have done the moment he knew he was lost.
Harry huffed a laugh and felt himself relax. “Thank you, you’re very attractive too Damien. I’m sure there must be a hundred alphas and betas who would kill for a shot with you.”
“How did you find it?” Draco asked as they walked out into the main hallway and looked up the oak staircase to a gallery landing.
Draco raised his eyebrows in surprise that Harry was interested. “I stay in one of the Slytherin omega dorms,” Draco told him.
“Fuck, that’s it sweetheart,” Harry rasped, moving to gently nip at Draco’s left buttock, delighted to find more faint constellations of freckles. “Move for me, show me what you want.”
“It’s okay sweetheart,” Harry breathed out deeply, shutting his eyes and squeezing Draco’s trembling shoulders, “I’m here.”
Draco tried to smother his yawn in his sleeve, he could feel himself drifting off but he didn’t want Harry to find a reason to leave just yet. It was incredibly comforting having the alpha in Draco’s rooms, sat on his sofa in faded pyjamas and bare feet, like he belonged there.
Previously, Harry had enjoyed time spent with multiple partners, having a healthy sexual appetite for a twenty one year old, and whilst he could objectively admit that Damien was a very conventionally attractive omega, Harry felt zero desire toward him. Even as Damien licked his lips in what he probably thought was an alluring move.
After taking a deep breath and steeling himself, Harry quickly unlocked the bathroom door and strode into the bedroom.
“Just a headache, Nev,” Harry replied as Colum Tidewell sat down beside them, laughing and panting from having been dancing for a while. Harry could see Ron’s raised eyebrows as his friend made some unsubtle encouraging gestures. Harry tried not to tense as he felt Colum’s thigh press up against his own. The other man was a beta with a tanned complexion, coppery curled hair and hazel eyes.
Harry pulled a face in response and looked over across the Great Lake, it was late afternoon and the landscape was a little misty.
“Male omegas,” Harry cleared his throat awkwardly, not really wanting to let on about the research he had done. “pregnancy can be rare for some bloodlines and the abortive procedure is quite traumatising for the womb.”
“Sod off!” Ron scoffed as Hermione laughed in the background, still managing to keep reading her own book at the same time. “Like you don’t need yours
“Are you feeling excited?” Katie asked Draco, gently nudging his side. Draco blinked at her, these women were acting as if this was all normal and happy, like an unmated social pariah of an omega wasn’t in their midst.
Harry nodded dumbly as the older witch waved her wand before passing him a wipe for good measure. Draco was still staring at Harry, his eyes huge and wet as if he was going to cry. Harry’s first instinct was to run away, maybe go and drown his shame in the Three Broomsticks. However, as the first watery droplet spilled down Draco’s cheek, Harry made up his mind.
Harry laughed fondly before leaning in to rub their noses together, “Don’t you? You should, it’d be cute.” He repositioned himself on the bed, nuzzling his face against Draco’s belly. “Hello Baby, I can’t wait to meet you.” Harry glanced up to where Draco was peering down at him curiously. “You’re going to be a very lucky baby you know? You’ve got the world’s most beautiful papa and your daddy is going to be a complete pushover when it comes to you both.”
“Bugger,” Harry muttered, irritated at his own curiosity. For some reason he just felt like he wanted to check on the omega again. Draco had been in such a horrendous state yesterday, his entire delicate frame wracked with tremors. Harry decided it must just be the alpha side of him, so uncomfortable at seeing an omega in distress. Harry figured he would feel much better once he had confirmed the boy was fine and then he could get on with life as usual.
Draco could only roll his eyes, he was far from the scheming mastermind they perceived him to be. However, his Slytherin side had to admit, he did feel a little gleeful every time he caught the curious and jealous expressions of people like Damien Tuppence and Venetia Dawson whenever they saw his scar.
Draco nodded shyly, having an alpha in his nest for the first time was something he had only let himself dream of in moments of romantic self indulgence. He sighed happily, running his fingertips against the duvet as he heard the shower start up again.
There were about fifteen guests, including Luna, Neville, Padma, Felicity, Ron, Hermione, Katie, Seamus and more. Draco realised he had stopped moving to gape in shock as Harry hurried towards him, cradling Draco’s face in his large hands.
“Oh no,” Damien swung slightly from side to side as he talked, “I was just feeling a little train-sick so thought I would go on a walk.”
“Right,” Harry muttered miserably. It had grown fully dark now and he could barely see Ron’s frown through the shadows. “I’ve got to go, Draco will be waiting for me to take him to the Hall for dinner.”
“Fuck,” Harry muttered, clearly leaving the room a moment later as the door clicked shut, Hermione following him not a minute later, looking very cross.
Harry watched her go before walking round to take her vacated seat, looking over curiously at Draco.
Draco pursed his lips in a smile, feeling the elation of his inner omega at having pleased his alpha. “Aunt Bella would
“It’s this one,” Draco glared down at his own chest. Whilst his right breast was looking a little smaller already, his left remained a pale, swollen globe, heavy with milk that hadn’t yet released.
that fox is Katie’s when she chooses to make it corporeal.” Harry explained. “Oh gosh, there’s Luna’s hare!”
“I can’t do it!” Draco huffed, jerking Harry’s memories traitorously back to when a similar sentiment was offered in the bathtub the night before.
“Well, how about you try them on for me and I’ll give you my honest opinion?” Hermione suggested as there was another knock on the door.
Harry snorted a laugh and settled back down, remembering that Remus was more than capable of defending himself.
“Surely you haven’t run out of the feverfew already?” Severus asked. Draco shook his head, he still had two vials left of the anti nausea potion his godfather had concocted specially for him. Draco’s morning sickness had started to hit around mid February and sadly ignored its own nomenclature, striking at all hours of the day and night.
A little while later, whilst Sirius and Draco were all smiles, lighting up a selection of candles and watching their creation spin festively, Harry joined Remus over in the kitchen.
“Is that my dad?!” Draco blurted in amazement. Whilst Bellatrix had retained some childhood photos of Narcissa, any pictorial representations of Lucius Malfoy that weren’t damning cuttings from newspapers, were few and far between.
Hermione and Ron had joined them at the wonderland’s entrance, along with a few other people that it turned out had booked tickets for the same day. Draco had been a little nervous to see that Ginny Weasley was also there, but she had simply smiled at them in greeting and commented on how Draco was much bigger than the last time she had seen him.
Draco padded over to the bed, tugging off his slipper socks and looking around him. With the raging storm outside, the bed just didn’t feel quite right that night. Draco could sense himself growing rather irritated with how flat the duvet was, how tightly the sheets were tucked underneath the mattress.
