Harry had never exactly been an expert in romantic gestures. In his defense, he’d never claimed to be, either, but that wasn’t the sort of excuse you could get away with if you were dating Draco Malfoy – even if it was just sorta-kinda-maybe-in-secret-but-we’ve-never-actually-talked-about-it dating.
“So,” Draco said, sounding sleepy and content, “Which one should we saddle our future child with? Lurkrus, Brungog, or Brodnaff?”
“Protection,” Hermione said at the same time he did.
“I’m sorry, what?” Potter murmurs back.
“Oh?” Draco asked, trying to remain unaffected when he was hoping feverishly, invoking Merlin and Salazar and, oh screw it, even Godric that it was what he wanted it to be – a gift, something  that said ‘I hope you liked my flowers, let’s make out and get married.’ He stood up slowly – mostly because he didn’t trust his legs all that much at the moment – and walked around the desk.
“We can’t let on that we’re suspicious,” he starts. “Merlin knows what they’ll do if they think they’ve been found out.”
Harry grins a bit, thinking back to Draco’s disproportionate outrage and dramatic huffing, which was almost sort of…endearing? He shakes his head, because that can’t possibly be right. Nothing about Draco is
“Hey!” Potter sounded annoyed.
“I’m working on that,” said Harry.
“Apparently. It’s not like I’ve ever been to one. I mean, can you imagine Hermione doing something like this?”
“And part of that was having Neville learn the true stasis spell, which is why she’s got such an excellent chance of survival now,” Hermione pointed out.
Harry sighed and cast another warming charm.
“They found two human skeletons down there,” Blaise said gently. “Couldn’t identify them with complete accuracy – they were charred and fused and half-melted – but it stands to reason that those were the only two people who were down there. And even if there is some strange way Potter managed to save himself…I can’t see any reason he would have put his loved ones through that, letting them think he was dead for over two years. No, Draco, he died in that place. He truly did. I don’t know how to explain him being here, but we don’t know enough about death to understand it, perhaps ever.”
“Where would you go, though?” she asked eventually. “You shouldn’t be on your own, not before you’ve had a little more time to recover, and I don’t think we should tell people that you’re back yet. I’d love for you to come stay with Ron and me, but we get too many visitors for that to be a good idea.”
“Oh, shit,” Potter said, barely audible.
“Of course not, I only did that because I thought he’d caught me looking at his arse and I panicked.”
“Harry! Hey!” Draco hisses. When Harry looks, he’s faced with more white crystals in a cauldron. “Does yours look like this?”
Potter nodded, apparently satisfied, and started sprinkling beetle wings into their cauldron. Since he didn't seem to be counting them, Draco paused chopping and did it for him, internally rolling his eyes all the while.
“How long…how long did Blaise say they lasted?”
“What?” he asked helplessly. “I...what?”
“It probably is,” said Philomena. “That just makes me want to know it more.”
Draco’s eyes widen. “That was a
It seemed to take both no time at all and an eternity until they’d reached Granger’s little office, and by the time they did, they’d managed to hammer out a basic message.
“Well, yes, but we’ll need it if it keeps happening. I also need to try and understand this stuff better, because it’s so different from other poisons that figuring out the mechanism may point us to its creator.”
Draco’s mouth twitched. “Granger said that, did she? That’s good to know, I’ll have to give her a hard time about it.”
Blaise was the first person they ran across in the department proper, and Draco couldn’t help but clutch his food more tightly. He didn’t know why Blaise was mad at him, so there was no sense in risking himself or his food before he found out. He’d seen his friend take cold, calculated revenge on other Slytherins, and Blaise knew to hit where it hurt.
“I…yes, of course, everything’s going exactly to plan,” Harry lied, bald-faced, and tried to tug his arm out more gently. It remained stuck.
Molly says it’s the best vanilla cake she’s ever eaten. It’s creative and neat and perfectly executed, and if Harry had to guess, he’d say Padma made the cake – or Luna, possibly – but he isn’t sure.
“So, as I started saying before, I’ll need to monitor you for a few days at least as you take your potions, but everything looks like it’s recovering as it should. You heal pretty fast for a dead bloke.”
“It’s a Wheezes product?”
“What? What do you need?”
Harry exclaimed abruptly, “Egbert, really!” and Draco was stuck with a needle for the third time in less than two minutes as Babs whirled around.
“How did you know I was here?” Draco asked suspiciously.
“You may want to cover your children’s ears, dear audience,” says Ron.
“I’m not so sure anymore.” Theo, the stupid chess-traitor. “I mean, obviously we all thought so, that’s why we left them out of it in the first place, isn’t it?”
“Damn you Potter, I thought we were never going to mention that disaster ever again.”
“So.” Draco cleared his throat. “You were with your mother when she died?”
"Welcome!" Harry called out.
“We’ve got lungs,” Draco said softly.
“Why? The…oh, do you mean because of Penelope? I didn’t mean it like that, Harry, I promise.”
She looked honestly thrilled about ‘Muggle Methods for Magical Maternity’, which was a relief. “A friend of mine at St Mungo’s wrote it,” he explained. “It’s an advance copy, actually – she was kind enough to owl it.”
“You thought ‘Oh, I should try this one out, what could possibly go wrong?’” Severus interrupted him. “Honestly, Potter, using a spell if you don’t know what it does is beyond idiotic, even for you. I wouldn’t have thought you were quite this ignorant.”
"You still haven't explained," Draco pointed out. He was starting to feel a bit cranky.
“I’m sure we’re all very sad for your missed opportunity,” said Blaise as he wrapped his stasis field around Smith’s with a complicated, jerky wand motion. He turned towards the stool as though waiting for it to be vacated, which didn’t happen. Smith only crossed his arms and glared.
“That you’re secretly in love with him and that you’re hurt and upset,” Sky helped him along.
Granger obviously agrees with him, because she is reacting to Pansy’s cheerful offer of “Bakewell tart, Hermione?” with an open mouth and a wide-eyed stare. Pansy, undeterred, holds the tray out to her in a way that’s really quite invasive. Granger’s trapped between it and the back of her chair, and if Pansy doesn’t stop inching closer, Draco thinks that Granger might just tip her chair over in a desperate attempt at escape.
When Granger did it instead, Draco learned that it was now almost one in the morning. Once the shock and excitement wore off, he’d be ready to keel over.
Harry sighed. “Yeah, same,” he said bitterly.
Then there was silence, and Potter made a face of displeasure but he
Harold the Welcome Wizard gave him a cheerful wave. Draco responded with a tired smile as he walked past, but even that faded when he realized that he’d once again forgotten his recent resolution to avoid the reception area.
There were things they would have to talk about eventually if they kept being in each other’s proximity. It would have to wait, though, until they weren’t dealing with anything quite so urgent.
sort of look, but she is too absorbed in her conversation to even notice him.
“Don’t be silly, Harry,” she said, then gasped. “Oh, what an astonishing amount of gnomeholes Draco has in his garden! I wish he’d told me, I could have brought a bronze necklace with me to imbue with gnome magic.”
Panic finally overwhelmed him. Shaking and shedding unbridled tears, he dropped against the wall.  He had his arms wrapped around his knees, which he’d drawn close, and was hiding his face in them as he started to rock back and forth in a slow, steady rhythm.
The way Hermione perked up told Draco she had expected the question – probably much sooner than it had been asked, actually.
Granger asked, alarmed.
Draco approved of the pettiness. Smith huffed and tried to pretend that wasn’t what he’d meant, but just then, Blaise came hurrying into the room.
and a lot of smoke later, Hermione declared that all the chocolate frogs belonged to her and her alone, and Draco placed a fez on top of the two hats he was already wearing.
someone?”
“I don’t know,” she said. “Since I don’t know why this happened in the first place. I’ve got a working theory, but…it’s extremely shaky. It’s ludicrous, actually, but so’s this entire situation. We’ll have to wait until he can talk to us.”
“Obviously, Granger is only concerned for the integrity of the department and not at all bitter,” said Blaise.
“Schrödinger’s Harry,” Hermione burst out.
Prompt #11 – The Marauder’s Map
“Malfoy, your painting,” Potter started, with a very strange look on his face, and it was fine, completely fine, Draco had, after all, anticipated sort of situation.
“But then why would I have written that on my hand unless I knew I’d be in a time loop?”
“Thank you, Blaise,” said Draco. “If you had let me finish, you would have realized that I
“Poor kid.”
“Potter!” Draco called out, photograph firmly in hand as he wheeled around and hurried back into the corridor, damn near sprinted by the time he was crossing the department’s entrance chamber. “Potter!”
The noise Harry produced in his throat made it obvious that this had slipped his mind. “Fuck.”
is still a wonderful human being and beta reader.
“Weird,” he complained.
“Marielle,” Granger corrected. “Yes. She agreed to interrupt her maternity leave to help maintain Harry’s stasis.”
“Malfoy,” she said neutrally.
“And here I am knitting you a jumper,” said Philomena and looked down at the woolly mint-green project she held in her hands.
“Good,” Potter said, and grinned. “You know, in the interest of full disclosure.”
“Ah,” he said. “I…thanks?”
“Hello Susan,” said Hermione, and she seemed to have noticed as well that something appeared to be amiss. “How…how are you feeling?”
“Fuck,” Draco curses, and Madam Pomfrey rushes over at once to heal the large cut across his palm and siphon up any and all blood before it can contaminate the food. “Don’t fucking distract me when I’m chopping things, Potter.”
Weasley and Granger exchanged glances, and then, to Draco’s surprise, they looked at him as well.
“There’s a shock,” Weasley muttered.
“If you make any house-elves cry, Hermione will have your head, you know.”
“It won’t do much, Poppy. He’s going to keep a scar,” Severus said.
“I... no! Why would you say that?”
“I love you,” burst out of him, right when Harry said it as well, and it was perfect, so perfect, that for a moment he forgot all about chasing his orgasm. Their eyes met through the mirror, and Harry’s smile was warm and utterly happy, and at that very moment Draco felt the last bit of resistance shattering inside him. Because if he could put that smile on Harry’s face, then maybe he was worth something after all.
“Granger, I haven’t the slightest bloody clue.” Draco waved his wand again and ended the spell, feeling oddly shaken by this comparatively minor development.
Granger said yet again, and Draco realized that Weasley had opened the card.
you mean to do?” he asked with a seething undertone.
“I’m not sure if they’re related, but it would make a lot of sense if that’s the case. Harry, this is Stanislaus Selpie. I remember him because I attended one of his lectures on antidotes once, a long time ago.”
“All sorts of reasons.”
Draco thought about the kiss a lot over the following days, and each time the sinking feeling in his gut got stronger. Nice as it had been, Harry clearly hadn’t been thinking when he’d crossed the room to comfort Draco. They hadn’t been in their bathroom, not in their safe little world where it didn’t matter what anyone else thought. Draco was afraid that if anyone found out about them, it was only a matter of time until everything he held in his hands right now would crumble apart. Harry wouldn’t want to alienate his friends, and why would he? Certainly not for someone like Draco, following in his wake and begging for scraps. The sooner someone reminded Harry of what he was worth, the sooner he would leave Draco to his own devices.
in the room finish speaking?”
“True,” Draco said mildly, and Smith looked surprised for a moment. “Unless you actually know what you’re talking about, of course.”
“Bless you,” everyone in the bus, save Harry, chorused. The goblin child was especially enthusiastic about it. Evadne, meanwhile, pawed at the back of Harry’s armchair.
“Then at least tell me why.”
She sighed and massaged her temples. “Can we close him back up and discuss this elsewhere? The smell is getting to me.”
Draco sighed.
“It’s a warning to back off, obviously.”
“Is any of it more information about what might have happened to cause him being poisoned?” Draco asked, not unreasonably, in his opinion.
“Go home, Malfoy,” Lewis said again, and Draco did.
“Always.”
“No? I’m really sorry, I can-”
His trained eye couldn’t see any of the visual clues most poisons left on a patient’s body, and apparently Potter hadn’t been awake to say anything, so he was extremely curious about the answer.
related to him, I think there’s a good chance she got her hands on them. It’s obviously just a theory, but now that we know what we’re looking for, it shouldn’t be too difficult to establish whether –”
Harry wasn’t sure what to think about anyone wanting to know about his fight with Draco for the entertainment value. “It was about…he’s going on a date later tonight.”
“My fiancée isn’t here,” said Lyman Selwyn from behind the gate, and looked at them with so much distaste that it made Draco feel as though he hadn’t showered in a week. But it didn’t surprise him, not really. Most of the more traditional pureblood families were horrified by what he’d become – a Malfoy, once so highly regarded, was now
Draco couldn’t claim to understand, but then, he didn’t have a significant other he could decide to keep secrets from. He cleared his throat. “I was coming to take more blood, actually,” he said.
The door to her room opened wider, and a man stepped out. He was wearing nothing but a red and white Santa hat and a pair of ridiculously tight red briefs that featured the words “HO HO HO” across the front. Despite the green font that seared Draco’s retinas, the words did not manage to distract from the sharp outline of the man’s cock.
“Oh, no, no, I’m her roommate. My name’s Eden. I haven’t seen June yet today, she’s probably still in bed. Is it important?”
“Well, I mean, I wish he hadn’t done it, of course,” Granger said with a sigh, “but this whole mess wouldn’t have happened if only I’d told Ron right away. I can only blame myself.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” he asked stupidly as soon as he glimpsed a corner of canvas. Potter had made this? Potter had painted him something?
Draco cursed Potter's saviour complex at the same time he realized that it meant Potter wasn't going to let this go.
“We’re with the Auror Department,” Harry said. “Do you happen to know who was the one helping Sylvana Brown when she was here to get fitted for new robes the day before yesterday?”
“Thanks.”
“You look like it is,” Draco pointed out.
“Oh.” Granger’s eyes widened. “Are things not going well?”
“Pretty much.”
Being pressed against the Saviour from shoulder to thigh, arms around each other as they try to melt into a wall to avoid being discovered by a passing group of first-years, means feeling each other’s heartbeats, panting into each other’s ear, sharing body warmth and inhaling each other’s scent. Surprisingly, Potter smells rather good, Draco has to admit, and so he really doesn’t mind when it happens several more times, even though they’ve lost track of Pansy somewhere along the way. Potter doesn’t seem to mind either, which can only mean that Draco smells like roses and has good taste in French aftershave, obviously.
“You what?” Draco snarled, actually dropping his knife. It fell to the floor with a bright sound. Luckily the room was so full of noises and voices that the slip went unnoticed.
“That’s too bad. If you had, you probably would have come up with a brilliant idea to get free by now – their saliva can do wondrous things, you see.” The last words she addressed to Pansy, who nodded and put on a serious ‘I am listening very intently and extremely interested in whatever you’re telling me’ sort of expression.
“Archibald Grouse,” she said. “But I’ve already filed a complaint. They said he did nothing wrong.”
“So?” he asked.
“Do it again!” he demanded without thought.
“They’re onto us,” Potter says unnecessarily.
“But there is so much –” Hermione started.
To Draco’s surprise, Weasley was actually home when they flooed over to the Granger-Weasley residence for dinner that evening. Things still didn’t seem quite right between him and Granger, but his presence had to be a good sign, at least.
“Dunno,” Potter responded.
“The question is, why is he so worried about what I think?” Harry asked her. “It really seemed to bother him, Hermione!”
“No, I mean yes, this was when, I’m just, um, running a little behind, you know how these things go…” Too late, he realised he’d grabbed two handfuls of his previously wrinkle-free robes and was clutching them in his desperation.
Draco looked after him, utterly despondent.
“What’s the story with these, anyway?” Harry asked into the ensuing silence. He was holding a ‘W’-shaped candy cane and regarding it from every angle.
“Oh, yeah.” Potter had moved closer again without Draco noticing. “That’s the headmistress’ office. She’s probably sitting at her desk.”
“What sort of ‘something’?” Draco asked suspiciously.
Draco leaned back and took a gulp of Firewhisky with tea. “Potter, why the fuck do these things always happen to you?”
“Well, you should call me Harry. I live with you, it’s a bit weird we’re still using last names, isn’t it?”
“Of course.”
“What?”
“I’m just frustrated. Before I get into that though, and before I forget, Potter says thanks for sending Bones to him.”
“Twenty-six years and four and a half months old,” Hermione announced at the same moment Harry said, “I’m twenty-six.”
He’d forgotten it was the first day of December, but it came back to him easily now that he saw Muggle London already beginning to sparkle with seasonal decorations. Draco allowed the cheer of it to soothe his dark mood just the tiniest bit, soaked in the atmosphere of the lush green wreath on a door, the chain of light wrapped around a lamppost, the candles glittering in the windows, the smiling snowman in a telephone box –
(See the end of the chapter for
“You deserve to be protected.”
“Oh.”
“I'm not really planning to stop.”
“What is your obsession with me eating chocolate?” Draco asked. Then he stopped dead. “Wait…did
“Why don’t you guess,” he said therefore. “Was it…A, an ex, or B, a one night stand, or C, my mother?”
demanded that I ask you this:
“What? No, you muppet, of course not,” Draco scoffs, and Potter looks utterly relieved. Tension seems to leave him in spades.
Harry noticed his new mood eventually. He wasn’t the most observant person, never had been, but Draco had nothing to hide behind when it was just the two of them. Every slight hesitation on his part became suddenly glaring, and before long, Harry was holding Draco’s head in his hands, stroking his temples and asking, “What’s wrong? You’re… not yourself.”
At those words, Potter’s head dropped in shame.
“Huh?”
it stated bluntly, followed by what looked like tally marks. Draco ran a finger across them. Seventeen.
“Draco, you’re friends with
The fire flared up green. A moment later, Weasley stepped out of it. “He’s coming,” he announced as he moved aside.
“Second of all, what the hell are you on about? How did you screw up our anniversary? It’s not even until next week! I was avoiding talking to you because I was too afraid I might accidentally give away that I was planning an anniversary surprise for the two of us.”
Potter made a face. “I never thought I’d see the day when you’re defending Hermione.”
“Granger, it’s on Harry’s
Parvati broke off and stood abruptly, hands fisted. “If you’re about to make excuses, you can save it, Hermione.”
“No,” Kingsley Shacklebolt said, kneeling in front of him. He studied Harry for a long moment and then slowly said, “Explain.”
“I suppose you’d need to be extensively educated to truly appreciate the sort of quality and depth this piece has. How it exudes the artist’s calm confidence, the way he has expressed the joy and playfulness of the kitten-”
“Please,” he groaned, and didn't know what he was asking for, only that the gut-wrenching need was killing him. “Please.”
“Oh,” Granger breathed. “I never even thought of that being a possibility.”
“I gave you permission to do this with the provision that you needed to be
Lewis winced. “How young?”
“What the
After another cake that has somewhat sad-looking daisies blooming and closing again, it’s Harry’s turn.
“Oh, this is going to be my take on a Bramble cocktail, you see” Ernie says. From the corner of his eye, Harry can see him waving his arms around in illustration. “I’m doing a lemon sponge, and the filling will be blackberry with a healthy dose of gin.”
“Women you’ve dated?”
But this isn’t the time. They can talk about this later, when Harry isn’t busy letting his instincts guide him and leaning forward to press his dry lips to Draco’s. It feels like giving in to inevitability. He wouldn’t have it any other way.
“This is for you.” He thrust the wrapped package toward Draco.
“I’m going to go help Victoria, but I highly recommend that the lot of you keep a safe distance. If you don’t, I will not be held responsible for my actions.”
Something happened – something moved, some kind of tight, sharp knot in his chest he’d not been fully aware of until now. The words played through his mind, over and over.
“You’re calling Parvati by her first name, and Harry as well now, don’t think I didn’t hear you earlier. Can you please just call me Hermione?”
“My hair. Pull it again.”
“She’s our most likely suspect then, yeah?” Draco frowned. “Still seems too simple though, blaming the foreign one.”
“Thank you.”
the point?”
“Sure,” she said, and Draco Flooed over.
“There is virtually no proof that these are his doing.”
The showy, illuminated display case in the center of the room had formerly held the Beater’s Bat that had famously decided the two-thousand and five Quidditch World Cup in England’s favor. It had been pleasant to look at, a reminder of the ecstatic nation-wide celebration that had taken place following the event. Draco had fond memories of getting copiously drunk off whatever cheap alcohol they’d served at the muggle bar where he’d been dragged by his co-workers, and then being enthusiastically taught the joys of karaoke.
Harry had simply meant to take a walk to clear his head. The fresh air, the steady, repetitive movement of his steps, and the slowly changing surroundings usually gave him the space he needed to think things through rationally – channel his inner Hermione, as it were. But after he slammed the door, ready to go stalking off into the night, he stepped right into a torrential downpour, and the sound of thunder growled overhead as the wind tore at his hair.
Prompt #5 – A decorated tree covered in snow
“You tap it thrice with your wand, push the button, then set it down and point it where you want the barrier to be and tap it once more. You’d best be really bloody certain of the placement though, because it can’t be taken down for sixty-five minutes after it’s put up. Anton and I tried to adjust that time, but it destabilizes the cubes, and we haven’t got a fix for it yet.”
“There’s no catch,” Blaise assures her. “I’m just being polite, Ginevra,” and
her? She never managed to decode the other message you wrote on your arm for her even though she tried every word she could think of.”
"Oh," Hermione breathed. "They could both work at the same time, yes, of
of them?”
, and so Harry had been forced to figure it out through a combination of clever detective work and process of elimination.
should make him laugh. Have you given him backrubs, picked up the slack instead of this Leroy? Maybe made breakfast?”
“All sorts of people eat street food, Malfoy.” Potter came over to him and pulled him to his feet, then turned to blow out the candles. “Come on. It’s delicious. I’ll buy.”
Thank you for being so kind and understanding about why this story was on hiatus for so long. It's a big relief not to have upset people as much as I feared.
“Well, that was a catastrophe,” Draco says as they walk out of the tent together. Far in front of them, they can see Hermione lecturing Ron, presumably about his lack of commentator neutrality when it comes to Draco. She’d already whacked him over the head with a whisk – a dirty one – back in the tent. Ron now has bits of ganache in his hair.
“Quidditch, Harry?” asked Thomas, and only then seemed to notice who Potter was sitting next to. “What are you doing with the Death Eater?”
“Indeed I did. Although now that I think about it, his name may have been Alfred – I can’t quite remember.”
“Draco, you can’t possibly think that my eyes aren’t about to glaze over,” Blaise interrupted him as they walked to the staff Floos. “I hate potions theory with the fiery passion of a thousand suns, you’re well aware of that.”
“Yes,” Draco responded absently. “What if we spell the lights shatterproof, just while we get it sorted out?”
Potter followed him into the kitchen when Draco started on the tea. “You’re late,” he said.
They’re in one such position when a breakthrough in their investigation finally happens, embracing in a corner out of sheer necessity, even though the third-year Ravenclaws have come and gone, and even though hiding from them isn’t actually strictly necessary. Better safe than sorry, Draco thinks, pressing his nose to the side of Potter’s neck and sighing contently.
“Me too,” Harry murmured and pulled him close. It felt fantastic to have Draco’s head tucked so perfectly beneath his chin, to tangle their legs lazily, sated.
“What usually happens when you cast this?” Hermione leaned forward, regarding him intently.
And he ran.
“So,” Draco says, rolling out the parchment and giving it a gentle prod with his wand to reveal the chart he has made. “This is the path the infection has taken, insofar as I could reconstruct it. I’ve been observing Daphne, but I still haven’t found evidence either way as to whether she has caught the insanity as well. She’s always been a bit shallow and ditzy, so sharing make-up tips with Patil doesn’t strike me as out of character.” He traces a question mark next to her name with his wand, and it glows into existence, Robin’s Egg blue. “I may need your help though. It is possible she’s suspecting me of being onto her and therefore more careful around me.”
“No,” said Clara. “Only to the door, and sometimes to the desk, quick-like, to give her files. She was very professional, and so was I, we didn’t just stand and chat all the time.”
Something began to dawn on Harry. “Yes?” he said and ducked his head.
Selwyn,” he said peevishly. “But I’m not surprised you forgot, it has been a while since the Malfoy family had this sort of standing, after all. And you’ll never inherit your title, will you? What a shame.”
“And I suppose you can’t tell me what it was?” Blaise rolled his eyes as both Draco and Potter shook their heads. “Fine, you drama queens, I’ll forgive it this once. Oh, stop doing that, Draco, I’m not going to steal your bloody falafel!”
“How do you figure that?”
Pansy took a breath and then exhaled along with the words, “You are such a dolt.”
“I meant to ask,” he said as his fingertips brushed the blurry black letters. “Have you checked if the things written on his arm are actually…well, true? I mean, obviously he’s poisoned alright, but are there other facts written down that could be checked?”
With a wave of her wand, the matron cleaned the blood off the sheets and replied, “I’ll be glad if he wakes up at all, Severus. I’m not terribly worried about the scar.”
“It’s a heart, Draco. Red is a bit of a traditional colour.”
“Ron’s is easy – ‘Little Drummer Boy’, ‘Let It Snow’, ‘Little Lamb of God’…”
“Did she consume any food before or during the meeting? Or at any point after she’d come to work?”
“Phaedra,” said Draco.
“Huh?” Theo asks blankly.
"Why?" Draco asked, and then immediately answered his own question. "Because he doesn't know the encoding spell."
“A beach cake,” says Kingsley. “This is reminding me I need a holiday – but don’t we all?”
“I wish I could make it forever,” Harry says helplessly.
“Well, yes. I had to get started on the antidote.” Draco was a bit concerned that Potter wasn’t showing more of a reaction to the news that the same poison had shown up elsewhere. It didn’t seem right.
“I can’t,” he whispers.
“Alright,” Draco said. “Tea?”
“Whose heroic deeds during the war should at least shift her up a few ranks, honestly,” Ron complains.
“You don’t think so?” Harry asked plaintively.
Harry gave him a smile. “I won’t, then. And you know what the really nice thing is?”
He know his cloak wouldn’t make it through this ordeal as soon as Babs tutted and tugged on his hood so hard she nearly choked him. “So much extra fabric,” she said.
Harry winced. “’Potter’ now, is it?”
It was disturbingly easy, visiting the department again and pretending to leave, then sending an empty lift up to the Atrium while they huddled beneath the invisibility cloak together and waited. It took a while until Smith and Clearwater called it a night, snapping at each other about some screw-up with their paperwork as they passed, and the entire time, Draco and Harry stood there with their arms around each other, trying not to move at all, hardly even daring to breathe.
“But look, ‘Mione,” Weasley held up the card. On the front of it were three hand-drawn Christmas ornaments, purple and red and yellow, and beneath that the words I LIKE YOUR BALLS.
, this was getting so out of hand.
“Well, Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle have always been a bit…over-eager,” Severus responded sardonically. “Still, don’t think for one moment that you can wriggle your way out of punishment. Your reckless behavior almost killed a student today.”
"That doesn’t mean he was the one who invited you, you twat."
“Sorry, yes, I was thinking. Do you mean to the village or to Hogwarts itself?”
“No,” Harry said honestly before he realised that it was absolutely
Their breakthrough comes from the unlikely source of one Gregory Goyle, who mentions to Draco that Pansy’s had him make a lot of trips down to the kitchens for food lately. Draco runs to find Potter, presses against him in an alcove – he’s just used to them being physically close at this point, it’s basically a survival instinct, okay? – and breathes into his ear, “It’s the house-elves.”
“Mhm,” Draco said and kept digging his thumbs in.
It was strange, he thought, that he’d managed to fall into a pleasant camaraderie with Granger almost immediately, yet Potter still seemed able to make him feel insecure and awkward simply by being in the same room.
“Yes,” said Potter, steadily. “I'm worried.”
There was a choking noise. Draco blinked and realized that Clearwater, instead of gloating or going on pretending her actions had been justified, had staggered back and was now pressing her hand against her chest as a shiver ran through her.
“Oh,” Draco said, “
Draco took a deep breath to keep from panicking, then another. “I assume so,” he managed to reply after that.
“How lucky there’s a pregnant witch going out of her mind because she can’t make herself useful,” Hermione said pointedly.
"Well then you should be able to answer your own question. Ah." Blaise  had opened a cupboard and was now taking a number of glasses out of it. "I am going to mix drinks."
He just had it…just
Draco made a sound of longing.
“Potter!”
“Of course not!” she hissed. “I didn’t…I never…”
“I am
He went through the rest of the day in a haze, the words he had read coursing through his head.
. Harry took his hand. “Tell me all of it.”
“What I’ve basically done is created something that acts as a sort of cage. It binds the poison, just like a normal antidote might, but the poison can’t use it to change itself because the cage is a crystalline structure, which is a more rigid arrangement of molecules. It can’t be torn apart as easily and used to create something else.”
“I…I’m not sure. June would know better, she’s the one who checked on her, who cast some healing spells.”
Harry stopped his pacing and turned so he could level a proper glare at his best friend. “I feel like you’re not treating this situation with the level of alarm and urgency that it requires.”
and then said, “If you think that after waiting for you
“And he thinks it’s a kitten!
“Isn’t that what you wizards do?” asked Graglor. “Monogamous shackles?”
At sixteen minutes, Potter’s body ceased shaking.
When there was finally no more blood trickling out, she took a fresh cloth and soaked it in dittany, draping it across the entire area around the wound before starting on bandaging Draco’s torso.
And he enjoyed the fact exactly until Harry Potter walked into his office, looking dishevelled and out of breath and with his cheeks tinted a fetching pink colour.
“Schrödinger’s…it has to do with a cat, and physics, and…never mind. What I mean is, Ron is right, the spell must think there’s two of you, in a way. It can’t decide which age actually belongs to you – the one before time started looping, or the one that includes all of the loops you’ve gone through. They can’t both be true, but for some reason, the spell thinks they are.”
Thinking about the wet spot in Potter's pyjamas that had matched his own the night before, Draco smirked. “Clearly.”
“Have you given him a blood replenisher?”
Harry tilted his head, as if to concede the point. Then he sighed and climbed to his feet and put his hand on Draco's shoulder.
“I think so.” There was movement, and Potter dropped to the tiles, sitting comfortably. “Does it matter?”
yet.” Granger looked guilty, her face crumpling when Potter scowled at her. “I’ll tell him tonight, I promise, Harry, there just hasn’t been a good moment.”
Draco barked a laugh. “Who else to do it with than the one who's already witnessed me beg for it?”
“Not really,” said Luna.
“I think he’s afraid you’ll steal his falafel,” Potter said with a grin. Somebody, thought Draco, should tell him that gloating was not an attractive quality. Although, if he was honest, it didn’t do much to diminish Potter’s appeal, and –
“Yes, of course, she was insulting June.”
Draco searched his face and tried to make sure he wasn’t being messed with. “Harry,” he said slowly, “we can’t just waltz in there and say ‘Pardon us, terribly sorry, just going to stick our noses into everything for a moment here’.”
Potter looked even more contrite and ducked his head. “I didn’t mean it that way. Sorry.”
“I didn’t exactly deserve a warm welcome, after everything.” Draco swallowed hard. It still hurt to think about that, about the fact that he had done terrible things to a place he loved.
“Yes,” Draco said faintly. “Yes, that.”
“I got that impression as well,” Potter confirmed. “It felt as though she could see straight through my glamour. She said, ‘It’s good to see you’ and looked me in the eyes and it took me a moment to realize that she should be speaking to someone she’s never met in her life. It didn’t feel that way.”
“Okay, okay.” Potter sounded panicked. “If I do this, will you stop trying to hurt yourself?”
“Because I’m barely ever here, Potter, and I’m not big on Christmas anyway.”
“Sorry,” Draco said. “For a millisecond there, I forgot.”
“I’ve just…” To his horror, Draco’s eyes were starting to burn. He hurried faster towards the Floos. “I’ve worked so fucking hard to make up for it, for all of it, and it’s just not enough, never enough, and
good.”
“D’you want me to find my own place soon?”
Feeling resigned, Draco stepped onto the stool and promptly felt transported years into the past.
He was waiting for it to steep when the insistent knock on the door sounded. With an annoyed growl, he rose from his armchair, prepared to eviscerate whichever poor soul was rudely disturbing his hard-won peace. The words stuck in his throat, however, when he ripped open the door only to be faced with a familiar head of bushy hair.
“Are you sure about that?” asked Pansy, her tone implying that she was certain no one but Harry could ever be this dumb.
She nodded. “Consider it done.”
“What are you even doing here?” Harry asked.
“Well, we did go to school with him for six years, it’s not like we aren’t familiar with him,” Hermione pointed out. “And frankly, he’s quite obvious about it.”
“Draco?” Pansy asked somewhere nearby in the hallway, and he heard her heels clicking as she approached. “Oh, good, I was hoping to catch you before-” She gasped, presumedly because she’d caught a glimpse of Draco’s office. “Salazar!”
could
“Well, yes, I’m aware, else I’d be dead in a ditch somewhere by now. But it’s different when…what I did back in sixth year…” Draco shrugged, a bit helplessly.  It had been so long ago, and he was no longer that person, but at the same time it felt as fresh as though it had happened yesterday. He was responsible for allowing Death Eaters into what had at the time been the ultimate sanctuary. Students had been hurt because of it. It didn’t feel right to expect a warm welcome back, now or in the future.
“Where are we going?” Draco gasped after several long, breathless seconds.
bottles?"
“I can’t believe that you’re worrying about something completely irrelevant because we
Right. Great. That was decided, then.
“I’m having a crisis here!”
There is a long silence, and Draco can tell the exact moment Potter figures it out by the breath he sucks in.
Potter gave him a long look but turned away once the door was flung open.
“Fix things?” Harry asked, sounding flabbergasted. “By…killing people?”
Hermione peered into is face. “You need some fresh air,” she determined.
A hand came to lie on his shoulder. Draco didn't even flinch at the contact, like he would have done some weeks ago. He had gotten used to having Harry's hands on him, and wasn't that just an odd little fact?
Draco cleared his throat. “You know, if you’re going to help Victoria, you should probably get started.”
“I would have felt the wards going down, yes.”
“By filling them all with your limbs? Mate, I hate to break it to you, but you wouldn’t have gotten very far.” The person crouched in front of him.
“Marzipan,” Kingsley says around a mouthful of the very same, having taken a hearty bite.
“Right as rain, Potter,” he said coolly, and decided there and then that he'd had enough of the party. Screw Pansy and Blaise and inter-house unity and all of that. He was going back to the dorm, where he would fight and probably lose to the temptation of slipping beneath his blankets and pretending the world outside his bed no longer existed.
“You know what that means, don’t you?” Theo asks. “Pansy and Hermione will be absolutely impossible about this.”
“Maybe,” said Draco, “we switch to first names every time you go through the loop.”
“Wedding!” Harry yelped.
And Harry smiled. It was a full, sincere smile that made it clear how proud he was that Draco had managed to get the words out, and that he understood how much it meant to both of them.
“This isn’t up for debate – it’s my flat, and I say we aren’t getting one.”
Draco lunged for Potter's wrist. His arms were shaking madly as he tried to get his former adversary to tighten his grip.
“Er...” Harry ran a hand through his perpetually messy hair. “Look, Malfoy, I know this year hasn't been the easiest for you-”
“Anything else?” Selwyn demanded.
“I stand by my word choice, Parkinson.”
could have done it,” Smith said petulantly, and Draco marvelled at the fact that his nose was still so straight when he had the most punch-able sulky expression Draco had ever seen.
“But now they’re starting to act differently,” Weasley says thoughtfully. “Especially Harry.”
She shook her head. “I don’t think it’s a good idea to tell anyone else. Parvati might decide to question all of the Unspeakables or something of the sort, and if our poisoner has even the slightest inkling that we’re onto them, our job will probably get a lot more difficult. I’d like to avoid that. You haven’t told anyone, have you?”
He waits. She waits. Draco waits, and so does everyone else who’s witnessing the scene, which means that the doorway is now effectively out of commission.
Chapter 3
I'd like to say thank you for all the wonderful comments on this story so far - they're heartening to read and help encourage me to stick with it. I'm very, very appreciative.
“I mean,” he said, clearing his throat, “you two clearly have more to talk about. I’ll leave you to it.”
Weasley snorted. “Mate, have you met yourself?”
Draco nodded curtly. His stomach was churning. There were many very good reason he hadn't been cut out to be a Death Eater, and one of them was his inability to maintain a clear head under certain kinds of pressure. He felt
Warm fingers brushed his own. Surprised, he looked over at Harry – or rather, at the annoying glamour Harry was wearing once again. “What?”
Blaise shrugged. "Or that. Now watch."
time flow,” she told them. “It’s all passive, observational, nothing you could use to actually travel in time, or really influence time in any way at all.”
“I didn’t mean to,” Potter said quietly, eyes still fixed on Draco.
“You barely ever eat,” Potter burst out, hand tapping a nervous rhythm on his thigh. Draco's own fingers twitched in sympathy. “I just... why don't you eat?”
Draco doesn’t let go of Potter until they’ve left the library and are standing in an empty corridor, both with the same sort of haunted expression on their faces.
Eventually, they found the address they had been looking for ten steps into a narrow side street, fairly close to where they had been looking.
“Sometimes,” he said eventually. “If something happens to remind me of what I did, then yes.”
your secret admirer’s gender, as well as, oh,
And Granger said, “Time Sand.”
To his horror, Potter gave the row of lampposts lining the sidewalk a considering look. “Do you think it’s true that your tongue gets stuck if you try? Why would it do that? I’ve half a mind to find out if –”
Potter reached for something on the floor next to him. The wand he held up a moment later looked vaguely familiar to Draco, but he couldn’t quite place it. It was unassuming, dark wood and little in the way of decoration, and yet his attention was captured by it in a way that felt…strange.
“Mom is ecstatic. I had to talk her down from telling the next thirty people she saw. I mean, I don’t want to sound pessimistic, but Bill said that you never know at this stage if…you know, if everything will go well. And it made me realize how excited I am, even if I didn’t find out under ideal circumstances.”
“Well apparently there is,” said Potter, “because here we are.”
Draco rubbed his eyes. “I stashed it in a closet,” he said. He didn’t even try to hide his distress, slumped as he was on his chair, robes wrinkled.
“I think you should focus on working out the formula for a drinkable antidote instead.”
“Smooth,” said Blaise, who was suddenly next to him.
Draco's head shot up. He hadn't realized he had lowered it.
“Certainly.” Draco fished for his wand. “So without the time loop, Harry should be about-“
Draco brushed his fingers once more across the words
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Honestly,” she said, and crouched at his side.
Blaise did an impressive amount of shaking before pouring the now sparkling green gin into the glasses over crushed ice. Once he was finished, he adjusted his sleeves, reached for the crème de mure and cleared his throat.
“Sure we have, mate,” said Weasley, reached forward and grabbed an entire handful of candy canes. “We’ve got it narrowed down to only a few people, haven’t we? That’s got to count for something.”
“If you treated another victim, I need to know about it,” Parvati insisted.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Well, no, but I don’t think the loop is long enough that you’d have had a chance to, by now. You’ve probably lost something like two or three years – I’m completely guessing, but I doubt it’s more than that.”
“I’ll make sure that you’re alerted to any urgent questions or concerns,” Hermione promised immediately.
Pansy groaned. “Oh Merlin, you think it looks like you and Potter!”
I've fallen behind a bit more - sorry! I was fighting anxiety attacks for a large part of this chapter, and the rest of my life wasn't exactly being cooperative either.
“I think we get the picture,” Draco interrupted her, feeling mildly horrified.
“Fuck you, Potter,” he said, too tired even to put anger into the words.
“It’s no problem,” she keeps assuring Longbottom. “I’m glad I could help.”
“Is that supposed to happen?” Weasley asked.
“I won't,” Potter said predictably.
Draco’s heart sinks immediately. He tries for a neutral expression, but Potter knows him to well to let it pass.
Potter looked amused. “That’s rather a loaded question.”
Hermione set her trifle down on the coffee table with care, stood and towered over her husband with her hands on her hips. “Ronald Bilius Weasley, you’re soon going to have a daughter who stands a good chance of inheriting my bookishness and appreciation for logical reasoning, and if you make this sort of comment about her even just one single time, so help me Merlin –”
“Potter, if there
Draco hissed, “If this ends up ruining my cloak –”
Draco tried not to look faintly amused even as his mind kept spinning.
The Christmas tree
Harry leapt off the bus, reached his front door in three steps and burst through it with more force than he’d planned. It crashed against the wall and rebounded, hitting Harry in the shoulder.
Blaise raised an eyebrow. “Batshit crazy?”
“I suppose you’ll want to take the Floo?” he asked as he downed the remainder of his tea and carefully wrapped up the rest of the pastries.
Draco handed Blaise one of the glasses and tried his best to enjoy his first sip of wine despite his agitation. “You only give them out for experiments, correct?”
“Potter, help me,” he eventually managed to gasp, and then lost consciousness.
about it, about Potter being so impressed by Draco’s wit and skill that he’d simply grab Draco and bend him over his own desk to fuck him so hard that it made the paintings on the wall rattle.
Blaise.”
“How dare you tell me what I will or won’t feel for you?” Harry growled. “I’m sick of decisions being made on my behalf, you know that? Did you ever think about asking me how I felt? No, of course not. That would have made sense, and we can’t have that now, can we?”
He found himself yearning for touch, for Harry’s touch, even when he wasn’t at his worst. It was more than coping, at this point, it was pure want, a luxury. But he thought he was good at hiding it. He thought that until they were both up late one night, studying in the 8
“Welcome to round two,” Parkinson announces. “You know what that means! It’s the Wands Away round!”
“Yes.”
Draco, who was quite warm from the physical exercise he’d just gotten, rolled his eyes and turned to go.
, Harry?” Hermione sounded incredulous, which…Harry couldn’t blame her.
“You’ve always been sodding lucky,” Draco grumps, but it’s good-natured.
“It’s, er…”
“I found everyone like this,” Kingsley explained with authority.
“Don't slap my face,” he said eventually. “My father did, when he was really upset at me. It only happened twice, but I won't react well to it. And don't... don't break any bones or give me scars.”
“She’s the Unspeakable responsible for the Love Room, so that should tell you enough about the sort of person she is.”
“They are my assistants,” Draco said promptly in his most imperious Malfoy voice.
“Obviously I need to know what the poison is first of all,” Draco replied, and considered pinching the back of his own hand to jolt himself out of the fog of exhaustion that was closing in on him. “I have a few diagnostic spells I can cast on him as he is, but I’ll need a small skin sample, a blood sample, and a hair sample as well. If it’s a poison I’m familiar with, or even a combination of them, brewing an antidote should be fairly straightforward, although it depends some on how long the poison has been in his system. If it’s something I’ve never seen, or something botched…” Draco grimaced. “I can still do it, but I can’t predict how long it’ll take me, or what’s involved.”
(See the end of the chapter for
I plan to stop at kissing, you’re in for a very big surprise.” With that, he forced Harry’s shirt over his head and tossed it away along with the towel that Harry had forgotten he had slung across his shoulders. He felt Draco’s fingers sinking into his hair, and they kissed and kissed until Harry thought his lips might go numb.
“Will she have a way to get in contact with me while she’s here?” he asked.
“Why?”
“Today’s theme, which was picked by a vote on the WWN, is the four seasons. Honestly, I’m a bit disappointed – I was hoping that one of the more outrageous suggestions would come out on top, such as Celestina Warbeck song titles, or the one that…what was it called? Ah yes, ‘Guilty Pleasures’.”
Blaise looked thoughtful. “A few basic spells to make sure everything’s in working order and ready for re-enchanting. But not really anything to determine specifically whether someone’s trying to fool us. It never seemed necessary, not when the only people using them were the ones working in the Department of Mysteries. They’ve got potential for abuse, of course, but so do half of the Wizard Wheezes products.”
“Of course not,” Severus said, biting and cynical.
and sent his thoughts into a rapid tailspin every time.
“And?”
“Well, to be fair,” said Draco, “there was always a lot of other stuff going on.”
"Draco, you can take a few minutes, because developing this antidote will be for naught if Harry screws up and dies or else rewinds time with a message on his arm that'll sabotage what we've all worked toward for seventeen iterations."
“Usually, when people say that, they turn out to be wrong,” Draco muttered.
“No, it’ll take effect too fast. They won’t have time to.”
“His name’s Leroy –”
“If you like,” he said, trying to sound unconcerned, but his feelings were betrayed by the scratchiness in his voice.
“I wasn’t exactly looking at the clock while we argued.”
Hermione beamed as she lit them with her wand and then directed them up to hang beneath the ceiling.
“Invite us to the wedding,” Philomena demanded.
“Harry,” Draco said, patiently and…fondly? “You do realize that I hold your hand whenever we’re out somewhere together? And that I call you ‘love’ in front of all our friends? And that you’ve brought me to Weasley Family Dinner
Draco rolls his eyes. “And how are we going to do that? They’re not oblivious.”
“Clearwater, right?” he asked.
Parvati pursed her lips and gave Draco a very long look.
Draco has stopped moaning with pleasure by the time they were in the lift but that didn’t mean he wasn’t enjoying the remainder of his meal. Potter, damn him, still hadn’t lost the smirk he’d worn ever since Draco had taken his very first bite.
“Oh,” he said. “Oh,
recalcitrant so far. And what is your name, young man?”
It only took a short while.
“Because... I don't know,” Potter admitted. "I was just concerned."
of this.”
“Well, she’s upset, and when she’s upset she likes to keep busy. Since she’s obviously not in the office, and there’s not a library down here to my knowledge, I’d guess in the Time Room, wherever that is from here.”
“Yes, I am putting it that way.” Ron flapped his hand at Harry. “Now leave the thinking to the smart people and go paint.”
“We’ve been trying to figure out the order,” said Potter.
Weasley asked, baffled.
Marielle seemed to realize they were talking about her, because her eyes met Draco’s, and she gave him a smile before taking off the headphones with her free hand.
“So?” he asked.

He had done a blood analysis so many times he could have done it in his sleep. But things wouldn’t be that simple, he realized once he had it under the microscope.
“Hermione said that too,” Harry told him. “Hey, did you two talk about me behind my back?”
“No. I transfigured it into a spit roast so I could cook squirrels.”
“May I see it?”
, probably affixed with a sticking charm.
“We should let it warm up,” Harry remarked.
It’s fiddly work, and there isn’t a good spell to keep the delicate cake layer from breaking, at least not one that Harry’s found. Behind him, Hermione’s muttering grows increasingly desperate. Padma is crying into her crumbling peppermint mocha creation, and Neville switches frantically between comforting her and finishing his own work. At the station next to Harry’s, Draco keeps blotting his face with a monogramed handkerchief, and Ernie, who insists on calling his roll a
“Give it a rest, Potter, it’s been hard on her,” Draco said, and tried to ignore the way they both looked at him in surprise. “She’s technically not supposed to tell him anything at all, and she’s been dealing with shock and stress.”
Blaise shrugs. “Same reason. Hermione thought you’d balk, and Pansy was scared you’d try to nip the entire thing in the bud. I mean, you haven't exactly been the epitome of tolerance for Slytherins up until now.”
“I died,” Potter said softly.
Draco stared with his mouth open. He cleared his throat after a good fifteen seconds of silent staring and asked, “The…the stuff that’s inside time turners?”
Harry suddenly found it hard to breathe. He struggled out of his chair. “Stop! Stop the bus!” he yelled. “I need to go back! I need to tell Draco that I, er…”
“One-thirty, maybe?”
You all have been very kind to me, and I appreciate the graciousness, understanding, and words of encouragement of everyone who has commented.  I really like this community, and I'm hoping to stay. Writing often helps me in the never-ending fight against my own mind, and it's nice to have someone to write FOR. Lots of love to you all!
Potter cleared his throat. “You know, this pureblood pissing contest is entertaining and all, but we’re trying to solve a murder here.”
“Honestly, Weasley, ‘murder-snakes’?”
Draco cleared his throat. “Potter wants to speak with you,” he said. “I’ve brought him along.”
Granger gave a single nod, staring at the wall and looking deep in thought.
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked.
“Voldemort tried to cheat death,” she said then, and it was only because of long months of purposefully done desensitization that Draco didn’t flinch. “So even if I could, even if I wanted to…if I did that to him, if I perverted everything Harry stood for because of some selfish desire to have him back, he would never, ever forgive it, or accept it. He’d kill me, and then probably himself out of principle.”
Potter looked down at Draco's wrist and frowned. It was fairly clear at what – Draco had scratched himself raw not three hours earlier, and swelling and redness still peeked out from beneath the cuff of his shirt.
Draco said nothing.
“They looked at both the ruins and the floorplans. It was an enclosed space, no windows, no secret tunnels.”
They were all silent for a moment, digesting that. Weasley scratched his head eventually and announced, “Still makes no bloody sense.”
The corner of Parvati’s mouth quirked upwards ever so slightly. “That may just be the single most unlikely thing I’ve heard this year.”
“I asked why you weren’t at pub night. Forgot, I assume?”
“Hmm.” Granger scraped the minced ginger root into a neat pile and slid it Draco’s way. “Clever.”
He hopes that, one day, Draco will look at the mark and instead of feeling hot shame, he will remember the intense scene, remember rope burns and stinging pain, aching muscles and heat racing up his spine, and he will think,
“Wait a few days, then ask him on a date,” she said. “Simple.”
Draco snorted in both amusement and complete disbelief. Potter had some very strange ideas about how to convince people of something. He kept looking at the words, tracing them with his eyes, and only when he realized that his thumb was brushing over the letters of his own name in Harry’s handwriting did he snap out of it, cursing under his breath as he shoved the note into his pocket and tried to pretend it didn’t exist.
“Nice to see you, Parkinson,” said Potter politely. He pushed the door closed behind him and proceeded to approach as though Draco were a wild animal. There was a large, thin, square package in his hands. “Er, hi,” he said.
“Idle curiosity, really. You said before that some of it looked like sensitive information. I’ve been wondering how and why it’s all written down on his skin, but I haven’t been able to come up with a plausible reason. Unless he thought he might be obliviated, but…well, none of it quite fits. The poison message wasn’t there because he might be obliviated, it was because he knew he wouldn’t be conscious to tell anyone.”
"Yes. Harry is liable to do something reckless, and that concerns me. I was hoping you would see the need for a light hand when it comes to the messages."
. No patient who leaves my ward owes me a life debt or any other.”
“His…” Blaise hesitated. “His skin is turning yellow.”
have a smile on my face.”
Draco capped the green marker he’d been using to highlight the spots where he would inject the serum to help fight cell decay into Potter’s body. He hadn’t needed to brew it fresh, thank Merlin, because that might have taken a month or two. It was still in an experimental stage – he’d been trying to develop something to help the formerly poisoned patients in his ward recover for a while – but this entire operation was experimental, and it was the best option they had.
Potter’s body shuddered. For a long, tense moment, nothing else happened, but then his chest gradually started to rise.
Draco turned his body a little and shifted, and suddenly Potter was in his arms, shaking like mad.
Harry isn’t sure whether to feel bad about being a distraction, or be upset because he’s clearly being blamed for something that isn’t his fault. In the end, he decides to let it go in favor of focusing on his gingerbread once more. He has decided to cut out far more animal shapes than he actually requires, in case some of them burn in the oven.
“You two are upsetting Evadne,” said the bigger goblin, who was wearing a flower-print tunic. “Stop it.”
“Macmillan,” he hears Parkinson’s voice somewhere toward the front of the tent, magically amplified for the benefit of the many spectators, including those listening on the wireless. “Tell us about the sort of swiss roll you’re making today!”
Harry looked down at the floor, squirming a little. “Hermione said it brings out my eyes.”
Potter nodded, staring straight ahead. Then he turned abruptly and pressed his forehead to Draco’s shoulder.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh,” Potter said.
“Tell me your guesses first,” Draco demanded.
He found himself at the top of the astronomy tower, huddled into a corner, a bottle of firewhisky in one hand and a goblet in the other, because damn it, he still had a modicum of class left and wasn’t about to drink straight from the bottle. He poured himself more and raised his drink in a mock-toast before throwing back the vile liquid. Then he tilted his head back and looked at the stars, wishing himself among them like he had so many times during the war. It soothed him to imagine himself as his own constellation, seeing the world from so far up that all of his problems shrunk to complete insignificance.
Parkinson leans her head cheekily against Ron’s shoulder, which makes him startle and look alarmed. “The overall winner from this Charity Bake-Off event will receive a guest column in Witch Weekly, an interview on-air at the Wizarding Wireless Network’s Witching Hour, a profile in the Daily Prophet, and a place of honor at the ribbon cutting for the new Young Witches and Wizards Primary Education Center, which is slated to happen in August of this year. As you probably already know, all profits from this event will benefit the War Orphans Fund and the Ascendio Project.”
“Goodness gracious, young man,” the witch said. “Has my spell worn off again?”
“Brilliant.” Weasley beamed, then went back to looking puzzled. “Not sure what Christmas carols there are with an ‘L’, though – I always try to get out of singing them. The only one I’m fond of is the one with the hippogriffs.”
“I know.” Potter's voice wasn't entirely steady. “I know. It spooked me too. Everyone's pretty shaken up, I think.”
They were sitting in Granger and Weasley’s living room, all of them having just gotten back from the flat Cristina Loughty had shared with her girlfriend Sylvana Brown, who had been Lavender Brown’s cousin. They hadn’t asked much as Cristina seemed too grief-stricken to do more than answer basic questions. Parvati was taking it hard as well.
Harry said with emphasis. “Honestly, no.”
“Hermione –”
Draco shifted and tried to keep his fidgeting under control as his body went suddenly cold.
"Acerola cherries," Blaise said patiently, swiped his wand and sent cherry juice dripping onto the mint. Then the mint went into the gin, and next thing Draco knew, Blaise was wielding his cocktail shaker in enthusiastic fashion. When he saw Draco’s questioning look, he grinned. “Goldstein taught me the Muggle way originally. I’ve grown rather fond of it – makes me feel like I’ve
He made a compelling argument. Draco stood once more, cheered by the prospect of drinking with Blaise – he’d skipped pub night, after all, which meant they were overdue to sit around, drink and complain about whatever there was to complain about.
Potter sighed and stuffed his hands in his coat pockets while trying to put on what was probably supposed to be an exasperated expression. He’d gone quite minimal on the glamour today though, so Draco mostly just found it adorable. “The point is for it to spread festive cheer.”
Harry stroked back up his arms, slow and firm. “We were still planning on going back to the Christmas market, weren’t we? You could buy them one of those spinning wooden pyramids with the candles.”
“Mrow,” Evadne opined. She jumped back onto Harry’s armrest and gave him a piercing stare. Harry felt very ganged up on.
“Have a seat, mate,” Weasley invites his best friend. “Millicent and Theo are bringing snacks from the kitchen.”
“I should go back to class,” Potter said awkwardly. “Are you going to be all right? I'll... I'll tell them you went to see Pomfrey for a calming draught.”
“Do I…
Harry's hand wandered up his neck, palm stroking his skin, and then his fingers twisted in Draco's hair. He tugged lightly, and Draco closed his eyes in response. His heart was pounding in his chest like it had after the nightmare, but that was the last thing he was thinking of just now. It was all Harry's closeness – and when had Potter become
“Huh,” said Draco after giving him another kiss. “Some people? What people? Will this be in the Prophet come morning?”
“Hate whoever did this to her,” Harry whispered.
poisoned, you won’t be able to redo the antidote for the both of us even if there
“Yes,” he hissed through the haze of pain. “Yes, just like that.”
Well, maybe he is, a little bit. Harry has, after all, spent the better part of the last three weeks with the git, trying to turn him into a baker, and they haven’t tried to kill or maim each other once, which is a massive improvement from…well, anything that happened before eighth year, really. So yes, Draco has something resembling positive qualities, and Harry is confident enough,
, and
“I take it your husband is upset?”
Besides, he knows Draco would be highly offended at being called endearing, so it’s a win for Harry either way.
There had long been a sort of undercurrent coloring his every interaction with Potter, a buzzing
Harry didn’t respond. He just kept running, running, pulling Draco with him, and then he opened a door and they staggered inside, and Draco nearly fell down a number of huge stone steps. He threw himself backward, landed painfully and gritted his teeth to try and ignore the pain shooting through his wrist.
Madam Pomfrey started working immediately. She called through the room to her assistant, “Holly, quickly! I need Essence of Dittany, healing cloths, and blood replenishing potions, now!”
“Draco…”
that felt like anxiety except not really, took a calming breath, and managed a terse nod.
“No.” Draco admitted. “I haven’t talked to him at all since it happened. I left for work earlier than normal so I could avoid him.”
They say a polite thank you and have a seat, and Draco is struck by how content Potter looks, sitting there opposite him, mouth so full he looks like an obese Puffskein and yet still able to give Draco a smile. It feels…nice, sitting here together, and Draco wishes they could do it more often.
Victoria took out her wand and cast a Tempus. “It’s past five already, and your brain is definitely toast for the day. Go home, see what happens when you’re around him, report back to me tomorrow.”
“Right.” Potter laid aside the parchment he’d been holding, which had a lot of text and lines on it and was folded in a complicated way. He pulled up the sleeve of his jumper and allowed the words on his skin to unscramble and sharpen, apparently able to reveal them wandlessly now.
“Dear Merlin, I’m in love with the world’s biggest idiot,” Draco said, and knelt down, smiling, to kiss Harry in front of everyone.
“Fuck,” Draco breathed, still staring at the Veil, “fuck,
“I used to hate him, actually,” Harry admitted. He wasn’t sure why he was sharing all of this; he usually detested strangers knowing his personal business. It felt oddly nice though, being able to let it all out. “And he simply loathed me. But over the past couple of years, we managed to mend fences. We were both tired of all the negativity. We started meeting up for coffee every once in a while, just to talk, and we actually got on quite well. Then he told me he was looking for a new place to live, and my old flatmate moved out because Hogwarts offered him a teaching position, so it all worked out quite well.
He’d figured they’d talk more, now that they were sober. He hadn’t expected Harry to catch up to him, to grab him by the shoulder as soon as they got to their bathroom, spin him around and press him against the wall. His hot mouth claimed Draco’s, and there were tender, eager touches and hard, throbbing bulges pressed against each other, and as Draco moaned he barely registered Harry flicking his wand at the door to place what was hopefully a damn good privacy spell.
He would have to tell Victoria he would still need her after all.
“Relax,” he said in that new, calm and confident tone of his, and his hands framed Draco’s face. “Close your eyes.”
“Fine,” Draco mumbled, and swayed. He felt heavy, suddenly. All the energy seemed to have drained from him.
“Ah.” Draco yawned.
Hermione let go of the berries again and stepped back onto the path. “Should be almost late enough now that everyone’s gone home, but not quite – shall we get a warm drink to pass the time?”
Weasley started on the task of casting spells to clean the dishes as Granger stood in the middle of the room, looking undecided. “Dessert first or gifts first?” she asked.
“I hope you understand that my presence is required,” she said when Charlotte Fletcher, a dull and exhausted-looking fifth-year Ravenclaw, had arrived at the headmistress’ office and introductions had been made.
“Pumpkin cheesecake coconut and sprinkles.”
Weasey made a noise of protest that faded into something more contemplative as it apparently occurred to him that it wasn’t an insult so much as a fact.
“Alright.”
“Did she keep those letters?”
“So if there had been only one, they’d have been triggered?”
is going on?” Potter asks.
And then Goyle starts carrying Hannah Abbot’s books for her when she badly burns both her hands in Potions class and has to have them wrapped up for a week, and Draco can’t do anything but look on in despair.
Draco frowned. “Why?”
“Okay, fine, yes, but...” Potter sighed. “I'd prefer it if you didn't hurt yourself. I don't want anyone hurting.”
, he thought, wanting nothing more than to drop onto the nearest bed.
Draco couldn’t suppress a small flinch, and Potter cleared his throat and went to the door. “Yes, Hermione?” he asked.
told?”
“Nothing. Didn’t recognize anyone, didn’t know what her name was…she wasn’t surprised by magic, but she couldn’t name a single spell either. It’s…well, it’s awful. It also terrifies me – the thought of this happening to more people I care about, I mean. The poison is still out there.”
So the question was…even if he could figure out what the instructions meant – would he follow them? The fact that the message had been encoded for Draco specifically meant it could only be from one of a handful of people who knew his public key, none of which were likely to have been in contact with Potter.
Harry moved to obey just as Draco continued, “She’s got you pegged though, you obtuse human boy.”
“They don’t want me there.”
“Right,” said Blaise, and Draco realized he had been silent for far too long. “Good talk.”
Rose.” He watched the letters reform into numbers, feeling the chills getting worse as he did, and then cleared his throat. “Right, are you ready?”
She laughed. “Go home and have some tea and think about the cheeky snowman in a telephone box,” she advised.
“There has got to be some sort of explanation,” said Victoria, safely on the other side of the room and facing the wall, so she wouldn’t have to look at what Draco was doing. He couldn’t really blame her – she did not have Draco’s training, so he wouldn’t have expected her to have developed the clinical detachment that allowed him to cut open a corpse and take samples. He still didn’t like the experience, but it wouldn’t give him nightmares.
“Fine,” he said. “Meet me in the same bathroom after dinner tonight. We can talk then. I'm not letting you bring down my Potions 'O'.”
“Well, it’s clearly not what’s happening.” Granger…Hermione gestured at Harry’s arm. “Since things are changing, and you do know. Oh! I wonder if you age. I would think so, but I’m not sure how we could check.”
There was a long silence as Parvati stared, alternating from Granger to Draco. Eventually she said, flatly, “That’s not possible.”
“Maybe you could bring me treacle tart in the common room,” Potter suggests.
Draco didn’t want to be entirely passive, so he brought his hand up to his mouth and spat in it. Blindly, he reached back and found Harry’s cock, smooth and hot and hard against the palm of his hand, and he started stroking and caressing. There was a sound from Harry like a half-suppressed little whine. Draco loved it, and he tried to draw out more of the same but was foiled when slick fingers twisted inside him and made him lose track of what was happening. Both his hands shot up to grab the edge of the sink tightly.
“Yes,” Harry said. “I make breakfast all the time. Why does that matter?”
“How is it you’re always able to find me?” he demanded to know.
Potter nodded.
“Why are you here, Potter?” Draco asked tiredly.
“It was clear, though, when we rolled him over and saw his face,” said Clearwater. “I went to fetch Hermione, and then we saw the writing.”
“Malfoy, you've got to eat. You've lost so much weight... your robes are hanging on you like...” Potter trailed off, frowned. “Is this about punishing yourself?”
“And you’re sure your detection spells are sound?”
Clara Goldhorn’s eyes were red-rimmed, and Draco didn’t blame her. From what Parvati had told him about the investigation, the woman had been through quite the ordeal. She had found her boss dead in her office, been accused of the deed, been fired, and then been accused of having had an affair with her boss when she came back to the Ministry to collect her things.
"Setting things on fire and explosions are not technically the same thing, and anyway, I can leave off that step if it makes your little rabbit heart happy."
It took a while until Hermione could get herself to stop leafing through her new book and laid it down as well. Once she had, she grabbed her wand again. “This wasn’t…well, it wasn’t very creative of us, Draco, and I was pulling my hair out trying to wrap it, but I hope you’ll enjoy it nonetheless.”
“Rose?”
carefully. Harry, why are you here? Malfoy or someone else could have come and fetched me.”
believe you’re all in agreement about keeping me
Harry tried to jump up, but that didn’t work the way he had imagined because his arm had gotten caught on a root or something of the sort, and so instead he nearly wrenched his shoulder out of its socket. “Ahrg!” he yelled.
He said as much to Potter – not because it was relevant but because he needed a distraction to keep Potter from wondering why Draco had been so reserved and silent all morning. As he had hoped, it made Potter smile, and a nostalgic expression appeared on his face.
“No, we don’t. I’m sure Granger and Weasley will have one, and I’m also sure they’ll be happy to let you stare at it for a while.”
“What?” he asked.
Then Harry shifted, reached for his wand, and, after casting another warming charm, cleared his throat. “Is there anything that you want me not to do? Anything you might not like?”
“No,” Draco said immediately, then felt his face go even warmer. “I mean…you don’t…you don’t need to make it a priority, is what I mean.”
“Right, so.” Potter held his arm out. “Do you need to write it down on some parchment? Or can you decode it straight from here?”
A short, oppressive moment of silence later, Granger huffed out a humorless laugh. “I was waiting for Zach to make a scathing remark, just now,” she said. “I’m so glad he went off to sleep. I’m not anywhere near calm enough to keep from hexing him.”
“Oh, Harry.” Granger stood and hurried to his side so she could put her arms around him and hug him tightly. “We can figure this out. I promise we can.”
Then the wand dropped and Harry's fingers were in his hair, and his head was pulled up sharply, and then Harry was kissing him so hard that Draco lost himself in it completely. There was nothing but lips and tongue, teeth and taste, a hand still in his hair and the other around his waist while Draco clung to Harry like he was drowning. He moved closer as though he wanted to crawl into Harry and be consumed whole, but all he managed was to situate himself on Harry's lap and rub against him to stoke that white-hot fire even further. Harry groaned into his mouth, and then his hips were moving too, hastily, without finesse. It was clumsy and hot, and it took no time at all until Draco came in his pyjamas with a cry and with Harry biting his lip. Harry himself followed soon after, pressing his face into Draco's neck as he shuddered.
Prompt #3 – Hogwarts in the snow
Draco clumsily crouched on the slick tiles, nearly falling. He put his head in his hands, squeezed his eyes shut, and tried not to sob.
That said, I AM committed to writing this thing, but updates will probably be slower or irregular because circumstances are very much against me right now. Thank you for understanding. ❤
Harry gave her a blank stare. “His…ore mine.”
"I am," Weasley assured her and immediately reached into one of the crates. A moment later, he held one end of a string of fairly lights which flickered in red and gold. "Doorframe, d'you reckon?"
“I dunno, mate, I just noticed it too.” A dark-haired man had popped up next to Draco, newspaper held in a limp hand as he studied the sight with a puzzled frown.
“Oh, stuff it, Malfoy, unless you’ve got a better idea.”
“Oh, of course. She’s been feeling guilty for far too long, don’t you think? Besides, I needed a distraction.” She bit her lip.
“I asked Hermione-”
“Cheers, Ron.”
“We did as much as we reasonably could, Hank,” Hermione told him gently.
“Right, okay, I assume you have a point beyond ‘Have a look at Penelope and this bloke who definitely couldn’t have helped her’?”
Who was he kidding, he was dead curious, and that was all there was to it.
“Oh,” said Harry, and then, “Oh!
“I am,” Potter protested. “Do you see me hurling insults? I mean, apart from the accidental one just now?”
Weasley snorted and shook his head. “I can’t believe that’s the name you came up with,” he said. “Fine. I’ll go get him, shall I? You two can explain.”
Draco shook his head.
not.”
“Do you need anything from me?” she asked. “Or from Harry, I suppose?”
“A little heavy on the ginger,” Kingsley says.
He stumbled out of the office. It occurred to him how incredibly rude that was only after it was far too late to go back and apologise. He hurried frantically through the ministry, because he had to figure this out
It was, truth be told, rather maddening. And Draco continued picking at his food and saying nothing in any of his classes, and his life almost felt like it had before Harry Potter had found him in a bathroom and pulled his hair out of some strange concern for Draco.
“So,” said Victoria, leaning against the door jamb and squinting at Draco, who had decided to spend the latter half of his day working on the antidote despite it being his day off. His hours would be irregular from now on anyway, since he was once again being temporarily employed by the Ministry and had to be available for witness interviews and the like.
“Ah,” Potter said awkwardly and stared into space.
“Good,” he said, and moved on to the next thing his mind kept fretting about. “Though I can tell you aren't a Slytherin. Else you would already have started bargaining for something in return.”
“Lab,” Draco agreed.
The wands of his teachers, and Draco watching attentively as they performed their spells in front of the students.  Snape, clearing the smoke from one of Finnigan’s explosions. Flitwick, demonstrating the levitation charm. McGonagall, transforming animals into water goblets.
Harry wishes he could tell him. “I have no bloody clue,” he admits. “It just sort of happened.”
“I could have worded that better,” he admitted.
“Don’t mention it. To anyone. Also don’t mention that we’re making another stop for essential provisions.” And with that, Blaise dragged him into Honeydukes and bought Draco enough chocolate to keep him in good spirits for days to come.
is not how antidotes work,” said Smith.
Classes at Hogwarts, and the wands of his classmates. Beech and walnut and maple and elm, but never that particular dark wood, the one he’d seen in Potter’s hand.
“And…” Draco’s foot bumped against something. He looked down. “That celebration includes disembodied genitalia?”
Harry processed that. If she was telling the truth – and she wouldn’t be cruel enough to lie right now, not Hermione – then that meant…and then…but Harry had thought…and Draco wouldn’t…
Because it was one thing to know he was hated, but another thing entirely to look someone in the eyes as they told him he should have killed himself after the war if he had any decency at all. Like casting curses and hitting dead center, they had pelted him with the truths Draco tried so hard to fight. That he was a coward. That he wasn't worth the dirt under Harry's fingernails. That he should have joined his father in Azkaban. That the world would be better off without him.
“I do have a job I need to get back to in a couple of days,” Draco reminded her mildly.
“I…I’ll need to cast a confidentiality charm first.”
she was poisoned during that meeting - and that’s a big ‘if’ - we’re looking at a maximum of just over an hour from the poison taking effect to death. The minimum would be just under ten minutes.”
“Suppose we’ll take a walk after all,” he heard, and a whispered spell and a pair of surprisingly strong arms supported him all the way to the nearest Apparition point.
Hermione, in the meantime, had taken on the task of affixing
“Hermione’s pregnant, Draco.”
“Let’s not overthink that part, maybe.”
“You never come to the reunions,” said Blaise, who’d obviously interpreted his gaze correctly.
“It’s working,” Draco confirmed. “Very well, actually.”
“We should have protected her better,” Harry muttered. He looked pale and shaken.
“Alright,” said Potter, and Draco watched with amusement as Potter took out his wand, transfigured a medium-sized rock into a chair, and went to sit down right there in the driveway, quill poised. “Don’t mind me, I’ll only be taking notes.”
, the note said.
with which to measure the rate of recovery. “We’ll have a few days of potions and healing spells ahead of us before that’s likely to happen.”
Draco tapped his finger against his lips as he thought. “Name sounds vaguely familiar, although I can’t quite place why. Not from a consultation, definitely, but there isn’t anything…Merlin, this will drive me insane until I figure it out.”
“I know,” Potter said, looking rueful. “If it hadn’t happened to me or had such enormous consequences, I’d be laughing too.”
“Oh,” he said and peered down at his feet. He wasn’t very far up, only just floating, but it was disconcerting, nonetheless.
was feeling this awful…he couldn’t imagine how Harry felt. He’d been sitting by Susan’s bedside for the past half hour, and he might have held her hand if not for the stasis spell. A scowling older Auror Draco didn’t know was currently maintaining it, and another looked ready to leap into action to defend them both, if necessary. The Auror Department did not fuck around when it came to protecting their own, even if Bones had quit two years prior.
“What is it?” Draco asked again, impatiently.
When he came back down, he found himself clinging to Potter and panting into his neck. His legs shook madly, there was a soft buzzing sound in his ears, and he was slick with sweat. Potter was holding him a little awkwardly, half propping him against the wall, and Draco didn't understand why until a few minutes later, when he could finally stand on his own and Potter let him go, just to turn away and quickly adjust himself.
“Or everyone names something that starts with that letter,” Hermione suggested.
“I suppose. But I haven’t thought about how to do that yet.”
“Sorry,” he choked out eventually.
Charlotte looked at him, but it seemed to Draco like she didn’t see him at all. Her eyes were heartbreakingly lifeless and sad. “That’s a lot of names,” she said.
“Thank you,” Harry said. “Thank you so much. I can’t tell you…I’d never have figured it out on my own!”
“I’m Hermione Granger,” Hermione said eventually, very gently. “You’ve forgotten?”
She cleared her throat and changed her expression into one of polite concern in a way that looked very deliberate to Harry. “That’s not what I meant,” she said. “Tell me why you think he cares.”
“Can you tell me what it is?” he asked.
“Potter and Malfoy appear to be bonding over baked goods,” Parkinson chirps suddenly.
“I told some people about it,” Harry admitted. “About you. Apparently, it was...
“Draco asked me to reorganize all the books in his library while he’s gone,” she explained. “Oh! Speaking of books, do you think there’s one with a spell for this sort of situation? I mean, Harry can’t be the first one this has ever happened to.”
Draco did look and saw a snowed-over park, trees and bushes covered in frost, icicles hanging from branches. The sky was clear but beginning to darken, and Harry was wearing a ridiculous hat with five differently colored bobbles that made Draco want to kiss him.
Draco handed him the letter and went to close the window, but stopped almost immediately. “Oh Merlin,” he said, “there’s another one.”
“What?” Weasley asked, looking completely lost. Draco couldn’t say he blamed him.
"How strange," Hermione muttered, sounding half-preoccupied with the tangled string of lights in her hands.
“I’ve been busy,” Draco defended himself.
“You look
“What are you four doing?” a bossy voice demanded to know.
“Huh,” said Harry. “Clever trees, then, aren’t they?”
“Harry, we cannot let this stand! Do you hear me? There is no way either of us will be eliminated this first week, not after all the work we’ve done to get to this point!”
“I could ask you the same.”
“That…yes, I suppose that is what I’m saying.” Draco ran a hand through his hair and then made a face about it. It felt good not to have to suppress his favorite nervous tic because of blood-smeared gloves, but he'd overcompensated and now he was sure his hair looked beyond stupid. “But how does it
“That you time-travelled, that you lost your memory,” Granger reported dutifully.
The relief Draco felt at those words was overwhelming. In so short a time, he had come to depend on Harry and their sessions, on the relief they brought. For the first time since the war, he was able to sleep more than a few hours at a time, sometimes even through the night.
Potter said after making a small gurgling noise. Judging by his tone, the little particles were something that made him very,
“Absolutely not.”
“I,” Draco says. “No, I-”
Those reasons were one, he needed a moment to get it together and stop feeling like he might cry, and two, he still needed a gift for Harry.
doorway, and from both of those directions, there was suddenly someone advancing at her.
“My name’s Sky,” said the turquoise-haired girl and held up a fluffy towel. “Hold still.” She carefully dried his face and then wrapped the towel around Harry’s shoulders.
thought of it.”
“Shut it,” Harry said. He couldn’t seem to stop worrying his lip between his teeth, so he’d given up trying. “It was different from how he usually looks. He didn’t even seem to remember that I was really rude and ran out of his office two days ago. It was just this…”
"Would you like to see the lovely party trick Bartholomew and I can do?" Blaise asked eventually, either trying to distract Draco to keep him from frothing at the mouth - or else this trick of his had to be impressive enough for him to be excited about showing it off. Draco wasn;t sure which option he preferred.
There was a loud
Selwyn made a face.
“Stranger things have happened.”
of complaints! I…no, you don’t get it, do you?” She made a sound of bitter amusement. “Taking the high road doesn’t stop those people, Harry. I tried. I tried for so long, but nothing ever changed, and then I tried a different approach, and…look at it! It’s working, Harry. I can finally do something more than stand by and watch as these horrible people get away with belittling and discriminating and hurting and acting like it’s their right to do so.”
“Festive,” he said and went to hang it on the tree. “Now what’s this, then?”
“Erm, here’s a penis necklace.” Potter dangled something bright green from his fingers.
“I see,” said Ermintrude. “Well, don’t leave us hanging, what was the disagreement about?”
The corner of Draco’s mouth twitches. “We’ve never tried.” His hand is still cupping Harry’s face, and Harry finds himself wishing they could stay this way indefinitely. Draco is an oasis for Harry’s lost soul, not home, not yet, but a welcome reprieve, nonetheless.
“Draco has you all caught up?”
“Did she mention what she was going to work on?” Potter asked. He was only supposed to sit and take notes while Draco asked the questions, but Draco probably shouldn’t have expected that to actually happen.
He begged and begged through the stinging hexes, wondering faintly just how much of a mess his sore back had to be by now. This was different from before, from hair-pulling and biting, which seemed like child's play compared to the deep, dark need that Harry was bringing to the surface in him with this.
“It does.” The words slipped out before Draco could stop them. He groaned and poured himself more alcohol, because clearly, that was a good idea.
Severus breathed deeply, trying to keep it together. “What
“Yes, it is,” Clara confirmed. “She’d just finished a work meeting, three gentlemen from Games and Sports. She talked to me for a moment, and then she went back into her office. I checked on her…maybe fifteen minutes later? And that’s when I found her lying on the floor.”
“I spelled her to leave a short red trace, that should help,” Potter said as they started running after it, which was difficult because they had to look up at the sky and evade the crowds at the same time. After ten or fifteen seconds, they worked out a system – Potter looked up at the owl and shouted out directions while Draco held him by the arm and focused on steering them past anyone and anything in their way.
“Are you okay?” a completely frazzled Hermione asks him.
“See!” he shouted. “Didn’t get stuck.”
“Why Potter,” he said, carefully keeping his voice from shaking and instead infusing his speech with a healthy amount of disdain, “have you been
“I appreciate that you all want to help, but I can’t just let you mess around with an active investigation,” said Parvati.
“That’s too…hm.” Weasley frowned. “It’s just sort of…a bit too fancy, you know? Wouldn’t you feel strange changing the nappies of a baby named Oriana?”
“Nothing specific, no. She said she was only going to wrap up whatever she’d been working on before the meeting, and then go home.”
“You're being remarkably open about this,” Harry said.
“Maybe that’s what I’ve got to figure out,” said Potter. “How to keep from getting poisoned. Or maybe who’s poisoning me.”
“Hermione!” he called, bursting into her office. Too late, it occurred to him how incredibly rude he was being…again. He should probably stop doing that.
“That seems clever, but also complicated and annoying.”
“Have you eaten?” she asked without preamble.
“You said that, too.”
“Are you quite alright?” the same person asked, calmer.
“Because I was sick and tired of being walked all over, Harry. I was sick and tired of working for things and being sabotaged at every turn, of never getting what I strive for while certain people get everything handed to them. And nothing
“Potter, what’s the trick?” Draco hisses shamelessly.
Potter slowly lowered the sheet he held.
On the bright side, we finally solve one big mystery this chapter!
“You’re right.” Granger nodded and visibly pulled herself together. “Sorry, I didn’t mean…sorry.”
It was only a small noise, but it made Draco’s blood run cold. He drew his wand at the same time Harry did and sent a lightning-quick Stupefy in the direction of the darkened corridor leading to the lift, but the only thing that happened was..
The corner of Granger’s mouth twitched. “Yes, well, Ron and George wanted it to be as realistic as possible. They put quite a bit of work into it.”
She took a deep breath. “It’s Harry.”
She came over and sat next to Harry so she could put her arm around him. Weasley stepped closer too and clapped his hand on Harry’s shoulder. Draco was glad they were there for him, but at the same time, he couldn’t help but wish he could go over to them as well without feeling like he was intruding.
“Maybe put a bloody glamour on first.
Draco only shrugged. He didn't have the right to refuse a request like this, not these days. He couldn't imagine what Potter could possibly want from him that warranted tracking him down like this. He hadn't done anything. He stayed out of everyone's way with an efficiency that bordered on compulsion. His need for solitude defined him these days. If he was alone, huddled in a corner or in his bed, he couldn't get caught up in anything bad.
There was another very long moment of silence.
They were sitting out by the Quidditch pitch, where it was chilly and windy and where they couldn't be overheard. Regular warming charms kept their fingers from freezing to the point of pain. Draco had just been putting his wand away when Harry commented on his eating habits.
“Potter, I’m suffering here.”
There is a collective intake of sharp breaths when Pansy pulls out her wand, and then a mass exhalation when she simply casts the stasis charm, puts down the tray, and wishes Granger a successful study session before making her way over to where Draco is sitting.
"I'm getting to that part. I happened to be over at the Granger-Weasley household to discuss something with my colleague when Potter here burst through the Floo and started complaining about you and about the fact that you're being an absolute grouch –”
Draco would have asked why Potter was in stasis, but since Granger had summoned him because of his expertise, he assumed that it was the same reason why Draco’s patients so often were in stasis as well. “How do you know he’s been poisoned? What signs did he show?”
But now…now circumstances were so very different that the
“Tonight?”
“Draco,” said Potter, and
“Yes, Draco, the department.”
"Healers do have spells that check fetal development," Draco said. "A whole long battery of them, though, it takes bloody ages to get through - how many arms does the baby have, how many legs, how many heads, how many -"
“Strong stuff,” Harry said. He was slurring his words the slightest bit, which shouldn’t have been endearing. “Where’d you get it?”
“I know,” Harry said. Then he bent down and kissed Draco’s neck, eliciting a sound of approval. “But maybe just…take a little while to relax first?”
“I really don’t want to start talking out here,” she said.
“Rose,” Weasley said again, sounding awed, and embraced Granger.
