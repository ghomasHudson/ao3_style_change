On the way to the Great Hall for dinner – having fallen asleep at his kitchen table marking homework, and had therefore missed breakfast and lunch – Harry bumped into Mr Samuel Bartlett, a first year Slytherin, who had literally run into him as he turned the corner.
"Yes Draco, there are now twenty-three members of my adoptive family." Harry chuckled, "remind me not to try and do all the Weasley's in one day next year."
Shockingly, Draco looked like he was struggling to not burst out into painful sobs. Harry saw him wobble, frozen in place in fear of crumbling before his ex-rival, and then he muttered through clenched teeth, “I made bad choices.”
“Harry...” Draco knew that he couldn’t say no to Harry, that the raven-haired man was determined to do this, but not only was he concern for Harry’s mental state, the memories Harry wanted to show Silas wouldn’t be great for him either. He had his own scars from the war, his own demons, and he was also wondering if something of that magnitude should even be shown to a child. Harry seemed to read his thoughts though.
She twangs at his smart robes.
-Draco twists one of Harry's short hair locks in is fingers.
Miss Payne looked nervously between her head of house and her Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. “It’s nothing. I-I thought I’d made a mistake with the potion I was brewing and d-didn’t want to disappoint Professor Malfoy. I-I thought he would be angry at me.”
“How were lessons today. You have two classes to teach on Fridays, right?” Draco asked.
“What for?” Harry was bewildered. There was nothing concrete to hold against the boy, and therefore no point in reporting Mr Silas Avery to the Aurors department.
“Blue sir.” Miss Payne answered confidently.
Chaos! That’s what Harry would call it. His Gryffindor students were a force to be reckoned with that late morning. Students missing, students forgetting things, students pranking others and more interesting in chatting then packing. It was a miracle that they all made it to Hogsmeade in time to board the bloody train.
“The elves got the chocolate right at least.” Said Draco, taking another muffin.
“Damn!” Harry winced awake. He rubbed his sore cheek and noes, before sitting up and rubbing at his tired eyes. He wasn’t ashamed of his fantasies, rather, he was embarrassed at himself for starting to become attracted to an imaginary figure. He didn’t know Tau outside of the parchment, and his appearance had so much range of possibility within blond hair and grey eye that he could look like… well, anything. He blamed his fantasies on the work load, and the fact that Tau had also been on his mind a lot, so it was no wonder his mind was conjuring up unhelpful reminders of his total lack of romantic or sexual aspects in his life.
“I used to.” Harry admitted. “They helped me as much as they could. I was discharged. Unless I get worse or something new happens, there’s nothing more they can do for me anymore.”
Harry called for Kreacher, asking him politely for a glass of water. Kreacher complied to his masters wishes quickly, and Harry downed half the glass in one before placing what remained on his bed side table.
“Very well Master, I’ll be doing that now.” And Kreacher left with another ‘crack’.
Draco: "It was weird. It was the past but I was watching - *Draco rubbed his arm subconsciously staring at his tea.* HE, he burnt the mark into my arm just like before, I watched my self scream. It changed. I watch myself torture-. I begged myself to stop doing it, to stand up to him, but i was invisible. Volder ... he laughed behind me - past me, non verbally reminding me of my punishment if i didn't do what he commanded. Then a small hand took mine, a solid hand ... he looked like me only ... was about six. 'Don't watch!' He said, 'Let go play. No one came stop us now. Were happy when we play, don't you remember?' The screaming in front of me loud, and a younger me to my left trying to get me to follow him. Then the boy was gone, and Vold ... he, grabbed my shoulder and screamed in my face. A snake come ... coming from his mouth ... a-and his eyes red and evil. Right in my face. I woke up then."
-Harry writing on his charmed parchment: 'Monday?'
“But… Potter… You-”
“It looks to be in order. I’ll read it over later and start the copy. Is your mother doing okay?” Harry asked, being polite. A part of him kept whispering that Narcissa could become something of a mother in law to him if Draco didn’t kill him first for being Padfoot. Draco still hadn’t asked Padfoot to meet, and Harry was a nervous wreck every time he received a new message on the Le’Amortentia parchment.
“Harry!” Draco said, a beaming smiling overcame his face. Harry was so kind, wonderful, safe. Harry would get him Pancakes!
house call.”
“I think you should hold your tongue Elroy! Can I call you that? Elroy.” Harry didn’t give the Auror a chance to respond, patting the man’s chest twice before continuing. “I’m sure you didn’t mean to break code forty-six of the Aurors conduct. I’m sure there’s no need for me to contact Dale with some pensive memories now is there?”
-Monday 16th November: Images of post Hogwarts Draco, being taught decorum etiquette.
“Why would I be aware of Mr Potter’s whereabouts?” Draco asked.
Draco chuckled as he stood. “Live in fear or hand out homework?” Draco asked, but he had a feeling that Harry’s sudden desire to leave was because he’d chosen Padfoot. He was sure that Harry had been trying to allude that he had feelings for him, and if that was the case, he’d rejected the man.
Draco seemed to speak to the room, like he was in a lecture or teaching a class. Harry
a squib?” Harry asked, trying not to laugh at how flustered he was making Draco again.
“What’s going on?” Madam Pomfrey asked, not waiting for an answer when she saw the blood on Draco’s left arm. She instantly rushed away to fetch the healing salve and a bandage.
Draco: "Ooooh."
Harry laughed out loud, "It's novelty, not so much for practicality but for… decoration, I guess. I guess some people just like their…" It was Harry's turn to whisper, "their genitals to change colour while they… you know." Harry tried to stifle his mirth so that they didn't draw attention to themselves, but Draco's face didn't make it easy. The glamoured blue eyes that looked at him were squinted in disgust, and a wrinkled noes told Harry Draco's opinion on the item. "It probably makes their bathroom look cool too." He shrugged as he chuckled.
“Draco!”
“What time is it?” Harry asked, but it was rhetorical as he checked his watch; 9:30am. As it was Christmas, and knowing that the children slept in late because of excitement preventing them from sleeping last night, and knowing how most children like to open all their Christmas gifts when they did wake up, breakfast was always held till late on December the 25
Ginny decided to tell her mother that I was sleeping with you.
No! If that were true, he could have had any man that promised loved and devotion - even if they were just after his fame. What if that was the problem though? This was the first man to like him and not know of his fame, and that right there was so appealing - being liked for who he was and not what he had done, or what the books and news had said he’d done anyway. He liked Tau, was sure it was mutual, and was sure they would have at least started a good friendship together if it didn’t lead to romance.
When the song ended, Harry didn't realize who's arms he was in for a moment, just that they felt so safe around him, and the smell was comforting. When he did realize, he pulled away quickly, realizing Draco now knew more about his life than anyone one else. All his bad memories, all his trials and tribulation, all his failures and mental scars. How could face Draco? How could he answer his questions or talk about it all? He just couldn't.
“Its at the back.” Draco pointed to the parchments he’d just given Harry.
“Perhaps we should bring this to Longbottom’s attention; her change in performance and behaviour could be affecting her other classes likewise?” Draco suggested. The girl maybe prone to
Draco: "Then I guess it's over!"
“Poppy! I need you to preform a spell that shows Miss Payne’s medical history for the last couple of years.”
He stood up abruptly, forgetting his company, and ran to the bathroom mirror. He had to see his reflection, had to know it was still him inside his own body. He had to
Harry smiled, relieved that Draco hadn’t shouted at him, but where was Draco’s sense of self-admiration or sarcastic retorts? He’d agreed with Harry that he had likable qualities – or else he would have denied his comment, but was it about Draco’s opportunity to playfully insult him, or was it insecurity that prevented the blond from being arrogant and confident about his self-worth. Harry would have expected Draco to pick apart his ‘some’ and insist he had more them
Harry pulled the blanket up to Draco’s neck, checking on the warming charms for the umpteenth time, and he was wondering if there was anything else he could do, when Draco sneezed… sneezed a bloody mini snow flurry that caused the blanket to literally freeze over solid!
Draco: "You feel like briefing me on the cause of your spectacular eruption, so I know what to expect should it happen agian. I like to be prepared."
The radio decided to intervene just then, with it's stupid golden light, and annoying music.
Silas’s eyes landed on him before he ambled out of the classroom, impertinently leaving the door open for Draco to close behind him. Draco swished his wand, sighing in frustration, then turned to Harry.
Draco was trying not to laugh, to him this story was golden.
"My age." He blurted, before quickly scraping to correct his thoughts and cover up his moment of inattention. "So, Thirty? I suppose ... twenty-eight to thirty-two would be okay." Harry answered.
-Bends Harry over a table instead, kissing his neck from behind.
Harry sighed in resignation and ran his fingers through his messy black hair. He knew he shouldn’t be so quick to think the worst but … it was Malfoy! Then again, it was ‘Draco’ now, and the blond hadn’t done anything so erroneous yet to make him act so defensive and cagey towards him. How was he to get to know Draco if he always reacted in the negative to him, if he was always so on guard and defensive? He forced himself back to a calm posture and decided that he’d have to trust him. If Harry wanted an amicable work relationship with him, trust had to go both ways.
-Sunday the 12th December - Ginny yelling at Harry in the courtyard, Harry grabs her hand and pulls her close to him to calm her down.
level classified. I need your word Draco, that what I’ve said and what I’m going to say doesn’t leave this house. I’ll need you take the oath of silence.”
A scared, tortured woman defiled and dangled above a table – bright green light blinded him – a snake consuming her lifeless body – the snap of bone - a splatter of blood, and the violating feelings of joy and achievement at ending her worthless life.
“Exactly! So, do we have a deal?”
Draco had been brought into the infirmary Sunday evening; it was now Tuesday morning. Harry had visited the man for hours yesterday, but Madam Pomfrey had given him a sleeping draught in the end because the man kept hallucinating and panicking – the calming draughts hadn’t helped either, and Draco kept getting out of bed. When he hadn’t been panicking, he had been complaining; Draco kept threatening to report them both to his father, and although Harry had chuckled, Madam Pomfrey was at the end of her tether – especially with the fluctuation of Draco’s acting age.
“I do not have to put up with this!” Draco said, standing up to make his leave.
A brown haired thirty-two-old man with green eyes, muggle born, with a passion for teaching magical children under eleven. Says he loves kids and wants his own family one day. His quote was – 'You can teach no one, only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn themselves.'
“DRA–” the door was suddenly thrown open, causing Harry to stumble mid knock, “…co.”
Blaise: "Hey Weasley! I think your little boyfriend might swing the other way!"
Harry looked up at Draco and couldn’t help but wonder what his angle was. Yes, they had a great evening last week - when they had both had a bit too much to drink, but Harry still wasn’t sure that Draco enjoyed his company. This would be the first time that Draco has asked for his company - and not Harry making the invitation, it was rather surprising really. A pleasant surprise actually – Harry decided, seeing as he had started to really enjoy Draco’s company, and he was learning to read the complex man.
“Not now Draco.” Harry pleaded, leaving the door open as he went back inside. He picked up his half mug of black coffee. “Why are you here? Minerva?” He asked, before downing the last of his caffeinated drink.
-Thursday 21st: Great Hall. Harry watches Draco with Pansy and Blaise, then gets into another heated discussion at the Gryffindor table regarding Draco.
“You need some socks.” Harry explained, finding them in the bottom draw of the chest of draws. “Here, let me put these on you.” Harry said, not waiting for an answer.
-Harry - watching the images and his boyfriend, takes Draco's left hand in comfort. Draco's eyes are glistening with the promise of silent tears.
“As I was saying…” Draco glided between the student tables as he spoke, not unlike that of one Professor Snape but with more elegance. “I expect you all to know how to create the Hiccoughing Solution by your next potion lesson. The potion takes precisely forty-three minutes to make – if you are competent, and seeing as your next lesson with me is last period on Monday, anyone who fails to make the potion correctly will stay behind. I suggest you familiarise yourself with the process thoroughly, because there will not be time during the lesson. Any questions?”
-Levitates a jug of pumpkin juice to pour over Draco's head.
Harry pushes Draco away angrily, confused, and mad that he gave into Draco agian.
Harry’s mind was screaming as the pieces of the puzzle slotted into place. The girl’s words – ‘do worse to me’, the fact she bolted from the potions room when Silas entered it… he needed Poppy to do a medical scan.
Maybe he was overreacting because he was tired and hadn't eaten since breakfast, but Malfoy was a prat! A bothersome blond bastard who was taking over for Professor Stoltion. Amelia Stoltion had decided that she wanted to stay home after the birth of her first child, born just as the summer holidays had started – in June. She had only been a teacher at the school for two years, and now he had to work with Malfoy - who obviously hadn't changed at all despite his change of appearance.
Samuel looked surprised for a second, that the head of Gryffindor believed him so easily perhaps, but he regained his composure very quickly. “I asked Monero to ‘please pass the steak and kidney pie’. After taking what I wanted they did look a bit suspicious, but I just thought they were being strange. I then noticed something a bit chewy in my pie, and it was then that Monero and Cray started laughing. I went to ask what was so funny and…”
"Volant brooms?" The young male shop assistant asked them when it was their turn to be served. He looked uneasy, and he'd obviously overheard Harry mentioning them.
What the fuck? Looking up and down the table in hopes it had just been moved, he soon caught Harry’s pointed look and folded arms. His disappointment turned to anger at the injustice.
Malfoy had a strange look in his eyes then, and if Harry didn't know any better, he'd swear there was actual remorse there. Seeing as Malfoy didn't say anything more, Harry turned and left in a huff. He didn't need to start fights or confrontations with his old school rival, the fact was, they weren't students anymore. It didn't stop the blond prat making him feel like a bloody student again though.
“Thanks—” Harry drawled bitterly, removing the charm on his top canines. He felt rather stupid now to be honest. “Did you just come to insult my costume or-”
"You're not the first, and you won't be the last Mr Potter. Pushy, we-have-your-best-interests-at-heart friends, are the most common reason for nervous, hesitant customers. However, your voucher was purchased under a name not your own, and I may or may not remember the people who came and purchased it for one Mr Potter." She winked at him and smiled. "Says here you have the full secret parchment service. I'm not surprised. I am assuming your friends recognised the needs to keep your renowned name from influencing any potential suitors."
“You know what I did to her Potter. The things I made her do under the Imperius Curse. I never meant for Katie – for Weasley – for… I never wanted to hurt-”
Harry wanted to help Draco before he had a chance to snap on any more masks, and before Draco’s pain ebbed enough to bring him back to his senses.
-Harry then punches the boy in the face, making him fall into the wall.
“If it’s a childhood virus, then why is it affecting him now?” Harry asked, there would always be parts of the wizarding world that eluded him, parts that he had yet to learn about.
D.Malfoy.'
“Miss Prescott!” Draco’s voice of annoyance was laced with a cold disappointment, and the entire table went silent.
Ron whined to Draco - making him chuckled. This was his new friendship with Ron - playful insults and ... perfect, but he didn't respond seeing Harry was creeping him out a bit.
method of communication – and not just speech: writing, sigh language, and Legilimency for example.
However, what Tau said also seemed to make sense – that it wasn’t time that reminded him of the past, it was in fact memories trigged by something or another. The summer heat - especially near gardens, always reminded him of the long hours he’d spent weeding his Aunt’s garden, the fact he’d had to return to them at all, and the remaindered that it was the summer holiday after his fifth year that he mourned for his Godfathers murder alone. Halloween in August, always reminded him of the day his parents died and he became an orphan. May day always reminded him of the battle of Hogwarts, and the day he lost many people to the war. Even though it was a particular time of year that reminded him of these things usually, it wasn’t time itself doing the reminding.

life on display.
“No! Not really…” A few seconds of silence passed before Samuel continued. “I heard how wonderful Christmas is at Hogwarts, and I choose to stay for the experience, but … I was shocked that I ended up being the only first year… everyone else is third year or up.”
They were outside in the snow; most of the students had begged for outside activities that evening before bed – finishing their snowmen and having snowball fights. They would be sent in at half past eight, so they could bath or shower, and then wind down for the night in their common rooms. Minerva had sent Filius, Neville, Draco and Harry to supervise the outside students – all eighteen of them.
Harry drunk his coffee now that it had cooled down, and waited to see if Tau would reply. He had things to do before the day ended, and he had work to mark. Once he’d tipped back the last sip of his drink, he decided to come back to the parchment later.
I can't drag your soul to shore
Draco grabbed Harry's arms to stop him from wearing a hole in the carpet, and suddenly he was facing desperate, pleading green eyes. Without the glamours … fuck! Why the fuck did Potter have such attractive eyes!
He’d realised though, on the way down to his private room, with Harry there to make sure he was safe, that he couldn’t start a relationship that wasn’t true. If he didn’t feel for Padfoot what he felt for Harry – and, he scoffed, that was bloody unlikely – then he would have to settle for at least second best. His heart would always belong to another, and his relationship would be unfair to Padfoot. He couldn’t do that!
been demanding better treatment beforehand.
“It’s to be expected. Now drink this one as well, it will help with the pain.” Poppy said, shoving another vial into his hand. “It’s good to have you back.” She admitted. “Ah, Harry! Right on time. He’s free to go.”
When all you wanna be is lost
Draco jumped, realising that everyone who had yet to do so were now pulling their Christmas crackers.
Moving images/memories, of himself with his father, start to play just outside the window.
Draco: "I'm totally, completely, and elegantly of course ... shitting myself!"
-Draco guides Harry out, and back into him.
“Confiscated it.” Harry corrected smoothly. “A teacher is allowed to confiscate a students wand if he or she deems in necessary for the safety of the other students.”
“I’ve given her a calming draught. She won’t tell me what happened.” Madam Pomfrey said.
Harry laughed, causing Draco to raise both his eyebrows.  Harry almost dropped his plate, having to sat it down while tried to stop laughing.
Harry cleared Tau's message with the Othala rune and his quill feather. He felt a bit alexithymic in that he knew he was feeling a range of positive, almost excited emotions, but couldn't identify them singularly. He rubbed the feather against his chin, thinking of how to reply before staring to write.
Harry instantly saw the accusing look McGonagall was directing at Draco, and it didn't sit right with him. Before Draco could dispute her accusation, Harry beat him to it.
Harry noticed the foot returning to its normal colour as he slid the sock onto it, and after placing one onto the other foot, he added a heating charm to them before returning the blanket.
Harry smiled at the last few students now watching him and Draco with frowns. Draco caught on and did the same. Harry motioned them to hurry up before the train left without them, they were the last students left to board thankfully.
“Sorry, what did you say?” Harry asked, looking into concerned grey eyes.
Draco: "I still think this is too risky. People like them can't be trusted."
Draco stood there being essentially admonished by Harry. Moving images started to appear around them like fog at first - getting clearer as the song starts.
“What’s going on?” Harry asked, reaching Draco’s bed. He put his bag onto the floor, along with the box he had been carrying.
“What – what’s wrong?” Harry panted, eyes roaming every inch of Draco’s body to check for injury or distress.
Shaking her head as she returned to her office and private chamber, she thought back to the 1990’s – the fierce rivalry between Harry and Draco was almost iconic, but now look at them … who would have guessed it?
-24th September 9pm, Harry and Draco shouting in the eight year common room.
The sounds of shoes clicking into the room turned his head, and a middle age woman wearing ... a purple and black medieval dress, walked into the room smiling joyfully. Harry suddenly felt like she wanted to play with him. Her crazy black curly hair - half clipped up, came down to her waist. She wore big purple love-heart reading glasses, and purple gem earrings.
Harry wrote down the new instructions, but he ignored Draco's last comment. Then, he cautiously proceeded to do as he'd explained. For some reason he trusted Draco, but Ron didn't.
Yes, Draco had talked, or in this case, written his ears off last night. He’d already heard all about wizarding traditions – yuletide and winter solstice, seeing as Draco had educated him about it until the early hours of the morning. He knew exactly what that poem meant:
“I think … I think that he is right. I think that once we were all on your team, we should have attacked instead of goaded Mr Malfoy. Or, we should have at least used that time to strengthen our shields and defences. Only a few us were needed to take down Mr Malfoy, Lilium and Josephine, the rest of us could have stayed behind barricades or shields and acted as back up.”
It made Harry wonder, was Tau relating to this book on a deeper level then he initially thought?
“Perhaps you’re right. It is getting late.” Harry slurred slightly, wobbling as he stood to see Draco out. “I had fun tonight Draco.” Harry smiled.
for Merlin's sake! You have to understand, my reactions are fundamentally attributed to my upbringing by a useless cunt of a father. I was psychologically conditioned,  indoctrinated, brainwashed! I've grown up with the belief that a Malfoy must never show their emotions, among a shit ton of others. It's second nature to me now, you see? It's like
“I don’t know exactly.” Harry admitted, rubbing the back of neck. “Hermione has already questioned and tested me to death, and she thinks that my hatred of the house – its darkness, and depressing smog if you like, pissed me off so much that during my rage, I somehow got my wish to be rid of it. I was just happy to know that I wouldn’t go mad living here. After that, the house was easier to clean and decorate. I didn’t get my job at the school for a few months, so I spent all my free time on the house. I discovered that I get bored siting on my butt all day, so I got right into it and obliterated the place.” Harry shook his head and smiled at a memory. “I remember inviting the Weasleys over for dinner after I did the first two floors; Molly wasn’t sure it would be a good idea – said it would be safer to go to them, everyone else dragged their feet over, but once they got here… I swear it took an hour to pick up their jaws off the floor.”
"Well, I'll see you tomorrow." Draco said, making his way to the door to let himself out.
“Mother finalised the draft for you.” Draco said, handing Harry over the small wad of parchment. “If you agree with everything this time, then you only need to copy and sign it, and then send it into the Department of Magical Law Enforcement – Family relations department.”
“Draco, I’ll be right back okay. You just … stay there…” Harry frowned down at the crying man, bewildered and deeply concerned. He left the room in a hurry, intending to fetch Madam Pomfrey as quickly as possible.
When he returned to his classroom, a cold shiver ran down his spine when he observed the cold smirk that Silas wore on his face – it was there for just a second before it morphed into a sneer of hatred, but it had definitely been there.
“You can’t hide forever Mr Malfoy!” Harry goaded, bouncing a red snowball in his hand.
Harry’s grin grew into a knowing look as he decided what he wanted. He could feel the curiosity now radiating from Draco’s body, burning away at his pompous posture and restrained facial expressions.
“You understand
It was a short reply, but Harry wondered if was too obvious. No! He decided, Tau had admitted his weakness for chocolate many times, so that was something he would normally reply… right?
Draco eventually went back to Hogwarts. His arm had stopped bleeding, and it was sore, but he didn't give a shit as he climbed into bed that night.
Harry: "That! You create problems when there isn't any, and insist on being a prick when I'm just trying to put the past behind us. Can't we just be friends for once, instead of hating each other?"
For now, he would continue with his quill and parchment, and continue to crush on the illusion he was painting in his mind - it was such a splendid and delicious illusion.
likable qualities.
-Harry stares at Draco like he is edible, while Draco sings - dancing around with his two friends.
-Harry in his room wrapping present, writes Draco on everyone's parcel.
-Monday 18th, Herbology: Harry knocks into Draco on purpose making him drop his plant.
Harry turns to face Draco, his silver eyes the only solid ground he can find as the images continue to haunt him like bad dreams, cutting open his wounds held by together by thin tape.
-Draco casts 'Incendio' on the latest Prophet article about them, and the request for an interview.
“Sir, we have to get to Charms.” Gibson complained.
Blaise: "What's wrong with you?"
-Harry feeds Draco a bite of his toast, clearly making a point to his house mate.
Harry: "Me? I'm not the one going around singing shit ... or dragging people into storage rooms!"
“I will inform My Avery of his new schedule when he arrives tomorrow evening.” Draco concluded their ‘meeting’, handing a copy of the plan to Harry as he stood up.
“I’m okay Draco, really!” Harry repeated for the third time. He really didn’t want to discuss his mental instabilities. “I told you, it was just a bad flash back – a PTSD episode maybe. I haven’t had one in years, but this is why I try not to talk about past events.” Harry toyed with his mug, looking at the reflections on the porcelain surface. His episode had past, he just wanted to pretend it never happen really.
Harry chuckled and lowered his mug. “You really like this parchment person?”
They both started to open their respective gifts, slowly, sneaking glances at each other all the while. Harry was the first to reach his gift under paper, a few seconds before Draco in fact, and he frowned as he opened the lid to reveal a potion vial and what looked like a leather Lanyard.
“Draco! Draco, wait!” Harry grabbed Draco’s arm and spun him around. “If it makes you feel any better, I like men too.”
If this reporter knew anything about him, it should be the knowledge that he’d managed to get three reporters fired – one of them being Miss Rita Skeeter herself. It made big news when Rita lost her credibility, and if this man was at least half decent at his job then he would know this.
"Are you okay, Draco?" Harry suddenly asked.
His eyes roamed again, and he found himself tapping his foot as he became restless. Out of nowhere, flashes of a sexual nature invaded his mind, and a twitch bellow his waist made him shift back in the chair. Harry rubbed his eyes - chalking it up to boredom, and scratched his jaw line with the slight stubble. His attention was then stolen by the strange purple flowers near the windows - they sat in round terracotta vases, almost alluring in nature and seemed to move like a breeze on a hot day. Harry felt a little hot and had to restrain from fanning his face with the voucher. He fidgeted in his seat, aware of a growing tightness in his boxers, but he couldn't figure out why his body was acting so strangely.
Harry thought that he really did sound like Professor Severus Snape. Malfoy’s voice was cold, and the words drawled out angrily. Harry blinked, thinking about the man that once loved his mother – unrequitedly, and Malfoy’s angry words died on the wind unheard. Severus Snape was a link in a chain that resulted in his parent’s death, but was also a link in Voldemort’s down full, the cause of his own still beating heart today, and a brave man that lost his life after giving so much so much of it to aid in the war.
Harry frowned, knowing something was different. Draco was appearing cold and distance, and it hurt.
He watched as Draco finished the coffee, wondering where he would hide the parchment if he had one. A though then dawned on him – what if Draco wrote in his bedroom like he did?
“Your extremities – hands, feet, face, are going to feel really cold sometimes.”
"It educates the reader on the advancement of medical related tools and practices. Like this," Harry turned the book for Draco to see, "this is what they used to do in the middle ages." Harry pointed to the section that explained the process of cauterization – how they would burn a wound to prevent bleeding and infection.
“On Salazar’s honour?”
That was almost screaming at Harry, playing with his annoying need to help others, but it also resounded with his own lack of experience in love. The quote was intriguing, and his passion of nature and aesthetics sounded peaceful - a life Harry certainly needed after the tempest rage of his own past. What sealed the deal however, was the last question: What do you want the person reading this to know? The thirty-year-old blond had answered:
“A female colleague at the work…” Harry lied slowly, choosing his words carefully. “When I was doing my Auror training, she had that same parchment and quill Draco. It’s from Le’Amortentia isn’t it?” Harry asked, feigning innocence. His heart was still pounding from the overwhelming evidence. Draco was Tau!
Harry: "I ... I mean ... yes but ... its ... I ... oh fuck it!"
“I asked first!” Draco glared over his coffee mug.
“Yes. She is polite to all her customers, how else would she run a profitable business.”
"Ah, I see." Draco nodded… yes, he did indeed know that. It made sense now that he thought about it; many Brooms
Harry: "Really, it was just a too many things at once. Waking up with the reminder of death, being jinxed or whatever, Seamus, people judging you - us, and that fucking news article. I don't know Dray, my temper scares even myself. I once blew up, well ... inflated my muggle Aunt with accidental magic - Summer before third year, she floated away and had to be rescued by the ministry. Her memories were removed."
Draco: "We barely remember what we've done for the past two months - some of which I might remind you, is totally immoral and spurious ... yet you're worried about a useless holiday that started during the inferi wars of the 18th century."
-Images of Harry smiling, appear on the walls.
“She kindly handed the teenager over to
“Then Draco can view them with me!” Harry gave Draco a pleading, hopeful look.
Harry winced. “Nice of you to shit on my parade.” He muttered, suddenly making a mental note to research wizard history before choosing next year’s Halloween costume. It didn’t help that Halloween brought up bad memories for him, and he’d tried to make an effort every year for the sake of the students.
“To be truly cunning you need wisdom to pull it off, and there are many kinds of wisdom. It never hurts to know more than your adversaries, and it certainly helps when one wishes to be ambitious.” Draco told them. “Did you not wish to spend the night with your brother Mr Sayer?”
“I might have been better at it if a certain student hadn’t found amusement in sabotaging my work…” Harry smirked when Draco mocked offence at the insinuation. “…Or if my teacher at the time wasn’t an arse.”
Harry: "I tried Draco, but you just kept insulting me and my friends. I don't need this shit."
Harry chuckled. Draco was a prat, but he was his prat. Their lips met for round two of their overdue make out session.
Something is familiar
Childlike state? Childish…
“A letter.” Harry drawled cautiously, as if it was obvious but not wanting to annoy the man.
As he was pondering how Tau would take his little 'X', he saw a new message come through on his parchment.
Draco stopped walking to scowl at Harry, he seemed to be mulling over what he’d just said, but then Draco growled and stropped off again. Harry sighed and followed him.
If it wasn’t for the fact that Minerva and Poppy had been into see the man last night, and had assured him that the potions teacher was just fine, then he would have broken the bloody door down in fear of Draco being hurt or what not.
“Stay here Mr Leonard! We need to ask you what happened.” Harry explain to the distraught looking fifth year Gryffindor, un-sticking him from the floor once he’d placed a hand on his shoulder. He shared a quick look at Flitwick, who nodded and climbed up onto one of the small round tables dotted around the room.
Baby, I'm in control
“Okay class, remember we will be working on shield charms next week. I want you all to practise the protego charm if you cannot already cast it competently. I will be here Mondays and Wednesdays as you know, three till five. I also expect everyone to research a shield charm - other than the protego charm, and have it ready for our next lesson. I expect at least twelve inches on your chosen shield…” He then turned and pointed to a brown-haired male student with the Gryffindor tie. “…Normal size writing Mathews.”
Harry summoned a muggle notebook and pen, and began writing down the oath of silence. He’d finished before Draco returned, but sat there patiently waiting – thinking about Horcruxes and souls, things he’d hoped never to explain nor think about again.
Without looking up, Draco voiced his fears. “I can’t – I can’t face her. I can’t look at her and see the terror in her eyes or the – I just couldn’t-” Fear of crying, of showing his weakness, halted his words. Harry saw a single tear fall from Draco’s bowed head, and it landed with a plop into the coffee mug. “I though I could- I thought-” Draco got up from the table to leave the room, but Harry was faster.
The parchment that Poppy had linked to the spell, started listing the girl’s injuries and illnesses. Poppy ended the spell when she had two years’ worth of data. She sighed, returning her wand to its holster before reading the parchment. She had no idea what she was supposed to be looking for – the girl had a short list, minor injuries, flu, a slight cough…
The 3rd of January couldn't have come fast enough for Harry. Draco had spent two nights at his house - and they had been an amazing three days, but Harry had to get back to the Burrow, and Draco had to get back to Hogwarts. They had parted ways with the plan to meet on the train to Hogwarts- in the storage carriage at twelve o'clock, but in the meantime they had their enchanted parchment to communicate.
“For all he hated me, he wasn’t happy when he realised that I had to die. I don’t think he did hate me though - not really. He hated the fact that half of me came from James, yes, and he expected me to act like my father, but he couldn’t completely avoid the half that was my mother. I also think that a lot of it was a cover. He had to show me a great dislike because he knew that Snake-face would return at some point. If dear old Tom looked into Severus’s mind, well, it had to be believable.”
-Blaise goes back to Harry, like he is explaining the situation while singing. Gesticulating with his words.
“Merlin forbid if I were, and you were to find out about it Miss Zabini. But no, unfortunately. Thank-you for alerting me to your arrival, and no, never boring Mr Anderson.” He smiled at his students as he walked around his desk. “I trust you all had a great summer vacation, it’s good to see you all back for your second year.”
-Sunday 17th, Draco shoves past Harry roughly, making him drop his books.
“You can ask Kreacher if you like.” Harry said, wondering how this had turned onto his own eating habits.
“You won’t get front row seats if you end up in the infirmary.” Said Harry, as he helped himself to the Halloween punch now that he’d finished his checks.
unwell, he’d wanted to do very illicit things to the delectable body that lay hidden beneath the clothes… wanted to kiss the man into yielding to him... into forgetting about Padfoot and just choosing him instead.
So, this obviously wasn’t the first time Poppy had informed him of his illness, but he didn’t remember that … in fact he didn’t even remember how he’d gotten to the hospital wing in the first place. Losing one’s memory, was never a comforting thought, but perhaps his brain fog would abate once he’d had time to wake up properly.
-Tuesday 5th November. Harry breaks into Draco bedroom before breakfast, and pins a topless Draco against the wall. Lust in both their eyes.
Blond haired twenty-nine-year-old man with blue eyes, half- blood, with a passion for family, friends, and fun. His life goal was similar to Harry's, but he also wanted to make a different to people that struggled financially. His quote was – 'Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.'
His mind chastised in Draco’s voice.
Without further ado, welcome to chapter one,
-Thursday 26th November: Images of the war, of wounded or dead people.
Harry would give his honest opinion, but he chose his words carefully. He felt as if he was being tested in a way, and he didn’t want to say something that would offend or upset Tau.
“As your ‘defence against the dark arts’ teacher, did you learn anything?”
He thought. Maybe he could do some research and- No! That was against the rules of Le'Amortentia. He'd signed to promise that he would not actively try and find information on his Chérie that could lead to the discovery of his identity or address. It still itched inside him to break the rules, but that would also be a betrayal of trust. Not to mention that, now he'd signed to say he would do no such thing, he'd be fined and charged with stalking and misuse of date.
Harry runs from the bathroom, the memories to painful. Draco chases after him.
Harry was suddenly overcome with how strange this was, that he was tucking a grown man into bed – a grown man that he had feelings for. Draco was also acting so strange, delirious, delusional…  and even though Harry knew it was the Snowflu at least, it was still weird to see the man acting like this. It didn’t help that Harry was clueless on how to help, that his emotions were swirling in a confused manner, and that he was worried… scared really. Yes, he was scared! Scared that Draco’s symptoms were worse than they should be, or that the man was getting worse, or that he was developing symptoms that he shouldn’t be. Even so, he managed to outwardly remain calm – thank Merlin, trying to do his best as he prayed that Poppy would hurry back – he needed to be assured that Draco was okay.
“Then why don’t you meet him?” Harry asked. It was the one thing he’d been waiting for – for Tau to ask if they could meet. It scared him though, oh how it terrified him that Draco would turn him away once he knew the truth.
“What time is it?” Harry mumbled, rubbing his eyes behind his glasses; he hated falling asleep in his glasses, they either ended up bent or broken, or they left marks on his face, but luckily, they seemed fine this time around.
Draco: "You didn't fail anyone Harry. You can't save everyone, and no one expected you too."
Harry waved his hand and a bag of owl treats came flying into the kitchen. He handed the owl a few, watching it eat them happily before flying away. As soon as it had left, he un-shrunk the package with his wand and instantly noticed it was from Le'Amortentia.
“I will… but why me? Why didn’t you call Neville, or even Minerva?” Harry asked.
Harry: "Oh, I suppose that makes it alright then."
Harry was sat in his private chambers - marking homework assignment at the small kitchen table, when he heard the door knock. It was about half two in the afternoon; he hadn’t been expecting anyone.
“Yeah, warm!” Harry insisted, not sure if he wanted to laugh, cry, or groan at the dazed look now on Draco’s face... it reminded him of Luna actually, but it had no business being on Draco’s face.
“That we do Harry. That we do indeed.” Minerva nodded
-Memory: First time in the storage room together in year 8.
It was in his bed as he tried to get comfortable, that he realised, Draco was pushing him away for some reason… but it wasn’t because the man regretted their friendship and blooming emotions for each other. Harry berated himself for the fool he’d been.
Mr Samuel Bartlett hesitated before nodding, afraid to open his mouth.
“Yeah.” Harry nodded. “But he didn’t know what Tom wanted with that information, and he meant no ill intent, even warning Riddle how dark they were. He was horrified when Riddle asked the possibility of making seven.”
“Hey! I brought the clothes you asked for.” Harry said, placing the black trousers, boxers, white shirt, and black robes onto the bed with the equally black shoes and socks. Why Draco insisted in looking like he was attending an important meeting all the time baffled him.
Harry: "Don't do that. Don't push the one person that is trying to be nice to you away."
“I’d say that you were insane. There is no way that-” Draco’s frown deepened. He suddenly caught Harry’s eyes and observed his facial expressions. “No way! Potter that’s … … Only you! I can’t believe this. Tell me everything!”
And tell me how
Harry then remembered he was a pure-blood.
Draco: "Green potter? You do know that Knotgrass was suppose to go in
Hermione had to go home for the holidays, but she would be joining them Boxing day - therefore, Ron and Harry were using 'apparition' to get to the Burrow - having received their licences before school started, and Ginny was going side along with Harry. When they arrived, that were suffocated by Molly, and sent to their rooms to unpack – Lunch would be at one o'clock.
Draco hesitated before nodding - he looked so beaten, so exhausted, and Harry knew that this moment of total surrender wouldn’t last, but It would only take one student or teacher to exit the school in search of fresh air, and they would be spotted – this important moment of healing for Draco would then be over. In fact, it was a miracle they hadn’t already been seen.
Draco had jumped at first, he found her enthusiasm unsettling, and her mumbling wasn't very reassuring. She was batty, strange, and smelt like butter, basil, and incense.
Harry’s second year Slytherin and Gryffindor class were due soon, but he found himself sat at the teacher’s desk staring at the magical parchment with the purple quill in his hand.
I were to like someone it is none of your business Potter! I demand you change the subject!” Draco hid his embarrassment behind the action of drinking his own coffee.
Draco, along with two Slytherins, where currently hiding inside a charmed fort of snow with green snowballs – whispering to each other.
“What I did for old master Regulus when he was five.” Kreacher said, and Harry’s head snapped to face him.
Harry got his great grey owl - Lilsiv, to deliver his letter to Malfoy. She was a smart owl, and she had managed to deliver letters to staff members in the dungeon before. Lilsiv was also feisty and stubborn, and he briefly wondered what Malfoy would make of her.
“No one was supposed to know anything about them, the ministry had destroyed all books on the subject. Tom learnt of them when he was at school, through Slughorn of all people.”
Draco slammed the door behind him, telling himself that he did not see Potter’s perfect green eyes turn glossy!
At risk of a spoiler, I wish to warn my dear readers that this chapter contains a scene where Draco scratches himself rather harshly. It falls under self harm, but for Draco, it isn't really intended as self-harm. Please ask if you need more info. And comment if you liked the chapter. XD
He would just have to keep denying his feelings though; he was no good for Harry fucking Potter, and he didn't know how to love anymore - maybe he never did. He was selfish, focused on self-preservation, and after so many people had shit on his trust - betrayed his loyalty to them, he just couldn't be relationship materiel.
-Mentions of post traumatic stress disorder - PTSD.
“I’m sure you have some likeable qualities Draco, or else, I must be mad to enjoy your company.” Said Harry, bravely daring to step into what could be dangerous ground with Draco. Harry knew the blond wouldn’t accept pity, but he had no idea how he would react to his backhanded compliment.
-Monday, 15th October, in the courtyard at night. Draco stares into Harry's bright green eyes pleadingly.
If you find yourself bored, I suppose I could take the time from my very busy Christmas schedule - to meet you in Hogsmeade.
-Harry now looking at a Green Slytherin themed notebooks.
was. They weren't quite friends yet, but it wouldn't take much. A few moments like this, the right words ... and Harry could see them getting close ...
He thought.
Kreacher returned shortly after leaving, and Harry practically inhaled the first half of his ham, tomato and lettuce sandwich. Hunger wasn't something that usually bothered him all that much, but he could imagine the bread was a certain blond Slytherin's head at least - and he'd only had a piece of toast that morning after forgoing dinner last night.
It was a mantra that he couldn’t shake as he waiting for Draco to open the door, but he had to remember that he was here for a reason. He was ready to uncover the irrefutable truth if he could.
“The Snowflu?” Draco repeated.
Hermione: "What's brought all this on Harry? I'm all for inner-house unity but this is Malfoy we're talking about."
“I know! But I have to.” Harry nodded to assure himself that he could do this. He wasn’t looking forward to seeing his memories of the war, but if he could save a teenager from a life in prison… he had to try.
“NO!” Harry almost shouted, the words blurting out before he’d even had a chance to consider Draco’s question. He didn’t have time to wonder why he felt so strongly about that, because he was already trying to fix his mistake. “I mean, n-no you’re fine. This is nice. I mean, it’s strange that we’re here sharing coffee and not about to hex each other, but … it’s pleasant.” Harry gesticulated and then held his breath, offering a small smile and hoping the blond wouldn’t run off.
Harry had forgotten one of the most important rules of battle… Never let your guard down until the last opponent is taken out! Smirking when Harry looked at him in surprise, he realised he didn’t need to win this – he’d just needed to hit stupid Potter. Now however, his smugness was turning to anxiety as Harry moved closer to him with a smirk of his own.
“I find strange things fascinating. Your mind haze episodes are strange and fascinating. My questions simply allow me to get to know you better, but if it bothers you so much, I suggest you simply request a change of subject.”
“My – My…” Harry tried to speak, pointing up at the bathroom cabinet. The visions where fading, but his breathing was so erratic that vertigo was settling in dangerously. The pain threatened to undo years of therapy, and he was humiliated to be caught in this state by anyone let alone Draco Malfoy.
“You were my school rival. I had to know everything about you.” Draco said, as if it was obvious and not kind of creepy.
When the music stopped, they both scurried to find out the date and time. Mostly relieved that it was only the next day - albeit 8pm, they were still annoyed with the curse they were under. Before Harry could say anything, Draco had his eyebrows frowned in thought. Draco looked up at Harry - obviously confused, and innocently asked ...
“I’m sure she’d have found a way to contact us had she needed to. Still, I think I’ll avoid her for a few days to be sure.” Draco said, brushing himself down.
“Unless your father knows how to brew a potion that doesn’t exist yet, I feel your efforts will be in vain.” She replied, deciding not to mention his father’s imprisonment – Draco was confused right now, so that news would not go over well at all.
And I can't hold on much more
dressed, if you could call it that, but it looked as if he’d been dressed by a three-year-old. In fact, no! He’d seen three-year-olds dress better. It also appeared that Harry hadn’t gotten much sleep, if the redness of his half-closed eyes were anything to go by.
“Miss Payne!” He called after her, running into the corridor. He’d have chased after her, but with a curse on the tip of his tongue, he remembered Mr Avery.
He left the parchment out as he climbed under the covers, and he checked it one last time before his eyes closed. If he wasn’t so tired, he might have laid there thinking for hours, but the fatigue quickly ensured that Friday September the 3
Ron: "And you look for his good do ya. Ha! Good luck there!"
Have you ever felt like a minuscule dot, even though you are surrounded by a world of people?
Harry: "What, you want to?"
-Harry gets free and walks down the street.
“That’s good to hear. Sit Elroy, didn’t we have something of importance to discuss. Not that I don’t enjoy our little conversations, but I’m sure we all have important things to get back to. I would hate to keep you longer than necessary.” Harry pointed at the empty chair.
Ginny sits next to Harry at the table and is all over him.
- Harry and Draco cooking for visitors.
Harry sighed on the other side, alone in the cold dungeon corridor. He wanted to bang his head against the wall, but instead, he forced his feet to start moving back to his own room.
Blaise. "You know the first one is only mandatory right. Please whatever old hag is assessing you, and she won't write you up for more sessions. Pansy wasn't asked to go back, but I hear Long bottom cried!"
He was alone this year, but it was something of a comfort to know that Harry would be staying at Hogwarts likewise. He would have company, and he had Padfoot to talk with. He still hadn’t asked Padfoot to meet with him, and although he wanted to, he was still afraid. Would Padfoot even agree to the meeting?
Harry: "It's only been about thirty minutes thank Merlin. What did you ... erm. Do you remember ...."
“Then she just - she just - - What’s wrong with her?” He finally demanded.
Harry had caved to Draco scent, given into his hypnotic aroma and reciprocated the kiss. As soon as they parted however, Harry was confused and angry. He wanted Draco, but Draco would never change. He couldn't keep playing these messed up, ludicrous, fucking games with him ... and, Ginny was safe, consistent, and perfect for him - right?
“Oh, come on sir! It’s our first defense against the dark arts lesson of the year.”
-Draco's reply on the parchment: 'I thought you'd never ask Potter.'
Thank you so much if you made it this far. Oh my, this has been so fun to write; a bit silly and crazy but i enjoyed doing it. Please let me know what you think In the comments.
“This doesn’t leave the house!” Harry stressed, taking a sip of liquid courage. “What I have to say is classified –
Harry fought hard to pay attention as Kreacher continued... fought to listen, unless he wished to sink into the past.
"Mm hmm," Harry agreed through the last of his coffee. "If you see something else that you think is good then grab that too … you sure this is okay though Draco? I'm sure that–"
So, Thank-you! Thank-you all so very very much.
“Damn you Potter!” Draco complained, shaking his head as he quickly regained his ‘Malfoy’ composure. “How on earth do I remind you of him?”
-In a fury of longing, wanton, and craving, their lips met violently.
Harry: "Cut the fucking bullshit Malfoy, I'm trying here!"
Oceans in your mind
To have his memories played out like that though, Harry must be feeling so violated and sick. Draco hated it when Voldemort breached his mind, he could imagine how Harry felt. He would be livid, and humiliated if it had been
“But I don’t wanna go to bed.” Draco’s sleepy voice sounded so childish. Well, Harry thought… that would be the childlike symptoms.
The thought of Draco not accepting him cut deep, and that told him all he needed to know. He had started falling for Draco bloody Malfoy. It wasn’t a possibility any longer, it was happening.
Draco: "I think that radio is cursed or something. Where is it?"
-His hand roam up under Harry's shirt, Harry grabbing onto the desk tightly. Draco hands start undoing Harry's trousers.
The bloody, blond-haired git had been declaring his very amorous feeling rather full-on over the last two days, or at least, strongly implying that he felt that was for
“Your mind wasn’t active while flying on a Volant 360 racing broom over the great lake?” Draco asked, one eyebrow lifted in barely masked incredulity.
He thought, as he looked in the bathroom mirror.
“I’ll give you ten seconds to come out guys… then we’ll melt your little fort to a puddle!” Harry called out, laughter ringing around him.
He'd been a huge fucking tosser over the years, he'd been a bastard, a cruel - heartless bully; he didn't know how to be anything else. Harry's world and his were so different, and he thought his was better ... until now. Thanks to his wonderful cock-sucking criminal of a father, and his mother who followed Lucius like lost puppy, Draco had been thrown under the night bus so to speak.
“Sit where ever!” Harry smiled, going to the whiskey. He lifted the bottle for Draco to see. “I can do coffee if you’d rather have something else.”
elaborate on the difficulty of Occlumency, and how he was good at it but could never have achieved that level of the skill - the level that Harry believed Severus to have achieved. They talked about Severus for a long while, getting through three more glasses of whiskey in the process. Eventually they moved on to what Draco had been doing in France for the many years he had been out of England.
Harry: "I'm going to meet Draco."
“Mr Potter! What brings you to Hogsmeade today? Can you tell me about your current association to ex Death Eater Draco Malfoy?” The lanky brown-hair reporter looked at him expectedly.
“My fault?” Harry asked, snorting at such welcome. “How do you figure?”
“Deletrius!” Harry said, ending the spell and looking back up at Draco. “The evidence is now in my memory. If it comes to it, they can use a pensive, but we only get one chance to save Silas from a life in Azkaban. I want to try and convince Silas that his beliefs are wrong… I have to try!”
“Take this!” Madam Pomfrey ordered, handing over a potion he didn’t recognise – which was strange, he was a potions master!
“Very well!” Minerva finally decided, much to Draco’s horror. “I’ll arrange for it to be done on the first Friday of the new term – Friday the seventh of January, after dinner, seven-thirty.” She turned to Draco. “Have Mr Silas Avery come with you to my office then.” She then turned back to Harry. “I do hope you know what you are doing Harry.”
I see before me a new horizon
Harry stopped walking, standing in front of Draco.
“Come in Mr Potter.” Draco moved aside and gestured him in. It was obvious that Draco was referring to him in the formality because they had an audience of students.  “I was just dismissing the class.  You can wait at my desk.” Draco pointed to his chair behind the teacher’s desk.
“Draco, ask yourself this,” Harry whispered, leaning over the table and trying not to laugh, “do you really want to interrupt Poppy’s Christmas because you foolishly got sick? She looks really happy right now, don’t you think?” He turned his head to surreptitiously look toward the healer before continuing. “Enjoying her food and taking a well-earned break – no one in her infirmary. And Minerva,” he flicked his eyes over to the headmistress, “do you really want to deal with her ire, today of all days…”
Tau’s family could have been followers, leading Tau to follow just as blindly. That would explain his strong opinion of Elliot blindly following Azorren, but it could also just be a matter of opinion. Tau could also feel that way simply because that’s what he believes, but again ... it just felt like a deeper reason.
idea. He had to get out of here to clear his head because… fuck! Potter was beginning to look like a dancing bar of luxurious chocolate, and his heart was in need of a serious scolding for its preposterous behaviour today.
I would really appreciate it if you would let me know what you think in the comments.
Draco: "You're a dork Potter. A Huffally-puffally Gryffindor, with a hero complex that means you always find fault in your own actions but never blame others. We both have issues, we both get angry. Life isn't always going to be a bouquet of flowers, and when it isn't ... we have to help each other, forgive each other, and accept that perfect is simply a myth."
The fact was he didn’t care. He didn’t care what Tau had done in his past. If he one day met up with him, and he really hope he did, he would find out the blond man’s history then. Tau was funny, sweet in his own way, arrogant defiantly, but so interesting and charismatic. He loved talking to the blond, loved trying to figure him out like a tricky puzzle.
Auror Graves gritted his teeth. “Not at all Mr Potter.”
Harry decided to try his luck first – it couldn’t hurt to ask, and he was probably stalling too if his was honest.  “Once I’ve told you - explained everything about the Horcruxes dear old Tom made, I’d like you to tell me what happened today at the Three Broomsticks. I think I may have some idea, but I want to hear it from you.”
-Wednesday the 2nd December: Draco approaches Harry, but Harry won't listen to him, or give into him agian.
Draco touches Harry's cheek tenderly.
"I would like a coffee please Kreacher, and maybe a sandwich. You know what, anything to eat would be great! If that's okay please." Harry asked, sighing. Kreacher nodded once more, and left the room with a slight pop.
Four minutes left.
“Yes. I remembered these from my stay in France,” Draco explained as Harry went to fetch it, “and I ordered you one. I do hope you don’t take it the wrong way, but if you don’t appreciate it or it offends you, I’d rather you just say so and I’ll send it back.”
No! Any relationship with Potter would only be a doomed; the media, the accusations that would be thrown his way, the ruin it would cause to Potter’s reputation… not to mention the attention it would cause – attention that Potter hated so vehemently, and that he-himself really didn’t need right now either…
– Harry’s brain supplied.
Blond hair, grey eyes, same height, same personality, same fears, same arrogance, same dating company, both purebloods, both had a weakness for chocolate … … and he went giddy at the knees for them both.
Draco sat up slowly - still deep in thought, but he was about to try and explain his past thirty minutes ramblings to Harry, when that poxy radio popped into existence.
Fuck!
“Alright then Harry, if you’re sure.” Draco stood up too, a small smile gracing his lips. “Let us get what we need, and then we shall enjoy the melody of nature.”
Maybe he
don’t really send gifts, and if they do, or if they send cards, they get redirected to Gringotts. As for the Weasleys, Molly’s letter was apologetic but the owls were worked into exhaustion this year and Ruffles, their family owl, couldn’t be expected to carry them all on his own so she just sent the jumper and mince pies along with the cards. Ron’s owl, Pigwidgeon, couldn’t carry the gifts on his own either, and he’s a bit clumsy.” Harry sighed again. “I really don’t know why they can’t just say the jumper and the mince pies are from the whole family, I really don’t need gifts from everyone separately.”
“It’s Halloween!” Harry decided. “I have Mr Haines saying he had nothing to do with it, and you two insisting he did.” Harry held up his hand to stop Cain butting in. “No mater your argument, I have two sides of the story. We can either debate this all night in my office, or, considering your property Miss Raines, is returned and intact, we can be mature and walk away – enjoying the rest of your day. What will it be?”
With a crack, the hills were once again left in solitude under the calm night sky. The wind caressed the grass back to shape, from where two teachers had once laid - releasing some of their long-carried burdens. Even the stars seemed to wink knowingly as the moon rose to guard the night.
Yes, his mother had mentioned a man – many times in fact, in her correspondence to him – and if he’d read the letter correctly, then he was certain she had been alluding to a growing relationship with one Valerius Cantrelle. One didn’t simply mention the same man twenty times between three letters, if one was only a regular to her shop. The fact he was so regular spoke volumes… perhaps he needed to pay his mother a visit and scoop out this Valerius!
Harry, once again nodded, wondering what she was about to ask him. His fingers twined together nervously, and he hoped it wouldn't be to embarrassing. Malaise started with the usually questions: names, address, and age for example - assuring him that this information was solely for Le'Amortentia's records and would remain secret and confidential to anyone else. Then she started asking other questions for his profile.
-Monday 23rd November: Draco nods enthusiastically.
Harry braced himself, wand at the ready as pure excitement took hold of him, and he too lost himself to the anticipation of this friendly battle. The snow flurry that Draco had caused, morphed into a small blizzard – one that blinded him from his opponent, but he wasn’t afraid or nervous... this would be fun!
He then felt Draco do the same, but he was so close that their arms brushed. His heart seemed to speed up a fraction as his breath halted, but Draco didn’t say anything.
Harry: "I'll listen, I promise I won't jump to conclusions. I'm sure it isn't that bad. I'll love you either way."
“I wasn’t snooping Draco! I simply glanced over at you as I was shutting the bathroom door. I just recognised what it was, that’s all!”
Harry: "You too Malfoy."
Harry turned to look in the direction of Hogwarts agian, and his face lit up with a big smile when he saw the tall, blond haired young man walking towards him in the deep snow - up the hill. Harry went to meet him half way.
Draco then sneezed a second time, catching Harry of guard… lucky however, Draco’s head bobbed towards his chest or Harry would have ended up with a frozen face. Unfortunately, however, Draco had just frozen his own Pyjama top!
I'm very pleased you wrote actually; it was a pleasant surprise and one I was not expecting. I am using my time here at Hogwarts to go over everything we have learnt so far this year, trying to remember those hazier areas of memory I have - thanks to a certain musical problem we have been subjected to. I spoke with Professor McGonagall today and she has come up empty to our predicament, and I wonder if she even bothered to be honest.
Ron: "I think you need help mate! You haven't stopped going on about giving that slimy git a second chance. I'd rather fuck a hippogriff to be honest."
“Don’t go!” Draco whined fearfully. “What if that C-Chimera comes back?”
“Come with me.” Harry gently ordered when the sobbing continued. “You don’t want to be seen like this; I know I wouldn’t.”
"Why not buy it for his birthday then…" Draco's voice tore Harry away from his thoughts, "wasn't he born in April?"
Draco ran his hand through his hair. He was worried this was some type of dark magic, and that he'd be blamed. He didn't want to give anyone an excused to send him to Azkaban - and he knew they'd welcome one.
Ron: "You two are like bloody rabbits, I should know, have loads of em outside the burrow."
-Draco and Harry smiling for the camera, for their photo in the news together.
“You made ridiculous animal noises?” Harry finished for him, to which Samuel nodded.
’ Harry’s brain insisted. It was just too unbelievable. Draco was nothing like Tau and-
“And what do
Are you with it?
“If I did, would he tell me that you eat three meals a day?” Draco asked pointedly.
"What is solar lightning?" Draco asked as they entered a large book store - Foyles.
“I am busy Potter, and I need to finish grading. I’m sure you have work to do likewise,” Draco walked over to the door and held it open, “don’t let me keep you.” Draco knew his words were cold, plain, and he knew they’d hurt Harry, but it was better for both of them this way.
him. He was right there! How rude of them! However, before he could express his feelings on that, he felt a wave of safety wash over him… Harry was here!
“I insist Draco! I won’t be able to live with myself if something happened.” Harry pleaded.
Harry ate in silence, watching the students as his duty as teacher, and wondering what pudding might be sent up tonight. Once the main course was finished, he found out: Double chocolate gateau, black forest gateau, ice-cream, and fruit salad bowls. He sighed … no treacle tarts.
"Broom?" Asked Draco, his frown framing blue eyes – strange against that foreign complexion, shortened chin, and dark brown hair. "Is he hoping to make the team then?"
Harry sniffed. He was refused to cry, the anger fading but he was getting tired of fighting to make them work. Draco would show his funny, brilliant true self, make Harry's heart skip a beat, then Draco would snap, put his walls back up, and crush his hopes of a relationship together.
he thought, pulling one out of the draws to join the black jeans now laid out on his bed … it was Christmas after all, and Molly would have sent him another knitted jumper.
He’d ended up sitting at the end of the table, next to Draco Malfoy, and as he’d sat down Minerva had leaned forwards and greeted him.
“Dark blue?” She bit her lip in thought. “Like a navy sort of colour sir.”
It worked! The snow on the ground froze like ice, and their opposition were momentarily shocked. In their haste to gain balance on the ice, and their laps of focus … it was on!
“Well don’t just stand there.” Draco said, taking a seat on one of his black leather, camel back sofas. He put down a wad of blank parchments, an ink pot, and a quill. “Sit down and tell me what you have in mind then.”
-Narcissa in Knockturn alley with Draco.
There was certainly no ‘both’ of them, just one! One gorgeous, charming, intelligent and funny man. A man with a tonne of good-humoured arrogance, an awkward way of expressing concern, and rare smile that could chase away the darkness inside him and brighten a room. A real man - with flaws, fears, doubts, issues and feelings just like himself.
He had to ask Padfoot to meet him! Had to do it
Blue light travelled from Draco’s wand to his throat, glowed, and then vanished as the spell took effect. Draco, literally could not even mutter the word Horcrux to another person now, even if he wanted to. The intention of the silencing oath would also prevent
Potter. My business is just that, mine!” Draco went silent for a moment; No, Harry Potter wasn’t an option… but Padfoot was! “Okay fine! So, what if I am?”
“Thanks.” Harry shivered.
Harry's eyes met steel grey one and sneered. Trust Malfoy to be a class A prat about a simple accident. "Expect you to understand that accidents happen Malfoy. To accept my apology and let it go without being a prat about it!"
Draco: "Come of it Potter. The whole damn school knows about it. You're not happy with Ginger, so why not just cut her loose?"
Harry questioned himself. If was ‘accidental’ then he wouldn’t technically be breaking any rules. Okay, so he
love with Potter! He refused to believe that his swirling stomach, sweating palms, and raised heart rate meant anything more than simply too much chocolate… and Harry had rudely taken away his yule log for crying out loud! Okay, that was a lame excuse, he’d admit it… and he’d even go as far to admit that he was grateful Potter hadn’t let him embarrass himself further… but… he just could not be with Potter! It wasn’t possible. It wasn’t logical…
Draco didn't mean to snap, and worse, Harry was now concerned.
“You don’t like Porridge?” Harry asked as he sat in the armchair that was still there for him.
“What’s wrong?” Harry frowned, instantly snapping out of his amusement.
Harry sighed in relief, watching Draco as he appeared to be sleeping… but then Draco’s breathy voice mumbled… “I think you’re won’erful!”
-Contains bad language.
-This story is corny, a bit fast paced, a bit illogical, might make no sense in some parts, and was made for fun only. (Please ask if you get confused at any time.)
Harry shook his head in disbelief. He made to leave - exasperated and hurt, but Draco grabbed his arm.
Draco took most of it in his stride, as long as he had Harry he couldn't let them affect their relationship - they were adults, and they would be free of Hogwarts in six months. Harry on the other hand was getting pissed of, and the tipping point came that Saturday morning.
They made there was to the door, exited into the cold corridor, and made their way to the Great Hall together.
Draco had taken a free catalogue from Argos, and he was still turning the pages in curiosity as they walked through London looking for a book store. Harry couldn't help but smile each time Draco asked another question.
be breaking the rules, but they’d not be able to prove it if it played his cards right.
Suddenly a puff of purple smoke rose from a cauldron over on the reception desk, and just like that, Malaise was holding parchment and reading over it while he tried to pull himself together.
-Images change to Draco's mother an father smiling at him.
He was very tempted to tell Tau about Malfoy. He wouldn’t use names of course, and he’d avoid mentioning anything to give away his own or Malfoy’s identity, but in the end … he decided there was no point in bringing that up. He would only sound like an idiot if he did, and he and Malfoy had far too much history to explain everything in a way that Tau would understand.
Ron: "Like you can, ya mean?"
He wasn’t satisfied though; he wanted more proof before he had to let go of his illusion of Tau. He’d said it before, but Tau was intoxicating and charismatic and wonderful, and he didn’t want to give that up. It felt like he was suddenly grieving for a man he’d never met, that reality was now knocking and he had no choice but to let Tau go.
“Are you laughing at me Potter?” Draco snapped, pouting slightly – Merlin, that pout almost made Harry laugh, especially with how foolish the man now sounded.
“Good. How is Kingsley by the way? He keeps trying to arrange a tea date, but you know how jobs go.” Harry winked at Draco as he took the chair next to the blond. Draco looked surprised, but at least he didn’t seem angry that Harry had intervened. Minerva looked much more relaxed now, her lips still twitching.
“You never cease to amaze me Potter. I must admit, I am curious now. How bad was this place? Surely it couldn’t have been that bad, having belonged to my mother’s family and all.”
actually up to something, but so was he.” Harry finished defensively, but he still chuckled.
“That’s the Slytherin boy with the long black hair right –- really pale skin, quiet, hardworking?” Harry asked, confirming the face to the name.
“Its fine Potter.” Draco rushed to explain. “I was just putting some stuff away.”
Harry kissed Draco agian, a peck, a tease - then he continued walking. It took a full three seconds before Draco hurried after him. Before Draco could say something clever, Harry spoke first.
“Y-Yeah that sounds like a good idea.” Draco played it off as if he’d finished book browsing and simply wanted to sit back down. “What about the secrecy though? What if someone over hears us, or you need your potions, or- What?”
practice casting your chosen shield unless you know
“Just leave!” Draco pointed with his index finger.
Draco: "It's me ... Draco. Can I come in, we need to talk; I think you're right, I think we need to see McGonagall."
Harry, having noticed the amount of snow in Draco’s hair and on his clothes from the dodge and roll, quickly cast the melting charm to turn it into water. Laughing at the look of horror on Draco’s face as the cold wet seeped thru his clothes, he didn’t have time to deflect the jinx sent his way that knocked him backwards into the snow.
-Harry takes Draco's hand as the others come over whooping. Harry and Draco get crushed in a group hug.
Hermione: "Just remember to reminded Mr Forthswrite, of the interview terms he signed before you start. If he asks either of you something against the agreement, simply bring it to his attention, then threaten to leave if he cannot adhere to the terms."
Ron whispered into Harry's ear angrily, making him turn to face Ron instead of Draco. He looked at their potion, it was green.
Saturday morning found Harry in his kitchen of number twelve Grimmauld Place, making coffee in his grey short sleeved pyjamas. It had been a week since he had been to Le'Amortentia, and he hadn't heard anything back yet. Perhaps the blond man had declined his request.
Before you sit down and watch *Coughs* read, 'Drarry and the magical muggle radio musical' I'd like to say a big thank you for giving this unusual musical-story a look (Even if you read no further than here). If you do plan to read on, then please take note of the following:
Harry’s head snapped up with a gasp - ‘oh fuck’ on the tip of his tongue. “Sorry.” Harry tried going for shameful instead, but Malfoy just looked like he wanted to strangle him.
It had been nearly two weeks since Harry punched that Ravenclaw student - luckily, Harry gotten in trouble nothing was even said. Suffice to say, not one Ravenclaw said anything to either of them since then.
“Draco! I’m not leaving this time,” Harry shouted, “we need to talk about our plans regarding Silas!”
It depends on the shade, purpose, location, and room. It's impossible to advise you on the most suitable decor, when I haven't even seen the property."
Harry dragged himself out of his thoughts, ready for a hot shower to start the long day. His first lesson started at 9:40am today – having no class first period, but it was already 8:20am so he needed to get a move on. He’d missed breakfast, but Kreacher could always bring him something later.
When he opened the door, a slightly ruffled Draco Malfoy stood there slightly breathless.
“I almost forgot you were head of Slytherin now.” Harry’s smile was brief before he shook his head. “McGonagall agreed with me that Silas wouldn’t be continuing with my classes, but Avery’s mother was particularly verbal and threatening. She threatened to report me to the ministry for unfair treatment of her son because his father was a death eater, accusing me of being prejudice and vindictive. Ever since then, Silas sneers at me when we cross paths. I fear the boy will grow up to be more vindictive than his mother claimed
“Be careful what you say Alex, I might think you’re being disrespectful.” Harry warned him with a half-smile.
“I have an idea. I’ll think about it over the holidays and make a list. Don’t worry about it now Draco.” Harry fixed together the coffees and returned to the armchair opposite Draco.
Harry: "Maybe I should've been more patient, but it's crazy Draco. I can't keep waiting for you to shut down on me, worrying if what I say will set you off again, or wondering if we really can work together as couple. I have my own issues too. I can't deal with all of this on and off, this were happy together and then we're arguing. I do want to be with you Draco, but not if you're going to shut down, take it out on me, and then storm off with an attitude every time something is wrong. Iv'e been fighting my whole life - I'm tired of fighting."
Harry looked over to where Reese was pointing, and sure enough there was an orange cup with pink lipstick around the top.
Harry now knew that someone close to Tau - his parents most likely, had expected Tau to following in their footsteps or to grow to be like them at least. If he’d read this correctly, then Tau’s parents held views that he later saw as flawed and depraved. It sounded like he was no longer on good terms with whoever he’d trusted before, and that break of trust had left him alone and scarred.
Yes, Draco had to concede. His mother had sent him an expensive robe that was more then suitable for potion masters to wear; it had charms to protect him against potion mishaps and fumes, and it was protected against staining – easy to clean. He was very grateful, and it did have an element of thought, but every year she gave him either that or dress robes. He wouldn’t mind something unexpected and … dare he say it… something more sentimental.
Chuckling on way back to the Great Hall, Harry remembered Tau’s lack of resistance to chocolate too. He wondered if it was a pure blood thing, but then he felt a phantom itch – as if he was missing something. His pace slowed as he came closer to the Great Hall doors, realising that Draco and Tau certainly had a few similarities. He’d had this train of thought before he realised – they were both pure bloods, both had a weakness for chocolate, both around the same age, and-
Draco hesitated only a moment longer, before finally sending it using the Mannaz shaped rune. It was done… now he just had to wait. In the meantime, he unfortunately had to return to work post haste; the students needed to be supervised and he would be missed if he remained absent any longer.
-Wednesday 23rd December, Writing Draco another letter, crossing out love hearts and re-writing it.
Standing up, Harry began to make his hasty retreat – before he suffered anymore of the angry healer’s wrath. It was true; he’d finally fallen asleep after tossing and turning in bed for ages – worried about a certain blond haired potions teacher, only to be woken up half an hour later by nightmares.
Oh yes, Harry thought with a smirk, he wouldn’t never let that memory of the blond go.
Yes, he could grant Tau’s promise.
“I’m sure he just caught a cold or something, he’ll be fine. I best go and check in with Madam Pomfrey however, I did tell her that I would meet her down there.”
Floating, carved pumpkins illuminated the Great Hall in autumn-orange light, and a charmed – almost sentient, cold breeze traversed the Hall - sweeping past Harry every few minutes as he checked the food and drink for contamination at the extravagant buffet table.
There on the parchment, dated Saturday the 26
Harry: "Okay, but what about me? What have I done?"
“Mr Potter!”
“Oh, of course Mr Potter, we have hundreds of vials but I suddenly feel the need to give myself extra work.” Madam Pomfrey sarcastically responded. “If you must know, we haven’t had a case of Snowflu for years. It is mostly a childhood virus, a virus only young children usually get, but still very rare.”
visited muggle towns since the war, for curiosities sake, but not enough to grow accustomed to the vehicles and unusual noises. A kid on a skateboard had nearly scared the magic out of him a while ago, speeding past within half an inch of his life, and jumping down the drop curb with a bang.
Harry nodded and looked at his watch - 11:40am, he stood up startling his friends.
I'm glad you're not suffocating under a tide of red hair; it would be a rather strange epitaph don't you think?
“You went somewhere didn’t you?” Draco asked, knowing that Harry had one of his mind haze episodes.
Harry now because he was
Harry shivered; it was exactly the same as Draco bloody Malfoy. He was sure Draco was about five-foot-nine too, because Harry was Five-foot-eight and Draco was about an inch taller than him.
The look Harry gave him was akin to a beaten puppy not understanding why its owner was abandoning it – Fuck! He turned his head, suddenly remembering the pain that had flashed in Harry’s eyes as they'd briefly discussed the memories they planned to use in the pensive with Mr Avery. That look was almost identical. Did his rejection really hurt Harry as much as the man’s past traumas did? Surely not! The man would get over him…
All the students work was sorted into boxes per class, and the boxes where then stored in the box room until needed. All the teachers’ rooms had a box room within their private chambers, a ‘box’ shaped room no bigger than six by six feet in size. Harry levitated the box containing his seventh-year Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw’s class essays over and into the small room, settling it down on the shelf next to the others. Shelves ran the length of two walls, the east and west one, leaving the last two bare except for time tables and memos.
Draco: "You'll have to elaborate Potter, or is that beyond you're capabilities too."
eyes back then; felt
Merlin – he was drunk!
Harry nodded, taking the offered hand, and letting Draco pull him back up on to his frozen, numb feet. The warming charm would take a while to get his body temperature back up – he could probably do with a warm shower too. Their hands held for longer than necessary – a couple of seconds maybe, and before they moved away to get their respective students back to their dormitories, their eyes met… and for a moment they just stared at each other. Their breath clouded between them as they breathed, the fire so hot in its unspoken desire… but Draco just nodded and strolled away.
"Right, come through Mr Potter! Don't be nervous now. You're probably feeling a little out of sorts due to the Crelamotia flowers. Terrible this time of year, absolutely terrible! Yes, August comes and they fill everyone's heads with fluff. I blame the latona - invisible little spores with a mind of their own, but the flowers are ones of love and everyone reacts differently."
“He appeared to be his old self when he first woke up, I suspect his symptoms will be spasmodic until her recovers fully. It seems he no longer suffers with hallucinations at least.”
Harry: "No! But-"
Their eyes met again, this time with loud unsaid words that resonated through Draco’s body. Those green eyes glowed in the fire light and looked at him with such conviction. Draco could be mistaken, but Harry
While Harry raged internally - taking it out on his toast, he didn't notice Draco's face pale, or feel the atmosphere turn more hostile around them. Seamus was suddenly standing next to him, his wand out and pointed at Harry. Not thinking he would do it, Harry ignored him.
Draco: "Oh, maybe I do!"
-Draco winks at Harry, before turning around to walk with Blaise and Pansy back to the castle.
No one heard the 'pop', as the radio coated the house in golden light.
Draco: "I didn't mean it. I'm sorry Harry."
“Move aside please. I am in a hurry.” Harry tried, but the damn reported blocked his escape.
He shoved a glass of whiskey into Draco chest – forcing the man to take it, as he passed him on the way back to the dark-blue chesterfield sofas. He all but collapsed into the one on the right, tiredly. He sighed and ran a hand down his face, replaced his glasses, and then looked up at the blond again.
'POP' Too busy kissing with roaming hands, they missed the arrival of the meddling radio.
“Who are these from then?” Draco asked, pointing to the gifts on the table.
“Rags?” Harry feigned outrage. He knew Draco was teasing him, and he loved it. “I brought these in a respectable shop I’ll have you know.”
Harry’s smile widened, wondering what Tau’s reaction to his choice of ‘making it up to him’ would be.
“Well, “Harry said, hoping to get a reaction from the blond, “we have Honey!”  Draco slowly turned his head to look at him, and then he looked down at the breakfast tray that Harry had just slipped onto his lap. “Come on,” Harry encouraged, trying to forget what Draco had said during his hysteria, “You really do need to eat something.”
Harry’s head snapped up and he blinked as he took in his full and waiting class of second years. Every single student was sitting with their books, parchment and quills, and wands ready to go. He smiled, embarrassed, as he put down the purple quill in his hand and stood up. He hadn’t been having a mind haze episode this time, but he was certainly lost so deep in his thoughts that he hadn’t heard his class arriving.
“Alright!” He relented. “Goodnight Harry.”
-Images fill the room, each showing a happy, younger Draco.
He put the parchment away, and spent the next couple of hours tossing and turning in bed before sleep finally came.
Draco kisses Harry desperately. Harry just about reciprocates.
There were a few chuckles at the table, from some of the students and teachers alike. Hagrid seemed to shift slightly with his hand in one of his pockets. Miss Adair and Miss Prescott, both looked equally embarrassed.
Harry and Draco had their back to each other.
There were two things he wanted to know above all else; Was Tau, without a shadow of a doubt, Draco Malfoy? And, what was Draco’s true personality?
"Twenty-three?" Draco repeated, "Twenty-three?"
He’d been roped into spending a few hours with Neville the other day, and although he liked the man, he could only process so much information regarding plants. Draco talked about things he could relate to: flying, being judged by the media, teaching now of course, and the effects of the war to some degree. Harry also enjoyed the teasing between them, yet they seemed to be able to hold mature conversation. They also had a history together that included saving each other’s lives, and Harry was sure that Draco needed a friend just as much as he wanted someone to talk to that wasn’t a child or over sixty. Yes, Neville was great, but he needed topics other than what Hellebore plants could do, or what Hannah was going though now she was pregnant. He needed more interesting or challenging topics, and Tau still hadn’t replied either.
Draco mumbled, he'd been doing that on and off - mumbling about his past before Hogwarts, before Voldemort. Harry let him, listening as best he could.
“Are you not going to open the others?” Draco asked. He’d watched as Harry opened the letters, and only one of the Christmas gifts that turned out be a rather nice, knitted green jumper. Harry had slipped into the jumper immediately, abandoned the other presents, and asked it they should get going to the Great Hall then.
“I will not.” Draco countered, but Harry didn’t look convinced. “I give you my word.”
“I’m just gonna…” Harry nodded behind him, closed the door and sighed. ‘
-Sunday 6th September - 6pm, Draco pushes past Harry to get to the Great Hall first for dinner.
“This is all your fault Potter!” Draco complained, taking the clothes.
“And cinnamon?” Draco asked, unaware of Harry’s whirling thoughts, and hesitantly deciding that it wouldn’t be so bad if he could get honey
“You haven’t opened yours yet.” Draco raised his eyebrow, looking at the gift still unopened in Harry’s hands.
“She seems less nervous around you.” Harry suddenly commented from across the table.
Harry: "You wish!"
Draco abandoned his book hunting, practically throwing himself down on the identical couch opposite Harry.   “You- Potter, you do realise that now my father is in prison you can preside over my own mother!”
Harry ran his hands through his thick black hair, rubbed his eyes and sighed loudly.
Draco: "Then what? Come on, you're the famous, brilliant Harry fucking Potter. The chosen one. I guess no one is good enough for you unless their fucking perfect! Considering you couldn't save everyone, you're not so fucking perfect yourself."
“Come on then.” Harry said, before Draco commented on his embarrassment. “I’ll get Kreacher to gather some food, we can go find a basket or something, and a ground blanket.”
“Draco?” He breathlessly asked, matching Draco’s strides as he walked beside him again.
-Harry pokes Draco in the chest.
Hermione: "Never mind. Right, we will leave you two to it. Mr Forthswrite should be here in a few minutes."
He put his parchment and quill in the draw of his bedside table, then snuggled under the covers to sleep. He still had a huge grin on his face, felling much better after his run in with Malfoy earlier. He kept trying to picture what Tau looked like: Blond hair - maybe a sunshine golden blond, or a honey blond. Grey eyes - dark grey like a storm, grey that was almost blue, or a light grey? He was taller than Harry, 5ft 9in if he remembered his profile correctly. Maybe he was lean and tall, with a handsome face and a kind smile.
“Unfortunately, some of the food or drink may be contaminated I’m afraid -- Poisoned.” Professor – and deputy Head master, Filius Flitwick started. The students looked terrified. “I will arrange for safe food and drink to be sent to your dormitories, and you may continue to honour All Hallows' Eve there if you wish to do so, until midnight. Prefects and/or Head of houses are to escort you all back to your dormitories immediately! You will be informed when we have more news.”
-Draco points at Harry accusingly.
-After dinner, they go to Harry's room. Sitting on the bed, content in each others company.
Unknown, and unseen by Draco, a shiver ran though Harry spine – caused by that drawling voice that reminded him so much of one Severus Snape. Draco’s ability to silence a room, to gain totally silence, and to send chills down his spine with his voice alone… Damn, it was attractive and arousing!
Having temporarily forgot that Draco was still in the room sharing a coffee with him, he remembered how Draco had looked on his broom the other day for comparison to that awful night. Draco’s hair was no longer suffocated under oils or gel, and his platinum-blond hair hung freely - perfectly even, and it almost glowed under the bright sunshine. Harry thought, it made his messy black hair look atrocious in comparison.
“Off you go now. It’s Friday, enjoy the last of your lessons but remember to
"Lovely! Take a seat then." Malaise pointed to the opposite couch, and once he'd sat down, she did the same. "How are you feeling now Mr Potter?"
This was the most open Tau had ever been with him, and it was both enlightening and intimate simultaneously. It was more personal than they had been before, and it let slip more of Tau’s life then was safe to do. Tau was taking risks, trusting him to some degree.
Draco hands Harry the ingredients he needs in the potions closet – bodies close.
Draco: "No one else is effected by whatever magic is affecting us Potter. If we tell anyone they'd think we were insane! Or at the very least ... they'd blame me."
Draco salutes Harry, singing as he slow walks backwards.
Draco: "Then ask me anything?"
Harry rushed around to the other side of the bed, finding the man in a shivering cocoon and breathing heavily.
“What makes you think we even
-Hermione holding a baby girl with Ron beside her. Harry and Draco smile at them, them share a look.
When Mr Potter started to manipulate the snow that was being sent his way by Mr Malfoy, the students gawped in awe at the huge, massive snowball that had started to form above their defence against the Dark arts teacher’s head, growing bigger, and bigger, and bigger...
-Draco by the forbidden forest, using his wand to blow up rocks, stones.
“Are you feeling better now Briana?” Neville gently asked.
Harry blinked in shock, taken aback; the fact that Draco had noticed so many of his idiosyncrasies was both endearing and alarming… disturbing in fact. He hadn’t thought about his habits as a whole before, never thought about what they would look like to people around him.
Harry instantly went up the stairs - dragging Draco behind him by the hand, and into what looked like an old living room. Harry popped down his small bag - containing his shrunk shopping and turned to apologize for the house's state, but Draco had initiated a fiery make out session. As they landed on the old couch, they started coughing as dust swooped around them - the smell of mold not the right ambiance for the moment. It was because of that, that Harry shrunk the current couch, and returned the new the new one he brought today into its original size.
Harry thought sarcastically, still hovering on his broom.
He suspected that he wouldn’t get much sleep tonight… he’d be far too worried about Draco, and the echoes of his past still whispered in the night air.
Harry froze in his tracks, tears in his eyes that he held back, body stiff. He really didn't need Draco's moods swings in his life, or his abrupt personality changes if he wouldn't even talk to him about what was wrong. He had shit to deal with himself, let alone trying to help someone that was an arse and wouldn't be helped. He had hoped it would have worked out though, he had such strong feelings for the blond that hurt.
"Grow up Malfoy! It was a damn accident. Not that I'd expect you of all people-- You know what, never mind."
“I’m not so sure of that. And you have to get down stone stairs…” Harry knew he’d be useless walking down with Draco - he was just as bad, but then he had a thought. “Kreacher!”
“Right… Draco are you okay?” Harry frowned, feeling Draco’s head once the man was lying down on the sofa. Even Draco’s pale face was freezing cold and ghost white – something was very wrong!
-Harry snuggles into Draco's side.
-Monday 1st February 1999: Harry and Draco enter the Great hall for breakfast, holding hands.
learn as opposed to anyone else. You turn over a card, have to do the spell correctly in a set time, or suffer a counter attack. It was genius - the game, but Draco didn't see the point. If he wanted to learn a spell he would just practice.
“Professor Slughorn?” Draco interrupted.
"It's not that bad Draco, even I've had stitches." Harry chuckled.
When Harry handed it back to him, their hands brushed and Draco felt bereft when the contact was lost. It confused him and frustrated him, his feelings, and he quite frankly didn’t wish to feel the way he did… he couldn’t afford to; the Golden boy and an Ex-Death Eater would never work out, his father’s actions had sullied the Malfoy name, and the media… people in general, it would go to madness if they found out. He would be targeted most aggressively for daring to ‘corrupt’ the boy whole lived, and Harry’s life would he a living hell – Merlin, Morgana and Salazar together wouldn’t be able to prevent the chaos and calamity that would erupt.
We're running out of time
The kissing continued over the claps and whooping. Draco finally slide the ring onto Harry's finger.
He chuckled, but the look of panic in Harry's face persuaded him to help. Damn Potter!
"I'm on hall duty tomorrow!" Harry paced the room. "Fuck!"
---OOO---
“I will pretend that I didn’t see the contents of that note.” Harry continued. “I was a student myself once, however, I hope that whatever you two are doing is safe for the both of you, and for the other students in this castle. If something were to happen while you two were alone, no one would be able to find you.”
Blaise: "Potter took it, remember? Are you sick?"
abode?
Draco: "Is a cock-sucking cunt Potter, you can say it. I'll never forgive him for what he did. That evil bastard can rot in prison for all I care."
-Draco folds his arms on the rails, placing his head onto them.
“Malfoy!” Harry beat him to salutations. He didn’t want any trouble, so he instantly chastised himself for his immediate defensive tone.
“Calm down Potter! I’m not your judge and jury. You’re right, it isn’t up to me and I’m sorry for my curiosity on a subject that obviously bothers you so much. Your job isn’t my concern unless it affects mine, and I’m not here to cause you problems.” Draco had remained seated, but he eyes held unblinking into Harry’s.
"Bloody hell Potter, how do you keep up?" Draco shook his head, sipped at his coffee and handed the list back to Harry. "Never mind. What do you wish me to pick up for Kaison tomorrow?"
“I’m touched by your solicitude Potter. If your idea of friendship is kidnapping, then I think you need your head examined.” Draco practically screamed.
Tom Riddle, was once just a young orphaned boy. To think that any child could grow up to become what Riddle did… it was unbelievable and horrifying. Ever since his sixth year – since he’d see that memories of young Tom at the orphanage, he wondered what Tom would have been like had he been adopted by loving parents – witch and wizard parents. Was he tainted because he was conceived via a love potion? Was he angry at the world for leaving him to the mercies of an orphanage? Would he have always turned out the same?
“I thought you had a new found respect for our lost Potions professor.” Draco frowned slightly.
Tau-Draco had taken the bait, and Harry couldn’t stop laughing enough to form his reply. The question wasn’t as direct as outright asking if he was a squib, but Harry knew why Draco had asked the question and that was what had caused his mirth.
He blinked - the phantom itch was back again. What was it he was thinking before he returned to the Great Hall – before everything went downhill?
Draco: *Sighed* "It isn't that simple ...
Draco, had opened his own gift to find a rather aesthetically pleasing leather-bound journal with parchment pages. The front of the leather was embossed with a most detailed image of a dragon’s head, bordered by what he thought was an intricate Celtic pattern. It also had a well-tailored gold clasp of some sort that kept the journal closed when not in use. It didn’t look wizard made though, which made him conclude that it must have been muggle made, but there was something magical about it regardless. It the journal wasn’t enough, accompanying it, was a beautiful, green peacock quill… but the writing end was unusual and strange – where the calamus shaft should have been, was a beautiful, gold filigree body… or handle he supposed, where you would hold the quill. The writing tip was also made of gold, and the box contained five other tips… but they were separate. There was also a bottle of ink, with a company name he didn’t recognise, and a pipette.
Harry was in a foul mood already that morning: It would have been Professor Severus Snape's 39th birthday today, yet McGonagall refused to do anything to honor his bravery - she though that too many students didn't know the truth, and therefore, it would be a disaster. Then a sixth year Hufflepuff had used a hex to make Draco's hair turn into antlers, and Harry's turn white-blond. It might have been funny if they hadn't used the stinging jinx on Draco too, causing him severe pain and swelling.
Harry raised his eyebrows.

Biting his lip, he made up his mind. He drew the Mannaz rune and watched his words vanish as they sent themselves to Tau… possibly to Draco.
… you scared?” Harry raised his eyebrows as Draco glared daggers at him. Harry just sat there drinking his coffee with a smug grin on his face.
“You will report to me every night this week from 8pm until 10:30pm. You will also report to Mr Filch at 9am on Saturday morning, and you will work for him until 5pm, only being excused for one hour during lunch time. On top of that, you will report to me on Sunday at 9am. I will give you a detention slip when you return here tonight at 8pm. You are dismissed!” Draco was almost hissing at the boy, but he held calm and Harry had to commend him on his restraint – He himself, had yelled at the Silas a few times in the past because the boy had a way to make even his blood boil.
Harry had just finished third period and was done for the school day. He levitated two boxes into the small box room in his private chambers, and then made himself a coffee. He soon plopped himself down on the edge of his bed and pulled out the magical parchment and quill he had left behind today.
“I’d feel better if I didn’t have to eat this slop!” Draco complained.
“He’s dangerous Potter!” Draco insisted just as firmly, yanking his arm away. If Harry hadn’t been bloody Potter and fought of the curse so easily, Harry would have attacked him. He was also fuming that Harry could have been attacked or hurt for his actions under the effects of the curse.
-Kissing, now Husbands.
“For saving the world with your sacrifice. For being brave enough to die for people that may never know you. For saving me. For allowing us this opportunity to just gaze at the stars and breath. And, for dragging me to your… acceptable little abode, and being a friend when I needed one.”
-Day dreaming at dinner during the Christmas meal with the Weasley family.
Harry: "Fine!"
Harry had turned red, and zoned out as his friends bickered before him. Luckily the common room was empty except them, but he could have sworn someone was watching him. He turned to find the room empty.
-Everyone is preparing to leave Herbology, Draco still won't look at him as he shoves his things away quickly.
He would try to separate the cursed moments of music and singing, from his un-cursed moments - swearing blind that they weren't real ...  but they were. Potter wasn't stupid enough to think that their actions during their cursed episodes were total fabrication. How could he deny anything when the fucking curse kept contradicting him.
Harry instantly saw fault in Filius plan, and quickly used a milder version of the Sonorous Charm before chaos and confusion broke out in the Hall.
Draco didn’t know why, but that strange feeling of betrayal and dishonesty pulsed through his veins once again. He looked over Harry and blinked. He had been spending an awful amount of time in Harry’s company lately, and he enjoyed every minute of it. Could he be developing feelings for the golden boy?
Harry wasn’t sure why Draco had brought this gift for him exactly, but he had a few ideas: Draco didn’t want to find himself in that uncomfortable situation again with him, Draco was worried that he-Harry could be caught short one day, maybe he assumed that would make him-Harry feel more comfortable to know that had the potion nearby, but Harry assumed that Draco cared. Draco had seen him at one of his worst moments, had seen him weak, had seen him broken for a few minutes that day… He wasn’t judging Harry, wasn’t laughing or ridiculing him, and most importantly, he wasn’t asking if he was okay or offering pointless advice. Draco was trying to help make things easier for him, was offering a gift that, at this point in time, meant a great deal to him.
Pushing through the crowd urgently, Harry gasped when he saw Miss Camellia Nixon – a fifth year Gryffindor, laying on the floor unconscious and looking rather pale. Minerva was forcing the Wiggenweld Potion into her mouth, but it didn’t seem to be working as they had expected.
All your perfect imperfections
He then turned to face the man he had falling in love with. Curse or no curse, today had proved that it wasn't a lie. He really did love Draco Malfoy. He realised then that ... he couldn't be without him. He would persevere with Draco, be patient and understanding, and hope that one day ... Draco wouldn't feel the need to hide behind a wall and protect him-self with hostility and lies.
His mind decided then, that it wanted to paint and wander as he rested his tired eyes. It painted long, thick buttery-blond hair this time, framing a warm smiling face, and laying on the pillows next to him on the bed. Two dark, passionate grey eyes stared up into his own emerald green ones. They were filled with a tender kindness, yet there were murky shadows of the past that sat behind the plea to be seen – his soul bared open and raw, begging not to judged or held in a forever frozen trial of convictions.
Draco: "I do, I am. I just..."
He jumped when he heard three smart raps at the door, he almost tripped over the coffee table in his initial rush to open the door. He took a calming breath – blew away the ‘Wrackspurts’ as his old friend would say, and then went to open the door.
Ginny: "Because he would prefer to bang Malfoy, isn't that right Harry?"
Harry voice was furious, and he yanked his arm free.
"She gave as the day off remember; I doubt she's expecting us to turn up now." Harry smiled, but he looked away. He wanted to say something…
His body burned with needs, and suddenly… he remembered that night with Draco - how they’d both consumed one too many glasses of fire whiskey, and how he’d briefly had lascivious thoughts of Draco’s attractive body and what he could do with it.
"Thanks," Harry smiled shyly, quickly continuing on, "right, the last stop is a muggle store called Argos. I need to get Arthur's gift."
Wait?
-Hermione stands and watches Draco flee the Great Hall, shaking her head.

“The sixth vessel held a part of his soul, yes, but he never intended for it happen, nor did he get the chance to say the spell and make it a true Horcrux because his body was destroyed. That’s why he could never die and stay dead the evil bastard, because -- because a part of his soul always remained earthbound and undamaged. When he –- when he came back in 1995, at the end of – the end of – erm -- fourth year –- he -- he made another one by killing-”
“Oh, dear Merlin Potter, what are you thinking? You do realise that Halloween has long gone and that we’re now approaching Christmas?”
As Harry left the class room with a worried Ron and Hermione, Draco shoved into him - slipping a piece of parchment into his pocket. Ron scream after him.
"Goodnight Draco."
“He flies a broom, he talks about the magical world in detail, and he knows about spells and potions. He isn’t a squib!” Draco insisted for the fourth time, and very defensively too Harry noted.
“Huh?” Draco slurred, his lips blue and shivering along with the rest of him.
His guilt at finding Draco attractive was dissipating the more evidence came to light that he was in fact, Tau. At least he wouldn’t have to choose between them if he did develop feelings for Draco, and standing here before the man once again, he was reminded of the fact that it was actually a possibility. His feelings for Draco had always sat precariously on an edge – rocking between friendship, enemies, and something else entirely.
As if on cue, Neville downed the last of his coffee, nodded to the headmistress, and then excused himself from the table to do just as Minerva had said he would. Draco knew it was hopeless arguing with Minerva; the witch sometimes had uncanny observational skills – perhaps it was the cat in her. He didn’t want anyone getting false ideas that he and Harry were anything more than friends however, so he refused to seem eager about his offered excuse to visit Harry this morning. He couldn’t deny to himself that any excuse to see Potter was a welcomed one.
Councilor: "Slytherin's are a cunning, resourceful, and an ambition bunch. I know you want me to give you the okay, but it's what ya need that we'll focus on. I can already tell you need to be here."
Draco huffed, downed the last of his liquid courage in one, and then helped himself to another – filling up his glass with rich amber whisky. “Fine! Bloody manipulative bastard. Once you have finishing explaining what you meant about his soul being in your head, I’ll tell you some of the finer details to my
Draco turned and walked off. He didn't know where he was going, and would have apparated back to Hogsmeade if he had a licence. Harry followed him.
-Most of the lyrics in this story have been altered slightly from their original to fit in with this story. (Yes, I've used songs that already exist instead of creating my own.) Also some songs have been cut shorter. It is therefore advised that you read the lyrics in the story.
Harry: "Thank you for saving my eyes. *He batted his eyelashes* Wouldn't want to take away your favorite part of me now would we?
He almost headbutted the headboard as he threw his head back. Was he really into tall arrogant pure-bloods, with blond hair, grey eyes, that ate too much chocolate, and had disastrous pasts?
“That bloody book! I hate that damn thing, but the ministry bribed me to have it published - to settle down the wizarding population. Too many people wanted to know the story of the ‘boy who lived twice’, they were getting bombarded with owls and questions, and the newspapers were writing contradictory drivel. Owls wouldn’t leave me alone either, so I was forced to sit down with a publisher and spill the details of my bloody life. Mind you, it isn’t a complete record of my history, I may have conveniently forgotten to mention half of what actually happened and tweaked a few of the details here or there.”
-Decorating Grimmauld place, together.
Draco decided to drop the subject for now, Harry obviously didn't want to talk about it, but something was troubling the man. It was another thing to file away in his mind.
Draco was still kneeling. Harry was staring at perhaps, the most beautiful ring in his life. It had a flat top like a lot of men's rings, silver, with a line of small diamonds deeply embedded into the metal, ending with a slightly bigger emerald and ruby.
“Times up!” Harry clapped his hands and the tests flew to Harry’s desk via wandless magic. Most of his student sighed in relief, a few grumbled that they hadn’t finished yet. “Sorry that I subjected you all to a test on your first Defence against the darks arts class of the year, but I need to know what you guys remember so we can focus on revising what you don’t.”
“Draco?” Harry called. “Draco are you okay?”
-Monday the 7th December - Herbology: Draco slips Harry a note.
-Draco stands back up and walks slowly to the other side. He looks at the moon in all its bright glory. The way its glows over the world reminds him of Harry.
Harry hoped that was the case – it wasn’t like Draco had scars like that anywhere else. No, Harry truly believed that Draco just wished he could remove the Dark mark from his arm… that he could remove such a glaring reminder of his past misdeeds. It was likely that the man had realised that it couldn’t be removed and had given up trying… perhaps, in more ways than one.
Harry: "I don't know what's real anymore Draco. This curse is fucking with our lives, and even you said it wasn't real ... so, what's changed?"
– what I saw through his eyes, what he saw through mine, and having to feel that bastard’s emotions when he was angry or-” Harry shivered, and took a deep breath. “My visons, flashes, or whatever they are… they’re not real – they’re not
, he secretly thought to himself.
Draco: "Now Potter, if it isn't clear by now that I fucking love you then we're officially fucked, because I do love you. I want to spend the rest of my life competing, annoying, saving, and loving you until the day we die. I will take you just as you are you stupid git, bad hair, scars, certain red heads that you come with..."
Harry burst out laughing as he went to finish the last sip of firewhisky, spitting it out across the table as he guffawed and gasped for air.
Harry: "He really didn't have much choice during the war, and he is a git I know! But I think he just acts the way people expect him to. No one will give him chance, so whatever he does, people will look for the bad."
Harry went to snatch the radio from Draco, but he pulled it back. Blaise and Pansy laughed. Harry tried again, but he ended up falling into Draco's chest.
When the lesson ended - and they were in the corridors alone. Harry pinned Draco against the wall, tongue deep in his mouth and as hard as a boulder. He could feel Draco against his thighs.
Draco opened his door a bit more, frowning slightly down at him. “You’re concern about my health Potter –– Harry?” He sounded surprised almost, like Harry checking to make sure he was alright was unbelievable.
Draco: "What on earth is a flashlight, Potter?"
I'm the master of both
Draco: "Not at all Pans. We were actually discussing our holiday plans."
“It’s fine Potter,” Draco said, but Harry instantly recognising the defensive tone. “I shouldn’t have been so bold. My mistake, I’ll just-”
-Sitting at a table, Draco listens to Harry talking.
. He couldn’t deny that he liked what he saw, but he
confusing that he
The look Harry was now giving Draco made the blond regret opening his mouth. Draco hurried away in the snow, Harry following him.
Harry: "Was ... Is ... *sighs and whispers* Please tell me your serious, that this wasn't just the curse and now you're having second-."
Well, that left Harry agreeing to meet Draco/Tau at Le’Amortentia, on Saturday the 29
“Alright, alright! That enough now, settle down!” Harry’s deep voice boomed across the room. His students hardly ever heard him use this tone, and it successfully silenced the room. “It’s a simple test recapping on what you remember from last year. It should be easy enough, and you don’t have worry about marks because I won’t be marking it. The idea, as you should be aware of by now, is to decided what first year material needs to be revised. I can forgo the test if you like, but then I will be forced to give you an immense load of homework covering the entire curriculum of first year. If you want the extra homework, and would like to see your current defense against the arts teacher run screaming from his private chambers in the middle of the night, barefooted and in his pajamas, because he went crazy with the work load, then perhaps that can be arranged?”
-Draco gets really close to Harry face, then turns and walks away
“Draco is correct Harry! You can barely talk about the war as it is, watching the war will be worse.” Minerva’s expression was less stern and more concerned.
Draco: "Come on then Potter, the show can't start without me."
He thought. There were plants in large vases – simple greenery really, and various dark green textiles here and there, but Harry noticed only one other door in the room – besides the main door that was.
Draco: "Blaise was right about you Potter, you're a fairy!"
He didn’t feel the pain as his skin torn beneath his nails. He didn’t blink when it started to bleed. He didn’t notice as tears fell from his eyes in his desperate need to erase the evidence of his sinful past.
-Draco leads them into a slow waltz.
-Sunday 7th: Harry drags Draco - confidently, past a group of Ravenclaws that still hate the blond.
“Maybe I will ask him… to meet me that is.” Draco used his drink as an excuse to look away from green eyes. If Harry did like him as he suspected, then Harry was sure to be hurt by his dedication to Padfoot.
