“I wish I was staying,” Draco said as he hugged Harry tightly.  You shouldn’t spend Christmas alone.”
“Unusual setting,” Draco said, looking more closely.  “Looks to be about a third of a carat?  The filigree detailing on the side is exquisite.  And this . . . is this a pink sapphire hidden on the side there?”
“Yes, that’s why I picked it over apparating from place to place or portkey.  Brooms were out of the question.”
Meanwhile, feeling overwhelmed, Harry asked Pansy to package up some food for Draco and take it back to Slytherin.  He assured her that he would find him and bring him back.  Harry hurried out of the hall.
Sitting back and straddling Draco’s legs, Harry unbuttoned his shirt and pulled it open revealing Draco’s pale, hairless chest with several small, faint scars.
“Mione, you can see that he is.  If Harry doesn’t want to talk about it, then we should respect that.”  Ron had his own motives for his rant.  He and Harry would talk about girls over the years, often in a less than respectful manner.  Ron himself went on and on about the Greengrass girls and their physical attributes.  And when Harry got cornered by Daphne near the library, Ron was eager to hear details.  Harry seemed more than willing to comply.  However, Ron was not eager to hear about Draco’s, or any other boy’s, physical attributes.
Finally, Draco opened his eyes and stepped back from Harry.   He silently transfigured his white leather trousers back into jeans, picked up his mask and Vanished it.
“Why don’t I clean up while you feed Rose,” Draco suggested.  He handed her to him and went into the drawing room.
“Cutting right to the chase,” Lucius commented.  He leaned forward in his seat. “Because I can do better.”
Reluctant to elaborate, Ron hesitated.  “I didn’t really want tell you this, but as it affects you too . . . the letters weren’t just vague threats against Lucius or the Malfoy family.  The last letter specifically mentioned you and Draco.  I didn’t say anything before because Hogwarts is the safest place for the two of you to be,” Ron explained.  “And the Aurors have been checking in here every so often.”
Harry looked at the other guests, none of whom were wearing jeans.  But at least he wore a tie and jacket.
Seeing the wheels in Harry’s mind turning, Draco finally spoke up.  “Harry, I know what you’re thinking.  I’m not angry anymore.  I’m not trying to get you back.  Those were only dreams that you had.”
“Uh, no problem. We’ll just go in my room.”  Ginny took Dean’s hand and pulled him into her bedroom.
Draco closed the book and tossed it aside.  Ron, who was sitting on the floor with Hermione, perked up when he saw that.
“Hermione sent me an owl this morning.  She wants us to get together this coming weekend. At Hogsmeade, or somewhere else.  It doesn’t matter.”  Harry smiled.  “She says she has news.  I guess Ron didn’t tell her I knew about the proposal.”
“Those are all conscious decisions.  And of course, they shape your path as well. But they may not necessarily be able to change your future.  Fate has a habit of stepping in.”  The fortune teller perked up and sat up taller.  “But I see nothing to worry about.  It will all work out in the end.”
At first a look of panic crossed Draco’s face, but then he nodded.  Harry was just about to get up when a knock came at the door.
He wasn’t certain what he would have done.  But he was certain that he didn’t like leaving things between him and Draco the way they were.
“I love him.  But I love you too.  You’re my best friend.  You need to protect yourself.  If it comes down to it, Ron, you do what you need to do,” Harry said sadly.  The thought of losing either of them was devastating.
“I think we’re ready now,” he smiled.  He was specifically speaking about ordering food, but it seemed to be applicable to his relationship with Draco as well.  He turned to him. “What would you like, love?”
“McGonagall left her office open so you could use the floo network from there,” Neville told him. Ron quickly ran out of the common room.
“Are we?” Harry questioned, gently pulling on Draco’s chin to face him.  “I mean, I am.  But you have to let it go.  Don’t be so hard on yourself.”
“Of course I do,” Harry laughed.  “I’m only asking for a little time.”  He paused.  “To catch up to you.”
“Harry, instead of just staring over there, go talk to him,” Hermione snapped her fingers in Harry’s face.
Not liking the look on Harry’s face, Draco looked instead at his own fingernails.  His heart started to beat a bit faster as if he knew what Harry was going to say, but he couldn’t acknowledge it.
“It’ll be fun while it lasts and then it will fade away like every other relationship in this place.”
They both reached for the fluxweed at the same time, and Harry intentionally brushed his hand against the Slytherin’s.  The same electric sensation he felt earlier hit him with a jolt. He withdrew his hand.
“Didn’t you hear?  Knox’s parents were taken into custody.  My father named them as Death Eaters. There was an owl waiting for me this morning.”
“Now, class, take care dropping the ashwinder egg in,” Slughorn warned.  “If the yolk sac breaks before it cooks, your potion may be ruined.  And don’t actually stir it.  Gently wave your wand over it to get the current going.”
Harry laughed.  “No, I would think not. But it affects me too.  And if I can help you and Narcissa, I will.”
The first sneered the moment she laid eyes on Draco.  Harry immediately ruled her out in his mind. The second reminded them very much of Luna Lovegood, which put her in either the yes or no column, depending on who was deciding. The third was clearly only in it for the money, as she was unimpressed by Harry’s pedigree, and only wondered aloud if there was anything she could do to earn extra money in the process. Last was a young woman who confessed to lying a bit on her application.
Instead, Draco got to his knees and held onto the headboard, allowing Harry free access to his cock.  He spread his legs a little wider in invitation.
Harry walked into his own dormitory to find three snoring bodies.  He considered casting a spell to quiet them, then decided he was too tired to let a little noise keep him up.  As he drifted off, he thought about Hermione’s suggestion.  He liked the idea of Draco and him finding a place that was truly their own. That was what Ron and Hermione would most likely do, once they got married.  He was happy for his friends, but he felt a twinge of jealousy that he and Draco would probably never get to marry.  Not unless the British government and the Ministry miraculously became open minded enough to allow it.
“Don’t say it out loud,” Harry begged.  “It’s who you think it is.  Turns out, he didn’t mind me watching him. Do you think anybody else knows?”
“What he said to Skeeter about how being gay isn’t a scandal.  You know she took that as confirmation.  And obviously someone who saw you kiss me contacted the Prophet.  They’ll tell what they saw.”
“You look amazing in black,” Harry said.  “I’d just like to see you in some nice colors.  Maybe pink.” He winked.
“That’s not exactly the kind of fun I had in mind, darlin’.  What do you say we skip the forest and go to my room?”
Harry debated putting on a glamour to hide his lip, then thought better of it.  He was going to be completely honest and up front with Draco.
“I thought you might need something stronger than sparkling water.” As the waitress put down a shot for Draco, she winked.  “I had a feeling about the two of you when you came in before.”
At first horrified, Harry saw the tiny smirk on his suitor’s face and burst out laughing.  Fortunately, the rest of the table joined in.
“I was gonna do it Valentine’s Day, but now it’ll look like I’m just trying to keep up with Ginny.  Everything is going to be all Ginny, all the time.  I want Mione to have all the attention she deserves for her wedding.”
Harry had just finished speaking to a student requiring some extra help, when he was poked in the ribs from behind.  Ready to draw his wand, Harry turned around to find Draco with a large grin on his face.
“No, of course not.  We haven’t slept in two weeks.” Ron tugged at his hair.  “She cries all the bloody time. The doctor said it’s something called colic.”
A server walked by, then realizing he’d bypassed the hosts, turned around and offered a bite from the tray.
“It’s not meant to be dangerous.  I’m told muggles use them all the time to make quick meals.  Almost as fast as magic.”
“I . . . don’t know.  I suppose I should say yes.  However, the way in which I was living my life wasn’t exactly conducive to raising a family.”
“Yes,” she said, putting a forkful of mincemeat pie into her mouth.  “It’s been approved.  Though, I can’t say it’s the way I would have liked it.”
“I know.  But if we miss it, we may have to wait another month,” Harry said. “It won’t take long.  We can go there and be back before the sorting ceremony with any luck.”
During a lull in the chatting, Harry’s eye wandered to his love.  Draco looked up briefly as he read, returning the smile on Harry’s face. He continued the story in his melodic tone, changing his voice for the different characters.  His voice was entertaining yet soothing, and little Nikki had soon sunk herself into Draco’s side. By the time he had reached the end of the book, the toddler had fallen fast asleep.
“My father?  What’s he got to do with this?”  He grabbed the front of Terry’s shirt.  “What the hell did you do?  Did you contact my father?”
He sighed heavily.  He wanted to get it off his chest, but he also didn’t want anyone to know.  As he always did, he put his trust in Hermione.
The house elf blinked away and was back in a flash with a tray.  She poured out for the threesome and placed a small platter of biscuits in the middle of the small round table.
“I told you I bought a new book.  Did you think I was that angry I’d cancel?  It’s gonna take a whole lot more than one little fight to get rid of me.”
Harry stopped walking and turned toward Malfoy, ready to retort with a defensive remark about his ability to behave like a professional.  However, the expression on the other man’s face was more apologetic than sarcastic.
“Your friends stood up for you.  And I just sat there, like a Malfoy, cowering in the corner.  And now I’ll probably be splashed all over the front page of the Prophet again.”
Shrugging, Hermione surmised, “I don’t know.  You have pursued several girls.  You’ll have to think on that one yourself.  But in the meantime, what are you going to do about Malfoy?  Don’t let him persuade you into something you’re not ready for. Darn it, did I call him Malfoy again? I just can’t remember to call him Draco,” she berated herself.
Draco went into the bath attached to the room, leaving Harry alone to explore.  He opened a drawer in the night table, then closed it quickly.
Draco thought about it.  He wanted to speak with his mother in person.  But he was hoping he could get his mother to break the news to his father in Azkaban.  He truly wasn’t sure if he wanted Harry by his side or not.
She stepped closer, her wand illuminating her features.  The soft light highlighted her cleavage, which was prominently displayed.  Now that Harry thought about it.  Her cleavage was always on display.  His eyes were subconsciously drawn down.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed.  “You missed a wonderful display.  The way the little sparkles fell and spelled out the words.  It was wasted on me,” he laughed.
He grabbed the book of parchment along with the title he purchased in Diagon Alley.  He strolled up the staircase, looking forward, not only to cuddling on the couch with Draco, but their supper with Ron and Hermione.  He had purchased a special bottle of wine to serve in celebration.
In truth, he did like them. Hermione in particular. But Ron wasn’t as stupid as he’d always assumed.  After all, he managed to catch the brightest witch of their age.  He worried that his sentiments weren’t returned, though, and looked forward to doing his best to make a favorable impression.  The last time they visited, he had been taken off guard, having fallen asleep before tidying his room and dressing to impress.
“Yes, well, that’s not the word I would use.  Anyway, it occurred to me that over the course of the game, people that got paired up were staying together.  It was as if the game was playing matchmaker rather than randomly pairing up.”
“Absolutely.”  Harry put a hand on Ginny’s shoulder.  “Next time we get together with Ron and Hermione, you and Owen should join us.”
Ron and Harry continued their shopping trip along Diagon Alley, not speaking another word of Harry’s confession.  It felt as though a weight had been lifted from Harry’s shoulders. He should have known Ron would always have his back.  And he would have Ron’s.  The pair grabbed a bite to eat then headed to Olivander’s newly reopened shop. A thirteen and one quarter inch willow wand with a dragon heartstrings core had chosen Harry.  He left the shop pleased with his purchase, once again having his very own wand, rather than a borrowed one.  Harry couldn’t wait to return to Hogwarts and cast a few spells.
The disappointed look was back.  “Then I’ll take my leave of you boys and allow you to get your supper.”
The blond straddled the brunet, placing himself over the pole-like erection.  Gradually, ever so carefully, Draco lowered his legs, bringing him down, covering Harry like a sheath.  Both boys groaned as Draco’s bum came in contact with Harry’s bollocks.
He opened the book, a fairy tale, about unicorns and a princess.  He snorted when he realized it was a muggle book, but began to read anyway.
Harry shifted her and bounced her while Draco gently patted her back. Suddenly, she burped and Harry’s shoulder was covered in thick, yellow mucous.
He walked back to his quarters a little less optimistic than Harry but looking forward to proving to his mother that Harry was right for him.  Though more open-minded about his sexual orientation than his father, his mother had been skeptical that a relationship with Harry Potter would work out.  Still, Harry was willing to give Narcissa the benefit of the doubt and reach out to her.  Draco sighed.  It didn’t matter if his mother didn’t accept his relationship with Harry.  Nothing could keep him from falling even more in love with the man.
The corner of Harry’s mouth rose. He had been thinking the same thing ever since Draco walked back into the room. Harry pulled back the covers further and patted the bed, inviting Draco to join him. Discarding the bathrobe, Draco climbed on and straddled Harry’s legs. He looked down between them. Even flaccid, Harry’s cock was impressive. But Draco was determined to change that status.
“I know that, Harry.  But people hold grudges.  I’ve heard a rumor that Malfoy still gets hate mail.”
.  I want to do make up and modern hairstyles.  That’s what witches want nowadays.  Like Parvati.  I did her hair.”
“You don’t have to worry about me, Draco.  Nothing is going to happen to me.”  Harry sat down next to him and put his arm around his shoulder.
When Harry arrived, twenty minutes later, the party was in full swing.  Students were decked out in seemingly every possible sort of costume.  Some, like Ron and Hermione, wore classical period clothing. Some were dressed in typical Halloween characters, such as ghosts and movie monsters.  Others, like Harry sported muggle costumes.  And then there were some that Harry couldn’t figure out what the hell they were supposed to be.  It looked like they simply threw on whatever they happened to have lying around.  It was all in good fun, though, and Harry’s mood was high.  He searched the crowd for a head of blue hair but found none on his first pass around the room.  He stopped to get a cup of pumpkin punch, then strolled around once more.  He noticed that he could see over many more students’ heads than usual.  The high heeled boots he wore made his footing a bit wobbly, but it was well worth the extra height.  Harry secretly wished her were taller, like many of the other boys.
“Well, McGonagall likes to make students write essays on what they did wrong and why, and what lessons they learned.  One time, when I was a student, I had to clean out Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.  Without magic.”
“It’s not rubbish. Well, some of it is, but she’s the leading Divination witch.  Aren’t you curious what she’ll have to say?”
He let Ginny hug him for a while.  Her scent was comforting and familiar.  And soon he found himself back from the edge of tears.  He pulled back slightly and kissed her cheek.
Draco pushed the food around his plate. “They made it sound like one of his colleagues sent it,” he told them.  “If my father feels his back is against the wall, he’ll lash out.  That article in the Prophet made it sound like Harry forced me to be with him.  Father will see getting rid of Harry as a way to get me back into the Greengrass’ good graces.  Mother has already explained my relationship with Harry as a phase to be outgrown.”
“Yes, I know what you mean,” she replied. She glanced at Draco in another corner talking to Fleur.  “I wonder what on Earth they could be talking about.”
“Good night.”  She leaned forward and place a small kiss on his cheek, then quickly retreated with her housemates.
“I thought Draco would be too.  But he seemed quite content reading to her.  He’s very good at reading aloud.”
Ron leaned closer to Harry.  “Actually, she’s fucking gorgeous.  And stacked,” he said in a hushed voice.
“At two in the morning?” Draco blinked. “Like this?” He chuckled. “I suppose I’m a captive audience.”
With one hand, Draco grasped Harry’s bouncing cock.  With the other, he raked his fingernails over Harry’s chest.
He slammed the door behind him when he reached his quarters. No sooner had it closed, than it opened again.
“How about being the man he needs you to be for a change?”  Harry’s demeanor softened.  “He wants to reconcile.  He loves you very much.  Don’t waste the time you have left worrying about who your son fucks,” he said, strictly for shock value.  “I would give anything to have even one day with my father.  Don’t piss your days away.  Please.”
Draco grinned and ground his hips forward and back, squeezing his muscles around Harry’s cock.  The brunet arched his back and let out a whimper as he grasped tightly onto Draco’s thighs.
“Then we’re doing this a bit arse about face, aren’t we?  Unless you’re planning another go ‘round.”
He thought about his parents.  They gave their lives for him.  He was angry about that.  At Voldemort, yes, for killing them.  But also at them, for not running away and hiding.  If they had done that, they could have raised Harry themselves.  Sometimes he couldn’t understand why doing the noble thing was better than the cowardly thing.  Did they not love him enough to bear the disgrace of not fighting?  Wasn’t raising their son more important than honor?
“Harry, your magic has made me feel more powerful and confident than ever.”  He glanced down at his forearm. “That faint buzz of dark magic is gone.  Your magic has made me whole again.”
Harry sat in the Great Hall, speaking with McGonagall during dinner.  Draco told him to go ahead without him as he was offering extra practice to some of his Fifth Years preparing for OWLs.
Nearly falling backward from the force of Hermione’s hug, Harry squeezed her back.  When she finally let go, Harry shook hands with Ron and gave him a pat on the shoulder.
“So, I guess, what I want to know is . . .”  He took another small step.  “Is this . . . a date?” he asked softly.
“Not only her,” Harry said, pulling Draco close and putting his arms around his neck. “You heard Molly.  You’re now a family member.  And I’m pretty sure Bill and Fleur weren’t the only ones impressed with your nanny skills.” Harry’s demeanor became serious. “I told you that you would be a wonderful father.”
The rest of the journey was silent, except for the voice in Harry’s head berating him for being so transparent and disconcerted.  Yet Malfoy came across as self-assured and comfortable in his own skin.  The door was unlocked and Harry opened it for Draco to walk through.
Harry watched the scenery go by, as he had on numerous trips back and forth between Hogsmeade and King’s Cross Stations. Ron, Hermione and Draco talked about their future plans, including Ron and Hermione’s wedding.
Draco chuckled.  “I swear that bugger used to hide my wand.  I don’t think it was a coincidence that it seemed to happen whenever Father was angry with me.”
When she returned his gaze, he could see a glistening around the edges of her eyes and a sadness that broke his heart.
Harry sighed softly when he was finished his task and waited patiently for Draco to do something–anything.
“Yes, I figured that out when you said it wasn’t a girl,” Ron snickered.  “I’m not as stupid as I look, you know.”
“Rose, I mean.  How did you manage to straighten the drawing room and keep her happy?  Much less get her to take a nap.”
Chuckling lightly, Harry told him, “I didn’t have a chance to last night.  Hermione waited up for me.”
Hugging Draco tightly, Harry tried to convey his appreciation.  “Thank you.  It’ll be great.  You’ll see.”
By the time Draco re-emerged, fully dressed in trousers and a loose fitting button-down shirt, with his hair properly combed, Harry’s potentially embarrassing issue had disappeared. In Draco’s absence, he brought the food and drinks to the sitting room table so they could eat in comfort.
“Burt and I?  Well, we’re not dating exclusively or anything.  We’ve gone out a few times.  He’s nice but . . .”
“Yes, so do I.  Reviewing five year’s worth of Potions in three weeks isn’t nearly enough.  Hopefully, the students have been studying for a while now.  Except for the Tri-Miones. I don’t have to worry about them.”
Immediately, the frown disappeared and was replaced by wide eyes and a gaping mouth.  Harry was lying, not on the usual small pad he conjured, but a bed covered in green satin sheets.  There were candles everywhere, and a basket with a bottle of something on the floor.  Harry was already nude.
“You’re the one with the future children, not me.  The ones that sound like part of the Weasley clan.”
“Of course I’m bloody afraid Ron won’t understand.”  Harry noticed that Hermione didn’t really even flinch when he told her his date was with another boy.  “You don’t seem surprised though.”
Ginny narrowed her eyes.  Something didn’t seem right.  But she certainly didn’t want to work with Draco.  At least she had spent some time around Blaise at the first wand party and he didn’t seem so bad.  Of course, that would mean Harry would get paired with Malfoy.  Strangely, neither of them appeared to be terribly upset.
Though his gut reaction was to shout back at his father, Draco took another deep breath and tried to calm himself.  Harry’s gentle rub of a thumb on his arm helped a great deal.  At that moment, Draco was glad he insisted Harry stay.
“I’m sorry,” Harry blurted out.  “I don’t know what I was thinking.  I didn’t mean to interrupt your evening.”
Wasting no time, or words, Harry dove at Draco and kissed him.  Draco hurriedly snaked his hands up under Harry’s shirt and gently pushed him onto his back.  Before Harry could protest, the blond tugged at the shirt to pull it off.  Raising his arms up, Harry allowed Draco to remove his t-shirt.  With slight hesitation, the Slytherin reached for the button of his crush’s jeans.  When he encountered no resistance, Draco slowly unzipped the fly.
“Maybe it will all work out.” Pansy put a comforting hand on Draco’s shoulder.  “But if it doesn’t, I’ll be here for you.  And I don’t mean that in any way but as your friend.”
They ordered food from the house elves to eat in Harry’s quarters. Minke was more than happy to serve them and brought enough at lunch time to sustain throughout the day.  Neither man saw any point in leaving Harry’s bedroom.
“McGonagall was right.  We should relax. It’s still our wedding weekend. We can work on lessons tomorrow.”
“Because I’m going to re-edit.  And then you’re going to do some research on muggle agencies and write a new query letter. And, you’re going to use your real name.”
“Well, Ginny hasn’t said anything to me.  Not that she confides in me or anything.”  Ron frowned.  “You know, it’s getting near Christmas.  It won’t be the same without Fred.  Maybe Ginny’s just been thinking about him a lot.  I know I have.”
“Well, this is a surprise,” Draco said as he opened his door.  “I didn’t think I’d see you tonight.”
As Harry stepped under the shower head, Draco watched. The water ran down in rivulets, bringing Draco’s gaze with it. When he looked back up, Harry was grinning at him.
Wiping his brow, Harry took a moment to gather himself.  “Yeah, yeah.  I just had a bad dream is all.”
The feeling of possessiveness that took over Harry surprised himself as well.  The thought of anyone else touching Draco in such a manor made his blood boil.  He unexpectedly grabbed Draco and began jumping and dancing, doing his best to imitate the mass.
“Oh, Draco,” he whispered, kissing the blond’s neck and nuzzling his hair. He pumped his hips with more vigors and reached around to grasp Draco’s erection.
“Oh.  I didn’t know anyone was here,” Draco turned to look at Harry.  “Wait, you didn’t go to the party?”
Shortly thereafter, Harry seemed to be leaning just a bit further than necessary as he watched Draco add the frozen ashwinder egg.  As soon as the egg dropped in, Draco turned to look at Harry.  Hermione spotted the blond briefly lick his lips.
Shifting slightly, Harry reached for Draco’s hands and pulled them up to his mouth. Draco’s warm breath gave him an idea. He held Draco icicle-like fingers up to his mouth and breathed on them as he would his own hands when he forgot to wear gloves.
Harper spun Harry around a couple of times.  “Looks good on you.  But wait, not that shirt and tie.”  He went into his trunk and pulled out a claret coloured silk shirt.
“Oh.”  Harry was surprised.  With Draco’s good looks, he didn’t think he ever had trouble finding companionship.  “Hermione’s like her own one-woman dating service.”
Slowly, Harry tilted his head, and their lips connected. They danced and kissed a while, until someone bumped into them, and they realized the music had switched once again.  Bouncing students nearby jostled the couple.
“Oh, poor baby,” Fleur said, temporarily forgetting her eldest daughter’s tantrum. “Mummy’s so sorry.”
Draco let out a cry at the contact.  He arched his back, further pushing his arse up to meet Harry’s thrusts.  His legs began to tremble when Harry’s cock rubbed his insides just so.
“Are you going to hold it against me forever that I forgot to remove the locking charm?” Blaise threw up his hands in frustration.
“I don’t give a shite.”  Draco attempted to skirt around him, but the other man took a few steps up backward and again blocked his way.
It took Harry a while just to get over the fallen ceiling and into the kitchen. Draco had been correct. There was no way anyone could miss the kitchen. He thought it was bigger than the entire main floor of 4 Privet Drive.
His gut reactions was to take out his wand.  Before doing anything rash, he heard the assailant moan and murmur.
“Honestly? I wouldn’t have noticed if Mione hadn’t pointed it out. She saw you having lunch together a couple of times. And she said you looked disappointed when Malfoy said he didn’t mean all those flowery words when he thought he was dying. Oh, shit. He did mean them, didn’t he?” He paused. “Does that mean you meant what you told him as well?”
Harry glanced up to see Draco walking into the pub with Pansy, Blaise and Harper, whom he presumed to be Blaise’s new boyfriend, since they were holding hands.  His and Draco’s eyes met briefly, and Draco nodded.
“I don’t fucking know.  Whatever it is, it makes babies cry. And we’re part of the lucky twenty percent that get it,” Ron answered sarcastically.
Draco pouted. “Fuck.  Just a little one?” He held up his index finger and thumb in a pinching gesture.
Harry cleaned the cum from Draco’s chest and the bedsheets, and used his specially gentle charm for Draco’s arse. They dressed and made their way down to the Great Hall.
“Stop it, Ron.  I’m not the Chosen One anymore.  I was more like the accidentally chosen one anyway.”  Harry paused and grinned.  “But yeah, she did.”
The woman laughed. “All newlyweds believe that Mr. . .” She shuffled back to the first parchment. “Oh, Mr. Potter.”  She looked up.
“Hm. Sectum Sempra?  Why no, I don’t think I have,” Goshawk eyed up Draco, who had been relatively quiet until then.
“May I finish?” Draco raised an eyebrow.  It was a subtle gesture, but Harry knew it meant that Draco wished to fight his own battles.
“With all of us taking turns, we’ll only each have duty every twelve weekends.  Madam Pince and Madam Pomfrey won’t take duty.  Neither will Filch, obviously.”
“I don’t think that’s going to happen.  So, you’ll just have to be satisfied that he’s leaving me alone.”
Looking away, Draco admitted, “I have. It’s not the same. Harry, you have to understand. Before you, I had a long string one-offs and boy toys, who were only in it because I could afford to treat them to spas, dinners and vacation spots. Most of the time, the company was lacking. I hope you’re not saying that you won’t go anywhere I’ve been with another man.”
“And he didn’t go completely unpunished.  He lost a significant amount of points for his House.  And, I suspect, the respect of more than a few fellow students.” The professor smiled softly.  “Draco, there will always be people in this world, or the muggle world, who will persecute and harass those they don’t like or understand.  And it’s difficult not to want to fight back.  But you must rise above hurtful words.  If you give in, and become violent, you’re no better than those who persecute you.”
“Oh, I didn’t know you had a visitor.  And you’re finally awake.” Madame Pomfrey’s voice startled the pair.
Without their gang leader, the rest of students taking part in the harassment quickly slunk back into the shadows, leaving Harry, Draco and the others to finally live in peace.
“Oh, it’s Minke’s pleasure to serve Master Harry Potter.  And Master Draco Malfoy as well,” she bowed.  “Minke shall bring some pudding.”
“That’s preposterous.  What if he’s already dead or severely injured?  Besides, I will only be able to get Draco out. The new wards will only recognize Malfoys.”
Take a chance and admit she did, or shoot down the only prospect she’d had in a while?  It was a tough call.
Draco stood thinking, forgetting all about the boy standing there.  His father had plenty of connections outside the prison.  He could easily find someone to carry out any misdeeds he wished done. But he couldn’t touch Harry at Hogwarts.  And when they left school, Lucius wouldn’t know where they were, because Draco sure as hell wasn’t going to tell him.
He smiled again at the witch, who was now properly melting. He picked up her hand and kissed the back of it. “You are so lovely for doing this.”
Draco didn’t get a chance to finish that thought as his climax washed over him.  His body stiffened and he clutched Harry’s hair tightly.
“No.  My parents never ordered muggle take away, of course.  And since I’ve been on my own, I’ve only tried pizza and cheeseburgers.  That never looked particularly appetizing.”
Harry’s question surprised Draco. “Uh, I meant . . .”  He knew he had to be careful with his words.  He didn’t know exactly how much of his conversation with Blaise Harry saw.
The crowd was jumping and writhing to the quick beat of the Weird Sisters, minus Gideon Crumb and Merton Graves.  Harry didn’t mind, he never cared much for bagpipes anyway.  A girl with an outfit leaving very little to the imagination, sidled up to Draco tempting him to dance.  Draco put an arm around her waist and pulled her close.  He said something in her ear that Harry couldn’t hear.  By the depth of her cleavage, Harry assumed the girl was Pansy.
Extremely proud of her man, Hermione stood, as did Ginny, Dean and most of the table, including Finnigan.  The other Houses followed suit, the ones choosing to remain seated far outweighed by those standing.
Hermione leaned forward and whispered, “He tries.  He really does. But he’s pants at the whole baby soothing thing.”
“If it were just his potion making skills, I would pass him.  But he plagiarized one essay and handed in total crap on another.  I don’t think he’s stupid.  Just lazy.  But then he acts so frightened of his father that I feel compelled to help him.”
Harry leaned over. “They’re not making fun. It’s just that Molly has a reputation for going a bit over the top.”
He wanted to ask if she was speaking from first-hand experience, but he knew deep down, it wasn’t necessary.  His parents had not engaged in a binding ceremony themselves, and Draco wondered if it had been because of his father’s lack of commitment to Narcissa. He’d seen Lucius humiliate her with his dalliances. Her melancholy expression gave away her pain.
Draco followed Harry into the kitchen, bouncing the baby. He spoke to her in a gentle voice while Harry readied her meal.
“Yeah, he’s dead under that pile blocking the front door,” Harry told him.  “How badly are you hurt?”
“Uh, I just wanted to . . . what I said last night . . . I didn’t mean I don’t think we can be friends.  I was only surprised that you said it.”
“I was in Slytherin for two years.  Hardly worthy of my loyalty.  I’m merely rooting for the team I think is better.  There’s nothing wrong with recognizing good talent.”
Harry watched as Lucius cradled Draco in his arms, rocking him as he would a baby.  If the Auror hadn’t been certain his heart was breaking earlier, he was certain of it now.  The only evidence of his anguish was a lone tear slowly trailing its way down his cheek and into his open collar.
Watching Harry’s hips switch as he walked into the Great Hall didn’t help his situation any.  He tried desperately not to think about how it would feel to have Harry inside him.  He spotted Knox coming back down the stairs and stepped back into an alcove.  The last thing he needed was for Knox to see him trying to talk down his woody.
Piece by piece, Harry spent the next two hours sifting through building material and broken furniture with no luck.  He hadn’t even reached the werewolf’s body.
As the new Potions professor drew nearer, Harry could see that one thing had changed drastically--Malfoy’s eyes.  No longer a scared young boy, nor a guilty Death Eater, his former rival looked at peace.  There was even a glint in his stark grey eyes.  He didn’t look away, but kept his gaze on Harry, a small smile on his lips.
“Don’t let him fool you,” Hermione said. “You should have seen him talking last night,” she smiled widely.  “He’s definitely smitten.  I’ haven’t seen him so . . .” she trailed off, letting her smile fade.
Harry exhaled sharply.  “Yes, mum,” he answered sarcastically.  “Draco and I did some serious damage to his bottle of firewhiskey.   I slept right through the wands sparking this morning. I need some hangover potion.”
Draco laughed.  “It’s perfectly safe.  Believe me, I would be just as upset as you if your dick disappeared.”
Waving a hand, Draco told Harry, “The scars don’t bother me.  I’ve been told they add a bit of mystery.  Sometimes I make up fantastical stories about how I got them,” he laughed.  “A couple of blokes thought they were a turn on.  They haven’t hurt my sex life any,” he grinned.
Wondering exactly how far he could take their clandestine contact, Harry made a move towards Draco’s leg.  The Slytherin professor didn’t stop him as Harry’s palm rested on his upper thigh.  The warmth then moved to Harry’s groin and he thought if he kept at it, he would not be able to stand up to lead his pupils out for a a while.
“I was avoiding you because I didn’t want you to see me. I had to pay the consequences of the game and I got boils.”  It was embarrassing to tell him she had them, even if he didn’t actually see them.
“But it’s my public place,” a tall, burly man called from the bar.  “And I have the right to toss out on their arse anyone who is disturbing the peace here.”
Blushing brightly as other Gryffindors could no longer stifle their giggles, Harry hurried to his dormitory to grab clothes to shower.  While his was in the bath, he cast a glamour spell to hide the marks left by Draco.  Though Harry was outwardly horrified and embarrassed, inside he felt high, recalling how he got those marks.  He stood in front of the bathroom mirror and waved them away.
The professors watched as the act of solidarity unfolded before them.  Hagrid was the first professor to stand.  The rest joined in turn.
Startled by Molly’s original shout, Nikki’s eyes sprang open.  Before Bill could even make a move to get her, Draco put a protective arm around her. He whispered a gentle shush, encouraging the girl to fall back asleep. Her head bobbed briefly, then dropped into Draco’s chest.
Harry considered the honesty of her statement.  Did she really want to hear him go on about another man?  He had to admit, he’d been dying to tell someone of his wonderful night with Draco.  But who would want to listen?
“Mum’s trying to get us to plan a wedding before then,” Ron added.  He jerked a thumb toward Hermione.  “But
The Welcome Witch giggled. She was older than Harry, out of Hogwarts a year or two after he began. But young enough to flirt with him.
Harry was excited by the idea of spending the summer with Draco exploring the world.  He was envious that Ron and Hermione wouldn’t have to wait for their honeymoon. They were leaving for Italy that very night.  Hermione had been learning Italian and chose Rome so she could practice what she had learned. Ron didn’t care much either way.  He just wanted time away with her alone before they began their family.
Miranda raised an eyebrow.  “And how would you know?  I understand the two of you have been rivals since childhood.  Frankly, I’m surprised that you are so friendly.”
Draco once told him the scars hadn’t hurt his sex life any.  But it still bothered Harry to know he put them there.
Harry’s lips curled into a devilish grin.  “You look incredible sitting there atop me.  Feels incredible, too.”
“Well, close enough I suppose. Narcissus is a flower as well.  I believe it’s also called daffodil.” Andromeda raised her glass.  “Here’s to the children, all of them here, the future of the wizarding world.”
“You mean, you want to go through with it, even if the baby turns out to be Harry’s?”  Ginny was incredulous.
“I’ve never seen Malfoy so happy--come to think of it, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him happy at all,” commented Hermione.
“Why would you subject yourself to my company, when you clearly would prefer his?” She gestured subtly to the sandy haired man not far from their table.  “If I’m not mistaken, his attention has wandered your way as well.”
Ginny wasn’t sure how long they had been at it, but she was getting tired.  And although she was certain she could feel him hard through his trousers, Dean never pressed to go any further than kissing.
It was his eyes.  Grey, like Draco’s.  And nearly the same shape.  It was still like looking into a mirror for Draco.  He was desperately afraid that Harry would look into those eyes and see the best of what Draco could be.  Without all the baggage.
want. You seem to be the only one unsure about it.”  He lightly grasped Harry’s chin, his piercing grey eyes holding Harry’s gaze.  “I want you.  You need to decide whether or not you want me.”
The pair thanked the elves once more and left the kitchens.  Once out, Draco scanned the hallway for anyone else, then removed his shirt.
‘Yeah, I guess it would be better if you went.  I don’t think I’d be much help.  I’m not so good with the little ones.”
“Yes.  I wasn’t really considering the plans we have for the future.  I think you’d be great running your own potions shop.”
Harry smiled a little to himself.  He knew it was unfair for him to ask Draco to share his feelings while he still wavered.  But it sure felt good to hear.
“Same here,” Harry said.  “Especially this stuff,” he grinned as he scooped out some lo mein onto his plate.
“The sign a little way back said it was an hour from that point. So, I’d guess from here it’s about forty minutes.”
Harry looked at his hand, then at his cock.  He had only pleasured Draco with two fingers up until that point.  That didn’t quite measure up to Harry’s erect appendage, either in length or girth.  He worried that the experience would be unpleasant for his lover.
Looking at his mantle clock, Harry nodded.  “I didn’t realize it was that time already.  I’ll walk with you.”
“Well, it wouldn’t have been my first choice for Harry, but . . .  don’t we always say we just want our friends and family to be happy?  Harry looks happier than I’ve seen him in a long time.”
Harry’s shoulders slumped.  “Draco, I just . . . why are you still so insecure?  Don’t I show you how much I love you?  Do I not say it enough?”
“Mother has filled me in, regarding what she remembers, or was told.  I’d like to hear your side,” Draco said.
Harry sat in silence trying to grasp the deeper meaning of what Draco told him. He frowned.  “So, you thought all this was just a spell?  Are you saying that you don’t really care for me?”
“I got an Outstanding in the Care of Magical Creatures,” Pansy defended herself.  “I’ve gotten a position at Magical Menagerie for the summer.  Then I’ll go from there to be a breeder on my own.”
“After almost three months, they’re finally on the same schedule” Draco said.  “Well, nearly,” he joked, looking at his sleeping daughter.
Harry gestured for him to sit between his spread legs.  He did, resting his back on Harry’s chest while the Gryffindor stroked his hair.
“Hey, I didn’t eat any more than you,” Ron protested.  “Maybe more than Malfoy, definitely more than Mione, but not more than you.”
“Harry, please.  We need to consider all that’s happened and give it some good thought before we say and do things we can’t take back.”
“Being here, at Hogwarts with you has brought up all the old emotions.  More than that, getting to know you has only reaffirmed my feelings.  So, it may seem sudden to you, but for me, it’s been years.”
“I’ve got to have you right now,” Harry breathed, already hard in his own pants and threatening to burst out.
“There’s nothing to say.  You were right before.  She’s perfect just as she is.”  Harry hugged Draco.  “I’m glad.  You’re too handsome not to have one of them look like you.”
“So, how long has this been going on?  And why didn’t you ever tell us, Harry?  And why did you let me set you up with my friends?  And, oh, poor Althea.”
“Don’t get up,” Harry said and leaned over to kiss Draco goodbye. The kiss was a tease, as they both wished it could last much longer, not to mention progress further. Before pulling away completely, Harry mussed up Draco’s hair a bit.
“It’s an old muggle saying. And it means that, instead of retaliating against those injustices you feel, live your life to the fullest.  Don’t let them bring you down.  You have come a long way in the past year, Draco. Keep moving forward. Don’t let people such as Terry Boot bring you down.”
Harry sighed.  “I know it’s frustrating for you.  It is for me as well.  But I’m still not sure I’m ready.”
“No, it wasn’t about Voldemort.”  Harry waved off the concerned looks.  “It’s nothing.  But I think I’ll skip Charms this morning and go back to bed.  Would you mind telling Flitwick I’m sick?”
Justin was left standing awkwardly on his own.  He made his way to the refreshment table, thinking it would give him something to do with his fidgety hands.
Harry restrained himself for as long as he could after removing the wards from the entrance gate.  The moment Draco crossed the threshold, Harry replaced the wards and rushed at him.  Taking Draco by surprise, he nearly knocked the Slytherin over, hugging him.
“Father,” Draco whispered.  “Just hand it over.  Protesting will make it look as though you’ve got something to hide.”
Draco’s eyes widened, and Arthur cleared his throat, to steer the conversation back on its course. “So, why Greece, Harry?”
“Fuck.  And you didn’t think you’d done enough,” Harry panted.  “I’m not going to be able to get that damn ring on at this point.”
“Are you sure you’re all right?” Draco asked.  He bent down to pick up the Liquorice Wands that fell.  Harry tried to bend down to help, but his knee gave out. Reacting swiftly, Draco reached out and caught him before he fell. “We should get you to Madame Pomfrey.”
A feeling, like a stab to the heart, overtook Harry while he watched. He glanced around the room, noting that not only the girls, but the men in the room seemed to be enraptured by Draco’s voice.
“Good evening Minerva,” Harry said when they got there.  He picked up two cups of punch and handed one to Draco.
“I love you.  And you’re going to need help.  And Harry has already said he’s not going to marry you.”
“Are his best friends,” Harry reminded her.  “Now, unless you all want us to stop hanging around you, we all need to be at least civil.”
“I actually went to the party hoping to get your wand again.” She bit her lip and waited for his response.
“Then it looks as though it’s a toss-up between the last two potentials,” Draco said.  “And we don’t agree.  So, how do we solve this?”
Draco accepted it, snapped the stem off and placed it in the lapel of his white leather jacket.  He tossed the stem over his shoulder.  “May I have this dance?” he leered.
“True,” Harry conceded. “I am looking forward to seeing your little bum all tanned.  But really, I don’t see why having children should stop people from going on holiday. We’ll just choose places that are kid friendly.”
The pair of them burst out laughing.  They continued to laugh as they walked to the Gryffindor table and sat down.  When they finally composed themselves, they noticed Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Dean all gawking.
“Yes, it seems I do. But you’re the one who dropped his trousers first.  Not to mention the ropes . . .”
“Mmm,” Draco involuntarily groaned. He was finding it increasingly difficult to control his desire to pounce on Harry.
“Thank you, Mother,” Draco leaned and hugged his mother.  His hand shook slightly as he took Harry’s.  The two apparated to the hospital straightaway.
“Well, Claire is just a friend,” Harry started.  “And as far as Ginny goes, we broke up mutually.  I do love her . . . like a sister.  I tried to get involved with girls when I was younger.  It never worked out.  This must seem sudden to you, but I just never mentioned any of the boys I was interested in.”
They began walking up the staircase to their chambers. Rather than stop on the second floor, Harry continued to walk up.
“Harry please, you have to understand,” Draco begged.  “I had feelings for you before the game even began.  You didn’t even know you’re gay until after we had been paired twice.  I was scared.”
“Not to mention that you’d have to confess your orientation to her.  Unless you can keep it a complete secret.  But we all know how well secrets are kept,” Draco said, remembering how difficult it was to keep his relationship with Harry a secret. “And if you tell her, you may as well tell your family.”
Thanks to a new calming draught Draco brewed for him, Harry drifted off again. He couldn’t afford to lose sleep this week.  Not with the Potions contest coming up.  Not if he and Draco were going to beat Hermione and Ron.  Or Ginny and Blaise.  More than that, he didn’t want to let his new partner down.  No matter what dreams Harry had about him.
“Weasley?  Hmm.” Draco drank his shot quickly.  “You have to think several moves ahead, anticipate what the other person is going to do.”
Ron only huffed.  It was one thing for the boys to see one another in their pants. It was far different seeing Harry’s lover removing his clothing.
Harry moved the jumper, and a few curses later, Draco did feel slightly warmer. Or rather, not quite so cold.
Ron grumbled.  He knew Hermione was right.  He liked it so much better when Harry was dating Ginny.  The four of them got on so well, it was easy.  Adding Malfoy to their group was going to be difficult.
“They were embracing.  And they were alone in the Potions room, but they weren’t working on a potion.  The boy said he was in love with him,” Knox insisted.  “I’m not making it up.  I’ll submit my memory to the Pensieve if you want.  You know for yourself how much time he’s spent with the boy.”
Immediately, Harry latched his lips onto Draco’s, kissing him feverishly.  His hands groped and squeezed Draco’s arse while he ground against him.
“I realize that Harry is an only child because his parents passed before they could have another, but why is it so many wizarding couples have only one? I am an only child, as are you, and several of our former classmates.  If childrearing is so wonderful, why doesn’t everyone have seven children, like the Weasleys?”
Leaning forward once more, Harry captured Draco’s mouth this time. Again, it was relatively short, lips just hardly open.  Not even worthy of the word snog.  But it was enough to get the curiosity out of their systems.
Taking a handful of floo powder, Harry gave his address and disappeared. Hermione stood staring at the green flames for a moment before turning to Ron.
“Molly,” Harry grinned.  “Thanks for having us.”  Harry wrapped his arms around his surrogate mother and squeezed.
“It’s not like you’re missing much,” Draco snickered. “What can she possibly do besides sleep and shite?”
“Really?  There’s something relaxing about holding a baby.  Are you certain you don’t want to?  It’ll be good practice.”
“You should read more of it.  It’s lovely.  I never knew Severus was such a romantic.  There are only one or two entries that might make you blush again.”
“Then you should feel fabulous right now,” joked Harry.  He moaned, and moved his hips to meet Draco’s stroking.
“Slander.” Pansy teased.  She leaned forward as if to tell a secret, even though it was only the two of them in the room.
“Yes! Real food.”  She quickly unwrapped the sandwich and began to eat.  “The food they serve in the rooms is horrid.  I don’t know why they can’t just give me something from the cafeteria all the time.”
“And what about the girls?  There were more than two, that’s for sure.  And you didn’t seem to consider it cheating on them either.”
Just in case, he decided to give it a full hour.  When he felt the charms being disturbed, Harry breathed a sigh of relief.
Blushing, Harry put the diary down. “I don’t know how appropriate that would be. It was just strange to read about his . . . less than platonic thoughts about my mother.”
The unspoken words were deafening.  But it was much too soon for either of them to suggest marriage.
“So, do your friends know you’re here?” Harry picked up a piece of cheese, sniffed it, then discarded it because he was thought it might give him bad breath.  Instead, he pulled a small clump of grapes and began eating them.
Miss Gwilt came into the room, as she normally did a patient’s room–loudly. She had no regard for the need for sleep. When a patient was due his potion, he was due his potion. She nearly dropped it, however, when she saw an extra body in Draco Malfoy’s bed.
Harry cut her off, “He knew why I said it. He knew it was just a guilty conscience. And besides, Draco . . . Malfoy didn’t mean it. He was a desperate man grasping at something–absolution? I don’t know what. It’s done.”
“Thank you.  For all of this,” he said.  “I know it couldn’t have been easy to open your home to . . . um, people you wouldn’t normally entertain.”
“I’m disappointed we didn’t get to meet the players like Ginny offered, but I’m glad she’s all right.  I’ll have to send her a get well note.  Would you mind if we stopped at an owlry before we eat?”
With that, Harry turned to leave. “Let me know when you’re ready to grow up.”  He stormed out, leaving Draco to fume on his own.
“Supper’s on dears,” Molly appeared next to them.  “Make sure you get enough to eat Harry.”  She looked Hermione up and down.  “You as well, young lady.”
On impulse, he leaned forward and kissed her.  It wasn’t anything special or particularly long. It was really sort of stiff. When he pulled back, she was clearly stunned.
“You know what I mean.” He paused, then decided to tell her about his dreams.  “I haven’t been sleeping well because I’ve been having dreams. Nightmares, really.  And it wasn’t just the other night.  It’s been going on for a couple of weeks”
“Yes. The Death Eaters.”  Olivia moved her finger to the top of the line.  “Right here is where you end up.  It’s a vastly different path.”
“Well played,” Lucius’ Interrogator said.  “Not that it was really necessary.  There was nothing in those parchments that could have kept the hearing from ending any other way.”
“Well, I wish I hadn’t told Madam Pince to fuck off. She’ll never let me reserve books for my students again.”
Hermione giggled, feeling giddy from the champagne, and the company.  She gazed adoringly at her man.
“You’re welcome,” Harry looked down at the report on his desk.  He’d have to change a few things now.  He decided the report could wait.  “If you’ll excuse me, I have to be at Ron and Hermione’s for supper.”
Harry sat at the kitchen table thinking back on the evening. It hadn’t gone exactly as planned.  Rose looked up at him as she drank.  She was beautiful and sweet. And a lot more work than he thought she’d be.
“Well, yeah.  Theo would have offered to let me watch again.  And Draco probably would have told me to get over it. The gits.  They think I’m fat anyway.”
“Uh, well, maybe I’ll just tell Mione,” Harry said.  “I don’t think Ron is ready for that sort of information.”
With that, Draco sat back down, unable to directly look at any of the faces now gaping at him.  Never had any of them seen a Malfoy show remorse or regret, especially in regard to their family.
Gasping sharply, Millicent turned her body away from him and reopened the book.  She would never have admitted it but hearing him moan and grunt as he pleasured himself, made her feel a bit randy herself.  Several times, she peered over her shoulder to watch.  He was well enough endowed to make her rethink her earlier assessment of the Hufflepuff. However, his current behavior was a deal breaker.  Of course, it didn’t prevent her from taking peeks.
“No.  I’d rather get toothpaste in my hair occasionally than do this alone.  Weekdays are so lonely now.”
Harry could see her eyes glistening in the dimly lit chamber. “Then I’ll honor him by using it wisely,” he told her.  “Thank you, Professor.”  He forced himself to blink back his own tears.
Harry reached for the buttons on Draco’s shirt, but was stopped in his tracks by the sensation of Draco’s mouth around his cock.
Sighing, Draco crossed his arms over his chest. He could see Blaise trying to come up with some outrageous request.
“Yes, he’s more than willing.  I believe he and Blaise have had encounters before.” He drank his shot and immediately threw out his first question.  “Do you have more insight into why you and the Weasley girl broke up?”
Harry released Draco’s hand and got up from the chair.  He really wanted to kiss Draco.  Even if it was just on his forehead.  Though Madame Pomfrey had seen him holding Draco’s hand, Harry wasn’t willing to reveal any more of their relationship.
“Billings?  Harry, that was a little underhanded.”  Ron frowned.  “I can’t believe the old git told you about Malfoy’s deal.  You know he can’t keep a secret.”
Shaking his head, Draco smirked.  “Nothing.  My father keeps, I mean kept, white peacocks.  They’re the ultimate pureblood status symbol.”  He rolled his eyes.  “Quite rare and expensive.  But if I moved back into the Manor, I would have gotten rid of them.  For some reason, though, Mother loves them, so now she’ll be able to keep them.”
She turned. “It’s actually Weasley. But I think under the circumstances, you should call me Hermione.”
Very carefully lifting Draco’s shirt and jumper, Harry examined Draco’s torso. There was a nasty bruise on his left side toward his belly. Harry was by no means proficient in anatomy, but he knew there were probably important organs in there that had been damaged, causing the pain.
Draco lay down next to Harry and laced his fingers behind his head.  His eyes were drawn to his bare forearm and he stared at it while he and Harry talked.
The conversation seemed to repeat over and over, until Harry saw a lone bubble form at the bottom of the cauldron and finally said, “Now.”
“No, we wouldn’t,” Draco said, turning serious.  “Even if we found each other attractive enough to shag, it wouldn’t have lasted.  I changed because of the things that happened during and after the war, mostly the bad things.  I know it sounds terrible not to wish them away, but I don’t.”
Pansy laughed. “I’m not suggesting you don’t sneak out.  I’m just saying you have to be smart about it,” she grinned.
“No, and I won’t.  Partly because it truly doesn’t matter.  Partly because, if I don’t know who they are, I can’t hex them.”
sorry. And I’m sorry it’s taken me so long to apologize.  It was supposed to be a prank.  That’s all.  Honestly, I don’t care what you do in private.  I just went along with him.” He jerked a thumb in Boot’s direction. “I won’t be making that mistake again.”
“And you’re sure he said everything’s okay?” Harry asked for about the tenth time. They settled into a booth at one of Harry and Ron’s regular pubs. Normally Draco would have thought it odd for a lunch companion to sit next to him rather than across. But Harry had been doting on him for the past several days. So, it didn’t surprise him. But he would draw line at Harry cutting his meat for him.
“It’s nothing, really,” assured Draco.  “Are you planning on staying tonight?” He kissed Harry’s neck, giving it a small nibble.  His hand wandered to the front of Harry’s trousers.
Finally, Draco sat up.  “I’m ready.  Accio, lube.”  He poured a generous amount into his hand and stroked Harry’s achingly hard cock, coating it thoroughly.  “Harry, do the spell,” he breathed.
“Draco knows French.  And she doesn’t know that much about his personal past.  I suppose she’s a safe person to talk to for him.” The blond glanced over at Harry and Hermione and smiled.
Feeling the need to defend Draco, Harry replied, “Draco and I have spent the past couple of months getting to know one another.  Really talking, sometimes about things that happened during the war.  I understand him a lot better now.  I understand why he did the things he did, what his life was truly like, and how much he regretted--”
Draco nodded. He kept his eyes on Harry’s face as Harry focused his attention on Draco’s legs and feet. He looked more nervous than Draco felt.
“I hadn’t thought of that.  It’s been easy for me to keep relationships private.  Mainly because I’ve had so few.  Ginny was my last public relationship.”
“You’re right, I’m sorry.  From now on, I’ll tell you everything.”  Harry held Draco close, then stepped back.  “But wait, why are you here?”
“Sometimes people aren’t always certain what the truth is.  People lie to themselves all the time,” Draco explained.  “This journal is not for the faint of heart.  It will be brutally honest with you.  You may learn things about yourself you don’t want to admit, so take care in what you write.”
“I’m just saying . . . I don’t think a straight guy is going to be that close to a gay guy without a little something going on.”
Harry stopped walking. “But I couldn’t care less what he thinks. I was simply being polite. I’m not the least bit interested in him anymore.”
“Oh.  Brilliant,” Harry smiled.  It gratified him to know that Knox had taken an interest in pursuing friendships outside of Hogwarts.  “Have fun, then.”
Hermione was loath to admit that she was also growing tired of studying.  So, she sighed dramatically for effect.
The Healer waved him off.  “Everything is fine.  She was born well within normal parameters.  You can take her home in a couple of days.”  The Healer grinned.  “I would go home and rest up.”
Upon returning to his own office, Harry reached into his desk for a report form.  He took out a quill and began filling in the document. The general information came to him effortlessly.  He was used to filing reports.
“Yes, it does feel different.  Your last two questions didn’t make me want to give a reply.  I’m answering now because I want to.”
Draco nodded and proceeded up the stairs.  Knox was ahead of him, moving slowly to allow Draco to catch up.  He turned and blocked Draco’s path.
“Uh,” Hermione started to protest, but Daphne grabbed her by the arm and pulled her into the girl’s dormitory.
Suddenly, Harry’s stomach dropped and his heart began to pound.  It was only a piece, but he remembered something from that night that had been eluding him.
“My fault,” Harry interrupted,  “I should have owled or something first.  I didn’t consider that you may have been . . . um, hosting your, um, boyfriend or whatever.”
Draco suggested they rinse off and put on some bathrobes. They’d need a bit of recovery time if they planned on finally shagging. Neither one of them anticipated ending quite so quickly when they started. Draco offered to make tea and serve it in the bedroom while Harry made himself comfortable. It was an easy task, on Draco’s hunter green and gold satin covered bed.
Frowning, Harry sat and pouted a moment before finally asking Ron, “So, what made you think I fancied blokes?”
They continued, until breathing through his nose no longer provided enough oxygen for Draco. Concerned he may pass out, he broke off the kiss and touched his forehead to Harry’s, panting.
Harry stormed out of the classroom without his shirt or glasses.  “Bugger,” he hissed when he became aware that the dark wasn’t the only reason he had trouble seeing.  In the time it took for Harry to decide whether or not to retrieve his glasses, Pansy caught up to him, bra on, but blouse undone, her wand lighting the way.  She held out his forgotten items.
“Harry,” Draco began.  “I was going to say, ‘for a long time’.  I’ve never really been around children.  I don’t particularly like them.  I can barely tolerate the First and Second Years,” He tried to laugh, but it came out as more of a cough.
Draco leaned his head back on the green and black leather sofa and closed his eyes.  It wasn’t Potter’s fault.  Draco said more than he wanted to, and Potter wasn’t one to let things go easily.  The moment was gone.  They had been getting on like any other students would have until Draco felt vulnerable and had his little outburst.  Why couldn’t he have just admitted that he would like for them to be friends?  He could feel that Harry was watching him, but he pretended to fall asleep. In a few hours, the charm would wear off and they could go their separate ways again.
Draco frowned at first, until he realized she was including Harry. He squeezed her hand. “I can make the arrangements if you’d like,” he offered.
Harry looked at the board.  “Oh.”  He retracted his piece and mulled over his next move.  “Why are you being so nice to me?”
“Come on, you can tell me.  I’ll tell you what happened on my fabulous date,” Harry offered.  “I’ll even go first.”
Gesturing to the tie pin, or rather pins, now that they had separated, Harry told him the story.  He explained that he bought it because it reminded him of Draco, and he thought it would look wonderful on him.  Harry never dreamed that it would actually open for him.
Harry greeted Margherita and asked how she was doing, if there was anything they could do for her.  Draco, however, went immediately to the bassinet to look at the child.
“No,” Draco shook his head.  “He said basically the same thing you did.  But I shouldn’t be surprised that the Ministry keeps tabs on former criminals.”
Glenda Chittock tried her best to steer the conversation back to the topic of Harry’s love life, but he stood his ground.  Instead he regaled them with stories of his adventures with Hermione and Ron.  It only served to fuel Draco’s foul mood.  After sweets, the group retired to a small area in front of the fireplace for a cocktail.  Pulling Draco aside, Harry apologized for almost giving away their relationship.
“I don’t think we’re going to make it to the shower,” Draco whispered. His hand wound down Harry’s body, skirting his cock, but cupping his bollocks.
He cradled Harry’s head and leaned him back onto his pillow.  He sat observing Harry.  Was the Gryffindor always like this when he was drunk?  Was he deluded into thinking Draco was some girl?
Harry couldn’t help but smile.  “Well, yes,” he laughed.  “But if you can convince Ginny to work with Zabini, you could cozy up to Ron.”  Harry looked around again to make sure no one was listening in.  “There’s a project coming up.  I get the impression it’s a big one.  Slughorn accidentally told me.  Please Hermione, will you do this?  I’ll even help you with your project if you want.”
Harry watched Draco as he tipped his head back slightly to get to the bottom of his Sherry glass--his second one of the evening.  Draco’s Adam’s apple glided up and down, leading Harry’s eyes to the hollow of his neck.  The top button of his shirt was undone, enticing Harry to look further.  The candle light further romanticized Draco’s features.  And Harry was so caught up in his observations that he hadn’t taken notice that Draco had moved closer until he began speaking.
Around seven-twenty, Harry was just finishing up the fifth paragraph of their paper. It took him a full twenty minutes as he struggled to make his handwriting as neat as Draco’s.  A throat cleared in front of him.  He looked up to see Draco standing with his black bag strung on his shoulder.
“Because, it’s the gracious thing to do.  Besides, the Grangers did provide a fair amount of food. And Molly Weasley prepared the wedding cake. And they all helped to decorate.”
Looking confident and at ease, Ron walked into the sitting room with a chubby Rose on his hip, while he carried a butter beer in one hand.
Draco stepped inside and immediately began to snog the other professor.  His hands made quick work of the buttons on Harry’s shirt, then moved down to his trousers.
“It must be a girl thing.  Pansy’s constantly talking up some bloke or another to me.  She says she only wants me to be happy.”
“Those gits probably didn’t even send an owl,” Blaise suggested.  “They’re just trying to stir up more trouble.”
Making his way back up, Anthony nuzzled her hairy patch and kissed her belly.  The anticipation of his kisses reaching her breasts caused Tracey to arch up, trying to get him there more quickly.  A long, satisfied moan escaped her lips when he did.  He suckled her left breast, rolling his tongue around the nipple before moving on to the other.  Her body responded with a generous amount of lubrication in anticipation of intercourse.
He reached into the bassinet and scooped her up into his arms.  The baby gave out a big shuddered sigh but didn’t otherwise wake. “She’s perfect,” Draco said with tears threatening.
“Come on.  You have to dance.  That’s the whole point.”  Draco continued to cavort around Harry, tugging on Harry’s hand to encourage him to join in.
“Besides, this isn’t exactly private,” Harry said.  “I have to put my packages away.  Come on.”  He took hold of the Slytherin’s hand and led him to Gryffindor Tower. “Oh, and I got us some treats.”
As soon as Hermione left his office, Harry left for Shacklebolt’s office.  The current Minister for Magic requested to debrief Harry himself.  They spent more time than Harry would have liked going over the plan to remove and catalogue items from the Manor.  That was a job for a different department.  But Shacklebolt wanted Harry involved in the operation, given his experience with Dark magic.  Of course, Harry agreed, partly to ensure that Draco’s things be treated with care and respect.  Partly to force himself to go back to Malfoy Manor and move on.  Kingsley invited Harry to supper with him that night, but Harry thanked him and told him of his other plans.  By the time he left the Minister’s office, it was past three o’clock.
The pair left the Ministry and apparated back to Malfoy Manor. Narcissa greeted them with champagne.
“Hm, did I say that?” Draco smirked and bent over to turn on the faucet for the tub, something that only added to Harry’s arousal.  “Lemon lavender, oatmilk calendula, or ambergris?”
“And what if one of Draco’s students was looking for him?  Would he or she know where to look?”  She paused.  “On second thought, as the two of you aren’t married, the students should not think to look here.”
“My father’s family was less accepting,” Hermione continued.  “We don’t talk about it with them.  I think they like to pretend I’m not a witch at all.”
“Well, for starters, he wants out of prison now.  Which, really isn’t a problem, if it ended there.”
Following the direction Fenrir had last been seen, Harry and Draco cautiously walked along the dreary hallway.
“You’re serious?  You really announced it at supper?” Draco questioned.  “I thought you were joking.”
“Your father was distraught. Apparently, he sat by my side every day, going home to check on you at night.  The house elves were put in charge of taking care of you.”
Putting a subtle hand on Harry’s arm, Draco responded calmly.  “It’s all right.  She’s simply looking out for you.”  He turned his attention to Hermione.  “My intentions are simple. I want Harry to be happy.  I’d like to be responsible for that.”
Thinking about it, Harry had to agree.  “Maybe I can tell her his story, what he really sacrificed during the wars.”
Harry rolled his eyes.  He’d never heard that, but it seemed ridiculous to Harry.  But then he had another thought.
He smiled, but he knew she couldn’t really understand. “You’re right,” he said, mainly to placate her.
Euan and Edmund burst out laughing.  Neither had taken any notice of Harry’s pants.  But obviously, Cicely had.
“You would go with me?”  Draco slowly sank back down into the pillows with Harry.  “He won’t exactly be welcoming.”
They finished filling out the multitude of paperwork and waited for the selection coordinator. After waiting more than thirty minutes, a woman finally came in.
“If one more person bumps into me, I’m going to turn them into a toad,” Draco grumbled as he and Harry walked through the crowd at Thorpe Park.
“I gave him a pretty good right hook.  I didn’t even take the time to draw my wand,” Harry said.  “I grabbed his shirt to hold him in place and gave it to him.”  He thought Draco would be pleased, but the blond stood expressionless.
“Okay,” Millicent said, looking down at the flowers. The first flowers she ever got from a boy. “I’ll go with you to Hogsmeade.”
He found himself standing off in a corner with Professors Trelawney and Flitwick.  Trelawney had grown butterfly wings, but otherwise didn’t appear much different.  Although, Harry thought her large glasses gave her appropriate bug eyes. Flitwick was dressed as some sort of animal-- a dog or possibly a wolf.
Harry closed his eyes for a moment before his confession.  “I can’t help it.”  He laughed.  “In fact, I almost ran about the castle looking for you after breakfast.”
Draco allowed Harry to put his arms back around him.  They hugged for a long time.  Harry thought he should have realized what a stressful day it had been for his husband.  While Harry was very much at home in the Burrow, Draco felt a stranger-- someone who was being judged. On top of that, he had to head off his father’s comments before they turned to insults. Though Lucius most likely thought himself perfectly charming.
“Come say hello to Grandmama first,” Draco called to his seven-year-old son.  It was difficult to deny him with his friends standing right there.
Ron gazed down at her.  Hermione looked beautiful.  Her hair was swept up, tiny curls framed her delicate features.  Even with minimal make-up, her face was radiant.  Ron thought she was about the most beautiful girl he’d ever seen.  And she was with him.  She wanted him.
Timidly, he thanked her and returned the compliment.  Sitting awkwardly, naked still, neither knew precisely what to do next.
Teasing with his tongue, Harry steadily sucked up and down while his finger kept a similar pace in and out.  His other hand wandered down to his own cock.  The sounds Draco made added to Harry’s arousal, his desire to cum becoming more urgent.  He picked up his pace.
While their guests were enjoying hors d’oeuvres, Harry, Draco, Ron and Hermione were busy in the garden getting their photographs taken.
When the train arrived at Hogsemeade Station, the students disembarked and made their way to the carriages.  Hagrid was there to greet them, as usual.
Draco placed his hands on either side of Harry’s face and kissed him. As willing as he had been to move into the small flat, he was grateful Harry had changed his mind.
Once out of the room, Harry wasn’t sure what to do or where to go.  He didn’t think Draco would go back to his House. His first thought was to try the Astronomy Tower.  It took him a while to get all the way up there after starting off in the dungeons.  He had plenty of time to think about what happened and what he wanted to do about it.
“You didn’t really think I could go to bed without finding out what happened, did you?” she smirked, rubbing her eyes.  “What time is it anyway?”
“About not being ready for a baby,” Draco clarified.  “You know, your dreams never showed them as babies.”
“Can’t you leave those trousers on for a little while longer?”  Harry blushed as he very obviously glanced at Draco crotch.
Draco sniggered.  “Public drama, I can handle.  Or have you forgotten all about my family’s trials?”
“I already have,” Draco growled and pressed himself up against Harry’s side.  His erection was hard as Harry’s hip bone as he rocked on it.
When their food arrived, they spoke about Hogwarts.  He hadn’t remembered her.  She told him that she was a Hufflepuff three years his junior, and she had been rather shy.  So she wasn’t surprised that he didn’t know her.
“What?” Harry asked quietly. Draco wasn’t following his advice about keeping quiet anyway. And maybe talking would keep him alert and alive. He supposed he may as well let Draco say whatever was so damned important.
Harry sat down on Draco’s settee.  “I made it clear that there will never be anything between me and him.  He’s going to stop trying to make you look bad--especially to me.  If he doesn’t, then I won’t have anything more to do with him.”
“Before you say anything, I’m sorry,” Draco began. “I trust you.  And if you tell me there’s nothing for me to worry about, then I believe you.”  It was most difficult for him to swallow his pride.  But more difficult for him to imagine losing Harry.
“I’m sorry Harry. It’s just so loud and garish. And frankly, the concession workers are frighteningly friendly, and the people in costume freak me out a bit.”
“After all that’s happened with your father, I wasn’t certain if you would ever come home,” she confessed as she grasped his hands.
The sight of hundreds of pairs of eyes on him gave Draco a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. “What’s going on?” he whispered.
“I don’t know,” he said wearily.  “It’s all too much.  This whole business with my father.  Worrying about my mother.  Worrying about you.”
Draco laughed out loud at Harry’s comment.  “I hope she’s better at it than Wand Match for Lonely Wizards.”
Having a few moments to himself, Harry sat in a wicker chair on the balcony of his and Draco’s bedroom.  He had to agree that the view was magnificent.  Not only were the grounds of the Manor expertly tended, the countryside beyond was breathtaking.  Gently rolling hills, fields of red poppies, and a picturesque village in the distance greeted Harry every morning.  Despite Draco’s distaste for the albino peacocks, Harry enjoyed watching them strut about the yard below among the gardens and the fountain, from which the sound of gently lapping water soothed Harry.  Occasionally, birds would frolic and swim in it and Harry longed to join them.  He could imagine Narcissa’s face, however, if he ever actually jumped in, and chuckled to himself.   A gentle breeze blew, carrying with it the scent of the burnt orchids, which had just begun to blossom.  Harry particularly liked them for their light lemon fragrance.
Taking Draco by the hand, Harry zigzagged his way through the mass to the entrance of the Hall.  Once through, they were able to speak in a more normal volume.  Although Harry’s ears were ringing just a bit.
Pansy rolled her eyes, along with several others.  “Because everyone will be paired up by the time half the wands are chosen.  There won’t be any need.  For example, if you choose my wand, I’m yours for the night.  You then Accio your own wand.  Two wands are then spoken for.  Understand?”
“That if the Healer can figure out how I did it, maybe I can drive the dark magic out of the remaining Death Eaters.”
Draco grabbed onto his arm as Harry tried to walk away.  “I was only kidding.  I guess I’m not very good at it.  I’ll try to be more thoughtful.”
Cummins lifted a parchment, read a passage, then looked at the two in front of him. “What were you doing when it happened? It doesn’t say here.  Were you trying to perform a marriage ceremony yourselves?”
Harry leaned in and gave Draco a quick, tight-lipped kiss, not particularly wanting to share his morning breath.
Harry and Ron walked back from the marsh in silence.  As an Auror, Ron knew when to ask questions and when to keep quiet to get information out of someone.  Though Harry wasn’t a witness or a criminal, the tactics worked on him as well.
“I was just being friendly.  He was staring over here again, so I waved.”  She smiled to herself as she picked up a spoonful of peas.
Draco, however, felt something different.  At first, he felt a nudge at his magic. It built slowly, causing a pleasant tingle throughout his body. But as Harry pulled him tighter, he began to feel pain.  Dull, at first, then coming into focus.  It seemed to emanate from his extremities. His fingers and toes felt as though they had fallen asleep. As Harry’s moans grew louder, the prickly sting traveled along Draco’s legs and arm.  Eventually, the pain centered itself on his left forearm.  He cried out, but not in ecstasy, as it may have sounded to Harry.
“They all seem happy to me,” Draco justified. “And who’s to say they won’t be happy in the future?  Ginny and Dean are getting married for crying out loud.”
“Why not?” he grinned.  “You seem to have shagged just about every other boy here.  Don’t you want to shag me?”  He knew Pansy’s reputation as well as anyone.  She was a flirt, but not a tease.  Pansy had had many of the older boys at Hogwarts.  Most of Gryffindor eluded her though.
“Technically, I only cheated on one girl.  I had broken things off with the others before hopping into bed with you.  And again, I wasn’t in love.”
“I wasn’t aware that I was the subject of this hearing,” Draco said.  “The burden of proof is not on me.”
“You have witnesses that saw one kiss.  One very small kiss.”  Harry clenched his fists.  Arguing was going to get him nowhere.  “Look, I have a proposition for you.  I’ll give you an interview.  An exclusive interview.”
“A fortune cookie,” Harry answered.  “I don’t really like to eat them, but they have a fortune inside.”
“You didn’t discourage him enough either.  He’s constantly talking about your heroic past.  The way he looks at you so adoringly. You act so modest, but I think you love it.”  Draco covered his mouth and gasped.  “Wait, I didn’t mean that,” he said quickly, but too late.  His sluggish brain hadn’t been able to stop his mouth.
Hesitating on his decision, Harry thought about his choices.  He could use the courage of fire whiskey, but the champagne was a more elegant choice.  But they weren’t really celebrating anything.
“It’s a good thing, isn’t it? Me getting all better?” Draco grinned. “Or did you like me better as the invalid needing you to tend to my every need?”
Draco managed to make the other men look bad however, by offering to help clear and clean the dishes.  Ginny recruited Harry and Ron to help as well.  In the meantime, Molly brought out a large cake and several plates of biscuits and pastries.
“Teach me how to make my hair blue.  It seems fitting if we’re both sporting something blue,” Draco suggested.  He paused and grinned.  “It appears we’ve just planned our second date.”
Draco’s brow furrowed.  “But you said you talked to Ron.  Surely, he was happy to tell you it’s all in your head and that you should break up with me straightaway.”
Ron managed to convince Harry to give it another year in the Ministry.  But then the following year, Harry applied for a position at Hogwarts.  The professor who had been teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts for the previous five years was ready to move on.  Headmistress McGonagall practically leaped at the opportunity to have Harry back at Hogwarts. And Harry was glad to be back.
“Are you certain?  I think he’s just afraid to admit it.  I’m sorry, luv.  I have to go start the party.  Are you all right?”
“Do you still want to reserve those books?” she asked, gesturing to the volumes she had set aside for him.
“McGonagall made it very clear that we are not to be found in one another’s quarters after hours when we’re on duty.”
“Oh, my,” she winced.  “Didn’t get much sleep last night?”  She began to smile, then saw that he wasn’t.  In fact, he appeared fairly miserable.  “What happened?”
They proceeded to reminisce over some of the more successful stunts, which led to discussion of George and Fred’s legendary antics.
Harry blushed at the mention of Pansy.  If Draco saw, he spared Harry further embarrassment by not drawing attention to it.
Harry straightened up from sweeping the ground.  He rubbed his back, which ached a bit from hunching over all day. Draco walked to join him, book in hand.
All Harry could do was watch and try desperately not to cum himself.  He lost control when Draco cried out again, shooting a load of thick cum forward onto his own chest.  His cry was so loud that Harry was sure the entire castle must have heard.  Though normally rather vocal himself, Harry came with a heavy breath and a whimper.
“So, Ron.” Draco put his arm around his shoulder.  Ron hadn’t nearly enough to drink for that.  He gingerly removed the arm and scooted away a bit. “I hear you like to fly and play chess.  I like to fly and play chess.  Not at the same time, mind you. That would be stupid.”
“Um, I also wanted to tell you I had a good time at the dance.  Until you slapped me,” he laughed nervously.
It didn’t sit well with Draco.  He was raised to be a thoughtful guest, not one who simply stuck his name on a card from a truly thoughtful guest.  He had planned to bring the bottle of wine that he and Harry never opened on their first date.  But that wasn’t the same as a Christmas gift.
Smiling widely, Hermione nodded.  “I think we have time for one more stop.”  She linked her arm through his and they left the tavern to walk down the Alley toward their destination. It began snowing again, a bit harder than before.
Harry sat down across a table from the reporter, confident that he had protected himself well, despite Draco’s warning.  He vaguely recalled the interview Narcissa gave, but he knew it didn’t paint Draco’s mother in a favorable light.  Being well prepared gave Harry the advantage, as far as he was concerned.
She pulled away and looked at Harry.  It was the first time the two of them had come face to face since the forest.  Though technically, he didn’t actually see her that time.
“This is great.  Thanks.” Draco couldn’t help glancing around nervously.  He could feel the other Slytherins that were milling about, watching him and Harry while he ate.
“Well, then,” the clerk straightened herself up and smoothed out her hair.  “That’s another story.  For you the bracelet is only ten Galleons.”
The corner of Draco’s mouth raised.  “It wasn’t good.  It was bloody fantastic.”  He laughed.  “I might be walking a bit wonky tomorrow, though.”
“Nonsense, Harry,” McGonagall smiled.  “You look just fine.  I’ve always had an affinity for tartan plaids.”
Draco watched them as they went. It was hard for him to believe that his son was already seven.  When he and Harry had first contacted a surrogate witch service, he figured they would have one child on whom to lavish their attention.  And now they were anxiously awaiting the birth of their third.
“I don’t know, you look pretty stupid,” Harry joked.  “But seriously, you don’t have anything to say?”
Justin and his newly acquired dancing partner made their way through the crowd.  On the way, he saw Anthony and Tracey.  Justin gave him a thumbs up as he passed.
“Draco,” Harry called, but the blond was out the door and down the corridor before the second syllable was spoken.
“Draco, just let him go fishing,” Narcissa said after she hugged James.  “Little boys don’t want to hang out with the old folks.  They want to go off with their friends.”
“They didn’t tell, if that’s what you mean.  But they both got detention for a week.  Luckily, they were dressed and only got caught snogging,” Pansy told him.
As usual, Skeeter took what very few pieces of factual information she had and embellished greatly. There was an older photo of Harry and Draco, from Draco’s trial, where they briefly acknowledged one another.  The headline under it read Potter Gets Malfoy Off Again. She reported that Harry had been in the Leaky Cauldron with Draco, and that witnesses said they kissed.  However, the truth ended there.  Skeeter had the pair not only snogging furiously, but groping one another in the company of Harry’s friends and nearly shagging right there on the table for all to see.  She also exaggerated Draco’s lack of chivalry in standing up for the Chosen One when she confronted him.  She painted Draco as a submissive partner, going even so far as to insinuate that he was acting as a slave to Harry, alluding to her previous articles chronicling Draco’s love life.  The article went on to drag Ron into a love triangle, considering the way he defended Harry.
Satisfied that he was truly unrecognizable, Harry walked out of Gryffindor and made his way to the Great Hall.
“Professor Malfoy is doing a splendid job with a student who would otherwise fall through the cracks,” Harry defended.
“Actually, I wouldn’t mind going to Diagon Alley,” Draco chimed in.  “I need a few things at the stationery store.”
“You weren’t kidding, were you?” Draco laughed.  “But there was nothing wrong with that.  It was sexy.”  He flicked his wand at the mess and Vanished it.
“The son of a prominent Death Eater,” she added.  “Either way, it’s not going to sit well with either side.  There will be those that will feel it’s their business.  They will harass you, provoke you, and attempt to torment you.  Are you really ready for that?”
Nodding, Bill agreed. “He’s been nothing but a gentleman today.  Even his father wasn’t as much of a prick as I thought he’d be,” he laughed.
Dean and Ginny snacked while they sat on her bed and talked.  Summer plans to classes to failed romances were among the many topics they discussed.
Harry stood with a group of Gryffindors checking their names to a list.  He would be escorting six of them on their first trip to the little village.
His heart? Harry wondered. Was Draco really going to die? Until that point, he was certain he would not. Was this the last conversation they would ever have? Harry felt as though a part of him was breaking as well.
Ron addressed the rest of the Aurors and a couple of hit wizards along for the ride. “If he does anything out of line, kill him.”
The following morning, they floo called Ron and Hermione, who were more than happy to receive guests.  In fact, they seemed almost eager.
By the time Harry got back to Gryffindor, he had calmed down considerably.  Logically, he understood Draco’s motives and reasoning.  In a way, he wished Draco hadn’t told him any of it.  The doubts he was feeling were confusing him.  It was supposed to be a wonderful, magical night for them. Instead, it turned out to be their first
Pansy looked into his eyes.  She never could deny him anything.  The one time she did, she regretted it and probably would for the rest of her life.
The pair resumed walking to the Great Hall.  The corridors had thinned out, allowing the men to set a leisurely pace.
Hermione shrugged.  “I guess we’ll never know,” she answered, hoping to dissuade him from his curiosity.
“Yes.  It was a mess,” Harry told them.  “Professor Slughorn used the sixth floor quarters as his own.  Snape’s were pretty much abandoned.  Some of it was hard to go through.”  He decided for some reason to leave out the journal he and Draco came across.  He wanted to keep it private between only them.  “I  wish I had known the real Snape before he died.  I wish I’d thought better of him while I had the chance.”
Padma and Parvati walked in together, neither having secured dates.  In truth, most of the students had gone dateless.  Ginny and Dean had gone together, as well as Luna and Neville. And of course, Ron and Hermione, and Harry and Draco.  And a few others.  However, there was a certain amount of excitement, dancing and interacting with a mystery person, that the students enjoyed.
“Don’t misunderstand me,” Draco quickly replied.  “I’m not ashamed or anything.  But once the staff and students find out, it’ll be in the papers shortly after.  You’ve been very careful to keep your personal life out of the press.  And being associated with me will probably hurt your reputation.”
Hermione shifted in her spot uncomfortably.  She figured he was speaking not only about his homosexuality, but of his involvement in the war.
“He’s risen above that.  Skeeter is notorious for stretching the truth, even outright lying.  You’re a fool to give her any credibility.”  Harry sighed.  “Look, we both want the same thing-- for Draco to be safe and happy.”
“I don’t think he would mind me telling you.  Especially under the circumstances.  I also think you’ll find that people are more accepting than you believe.”
“You know I haven’t attended services since I was a school boy,” Draco retorted. It was an unspoken challenge for his hypocritical father to criticize him.
He frowned as he listened to the sounds coming from Harry’s room.  Draco didn’t deserve the former hero.  It wasn’t fair.  He tried to block it out and fall asleep, but his body betrayed him, becoming aroused by the muffled voices and creaking bed.
“What do you want me to say, Draco?  That I was a terrible father? That I wasn’t a strong enough man?  That I made dangerous choices for our family? I admit that to you. There are too many reasons to go into for why I made those choices. At the time, I thought they were the right choices.”
Harry’s mind wandered as he sat in the eerily quiet library.  He had arrived at seven and gotten out the books and parchment he and Draco had been using to write their essay on Bowman Wright.  The inventor of the Golden Snitch was one of the few wizards both boys agreed to research.
By the end of the day, Harry had decided to keep his interview with the Prophet after all.  He hoped Draco would understand.
Hermione was just then adding her graphorn.  She heard the professor and slowed it down, watching the color of the potion turn from rust to brilliant green.  “Done!” she called out.
Draco opened his mouth to retort.  But Harry was right.  He didn’t even know why he was jealous.  Perhaps because Knox’s branch of the family tree hadn’t brought shame to it.  Knox’s father wasn’t in Azkaban, and never once tried to do harm to Harry or his friends.  Knox wasn’t spoiled, though his family had money.  He was good-looking enough, and projected a clean cut version of Draco himself.  Draco wondered if Harry noticed any family resemblance.  It was probably the thing Draco hated most about Knox.
“I won’t be there.  I’m not allowed to bring Rose to that part of the hospital.  But the rest of Ron’s family is there,” Hermione told him.
Draco felt Harry tense up when he released the button on Harry’s jeans.  In an instant, the zipper was down and Draco’s right hand was working its way into Harry’s pants.
“What happened?”  Harry took the trunk from Draco’s hand.  “I was on my way to supper.  Are you hungry?”
Several minutes of the rhythmic movements brought them both close to climaxing.  Pansy’s moans became deeper, lower, almost growling.  Harry himself had begun to murmur as well.  The beat of the desk knickknacks banging together, the hum of Pansy’s moans and Harry’s grunts came together like a song.  A song sure to end on a high note.
“Yes, I can see that you’ve been training more,” Harry smiled. “Well, it’s paid off. Seems your team is on its way to contending in the next World Cup.”
Millicent watched him fidget, deciding how much she wanted to make him squirm.  She was miffed about the whole wanking in front of her incident.  But he’d apologized, which was more than she expected.  And she hated to admit it, but she did have a good time at the dance.  She just wasn’t sure she could swallow her pride.  Or harder still, take the ridicule of dating a Hufflepuff from her Housemates.  Dating?  She mentally shook her head.  He hadn’t even asked her out.  Maybe he was simply trying to be nice.  There weren’t too many boys queuing up to date Millicent.
Harry laughed and held out a small bag.  “I brought you some toffee and fudge.”  He knew Draco didn’t indulge in sweets very often, but when he did, those were his favorites.
“I’m not saying we’re going to be best friends or anything, but we should at least try to get along, shouldn’t we?” Hermione pointed out.
Sitting quietly in his seat, Harry was glad this time for Ron’s intimidating ways.  Rita Skeeter looked at each one of them. Each of them glared back, except for Draco, who was afraid if he looked at her, he may actually get up and punch her.
Draco’s brow furrowed.  “But you always wore hand me downs that were too big for you.  And you never seemed to have any nicer things.  The pocket watch you carry is dented.”
Reluctantly, they got out of bed to ready themselves for the day.  As they stood side by side at the bathroom sink, Harry grinned, trying not to let toothpaste dribble out of his mouth.  Draco leaned forward to spit as Harry bent down to rinse.
“Well, my philosophy is to toughen students like that up.  If he can’t keep up in a school environment, how is he supposed to make it in the wizarding world?”
Harry turned to see Draco standing in the doorway, a slight frown on his face. “Yeah.  Ginny and I were just . . . catching up.”
“My God, if you think they’re bad, what must you think of mine?” Harry asked, suddenly feeling self–conscious himself.
Hermione pushed his face up out of her bosom and giggled.  “Why don’t you go make sure we’ll have your room to ourselves.  I’ll be up in a minute.”
“You underestimate me,” Harry said smugly. “I may be bollocks at potions, but I excelled in charms in Auror training.  Once, I cast a glamour on myself and Ron right in front of Shacklebolt, so we could finish our lunch.”  Harry chuckled. “Kingsley thought we were hard at work behind my desk.”
“Want to try something else I bet you’ve never done before?” Anthony asked, then upended his bottle, emptying it.
In Potions, Harry was put to the real test.  Draco hadn’t been in his previous two classes that day, so he went about his observations in a very scientific way, making mental notes of his reactions to different boys, and girls.  He found that his responses to boys and girls was similar.  Some he found attractive, others, not.  However, he still didn’t know if that was normal.  If there was such a thing as normal.
“Because it was fun and exciting not knowing for certain.  Although, I hoped I was right,” she smiled shyly.
“I’m most definitely not a boy either,” she grinned.  “When was the last time you had the company of a real woman?”
“All right, all right.  The two of you don’t have to gang up on me.  I don’t care what the pervert does with other queers.”  He took a swig of lager.
Draco leaned up on his elbow.  “Don’t get me wrong, Harry, your trusting nature has surely benefitted me.”
Harry sighed.  “Fine,” he told the journal.  “I’ll write it.  But I don’t know what I’m supposed to do about it, other than wait for him to decide.”
Ron didn’t hesitate and slid into the booth across from Draco. Hermione glanced at Harry, who didn’t appear entirely happy about Draco’s invitation. But seeing as Ron made himself at home, she too sat down.
“Pansy and Blaise?  Oh, yeah.  But they’ve known all along that I’m an equal opportunity shagger.”  Draco grinned.
“I wish I could go with you.  I’ve grown quite fond of your mother. And Clara serves the best biscuits.”
As the group ate, conversation was casual among most of them.  Draco kept silent, mostly listening.  But he occasionally glanced at Harry as he spoke to Minerva.  Harry continued to avoid looking at Draco, being embarrassed by his drunkenness the night before. He wondered if he said or did something in his stupor that made Draco so quiet.
“We saw one another occasionally at family gatherings--weddings, funerals, matriarchal birthday parties,” Knox added.
Harry lifted his head in order to look at the blond head between his legs.  “It feels like something I shouldn’t like.  But I do,” Harry blushed.
“I don’t fucking know.  It’s the only answer I have for anyone these days.” Harry suddenly remembered answering Draco’s last question from the game.  “I didn’t even realize I was doing it.  It was simply a response to you calling me Potter.  He’s the only one that still consistently calls me that.”  He crossed his arms over his chest.  “I suppose now all of Slytherin is going to have a good laugh over this.”  His own laugh was hollow and cold.  “Fucking hell. You and your asinine game.”
“Nothing.  Are you finished eating yet?” Harry tried to forget about his negative thoughts.  He wanted to enjoy the day.
“My side?  There is only one side,” Lucius said. “What happened, happened.  They are facts, not my view or opinion.”
“What did you do yesterday while I was out with Blaise?” Draco finally asked a question Harry couldn’t answer with yes or no.
Harry closed his eyes and reached out magically for his love.  A smile formed on his face as he sensed him nearby.  “He’s fine,” Harry said.  “But there is something . . . not wrong, but unusual.”
“Mum, you can barely see her tiny little face peeking out,” George said.  “For all I can tell, she might be the ugliest baby I’ve ever seen.”
The pair stood silently, straining to listen.  Faint moans came from the pitchblack section of the castle. Harry turned to look at Draco but could only see his dim outline from the scant light of the window nearby.
“You can’t just decide on a whim to get married.  Besides, you have to fill out the paperwork to marry, the same as in the muggle world,” Madam Hooch told him.
Dean shook his head. “I suppose I’m lucky they accept my owl.  They won’t take any wizarding ways into the home.  I tried to give them a portkey that would take them here instantly, but they refused.”
Getting up and dressing as well, Harry tried to calm him down.  “If I know Ginny, she’s working on whatever issue they might have.  She wants to win as badly as any of us.”
“Instead of this floo call, why don’t we all meet tomorrow night?  I’ve got no plans and it’s been ages since we’ve seen each other in the flesh.”
“Unless you hold my hand again,” Harry whispered.  To his students he said, “Come on, you lot.  Finish up your drinks.  It’s time to go back.”
“I think you’ll find that it looks quite different from the last time you were here,” he assured Harry.
“Hey,” Anthony pouted.  “I’m not ready yet.  It gets bigger. And maybe if you’d stop trying to tell me what to do, I wouldn’t be so anxious.”
“Well, it looks as though Professor Knox will be joining us for an extended stay,” she said.  “That is, if you’re available.”
“Sounds like you’re trying to talk yourself out of it,” Hermione said.  “Is that really how you feel?”
It seemed forever before the healer came out to give them an update.  Molly stood, fearful of the news.
Next, she traced the line under his index finger going across his palm. “This is the head line,” she told him.  “I can see that you’re very intelligent.  Potions is your passion.”
“We had a bit of trouble deciding, but I think we’ve finally settled.”  Harry glanced at Draco, who nodded back. “Our son is Scorpius James Potter-Malfoy.”
With his hand still on Harry’s arm, Draco apparated them to the gate outside Hogwarts.  He removed the charms in order to open the gate and led Harry inside. After restoring the wards, he guided Harry to his second floor quarters, stopping several times along the way when he thought Harry might gob.  He was thankful when they reached Harry’s quarters without incident.
Draco smiled, “You don’t need to explain.  I didn’t mean to pry.”  After a few silent moments, he said, “I’m completely knackered.  I guess I’ll be off to bed.”
Nodding Draco questioned, “Can there really be only one wizarding adoption agency?  It seems the odds of finding a match anytime soon are long.  It says here the average time from petitioning to receiving a child is even longer than a year.  Could be two.”
“Or maybe,” Harry gave Draco a small kiss on the cheek.  “It means you have never forgotten me, and never will.”
“Let me have your attention again please,” Slughorn bellowed over the noise of the class.  “I will be calling you up in pairs to choose your potion.  There are only seven on the list, so some of you will have the same one.  Mr. Finnigan and Mr. Longbottom first.”
“Ah, but this time it’s binding.  You have to answer honestly and completely or pay the consequences.”
After what seemed like an extraordinarily long time, Victoire squeezed herself into the chair next to Draco, forcing him to move over.
Hermione moved to Ron’s table, while Harry sat down next to Draco.  He subtly asked Draco if he was all right.
Harry, on the other hand, had been helping Knox in some of his free time.  McGonagall decided Professor Flitwick’s  Charms curriculum was in need of some re-vamping and enlisted Harry to assist.  To his surprise, Knox had been behaving himself and the pair retained the rapport they had begun to build when Knox first turned up at Hogwarts.
“The two of you have such different career paths.  Perhaps Blaise is merely being realistic,” Draco suggested.
Hermione’s heart sank.  “Then you either have to change the wards or convince them that Harry is a Malfoy.”
He had half hoped the events from the night before were just a bizarre dream he’d had under the influence of alcohol. Gingerly, he slid off the sofa and made his way to his liquor cabinet.  Though he didn’t drink himself into oblivion often, Draco kept a hangover potion or two, just in case.  He downed the vile liquid and lay back down until it began to take effect.
Draco grabbed Harry by the shoulders and walked him backwards toward a small, fluffy mattress he had conjured.  They fell together, kissing and running their hands over smooth, taut bodies.
“Don’t thank me yet,” she chuckled. “You won’t be able to get into your room for a while.”  Hermione kicked off her pointy, uncomfortable shoes, scooped them up, grabbed the front of her skirt and dashed out of the Great Hall.
“I was, but . . . I’m not really feeling well.  If you wouldn’t mind giving my excuses to McGonagall.”
Harry got out of bed and padded out into the common room.  An amused looked crossed his face as he saw Draco sitting on the floor with the two Fourth Years, eating a rather grand breakfast spread on a blanket. The Sixth Year student, Edward, or Edwin, or something similar Harry couldn’t recall, came bounding into the room with biscuits his mother had sent him.  His parents were doing important research and couldn’t take the Christmas break, so he remained at Hogwarts.
Harry strode inside and stood with arms crossed, trying to look as intimidating as he could.  Within a minute or two, both Rita Skeeter and her new editor appeared.  She hesitated when she noticed that Harry’s wand was out.
“I like the arrangement the way it is. René has his home and I have mine.  Besides, living here with the children keeps me feeling young.”  She narrowed her eyes.  “Are you trying to get rid of me?”
“Oh, good,” Luna squealed and dragged Seamus up to the main floor of the castle and the pair snuck out of the castle.
Was it possible to fall for someone she hardly knew at all in just a couple of hours?  Was he simply a good enough actor to make her believe that he cared?  She didn’t want the morning to come.  She didn’t want to regret what she had done.
“No, you don’t.  Draco, your father is going to be in Azkaban a long time.  And I want you to live here, if you wish.”
He stopped pacing and glared at her.  “I won’t come back to you, if that’s what you think.  Even if it turned out Harry’s only with me due to the spells, I won’t come back to you,” he said angrily.
“All this talk about how much you trust me,” Draco said, defiantly crossing his arms over his chest.  “I never even questioned whether or not I should trust you.”
Clara bowed and nodded. “Clara has readied the blue guest room for them.”  She wrung her hands. “Is Master Draco finding that satisfactory?”
“Why don’t you lie down.  I’ll ride you,” Draco offered, knowing his husband was exhausted from the evening.
“Uh, no, I gave that up.  It’s being used to house confiscated artifacts for the Ministry.  I preferred to get my own flat.”
“I use it after I shower to keep my skin from drying out,” Harry laughed.  “But I don’t see why it won’t work for my arse too.”
“I know him well.  In many ways better than you,” Harry said.  “You haven’t seen him, aside from his visits.  Out there, in the real world, Draco has turned his life around.  He’s a respected professor at Hogwarts.  He makes his own way without relying on the Malfoy fortune.  You would be proud of him.”
Harry looked at his fidgeting hands in his lap.  Draco waited with bated breath for Harry to defend his actions.  Or to tell Knox to buggar off.  But he said nothing.
They ordered two portions of fish and chips, and two Cokes, then sat down at a small picnic table.  The food was greasy and overpriced, but they enjoyed it nevertheless.
“He took it surprisingly well actually.  Not that he had much choice.  I think our first meeting sort of softened the blow.  He was able to get used to the idea of you and me, especially once he realized the advantages of having the Chosen One in the family.”
Draco nodded.  “I thought if I looked more like him, he would accept me more readily.  But that doesn’t make sense, does it?  Expecting to be accepted for who you are, if you’re simply imitating someone else.”
Harry went to his chest and pulled out a few more pairs of pants to put in his suitcase. He looked over at Draco to make an innuendo about not needing any pants but held his tongue. Draco seemed lost in thought.  A common sight as of late.
“Yes.  Of course I trust you.  It’s him I don’t trust.”  Draco didn’t have to specify which him he was talking about.
Ron glanced over at Harry, who was busy talking with Hermione and Harper.  “Yeah, all right.”  He would do it for Harry.  “Excuse me.”  Ron got up and moved over to Ginny.
He slipped the ring onto Harry’s finger, and sniffed ever so softly.  Harry paused a moment to gaze at it before he began.
“The wards changed.  I had a suspicion something like that would happen.  When the Dark Lord took over, I think my father set the wards to trap anyone inside should there be an attack.  There’s probably a ‘back door’ for only my family to escape. But I don’t know the spell to activate it.” His eyes wandered to the floor next to Harry.  “Watch out!”
“No, sir,” Harry answered, taking the Healer’s hand.  “We were visiting Ginny and Dean with their new baby.”
“But Draco and I are fine.  I gave him a ring and everything.  We’re moving in together this week.  Not sure when we’ll actually get married.”
“Everything all right dear?”  Sibyll Trelawny asked, her eyes appearing to bug out behind her thick glasses.  She placed a sympathetic hand on top of Harry’s.  “Trouble with love?”
“Thanks.  I didn’t want to ask Hermione to marry me until I could give her the perfect ring.  But I was lucky, I found this right away.”
“Well, you know, these sorts of problems arise all the time.  They need proper attention or they’ll fester.”  Draco kissed Harry’s neck, nipping at it gently. “We’re newlyweds, we’re supposed to shag a lot.”
He thought it was a strange question and chuckled softly.  “It doesn’t matter where I cum, this counts.  Besides, I promised to make you feel special.”  He pulled out and concentrated on her.  “Is that good?  Tell me if you want me to do something different.”
“Don’t get me wrong, Althea’s very nice, a lot like Hermione.  Maybe too much like Hermione. I liked her, though,” Harry shrugged.
Slughorn inspected her cauldron and spooned out a bit to smell.  “Beautifully done Miss Granger.  You are my winner today.”
Harry nodded and spoke slowly. “I’d be so appreciative, if I could just pop in for a moment. I promise I won’t disturb him. Just to ease my mind.”
“You said we shouldn’t have any secrets between us. But . . . I’ve been . . . lying to you. Keeping something from you, to be more accurate.”
Hermione had walked back in and put an arm around Ron, shivering at the thought of what might have happened.
Draco nodded.  “I’ve been to a few Christmas weddings.  But don’t you think the holiday would overshadow your special day? And your anniversary ever after that?”
“And you thought Draco had changed,” Harry laughed.  “Never thought I’d see the day Ron Weasley collected flowers in a field.”
Hermione wrinkled her nose.  “That place is always full of drunks.  Can’t we go to The Three Broomsticks or someplace in muggle London?”
“This is worse than when I was young,” Harry said in Draco’s ear. “I’ve always hated getting my picture taken.”
Lucius stroked his chin.  If something happened to Potter, his son would still have been able to get out through the wards.  but if the Manor was protecting itself, Draco wouldn’t know the counterspells to the new wards.  He didn’t care if Potter perished in there with Greyback.  However, if Draco had gone in and wasn’t able to get out, something must have gone wrong.
“Oh, please.  His trousers have to come off to get to his leg.”  Draco rolled his eyes.  “I’m sure you’ve seen him in his pants before.”
Harry didn’t wait for Draco to ask to be wanked, thanks to the benefit of his experience.  He also had the benefit of a relatively clear head, that Draco had not.
“Thanks, but I’m awfully busy these days,” Harry replied politely, ignoring the jab at Draco. “Well, we must be going. It was great to see you Simon.” Harry shook Simon’s hand.
At precisely eight o’clock on Saturday night, Harry arrived at Blue Fish to meet Althea Bridgewater.  The witch was already there, in a small waiting area.  She stood when she saw Harry, recognizing him instantly.
Sighing, Harry got up from the couch.  Deciding to take a walk to pass the time while waiting for Hermione to leave their room, he glanced around the hallway to make sure the coast was clear.  The Astronomy Tower was as good place as any to go on such an occasion.  It seemed to be a clear night.
“Wait,” Harry finally said.  He took Draco’s left arm and draped it over his shoulder.  Then, he put his own left arm around Draco’s shoulder, leaving their right hands on one another’s waist.
“I’m sorry you feel that way,” Harry said.  “I’m doing this for you.  For us.  So we can get back to normal.”
“Bollocks!  Who the hell is calling on you this early on a Sunday morning?  Don’t they know we’re going for a shag record?”
“The savior of the wizarding world coming out is bound to be news.  The Prophet will be all over it.  Not everyone will be supportive.”
“Hermione!” Harry cried.  “You’re not my bloody father.  You make me sound like some virginal young girl.  And his intentions are none of your business.”
With a smile, Harry answered, “I don’t think there’s anything suspicious about two professors walking their students back from Hogsmeade together.”
Before long, Draco began to whimper into Harry’s mouth. He detached his lips from Harry’s and threw his head back, his eyes closed in ecstasy.
“I cannot stress enough that the ends do not always justify the means.” McGonagall sighed.  “However, in this case, your actions proved prudent.  Is there anything you wish to say now?”
Mel smiled and removed the colorful scarf she wore around her neck.  “Of course, I did my best to keep up the illusion, so I can’t fault the unobservant.”
Though Draco was still a little wary of his father saying something inappropriate, the gathering went well. With so many Weasleys at the table, conversation never ran dry. Topics ranged from dragons, as always, to children, potions, and the new puppy, as well as Harry and Draco’s upcoming holiday
“Yes it . . .oh.  I forgot I gave it back to you.”  Harry looked at Draco’s wand in his hand.  “Bloody hell.  Accio
“My wand!” Harry cried as he watched it tumble into the cellar with the section of flooring. “Fuck!  How am I going to get that?” He leaned over just a bit to look down into the dark cellar. “Accio wand,” Harry tried. Nothing.
“Just needed to get out of my House. I was on my way back. Goodnight, then,” he said and began walking past her.
A little shocked by his response, Draco swiftly turned and looked at Harry.  He saw his mother’s smirk out of the corner of his eye and began to get up.
“Do you think we’ll ever have enough meat on our bones for her?” Harry wanted to know.  “I wonder if she’s said anything to Draco.”
“Not yet, mate.  I’m taking Hermione to her favorite muggle restaurant tonight. Then on a carriage ride.” Ron reached into his pocket and pulled out a small box.
“Perhaps we should declare our common room a no snogging zone,” Ginny smiled, her tone softening.  Obviously, the two were hot for one another and they made an oddly cute couple.
Shaking his head, Draco answered Harry’s unasked question. “I never actually said it. I told you, I’m not even sure I really felt it.  Anyway, it doesn’t matter.  When she said she would never consent to marrying someone who may keep male lovers on the side, it hurt.  She all but squashed any feelings I may have had for her.”
Harry leaned forward more.  “Oh.”  He looked into Draco’s face.  “I can barely see them.  Is this what you’re so upset about?” he snickered a bit.
So, Draco didn’t have nothing to say after all, he merely fell asleep. Relieved, Harry smirked and raised an eyebrow. “A moment?” His smiled dropped as he reached out to wipe the smallest of tears from the corner of Draco’s eye. “What’s this? Are you all right? Did I hurt you?”
“Mione?”  Harry cautiously entered the area of the library in which Hermione was studying.  She glanced up at him.
“The point is,” Harry said, taking Draco’s hands in his own. “Neither of us is ready now anyway.  And we’ve got plenty of time to decide together, whether or not we want to raise a family.”
“So am I.” Draco sighed. “I don’t know exactly where this will end up. Nobody ever does. Do they? But I’ve never felt this way before. No one else has ever made me literally feel weak in the knees.” He paled a shade.
“Mr. Corner, Miss Patil.  The dance is over.  To your rooms,” McGonagall said.  It was a sentiment she repeated several times to several couples who didn’t want the evening to end.
“I’ll answer almost anything you want to know,” Harry said.  “Provided I get the questions in advance, and you ask only those questions.  My intimate relationship with Draco is off limits, except what I choose to say about it.”
Harry’s expression mimicked Draco’s.  “Draco, you don’t have to spend all of your time with me, you know. You don’t turn down other things for me, do you?”
“I’d just like to put it in writing,” Harry said.  “I’ve found a renter for Sirius’s house and if our flat falls through, I’ll be homeless,” Harry laughed.
reappeared on the page.  He smiled again at the book.  It really didn’t matter who the mother of those children turned out to be.  He and Draco would raise them together.  Harry knew that in his heart.  He just needed to be reminded to trust in their love.
“No, of course I don’t regret it.  I’m merely saying that we should have gone into it, having discussed our future expectations more thoroughly.”
“Leo.  Actually Leonard, but we’ll call him Leo for short. Leonard Arthur Thomas.  We used my father’s middle name and of course, yours sir,” Dean said as he shook Arthur’s hand.  “My parents aren’t here yet?  I owled them hours ago.”
Harry sighed heavily. “All right then.  I can go out to the common room.”  He picked up his book and parchment and walked out of the room.  He passed Hermione on her way to the boys’ room.  She blushed as Harry told her to have fun.
Dreamily thinking about Harry’s vision, Hermione wasn’t really paying attention to him as he told her about another dream, in which Draco had a wand pointed at Ron, shouting “Avada Kedavra.”
“Walking around,” Harry shrugged, trying to appear casual.  He couldn’t keep the smile off his face, though.
No, working together would not be the problem, Harry decided.  Keeping from ogling the junior Malfoy would be.  Harry found himself turning away several times from Malfoy’s gaze. His grey eyes seemed clear enough for Harry to see right into the man’s soul.  Or perhaps he was afraid that Malfoy would be able to see into his.  The Slytherin always had a certain degree of intensity in his stare, but it was a different sort now.  It wasn’t cold any more.
Harry didn’t like the idea of yet again using someone else’s wand, but he would have to wait for a trip to Diagon Alley to buy one of his own.  Reluctantly, he pulled the wand out of his trouser pocket and handed it to Draco.  Clearly, Draco was glad to have it returned. He closed his eyes and Harry could practically see the wand re-bond with him.  The look on Draco’s face was almost erotic.
Turning his head, Harry’s lips brushed Draco’s cheek.  “I don’t think that’s the sort of action they’re looking for.”
Harry threw the covers off, revealing Draco, who was trying so hard not to laugh that he was practically convulsing.  Under the blanket the movement looked much more unsettling to Ron.  Finally releasing his laughter, Draco fell backwards on the bed.
Dressed nicely, yet not in their Sunday best, Harry and Draco arrived at the Burrow twenty minutes late. Draco was more than a little surprised to see his parents there. He was certain they would make their excuses, seeing at it was a holiday.
Pansy smirked.  “But this time you are the Chooser.  You can have him do whatever you want.  Or don’t want.”
He sat down on one end of the couch in front of the fireplace.  Harry swiftly followed to avoid the nauseous feeling Ernie and Anthony experienced earlier.  After all the butter beer and firewhiskey shots, Harry’s stomach was already churning a bit.  He took a seat at the other end of the couch, perhaps three feet away.
“It’s not sudden.  I’ve been in love with you since we were seventeen.”  Draco gathered up the courage to look at Harry directly.  “But I never dared to hope that you would ever feel the same for me.  Until you saved me from the Room of Requirement, I didn’t think we‘d be anything but enemies.”
“You shouldn’t be.  You’re not bad lookin’.  Straighten your teeth out and get a decent haircut and you’d be all right.  Plus, you killed that huge bloody snake!  You’re a regular hero.”
Harry couldn’t help himself.  “I defended him at his trial, if you recall.”  He knew full well that she did.  The photograph on the day’s issue came directly from the trial.
“It would be ideal, though, wouldn’t it?” Harry said. “We could both be home with Scorpius and Lily.  But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.  We’ll stick to the plan we have for now.  After all, I did write the first book while teaching.”
“Briefly. But it was never serious. Draco, you can’t get jealous of everyone I talk to. I know a lot of people. A lot of people think they know me. I still get stopped by strangers occasionally. And many of them are . . . overly friendly. I just talk to them and go on my way. It doesn’t mean anything. It’s you I want to be with.”
Draco collapsed in a heap on top of Harry, barely able to catch his breath.  Having a bit of trouble himself, the brunet waited a moment before speaking.
“Or we could quickly apparate to London for a bite,” Harry offered.  “If you prefer we not bother the house elves.”
“Oh, there are worse things as punishments,” Harry chuckled.  “But, why don’t you simply have them write essays? It’ll be easier on you.  You can even take them to your office and get some work done.”
“I’ve won an internship with a Potions Master in Diagon Alley.  In three years, I’ll become a Master as well.  And after working on a Master level two more years, I can apply for my certifications and open up my own shop if I choose.” He turned to Harry.  “And then you’ll purchase your healing potions from me.”
Harry had forgotten about the cloak he left by the door in Malfoy Manor. “Great, thanks. How’s the clean up going there?” He had gone to the mansion the day after the mission as Shacklebolt had requested. When he saw how many members of the Ministry were already involved, Harry told the Minister that he would be available if necessary. However, he was just getting in the way. No one had owled or floo called, so Harry assumed things were progressing smoothly.
“I assume I’ll need to find work in the Ministry when I leave Hogwarts.  I figured I’d better read up on my options.”
“Oh, nothing.  Just that Montague is about to make a fool of himself in front of the prettiest girl in Ravenclaw.”
Pansy shrugged.  “I don’t know.  Maybe we’ll find out that we have nothing to talk about.  But maybe we’ll find out that we do.  Maybe I’ll find out what it’s like to have a normal relationship, instead of bed-hopping.”
“Draco and I are planning to go somewhere new every summer,” Harry said.  “It won’t be difficult for me because I haven’t traveled much at all.  But Draco’s been all sorts of places.”
Wishing he hadn’t suggested the evening end, Draco bent down to retrieve his own shirt, but didn’t put it back on.  “You could stay,” he blurted out.
“You know, Potter, the faster we get finished here, the faster we’ll have free time.”  The smile on Draco’s face grew.  “And I’m just about done.  I guess I’ll have to start without you.”
Draco led Harry through his bedroom, into his bath. It was completely tiled in black and white with gold hardware. The shower was all glass and large enough for the two of them, plus at least one more.
“For starters, a good partner.  I’ll not get stuck with Mandy Brocklehurst again.  She’s total rubbish at Potions. And not Pansy either.  Love her to death, but she treats Potions class like social hour.  How about Granger?”
Harry refused to engage in conversation with the woman.  At least not until she had signed a contract with clear guidelines.
Harry sighed as Draco quickly disappeared.  He’d been lonely ever since Draco left the school to tend to his mother.  And with the weekend fast approaching, he was feeling particularly solitary.
Ron got up and walked to Harry’s bad and sat down. “Thanks, mate.  That probably wasn’t easy for you to tell me.  I’ll be on my guard.”
to defeat him.  I was made to, inadvertently by him. It was luck, most of it.  And a lot of help from a lot of good people--”
After listening to Harry’s tale, Draco looked at the pins in his hand, as if they would tell him the right words to say. He smirked a bit, thinking that they told him exactly what to say.  They’d already spoken for him, apparently.  And Harry took the first leap.  Draco need only meet him halfway.
Draco went to the couch and lay down with his head on the high arm rest.  He held his arms open wide inviting Harry to join him.  Harry nestled himself between Draco’s legs and lay back on his chest.  It was a ritual to which they both looked forward all week.
“We have our problems, same as anyone.  But I do love her.  Being with Lav was strange and awkward.  She doesn’t know me like Hermione. No one does.  I didn’t realize how good I had it.  Now I hope it’s not too late.”
“Nothing.  We’re going to Diagon Alley.  I’m just going to introduce him around.  Show him the best places for supplies and such.”
Harry shoved his shoulder.  “You know what I mean.  First, you had to come to my rescue at Ron and Hermione’s, then you practically had to jump through hoops to get me to cum.”
“Yeah,” Harry answered.  “So maybe it’s just a phase I’m going through.  After breaking up with Ginny.”
Harper passed out sparkling wine that he brought from his family’s winery.  Draco couldn’t help shaking his head and smiling at the boy’s ensemble.  A sleeveless black t-shirt with a sequined Union Jack on it, red leather trousers that fit him quite well, and a royal blue boa around his neck.  In his curly, golden brown hair sat a small crystal tiara.  He also sported a hefty amount of guyliner and pink lipgloss.
“Are you serious Potter?” The Slytherin sighed.  “I’m a marked man.”  He held out his left arm and pushed the sleeve up.  “Or have you forgotten?  Nobody else has.”
Hermione giggled and covered her mouth. “I’ll try to get books on Quidditch,” she said. “But I might try the poetry, too.” She nudged Harry.
“No, you’re not mad.  I’m really standing here. It must be a shock.  Father told me you were certain I was dead.” He chuckled a bit. “He wanted to keep it that way.”
“But there aren’t any blibbering humdingers inside the castle.  We have to look in the forest for them.”
She placed her hands on the table and leaned forward.  “We’re having a little get together in Slytherin Friday night.”
Harry grinned.  “She said very little.  She hugged me, then cried.  Or maybe it was the other way around.  She said she noticed that you have been much happier since we got together.”
Draco peered up at him as he walked out of the bedroom and giggled.  One side of Harry’s hair was plastered to his head, most likely with dried cum.
“Harry tells me you’re not interested in having children.  But you’re wonderful with them.  Mary Poppins herself wouldn’t make a better babysitter.”
Draco reached down and gave them a squeeze.  “They look just fine to me.  But if you must cum . . .”
Draco stood and extended his hand across the table toward Ron.  “Are we all right?” he asked tentatively.
Justin pulled the mask off and stood awkwardly, questioning the sanity of going to Slytherin that afternoon.
Harry squinted a little, examining Mel more closely.  He noticed her distinct Adam’s apple and the firm jawline.  There were other, subtle sings as well.  “I can see it now.  Now that I’m really looking.”
Harry bent down to retrieve his trousers, unceremoniously shoved his now deflating cock inside and zipped up.
“Oh, those are lovely names,” Hermione said.  “May I please hold one of them?  It’s been so long since Rose was this little.”
On the other hand, Parvati seemed rather pleased to have another chance with Michael.  After a few butter beers at the last party, he was most charming, not the shy boy he normally was.  And this time, she was in charge.
Harry smiled, then realized that Draco wouldn’t be able to see it.  He offered him the rose instead.
Of course, there was the matter of the debt Malfoy felt he needed to repay.  Harry thought it was best not to bring it up yet.  They had been behaving civilly towards each other and he didn’t want to rock the boat.
Sunday morning, bright and early, students were gathered together in groups to make the trip to Hogsmeade.  Older students were allowed to go occasionally on their own, but first and second years went together.
“Mr. Malfoy, are you finished?” the professor asked when he noticed Draco sitting and staring into his cauldron.
Harry sighed heavily. “I’ve asked myself that very question.  I really don’t know.  Mione, I don’t want to live alone when we leave here.  But you’re right, I don’t see how I can be comfortable living in the Manor where you . . .”  Harry began to choke up.
“A werewolf, of course,” he frowned.  He knew his costume was poorly put together, but he thought it was at least recognizable.
“As a matter of fact, he was trying to help me, I think. Well, at first he insulted me.  But now I know where to go to get Mione’s Christmas present.”
Harry wriggled beneath Draco and scooted out from under him.  He was somewhat speechless.  Though he was developing strong feelings for the Potions professor, he wouldn’t say he was in love.  Definitely in lust, but not love.  It was too soon.
“It’s how you usually dress,” Harry shrugged.  “Of course these clothes didn’t come from Twilfitt and Tattings,” he chortled.
“I was.  Your, um . . .”  he half gestured to Draco’s shirt, about to explain his distraction.  “Never mind.  Sorry.  Drink? I’ve brought pumpkin juice.”
say it was all in my head.  But he meant it in a good way.  And besides, all the couples that broke up, did it right away, as soon as the game ended.”
Harry and Draco used the hospital’s floo network to get back to Hogwarts.  They had but two days remaining to pack up for their last trip ever on the Express.
“It will be all right,” Harry reassured him.  “Remember, we’re here to help him.  And your mother.  If anything, that should keep him somewhat hospitable.”
The pub quieted slightly, not to the extent it did before.  Harry thought perhaps the crowd was already getting used to the idea of their saviour shagging another man.
Relieved that she offered, Harry answered, “We’re not sure where to start. Obviously we can’t just shag and-–” he blushed.
“Not at all,” Harry told him.  “She was really very supportive.  Of all of it.  Ron’s going to be a different story,” Harry laughed, but he wasn’t at all looking forward to that conversation.
“No. Sort of.  Actually, I’ve been keeping something from you.  About the wand game we played earlier in the year.”
“Oh, Harry my boy.  What are you doing down here on a Saturday morning?”  Slughorn smiled.  It was nearly impossible not to return the gesture. “Did you come down to sneak a bit of potions practice as well?  I’m sorry I don’t have time to supervise you right now.”
“Intelligent. I mean, not necessarily a genius or anything.  It’s not as if I’m very smart,” Harry laughed sheepishly.  “I’d like someone who has a mind of their own, but is willing to compromise.  Definitely someone that doesn’t see me as a hero, but rather as . . . me.”
Harry wondered if they were in a dark enough corner to hide them as well.  He swiftly forgot that thought when she guided one of his hands to her breast. It was not like a grapefruit at all, he thought.  More like a balloon filled with jelly.  She moaned when he kneaded it, encouraging him to carry on. Her hands slid down in the tight space between the wall and his arse, squeezing his firm cheeks.
“I believe Mrs. Weasley made these,” he replied.  “If you’ll excuse me, I should circulate the room.”
Ginny, Dean, Harry and Ron sat in chairs waiting for the Welcome Witch to call them back to a room.  Each was tapping a foot or drumming fingers or biting fingernails.  Harry would have preferred to bring Draco, but since he got himself suspended from any outside activities, he brought Ron.
“And meet me in the Entrance Hall,” she suggested.  She wasn’t quite ready for her Housemates to start in on her before there was anything to tease her about.
“You don’t have to prove anything to her,” Harry interrupted.  “You’ve already proven yourself to me.”
“I know. I thought about you all night,” Draco told him.  “I wanted to wank but I held off.  It won’t take long.”
“Draco, you’re scaring me.”  Harry could see the worry in his husband’s eyes. “Come, sit with me on the sofa.”  He sat down and patted the velvety cushion.
The couple heard a new noise and decided to investigate. Parvati and Michael got up and walked toward the boy’s stairs. A squeaking sound became louder.
“There’s a private bath through that door,” Draco pointed.  “And a small balcony past the sitting area.”
“Thank you,” Narcissa replied, standing up out of her chair.  She startled Harry, who hadn’t notice her.
“Mr. Malfoy put in his request at the beginning of the summer, as soon as Professor Slughorn announced his retirement.  I have his letter if you’d like to read it.”  She held it out to Harry, who at first dismissed it.
Harry tried to remember what happened the night before.  He did remember some of it.  But not getting to the couch, and certainly not crawling on top of Malfoy.  He wondered if Malfoy remembered, but it didn’t seem like the opportune time to ask.  Draco appeared a bit put out.
Draco waved his hand and the gate shimmered into a state of vapor, through which the pair were able to walk.  Behind them, it solidified once again.  Harry glanced back, suddenly feeling trapped.
By the time he arrived for breakfast, Draco was already midway through his meal, deep in conversation with Minerva.  As Harry walked down one of the aisles, he kept his eyes on the blond.  His hair was pulled back into a loose ponytail, as usual.  However, he wore, not his customary black, but a pale blue silk three button polo shirt and light tan pleated trousers.  Sunday morning breakfasts had been becoming more casual over the years, and some of the professors followed suit.
“Special, what? I don’t . . . what do you mean by services?” Harry stammered. “Is it that obvious?” His shoulders slumped.
Putting a finger to her mouth, he noticed an almost desperate attempt on her part to get it.  He immediately sought out Hermione, who was sitting at the kitchen table peeling potatoes with Ginny.
“Oh, I didn’t mean any offense.  It’s just that there are several books in Flourish and Blott’s about your life.  I’ve read two of them.  Fascinating. You were so brave through the war.”
Not realizing just how much work there was to do, Harry felt it was more of a token gesture, just to be friendly. Little did he know, he would end up spending the better part of the following few days in the blond’s company.
Taking it as a sign that his friend was less than comfortable, Harry took the food container and put a dumpling on Draco’s plate.  He then continued to put samples of everything for him to try.
“I, um . . . nothing in particular,” he told her.  “Thank you for being honest with me.  It must have been very difficult to talk about.”
Harry pointed to the oval patch above his heart.  “I got that from one of the horcruxes.  Hermione tried her best to get it off without damaging the skin but . . .”  He shrugged.  “And Nagini bit me here. Although it’s really faint.”  The Gryffindor held out his hand.  “I got this from Umbridge’s
“I hope the same goes for Draco,” Harry said mindlessly.  Then realizing he’d said it out loud, blushed.
Harry groaned as Draco’s cock pushed its way in.  Feeling Draco inside him again had been occupying most of Harry’s thoughts for the past several days.  True, he had been worried about hurting Draco physically.  But he was also afraid of what would happen to their relationship if Ginny was indeed carrying his child.  And he had been subconsciously holding back.
Feeling tired, Draco closed his eyes again. Harry was relieved, as he didn’t want him to notice the blush at Draco’s innuendo. But perhaps that wasn’t how Draco meant it.
sister, you know.  Anyway, you’re free to play the field.  Maybe next party you’ll get Greengrass.  Not that you really need to wait for an excuse”
“Absolutely not,” Harry said emphatically.  “Maybe, if we decide to have another, we can contract Belinda again, and I’ll be the donor.  That way they’ll at least be half siblings.”
He heard that the tub water had stopped flowing, and their bath was ready.  He got up and walked to the bath to find Harry already in the water, surrounded by dim candlelight.  It was the most beautiful sight he had ever seen.
“Careful there, she’s teething,” warned Ron.  He went into the kitchen to retrieve the butter beers.
“Now don’t start crying again,” Draco said. “I know you don’t want to hear this, but you will get over it.  And in the meantime, you have to keep up your studies.  Especially in my class.  I can’t show you any more favoritism.”
In his notes, the question didn’t include a quote.  Harry couldn’t be expected to remember every interview he gave.  He didn’t particularly recall those exact words, putting him to a disadvantage.  He directed his attention to Bert Wyndam.
Draco scratched his head.  “I don’t know.  You and Blaise might get on all right.  But Pansy’s a pill.”
As she stroked him, Daphne kissed him sensuously, slipping her tongue into his gaping mouth. He kissed back, wrestling his tongue with hers.
For the rest of the day, Draco and Harry enjoyed a rare interrupted Saturday.  Though there were some papers to grade, Draco had time to relax.  Several of his classes were in the middle of a large research project.  So, he spent much of class time babysitting and catching up on much needed ingredient inventory taking.
“No, professor, I didn’t.”  She looked up at Draco with a sort of sadness.  Tucking a strand of her golden locks behind her ear, she regarded him with deep, forest green eyes that rivaled Harry’s for beauty. And yet, they were still not her most striking feature.  Her perfect peaches and cream complexion competed with the soft, pink pouty lips beneath her delicately upturned nose.  She was one of the most beautiful girls Draco had seen.  At fifteen, she hadn’t even come close to reaching her full potential.
Draco mumbled a spell and the tight leather cuff surrounding Harry’s cock and bollocks dropped off.  Blaise certainly did know a number of handy spells.
“I should be going.  I can probably get back into my room by now.”  He crossed the room to get to the stairs.
Blaise remained silent as he finished putting on his Quidditch ensemble. Draco also began putting on protective gear, intending to fly with his teammate.
Harry let out a long sigh and finished off his glass of wine.  He immediately poured another and drank half.
Once in Charms class, Harry opened the note and read it.  He liked the idea of working on the project with Draco. Not that Ron wasn’t a perfectly fine partner, but the thought of spending long hours with Draco under the guise of schoolwork was brilliant.  Harry frowned when he read the part about Hermione exchanging Ginny for Blaise.  That would take some convincing on his part.  Not to mention, he’d most likely have to tell Ginny why.  He’d been avoiding that.
“And I suppose you think you have,” Knox laughed.  “You’re the same cowardly brat you always were.  You let Harry talk to your daddy for you.  You didn’t have the bollocks to stand up to him on your own.  You’re still afraid of your own father.”
“We’re all set,” Draco said.  “Mother approved the date, though she wasn’t exactly pleased with the short notice.”
“Moved on already, now, have you?” Blaise asked Harper accusingly.  “I knew you didn’t mean it.  And you,” he directed his gaze toward Draco.  “Potter doesn’t keep you busy enough?  You have to come sniffing around my leftovers?”
As he passed Hermione, he kissed her cheek and wished her a happy Valentine’s Day.  Before he stepped through the door, he turned to her.
“Well, I won’t have you thinking about yourself either.  Not when you should be giving me your undivided attention,” joked Draco. He dropped his towel.
Of course, the last time he had disturbingly vivid dreams, his mind was connected to Voldemort’s.  And they hadn’t been dreams so much as actual events.  This time, though, he was relatively certain no one was inside his mind with him.  Snape had made sure Harry learned the basics of Occlumency.  He wasn’t proficient by any stretch of the imagination, but he was certainly good enough to be able to detect another student’s attempts at Legilimency.
“Ron, it’s not like that.  I wasn’t planning to tell her.  You know Hermione, she just figured it out,” Harry explained.
“I don’t like getting locked out of my own room.  I give you every Friday night to yourselves. And plenty of other times.”
“Nothing that bad. He just said you must have gotten overly excited about the win.  I wonder what he’ll say when he hears about us.”
“Fear not, class. There will be many more challenges throughout the year.” Slughorn winked at Hermione.  “Clean up, now, class is almost over.”
Harry winced.  He was hoping Ron wasn’t going to undo all of the good he just did by going on about another girl.  That, and he didn’t want Hermione to know what he did.
“I’m more than happy to help.  Let me know if there’s anything else I can do. I should be going now.  Molly is at our place watching Rose, and I said I would bring lunch back with me.”
The following morning, Harry was a little later to breakfast than usual.  As he was walking in, Draco was walking out.  The smile on Harry’s face faded when he saw the scowl Draco wore.
Pansy and Blaise looked at each other, as if reading one another’s minds.  He nodded almost imperceptibly.  “All right.  You may bring her.  But make sure she understands the rules. I won’t be responsible if she gets in over her head.”
He’d had the dream one other time.  But as he recalled, Draco shouted ‘Stupify’ not the killing curse.  It was the only dream in which the circumstances grew more grim.  The others began seemingly disturbing, then became more and more benign as they progressed.  And it was such a small fragment of a dream, Harry was barely able to remember much about it.  The setting was familiar, but he couldn’t exactly place it.
