“Shut up!” Harry laughed. He wasn’t sure when he’d started laughing but it had definitely grown in intensity over the moments he’d spent typing in her contact information. “I have to call her,” he laughed out. “Fuck, fuck, we have to call her. Shut up, stop laughing, stop—“
“Very funny,” Harry deadpanned.
“How did you even know I took a week off?” Draco questioned his mother.
“Rightfully so,” Draco nodded. “I’ve had my fair share of shit relationships and I know how they end up after someone breaks the trust. Then it’s just question after question about everything that happens.”
He huffed and put his camera down on the side of the bed. “I didn’t even think about it,” Draco muttered.
“Like Ben took the twink to bed? Or are you Ben in this situation?” Pansy asked, head pleasantly swimming in a sea of ethanol.
“No!”
“Do you at least have a date in mind?”
“Someone cut him up?” She made a ‘tsk tsk’ noise with her tongue and teeth.
“I love it so much I’ve got vacation days stocked up for weeks. I’m taking as many as I need indefinitely to train you. If you still want it in the morning tomorrow then we’ll begin. As far as training goes you need a schooling like you’ve never had before, and I can give it to you if you really want to be my submissive.”
This chapter is for Sally. Yes, you, Sally. Are you really still reading this? Bless you.
Maggie smirked, her freckles moving with her expression across her pale cheeks. “I’m glad I’ve got consent, then.”
The plate landed on the parlor table with a distinct thud. Grace sat down, about ninety percent sure that Narcissa had poisoned the wheat-y treats. They looked like Narcissa had baked them herself, misshapen and malformed and definitely on the burnt side.
“He does, he does!” she laughed, the kids around her laughing and pointing to the boy.
The man himself had agreed to talking to his father and had gone so far as to hush his boyfriend when Colin started talking about how he would be there for support. Theo was being eerily calm.
He squinted to see the blackout curtains letting in a sliver of light. So it was morning, then? Or afternoon. Harry usually didn’t want to know the time, hence the curtains, but for the first time in a long while he was paying attention to the clock again. The magazine had gone out into circulation—Harry checked his muggle phone—about fifty hours ago. He told himself he had to wait forty-eight so as to not rush things when he was still reeling from submitting the ad in the first place.
, he thought in disbelief as they entered the room in a tense silence.
“I ‘ave a Riesling that is to die for,” Fleur informed Draco, waving her wand so the half-empty bottle on the table poured itself into a glass that floated Draco’s way. “Try, try it.”
“Wait, so he wasn’t disappointed twenty-four seven?” Harry asked with a mock astonishment.
, Harry thought.
“Yes. We’ll take her to London Pride every year, too. We’ll be those obnoxious gay dads who lift their kids on their shoulders and walk the streets laughing in the faces of the people who tried to legally stop us from adopting.”
It wasn’t that the restaurant was terribly expensive; it was just that Harry had never had someone to go into a joint with (admittedly fake) red-candle chandeliers above the tables.
“Don’t you think everyone has a right to be young and stupid? So long as she does it in Hogwarts or at home, we can at least make sure she’s safe,” Sirius went on. “You can’t make her mistakes for her.”
Instead of his usual gamer’s feast, Harry decided on a bowl of cereal before bed. The gamer’s feast consisted of soda pop, cheese doodles, chips, and cookies that all combined to give him some pretty weird dreams after eating.
Strangely enough, having the lover of a hero and a world-class Healer confirming that she wasn’t an idiot made Rachel feel a bit more settled. “Then you really must be as kind as they say.”
Draco nodded as if that were actually the truth, playing along. “Yes, yes. It’s incredibly hard but someone has to do it. I do it for the children.”
Just to be sure it was the most enjoyable sensation Harry had every encountered, he was sure to keep Draco there with ragged breaths and sloppy kisses until he reached a conclusion.
“What?” Draco asked, seeing the gears turn in her little head.
“As a matter of fact I do,” Draco replied and produced a deep blue suit with a black turtleneck to go underneath. “One can never be sloppy when arriving for tea with the Malfoys.”
Harry felt his heart beat in his chest. He’d seen this moment in movies, too. It was during prom, Draco had a hotel room, he was surprising him… Harry didn’t know if he was ready for this. Sure, they’d had some more-than innocent talks over the past week, but this was so soon.
“Can’t get out, can we?” Draco teased because of course he couldn’t, these knots only wound tighter when they were pulled on. “Then it’s time to begin.”
Draco closed the door behind him, letting out a shuddery breath. Madness, complete madness—and now Pye was after his job? And had been all along? Draco’s frown deepened, his anger still roiling in his gut. He wanted to hex that stupid look right off Pye’s face, but that would surely result in his firing.
Harry shushed him. “Quit ruining the moment.”
Alex smiled. Even though he was a Gryffindor, he didn’t want to be too bold in asking how she was getting along with Sirius and Remus. “Yeah, Professor Lupin has got a pretty cool husband. I can’t wait until I can turn into an animal. I hope my animagus form is something awesome like a horse. So, um, you’re doing well?”
“I can do your homework, but I think speaking for you in class would draw attention,” Draco replied coolly and rubbed his arm where Harry had elbowed it, as if it actually hurt. “And the crack means that an admirer is currently thinking of me.”
“Harry?” Ron called into the flat, closing the door behind his love and him.
“Wonderful,” Draco said. If this woman worked out, then everybody would win. She fit the original genetic profile for Lucius’ taste, and as for Harry’s, what reason had she given them not to like her? “We’d just like to go over some preliminary details of the adoption forms to make sure you’re looking for the same thing that we are.”
“Of course I’m right, I’m always right,” Draco snapped at him. The taxi ride had jarred his emotional state and he would take it out on this bastard all he wanted.
Draco’s hand was on his shoulder in an instant. His long fingers carefully draped themselves on his skin like a test to see if Harry would shake them off. Harry didn’t shake them off.
Harry stepped closer to Draco to fill the gap between them. “Could you tell I was showing off?” Harry whispered in his ear. “All day, showing off to make you look,”
Grace shook her head. “Fuck you, I’m not finished talking.”
“No, I just… I wanted you to know that even outside of these… things we like, I like you. I think the world is so much better with Draco Malfoy in it and I’ve always thought that.”
“Unfortunately, I have seen straight sex.” He shuddered at the thought. “It was terrifying and I will never forgive Pansy for it.”
"You're disgusting for thinking like that.
Things certainly weren’t like the old days, when Dobby and several other elves from the Crabbe, Goyle, Parkinson, and Nott households were all pooled together in one mansion’s kitchen while their owners dined in serenity.
“I know what my parents did was wrong,” Dudley said quietly. “And I really didn’t want this to be the way we met. I don’t know much about magic, and I kind of need Harry’s help with this one. I was hoping we could get along.”
Harry pressed the power button to reveal his custom wallpaper, just like the old one had. He swiped the screen in confusion and proceeded to check his photos, his contacts, and apps. Not only were there new apps and the upgraded version of the World of Warcraft Authenticator (downloading that app gave you a free vanity pet in the game!) but the phone had one more contact in it than Harry remembered.
Twelve owls fought to get in at once, some succeeding and some less so, bursting in as one feathered flock.
Harry bolted up, wand at the ready just in time to hear a voice break through the walls via magical loudspeaker.
Narcissa giggled and hid her face in her hand. “Maybe we should have built them a lean-to, or some sort of shelter…”
Draco shook his head. How could he ever explain this to his father? “It’s nothing. I’ll get over it. Please, don’t be worried.”
Draco glared once more at Harry for good measure. “Everything’s fine, Aubrey. We just, ah, have a question to ask about the case we’re currently on.”
Okay, he hadn’t exactly been expecting a full-on dungeon or anything, but the unsuspecting third floor of a business building in the far south of Diagon Alley seemed far too… normal.
“We have the Facebook profile, calm down. We might hear back from some of her Facebook friends since we sent them questions,” Draco hissed.
Grace was almost offended by the questioning before remembering she was in no position to be offended by someone who had taken her into his home and life for the next few months. “I’m sure,” she answered in a solemn, serious tone.
“Ever wonder how it was for me?” Harry laughed. “No, of course not, I don’t know why I even asked that.”
“And you think that just because you’ve read a couple glamorous stories about the Boy Who Lived and his Death Eater lover that they’re suitable parents?” Tiff questioned.
Ginny lay on her side so they could be face-to-face. “You’re very superficial,” she said fondly. “I guess it’s easy for you to be because you’re so pretty.”
The first thing Draco did when approaching from behind was grab Harry’s arse, one hand to each globe so he could lift them, squeeze them, play with them. “You’re going to be pinker than your dress by the time I’m done with you,” Draco purred into his ear, pressing his chest to his back. “Say ‘mercy’ when you want it but I can’t guarantee I’ll give it.”
in exchange for sweet release. “Maybe you’ve been good enough.”
Harry’s frown turned up into a smile. “Okay,” he said, and found Draco’s hand under the tablecloth.
Freeing Harry’s cock had set loose the hard length that Draco had been expecting. “Daddy…” Harry whispered. “Look how hard I am for you.” The master of his orgasms loomed behind him and he was always going to have to earn one.
“I know you want to speed up the arrival of your heirs, but this is just ridiculous. They’ll adopt whenever they’re ready and they don’t need your help with it. You managed to raise a kid without your parents sticking their nose in everything.”
“I’m sorry, Lorraine. I’m really sorry.”
too much to be mad atme for long,” Harry reminded him.
Lucius and his cane made their way from where he had rested against the wall. When he found the strange muggle switch Harry was talking about, he flipped it down.
“I love you, too,” Draco said, biting back tears.
Draco kicked off his shoes and collapsed onto the couch next to Harry. “Apparently he does. I’m not finding a ‘nice, rich, pureblood man to settle down with’ quickly enough for his taste, so he’s started to take up the hunt for me.” Draco tipped his head back and let out a forlorn groan.
“I do,” she cut him off. “I really do, Professor. Or Remus. Or whatever I’m supposed to call you.”
With a courteous smile the attendant began to lead Harry deeper into the store. “Right this way. We have a dressing room in the back where you can try on anything you like.” They had an undercut and a gauge earring, and Harry immediately felt safe knowing they were a muggle who had no clue of his past and wasn’t judging him on his present.
“Throw practical out the window! Have you seen your man’s Gringotts statements?!”
Now there was one of her kind right in front of Gerda’s large, misty eyes.
Harry wouldn’t make Draco apologize when he was sick, though. If he did then that opened up the door to Draco shrugging off the apology as something said in an ill stupor.
Everything.
Hermione’s voice through the floo sounds surprised, a tad concerned.
Warily, Harry steps inside.
“Thank you,” Draco said, dryly. “Truly flattered.” He narrowed his eyes. “Who gave you my information?”
“I buy my potion-making equipment here,” Malfoy said, gesturing to a shop as they passed. A display of small cauldrons had been set up outside; the words SALE spelled themselves out in yellow light above. Behind them, a Medieval-looking contraption loomed in the front window: a structure like a table surrounded by metal arms with hooks and graspers. Seeing Harry’s expression, Malfoy said, “It bottles potions for you. And I get my ingredients there,” he added as they passed the next shop. Pungent smells wafted out. “These two are owned by siblings.”
Harry clicked his glass down a little harder than intended because of the alcohol already in his system. “Wheat beer with strawberry puree. Dry-hopped.”
“I’ve been busy!”
Malfoy waves his hand in a gesture that says,
“Come on, then. I hardly want to play on the table.” Malfoy settles on the rug next to the hearth, looks up with a smirk and murmurs, “Or are you scared?”
“Wow.”
Hermione senses his attention. That, or she has a spell in place. After a few seconds, she closes her book and leans forward.
He sat and half-dozed—though he was mostly only pretending to doze—as he watched Luna and Ginny move around the kitchen, making lunch. The way Ginny looked at Luna, expression softening and lighting up.
“Oh, shut it, Ronald,” Hermione said, cheeks reddening. There was another scuffle, though this time there was a small, fond smile on her face. “
“So, what? You plan to roam the countryside while I work on your potion? And what if I need to speak with you?”
“Glamours leave a trace, and polyjuice—you know. They’d have known immediately. Anyway, there’s no better camouflage than my own tarnished reputation.”
. Keep going,” Harry whispered.
Draco felt panic welling. “Oh, no. That’s not necessary.”
Robards disappeared directly after delivering this news.
Tea and toast. Tea and toast first, before arguments with Potter. Before any conscious thought is needed.
I’m blushing. They’re doing—that. They’re doing that in your bedroom where you sleep.”
“Uh.”
“Mm. Nerve endings?”
Malfoy runs a hand over the nape of his neck. “I have absolutely no idea.” Before Harry can speak, he continues: “They restored my memories. Most of them. Granger saw to that, apparently. I have no idea— No idea why she’d do that. That’s just the thing. I can’t remember much of the last three weeks. You, arriving on my doorstep. It’s mostly a blank after that.”
Dinner arrives, and she departs. Harry tucks into this evening’s mush. The image of Malfoy is still there in his mind, blinking and squinting in the courtroom with that little frown on his face.
have a pensieve?”
Malfoy was unfailingly polite to the waiter who arrived, and seemed well familiar with the ritual of ordering drinks and asking about the daily specials.
Malfoy ignored him. “The next steps are likely similar to what you learned. But I doubt you’ve ever used the charms that I do. Because I developed them. They simulate hand-mixing. Otherwise, using charms to mix would be no better than using a non-magical appliance.”
A movement caught Draco’s eye. He glanced upwards, but immediately switched his attention back to Edward as the old man took a turn towards the greenhouse, where golden light glowed from within the glass walls, incubating the fanged geraniums. Oh, fuck no.
“Harry, are you sleeping?”
To Potter, Draco said, “Yes, I can. You’re an auror, you should know you can’t just go traipsing around the countryside like a lost spirit. But you also can’t stay in my kitchen twenty-four hours a day. So I’ll put you in the guest room.”
Malfoy hadn’t been joking about the tour.
Coward. Always a coward.
He spent another few minutes watching the Erumpent make its daily migration from one half of the distant field to the other. It went slowly, though Harry knew from personal experience that it could move much, much faster. Harry watched it till it was out of sight, until enough time had passed that a certain blond could have reasonably eaten and left.
“Most modern non-magical bakers use machines to do much of the work of baking bread, including kneading.” He sniffed. “It’s more efficient—if you don’t care for flavor. Here, we make our bread by hand.”
“All right,” he says slowly. “You can do that. But if you do, then we
Harry sets down his cup. He tells Hermione everything from the beginning, starting with Robards calling him into the office and Harry’s excitement at getting the case, which was quickly banked when he saw Malfoy’s name. The nature of the case—
Malfoy kissed him. It was softer than their last kiss, and brief. No tongue. Just Malfoy’s moist lips and breath.
He regarded Luna with his experienced Auror’s eye and tried to detect any hint of playfulness there, but she only smiled at him in her guileless way and said, “Would you like a turkey egg? I hardboiled several this morning, but there are some fresh eggs if you’d like an omelet.”
“Berk. I hate attention. Right up there with Binns’s lectures.”
Around him, the shield gleams like an oil slick. He can’t see beyond its brightness to his attacker. The part of his brain that remains tactical and removed—ever the auror—notes how vulnerable he is. But it doesn’t matter really, does it, if the man is readying another curse. There’s a fist around his windpipe, and the edges of his vision darken. He’ll be gone, anyway.
“Oi!”
“Beef tartare.”
Grey eyes snapped to his, narrowed, and then widened. “No. You
Malfoy serves the shortcake, strawberries, and cream by hand. When he produces a second plate, Harry wants to tell him not to bother, that it’s all right, he doesn’t mean to intrude on his breakfast, but he can’t get the words out, not with Malfoy arranging the food with efficient movements, eyes trained on the food, the line of his shoulders stiff.
“It was Hills and Bate. They were looking for dark artifacts.”
He scoffs as he opens it, shaking his head, flipping through pages and pages of complete text. He bites the inside of his lip. He can’t take this with him. Records will show that it was sent to him. It won’t be long till it’s missed.
“No. I
. He frowned and skimmed the contents. At the word
A quick search around the kitchen and drawing room show no missives sent by owl.
The next day, Harry returned to the attic. He levitated all of the oldest chests with their failing wards against one wall, all of the sheet-covered portraits against another, and everything from Sirius’s time to the other side of the room. There were odds and ends that didn’t quite fit into any of those categories, and Harry left those piles in a haphazard group in the center of the space.
And so here he was two weeks later, faced with the problem in need of his solution.
As if hearing his thoughts, Malfoy whispered an incantation, and a ball of gentle rose gold light floated from his wand like a bubble. It briefly illuminated his face, then drifted lazily into the air. He turned to find Harry watching him, and his face creased. “What? We aren’t going to fly in the dark.”
“What? I haven’t— I haven’t seen you in six years, and I figured—I don’t even know what you’ve been up to.”
So, the case opened back when he was out. That makes sense. Though he’s not sure how it makes him feel. It’s like he’s lost step with the department, like he’s not quite part of the team, and he hasn’t been able to shake the feeling—especially since every time he thinks he’s caught up, that he’s regained his balance, something like
“You’ve eaten here before,” Harry said, with a grin.
Harry can’t help it. He has never careened from professional behavior before, not like this, but he’s been cooped up in an office for months, and— It’s Malfoy.
. Then he remembered he’d had Luna order for him.
“Hello?” he called into the maze.
Harry didn’t give him the satisfaction of agreeing, although he did finish the pear.
. That little terror. Hold on. Lift your foot.” She cast a
Harry couldn’t tell if the expression on Malfoy’s face was enraged or disbelieving or— Malfoy dipped down for a quick, bruising kiss. “Fuck me. I want you to be inside me when I come.”
They do not postpone the hearing.
Malfoy breaks the silence. “What are
” His face is a terrible puce color. The tip of his finger is white.
Hermione-in-his-head was right, of course: it would just take more time to get comfortable with the changes.
“And if Malfoy uses force to resist?”
Malfoy lived in a terraced house in Chiswick. Harry wasn’t sure what to make of the scene as he walked up the brick-paved pathway past benches, a trimmed lawn, and topiary. A fountain burbled at the center of the front garden. One slender tree stood before each door. The location both surprised him and didn’t. The neatness reminded him of Malfoy Manor’s tidy grounds. It was, however, distinctly muggle.
Harry stayed for another hour after, drinking more of the paint-thinner Malfoy called brandy, just enough that he got a bit insistent in his worry about the hearing, the lack of a newspaper article, the lack of Hermione.
Shit shit.
Malfoy sniffed.
“Uh,” Harry said, still ensconced in his chair.
Alarmed, he checked the wards again; they must have been malfunctioning because they told him no one was there.
He gathers them all and tamps them into one pile and drops them in the outbox. If there’s one thing he’s learned in adulthood, it’s that it is often more effective to leave with a softly closed door rather than a slammed one. No use leaving a mess of an office and giving Robards more to be angry about. Especially if he’s just earned himself a place in Malfoy’s investigation as another suspect.
Well. True enough.
“No. This is mine.” He took another sip of the red beer. “What am I supposed to be tasting?”
“Which is it, Malfoy? Yes, or no.”
“Until next time,” Ginny deadpanned, eyeing Captain.
Harry wakes with a jerk. He is sitting up, his neck stiff. He’s not in his bed; he’s in a chair in a room lit green. The light flares, the bright hue of the killing curse.
“Here,” he says. He pulls them off, shrinks them, and stashes them in the pocket of his muggle jeans. Malfoy’s eyes widen, and Harry looks down at himself. Black knitted jumper—one of Hermione’s gifts, which are a tad more work-appropriate than the rough, loving Weasley jumpers—the jeans, and comfortable leather loafers.
Malfoy ignored him.
something much too tender about this moment—Harry broke the tension by lapping sloppily at Malfoy’s palm. Malfoy squeaked his protest, but Harry gripped his hand before he could pull away, and smiled against it.
“They’re doing what they can for him,” Hermione says briskly. “They’ve made a lot of strides in the last few years, you know.”
“Well, you
The library was, predictably, full of books. Not like Luna’s narrow maze of a library, but more like Hermione’s: neat shining wooden bookcases from floor to ceiling, books each nestled with their spines lining up.
Draco stalked around the garden, looking for the culprit. This time, without a muggle to witness him, he let out a high-pitched whistle. He held the tip of his wand to his lips to augment the call, warping it to sound...well, a lot like a whale song.
“Well, well!” Ginny exclaimed, holding a hand to her chest.
Draco opened his eyes. He pushed aside his tea cup and plate, summoned parchment and a quill and, staring intently at the page, said, “Tell me all of your symptoms.”
Edward let out a low whistle. “You need help with that blackberry.”
Malfoy flipped another page. “Are you done with that pile yet, Potter?”
“That’s why Hermione didn’t come back to make plans with you. She didn’t have to. You already had this all planned out. And you didn’t say anything.”
“Then I don’t need to say a thing to you. ‘Voluntary,’ it says, right here. I hardly see the point of calling it
Hermione stands. “Then I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Harry couldn’t help himself. He stepped forward and cupped Malfoy’s jaw and kissed him. The kiss felt like a natural extension of the moment, both of them windblown and ecstatic. Malfoy’s breath was warm against Harry’s mouth, panting and just as full of the night as Harry.
Harry, miserable and helpless, could only witness it along with Malfoy.
!” Harry made a drunken grab for the paper and managed to catch it on the third go.
Harry sidled past a chest of drawers and an armoire to the side of the bed, where Malfoy stood, watching him.
“Brilliant,” he said. “Two it is.”
“The only thing the healers at St Mungo’s were able to tell was that my current state probably has something to do with the potion and not just the spell. How they react together, or something. But since they didn’t know the spell or the potion, there wasn’t much they were able to do, as you can see. They recommended I visit potions experts who had more experience with the…esoteric theory of potions.” Potter flapped his hand and made a face. Then his expression darkened. “The ‘experts’ they recommended found me very
. The structure of the airport, the street in front of him, the multistory car park beyond that.
He turns with a plate arranged with a meat turnover, a cherry tartlet, and an almond horn.
Harry gave him a once-over, from soft-looking t-shirt to bare pale feet. “Looks good to me. After the night before last, I kind of thought clothes were optional.”
“I am now.”
“What?”
“After he’d fallen unconscious?” Robards says.
Harry cast the Fitting Charm and miraculously got it right on the first try. Malfoy raised his eyebrows slightly, which was his only acknowledgement of Harry’s success. He turned to look in the mirror again, made a minute adjustment to the hat’s placement on his head, then removed it.
Catching each other’s eyes before they all apparated back, Ron and Harry were secretly grateful for the end to their puzzle solving for the day. They weren’t Remus, or Hermione, or even Draco, and as the hours trickled by without a single lead, they began to wonder if they should involve the intelligent people in their lives.
“Kingsley wants us to pick the next case and get started,” Draco read from his phone screen in strangely sharp tone.
Confused, Remus nodded.
You guys are the actual best readers a gal could ask for. This is the second-to-last chapter!
Harry saw the commotion at the window and needed to put on his glasses to understand it. “Owls,” Harry realized.
Just as quickly as the blonde couple had appeared, they left with a regal air about them and with Harry to clean up after them.
“And you can keep me updated on your weird, weird sex life.”
“See you in detention,” Harry scowled. This was entirely Draco’s fault as far as he was concerned and he was not going to let the other man forget it.
They weren’t entirely unused to that. Filming all over America seemed to prove that Americans did have one thing in common—they wanted to be on camera.
Harry, on the other hand, awoke to his husband shaking his head at him.
“So Theo never came back to this place?” In all honesty, Ron was just bored and needed conversation to keep him from falling asleep while walking. He wasn’t built for this either.
“Come here,” Draco beckoned. Harry obeyed without question.
“Ah, of course.” Draco reached for his charmed bag and produced the clothes for Harry. “Please, wash up all you like. I’ll be back in a moment with nightclothes.” Draco was acting like the perfect gentleman host, and smiling like he was ready to take a bite out of Harry.
“Of course I am!” Harry responded emphatically, throwing his arms around his fiancé. “You’re gonna be my Daddy, forever.”
Theo, who could care less, would forget the entire conversation an hour later. All he would know was that there was a ring box in his pocket and he was no closer to an answer than he had been when he saw the damn thing behind glass.
Harry gave him a look of mock-sympathy. “I know, I know. You’ll miss me horribly. But hey, after work you are entirely welcome to bring Rose and Hugo over for a play-date so you can tell me all the inane things you’re forced to investigate and the cold cases that are going nowhere.”
In their separate rooms the men dreamed of vibrant fabrics in all colors, desserts, and each other.
The receptionist hurriedly began shifting through papers, knocking a nearby soft drink over in the process. The poor thing was jittery in the face of fame. “Sure thing, yes,” he hurried before yanking up a small file. “The applicants were sent through Doctor Hart. Her office is just down the hallway and to the right, where she’s weeded out the applicants. There was a bit of an, er, information spill.”
“Yes,” Harry allowed, closing his eyes.
“Baggage at Zone 2.”
“She can’t stop being a witch,” Harry cut in.
“There are such things as public computers, Draco,” Harry said through gritted teeth. “Just because someone has internet access doesn’t mean it’s impossible for them to be poor.”
Harry and Draco, having both been holding their breaths, let the air rush out. “Damn,” Draco muttered.
“No fucking way.”
It was a jewel-tone based design, with fluffed pillows of violet on a sapphire bedspread with art of flowers on the walls, all gently blowing as if caught in a breeze.
The man sighed and looked down at the headline:
“But this is what you want?” Harry asked nervously. That was a question he’d asked too many times.
After placing a light wood desk, a laundry bin, and a trashbin all with flicks of his wand, Draco tried to think of what he used most often. The closet was fully stocked, a walk-in with seemingly endless drawers on either side. “Ah,” Draco said when he realized what was missing. He expanded a decorative mirror to hang on the wall adjacent from the bed.
“Who does this red arse belong to?” Draco demanded, bringing his hand down again.
Harry narrowed his eyes.
“I’m not a lawyer, and unless you’ve forgotten, your stay here is not negotiable.” The Ministry had been sure to lock them up for good this time.
“And you didn’t tell me?”
It took Harry a few seconds to actually figure out where they were, but everything lined up when he smelt the air. They were by the sea, and another Auror was face-down in the sand. Ron rushed to make sure he still had a pulse—and thank Merlin, he did—while Harry’s presence seemed to intimidate the criminal enough to get them to freeze on the spot.
All Remus could really do was kiss him back. “It sounds as if you’ve made up your mind.”
. If you close your eyes, you can hear them all sometimes. You can see the men and women being trafficked into the sex trade in Thailand, you can smell the gunpowder on the hands of the shooter from Virginia Tech, and you can feel the heat around you like you’re in one of those riots in Venezuela against their dictator. They’re people, Zeke.”
“Ouch,” Draco grumbled, fumbling his hand back to rub where Harry’s shoulder hit him. His knuckles brushed against Harry’s back in the process, giving Harry a rather embarrassing shiver. “Quit being dramatic,” Draco said as if Harry’s shiver was from the cold.
“Like what?” Harry asked. The original ones seemed like pretty good parameters.
,” Kennedy sighed. How many times did she have to tell him ‘Computer Face’ was not a witty nickname?
“Slytherins!”
Before they could so much as get a clear shot of the apartment building that Lorraine lived in, a sandy-haired man who’d been leaving the building as they arrived walked right up to them and began pestering them with questions.
submissive, what a mad and brilliant thought. “I haven’t thought about it much,” Harry admitted, biting his lower lip as he considered it. “How about… Snitch?”
Harry gave him a stiff smile. “Sure.”
Harry nodded, putting his fork down a moment. “My motivation was okay today. We’ll see how it is over time. At least two days out of the seven you’re all mine.”
Theo shook his head. “He shared a house with some of his classmates. I think he went to some muggle university that had the word ‘California’ in its name. University of California? College of South California? Yeah, I have no idea.”
“Absolutely not,” Draco resisted, panting growing heavier as he thrust into Harry with all of his weight behind him.
The office for Safeword was not at all what Harry had been expecting.
After Harry took the first bite Ron accepted that as a signal to start, and quite liked the taste from the look on his face. Harry smiled to himself, softening at how easy it was to calm his best friend with food. “I know. I’m sorry I worried you, but did you really have to go and do that? With that many people? You know how I feel about people knowing my private business.”
Sure, sure, that was sharing confidential information with a citizen, but Harry had learned a few things about there being a means to an end in some situations. Harry wanted this to end more than anything.
“Grace?” Harry asked again weakly.
“This isn’t funny. You’re sick.”
“But first—“ Draco reached for a small box on the table behind him. “A gift, if you wish to wear it.”
“Busy, father,” Draco told him through the door, wondering if he could take the purchase back.
“Great!” she responded. “Then your mum will be too drunk to remember me and your father will forget me in a day if things go terribly.”
“You okay?”
Closing his eyes, Harry let his hips cant upwards so that he could get the best of Draco’s warm skin on his and the pressure of his thumb making torturous laps around Harry’s prickhead.
. That’s insane even for you!” Harry laughed. Ahead of them on the beach Alvaro turned around for a moment and they remembered that they weren’t alone.
?” Draco turned around to face him, arching a brow.
“I cannot thank you enough,” Draco had said for their acceptance and assistance.
“To ask permission to cheat on me?” she snapped.
Jasper or
Harry rolled his eyes to himself when he walked away from the man at the counter to go check on his precious and oddly specific coffee brew. Harry had once out of pure curiosity poured himself a cup of what that arrogant blonde man drank every morning to absolutely disastrous results. Harry had never felt like a drink was literally kicking him in the face like this did.
“There had to be a theme?”
“Every girl should have a library,” Hermione told them both with a glint in her eye. Lily could be the brightest witch of her age, too.
Yet, on the other side of the room in a case where Theo kept his spare contacts was the heavy golden ring that he hadn’t done a blessed thing with. Colin didn’t know it was there, and Theo wondered if it should stay that way.
A little stripper glitter could solve that problem. In fact, it could solve many global conflicts in Draco’s humble opinion. Maybe countries wouldn’t be upset enough to bomb each other if the UN held strip club meetings.
“Then can I distract you from this terrible day with some news that will make you laugh at me?”
“Four months now,” Harry answered proudly.
“What? No, I’m in the middle of something.” This was a disaster and Theo didn’t even care, he was going to finish the job.
, Grace. Miss liberal lefty,” he reminded her. ‘Was’ happened to be the operative word in that sentence, though. “I’m not homophobic. It just shocked me, okay?”
The man tilted his head to the side. “I’m afraid that’s incorrect. That room only has one bed.”
“Yeah, mate, and that’s what worries me,” Ron came out and said flatly.
Whatever shocked or offended looks the Malfoy-Potters downstairs had, none quite matched the way Grace’s face had twisted in horror.
Harry didn’t hesitate in it, either.
“’Random’ security checks,” Alvaro laughed and straightened his shirt collar. “Gotta love ‘em.”
He wanted warmth, but not like the mucky hot weather he was enduring. Draco wanted that skin-tingling closeness where he forgot whose feet were whose and they were consumed by the moment.
“I did no such thing, Draco,” Harry replied tiredly. “Why in the hell would I do that? Did you plan this?”
“And now you
“You’ve been forced into a taxi because her father is a muggle and refuses to leave the child alone with us.” It was the father’s right, but Pye really wished it wasn’t. “So we’re killing three birds with one stone. I register the girl with the Ministry, you run circulatory tests, and the specialist continues his analysis of how to keep her little hiccups of magic to a minimum.”
? Well, Malfoy-Potter now.
“Good.” Pye straightened out his robes and huffed again. “Know I am watching you, Malfoy. I am watching your every move, as I always have been, documenting the evidence it will take to have you kicked out of here for good. Merlin, what’ll it take, photos of your incompetence and shenanigans?”
“Hermione,
“Yeah,” Harry answered with no hesitation. “But you’ve already done a good job of that yourself. I feel at ease here—you can hardly tell it’s the same place as before.” The same place they wrestled for their wands and Draco ‘lost’ them to Harry as he escaped.
“Go on,” Harry encouraged. “It’s not my only gift, but it’s the only one I could give to you in mixed company.”
good.” Draco peppered Harry’s forehead with kisses. “Now, shall we head to the bath?”
The audience ‘ooh’-ed and ‘ah’-ed.
First, she had to take care of the baby matters. Her son’s happiness always came first.
“Am I what?” Harry asked anyway. Feigning obliviousness was the only way he could bring himself to answer Ron’s pressing question.
Draco sighed. He really hadn’t wanted to have this conversation, but there was no escape. Draco couldn’t just flop back down and pretend to sleep, so he had to go forward. “Yeah, is that really so much of a shock? You’re not horrible.”
Draco turned to look Harry in the eyes, slightly shocked. “Are you sure? We could both work half-time, we could get a sitter…”
“Brilliant. That’s brilliant,” he breathed.
Ron let out a big sigh. “Okay, Harry. Have it your way. I’ll send a bloody owl. Merlin’s arse. Next time you shack up with a War Criminal why not just give one of your best mates a shout, hm? That’s all it would have taken to know you were okay. I panicked, alright?”
Draco huffed and made his way past the trio of losers on a path back to his locker.
When Harry rushed into the park to greet his husband with an arm around his waist and a kiss on the cheek, Grace knew that there was no way in hell Harry could hide something from Draco. The man was transparent and wore his heart right on his face.
The decline of pureblood culture left house elves with masters few and far between, with others finding minimum-wage jobs in inns and restaurants and beginning to form communities with the help of Ministry workers like a certain Misses Hermione Weasley.
“Oh, you
Well, that was satisfying. Draco got a grin out of Harry actually listening to him for the first time and from the way Harry’s breathing seemed to have evened out, he really was listening.
“Harry,” an exhausted Hermione greeted. “Harry, are you okay?”
Draco laughed even brighter, hands propping himself back up on his elbows so he could see every little reaction of the very naked Harry Potter to unveiling the cock he supposedly wanted to suck. Honestly there Harry was kissing him and touching him and still Draco found it too good to be true that Harry could even ever fancy him, let alone to this extent.
“Let me show you the third floor,” Draco nodded and stepped away.
“Exactly—“ Draco cut himself off with a grunt, pulling up to slam his hips back down again. “What I needed.”
“How’s work?” Lucius changed the subject. Harry was certainly tolerable when he wasn’t spouting out the leftist beliefs his bushy-haired Granger-turned-Weasley put in his head.
Harry walked around the side of the bed and climbed on, slinking his way across the comforter. Harry turned so his arse was facing Draco and propped himself up on his hands and knees once more. His legs were spread far enough apart and his body bent over just enough to see glimpses of his panties under his fluffy skirts.
Henry had held back tears in front of the camera when the sisters quietly admitted it was all a joke, and it was all very repressed and masculine. At least that was what Draco called it as they walked back to the network car after filming was over. Harry had just been holding the camera and letting Draco do the talking.
“I have friends on a few of them,” Harry shrugged, taking a tome from the shelf next to the bed. “Oliver Wood did a stint in the Cannons, and Ginny’s on the Hollyhead Harpies.”
Draco finished applying the mask and waited for it to dry the customary ten minutes, hopping up to sit on the counter of the bathroom to watch Harry attempt to comb his hair. “You’re lying if you say you don’t think about height,” Draco told him. “You’re about three feet tall, and you so have a preference for men who are tall but don’t tower over you.”
“I don’t understand this,” Hermione said plainly. “At first when I came in here I thought you might be charmed or given a love potion, but I can see that isn’t the case at all. You have none of the signs.”
After several flanking orders and forward assaults, the enemy had been driven into the corner of the second floor.
No. He wouldn’t let their opinion weigh him down. Draco was there to educate.
Pansy went right back to pouting.
Draco nodded slowly. He was still going through the personal repercussions of his life being exposed, and hadn’t even begun to think about the repercussions this could have in his career. “Yeah,” he said quietly. “Some people wouldn’t see me not because of my past but because of my perceived sexual orientation. Isn’t that mad? The first one I understand, but this...”
“I accept. Shake on it?”
“Am I sensing doubt that we would?” Draco asked with narrowed eyes over his drink. Or maybe they were just half-lidded from all the alcohol.
“Yeah? I’m honored,” Draco grinned. “I have the gift of being very comfortable naked wherever I go, so I unfortunately cannot relate.”
At his wedding, there would be strands of paper lanterns. The reception would be outdoors, so that everything white could contrast off of the dark night sky. They’d count the stars together; Theo just knew it.
“She needs a bra, Remus,” Molly finally pushed out of her. It was good to get that off of her chest. Metaphorically. “At age twelve, women start developing breast buds.”
slut. What ever are you going to do when I have to go back to working during the day?”
“So demanding.”
“SLYTHERINS!”
“Fine, one, whatever it takes to have you never talk about my love life in public ever again,” Draco huffed, waving his hands dismissively. Pansy intentionally incorrectly took that as a gesture for a hug and went in for a tight one. “Why are you like this,” Draco hissed into the constriction.
“I do, too,” Draco replied softly. “Maybe, just maybe I wouldn’t hate wearing a Weasley sweater.”
After swallowing his last bite of cupcake Draco allowed himself to laugh. “The Golden Boy had never even eaten gold—what a tragedy. I did it to right that wrong,” Draco answered cheekily.
“Remus,” she tried slowly before giggling at the informality of it. “That’s fine.”
But Harry didn’t want the world, he just wanted Draco. He opened his eyes. “Could you… please be rough with me tonight?” Harry asked through his blush. Asking for what he wanted was getting easier each time he tried it, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t damn hard. “Show me no mercy.”
The first picture was all the two men needed to take interest in the case. A copper-skinned, muscular, beautiful man was standing in front of the New York skyline giving the camera a sultry look. Draco immediately zoomed in on those eyes.
Draco toed his shoes off along the way, leaving his socks too in the trail leading up to the bed. The next thing he knew he was flat on his back on the bed, no recollection of how he’d gotten there. “You know what we should get you?” Draco asked as Harry crawled in next to him.
Harry and Ron both stood, confused. “What’s going on here?” Ron asked, at least ten thousand percent sure that Lucius had flipped sides to being a Death Eater again. This was a shit time to do it and break his buddy out of jail, too.
“Well. If that’s the way you feel—“
She stood up quickly and followed him as he left. “Wait!”
Theo was in a plush, silver-trimmed armchair shaking his head. “You’re ambushing him, you lot. Let him actually breathe a little,” Theo suggested.
Harry crossed his arms over his chest. “Then maybe you shouldn’t have done this in the first place,” he huffed. “I of all people know how intimidating your parents can be, which if you don’t know, is
Harry hadn’t even realized he’d forgotten the ever-important ‘Sir’.
“Stop being a wimp about this,” she snapped. “Just tell me how you watched my mum die.”
“Then it sounds like we have only the best of the best for our Quidditch team,” Draco countered. He couldn’t let anyone see him get nervous. “Do remember how that plays into the House Cup. If you think the odds being against me have deterred me in any way you do not know how I get when I want something.”
“Maybe they’ll cure the common cold,” Harry fantasized. “Or stop global warming.”
“Want a blowjob?”
This time it was Harry’s turn to haul Draco in for a kiss, burying his hands in that gorgeous, soft blonde hair he’d always dreamed of touching.
“This all shocking and new to you?” Draco asked with a grin to try and mask his concern as the other hand slathered his cock in lube.
“You like that, hm? Accusatory? Slut, whore, trollop of ill-repute come to sneak into Daddy’s bed?”
“But you didn’t think it would happen so soon? Oh, Remus. Womanhood is never on a schedule.”
“I’m not a racist,” Draco sighed from his spot by the head of the dining room table. “And you know I don’t believe in any of that bullshit my parents taught me. Not anymore.” When Harry still didn’t respond and crunched away at his toast, Draco tried approaching him. “Don’t you know I got past that?”

“I was going to tell you later,” Remus said, giving his husband a look before stringing an arm around his shoulders. “But we want to take you shopping so you can fill it.”
“What a good boy, can’t stop calling out for his Daddy,” Draco cooed, squeezing the tips of Harry’s nipples and dragging them as little of the space as he could far out from his chest and released with a scratch of his nails.
They picked the table right in the front to be sure that Brooke knew who they were and Draco ignored whatever flu or bug he’d picked up on their jet-setting travels, blaming his vulnerability to any illness on the stress he was under watching people make terrible romantic decisions. Still, the show must go on, right? “Rolling.” When Draco spoke the back of his mouth tickled.
“Potter?” Lucius demanded.
Maybe the world was divided like that: into people who had some courtesy and people who didn’t.
He made a sad little noise, realizing that this chiming tune meant Draco was being taken from him. It would only be a workday’s worth of time but that felt too long right now in the nascent state of their relationship.
“Tease,” he huffed before tossing the manila envelope onto Draco’s lap and stealing a quick kiss. Harry opened the file so that it rested on both of their laps, and seconds later he wished he hadn’t opened it at all.
“You really cleaned the place up since I last saw it,” Hermione tried as her next step forward in this bizarrely spotless world she’d stumbled into.
“Fuck grains. I’m going home, got it?”
Harry didn’t know how to respond to that. “I mean, never? Never in person. Sometimes in porn.”
Another frustrated noise escaped Draco. “You think I don’t know that? I’m not
Harry sniggered. “You really are never going to get over that theory, are you?”
“When did you get this?”
off of work?”
The man who’d been pushed in was younger, younger than Ginny even. Harry remembered being that young and depressed. “I,” started the man. “I have an invitation. To this.” He looked over Ginny’s shoulder trying to see within as he produced a piece of paper.
“Why is it taking so long?” he asked after a moment.
This specific raid was on the Thunder King, in an Asian-inspired palace that held the secrets of lightning and thunder.
“Goodnight, Professor Potter.”
Harry looked up at the door leading into the office space to see a man in a shockingly normal button-down holding it open for him.
Crossing his arms, Remus gave her a stern look. “Just because Draco and Harry are public figures doesn’t mean that you have to know all of their private details.”
“So then I saw the ring.”
She used her ashen wand to open the door next to her, waving for Draco and Harry to follow.
“Kennedy talked to a stranger on the internet and now she loves her. You know, like the lesbian kind of love,” Mary informed them. “So why can’t I talk to strangers?”
“You don’t have to worry with Remus and Sirius as your parents. They’re filthy rich.”
“Olivia,” he cooed sweetly as he turned to give her a goodbye hug. “You two have fun, and don’t be out past ten.”
Scanner gun in one hand and Harry’s hand in the other, Draco laughed at their audience and led his fellow future-father away.
No reaction to the stamp. Ginny sighed, but Draco felt he was onto something. There was something unique about that voice, something that scratched at the inside of his skull and refused to stop. The younger one could be anyone, but the older one…?
“Just a thought,” Draco said, putting his hands up.
A rosebud blossomed before him in the Malfoy Manor gardens, and shyly tucked itself away when Harry moved on to the next one. In a sort of peaceful awe, Harry was reminded of just how much he loved magic.
“Shut up.”
Draco rushed up the stairs of the building, eager to get the hell out of there.
The conference rooms provided a modest amount of privacy, and usually had spinning chairs. Like every other hyperactive white boy, Draco
Lavender curled one of her own locks around her finger trying to decide whether or not she agreed with that. “But it was cool. You have to admit the whole thing with Clara being everywhere was cool.”
Pride came over Draco, and not just the kind he had for loving men. He was proud of himself, proud of Harry for taking everything he’d dished out so well. “Good,” Draco replied, fixing Harry’s hair as much as he could before resting his hands on Harry’s hips. “You did so well. Never be afraid to cry in front of me.”
“Well,” Harry said, face still a bit pink. “I think you’re fun too, Daddy. You make me happy, or… How do I put it…?” Harry searched for the words. “You make me feel like happiness is possible, not just with you but alone, too. I’ve had a lot of fun putting the greenhouse together, and soon the plants will be able to survive outside it. Hey, wait. Maybe that’s the perfect way to describe it. You’re like my greenhouse, safe and full of nourishment that lets me survive outside of it, too.”
With a long, wet kiss to Harry’s cockhead Draco found himself smiling. “You’ve been very good for me today, Harry,” Draco spoke against his salty skin. “I can tell you like it when I say you’re a good boy.”
. In his mind, he was just calling it like he saw it.
Harry knew it was for the best in the end. At least, that was what he hoped was the best. “That gives us four days, then.”
. “Your shirt.”
Harry was finally happy with Draco including him on decisions, which meant he was up for having a real conversation about what was going on.
Ron heard Hermione crafting the message in the other room and began snooping through what was on Harry’s nightstand. Two mugs, a dirty plate and a black scroll case—how odd, what was this?
“Mr. Potter?”
Harry blinked. Was this one of those themed dining things? So it wasn’t a BDSM thing? Harry couldn’t tell if he was relieved or disappointed.
“That’s my boy,” Draco encouraged. “My good, good boy.” Draco sealed the statement with an open-mouthed kiss, tongue exploring deep within Harry’s mouth. The raven-haired man suckled on his tongue, helplessly stuffed in both holes.
“Daddy,” Harry giggled, nightmare far behind him.
“What would be even more pathetic would be falling asleep at the bar.”
“Then why even email us?” Draco scoffed, ready to reach over Harry’s lap and close the tab for him.
A devious thought entered Draco’s mind and he couldn’t resist acting it out. He reached forward and tugged on both nipple clamps once more before pressing down to open them once again, removing them from Harry’s chest without warning.
“Percy’s Percy, always working and stuff. Charlie’s Charlie, happiest when he’s with the dragons. Bill and Fleur are saddled with the kids but it’s a good break for them, I think. George is running the shop with Angelina and they’re thinking of expanding to add a third location in Wizarding America,” he reported. Harry smiled at that, more than glad his seed money he’d put into Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes had done some good in the world. “And Ginny’s team is doing great if you’re keeping up with the Quidditch scores.”
“I have to go get something,” Narcissa said quickly, tossing her original plan of subtlety to the side in favor of making a statement. She got up from the parlor and practically ran to the kitchen.
When their lips finally did meet, Harry was determined to make Draco moan. It was a singular, unremitting goal that Harry immediately clung to, much like his teeth clung to Draco’s lower lip.
He applied the facemask in even but thick strokes, starting with Harry’s T-zone and working out. It was a fragrant and consistent solution that Draco caked on and thinned out with his fingers until Harry’s face was covered in an even green coating.
They set to work without the friendly joking and camaraderie they’d shared before. Ron and Harry knew when to keep it serious.
The kiss softened once Theo slung a leg around his Gryffindor, anchoring him there for a few seconds longer.
Teddy nodded. Draco’s shoulders released only slightly. “Can I see my godfather Harry?”
“Yes fucking way.”
The intensity lessened as time went on, but still Draco had night terrors about those pale hands holding him down so Nagini could feast. “Tom Riddle,” Draco said out loud. “It’s so strange to hear him called that.” If anyone dare spoke the name Voldemort had been given before his ‘ascension’ the madman would kill the speaker on the spot.
Draco’s frown deepened when he realized he wasn’t getting his break now. “Fine,” he huffed. “Thank you, then, and get on your way.”
Harry was seeing splotches of color in his vision, his cock having grown even harder to feel Draco enter him so fully. “I’ll miss you,” Harry said, voice stripped down to near-nothing. “At work. It’ll be harder to not touch myself like you ask when you’re not here to keep me disciplined.”
“Professor Potter, Professor Potter! Look at how tall I’ve grown!”
“Good.”
Ginny grinned from ear to ear and wrapped her arm around her man. “I think I’ll find a way to make it worth your while.”
Harry’s smile mirrored Draco’s when they saw each other for the first time in nine hours—oh, insufferable nine hours!—and they looked at each other as thieves to precious jewels each, greedy and reverent.
made fun of you for being queer.”
Pye snorted. “Your job assignment has nothing to do with your lineage. You’re the only Healer on retainer with experience with heart murmurs. This child has one on top of her magic, which is what our specialist found. You’re here to treat her heart.”
“Has he been to one your gatherings at your opium den?” Maggie teased. Even so, she wouldn’t put having an actual opium den past the Party Queen of Slytherin. Being with her had actually opened Maggie’s eyes to drugs she didn’t know existed.
They evacuated the bed in a rush to fill their stomachs. Sirius would be damned if he let a meal go by after starving for years in Azkaban. He’d promised himself behind those bars that he would never think about how a chicken wing would go to his thighs or how a cake could give him a little belly. Happiness was more important than vanity.
“Why not?” Grace asked, distraught. Things had been going downhill, but she felt she could turn it around like she always did.
Harry knew what Lucius was going in to do for Theo, for his son’s best friend, for Harry’s case, and for Remus and Sirius’ friend.
In the spirit of a warm Hogwarts welcome, she gave the new professor who was hanging around outside of the main entrance a smile. “Hullo.”
Turning his head to look out the window—since Harry obviously got the bed by the window—he saw what looked like a toy city below the setting sun. Everything was so small, like the people below were really just specs of dust in an old play-set. “At least we have a nice view.”
The last time they’d said something like that it had led to them announcing their engagement. Narcissa leaned forward in anticipation while Lucius braced for impact.
“You heard the man,” said another Auror. “Fall back!”
Harry was imagining at least seven different ways to poison Snape with the chemicals before him and Draco in the lab room.
It was a conundrum, and Draco had no idea how Remus dealt with that. Then again, Draco could remember a few curse words and dirty jokes being dropped by Professor Lupin. That had probably grown with age, and even more with the seventh years.
He changed into his pyjamas and night robes, more black on black, and put a shrinking charm on the luggage so it fit neatly in the corner of his trunk. Draco looked around the room, looked at the green light coming in from the lake, and felt content with himself for the first time in a long time.
“Hermione!” the panicked voice that could only be Ron Weasley called out from the other side of the door as he attempted to open it. Thankfully, Draco had had the sense to lock it. “I think it’s happening, Draco! She’s having contractions again, and fuck—I think her water just broke!”
“I’ve been trying to think of other ways, but if I don’t do it, Ron will.”
“What?” Harry demanded, eyes wide.
“I don’t know. Even the best researchers can’t figure out why some kids are magic and some are muggles. After all, that was what happened with your mother and mine,” Harry said honestly.
Well, at least Remus and Sirius could appreciate that.
“So you need to get her a training bra. I just thought I’d tell you, since you’d never gone through it yourself.”
“You can open this one,” Draco murmured into Harry’s shoulder when he saw the childish shimmer in his eyes.
The Slytherins were, after all, the few people who knew the truth about Harry and Draco’s second meeting and what magazine it had gone through. Draco didn’t want to suspect his friends, but he no longer knew quite what to think.
From Harry’s perch on his hotel bed, felt a tiny jolt of shock that some man in Draco’s past relationships had fucked him over. He knew he shouldn’t be surprised because he’d run into his fair share of bad men in dating, but it just shocked him that it happened to Draco, too.
Several thoughts surfaced at once.
The Farmer’s Market closest to Malfoy Manor was a tiny little spit along the side of the road but a thirty minute walk away. A gathering of tents, canopies and stands that were much more than their rickety craftsmanship would imply. The fruits and vegetables in the baskets being sold were as fresh as they came, and Draco often shopped there so he knew at least everyone’s last name.
“The Prophet’s article on you, while invasive and mortifying, has boosted our subscriptions up one hundred ten percent. I know you never wanted to be a martyr for magazine sales, I know you never wanted to be a martyr period in the War, but it’s because of you this magazine can even exist in the first place. You think Tom Riddle’s world order had room for ‘sexual deviancy’ as those fascists would put it?”
A clearly disturbed shop attendant came to them. “The woman’s section is in the back,” she said, trying to corral them away from the entrance and checkout lines chock-full of muggles.
“I hope so, too.” Harry wanted his best friend to be able to visit, to see how much things had changed with the house and with Draco. He knew Hermione still had reservations but was being amicable for his sake, and he wanted to reward that with further glimpses into how kind and generous Draco could be.
Draco pressed the buzzer for flat 2A.
All Grace could imagine when he said that was Draco and a small, blonde girl in a toy shop. Her child would be blonde she decided as if she had any control of it, and would look nothing like Zeke, because it would be Grace’s girl. In her mind she looked like Grace had as a child.
Draco had to worry not only about how the students perceived him, but how their parents would in their darling children’s letters home. If he was too stern would he be fulfilling a stereotype? It wasn’t necessary for the students to shower him in platonic adoration or anything, but Draco hoped a few of them might actually see him for who he was, and that they might like that.
Draco sighed again, dramatic as ever. He was on his bed while Harry occupied the other one. Neither of them were feeling productive enough to take off their day-clothes so they just lay down in rumbled outfits.
It was Harry Potter now he couldn’t get enough of, always wanted to be with, and again, the physical attraction on both sides was hot enough to melt paint.
A barked laugh left Harry’s throat, leaving him even more embarrassed than his current level of flustered. “I mean, wow, I just… I just never thought that you could think of me like that,” he replied sheepishly. Oh, Merlin, was he fucking this up? Draco was giving him an opportunity and he was fucking it up.
Street.”
Lucius paled; Narcissa snorted a very unladylike laugh and covered her mouth.
“I saved all the ones he sent over the chat room. Let me just, ah, pick some out to show you,” he said carefully, knowing he’d have to hide the nudes before he let Draco and Harry see anything.
Deciding it would be more fun this way, Draco played dumb. “That I was what? A Quidditch player? A Professor?”
“I don’t want to cause Remus any more pain.” That night was a full moon, too.
“With you pregnant and clearly emotionally disturbed?” he almost laughed.
“See,” he replied. “I can understand anything with time.”
The back of Draco’s throat was hit with a rush of Harry’s seed, already prepared to swallow it down in greedy gulps. Draco kept sucking the oversensitive member listening with great delight to how Harry expressed his gratitude in shaky little moans that were almost sobs. He pulled off once he’d been drained entirely, sending a signature smirk Harry’s way. “We can do that later, if you like.”
The more she went over it in her head, the more sense it made. Grace could close her eyes and see a little kid running around that house with their siblings, and how Draco would read them a bedtime story as Harry tucked them in.
They found their room at the end of the hall and to the left and much to Draco’s dismay, the key fit in the lock. If it hadn’t, he could have complained to the manager some more and demanded an upgrade based on that even though there were ‘no other rooms available’.

The scene unfolded before Draco and Harry as they watched in awe.
“Good,” Harry whispered, a tear rolling down his cheek and a sniffle wracking his body. “Good. Can you untie me?”
“I don’t really want it to stop,” Theo clarified, since he was officially unclear on everything. “I mean, I bought it for a reason.”
They were the only chance of anyone showing up at his grave, and they were a slim chance. For that, he hated them.
“Yeah?”
“He probably doesn’t either,” Lucius pointed out.
“What, do you think they have a point or something?” he asked when Draco remained silent.
“Even when I’ve got these poofy flowers in my hair?” Theo questioned playfully, feeling himself recede into his shell. The moment had passed, and he still hadn’t asked Colin to marry him. Maybe there’d never be the right moment, he feared.
Harry did so, settling into the couch hoping he looked enticing enough. To Draco, though, he was irresistible in any position.
“Yes, sir,” Harry replied lowly.
The rest of the bedroom was just as beautiful. Remus and Sirius had gone wild looking through catalogues and stores to find every tastefully-placed accent, and had charmed the drawers in her desk to hold much more than they let on.
“Merlin, I’ve caused this,” Ron said grimly between shoveling down bites of his meal.
“Did you two, like, fight together? Like wizards on the telly do?”
“Much better than okay.” Draco shuddered. He started to move his hips again on Harry, rocking back to take him in all the way each time. “Move with me.”
Harry hadn’t actually expected him to say ‘yes’, but there it was on the screen all pixelated and such. Hm. Should he go through the archives of downloads that he password-protected in his phone?
Draco raised an eyebrow when Harry backed off of his strong compliment with a pink tinge to his cheeks. “Thanks,” Draco said with a strange smile.
xxxxXXXXxxxx
“That’s it. I’m going to the checkout.”
Curious, Harry released Draco’s legs and they repositioned themselves so Draco was lounging back on the couch and Harry was straddling him, staring down at his lovely, angular face with pure affection in his eyes. “What sort of story?”
“Yes it is. Turn it on.”
“Well, don’t worry, I’ll let you go off to bed soon, but I wished to speak with you first,” Draco said, aiming his gaze at the silent two.
Harry barreled through the dining room to snatch a leftover piece of toast from the cupboards and made a mental note that a shopping trip was definitely in order.
“Then what is?” Grace questioned, turning to face him. Her eyes had puffed up from crying, but at the time she just looked angry with strands of hair having escaped the tight hold of her ponytail.
“Thank you,” Harry nodded.
The gardens they’d gone to on their date night were abundant and beautiful, along with the food they’d brought to eat. If it wasn’t for how Theo looked snoozing in the grass, Colin and his full belly would have fallen asleep beside him.
Draco smiled. “What do you see?”
“Now I’m offended!”
“You’re hard as I am already, my dearest trollop,” Draco boasted. “You love a little degradation during your pleasure.” Draco flipped Harry’s skirts back all the way so he could deliver a full-palm spank on both cheeks of Harry’s arse.
“Did you get enough sleep?” Lucius teased her lightly. This was nonsense that would hopefully be drowned by a cup of coffee.
Draco had finished a first and third floor, but that second floor had never quite fallen into place. It was more than unfinished to him, it was a damned mess, a mark, a stain on his conscience that couldn’t be rubbed away so easily.
“Here, love.” Draco set down Harry’s plate.
Apparently, Draco was going to have to protect both of his best friends. “So that only
“Oh, and you sure did a whole lot to stop it,” Ron recalled bitterly before turning back to Harry. “You weren’t answering our Patronus messages, Harry, and your shoebox was gone! Fuck, you have no idea how
“Pansy,” Draco said slowly. “That’s it. Pansy, you’re a genius!”
That sounded strangely good to Harry. “Yeah, go ahead,” he laughed. With his arm around Draco’s waist, he felt safe enough. Grace wasn’t laughing at them or belittling them for being together, so she was automatically on Harry’s list of straight people that he approved of.
“Neither can I, really. I’m just lucky that you’re still willing to shag me.”
Harry had been here before, but now it looked nothing like it once had. String lights in the shape of Eiffel Towers were strung about, creating a low light that made the dungeon look different than it had when they’d visited. Some furniture was rearranged but the most striking feature of the entrance room was the massive buffet of French food and drink in fountains placed to the side.
“I’m so proud of you, baby. I love you so much, do you know that? I love you like I love baths. Merlin, I love baths. Who was the first person to not jump in a lake to bathe, but instead filled up a warm tub? I’d like to give that person a medal. The Bath Medal.”
“Why don’t you tell him the story of what you did to that mob boss your first week there?” There was never any mob boss, but this was so much fun. Alex’s eyes had dilated behind his thick-rim glasses and he looked utterly terrified. Just what Remus wanted.
Now that piqued Harry’s interest. He nudged a foot between Draco’s under the covers. “Do you have to… participate? If you go, I mean.” Harry couldn’t help but be curious since this was an aspect of Draco’s sexual past and maybe even his future if Harry felt safe there.
“Words I’ll never hear from anyone but you, hm?” Draco joked, indicating it was time for them to walk into the flat. “Let’s ascend, then.”
“So she’ll be a Libra. You two are lucky, that star sign indicates not only intelligence but excellent communication skills. I bet she’ll be an early talker,” the woman gushed.
“Exactly like Carrie Bradshaw! I love that show,” she enthused. “Instead of covering dating in a muggle city you could cover sexuality in the wizarding world.”
They were one step closer to closing the case, which was certainly enough progress for Harry.
“You would really take
“Not too bad yourself,” Draco teased, rubbing the bulge in Harry’s briefs as a reward for being so sweet.
“I’m aware.”
She nodded before walking to close her closet door. “I know, but I want to.”
“I don’t know about children, father…” Draco rolled his eyes.
“And you got dressed up all for me,” Draco joked, receiving a jab in his side for his jest. “Ow! Rude, you’re so rude, how did you ever get hired here?”
Harry rolled his eyes fondly. He’d definitely seen the hot tub thing in movies. Still, he was relieved it wasn’t so early in the relationship. One day he’d be ready, and being inexperienced didn’t really scare him as much as it used to. Draco gave a fuck about him.
“These parties are traditionally held as masquerades to protect peoples’ identities. It’s how I apparently partied for years with Ginny bloody Weasley and never even knew it. We’d be looking for Pye while he was hiding behind a mask, and probably disguised with polyjuice potion or some other appearance-changing spell,” Draco spelled out. “But if we could identify an odd man out at the party, someone not on the guest list, it would likely be him looking to get a picture with one of these tiny muggle cameras you speak of.”
“Lucius would probably perish in frustration.”
“And you want the House Cup?” Harry said, grin forming once more. Nothing could keep Draco Malfoy down for long it seemed.
Harry leaned in close to kiss his neck. “So you’re not entirely opposed to the idea of naming her after my mother?” he asked, nudging his nose against Draco’s pale skin.
“I’m not miserable! I’m just also going to meet forty-nine other girls who aren’t the mother of my child. What if they’re annoying and won’t leave? What if they
Harry’s glasses were still on, fogged and askew as Draco fucked his face with no holding back. His own cock strained against his clothing, ridiculously turned on by Draco’s reckless abandon.
In return Draco felt quite spoiled with all that was laid out for him, reaching out to fondle Harry’s balls just because he could. He loved holding them in his hand, loved feeling how delicate they were knowing he could inflict such pain on them if he so wished.
Harry couldn’t help but agree, even though he had run out of words in which to express it. “Yeah.”
“Oh, please, let’s not get unrealistic,” Draco huffed. “Do you accept the terms?”
“Yes, we are,” Harry lied smoothly. “We take all of this into account, Lucius.”
“Is that him?” Draco asked with a lopsided grin.
Harry perked up at the stove, making up bowls of spaghetti to serve. “It went well? That’s great.”
“But he has a
“Er.” Draco began to sweat in his designer suit. “No.”
“Grace… Is there any chance—“
“You’re insane.”
“Fuck! You got me worried for nothing!” Draco yelled, frustrated.
“So polite, so sweet when you learn your lesson,” Draco purred in his ear. He put the crop back down on the table so he could press both palms to Harry’s arsecheeks, soothing the angry red skin giving off heat. “Look at you,” Draco marveled down at him, hands moving in slow circles. “Red in all the right places. I think you’re ready for me now.”
“I don’t think I can accept something this expensive,” Harry reiterated.
Draco kicked his legs up over Harry’s lap. “Yeah, because I save my hottest outfits for at home with you.” Having Grace live with them put their house-wide escapades on pause. “The second we’re finally alone and our baby is sound asleep, I’ll dress up for you.”
The licking became hurried, Harry’s head beginning to bob slightly as he focused on how his lips were sealed as tightly as possible around Draco, swallowing back when he could do so without choking. He came close a couple of times, something he figured Draco must have loved from the way he gripped the side of his head when his throat convulsed.
Sirius nodded in agreement. “And we have to get back home to our child-thing. I would suggest you both do the same.”
Harry was quite pleased at how that little lie went over. Draco’s fussiness was legendary, and Harry was glad to see it work out in their favor for once.
Potter was fit enough to draw crushes, that much was true. Draco sincerely hoped none of the students got a crush on him, because there’d be no way he could handle that gently. Best to nip it in the bud, make sure the kids knew that they were kids and he was the adult here.
Draco tried to hide his smile. “Kind of. I mean, let’s not jump to any conclusions,” he warned.
“Cooking is a great skill,” Harry tried. Why couldn’t he think of a word besides ‘great’?
The next part Harry had to read off of a cue card. He kept his tone as casual as he could, hoping not to sound like some news broadcaster. “Is the person they’ve fallen for telling the truth, or hiding behind lies?” Harry maintained his conversational tone. “Will they find love or heartache? No matter what happens, we’re here to solve the mystery. Catfish the documentary was one story, Catfish the TV show is yours.”
His husband didn’t let up. Draco kept a steady rhythm, humming happily as he worked, his own cock hanging hard between his legs.
Harry wasn’t sure how much he could move in the first place, world pleasantly fuzzy and foggy. He honestly couldn’t remember how but somehow Draco guided him to the chaise lounge, his hands feeling the red velvet curiously as he was lifted onto his hands and knees, knees still bound with his panties.
“No fucking way.”
Harry’s heart beat fast to see Draco open the box for him and pull out a collar of thick, black leather with a shining silver D-ring. Harry slid his tie off as fast as it would go. Draco beamed. “It’s beautiful,” Harry said, and bared his neck.
The sight that was revealed to Draco and prevailed onto his memory forever on was Harry Potter on his knees in a black-and-white maid’s costume, green eyes flicking up to meet his. Harry had a duster in-hand like he’d been sweeping the bedframe.
“I wasn’t finished.”
“What were you doing in Spain?” Harry asked.
When Harry saw his husband’s mortal combat with an albino peacock, he tucked away his wand and laughed. Years ago, Harry would have probably murdered the bird out of sheer fear and instinct. “Really?” he asked with relief.
Even from across the street, Harry could see the crease of concentration between the man’s eyes and the firm set of his mouth, slightly frowning. He had an uncommon shade of white-blond hair. Harry didn’t know why, but the sight of it sent a thrill through him.
“What’s that?”
His stomach twisted, and before he knew it, he was folding her into a hug. She smelled of something spicy, something floral. Her hair felt soft against his face. He didn’t realize how tense he’d been about this moment until it was here. As they disengaged, Ginny stepping back with a faint smile on her face, Harry realized that—although it was a comfort to see her again, and although hugging her was so familiar—she felt like a sister to him.
Of course he’s panicked, a calm, distant part of Harry thinks. The aurors are at his door and Harry Potter is asphyxiating on the floor of his entrance hall.
“Let’s see yesterday’s,” Harry said.
That earned a sharp look from Ginny.
He was going to miss Luna. It wasn’t the same with Hermione, who muttered to herself and asked brisk questions and expected him to have answers. He was going to miss the messy coziness of the hidden downstairs library.
They stepped out into the wind. Far below, people walked over a landscape of rocks to a place where, every so often, a plume of sea spray shot from a hole in the rocks and was carried sideways by the wind. It looked just like Malfoy’s art, but in motion. A number of people stood perilously close to the hole’s jagged edge, holding up their phones. There were no walls, no railing to separate them from the gaping maw in the rock and the water frothing furiously up through it. It was the kind of casual disregard for danger that Harry expected from wizards, not people without magic.
Alex’s mouth twists into a thoughtful frown. “The wizards who invented
“So I’ve been told.” Malfoy smirked, but the expression flickered when his fingers reached the cuff of his sleeve. He unbuttoned one, then the other. Hesitated for a breath. Pulled the shirt off.
Harry rolls his eyes.
“Fuck off,” Draco said into his skin.
Harry says,  “There was no raid. There was harassment by the Ministry. I was the lead investigator. I quit.”
Ginny didn’t meet his eye, but there was a smile on her face, and Harry didn’t trust it.
Harry patted his head. “It’s my hair.”
Next to him, Malfoy scrambles to his own feet and puts both arms out to steady Harry. “You stubborn—”
Malfoy showed Harry a few more basic drinks, and soon they fell into a rhythm: grinding beans, loading the espresso machine, steaming milk, pouring coffee, stirring in syrups, applying whipped cream, assembling sandwiches, removing rolls and desserts from the cases—all while insulting each other, to the amusement of Heather and the customers.
“They dump them into the water supply,” Harry says, recalling something he saw in the abstract.
“Oh,” he said, and glanced up at the Disillusioned clock, whose hand had crept into “afternoon lull.”
“Stopped to take in the sights?” Malfoy drawled.
Harry looked at these last two paintings the longest. Something about the dignity of that single sea stack rising from the surf struck him, especially placed next to the painting of the rocky well and its violent rush of water. The painting was Muggle, so it didn’t move, but he got the sense of powerful motion and sea spray.
“Mm,” Malfoy hummed, and the sound was so sensual, Harry almost made a noise in response.
“I’m off at two,” he said abruptly.
There was a short scuffle on the other side of the screen, though Harry almost wondered if he imagined it because Hermione never looked away from the camera. Her face expression briefly pinched. Then she said, “You know? Never mind. You’re on holiday. You can show us when you get home. Speaking of which, do you need us to meet you at the Portkey office? You shouldn’t Apparate after a big jump like that.”
She waved her wand and stepped forward, lighting what had to be a thousand charmed candles and lanterns at once. The light revealed a massive, multi-room maze, the entrance room covered in the same plush red cushion walls. This first room was furnished like a lounge. Harry imagined what the place would look like full, people of all genders and ages relaxing on the crimson furniture and chatting in fetishwear.
Harry grinned and gave him another kiss. “Horndog. You’ll make us both late.”
“’I’ve gotten graffiti marks on my front door,” Harry read on. “’And sometimes I swear someone is watching me. I don’t know if Vera even looks like her profile picture, but whoever has been vandalizing my house hasn’t been caught on camera. It might not be her, but I have a hunch that it is. Please, help me find her so I can talk to her about this and ask her to stop. Thanks, Wesley’.”
With a brow raised and a grin cocked on his face, Harry nodded. “Yeah, that we did.” He still wasn’t sure where this was going and why they weren’t naked right now, but he was willing to entertain whatever line of thought Draco was going down.
With a laugh, Remus nodded in agreement. It would be a regular family adventure.
ways.” It really had just been cheating with Severus’ book, but it had done wonders for his test scores. With a frown forming deeper on Harry’s face he searched for a way to sum these past ten years up. “After that I… I just kind of tried to live.” A weak summary, but an answer nonetheless. He didn’t know what else to say.
“Right, of course.”
Satisfied, Draco clicked his phone off. Even if he had a terrible day in detention with Potter, he had a hot WoW date that night with a man who believed him to be a sentient tortilla chip.
“With who?” Harry asked instinctually. They were two grown men who liked men living together—but not in a together sort of way—so they often judged each other’s romantic choices. Whether Harry brought home a bloke for one night or tried to make a relationship work with a guy, he always had to hear Draco’s opinion on him.
“We can stay in here the whole time if you like,” Draco offered.
“Ah, ah--!” Harry’s hands scrambled to clutch red velvet and brace himself against the thrusts Draco was giving him,
“Time will tell then, I guess.”
“It’s all your godfather-in-laws can seem to talk about at all,” Lucius muttered, casting the Lupins a look.
“And I’m a scared, stupid kid who got pregnant.”
The tea sat snugly in Harry’s hands and warmed them from the nippy weather outside. He’d climbed out of his window to make sure the Dursleys didn’t suspect anything and the walk to the metro was terribly chilly.
Harry wanted to take care of Draco in return, to bundle him up and hide him away from all the people who spoke ill of him, snuggled up together where nobody could judge them.
There was a massive tub that had a showerhead and jets. Harry yearned for a soak like that on his aching neck and shoulders.
Harry’s eyes travelled along the curve of his arse, and every other rise and fall in Draco’s shape with an overwhelming world of possibilities. He could wake this vulnerable Draco up any way he wanted to.
Harry shrugged. “There’s only a few things I insist on keeping, so, sure.” He took Draco’s hand and stood, admiring the mess of clothes they’d made on the floor.
Harry rolled his eyes and got on line to purchase the expensive garments. “Paying for the fabric,” he grumbled, looking over the price tags.
The road was bordered by shrubs on both sides. It was long and straight and disappeared into the distance. An occasional break in the shrubs showed an endless, flat scrubland.
“Maybe.”
Those enraged grey eyes; the study, filled with research.
Hermione and Ron asked him to come by. He declined. He couldn’t meet Hermione’s eyes through the floo.
He had also missed teaching. As he flew around the field, correcting forms and shouting advice, he thought about what Ginny had said about him teaching. The participants listened dutifully and fell into line. It made his heart swell to see them improve over the course of the morning and early afternoon.
Done, he tosses the file into the outbox. That leaves the other files scattered around his desk. Most of them are useless. They show nothing on Malfoy because there is nothing to show, though Harry still suspects that Malfoy may have somehow altered the trace on his house to protect his privacy. In any case, there’s no reason to copy them, too.
“What? Am I crazy for being angry at you not wanting a baby with a different skin color? Would a muggleborn baby kill you, too?” Harry demanded. Sometimes, Draco could seem so forward-thinking, and then he had to go say something stupid like that.
“I love you, Draco,” Harry said next, bringing a pink flush to both of their faces.
Harry Potter did a little tilt in front of the mirror trying to see himself from a new angle. He worried at his lower lip. The trap they’d set had to work. He’d done more technically dangerous things in his life, but the risk of being in another news cycle felt exceedingly perilous for his self-respect.
Sure, the place smelled like a hospital and was vaguely reminiscent of death, but Draco had actually met some really cool people.
The Slytherins howled in riotous amusement, and Draco’s chest relaxed. It was sort of funny, yes, and he knew how to work this crowd well. They were always on his side, but maybe he could get them to be a little less embarrassing about the situation by owning it.
“The response to the owl back home should be framed,” Eric suggested. “That way you can always capture the beauty of the moment where Ravenclaw changed the course of history.”
He’d closed up the shop for the afternoon to join his also self-employed boyfriend for a lunch date. While Theo’s career was in Potioneering—a service that many wizards considered essential—poor Colin had chosen a career in the arts. Sometimes he’d be working nonstop for weeks, and sometimes he’d be lying around the flat and shoveling down cheesy snacks for a month.
“Want to see my forty-main Ahn’Qiraj achievements as one of the first raids in the game?” Harry demanded, whipping out his phone and pulling up his character’s page from the armory app. “Or how about I show you the chat logs that date back to the fucking 2000’s? Do you want to see my holiday mounts, my transmog gear, my Loremaster title? Or here—have a look at this! Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Goddamn Windseeker! That’s epic loot and you know it. Fuck you if you think I’d do all that for you.”
“Yes?” Remus asked with a defensive edge.
Draco nor Harry could hear if anyone gave permission to fire but a spell came crashing through the front window either way, shattering it entirely.
The two lawyers beside Grace put a packet down in front of the arguing son and parent. “Sign your parental rights away,” the taller one offered. “Or have us take them away from you in a messy court battle.”
Draco murmured a summoning spell and in his hand appeared two black devices that Harry had never seen before. “I picked these up at Pride awhile back,” Draco narrated, bringing them up to Harry’s level of vision. “Nipple clamps. You want intense? I’ll give it to you with these.”
Draco and Harry didn’t need to turn around to know which teacher had caught them in the middle of a screaming match.
“The lock code on the side door is one, zero, six, eight—“
“Hey, what happened in that castle stays in that castle,” Blaise laughed.
“Harry Potter will miss me,” Draco said aloud, helping Harry to his feet with both hands clasped around his. “That’s never going to get old.”
“You and your modesty. Keep that in mind when making your decision about the first two years of the child’s life, yes?” Pye asked, bordering on patronizing.
“Happy birthday, Draco.”
he got one bed on purpose?”
“Nope!”
“The plan was originally the church in my home town, but I don’t think they’d appreciate the charmed invitations.”
“It does sound tough.”
Draco’s proper start involved getting a proper look at Harry. He’d sent the man back to his flat and given him thirty minutes to clean up—himself or the rooms, whichever was worse—before he could expect a home visit from Healer Malfoy.
“Checking out?” Maggie asked with a small grin from her position at the front desk.
“But The Doctor’s grave? The thing with River Song? You don’t think that can redeem the mistakes Moffat has made?”
That cut off Harry’s train of thought before it had so much left the station. “Yes,” he gasped. “That’s it, oh yes—“ Harry cut himself off when he felt the first wave of his orgasm come over him.
They said their goodbyes and were met with much teasing as to their departure.
Was Draco going to make him wait even more? Harry hoped it wouldn’t be long.
“What?”
Once they were both fully clothed and Draco had adjusted himself for the last time in the mirror he turned around with arms outspread. “Come here, pet. Give Daddy a hug before he leaves.”
Harry pushed Draco’s briefs down feverishly, his hands warm and his breathing uneven as he closed his fist around Draco’s length.
“Well, if neither of us hate each other,” Harry reasoned. “I guess we’re pretty much strangers again. I know you’ve been ignoring her owls—they keep scratching at the window in the mornings.”
Yes, a blonde man in a black suit with two drinks in front of him, both pink with lemons and twirly-straws. All seats next to him were open this early in the lounge’s evening schedule, and Harry stared at the one where the other drink was placed—no purse or sign of ownership. Could this really be him?
“Are you feeling alright?”
“Thanks for the pick-me-up, Pans. You’re excellent at this.”
“Eh,” Ron sighed. “I guess the Head Auror could deal with it.”
“Thank you for sharing, Ms. Lovegood,” the woman at the front of the classroom nodded. “Perhaps you can tell us how genital herpes is spread?” The health teacher was worried about these kids, honestly. If even intellectual Luna was bumping uglies with her classmates then there was no hope for abstinence at Ghat.
Olivia let out a little laugh. “Yeah, ‘course I’m doing well. Are you?”
“Of course,” she grumbled.
“How far back do these go?” Harry asked.
“Yes, really,” Draco grumbled like a child being forced to share his feelings for the first time. “I’ve come to see that you’re not as horrible as I used to think you were.”
Finally, Harry was in range.
There was certainly no arguing with that.
“I’m so happy, Draco. I’m so happy,” she responded, hands coming down from her mouth. “I’m going to be a grandmother.”
“I have to—Ah, get changed,” Pansy sputtered out before giving Maggie one of those ‘Don’t-Follow-Me’ looks.
“It is.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Remus and Sirius have it right. We should get the kids after they know how to manage their own bodily functions.”
“Hey, you weren’t the one with your legs open. Now carry me to bed,” Draco ordered imperiously, climbing off of Harry so that the brunette could do as he was told.
“Are you ready for your bath?”
Maggie dipped forward and gave their lips a messy, wonderful union. “Sleep well,” she told Pansy. “I’ll see you tomorrow at work.”
Marcus hadn’t been kind with the clue in the box beneath the earth. Harry almost wished they hadn’t found the damn thing so that Remus wouldn’t have to torture himself in divining the meaning of:
“It’s his shoebox,” Ron remarked, disbelieving. “All the important things, his pictures of his parents—it’s gone.”
“While we wait for them to get back to us we should image search his pictures, too,” Draco said from behind his camera. If there were duplicates of those images anywhere in the internet, they would be found with a simple search that Ruth definitely could have done herself.
“Plus, if I screw things up horribly, then at least they’ll have a couple of great godparents to take care of them.” Harry and Draco had argued about that, too. But who the hell else would Draco want? Pansy Parkinson? It may or may not have been another clause in Harry agreeing to go with the fifty look-a-like candidates.
“I don’t want anyone who does this for a living,” Harry frowned.
With one last kiss to Harry’s trembling lips Draco pulled back, sitting back on his heels so he had a perch from which to view the groveling man below him. From this angle he could see all of Harry, and Merlin, did he look incredible.
“Virgins,” Blaise complained to Draco, letting them both share a moment of laughter.
He launched himself on top of Harry, sending the pen and paper tumbling off of the bed while his hands grasped blindly at Harry’s waist. Draco held him down and held him close, dizzy from how passionately Harry had reciprocated the kiss in the first place.
“That’s why you’ve got us,” Draco reminded Ruth. He put down his own camera so he could look the woman in the eye. “Even if this doesn’t turn out like you want it to, and it really might not, you need to know that you’re safe. We’ve got your back.”
Just before she decided to crawl back onto the mattress where her snoring Scotswoman was waiting, she heard a familiar tapping.
“What’s you?” Draco demanded. He wanted to hear the man say it so there wouldn’t be any room for interpretation.
Ruth’s neck flushed pink. “Well, sure. Let me find some… Representative ones,” she laughed breathily as she scrolled through her phone.
In the bathroom mirror Draco wore a frown to see himself so unshaven. He immediately waved his wand to bring the razor and cream out of the drawer and dancing into his hands. He applied the foamy white mixture generously to his face and went in with the multi-blade tool, shaving off the peach fuzz in favor of a cleaner look. “That’s wonderful, Harry,” Draco said and meant it. “You really have come far.”
“Well, we both liked the official Katy Perry fan page and we got to talkin’ on one of her posts.” It was incredible to see Ruth talk about Chris. Even though she’d never so much as breathed the same air as his, she twisted her blonde curls around her finger when she talked, totally smitten. “And I replied because he was cute, and it just kept going from there. He’s been with me through so much, he always is there to talk to.”
That little ramble had clearly cemented Marcus' hatred of Harry Malfoy-Potter. He looked on the edge of snarling something out even though it most certainly wouldn't be the location of the body parts of his murder victim.
“Harry Potter’s fucking balls,” remarked Blaise, still smiling like an idiot.
“When was the last time you’ve even seen a vagina?” Draco laughed. “They are often bloody.” Having a vagina made someone a regular warrior.
“You’re insufferable,” Harry said for the millionth time in his life and looked at Draco instead of the camera in his hand. Fucking Draco.
“And isn’t it a hassle?” he asked smoothly, reminding himself that his own glasses were brought on by old age and Harry’s by his blind father. The week James had lost his glasses was the week that nobody at Hogwarts was safe from being walked into or grabbed for. Sirius had to call out commands to make sure James didn’t fall out of the Quidditch pitch, but it didn’t stop the animagus from yelling out the wrong orders to screw with him at every turn and make him crash into his poor girlfriend.
The Ministry really went all out for the whole ‘we’re not dead’ thing.
Harry shook his head, assuring Draco with another kiss that he wouldn’t alternate between calling his mother-in-law and his child ‘Cissy’. “It sounds pretty, is all. Though a middle name would probably mess it up.”
Colin gave him a little smile. “Yeah,” he said quietly. “But I suppose I have to accept the one parent I do have right now.”
“You love me,” she replied, and knew he couldn’t deny it. “You better fill me in on all the details, okay? I want to hear all about the one, maybe even two you respond to.”
Draco pulled out the beginning of the speech he had prepared while he was looking for her, seeing no other option. “I know this is strange.”
“Draco!”
She didn’t answer him. It was healthy, she supposed, for couples to argue. There was something suspicious about people that were content in their relationships one hundred percent of the time. They were probably hiding something.
Harry smiled. “Oh. Okay, that sounds great.” He hadn’t known Draco had been planning on telling them so soon, but he’d hoped for it, and his hopes were seemingly coming true. He wondered how much of the truth they’d be receiving. Hopefully not too much—Harry would be too embarrassed to face them if they knew everything.
xxxxXXXXxxxx
“Father,” Draco cut in before either one of them started saying things they regretted. “Would you ever call mother ‘unemployed’ when you worked in the Ministry and she maintained the Manor and gardens? No. Harry is a homemaker. He makes the Manor a home.”
Reaching over his head, Draco tugged his shirt off. It was graceless and messy since Harry had him practically pinned to the couch, but every inch of skin revealed more than made up for that.
“I know. It’s okay,” Harry nodded. “Be safe.”
In the end though the Malfoy patriarch was satisfied knowing the pair who had wanted to harm and throw off the career of his only son were now barred from practicing medicine. That wasn’t a legal consequence, but one that came from the Board of Advisors of Saint Mungo’s.
“We could go back to the agency,” Draco sighed exhaustedly. If Grace Burbage was the only solution to Harry’s moral dilemma, then Draco would create another one. “Pull the rest of the files…”
“Maybe I’ll go visit sometime soon,” Harry said and this time it wasn’t an empty promise like the last few times had been. Molly Weasley was an inspirational, badass matriarch who he’d always felt he’d let down by not marrying Ginny, but if she felt that way she sure didn’t act it. Molly was always loving to Harry like a part of the family anyway, and he had to stop being so afraid of seeing her. It wasn’t very Gryffindor-like, even if this wasn’t school anymore.
Teddy nodded. All four little Slytherin faces stared at Draco, all full of hope and innocence.
“That works perfectly,” Draco said, feeling oddly proud that he’d gotten that out of Harry. “And when do my two hours start?”
As confusing as it was, Draco played on.
‘Her Highness’ was code for Zeke’s mother whenever they argued about her. Their arguments used to be simple and sort of stupid. ‘She doesn’t like me’, ‘she insulted my outfit’, ‘she gave me the evil eye all night’….
“Nobody’s ever gotten me flowers before,” Harry admitted, voice thin and still sniffling. “Especially not whole bushes of them. They look so lovely transplanted in the yard, and my own will start growing in soon.”
—to fumble with the door and push it open to push his mother over the edge. That would teach Zeke never to underestimated just how screwed he could be.
“I wanted to see it,” she admitted quietly after waiting to word it perfectly. “The last time I was here I wasn’t entirely of my own volition. It’s magnificent. The color scheme? It’s inspired. The way it plays off of the earth-tone walls—“
Harry’s final assessment in the mirror was that he certainly could be unwrapped and unraveled, but he wasn’t anybody’s present.
As they lay there talking for the next hour, Draco wouldn’t have traded it for the world.
“Maybe,” Harry said in a way that really meant ‘doubtfully’. “But I think I’d be friends with Ron and Hermione no matter what house we were all put in. Maybe we could have been friends, though, instead of rivals. Would you still… want that?” Harry swallowed back his nerves. “You apologized to me a long time ago at the Post-War Trials, and I forgave you then, especially after all your mother did for me. I forgive you still, and I think, for the sake of the students—“
“Who is this boy?” Lucius tried.
“Oh, wah! I’m Grace Burbage and my flow is heavy!”
The kids raised in Provincetown would be a respectful, happy bunch. Harry wondered how much a house would cost in the area if he ever found someone to settle down with.
They’d been to too many ‘abandoned’ houses to trust one to be entirely empty. For all they knew Marcus could have been a fan of keeping swarms of locusts or hordes of mutated rats. Harry wondered if Theo would have given them any information on that, but knew he couldn’t ask.
Hills mutters something. It sounds as if he recognizes the insult but can’t quite identify it.
charm.”
can’t sit still.”
“Good choice, Harry!” To the others, Luna said, “He was job shadowing the brewer today.”
Harry found his bag waiting on one of the armchairs near the stove. He unpacked his things, unshrank them, and placed them into the drawers and onto the empty shelves: shirts and trousers and trainers and toothbrush, as well as one book on visiting Oregon that had been written in 1977, gifted to him by Arthur. He poked through the cabinets in the en-suite and found a vial of Sleeping Draught. He silently blessed his friends for that.
Remembering the words, Harry smiled.
The chaos of movement is a dim backdrop to Harry’s own whirlwind thoughts of Malfoy dressed in a heather cardigan, grey eyes dark with anger, his voice seething. He had the audacity to put on the airs of a
He kissed away the worst of Harry’s pain and fear. Each kiss a benediction on the frustrated attempts with Ginny. The loneliness. His guilt and regret after
It’s a shock to see it now. Harry’s spent a happy decade—longer—without thinking about Malfoy. And he could joyfully go the rest of his life without thinking about him, too.
Harry had fully intended to stand up and let Malfoy take the inside part of the booth, but before he could move, Malfoy said, “Budge over. I’m not going to crawl over you.”
He’s awake in an instant, tumbling to his feet from the drawing room chair.
Harry’s eyes focus. He realizes the book on his lap is upside down and has been the entire time. He clears his throat and lifts his gaze. Malfoy stands a few feet away, arms crossed, raising an eyebrow.
“Especially from you because he really likes you.”
Ginny looked too smug. “That’s what I thought. Luna is under the impression that you love sales. I told her you were interested in learning how to use this handsome little device. The demonstration starts now, unless you want to handle the feet of old men all day.”
Ginny looked between Malfoy and Parkinson and Harry. Luna smiled faintly at Harry. Parkinson glanced at Harry, as well. Malfoy busied himself taking a pull from his beer.
“Clearly, you weren’t,” Malfoy drawls.
“Did you—take my
“Dark artifacts! Oh my. Do you think someone’s planted them in my cottage? Please, come in. Thank you for getting here as soon as you could to respond to the incident.”
All the while, Malfoy licked and sucked.
“What, think I’m going to steal something, Malfoy?” Potter held up his see-through hands.
The haughtiness was gone. That’s what. And he held himself confidently, but not ramrod straight nor slouching.
On the far table, a single cauldron—brass—sat under a shimmering stasis charm. Books and notes spilled over much of the remaining surface. Volumes on muggle science nudged spines with Medieval herbal treatises. His notes were an arcane jumble of runes, alchemical symbols, and mathematical and chemical formulas.
Malfoy and Ginny continued to banter. Meanwhile, Harry sipped his beer and pledged to pace himself with it. He could not allow himself to get as hammered as he had at the previous pub night.
“Harry, two months ago I would have told you it’s impossible. But clearly I haven’t been practicing long enough and still have more to learn. So: I don’t know. It’s not something I’m supposed to admit, but I’d be doing you a disservice if I told you not to try. Your recovery has been nothing short of miraculous. But please understand that you must take care. More powerful spells, more complicated magic, anything that pulls deeply on your core, may trigger your symptoms.
A strong hand gripped Harry’s arm before Harry could fall onto his arse. “Really, Potter,” Malfoy said. He looked flushed and breathless. “A Shield Charm? I thought you left the suicidal tendencies behind.”
All of Potter’s symptoms related to the fact that he was, for all intents and purposes, and despite all of his protests, a ghost. He couldn’t feel or touch, which he illustrated—to Draco’s horror—by waving his hand through the corner of the table. He glanced at Draco. “Malfoy, are you all right?”
it isn’t Hermione’s responsibility to help Malfoy, but Tuesday is fast approaching and there is nothing he can do to help Malfoy himself.
It happened like this: one sweaty day at the end of June, Head Auror Robards called him into the office. Harry had just finished his first cup of coffee and a raspberry Danish pastry, so he was fidgety with caffeine and sugar. His restlessness had nothing to do with the grim look on Robards’s face; it was Robards’s typical expression, although Harry wasn’t used to dealing with it first thing in the morning.
“Harry! Oh, thank goodness. You’re there.”
As he talked, his hand worked over Harry’s arse, moving closer to the cleft. Then he gently pushed apart his cheeks and slowly dragged his tongue over Harry’s hole. Harry whimpered, and Malfoy blew on it. Did it again. Slowly, almost ponderously, his breath hot against Harry’s moist skin.
They sat, Harry taking the inside with Ginny next to him and Luna on the outside. The arrangement felt odd to Harry—as if Malfoy and Parkinson were a couple, and he was the third wheel to Ginny and Luna.
He collected his bag from the baggage bin; a magical timestamp shimmered on its strap, showing its arrival time as an hour ago. On his first holiday via Portkey years ago, Harry hadn’t understood the reason for sending bags through their own Portkey and had insisted on keeping his with him for the trip, only for the bag to spin out of his hands upon arrival, nearly braining the arrival attendant and flinging shrunken clothing all over the terminal. He spent the next ten minutes Summoning tiny pants from potted trees and light fixtures.
Harry wondered if he’d been making bread again, if he had made the croissant Harry had just eaten. He had a confident step, just a hint of a swagger, but that might have been put on for Harry’s benefit.
Draco’s face flushed hotter. He snatched the document back. “You’re useless, Potter.”
“Er…”
Harry refrained from asking the obvious question: why they had chosen to move to damaged land. It didn’t look damaged now. It looked healthy and beautiful. Past the vegetable garden, short golden grass and dandelion puffs carpeted the gentle slope; beyond that, the tops of the trees swayed in the slight breeze.
“Enjoying the farm?”
“Ah,” Malfoy says, his eyebrows rising even higher in an expression that sparks Harry’s anger. He’s already nervous about being here and feels like he’s hanging out on a line.
more accurate.”
“He’s making dinner. Something I can tell him?”
“So it looks like there’s nothing we can do for the land right now,” Luna was saying. “But the good news is, once we transplant it, it should be fine.”
“One more—
In seconds, he’d got three more of his blue markers to disappear. The fairies thrummed around him, but because of the Shield Charm, they weren’t in his face. He pushed on.
Malfoy gave him a look strikingly like Hermione. “There’s more than one book here on the subject, Potter. This”—he circled his finger in the air—“is the section on magical plant illnesses. If you start at that end at the top, I’ll start on this end at the bottom. If you went through Luna’s collection this morning, I hope you’d be able to remember at least some of the books she already has.”
“That sounds lovely, Harry,” Luna said. “You should be happy where you live.”
“Fantastic!” Charlie said. “We’ll make a brewer out of you yet.”
Harry doesn’t hear Malfoy approach, maybe because of the blood rushing in his ears. But seconds later, cool fingers grasp the edges of his hands and pull them away from his face. Gently, though. Tentatively. Harry didn’t know that Malfoy’s touch could be so unsure.
“Hmmm.” Malfoy exhaled against Harry’s neck, and Harry smelled the sweet, fruity aroma of stout. Malfoy’s cheek was close enough to Harry’s that Harry could feel the warmth off of him, but he didn’t actually touch Harry.
“Shit,” Harry hissed as Robards’ patronus, having finished its message, dissipated in a burst. He’d missed most of what it’d said. Leveling a glare at Williams, he said, “Pick him up and don’t drop him again. No matter how tempting it is.” To Chesterfield: “Did you hear all of Robards’ message?”
Harry looked into the little cup. “Here goes nothing.” He took a sip. It was liquid chocolate, bittersweet and almost sour.
Harry sniffed. “Sorry. But I am nervous about— Teddy’s asleep. May I give you yours now?”
“That was a nice interview,” Malfoy says in a tone that says the opposite. Harry’s heart chills. Malfoy places his quill down to pick up the newspaper. He unfolds it. “You made the headlines.”
, but hadn’t evinced any of the same spectacular effects as a potions ingredient. Draco kept it as a decorative feature more than anything. Although, despite its uselessness, it was still decidedly not muggle.
“That’s very nice for you,” Draco said, depositing the box of herbal remedies onto an upholstered bench. He made a face at the curious portrait of the duchess. Her eyes widened, and she went still.
“It’s a questioning, sir. I’ll hardly be arresting him. If he hexes me for asking voluntary questions, I think we’ll have bigger problems. He will, at least.”
The next morning, Harry woke, put on an old t-shirt and tracksuit bottoms, and stood in the sitting room. He regarded the peeling wallpaper, soot-darkened walls, and rainy oil landscapes and did not feel inspired to action. He needed to start
“The coyotes were howling again,” he said, though he didn’t know why.
Harry pocketed his card. He shrugged, casually. “A little extra caffeine can’t hurt.”
Ginny told Parkinson about their latest batch of students and some of the modifications she’d made to the curriculum while Malfoy listened with apparent rapt attention and Harry slouched back in the seat, trying to keep a frown from his face. It would be so easy to nudge his leg against Malfoy’s. He could even take Malfoy’s hand—would just need to sit forward a little—and Apparate them out of there. Malfoy’s bedroom or his own; he knew both. But Malfoy looked so remote and closed off, head turned to face the others, giving Harry his profile.
So he said, “Thanks, but no thanks.”
“Most normal people sleep, Malfoy. I am not going to stare at a ceiling eight hours out of every day.”
Malfoy palmed Harry’s balls and lifted them to lick the tender skin behind them. Down, toward Harry’s arse, using his other hand to push aside Harry’s cheek. Somehow, the
Luna laughed—a clear, delighted sound. She looked bright and cheerful. Ginny looked determined and a tad bloodthirsty, an expression Harry was familiar with from their Quidditch games. Malfoy looked cool, calm, and relaxed.
He shifts impatiently and taps a foot. He can’t bloody well march back to the Ministry after twenty minutes because no one answered the door.
Malfoy led Harry down a wide curving set of stairs to another level, where a couple of goblins sat at the reference desk. That surprised Harry. He’d only ever seen goblins at Gringotts. These looked younger and were dressed in blazers and jumpers.
Grey eyes gleam, and Harry realizes Malfoy is
But Malfoy didn’t sneer. He didn’t plunge into the other small, painful memories waiting behind the fragile dam: those of his life with the Dursleys, the nightmares of Voldemort, the aching nights spent staring into the Mirror of Erised. Instead, he backed away quietly and closed the door on that part of Harry’s mind.
“No, that’s all right,” Malfoy said. “It’s right here.” He picked up a relatively shapeless round black hat. “Classic beret.” He placed it on his head and adjusted it in one of the little mirrors on the shelf. He turned to look at Harry, and Harry’s heart skipped a beat.
“O-kay.” Harry drew it into two words, made it almost a question.
“Hi there, Harry,” Luna said.
Draco didn’t think. He palmed his wand and leaped towards the old man and the plant, a spell on the tip of his tongue—but it died there as his foot caught on an object in his path. He flew to the cobbled path. Metal clattered; a thick, dark, stinking liquid spilled over his trousers and shirt. Circe’s
Draco’s jaw fell open. “What—what on, what do you, what?”
Harry fretted at his eyebrows, wanting to pull the thin hairs there out but fighting the urge so Ron wouldn’t see.
He excused himself to the bathroom once he got up there to avoid awkward social interaction with muggles. It would most likely be some stammering nobody who was utterly disturbed by the fact that wizards had existed among the human race for years without his knowledge.
In all the times Harry Potter had imagined what life would be like after The Wizarding War, of all the fantasies he’d spun about the things he’d get to do after vanquishing the man who’d taken his family from him, he’d never included this much idle boredom.
“We’ll see you,” Draco said noncommittally and took Harry off down a fork in the hallways. When they reached the neon sign for restrooms the music was muffled enough by the closing of a door behind them to allow Draco to speak to Harry at a normal volume. “How are you feeling? You seem overwhelmed. We don’t have to go back in there if you don’t want to.”
“I do,” Harry answered almost petulantly, now purposefully clenching around Draco to hear him groan about it. “I want to be your good boy.” And with his legs hooked around Draco and Draco easing inside of him Harry thought he was getting damn well close to it at least.
“So are you or are you not going to kick some Mogu arse with me?”
Tom Riddle had always disgusted him for obvious reasons, but there was logic to behind why Riddle did what he did. He was born while his mother was under the effects of a love potion. He was a product of rape, and at least a thousand defects had to come from the potion. Sometimes, on better days, Harry felt sorry for him.
Sarah, one of his office mates, says, “Some kind of protest outside.”
He looked…in one piece. Healthy. Whatever had killed him—or hadn’t—had happened recently, and it hadn’t been the result of a wasting disease or messy trauma. He looked to be in good shape, the sleeves of his robes not hiding the hint of muscle in his biceps.
“I make sure to cast a Scourgify after,” Harry deadpanned.
as if Harry is the one in the wrong. The image tugs at the underside of his skin and gut with sharp hooks.
Harry loved the honey lemon ice cream, and he loved the marionberry pie flavor, too, though when Malfoy asked what he thought of them, Harry only shrugged and said, “They’re all right. How’s yours?”
“You’re impossible,” Malfoy says. Then, muttering at the door: “All right. Merlin. Stop shaking the bloody foundations.”
“Of course. I have the Luna and Ginny stamp of approval,” Malfoy said mockingly.
“Um.” Potter looked at his hands. His see-through hands.
She tsks, and writes, and flips through pages. “Even with the information intact, this file is practically useless. I’d hate to see the version you got.” With a heavy sigh, she straightens her back and stretches her shoulders. “I guess it’s good that it’s useless. We can use it as evidence to the Wizengamot that there is no foundation for investigation in the first place.”
Harry lifts the cider bottle. “Enjoying some alone time.”
Weirdly, Malfoy didn’t seem to be enjoying this. He looked nearly as uncomfortable as Harry felt. He was as white as Harry remembered him being that night Williams and Chesterfield brought him in. The feeling of betrayal was still thick, the sick anger at Malfoy, at himself.
“Okay…”
Might as
“I think it suits him,” Ginny said.
Malfoy, an Unspeakable who’d gone undercover to help suss out the potion ring. More departments than just the DMLE were involved; this news itself shocked Harry. The Ministry’s involvement in the investigation went deeper than he’d known.
Malfoy lets out a bark of laughter. “This is mad. Are we—”
The process of hat-making, itself, was actually more interesting than Harry had thought it would be—that is, slightly more interesting than watching a Flobberworm eat lettuce—but Sophie didn’t let Harry try any of the techniques, only moved from demonstrating one to the next. A few times, he paused to assist a customer. In one case, the customer purchased a hat that needed to be refitted.
The narrow aisle widened into a little room with a number of mirrors perched on the shelves and a small upholstered chair that looked like it was for customers.
If Draco wasn’t prepared to contribute to the hallowed science of potion-making, then he didn’t deserve the mastery.
interacting with Potter as an adult. So much easier and more satisfying to one-up Potter.
“You can,” Luna said. “But you should check out other opportunities. I’ll find some for you.”
“All right!” Ginny said. “Lunch, anyone?”
Malfoy’s lips press into a white, thin line. Grey eyes meet green, unblinking. Abruptly, he looks away. “To answer your question, that’s what I’m trying to do. Tell people about this.”
Then it was the two of them again, seemingly alone in the room. Williams had offered to stay, just in case Malfoy tried something, like reversing the legilimency. Let him try, Harry thought. A lot had changed since Hogwarts and since the war. Malfoy would be in for a nasty shock.
Harry stands by with his arms crossed at his chest as the two aurors thoroughly sweep the entrance hall, kitchen, and sitting room: casting detection charms, levitating little ceramics into the air, shifting every cross-stitched still life to look behind them, directing a see-through-me charm at the gramaphone, pausing to sift through the stacks of letters from the Ministry, searching through jars of sugar and flour and tea. Systematically dismantling every corner of Malfoy’s quiet cottage.
Molly and Arthur were happy to have him over for lunch one day soon after, and he enjoyed the food and company, but when they asked what he planned to do next and he said, “Not sure yet,” Molly gave him such a look of pity that it haunted him into his sleep.
Above, strings of lights criss-crossed between the building walls, along with bits of brightly colored cloth. Birds dashed around and bickered in the windowsills above—owls and crows and birds with blue plumage that shrieked.
With the city behind them, the countryside spread out for miles on either side of the road, with mountains in the distance to either side, including one tall peak streaked with white.
“That’s…a lot of brooms.”
attempting to keep Harry in the dark about the true nature of the case, he doesn’t want to let on he knows about Poesy—he instead scratches Draco Malfoy’s name onto a request slip and places it into his office desk’s outbox. Malfoy’s file
Luna said, “It’s all right if you haven’t been on a date in a while. I think it’s kind of sweet, waiting for the right person.”
It’s Malfoy, of course. It’s Malfoy and this fallout from this curse and being cooped up in the DMLE for five months. The perfect ingredients to drive him mad.
Malfoy lets out a breath and flaps his hand in a gesture that could mean,
“Okay?” Harry said, straightening and placing his glasses back on.
Malfoy’s voice was jarringly familiar—and just as jarringly different. He sounded posh—but not.
“Yes. Of course. My entire incriminating history.”
Harry watched from the top corner of his vision. He opened the next book in the pile Malfoy had pushed toward him. He’d already forgotten the terms Malfoy had asked him to search for. He glanced at the page with its dimpled text. ‘Sickle Leaf.’ Right.
“What?”
, Harry thinks. Then he thinks about blood on a bathroom floor. He thinks—
He headed upstairs to retrieve his borrowed broom and squeezed through the coats. He had come to enjoy the feeling of pressing through them to get inside, as if he were entering a separate corner of the world that was all his own. The bright morning sun shone in through the window and filled the space with light.
When they are all served and sipping their tea like good posh fops, Malfoy straightens and says, “So. Granger. What has Potter told you?”
him. He had been there talking to Harry, had discussed other details with him. They’d had a long conversation. And nowhere in there had he mentioned that Harry would need to wake up in the middle of the night.
at Oliver’s arse. It’d been kind of hard not to, considering they’d been on the same Quidditch team. He’d seen Ron’s arse a fair number of times, too. Though, given the context of the current conversation, he wasn’t going to say
The words—pulled out of a deep, electric memory—shiver through his system.
“You’re going to transplant the tree?”
“No bother. We’ll talk about it properly when you get home.”
For lunch, they found a little cannery near the waterfront. Harry ordered chowder and sourdough bread and long sticks of smoked tuna for both of them, and they found a stone picnic table nearby.
“I wanted to tell you, you know,” Hermione continued as if she hadn’t heard him. “That I’m proud of you for taking the restrictions off of your adoption requirements.”
So Ginny opened the door and stepped back into cover of darkness to hide her face while the three entered her domain. Once everyone was inside and the door was sealed she flipped the light switch on.
“The promise stands,” Harry said with a little laugh, he too moving to get more comfortable in Draco’s arms. He rested his forehead against Draco’s. “That… That was incredible. Anything else you have in mind, well, let’s just say you’ve got my vote of confidence.”
“I love it,” Harry gasped. “Oh, I love it…” His eyelashes fluttered as he looked to Draco while their bodies bounced together, the man’s face between his thrown-up calves.
“Parkinson,” Harry sighed. “I haven’t heard that name in forever, either. Are you two still friends?”
“I was never taught what sex was,” Harry laughed sharply because saying that out loud made him feel pathetic. “I mean, they didn’t teach it at Hogwarts and my Aunt and Uncle refused to tell me anything. I had to get tidbits from everyone else and try to put together this picture for myself.” Harry’s hands fidgeted. They wanted to go up to his hair and tug, but he fought the urge. “And I know what it is now, obviously,” he followed up quickly.
“Harry,” Draco said, more pressing issues on the mind than a little police brutality. “Harry—“ Draco threw his arms around him. “Harry, I had no idea that was how deeply you were hurting. I’m so sorry.”
She’d undone her braid in her vanity mirror—well, it wasn’t really her vanity, but there was one in her room—and her hair was a kinky and curly mess. The three sections of the braid had been so tightly knit together that when they were set free it was a regular jungle.
“The more I grow up, the more I realize nobody’s an adult. Nobody has any idea what they’re doing, even the people who look like they’ve got it together. You were a scared, stupid kid, and you let my mother die.”
Draco’s eyes widened and he sat up a little, forcing Harry to do the same. “You can’t mean…?”
Draco had already considered the ‘bad influence’ aspect that his parenting would most likely have. Depending on what one saw as ‘bad’, he guessed. “I am already exposing them to the evils and sins of homosexuality.”
“I think I am,” Draco agreed, prying himself off of the massage table and standing on the bath mat above the swirling pink pool of hot water Harry had prepared for them. Draco dipped one foot in and sighed at how warm it was, the next foot following.
That little blondie gussied up in some designer robes, hands on his hips. ‘
A bell rang as he entered, catching the attention of a man behind a white counter. “Welcome to Station Crossing!” he said enthusiastically. He was a balding man with kindly brown eyes and South London accent.
