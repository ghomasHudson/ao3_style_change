Moody wasn’t talking to him but it still felt like everyone’s eyes were on him. There was a savage part of him that wanted to scream in Moody’s face that not only did he survive he
“Arithmancy? That’s a subject? Draco, we don’t take that. Even if we did, it’s not till, like, what, third year? Besides, how does 'time travel' deal with Arithmancy?”
Draco reached out towards Hermione’s hand. He gave it a firm squeeze. She returned the pressure and maintained it as if trying to ground herself.
“That is no matter! I will teach you more.” She looped her arm through his. “Ah, I didn’t know zat ‘Ogwarts had French speakers! Zat is such a relief!”
Tonks thus began an impromptu crash course of “important” muggle specifics. She took him through multiple “discographies” of various Muggle bands and singers (she even roped him into an impromptu dance party one night as they listened to records), flipping through magazines filled with supposed celebrities with coordinated outfits and imperative gossip about their relationship status, and what was “cool fashion” that involved piercings and overtly black clothing that was too much even for him. Tonks was by far the coolest relative he's ever met.
Draco sighed and moved back towards his friends who were rolling out their new sleeping bags. There was an awkward silence of Terry not talking to either Anthony nor Michael.
Ron bustled in, sloshing around a cup of water. "Here, here." He handed it over to Hermione. "I'll go get Mum."
“That doesn’t make it better!” Narcissa rushed out. “You were my sister. And I let them hate you for trying to be happy. I should’ve at least tried something. You never got to see the family ever again.”
“There you are!” the other blond appeared, leading both Draco and Harry’s friends. Anthony’s smile wanded with he saw Draco’s fast pace was not letting up. “Draco, what happened—“ Anthony started before Draco breezed past. The blond would’ve knocked into Terry if he didn’t move last minute.
The noise turned out to be from a small Sneakoscope spinning madly in Harry’s trunk. A Sneakoscope. Draco ignored that fact the Sneakoscope might’ve been activated by him by his lying.
Lockhart looked around him, seeing no one, and pointed a finger to himself. "Are you referring to me?"
Draco bit at his lip before taking a deep breath. “Last year. There was the Yule Ball. And at the Yule Ball, Harry… Harry told me he liked me.”
Draco cared for Harry, nothing tampered with that fact but knowing Harry’s feelings… It made him off-balanced. He wanted to keep the acknowledging thoughts in the back of his head, being shoved away more and more with each passing day.
it’s also about you no longer trying to deny this part of you you’ve been trying to reject. If you say he’s trying to get over you, then probably nothing will happen when you tell him. But at least you told him.”
Potter slouched in his chair, watching people dance and mingle before him. His moving gaze halted and Terry didn't need to look to know what (or, more accurately,
"Class!" Harry remembered. "We have class! I'll see you later!" Harry hoisted his schoolbag up and raced off, not noticing that the other boy was still sitting on the floor, unmoving.
“Real amazing!” Fred said as he and George heaved him up onto their shoulders. There was another round of cheers.
“Add up all the corresponding letters accordingly like so...” Vector’s chalk demonstrated on the board. “And you should get your result of how that individual feels towards you in the form of a percentage.” Draco frowned at the unimpressive ten percent circled on his parchment. His calculations must’ve been wrong.
could ever dream of. I always thought that I’d keep this to myself, but I can’t hold back any longer! I want… I want...” He turned his head away, blushing brightly.
"Who is the student?" Madam Hooch timidly asked, standing beside Snape. "What's the student's name?"
Draco and Hermione returned to the sitting area of the Weasley’s tent. Draco was frowning and rubbing at his cheek, sending Hermione a peeved glare. Hermione just scoffed and rolled her eyes as she went back to her spot beside Ginny at the far side of the tent.
One night, Draco was correcting Terry's Transfiguration essay when a second year, Cho Chang, tapped on his shoulder. “Yes?"
Draco scrambled to his feet and rushed out of the classroom. His legs and lungs started to ache quickly, but he pushed on until he reached the Quidditch field. He skidded to a stop at the base of the field, taking gulps of air as he looked around. He spotted the champions’ tent and hurried over.
“What?! No, I don’t! Forget I said anything!” Hermione flapped a hand, giggling madly. “I’m just being-- I think I need to go to the library.”
“I’ve been looking for Draco. I need to talk to him about something.” Anthony raised an eyebrow. Harry cleared his throat. “Uh, in private.” Anthony’s eyes widened a fraction, glancing over at Terry and Michael who mirrored Anthony’s reaction. The three had a silent conversation with their eyes that included eyebrow twitches and vague head movements.
“Such a vile woman,” Draco mumbled as his thumb stroked the broken skin. Harry hissed and Draco took his thumb away. “Sorry! I didn’t mean to.”
Draco put his hand up in acknowledgement and made his way to stand alongside Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
“I still can’t believe you actually got on the team…” Michael muttered as Draco sat down for breakfast one Saturday in the first weeks of October, dressed in a Ravenclaw Quidditch uniform.
Moody didn't seem like he believed him for a second. “Ah, yes, of course… Well, get going. Before I take house points away.”
"There's no news that he's going to Hogwarts," Michael added. “If you ask me, I think the talk about Sirius Black is overrated.” Michael crossed his legs.
"You came here to save your friend with no plan?" Black raised a brow. "You truly are like your father, Harry."
"Tom was--Riddle was--I trusted him so easily, Harry." Draco's voice was small, struggling to stay levelled. "I didn't know what I was doing--I just wanted someone to talk to--I never imagined that this would happen."
“What?” The compartment’s occupants were staring and Draco kept his head down. His least favourite habit of spacing out seem to be coming back with more vengeance. “I, I don’t get why you’d be after Black either. It doesn’t make sense.”A loud whirring noise came above their heads, startingly everyone expect for Professor Lupin who was still sleeping soundly. “What’s that noise?” Draco asked.
. Potter was tip-toeing to look at Draco. Instead of feeling annoyance as he thought he would, Draco instead felt sort of touched that Potter was checking to see if he was okay.
Draco twitched in his seat as he waited for Defense Against the Dark Arts to start, ignoring the concerned glimpses from Harry sitting beside him.
"It has happened," McGonagall's voice was clipped. "A student has been taken in the Chamber itself." Professors started whispering worriedly. Harry could see Professor Snape was steadily silent.
He sifted through each envelope: Terry bored out of his mind at home, Anthony asking Draco’s opinion on prefects, and--from what Draco could make out from all the hasty scribbles--Michael screaming about how he got tickets to the Quidditch World Cup. The letters shifted to more recently after finding out that Harry, Ron, and Hermione also managed to get tickets to the Cup. There was a letter from an embarrassed Hermione asking what
"Sitting with us?" Micheal raised an eyebrow, seeing Draco push himself into the compartment as well. "That's new." The four boys in the compartment shuffled around, struggling as they pushed trunks above them, all collapsing in a seat when it was finished. "What's up?" Micheal finally asked.
Mrs. Weasley brought he promised tea and let Ron and Hermione look over him as she tended to the other Weasleys up in their rooms. Draco was trying to tell Ron that he didn’t have a fever and so he
"I'm serious, I was blown away. Especially today! Like Malfoy. I never realized that he knew to do non-verbal spells. Do you think he'll be able to teach that to us?"
Narcissa pressed a kiss on Draco’s forehead. “Let’s get you home.” She turned to the redhaired woman hovering by the entrance. "Thank you, Molly,” She said, getting up from the floor and going over to Mrs. Weasely to clasp her hands. “I truly can't thank you enough.”
"I'm going to see what section he was in," said Weasley. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms, slamming them onto the table. "Dragons! Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!" Golden letters glittered on various volumes on the depicting the word.
The next week, all that was talked about was the attack, and Draco did everything in his power to ignore all of it until… he forgot why he was ignoring it in the first place.
.” He quickly stuffed his Snitch into his pocket. “That’d be weird.” He took in Draco’s outfit. “Why aren’t you more dressed up?”
Draco smiled over at Harry. "I'm very glad we are friends, Harry. More than I ever thought I would be."
Harry stopped thinking about Saturday's Quidditch match that was tomorrow and whirled around to face Ron.
Draco pulled out his wand, pointing it to Moody. "Don't pretend that you know anything about me! Or that you're a professor! I know something isn’t right. And..." His hand was shaking. "And I want it to stop. I want to stop it. I will stop it!”
He opened the shuttered window and Errol turned towards the exit. Errol spread his wings and flapped towards the opening, missing by a hair and smacking into the stone wall. Draco made an abortive step towards Errol who got up on his own, rearranging his ruffled feathers and shaking his head. At his second attempt, he managed to get out of the owlery and soared through the cloudy sky, flying over the sprawling land of the Malfoy estate and disappearing into a flurry of snow.
Draco felt a humiliating flush on his ears as he could feel gazes wash over him. A flash memory of seeing his father showing his mother his Dark Mark before they left the Quidditch World Cup. It still looked brand new. Strange. For an odd moment, Draco had forgotten that he came from a family of Death Eaters.
“Dear Merlin! How rude of us! They talked about him as well, Hagrid,” Granger said. “About being a Slytherin traitor, gosh, Draco, I’m sorry.”
"Move along now," McGonagall's sharp voice stopped anymore talking to the ghosts. "Time for The Sorting."
The Hogwarts population's speechlessness transformed into amazed gasps and awes as Durmstrang students in fur-lined red capes marched in with spinning poles and creatures of flames circled the hall. There was an extra surprise when Viktor Krum entered with Durmstrang’s headmaster, Igor Karkaroff.
"You're not really Slytherin material anymore." How was he not Slytherin material anymore? What did that even mean?
Snape’s jaw swelled and Draco could hear his teeth clicking together. "Get some rest, Draco." He only said and left.
“Exactly. The cousin I know would never call himself stupid.” Tonks gave him a once-over. “Even now looking at you I feel something is off. Alright, where’s that classroom again? It’s been ages since I was at school.” She turned away to start walking.
Terry backed away and slipped back into the Great Hall. He looked up the staircase to catch sight of his friend but he found none.
They were on their way to London, the Hogwarts Express speeding through tall hills and deep valleys.
Fletcher Nil walked away from an unimpressed Ravenclaw girl and approached them, fidgeting and smiling nervously. “Pansy! Do you think I can speak with—“
“I want to, Lucius. I truly do, but… I’m worried. Things aren’t going to be the same anymore. How are you going to do it?”
Draco launched himself towards the goal. The Snitch zipped off to evade, rousing the crowd when they noticed Draco’s demeanour changed. Fletcher’s head snapped to him and rushed after him.
“Your father got held up by the Minister and the lot. He says he would rather not let you be bored. He’s going to pick you up from our tent,” Mr. Weasley explained but it sounded like he was trying to explain it to himself. “Does that sound alright?”
Even Draco who was specialized in the bizarre occurrences that happened around Harry Potter didn’t understand what was happening.
Maybe he didn’t need to be friends with Potter, maybe he didn’t need to help Potter, maybe he didn’t need to be here at all.
Mr. Weasely came down the stairs, alerting the group. “Draco, my boy." He clapped the blond's shoulder. "Why don’t you come back to the tent with us?”
about our son!” Lucius whirled around towards Narcissa. “I’m doing this so that our son he doesn’t get
.) He was still confident enough. So he shouldn’t feel his stomach coil with nerves of possible awkwardness.
“Take me to the Yule Ball,” Fleur said as they were saying goodbye at the foot of the Ravenclaw Tower staircase after spending the afternoon going over French vocabulary.
When the summer was drawing to a close, Tonks and Draco were in the living room watching a 'sitcom' as Draco was composing a reply to Harry's latest letter.
"Harry, it was Tom, I--I tried to tell you at breakfast, but I couldn't--it's the diary--I'm such an
Draco trailed behind Harry as they climbed higher and feeling like he was heading to the gallows. When they stepped onto the first landing a pair of moth-eaten curtains drew back and a portrait of a woman started screaming.
“Are you sure?” Trelawney repeated. Harry didn’t move from his position of laying his head down but shot a reproachful look at Trelawney all the same.
The people in the compartment looked at him strangely. Draco looked down at the floorboard to avoid questions. The compartment gave him dubious looks but they let it slide and moved on to different topics.
The walls were blank, a lone bed with a basic bed frame, a writing desk, a scuffed bookshelf. Void of any feeling.
"Is ickle Ronnie not proud to be an ickle prefect?" George simpered. "Like really, did anyone see that coming? Like, did you see it coming, Draco?"
“Now," Dumbledore brought the focus back. "Let’s give the same spirited greeting for the students of Durmstrang Institute!”
"Dumbledore's trying to gather allies, but the Ministry is making a big muck of it with Fudge getting all paranoid. The Order's been thinking about taking the--Er, I guess I shouldn't be saying that to you.")
Draco’s mind was working at half-capacity. He fumbled in his movements as if he completely forgot how to play Quidditch. Thinking of nothing else to do, he circled the pitch, waiting for a sighting of a speck of gold.
Oliver yelped as Draco whipped through, trailing after the Snitch. Harry hurriedly followed up, brushing alongside Draco.
He glanced around the course as if taking in the scenery. The sun flattered his handsome face and made him look radiant. He glanced around one last time before noticing Draco. The hair on the back of Draco's neck stood.
“No, no, it’s quite alright,” She gave Mrs. Weasley's hands a definitive squeeze. “Thank you for everything. You’re a good friend. Let’s go home, Draco." She helped him to stand. "Put your arm through mine. We’ll Apparate.”
Hagrid was covered in snow, his giant moleskin coat giving him a misshapen outline. A dead rooster was in his gloved hands.
Carefully, Draco avoided the three the next day. Walking faster when Weasley was looking at them, giving glares at Harry, ducking his head into his Potions book when he saw Granger's bushy hair.
Yet, can he really say no to a Beauxbatons girl in the first place? And not just any Beauxbatons girl but
“Merlin, look at the size of that woman, Draco--Whoa!” Terry swore, seeing the blond's face. “What happened to you?”
. All he did would laugh at others and spend a lot of time alone in the cold dungeons. Glancing at Slytherin table, he saw Crabbe and Goyle stuffing their faces.
Draco felt hot and pulled off the blanket. He could smell smoke on his clothes, phantom heat prickling his skin.
“He’s survived this long.” Draco reminded, getting under his comforter. “Merlin knows how though,” Draco whispered under his breath as he closed his eyes.
“What was it? What did you see? Was it something important?” Trelawney asked, her bug-like eyes freighting Draco more.
“Whatever, I just can’t wait to see Viktor Krum!" Michael gushed at the name. "That’s mostly who I’m here to see! Merlin, to see in real life! In action! Viktor Krum!”
All day, classes were being stopped by one of the burly dwarfs barging in and passing out love messages to everyone. Draco was ready to gag if he had to hear another say-out-loud poem beginning with ‘roses are red and violets are blue’.
He must've said something wrong because Terry gathered the newspaper and slapped the top of Draco’s head.
about this. You never could. You need to stop pretending that you do.” There was a bite in Harry’s voice that made Draco suddenly feel like the dark-haired boy was glaring at Malfoy. As if he was seeing the proud Slytherin, Draco Malfoy.
Draco pushed down the surge of panic, his back straighten as a response. "Just--trying something different. I guess I've been hanging around Micheal's dry humour for too long. Or I'm just changing... as a person."
“Nothing’s wrong!" Harry halted, holding a hand in front of him to stop Draco. "I just, I think I have a headache. I need to lie down. I’ll see you later.”
Draco’s legs were strained with exhaustion as he climbed into the stuffy room that overwhelmed his nose with a heavy scent of incense and made him lightheaded. Draco rubbed the sleep out of his eyes as he collapsed in a plush armchair around an empty table and laid down his head in his arms. His entire body sagged with fatigue. (He was the only Ravenclaw in an entire classroom of Gryffindors in order for his schedule to work, ugh.)
"Nonsense, even the greats have to learn. So I might put you in... RAVENCLAW!" Draco felt his face go slack. The Great Hall applauded, mostly from the Ravenclaw table, but the older students were more hesitant, whispering about a
Buckbeak’s pupils shrunk as he reared up, his talons sharpened and screeched loudly. He stood tall on his back legs before raising his claw and swung down.
“I’ll be fine, Professor.” Draco strained a smile. “Thank you for the offer.” He gave an awkward nod and turned to leave the classroom.
Draco switched his gaze to Anthony's arms and to his concerned face. Draco sniffed and swallowed the lump in his throat. He didn’t have to think too long; he nodded.
“What in Merlin’s name do you think you’re doing?” Draco hiked his bag on his shoulder in annoyance. “Following me and my friends around?”
Thank you for the lovely comments in the last chapter!! And to comments from new readers: thank you for reading and coming along for the ride :)
That weekend, Draco was standing across Harry on the Quidditch field, glaring at Harry’s shiny, new Firebolt. For once since they came back, he was looking at Draco. He felt some satisfaction that he saw Harry gulp.
--" Draco's head turned immediately towards the familiar voice. Harry was pushing against a smiling Ron.
"Harry Potter." Grey eyes glanced up and he saw Potter looking at him head-on. Potter blushed pink and ducked down, turning to Weasley to start a conversation.
"It's nothing. Don't ask." Draco said flatly and he sat far from the rest of the boys, still taking deep breaths.
“They’re not powers,” Draco said. “And…” His mind was blank on who actually won. It was too long ago and unimportant in the grand scheme of things. “I’m not going to tell you.”
"Oh…” Draco croaked. He sat there in silence, debating if he can just leave or did Dumbledore have to give him permission.
“Wait, wait!” Terry hesitated, smacking one of Michael’s vital chess pieces off the board before rushing over. The boy wrapped his arms around Anthony and Michael to put Draco in the centre of a group hug.
“I’m a Malfoy. Family image is everything. As long as it’s salvageable then I can probably fix it up.”
“The Master has told Krecher to wake Harry Potter up for breakfast. It is the day of the Quidditch World Cup. Harry Potter’s blood trait
Draco was finishing up analyzing a Divination classmate’s handwriting for Divination when he felt two presences behind him.
The two hesitated, both taking a twitching step forward as if they were going in for a hug before doubling back.
“Here’s the remote.” Edward placed the device in Draco’s lax grasp. “Stay here and I’ll make you a cuppa.”
Draco smiled when the owl tried to affectionately nip at his finger. “It’s nice of you to want to go with your friends, but you need to have an actual date, Harry.” He turned back to the other boy. “That’s why I’m Fleur’s date.”
Crookshanks leapt off of Hermione’s lap. He brushed his body against Draco’s legs before situating himself at his feet.
“Now that we are all here,” Dumbledore said as Draco and Cho settled into their seats. “Mrs. Krum, I would personally like to thank you for coming from Bulgaria for your cooperation.”
Draco read the letter as he descended down the owlery tower and was heading back to Ravenclaw Tower.
"It's not--" Draco stopped suddenly as if the idea just struck him, his eyes widened. "Maybe I could've." the foil of the chocolate bar crinkled in his lap. "Sorry, I guess I forgot." he huffed a sad laugh. "I never really had such an option like that before. Never had someone like you before." Harry's eyes widened themselves as he looked at Draco, but the other boy was still looking into a random spot in the infirmary. "I feel so stupid."
“I’ve been reading about European wizarding institutions since the World Cup. It’s in the footnotes of
Draco scoffed and slammed his book shut. He tossed the book onto the living room’s coffee table. He still hasn't figured out what to do with the Harry situation.
“No, thanks. Can I just…” Draco shifted his weight from foot to foot. “I heard there was a Black family tapestry.”
“Uh,” Draco said. “Alright, then.” He turned back to the other boy who was staring at the retreating backs of their friends. “So… How’s your summer?”
Clippings from long-forgotten newspapers that had the name Black somewhere in the heading, letters in French with scrawling handwriting that Draco found impossible to decipher. He knew his mother’s family were proud people and he could see why. They were high-class, one of the most pureblooded families to every come within the wizarding world. Every page saw them be saturated in the Dark Arts and blood prejudice, yet many still adored them.
“Mrs. Weasley apologizes if Errol makes a fool out of himself,” Narcissa added as a disclaimer. "She also apologizes if the jumper's too long."
diary." Riddle placed a hand on his chest as if he was modest, but there was nothing but smug pride twisting his face. "Draco has been writing in it for months on end. The things he told me... I tell you, he surprised me. He's much more interesting then he's made out to be." Riddle spread his arms out. "The stories he'd tell! The secrets, the
“Young Master Draco? Dobby brought you some tea—EEP!“ Draco grabbed the teacup and hurled it at the wall. Porcelain shattered and a trail of tea dribbled down the wallpaper. A crashing sound of Dobby’s tea tray falling to the floor as the house-elf disappeared from his room out of fear.
Draco waited for Harry to fill up the bucket (he was waved off to provide any help) and they slowly made their way through the crowds of tents and people towards the Weasleys' tent.
“Don’t start accusing me,” Draco intoned, his thoughts jumbled together causing his feelings to fluctuate. “I do see things--”
. “Until then, let’s just make this potion.” She looked back down to Draco. “Thanks for doing this with us.”
"Good, I think Dad's about to start dinner," Tonks pushed herself out of her seat. "And I think I've wounded Sirius' pride enough. We'll see you tomorrow!"
"You're brilliant!" Harry gathered Draco into a hug. He could smell the sweat and the grass from Harry's Quidditch robes. "Absolutely brilliant!"
Draco shrugged and watched as Harry had many failed attempts at reaching the golden egg before his Firebolt came from the sky and save him from another line of fire. The dragon's chain broke like paper and Harry and the creature took off towards the school as it snapped at Harry’s Firebolt.
Lockhart's office was half-packed when Harry and Ron were let inside. Portraits were running around, panic in all of their faces as Lockhart was stuffing pastel-colored robes in his trunk.
“We found you out cold in the forest. You were hiding out in a hollow of a tree. Dad brought you home right away. Are you okay?” Ron said.
“Thank you,” Draco managed the pleasantry. His hand was steady when he picked up the teacup’s fragile handle. The soothing tea warmed his stomach.
"It doesn't matter," Harry cut in. "I'm asking that we forget about it. I don’t want things to be weird between us. I need you now more than ever. I can… deal. It’ll go away eventually. I promise. So… we can be just friends. Like we’ve always been. Just friends who look out for each other. Nothing more. So…” Harry held out his hand again. “Friends?”
“Who said they 'found' her? As the professors left us, they were suspecting Potter's group of doing that to the cat,” Anthony said, falling into his bed across from Draco.
"'Course I made it!" Tonks said and wrapped an arm around Draco. "Brought someone with me! Hope you don't mind that I brought him along."
!” Michael bellowed out, launching onto Draco’s back and causing all four of them to crash to the ground.
"You're right, sorry!" Draco jumped out is his seat like he was burned and fled, not even going to the Ravenclaw table, leaving the Great Hall altogether.
“He can’t do that! That’s an invasion of privacy!” Anthony muttered, but Draco really wasn’t listening because he was still looking at the Gryffindor table and noticed Harry was one of the ones that tensed, his fork dropped in mid-air.
"Hey, you can't just talk about his family like—" Potter began, but Draco cut him off, as he didn't need famous Harry Potter defending him.
"Draco!" The woman's voice seemed to shake. "Love," she stepped away from the hug and knelt in front of Draco, her glossy nails moving all over Draco's dirty face. "are you hurt?"
"What you mean by that?" Draco picked a scone off the trembling platter, waiting for him to crack under pressure.
Sirius was at his side instantly. “Remus, did you take your potion?” He grabbed Lupin’s shaking shoulders. “Remus! Remus, listen to me, you can control it!” Lupin was heaving, curling in on himself. “You can fight this! I know you can!
His mind was muted, a steady stream of simple things. As if his head was underwater and the heavy weight of being a human was upon the surface. As long as Draco kept his head under, then this peace would remain.
"You said you had to tell me something. What was it? I don’t think I got it.“ Harry stared hard at his hands in his lap.
That didn’t sound right in the blond’s head, but there was only so many miscellaneous events that he could remember clearly.
that they only did You-Know-Who’s bidding because they were under the Imperius Curse. For this curse, forces you to act against your will. Total control. You are no longer your own person." Moody took out an enlarged spider and set it on the table. "
“Harry!” Hermione suddenly shouted and went down to the floor, inspecting an unconscious Harry but Draco was still trying to collect himself. His chest was minutely coming loose, waves of chills still shuddering through his body.
“Oh, don’t say that. The night is still young!" No, it wasn't but Potter didn't need to know. "Seize the moment, Potter!” Terry said ruefully. “It's not too late to do what you want to do. Don’t let this night go to waste. I mean, what do you have to lose?"
"I guess you should come as well, Mr. Weasley..." McGonagall said. "I'm sorry to show you this, but there was another attack, a
"Funny, I don't believe you." Draco went towards him again, but Harry backed up until he was standing on the first step down, his other leg still on the floor above.
"Draco, I'm not saying you're wrong, really, but what about him trying to steal Dumbledore and Flamel's top secret thing?" Draco wanted to run a hand over his face as he took a deep breath.
“Fine, but we're still going to find a way around this," Ron promised, digging out a homemade sandwich out of his pocket and unwrapping it.
It didn’t even matter if was a Ravenclaw, Slytherin, things kept happening around him without his doing. He was useless and unnecessarily taking up space… “Draco—help me with Ron.” Numbly, he let Weasley wrap his arm around Draco’s neck. He didn’t care about the overbearing weight that was on his shoulder as Harry pulled them off the field. He was taking them further down the grounds—to the gamekeeper’s house—but he couldn’t shake the question out of his racing thoughts:
Draco climbed up the Minister's Top Box and saw Lucius turned around in his seat, talking to a tiny house-elf who was covering her eyes.
“It’s just that… besides Slytherin, no one really likes him…” Harry said slowly. Draco shrugged his shoulder in understanding. “Like... your father, Snape… these people aren’t very likeable but you’re nothing like them.”
“Really?! I must go.” Fleur patted Draco’s shoulder. “I’ll see you later, Draco.” The girl ran off in a flutter of pale blue and golden blonde hair.
"Harry," Ron said cautiously, "do you like, er, that is, do you like--Do you think Draco's still, you know...?" Harry didn't know what to say. "D'you know what?" Ron rose from his seat. "Let's go to Lockhart. Tell him what we know. He's going into the Chamber, right? Maybe we can tell him about the basilisk. And if there's a chance that Draco is still, you know, then maybe he can save him!'
“My name's Professor Moody. Ex-Auror. If you want to hear stories of my times as an Auror,” The class perked up. “You can forget about it. Such stories are not meant for a classroom. The Dark Arts are something that cannot be joked about. And considering that Hogwarts has been able to house such dangerous figures tells me that all of you need to learn to see through disguises. For anyone can hide… they don’t even always need a mask.” Moody's shock-blue glass eye signalled out Draco.
Tom knew everything about him, about what’s to come, but after his talk to Dumbledore, Draco knew that if he ever lost this diary… everything would be ruined. This dairy was becoming dangerous. It was just a giant accident waiting to happen.
Draco bitterly thought. Still, she continued. "Change takes time and it takes work. And not everyone is going to see it right away. But one of the hardest things of changing yourself is making sure that you yourself are aware that you are making that change. And it's not for others, love. It shouldn't matter about other people’s opinions. You don't need people's approval to be kind or helpful. It’s for yourself. For yourself to know that you’re doing you’re best and that you’ve grown. And you've grown
"Malfoy, Draco." Taking a deep breath, Draco left Potter and Weasley as he went to sit on the stool. The Sorting Hat touched his head and...
"We've been trying to figure it out, if it had invisible ink or some sort of charm on it, but even Hermione is having trouble breaking it."
He went down to his table to take a seat next to Anthony, who was trying to get a streamer off of his pancakes with his fork.
Draco rolled his eyes as the two laughed. The knot in his stomach loosened. He looked around them, noticing a missing person. “Where did Michael go?”
Draco felt the back of his neck and his ears an ugly shade of red. Did he really forget that Sirius Black was still on the loose? Merlin, how did they not run into the Dementors?
Draco stuttered in his steps, faltering at the base of Ravenclaw Tower. The weight that settled on Draco’s shoulders was surprising.
It was one particular day of the two owls flapping their wings and their feathered puffing up spectacularly that made Aunt Andromeda stop and ask Draco, “is it about your parents?”
Draco turned on his side and closed his eyes to force sleep. There was a sudden sense that he was being watched. Draco opened his eyes and Harry hurriedly turned away from him to face the other direction. The blonde went to lay on his back, staring at the Great Hall’s starry night sky.
”But he said that the Chamber of Secrets has opened before… or he didn’t tell me that.” Eyes shifted from person to person, absorbing the new information.
“I’m fine,” Draco said shortly. He took one glance at Harry’s face before adding, “thank you for asking.” Harry opened his mouth to speak again but another voice interrupted.
Draco’s body felt like it was on fire, shivering as Harry’s hands tentatively caressed his waist. His fingers found themselves at the nape of Harry’s neck. He made a surprise sound at the touch of Harry’s tongue pressing forward and
He pushed himself out of bed, extinguishing his wand and stuffing it in his back pocket. The other four-poster beds in the dorm had their curtains drawn close expect for Anthony's who seemed to forget. Mindful of Anthony's light sleeper habits, he carefully walked passed the boy's bed. Anthony shifted and Draco froze. He only murmured and turned over in his sleep. Letting out a relieved breath, Draco slipped out of the dormitory.
“I know that it’s not an enjoyable memory to remember,” Lupin settled against his desk. “But I do recall how you reacted to the Dementors on the Hogwarts Express. It affected you a great deal.”
“How? I can’t possibly get a new broom while I’m at school and there’s no way I can pay for a new one. Wood's been wanting to win the cup all year. I can't lose against Nil of all people.” Harry started rambling, a frantic edge to his voice.
The next day he saw Weasley sitting next to Granger, but still didn't see Harry. Having not seen Quirrell in two days threw him of any confidence that the rumors were rumors which we steadily spreading.
. A shiver traveled all over his body. Draco stared down at his hand, his mind thinking of everything it could be but blood.
“Now, when you awaken, you’ll be in the water, so make sure you keep your head up as you reach the shore.” Dumbledore stood and walked over to Gabrielle's side. He pulled out his wand. “Do you accept, Miss Delacour?”
Draco couldn’t argue on that’s what it looked like. It was far from the truth, but if the idea worked…
Anything that Draco was thinking of disappeared. He closed his eyes and raised his hands to gather his three friends closer.
Harry dived, faking a sighting of the Snitch and Draco followed him easily. When Harry pulled up and Draco was beside him a moment after. (He trained endlessly to keep up with Harry’s sharp dives.) Harry blinked at Draco’s quickness which made the blond smirk before slipping away.
“Oh… good for them. Yeah, you might as well sit with us.” Terry looked over at Draco. “If that’s alright.”
“Bugger off, Nil. I’m not asking again.” Harry said forcefully and pushed passed the surprised Slytherin boy, Draco following closely behind him.
Hagrid went to change the subject. “Uh, Thanks fer workin’ on the case with me. Both of ye. Merlin knows I’d wouldn’ know what to do.”
“I better see Nil’s arse get destroyed by Potter to be in this rain!” Michael shouted over the freezing breeze and loud hiss of rain. Draco’s clothes were already drenched and clinging to his frozen skin.
“I just... feel drawn to him, if that makes sense.” Harry made an odd face and Draco continued. “I mean, he has problems he doesn’t know how to deal with it, but I do. I feel the need to talk to him.”
Draco only smirked before tucking into dinner. Low noises of chatter and sounds of slurping filled the kitchen. Draco savoured Mrs Weasley's excellent cooking. Yet he felt himself constantly glancing over at Harry who was smiling brightly while talking with Sirius.
!" Harry ran down the chamber to go to Draco's side and dropped to his knees. "Draco, don't be dead, please--" Harry's voice was wavering. He grabbed his shoulders to pull him over. Draco was marble-white, his face showing no life or movement, but his eyes were closed so that had to mean... "Wake up Draco, you have to wake up!"
Perhaps leaning too deeply into the hero-worship of Viktor Krum… And how he always wanted to add “handsome” when thinking about Cedric Diggory…
Draco's brow furrowed at that, trying to figure out where on his half-formed timeline of Aunt Andromeda was that event placed.
“Hermione's mad at me because she thinks I keep trying to lure that cat away,” Ron said when he caught up with Draco heading to Ravenclaw Tower to get ready for Hogsmeade. “But it isn't me! It disappears for hours but then always comes back, unfortunately. Scabbers is alright though, right?" It was a religious question that Ron has been asking Draco. He would ask it when they passed one another in the hallways, during meals, and while they did homework together in the Study Hall.
“Yes!” Draco said just as loudly. The Death Eaters didn’t tell him anything but he knew that Black wasn’t one of them. It was an exact misunderstanding!
"No, I saw the Headmistress of Beauxbatons with Hagrid," Harry defended him. "She probably told her. And Krum probably knows as well. And Cedric now that I've told him."
"Yeah—of course. But, I need to tell you something as well." Harry was looking at the forest floor. “Something very important. It took me longer than it should have to figure out, but I wanted to be sure.“
“When were we going to hear about this?!” Terry shrieked, rushing over and clinging to one of his bedposts. “What happened?!”
Draco fell face-first into his bed, almost wanting to scream into his pillow. A knock on his door made Draco stop before he could.
The blond hesitated. “Harry, you know that you’re so strong, and brave, and funny, and charming, and
"Mr. Malfoy." A voice called out. Draco didn't have any more patience by the third day and still no sign of Harry so he was going to the Hospital Wing early in the morning.
"Harry, please, this is embarrassing enough. I care... a lot about you. And I don't know what I'd do if you said you didn't want to be friends anymore." He would add on how he wanted to protect them from the dark times to come, but knew he couldn’t. Harry was still a kid, he wasn't ready.
"Two?" Draco saw Luna get polite clapping as she went to sit at the Ravenclaw table, far from where he was sitting.
Hogsmeade day with Potter?” Michael brought the topic back up he piled another pumpkin pie slice onto his plate. (His Snitch was safely in his own robe pocket.)
"Please, Harry, my boy, none of my books would sell if I said some old warlock save his village from werewolves, the man didn't have the face for stardom. I had to stretch the truth a bit."
to love him, he was connected to them in some way. If Snape wasn't his godfather than he wouldn't help Draco with anything, Draco himself would do the same. Crabbe and Goyle, they were walls he used to push away others. Pansy was just a lovesick girl and Draco took advantaged of that.
He thought as he pushed himself further in the shadows cast by an armor that was beside the Great Hall.
Draco promptly replied that there wasn’t a problem in the first place and sent Tonks’ owl on its merry way.
"Dobby is very sorry for disturbing you. For that, Dobby threw himself down some stairs before coming here." the servant was twisting his hands into his pillowcase uniform. Darting his eyes back and forth, shifting from foot to foot.
“Draco, don’t fight Madam Pomfrey on this,” Hagrid said calmly, laying a large hand on his shoulder. “Yer already had too many close calls. Yer father deserves to know.”
One of the things Draco has noticed in these continuous study sessions is that Harry didn’t like to listen. Often when Draco would be speaking, the boy retained nothing. The boy would look at Draco, but only just. Harry always zoned out with his gaze on the blond. What the boy could always be thinking about Draco had no idea.
"Something's amidst here at Hogwarts. Dumbledore sent for me to make sure you all are prepared. This Triwizard Tournament can be dangerous and not just for the champions. So. Keep Potter safe, Mister Malfoy."
Moody was attacking Tonks. Tonks was his protegee, he would never hurt her. He shouldn't be using the spells he was to attack her--just like how he shouldn't have--used--used--The Imperius Curse.
"Anything for you, mate." Terry jumped onto his bed, taking a candy out of his pile. He quickly unwrapped it and popped it into his mouth.
Draco cleared his throat (and refrained from clearing it again). “Hi.” He already hated this conversation.
“We’ll explain more later. That is, if you’re in?” Granger said. Draco looked down at the potion list.
“Huh? Right… Yeah.” Draco wrapped a hand around his left wrist, reminding himself he wasn’t a traitor.
"I'm fine I'm just--" Harry's eyes roamed the pub and settled on the entrance. Harry's eyes widen in surprise. Draco turned to see what it was.
friends. Maybe we can hang out, just, the two of us... as friends..." Somehow, the way Harry spoke that word--
"I wish, the only one who's not breaking a sweat is Draco over here." Michael nodded over to him, seeming to materialize next to the blonde.
him. It made him feel sick. Shame from all the immature threats and fights he had made his stomach heave.
Andromeda and Narcissa were standing at opposite ends of the kitchen island. Edward was sitting in a breakfast nook, a half-assembled tea tray in front of him.
"Quite, correct, Miss--? Granger? Quite right, Miss Granger. The Ministry thinks that students wouldn't be able to handle the exposure to such spells. Well,
? Draco, what’s all this?” Anthony was looking at the top books of Draco’s giant pile on the breakfast table as Terry moved his bag off of the bench so he could sit there.
Feeling Harry's hand go around his wrist, Draco pulled both of them, running past small, forest-floor creatures, tripping over tree knots out of fear until they heard someone shout. "Harry! Draco! Are you alright? Neither of you looks well."
"I needed to clear my head from a few things. I was a little tense that day and you just tipped me over the edge." Harry bowed his head and Draco grabbed his shoulders to make him look up. "But it's fine now, I promise." Harry nodded.
Harry was unashamedly brandishing the egg with triumph, a self-satisfied grin on his face as the Gryffindor Common Room praised him. He was boasting his soot markings with pride.
Potter bumped into Draco multiple times as they went into the Great Hall. They entered from the oak doors to the bright Great Hall, loud with students' conversations and lit by hundreds and hundreds of candles floating above their heads.
“This!” He gestured to the newspaper that showed Harry and Hermione embracing on the front page. “I know that Potter and Granger aren’t like that! Aren’t you just a
Harry skimmed Draco’s face. “I can think of a few people.” He ducked his head briefly then looked back up. “You know, I think I’m just going to go back up to my dorm. I’ll see you later.” He passed Draco quickly, seeming unaware that his face was becoming an unflattering blotchy red.
"Thank you," Lucius' tone was formal, his gaze went to Ron who visibly tried to shrink himself. "Thank you, to you both." Lucius held out a hand towards Harry. He tried not to flinch as his hand touched a cold ring on the blond man's finger. No sooner had he dropped the hand before it was pointed at Ron, who's eyes widened like they did when he saw the trail of spiders. Ron grabbed the hand and kept it there, not moving it. Lucius took it upon himself to shake Ron's hand. "I suppose... I was wrong about you Weasleys." The awkwardly long handshake was over and Lucius turned back to Dumbledore.
“Who is it? Come on, tell us!” Terry landed himself beside Michael in his bed. “I want to know who somehow actually liked your mullet.”
Harry opened his eyes to his scrunched lips centimetres away from the face of Kreacher, Sirius’ house-elf. Definitely
Harry was going to tell Draco that it was his letter. He really was. Only, maybe after his spellbooks had dried, and the broken glass was picked out from the sides of his schoolbag. But Draco liked his letter. He actually
After a minute or two of yelling, the rattling stopped. Draco couldn’t hear momentarily, but then slowly could hear people laughing as talk started up once more. “Man, that Gryffindor got it good. Don’t you know them, Draco?” Anthony asked.
"He's not a child. If he managed to hold on to his own against Voldemort, then he can handle a few muggles."
"Draco, enough." Lucius rubbed his closed eyes. "I now have to carry the burden of embarrassment that the Slytherin line of the Malfoys has been broken by my own son." Draco couldn't help the burn in his cheeks. Lucius said it like it was the worst possible thing in the entire world. "And did I see you coming out a compartment after a
"Gone?" he muttered, trying to get to back on his feet.  "You killed the basilisk?" he asked when he found the sword in Harry's hand.
Each meeting was somewhat organised with Hermione's planning, but it was really just a bunch of students trying out spells in semi-unity. But it showed Draco how well Harry took to the teaching role... and often he found himself looking at Harry helping others when we was supposed to be spotting Terry's aim as he levitated Michael. Cedric being seen at these meetings were always a shock to Draco as if he was still trying to see a ghost in Cedric's place. But Cedric took to teaching others as well and Draco saw Harry and Cedric become closer friends.
"Ah, I left something. I'll see you guys later." Pushing his fringe out of his eyes, he slung his bag over his shoulder, leaving to go to Ravenclaw tower. He passed the library on to see Potter standing outside. "Harry?" Potter turned around, looking away from inside the library. "What are you doing?"
Narcissa didn’t answer. “I’ll talk to you soon, Draco.” She pushed herself up and pressed a kiss into his hair. She went over to the other two adults. “Thank you again, Andromeda. Edward.”
Whenever he would be with Harry, Draco suddenly felt like he's never talked with another person before. When they would study, Draco found himself taking multiple glimpses to see Harry's furrowed brow of concentration. When Harry would ask for him to meet him by the Black Lake, Draco felt jittery. And when Harry would divulge his worries about the Dark Lord and the nightmares he desperately wanted to take it all away. For many nights, Draco's routine was him laying in bed repeating a mantra of
The only plus Draco could find about being from the future was that exams were simple. All he had to do is skim through some chapters to refresh his memory, but other than that, Draco was always the first to finish in the exam hall.
They walked down the corridor in silence. Draco snuck a glance to see Harry’s shoulders were now lax with ease. Draco felt a smile grow on his face. Never has he fully talked his feelings out with a tangible person... (And to have it be
Pettigrew changed tactics. “Little Malfoy, you had mercy for me! Cared for me! Please have mercy once more!” Pettigrew’s dirty hands touched Draco’s shoulder.
Hermione straightened. “I… I accept, then.” She blushed and coughed ducking her gaze down to her school bag. “I-I think I hear Crookshanks.” She got up and rushed up to the girls’ dormitory (but not before Draco saw a shadow of a smile on her face).
"Great..." Pushing himself off the floor, he patted the feathers off and started walking,trying to find his way to Charms. Lost in frustration, he didn’t notice someone else was there until he walked into something large, knocking him to the floor. "Hello... Hagrid."
He began reading through the bookshelf in his room. It was an interesting mix of wizard stories and muggle novels. Draco discovered muggles had very unique takes on magic and storytelling. (He found a lot of bright coloured books that revolved a lot around Muggle school romances that seemed targeted to young girls but Draco found himself obsessed.)
"Well," Hermione turned towards Draco. "I've already suggested it to Harry and Ron, but Harry doubts that it would work."
He stared at the telly… watching the people talk. Or were they arguing? They were arguing weird. Were they stuck in the box? The man said something and he could hear disembodied laughter. Where did that laughter come from? Why weren’t they reacting to it? Was Draco supposed to laugh too? He felt himself get lulled into a telly-induced trance.
Ron looked uneasy, glancing down at his toes every now and then. Hermione didn’t seem to mind and kept her gaze firmly on her dance partner. Ron caught Hermione's stare and he never moved his eyes away again.
At least we can say that.” Roger Davies, clasped a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “We can still take third.”
and everything went black.” he said, rubbing the back of his head. “Is it strange that I think it was Harry?”
"There’s a potion we’re making." Granger held out a moldy looking book and started turning its yellow pages. “The steps and ingredients are insanely complex and we—mostly I— wanted to ask for your help to make it. I’ve seen the grades you get in Potions. It’ll be easy for us if you helped.” She held out the book to him and Draco saw a long list of ingredients with ‘POLYJUICE POTION’ written in faded ink.
Distracted, he bumped into someone. “Sorry, Draco!” Hermione called out, still walking hurriedly in the opposite direction. Draco shrugged it off until someone shoved him to the side, this time flying past him. “Sorry, Draco!” Hermione called out again.
Hogsmeade was more lively and joyful than be last time Draco saw it. Filled with students, running after one another, laughing.
“Don’t count my failure yet. I should probably go and start trying to write this down. Maybe make a chart. Work things out.” Draco stood up and made his way to the castle.
Draco walked inside the dormitory to see Terry swinging back and forth on one of Michael’s bedposts. Anthony was laying down on his stomach on his bed, watching the scene quietly.
Draco let his gaze dart to the posters hung up on the wall and the school trunk that had wrinkled clothes and spellbooks spilling from it.
"I found it in the fireplace," Luna said and she didn't look the slightest bit phased. "I thought you'd want it back."
Draco shook his head. “I shouldn’t have gotten angry as well. Or make it seem that I knew about your own parents better than you. I hope you’re still not mad.”
"Is this my punishment?" He fell to his knees, tears stinging in his eyes. "I just don't know what to
Draco curled into him and sank to the floor, a twisting pain festering in his stomach. His quiet surface of peace was being pounded at.
Draco rolled his eyes. “He doesn’t want to talk to me and I won’t force him.” He shuffled Hagrid’s case notes. “I’ve been going through enough in my own life as it is.”
“Yeah, kind of,” Harry bit out, scrubbing a frustrated hand through his hair. “Why'd you wake me up for?”
“I have to go," Draco said, turning away from the paper and standing. He didn’t need to think about this today.
Are there inaccuracies in my portrayal of the Imperius Curse? Yeah most likely. Please kindly take this portrayal with a grain of salt then and remember that this is fanfic where anything goes.
The sky became a light grey to let the snow cover the castle grounds. Professor Flitwick hung bulbous Christmas ornaments on a pine tree that towered over the Great Hall. Red ribbons and mistletoe tied themselves around torch posts.
“The Black tapestry! My prized family heirloom. In that room on the left over there.” She pointed down the hall. “Shows all the good members of the family.”
“Yeah, in Hogsmeade, the wizard village. Third years are allowed to go now! They have all sorts of places there! Honeydukes, The Three Broomsticks, The Shrieking Shack! We’ll have the time of our lives!” Ron said excitingly.
“I believe you,” Cho added. “I think it’s obvious, don't you think? I don’t know why we’re saying this isn’t true…”
"He isn't going to wake up," a soft voice said. Harry's gaze went to the wall where a tall, black-haired boy was leaning casually. Harry has seen the boy before.
Potter glared at him. “You don’t need to point it out. Just--" He looked back out to the crowd. "This whole dance, this whole
" Riddle laughed and Harry made fists at his sides. "But soon, Draco caught on to me a tried to get rid of me. He threw me in the fireplace, can you believe that?" Riddle clicked his tongue, shaking his head. "But that didn't work. He got rid of me again, then, it worked in a way." his head shot up to Harry, a maddening gleam in his eye. "That's where
“What are you doing?” Draco asked, realizing that he hasn’t spoken to his godfather personally all term.
"I-I saw you in the sweet shop." Harry balled up his invisibility cloak. "Then you followed Nil out here. And, knowing Nil, he wouldn’t like that. Why did you follow him?”
Fast trekking footsteps left the village and continued its pace until stopped in the empty clearing near the Shrieking Shack, where Draco was before with Fletcher Nil. Draco took in the view.
“No, no, before the term started. After I blew up my aunt Marge. It was in the bushes—and now I saw it at the Quidditch match--Trelawney said it meant death—Everyone keeps saying I’m going to die, but then, they always say that--but maybe this year might finally be it—“
When everyone was thinking about the question the eagle asked at the top of the stairs ("There is a house. One enters it blind and comes out seeing. What is it?"), he finally turned to her as his friends were thinking.
"Yeah!" Anthony wrapped an arm around Draco and lead the others outside towards the Black Lake. As they were about to be out the doors, Michael was bumped and thrown off by a flurry of black robes. The robes stopped and Draco, limited with Anthony's arm still around his shoulders, strained his neck to see it was Harry. Harry's breathing was heavy and Granger and Weasley seemed to follow and stopped as well. He looked like he wanted to say something, but his green eyes drifted to the other Ravenclaws there and promptly turned back around and ran to the entrance hall the two Gryffindors running after him.
"You're in luck, we know where the Chamber is and what's inside. Let's go." Harry also pointed his wand at Lockhart.
"I don't know, Ron said that he was a Prefect here at Hogwarts fifty years ago when the supposed Chamber of Secrets was opened."
“Actually, Draco has the highest grade—Draco?” Granger stopped talking and saw that he was looking down, seeming lost in thought.
Dumbledore hovered his wand over the girl’s face. Soft, glowing whisps circled her head. Gabrielle's eyes drooped and she swayed in her chair. She slumped sideways and McGonagall rushed to catch her and keep her upright.
“Of course.” Draco stood up, not acknowledging the three boys. “I’ll be back. Don’t wait up for me.” The blond followed a pinked Harry into the hallway. The Ravenclaw boys didn’t even wait for the door to be closed before whispering to one another. (Even after two years of them doing this, he’s still nowhere close to knowing what they talked about.)
of being in a relationship. Within his mind, he had the perfect image. Romanizations that were just a tad too unrealistic for the actual world and just as improbable. He knew what his actual track record of relationships was.
A tense moment passed and a man opened the door. He recoiled when he saw Narcissa. Blond-haired, dark-eyed, a well-worn button-up, he looked beyond astounded to see Draco’s mother.
He knew Granger and he hasn't seen the Weasley girl since the train platform. Both Draco didn't want to help either in any sense. He looked back down at the journal. Maybe this is something he could use.
Gryffindor called a time-out and Michael was left silently fuming as the rain built to a steady pour.
“It was only a large gash, Professor. It did indeed have some moderate blood flow, but it’s nothing that should be concerning as it didn’t hit anywhere vital. How do you feel Mister Malfoy?”
"You're nice. Usually, I'm being asked to leave now." She didn't look up but instead flipped to a new page.
“Oi, Draco Malfoy!” Draco turned around to see a scruffy dwarf hanging off a coat of armor. “Love note for you!” The cupid waved a white envelope before jumping down and shoving students’ legs out of his way to get to Draco.
Her nose wrinkled at that name. “Call me Tonks,” She held out her hand. “You must be my dear cousin Draco. Mum told me about you.”
“On it!” Michael shouted, hurrying over to the blond and promptly latching onto Draco’s side, his temple squishing against Draco’s cheek.
The blond's smile slipped off. “I don’t know. Sometimes my… visions liked to be funny. Sometimes certain events still happen while something completely new happens, with or without my interference. As much as I want to say about how I’m trying to do the opposite.” He waved Marauder’s Map in emphasis. “It seems likely." He frowned. "Saying it out loud makes me sound like the worst Seer ever. And this vague plan pointless.”
What saved each team to be recognizable was the bright fabric of their Quidditch uniforms. Draco watched as small figures in red and green take formation and kick off into the air. A speck of green shot upwards immediately and stayed stationary. After a moment, the green speck moved to another area and repeated the process. Nil was trying to look for the Golden Snitch.
“You’re both being dramatic.” Draco huffed and started packing up his things. “You two better start thinking about who you’re going to take before it’s
Draco twisted back to where Minister Fudge and Hagrid followed Madam Rosmerta to a back room, not noticing that the door held itself open longer than it had too.
“Bloody hell, Draco!” Ron cried out, eyes wide and pulling his own filled jug closer. “Blimey, you really do just appear whenever someone’s talking about you.”
“Harry,” Draco called out. He hurried to step in front of the boy. “Harry! Listen to me! You have to listen to me.”
Draco surprisedly got letters from Weasley and his Ravenclaw friends which were sort of a new experience but replied to each and every one of them (Even if it took him a good two whole days on Weasley's letters to not sound offensive). He didn't get anything from Harry and Draco couldn't stop himself from being the slightest bit disappointed. Something about the thought Harry writing to him made him feel... odd.
Draco managed one last look over his shoulder and saw it was the same Beauxbatons boy that winked at him at the welcoming feast.
“I swear, I’m fine.” Draco felt like he was repeating himself. He sighed. “I’m not going to be long. I'll see you soon.” He didn’t wait for a response and left.
”Hey, doesn’t he look like that Malfoy prick Dad’s always on about?" George asked. Embarrassment flamed Draco's cheeks and he looked down, avoiding their gaze.
Madam Malkin's should be boarded up, not fitting him for robes. He should be seventeen, not eleven. He should be a worthless Death Eater, not a firstie preparing for Hogwarts. He should be living in fear in his own home, not waking up to— he needed to get out of here.
Draco looked away, thinking of where to start. “I wasn’t lying. It sort of is. A pure bloodline that can be traced down for generations. My father has a powerful influence in the Ministry and bends the law for his benefit. Getting away with basically anything with enough money. Everything waits on you hand to foot. How do you not grow up thinking that the world answers to you? That you were better than everyone else, even when you are not.”
, if Harry still somehow gets chosen. Wouldn’t that be… kinda cool? Dumbledore said eternal glory for the winner. If Harry managed to win… then, wouldn’t that be impressive, Draco?”
“Oh.” Harry echoed. “Right. With the Dementors. That’s what you’re talking about.” He shook his head. “Uh, yeah, it was so strange. There were Dementors swarming me and Sirius. Hermione didn’t know how to help, then Snape just...  appeared. I thought the last thing I’ll see was Snape trying to save my life. Which is weird. He managed to cast a large Patronus that repelled them all away. Did you know his Patronus is a doe?”
"Dobby needs to smash the oven door on his hands now!" The house-elf slammed the tray on his bedside table and the familiar crack went reached Draco's ears.
“Ted, what on earth are you saying?” Aunt Andromeda said as Draco turned away. “He needs to focus on O.W.L.s this year!”
Draco, who was trying to choke back the overflowing sense of guilt as the sheer stupidity of his past actions, was put on the spot.
“Nothing, nothing, I didn’t mean anything by that,” Draco paused for a moment to gather his thoughts. “I promise. I’ll go with you next Hogsmeade trip.”
His mother didn’t have this reaction before (or not he’s known of). Draco was sent home early after the game and it wasn't until he was in the middle of it that he remembered what happened that night.
“Yes…" Draco took a few steps before turning around. "Mrs Weasley, can I ask you something real quick?”
The fight was over as soon as it began as Draco swiftly got the upper hand and was smothering Harry's side into the cushions.
Draco looked towards his father, his skin still feeling itchy. “Is something supposed to be wrong with my arm?”
Narcissa was sticking out a jewelled hand to a surprised Molly Weasley when the platform went out of view. Draco lugged his trunk into the hallway, not ready to start the search for a place to sit.
"Yes," Draco said with his teeth chattering. He didn't think the lake would be so cold. "Thank you, Cho."
When Draco was out of sight he bypassed the staircase to walk further along the hallway until he reached a set of double doors. He pushed one open, minding the creak, to peek inside. Finding no house-elfs, Draco shuffled inside and closed the door behind him.
“Alright, more time with us then!” Ron gleamed, knocking his elbow into Harry’s arm. “Great, isn’t it?”
fine.” Draco moved towards the Hogwarts Express and stepped on. “How have you been?” He asked over his shoulder as they walked down the aisle.
The four Ravenclaws stepped off the train, awkwardly bunched in a corner of Platform Nine-and-Three-Quarters.
Feeling kicked out, he wandered the Hogwarts Express until he found another set of three faces. Draco pulled opened the sliding door. “Mind if I sit?” he asked the occupants.
“I-I was… I was heading back to my Common Room, sir.” He decided to use the go-to excuse for all Ravenclaws. “I lost track of time at the library.”
Harry ducked his face into his shoulder. Draco was overwhelmed with the sudden weight but he settled an arm over Harry’s shoulder. Draco knows what his mother would do. She would whisper comforting words and run her fingers through his hair. Draco felt dark hair tickle at his numb throat.
“You did that Harry! Don’t you remember? I was clueless! I talked like I had everything under control but I didn’t. I was wrong. I wasn’t—I wasn’t needed. He’s--He’s
was Quidditch, Ron asking what type of seats he got, before finding Harry’s describing his recent trip to London with Sirius to get proper attire for the World Cup.
"That looks… awful,” Draco said, gagging at the awful smell. “Wait, give yourself some space. As you noticed, Crabbe and Goyle don’t fit skinny and lanky.” They were all crowded in the stall with the potion. Draco did
When Draco replied to her sentence one day in broken fragments, she sat him in a chair and gave what became the bane of Draco’s existence: a French workbook that came with a ceramic songbird that served as his instructor. The bird would come to life and perch on Draco’s shoulder, monitoring his progress. It would chirp a phrase and rewarded Draco with a lovely tune if correct, but if not, it would peck at his ear and he’d have to try again. (The same would happen when writing phrases.)
"No, I don't. Can I come in?" Draco nodded and Lucius took the invitation. His father's boots clicked loudly along the floor. Draco climbed on his bed, unable to resume unpacking. He waited for Lucius to start talking.
“This is what I want him to avoid," Draco heard Lucius continue. "To never be pulled into this world."
When they were far from any source of people, when it was just the two of them, Nil stopped. “What?” He grounded out, hands crammed into his jacket pockets. “What you following me for, Malfoy?”
--made him feel off-put. "We don't seem to see each other that much. I don't want us to stop talking because of it. You can promise me that we'll spend more time together--but you can say no." Draco couldn't even think why he would say no.
Harry erupted out of the water, collapsing onto the deck, people swarming around him with warm blankets and towels. Between fluttering bodies and arms, Harry’s eyes gravitated to Draco’s.
Fletcher Nil was glaring at them, blocking their path. Crabbe and Goyle were standing dutifully behind him to give off the menacing look that Nil couldn’t achieve himself. Draco steadily kept his gaze away from both of them.
“What? Am I not good enough for the famous Harry Potter’s time, but the Slytherin traitor is?” Fletcher seethed, his weasel-like features twisting. “I bet his family were so disappointed that he failed their Slytherin legacy. It’s amazing that his father can even let him be in the same room as him.” Draco felt his anger swell to meet the baiting insult. (As did anything that concerned legacy.)
How did Buckbeak escape, he was never told, but he had to go with it. "Because-Because--" Merlin, Draco thought he was getting better at hiding it. "The execution date hasn't been set. Maybe there's a chance for us to find something and make an appeal."
"Potter and his group found her hanging on the torch bracket as we were coming back from the feast,” Michael said. Draco curled his lips inward.
“What are you doing?” Draco asked, looking at Creevey’s bowl of grapes and his giant muggle camera hanging on thin, measly straps.
Draco pushed himself through the parents and managed to step up onto a train cart, the floor moving under him. He turned back to see his mother and Mrs. Weasley waving at him. Everything about the two women was different. From Narcissa’s carefully curled hair to Mrs. Weasley’s shoes that had one of the faux buckle straps hanging loosely off her heel. Narcissa glanced over at Mrs Weasley in scrutiny.
Draco had never felt so uncomfortable. The reality of him being eleven again had passed (sort of), but seeing Diagon Alley, bustling with movement and
“It was nice to see you again, Draco,” Pansy continued, not even acknowledging Nil. “I’ll see you around.” She turned and almost ran into the Nil. “Oh! Sorry whoever you are.” Pansy’s mouth curled into a false smile as she moved around Nil to return to a group of Slytherin girls and leave the classroom.
The group shrugged and compiled. Ron skipped the last of the stairs with a mischievous glint in his eye. “Man, I should find Michael right now before he forgets!”
"Minerva, go fetch Mister Potter and Mister Weasley with Severus. This seems to deal with your students." Dumbledore spoke calmly. McGonagall nodded and followed Snape out of the hall. "Now that excitement is over, let me go over the rules for the first years." They reluctantly took their attention back to the Headmaster.
Draco buried himself in the sheets. He had settled in and everyone had thought to call it a night and he happily agreed. His eyes studied his blue, four-poster bed, not over the fact that it was not green nor was the patch on his robes.
The three Gryffindors pulled seats to their tables (drawing more annoyed looks with the bustle of noise).
Harry’s eyes bulged as his face pinked. “I-I mean…” He seemed to flounder for a word. “I just noticed that you’re both--You’re--You’re both… You’re both… Blond.”
"I think he haunts me," Harry admitted quietly. "I hear whispering… I think he's in my head. I dream of a long hallway.
“Nothing is. Is that all you needed?” Fletcher opened his mouth but Malfoy abruptly cut in, “Bye then.”
There’s no way Harry Potter could develop feelings for him. There’s no possibility in the universe, in any universe. He was Draco Malfoy. He was once his arch-nemesis. If they couldn’t be enemies then the closest thing they could have was friendship. And even as his friend, he was terrible.
Draco tucked the towel tightly around himself and left the dock as Fleur shoved herself in front of Harry, thanking him for saving her sister with a kiss on his cheek.
Hermione opened her mouth to protest but shut it closed. She gave him a furtive glance. “Do you… have anyone you want to ask?”
He took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and willed his fingers to stop shaking as he felt the leather leave his hand.
The overwhelming fire was blurring Draco’s sight, waves of heat making his skin tingle. The sensation felt familiar… Draco felt his chest twist and his breath mangled in his throat. He thinks he could hear Mr. Weasely’s shouts of them to get to the forest but it felt so far away. He could only look at the masked figures.
"Sorry, mate, you're just going to have to deal with it." Terry snickered. Draco turned his head to see the blonde fuming as Terry used him for an armrest. The brunet smiled at Draco. "He's mad because they don't put up Jewish decorations like they do for Christmas."
"Meet with me tonight. Don't tell anyone about it. I'm only going to tell Ron." It sounded rather personal to Draco, something that he shouldn't be part of.
“Yes, I don’t remember seeing your father so human as you are." Draco wanted to laugh. Of course, his father would never let anyone see him in such a state.
"Take a bath, you smell and you're tense; I can feel it in your shoulders. Eat something. Do you still have candy? You probably do." Draco was rambling at this point. "Eat a Chocolate Frog. Maybe start a Chocolate Frog card collection. I’m not into that sort of thing, but maybe you are. You look like the type. Don't you still have Dumbledore? He can be your first card--" Harry stopped a couple steps before they reached the floor, making him crash into his back.
Now that Draco was going through with the idea that he was a Seer, he needed to read up on Divination and common practices in order to pull off the guise that he was a prophetic being. Yet he wondered if he could stomach the almost ridiculousness of looking at tea dregs and having Trelawaney’s almost scary perception.
“Arithmancy is putting logical and concrete understanding to what the universe has been and what it shall be. It takes the chaotic and uncharted mess of human personality and events and puts them into a systematic, numerical context. Why does this happen? Why does the universe wish for this to happen? We put reasoning to figure out the spontaneous acts of the future. Why and how are we placed in certain segments of life and what occurs in those segments.”
“Hello, Draco, dear,” Molly Weasley pulled away to gather his face in her hands and kissed his forehead. “Oh, how have you been?”
Some nights were bad. Nightmares of seeing a giant snake hiss around the manor made him weary of coming out of his room, unwanted images of the Dark Lord both in the future and from the forest came together that made Draco get bags under his eyes the next morning.
Draco and Lucius were in Knockturn Alley. At first, Draco would've boasted that he was allowed in the shadiest part of Wizard London, now, he knew that everything down here should not be treated like an honour and more like a sickening secret.
"No, thanks." The blond quickly stuffed his wand into the seat as the compartment door opened for the fourth time. Hermione Granger walked in.
Hermione’s flustered face as she ran away from Draco’s questioning. Hermione did sort of know Fleur… she was keeping tabs on all the champions to compare to Harry. But that wasn’t the same as
“I asked Hermione to take off Michael’s face paint,” Draco grumbled. “She scrubbed too hard. Hey, why are you laughing?!” He gave a forceless punch at a giggling Harry who tipped to the side to hide his smiles. Unconsciously smirking, he grabbed the pillow nestled beside him and whacked Harry. “Prat!”
Days later, Draco was staring unseeingly at the telly as Aunt Andromeda’s question created a loud buzzing in his head.
“He saved my life,” Draco said suddenly. “He did it by killing a basilisk. Still one of the most impressive things I’ve seen him do.”
“Make yourself at home then. I bet we can livin’ this place up with some posters and whatnot. Whatever you like.”
"Don’t let what Flint said get to you. You’re not a traitor or anything like that. Don’t know how you can be anyhow,“ Harry huffed, seeming like he ran there from Hagrid’s hut. Angry jibes that were being made in his head disappeared.
"You won't be needing it anymore." Riddle's smile suddenly looked incongruous, too cold for Riddle's handsome face. "I've waited a long time for you, Harry Potter," Riddle said. "A very long time."
“Trust me, Narcissa. This is all happening in the name of my solemn oath to protect our son. Please, trust me.”
“But what’s the point if they don’t appreciate it?” Draco asked. “Or that it ends up blowing up in your face? What if you already know you can't change the past?”
"When I was leaving, I noticed a black egg in the fire. Anyone with common sense could figure it out." The lie came smoothly enough.
The boy looked back at the crystal ball to see if his eyes were only playing tricks because they had to be joking. He didn't really see that. He couldn't. His heartbeat thudded.
The dark-haired boy ran a hand through his damp hair. "I know that we really can't trust Trelawney, but she seems to know something about you. I can't help but think I might..."
If his friends were around Harry enough they could see that Harry had the right kind of humour that could make Draco laugh and see why Draco missed Harry’s company so much.
Draco finished climbing the stairs when he heard quick footsteps echoing from the staircase above him. A flutter of black robes happened as the person turned down the hall onto the staircase Draco was on.
and everyone just doesn’t believe me. They're--Pretending that nothing's coming. All the newspapers did over the summer was keep saying the same thing over and over and not even a word about Voldemort. And it’s getting to me a little bit."
Around mid-December, Draco found outside to be covered in several feet of snow, the lake was frozen solid. No one (aside from Draco) could wait for the holidays to start.
Snape slowed to stand in front of them. He eyed the upturned corners of Draco’s mouth, his gaze darted to a silent Harry before looking back at his godson. “Mister Malfoy.” Snape’s dark eyes held some semblance of warmth. “Potter,” he said with less familiarity.
She looked over at him incredulously. “Yeah,” She settled her attention back to the television. “I’m Sirius Black’s parole officer.”
Draco has a feeling that his mother wouldn’t join them but it didn’t stop him from wanting to protest. Before he could open his mouth, his surroundings exploded into a whirlwind of colours.
“Ron’s not saying that anyone’s forgotten! But…” Hermione furrowed her brow. “I think… many would call it a second chance. People should get a second chance if they really put themselves into it. As in, they don’t put their second chance to waste. I think knowing you’ve done wrong and acknowledging from it is
“No,” Draco shook his head. “Wait, I mean, it’s…it’s sort of happened before but never like that...”
"Something told me," Draco answered flatly, crouching down to the last bookshelf, skimmed the spines until he found
who said was inspired by this fic! it’s amazing and exactly what i imagine draco to look like so give it lots and lots of love!! And here’s another
But Draco knew he shouldn’t be that surprised that the three were snooping around, but they were talking about sneaking into the
“You’ve--” Another horrifying moment of clarity struck him. “You’ve all been whispering amongst each other for as long as I can remember! You all knew from the start! For, For years! You were so obvious! You asked those questions. Those pushing, annoying hints. How is that not trying to meddle?!”
Draco looked at the hallway entrance the sound of the name and sat up as his mother rushed into the room.
The Firebolt gleamed with new polish. Children were jabbing at the glass, innocently wishing of wanting the fast broom to fly. Flying, Quidditch. Something Draco actually loved. It was an amazing experience in itself. Draco would practice all throughout the summer, hoping that he'll be enough to beat Potter the next year. It was something he missed. But it wasn't something he felt allowed to. Not anymore. Draco turned away from the Firebolt.
“I know that it's dangerous! And it's not just Pettigrew. I can feel it to be true. It’s this feeling that’s been… It’s a feeling that I’ve had for a while now. He’s… He
"So... what really happened down there?" It was there that Harry spilled everything. From the mirror to burning Quirrell's face, his eyes seemed glued to the white bedsheet. Draco shivered and even full-on cringed at some parts, but otherwise was calm.
—buttons hurriedly. Draco barely got through the last row and under his covers before the door slammed open.
Unable to help it, Draco’s gaze moved over to Harry’s. “I had it over the summer. It’s the Triwizard Tournament. It’s happening this year.”
Three set of steps that belonged to Harry, Granger, and Longbottom echoed as they appeared. "Follow me." Draco fell into step with the others as they marched outside to Hagrid’s hut. Harry's expression brightened when he saw it was Hagrid who they will spend their detention with, but Filch put an end to that very quickly. "I suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy- it's into the forest you're going and I'm much mistaken if you'll come out alive."
“No, not really.” He couldn't take Pansy this time. Maybe he could take a Ravenclaw girl… Luna maybe?
“I’ll be back later,” Draco called over his shoulder, moving towards the bright campgrounds of the Quidditch World Cup.
“You might feel a little lightheaded from the blood loss so drink this.” She uncorked a potion and placed it in Draco’s hand. The potion left a sour taste but Draco drank it all the same.
, but Harry said nothing. Ginny awkwardly patted his knee for comfort before the silence became unbearable and left for her dormitory. Fred and Geroge followed suit, probably grabbing something in their dorm to liven up the room.
Draco groaned and settled back onto the ground, each ragged breath making one of Draco’s sides throb.
"It’s probably nothing, you know? It's probably some sick prank by the Slytherins," Anthony said, non discreetly looking at Michael and Terry, who vigorously nodded.
"Draco," Hermione said. "It's so good to see you!" She moved out from under Ron and stood to rush Draco in a hug.
“Thank you.” Draco looked up to at all three of them. “And thank you for the gifts. I didn’t think you would after how I acted… I’m sorry. I said that I wanted to be a good friend, but I’m… not.” He really wasn’t. How was it so bad at it? How was is it so
He could barely hear Weasley and Granger’s voices as they came up to the scene. He could barely hear
Michael didn’t acknowledge them as he was still glaring at Terry. "Enough about my hair!” He self-consciously running his fingers through his long bangs. “It's not that bad…”
"Okay." Like the good, empty-headed goons Draco remembered, they didn't question him. "We'll be in another compartment. If you need us, just come and get us.”
"Is it?" Harry took a chance a sat down next to him, glad the stench of the chamber was now washed away from himself.
“As my godfather, can you trust me?” Draco pleaded. “Take him to Dumbledore. We can't let him escape.” There wasn't a proper reason that he knew of for this, but he knew enough.
,” He said as a near sigh. The hero worship never really faded away. “Not only he’s called the best Seeker in the world. And he’s also the youngest.”
It was the end of the day and Draco hasn't really talked to anyone today because of the massive homework checks he was doing for his housemates. He didn't think he would see the three Gryffindors today.
“‘Dromeda, he’s ready.” Ted stretched out his arm and gave Draco a brief squeeze. “Have a good year, son.”
Anthony still looked half-asleep, his eyes not even open. He pointed to the window where a bird silhouette moved. “Owl,” he said. With that, he turned around and crawled back into his bed.
“Whoa!” Anthony stumbled to keep himself upright with the unexpected weight. “Okay, this a hug.” He clapped Draco’s back in greeting. “Where’s this coming from? Is everything okay? Oh, no, wait.” He abruptly pulled Draco back by the shoulders.
By Christmas morning, Draco had memorized the entire tree. From the repeated uses of the name Sirius and Regulus from previous family members to always lingering on Andromeda’s kind eyes.
Crookshanks started hissing wildly. The Dementor moved its hood as if it was looking out into each compartment. A spindly long-fingered hand emerged from the cloak. The Dementor opened their own compartment door.
Hermione checked around her before she whispered, "I was thinking of making an organization. A secret one. One to teach students how to correctly protect themselves from the Dark Arts."
"That's fine. I needed time to adjust to the school," her whisper-like voice said. "I also noticed that you're pretty busy yourself."
The smoke and oppressive waves of heat made Draco feel lightheaded, the dull roar making the hair on the back of his neck shiver in vague recognition. His heart was thundering, his breaths cutting too quickly just to be from rising smoke, the piercing screams fueling rising fear.
“I did,” Aunt Andromeda said. “I mean, I was meant to marry a pureblood. Perhaps I was meant to become a Death Eater myself. But I chose not to do that. Trust me when I say that I know what atrocities our family carries, Draco. You and I have both benefited from them. That is why it's up to us to attempt to make progress."
The future’s not set in stone. Growth takes time. Mistakes should be acknowledged and lead to second chances.
The forest was black and silent. Harry, Granger, and Hagrid went to the left of the fork while Draco and Longbottom went to the right with Fang. They spent the few minutes wondering. Draco, looking for glimpses of unicorn blood, Longbottom, practically on top of him clinging on tightly.
This was the second time Draco woke up and found feathers stuck to his robe and (he thinks) the third time he found himself in a lone corridor.
“But it’s true!” Michael cried. “I don’t think I’ll ever have something like this without anyone else. You’re all family to me.”
Antsy to not miss the portkey, he headed towards his father’s study. When he reached the hallway, he could hear his mother. Very upset.
After Arithmancy, he joined his friends and other Ravenclaws to march down to the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Hagrid was waiting for them. He was smiley and joyful, his first class seems to be a success. “Right then! The first lesson was a breeze, let's go fer another!”
“Draco, I know you must not like what I said before and it’s very understandable, but… please, listen to me. Keeping it to yourself is the best way for everyone to stay safe.”
“Don’t do that, you’ll ruin the new paint job.” Draco bent down to drag the cat away. “Gryffindors aren’t allowed in our common room, you know?” Crookshanks walked up to the door all the same. "Blasted cat," Draco muttered under his breath.
"That's the thing," Harry moved his schoolbag to the side, the floor streaking with ink as he leant closer to Draco. "It's a feeling I have. Something is important about this diary. I just need to hold onto it."
"He's been glancing at you for quite a while," a snickering voice on his other side said. Draco turned to see another Ravenclaw looking at him, a boy.
take them out of Ravenclaw tower. Your trunks should be up there already. I suggest you all get some sleep. Classes start first thing tomorrow morning. Good night,” Penelope said and turned around and started going towards the door. Draco and the rest of the first years followed.
you, as well, should be a boy, but it seems you carried a burden early. A second year should worry about exams, and something tells me what you know is far from that."
Even with the burden of exams was nonexistent, he felt jumpy and kept looking in the corner of his eye to see if any shadows followed him. Draco had more sleepless nights, each dragging on until one time he was still tossing and turning as he heard the other Ravenclaws get up for breakfast.
a more advanced form of magic than the third-year level, I’m sure that it’s something you’re well capable of.” he gave an easy smile. “They’ll take place Thursday evenings at eight o’clock. You’d also be learning alongside Mister Potter if that makes a difference.” Lupin squinted at Draco’s frown. “
“You don’t have to ask!” Anthony placed his book face down and climbed out of bed. He went to Draco’s other side and Draco’s face smothered against Anthony’s collarbone.
The idea that he could actually sabotage Diggory was a half-formed at best, not to mention that he almost felt like cheating Diggory out of the respect and recognition he gained from the Hogwarts students.
! Right in front of us! After mentally scarring me, he makes us go to bed--just to pull us out to tell you were in the Hospital Wing without a
"Trust me, Harry. He's just odd. Nothing to worry about." Draco took in Harry's appearance again and frowned. "You look tired, you need to go to bed," He turned Harry around and began forcing him down the spiral stairs.
Harry snorted. “Like what? Oh, wait, I’ve been meaning to ask, what’s that Muggle thing you like so much? Sliding doors? What’s with that?”
“Mrs. Weasley. You know, your friend’s mother.” She handed him the postcard and Draco took it, his brow furrowed. The postcard had the Weasleys smiling and waving at him, all wearing jumpers with initials and red hats on top of their heads.
"They must be terrible people." Draco suddenly thought that he didn't know much about Harry's life outside of Hogwarts.
As Fudge settled Sirius onto a bed, he turned back to Dumbledore. “Well, who would’ve thought? Peter Pettigrew, alive!” he exclaimed.
Draco left the compartment as quickly as he could without actually running. Lovegood had managed to make him uncomfortable the whole ride that he was afraid to even cough if that meant her eyes would go to him. Not even Granger appeared once which he hoped would keep Lovegood occupied. This was more uncomfortable than meeting the Weasleys that day in Diagon Alley.
“I mean—“ A random arm shot abruptly in Draco’s face to get more lollipops, surprising the blond. “—if nothing happens—“ he stumbled.
Draco just finished wrapping up the story about Voldemort having meetings in his house when a sliver of sunlight appeared on his hand. Draco stretched his neck to squint at the dark blue curtains. Pulling them back, he hissed at the sudden brightness that took over his eyes.
Aunt Andromeda and Uncle Ted were searching the crowd, their hands tightly clasped to one another. When their eyes landed on Draco, the two let out a long breath.
"Don't freak out! It's just an invisibility cloak." He pulled it off and Draco could see a head attached to a body again. Breathing through his nose, he calmed down.
After he left the Owlery, he went back to his room to hang up his coat and prepare his thoughts (stall, really) before going to his father’s study to apologise. Steadying his breath, he rapped lightly on the door, feeling like he was pounding his fist against it. When there wasn’t an immediate reply, Draco had a panicked thought that he wasn’t even inside before hearing a muffled, “Come in.”
”Sorry about them they always get odd when they’re around you,” Draco said offhandedly. “I have no idea where it comes from.”
"I knew Lockhart had no brain, but this is impressive,” Ignoring Hermione's glare, Draco picked up Harry’s flimsily hand, “to mess up this badly.” He shook the arm lightly and weighed the boneless arm in his hand. “Can you feel this?” Harry shook his head, looking at his hand in Draco's with a pained expression.
Draco glanced at each compartment door as they walked by. He saw a group young first years nervously chatting with their heads ducked forward and averting his gaze when a shameless seventh year couple didn’t even close the blinds to have their passionate make out. The noticeable age difference behind each of the door was vividly reflective… Draco could say internally he was, in fact, seventeen, but his father gifted him a Nimbus Two-Thousand and One (the Firebolt was still not for consumer sale) as a late birthday gift for turning
“Oh! Oh, your poor cousin!” Draco gasped, placing a hand on his chest and cheek. “I feel so terrible! That’s just so awful!”
“Oh, no that was one the greatest moments of my life. She deserved every last bit of it.” Harry said bitterly and suddenly this story had a very different feeling from its telling in the bookstore.
Merlin, Draco's heart was about to explode. He took a huge gulp of air. “I… I think… I think I might—I mean, I don’t think you’d—I want to… I like—“ Draco wanted to sink into the ground. He was
“Okay.” He did what she said. After a few minutes of that, they prepared to add the knotgrass. Then there was a new voice at the stall.
Instantly, the corridor was flooded with people, like the entire student body was hiding behind the doors. After mass confusion and teachers ushering students back into their classrooms, a Hufflepuff pushed his way to the front and his eyes found Draco.
“Right, right, calming down.” Ron soothed. “But can you blame me? I’ve been excited ever since you told us that you’ll finally confess—“
"How was your--" Harry's question was cut off with him staring at the quiet book. "How is it staying still?"
“Oh, I see how it is.” Flint’s eyes flicked towards Draco before going back onto Harry. “Well, if you
) remarks himself, until Crabbe and Goyle, on instinct, followed Draco’s order and pulled Nil out of reach.
As expected, Potter was nowhere to be seen at the Gryffindor table, neither was Weasley. He saw Granger looking around the Gryffindor table, looking for the two as well. He knew that they wouldn't be there, but for a reason he couldn't explain, he was hoping they were all right and sitting at the annoyingly bright red table.
Draco nodded, squeezing his mouth into a squirming line to choke back laughter as he calmly said, "It looks fantastic."
Draco wanted to comment on how Harry was fidgeting the entire walk to the owlery but refrained. It couldn't be that important if Harry didn't seem too bothered. As Harry attached his letter to Hedwig, Draco turned away to stroke the head of a dark grey owl dozing off.
Draco couldn’t help the soft smile that appeared on his face. This was the Hogwarts he liked. No Dark Lord, no war, no Death Eaters, just... magic. Potter stopped him from running into someone when they stopped, Draco having been looking at the ceiling and not paying attention.
Terry poked his head out, bewildered. “Right, this is probably the most insane one!” he gasped. He glanced over at Draco and did a double-take. “Are you eating popcorn?!”
"You could've told me, Draco. You didn't have to invest in a diary for that. I meant it when I said that I could help you last year... I..."
The conversation trailed in and out of different topics and when the witch with the trolley cart came and went, Draco remembered that he wasn't supposed to be sitting there the entire ride.
“I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting," McGonagall advised. Potter started to nervously flatten his hair as he fidgeted.
Draco straightened and took a deep breath (then another) and marched towards them. As he neared, the faces of three Ravenclaws turned to him.
“Of course not, Mister Malfoy. If it makes you… happy… I won’t interfere.” Snape seemed to strangle the words out. It was an odd way to phrase it but Draco shrugged it off. “But you are aware that going outside without supervision is forbidden this year given with all the… paranoia.” Snape said pointedly. “And it was a priority that Mister Potter shouldn’t go anywhere outside of the castle.”
“Snape has been… okay in class believe it or not.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “Doesn’t bully Neville at all mostly. I still don't think he likes me but he’s been actually alright for a while now.” Harry gave a wry smile. “Ron’s says he’s pulling back all his insults until one day he snaps.”
"Fancy meeting you here, Malfoy," Ron said airly, already knowing that Draco also shared Top Box tickets.
"Don't be dramatic, Terry! You're making this into a big deal for no reason and nothing to back it up." Anthony argued.
Disclaimer that this is a projected number of chapters left because I want to include two (maybe three) more side stories and make sure they’re not too oddly spaced out between the main storyline but yes, my realm of thinking that HRI has at least 11 more chapters! Get ready! Thank you for reading!
Draco followed her up the paved walkway to the front door. Narcissa smoothed down her hair, brushed off imaginary dust, and took a deep breath. Then, they stood in silence.
"It's nice to see you." Draco turned away from the window to go up to a bookshelf, trying to look for the new Potions book. "How was your summer?" he asked, looking at the other boy. Harry was not looking at him but glaring at Ron, waving an arm towards him as if shooing off a stray dog. "Harry?"
Terry blew out a long breath. Michael was tossing his dormant miniature Snitch between his hands. Anthony was shaking his leg.
“Give him a moment.” Anthony’s words were the last thing Draco heard before the wind picked up and separating them from the blond.
. Draco's hand felt warm in his and Harry hoped that he could pass off the lie that his palms were getting sweaty because he fought the Serpent of Slytherin. "I don't know how I could ever repay you." Harry looked back up to the grey eyes that he liked so much.
During this time, Anthony only sighed at the Christmas garnish and, dutifully, lit a candle each night on his small menorah that was on his bedside table when Hanukkah started early in December. When Draco got ready to sleep he could hear Anthony’s low voice in the dormitory as he mumbled prayers in Hebrew.
"It's alright, Mr. Malfoy." McGonagall gently said. "I'm sorry I had to question you, I just feel awful about this." she patted Draco's arms. "I found this with them outside the library," she addressed the last sentence to Harry and Ron and held out a mirror that came out of her robe pocket.
"You don't know how much I'm... happy that we're friends." His eyes shifted away, unable to speak while looking at Harry. "I was never--good at keeping friendships. Friendships that I could count on. I was either too untrusting--or I trusted the wrong people." Unwanted emotion got stuck in his throat. Draco took a moment to collect himself. "I was never quite good enough to feel like someone should've cared about me that wasn't... my mother. Meeting you was new. You were insistent, you seemed
The Gryffindors shifted towards the Ravenclaws. Harry gave Ron a slight push to set his sleeping bag near Draco’s. A ripple of snorts from Anthony, Terry, Michael, and Ron occurred.
The third years buzzed all day with excitement at the first trip to Hogsmeade. They all seemed to rush after the last class of the day to get ready for the late afternoon.
Draco wasn’t stupid, the evidence was there. Tonks' letters said that Moody’s behaviour wasn’t typical, his hyper-awareness of Harry, and his insistence that Draco made sure that Harry won first place. Barty Crouch was there that night and he was found by Moody before the Triwizard champions were announced. The overall feeling of
Draco shuddered at the recollection of his tiny paws, quivering furry body, and the sensation of crawling up a pair of trousers. “
The Three Broomsticks was packed with Hogwarts students. Harry grabbed Draco's wrist to lead him to a table of their own. Draco sort of wanted to the rest of their friends to be here with them. The two groups found each other not long after Harry's spontaneous rescue, but when Harry repeated his wish, the group of boys and girl insisted that Draco should do it. By himself.
“Well, I wasn’t scared for you. And I was impressed to a point. You’re a good wizard, Harry. It’s one of the things I admire about you.”
“Hey, Draco, you all right, mate?” Weasley managed to ask before a slug dripped out of his mouth. Draco’s eyes focused and went to the steaming cup of tea in front of him.
A young woman with spiky, bubblegum pink hair stepped into the living room, wiping down long Auror robes. She looked up and blinked at the stunned Draco sitting on the couch.
Draco didn’t say anything. He didn't want to deal with their reactions today. That was a concern for another day.
After a few minutes, the Snitch fluttered over a particular tent before going through the open flap. Draco stepped inside, taking in the expanded space. Towards the back of the tent, he saw Michael eyeing himself in a large handheld mirror.
“I don’t even want to know what happened.” Hermione shook her head. “It was… madness. Terrible, there was so much screaming and…”
“I don’t know… I had no place to go. They’re all I have.” Merlin, if Draco didn’t feel bad already for wondering how Harry’s home life was, he now felt like an even bigger prick. “I was fun for a moment. They were scared of me doing magic in the house until they found out it was against the rules last year." Harry's muggle life wasn't so glamorous as Draco thought it was.
“No! I mean—what I meant to say—“ Harry took a deep breath. “What I meant to say is…” Draco could practically
Divination was already tense when Draco found Ron was sitting with Harry. Ron seemed uncomfortable, his eyes wide and apologetic.
“Professor Lupin requested a potion from me. I was only delivering it to his office.” Snape droned. Harry blanched at the explanation and Snape’s eyebrow twitched at the reaction. “It’s so interesting...” Snape continued, no shift in his tone to show actual interest. “Professor Lupin and I were discussing the both of you in his office.”
“I have until February to think about it,” Harry shrugged. “Hey… I've been meaning to ask. Anthony and them told me that you were fine during my task. You didn’t react to me getting chased out of the stadium by a dragon. Did you already foresee it and... not actually impressed?"
the prettiest person in this room right now,” Draco said, lifting her up when the beat jumped. “He’s looking at you.”
Standing up with a flourish, he left his room and went downstairs. He entered the living room and found Tonks sprawled on the couch, watching a sitcom as she mindlessly gnawed on a liquorice wand.
A thrilling panic shot through Harry as Draco’s gaze fell down to his mouth. Draco started leaning forward, tilting his head.
"Where have you been?" He scratched his hair into a more chaotic mess. "Seems you've been missing around the manor all summer." Draco all but yawned the words. Bat-like ears folded in on themselves.
Malfoy took his arm back and continued down the corridor. Nothing felt particularly wrong with that interaction but it felt… strange.
The next day, Draco was waving his wand in an abandoned classroom for the phonograph to start playing waltz music. He turned around and stood in front of a frowning Ron.
Hagrid knocked on the castle door, and Professor McGonagall swung open the door after a moment. The smell of dusty, old air filled Draco’s nose as they walked down a torch-lit corridor.
Ron promised that he'll go easy on his girlfriend for Hermione to shoot him across the room and Cedric was pleasantly surprised that Cho didn't hesitate to disarm him, and, after much pestering, when Harry called Draco to duel he looked wildly at the blond when he silently blocked his spell and made him stumble and fall with a spell they weren't taught.
Moody’s glass eye scanned Tonks as if he was trying to figure out who she was. “Apologies,” he settled on.
did this, along with the attack on the Hufflepuff boy," the professor said. Harry briefly glanced up from Hermione, looking at said boy in the last row of beds, "but I know you wouldn't attack your own housemate and a close friend, would you?" McGonagall's robes made a rustling noise as she walked up beside the blond, who stepped closer to the girl -- Penelope, Draco called her.
The second he entered Flourish and Blotts, the strained-looking manager rushed up to him. "Hogwarts? Yes, yes I already know." He stuffed bandage covered fingers in leather gloves, grabbed a splintering knobby stick and headed towards the cage of books in the window display. The book growled as the manager pushed it into his arms, snapping wildly with its sharp teeth. Draco shakily started pressing his hand against the spine.
Ignoring the small voice in the back of his head that said the opposite, he left Harry’s room and climbed down the stairs to see Ron and Hermione waiting for him on the first landing.
“I’m going to search for my friend, Michael. The one who wrote to me this summer. I told you about it,” Draco said.
Terry rolled his eyes. “Please, I know that I’m not going to hear the end of it about how I was wrong ‘bout him never finding a girlfriend.”
Sharp thumps battered at Draco’s sides. He gave a startled cry when a foot stomped ontop of him and forced air out of his lungs. He crawled out of the mainstream of people and scrambled to get back on his feet.
Draco held open the tent’s flap for Harry and followed him inside to see people scattered across the expanded space.
. It’s about being there where it mattered, consistently giving them support. It was something that happened naturally. Nothing
"Er, I think so. I think Mum's got a cousin who's an accountant, but we don't talk about him. There might be a great aunt but I don't really know." They turned to Draco.
thing I want to do.” Terry tucked his arms behind his head. “If I think about it, no one at Hogwarts or otherwise has caught my attention.”
? We don't know a thing about Black, Narcissa. I already know where he'll be heading to. What if Draco gets tangled in such a mess again?"
Hermione the next came to him outside the Great Hall before breakfast one morning with a tear-speckled letter from Hagrid.
Draco spun to keep Michael’s Snitch in his view. The Snitch twitched away and, when it noticed Draco following, continued to lead him.
“Which is a good thing to hear!” Lupin nodded. “Very good thing to hear, but I know how experiences like those can be… unpleasant. I wanted to give an invitation for a lesson to learn a spell that’ll help you counteract them. The Patronus charm.”
The corridors of Hogwarts were emptied of students, the sky was darkening to burnt orange, casting long shadows as the torches sparked to life. Draco's shadow fluctuated between tall imposing figures to disappearing as he marched towards the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom.
Harry was wide-eyed as Draco and Fleur stepped inside to meet with them, Terry, Anthony, and Luna moving along to enter the dance.
Months had passed since the attack on Justin Finch-Fletchley and Nearly Headless Nick. Draco seemed to no longer frighten his other housemates or make the Hufflepuffs scatter away from him anymore now that the rumours were slowly passing. Yet, Draco always appeared oddly silent, barely reacting to things around him when Harry saw him at meals. Harry still hasn't told him about the theory that Hagrid might've been the one who opened the chamber or that he'd figure out Riddle's diary at all.
“That’s excellent to hear,” she removed her hands and headed back to the stove where a pot was boiling.
Giving them a silent treatment, Draco got dressed and headed down to the Great Hall for breakfast, all while shoving down complicated feelings deep inside himself to not feel their presence. As the four Ravenclaws sat themselves down. He risked a glance at the Gryffindor table.
Draco glanced over at Harry who was pointedly not looking at him. Irritation burned through him. He pursed his mouth and felt his nose upward as he redirected himself towards Hermione’s table who seemed just as worried as Ron.
This was the best Christmas Day Draco ever had at Hogwarts. That afternoon he even had a surprise run-in with Potter and Weasley on the school grounds and they fought in the snow and it was actually... enjoyable. He later refused profusely about thinking such a thing later that day.
"There's no reason for Draco to be here as well," Mrs Weasley said as she ushered out a fuming Ginny out of the room. "Hasn't that boy been put through enough already?"
sidenote shoutout to the marauders for never making their map differentiate between seniors and juniors bc i really was about to have writer's block Again jhdfjaskh
“Don’t have such a smug face,” Anthony said as they watched Harry held up the golden egg to the crowd of Gryffindors. They were hanging off to the sides to not show that Ravenclaws were in their midst. “You’re insufferable when you get that face.”
His memory was failing him right now. That made a worry line on Draco's forehead. The journal was tucked away in his truck that was still left out. Making a mental note to start writing as soon as possible, he pushed himself up and shoved his truck up on the railing above him. As he sat back down he heard the door open at the same time.
Tonks poked her head in. Her hair now red-tinged black, jagged strands framing her face. “Hey, we’re gathering the Order. Wanna come with?"
Draco’s eyes darted to Michael. “No idea. I just know that this isn’t supposed to happen. My visions tell me so.”
His breath wavered when the train shrieked to a stop. As soon as he stepped outside that door, he was going to be faced with his father.
"I think you're done as well, dear." Does the universe hate him? He began to walk faster towards the front of the store. Slipping in between other students and witches, he was almost out of the door when he heard a fatal call.
Draco dropped himself back into his seat next to Harry, a lump forming in his throat, and his stomach filling with dread and realization.
Harry. I just thought I finally understood how Harry and I worked. I thought I’d finally understood my place in Harry’s life—and him in mine. His feelings don’t affect that but after what my father has done I can’t even think of letting myself stand beside him least of all having feelings for me still.”
Draco clicked his tongue and crossed his arms. “Please, you’re as bad as me with never saying what’s actually wrong.”
Terry lowered his head and watched Anthony stand beside Luna as she was dazzling some Durmstrang students with her words, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger were dancing once more with Granger’s head resting on Weasley’s shoulder, Michael and Ginny Weasley were sitting by themselves, talking about who knows what (though, Terry was willing to bet that it was Quidditch).
He curled himself in the nook, peering up to the sky to see if he could catch stars alongside the moon.
The sunset was settling the sky into a light peach, pinkening the grounds. A cool breeze made fallen leaves rustle at their ankles. Draco was hugging Harry’s arm, his head tucked under Harry’s cheek to hide from the dropping temperature. With each gust of wind that ruffled their clothes and hair, Draco’s arms tightened. Harry willed the air to chill faster. He closed his eyes to take in the moment, hoping he can stay like this forever.
