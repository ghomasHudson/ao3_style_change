“You want me to put in that Liam and his friends play a life-sized wizards chess game in order to move through the mansion they were stuck in?  And find a key to a locked door from hundreds of flying keys?  Draco, you know those things really happened to Ron, Hermione and me.”
“I need to see if you have any wound on your head.” He slowly ran his hands over the blond head feeling for cuts and bumps.  He found a small superficial cut but didn’t deem it life threatening. As he continued to move his hands through Draco’s hair, Harry was reminded of his Godson Teddy’s hair when he was born.  He’d never felt a baby’s hair before that.  And he’d certainly never felt an adult’s hair as soft as Draco’s. Not even a girl’s hair.  Harry shook the inappropriate thoughts out of his head and resumed his task.
“During your last formal interview, you were quoted as saying, The Malfoys certainly haven’t redeemed themselves completely.  As an Auror, I will make it my business to know the comings and goings of all Death Eaters.  I don’t believe they can be trusted.”  Rita smirked.  “It sounds to me like a bit of a conflict.  How do you justify your relationship if you don’t trust him?”
“You may, Professor Malfoy,” she replied.  “Please place the volumes you wish to set aside here.”  She patted the large desk next to her own.  “And write down the titles.  I’ll put them on a shelf reserved only for your students.”
Without being asked, Draco reached for the lube and reached behind his back to hand it to Harry.  Harry wasted no time putting it to good use.  Within a few minutes, he had himself buried deep within Draco.
The minister began to speak.  “Friends and family, we are here today to celebrate the marriage of these young people.  Of all my duties, the one that gives me the most pleasure is to unite a man and woman as partners in love and life.”
“Floo my office and we’ll set up a time slot,” Ms. Chittock said.  “Although, we’re here together now.  I could use my voice recording quill.”
“Fucking hell, Harry!” Ron shouted as he came out of his dormitory.  “What did you do, let all the leeches out of the potions room?” he joked.
“Stop.” The Gryffindor elbowed his partner and grinned sheepishly.  “I’m scar-head, remember?  Four eyes.”
Friday night, beginning at nine-forty, pupils from the other three Houses began covertly streaming into Slytherin House.  The lower year students were bribed into staying out of the common room during the two hours of party time.
Blaise shook his head. “No.  But we’re too different.  We’re simply enjoying one another’s company.  You and Potter, now you’re two peas in a pod.”
He clapped and bounced up and down on the bed. “Brilliant.  Come with me.”  He held out his hand to Parvati, who took it.  Harper led her into the toilet he shared with his roommates and closed the lid.
“But don’t dare think it’s because you’re not beautiful and wonderful.  I’m telling you, it’s me, Gin.  I just have some things to sort out.”
Meanwhile, Draco gasped, “I’m going to fucking cum again.” And he did, this time on his own chest, with a bit less flourish than the first time.
He kissed Harry, who normally shied away from too much public affection.  Seeing as it was their wedding day, Harry made an exception and kissed him back with enthusiasm.
Draco looked to Harry.  “We know a bit about that ourselves, don’t we.  Well, it looks like the other boys’ loss is your gain, Montague.  I hope this doesn’t mean that you’ll be even more distracted in class.”
“There is a way we can clear all of this up.  Before you have the baby.  A Healer told me it’s possible, if mine and Dean’s magical signatures are different enough.”
“I want to pick her up, but I don’t want to wake her,” Draco squirmed.  “Oh, I don’t care if she wakes up.”
Draco Malfoy screwed up the courage to do something he never thought he would.  He walked up to Hermione Granger as she sat in the library with her friends-- his former enemies.  He cleared his throat, capturing their attention.  Not knowing Draco’s intentions, Harry became slightly nervous.
“Thank you for telling me that,” Draco said.  “I’ve always felt so guilty about that.  And I wondered why he didn’t try to defend himself.”
Draco chuckled. “Who would have thought I’d grow a conscience?  She also reminded me that the right thing wasn’t always easy.”
As glorious as kissing Harry in the kitchen was, Draco was eager to proceed to the bedroom. His erection strained against his trousers so tightly, it was becoming quite uncomfortable.
Harry looked at the mantle clock.  Nearly eleven.  He groaned.  “At least lunch isn’t too far off,” he gave a half-hearted laugh.
When Draco returned to the table, Harry dismissed his earlier notion.  Draco had his life back in order.  He was sophisticated and certainly not lacking for fit admirers.  Why on earth would he want to have anything to do with plain old Harry Potter--who hadn’t even the courage to come out yet?
“Parvati, I didn’t shag Pansy at the party.  Probably the only bloke that didn’t shag her, given the chance.  In fact, I didn’t even go to the party last night.”
“Slowly, my body healed itself and by your fifth birthday, I had come out of it.  My body was healed, for the most part, but my mind and heart were still very much broken.  Learning that I had not only lost your sister, but that I was advised not to bear any more children sent me deep into depression.”
“Yours is the first that’s ever been completely eradicated. I can only guess that when your magic came together, yours,” he pointed to Harry, “must have sought out the dark magic in the Mark and drove it out.”
Reluctantly, Draco climbed into the small seat in the train when it was their turn.  The ride operator lowered the restraints and made sure they were buckled in safely.
“Thank you, by the way.” He glanced quickly at Harry. “For helping me home this morning. And the tea.”
“It’s got to be Blaise.  I owled him of our engagement, but I haven’t told him the date yet either.”
Pansy, however, remained with her legs spread on the desk.  “Harry Potter, are you a pouf?” she smirked.
Back at his cauldron, Harry made his potion along with Ron, who sat next to him.  It wasn’t a challenge day, so the atmosphere was more relaxed.  The boys chatted about all sorts of things, as most pairs did.  Every so often, Harry’s gaze traveled to the blond head two tables in front of him and to the right.  More than once, he thought he saw Draco looking back at him out of the corner of his eye.
Licking his lips, Draco pointed his wand and bound Harry’s hands to the head board.  He went to place his wand on the bedside table.
“That’s such good news, Ron,” Harry said, giving him a few pats on the shoulder.  “I’m sure you feel so much better now.”
“I really don’t know.  He didn’t tell me,” Draco told him.  “Believe me, if I could do something to protect my mother, I would. Even if it meant ruining Father’s deal.”
“All right,” the waitress winked.  “Give me a minute to get that couple moving.  They’ve been there forever.” She rolled her eyes.
Several of their guests came up to give their congratulations on a lovely wedding, and elegant party.  The Parkinsons and the Clayworths both told them their house elves had outdone themselves.  Lucius was happy to leave it at that, but Narcissa insisted on giving the Weasleys and Grangers their due credit.
“A Dark item released a powerful spell when they tried to open it.  Arthur wasn’t even supposed to be there, but one of the Auror’s was convinced it was as simple muggle device and called him to help.”
Hanging back near the refreshment table, Harry spoke to some of the other professors, and occasionally students who came to quench their thirst.  It was quite a different experience from the first dance. No longer jealous of the students, but rather pitying them for their youth, Harry was confident that he and Draco belonged together.
A third finger slipped inside Harry, making him groan.  The warmth of the water along with Draco’s ministrations was relaxing after the harrowing ordeal of babysitting.  He was slow to harden, but they had all the time in the world.
“They knew each other as children,” Harry explained.  “And then at Hogwarts.  He’d been in love with her forever.  I saw his memories of her.”
Draco and Harry were not the only pair to be repeated.  Parvati chose Michael’s wand, and Millicent chose Justin Finch-Fletchley, the boy who always seemed to be called by his full name, even though there were no other boys named Justin.  In addition, Pansy was paired with Theo, Blaise with Harper, Ginny with Dean, Astoria with Neville, Ernie with Luna, Tracey with Anthony, Susan with Romilda, and Padma with Lavender. Three of the four latter girls were displeased with the outcome.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. “We should make it a point to get together more often.  I’ve been trying to encourage Draco to spend more time with Blaise and Pansy.”
It was as much of a confession as the poor boy could get out.  Pansy shot a look to Blaise and subtly waved for him to stand as well.  She saw him mouth something to Harper and the pair of them stood.  Slowly, throughout the hall, several other students stood.
Draco also dropped to his knees, overwhelmed by Harry’s proposal.  “Yes,” he choked out.  “Fuck, yes.”
Against his better judgement, Harry agreed.  “I’ll give you another chance.  But I’m telling you, we’re friends and nothing more.”
“I’ve only dated muggle men,” Harry confessed.  “They don’t go blabbing to Rita Skeeter when things turn sour.”
“I want you to make peace with him.  When you say that you support him, I want you to mean it.  Not just as part of a deal.  I want you to accept our relationship for what it is.”
“What shall we do the rest of the night?” Draco asked, leaving Harry to wonder if he was serious about the wanking.
“And then we find out he’s not a man at all.  He’s Malfoy’s bitch.  The world needed to know.  I just can’t believe you had the nerve to stay here once word got out.”
Another slow song began and students flocked to the punch bowl.  Harry moved out of the way to avoid them.  Draco walked up and took Harry’s cup from him, downing it in one gulp.  He flipped his fringe out of his face, and Harry’s heart skipped a beat.  He liked the new style, he decided.  The spiky, long fringe and shorter layers in the back gave him an almost anime appearance.
Now Harry was simply puzzled.  He was almost certain Draco was going to tell him he had been unfaithful, or something similar.  “What about it?”
Draco’s chin quivered a moment.  “I only wanted you to love me as much . . .” He had difficulty getting the words out. “As much as I . . . love you.” He didn’t make any attempt to hide his tears.
When she walked into the Great Hall, Romilda Vane tried to cover her face.  She had combed her hair in an attempt to cover her forehead and even considered cutting fringe to hide it.  She glared at Susan Bones as she walked past the Hufflepuff table. A group of them giggled.
“It’s not really much of a story.  It was at a wedding.  I had just turned eleven.  A few weeks before coming to Hogwarts.  My mother noticed that I wasn’t socializing and she encouraged me to dance with the other children.  I did, reluctantly.  But then the music slowed down and we all just sort of looked at each other.  The adults began pairing together or walking off the dance floor.  I heard someone ask me if I wanted to dance.  She was a pretty girl a little older than me.  We danced, very awkwardly I might add.  At the end of the song, she led me to the balcony.”
The portrait swung open and they stepped through.  No one else was there.  Though he missed Hermione and Ron, Harry was happy to have the common room to himself and Draco. He sat down by the fireplace and began pulling aside gifts for Draco.
“Forgot to leave a light on,” Draco mumbled as he took out his wand to cast a few Incendios on the candle sconces about the room.
“I believe this calls for a celebration,” Hermione said.  “We were planning to go out anyway.  Let’s make it a foursome.”
Harry was surprised by her words.  He thought she would have advised them to be themselves and not care about the wizarding world.
Hermione and the Ministry escort she brought with her each took hold of one of Lucius’ arms.  The three apparated to the Manor.  Their sudden appearance startled Ron, who had been heavily engrossed in conversation with another Auror.
Draco smirked.  Harry was right.  He was bollocks at dancing.  But the way he jealously protected what he considered his, turned Draco on.
“Stay out of it, Harry,” Ron warned.  “This doesn’t concern you.  Especially in light of recent events.”
“I see. It seems to be taking a toll on you.  There is a chemical imbalance in your brain. Not uncommon for people in your line of business.  Only mild melancholia, but it could lead to a deep depression if not treated.” The Healer took out his pad and quill to write down a potion for Harry to pick up. “Did you lose someone on this mission?”
“Draco will want children. I want very much to be a father.  I know who the other will be.” He drew a deep breath and let it out, frustrated.  “Yes, you said that before.  But I
“Oh, fuck, Harry.  I’m gonna cum already,” the Slytherin said breathlessly.  The motions of their lovemaking continued for only another few seconds or so, then Draco threw his head back, and let out several loud groans as he came onto Harry’s chest.  Normally, Draco wasn’t as vocal as Harry, and the brunet enjoyed hearing the pleasured cries.  As the tension left Draco’s body and he came to his senses, he noticed Harry simply staring up at him.
“Seriously,” Draco said. “Any time you want.  I thought I was doing you a favor because I never liked to bottom particularly.  But that was so different from any other time.”
The others clinked glasses with him and one another and drank.  The food and drink began to disappear suddenly.
When they stopped, Draco quickly unzipped the fly of Harry jeans and popped the button.  He slipped his hand inside. Harry groaned when Draco’s fingers wrapped around his half hard cock.
Now that he was there, after two in the morning, Harry was second guessing his plan. He silently pushed open the door. The small night light over the bed was enough for Harry to confirm that it was Draco in the bed. His right leg hung in a sling attached to the ceiling, the ankle bandaged to a splint. Though the blond appeared to be sleeping, his face showed signs of distress.
Draco opened his legs wide, silently inviting Harry in. Succumbing to the provocation, Harry prodded the tight hole of Draco’s arse with the leaking head of his penis. Extending his hand out, Draco grabbed a hold of Harry and guided him in.
Lucius approached the pair.  “I’ve done all I can from the outside.  I think I may be able to get one of you through as a side along.  But to remove it completely, I’ll have to go in.”
Gloves and shoes came off next, followed by jerseys and trousers, with Draco slightly in the lead.  When he was completely nude, he stepped toward Harry to help with his trousers and pants, which were the last to go.
“Oh, I didn’t know there was such a service,” Draco said, then grinned.  “I can’t believe they’re going to publish your book.”
“And what do you have to be jealous of?” she questioned.  She meant it to be a light hearted query.  She couldn’t image that he would be jealous of anyone. He was rich, handsome and dating the most famous wizard of their generation.
Draco nodded. Now all he had to do was convince Harry’s friends to all switch partners.  Piece of cake.
Something about their chat was off, but Hermione couldn’t put her finger on it. “Ron, I know you’re curious, but maybe you should just let Harry have his secrets for a while.  He’ll share them when he’s ready.”
Harry moaned and leaned into the hand, begging for more friction.  Draco moved his hand inside Harry’s pants and the skin on skin contact was almost too much for Harry.  His moans were muffled by Draco’s mouth.
After looking over the menu, Harry decided to try the sole, with green beans amandine. Althea ordered the same.  They also ordered a bottle of wine, recommended by the waiter.  Harry and Althea nibbled on crusty rolls and carried on conversation while they waited for their meal.
Anxious to hear about the new project, most students arrived early to Slughorn’s class.  Hermione sat down next to Ginny.
“Wait,” Ron couldn’t believe he was actually going to try and have a real conversation with Malfoy.  “She probably would. The second-hand shop, you said?”
Harry could fell himself flush.  The young man to whom Althea was referring got up from his table with his party to leave the restaurant.  As he did, he glanced back at Harry and smiled.  Normally, Harry would have taken that as an invitation to follow.  If he hadn’t been with Miss Bridgewater, he just may have.
Ron stood, looming over the reporter.  “Since when is being gay a scandal?  You print one word harming Harry in any way, the Ministry will come down on you so hard, you’ll never crawl back out.”
“It’s all right.  If the information he gives is useful, he’ll be out soon enough.”  Draco patted his chest.  “Come on.  Lean back.  What book have you got today?”
“Tough,” Draco grinned.  He suddenly pounced on Harry and pinned him down, sucking hard on the side of his neck.  He only released Harry when he was confident he left a dark enough mark to embarrass Ron.
“Don’t apologize,” Draco said gently.  “I got ahead of myself.  We should probably be discreet anyway.  The last thing we need is for rumors to get started.”
“You were so independent, we didn’t think . . . you were just trying to be a good boy.  We thought you didn’t need us.”
Harry sat behind his desk, blinking, unable to move or make sense of what was going on.  Draco took pity on him and helped him out.
“We ought to get going,” Draco suggested.  “I may not know anything about babies, but I know exhausted parents when I see them.  We should let Ginny rest.”
“Oh, right. So, we were coming back into the castle when we see Thomas flailing his arms frantically and shouting down the hall.”
“I didn’t care for the Potions training. That’s no secret. But you’ll have no trouble with Potions. You never did,” Harry smiled. “Oh, speaking of potions, you’re due for one.”
Ron nodded.  “I only hope our kids look like her, though.  We’ve got enough gingers in this family.”
“Oh.”  Though Harry sounded a bit disappointed, he thought Draco’s gesture was very sweet.  “By the way, Hermione owled.  They want to get together this weekend.  Do you have plans?”
“Wait,” Ron stopped them. “Take another wand.” He held his out to Lucius.  “Give Hermione’s back to her.  She needs to be able to defend herself if that lunatic Greyback is still wandering around in there.”
For the remainder of the year, Draco split his mealtimes between the Slytherin and Gryffindor tables, without complaint from anyone.  Including Terry Boot, whom they discovered had been expelled from Hogwarts.  It seemed Harry and Draco were not the only recipients of his prejudice.  Susan Bones and Stewart Ackerly had both made complaints about Boot harassing them.  Boot’s threat against Draco outside the Great Hall had merely been the last straw.
A waitress came by to seat them at a table, breaking the melancholy mood they had fallen into.  She led them to a corner booth with a candle on it.  Harry thought it would have been very romantic if it had been a date.  And if there weren’t a bunch of rowdy drunk wizards singing loudly in another corner.
“She wants me to sow my wild oats so when the time comes, I’ll marry Astoria and be content.”  Draco laughed humorlessly.  “Daphne refused.  She said it was too awkward that we both jerked you off.  She doesn’t like to share. Me, that is.”
“I want to make everyone jealous,” Harry said.  “Except Ron and Hermione.  I feel badly that they can’t take a holiday this year.  But with Rose still so little, it would be more work than a holiday.  At least we won’t have to worry about that.”
“I didn’t have any claim on you, or her.  Especially at that time. I couldn’t justify being angry with either one of you when I could scarcely admit to myself that I fancied you.”
“Me.  I fucked it up.  Again.  Maybe I’m just not meant to be in any type of relationship.”  He rubbed his face and yawned loudly.  “What’s wrong with me?”
It took Draco several hours to put the potions ingredients in the cupboard in an order to his liking.  He made notes on which items were running low or were unusable.  McGonagall told him she would order whatever supplies he needed straightaway.
“We were falling asleep in the middle of reading more than we were shagging,” Harry laughed.  “I figured a change of reading material was in order.”
Reading the diary had been one of the most profoundly intimate activities he’d ever engaged in that wasn’t actually sexual in nature.  And he shared it with Draco Malfoy of all people.  In the moment before Draco opened his big mouth, Harry felt a deep connection to the Slytherin.
“You’ve seen it.  It’s not the same as it was.  We can get married in the garden,” Draco said.  “Mother is already planning to have new rose bushes planted.”
“That’s because you don’t really know each other,” Harry said.  “He’s a great flyer.  You two could practice Quidditch together.”
“You look great.  It’s about time you started dressing like the rest of us.  Let’s go,” Harry said before the compliment could register in Draco’s mind.
Draco smirked and sat down, across from Harry with the spread between them.  It was somewhat dark in the Tower, so Harry peeked into the basket.  He didn’t ask for them, but he thought he had seen candles inside.  He took out a fat one with two wicks and put it on the stone floor, away from the flammable blanket.
Bill picked up a plate to help Victoire choose some treats, while Harry loaded up a plate for Draco and himself to share.  Draco didn’t have much of a sweet tooth, but Molly had made a cinnamon crumb cake he thought Draco would like.
McGonagall sighed.  “If it will make you feel better, I’ll put in a floo call to Arthur.” Leaving Draco to wait by himself outside her chambers, the Headmistress contacted the Weasleys through the floo network.  They had assured her that Harry was indeed safe and that the day had been uneventful.  She hadn’t mentioned Draco’s theory, not wanting to alarm the family unnecessarily.
Ron’s eyebrows raised.  “Really.  I can’t imagine her apologizing to anyone.” It suddenly occurred to Ron that Harry said the date didn’t go well.  “Wait, so you said you messed it up already?  What did you do?”  He wasn’t all that sure he wanted to know any details.  In fact, he definitely didn’t want any details.  But they’d always talked about everything, so he asked.
“There was nothing to say.  They’re perfect.  And they’re just as much mine, like this little one.  But we can’t keep calling her the baby.”
“No, but we’ve been talking about it. Owen is four years older than me.  He said he’s ready to settle down.  And he loves my family.”
“Only because you wanted to make me happy,” Draco pointed out. “However, in the long run, you probably would have become resentful.”  He held up his hand to keep Harry from interrupting. “I know you don’t think so now. But, my love, how can we make each other happy if we’re unhappy ourselves?”
Harry was happy things worked out the way they had.  Ginny and Dean were truly a good match.  As anxious as he was to find out about his future children, he was thankful the baby was Dean’s.  It would have been a complicated life, sharing a child with another family, no matter how close friends.
It was a story about a baby dragon who got separated from his mother and set off to find her.  The words were simple, but the illustrations were remarkable.  The dragon’s wings sparkled and were raised from the surface of the page. Draco gently ghosted his fingers over the image on the cover. Dominique mimicked him with her chubby fingers.  He’d almost forgotten that the toddler was sitting next to him.
“It was the right thing to do.”  Harry immediately felt a strange force, an unseen pressure to continue.
A quick glance over at Ron and Hermione told Draco they had been watching him as well.  While Hermione seemed to actually enjoy the show, Ron looked a bit ill.
Knox grinned to himself as the Headmistress left the Great Hall.  He didn’t have any more classes that afternoon, and he knew just how he wanted to spend it.
“I had always suspected I was different from other boys.  But it wasn’t until my first kiss that I knew for certain.  I suppose I should say, my first almost kiss.”
He repeated the order when Draco hesitated.  Harry held his arms out in front of him, high enough for Draco to easily capture.
“I read a book.  He read the Prophet. It was very quiet.  And boring.  But I gather it was better than some couples had.”
“Wait,” Cornfoot called out. “We were only trying to break you two up.  You don’t think anything is really going to happen to Harry, do you?”
She leaned over to hug her friend.  He half-heartedly returned it, still a tiny bit annoyed at her playing of devil’s advocate.
“To tell the truth, I rather like it this way,” Draco admitted. “Your mother can concentrate on celebrating their birthday instead of mine.”
Ever the voice of reason, Hermione suggested they set up new wards around the grounds.  Obviously, the Death Eaters were after Harry, and more may return when they learn of the failed attempt.  She went outside and set about the task of preventing apparating and disapparating, along with Protego horribilus. She wasn’t taking any chances with Harry’s life, or Ron’s.
“Why do you keep asking me?” Draco questioned.  “Have I given you reason to think I don’t want to go?”
Hermione looked at Draco as he lay on the floor, half dressed.  “He was in shock, wasn’t he?  You used muggle methods to keep him warm?”
Ron raised his hand.  “Mine,” his voice cracked.  He cleared his throat and tried again.  “Mine,” he said with a bit more authority.  A huge smile broke out on Lavender’s face.  A scowl formed on Hermione’s.
“A little late for that.”  It suddenly occurred to Harry that perhaps it wasn’t for him that Draco was creating an out.  A deathbed confession never holds up in court.  Why should it hold up now?
“Nobody does the binding ceremony anymore,” Molly groused.  “It’s too easy to get a divorce nowadays if you ask me.  Even our generation, only about half of couples opted for binding.”
“I can’t read the science of biology in a crystal ball. So I can’t answer that. But these are not someone else’s children that you love or are attached to.  In this vision, you think of these two children as your
“Where is it?  I can get to Hogsmeade through it?  Are there charms I need to know?”  Draco was very anxious for the information.  He wanted to get to Harry right away.  He had a bad feeling, even though he didn’t sense any danger through their connection.  It was a comforting feeling and Draco wondered why wizards no longer wanted to be joined.
“Well,” Hermione began, inspecting the injury closely.  “It only looks bruised.  But are you sure you don’t want to go see Madame Pomfrey?”
“And her name was Lily?  But she died when--” Draco cut himself off, realizing it may be a sensitive subject for Harry.
Tossing the pins back into the box, Draco leaned forward, capturing Harry’s lips in a fever he hadn’t felt with anyone else. Harry released the watch he had been holding and ran his fingers through the silken tresses tickling his cheek.
Draco raised his hand at the gate.  It took on an ethereal appearance as he stepped through.  It became solid though, once he crossed the threshold.  Harry remained on the other side, hand still joined with Draco’s through an opening in the wrought iron design.
Now all he had to do was get Harry alone so he could tell him about the encounter he’d just witnessed.  Surely, it would be enough to make Harry see that Draco was still just a low life Death Eater, preying on a young boy.  He was no good for Harry.  Knox had to play it right, though.  As the messenger, he didn’t want to get hexed for his troubles.
“I can’t believe I made you feel that way.” Harry closed his eyes.  “I was so angry about what happened, mainly with myself.  I tried to lay the blame on Knox, but it was really all my fault.”
“Nobody asked you,” Ron mumbled.  Then he realized that Malfoy was agreeing with him.  It gave him an idea. “Er, yeah, we could go check out Obscurus Books, and maybe stop in to see Georgie.”
Harry smiled.  “How do you read me so well?  And I know I’m no longer an Auror. I wish there was a way to help him without getting too involved.”
“Oh.  I see.  Then it seems that my branch of the family tree comes down to Teddy.”  She picked up her tea and sipped delicately.
“I don’t know.  I feel like it lessens what Mione and I have by everyone else jumping into commitments they’re not ready to make.”
“I forgive you.” Coming from anyone else, the words would have sounded arrogant. But under the circumstances, forgiveness was exactly what Lucius needed.  “If you’ll forgive me.  I know I’ve said and done things to hurt you. Some of them purposefully.”
“Technically, you know I can’t tell you,” Ron said.  He glanced around.  “But if you just happen to be there when I take my witness into custody . . .”
“Mother has had to learn to lower her standards a bit since the war.  I suppose she’ll have to lower them a little more.”
“I am truly sorry about that part.  I wish she hadn’t brought that up.  Please believe me, the rest of the interview went much better.”
The professor walked back to an alcove, out of Harry’s sight for a moment, then returned with a small box.  She placed it on her desk and opened the lid.
“You made your potion on your own.  You can thank yourself,” Draco replied.  When the boy hesitated, Draco prodded.  “Was there something else?”
“Of course, she will,” Harry said.  He knelt in front of Ron, giving him as much of a hug as the odd position would allow.
“Mr. Malfoy, if you’re going to use me as a bargaining chip, then I think I have the right to speak my mind,” Harry returned.
“Yeah, oh, fuck, yeah,” he mindlessly murmured.  The bed post banged against the wall as Harry pushed more frantically.  If he could have gotten his entire being inside Draco, he would have.  Draco grimaced occasionally, but didn’t complain, still forcefully tugging his own cock.  It wouldn’t be long before it was over, and the pain accompanying Harry’s momentum was filled with enough pleasure for him to endure.
As she continued to remove Ron’s trousers, Hermione reminded him, “There’s more to marriage than shagging.  You know that, right?”
During the Christmas holiday, Harry and Draco split their time between Malfoy Manor and The Burrow.  The difference in households was night and day.  While they had tea by the fire in the Manor with Narcissa and Lucius, they had lively debates and raucous card games with the Weasley siblings.
“I don’t prefer him.  For Merlin’s sake, would you listen to me?  I came here to tell you what happened and that I’m sorry.”  Harry’s voice grew louder.  “I’m tired of fighting with you about him.  I’m so tired of fighting, period.”
“Not if you ask her to switch. Tell her you and Ron really want to partner up.  She’ll understand.  Draco and Blaise are going to have some sort of argument, leaving them both looking for partners.”
Draco sat staring into his salad.  He slammed his fist on the table, then got up and went to the loo.
“What’s the matter with you, Potter?” Draco teased.  “You look like a kid on Christmas.” He winked at Harry.
“Oh,” Hermione sat up straighter.  “Are you saying you really did have feelings for Harry back during the war?”
Hermione put her arm around Harry’s shoulder.  “It sounds like you’re feeling insecure.  I think your dreams are simply a manifestation of your fears.  Don’t give in to them.  What does your heart tell you?”
“We’ll see,” Harry said.  “If you’ll excuse me, I think I’m going to change my shirt before we go to Hogsmeade.” He tugged at the collar.  “This one is getting too small or something.”
She nodded. “We let you down. And it’s caused the animosity between you and your father all these years, along with your need to prove yourself, the demands you’ve made of him, and his willingness to spoil you.  I can almost see that there are two sides to you; the independent man who has hardened himself, and the child still seeking approval.”
“However, if your records were thorough,” Draco continued.  “You would see that the name registered for those hotels is not Lucius Malfoy, but rather Draco.”
Not certain what to do first, Draco held out the book to her.  She glanced at it curiously, then peered at him over her glasses.
Taking Harry’s hand, Draco led him to the bedroom and gently nudged him down onto the bed.  First, he removed Harry’s shoes, the way he had the night Harry got too pissed to do it himself.  Then he removed his own.  He lay down, scooping Harry close to his body, and wedging a knee between Harry’s legs.
“My dear boy, you really are naive if you think you’re the first person to tell me to fuck off. Professor Snape used to say it to me regularly.  Of course, I got my own digs in with him.  He was just a prick when it came to following my rules around here.”
Harry sighed.  “I know Mione means well, but I think I can choose my own company.  I wish she’d just leave it.”
“Would you mind taking this sandwich back to Ron for me?” Hermione asked.  “I’ll take this one to Draco and relieve him of Rose duty,” she chuckled. “He’s been with her for nearly three hours, the poor thing.”
Ron scowled.  Nott’s reputation was legendary and Ron’s distaste for Malfoy went without saying.  “You wouldn’t.”
“He didn’t say,” Harry frowned.  That thought hadn’t occurred to him.  But surely the Healer would have mentioned it.  “Of course, we’d only do it if it were safe.”
“If you need anything, you can call for Clara. Or Wort. But I don’t recommend him, he’s rather grumpy.”
Harry was quick to answer, “All right.”  He didn’t want the evening to end, even if it was all in his head. They continued up to the sixth floor.
, a smut magazine featuring large breasted witches in compromising positions. He paused briefly to acknowledge the pair.
While the Weasleys gathered near the Healer to hear about the baby’s health, Harry made his way over to Dean and his parents. Loath to interrupt, he waited patiently for them to part.  Draco appeared by Harry’s side as Dean’s parents went to greet the Weasleys.
The corner of Draco’s mouth rose, giving him the appearance of a boy just handed all the goodies off the Hogwarts Express tea trolley.  Harry thought either that, or a Hungarian Horntail about to devour him.
“Oh, but Harry,” Slughorn’s expression became serious.  “Take care.  You don’t want to end up like Mr. Malfoy.”
Harry slammed himself down onto Draco over and over.  His head fell back, and his mouth gaped open.  The bed creaked loudly, leading Draco to briefly wonder if anyone could hear them.  The thought was quickly dismissed when Harry’s moaning became louder and higher.  After having pleasured Harry with his hand or mouth many times, Draco knew well the sound that signaled his lover’s imminent orgasm.  He pumped his hand hurriedly.
“Please forgive my forwardness,” Althea smiled sympathetically.  “I didn’t intend to embarrass you.  The polite thing to do would have been to keep my observations to myself, thank you for a lovely evening, then tell Hermione it just didn’t work out.”
“Be with any more girls,” Harry answered.  “I only want you. I . . . yeah, I only want you.”  He turned and kissed the side of Draco’s head.  Draco lifted his face up to Harry’s.
“But nobody can prove it. And besides, if and when I do tell my family, how can I bring home such a flamer?”
“Do you want to spend the day together?  Just the two of us?”  He glanced down at his bare left arm.  “We have some catching up to do.”
“Please have a seat before the food is gone,” she motioned for him to take the empty seat next to her. Professor Flitwick nodded politely at him, while Sibyll Trelawney, on the other side of Flitwick, smiled vacantly at him as if she hadn’t recognized him at all.
It was difficult to tell who many of the party guests were.  Some students were so completely hidden by their costumes, it was hard to distinguish if the wearer was a boy or a girl.  Others barely took care to disguise themselves at all.
Blaise didn’t miss a beat and called for the next number. Justin Finch-Fletchley eagerly stepped forward.  He drew Millicent Bulstrode’s wand, and neither looked particularly pleased.  The wand choosing went quickly after that.  Padma drew Theo’s wand,          Michael Corner drew Parvati’s, and Dean drew Romilda’s.  All of them appeared anxious, but not altogether displeased with their choices. However, when Anthony withdrew Ernie MacMillan’s wand, Ernie protested, to say the least.
“We’ve stopped the bleeding,” the healer said. “And we’re giving him blood replenishing potion.  I’d like to keep him here overnight, and possibly tomorrow night as well.  But he’s going to be fine.”
Draco unbuttoned his own trousers, revealing a bit of lacy pink fabric.  “I sort of took the liberty.”
Although Hermione agreed with them both, she had an odd feeling about the whole situation.  Her gaze subconsciously traveled to the Slytherin table.  Malfoy was talking and smiling with Pansy and Blaise, and some other boy she didn’t know.  Hermione had to admit, Malfoy was rather handsome.  Harry was right about that.  Could it possibly be?  Was there any chance the blond thought the same of Harry?
“I didn’t really have toys myself,” Harry said.  “Once in a while, when Dudley was very bored, he would play a game with me.  Of course, I always had to let him win or he would toss the board and make me clean it up.”
“May I also be frank?” Harry questioned.  He continued when she nodded.  “All that you think you know of me, most likely comes from books, newspaper articles written by Rita Skeeter, or legend.  Some of which is true.  But much of it is exaggerated, or out and out lies.”
Harry looked away, uncomfortable with the compliment.  Draco pulled Harry’s chin, forcing him to look up.
“Harry, please don’t do this.  I’ll go, if that’s what you want.  But don’t give up teaching because of me.”
Harry and Draco both leaned over their newly completed potion and breathed in.  Harry laughed at the scent.
“Yes, I suppose I might feel differently if it were my own mother’s attributes that were being compared to a blushing rosebud,” Draco snickered. “But actually, I was more specifically referring to the later entries. Some of them were about you.”
Nott glanced around the room.  “You know, since we placed our wands in the cauldron, it’s an official wand party.  We’re basically magically sealed in until midnight.”
“He’s here,” Draco simply said.  “The wards were disturbed.  And I can feel my Mark calling to his.”
“Yeah, I guess you don’t really need it.  Why work at all?” Ron asked.  “If I had all your money, I wouldn’t work.”
“He was two years behind us.  I don’t even know how he made it into Slytherin.  You must remember him.  Back then, he looked a bit like me.”
“What about all the stuff in it?” Ron questioned. “I mean all the stuff that’s not dark or stolen or illegal,” he said sheepishly. “There were some beautiful paintings. Probably valuable too.”
“Well, I’d been passed over a couple of times because of an old witch’s tale. It claims that squibs are more likely to come from muggle borns.”
“Where are my manners?” Lucius asked sarcastically.  “Please sit.”  He gestured as he would a guest in his home.
“It’s pretty late.  We ought to go to sleep.”  He bent down to retrieve the clothes he threw off in a hurry earlier.  “Is it all right if we stay here?”
They walked slowly toward the altar, past guests seated on either side of them.  When they reached the end, Hermione turned toward Ron.  He stared with his mouth open.
“Only the ones I have over again,” Harry said.  “I figure those are the only ones that are sort of playing out in real life.” He grinned. “Although, I do have one where I’m being fucked senseless by this gorgeous blond.”
Boot could only nod his agreement.  Draco waved his wand, releasing Terry from his pain. He retracted the jinx on Stephen as well. The two pairs glared at each other.
Ron sheepishly nodded.  He had wished over the years not to have so many siblings taking up space or resources in their home.  He had been embarrassed by hand me down clothing and wands, and had been secretly envious of Draco, though, he would never have admitted it.  He was surprised that the Slytherin all but admitted he had been jealous of Ron.
“A boy,” Draco smiled.  Since they already had a boy and a girl, the gender of this one didn’t matter much.  However, Draco had hoped for another daughter.  Lily had always loved her dolls so, and wished they were real little sisters.  He supposed she would be just as happy mothering a little brother.  Or bossing him around.
“There’s nothing to handle.  I was drunk.  It was a game. That’s all.  I just needed to tell someone.  And now that I have, it sounds ridiculous.  Of course I’m not attracted to Malfoy.  I mean, just last week Daphne Greengrass and I practically shagged right outside here.  And I was with Ginny for a while.”  Harry seemed to be talking at double speed.
“Tell anybody what?” She winked.  “But you’ll have to leave Mr. Potter.  I need to check on Mr. Malfoy.  And he needs his rest.”
“Oh, fuck,” he said out loud to himself.  “What was I thinking, making plans with Weasley on a Friday night?”
Malfoy stood and trained Ron’s wand on him.  Harry made no move to protect himself.  His guilt prevented it.  Hermione, however, poised to take the elder Malfoy out if necessary.
They moved together, in perfect sync. Not that they normally didn’t, but this time felt different to Harry, besides the obvious.  Not just lust. There was no uncertainty, no holding back.  He gave Draco everything he had.  And took everything Draco had to give.  Harry felt powerful and desirable and loved.  He wanted to feel that way for the rest of his life.
“Darling, your son is brilliant,” Lucius said as he sat down.  “He brewed the potion in half the time it normally takes.  And I’ll wager it works better too,” Lucius gushed.
“That’s not necessary.  There are Aurors on rotating duty keeping an eye on her.  Plus, the wards around the manor have been fortified,” Ron informed him.
“Yes.  We’re all set.  First, one night at the Charly Hotel in Milan, then three days at Electra Palace for a bit of art and culture in Athens.  And finally, four days at the Myconian Ambassador for fun and sun,” Draco grinned.
Harry braced himself on his arms and pulled his hips back, then thrust forward.  He repeated his movements and fell quickly into rhythm, with Draco countering his thrusts.
Harry reached out and stroked the cock bouncing teasingly in front of him.  The moans Draco made turned into whines, becoming louder and higher in pitch as his pace increased.
Draco nodded and looked over the spread on the table. “She must love you a lot.”  He blushed at the ensuing laughter at his innocent comment.
“And then what?  So much has been taken from us.  Lost time, items of great value, respect in the Pureblood community.”
He heard voices coming from the drawing room.  Hermione walked into the kitchen and gave Harry a huge smile.
“That’s how you get the love in there,” George said.  “Mum puts it in everything she does,” he told Draco.
Draco smirked.  “I don’t really like anyone,” he winked. “But you’ve grown on me.  And I think you’re good for Blaise, in a way.”
“I don’t think I’ve ever known someone so cocky and yet so insecure at the same time,” Harry smirked.
Biting his bottom lip, Justin began to rub slow circles over his trouser covered penis.  It didn’t take long for him to harden and become uncomfortable within the confines of those trousers.  He carefully and gradually unzipped the fly part way, hoping Millicent didn’t hear the quiet but distinct sound.  He kept his eyes on Millicent’s face as he reached inside his pants and wrapped his fingers around his cock.  He never realized how difficult it was not to make any sounds while masturbating.  He was also now realizing that his roommates most likely knew whenever he was doing it.
“Things should have been so different.  We love you very much.  You should have felt that every day.”
Hands found their way into the thick mass of dark hair following its movements back and forth.  Draco began to thrust his hips in counter rhythm to Harry’s.  He lasted longer than Harry, but not much, giving him a warning. Harry responded by sucking harder and speeding up his actions.
Looking down at his fidgeting fingers, Draco finally confessed, “It’s just that we haven’t missed a Friday night together since that first party.”  He glanced up at Harry.  “I’m just going to miss you tonight.  A
Draco nodded.  “But then, you did the unimaginable.”  He looked at Harry.  “You saved me, when you could have gotten rid of me forever.  I guess that was when I saw what a truly amazing person you are.”  He focused on Hermione.  “Whatever happened to me and my family, I knew Harry needed to win.  So did my mother.”
Sneering, Boot said, “You two are disgusting.  You and all the other queers around here.”  He brushed himself off and marched away, Cornfoot right behind.
Standing in full Quidditch gear, Draco answered, “McGonagall came down to the dungeons to talk to me.  She asked how Casper Montague was doing in Potions.”  He glared at Knox.  “Now I wonder what prompted her to do that.”
The perky clerk blinked.  “Hermione?  Hermione Granger?”  She looked at the pair of boys in front of her.  She hadn’t bothered to look closely before, as she was only interested in making a sale.  She gasped when she made the connection.  “You’re, you’re . . .” she stammered.
Reluctantly, Draco left the room and waited in the hallway.  He supposed it was going to get ugly and Harry didn’t want him to see.  He paced back and forth waiting for Harry to come out.
Parvati giggled.  “I did hear about that.  That shouldn’t have kept you away.” She blushed herself.  “I could have, maybe, helped.”
“I did for my first and second years.  But then my parents got transferred to America for several years so I attended the Alse Young School for Wizards in Connecticut.”
Hugo, Teddy and James sat in the corner with Ginny’s son, Leo, trying to play a game of exploding snap, which they were told had to stop the moment the baby arrived.  Dean and Blaise held a quiet conversation in another corner, no doubt talking business, as Dean and Ginny had just invested in Blaise’s newest winery.  Harper brought Blaise a fresh glass of their newest sparkling wine, curling his hand around Blaise’s waist when it was free. It had taken Blaise four years of an unsatisfying marriage to get up the nerve to confess his feelings to his bride.  Much to his surprise, she not only understood, but she had also given up the love of a good man to follow the path laid out for her.  They parted ways, against their families’ wishes, but remained good friends.  Blaise’s family was much more open minded than he had anticipated, so he immediately sought out Harper, kicking himself for wasting so much time being miserable.
Suddenly he remembered Draco.  Whirling around, Harry found him at the bottom of what was left of the staircase, looking like a rag doll tossed aside by a child. His limbs were at odd angles and his head was turned away from Harry.  There was blood on the floor, but not much, Harry thought thankfully.
Rita sat, uncharacteristically quiet, waiting to see if Harry would continue.  She was about to ask her final follow up question when he spoke again.
“Yes, Missus.”  She winked away, leaving Draco to pour out tea for himself and Narcissa.  He carried a cup to her and sat down on the sofa with his own.
“Well, not so much here in the wizarding world,” she told him. “But muggle best selling books can reach millions of readers. They get translated into several languages. Yes, you could quite well.”
“Something I shouldn’t be afraid of doing,” he whispered back.  “What is it you’d like to know, Ms. Chittock?”
“Yes, but those weekends usually include Friday night and all day Saturday.  We’ve only had last night and today.”
“Not implying, saying. Draco was caught up in his family’s involvement but his loyalty did not lie with Voldemort.  I have gotten to know Draco on a personal level, far removed from the duress of war.  The kindness, friendship and affection he has shown me has touched me deeply.  And I love him for it.”
She laughed.  “Why are you so insistent?  Let me rest a while.  You don’t want me to be too full, do you?” Hermione leaned in a little closer to Ron.
Draco turned on his heel and headed for the Eighth Year boys dormitory, stripping as he walked.  Following behind, Harry added to the trail of clothing left by his love.
“I was.  And it’s not a bad book.  I’ve only made suggestions on details to add.  And an occasional grammatical mistake.”
After a brief silence, the librarian laughed.  Draco’s eyes sprang open. He had never heard so much a light chuckle escape her lips.  He stood with his mouth gaping, unsure what to make of her reaction.
“I’m afraid Gwenog won’t be joining us this evening,” the professor announced.  “Pity.  I do enjoy her company and you seemed to be looking forward to it, Mr. Malfoy.”
“Turns out he’s not gay, like I thought he was.  Just painfully shy and inexperienced. Well, he was until I got a hold of him.”
“Oh, Mr. Potter. I didn’t realize it was you,” Miss Gwilt bowed her head, slightly flustered. “I’ll . . . just leave Mr. Malfoy’s potion.” She placed it on a small table and swiftly left the room. Being the Chosen One still had its advantages.
“Of course,” Draco strode to him.  “We’ll take it.” He took the parchment and quill and walked to the desk.
“So, did you have another date last night?  I didn’t see you at the party,” Ron beat him to the topic.
“I’ve only gone sledding once or twice.  Dudley would never let me go with him and his friends.  Ron took me, though.”
“Now that’s not true,” Draco assured him. He chuckled a little. “Maybe after your real life adventures, the agents are all jaded. They’re looking for something bigger than life.  You’re a tough act to follow.”
Making a beeline for Harry, Hermione weaved her way through the crowd.  She came upon the pair, kissing again.  For a moment, she watched Malfoy gently caressing Harry’s cheek while peppering him with short, tender kisses.  He pulled back and smiled at Harry in a way she’d never seen him smile.  Actually, she thought him incapable of anything other than a sneering smirk before catching his grin in Potions the previous day.
Someone dressed as a vampire approached Parvati and held out his hand.  She was fairly certain it was a he, anyway.  The vampire bowed to her and stood waiting for a reply to his unasked question.  Tentatively, Parvati took the offered hand, and the boy swept her onto the dance floor.
Draco’s footsteps echoed through the hallway as he ran toward the door.  By the time he’d gotten halfway to the Quidditch Pitch, he could see two figures coming toward him, laughing.
Walking hand in hand, they had almost arrived at breakfast when Knox came walking out.  Subconsciously, Harry let go.
“What?  Why?  And how the hell did you know where to look for me?  And how the bloody hell did you get in?”
“She couldn’t remember any details.  And they were willing to write it off as an accident,” Harry explained.
“Yes?”  Draco appeared genuinely surprised.  The last time he tried kiss Harry, he wasn’t ready.  Draco crawled around the food and sat next to Harry.  He found he was rather nervous himself.
“No, that’s all right.” Draco wiped his nose and tucked his hair behind his ears in an attempt to keep it from Rose’s fingers.  He took a seat on the sofa, speaking to her in melodic tones.
Justin began to get nervous as the midnight hour approached.  He and his mystery girl had been getting on so well, he wished he could always wear a mask.
While Draco looked around for something to wipe up the mess, Harry continued to pat her.  She burped again, and Harry felt warm liquid running down his back.
Draco pulled a small intricate time piece from his pocket.  “It’s almost one.”  He tried and failed to stifle a yawn.
“I wasn’t planning on announcing it until next week, so you’ll have to keep it to yourself.  I imagine you’ll want Miss Granger for your partner.  Big prize at the end.” He nudged Harry’s ribs.
Molly cleared her throat.  “Well, that was unexpected.  Young man, you are not responsible for your family’s actions.  But you are responsible for your own. I can’t imagine anyone among your family prostrating themselves the way you just did.  And of course, you’re forgiven.  I’m not naive enough to think my boys haven’t given you a run for your money over the years,” she smiled.
Harry hesitated, then answered, “I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to get it off my chest.”  He glanced around to make sure no one else was around to hear. “I’m over the moon that Draco and his father have reconciled, don’t get me wrong.  But, now that Draco knows the whole truth, his reasons for not wanting a family aren’t really valid anymore.”
“Harry Potter, don’t you lie to me. I can see that something is bothering you.” She let out a small gasp. “Is the baby all right?”
“Oi, Ron.  When did you get back?” Harry asked as he reached over to the side table for his glasses.
While he doubted that, he had to admit that once he had accepted himself and came out, he did find true love.
The blond perked up and happily escorted his lover through the castle.  In his hurry to get to his dormitory, Harry tripped and fell forward, bringing Draco with him.  Both boys landed on the hard stone floor heavily, slapping their palms to the point of stinging.  Draco’s wrist was scraped open and Harry banged one of his knees hard enough for it to swell immediately.  Harry’s packages flew out in front of him, spilling Liquorice Wands onto the floor.
“What about that fellow from last week?” Harry couldn’t seem to stop asking Draco personal questions.
“Warmer.” Harry felt himself blush as Draco’s breath tickled his cheek when he spoke. Fortunately, Draco’s eyes were closed.
“Do you know how many people have tried to put me on a pedestal, and keep me there?  That’s not where I want to be.  All I’ve ever wanted was a normal life, doing normal things, with normal friends.  It’s why Ron and Hermione are practically my only friends. And you, of course.  I don’t have to live up to any expectations with you, other than being a good boyfriend, which I hope I am.”
He continued to thrust in and out while Draco held on for dear life. The former Slytherin willed himself to relax and enjoy the feel of the soft kisses being bestowed upon him. The pain, though bearable, was distracting. But Draco thought he heard Harry whisper I love you as he suckled on his ear.
As swiftly as he could without appearing to run, Harry left Draco’s new chambers.  He walked briskly down several staircases until finally reaching his own door.  He gave the password and entered.
Blaise knew it was true.  “You’re right.  Sorry, mate.”  He shrugged. “I don’t mean to lock you out.  We just forget to take the charm off before we fall asleep.”  Blaise continued eating through the conversation.
His own had picked up greatly, but the only thing on his menu was Draco.  “Did you forget something?”
“Thank you.  They’re beautiful.”  She bent down to her granddaughter.  “Lily, dear, would you mind giving these to Poppy and asking her to put them in a vase?”
The gift’s arrival had been strategic on Draco’s part.  Ostensibly given to take over some of the overly zealous excitement about the new baby, the kneazle would be a welcome distraction for Lily.  However, even the cat couldn’t compete with a sister, and she dropped the animal as soon as the fireplace began to glow.
Sitting back on his heels, Harry questioned, “What’s the matter?  Why won’t you let me take off your shirt?”  His expression was puzzled.  “Come to think of it, you always leave it on.”
The Interrogator smiled insincerely, “I wasn’t insinuating anything. I was merely pointing out that it was a rather large sum of money.  But . . . now that you mention it, transferring money into your son’s or wife’s account would be a good way to avoid losing your money, should the courts decide it was obtained illegally.”
“Don’t get too far without me,” Harry pouted.  He turned on his side away from Draco, offering up his arse, which Draco gladly took as a substitute for his hip.
“I don’t know,” Neville shrugged.  “I don’t have much experience.  I’ve never asked a girl out. Although I did manage to find the nerve to ask Ginny to the Yule Ball fourth year.”
Draco sighed. “Well, you’re here now. And I’m awake. It must have been important for you to come to the hospital at,” he glanced at the clock, “crikey, two-twelve? Is it my father?”
“Actually . . . it’s fun.  I’ve never done anything like this.  And, if I haven’t ruined it for you, I’d like to stay.  I want you to be happy.”
“Harry,” Draco said, gently pushing him back.  “You need to relax.” He caressed the side of Harry’s face with the back of his hand. “You don’t want to remember our child’s beginnings as a rushed encounter in a sterile office loo, do you?”
Lucius set to his task, concentrating on the pathways his spells needed to follow in order to break the wards down.
Smiling, Draco satisfied her curiosity.  “He kissed my cheek and told me I was adorable.”  He blushed and glanced down at his fidgeting fingers.
“Sh,” Olivia chided.  “Now, Harry, think about your future.  Ask a question in your mind.  Concentrate.”
After reading a particularly sensual and detailed description of his mother, Harry had had enough and left Draco to leaf through the rest of it on his own.  At one point Harry could have sworn there were tears in Draco’s eyes, and was then cursing himself for stopping. Harry swept up the remaining trash and dust from the floor while Draco finished the journal.  He didn’t notice when Draco approached him with the book.
Harry nodded.  “That’s smart.  What are you interested in?” He reached out for the bottle once more.  Draco handed it over.
“Oh Merlin!  I almost forgot,” she laughed.  “The whole reason we wanted to come see you, Harry.”  She held out her left hand for him to see.
Draco bent over and rested his hands on his knees trying to catch his own breath.  “McGonagall took her to St. Mungo’s.  She wants you to contact your family.” He continued to pant.
did it,” Harry corrected.  He raised his hand.  “Professor, we’re finished.  I think it’s right,” he said tentatively.
“Don’t worry, I’ll be quick,” the officiant laughed.  “As a representative of the muggle courts, as well as the Ministry of Magic, it is my honor to perform today’s second ceremony.  Who has Harry’s ring?” he asked.
He spent most of the previous hour thinking about Hermione’s theory.  It was plausible, at the very least.  Not to mention the fact that he’d never really had the time to be an average teenaged boy and consider such mundane things such as a love life.  His hand had been his closest companion until Ginny.  And even then, they hadn’t been overly affectionate.  Perhaps Ginny had been one of those things he did because he thought he was supposed to.  She never stirred in him the same sort of passion that Draco did.  Not that Harry had acted upon it much.  He would have to change that.
Harry raised an eyebrow and lowered his voice.  “And now you’re worried about us doing other things to each other?”
“The boy is auburn haired.  Freckles, but just a sprinkling.  He is taller than the girl.  She is also slightly freckled, but with sandy blond hair.  A bit unruly.  There is a glimmer in her eye.  She’s a feisty one.”
Draco smiled.  “I had more pressing issues.  And I’m mostly healed.  All of my internal injuries have been repaired.  They did that while I was still in stasis. I can feel that the Skelegro has just about completed mending my ribs and my left leg.  There were too many bruises for the bruise paste and my attending assistant gave up,” he laughed.
“Actually, a couple of things.”  Harry picked up a fluted glass and handed it to the Potions professor. “First off, I’ve finished the first draft of my book.  I’ve sent it to Hermione for some editing and critiquing.  Not to mention, she and Ron may recall some details better than I have.”
“You’ll find someone Harry,” Hermione smiled sympathetically.  “In fact, there are a couple of young women I work with that might--”
As he walked to the dungeons, he thought perhaps Harry was right.  It was silly for him to be jealous.  Harry could have had his pick of any wizard he wanted.  Probably a good number of straight ones included.  But he chose Draco.  Knox didn’t have anything particularly special to offer Harry.
Up ahead, they could see heads pressed up against the large glass window.  On the other side was a mediwitch holding up a small swaddled baby with a pink cap.
“Not necessarily,” Draco corrected him.  “Though to some, price is all that matters.  Mother taught me that jewelry should suit the person wearing it, regardless of worth.”
Ginny bit her lip.  She’d feel terribly guilty not telling Harry he could be a father.  But perhaps Dean was right.  Harry may not even want to be a father.  Especially so young.
“No.  I wouldn’t,” Draco admitted.  He hugged Harry to him.  “I’ll do anything I can to help you.  But I think I’ll be more of a hindrance.”
Nodding, Draco replied, “Yes.  The last two potions he made in class were unacceptable.  I’m trying to give him a chance to raise his grade, but . . . “
“Well, I haven’t been.  Not until this year.  And I’m not giving it up for anything. Especially not money.”  Draco paused.  “You could be happy, too.  Truly happy.  If you wanted.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco interrupted Harry’s tirade.  “I didn’t mean to upset you.  I was . . . it was a stupid joke.”
Harry’s eyes followed as Draco made his way back to his room. The pale blue towel hugged his arse just so as he walked, showing off every contour. In a short time, that arse would be Harry’s. His body began respond to that thought and he was glad Draco had gone and closed the door behind him.
“I asked if he speaks French to you when you make love,” Fleur said. “And does it fill you with passion as it does my Bill?”
Sighing, Draco kissed his cheek.  “I want you too.  But . . . my bum is still a bit sore from last night.”
Harry turned to walk away, pulling Draco with him. Draco gave Simon one last scowl before turning in the same direction as Harry.
At first Harry pouted, then laughed as well.  “That was fairly sappy, wasn’t it?  Do you see what you do to me?”  He shoved at Draco’s shoulder with his own in good humor.
“You know, girls are so clingy.  They need you to spend all your time with ‘em.  They like to make plans.”
Harry continued to eat, avoiding Knox’s eyes, which seemed to be constantly looking in Harry’s direction.  The way the man answered McGonagall’s question about his availability made Harry a bit uneasy.  Then he shrugged it off, assuming he was being paranoid.
“Well, I was supposed to help with your essay.  He said he couldn’t find enough information about sopophorous.”
Ginny and Blaise glanced at one another. They didn’t have much choice.  Blaise nodded at Ginny as a sign of approval. She nodded back.
Neither Ginny nor Dean noticed that Harry had walked past on his way to the loo.  He stopped and stood just outside the doorway when he caught a bit of their conversation.
Harry lifted his head and rubbed his eyes. He was about to make excuses for his presence, when he noticed Draco grinning at him. He did the same, and quickly forgot about the Healer’s assistant.
“I, uh . . . I just wanted to take a peek, but then, Anthony went in . . . and I didn’t want to be the only one left out . . .”
It was a relatively tame, yet heartfelt kiss, but the pub got noticeably quieter by the time it was done.  Not everyone had seen, but those who had were quick to inform the rest.
Harry practically skipped all the way back to Gryffindor from the Astronomy Tower.  When he arrived, Ron and Hermione, along with a few others were in the common room.
“Oops,” Draco said unashamedly.  “I’ll help you cover it up.  Later.  I want you to open my present now.”
“I told them to floo call if there was any news about Malfoy.”  Ron got up and moved closer to the hearth.  “What’s going on?”
Harry got up and went to the windowsill.  The same one at which he’d spent so much time in his years at Hogwarts.  It was a good thinking place.  He was thinking about the dream.  The dream he had three times prior.  Or variations of it.  It was slightly different each time.
“Draco and I, sort of, accidentally . . . bound ourselves together.”  Harry winced in anticipation of Ron’s reaction.  It was warranted.
“Ah.  So close.”  Harry closed his mouth around Draco’s cock once again and gave his bollocks a light squeeze. Just as he felt the beginnings of his orgasm, Draco released into his mouth, his cry muffled by Harry’s cock.  He continued to milk Draco until both he and the blond were spent and collapsed, apart.
Feeling the need to explain, so Draco wasn’t embarrassed, Molly said, “Draco helped us peel and cut the potatoes.  He asked why we didn’t use magic to do it. I told him they taste better when you do things by hand.”
“Fuck off,” he muttered as he went past.  He regretted it but couldn’t worry about her feelings at the moment.  He was desperately trying not to cry, going up the staircase to his quarters.
“Me too.  I’ll clean us up, and we can go to sleep.  At least tomorrow is Sunday,” Harry said.  “Are you all right?”
Harry laughed. “Oh, I almost forgot.”  He knelt down on one knee.  “This is definitely for real, Draco. You have to say yes to get the ring, though.  So, will you marry me?”
Draco tenderly attended every inch of Harry’s body until neither could stand the teasing no more. He bent Harry low and moved them forward so Harry could brace his hands against the wall. Taking Harry in quick, hard thrusts, Draco progressed toward his climax swiftly.
True to his word, Draco pulled Harry away the moment the ceremony was over and they had offered their congratulations.  Draco didn’t relax until they were safely tucked away in Harry’s dormitory.  Ron remained at the Burrow with Hermione, Dean was obviously not coming back to live with the other Gryffindors, and Neville had been spending much of his free time in Luna’s common room.  Seamus would most likely return from wherever he was, but not until later.
“Any number of things may have happened to it,” Cummins said.  “It could have transferred to a nearby object. Though it’s unlikely.  It could have simply dispersed with no wizard to carry it.”
“Well, I spent some time here. He’s somewhat of a mentor.  I was in the Slug Club, you know--” Harry cut himself off, thinking he sounded like an arrogant prick.  “I only meant that I became rather close with him.  After Dumbledore, Sirius and Remus were gone, I was a bit lost.  Horace helped me a great deal.”
Harry put his arms over top of Draco’s.  Neither wanted to be trapped under the other and they wrestled for control.
“I was just leaving,” Hermione told him.  She got up and sat down with Ron, who was talking to Harry.  She looked between them as they spoke and wondered about what Ginny said.  Could the boys remain best friends now that Harry was coming to terms with his sexual orientation?
Shaking her head slowly, Minke frowned.  “Master Draco is not well.  Minke has brought Master Draco lunch and supper.  Minke was asked to bring all meals to this room.”
“I know it may be difficult at first,” McGonagall interrupted Harry’s thoughts.  “But I hope you’ll give him a chance.”
“Please,” Draco rolled his eyes.  “You know damn well there was absolutely nothing to that.  And besides, you broke up with him, so he’s fair game.”  Draco gave a sideways glance.
“Because everyone knew it was her most prized possession.  Leaving it behind made her death more believable.  We acquired it just recently when Nell’s childhood home was sold, and the contents auctioned off.”
“Harry, relax,” Draco chuckled.  “This isn’t really any different than going to the Potions classroom.”
“There’s no glamour strong enough to cover up two people having . . . um,” Draco glanced around to see if anyone was paying attention, then lowered his voice further. “In a compromising position.”
“You’re in luck.  She’s due for her menses in three days.” Singleton chuckled at the discomfort on the men’s faces. “We’ll be able to start treatment in about two weeks.  We’ll have you come in to make your deposit, we’ll do our magic in the lab and implant by the beginning of September.”
“Do you think then, that I never really liked girls?  Did I talk myself into that?  This is all so confusing.”
“I’m a pureblood.  It was my job to know these things.  Present a woman with the wrong ring and you’d get a slap on the face rather than a yes, and be a laughing stock.”
Harry and Draco released twin gasps and attempted to look at one another in surprise, but it was too dark.  Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and dragged him as he ran the other way down the corridor.  Harry couldn’t help but giggle at Draco’s panic.
“I haven’t decided yet.  Telling Skeeter about them didn’t seem to do them any harm,” Boot rubbed his jaw.  “I wonder what would hurt the most.”
“How much longer do you think it will be?” Draco asked, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder as they sat in chairs in St. Mungo’s waiting room.
“That’s an understatement.  Uncle Vernon used to say that the only thing worse than a wizard was a woofter.  And a wizard woofter was the worst.”  Harry laughed at his alliteration.  “When Dudley was old enough to understand what it meant, he joined his father in calling me a little fairy.  Just because I wasn’t a big beefy thing like them.  Dudley and his friends used to beat up an openly gay boy down the street.”
Hermione’s eyes immediately went to Draco.  “Why Harry?  Of all people, why choose someone you despised at one time?”
Draco crawled back over to the other side and popped a strawberry in his mouth.  Harry knew he must have had the most ridiculous expression on his face but didn’t care much.  Draco was grinning at him, looking slightly loopy himself.  Harry decided it was his turn to ask a question.
“The wards were strengthened,” The Auror told him.  “Only a Malfoy or a select few Aurors can get through.”
“Draco,” Harry nudged the blond as they walked toward the Great Hall.  “Isn’t that Justin and Millicent?  Are you sure you dismantled that game?”
“But, Harry,” Draco’s demeanor took a serious turn.  “There are reporters in the lounge.  I don’t think they know what’s going on, but they saw me.  One of them tried to ask me questions.  Apparently, he saw the pair of you walk in as well.”
He hadn’t intended to fall asleep.  It wasn’t that Harry’s story wasn’t interesting.  It was habit to fall asleep while reading on the sofa with Harry, and it seemed that habit was fairly ingrained at this point.
“You’ve changed,” Harry smiled.  “For the better.  The fact that you regret some of your past makes you no different than anyone else.  I told your father, when I spoke to him alone, that he should be proud of you.”
Exhausted from cleaning out the potions supply cabinet, Draco dragged his feet to the Great Hall to meet Blaise, Harper and Pansy for lunch.  He rolled his eyes and growled slightly as he realized he was walking behind Terry Boot and Stephen Cornfoot.  Cornfoot turned his head, then nudged Boot.
“You shouldn’t have even gotten yourself in a position where that was a possibility.  I can’t believe you’re defending this.”
As gingerly as possible, Harry crawled onto the bed and hovered over his lover on all fours.  Draco took in a sharp breath but didn’t open his eyes.  He shifted slightly in his sleep.
Harry stepped forward and put his hand on Draco’s shoulder, while peeking inside the room.  “Looks like your overnight bags are in here as well.”
“That doesn’t make any sense.  You tell me I know who the mother is.  But it’s not Ginny.  Or at least, in my heart, I don’t think it’s Ginny.”  Harry sighed and shook his head.  He liked the journal better when it simply accepted what he wrote rather than giving him cryptic messages.  Harry began to write again as if it were any other journal.  A diary to keep track of his thoughts and significant events.
When the table was cleared, the two couples sat in Draco and Harry’s corner.  Harry preferred to face the crowd, so Ron and Hermione sat with their backs to the door.
Chuckling, Harry replied, “Probably.  But that’s not why he didn’t come into the kitchen.  Dominique fell asleep in his lap and he didn’t want to wake her.”
Harry chuckled at Draco’s discomfort. “She’s brought you a book.  Read to her.” He smiled.  “I wonder how she knew you were excellent at reading aloud.”
She took his hand in hers.  “Draco darling, all I’ve ever wanted is your happiness.  If this makes you happy, then I accept it.  If Harry loves you that much, you hold onto him.  Hold on with everything you have and don’t let go.” She smiled, but it did not reach her eyes.  “But Draco, make sure you love him back equally. There is little worse than loving with all your heart and getting nothing in return,” she warned.
“Then I suppose you wouldn’t mind if I went then,” Hermione sneered.  “Even if I chose Nott? Or how about Malfoy?”
“Master Harry is finally awake,” she smiled demurely.  “Poppy has been waiting to serve you.”  She bowed to him.
Draco’s smug expression dropped.  He didn’t need to be reminded of how he and Harry had fought against one another. Fortunately, Harry stepped in.
“I suppose I’d better mingle too,” Draco suggested.  “Or it might look like we like each other.”  He grinned wickedly, showing his newly grown fangs, and walked away into the crowd.
“Oh, right. Anyway, if you can ever get there, I highly recommend the trip. It’s very romantic,” Harry said.
“I didn’t know who you were for sure, at first,” Parvati admitted.  “But when we danced close together, I could smell your cologne.”
Harry shook his head.  “I want to go to my office and write my report while it’s still fresh in my mind.”
Harry hugged Draco.  He was grateful to have a partner so accepting of him.  A future with Harry would be unpredictable.  And possibly subject to more prophetic dreams.  But Draco was willing to take on the challenge.
“I may not have as much money as I used to, but I still have good taste,” Draco grinned.  “Which is why there are only three bottles in my liquor cabinet,” he laughed.
Draco wiggled his eyebrows and leaned over to lick Harry’s neck and give his ear a little nibble. When the Gryffindor turned his head, his mouth was met with Draco’s warm lips.  How he loved those lips.  Harry opened his mouth and ran his tongue along his partner’s plump bottom lip. The Slytherin reciprocated with his own tongue and the two leisurely kissed on Harry’s bed.
“They want to make certain this deal doesn’t come back to bite them in the arse. I just hope I actually did register at one of those hotels using my first name.”
“Thank you,” Hermione smiled politely. She probably wouldn’t find her way there. As curious as she was about the Malfoy library, Hermione wasn’t likely to ever step foot in the Manor again. Going to rescue Harry was just about the only thing that could have gotten her to return to that awful place.
“Oh, I’m sorry,” she said, in a tone that was clearly insincere.  She placed Harry’s sandwich down, along with Hermione’s.  Another waitress, beside her, placed Draco and Ron’s food down.
“All right,” Harry said gently. “We don’t have to talk about it. You’re right, it’s much too soon to even think about.  We need time to be together.  Just you and me.”
“Yeah, you woke me up,” Ron remembered.  “You said you had a bad dream.  You’re not dreaming about . . . you know who again, are you?”
“Nobody but you comes to the library on a Sunday night.”  Harry smoothed his shirt out and tried to press down his hair.
“Don’t press your luck,” Draco smiled. “But I’ll try to be more open minded. I had a great time, but would you mind if we left now?”
Harry closed his eyes while Draco’s fingers massaged his scalp.  One hand moved down his body to the other patch of dark hair. But Draco was more interested in the hard cock waiting for him than cleaning anymore.  In a swift move, he reversed them and pushed Harry under the spray.
“I’ll have a . . . salad with grilled chicken.  Light dressing on the side.”  Ron gave an embarrassed smile.  “Hermione says I’m starting to get a belly from too much butter beer.”
Resisting the urge to ask again what happened, Harry sat down next to Draco at the table where the rest of the students had gathered.  There were so few students that remained over the holidays, that they all sat together at one table.
activities.  Oops, maybe we shouldn’t have sent him that owl.” He laughed and continued on his way to the Great Hall.
“Yes.” Tracey’s shoulders hunched and her toes curled while she whimpered through the orgasm.  “Oh, God.”
To prove it, Harry spent the rest of the afternoon with Draco, sharing tales of his own less than proud moments in life.  The Potions professor was surprised to hear about regrets that his hero had.  He’d assumed that Harry was the kind of person that always did the right thing.  Though, he enjoyed hearing about the things Harry and his friends got away with.
Across the table from Draco, Pansy caught Harry’s eye.  She smiled brightly and waved to him, much to his horror.  Blaise and Draco both turned to see who she was waving to.  Hermione asked aloud why Pansy was waving to him.
“Uh, yeah, sure.” Draco placed the tray on his dresser and turned back to face Harry. “On second thought, why don’t we skip the tea.”
“Well, if I have to get to know him, so do you Mione.  And Parkinson.  She’s practically attached at the hip with him.” Ron straightened up.  “I think Mione needs to spend time with Pansy.”
Pouring a bit more lube, just to be safe, Harry grabbed onto himself and guided his cock back into his lover.  Though the position was a familiar one, the feeling of Draco’s exceptionally tight arse made the experience uniquely intense.  As Harry pumped in and out, his hands roamed Draco’s perfectly toned body.  His thumb raked a pert nipple, causing the blond to gasp.
“I think that would be a last resort,” Harry said.  “Having our own squib would be one thing.  But purposely adopting a child that would find it difficult to live in the wizarding world may be more than we can handle.”
“When you said you’d have to find someone else to shag.” 	Harry shook his head in disbelief.  “I didn’t say anything about Knox.  I was kidding.  I wasn’t even thinking about him.”
“Thank you again for watching her.”  Hermione kissed his cheek. “I do wish you’d give parenthood some more thought.  I don’t think anyone who shows as much patience and caring as you do, should let it go to waste.”
“I missed supper too,” said Harry.  “Would you like me to go pick you up something from the cafeteria?”
Lucius gave a sideways glance and complied. He knew better than to give the guards any excuses to use magic against him.  As he sank back into his chair, he kept his glare on Harry.
Draco turned his head. “What?” he laughed.  “You called me ferret face.  I don’t think you’d call someone you found attractive ferret face.”
Looking at a parchment in front of him, the man pursed his lips. “I have information here indicating a Mr. Malfoy traveling in Venice, Italy. There are hotel records as well as restaurant receipts.  Also, the same for Triora, Italy during a consecutive time period.”
Somewhat surprised by Harry’s question, he answered, “Yes, I’ve been one most of my life. Are you interested?”
Laughing, Harry agreed, “Good. ‘Cause I don’t want to tell you about that stuff.”  His mood turned more serious.  “Are you going to be okay with all of this?”
“This seems sort of familiar,” Harry said.  “But I don’t think I’ve ever seen it.  I haven’t really seen much art.”
